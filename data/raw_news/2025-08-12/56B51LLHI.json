  "title": "Best Earbuds and Headphones for Workouts and the Gym in 2025",
  "description": "Looking for headphones or earbuds that are well-suited for gym use? These are my current favorites among dozens of sport-friendly models I've tested.",
  "content": "While it's true that you can wear any earbuds or headphones while working out, some are better suited for gym use and other sporting activities than others, particularly when it comes to their design. Sports buds are not only sweat- and water-resistant but they often have sport fins or ear hooks to help keep them securely attached to your ears. And earbuds with an open design, including new clip-on models that attach to your ears like earrings, allow you to hear the outside world for safety reasons. For even more workout audio options, check out our best bone-conduction headphones, best running headphones, best clip-on earbuds and best true-wireless sports earbuds with ear hooks lists. I've tested all the earbuds and headphones on this list and fully reviewed several of them.\n\nWhat are the best headphones for working out?\n\nWhile their design won't be perfect fit for everyone, I currently have the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 as the top earbuds/headphones for working out. They're improved in every way from their predecessor and people who liked the originals should be impressed with this next-gen version. That said, plenty of other more affordable workout earbuds options are available, with several models on the list costing less than $100.\n\nBest earbuds and headphones for working out for 2025\n\nOther workout headphones and earbuds we tested Shokz OpenFit Air: Shokz, the company formerly known as AfterShokz, has long been the leader in bone-conduction headphones. However, this model, like Shokz's step-up OpenFit true-wireless earbuds, doesn't use bone-conduction technology. They have an open design that fires sound into your ears using custom speaker drivers, which Shokz dubs \"air conduction\" technology. While Shokz' flagship OpenFit 2 buds sound slightly better, have better battery life (up to 11 hours instead of 6 at moderate volume levels) and a physical control button, the Open Fit Air cost about $60 less and are a tad lighter and quite comfortable to wear. That said, it appears that they are being phased out by Shokz. Edifier LolliClip: Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds may be the best-sounding and most comfortable clip-on earbuds but they list for $300. In contrast, Edifier's new LolliClip buds cost $130 and their sound is pretty close to what you get with the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds -- and they're almost as comfortable to wear while fitting my ears securely. They also have some features the Bose buds don't have, including active noise canceling (it's not all that effective but you do sense it muffling some noise in the lower frequencies), a heart-rate monitor, blood oxygen sensor and spatial audio with head-tracking. There's also a low-latency mode for gaming and support the LDAC for Android users. Jabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2: Jabra billed these buds, which have unfortunately been discontinued, as the \"world's toughest earbuds,\" and based on our tests (they survived several drops without a scratch), that may very well be true. While there are two new color options, the Gen 2 model doesn't look any different from the original but it includes an LE Audio smart case, allowing wireless streaming from any device with USB-C or 3.5mm port (I tested it with inflight entertainment and it worked well, with no audio lag). The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 also feature enhanced spatial sound powered by Dolby Audio \"for a better music experience,\" enhanced Natural HearThrough for better awareness when outdoors, and improved noise-canceling performance. Soundcore by Anker Sport X10: The Soundcore Sport X10 have an interesting design with rotating swiveling ear hooks that flip up when you're using them and flip down when you want to set them in their charging case, which has a smaller footprint than a lot of buds with ear hooks. As long as you get a tight seal, they sound good, with powerful, punchy bass and good detail. They also have active noise canceling, which is effective but not as good as Sony's or Bose's noise canceling. They're also fully waterproof with an IP rating of IPX7, which means they can be fully submerged in up to 3 feet of water for 30 minutes. Battery life is rated at up to eight hours with an additional three charges in the charging case. Shokz Open Move: Shokz' entry-level OpenMove bone-conduction headphone lists for $80, although we've occasionally seen it drop below $70. It replaces the older Titanium model and features some small design upgrades. I found it comfortable to wear and while it doesn't sound great, it sounds relatively good for a bone-conduction headphone -- again, keep your sound quality expectations in check or you'll be disappointed. It's very good for listening to podcasts, audiobooks and news broadcasts while you run. Sennheiser Sport True Wireless: The Sport True Wireless bluetooth earbuds (about $130) are essentially Sennheiser's CX True Wireless earbuds with sport fins -- for a more secure fit -- and better durability. They have an IP54 rating that makes them splash-proof and dust-resistant. The CX True Wireless, rated IPX4, don't offer dust resistance. Skullcandy Push Active : With their ear-hook design, they're essentially a more affordable version of the Beats Powerbeats Pro and they actually fit my ears slightly better than the Powerbeats Pro -- I'm not usually a fan of ear-hook style buds, but these are one of the better models. They also cost a lot less than the Beats. Cleer Audio Arc 2 Sport: Cleer's original Arc earbuds were solid sport earbuds that featured decent sound for open-style buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. The 2023 model (about $170) steps up the sound quality and offers additional refinements and feature upgrades, including a new \"enhanced\" charging case with UV sterilization and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity (Bluetooth 5.3), all of which makes for a significantly improved product. Beats Powerbeats Pro: While the Powerbeats Pro remain popular workout earbuds, they've been around for several years so it's best to buy them at significant discount. JBL Live Pro 2: Over the years, JBL headphones have put out some decent true-wireless bluetooth earbuds, but nothing that really got me too excited. That's finally changed with the arrival of the Samsung-owned brand's new Live Pro 2 and Live Free 2 buds. Both sets of buds -- the Live Pro 2 have stems while the Live Free 2 have a pill-shaped design -- offer a comfortable fit along with strong noise canceling, very good sound quality and voice-calling performance, plus a robust set of features, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, an IP rating of IPX5 (splash-proof) and wireless charging. Sony LinkBuds: The LinkBuds are, in a sense, Sony's answer to Apple's standard AirPods. While they don't sound as good as Sony's flagship WF-1000XM4 or the LinkBuds S noise-isolating Bluetooth earbuds, they offer a discreet, innovative design and a more secure fit than the AirPods, as well as decent sound and very good voice-calling performance. Like the third-gen AirPods, their open design allows you to hear the outside world -- that's what the ring is all about. Read our Sony LinkBuds review.",

  "summary": "The article lists the best earbuds and headphones for working out in 2025. While some are better suited for gym use and other sporting activities, others are better for their design. Sports buds are often sweat-resistant and often have sport fins or ear hooks to keep them securely attached to their ears. The article also lists best bone-conduction headphones, best running headphones, and best true-wireless sports earbud with ear hooks lists. While the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 are currently the top earbudd/headphones for work out, there are also several more affordable workout earruds available. Shokz's OpenFit Air, the company's step-up OpenFit true-Wireless headphones, cost about $60 less and are lighter and more comfortable to wear. Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds are the best-sounding and most comfortable clip-on ear buds, while Edifier's new LolliClip buds cost $130.",

      "text": "Pros\n- Fit comfortably and securely with a lightweight, innovative design\n- Good sound for open earbuds\n- Open design allows you to hear outside world\n- Excellent voice calling performance\n- IPX4 splashproof\n- Some notable extra features, including Speak to Chat and Wide Area Tap\nCons\n- May not play loud enough for some people, particularly in noisier environments\n- Open design allows ambient sound to leak in\n- No multipoint Bluetooth pairing\nWhen I first got my hands on Sony's new LinkBuds, I was a bit surprised. For starters, they had an actual name you can easily remember and not some funky model number. But the bigger shock was the design: Each earbud literally has a hole punched through it so you can hear the outside world in addition to your music. Think of it as a built-in version of transparency mode, but without any need for electronic intervention. Kinda weird, right? How does that fit -- and feel -- in your ear?\nBetter than you might think. And in some sense, the LinkBuds ($180, \u00a3149, AU$300) are Sony's answer to Apple's standard AirPods, now on their third generation. While they don't sound as good as Sony's flagship WF-1000XM4 noise-isolating earbuds, they offer a discreet, innovative design and a more secure fit than the AirPods, as well as good sound. In short, I'm impressed with what Sony has done with the LinkBuds, although they do have some downsides.\nBuilt to play all day\nSony says the concept behind the LinkBuds was to make \"an always-on product to link your online and offline worlds.\" I'm not exactly sure what that means, but the idea is that these buds are supposed to be comfortable to wear around all the time without shutting you off from the outside world.\nThat's where the ring comes in. As I said, these are open earbuds like the standard AirPods, so they allow ambient noise in. But in some ways they're more akin to Samsung's Galaxy Buds Live earbuds, also known as The Beans, because they have a stemless design. And although they're not exactly kidney-shaped, they are elongated.\nThey come in two colors, white and dark gray, and Sony says both the case and buds are made out of recycled plastic *that gives them a speckled look,\" which may be a first for earbuds. I'll get into whether I think they're a good value at $180, but they're basically in line with what the third-gen AirPods and Galaxy Buds Live cost when they first launched.\nRead more: The 22 best wireless earbuds for 2022\nI'd say the one big advantage these have over both the third-gen AirPods and the Galaxy Buds Live is that they're designed to stay in your ears more securely. I was able to get a good fit with the Buds Live and a decent fit with the AirPods 3, but I've heard from plenty of people who couldn't get the Buds Live to stay in their ears. Not everybody can get a secure fit with the AirPods either, even the latest model, which is why you see all those AirPods wing accessories on Amazon. \"I had to get the AirPods Pro because the AirPods didn't really stay in my ears,\" is a comment I've encountered more than a few times.\nThe LinkBuds come with five different sizes of fins or Arc Supporters, as Sony calls them. Medium is the default size but there's also extra small, small, large and extra large. The large and extra large worked well for me and the fin wedges under that top ridge on your ear and helps lock the bud in place. I wouldn't say these lock in quite as well as the Beats Fit Pro, but they're arguably more comfortable, particularly if you don't like having an ear tip jammed in your ear.\nIt's pretty self-explanatory how the buds fit in your ears, but the app does have a tutorial that shows you how they're supposed to fit. What's interesting is the way the ring sits in your ear: It's partially hidden so people can't see it. From the outside, it just looks like you're wearing regular buds.\nThey may not fit everybody's ears perfectly, but I found them comfortable to wear and when I wasn't playing audio I'd occasionally forgot I was wearing them. From time to time, I made little adjustments to how they sat in my ears and the rings's position in your ear can impact sound quality slightly (getting it right over your canal and firing the speaker directly into it helps). You can tweak the sound a bit in the companion app for iOS and Android but changing the EQ settings doesn't dramatically change the sound profile. Engaging bass boost, for example, only gets you a touch more bass.\nThese use Sony's V1 integrated processor, which is its version of a Bluetooth system on a chip, or SoC. It's Bluetooth 5.2 and like the Sony WF-1000XM4, the LinksBuds unfortunately do not support multipoint Bluetooth pairing. That means you can't connect the buds to two devices at the same time -- like your phone and your computer -- or take an incoming call on your phone while the buds are paired to your computer.\nSony says the buds have 12mm drivers and are IPX4 splashproof. I got some shots of them in the rain and was a little worried I might have let them get a little too wet. But after I dried them off, they worked fine, so you can use them for workouts and runs -- and they did stay in my ears when I ran with them.\nThese aren't noise-canceling earbuds and they don't have a transparency mode because they're naturally transparent. If you pause your music, it basically sounds as if you're not wearing earbuds.\nCool extra features\nThe LinkBuds do have a few extra features and a couple of them are impressive. In terms of more standard features for buds in this price range, they have ear-detection sensors. That means when you take a bud out of your ear, your music automatically pauses and then resumes when you put the bud back in your ear. And yes, podcast fans, you can use a single bud for audio listening and leave the other one charging in the case.\nThe buds have touch controls and they work just fine. But what's cool is that if you want, instead of tapping on a bud, you can tap on your face, just in front of your ear. Sony calls the feature Wide Area Tap and you can turn it on or off in the companion app. It's two taps to pause your music and three taps to advance a track. And you can also set taps for volume controls.\nThe LinkBuds also carry over Sony's Speak To Chat feature found in its WF-1000XM4 buds and WH-1000XM4 over-ear headphones. That's the feature where if you start talking to someone your music automatically pauses so you can have a conversation. Your music resumes about 15 seconds after you stop talking.\nIf you talk to yourself or your pets a lot, you might want to turn the feature off in the app. It uses up a touch more battery life when you have it on. Battery life is rated at up to 5.5 hours at moderate volume levels, so it's not stellar, but the case does provide a couple of extra charges and has a quick charge feature that gives you 90 minutes of playback time after just 10 minutes.\nThe third-gen AirPods have Apple's spatial audio virtual surround sound feature, which works with movies and TV content along with music. Like the WF-1000XM4 and WH-1000XM4, the LinkBuds support Sony's surround sound music format, 360 Reality Audio. A handful of streaming services -- Tidal, Amazon Music, Deezer and Nugs.net -- have libraries of tracks recorded in the new format.\nLastly, the LinkBuds have Google Fast Pair, so connecting them to an Android phone is a cinch.\nQuality sound for open buds\nHow do these sound? They're good, but not as good as the WF-1000XM4. They also fall short of the third-gen AirPods, which offer better sound than their second-gen predecessors. They have a nice, open natural sound, well-balanced with good detail and just enough bass. But like a lot of open earbuds, they just don't deliver the same kind of bass response as a set of noise-isolating buds. For instance, a track like Spoon's Knock Knock Knock, which has a deep bass line, just doesn't have the same visceral impact as it does if you're listening over the WF-1000XM4 buds or even the 2021 AirPods. While there's enough bass, it just doesn't go that deep (even with Bass Boost engaged) or pack a big punch. Some people won't mind that, but if you're into bass, these may not quite cut it for you.\nAnd while they have Sony's DSEE digital sound enhancing feature -- which makes your music sound a little fuller -- there's no support for Sony's near-lossless LDAC codec like the WF-1000XM4 offers.\nThey also have the same issue that all open earbuds have in noisier environments. They let sound in, so whatever you're listening to competes with whatever ambient sound you encounter.\nFor a lot of people that's a feature not a bug. For safety reasons, you often want to hear the outside world. But you should be aware that despite having an adaptive volume control feature that automatically adjusts the volume to your environment, some folks may have an issue with how loud they play.\nI paired these with an iPhone 13 Pro and a Google Pixel 4 XL and streamed music from Apple Music, Spotify and Qobuz. There was some variation in volume levels across devices and streaming services. And I do think the shape of your ear and how the speaker ring sits in it can affect volume levels: Some people may think they play plenty loud while others may not, which could make a big difference outdoors when you're dealing with competing sounds, including wind noise.\nSony is aiming the LinkBuds at Gen Z and I guess it doesn't want to kill younger people's ears, which I appreciate. In my ears, the AirPods 3 played louder and had a bigger soundstage overall. So did the Galaxy Buds Live -- but those can distort at higher volumes, while the LinkBuds don't. Ultimately, the LinkBuds have clearer and more accurate sound than both the Buds Live and AirPods 3.\nTop-notch for voice calling\nWhile Sony's WF-1000XM4 buds have these beat for sound quality, the LinkBuds are better for making voice calls. Sony won't say how many microphones the Link Buds have -- I see only one external mic on each bud -- but the company says it's improved the noise-reduction algorithm and callers told me my voice sounded clear with minimal background noise in the noisy streets of New York.\nThere's one issue: Unlike noise-isolating earbuds, you won't be able to hear the person you're calling as well as they may be able to hear you if there's a lot of noise around you. On the other hand, you can hear your voice as you're speaking, so you won't end up talking too loudly.\nSo these earbuds are, surprisingly, at the upper echelon for voice-calling performance. I just hope Sony brings that same new algorithm to the WF-1000XM4 with a firmware upgrade.\nSony LinkBuds: Final thoughts\nAs I said, I'm generally impressed with what Sony's done with the LinkBuds. And that's not just because the marketing team gave them a real name. Open earbuds are difficult to do well and these have an innovative design. Not only are they comfortable to wear, they also stay in my ears well. And even if they don't play quite as loud as I'd like in noisier environments, they sound good for open buds. I'm also a fan of the Speak To Talk and Wide Area tap features.\nThe LinkBuds are an excellent alternative to AirPods, particularly for those who have trouble keeping Apple's earbuds in their ears and Android users who can't use Apple-only features such as spatial audio.\nThe LinkBuds are a little expensive at $180 but I do think there's room for some discounting. While they feel premium enough, they're missing features like wireless charging and both the case and buds don't feel quite as solid and substantial compared to what you get with the WF-1000XM4. Like the Galaxy Buds Live, I think you'll see the street price on these come down quickly. They're well worth checking out if you are looking for open earbuds."

      "text": "If you don't like having true-wireless earbuds with silicone ear tips jammed in your ears, open earbuds are a good alternative, though the lack of a tight seal allows ambient sound to leak in. That can become a problem in noisy environments, but it's also an important safety feature for runners, bikers or anyone who prefers to stay tuned in to their surroundings. While noise-canceling earbuds with silicone or foam tips tend to deliver richer sound with more bass, in recent years the sound of open earbuds has improved and the best models now serve up good sound in comfortable, lightweight designs that will fit your ears securely, making them excellent options for running and working out. I've personally tested all the earbuds on this list and fully reviewed some of them.\nOur Picks\nHEADPHONE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $250 (save $101)\n- $295 (save $154)\n- $278 (save $70)\n- $280 (save $170)\nRead more: Best True Wireless Earbuds for 2025\nBest open earbuds of 2025\nPros\n- Slightly improved design and comfort\n- Impressive sound for open earbuds\n- Improved battery life\n- New physical control button\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\nShokz has released the second-gen OpenFit 2 with a slightly upgraded design, upgraded drivers that noticeably improve the sound quality, better battery life and a new physical control button. The changes don't seem huge on the surface, but the improvements are significant. They fit my ears more comfortably than the originals and have superior sound quality with more bass and better clarity. They sound excellent for open earbuds -- at least in quieter environments.\nPros\n- Same H2 chip found in AirPods Pro 2\n- More compact design\n- Active noise canceling that works\n- Improved sound\n- Excellent voice-calling performance\n- Personalized spatial audio\n- Case has wireless charging and speaker for Find My\nCons\n- Battery life could be a little better\n- Noise-canceling isn't as good as AirPods Pro 2's\nWhy I like them\nThe AirPods 4 are, unsurprisingly, the fourth generation of Apple's original true-wireless earbuds that feature an open design, which means they don't have silicone ear tips like the AirPods Pro 2. Not only do they feature a slightly smaller design and better sound than their predecessor, but they're equipped with Apple's H2 chip that improves overall performance and powers Apple's ever expanding AirPods features, though they don't have the AirPods Pro 2's Hearing Aid mode. Read my Apple AirPods 4 review.\nThe AirPods 4 comes in two versions: a $129 entry-level model and a $179 step-up model with active noise canceling. ANC is a rare feature for open earbuds because it typically doesn't work with an open design, but these are the first open buds I've tried to have active noise canceling that actually works (it's about half as strong as the AirPods Pro 2's noise canceling). That's pretty cool and worth the extra $50 if you can afford it.\nReasons to buy\nA lot of people don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears and find open earbuds more comfortable (plus, you can hear the the outside world for safety reasons), and the AirPods 4 are made for those Apple users. They also sound very good for open earbuds and feature excellent voice-calling performance along with Apple's spatial audio and likable pinch controls. The AirPods 4 with Active Noise Canceling are more special simply because noise canceling . While the AirPods 4 with ANC noise muffling capabilities aren't that great compared with what you get with the AirPods Pro 2 and top noise-canceling earbuds like the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds or the Sony WF-1000XM5. But that it works at all and is reasonably effective is kind of wild because, as I said, noise canceling and open earbuds usually aren't a good mix.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nWhile their slightly smaller, updated design fits a wider range of ears more securely, some folks may not get a secure fit. The AirPods Pro 2 offer a more flexible fit because they include four different sizes of ear tips. They also deliver better sound with more bass and significantly better noise canceling in a noise-isolating design.\nPros\n- Innovative clip-on fit\n- Comfortable to wear\n- Very good sound for open earbuds\n- Decent voice-calling performance\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Look may not appeal to everyone\n- Not great for noisy environments\nThe Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have one of the most unusual designs of any earbuds I've tested over the last several years. They literally clip onto the side of your ears, kind of like earrings, and their open design has micro speakers that fire sound into your ears while still being able to hear what's happening around you. They're still true wireless earbuds, and at $299, they're somewhat overpriced. Otherwise, there's a lot to like about them, including a surprisingly comfortable, secure fit and very good sound quality for open buds.\nPros\n- Good sound for clip-on open earbuds\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Good battery life\n- Wireless charging\nCons\n- Pricey\n- Voice-calling performance could be a little better\nThe well-designed OpenDots One are among the best open earbuds out there right now. While they don't sound quite as good as the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, they're pretty close and fit my ears slightly better and have better battery life. Like the Ultra Open Earbuds, which list for $299 but are currently on sale for $249, they're overpriced, but at least they cost less than the Bose and their case has wireless charging. Read review.\nPros\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Improved sound with more bass\n- Good battery life\n- Well-priced\nCons\n- A little heavier than Shokz models\nAnker's Soundcore AeroFit 2 open earbuds have been completely redesigned and look quite different from the original AeroFit buds. The second-gen Aerofit are not only more comfortable but look sleeker, sound significantly better and offer all-around improvements. The buds aren't as light as the Shokz OpenFit 2 buds and don't sound quite as good, but they cost less and offer good all-around performance with augmented bass response. Available in multiple colors, they're a good option for those looking for ear-hook style open earbuds with a fairly premium design and good sound quality without the high price tag of top-end models.\nPros\n- Good sound quality for clip-on earbuds\n- Nicely-designed with comfortable, secure fit (flexible joint)\n- Good voice-calling performance\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\nThe Soundcore by AeroClip are Anker's current flagship clip-on earbuds. Not only do I like their design -- they have a premium look and feel -- but they're comfortable to wear and feature very good sound for clip-on buds. Equipped with 12mm drivers, they serve up ample bass with good volume and decent clarity. The buds sound fuller and more open than many cheaper clip-on buds and are among the better-sounding open earbuds I've tried (Android users should note that they have support for Sony's high-quality LDAC audio codec). I also thought they worked well for making calls. For the most part, callers said they could hear me clearly -- even in noisier environments like the streets of New York City (Anker says they have four beamforming mics, wind-blocking meshes and advanced AI). Battery life is rated at up to 8 hours at moderate volume levels, and the buds are IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant (they're splash-proof). Their only drawback is their somewhat high price tag.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Decent sound\n- Good battery life\nCons\n- Somewhat generic design\nWhy I like them\nBaseus is known for its value earbuds, power banks and charging products. While its Bowie MC1 aren't in the same league as Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, they cost around a sixth of the price and sound pretty decent for this style of of clip-on earbuds, particularly with less demanding tracks that don't feature heavy bass and a lot of instruments playing at the same time. On Amazon, you'll find clip-on buds with a similar design, including the Tozo OpenEarRing ($30) and Amazfit Up ($50), so they're a little generic. But I found the sound quality to be slightly better many competing clip-on value buds. I also liked that they have a single physical control button on each bud for controlling playback and adjusting volume levels.\nBattery life is rated for up to 9 hours at moderate volume levels, which is good, but expect to get les than that because you do tend to have to listen to open earbuds at higher volumes, especially in noisier environments. With an IP57 certification, the buds are splash-proof and dust-proof, making them suitable for runners and bikers. Voice-calling capabilities are also decent though don't expect business-class performance.\nReasons to buy\nThe Bowie MC1 are among the best budget clip-on earbuds.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nBaseus has been releasing new clip-on earbuds at a rapid clip with the upgraded MC1 Pro, which feature slightly fuller sound sound with more bass, available now for about $30 more than the MC1.\nPros\n- Lightweight and very comfortable\n- Excellent design\n- Good sound for open earbuds\n- Good call quality\nCons\n- Sound quality and battery life is slightly better with step-up OpenFit model\nShokz, the company formerly known as AfterShokz, has long been the leader in bone-conduction headphones. However, this model, like Shokz's step-up OpenFit true-wireless earbuds, doesn't use bone-conduction technology. They have an open design that fires sound into your ears using custom speaker drivers, which Shokz dubs \"air conduction\" technology.\nWhile Shokz' flagship OpenFit 2 buds sound slightly better, have better battery life (up to 11 hours instead of 6 at moderate volume levels) and a physical control button, the Open Fit Air cost around $60 less and are a tad lighter and quite comfortable to wear. Available in three color options, they're lightweight (8.5 grams) and comfortable, and I liked how the ear hooks felt soft but had just the right amount of rigidity. They're IP54 splash-proof and dust-resistant and their charging case is fairly compact for this style of sports buds with ear hooks.\nWhile the earbuds sound quite good for open earbuds, they don't sound quite as good as a set of noise-isolating earbuds in this price range (they're a tad bass shy). Nor do they sound as good Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, which do cost more and serve up a little more bass and fuller sound (the Bose also sound slightly better than Shokz Open Fit buds). Equipped with two microphones in each bud, the Open Fit Air offer good voice-calling performance. Additionally, the feature multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them to two devices simultaneously.\nPros\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Very good sound for clip-on open earbuds\n- Active noise canceling\n- Spatial audio with head tracking\n- Heart-rate and blood oxygen detection\nCons\n- Noise canceling isn't all that effective\n- Touch controls are a little finicky\nBose's Ultra Open Earbuds may be the best-sounding and most comfortable clip-on earbuds. But they list for $300. In contrast, Edifier's new LolliClip buds cost $130 and their sound is pretty close to what you get with the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds -- and they're almost as comfortable to wear while fitting my ears securely. They also have some features the Bose buds don't have, including active noise canceling (it's not all that effective but you do sense it muffling some noise in the lower frequencies), a heart-rate monitor, blood oxygen sensor and spatial audio with head-tracking. There's also a low-latency mode for gaming and support the LDAC audio codec for Android users.\nThe buds have a battery life rating of up to 6 hours with noise canceling on and 9 hours with it off at moderate volume levels. As for water-resistance, their IP56 rating means they can withstand a sustained spray of water and they're also dust-resistant. As I said, I was overall impressed with the sound quality. It's not going to be quite as good as what you get with noise-isolating earbuds with silicone ear tips that you jam in your ears, but for open buds it's quite good. With these type of buds, which allow you to hear the outside world for safety reasons, the bass tends to be a little weak. But the LolliClip buds output ample bass (you have a few EQ settings to choose from, including a bass boost mode) and offer decent clarity. Note that you will have to play around with the fit of the buds on your ears to optimize the sound quality -- a little adjustment can make a significant difference. Voice-calling performance was good but not exceptionally so.\nMy only gripe is with the touch controls. They're a little finicky (you have to figure out just what is the touch zone), but you do get several customization options in the Edifier ConneX companion app.\nPros\n- Comfortable fit\n- Good sound\n- Loaded with features\n- Touchscreen in charging case\n- Built-in voice controls\n- Dolby spatial audio with head tracking\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\n- Case is a little large\nCleer's Arc 2 earbuds were among the best-sounding open wireless earbuds with an ear-hook design. Among this style of open buds, the new Arc 3 buds are still near the top for sound but other companies like Shokz and Bose have caught up and arguably sound slightly better. But the Cleer Arc 3 buds have something that other buds of this ilk don't have: a touchscreen LCD built into its charging case. It allows you to control playback and access the buds' features, including EQ settings and even use the case as a remote to snap a photo on your smartphone.\nIn fact, the Arc 3 are probably the most feature-rich open earbuds out there right now -- and they're fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating. They have built-in voice-controls to raise and lower volume and skip tracks forward and back as well as Dolby Atmos spatial audio with head-tracking. Additionally, you can nod your head twice to take a call or shake your head back and forth to reject it (this feature is referred to as \"gesture\" controls). And finally, the UV light that sterilizes the buds when they're in the case and a step counter.\nWhile the sound can be a tad uneven from track to track and the buds' bass lacks a little punch compared to what you get with a good set of noise-isolating buds in this price range, they fit my ears comfortably and securely. They also offered solid voice-calling performance. They're a little expensive but their price seems to be creeping down a bit.\nPros\n- Smaller ring-shaped driver and new Air Fitting Supporters create a more comfortable, secure fit\n- Improved sound\n- Decent voice-calling performance\n- Built-in voice controls\nCons\n- May not fit some ears comfortably\n- Fairly pricey\nWhile the LinkBuds Open retain the ring-shaped open driver of the original LinkBuds, it's slightly smaller than the original's driver (11mm versus 12mm). Also, the Air Fitting Supporters are an improvement over the original's Arc Supporters, which were quite slim and didn't conform to the shape of your ear as well as these new supporters do. The combination of the slightly smaller driver design and the new supporters should allow the buds to fit more ears more comfortably and securely. However, those with smaller ears may have some issues with them.\nI personally got a very secure fit and was able to run with the buds without a problem (they're IPX4 splashproof). The originals created some pressure points for some wearers. I had to fiddle around with their positioning in my ears from time to time, but I didn't experience any pain points with the LinkBuds Fit. However, Apple's new AirPods 4 were slightly more comfortable in my ears, though they didn't fit as securely.\nAside from the fit, the other big change is to the sound quality. It's definitely improved. Despite the smaller drivers, the buds play more loudly and also deliver a little more bass. The buds are equipped with Sony's V2 digital processing chip and Sony says the driver's have a \"high-compliance diaphragm and powerful neodymium magnet\" that were \"specifically selected to reproduce clear mid- and high-frequency sound.\" I also liked the built-in voice controls.\nPros\n- Well-designed inexpensive earbuds\n- Good sound for open earbuds\n- Strong feature set, including hands-free Alexa\nCons\n- May not fit everyone's ears comfortably\n- Not a ton of bass\n- No ANC (they're open earbuds)\nAmazon's 2023 Echo Buds impressed me in a few ways that I wasn't expecting. For starters, they sound good for inexpensive open earbuds, delivering decent clarity and ample bass. But they also have a robust feature set, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, hands-free Alexa and ear-detection sensors that pause your audio when you take one or both buds out of your ears.\nTheir sound falls short of that of Apple's AirPods 4, which deliver better bass performance and overall fuller, cleaner sound (they're better at handling more complicated music tracks with a lot of instruments playing at the same time). But the AirPods 4, even the entry-level model ($129), cost significantly more.\nIn short, if you're looking for open earbuds -- or \"semi-open\" as these types of earbuds are sometimes called -- the Echo Buds are good value at their $50 list price and even easier to recommend when they go on sale for $30.\nPros\n- Lightweight and comfortable, secure fit\n- Attractively designed\n- Good sound\n- Easy-to-use pinch controls\n- Decent battery life\nCons\n- Some competitors sound slightly better\nThe Nothing Ear (Open) buds may not sound quite as good as Shokz' OpenFit 2 buds, but they do offer very respectable sound for open earbuds and I found them lightweight and comfortable to wear (the overall fit and where the buds end up sitting on your ears will impact sound quality, particularly when it comes to bass performance). Overall, the buds are well-designed and feature Nothing's signature translucent plastic on the exterior of the bud. They're IP54 certified, which means they're splash-proof and dust-resistant.\nAside from their design, I liked their pinch controls and slim, elongated case. Voice-calling performance was also good, though it can be a little harder to hear callers in noisy environments because these are open earbuds. Battery life is rated at 8 hours at moderate volume levels with an additional 22 hours in the charging case. While there's a bass boost mode as part of the equalizer settings in Nothing's companion app for iOS and Android (there's also a \"low-lag gaming mode), the buds can deliver only so much bass. But I was happy wearing them nevertheless.\nPros\n- Surprisingly good sound for inexpensive open earbuds\n- Decent call quality\n- Support Sony's LDAC audio codec for Android devices\nCons\n- The charging cases of lighter-colored versions show some grime\n- Open design allows sound to leak in and out\nWhat makes these Soundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS buds special is that they sound surprisingly good for open earbuds -- they're pretty close to what you get from Apple's AirPods 3 for sound. On top of that, they support Sony's LDAC audio codec for devices that offer it. Not too many cheap open earbuds have good sound but these Soundpeats have good bass response and clarity. They're also good for making calls and have a low-latency gaming mode. Battery life is rated at 5 hours at moderate volume levels, and these are IPX4 splash-proof.\nAnd be sure to activate the instant 10% off coupon to save a few bucks at checkout on Amazon.\nPros\n- Good build quality\n- Excellent sound for open buds\n- Good voice-calling performance\n- Comfortable fit\nCons\n- Don't fit all ears equally well\n- Somewhat pricey\n- Case is a little large\nBeyerdynamic is known for its sound quality, so it's not surprising the Verio 200, its first open earbuds with ear hooks, deliver top-notch sound with nice depth and richness. They have very good clarity and bass performance for this type of open earbuds and match the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds and Shokz OpenFit 2 for sound quality, and they may sound slightly better than those models depending on the fit you get. Unfortunately, how they fit your ears is the one big caveat about these buds. While they fit my ears comfortably and securely, they bent the top of my ears back a little so I looked a little funny wearing them. That said, they fit my wife's smaller ears perfectly.\nI should also note that they feature good build quality and voice-calling performance, but their feature set is somewhat limited (they support the AAC audio codec as well as the highest tiers of AptX, including AptX Lossless). I also found their touch controls a little finicky at first but then I got them working well by holding onto the outside of the bud as I tapped on them. The long and short of it is these will be very good open earbuds for some people but not everybody.\nFactors to consider when buying open earbuds\nBudget\nBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new open wireless earbuds. The quality of value-priced earbuds and headphones continues to improve, so you can find good affordable sports buds for less than $75. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost more than $100 and sometimes more than $150.\nFit, aka comfort\nIt's key that open wireless earbuds fit your ears not only comfortably but securely. They should offer a comfortable fit that allows you to wear the earbuds for long periods without any irritation. Since all the buds on this list have an open design, they should stay in your ears well. Some will fit in your ears more comfortably than others.\nDurability\nYou want open wireless buds that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality and a good water-resistance rating.\nReturn policy\nIt's critical to buy your open wireless earbuds at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days, and then return one.\nHow we test open wireless earbuds\nWe test open wireless earbuds based on five key criteria, comparing similarly styled and priced models. These criteria are design, sound quality, features, voice-calling performance and value.\nDesign\nWe assess not only how comfortable the earbuds fit (ergonomics) but their build quality and how well the controls are implemented. We also look at water- and dust-resistance ratings.\nSound quality\nWe evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing the open earbuds to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment.\nFeatures\nSome great-sounding open earbuds aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from noise-canceling and transparency modes (ambient sound mode) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears.\nVoice-calling performance\nWhen we test voice-calling performance, we make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the earbuds reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear your voice.\nValue\nWe determine value after evaluating the strength of the earbuds against all these criteria and what the buds are able to deliver compared to other models in their price class.\nOther open wireless earbuds we've tested\n1More Fit SE S30: 1More makes a few open sports earbuds with ear hooks, including the newer Fit SE S31 ($50). The Fit S50 ($100) feature a little better sound than the Fit SE S30, have a more premium design and are fully waterproof (IPX7 rating). But I like the fit a little better on the step-down S30, which is IPX5 splashproof (it can sustain a spray of water) and costs less than $40, making it a better value.\nSoundcore by Anker AeroFit Pro: The AeroFit Pro are among the better open-ear \"air conduction\" earbuds, with a premium look and feel, and are comfortable to wear. (I had no problem keeping them on my ears while running or working out.) On the downside, they're expensive, but they do feature strong audio quality for these types of earbuds, with ample bass and volume, plus decent clarity. They're good for making calls (they do a pretty good job reducing background noise reduction) and also offer strong battery life of up to 14 hours at moderate volume levels.\nSony Link Buds: The LinkBuds are, in a sense, Sony's answer to Apple's standard AirPods. While they don't sound as good as Sony's flagship WF-1000XM5 noise-isolating earbuds, they offer a discreet, innovative design and a more secure fit than the AirPods, as well as good sound and very good voice-calling performance.\nCleer Audio Arc 2 Sport: Cleer's original Arc earbuds were solid sport earbuds that featured decent sound for open-style buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. This new-for-2023 model steps up the sound quality and offers additional refinements and feature upgrades, including a new \"enhanced\" charging case with UV sterilization and multipoint Bluetooth connectivity (Bluetooth 5.3), all of which makes for a significantly improved product.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds Live: Samsung's bean-shaped earbuds were a hit when they came out in 2020, but they've become outdated. Like the standard AirPods, they have an open design, so you don't jam an ear tip into your ear. They're comfortable to wear and fit my ears more securely than the AirPods. These wireless buds are discreet and basically sit flush with your ear, which reduces wind-noise while biking. I regularly use them for running and biking, and they're great for sporting activities if they fit your ears well. But one warning: Some people won't get a secure fit, so buy them from a retailer that has a good return policy."

A lot has changed in the world since then and new competitors have arrived on the scene. But not much has changed about the way I feel about these earbuds. The AirPods Pro are Apple's first headphones to offer active noise cancellation, which electronically counteracts exterior noise like the hum of a jet engine or an air conditioner, and the company's first wireless model to feature a noise-isolating design -- with silicone ear tips that push into your ear canal. They remain a safe choice for Apple users looking for a compact, lightweight pair of true wireless earbuds that connect easily to their Apple devices and perform well -- both for music and movie listening as well as making voice calls.\nYes, they're a little overpriced. But the good news is we're seeing them regularly discounted by $25 to $35 at various online retailers. Also, Apple announced recently that this fall, with the release of iOS 14, they'll get automatic switching between Apple devices and a new spatial audio surround sound feature that takes advantage of some internal tech we didn't know the AirPods Pro had: Along with built-in accelerometers, it turns out they also have built-in gyroscopes. That will allow for head tracking, a feature usually found on higher-end gaming headphones, allowing the AirPods Pro the potential to create a more realistic surround-sound experience (I'm still waiting to try it out). The standard AirPods, which cost about $100 less, won't get the new virtual surround sound feature, though they will be upgraded with automatic switching.\nAfter living with the AirPods Pro for many months and comparing them to a slew of competitors, my conclusions remain largely the same. Here are some key takeaways.\nI'm one of those people whose ears aren't ideal receptacles for the original AirPods, which are now on their second generation. I can wear them, but they don't stay in my ears all that well. I feel them start to fall out if I do anything too strenuous in them, like dash across the street to make a light.\nWith the AirPods Pro, I don't have that problem. They fit my ears securely. I can run with them -- and they're sweat-proof, Apple says (they have an IPX4 water-resistance rating, which means they're splashproof but not waterproof). It's also worth noting that they come with small, medium and large ear tips. I was worried I'd need an extra-large tip to get a tight seal, but the AirPods Pro's large ear tips fit my ears fine. That said, in the last few months, I did upgrade the tips with CharJenPro foam tips ($18) specially made for the AirPods Pro that allowed me to get an even tighter seal and an even more secure (I found that one bud started to slip out of my ear on longer runs). Comply also makes $25 foam tips for the AirPods Pro and some cheaper foam tips are available for less than $15. However, I can't vouch for those, having only tried the CharJenPro and Comply tips.\nIf you're setting them up on an iOS device, in fact, the app will guide you through testing which ear tip fits you best. And Apple is selling its own replacement tips for just $4 (for a set of three pairs), so replacing them when they eventually get, well, gross is eminently affordable.\nThe long and short of it is the new design will fit more ears than the original AirPods. I hesitate to call it a universal fit because there are always exceptions, but they're close. The only issue is that some people simply don't like having silicone buds stuck in their ears, even if they're as soft and pliant as these tips are. That's the reason why so many people like the original AirPods. They just sort of nestle in your ear -- and when they fit right, they're really comfortable. However, a few of my coworkers said that even though the AirPods Pro sounded better, they still preferred the fit of the regular AirPods.\nAirPods Pro sound better than standard AirPods\nThe first thing you notice about the AirPods Pro is that they sound better than the standard AirPods because they have more bass. The reason they have more bass is largely due to their new noise-isolating design and new drivers that are tuned for that design. The standard AirPods sound decent enough in quiet places but due to their open design, they just don't do well when confronted with external noise (the bass frequencies get drowned out). The AirPods' noise cancellation, which is effective, also helps with external noise, and the combination of the seal of the tips and the active noise cancellation means they sound much better in noisier environments such as city streets.\nDon't get me wrong, I like the way the AirPods Pro sound. They're pleasant to listen to -- very good for true wireless. But they lack the clarity, definition and more textured sound one might expect from headphones that cost $250. In short, there are competing models that cost around the same price or less that sound as good or better. That doesn't mean those competing models are better overall -- there are other factors to consider -- but just understand that from a pure sound standpoint, there are superior options.\nI compared the AirPods Pro to its closest current competitor, the Sony WF-1000XM3, which also has adaptive noise-canceling features. The WF-1000XM3 sounds better -- its sound is bigger, smoother and more refined overall, and easier to listen to over longer listening sessions.\nThe Sony WF-1000XM3's noise-canceling mode is as effective as that of the AirPods Pro. And the Sony's battery life is rated a little higher (6 hours), possibly because they're larger. With active noise cancellation on, Apple says AirPods Pro will deliver up to 4.5 hours of listening. We were able to eke out 5 hours and 9 minutes in our battery test with music playing at 75% volume level (you can watch the test in our YouTube video). While more battery life would ideally be better, it isn't a big issue because the buds charge quickly in their case and a 5-minute charge via the Lightning port or a Qi wireless charging pad (yes, they feature wireless charging) will get you an hour of battery life. A USB-C to Lightning cable is included, but you'll need to supply an adapter or plug them into a USB-C laptop if you don't have a wireless charging pad.\nSince I wrote my initial review of the AirPods Pro, Sennheiser released its second-gen Momentum True Wireless 2 ($300), which has better sound than the AirPods Pro and equally effective noise-canceling. Several other compelling noise-canceling true wireless earbuds have hit the market, including the Technics EAH-AZ70W ($250), and more premium noise-canceling models will arrive before the year's end. Fit is a big factor when it comes to noise-isolating earphones: If you don't get a tight seal and good fit (with any of these models), the noise cancellation and sound quality both take a big hit. Some of these other earphones sound better, but it's hard to beat the AirPods Pro's lightweight design and comfortable fit.\nThe size and fit of the AirPods Pro are big selling points\nThe AirPods and their charging case are significantly smaller and lighter than the Sonys. The charging case is wider than the standard AirPods' case and a little thicker, but it's still a small package. And size matters when it comes to these types of earphones. The case and the AirPods are literally half the size of the Sonys. There's something appealing about that. Although the Sonys fit me well, the AirPods Pro seem more likely to fit more ears comfortably.\nSide note: You can wear the left and right earbuds independently of each other (that is, wear one bud at a time), and Apple's new Audio Sharing feature allows a friend with a compatible set of Apple or Beats headphones to connect to your iOS device to listen to the same content that you are.\nThese wireless earbuds are even better for making calls\nThe standard AirPods are quite good for making calls. With the release of the second-gen model this year -- some call them the AirPods 2 -- Apple improved their noise-reduction capabilities, particularly wind noise. The AirPods Pro have three microphones on each bud, one of which is a beamforming mic that's designed to pick up your voice. They also have similar noise-reduction capabilities, plus a vent system that's not only supposed to relieve some of the pressure that can build up in your ear from a noise-isolating design coupled with noise-canceling features, but can help cut down on wind noise a tad, an Apple rep told me. More importantly, you can simply hear callers better because of the Pros' noise-isolating design.\nCall quality has been the Sony WF-1000XM3's Achilles heel. It's gotten better with some firmware upgrades, but it should be even better -- it's not up to the AirPods Pro's standard. In terms of making calls, the AirPods are top-notch. But others are catching up. I tested these against the Anker Liberty Air 2 earbuds. The Ankers and their more expensive sibling, the Liberty 2 Pro, measured up well to the AirPods when it came to making calls. Like the AirPods Pro, the Liberty Air 2 earbuds do a good job of muffling ambient noise (callers said they could hear me fine even with a lot of street and even construction noise around me). They don't sound quite as good as the AirPods Pro, nor do they have active noise-canceling, but they fit comfortably and their noise-isolating design passively seals out a lot of ambient noise. They only cost $90.\nThe only thing the AirPods seem to be missing on the call front is a sidetone feature that allows you to hear your voice in the earphones when you're making a call. That allows you to modulate your voice accordingly and not talk too loudly. Amazon's Echo Buds ($130), also good for making calls, have this feature, and so do the pricier Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2, which are also good for making calls.\nThe AirPods Pro noise-canceling is good but has some limitations\nI've been getting a lot of questions from readers about just how good the AirPods Pro noise-canceling is and whether it's better than what you get from full-size headphones like the Sony WH-1000XM3 and Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 or Bose QuietComfort 35 II. I was generally impressed with AirPod Pro's noise cancellation. In open office environments and in other places, like a cafe where people are talking around you, I didn't think there was much of a difference when I switched between the AirPods Pro and those larger headphones. They all do a decent job, although you can still hear people's voices.\nI think the full-size headphones and even Sony's WF-1000XM3 do a better job muffling low frequencies. I haven't used the AirPods Pro on a plane yet, but I have a noisy HVAC unit in my apartment, and the Sony and\nBose\nfull-size headphones did a better job quieting its loud hum.\nAs far as airplane use goes, the AirPods Pro would certainly help with noise reduction, but just be aware there's no way to plug these into an in-flight entertainment system. You'd have to hook up a Bluetooth transceiver to the headphone jack. But the Pros will absolutely be better on a plane than standard AirPods, which are all but useless thanks to their open design.\nAlso, if you're sensitive to active noise cancellation, you may not be able to use these with it turned on. (There's no way to adjust it to a lower setting like there is with the Sony WF-1000XM3; it automatically adapts to your environment.) You can turn the setting off, however, and just live with the isolation delivered by the ear tips.\nEarlier this year, there was some controversy over whether one of Apple's firmware upgrades had downgraded the AirPods Pro's noise-canceling. Some users swore it did. Subsequently, Apple released another firmware update that some say fixed the problem and others say it didn't. I personally think it's as good as it was when the AirPods Pro launched. But I do have a tighter seal, thanks to using those foam tips I mentioned earlier.\nThe stems are shorter and I like the new controls better -- but there are no volume controls on the buds\nThe standard AirPods have touch controls. You tap or tap and hold a touch zone on the side of the bud. The AirPods Pro have a force sensor in the stem of each bud -- and the stems are shorter, which is good. You pinch the stem to activate the controls. Pinch twice quickly to advance a track forward. Press and hold to turn noise cancellation on or off or to toggle a transparency mode that allows sound to leak in (so you can hear train announcements, for example, or just talk to someone while you have your AirPods on).\nThe new controls take a little getting used to, especially if you're coming from the standard AirPods and like their controls. Apple says it moved to the force sensors in the stem because the noise-isolating design meant you could hear the tapping when you touched the buds, which irritated people. Some people might not be happy with that decision, but I was fine with the new control method. I had some mishaps at first but I'm doing better after a few days of use.\nYou can also program the press-and-hold function to call up\nSiri\nmanually if you don't want the always-on (hands-free) Siri feature to be active. Like the AirPods, the Pros have Apple's H1 chip that allows for always-on Siri, so you can call up Apple's voice assistant simply by saying \"Hey, Siri.\" That's how you adjust volume levels -- by telling Siri. Otherwise, you have to make volume adjustments on your device.\nWireless connectivity is rock solid\nEven with their easy pairing features, the original AirPods weren't immune to Bluetooth glitches and the occasional dropouts. I used my review sample with an iPhone 11 Pro running the latest version of iOS 13 (you have to have 13.2 or higher) and didn't have any real audio dropouts during my limited testing period. Audio syncing in video apps was also solid. There wasn't any lag that I saw, though I didn't try every video app.\nLike the AirPods, you can use the AirPods Pro with Android\nphones\n(I used them with a Galaxy 9 Plus). The auto Bluetooth pairing feature isn't available and the always-on Siri feature doesn't work. But they work like normal Bluetooth earphones and you can use your phone's voice assistant. The noise-canceling works the same as it does with an iOS device.\nI connected to a Mac without a problem but I haven't tried the AirPods Pro with a Windows machine yet.\nIt's worth spending $50 more on the AirPods Pro instead of the AirPods with Wireless Charging\nIf you like your current AirPods and they fit your ears well, you don't need to run out and buy the Pros. (I'd wait for your AirPods to die, which they will sooner rather than later if you use them a lot.) But if you've been eyeing the $199 AirPods with Wireless Charging, I'd pass them by and go straight to the Pros. The Pros have a wireless charging case too, and their superior sound and added features are worth the extra dough.\nThe big question is this: How low will the standard AirPods (without wireless charging) go? They list for $160 but they often cost less, and we've seen them for as low as $130. As their price creeps down, I'd say those are the AirPods to get if you don't want to spend too much money on AirPods. Forget the wireless charging. It's an overrated feature and should cost less.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro is in trouble\nMany people were looking for better sound and a more secure fit than the original AirPods and they could get both in the Beats Powerbeats Pro. Apple owns Beats, and the Powerbeats Pro earbuds have bigger bass than the standard AirPods. They also have more dynamic sound as well as long battery life in a sporty design. The Powerbeats Pro cost $250 but get discounted sporadically and should be available for $200 or less as we head into the holiday buying season.\nThe Powerbeats Pro earbuds are still impressive, but the big strike against them is their bulky charging case. With their sweat-resistant design, bolder sound and more secure fit, the AirPods Pro are a direct competitor. The smaller size and more discreet profile of the AirPods Pro makes them the more appealing choice than the Beats. I also think some people will prefer their sound to the Powerbeats Pro, which is more hyped in the treble (maybe a little too hyped for some).\nI'd only get the Powerbeats if I was worried about losing a bud doing an activity like mountain biking where there's a higher probability of one falling out of your ears. The Powerbeats Pro's ear hooks do help keep the earphones on your head.\nA bit pricey, but with a lot to like\nWith seemingly all of Apple's products, you have to separate the marketing hype from reality. This isn't the first in-ear true-wireless with noise-canceling. Sony's had earphones with the feature for around two years and several noise-canceling models are now available with more on the way, including inexpensive ones like the $60 Mpow X3 (their noise-canceling is only so-so but they do sound good and work well for making calls). The Jabra Elite 75t, Sony WF-1000XM3, Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus and plenty of others have such a \"hear-through\" feature. So when Apple says \"magic you've never heard\" and talks about a \"customizable fit\" because three different sized eartips are included, I kind of roll my eyes.\nBut even if they don't sound as magical as you'd hope a $250 model would, the AirPods Pro still manage to be a great pair of truly wireless earphones. That's largely due to their winning design and fit, improved bass performance, effective noise-canceling and excellent call quality. Yeah, they're expensive at $250, but the good news is you'll use them so much you'll probably wear the battery down -- it does degrade over time and isn't replaceable -- and have to buy a new pair in 18 to 24 months, if you don't lose them first.\nOriginally posted November 2019.

      "text": "Pros\n- Same excellent sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance\n- Powered by Apple's H2 chip\n- Charging case has U1 chip and built-in speaker for Find My\n- Well-designed controls and now dust-resistant\n- Top-notch transparency mode\n- Spatial Audio\n- Support for 20-bit/48 kHz Lossless Audio with Apple's Vision Pro headset\nCons\n- No support for high-resolution audio with other Apple devices except headset\n- Still no XL ear tips\nThe new-for-2023 AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe Charging Case (USB-C) are very similar to last year's Lightning model and cost the same ($249, \u00a3249, AU$399 list, with a street price closer to $200), but they're not identical. First, the new buds and charging case add increased dust-resistance (IP54 rating instead of IPX4). Second, in a pinch you can use your iPhone 15 to charge the USB-C AirPods with the included USB-C cable. And lastly and most interestingly, Apple has added support for 20-bit/48 kHz Lossless Audio with a \"massive reduction of latency\" for Apple's upcoming $3,499 Vision Pro headset (note that Apple Lossless Audio actually goes up to 24-bit/192 kHz). As part of that support, Apple has announced it's developed a \"groundbreaking wireless audio protocol,\" but some bloggers and YouTubers have noted that the AirPods Pro 2 feature a new \"acoustic architecture.\"\nIt's unclear whether that's a hardware change, a software change or both. Whatever the case -- and I'll discuss below whether I think the new buds sound any better -- the key thing to note is that the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) do offer some slight upgrades beyond their switch from Lightning to USB-C charging. Those upgrades aren't substantial enough to make anyone want to ditch their original AirPods Pro 2. But at least Apple has brought something intriguingly new to this iteration of AirPods, even if it's shrouded in a bit of mystery.\nRead more: Best Wireless Earbuds for 2022\nApple's shift to USB-C\nApple is gradually moving away from proprietary Lightning connectivity and charging in its devices. It started with newer iPads moving to USB-C and now the iPhone 15 models have swapped in USB-C for Lightning too. (The Apple-owned Beats brand blazed the trail here -- nearly all of its headphones now offer USB-C.) Presumably, all of Apple's accessories -- including eventual updates of other AirPods -- will also make the jump to USB-C.\nAs noted, from an external design standpoint, nothing except the charging port has changed with the new buds. They look and fit the same and come with the same four sizes of ear tips, including extra-small tips. However, there are no extra-large tips, which I would welcome. The buds now fit people will small ears better, but some people with larger ear canals may have to opt for a set of third-party foam tips to get not only a tight seal but a secure fit.\nIf you want more details on how the original Lightning AirPods Pro 2 differed from the original AirPods Pro, you can read our review of the original AirPods Pro 2, where I also offer in depth assessments of their performance and features. To be be clear, the new AirPods Pro 2 offer the same robust features geared toward Apple users, including spatial audio with head-tracking and automatic switching between Apple devices on your iCloud account (that feature has been slightly improved). Also, their performance for noise canceling and voice-calling is same -- it's excellent overall -- and so too is the battery life, which is rated at up to 6 hours with noise canceling on, with an extra four charges in the case.\nThe AirPods Pro 2 got some new features with the release of iOS 17 on Sept. 18, 2023. Among those free upgrades to both models of the AirPods Pro 2 are Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness and Personalized Volume. They're definitely nice improvements that enhance the functionality of the buds, and you should obviously try them out if you're an AirPods Pro 2 owner once you update to iOS 17. But as I tested out those new features with the \"new\" AirPods Pro 2, the biggest question I had was this: Do the USB-C AirPods Pro sound any better than the previous Lightning version?\nSound testing\nWhen the AirPods Pro 2 were first released in 2022, some people were hoping that they would be able to stream Apple Lossless tracks over wireless. They couldn't and neither can the new AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) -- at least not with any Apple devices currently on the market. Whether they'll be able to do it in the future with anything beyond the $3,499 Vision Pro headset is anybody's guess. But it appears that Apple is laying the groundwork for it with the new acoustic architecture.\nIn my attempts to ascertain whether there are any differences in sound quality, I paired both the old and new AirPods Pro 2 to my iPhone 14 Pro and swapped them in and out of my ears, using the same large ear tips on both buds. (Initially, the buds were running different firmware, but in subsequent tests they both were running the latest AirPods Pro 2 firmware.) I also did some listening tests using an iPhone 15.\nI did my best to set the buds for the same volume level, left noise canceling turned on and didn't engage any other features, including spatial audio. I then listened to a handful of tracks over and over, including Spoon's Knock Knock Knock, Imagine Dragons' Monday, Florence and The Machine's Choreomania and Ed Sheeran's Shivers, on both Apple Music and Qobuz, which does offer hi-res tracks for devices that support hi-res wireless streaming via audio codecs like LDAC.\nThe average listener will be hard-pressed to notice a difference in sound quality between the old and new AirPods Pro 2. They both sound excellent for how lightweight they are, which is partially why we gave the original AirPods Pro 2 a CNET Editors' Choice award last year. But I also came away from my testing feeling that the two earbuds don't sound exactly the same, and that maybe, just maybe, the new USB-C AirPods Pro 2 sound a tiny bit more refined with ever so slightly cleaner sound.\nMy only problem is that I'm dealing with is a little inherent bias. Ever since I learned there was some change to the acoustic architecture, I haven't been able to firmly believe the two buds sound exactly the same. So I could be wrong; my mind could be playing tricks on me. But after some additional testing, my gut and ears say there is a very small difference.\nWhy would Apple not say they sound better than the originals if they do? Well, sometimes Apple likes to keep things a little vague and mysterious and doesn't reveal everything about a product until months after it launches. Case in point: We only learned last summer that the AirPods Pro 2 would be getting Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness and Personalized Volume -- all of which are now available via that iOS 17 update.\nApple AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) final thoughts\nAs noted in the intro, there isn't a truly compelling reason to buy these new USB-C AirPods Pro 2 if you already own the originals -- unless, of course, you bought an iPhone 15 and simply don't want to deal with a Lightning cable. (Of course, both the iPhone 15 and AirPods Pro 2 charge wirelessly if you want to go that charging route.)\nBut for Apple users anyway, the AirPods Pro 2 remain hard to beat if you're looking for a new pair of noise-canceling earbuds. When the first AirPods Pro came out around four years ago, it was really their compact size, comfortable fit and Apple-only features like auto switching between all the devices on your iCloud account that were their big selling points. That's all here still -- and more -- but now the sound and noise canceling, which were good but not great before, compete favorably against top earbuds like the Sony WF-1000XM5 and Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds that cost even more. (You can typically find the AirPods Pro 2 for around $200 or $50 less than their list price.)\nAnd while the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) may not sound quiet as good as the Sony WF-1000XM5s -- or they don't muffle noise quite as well as the Bose QC Ultra Earbuds -- they're close and also have top-notch voice-calling capabilities along with an excellent feature set. Alas, Android users don't get access to the full suite of features, but I do know some folks who use the AirPods Pro 2 with their Android smartphones because they say they can't find earbuds that offer better voice-calling performance.\nIn the final analysis, the AirPods Pro 2 may not be the best at everything, but they do everything very well and are also lightweight and fit most people's ears comfortably and securely. And that's why they remain one of our CNET Editors' Choice award winners in the headphones category."

      "text": "Pros\n- Relatively inexpensive\n- Very good sound and overall performance for their price\n- Decent noise canceling\n- Support for AAC, AptX and LDAC audio codecs\n- Robust feature set (wireless charging, ear-detection sensors)\nCons\n- Touch controls and voice-calling performance could be slightly better\nIf you've ever searched for a new pair of earbuds on Amazon, you've probably noticed that there are a plenty of budget-priced models to choose from. While their performance is somewhat hit or miss, you can now find surprisingly decent buds that cost a whole let less than premium buds from Apple, Samsung, Bose, Sony and others.\nAmong the best of these \"cheap\" models is the Earfun Air Pro 4, which sell for a little more than $60 when you clip the instant coupon code on their Amazon product page and apply the code EAP4CNET at checkout to get an extra 10% off. Not only do they perform better than you'd expect for their relatively modest price, but they have a robust feature set, which is why they've been awarded a CNET Editors' Choice in 2024.\nRead more: Best budget earbuds for 2024\nThe Air Pro 4 aren't a major upgrade over the earlier Air Pro 3s, but they do have a few enhancements that make them slightly better earbuds. Earfun has moved from Qualcomm's QCC3071 to the newer QCC3091, which supports aptX Lossless Audio for a select few Android devices. The buds also support Sony's LDAC audio codec, which is available with more Android smartphones, and the AAC and SBC codecs (iPhones support AAC).\nLike their predecessor, the Air Pro 4s are lightweight and comfortable to wear -- I got a good seal with the largest ear tip size -- and they feature slightly improved noise canceling and sound quality along with better battery life (up to 11 hours with noise canceling off and 7.5 hours with it on, according to Earfun). While the default sound leans slightly warm with a touch of bass push, you can tweak the sound in Earfun's companion app for iOS and Android. I do think the sound measures up well to earbuds that cost twice as much.\nAs I said, these aren't a big upgrade over the Air Pro 3, but once again Earfun has delivered a set of earbuds that deliver strong performance for their modest price. They also pack in a lot of features, including a wireless charging case, multipoint Bluetooth pairing (they're equipped with Bluetooth 5.4 and LE Audio) and ear-detection sensors that pause your music when you pull a bud out of your ear and resume playback when when you put it back in. The latter feature isn't typically found in cheaper earbuds.\nThe voice-calling performance is slightly improved from their predecessor, but it's not as good as what you get with higher-end earbuds like Apple's AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2, as well as Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. The background noise reduction is solid, even in noisy environments, but there were times when callers said my voice warbled a bit and they could tell I was outside. Another small gripe: I thought their touch controls could work a little better than they do.\nAside from that, I didn't have much to complain about. No, these buds won't necessarily blow you away with their sound quality (they lack that extra bit of depth a refinement of higher-end buds). And their noise canceling and transparency falls short of what you get with flagship noise-canceling earbuds from Apple, Sony and Bose. But the point is they're not a big step behind those premium buds for both sound and noise canceling; the gap is smaller than their price would indicate.\nIn many ways, these have a lot in common with Anker's Soundcore budget earbuds, including its P40i buds ($60), and for all I know, all these buds could be made in the same factory in China. I do like those Soundcore P40i buds (that their case turns into a phone stand is a nice bonus), but the Earfun Air Pro 4 have a little more robust feature set and are slightly better overall."

      "text": "While clip-on earbuds were kicking around the Asian markets well before Bose released its $300 Ultra Open Earbuds last year, it was Bose's innovative design and marketing that brought this new style of earrings-like open earbuds to a worldwide audience and spurred others to release clip-on designs to the U.S market. Now Shokz, known for its bone-conduction headphones, has joined the growing clip-on crowd with its OpenDots One ($200), a more premium model that looks and feels similar to the Ultra Open Earbuds but lists for $100 less.\nI've been testing the OpenDots One for a couple of days, comparing them to the Ultra Open Earbuds along with some budget clip-on buds that cost as low as $50. Here are my initial thoughts on the OpenDots One. Note that they do not use bone-conduction technology.\nRead more: Best clip-on earbuds of 2025\nDesign\nFrom a design standpoint, the Shokz OpenDots One measure up quite well to the Bose Ultra Earbuds. They fit my ears as well and maybe even slightly better than the Bose buds, which are quite comfortable. Like the Bose, they have a flexible connector that Shokz refers to as a JointArc and says \"provides a gentle yet secure grip on various ear shapes\" while noting that \"soft silicone strategically placed on the exterior of the speaker further minimizes pressure, even during extended wear.\"\nAs with all clip-on buds, the OpenDots One, as their name implies, feature an open design. That means the bud and driver sit over your ear canal and aren't jammed in it like noise-isolating ear buds with silicone or foam tips. Open buds allow for sound to leak into your ears and are good for those who don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears or want to hear the outside world around them for safety reasons. Shokz specializes in headphones and earbuds that are well suited for sporting activities and like its bone-conduction headphones, the OpenDots One offer a secure fit and work well for runners. They have an IP54 rating, which means they'll provide protection from \"light rain and sweat\" and are also dust-resistant.\nThe touch controls take some trial and error to get used to. You can either tap the battery compartment or JointArc or \"pinch\" the battery with two fingers to control playback and answer/end calls. You can set the long tap and hold gesture to either adjust volume, activate your voice assistant or advance tracks forward and back. I prefer the Bose's physical control button on its battery, which is also shaped like a barrel, but the OpenDots touch controls were fine.\nShokz OpenDots One Sound Quality\nShokz says the OpenDots One feature its Bassphere technology that \"combines dual 11.8 mm drivers in a spherical module to replicate the performance of a 16mm driver.\" They also feature Dolby Audio and Shokz' DirectPitch technology, which minimizes sound leakage so people near you can't hear what you're listening to (or hear it very faintly anyway). You have to engage Dolby Audio in the Shokz App for iOS and Android and it does open the sound a bit and everything sound a tad fuller. It's simply some form of digital processing and it's unclear whether it impacts battery life but you can hear a difference when engaging it.\nThe sound of all clip-on buds changes slightly with how you position the buds on your ears (you can slide the bud up or down a bit to find the most comfortable fit but the positioning may impact sound quality). They also face some bass challenges because of their open design and tend to not sound as good as noise-isolating earbuds.\nThat's the case here as well, although the OpenDots are among the best-sounding clip-on buds I've tested, which should be expected given their high price. That said, their sound falls a little short of the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds' sound quality, even with Dolby Audio engaged. The Bose buds sound a little more open with a tad more bass and their tonal balance is slightly better (they sound more natural and accurate overall). It's a relatively subtle difference but it is noticeable.\nThe main issue with cheaper clip-on earbuds is that they tend to distort a bit at higher volumes. The OpenDots One mainly manage to avoid distorting when you push up the volume. They play loud but not super-loud.\nShokz OpenDots One Voice-calling performance\nShokz headphones and earbuds tend to have good voice-calling performance and while the OpenDots One aren't bad in the voice-calling department, callers did say they heard a fair amount of background noise when I used them on the noisy streets of New York.\nAt launch, the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds also weren't great performers for voice calling with similar issues with background noise reduction. But Bose has subsequently improved the noise reduction with a firmware update (Bose also added multipoint Bluetooth pairing with the same firmware update). And while the Ultra Open Earbuds still aren't top-notch for voice-calling, they're now above average.\nShokz OpenDots One extra features and battery life\nThe OpenDots One have \"Dynamic Ear Detection\" that allows the earbuds to automatically recognize which bud is in which ear, so no left or right markers are needed. But otherwise their feature set is fairly basic. They do link with the Shokz App for iOS and Android, which \"enables multipoint pairing between two devices, 4 pre-set EQ modes plus two personalized EQ, Find My Earbuds and more.\"\nThe Bose Ultra Open feature Bose's Immersive Audio for music spatialization. That's the same feature found in the QC Ultra Earbuds and QC Ultra Headphones. As with those models, these buds have head-tracking, so you can set the Immersive Audio for Still mode that fixes the sound or Motion Mode that follows your head movements. Engaging it does enhance the sound a bit from standard stereo mode but I think it makes a more pronounced difference with the QuietComfort models. Also, engaging it does reduce battery life.\nThe Ultra Open Earbuds are rated for up to 7.5 hours at moderate volume levels but that number drops to about 4.5 hours with Immersive Audio on. The charging case provides an additional 19.5 hours of battery and has a quick-charge feature but no wireless charging option.\nIn contrast, the OpenDots One are rated for up to 10 hours of use on on a single charge, with an additional 30 hours of battery in the charging case, which does feature wireless charging. So the Shokz definitely have an advantage there.\nShokz OpenDots One final initial thoughts\nThe well-designed OpenDots One are among the best open earbuds out there right now and certainly have a place on our list of best clip-on earbuds. While they don't sound quite as good as the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, they're pretty close and fit my ears slightly better and have better battery life. Like the Ultra Open Earbuds, which list for $299 but are currently on sale for $249, they're overpriced, but at least they cost less than the Bose and their case does have wireless charging.\nMore affordable clip-on earbuds like the Baseus Bowie MC1 (about $50) or Tozo OpenEarRing ($30), don't sound as good or feature as premium a design. But because these types of clip-on open buds are more for casual listening, not critical listening and just don't produce the greatest sound, it's harder to justify spending big bucks on them. In other words, the OpenDots are clearly superior to those budget models but not $150 better.\nShokz OpenDots One key specs:\n- Weight: 6.5 grams per bud\n- IP54 splash-proof and dust-resistant\n- 11.8 mm drivers\n- Bluetooth: 5.4\n- Dolby Audio\n- Touch controls\n- Battery life: Up to 10 hours on a single charge and up to 40 hours with the charging case\n- 10-minute quick charge provides 2 hours of playtime\n- Multipoint Bluetooth pairing\n- Wireless charging supported\n- Customize EQ modes and touch controls in Shokz App for iOS and Android\n- Locate your earbuds feature\n- Colors: Black or gray\n- Price: $200"

      "text": "Pros\n- Excellent sound and best-in-class noise canceling\n- Fit Kit ear tips and stabilizer system gets you a secure, comfortable fit\n- Immersive Audio creates a different listening experience\n- Slightly improved voice-calling\nCons\n- No wireless charging or multipoint Bluetooth\n- Immersive Audio mode hurts battery life\nNot many people expected Bose to release a new set of $299 flagship noise-canceling earbuds only a year after launching its excellent QuietComfort Earbuds 2, which we awarded a CNET Editors' Choice. But that's what it's done with the new-for-2023 QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, surely upsetting some QC Earbuds 2 owners while perhaps delighting other folks who were on the verge of buying the QC Earbuds 2 but held off, hoping for something a little better. And that's exactly what Bose has given us -- something a little better -- which makes the QC Ultra Earbuds a tad tricky to review.\nRead more: Best wireless earbuds of 2023\nThat's because whenever a company releases new earbuds, like the QC Ultra Earbuds, that aren't a major upgrade, one has the tendency to be a little disappointed. These new buds offer some small design refinements, including a new \"metallic treatment,\" but they look the same as the QC Earbuds 2 while featuring an \"improved interlocking fit\" with slightly upgraded stability bands (there's a notch in them that prevents them from moving). They're also IPX4 splash-proof.\nI really liked the fit of the QC Earbuds 2 -- they fit not only very comfortably but also very securely thanks to Bose's Fit Kit ear tips and stabilizer system -- so I'm just fine with the QC Ultra Earbuds' design, despite the fact that they're larger than some buds, including the AirPods Pro 2.\nThe new buds still don't come with a wireless charging case, though you can soon buy a new wireless charging case cover that's compatible with both the QC Earbuds 2 and QC Earbuds Ultra for $50. Personally, I don't care that much about wireless charging for headphones, but it should be included at this price for people who do care about it.\nUpgrades on the inside\nMost of the changes are under the hood. The buds use the same Qualcomm 5-series chip as their predecessor. But they have some additional chips to facilitate Bose's new proprietary spatial audio feature, which the company calls Immersive Audio and says is designed to \"enhance and add depth to your content.\" Most notably there's a new IMU chip (gyroscope with an accelerometer) that enables head-tracking technology.\nBose says that both the QC Ultra Earbuds and QC Ultra Headphones feature the Snapdragon Sound Technology Suite, enabling support for the latest Qualcomm aptX Adaptive codec for audio streaming, including lossless and low latency capabilities (Google Fast Pair is on board as well). The only problem is that it appears you may need to have a Qualcomm Snapdragon Sound-enabled device to use the aptX audio codec.\nI paired the buds with a Google Pixel 7, which supports aptX audio, but it defaulted to the AAC audio code for HD Audio (iPhones use AAC) even after I accessed developer mode. When I paired them with a Samsung Galaxy Flip 5, which is supposed to be Snapdragon Sound-enabled, the same thing happened. However, when I connected them to an Asus ROG Phone 6, another Snapdragon-enabeld phone, I was able use aptX Adaptive.\nI'm not sure what's going on, but it's pretty irritating and is clearly confusing consumers interested in so-called higher bandwidth audio codecs. I personally prefer Sony's LDAC audio codec to aptX, but it's all pretty subjective when it comes to audio codecs, and most people will have a hard time noticing a difference in sound quality.\nBut I digress. Back to Immersive Audio. Like other headphones that feature spatial audio with head-tracking -- Apple's latest AirPods, for instance -- the QC Ultra Earbuds have two spatial audio modes: one \"still\" mode, without head-tracking engaged, and a \"motion\" mode that uses head-tracking and allows the audio to \"move with you, so it's always in front of you.\" The same Immersive Audio features are also available in Bose's new over-ear QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. Note that engaging it does impact battery life. You go from around six hours of battery life with ANC on at moderate volume levels (75 decibels) to about four hours with ANC on and Immersive Audio engaged.\nThe new Immersive Audio feature is really the biggest change, along with some voice-calling performance enhancements that in our real-world testing seemed subtle. \"With the support of dynamic microphone mixing and adaptive filters, voice pickup is more intelligible in less-than-ideal environments,\" Bose says. More on that in a minute.\nBose QC Ultra Earbuds sound quality changes\nWhen Apple released its spatial for the AirPods, the emphasis was on what it did for audio while you were watching movies, as it created a sort of faux surround sound mode. The music side of spatial audio was initially less hyped, but in its Apple Music catalog Apple did point users toward \"Made for Spatial Audio\" tracks that featured Dolby Atmos mixes. Over time, the number of those tracks has grown.\nIn contrast, Bose is pretty much exclusively touting its Immersive Audio feature as it pertains to music listening. It will work with any stereo tracks, including movie soundtracks, but it appears to be geared more toward music listening with no mention of Dolby Atmos mixes.\nBose says Immersive Audio \"goes beyond special effects and creates a wider, more spacious soundstage so your content becomes multi-dimensional and layered, regardless of the audio platform or device.\"\nI think it mostly lives up to its billing, though it can be a bit hit or miss, working better with some tracks than others. Also, the sound does shift slightly when you move your head, even when you're in \"still\" mode. Some people will like that, but others may not.\nOn most tracks, there's a noticeable difference in sound quality with Immersive Audio engaged (as I said, you can debate how much better it is with different tracks). For example, I listened to Diddy's Another One of Me track and the sound was clearly more open (and more out of my head) with Immersive Audio on. With it off, the sound came across as slightly recessed. I should note that I did think the Apple Music Made for Spatial Audio version sounded slightly bolder and punchier than the Spotify version, so sound quality will vary according to your music source (I also use Qobuz for testing).\nIt's also worth noting that Bose appears to have ever so slightly improved the overall sound quality of the buds through some digital processing upgrades. Compared with the QC Earbuds 2, they seem to have a touch more clarity and bass definition. Sony's WF-1000XM5 earbuds may be a tad more revealing, but these QC Ultra Earbuds are in the same league for sound quality. They're excellent overall, and you can tweak their sound profile via an equalizer in the Bose Music companion app for iOS or Android.\nVoice-calling performance gets a slight boost\nIn my tests, the voice-calling performance has improved a bit from the QC Earbuds 2, but the buds still let in more background noise than competing models like the AirPods Pro 2. They do very well in less noisy environments, but in my torture tests in the clamorous streets of New York City, callers said they heard a good amount of background noise. My voice came through sounding fairly clear, but it did compete with that background noise.\nBose hasn't upgraded or moved the microphones. Any performance gains are due to tweaking software algorithms to try to better filter out ambient noise (that includes wind noise) while the microphones pick up your voice better. It's tricky. And while the buds rank in the \"good\" range for call quality, they're not in the upper echelon when it comes to making calls in noisier environments -- at least judging from my tests using an iPhone 14 Pro on the Verizon network.\nSince these small gains are made through updated software algorithms, you'd think that the QC Earbuds 2 could get the same updates to improve its voice-calling performance, but Bose wasn't able to confirm for me whether that would happen.\nBose QC Ultra Earbuds final thoughts\nLike I said in the intro, the QC Ultra Earbuds aren't a major upgrade over the QC Earbuds 2, so if you already own the QC Earbuds 2, I wouldn't bother upgrading. That said, the QC Ultra Earbuds are definitely a little better -- I'd say about 15% better. They should fit most ears very well, and they feature superb noise canceling, arguably the best out there. And a natural-sounding transparency mode with a new ActiveSense feature kicks in some ANC should the sound get too loud around you (it's sort of similar to the AirPods Pro's Adaptive Audio feature). They also sound slightly better overall, with a touch more clarity, and the Immersive Audio feature noticeably opens up the sound a bit.\nThey still lack multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and wireless charging can be added only with an optional $50 accessory. But those gripes aside (hopefully multipoint and better support for aptX will happen at some point with a firmware upgrade), the QC Ultra Earbuds are among the very top true-wireless earbuds on the market, and they're worthy competitors to both Apple's AirPods Pro 2 and Sony's WF-1000XM5 earbuds."

      "text": "When Shokz released its OpenFit earbuds in 2023, they got a lot of attention because they were the company's first true-wireless earbuds and its first headphones to use standard speaker technology instead of its signature bone-conduction technology. They were generally well received, but they didn't fit everyone's ears equally well.\nNow at CES 2025, Shokz has released the second-gen OpenFit 2 with a slightly upgraded design, upgraded drivers that noticeably improve the sound quality, better battery life and a new physical control button. They're available today in black or beige for $180 in the US, the same price as the original OpenFit buds.\nRead more: Best open earbuds of 2025\nI got a chance to try the OpenFit 2 ahead of their launch. While I haven't fully tested them yet, my early impressions are quite positive. The changes don't seem huge on the surface, but the improvements are significant. They fit my ears more comfortably than the originals and have superior sound quality with more bass and better clarity.\nThe sound quality is excellent for open-ear style earbuds. While it still can't quite match the sound quality of top noise-isolating earbuds in this price range, it approaches it -- at least when you listen to the buds in quieter environments.\nAt 9.4 grams, the new buds weigh about a gram more than the originals, but they're still lightweight and have one of the best ear-hook designs I've tried. Those ear hooks have been improved with upgraded flexible nickel-titanium alloy that \"molds to the contour of your ears\" and Shokz' Ultra-Soft Silicone 2.0. Just as importantly, Shokz has slightly altered the wearing curve of the ear hook to improve its ergonomics.\nBattery life has been significantly boosted, from up to seven hours on a single charge to up to 11 hours. Shokz has also added a physical control button to go along with the touch controls. That physical button was a big request from people who used the OpenFit buds, who didn't want to fiddle with touch controls while running or doing other sporting activities.\nOne of the big issues with bone-conduction headphones technology is that it just doesn't work all that well for music listening because bone-conduction headphones can't deliver truly full sound with enough bass. Despite this, Shokz has done its best to improve performance on the low end. In moving to this type of open design with more traditional speaker technology, albeit the kind that Shokz says is patented, you'll now get a much less compromised listening experience.\nShokz says the OpenFit 2 uses its new DirectPitch 2.0 technology along with Shokz OpenBass 2.0, the company's proprietary low-frequency enhancement algorithm.\nThe OpenFit 2 has a larger 21x11mm driver than original OpenFit, which has a 18x11mm driver. The driver has two individual speakers: a low-frequency driver for bass and a high-frequency driver for mids and highs. As I said, the earbuds deliver more bass and offer better overall clarity with less distortion than the original OpenFit Buds.\nThe call quality of the original OpenFit buds was good, and in my limited test calls the OpenFit 2, callers said they could hear me clearly with minimal background. I need to do more testing in this area, but my initial impression is that the OpenFit 2 has similar voice-calling performance to the OpenFit.\nI'll be posting a full review in the coming weeks that includes comparisons to Shokz' OpenFit Air buds ($120), which don't have quite as good sound quality but are less expensive and offer a very comfortable fit.\nShokz OpenFit 2 key specs\n- Ear hooks wearing curve changed slightly for more ergonomic fit and wrapped in upgraded silicone\n- 21x11mm upgraded drivers with two individual speakers in each earbud\n- OpenBass 2.0\n- DirectPitch 2.0 technology\n- Bluetooth 5.4\n- Battery life: Up to 11 hours of listening time on a single charge and three extra charges in charging case (48 hours total)\n- Quick charge: 10 minutes' charging provides two hours of listening time\n- Weight: 9.4 grams per earbud (charging case weighs 51 grams)\n- IP rating: IP55 water-resistant (charging case is not waterproof)\n- AI call-noise reduction\n- Physical control button and integrated touchpads\n- Multipoint Bluetooth pairing\n- FindMy Earbuds feature\n- Four preset EQ modes and two customizable EQ modes via Shokz app\n- Available in beige and black for $180 at Shokz.com and Amazon\nFor more CES coverage, take a look at the official 2025 Best of CES winners, selected by CNET."

      "text": "Pros\n- Smaller design\n- Improved sound and noise-canceling\n- New, more powerful Tensor A1 chip\n- Excellent battery life\n- Good voice-calling performance\n- Hands-free Google Assistant for Android users\n- Spatial audio\nCons\n- Ear tips may not allow some people to get a tight seal\n- No support for AptX or LDAC audio codecs for Android users\n- A few features not available for Apple users\nHow you feel about Google's new Pixel Buds Pro 2 will largely depend on how well they fit your ears. That's the case for most in-ear noise-canceling buds, of course, but with the Pixel Buds Pro 2, if you don't get a tight seal from the included ear tips, there's a massive dip in both sound quality and noise-canceling performance. If you do get a tight seal, these buds deliver excellent sound, strong noise-muffling capabilities and a robust feature set, particularly for Android and Google Pixel phone users.\nNot only are the Pixel Buds Pro 2 smaller than their predecessor but Google's equipped them with its new Tensor A1 chip, which offers more processing power and enables its new \"hands-free, eyes-free\" Gemini virtual AI assistant. One thing Google didn't improve, is the price.\nAvailable in four color options to match the colors of the new Pixel 9 models, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 list for $229 or $29 more than the original Pixel Buds Pro. That's a trend in the true-wireless earbuds market as various companies' flagship buds, like Samsung's new Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, have gone up in price by $20 to $50 as they move to the next generation.\nRead more: Best wireless earbuds of 2024\nPixel Buds Pro 2 design\nI'll get to the changes on the inside in a minute, but the biggest difference between these buds and the original Pixel Buds Pro is their design. The originals fit my ears well, but they didn't quite work for a certain percentage of people, and Google has made them 27% smaller and 24% lighter, which you notice right away.\nThey also have a built-in fin which Google calls a \"twist-to-adjust stabilizer.\" That fin helps lock the buds in your ears, and I was able to get a secure fit when I tried them on and shook my head around. Also, the buds don't stick out of your ears much, which is nice. For better or worse, they still look a little like you've jammed Mentos candies in your ears.\nI ran into a problem with the ear tips. I liked the smaller size of the buds, but it did really change the fit for my ears. With the original Pixel Buds, the largest size of Google's ear tips created a tight seal. That was not the case with the Pixel Buds Pro 2. The same large ear tips didn't fit quite snugly in my ears, failing to completely block off my ear canal. That led to an underwhelming sound and noise-canceling experience and a search for a new set of tips that would get me a tight seal. Luckily, I have the luxury of having a lot of ear tips on hand because of all the earbuds I review.\nSometimes, the shape of the ear tip is a factor in getting a tight seal. The ones that come with the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are slightly conical (wider, more rounded tips tend to work better for me). I have no doubt that one of the included sizes of ear tips will fit most people just fine. However, there will be some folks like me who require a different, most likely larger ear tip to get a tight seal. Once I found such an ear tip, the difference was night and day. Not only did I get a tight seal, but the earbuds fit my ears even more securely; they really felt locked in, and I had no trouble running with them.\nThe buds have an IP54 rating, which means they're splashproof and dust-resistant. Their case -- it's the same size as the original Pixel Buds Pro's case -- is also splashproof and has an IPX4 rating. The one design change to the case is the addition of a little speaker next to the USB-C charging port (more on that in a minute).\nI didn't note this in my review of the original Pixel Buds Pro, but my one gripe about the case is that it picks up stains from objects in your pocket. You can wipe those stains off with an alcohol wipe without a problem, it can initially be a little concerning when your pristine white case gets marked up. If you want to avoid any of these issues, you can buy a case for your Pixel Buds Pro's case.\nThe Pixel Buds Pro 2 have the same capacitive touch controls with swipe volume controls as the original Pixel Buds Pro, so there are no changes there. I found them responsive and easy to use.\nUpgraded sound quality and noise canceling\nGoogle says the buds, equipped with Bluetooth 5.4, have better sound and noise cancellation, along with improved voice-calling performance and noise reduction during calls. I did notice a significant upgrade in sound quality and noise-canceling performance, and the upgrades in voice-calling performance are more nuanced.\nGoogle's new Tensor A1 chip and updated algorithms make a lot of the performance upgrades possible. There's also a hardware upgrade that's seemingly a big factor in the sound quality improvements. These have 11mm drivers like the originals, Google says there's an upgraded acoustic architecture with a new high-frequency chamber for smoother treble.\nThe added detail is what jumped out at me. Compared to the original Pixel Buds Pro, there's more depth and richness to the sound with better overall definition and extension. The earbuds sound more accurate (natural) and the sound doesn't get stuck inside your head, which is another way of saying they have an amply wide soundstage.\nI listened to a wide variety of music tracks, and came away feeling the sound measures up well to what you get with most of the top earbuds out there, including the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, which have their own driver and processor upgrades. The Pixel Buds Pro 2's bass is powerful without sounding boomy, there's good stereo separation (you can distinctly hear each instrument in more complicated tracks) and a nice clarity to the treble. I didn't experience any listening fatigue either.\nSpatial audio with head tracking returns too, but note that it only works with the Pixel Tablet and the latest Pixel phones, starting with the Pixel 6 -- and not Pixel A-Series phones.\nFor Android users who want to tweak the sound, you get some preset EQ settings along with a full customizable EQ options to adjust the sound profile a bit. I mainly kept the EQ at the default setting because it sounded fine to me.\nYou get three microphones in each earbud with some mesh covering that helps cut down on wind noise. Google says the Pixel Buds Pro 2's upgraded adaptive noise canceling is twice what it was and covers a wider range of frequencies than that of the original Pixel Buds Pro. Again, how tight a seal you get will dramatically impact noise-canceling performance. When I got a tight seal, I was impressed with the noise-canceling performance. Riding the New York City subway and walking the streets of New York, I thought the noise-canceling worked as well as the AirPods Pro 2's noise canceling. It really cut down on a lot of unwanted noise and not only lower-frequency noise but some in the midrange (people's voices) and higher-frequencies, which are harder to suppress.\nI also thought the transparency mode, which lets ambient sound into the buds, sounded quite natural with virtually no audible hiss. It seemed very good.\nPixel Buds Pro 2 voice-calling performance evaluation\nI thought the voice-calling performance of the original Pixel Buds Pro was pretty good and the voice-calling performance of the Pixel Buds Pro 2 is a little better, though maybe not quite as good as what you get with Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. In my test calls in the noisy streets of New York, the buds generally did a good job eliminating background noise while picking up my voice well (Google markets the buds' voice-calling prowess as \"Clear Calling\"). Callers said my voice sounded slightly clearer with the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, and they said they heard a touch less background noise.\nPerformance does seem to improve a bit when using a Pixel phone and Clear Calling is activated in the settings. \"When a Pixel user with a Pixel 7 or later makes a phone call, the incoming audio (from the other person) is denoised and enhanced by Clear Calling on the phone,\" Google says. \"If the same user is also using Pixel Buds Pro 2, then the outgoing audio (Pixel user's speech) is also denoised and enhanced by algorithms on the buds. This means that, when used together, you get a fully denoised and speech-enhanced audio experience.\"\nStem-style earbuds like the AirPods Pro 2 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, which allow the buds' microphones to be aimed and positioned a little closer to your mouth, tend to deliver slightly better voice-calling performance. As Google tinkers with its algorithms, I suspect the Pixel Buds Pro 2's voice-calling performance may improve slightly. For now it seems quite good, but not best-in-class.\nRobust feature set, strong battery life\nAs you should expect from earbuds in this price range, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 have ear-detection sensors, which means your music will pause when you take the buds out of your ears and resume playback when you put them back in. There's multipoint Bluetooth pairing and automatic switching between Android devices on your Google account. Also, the buds support the new Find My Device network and have a little speaker on the bottom of their charging case next to the USB-C port that emits a ringtone to help you find the case if it's hiding somewhere.\nLike the previous model, the case has wireless charging, and the rated battery life for these buds is quite good -- Google says you can get up to 12 hours with noise canceling off at moderate levels and up to 8 hours with noise canceling on.\nA key feature worth mentioning is Conversation Detect (you have to activate it in the settings), which Google says uses AI to tell when you start speaking and will pause the audio and switch the buds to transparency mode so you can have a conversation. Your music and noise canceling will then kick back on when the conversation ends. Sony was the first to have this feature, and Apple's AirPods Pro 2 and Samsung's Galaxy Buds Pro 2 and 3 also have a variation of it.\nLike their predecessor, these have hands-free Google Assistant, which you can access by saying \"Hey, Google\" or \"OK, Google\" without touching your buds. The buds can also be used to access its new Gemini Live AI feature by saying \"Let's talk\" after saying the assistant wake command. I'm still testing this feature, and so far, it's been a little inconsistent, but it gives the Google Assistant experience a more conversational, interactive feel and allows you to get advanced search results read back to you through the buds.\nOnce again, Google has stuck with AAC and SBC has the two audio codecs supported. Some folks were disappointed that the original Pixel Buds Pro didn't support LDAC or AptX. Honestly, the lack of additional codec support shouldn't be a dealbreaker. It's hard to tell the difference between AAC and AptX (or LDAC) even if you have a music streaming service like Qobuz or Tidal that offers high-resolution audio.\nGoogle Pixel Buds Pro 2 final thoughts\nIt's a little disappointing that the Pixel Buds Pro 2 cost $29 more than than their predecessor, but, as I said, we're seeing that same price inflation with other recent flagship earbuds like Sony's WF-1000XM5 and Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. Apple has priced its AirPods Pro at $249 for a while, though the AirPods Pro 2 do sell for closer to $180 at Amazon.\nI appreciate the smaller design, an upgrade that should address the fit issues many folks with smaller ears had with the original Buds Pro's design. These more compact buds might not fit some ears as well as the originals. In my case, I was able to resolve my fit issue with different ear tips. I wouldn't fault buyers for returning the buds if they fail to get a perfect fit and don't want to go to the trouble of searching for a more suitable pair of ear tips for their ears. It's a shame more earbuds manufacturers don't include a wider range of ear tips with their buds (I'm still waiting for Apple to include a pair of XL tips with the AirPods Pro 2).\nIf you can get a tight seal, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are excellent earbuds. Apple users are better off with the AirPods Pro 2, and Samsung Galaxy device owners should probably opt for the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. Despite their higher price, they're certainly worth strong consideration from Pixel device users and Android users in general, particularly when they're discounted.\nPixel Buds Pro key specs\n- Sweat and water resistance: IP54 (buds), IPX4 (case)\n- Bluetooth 5.4 with LE Audio\n- Tensor A1 processor\n- Custom-designed 11mm dynamic speaker driver\n- Active noise cancellation with Silent Seal 2.0\n- Transparency mode\n- Active in-ear pressure relief\n- Conversation detection\n- Ringtone speaker in case for Find My Device\n- Voice accelerometer\n- Three microphones (wind-blocking mesh covers)\n- Capacitive touch (tap and swipe) sensors for music, calls and voice assistant controls\n- IR proximity sensor for in-ear detection to play and pause automatically\n- Motion-detecting accelerometer and gyroscope\n- Hall Effect sensor for case open and close detection\n- USB-C and Qi-certified wireless charging\n- Battery life up to 12 hours with ANC off (additional 36 hours in charging case), 8 hours with ANC on (additional 22 hours in charging case)\n- 5-minute charge of earbuds gets 1.5 hours of listening time (with ANC off)\n- Colors: porcelain, hazel, wintergreen and peony\n- Weight of each earbud: 4.7 grams (with medium ear tip)\n- Charging case: 65 grams (with earbuds)\n- Price: $229"

      "text": "Pros\n- Lightweight and discrete, they offer a comfortable fit with active noise canceling and transparency mode\n- Slightly better sound than AirPods Pro and Powerbeats Pro\n- Physical control button\n- Similar experience for iOS and Android users, except iOS users get hands-free Siri\n- USB-C charging\nCons\n- With no onboard W1 or H1 chip, some key features are missing for Apple users\n- No in-ear detection sensor\nEditors' note: In January 2022, Beats updated the firmware of the Beats Studio Buds, adding a few new features, the most important of which is that Apple users now get \"instant pairing\" with all their iCloud devices from a \"single tap.\" This is not the same as the automatic pairing found on the step-up Beats Fit Pro, as well as the Apple AirPods Pro, AirPods 2nd Generation and AirPods 3rd Generation. The Studio Buds are automatically added to your list of Bluetooth devices available to you on your iCloud devices. But you have to click on the Studio Buds in the Bluetooth menu to pair them to that specific device. (The Studio Buds do not pair to two devices simultaneously.) With the January firmware update, the Studio Buds' \"b\" button can also be customized to control volume, either within the iOS/macOS Bluetooth menu or the Beats app for Android.\nThe Beats Studio Buds are a little unusual for an Apple product -- yes, Apple owns Beats, for those who might have missed that 2014 acquisition. Unlike Apple's own mega popular AirPod headphones, these new Beats noise-canceling true-wireless earbuds are being targeted at Android users, too. (If they sound like old news, thank a steady stream of recent leaks, up to and including LeBron James.)\nBeats says they offer a \"universal\" user experience for iOS and Android, and while that's not completely true, it raises the question, is that a good or bad thing? Well, it depends on what side of the OS fence you're on. While these are excellent earbuds that arguably sound better than the AirPods Pro, they're missing some features that Apple users have come to know and love in the AirPods and even other Beats headphones.\nAt $150 (\u00a3130; AU$200) and sometimes less during flash sales, they basically cost around the same as the AirPods 3rd Generation but they have active noise canceling and a transparency mode like the AirPods Pro. They come in three colors at launch -- red, black and white -- and like other Beats headphones, they could very well come in plenty of other colors in the future.\nRead more: Best deals on Beats headphones for 2022\nStemless AirPods?\nThe first thing you'll notice about the buds is that they look kind of like the once-rumored stemless AirPods. They're discrete-looking in your ears and also quite lightweight, weighing just 5.1 grams. Overall, I thought they were really well-designed, with a physical universal control button on each bud that I prefer to the touch controls you'll find on a lot of true-wireless earbuds these days. You tap and hold a bud to toggle through noise canceling on, transparency on and noise canceling off (you can also program that gesture for one bud to access your phone's native voice assistant). And there's the usual single tap to pause/play tracks and answer/end calls and double-tap to advance tracks. However, there are no volume controls on the buds.\nBeats says it's redesigned the silicone ear tips and I got a tight seal with the largest ear tip and the buds stayed securely in my ears. I found them as comfortable to wear as the AirPods Pro and I also thought they sounded a little better than both the AirPods Pro and Powerbeats Pro. But more on that after I finish talking about their design and features.\nI had no issue with them staying in my ears while running with them but you may get a little slippage as you sweat -- they are IPX4 splashproof -- and sometimes it can help to use foam ear tips, as I do with the AirPods Pro. (Ultimately, foam tips offer a bit more grip.) They also fit my ears better than the Powerbeats Pro, which I have trouble getting a tight seal with unless I use my own XXL large ear tips. But I can see how some people would like the Powerbeats Pro's ear hook as headphones for working out or sporting activities because it gives you some reassurance that the buds won't fall out of your ears.\nAs I said, these were designed with both iPhone and Android users in mind. For starters, the case is nice and compact -- it's just a little bigger than the AirPods Pro's case -- and it has USB-C charging instead of Lightning charging. Yes, you heard that right: USB-C. (A short USB-C to USB-C cable is included, but no charger is included.) Moreover, the experience using the buds with Apple and Android devices is similar for both platforms.\nThere's a one-touch quick pair feature for both iOS and Android; the Beats app for Android also allows you to check battery life, switch from noise canceling to transparency mode (or turn it all off) and get firmware upgrades. The app's feature set is pretty limited -- for instance, there are no EQ controls for tweaking the sound profile if you care about that. But Beats says these are the first product to support both Find My in iOS and Find My Device on Android. It'll show the last known location of the buds or play a chirping sound if they're close by and you just don't see them.\nThe only thing Apple users get that Android users don't is hands-free Siri, which means you can give voice commands by saying, \"Hey, Siri.\" With Android, you have to use your phone's native voice assistant by tapping and holding one of the buds.\nNo H1 or W1 chip\nHere's the rub to all this. One of the reasons the experience is so similar for Apple and Android users is that the Beats Studio Buds don't have an H1 or W1 chip -- the not-so-secret sauce in other Apple and Beats headphones, including the step-up Beats Fit Pro ($200), that allows them to tap into the Apple ecosystem. That means there's no iCloud pairing across all your Apple devices, and thus no auto-switching. Here's how Apple describes it: \"When your other iOS and iPadOS devices are signed in with the same Apple ID as your iPhone, your AirPods seamlessly connect to whichever device you're listening to (on supported AirPods and Beats headphones).\"\nThat's a killer feature for Apple users, the equivalent of multipoint Bluetooth pairing, one of the best conveniences of higher-end wireless headphones. That it's not available with the Studio Buds may be a deal-breaker for some people, especially if they're used to the feature on earlier Apple or Beats models. And while Beats updated to the Studio Buds' firmware in January 2022 so now Apple users now get \"instant pairing\" with all their iCloud devices from a \"single tap,\" the Studio Buds don't pair simultaneously with two Apple devices (you have to manually switch between devices by tapping on the Studio Buds' Bluetooth menu). Practically speaking, this means the audio doesn't automatically switch over to your iPhone when a call comes if you're using the Studio Buds with your Mac or an iPad. But at least you can pair the buds with one of your iCloud devices and it will be listed in the Bluetooth menu of all of them.\nWhile there is no multipoint Bluetooth pairing that would allow you to have these simultaneously connected to two devices, such as a PC and phone, you can pair them with multiple devices and manually switch between them using the Bluetooth menu. It works, but it's not a terribly magical experience.\nThe other thing that's missing is spatial audio for movie and TV watching. That's Apple's virtual surround feature and it's pretty cool if you haven't tried it already. These have no gyroscopes or accelerometers for the head-tracking that's required for spatial for video. They do work for spatial audio for music in Apple Music, but that's not a big deal because all headphones do.\nRead more: Best noise-canceling true wireless earbuds for 2021\nLast but not least, these do not have in-ear detection so your music won't automatically pause when you take them out of your ears and resume when you put them back in. On a more positive note, you can use either the left or right bud independently, a feature that some people find important when chatting on the phone or listening to podcasts.\nBattery life is rated at five hours at moderate volume levels with noise-canceling or transparency mode on and eight hours with it off. The noise-canceling battery life number is in line with the AirPods Pro and you can get two additional charges from the charging case, which doesn't have wireless charging (in case you were wondering). If totally depleted, the buds and case take about two hours to fully charge -- and you get one hour of playback time from a five-minute charge in the case. Beats calls this feature Fast Fuel.\nPerformance evaluation\nAs noted, the Beats Studio features active noise canceling. And while these do have decent muffling capabilities when it comes to noise cancellation, it's not up to the level of the AirPods Pro, Sony WF-1000XM4 or Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. They didn't muffle the noisy HVAC unit in my apartment as well as those models did, nor were they as successful at muffling New York street noise.\nHowever, transparency mode -- that's the mode that allows ambient sound to leak into your ears, so you're not cut off from your surroundings -- is better. The sign of a good transparency mode is that when it's engaged, you should hear the world as if you weren't wearing earbuds. That's how the Beats Studio Buds' transparency mode sounds (natural), so it's at least in the ballpark of the excellent transparency mode of the AirPods Pro though maybe not quite it's equal.\nVoice calling was also good: I went back and forth with these and the AirPods Pro in the streets of New York, and callers told me they thought the BeatsStudio Buds were comparable to the AirPods Pro for headset performance, with good noise-reduction capabilities. They have three microphones in each bud, including a beamforming mic in each to home in on your voice. Callers said they could hear me clearly even as traffic passed by.\nThese are equipped with Bluetooth 5.2 and I didn't have any issues with wireless dropouts or Bluetooth glitching, so all good there.\nAs I hinted at earlier, I thought the sound was good, though not as good as the sound of the step-up Beats Fit Pro, which are a little more articulate and dynamic. That said, the Studio Buds bass is relatively well-defined and the overall sound is well-balanced, with nice detail in the treble and natural sounding mids where vocals live. Beats engineers spent a lot of time creating the custom 8.2mm drivers for these and I think the sound is slightly clearer and more detailed than the AirPods Pro's sound. While I can't say they sound fantastic, they do sound a little smoother and better balanced than the Powerbeats Pro.\nWith its hip-hop roots, Beats has a reputation for having bloated bass, but that's not the case here. In fact, while the bass goes pretty deep, it doesn't have quite the energy or kick as some higher-priced earbuds like the Sony WF-1000XM4. Also, the Sony sounds a little more open and just has a slightly bigger, more refined sound and killer noise canceling. But I think most people will be pleased with the sound the Beats Studio Buds deliver and some will like the fit better than the Sonys, which cost over $100 more.\nBeats Studio Buds: Final thoughts\nAs I said at the outset, these are a little bit of an unusual product for Apple in that Beats is catering to both iPhone and Android users. Google's Pixel Buds A-Series at $99 are a touch behind in sound quality and don't have active noise canceling, but they may be a better value for Android users. You also have the Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus selling for around $100 now. But with all the little corners cut here and there -- no H1 or W1 chip, no in-ear detection -- it feels like there's probably some room for discounts on these Beats. A few months from now you may well see them selling for $20-$30 less.\nI did really like them overall. As I said, they fit my ears well, they're small, and have good sound and call quality. The case is good, too. It's a shame Apple created a bit of a downgraded experience for its own users by not including a couple of those key differentiating features you get with the AirPods and other Beats. Maybe Apple didn't want these to compete directly with the AirPods 3, but at least we've seen some good discounts on the Studio Buds that make them an enticing option, particularly when their price dips to closer to $100."

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_code",
      "text": "IP code\nThe IP code or Ingress Protection code indicates how well a device is protected against water and dust. It is defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) under the international standard IEC 60529[1] which classifies and provides a guideline to the degree of protection provided by mechanical casings and electrical enclosures against intrusion, dust, accidental contact, and water. It is published in the European Union by the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) as EN 60529.\nThe standard aims to provide users more detailed information than vague marketing terms such as waterproof. For example, a cellular phone rated at IP67 is \"dust resistant\" and can be \"immersed in 1 meter of freshwater for up to 30 minutes\". Similarly, an electrical socket rated IP22 is protected against insertion of fingers and will not become unsafe during a specified test in which it is exposed to vertically or nearly vertically dripping water. IP22 or IP2X are typical minimum requirements for the design of electrical accessories for indoor use.[2]\nThe digits indicate conformity with the conditions summarized in the tables below. The digit 0 is used where no protection is provided. The digit is replaced with the letter X when insufficient data has been gathered to assign a protection level. The device can become less capable; however, it cannot become unsafe.\nThere are no hyphens in a standard IP code. IPX-8 (for example) is thus an invalid IP code.[3]\nEtymology\n[edit]In the original IEC 60529 standard from year 1976, the letters IP are used without providing an explanation, and referred as \"characteristic letters\".[4] In the next editions of the standard, from years 1989 and 1999 respectively, the IP is explained to denote \"international protection\" on both French and English pages. According to the Finnish national committee of the IEC, one possibility is that the abbreviation is a combination of English word ingress and French word p\u00e9n\u00e9tration which stands for ingress, but finding the correct answer would require doing a historical study on the 1970's standardization, which is difficult because the experts preparing the original standards are likely retired or deceased.[5]\nCode breakdown\n[edit]This table shows what each digit or part of the IP code represents.[6]\n| Code letters |\nFirst | Second | Third | Additional | Supplementary |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Solid particle protection | Liquid ingress protection | Mechanical impact resistance | Other protections | ||\n| IP | 0\u20136 or X | 0\u20139 or X | 0\u20139 | Letter | Letter |\n| By definition | Required | Required | No longer used | Optional | Optional |\nFirst digit: Solid particle protection\n[edit]The first digit indicates the level of protection the enclosure provides against access to hazardous parts (e.g., electrical conductors, moving parts) and the ingress of solid foreign objects.[7]\n| Level sized | Effective against | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| X | Unknown | X means no data is available to specify a protection rating about this criterion. |\n| 0 | \u2014 | No protection against contact and ingress of objects |\n| 1 | > 50 mm 2.0 in |\nAny large surface of the body, such as the back of a hand, but no protection against deliberate contact with a body part |\n| 2 | > 12.5 mm 0.49 in |\nFingers or similar objects |\n| 3 | > 2.5 mm 0.098 in |\nTools, thick wires, etc. |\n| 4 | > 1 mm 0.039 in |\nMost wires, slender screws, large ants, etc. |\n| 5 | Dust protected | Ingress of dust is not entirely prevented, but it must not enter in sufficient quantity to interfere with the safe operation of the equipment. |\n| 6 | Dust-tight | No ingress of dust; complete protection against contact (dust-tight). A vacuum must be applied. Test duration of up to 8 hours based on airflow. |\nSecond digit: Liquid ingress protection\n[edit]The second digit indicates the level of protection that the enclosure provides against harmful ingress of water.[3]\nThe ratings for water ingress are not cumulative beyond IPX6. A device compliant with IPX7 (covering water immersion) is not necessarily compliant with IPX5 or IPX6 (covering exposure to water jets). A device that meets both tests is indicated by listing both tests separated by a slash, e.g. IPX5/IPX7.\n| Level | Protection against | Effective against | Details |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| X | Unknown | \u2014 | X means no data is available to specify a protection rating concerning these criteria. |\n| 0 | None | \u2014 | No protection against ingress of water |\n| 1 | Dripping water | Dripping water (vertically falling drops) shall have no unsafe effect on the specimen when mounted upright onto a turntable and rotated at 1 RPM. | Test duration: 10 minutes\nWater equivalent to 1 mm (0.039 in) rainfall per minute |\n| 2 | Dripping water when tilted at 15\u00b0 | Vertically dripping water shall have no harmful effect when the enclosure is tilted at an angle of 15\u00b0 from its normal position. A total of four positions are tested within two axes. | Test duration: 2.5 minutes for every direction of tilt (10 minutes total) Water equivalent to 3 mm (0.12 in) rainfall per minute |\n| 3 | Spraying water | Water falling as a spray at any angle up to 60\u00b0 from the vertical shall have no harmful effect, utilizing either: a) an oscillating fixture, or b) a spray nozzle with a counterbalanced shield.\nTest a) is conducted for 5 minutes, then repeated with the specimen rotated horizontally by 90\u00b0 for the second 5-minute test. Test b) is conducted (with a shield in place) for 5 minutes minimum. |\nFor a spray nozzle:\nTest duration: 1 minute per square meter for at least 5 minutes[8] Water volume: 10 liters per minute (0.037 impgal/s) Pressure: 50\u2013150 kPa (7.3\u201321.8 psi) For an oscillating tube: Test duration: 10 minutes Water volume: 0.07 liters per minute (0.00026 impgal/s) per hole |\n| 4 | Splashing of water | Water splashing against the enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effect, utilizing either:\na) an oscillating fixture, or b) A spray nozzle with no shield. Test a) is conducted for 10 minutes. b) is conducted (without shield) for 5 minutes minimum. |\nOscillating tube: Test duration: 10 minutes, or spray nozzle (same as IPX3 spray nozzle with the shield removed) |\n| 5 | Water jets | Water projected by a nozzle (6.3 mm (0.25 in)) against enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects. | Test duration: 1 minute per square meter for at least 3 minutes\nWater volume: 12.5 litres per minute Pressure: 30 kPa (4.4 psi) at distance of 3 meters (9.8 ft) |\n| 6 | Powerful water jets | Water projected in powerful jets (12.5 mm (0.49 in) nozzle) against the enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects. | Test duration: 1 minute per square meter for at least 3 minutes\nWater volume: 100 liters per minute (0.37 impgal/s) Pressure: 100 kPa (15 psi) at distance of 3 meters (9.8 ft) |\n| 6K | Powerful water jets with increased pressure | Water projected in powerful jets (6.3 mm (0.25 in) nozzle) against the enclosure from any direction, under elevated pressure, shall have no harmful effects. Found in DIN 40050, and not IEC 60529. | Test duration: at least 3 minutes[9] Water volume: 75 liters per minute (0.27 impgal/s) Pressure: 1,000 kPa (150 psi) at distance of 3 meters (9.8 ft) |\n| 7 | Immersion, up to 1 meter (3 ft 3 in) depth | Ingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water under defined conditions of pressure and time (up to 1 meter (3 ft 3 in) of submersion). | Test duration: 30 minutes.[7]\nTested with the lowest point of the enclosure 1,000 mm (39 in) below the surface of the water, or the highest point 150 mm (5.9 in) below the surface, whichever is deeper. |\n| 8 | Immersion, 1 meter (3 ft 3 in) or more depth | The equipment is suitable for continuous immersion in water under conditions which the manufacturer shall specify. However, with certain types of equipment, it can mean that water can enter but only so that it produces no harmful effects. The test depth and duration are expected to be greater than the requirements for IPx7, and other environmental effects may be added, such as temperature cycling before immersion. | Test duration: agreement with the manufacturer\nDepth specified by the manufacturer, generally up to 3 meters (9.8 ft) |\n| 9 | Powerful high-temperature water jets | Protected against close-range high-pressure, high-temperature spray downs.\nSmaller specimens rotate slowly on a turntable from 4 specific angles. Larger specimens are mounted in the intended position when used, no turntable required, and are tested freehand for at least 3 minutes at a distance of 0.15\u20130.2 meters (5.9 in \u2013 7.9 in). The specific requirements for the test nozzle are shown in figures 7, 8, & 9 of IEC (or EN) 60529. This test is identified as IPx9 in IEC 60529. |\nTest duration: Fixture: 30 sec. in each of 4 angles (2 min. total), Freehand: 1 min/m2, 3 min. minimum\nWater volume: 14\u201316 liters per minute (0.051\u20130.059 impgal/s) Pressure: 8\u201310 MPa (80\u2013100 bar) at distance of 0.10\u20130.15 meters (3.9 in \u2013 5.9 in) Water temperature: 80 \u00b0C (176 \u00b0F) |\n(All tests with the letter \"K\" are defined by ISO 20653 (replacing DIN 40050-9) and are not found in IEC 60529, except for IPx9, which is the same as the IP69K water test.)\nSupplementary letter (optional)\n[edit]For the protection of equipment specific to:\n| Letter | Meaning |\n|---|---|\n| G | Oil resistant |\n| F | Oil resistant |\n| H | High voltage apparatus |\n| M | Motion during water test |\n| S | Stationary during water test |\n| W | Weather conditions |\nThe letter K is specified in ISO 20653 (replacing DIN 40050-9) and not in IEC 60529.\nIPx9K and IPx9\n[edit]DIN 40050-9 extended the newer IEC 60529 rating system with an IP69K rating for high-pressure, high-temperature wash-down applications.[10] Enclosures conforming with ISO 20653:2013 must be both dust-tight (IP6X) and able to withstand high-pressure and steam cleaning.\nThe IPx9K standard was originally developed for road vehicles\u2014especially those that need regular intensive cleaning (dump trucks, concrete mixers, etc.)\u2014but it also finds use in other areas, such as food processing machinery and car wash systems. It was superseded by ISO 20653:2013 Road Vehicles-Degrees of protection (IP code),[11] and complemented by the addition of a level 9 water ingress testing to IEC 60529, which includes essentially the same spray test as IPx9K, but also includes, in Figure 10 of the standard, a drawing for a test fixture designed to verify the correct water pressure.\nTest setup\n[edit]The test specifies a spray nozzle that is fed with 80 \u00b0C (176 \u00b0F) water at 8\u201310 MPa (80\u2013100 bar; 1,200\u20131,500 psi) and a flow rate of 14\u201316 litres per minute (3.7\u20134.2 US gal/min). The nozzle is held 10\u201315 cm from the tested device at angles of 0\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 60\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 for 30 seconds each. The test device sits on a turntable that completes a rotation once every 12 seconds (5 rpm). The IPx9 specification details a freehand method for testing larger specimens that will not fit on a turntable (see table above). The free hand method also requires (at least) one additional minute of spray time (1 min/m2, 3 min. minimum). The test distance also increases to .175 m (0.15\u20130.2 m per section 14.2.9).\nUnited States (NEMA rating)\n[edit]In the U.S., the National Electrical Manufacturers Association defines NEMA enclosure types in NEMA standard number 250. The following table outlines which IEC 60529 IP code each respective NEMA guideline meets. Ratings between the two standards are not directly equivalent: NEMA ratings also require additional product features and tests (such as functionality under icing conditions, enclosures for hazardous areas, knock-outs for cable connections and others) not addressed by IP ratings.\n| NEMA enclosure[12] | IP code |\n|---|---|\n| 1 | IP20 |\n| 2 | IP22 |\n| 3, 3X, 3S, 3SX | IP55 |\n| 3R, 3RX | IP24 |\n| 4, 4X | IP44, IP66, IP65 |\n| 5 | IP53 |\n| 6 | IP67 |\n| 6P | IP68 |\n| 12, 12K, 13 | IP54 |\nSee also\n[edit]- Appliance classes\n- EN 62262 \u2013 IK code on resistance to mechanical impacts\n- MIL-STD-810\n- U.S. Military connector specifications for military equivalents\n- Water Resistant mark on wrist watches\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ \"IEC 60529:1989+AMD1:1999+AMD2:2013 CSV | IEC Webstore | water management, smart city, rural electrification\". webstore.iec.ch.

      "text": "When I test headphones and earbuds for running, I focus on how comfortably and securely they fit, along with how durable they are, and other key factors like how easy it is to access and operate their controls. Sound quality and voice-calling performance are also important. While noise-isolating earbuds with active noise canceling come with transparency modes that allow you to hear the outside world, many runners and bikers prefer fully open earbuds or bone-conduction headphones to avoid having anything in their ears (for safety reasons). I've tested all the products on this list and fully reviewed several of them.\nOur Picks\nHEADPHONE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $250 (save $101)\n- $295 (save $154)\n- $278 (save $70)\n- $280 (save $170)\nWhat are the best headphones or earbuds overall for running?\nWhile I currently have the Shokz Open Fit 2 true-wireless earbuds at the top of this list, it's hard to declare one model the best overall for running because there are so many good ones. That said, I like a lot of the new sport-oriented open earbuds that have integrated ear hooks or a clip-on design because they fit the most securely -- you don't have to worry about them falling out of or slipping off your ears.\nWhat We Updated: April 2025\nWe added the Shokz OpenDots One and SoundCore by Anker AeroClip buds to the list.\nRead more: Best Wireless Earbuds of 2025\nBest running headphones and earbuds of 2025\nPros\n- Slightly improved design and comfort\n- Impressive sound for open earbuds\n- Improved battery life\n- New physical control button\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\nShokz has released the second-gen OpenFit 2 with a slightly upgraded design, upgraded drivers that noticeably improve the sound quality, better battery life and a new physical control button. The changes don't seem huge on the surface, but the improvements are significant. They fit my ears more comfortably than the originals and have superior sound quality with more bass and better clarity. They sound excellent for open earbuds -- at least in quieter environments.\nPros\n- Dual-driver technology improves sound dramatically\n- Comfortable and secure open-ear design\n- Low vibration\n- Good voice-calling performance\n- Limited sound leakage\nCons\n- Somwhat pricey\nThe problem with bone-conduction headphones has always been that they just don't sound all that good. That is unless you plug up your ears, which defeats the safety benefit of their open-ear design and is why they're so popular with runners and bikers. Well, that just changed. Shokz has finally cracked the code on bone-conduction sound quality with a novel dual-driver design in its new flagship OpenRun Pro 2 headphones ($180).\nWith the OpenRun Pro 2, Shokz has solved the bass deficiency issue by adding a second, more traditional speaker driver that's tasked with firing bass frequencies toward your open ears. Shokz employed that same micro-speaker technology (it calls it \"air conduction\") in its first non-bone-conduction headphones, the OpenFit ($140) and Open Fit Air ($120) true-wireless earbuds.\nPros\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Improved sound with more bass\n- Good battery life\n- Well-priced\nCons\n- A little heavier than Shokz models\nAnker's Soundcore AeroFit 2 open earbuds have been completely redesigned and look quite different from the original AeroFit buds, which also listed for $100. The second-gen Aerofit are not only more comfortable but look sleeker, sound significantly better and offer all-around improvements. The buds aren't as light as the Shokz OpenFit 2 buds and don't sound quite as good, but they cost quite a bit less and offer good all-around performance with augmented bass response. Available in multiple colors, they're a good option for those looking for ear-hook style open earbuds with a fairly premium design and good sound quality without the high price tag of top-end models.\nPros\n- Improved design and sound quality with smaller case\n- Equipped with more powerful H2 chip\n- Good noise canceling\n- Excellent voice-calling performance\n- Heart-rate sensors\n- Strong battery life\n- Wireless charging\nCons\n- Some users may not get a tight seal\n- A few features missing from AirPods Pro 2\n- More basic Find My feature (no Precision Finding)\nWhy I like them\nThe original Powerbeats Pro were released in May 2019, so Beats has had a lot of time to plot how to improve the second generation of its popular ear-hook style true-wireless sport earbuds. And improve they have -- by quite a bit. Not only do they feature a new, more refined design with better ergonomics, but new drivers, a more powerful Apple H2 chip, a new built-in heart-rate sensor and, yes, active noise canceling for the first time in a pair of Powerbeats. And that noise canceling is quite good, as is the sound quality and voice-calling performance -- so long as you get a tight seal from one of the 5 different included ear tips. Read my Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 review.\nThese new Powerbeats Pro 2 fit my ears better thanks to Beats improving the overall ergonomic shape of the earbud and completely redesigned the ear hook -- it's 50% smaller and incorporates nickel-titanium alloy, so it's both flexible and durable. The buds themselves are 20% lighter.\nReasons to buy\nFitness enthusiasts like earbuds with ear hooks so their buds won't fall out of their ears during intense workouts. Typically, such earbuds don't offer the greatest performance, but the Powerbeats Pro 2 have many of the same qualities and features as the AirPods Pro 2 with very good sound along with strong noise canceling and voice-calling performance. In short, they're versatile, also performing well as everyday earbuds. It's also worth noting that while the Powerbeats Pro 2 have some Apple-exclusive features, Beats does have an app for Android users that makes these more Android-friendly than AirPods.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nWhile Beats has improved the Powerbeats Pro 2's design and ergonomics, they still may not be a comfortable fit for everybody's ears and some people may not get a truly tight seal from any of Beats' ear tips (I had an issue and had to use another set of ear tips from my collection). If you don't get a tight seal, you'll likely be unimpressed with the sound quality and noise-cancelling and may want to return them to the store you bought them from (try to find some alternative ear tips before you do that).\nPros\n- Good sound quality for clip-on earbuds\n- Nicely-designed with comfortable, secure fit (flexible joint)\n- Good voice-calling performance\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\nThe Soundcore by AeroClip are Anker's current flagship clip-on earbuds. Not only do I like their design -- they have a premium look and feel -- but they're comfortable to wear and feature very good sound for clip-on buds. Equipped with 12mm drivers, they serve up ample bass with good volume and decent clarity. The buds sound fuller and more open than many cheaper clip-on buds and are among the better sounding open earbuds I've tried (Android users should note that they have support for Sony's high-quality LDAC audio codec). I also thought they worked well for making calls. For the most part, callers said they could hear me clearly -- even in noisier environments like the streets of New York City (Anker says they have 4 beamforming mics, wind-blocking meshes and advanced AI). Battery life is rated at up to 8 hours at moderate volume levels and the buds are IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant (they're splash-proof). Their only drawback is their somewhat high price tag.\nPros\n- Good sound for clip-on open earbuds\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Good battery life\n- Wireless charging\nCons\n- Pricey\n- Voice-calling performance could be a little better\nThe well-designed OpenDots One are among the best open earbuds out there right now. While they don't sound quite as good as the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, they're pretty close and fit my ears slightly better and have better battery life. Like the Ultra Open Earbuds, which list for $299 but are currently on sale for $249, they're overpriced, but at least they cost less than the Bose and their case has wireless charging. Read review.\nPros\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Very good sound for clip-on open earbuds\n- Active noise canceling\n- Spatial audio with head tracking\n- Heart-rate and blood oxygen detection\nCons\n- Noise canceling isn't all that effective\n- Touch controls are a little finicky\nBose's Ultra Open Earbuds may be the best-sounding and most comfortable clip-on earbuds. But they list for $300. In contrast, Edifier's new LolliClip buds cost $130 and their sound is pretty close to what you get with the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds -- and they're almost as comfortable to wear while fitting my ears securely. They also have some features the Bose buds don't have, including active noise canceling (it's not all that effective but you do sense it muffling some noise in the lower frequencies), a heart-rate monitor, blood oxygen sensor and spatial audio with head-tracking. There's also a low-latency mode for gaming and support the LDAC audio codec for Android users.\nThe buds have a battery life rating of up to 6 hours with noise canceling on and 9 hours with it off at moderate volume levels. As for water-resistance, their IP56 rating means they can withstand a sustained spray of water and they're also dust-resistant. As I said, I was overall impressed with the sound quality. It's not going to be quite as good as what you get with noise-isolating earbuds with silicone ear tips that you jam in your ears, but for open buds it's quite good. With these type of buds, which allow you to hear the outside world for safety reasons, the bass tends to be a little weak. But the LolliClip buds output ample bass (you have a few EQ settings to choose from, including a bass boost mode) and offer decent clarity. Note that you will have to play around with the fit of the buds on your ears to optimize the sound quality -- a little adjustment can make a significant difference. Voice-calling performance was good but not exceptionally so.\nMy only gripe is with the touch controls. They're a little finicky (you have to figure out just what is the touch zone), but you do get several customization options in the Edifier ConneX companion app.\nPros\n- Lightweight and comfortable, secure fit\n- Attractively designed\n- Good sound\n- Easy-to-use pinch controls\n- Decent battery life\nCons\n- Some competitors sound slightly better\nThe Nothing Ear (Open) buds may not sound quite as good as Shokz' OpenFit 2 buds, but they do offer very respectable sound for open earbuds and I found them lightweight and comfortable to wear (the overall fit and where the buds end up sitting on your ears will impact sound quality, particularly when it comes to bass performance). Overall, the buds are well-designed and feature Nothing's signature translucent plastic on the exterior of the bud. They're IP54 certified, which means they're splash-proof and dust-resistant.\nAside from their design, I liked their pinch controls and slim, elongated case. Voice-calling performance was also good, though it can be a little harder to hear callers in noisy environments because these are open earbuds. Battery life is rated at 8 hours at moderate volume levels with an additional 22 hours in the charging case. While there's a bass boost mode as part of the equalizer settings in Nothing's companion app for iOS and Android (there's also a \"low-lag gaming mode), the buds can deliver only so much bass. But I was happy wearing them nevertheless.\nPros\n- Upgraded design from X10\n- Secure, comfortable fit\n- Slightly better sound and noise canceling\n- Improved battery life\n- Fully waterproof and dust-proof\nCons\n- Lack a bit of clarity\n- Sound is degraded if you don't get a tight seal\nThe Soundcore Sport X20 has some nice upgrades over Anker's original Soundcore X10 earbuds. They include an improved design, adaptive noise canceling, superior battery life, slightly better sound and multipoint Bluetooth pairing. Like the previous model, these have an interesting design with rotating swiveling ear hooks. They don't swivel as much as the X10's ear hooks, which is a good thing (they stayed on my ears very securely). I also liked that the charging case has a smaller footprint than a lot of buds with ear hooks.\nFully waterproof and dust-proof with an IP68 rating, the X20 has slightly larger drivers than the X10 (11mm instead of 10mm). As long as you get a tight seal from the included ear tips (you get five sizes), they're able to deliver good sound with punchy bass and good detail. They lack a bit of clarity, particularly at higher volumes (there was a touch of distortion), and the noise canceling isn't as good as Sony or Bose's noise canceling. The buds are affordable and a good value overall.\nAs for battery life, it's rated at up to 12 hours with noise canceling off and 7 hours with it on. Voice-calling performance is also decent but not exceptionally good.\nPros\n- Lightweight\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Very good sound and noise canceling\n- Strong voice-calling performance\n- Built-in voice controls\nCons\n- Case is slightly big\n- No wireless charging\nTruth be told, in some ways, I like the Sony's new LinkBuds Fit better than its flagship WF-1000XM5 noise-canceling earbuds. While they don't sound quite as good or have noise canceling that's quite on par with those buds, they're lightweight (4.9 grams) and fit my ears comfortably and securely. Part of that is due to Sony's new Air Fitting Supporters, but it's also redesigned its ear tips and included a wide range of sizes, including XL tips that fit my ears well. Despite being a slight step-down from the WF-1000XM5s for performance, their sound quality, noise canceling and call-quality performance are all very good. They also have built-in voice controls. Read our hands-on first take.\nPros\n- Lightweight and very comfortable\n- Excellent design\n- Good sound for open earbuds\n- Good call quality\nCons\n- Sound quality and battery life is slightly better with step-up OpenFit model\nShokz, the company formerly known as AfterShokz, has long been the leader in bone-conduction headphones. However, this model, like Shokz's step-up OpenFit true-wireless earbuds, doesn't use bone-conduction technology. They have an open design that fires sound into your ears using custom speaker drivers, which Shokz dubs \"air conduction\" technology.\nWhile Shokz' flagship OpenFit 2 buds sound slightly better, have better battery life (up to 11 hours instead of 6 at moderate volume levels) and a physical control button, the Open Fit Air cost around $60 less and are a tad lighter and quite comfortable to wear. Available in three colors, they're lightweight (8.5 grams) and comfortable, and I liked how the ear hooks felt soft but had just the right amount of rigidity. They're IP54 splash-proof and dust-resistant and their charging case is fairly compact for this style of sports buds with ear hooks.\nWhile the earbuds sound quite good for open earbuds, they don't sound quite as good as a set of noise-isolating earbuds in this price range (they're a tad bass shy). Nor do they sound as good Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, which do cost more and serve up a little more bass and fuller sound; the Bose also sound slightly better than Shokz' Open Fit buds. Equipped with two microphones in each bud, the Open Fit Air offer good voice-calling performance. Additionally, the feature multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them to two devices simultaneously.\nPros\n- Innovative clip-on fit\n- Comfortable to wear\n- Very good sound for open earbuds\n- Decent voice-calling performance\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Look may not appeal to everyone\n- Not great for noisy environments\nThe Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have one of the most unusual designs of any earbuds I've tested over the last several years. They clip onto the side of your ears, kind of like earrings, and their open design has micro speakers that fire sound into your ears while still being able to hear what's happening around you. At $299, they're somewhat overpriced, but otherwise, there's a lot to like about them, including a surprisingly comfortable, secure fit and very good sound quality for open buds.\nPros\n- Smaller ring-shaped driver and new Air Fitting Supporters create a more comfortable, secure fit\n- Improved sound\n- Decent voice-calling performance\n- Built-in voice controls\nCons\n- May not fit some ears comfortably\n- Fairly pricey\nWhile the LinkBuds Open retain the ring-shaped open driver of the original LinkBuds, it's slightly smaller than the original's driver (11 versus 12mm). Also, the Air Fitting Supporters are an improvement over the original's Arc Supporters, which were quite slim and didn't conform to the shape of your ear as well as these new supporters do. The combination of the slightly smaller driver design and the new supporters should allow the buds to fit more ears more comfortably and securely. However, those with smaller ears may have some issues with them.\nI personally got a very secure fit and was able to run with the buds without a problem (they're IPX4 splashproof). The originals created some pressure points for some wearers. I had to fiddle around with their positioning in my ears from time to time, but I didn't experience any pain points with the LinkBuds Fit. However, Apple's new AirPods 4 were slightly more comfortable in my ears, though they didn't fit as securely.\nAside from the fit, the other big change is to the sound quality. It's definitely improved. Despite the smaller drivers, the buds play more loudly and also deliver a little more bass. The buds are equipped with Sony's V2 digital processing chip and Sony says the driver's have a \"high-compliance diaphragm and powerful neodymium magnet\" that were \"specifically selected to reproduce clear mid and high frequency sound.\" I also liked the built-in voice controls.\nPros\n- Lightweight design with integrated wingtip that fits securely\n- Good sound and noise canceling\n- Powered by Apple's H1 chip\nCons\n- No wireless charging\n- No enhanced My Find with proximity view (only standard Find My)\nThe Beats Fit Pro technically aren't AirPods, but they're built on the same tech platform as the AirPods Pro (yes, Apple owns Beats). Unlike Beats' earlier and less expensive Studio Buds and 2023 Studio Buds Plus, the Beats Fit Pro includes Apple's H1 chip and has most of the AirPods Pro's features, including active noise cancellation, spatial audio and Adaptive EQ. I'd venture to call them the sports AirPods you've always wanted.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Secure fit with open design\n- Relatively good sound for bone-conduction headphones\n- USB-C charging\nCons\n- Bass lacks fullness (not for critical listening)\n- Neckband design isn't for everybody\nShokz's OpenMove bone-conduction headphones list for $80. The OpenMove headphones have some small design upgrades over their predecessors. I found them comfortable to wear, and while the sound isn't great, it's relatively good for a bone-conduction headphone. Again, keep your sound quality expectations in check or you'll be disappointed. They're very good for listening to podcasts, audiobooks and news broadcasts while you run. I tend to listen to Sirius XM radio while running.\nThis model charges via USB-C and includes a simple carrying pouch. Battery life is rated at up to 6 hours.\nPros\n- Comfortable fit\n- Good sound\n- Loaded with features\n- Touchscreen in charging case\n- Built-in voice controls\n- Dolby spatial audio with head tracking\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\n- Case is a little large\nCleer's Arc 2 earbuds were among the best-sounding open wireless earbuds with an ear-hook design. Among this style of open buds, the new Arc 3 buds are still near the top for sound but other companies like Shokz and Bose have caught up and arguably sound slightly better. But the Cleer Arc 3 buds have something that other buds of this ilk don't have: a touchscreen LCD built into its charging case. It allows you to control playback and access the buds' features, including EQ settings and even use the case as a remote to snap a photo on your smartphone.\nIn fact, the Arc 3 are probably the most feature-rich open earbuds out there right now -- and they're fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating. They have built-in voice controls to raise and lower volume, and skip tracks forward and back, as well as Dolby Atmos spatial audio with head-tracking. Additionally, you can nod your head twice to take a call or shake your head back and forth to reject it (this feature is referred to as gesture controls). And finally, they have a UV light that sterilizes the buds when they're in the case. Oh, and a step counter.\nWhile the sound can be a tad uneven from track to track, and the buds' bass lacks a little punch compared to what you get with a good set of noise-isolating buds in this price range, they fit my ears comfortably and securely. They also offered solid voice-calling performance. They're a little expensive but their price seems to be creeping down a bit.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Don't look or feel cheap\n- Decent sound\n- Relatively compact charging case\nCons\n- Companion app is underwhelming\nI didn't try the original Soundpeats GoFree earbuds, but the second-gen GoFree 2s deliver a good value, with decent sound for open earbuds that sit on top of your ears -- there's a touch of distortion at higher volumes, but they have ample bass. While they don't quite look or feel like premium buds, they also don't look or feel cheap. They're missing premium features like ear-detection sensors (when you take one off, your music doesn't automatically pause), and their companion app for iOS and Android is a bit underwhelming. But I found them pretty comfortable to wear, they fit securely and their touch controls worked well.\nThey're equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, have support for the LDAC audio codec for devices like Android phones that support it, and they are IPX5 splash-proof. Battery life is rated up to nine hours at moderate volume levels and their case is one of the more compact cases I've seen for these types of earbuds.\nI thought voice-calling performance was acceptable, though not great. These are open earbuds, so they do let sound in, and it can be a little hard to hear callers in noisier environments.\nPros\n- Great battery life\n- Ambient Aware mode is handy\nCons\n- Case is bulkier than most\nJBL upgraded its ear-hook style sport earbuds in 2023. Available in black or white, the Endurance Peak 3 buds offer better battery life (up to 10 hours with four extra charges in their case) improved voice-calling performance and an IP68 rating that makes them fully water- and dust-proof. They also have an Ambient Aware transparency mode and Talk Thru mode that can automatically lower your music's volume level and open up the buds to the outside world. That means you can have a conversation with someone without removing the buds from your ears.\nThey stayed on my ears very securely during runs and I thought they sounded quite good, although they do have a bit of bass push (i.e. they have powerful bass). Just be aware that if you don't get a tight seal, sound quality will be significantly worse. Also, like other earbuds with ear-hook designs, the case is on the beefy side. The buds do seem durable and if you get a good fit, they're an excellent and less pricey alternative to the Beats Powerbeats Pro. I also thought the touch controls worked well; I was easily able to toggle through the sound modes.\nPros\n- Significantly improved sound and noise canceling\n- Powered by Apple's new H2 chip\n- Better battery life and upgraded microphones\nCons\n- Basically the same design as the previous model\n- No high-resolution audio\nAs long as you can get a good, secure fit, the lightweight second-gen AirPods Pro make excellent earbuds for running and feature a top-notch transparency mode that allows you to hear the outside world. They now come with extra small ear tips for those with very small ears, but Apple still doesn't have extra-large tips for those with larger ears.\nFactors to consider when buying running headphones\nBudget\nBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new wireless sports buds. The quality of value-priced earbuds and headphones continues to improve, so you can find good affordable sports buds for less than $75. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost more than $100 and sometimes more than $150.\nNoise-isolating or open design\nSports buds are available in a few styles. Some come with silicone tips that are designed to create a tight seal in your ear and keep sound out (they have a noise-isolating design). Others have an open design with the buds resting on top of your ears, firing sound into them. The noise-isolating style typically gives you better sound with stronger bass while the open design has the advantage of allowing sound in for safety reasons.\nEar hooks or not\nSome sports buds feature designs with integrated ear hooks or sports fins. Both help keep the buds more securely on or in your ears. They aren't essential to getting a secure fit (there are buds with no ear hooks or fins that fit some people securely), but they do help. Not everybody finds these types of designs comfortable.\nFit and comfort\nIt's key that sports earbuds fit your ears not only comfortably but securely. They should offer a comfortable fit that allows you to wear the earbuds for long periods without any irritation.\nDurability\nYou want sports buds that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality and a good water-resistance rating.\nReturn policy\nIt's critical to buy your sports at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days, and then return one.\nHow we test running earbuds and headphones\nWe test running headphones and earbuds based on six key criteria and evaluate the models we test in both a gym environment and for outdoor three-mile runs. These criteria include design, sound quality, noise-canceling performance, voice-calling performance, features and value.\n- Design: Evaluating design, we assess not only how comfortable the headphones and earbuds fit (their ergonomics) but also their build quality and how well the controls are implemented. When it comes to earbuds, we also look at water- and dust-resistance ratings.\n- Sound quality: We evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing the earbuds to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment.\n- Noise-canceling performance: We evaluate noise-canceling performance by wearing headphones in the same spot indoors near a noisy HVAC unit to see how well they do at muffling lower frequencies. Then we head out to the streets of New York to test the headphones in a real-world environment where we see how they muffle not only street noise but people's voices.\n- Extra features: Some great-sounding running headphones and earbuds aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from quick-access awareness to transparency modes (your music pauses and the headphones open up to the outside world so you can have a conversation) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears. We also take a look at the companion app for the headphones if there is one and how user-friendly it is.\n- Voice-calling: When we test voice-calling performance, we make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the headphones or earbuds reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear our voices.\n- Value: We determine value after evaluating the strength of the headphones and earbuds against all these criteria and what they're able to deliver compared to other models in their price class.\nOther running headphones and earbuds we tested\n1More Fit SE S30: 1More makes a few open sports earbuds with ear hooks, including the newer Fit SE S31 ($50). The Fit S50 ($100) feature a little better sound than the Fit SE S30, have a more premium design and are fully waterproof (IPX7 rating). But I like the fit a little better on the step-down S30, which is IPX5 splashproof (it can sustain a spray of water) and costs less than $40, making it a better value.\nSoundcore by Anker AeroFit Pro: The AeroFit Pros are among the better open-ear \"air conduction\" earbuds, with a premium look and feel, and are comfortable to wear. (I had no problem keeping them on my ears while running or working out.) On the downside, they're expensive, but they do feature strong audio quality for these types of earbuds, with ample bass and volume, plus decent clarity. They're good for making calls (they do a pretty good job of reducing background noise) and also offer strong battery life of up to 14 hours at moderate volume levels.\nJabra Elite 8 Active Gen 2: Jabra billed these earbuds, which have unfortunately been discontinued, as the \"world's toughest earbuds,\" and based on our tests (they survived several drops without a scratch), that may very well be true. While there are two new color options, the Gen 2 model doesn't look any different from the original, but it includes an LE Audio smart case which allows wireless streaming from any device with USB-C or 3.5mm port. I tested them with in-flight entertainment and they worked well, with no audio lag. The Elite 8 Active Gen 2 also feature enhanced spatial sound powered by Dolby Audio \"for a better music experience,\" enhanced Natural HearThrough for better awareness when outdoors and improved noise-canceling performance.\nSony Link Buds: The LinkBuds are, in a sense, Sony's answer to Apple's standard AirPods. They don't sound as good as Sony's flagship WF-1000XM5 noise-isolating earbuds, but they offer a discreet, innovative design and a more secure fit than the AirPods, as well as good sound and very good voice-calling performance.\nEarfun Free Pro 2: We used to have the EarFun Free Pro 2 earbuds on this list. They're still available at a discount and are decent earbuds for running but EarFun has released the new EarFun Free Pro 3 buds, which are a definite upgrade.\nJBL Live Pro 2: Over the years, JBL has put out some decent true-wireless earbuds, but nothing that really got me too excited. That's finally changed with the arrival of the Samsung-owned brand's new Live Pro 2 and Live Free 2 buds. Both sets of buds -- the Live Pro 2 has stems while the Live Free 2 has a pill-shaped design -- offer a comfortable fit along with strong noise canceling, very good sound quality and voice-calling performance, plus a robust set of features, including multipoint Bluetooth pairing, an IPX5 splash-proof rating and wireless charging.\nShure Aonic 215 II: Shure's Aonic 215 II is kind of the audiophile equivalent of the Beats Powerbeats Pro. They have a hook that wraps around the top of your ear, and they stay in my ears very securely (even more securely than the Powerbeats Pro earbuds). Like that Beats model, they have a jumbo charging case. What's interesting about them is that the Bluetooth module is detachable. (I liked the physical control button they have instead of touch controls.) As the name implies, the Aonic 215 True Wireless Noise-Isolating Earphones incorporate Shure's SE215 buds, the $99 model in its line of earbuds that have detachable cables. The modules, which can be bought separately for $229, are designed to drive any Shure earbuds that have a detachable cable, including the $899 SE846.\nSennheiser Sport True Wireless: The Sport True Wireless earbuds are essentially Sennheiser's CX True Wireless earbuds with sport fins (for a more secure fit) and better durability. They have an IP54 rating that makes them splash-proof and dust-resistant. These aren't noise-cancelling earbuds but they do have an awareness mode that allows ambient sound to leak into the buds so you can hear what's going on around you for safety reasons. They use Bluetooth 5.2 and have support for the AAC and AptX audio codecs. Battery life is rated at up to 9 hours at moderate volume levels with an additional two charges in the charging case (there's no wireless charging).\nSony Float Run: Sony's Float Run is a unique take on \"off-ear\" headphones, which is another way to describe open earbuds that sit away from your ears. I can't say these have the greatest sound -- the bass is underwhelming -- but they fit my head securely and comfortably. They're designed for folks who don't like to have earbuds jammed into their ears, and runners who want to hear the outside world for safety reasons.\nSkullcandy Push Active : With their ear-hook design, the Skullcandy Push Active are essentially a more affordable version of the Beats Powerbeats Pro, and they fit my ears slightly better than the Powerbeats Pro. I'm not usually a fan of ear-hook style buds, but this model is one of the better ones."

      "text": "I was in a movie theater last December watching Avatar: The Way of Water in 3D, and I said to myself: \"Wow, this is an immersive film I'd love to watch in next-gen VR.\" That's exactly what I experienced in Apple's Vision Pro headset, and yeah, it's amazing.\nOn Monday, I tried out the Vision Pro in a series of carefully picked demos during WWDC at Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters. I've been using cutting-edge VR devices for years, and I found all sorts of augmented reality memories bubbling up in my brain. Apple's compact \u2014 but still not small \u2014 headset reminds me of an Apple-designed Meta Quest Pro. The fit of the back strap was comfy yet stretchy, with a dial to adjust the rear fit and a top strap for stability. The headset's sleek design, and even its glowing front faceplate, also gave me an instant Ready Player One vibe.\nI couldn't wear my glasses during the demo, though, and neither will you. Apple's headset does not support glasses, instead relying on Zeiss custom inserts to correct wearers' vision. Apple did manage, through a setup process, to easily find lenses that fit my vision well enough so that everything seemed crystal clear, which is not an easy task. Also, we adjusted the fit and tuned spatial audio for my head using an iPhone, a system that will be finessed when the headset is released in 2024.\nFrom there, I did my demos seated, mostly, and found myself surprised from the start. The passthrough video camera quality of this headset is good \u2014 really, really good. Not as good as my own vision, but good enough that I could see the room well, see people in it with me, see my watch notifications easily on my wrist. The only headset that's done this previously was the extremely impressive but PC-connected Varjo XR-3, and Apple's display and cameras feel even better.\nApple's floating grid of apps appears when I press the top digital crown, which autocenters the home screen to wherever I'm looking. I set up eye tracking, which worked like on many other VR headsets I've used: I looked at glowing dots as musical notes played, and got a chime when it all worked.\nFrom there, the interface was surprisingly fluid. Looking at icons or interface options slightly enlarges them, or changes how bold they appear. Tapping with my fingers while looking at something opens an app.\nI've used tons of hand-tracking technology on headsets like the HoloLens 2 and the Meta Quest 2 and Pro, and usually there's a lot of hand motion required. Here, I could be really lazy. I pinched to open icons even while my hand was resting in my lap, and it worked.\nScrolling involves pinching and pulling with my fingers; again, pretty easy to do. I resized windows by moving my hand to throw a window across the room or pin it closer to me. I opened multiple apps at once, including Safari, Messages and Photos. It was easy enough to scroll around, although sometimes my eye tracking needed a bit of extra concentration to pull off.\nMore from WWDC 2023\nApple's headset uses eye tracking constantly in its interface, something Meta's Quest Pro and even the PlayStation VR 2 don't do. That might be part of the reason for the external battery pack. The emphasis on eye tracking as a major part of the interface felt transformative, in a way I expected might be the case for VR and AR years ago. What I don't know is how it will feel in longer sessions.\nI don't know how the Vision Pro will work with keyboards and trackpads, since I didn't get to demo the headset that way. It works with Apple's Magic Keyboard and Magic Trackpad, and Macs, but not with iPhone and iPad or Watch touchscreens \u2014 not now, at least.\nDialing in reality\nI scrolled through some photos in Apple's preset photo album, plus a few 3D photos and video clips shot with the Vision Pro's 3D camera. All the images looked really crisp, and a panoramic photo that spread around me looked almost like it was a window on a landscape that extended just beyond the room I was in.\nApple has volumetric 3D landscapes on the Vision Pro that are immersive backgrounds like 3D wallpaper, but looking at one really shows off how nice that Micro OLED display looks. A lake looked like it was rolling up to a rocky shore that ended right where the real coffee table was in front of me.\nAlso read: What Is Micro-OLED? Apple Vision Pro's Screen Tech Explained\nRaising my hands to my face, I saw how the headset separates my hands from VR, a trick that's already in Apple's ARKit. It's a little rough around the edges but good enough. Similarly, there's a wild new trick where anyone else in the room can ghost into view if you look at them, a fuzzy halo with their real passthrough video image slowly materializing. It's meant to help create meaningful contact with people while wearing the headset. I wondered how you could turn that off or tune it to be less present, but it's a very new idea in mixed reality.\nApple's digital crown, a small dial borrowed from the Apple Watch, handles reality blend. I could turn the dial to slowly extend the 3D panorama until it surrounded me everywhere, or dial it back so it just emerged a little bit like a 3D window.\nMixed reality in Apple's headset looks so casually impressive that I almost didn't appreciate how great it was. Again, I've seen mixed reality in VR headsets before (Varjo XR-3, Quest Pro), and I've understood its capabilities. Apple's execution of mixed reality felt much more immersive, rich and effortless on most fronts, with a field of view that felt expansive and rich. I can't to see more experiences in it.\nCinematic fidelity that wowed me\nThe cinema demo was what really shocked me, though. I played a 3D clip of Avatar: The Way of Water in-headset, on a screen in various viewing modes including a cinema. Apple's mixed-reality passthrough can also dim the rest of the world down a bit, in a way similar to how the Magic Leap 2 does with its AR. But the scenes of Way of Water sent little chills through me. It was vivid. This felt like a movie experience. I don't feel that way in other VR headsets.\nApple also demonstrated its Immersive Video format that's coming as an extension to Apple TV Plus. It's a 180-degree video format, similar to what I've seen before in concept, but with really strong resolution and video quality. A splash demo reel of Alicia Keys singing, Apple Sports events, documentary footage and more reeled off in front of me, a teaser of what's to come. One-eighty-degree video never appears quite as crisp to me as big-screen film content, but the sports clips I saw made me wonder how good virtual Jets games could be in the future. Things have come a long way.\nWould I pay $3,499 for a head-worn cinema? No, but it's clearly one of this device's greatest unique strengths. The resolution and brightness of the display were surprising.\nConvincing avatars (I mean, Personas)\nApple's Personas are 3D-scanned avatars generated by using the Vision Pro to scan your face, making a version of yourself that shows up in FaceTime chats if you want, or also on the outside of the Vision Pro's curved OLED display to show whether you're \"present\" or in an app. I didn't see how that outer display worked, but I had a FaceTime with someone in their Persona form, and it was good. Again, it looked surprisingly good.\nI've chatted with Meta's ultra-realistic Codec Avatars, which aim for realistic representations of people in VR. Those are stunning, and I've also seen Meta's phone-scanned step-down version in an early form last year, where a talking head spoke to me in VR. Apple's Persona looked better than Meta's phone-scanned avatar, although a bit fuzzy around the edges, like a dream. The woman whose Persona was scanned appeared in her own window, not in a full-screen form.\nAnd I wondered how expressive the emotions are with the Vision Pro's scanning cameras. The Pro has an ability to scan jaw movement similar to the Quest Pro, and the Persona I chatted with was friendly and smiling. How would it look for someone I know, like my mom? Here, it was good enough that I forgot it was a scan.\nWe demoed a bit of Apple's Freeform app, where a collaboration window opened up while my Persona friend chatted in another window. 3D objects popped up in the Freeform app, a full home scan. It looked realistic enough.\nDinosaurs in my world\nThe final demo was an app experience called Encounter Dinosaurs, which reminded me of early VR app demos I had years ago: An experience emphasizing just the immersive \"wow\" factor of dinosaurs appearing in a 3D window that seemed to open up in the back wall of my demo room. Creatures that looked like carnotauruses slowly walked through the window and into my space.\nAll my demos were seated except for this one, where I stood up and walked around a bit. This sounds like it wouldn't be an impressive demo, but again, the quality of the visuals and how they looked in relation to the room's passthrough video capture was what made it feel so great. As the dinosaur snapped at my hand, it felt pretty real. And so did a butterfly that danced through the room and tried to land on my extended finger.\nI smiled. But even more so, I was impressed when I took off the headset. My own everyday vision wasn't that much sharper than what Apple's passthrough cameras provided. The gap between the two was closer than I would have expected, and it's what makes Apple's take on mixed reality in VR work so well.\nThen there's the battery pack. There's a corded battery that's needed to power the headset, instead of a built-in battery like most others have. That meant I had to make sure to grab the battery pack as I started to move around, which is probably a reason why so many of Apple's demos were seated.\nWhat about fitness and everything else?\nApple didn't emphasize fitness much at all, a surprise to me. VR is already a great platform for fitness, although no one's finessed headset design for fitness comfort. Maybe having that battery pack right now will limit movement in active games and experiences. Maybe Apple will announce more plans here later. The only taste I got of health and wellness was a one-minute micro meditation, which was similar to the one on the Apple Watch. It was pretty, and again a great showcase of the display quality, but I want more.\n2024 is still a while away, and Apple's headset is priced way out of range for most people. And I have no idea how functional this current headset would feel if I were doing everyday work. But Apple did show off a display, and an interface, that are far better than I was ready for. If Apple can build on that, and the Vision Pro finds ways of expanding its mixed-reality capabilities, then who knows what else is possible?\nThis was just my fast-take reaction to a quick set of demos on one day in Cupertino. There are a lot more questions to come, but this first set of demos resonated with me. Apple showed what it can do, and we're not even at the headset's launch yet."

      "text": "Pros\n- Ultracompact, lightweight, sweatproof (IPX4) and very comfortable to wear\n- Significantly improved sound with better bass\n- Performance when making calls is excellent\n- Improved battery life (up to 6 hours)\n- Spatial audio virtual-surround feature works with a variety of Apple devices\n- Always-on Siri\nCons\n- May not fit ears as securely as AirPods Pro\n- Open design allows sound to leak in and out\n- AirPods Pro are frequently available at the same price\nUpdate Sept. 16, 2024: Check out the full CNET review of the Apple AirPods 4 here. The remainder of this review has not been updated.\nTake one look at the new design of the third-gen AirPods ($179, \u00a3169, AU$279) and the first thing you'll probably think is: \"Those look like the AirPods Pro without ear tips.\" You wouldn't be wrong. While they're more fraternal than identical twins, the AirPods 3 are shaped like the AirPods Pro, with the same shorter stems. Those stems also have the same pinch controls as those of the Pro, which I prefer over the touch controls on the original and second-generation AirPods. New drivers that are supposed to make them sound more detailed and deliver fuller bass are also on board.\nSo just how good are they, and why would you get them instead of the AirPods Pro, which offer full active noise canceling and cost about the same at most retailers during increasingly frequent sales? Well, that's what this AirPods 3 review is all about.\nLet's start with the fit. The original and second-generation AirPods fit some people's ears perfectly. But I was among the subset of users who had trouble keeping their AirPods in their ears. So I was really curious to see whether this third-gen version was going to work better for me. The answer is yes, but I still had to turn the stems up to sort of lock them in place when I was active, which means they're still not quite a perfect match for my ears (and presumably for a certain percentage of other ears).\nThe stems-up positioning leaves them sitting up a bit on your face at a right angle -- I'm sure you've seen that AirPods style before -- and it can feel a little dopey at first (and by dopey, I don't mean dope). But wearing them like that didn't seem to impact sound quality or performance. In fact, sensors on the inside of the buds detect how you're wearing them, and Apple says its Adaptive EQ adjusts the sound accordingly.\nRead more: Best-true wireless earbuds\nUnlike with the AirPods 2, I was able to run with these when I turned the stems up. A lot of people like to run with AirPods because they're lightweight and have an open design, so you can hear what's going on around you for safety reasons. But the first- and second-generation models weren't sweat- or water-resistant -- or at least Apple never said they were. These are, though. Like the AirPods Pro, they're IPX4 splash-proof. Most earbuds these days are water-resistant and many are fully waterproof. So you could say that Apple's caught up to the pack with a standard feature rather than adding an upgrade. But while the earlier models seemed to survive people using them for physical activities, I'm glad these are now officially water-resistant.\nI did ask a few avid AirPods users to try the AirPods 3 and they all liked the third-gen's fit better than that of the second-gen offering. They also thought the sound was significantly better. As I said, Apple has equipped these with new custom high-excursion drivers. At 11mm, they're smaller than the 14mm drivers in the second-generation AirPods (the AirPods Pro also have 11mm drivers), but they're completely redesigned to push more air to improve the bass response, with a bigger air vent to help.\nTruth be told, I'm personally not a fan of open earbuds. Not only do they allow sound to leak in and compete with what you're listening to, but you tend to lose some bass with open buds, which then leads to them sounding thin. Also, if you play your music at even slightly higher volume levels (or loudly), people near you are going to hear it, particularly in a quieter room. But for folks who don't like the penetration of an ear tip into their ear canal, I can certainly understand the appeal.\nBringing the bass\nThe AirPods 3 still leak sound, but Apple has put a great deal of effort into upping the AirPods' sound game. Along with the new drivers these have the aforementioned Adaptive EQ also found in the AirPods Pro that optimizes the sound on the fly. Other companies like Bose also have advanced digital processing features with their headphones -- Bose calls its version Active EQ, while Sony has its Digital Sound Enhancement Engine that's designed to fill in those missing details with compressed music files and make everything you listen to sound better. So it's not groundbreaking, but it's certainly nice to have on board. And I will say that the AirPods 3 now deliver richer, fuller sound with more detail and better bass.\nThe sound isn't up to the level of the Sony WF-1000XM4 and top noise-isolating earbuds from Sennheiser and others that cost more (check out our list of best-sounding earbuds). Those earphones just offer a bit more depth and texture to their sound with more bass energy.\nYou can hear it on Spoon's Knock Knock Knock, a haunting track that has a deep bass line and layered guitar tracks running through it. With the Sony, the sound is bigger overall, with more bite and nuance and more kick to the bass. The same can be said for the Foo Fighters' Everlong. True wireless Bluetooth earbuds tend to have the most trouble with complicated rock tracks that have several instruments playing at the same time (they can sound a little too blended together with lesser buds), so I always run a series of rock tracks through the buds to see how they fare.\nAll that said, the new AirPods now sound like respectable headphones, which is an achievement. While you'll still run into a bit of trouble in noisier environments, the bass held up better than I thought it would, even when I was walking on the noisy streets of New York. Overall the AirPods 3's new sound put up a good fight against ambient noise, not exactly drowning it out, but making you much less aware of it. And as you might expect from open earbuds, these do sound open with a wide soundstage. It's just not quite as wide as that of the Sony WF-1000XM4.\nWhile they're supposed to offer comparable sound to the AirPods Pro, I think the AirPods 3 sound slightly better overall. They offer a bit cleaner, slightly bigger and more dynamic sound with slightly better-defined bass. And they do a good job not distorting at higher volumes -- that's where the Adaptive EQ comes into play -- which is what can happen when you push cheaper open earbuds. But depending on what track you're listening to, you can tell that the Adaptive EQ is ratcheting back certain frequencies just a touch to avoid distorting when you crank up the volume.\nExtras for Apple users\nThese have Apple's new spatial audio feature with head tracking that's available in the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. It's a nice bonus feature that allows you to get virtual surround sound when you're watching movies and TV shows on various Apple devices. It's a neat effect with video watching but a bit more hit or miss with Apple music tracks with Dolby Atmos. It also now works with group FaceTime calls, which is kind of cool. I did a test call with an iPhone 13 with two people and placed the phone in landscape mode so that one person was on the left and the other was on the right. When the person on the left spoke, there was a sense she was coming from my left and vice versa.\nLike the AirPods Pro, the AirPods 3 have ear-detection sensors but they add a new wrinkle -- skin detection so they can tell the difference between when a bud is in your ear and when it's in your pocket. You also get the enhanced Find My feature with proximity view, which helps locate your AirPods in all those places they like to hide with more precision (you can detect where they are within a foot or two, even if a bud or buds get separated from the case, though it can sometimes take a little while to pick up their electronic scent).\nAdditionally, they're equipped with Apple's H1 chip so you get the other features associated with that, including autoswitching between all your Apple devices on your iCloud account and always-on Siri, so you can just say, \"Hey, Siri\" to ask what the weather is, raise and lower volume, make calls to people in your contacts and perform a host of other voice commands that Apple's voice assistant responds to.\nTo be clear, the AirPods 3 will pair with most other Bluetooth audio sources, but you lose all the extra features like spatial audio and always-on Siri. But the bottom line is that if you're not an Apple user, there isn't much reason to get these. I have both Apple and Android devices, so I did pair these with an Android phone. The Adaptive EQ is built into the buds themselves, so they sound basically the same with an Android device, and they're also good for making calls with any phone you use.\nTop-notch noise-reduction for calls\nThe AirPods 3 have beamforming microphones covered with wind-dampening acoustic mesh and voice-detecting accelerometers. In my tests, they did an excellent job reducing background noise while keeping my voice sounding clear. Callers said the noise reduction was slightly better than what they heard when I was using the AirPods Pro, and that my voice also sounded a touch clearer.\nAnother small upgrade worth mentioning: Apple says these have full-HD audio for FaceTime calls thanks to support for the AAC-ELD speech codec. And I also thought the wind noise-reduction feature worked well. They'd probably work pretty well for bike riding, but I'd personally use an accessory sport-fin to make sure they stayed in my ears.\nThe AirPods 2 are also very good for voice calling and their longer stems are slightly closer to your mouth, so I'm not sure if you'll notice a major upgrade with these for voice calling, but their fuller sound allowed me to hear callers better (one big benefit of the AirPods Pro's noise-isolating design is that they considerably cut down ambient noise so you have no trouble hearing callers).\nBattery life has been improved from 5 hours to 6 on a single charge with an extra four charges in the charging case (that rating is for moderate volume levels so your mileage may vary if you really crank your tunes). That case, which is a little smaller than the AirPods Pro's case but bigger than that of the AirPods 2, has wireless charging and now adds MagSafe compatibility. That just means it sticks Apple's magnetic MagSafe chargers as well as other magnetic wireless chargers, including wireless battery chargers (however, you can't stick it on the back of your iPhone and reverse-MagSafe charge it using your phone's battery). You can also charge it with any Qi-enabled charging pad or plug a Lightning cable into it. Using a MagSafe charger doesn't charge the buds any faster but the buds do stick nicely to the charging puck.\nGoing forward, the AirPods Pro will also have MagSafe, but the AirPods 2, which stay in the line, now come exclusively in a version with Lightning charging for a lower list price of $129. Personally, I don't think wireless charging is a killer feature for earbuds, but again, I'll take it, particularly at this price. (Sale prices are already lower: Walmart is teasing the AirPods 2 for $89 in November.)\nFinal thoughts: Tricky pricing\nReally it's the AirPods' pricing that may create some dilemmas for potential buyers. The AirPods Pro list for $250 but they typically sell for less than $200 and have dipped to as low as $180, which is the price at which the third-generation AirPods are debuting.\nWhile the AirPods 3 are superior to the AirPods Pro in some ways -- as I said, I do think they sound slightly better in non-noisy environments, and they offer a touch better noise-reduction during calls and have better battery life -- the AirPods Pro's noise-isolating design and active noise cancellation have obvious benefits. For instance, you'd want to use AirPods Pro on a plane, not the AirPods 3. Also, the Pro's excellent transparency mode mitigates some of the occlusion issues people have with noise-isolating buds.\nI find the AirPods Pro comfortable to wear. They fit my ears very securely, especially after I got a pair of foam tips for them. But, again, a lot of people just don't like having ear tips jammed into their ears or are fond of the lightweight standard AirPods and their comfortable nonoccluded fit, despite their shortcomings.\nThat's where the AirPods 3 come in. They're basically premium open earbuds, a somewhat rare breed. Sure, you can find pretty decent open-style buds for about $60 these days on Amazon (check out our list of AirPods-alternatives). But the AirPods 3 not only sound better and avoid distorting when pushed, but they have those extra features like spatial audio. And they're also great for making calls. Overall, they're an excellent set of open earbuds -- I liked them and I'm not even a fan of that headphone genre. If that's what you're looking for, look no further.\nHowever, I ultimately think they're going to have to come down in price a bit, probably to around $140 or $150, to separate themselves from the AirPods Pro, which seem to fit more people's ears well and have the feature that everyone seems to want these days -- noise canceling. And, of course, there are a growing number of other excellent earbuds at around $180 that also have that feature.\nI'd personally pay the extra $50 for these over the AirPods 2, but I can see where things might get more complicated if the AirPods 2 were to drop to $80 or $90 during flash sales, which seems likely. At that price, they remain a good option for kids or folks who value them for their voice-calling capabilities, convenient Apple features and lightweight design. But I found it hard to go back to the second-generation AirPods after trying these."

      "text": "Pros\n- More refined sound and even better noise canceling\n- Slightly more comfortable\n- Best-in-class voice call quality\n- Pairs with two devices at the same time\nCons\n- Higher price tag than previous model\n- Larger carrying case\nWhen you have a product that a lot of people love, change can be risky. Such is the case for Sony's WH-1000XM5, the fifth generation of the 1000X series headphones, which were first released in 2016 as the MDR-1000X Wireless and have become increasingly popular as they've improved with each generation. Over the years, Sony has made some tweaks to the design, but nothing as dramatic as what it's done with the WH-1000XM5. Other than the higher $400 (\u00a3380, AU$650) price tag, I think those changes are good -- and the WH-1000XM5 has one key upgrade that's legitimately awesome -- but some may disagree.\nDesign changes\nThe first thing you'll notice is that XM5 -- I refer to it as the Mark 5 -- has a new design with big changes to the design of the headband. Gone is the dual-hinge of previous models and now there's just a single hinge with a swivel and rocker. That means these fold flat but they don't fold up. They also come with a new carrying case that looks to be about 20% bigger than that of the previous model.\nThat's disappointing, but the good news is the XM5 weighs 4 grams less than the XM4, tipping the scales at a relatively svelte 250 grams. They're also more comfortable to wear. They fit my head snugly but don't have that overly clamped feeling.\nI happened to have a trip to France planned before I got my hands on a review sample, so I was able to test these on a transatlantic flight. I basically wore them for 8 hours straight, only taking them off for bathroom breaks. They have the same battery life as the previous model -- up to 30 hours, with a quick charge feature that gives you 3 hours of juice from a 3-minute charge. But, as I said, they're more comfortable.\nThey also feature new synthetic leather ear pads that seem more durable than to the pads on the XM4. I could be wrong but I thought they breathed better. But as with any over-ear headphones, your ears are going to steam up if you wear them around when it's hot outside.\nThere doesn't seem to be any metal in the headband but the plastic appears to be pretty high-tech and I spent some time contorting and twisting the headband and nothing snapped. The headphones come in two colors -- black and silver -- though the silver looks more like a sand color. They both have nice matte finishes that don't show fingerprints. Aside from the larger case, I personally prefer the new design of the XM5. But I'm sure there will be people who favor the XM4.\nSimilar features but some upgrades\nSony's headphones are packed with features and the MX5's feature set is similar to that of its predecessor. From the beginning, the 1000X's signature extra feature was Sony's Quick Attention mode. If you hold your hand over the right ear cup, it pauses whatever audio you're listening to and lets sound in so you can quickly have a conversation then go right back to what you were listening to. Also, if you take the headphones off your head, your music will pause then resume when you put them back on.\nThese also have Sony's Speak-To-Chat mode that's essentially hands-free Quick Attention. If someone comes up to you and wants to chat, you can simply start talking -- say, \"Hey, what's up?\" -- and your audio pauses and the headphones go into ambient mode. The audio then resumes after a short period of time -- anywhere from 5 seconds to 30 seconds, depending on your preference. Or you can manually resume it by touching the ear cup.\nThe touch controls work quite well. You swipe forward across the ear cup to advance tracks forward and swipe back to go to the previous track. Swiping up raises volume, swiping down lowers it.\nThe Sony WH-1000XM5 have Bluetooth 5.2 and are powered by both Sony's QN1 and V1 chips, giving this headphone dual processors compared to the single processor of the XM4. According to Sony, that helps with noise canceling and noise reduction during calls. And these have double the number of microphones for noise cancellation, as well as what appears to be additional microphones dedicated to voice calling. Sony won't say how many beam-forming microphones the XM4 has, but it says the XM5 has four of them. So one of the biggest upgrades is to the microphone configuration.\nThe noise canceling function was excellent with the XM4 and now it's even better with the XM5. That said, I didn't notice a real difference on my plane ride. Both models seem to do equally well with lower frequencies. But according to Sony, these do better when muffling higher frequencies and I did notice some small differences walking around the streets of New York. For instance, people's voices seemed to be more muffled.\nI should also note that with the XM4 you had to manually engage the \"noise-canceling optimizer\" feature. With this model, the optimizer feature is automatically engaged and the adaptive noise cancellation does seem smoother and more seamless. There's almost no perceptible hiss, unlike with the XM4.\nYou can manually toggle between noise canceling and an ambient mode that lets sound in -- this is what Apple calls a transparency mode. And while the noise canceling levels aren't manually adjustable, you can adjust the amount of ambient sound you want to let in. When you set it at the highest ambient sound level, it does go a bit past transparency and actually augments sounds from the outside world. As I type this with ambient sound set to 20, for example, my key taps sound more pronounced than what I'd normally hear with no headphones on.\nI'm not going to go through all the features -- there are things like an adaptive sound mode, an ear-shape analyzer, plus support for Sony's 360 Reality virtual surround audio format for music, which is available with certain music services. I've highlighted what I think is the key stuff.\nThat also includes EQ settings in the app that you're probably going to end up playing around with, especially if you're used to the sound of the XM4 and even the XM3. Again, aside from their higher price tag, the biggest point of contention with these headphones will be their sound. Sony has equipped the XM5 with new more rigid 30mm carbon fiber drivers and these do sound markedly different from the two previous models. They have more of an audiophile sound profile with slightly more balanced, accurate sound, better clarity and a bit tighter bass.\nSound comparison\nGoing back and forth between the XM4 and XM5, I noticed that the XM4 plays a little louder at the same volume level on my phone and is more forward and aggressive sounding. It does have 40mm drivers and I can see some people preferring its bolder, slightly more exciting sound, especially if you listen to a lot of hip-hop and bass-heavy tracks. That said, the XM5 does produce deep bass with plenty of kick. However, the XM4's bass can come across with a bit more gravitas. It's not exactly a quantity over quality situation, but the bass of the XM5 is more reserved but has better definition, which is what I like.\nAnd overall I preferred the more refined sound of the XM5 -- I do think it's an excellent sounding headphone -- but I suspect some reviewers may feel the headphones should offer a bigger perceived jump in sound quality based on their $400 price tag. That's $50 more than what the XM4 started out at. But you can frequently find that model for around $280 or less and I do expect to see some discounts on this new model in the not-so-distant future.\nWhile the changes to the XM5's sound might not please everybody, I appreciated that they sound different from the M4 and I like the direction Sony's taken the sound. The fact is that if you didn't have the M4 to compare them to, you'd simply think they sound smooth and accurate, the way a good pair of headphones is supposed to sound. You have to listen to them a bit more, and with a variety of music, to fully appreciate them.\nThe added clarity and detail is particularly beneficial on tracks where you have several instruments playing at the same time (rock music, for instance). You can hear each instrument more distinctly compared to the XM4. The soundstages of the two headphones are similar -- they're both pretty spacious -- but you may have to take up the volume on the XM5 to get more of a visceral listening experience. That said, there's nothing wrong with the XM5's volume: These headphones play plenty loud and don't distort at higher volumes.\nLike the XM4, these headphones support Sony's \"high-definition\" LDAC audio codec, which is available for streaming over a number of Android devices and certain dedicated music players. I wirelessly streamed music using an iPhone 13 Pro and a couple of Android phones. The Qobuz music service offers high-resolution tracks with Bluetooth streaming on Android devices (with LDAC or AptX Adaptive) and computers via a wired connection. Either scenario is supposed to get you to near lossless audio and I did notice an uptick in sound quality when I went with LDAC or used the headphones in wired mode with the included cable on a computer. I didn't use a headphone amp, but that is an option.\nIf you're listening in wired mode, there's a touch more depth and texture to the music. That said, I felt the difference in sound quality was bigger when I used the AirPods Max in wired mode with an Apple cable you have to purchase separately (no, Apple doesn't include it). The jump in sound quality was even bigger with those headphones, which don't have LDAC support for Bluetooth streaming.\nWhile the AirPods Max are made out of more premium materials, the Sony WH-1000XM5's are significantly lighter and the better value. I'd lean toward taking the XM5 over the AirPods Max, even with the AirPods Max on sale (they're selling now for $479 but have dipped to lower prices in certain colors).\nCracking the code for call quality\nI'll finish with what I think is the XM5's biggest improvement over the XM4. And that's voice call quality. It took Sony five tries, but it's finally cracked the code on noise reduction during calls. These are truly impressive when it comes to calling in noisy environments.\nIn my test calls, almost every caller said they thought I was calling from a quiet room indoors. They couldn't believe I was standing in the noisy streets of New York with traffic rushing by and some wind in the mix. As I said, these have four beam-forming microphones for voice calls and Sony's engineers have come up with some nifty AI (software algorithms) to isolate your voice while blocking a lot of background noise (you'll still hear car horns and kids shouting). I was impressed with the call quality of Sony's new LinkBuds earbuds, but the XM5 takes things to another level for voice calls.\nLike the XM4, these headphones have multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can pair them with two devices at the same time and switch back and forth between them. It's an important feature for some people, particularly those of us who like to simultaneously pair our phones and computers while working from home.\nFinal thoughts\nThat's really the Sony WH-1000XM5 in a nutshell. As I said, there's going to be some debate over single-hinge vs. dual-hinge designs and whether the XM4 or XM5 sounds better (I think the XM5 does). But beyond those discussions, the XM5 has some clear upgrades, including a voice-calling experience that's arguably best-in-class. For those of you who already own the XM4, that's really the biggest reason to upgrade to the XM5.\nIf you're just looking for a new pair of noise-canceling headphones, I do think the XM5 keeps Sony right at the top of the category and, if you can afford them, I'd take these over Bose's Noise Canceling 700 Headphones and the QuietComfort 45. Those Bose models are both excellent but the Sony XM5 headphones are the stronger overall package thanks to their impressive feature set, excellent sound and much improved voice calling."

      "text": "Pros\n- Lightweight design with integrated wingtip that fits securely and comfortably in your ear\n- Very good sound\n- Effective noise canceling and excellent transparency mode\n- Better battery life than AirPods Pro\n- Powered by Apple's H1 chip, so they have most of the features AirPods Pro, including spatial audio\n- Beats app for Android users\nCons\n- No wireless charging\n- Currently no enhanced My Find with proximity view (only standard Find My)\nEditor's note, Dec. 8: This review has been updated to note that the Beats Fit Pro earbuds have been awarded a CNET Editors' Choice Award. The review is otherwise largely unchanged from the version originally published Nov. 1, 2021.\nReleased just a few days after the debut of the third-gen AirPods, Apple has another new set of earbuds, this time from its subsidiary audio company, Beats. Technically, the new Beats Fit Pro ($200) aren't AirPods, but they're built on the same tech platform as Apple's 2019 true-wireless model. Unlike Beats' earlier and less expensive Studio Buds, the Beats Fit Pro include Apple's H1 chip and have most of the AirPods Pro's features, including active noise canceling, spatial audio and Adaptive EQ. I'd venture to call them the sports AirPods you've always wanted. And for some people, they might just be better than the AirPods Pro -- which is why we'veAirPods you've always wanted awarded them the CNET Editors' Choice Award in 2021.\nThe Beats Fit Pro are officially debuting today, but if they look familiar, it's because they've leaked twice in the past few weeks -- first during an iOS update and more recently, when Kim Kardashian was spotted wearing them.\nThe concept behind the Fit Pro is pretty simple. Take Beats iconic Powerbeats Pro sports buds with its big ear hook and shrink it down. I can't say I ever loved the Powerbeats Pro's design but a lot of people do because the ear hook gives you a feeling of security that your buds aren't going to fall off your head. I personally prefer my sports buds to have a wingtip that fits into the inside of your ear rather than wrap around the outside of it. And that's what we have here.\nMost of the time those wingtips -- or sports fins as they're sometimes called -- are removable and often come in different sizes. But what's interesting with the Fit Pro is that it's a one-size-fits-all wingtip that's been integrated into the design. You can't replace it as far as I can tell but it does seem durable and it's made of firm but pliable silicone rubber that's soft to the touch. The buds fit comfortably and securely in my ears and never felt like they would slip out, even when I ran with them (I never lost the good seal I had with the ear tips). I much prefer this design to that of the Powerbeats Pro.\nBeats earbuds have always had a physical control button -- which I like -- and the Fit Pros also have one. What's nice about it is that because it's an extension of the wingtip, it has a soft-to-the-touch finish and a little bit of grip to it.\nYou use it to control music playback and answer and end calls -- and a long press switches between noise-canceling and transparency modes. You can also program the long press to be volume controls on the buds themselves, a feature a lot of people have been asking for on the AirPods -- and maybe one we'll see migrating to those models now that Beats has debuted it to the Appleverse. These also have always-on Hey Siri so you can raise and lower volume just by asking Apple's voice assistant. You can also issue other voice commands without touching a button.\nThe buds are lightweight, weighing 5.6 grams each and are IPX4 water-resistant, which means they're splash-proof (same as the AirPods Pro and AirPods 3). They fit my ears really well and come in four color options -- white, lavender, gray and black. I'm a little surprised Beats didn't do red for launch, but I'm sure you'll see more colors next year.\nRead more: Best true-wireless earbuds\nBefore I get into features and performance, I just have a few more comments about the design. The one big complaint about the Powerbeats Pro is their huge case. The case for the Fit Pro isn't quite as small as the one for the AirPods Pro or even the Beats Studio Buds, but it's still compact and much smaller than Powerbeats Pro's case. In a bit of a nod to Android users, the case charges via USB-C not Lightning. However, it's missing the wireless or MagSafe charging found in AirPods Pro and AirPods 3 cases. That's not a big deal in my opinion, but you might disagree.\nBattery life is rated at up to 6 hours with noise canceling on and 7 hours with it off at moderate volume levels. That's compared to around 4.5 hours for the AirPods Pro with noise canceling on and 5 with it off (the AirPods 3 also are rated for up to 6 hours but they don't have active noise canceling). You can get an extra 21 hours of juice or around 3.5 charge cycles when the case is fully charged.\nVirtually the same features as the AirPods Pro\nAside from the lack of wireless charging and MagSafe compatibility, the only other notable feature currently missing from the the Beats Fit Pro compared to the AirPods Pro is enhanced Find My with proximity view that allows you to precisely locate your AirPods within a few feet of where they might be hiding. The Beats Fit Pro currently have standard Find My, but Beats has confirmed that it's working to add enhanced Find My and the additional AirPods updates that were part of iOS 15.1 in a future firmware update. But that won't include wireless charging, which would require a hardware upgrade.\nOne of the big downsides of the Beats Studio Buds is that they don't have Apple's H1 chip, so they're missing things like Apple's Adaptive EQ feature that detects how the earbuds are sitting in your ears and optimizes sound on the fly along, as well as spatial audio and auto switching between devices on your iCloud account. But as noted, these new Beats Fit Pro have the H1 chip on board, so you're getting an AirPods Pro-like experience with better sound and noise canceling than the Studio Buds, as well as a top-notch transparency mode that lets you hear the outside world in a natural way. As far as I can tell the noise canceling and transparency are at the same level as the AirPods Pro or very close to it. The noise canceling isn't quite as good as that of the Sony WF-1000XM4 or Bose QuietComfort Earbuds, but it's effective at muffling external noise. It's not adjustable, however -- the modes are noise canceling on, noise canceling off and transparency mode. And there are no EQ settings to customize the sound profile.\nTo my ears, these actually appear to sound slightly better than the AirPods Pro (which, admittedly, are two years old). Beats says they have custom 9.5mm drivers and I think they have a touch more clarity and the bass packs a little more punch and goes a little deeper. Subtle differences in fit can change sound quality -- more on that in a minute -- but I got a tight seal with both sets of buds and I came away thinking the Beats Fit had a slight advantage. Using the Qobuz streaming service, which sounds better than Spotify, I run tracks such as Imagine Dragon's Monday, Spoon's Knock Knock Knock and The Hardest Cut, Foo Fighter's Everlong, Holly Humberstone's The Walls Are Way to Thin and Silk Sonic's Leave The Door Open through the buds and make comparisons. The Beats are a little bit more dynamic. They deliver plenty of bass but it's not overemphasized.\nThe Fit Pro have wide soundstage but they don't offer quite as expansive or refined sound as the more expensive Sony WF-1000XM4 buds. While I'm not talking about a big difference in sound quality, the Sony just sounds slightly more natural and has a touch more detail that can better bring out the nuances in music tracks. But I think the Beats' sound will impress a lot of you. It's good. And these avoid distorting at higher volumes, which probably has as much to do with the Adaptive EQ digital processing as the drivers.\nTight seal is crucial\nOf course, just how good a noise-isolating earbud sounds is dependent on how good a fit you get. And I'll just point out that I got a decent seal with the largest size of the included tips (like with the AirPods Pro, these have an ear tip test that tells you if you have good seal). But I ended up switching them out for my go-to Sennheiser tips that tend to fit my ears best with a lot of buds, including the Sonys.\nThis is a little wonky, but a of companies include tips with a slightly recessed tube -- that's the part that attaches to the earbuds post (see photo below). But the Sennheiser's tube is flush with the outer rim of the tip so once you put it on the post, the tip extends out from the bud a few millimeters more. Those few millimeters and the shape of the Sennheiser tips created a perfect seal in my ears.\nTo be clear, the Beats tips fit my ears well -- and they should most people's ears well -- but I'm looking for the perfect fit when I test buds so I get the optimal performance for sound quality as well as noise-canceling, which can suffer if you don't get a tight seal. I can't tell how important ear tips are -- they can make or break an earbud -- and I just wanted to mention how a subtle design difference can make an impact. And unlike with the AirPods Pro, which have a custom tip design, you can basically swap any tips in. (Note that I tend to use third-party foam tips with the AirPods Pro to get a better seal. Foam tips offer a little more grip and I have no problems running with the AirPods Pro.)\nApple-only extras meet Android appeal\nLike the AirPods Pro, these Beats have ear-detection sensors with skin detection so they can tell when the buds are actually in your ears and not in a pocket, for example. They automatically pause your music when you take your earbuds out and resume playback when you put them back in (there is way to turn this feature off).\nI'm not going to talk much about Apple's new spatial audio feature with head tracking other than to say it's a nice bonus feature that allows you to get virtual surround sound when you're watching movies and TV shows on various Apple devices. Like I said in my AirPods 3 review, it's a neat effect with video watching but a bit more hit or miss with Apple music tracks with Dolby Atmos. It also now works with group FaceTime calls, which is kind of cool.\nThe Beats Fit Pro will pair with most other Bluetooth audio devices, but you lose all the extra features like spatial audio and always-on Hey Siri and audio sharing with other people who have AirPods. However, unlike the AirPods, Beats has an app for Android devices that makes their buds slightly more friendly to Android users. At least it's making some effort to appeal to the other side of aisle.\nFrom an Android perspective, the good thing about the Beats Studio Buds not having an H1 chip was that except for always-on Hey Siri, it didn't have those extra Apple-only features, so you didn't feel like you were missing out on anything. In this case you are, but Android users still might consider these anyway, thanks to their design, strong sound, good noise canceling and transparency modes and mostly good voice-calling performance.\nSlight step behind AirPods for calls -- for now\nYes, they are better than the Studio Buds and Powerbeats Pro for making calls but arguably not quite as good as the AirPods or AirPods Pro -- at least for the moment. According to Beats, they have 6 microphones, up to 5 of which are used during calls, a voice accelerometer helps isolate your voice and there's a wind-mitigation system.\nIn my torture tests in the streets of New York, they did a decent job reducing background noise but there were some subtle differences between these and the AirPods Pro and AirPods 3. Some people said they heard slightly more background noise with the Beats and didn't think my voice came across quite as clearly (perhaps that's due to the AirPods' stems being a little closer to your mouth). With the noise canceling on, I could hear everyone quite well, so no complaints on my end.\nIt's quite possible we get some improvements with firmware upgrades, but for now I'd have to say these are good for voice calling but a slight step behind both the AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro -- at least in noisy environments.\nBeats Fit Pro: Final thoughts\nThat said, for me, the Beats Fit Pro came out as the winner over the AirPods Pro. They're the sporty AirPods I've always wanted. I like the AirPods Pro a lot and have no problem keeping them in my ears. I can also see how some people like the familiar pipe design of the AirPods with their now shorter stems. And not everybody likes having the Beats \"b\" splashed across their earbuds. But the Fit Pro really do lock in your ears and if you get a tight seal they sound slightly better and have equally good noise canceling. Their battery life is also a little better and you're not stuck with the single \"AirPods white\" color.\nFor people who are a little worried about the size and fit of the Sony WF-1000XM4 and some the other top sounding buds, including those from Sennheiser, Master & Dynamic, Bowers & Wilkins and Bang & Olufsen (check out our full list of best-sounding wireless earbuds), the Fit Pro are a viable alternative that's a little more affordable and may be a more comfortable fit for your ears (I don't have a problem with the Sony's fit but some people do).\nIt will be interesting to see how much these hurt sales of the Beats Studio Buds and AirPods Pro. They're hard to compare to the AirPods 3 because if you're getting those, you're getting them for their open design. But I do think you'll see the $150 Studio Buds on sale more frequently. They've already been on sale for $20 to $30 off and I wouldn't be shocked if they head closer to the $100 mark.\nWhile the AirPods Pro list for $250, they now generally sell for around $200 and sometimes less online. So they're basically the same price as the Beats Fit Pro. I guess Apple wins either way if you buy one or the other, but it's funny to see two models from the same company competing directly with each other. Maybe it will bring out the best in Apple and the AirPods Pro 2 will be that much better when they arrive, perhaps as soon as next year. But for now these may very well the best Apple earbuds you can buy, particularly if you're looking for buds that lock in your ears."

      "text": "Pros\n- Small, lightweight design offers a comfortable, snug fit for a variety of ear sizes\n- Buds barely stick out of your ears\n- Good sound\n- Decent active noise canceling and great headset performance for calls\n- Compact case with wireless charging\nCons\n- Low-level IPX2 water-resistance\n- Missing a few features found on Galaxy Buds Pro\n- While Bluetooth audio works with iPhones, Galaxy Buds app for iOS isn't supported\nThe Galaxy Buds 2 earbuds are technically the third generation of Samsung's entry-level true-wireless earbuds, but their name makes sense. Introduced alongside new Galaxy foldable phones and smartwatches at Samsung's August Unpacked event, the Buds 2 are a departure from the original Galaxy Buds and the upgraded Galaxy Buds Plus, which shared a similar design aesthetic.\nThe Buds 2 hew more closely to the newer Galaxy Buds Pro and Galaxy Buds Live, both of which have eye-catching glossy curved designs and the same compact charging case as this new model. In fact, it's the Buds 2's design and fit -- they're 15% smaller and 20% lighter than the Buds Plus -- that makes them a potentially more likable alternative to the slightly better sounding Buds Pro. Available for preorder now and shipping Aug. 27, the Buds 2 ($150, \u00a3139, AU$219) come in four color options (graphite, white, olive and lavender) with a white charging case.\nLike the Buds Pro, the Buds 2 are equipped with active noise canceling. That means all the latest Galaxy Buds models now feature some form of active noise canceling, though it's slight with the Buds Live, which have an open design sans ear tips. While the Buds 2 look more like shrunken versions of the Buds Pro, I found them more akin to the Buds Live in that they barely stick out of your ears and are discreet. Because they sit more flush with your ears -- and have that curved design -- they also pick up less wind noise.\nWhile the bean-shaped Buds Live fit me securely, some people complained they weren't a good match for their ears. The same might be said for the Buds Pro. When I tried them, I had to use my own extra large ear tips to get a tight seal. The smaller Buds 2 should fit a wider range of ears -- Samsung says they were designed for \"all-day comfort\" -- and I liked how they felt. When I tried the largest of the three included ear tips, they fit snugly and comfortably. (A single Buds 2 bud weighs 5 grams while the Buds Pro and Buds Plus buds both weigh 6.3 grams.)\nI wore them for over 4 hours straight on a plane ride from Salt Lake City to New York with no discomfort. And even without the stabilizing rubber fins found on the Buds Plus, I was able to run with the Buds 2 without a problem. However, these aren't as sports-friendly as the Buds Pro, which are fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating. The Buds 2, like the Buds Plus, are only IPX2 sweat-resistant. That means they should be fine for lighter workouts, but there are probably better options for runners.\nRead more: Best true-wireless earbuds for 2021\nBass-forward buds\nThe Buds 2 have a similar sound profile to the Buds Plus. They're a bit bass-forward, which means they're warmer, more forgiving-sounding earphones. While the highs are a little more restrained (at least there's no sibilance), there's enough detail and the soundstage is reasonably open, though a touch less spacious than the Buds Pro's soundstage.\nSamsung didn't provide much detail on the drivers, only mentioning that they were \"two-way\" (they have a tweeter and woofer), but I thought the earphones were pleasant to listen to and tonally appealing, particularly if you listen to bass-heavy music. They'd work fine for all genres but seem a little more geared toward hip-hop and today's pop music. That said, they don't deliver the richer, more articulate and refined sound of higher-end end buds such as Sony's WF-1000XM4, Sennheiser's Momentum True Wireless II or even Samsung's own Galaxy Buds Pro. Still, most people should be satisfied with their sound in the same way that people are satisfied with that of the Apple AirPods Pro.\nSee also\nApp control\nIf you're an Android user, you can tweak the sound using Samsung's Wearable app with some equalizer preset modes, but I mainly stuck with the default setting. Note that the Buds 2 work with iOS devices -- and all Bluetooth audio devices -- but like the Buds Pro, they aren't compatible with the Galaxy Buds iOS app, which means you won't be able to upgrade the firmware unless you have an Android device. (After the Buds Plus and Buds Live, both of which are compatible with Galaxy Buds iOS app, Samsung seems to have given up on iOS users.)\nYou can also customize the touch controls in the app, and adding volume controls is an option. As with the Galaxy Buds Pro and Buds Live, the touch controls work well and are responsive, but if you fiddle with an earbud to get it to sit better in your ear, you can end up pausing your music. If you want, you can turn off the touch controls in the app.\nNoise canceling: Good but not stellar\nThe noise canceling falls into the good but not stellar range. Because the fit was so great for me, I got a certain amount of passive noise cancellation even without turning active noise cancellation on. With the ANC on, they did a solid job muffling cabin noise on my flight. But the Buds Pro are better at muffling noise and the Buds 2's noise canceling just isn't in the same realm as what you get from the Sony WF-1000XM4 or Bose Quiet Comfort Earbuds.\nAlong with the active noise canceling, you get an Ambient mode that lets you hear the outside world. It's the equivalent of Apple's transparency mode on the AirPods Pro, which arguably sounds the most natural of any ambient or transparency mode I've tested -- it gets closest to making it seem like you have nothing in your ears. Samsung has improved its Ambient mode so it sounds natural at the low and even the mid setting, though the high setting really does artificially augment the sound around you. However, the AirPods Pro remain the gold standard in the transparency department.\nThe Buds 2 are missing some of the extra features found on the Buds Pro like 360 Audio -- it's similar to Apple's spatial audio and now works with more Samsung devices -- and the ability to pause your music and shift from noise-canceling to ambient mode when you speak, so you can have a quick conversation while wearing the buds. They also have a proximity sensor, so your music pauses when you pull both earbuds out of your ears (most earbuds auto-pause if you only pull one out), and an accelerometer and gyroscope are listed among the specs, so they do have some premium features.\nAs with previous Galaxy Buds, there's also a low-latency gaming mode, and the earbuds will automatically switch between your Galaxy devices. There's no true multipoint Bluetooth pairing, however, for switching between say, a computer and your phone. While these support Samsung's proprietary Scalable codec streaming audio format for Galaxy devices and the widely used AAC codec, they don't support the aptX streaming audio codec that is supported with some Android devices. It's also worth noting that you can use the left or right bud independently as a single bud. (Some people like to use a single bud for making calls or just listening to podcasts or other audio in one ear.)\nDuring my testing period, I didn't experience any notable connectivity hiccups and my connection with the buds was generally rock solid; they're equipped with Bluetooth 5.2. I did one firmware upgrade shortly after receiving my review sample and you can expect Samsung to offer the occasional firmware upgrade going forward to fix any bugs and improve performance slightly.\nImpressive noise reduction for calls\nThe Buds Pro got high marks for voice calling and the Buds 2 also performed very well in my voice-calling tests. Samsung says that they have three microphones on each bud -- two outer beam-forming, one inner -- a Voice Pickup Unit and a new \"machine learning-based solution\" that Samsung says filters out a variety of distracting background noises.\nI made calls in the crowded and noisy Salt Lake City airport with people talking around me and the people I spoke with said they could hear very little background noise. They also said my voice sounded relatively clear and barely warbled (I could hear them well). In all, I thought these buds were solid for voice calling -- at least when it came to making calls using a smartphone. Your mileage may vary a bit for video-conferencing calls on your computer.\nBattery life is rated at 5 hours for music listening with noise canceling on (you get an extra three charges from the charging case, which offers USB-C and wireless charging) and 7.5 hours with it off. There's a quick charge feature that gives you an hour of play time from a 5-minute charge.\nFrom my testing, those numbers seem accurate, but it's worth noting that the Galaxy Buds Plus were renowned for their excellent battery life -- up to around 11 hours -- and the Buds 2 offer more average battery life. But these do have active noise canceling and are smaller, so some dip in battery life is expected.\nGalaxy Buds 2: Final thoughts\nAs I said in the intro, the Galaxy Buds 2's standout feature is really their design. Not only are these earbuds smaller and lighter than the Buds Plus and the line-topping Buds Pro, but they nestle in your ears nicely and are relatively discreet. In some ways they remind of the Beats Studio Buds, which also cost $150 and are compact and lightweight. The Beats offer good sound with decent though unspectacular noise canceling and transparency modes. While the Beats are more geared toward iOS and have hands-free Siri (the Buds 2 have hands-free Bixby for Galaxy users), they have a companion Android app and have crossover appeal for Android users.\nI like the Beats' physical buttons for controlling playback and changing sound modes. But the Buds 2 may be a little better for making calls and may fit some people's ears more securely. At the moment, I'd give a slight edge to the Buds 2 over the Beats Studio, but we're already seeing some discounts on the Beats Studio Buds and the Galaxy Buds 2 should also start drifting toward $120 (and maybe less) in the coming months, particularly with the price of the Galaxy Buds Pro already sitting at $170, or $30 off their list price. The Buds Plus should stick around for a while as a budget option and if you're thinking about upgrading from them, the Buds 2 do feel like an upgrade, just not necessarily a huge one, though the noise canceling is an appealing extra.\nThe Buds Pro are superior to the Buds 2 at least when it comes to sound and performance. But in order to get the best performance out of a set of earbuds, they have to fit right. And for a lot of people, the smaller Galaxy Buds 2 will be the better fit -- and better choice."

      "text": "Pros\n- Surprisingly comfortable for their weight\n- Impressive sound and build-quality\n- Adaptive noise canceling is top-notch and so is transparency mode\n- Good headset performance for calls\n- Spatial audio virtual surround for iPhones and iPads is a sweet bonus feature\n- Automatic switching between iOS devices on your iCloud account (multipoint Bluetooth)\nCons\n- Expensive, heavy and the smart case may be too smart for its own good\n- No cable included for wired use\n- Android users lose a couple of key features\n- People around you can hear what you're listening to if you have the volume up (they leak some sound)\nWhen Apple first revealed its new AirPods Max noise-canceling headphones, many people naturally balked at their $549 price tag (they're \u00a3549 in the UK and AU$899 in Australia) -- and their oddly shaped Smart Case. Personally, I wasn't surprised by their high price tag -- and yes, for most folks, it is high. That's because back in January I'd heard through a reliable source that over the years the engineers and designers working on Apple's long-running over-ear noise-canceling headphone project had produced some \"spectacular looking\" prototypes that were too expensive to manufacture without charging upwards of $1,000. So I kind of shrugged when I heard they were $549, figuring plenty of people would buy them anyway. And so they have: The first batch of AirPods Max sold out in all five color options, with online wait times stretching out to three months or more. (You may have more luck at individual Apple Stores, however.)\nRead more: AirPods Max: 8 things new owners need to know\nAre they worth $549? Ultimately, that's going to be up to you to determine. All I can do is describe my experience using them and let you know that they're excellent (though not perfect) headphones, with top-notch sound, rock-solid wireless connectivity and noise canceling that's arguably a touch better than what you find on competing models at the high end.\nI can also give you my impressions about how they stack up against those same headphones, specifically the Sony WH-1000XM4 and Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, as well as some other high-end Bluetooth headphones. But in a world where Audeze, Grado and Focal (to name a few) have long had audiophile headphones priced well north of $1,500 -- and few people are outraged that the latest Adidas Yeezy sneakers go for $200 or more -- I don't think it's fair to get too worked up about the price of the AirPods Max. Based on what they're fetching on reseller sites like eBay and StockX, they too seem on their way to becoming status symbols.\nThis review is based on several days with the headphones. I'm still evaluating battery life and wired audio performance (among other things), which may or may not alter the final rating.\nRead more: AirPods Max: 14 tips to master Apple's latest wireless headphones\nFull metal jacket\nThe first thing you notice when you open the box is that their build quality is like nothing that's out there in the $300 to $400 range. OK, there's some stuff that's close: The Bowers and Wilkins PX7 (down to $340 from its list price of $400) is sturdily built with an eye-catching design. I also like Sennheiser's Momentum 3 for its build quality (down to $280 from its list price of $400). Master & Dynamic's MW65, currently on sale for $400 (it lists for $500), is also unique-looking and made of premium materials. All those models feature strong sound quality but fall a little short on noise-canceling performance.\nThe one thing people may have a problem with is the weight of the AirPods Max. These are definitely heavy headphones, weighing 385 grams (13.6 ounces). By comparison, the Sony WH-1000XM4 weigh 254 grams, while the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 weigh 249 grams. Big difference.\nThey've got a lot of metal -- a stainless steel frame and aluminum earcups that are reminiscent of Apple's MacBooks -- and metal weighs more than plastic. I didn't drop them because you avoid dropping $549 headphones, but it's quite possible they could come away with a dent if they fell onto pavement (they might do OK with a wood floor). Of course, you don't want to drop any headphones on pavement.\nFor heavy headphones they're surprisingly comfortable, but I don't expect that they'll be super comfy for everyone, particularly those with neck problems. Personally, I thought It'd be nice if they were 20% lighter, but the way the headband is designed, with its mesh canopy, it takes a good amount of pressure off the top of your head, though I did find myself making small adjustments, moving the headband forward off the crown of my head. While they're big -- and some people just don't like to wear big headphones -- they seem to fit a good range of head types.\nTheir almost gel-like memory-foam earpads also stand out. They adhere magnetically to cover Apple's 40mm custom drivers and have a fabric covering, which makes them more breathable than your typical leather or faux leather earpads like those found on the Sony WH-1000XM4. As a result, your ears steam up less in warmer environments. You'll be able to replace those earpads for $69 (yes, that's expensive, too) and the AirPods Max's battery should also be replaceable, although you'll have to have Apple do it.\nFinally, I'd be remiss not to mention the swanky design touches like the telescoping arms and springy, pivoting hinges. There's no plastic creaking here. This is a well-oiled machine, minus the oil.\nAre they as comfortable to wear as the Sony WH-1000MX4 or Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700? In a lot of ways, yes. Like any headphones, certain people might have a problem with the Sony's or Bose's fit, but most folks find them to be very comfortable. I could wear the AirPods Max as long as both those headphones -- an hour straight wasn't a problem. But you are aware you have a pair of substantial headphones on your head. On the plus side, I do think the fabric earpads really give the AirPods Max an advantage in preventing your ears from getting steamed up, and they also do just fine as earmuffs in colder weather, though the aluminum is quite cold to the touch.\n'High-end' sound\nThe AirPods Max do sound impressive, like high-end headphones, with tight bass, natural mids, crisp highs and a wide soundstage for a closed-back headphone. Apple does have EQ settings (under Music in Settings) -- for Apple Music anyway -- and you can make some slight customizations to the sound profile. But I mainly went with the default sound profile across multiple music services which suited my eclectic music tastes just fine.\nApple's intention with the AirPods Max is to serve up a \"high-end\" audio experience or at least an approximation of one. The problem, of course, is serious audiophiles tend not to bother with wireless Bluetooth headphones or noise-canceling headphones. Bluetooth streaming has gotten better and better over the years and noise canceling doesn't impact the sound nearly as much as it once did. But to get the most accurate, pure sound, which is what high-end headphones are all ultimately about, wired headphones coupled with a properly amplified source that plays lossless audio is going to get you to the real promised land.\nThe AirPods Max are missing some audiophile features. They currently stream only AAC and not aptX, aptX HD or Sony's LDAC codecs, which are compatible mostly with Android devices. It's possible that support for additional codecs -- and additional features -- could be added in the future with a firmware upgrade, but for now there's just AAC. That's just fine for owners of Apple's devices, which these headphones are optimized for, but although Android devices support AAC streaming, there's been reports that they don't handle it as well as iOS devices. These do work with Android phones and Bluetooth-enabled devices, but you lose some extra features -- more on that in a minute.\nThat said, plenty of $50 earbuds support aptX, and just listing it as a spec doesn't mean all that much. There are other factors that are far more important to producing good sound, but it would be nice if $549 headphones did support more codecs. As it stands, Apple has something called \"Apple Digital Masters\" in Apple Music that are supposed to offer the best audio quality. A lot of the top hits in Apple Music are created under the program. You may be able to recognize very subtle differences when listening to the same track (at the highest bit rate) in Spotify versus Apple Music, but most people can't, or the difference isn't enough to care too much about.\nYou can easily tell the difference between the sound of the AirPods Max and that of the Sony WH-1000XM4 and Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, both of which are excellent sounding wireless noise-canceling headphones. The Bose actually has more of an audiophile profile than the Sony. It's a little better balanced and has smooth, even-handed sound and a little tighter bass. There are times when I like it better than the Sony. But the Sony has a lot of energy in the bass and that kind of energy works better with certain tracks.\nWhat you get with the AirPods Max is just clearer, more refined sound and basically no distortion at higher volumes -- note that while they play loud, they don't play incredibly loud. I'm not ready to say that the sound measures up to what you get from a pair of high-end wired headphones, say something with a planar magnetic driver (one of Hifiman's cans, for instance, the best of which are open back and leak more sound than the AirPods Max, which do leak some sound at higher volumes). But it's certainly a level up in terms of clarity from the Sony and Bose. They are more revealing, articulate headphones. After switching back and forth, I sometimes felt like I was listening through a screen door with the Sony. The AirPods Max also is more open sounding -- by that I mean it has a wider soundstage.\nNow, as I said, with certain tracks, you could very well prefer the sound of the Sony, which has all that energy in the bass, even if it lacks some definition, compared to the AirPods Max anyway. If you listen to a lot of hip hop, electronica and other pop hits, you just don't really need the AirPods Max. That's not to say that there isn't a lot of energy in the bass on the AirPods Max -- you can literally feel it at times in the form of vibration -- but if you're used to a little boomier bass and like the sound of a warmer headphone, the Sony is going to seem great.\nThe AirPods Max are more akin to the Beyerdynamic Amiron Wireless but have more bass. The Amiron Wireless also costs around $500, though it lacks noise canceling. The AirPods Max are a little richer sounding, but the Beyerdynamic has nice tonal balance and good clarity for Bluetooth. It's improved with some firmware upgrades but is a little too neutral sounding for some.\nYou take a track like Kane Brown's Be Like That and you'll immediately notice that the bass on the Sony WH-1000XM4 dominates the track. It sounds comparatively boomy compared to the bass on the AirPods Max. Now, if you're into bass, that could be a good thing. But the track comes across as more balanced and detailed on the AirPods Max, with a little more openness and texture.\nBillie Eilish's track Bury a Friend features very deep bass. Again, lots of energy with Sony, but the bass feels a little loose compared to the AirPods Max.\nWith higher-end headphones you find yourself visualizing fingers plucking guitar strings and you can distinctly hear each instrument. You get a little more of that with the AirPods Max, along with a more intimate sound, by which I mean you feel closer to the music. That may not be everybody's cup of tea, but you hear the difference on tracks like Bob Dylan's Man in the Long Black Coat, Marvin's Gaye's Inner City Blues and Stereolab's Metronomic Underground. I found the AirPods Max were the better headphones for rock: Rage Against the Machine's Take the Power Back and the Foo Fighters' Everlong come across cleaner and more textured.\nAnd no, the AirPods Pro, which sound just fine for most people -- they're good but not great -- just aren't in the same ballpark. But they're obviously a hell of a lot more discreet and fit in your pocket, even in a pair of tight jeans.\nNoise-canceling king?\nI got a little grief on YouTube for calling the AirPods Max \"the noise-canceling king\" without putting a question mark after the headline. A lot of people simply won't believe that Max's noise canceling could be any better than the noise canceling on the Sony WH-1000XM4, which I also declared the king of noise canceling when it came out earlier this year (no one seemed to complain about that).\nI'm going to stand by that assessment. The AirPods Max's noise canceling is arguably the best I've experienced, slightly edging out the noise canceling on both Sony's WH-1000XM4 and Bose's Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 . To be clear, these are very subtle differences, and the majority of time people aren't sitting around with noise canceling on without listening to anything, which is how you have to test noise canceling.\nAll three headphones are very close in terms of their noise-canceling performance. Where the AirPods Max have a slight advantage is with how much of a hiss they produce when canceling out noise. It's just a little bit cleaner sounding. There's a faint hiss usually associated with noise canceling and it's barely noticeable with the AirPods Max. I also thought the AirPods Max do a slightly better job with relieving the pressure sensation that some people get with noise canceling. The AirPods Pro do well with that -- they're vented to relieve pressure -- and so too are the AirPods Max.\nAnother observation: The AirPods Max adaptive noise canceling seems better than Sony's adaptive noise canceling. With the Sony, I often switch to fixed noise-canceling in Sony's companion app because when the noise-canceling mode switches (adapts to your surroundings) the shift can be jarring and noticeable. The adaptive noise canceling of the AirPods Max just seems smoother and less intrusive.\nI haven't used the headphones in a lot of environments due to the pandemic (I haven't been on a plane in a while), but I tested it on the streets of New York -- yes, there's still plenty of street noise -- and by a loud air-conditioning unit in my apartment, as well as near running water from a faucet. Again, the Sony's noise canceling is great overall, but from my testing, I'm giving the slight nod to the AirPods Max for reasons beyond their muffling powers.\nIf you're wondering how the noise canceling compares to the surprisingly good noise canceling on the AirPods Pro, it's not as big a difference as you might think, but it is a significant difference -- again, the nod goes to the AirPods Max -- and I do use foam tips with my AirPods Pro to try to get a tighter seal.\nOnly two buttons\nThe controls are really well implemented. There are only two buttons, both on the right earcup. The front button allows you to toggle between noise canceling and a transparency mode that lets sound in and makes you feel like you're not wearing headphones. It sounds natural, similar to the transparency mode on the AirPods Pro.\nThe second button is a bigger version of the digital crown that's on the Apple Watch . You use that to control volume and click it to pause your music, answer and end calls, and double-click to advance tracks. It's smooth and responsive and in cold weather, you don't have to worry about touch controls that don't always work, though, as I said, the aluminum on the earcups does feel quite cold to the touch. Apple doesn't list any water-resistance rating, but they survived just fine after I wore them in a snow shower for five minutes.\nI'm not going to go into too much detail on the specs. You can read about all that on Apple's website. They have a total of nine microphones, two of which are inside the ear cups to assess how you're wearing them on your head, with glasses or not, for instance (the noise canceling adapts accordingly, a feature that's found on the Sony WH-1000XM4). The ninth microphone is a beam-forming mic dedicated to picking up your voice with two other microphones during calls.\nThey do work quite well as a headset for making calls and are particularly good at reducing wind noise (callers did notice some background noise when I was on the streets of New York but it wasn't too intrusive and they could hear my voice well). Also worth noting: When you're in headset mode, you can hear your voice in the headphones so you can modulate your voice and not end up shouting. They're similar in that regard to the AirPods Pro , though those smaller earphones may be a tad better for making calls, at least outdoors.\nThere are sensors that can tell when you have the headphones on your head, and automatically pause your audio when you take them off or put them around your neck. Plenty of other headphones have this feature, including those from Sony and Bose, but Apple's version seems pretty high-tech. Apple says the AirPods Max have optical sensors, position sensors, case-detect sensors and accelerometers in each ear cup, and a gyroscope in the left ear cup.\nLike the AirPods Pro, these have Apple's H1 chip that allows for easy pairing and automatic switching with iOS devices you have on your iCloud account, as well as always-on Siri , so you can issue voice commands without touching any buttons. Apple says the H1 has lots of processing power for the on-board adaptive noise canceling and making your digital music sound better. These do pair with Android devices, but you lose some of the features, like always-on Siri and Apple's spatial-audio virtual surround feature with head tracking.\nBattery life is rated at 20 hours (at 50% volume) with noise canceling on, which is pretty good, though not superb (expect more like 16-17 hours if you play your music loud). And you get 90 minutes of playback from a 5-minute charge via the Lightning port. I kind of wish it charged via USB-C, but that's a small gripe. As with Apple's iPhones, you need to provide your own USB-C power adapter now -- there isn't one in the box.\nMy bigger gripe is that no cable is included for wired use. Like Apple did with the Beats Solo Pro , you have to buy a $35 Lightning-to-3.5mm cable if you want to go wired, say to use an in-flight entertainment system. I did play around with some cabled listening, plugging it into Sony NW-ZX100 Walkman and Sony NWZ-A17 Walkman with high-res audio on them. The audio does seem slightly more \"pure\" and uncolored (I mainly listened to Beatles and Talking Heads tracks for comparisons), but the headphones play louder in wireless mode and the Walkmans had a harder time driving the headphones than I thought they would.\nThe easiest way to listen to to high-res audio is to plug into a Mac or Windows PC and load up some FLAC files, which I did. Obviously, you can also listen to streaming services this way (and any other audio). The volume levels were plenty high on the MacBook Pro I was using and I did experience a subtle but noticeable bump up in audio quality going the wired route. The more I started plugging into devices, the more irritated I got that no cable was included. The fact is sometimes it's easier to plug into a device than pair with it wirelessly, particularly if you've got non-Apple devices that aren't on your iCloud account.\nNote, too, that the AirPods Max still needs battery power to deliver audio, even in wired mode; there's no \"passive mode\" available here. Also the cable does eliminate any latency, which might be a factor while gaming or with music production. I didn't experience any latency with video watching when streaming wirelessly.\nLike the AirPods Pro, these have Apple's spatial-audio virtual surround sound feature with head-tracking that creates a sensation of being in a theater (it's not a true surround experience but for faux surround, it's well done and fun to try). It's definitely an added bonus and differentiator from those aforementioned competitors from Sony and Bose. These have more kick than the AirPods Pro, so the virtual surround experience seems a little more visceral, but it's largely the same. Spatial audio remains impressive, but it's disappointing that it doesn't, at present, work with Apple TV -- only iPads and iPhones for now.\nControversial case\nI don't know quite what to say about the protective cover that comes with the headphones. The best part about it is that it's easy to get on and off the headphones, and adds almost no bulk to them -- so yes, the headphones take up a little less room in a bag compared to the Sony WH-1000XM4, which includes a traditional hard case. You can also charge the headphones when they're in the case, which is nice. And finally, the magnet inside the clasp puts the headphones into a deep sleep mode to save battery life, though there's some controversy about the headphones not having a power button that turns them off.\nSome people have complained that the AirPods Max can't be manually turned off. However, as Apple notes, if you set your AirPods Max down and leave them stationary for 5 minutes, they go into a low power mode to preserve battery charge (they do this immediately if you put them in the case). Also, after 72 stationary hours out of the Smart Case or 18 hours in it, your AirPods Max go into a lower power mode that turns off Bluetooth and Find My to preserve battery charge further. Apple didn't do a good job clarifying all this at launch, but after I posted my initial review, I was pointed to a web page that has detailed info on \"How to charge your AirPods Max and learn about battery life.\" This review has now been updated with that info.\nThe case does make your high-end headphones look like a purse or futuristic bra -- you've probably seen the memes by now -- which is kind of bizarre, and if you're a stickler for protection, the mesh headband remains exposed. It's pretty sturdy mesh but you probably want to keep sharp objects away from it. I don't hate the case as much as some do -- remember, people made fun of how the AirPods looked when they first came out -- but it seems easier to lose than standard cases and I suspect we'll see plenty of alternative third-party cases.\nFinal thoughts\nIf you equate weight with value, which was once the case for audio products (speakers in particular), the AirPods Max certainly feel like they're worth more than the Sony or Bose. The AirPods Max's weight, however, may also be viewed as their biggest weakness, even if, as I said, they may be the most comfortable heavy headphones you'll try.\nFor most, the Sony WH-1000XM4 or Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are the more practical choices and better values, particularly the Sony, which have dipped as low as $278. The Sony are warmer sounding headphones compared to the AirPods Max, but they still have great sound (as do the Bose), particularly for wireless noise-canceling headphones. It's lighter as well, and some people may find it more comfortable.\nSo, too, are the AirPods Pro. A lot lighter. And while they don't sound as good as the AirPods Max, lacking their overall clarity and bass energy (with better definition), for the majority of people, they're still the better bet. At least until Apple comes out with a more affordable over-ear noise-canceling AirPods model, which it inevitably will do, though it may take a while.\nBut if you are looking for a high-end experience, the AirPods Max deliver one. Say what you will about the price, at least they're different, and stand out in a very crowded field of wireless headphones.\nEditor's note, Dec. 15: This story updates the original hands-on impressions that posted here on Dec. 10 with more in-depth testing and a full rating."

But keeping them in your ears when the going gets tough can be difficult, and that's where earbuds with ear hooks really start to shine. We\u2019ve tested everything from the ultrasecure Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 to open-ear options perfect for outdoor workouts, so you can decide on your new earbuds. CNET\u2019s top picks will help you stay locked in and keep the music flowing.\nOur Picks\nHEADPHONE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $250 (save $101)\n- $295 (save $154)\n- $278 (save $70)\n- $280 (save $170)\nRead more: Best workout headphones\nBest sports earbuds with ear hooks of 2025\nPros\n- Slightly improved design and comfort\n- Impressive sound for open earbuds\n- Improved battery life\n- New physical control button\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\nWhy I like them\nShokz has released the second-gen OpenFit 2 with a slightly upgraded design, upgraded drivers that noticeably improve the sound quality, better battery life and a new physical control button. The changes don't seem huge on the surface, but the improvements are significant. They fit my ears more comfortably than the originals and have superior sound quality with more bass and better clarity. They sound excellent for open earbuds, at least in quieter environments. Read my Shokz OpenFit 2 review.\nReasons to buy\nWhile the Shokz OpenFit 2 are a little pricey, they're among the best open earbuds with ear hooks and feature a comfortable, durable design, strong sound quality (for open earbuds), good voice-calling performance and improved controls. Because of these traits I have them near the top of my list of best headphones and earbuds for runners. They also work well for bikers and anyone who doesn't like having ear tips jammed in their ears.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nYou can find cheaper open earbuds with ear hooks that may not sound quite as good, but they're pretty close and are a better overall value.\nPros\n- Improved design and sound quality with smaller case\n- Equipped with more powerful H2 chip\n- Good noise canceling\n- Excellent voice-calling performance\n- Heart-rate sensors\n- Strong battery life\n- Wireless charging\nCons\n- Some users may not get a tight seal\n- A few features missing from AirPods Pro 2\n- More basic Find My feature (no Precision Finding)\nWhy I like them\nThe original Powerbeats Pro were released in May 2019, so Beats has had a lot of time to plot how to improve the second generation of its popular ear-hook style true-wireless sport earbuds. And improve they have -- by quite a bit. Not only do they feature a new, more refined design with better ergonomics, but new drivers, a more powerful Apple H2 chip, a new built-in heart-rate sensor and, yes, active noise canceling for the first time in a pair of Powerbeats. And that noise canceling is quite good, as is the sound quality and voice-calling performance -- so long as you get a tight seal from one of the 5 different included ear tips. Read my Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 review.\nThese new Powerbeats Pro 2 fit my ears better thanks to Beats improving the overall ergonomic shape of the earbud and completely redesigned the ear hook -- it's 50% smaller and incorporates nickel-titanium alloy, so it's both flexible and durable. The buds themselves are 20% lighter.\nReasons to buy\nFitness enthusiasts like earbuds with ear hooks so their buds won't fall out of their ears during intense workouts. Typically, such earbuds don't offer the greatest performance, but the Powerbeats Pro 2 have many of the same qualities and features as the AirPods Pro 2 with very good sound along with strong noise canceling and voice-calling performance. In short, they're versatile, also performing well as everyday earbuds. It's also worth noting that while the Powerbeats Pro 2 have some Apple-exclusive features, Beats does have an app for Android users that makes these more Android-friendly than AirPods.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nWhile Beats has improved the Powerbeats Pro 2's design and ergonomics, they still may not be a comfortable fit for everybody's ears and some people may not get a truly tight seal from any of Beats' ear tips (I had an issue and had to use another set of ear tips from my collection). If you don't get a tight seal, you'll likely be unimpressed with the sound quality and noise-cancelling and may want to return them to the store you bought them from (try to find some alternative ear tips before you do that).\nPros\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Improved sound with more bass\n- Good battery life\n- Well-priced\nCons\n- A little heavier than Shokz models\nAnker's Soundcore AeroFit 2 open earbuds have been completely redesigned and look quite different from the original AeroFit buds, which also listed for $100. The second-gen AeroFit are not only more comfortable but look sleeker, sound significantly better and offer all-around improvements. The buds aren't as light as the Shokz OpenFit 2 buds and don't sound quite as good, but they cost quite a bit less and offer good all-around performance with augmented bass response. Available in multiple colors, they're a good option for those looking for ear-hook style open earbuds with a fairly premium design and good sound quality without the high price tag of top-end models.\nPros\n- Lightweight and comfortable, secure fit\n- Attractively designed\n- Good sound\n- Easy-to-use pinch controls\n- Decent battery life\nCons\n- Some competitors sound slightly better\nThe Nothing Ear (Open) buds may not sound quite as good as Shokz' OpenFit 2 buds, but they do offer very respectable sound, and I found them lightweight and comfortable to wear. (The overall fit and where the buds end up sitting on your ears will impact sound quality, particularly when it comes to bass performance.) Overall, the buds are well-designed and feature Nothing's signature translucent plastic on the exterior of the bud. They're IP54 certified, which means they're splash-proof and dust-resistant.\nAside from their design, I liked their pinch controls and slim, elongated case. Voice-calling performance was also good, though it can be a little harder to hear callers in noisy environments because these are open earbuds. Battery life is rated at 8 hours at moderate volume levels with an additional 22 hours in the charging case. While there's a bass boost mode as part of the equalizer settings in Nothing's companion app for iOS and Android (there's also a \"low-lag gaming mode), the buds can deliver only so much bass. But I was happy wearing them nevertheless.\nPros\n- Innovative clip-on fit\n- Comfortable to wear\n- Very good sound for open earbuds\n- Decent voice-calling performance\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Look may not appeal to everyone\n- Not great for noisy environments\nThe Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have one of the most unusual designs of any earbuds I've tested over the last several years. They literally clip onto the side of your ears, kind of like earrings, and their open design has micro speakers that fire sound into your ears while still being able to hear what's happening around you. At $299, they're somewhat overpriced, but otherwise, there's a lot to like about them, including a surprisingly comfortable, secure fit and very good sound quality for open buds.\nPros\n- Upgraded design from X10\n- Secure, comfortable fit\n- Slightly better sound and noise canceling\n- Improved battery life\n- Fully waterproof and dust-proof\nCons\n- Lack a bit of clarity\n- Sound is degraded if you don't get a tight seal\nThe Soundcore Sport X20 has some nice upgrades over Anker's original Soundcore X10 earbuds. They include an improved design, adaptive noise canceling, superior battery life, slightly better sound and multipoint Bluetooth pairing. Like the previous model, these have an interesting design with rotating swiveling ear hooks. They don't swivel as much as the X10's ear hooks, which is a good thing (they stayed on my ears very securely). I also liked that the charging case has a smaller footprint than a lot of buds with ear hooks.\nFully waterproof and dust-proof with an IP68 rating, the X20 has slightly larger drivers than the X10 (11mm instead of 10mm). As long as you get a tight seal from the included ear tips (you get 5 sizes), they're able to deliver good sound with punchy bass and good detail. They lack a bit of clarity, particularly at higher volumes (there was a touch of distortion), and the noise canceling isn't as good as Sony or Bose's noise canceling. But the buds are affordable and a good value overall. As for battery life, it's rated at up to 12 hours with noise canceling off and 7 hours with it on. Voice-calling performance is also decent, athough not exceptionally good.\nPros\n- Comfortable fit\n- Affordable price\n- Good sound for open earbuds\n- Good battery life\nCons\n- Design is a bit plain\n- Case lid feels slightly flimsy\n1More makes a couple of open sports earbuds with ear hooks. The Fit S50 buds are the flagship ($120) and feature a little better sound than the Fit SE S30, have a more premium design and are fully waterproof (IPX7 rating). I like the fit a little better on the step-down S30, which is IPX5 splash-proof (can sustain a spray of water) and costs half the price, making it a better value.\nThe case is bulky and feels a little cheap (the lid is flimsy) but the buds themselves seem sturdily built and the ear hooks are nice and flexible. They have 14.2mm drivers that output decent but not great sound (there's a bit of distortion at higher volumes), which is par for the course for these types of open buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. They're also good but not great for voice calling. A companion app for iOS and Android allows you to tweak the sound with an equalizer and you can update the buds' firmware. The buds are available in black or white and offer up to 10 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels.\nPros\n- Premium look and feel\n- Strong sound quality for open earbuds\n- Very good battery life\n- Good voice-calling performance\nCons\n- Pricey\nThe Soundcore by Anker AeroFit Pro are among the best open-ear \"air conduction\" earbuds, with a premium look and feel, and are comfortable to wear. (I had no problem keeping them on my ears while running or working out.) On the downside, they're expensive, but they do feature strong audio quality for these types of earbuds, with ample bass and volume, plus decent clarity. They're good for making calls (they do a pretty good job reducing background noise reduction) and also offer strong battery life, up to 14 hours at moderate volume levels.\nWhile they don't have ear-detection sensors, I liked that they have physical buttons to control playback and also come with a cord, should you want to turn them into neckband-style wireless headphones. It's also worth noting that they have a spatial audio feature and offer the LDAC audio codec for devices like Android smartphones that support Bluetooth streaming.\nAnker's standard AeroFit fit model ($100) has smaller drivers (14mm versus 16.2mm for the Pro), so it doesn't sound quite as good and also has a battery life rating of 11 hours. However, those buds are fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating, while these are splash-proof with an IPX5 rating.\nPros\n- Comfortable fit\n- Good sound\n- Loaded with features\n- Touchscreen in charging case\n- Built-in voice controls\n- Dolby spatial audio with head tracking\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\n- Case is a little large\nCleer's Arc 2 earbuds were among the best-sounding open wireless earbuds with an ear-hook design. Among this style of open buds, the new Arc 3 are still near the top for sound but other companies like Shokz and Bose have caught up and arguably sound slightly better. But the Cleer Arc 3 buds have something that other buds of this ilk don't have: a touchscreen LCD built into its charging case. It allows you to control playback and access the buds' features, including EQ settings and even use the case as a remote to snap a photo on your smartphone.\nIn fact, the Arc 3 are probably the most feature-rich open earbuds out there right now -- and they're fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating. They have built-in voice-controls to raise and lower volume and skip tracks forward and back as well as Dolby Atmos spatial audio with head-tracking. Additionally, you can nod your head twice to take a call or shake your head back and forth to reject it (this feature is referred to as \"gesture\" controls). And finally, they have UV light that sterilizes the buds when they're in the case and a step counter.\nWhile the sound can be a tad uneven from track to track and the buds' bass lacks a little punch compared to what you get with a good set of noise-isolating buds in this price range, they fit my ears comfortably and securely. They also offered solid voice-calling performance. They're a little expensive but the price seems to be creeping down a bit.\nPros\n- Improved battery life (up to 10 hours)\n- Improved voice-calling performance\n- Good sound quality if you get a tight seal\n- Fully waterproof\nCons\n- Case is fairly large\n- Some people may not be able to get a tight seal\nJBL has upgraded its ear-hook style sport earbuds for 2023. Available in black or white, the Endurance Peak 3 buds offer better battery life (up to 10 hours with four extra charges in their case) improved voice-calling performance and an IP68 rating that makes them fully water- and dust-proof. They also have an Ambient Aware transparency mode and Talk Thru mode that can automatically lower your music's volume level and open up the buds to the outside world. That means you can have a conversation with someone without removing the buds from your ears.\nThey stayed on my ears very securely during runs and I thought they sounded quite good, though they do have a bit of bass push (i.e. they have powerful bass). Just be aware that if you don't get a tight seal, sound quality will be significantly worse. Also, like other earbuds with ear-hook designs, the case is on the beefy side. That said, the buds do seem durable and if you get a good fit, they're an excellent and less pricey alternative to the Beats Powerbeats Pro. I also thought the touch controls worked well; I was easily able to toggle through the sound modes.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Good sound quality if you get a tight seal\n- Control with Skullcandy's voice technology\n- Built-in Tile Finding Technology\nCons\n- Case is a little large\n- Some people may not be able to get a tight seal\nWith so many new wireless earbuds and headphones being released on what seems likely a weekly basis, it's not easy for companies to differentiate their products in the marketplace. Skullcandy hopes its new voice-driven platform, Skull-iQ Smart Feature Technology, will do just that. Similar to the Apple AirPods' \"Hey Siri\" feature, Skullcandy's version allows you to say \"Hey, Skullcandy\" to issue hands-free voice commands without touching a button. Skull-iQ debuts on the sports-oriented Push Active, and the $100 Grind Fuel, which will be firmware updatable via the Skullcandy App.\nWith their ear-hook design, they're essentially a more affordable version of the Beats Powerbeats Pro and they fit my ears slightly better than the Powerbeats Pro. I'm not usually a fan of ear-hook style buds, but this is one of the better ones. The Push Active True earbuds are equipped with Bluetooth 5.2, are IP55 splashproof, have built-in Tile Finding Technology and are rated for up to 10 hours of battery life on a single charge at moderate volume levels.\nPros\n- Good build quality\n- Excellent sound for open buds\n- Good voice-calling performance\n- Comfortable fit\nCons\n- Don't fit all ears equally well\n- Somewhat pricey\n- Case is a little large\nBeyerdynamic is known for its sound quality, so it's not surprising the Verio 200, its first open earbuds with ear hooks, deliver top-notch sound with nice depth and richness. They have very good clarity and bass performance for this type of open earbuds and match the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds and Shokz OpenFit 2 for sound quality, and they may sound slightly better than those models depending on the fit you get. Unfortunately, how they fit your ears is the one big caveat about these buds. While they fit my ears comfortably and securely, they bent the top of my ears back a little so I looked a little funny wearing them. That said, they fit my wife's smaller ears perfectly.\nI should also note that they feature good build quality and voice-calling performance, but their feature set is somewhat limited (they support the AAC audio codec as well as the highest tiers of AptX, including AptX Lossless). I also found their touch controls a little finicky at first but then I got them working well by holding onto the outside of the buds as I tapped on them. These will be very good open earbuds for some people but not everybody.\nFactors to consider when buying sports buds with hooks\nBudget\nBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new wireless sports buds with ear hooks. The quality of value-priced earbuds and headphones continues to improve, so you can find good affordable sports buds for less than $75. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost more than $100 and sometimes more than $150.\nNoise-isolating or open design\nSports buds with ear hooks are available in a couple of styles. Some come with silicone tips that are designed to create a tight seal in your ear and keep sound out (they have a noise-isolating design). Others have an open design with the buds resting on top of your ears, firing sound into them. The noise-isolating style typically gives you better sound with stronger bass while the open design has the advantage of allowing sound in for safety reasons.\nFit and comfort\nIt's key that sports earbuds fit your ears not only comfortably but securely. They should offer a comfortable fit that allows you to wear the earbuds for long periods without any irritation. Since all the buds on this list have ear hooks, they should stay on your ears well. Some will fit your ears more comfortably than others.\nDurability\nYou want sports buds that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality and a good water-resistance rating.\nReturn policy\nIt's critical to buy your sports at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days and then return one.\nHow we test wireless earbuds with hooks\nWe test true-wireless earbuds based on five key criteria, comparing similarly styled and priced models. These criteria are design, sound quality, features, voice-calling performance and value.\n- Design: We assess not only how comfortable the earbuds fit (ergonomics) but their build quality and how well the controls are implemented. We also look at water- and dust-resistance ratings.\n- Sound quality: We evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing the earbuds to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment.\n- Features: Some great-sounding earbuds aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from noise-canceling and transparency modes (ambient sound mode) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears.\n- Voice-calling: When we test voice-calling performance, we make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the earbuds reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear your voice.\n- Overall value: We determine value after evaluating the strength of the earbuds against all these criteria and what the buds are able to deliver compared to other models in their price class.\nOther sports wireless earbuds we tested\nBaseus Eli Sport 1: The Eli Sport 1 can be had for around $80 (currently $49 on a discount). While they may not sound quite as good as some of the premium open earbuds out there -- there can be a touch of distortion at higher volumes with bass-heavy tracks \u2014 they sound quite decent for their modest price and I found them comfortable to wear. They look more premium than their price would indicate. They have 16.2mm drivers, are IPX4 splash-proof and are rated for up to 7.5 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds FE: Carrying a list price of around $100, Samsung's 2023 Galaxy Buds FE feature a single driver (Samsung isn't saying what size it is), three mics on each earbud and active noise canceling. They charge in a case that's the same size and shape as what you currently get with all of Samsung's latest Galaxy Buds, including the Galaxy Buds 2 and Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. And they look a lot like an updated version of Samsung's discontinued Galaxy Buds Plus earbuds, which also came with a set of swappable fins that helped create a secure, comfortable fit. Like those buds, the Galaxy Buds FE are sweat-resistant with an IPX2 water-resistance rating that protects against splashes.\nBose Frames (Tempo) (Out of Stock): The Bose Frames are one of those products you have to try to fully appreciate -- or dismiss. The concept is that you're getting a decent pair of sunglasses with a pair of headphones that don't actually go in your ears. Rather, integrated micro speakers in each arm direct a beam of sound to your ears. That design could be appealing to people who don't like having headphones in or on their ears and also offers a degree of safety for runners and bikers who want their ears open to the world.\nJabra Elite 8 Active: Equipped with six microphones instead of four, slightly improved adaptive noise canceling and wind-reduction technology along with a higher durability rating, the Elite 8 Active looks, feels and performs like a modestly upgraded version of the Elite 7 Pro and Elite 7 Active. Jabra is billing them as the \"world's toughest earbuds,\" and based on our tests (they survived several drops without a scratch), that may very well be true.\nSoundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS: What makes these Soundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS buds special is that they sound surprisingly good for open earbuds -- they're pretty close to what you get from Apple's AirPods 3 for sound. On top of that, they support Sony's LDAC audio codec for devices that offer it. Not too many cheap open earbuds have good sound, but these Soundpeats have good bass response and clarity. They're also good for making calls and have a low-latency gaming mode. Battery life is rated at 5 hours at moderate volume levels, and these are IPX4 splash-proof."

      "text": "Pros\n- Innovative clip-on fit\n- Comfortable to wear\n- Very good sound for open earbuds\n- Decent voice-calling performance\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Look may not appeal to everyone\n- Not great for noisy environments\nThe Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have one of the most unique and unusual designs of any earbuds I've seen over the last several years. They literally clip onto the side of your ears and feature an open design with micro speakers that fire sound into your ears while still being able to hear what's happening around you. At $299, they're overpriced, but otherwise there's a lot to like about them, including a surprisingly comfortable, secure fit and very good sound quality for open buds.\nThese aren't Bose's first open earbuds; it released the Sport Open Earbuds a few years ago. They were among the first ear-hook style true wireless buds to feature an open design, and despite sounding very good for open earbuds, they kind of bombed because they just weren't comfortable and had a kludgy charging situation. But Bose seems to have learned from its mistakes.\nDaring design\nThis is a decidedly different take on the open bud design, which you find with certain stick-style \"hard\" buds like the AirPods 2 and AirPods 3 and those with ear hooks that have a micro speaker that sits over your ear. The Ultra Open bud has two parts to it -- the barrel, where the electronics are housed, and the speaker driver unit -- and they're joined together by a flexible rubber joint. You put the barrel on the back of your ear and then wrap the rubber part around the side of your ear with the driver element placed over the opening of your ear canal. Several affordable clip-on earbuds are available for purchase at Amazon, but their designs lack the premium quality of this model, and the few I've tried tend not to sound so good. They are much cheaper, however.\nThe rubber joint feels durable, but I just can't tell you how it will hold up over time. I do think Bose, which is known for having good customer service, would probably give you a new pair of buds if it failed for some reason.\nThe earbud should sit at a 45-degree angle, Bose says, but you can slide it up and down your ear until it feels the most comfortable. You can also play some music while you're making adjustments because the sound does change a bit with the placement of the bud, and you'll want to optimize both the fit and sound quality, which is about as good as you're going to get for open earbuds.\nRead more: Best Open Wireless Earbuds for 2024\nI figured out how to get them on and off pretty quickly and after I got used to how they fit, I did find them quite comfortable. They may clip on but they don't clamp, and they are relatively lightweight at 6.4 grams per bud (by comparison, the AirPods 2 weigh 5.4 grams per bud).\nThe idea is that once you get them on you should be able to wear them throughout the day and somewhat forget that you're wearing them. That said, you may find yourself making little adjustments after wearing them for a while to alleviate any minor discomfort.\nWhile Bose isn't marketing these as sports earbuds, they're IPX4 splashproof and can be used for running, biking and in the gym. They fit securely on my ears and they're good for those who want to hear traffic around them while running or biking for safety reasons. I could see Bose doing a slightly more ruggedized version of the buds in sportier colors and calling them the Ultra Open Sports Earbuds. Regardless, it's not unusual for Bose to offer more color options beyond the black and white versions available now. The QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, for instance, are available in light blue as an exclusive color on Bose.com.\nThere's a control button on top of the barrel of each bud, and it's easy to find the button and pause your music with a single click if you want to have a conversation with someone or answer a call. You click it twice to advance a track or end a call and three times to skip back. You can also choose what happens when you press and hold the button down. You can either have it toggle through listening modes (more on those modes in a minute) or set it to access your phone's voice assistant.\nYou can also use the control button to raise and lower volume, but I found the double-tap-and-hold gesture to access the volume controls a little tricky to pull off. Maybe I need more practice, but I'd like to see the option for the simpler press-and-hold gesture to be mapped to volume controls.\nEveryone has different ears, of course, and people can be pretty particular about the types of earbuds they'll wear and how they fit. These are obviously designed for folks who don't like having noise-isolating buds jammed in their ears and want to keep their ears open to the world. True, plenty of noise-isolating buds like the AirPods Pro and the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds have a transparency or ambient mode that opens up the buds to the outside world, but the difference here is the ergonomics of the bud itself and the lack of a silicone or foam tip that seals off your ear canal.\nTo get some other people's reactions to the design, I did have others at the CNET offices in New York try the buds out (watch the companion review video to see their reactions), and they were mostly impressed with the buds' fit and sound quality. However, they were a bit turned off by their high price.\nHow's the sound quality?\nWhen it comes to sound, these are about as good as you get for open earbuds, which typically don't have the bass response of noise-isolating earbuds like the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. Bose says these have a larger 12mm driver compared to the 9.4mm driver found in the QC Ultra Earbuds. However, that doesn't mean they sound better or even as good as the QC Ultra Earbuds. You're just not going to get the same powerful bass, even if you get the driver to sit in an optimal spot in your ear. But there is ample bass, good clarity and some nice openness to the sound.\nBut, like other open earbuds, these aren't going to sound great in noisy environments because your ears are left open. I tried them in the subway, and yeah, I could hear my music, but it would get a bit drowned out by all the external noise, even with the volume pushed all the way up. In quieter environments, I would set the volume in the 60-to-80% range.\nBose has a feature you can activate in the Bose Music app (iOS and Android) that automatically adjusts the volume to your surroundings. I also had no trouble hearing callers when walking around the noisy streets of New York.\nAnother highlight: The buds leak very little sound. With open earbuds, if you play them loud, people around you are likely to hear what you're playing. I used these buds in a quiet room with people sitting about six feet away and they said they only heard a very faint sound coming from the buds. So that's a nice feature.\nImmersive Audio mode and battery life\nTo be clear, these are not noise-canceling earbuds, but they do feature Bose's Immersive Audio for music spatialization. That's the same feature found in the QC Ultra Earbuds and QC Ultra Headphones, which arguably have the best noise canceling on the market right now.\nAs with those models, these buds have head-tracking, so you can set the Immersive Audio for Still mode that fixes the sound or Motion Mode that follows your head movements. Engaging it does enhance the sound a bit from standard stereo mode, but I think it makes a more pronounced difference with the QuietComfort models.\nEngaging Immersive Audio significantly reduces battery life, though. The Ultra Open Earbuds are rated for up to 7.5 hours at moderate volume levels, but that number drops to around 4.5 hours with Immersive Audio on. The charging case provides an additional 19.5 hours of battery and has a quick-charge feature but no wireless charging option.\nVoice calling performance and missing features\nVoice-calling performance is very similar to the QC Ultra Earbuds. That is to say, it's good -- callers said they could hear me clearly. You could argue that the background noise reduction could be slightly better (in the companion video review, I have a sample of a voice call you can hear), but overall I was pretty pleased with the voice-calling performance.\nLikewise, the feature set here is overall pleasing. However, like the QC Ultra Earbuds, these currently don't have multipoint Bluetooth pairing, which allows you to pair the buds to two devices simultaneously. They do a decent job with manual switching between devices, but for $299, they should have multipoint. Bose has said it is working on adding the feature to both the QC Ultra Earbuds and this model, though, and I'd expect to see a firmware upgrade later this year for both that adds that feature and perhaps others along with some performance tweaks.\nThe buds are also missing ear-detection sensors. That means when you take them off your ears, your music doesn't automatically pause. You can use a single bud independently if you want, but some sort of auto-pause feature would be nice.\nIt would also be nice to have something akin to Sony's Speak-to-Chat and Apple's Conversation Awareness modes. When activated, those modes automatically pause what you're listening to when you start talking to someone. For this type of earbud that Bose hopes you'll wear all day, that's a convenient feature.\nBose Ultra Open Earbuds: Final thoughts\nAside from those aforementioned small gripes, the price is the only other concern. As unique as they are, $299 is a lot for these buds. I do think the price is a bit artificially high, so I won't be surprised to see them on sale for $249 and probably less during Amazon Prime Day and during the holiday buying season.\nThat said, if you can afford the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, you're getting an excellent set of open earbuds that not only feature top-notch sound for this type of earbud but an appealing design in terms of a secure and comfortable fit. I can't say everybody will like the look of the buds -- they do make you look like you're wearing earrings -- but they are innovative."

      "text": "Ahead of the launch of its new $100 Method 360 ANC earbuds in NewYork City, Skullcandy hyped the new buds as \"the boldest audio product of 2025, featuring a partnership you didn't see coming.\" Whether the Method 360 ANC are the boldest audio product of the year is debatable, but I was certainly surprised to learn that Skullcandy had joined forces with Bose to create what's essentially the budget version of Bose's $299 QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds.\nRead more: Best wireless earbuds of 2025\nI've been using the Method 360 ANC for only a day -- they're available now in five color options -- but I've been mostly impressed with the new buds, which sound better than most of the earbuds in this price class. From a design standpoint, they share many of the traits of the QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, with a similar shape and stabilizing \"fit\" fins, but they're lighter and lack the more premium finish and overall feel of those pricey buds. That said, they offer a similar fit -- and by that, I mean they're quite comfortable and stay in your ears very securely once you get the buds set up with the right combo of ear tips and fins (three sizes of each are included).\nMethod 360 ANC's jumbo case has plusses and minuses\nThe one glaring difference between the Method 360 ANC and Bose's QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, as well as the step-down Quiet Comfort Earbuds ($179), is the Method 360 ANC's charging case. It's big -- perhaps too big for some people -- and it's a little awkward to get the buds in the case. Yes, the case still fits in a pocket or can be clipped onto a backpack or your jacket. But compared with the charging cases of most true-wireless earbuds, it's pretty jumbo. It also has no wireless charging.\nOn the plus side, the case does have a distinct Skullycandy-ish vibe, and I like how it slides open/shuts and how the o-ring clip is integrated into the case. It also houses an ample-size battery that stores an extra 23 hours of battery life when the case is fully charged. The buds are rated for 9 hours of battery life with noise canceling on, or 32 hours total (with the juice in the case), and 11 hours with ANC off, or 40 hours total. I haven't fully tested the buds yet to confirm those numbers, but if accurate, they're good.\nSound by Bose\nSkullcandy describes the buds as having \"Sound by Bose,\" which involves hardware (a chipset and presumably drivers) and acoustic digital tuning. I don't know exactly what components the buds use, but they sound similar to Bose's QuietComfort Earbuds and have similar specs, although the QC Earbuds have a total of 6 mics (3 per bud) while the Method 360 ANC have \"four-mic hybrid active noise canceling\" (the QC Ultras have 8 mics total).\nLike the QC Earbuds, they're equipped with ear-detection sensors that pause your music when you take the buds out of your ears and resume playback when you put the buds back in your ears. I also thought the touch controls were well-implemented. They're customizable via the Skullcandy-iQ app for iOS and Android, where you can also play around with EQ settings to tweak the sound profile.\nBose's earbuds and headphones are designed to work well with a variety of music and offer generally smooth, punchy sound that's very pleasant for listening. While some premium buds offer a little more detail and clarity, like Bose's QC Earbuds, the bass on these Skullcandy buds has good kick to it without sounding boomy.\nI don't think the Method 360 ANC buds sound as good as the QC Ultras, which have a tad more depth and extension (they offer slightly richer, more detailed sound), but the contest was much closer than I thought it would be. It's also worth mentioning that the Method 360 ANC buds play pretty loud and sound better than any Skullcandy earbuds I've tested over the years. I still have to listen to them a little longer and compare them with some other earbuds in this price range before delivering a final verdict, but as far as sound goes, there really isn't much to complain about for the price.\nSkullcandy's best noise canceling in a pair of earbuds\nNoise canceling also seems pretty good, and you can adjust its \"intensity\" in the app along with the level of ambient sound you let into the buds when you're in the \"stay-aware\" mode. While noise canceling isn't part of the Sound By Bose program, a PR rep told me it was validated by Bose as meeting its standards. As with the sound quality, it isn't quite up to the level of what you get with the QC Ultra Earbuds or even the QC Earbuds, but it's respectable and more effective than the middling ANC on earlier Skullcandy noise-canceling earbuds I've tried.\nI found the voice-calling performance to be something of a mixed bag. In my tests in the noisy streets of New York, one caller said they could hear me clearly with little background noise, while two other callers said my voice warbled and cut in and out (I was hard to hear). I still have some testing to do in this area, but there are some question marks about call quality -- at least when it comes to what callers are hearing (I had no issues on my end hearing callers).\nAn excellent value for the moment\nI'll have my full review of the Skullcandy Method 360 ANC earbuds in the coming days. But aside from a few caveats, it's safe to say these buds appear to be a very good value. Note that Skullcandy refers to their $100 price tag as an \"introductory price,\" and that it could change in time as the situation with tariffs remains fluid. But a Skullcandy rep informed me that the earbuds went into production in January, so the company was able to get plenty of units to the US before the tariffs went into effect. While there are currently exemptions in place for smartphones, laptops and some other electronics, there are no tariff carve-outs for headphones and earbuds.\nSkullcandy Method 360 ANC key specs\n- Sound By Bose technology\n- Battery Life: Up to 40 hours ANC off (11 in buds, 29 in case); up to 32 hours with ANC on (9 in buds, 23 in case)\n- Noise-isolating, ergonomic fit: 3 different size pairs of fit fins and three sets of ear gels, leveraging licensed technology from Bose\n- Adjustable 4-mic hybrid active noise canceling (2 mics per bud) \u0192with customizable Stay-Aware mode\n- Low latency audio\n- Wear detection sensors\n- IPX4 sweat and water-resistant (splash-proof)\n- Skull-iQ App compatible: Choose one of 3 preset EQ settings or customize your own, reconfigure the button functions, adjust your Stay-Aware or ANC modes and more\n- Rapid charge: A 10-minute charge provides 2 hours of playtime\n- Clear Voice smart mic helps isolate your voice and reduce background noise during calls\n- Spotify Tap compatible\n- Google Fast Pair\n- Multipoint Bluetooth Pairing: Pair two devices simultaneously for easy switching\n- Voice sidetone for calls (hear your voice in the earbuds during calls)\n- Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio\n- Five color options: Black, bone, primer, plasma and leopard\n- Price: $100"

      "text": "A great soundtrack can be the difference between a strong workout and a poor one, and your earbuds could be the difference between the two. But keeping them in your ears when the going gets tough can be difficult, and that's where earbuds with ear hooks really start to shine. We\u2019ve tested everything from the ultrasecure Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 to open-ear options perfect for outdoor workouts, so you can decide on your new earbuds.

The changes don't seem huge on the surface, but the improvements are significant. They fit my ears more comfortably than the originals and have superior sound quality with more bass and better clarity. They sound excellent for open earbuds, at least in quieter environments. Read my Shokz OpenFit 2 review.\nReasons to buy\nWhile the Shokz OpenFit 2 are a little pricey, they're among the best open earbuds with ear hooks and feature a comfortable, durable design, strong sound quality (for open earbuds), good voice-calling performance and improved controls. Because of these traits I have them near the top of my list of best headphones and earbuds for runners. They also work well for bikers and anyone who doesn't like having ear tips jammed in their ears.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nYou can find cheaper open earbuds with ear hooks that may not sound quite as good, but they're pretty close and are a better overall value.\nPros\n- Improved design and sound quality with smaller case\n- Equipped with more powerful H2 chip\n- Good noise canceling\n- Excellent voice-calling performance\n- Heart-rate sensors\n- Strong battery life\n- Wireless charging\nCons\n- Some users may not get a tight seal\n- A few features missing from AirPods Pro 2\n- More basic Find My feature (no Precision Finding)\nWhy I like them\nThe original Powerbeats Pro were released in May 2019, so Beats has had a lot of time to plot how to improve the second generation of its popular ear-hook style true-wireless sport earbuds. And improve they have -- by quite a bit. Not only do they feature a new, more refined design with better ergonomics, but new drivers, a more powerful Apple H2 chip, a new built-in heart-rate sensor and, yes, active noise canceling for the first time in a pair of Powerbeats. And that noise canceling is quite good, as is the sound quality and voice-calling performance -- so long as you get a tight seal from one of the 5 different included ear tips. Read my Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 review.\nThese new Powerbeats Pro 2 fit my ears better thanks to Beats improving the overall ergonomic shape of the earbud and completely redesigned the ear hook -- it's 50% smaller and incorporates nickel-titanium alloy, so it's both flexible and durable. The buds themselves are 20% lighter.\nReasons to buy\nFitness enthusiasts like earbuds with ear hooks so their buds won't fall out of their ears during intense workouts. Typically, such earbuds don't offer the greatest performance, but the Powerbeats Pro 2 have many of the same qualities and features as the AirPods Pro 2 with very good sound along with strong noise canceling and voice-calling performance. In short, they're versatile, also performing well as everyday earbuds. It's also worth noting that while the Powerbeats Pro 2 have some Apple-exclusive features, Beats does have an app for Android users that makes these more Android-friendly than AirPods.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nWhile Beats has improved the Powerbeats Pro 2's design and ergonomics, they still may not be a comfortable fit for everybody's ears and some people may not get a truly tight seal from any of Beats' ear tips (I had an issue and had to use another set of ear tips from my collection). If you don't get a tight seal, you'll likely be unimpressed with the sound quality and noise-cancelling and may want to return them to the store you bought them from (try to find some alternative ear tips before you do that).\nPros\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Improved sound with more bass\n- Good battery life\n- Well-priced\nCons\n- A little heavier than Shokz models\nAnker's Soundcore AeroFit 2 open earbuds have been completely redesigned and look quite different from the original AeroFit buds, which also listed for $100. The second-gen AeroFit are not only more comfortable but look sleeker, sound significantly better and offer all-around improvements. The buds aren't as light as the Shokz OpenFit 2 buds and don't sound quite as good, but they cost quite a bit less and offer good all-around performance with augmented bass response. Available in multiple colors, they're a good option for those looking for ear-hook style open earbuds with a fairly premium design and good sound quality without the high price tag of top-end models.\nPros\n- Lightweight and comfortable, secure fit\n- Attractively designed\n- Good sound\n- Easy-to-use pinch controls\n- Decent battery life\nCons\n- Some competitors sound slightly better\nThe Nothing Ear (Open) buds may not sound quite as good as Shokz' OpenFit 2 buds, but they do offer very respectable sound, and I found them lightweight and comfortable to wear. (The overall fit and where the buds end up sitting on your ears will impact sound quality, particularly when it comes to bass performance.) Overall, the buds are well-designed and feature Nothing's signature translucent plastic on the exterior of the bud. They're IP54 certified, which means they're splash-proof and dust-resistant.\nAside from their design, I liked their pinch controls and slim, elongated case. Voice-calling performance was also good, though it can be a little harder to hear callers in noisy environments because these are open earbuds. Battery life is rated at 8 hours at moderate volume levels with an additional 22 hours in the charging case. While there's a bass boost mode as part of the equalizer settings in Nothing's companion app for iOS and Android (there's also a \"low-lag gaming mode), the buds can deliver only so much bass. But I was happy wearing them nevertheless.\nPros\n- Innovative clip-on fit\n- Comfortable to wear\n- Very good sound for open earbuds\n- Decent voice-calling performance\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Look may not appeal to everyone\n- Not great for noisy environments\nThe Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have one of the most unusual designs of any earbuds I've tested over the last several years. They literally clip onto the side of your ears, kind of like earrings, and their open design has micro speakers that fire sound into your ears while still being able to hear what's happening around you. At $299, they're somewhat overpriced, but otherwise, there's a lot to like about them, including a surprisingly comfortable, secure fit and very good sound quality for open buds.\nPros\n- Upgraded design from X10\n- Secure, comfortable fit\n- Slightly better sound and noise canceling\n- Improved battery life\n- Fully waterproof and dust-proof\nCons\n- Lack a bit of clarity\n- Sound is degraded if you don't get a tight seal\nThe Soundcore Sport X20 has some nice upgrades over Anker's original Soundcore X10 earbuds. They include an improved design, adaptive noise canceling, superior battery life, slightly better sound and multipoint Bluetooth pairing. Like the previous model, these have an interesting design with rotating swiveling ear hooks. They don't swivel as much as the X10's ear hooks, which is a good thing (they stayed on my ears very securely). I also liked that the charging case has a smaller footprint than a lot of buds with ear hooks.\nFully waterproof and dust-proof with an IP68 rating, the X20 has slightly larger drivers than the X10 (11mm instead of 10mm). As long as you get a tight seal from the included ear tips (you get 5 sizes), they're able to deliver good sound with punchy bass and good detail. They lack a bit of clarity, particularly at higher volumes (there was a touch of distortion), and the noise canceling isn't as good as Sony or Bose's noise canceling. But the buds are affordable and a good value overall. As for battery life, it's rated at up to 12 hours with noise canceling off and 7 hours with it on. Voice-calling performance is also decent, athough not exceptionally good.\nPros\n- Comfortable fit\n- Affordable price\n- Good sound for open earbuds\n- Good battery life\nCons\n- Design is a bit plain\n- Case lid feels slightly flimsy\n1More makes a couple of open sports earbuds with ear hooks. The Fit S50 buds are the flagship ($120) and feature a little better sound than the Fit SE S30, have a more premium design and are fully waterproof (IPX7 rating). I like the fit a little better on the step-down S30, which is IPX5 splash-proof (can sustain a spray of water) and costs half the price, making it a better value.\nThe case is bulky and feels a little cheap (the lid is flimsy) but the buds themselves seem sturdily built and the ear hooks are nice and flexible. They have 14.2mm drivers that output decent but not great sound (there's a bit of distortion at higher volumes), which is par for the course for these types of open buds that sit on top of your ears and fire sound into them. They're also good but not great for voice calling. A companion app for iOS and Android allows you to tweak the sound with an equalizer and you can update the buds' firmware. The buds are available in black or white and offer up to 10 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels.\nPros\n- Premium look and feel\n- Strong sound quality for open earbuds\n- Very good battery life\n- Good voice-calling performance\nCons\n- Pricey\nThe Soundcore by Anker AeroFit Pro are among the best open-ear \"air conduction\" earbuds, with a premium look and feel, and are comfortable to wear. (I had no problem keeping them on my ears while running or working out.) On the downside, they're expensive, but they do feature strong audio quality for these types of earbuds, with ample bass and volume, plus decent clarity. They're good for making calls (they do a pretty good job reducing background noise reduction) and also offer strong battery life, up to 14 hours at moderate volume levels.\nWhile they don't have ear-detection sensors, I liked that they have physical buttons to control playback and also come with a cord, should you want to turn them into neckband-style wireless headphones. It's also worth noting that they have a spatial audio feature and offer the LDAC audio codec for devices like Android smartphones that support Bluetooth streaming.\nAnker's standard AeroFit fit model ($100) has smaller drivers (14mm versus 16.2mm for the Pro), so it doesn't sound quite as good and also has a battery life rating of 11 hours. However, those buds are fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating, while these are splash-proof with an IPX5 rating.\nPros\n- Comfortable fit\n- Good sound\n- Loaded with features\n- Touchscreen in charging case\n- Built-in voice controls\n- Dolby spatial audio with head tracking\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\n- Case is a little large\nCleer's Arc 2 earbuds were among the best-sounding open wireless earbuds with an ear-hook design. Among this style of open buds, the new Arc 3 are still near the top for sound but other companies like Shokz and Bose have caught up and arguably sound slightly better. But the Cleer Arc 3 buds have something that other buds of this ilk don't have: a touchscreen LCD built into its charging case. It allows you to control playback and access the buds' features, including EQ settings and even use the case as a remote to snap a photo on your smartphone.\nIn fact, the Arc 3 are probably the most feature-rich open earbuds out there right now -- and they're fully waterproof with an IPX7 rating. They have built-in voice-controls to raise and lower volume and skip tracks forward and back as well as Dolby Atmos spatial audio with head-tracking. Additionally, you can nod your head twice to take a call or shake your head back and forth to reject it (this feature is referred to as \"gesture\" controls). And finally, they have UV light that sterilizes the buds when they're in the case and a step counter.\nWhile the sound can be a tad uneven from track to track and the buds' bass lacks a little punch compared to what you get with a good set of noise-isolating buds in this price range, they fit my ears comfortably and securely. They also offered solid voice-calling performance. They're a little expensive but the price seems to be creeping down a bit.\nPros\n- Improved battery life (up to 10 hours)\n- Improved voice-calling performance\n- Good sound quality if you get a tight seal\n- Fully waterproof\nCons\n- Case is fairly large\n- Some people may not be able to get a tight seal\nJBL has upgraded its ear-hook style sport earbuds for 2023. Available in black or white, the Endurance Peak 3 buds offer better battery life (up to 10 hours with four extra charges in their case) improved voice-calling performance and an IP68 rating that makes them fully water- and dust-proof. They also have an Ambient Aware transparency mode and Talk Thru mode that can automatically lower your music's volume level and open up the buds to the outside world. That means you can have a conversation with someone without removing the buds from your ears.\nThey stayed on my ears very securely during runs and I thought they sounded quite good, though they do have a bit of bass push (i.e. they have powerful bass). Just be aware that if you don't get a tight seal, sound quality will be significantly worse. Also, like other earbuds with ear-hook designs, the case is on the beefy side. That said, the buds do seem durable and if you get a good fit, they're an excellent and less pricey alternative to the Beats Powerbeats Pro. I also thought the touch controls worked well; I was easily able to toggle through the sound modes.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Good sound quality if you get a tight seal\n- Control with Skullcandy's voice technology\n- Built-in Tile Finding Technology\nCons\n- Case is a little large\n- Some people may not be able to get a tight seal\nWith so many new wireless earbuds and headphones being released on what seems likely a weekly basis, it's not easy for companies to differentiate their products in the marketplace. Skullcandy hopes its new voice-driven platform, Skull-iQ Smart Feature Technology, will do just that. Similar to the Apple AirPods' \"Hey Siri\" feature, Skullcandy's version allows you to say \"Hey, Skullcandy\" to issue hands-free voice commands without touching a button. Skull-iQ debuts on the sports-oriented Push Active, and the $100 Grind Fuel, which will be firmware updatable via the Skullcandy App.\nWith their ear-hook design, they're essentially a more affordable version of the Beats Powerbeats Pro and they fit my ears slightly better than the Powerbeats Pro. I'm not usually a fan of ear-hook style buds, but this is one of the better ones. The Push Active True earbuds are equipped with Bluetooth 5.2, are IP55 splashproof, have built-in Tile Finding Technology and are rated for up to 10 hours of battery life on a single charge at moderate volume levels.\nPros\n- Good build quality\n- Excellent sound for open buds\n- Good voice-calling performance\n- Comfortable fit\nCons\n- Don't fit all ears equally well\n- Somewhat pricey\n- Case is a little large\nBeyerdynamic is known for its sound quality, so it's not surprising the Verio 200, its first open earbuds with ear hooks, deliver top-notch sound with nice depth and richness. They have very good clarity and bass performance for this type of open earbuds and match the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds and Shokz OpenFit 2 for sound quality, and they may sound slightly better than those models depending on the fit you get. Unfortunately, how they fit your ears is the one big caveat about these buds. While they fit my ears comfortably and securely, they bent the top of my ears back a little so I looked a little funny wearing them. That said, they fit my wife's smaller ears perfectly.\nI should also note that they feature good build quality and voice-calling performance, but their feature set is somewhat limited (they support the AAC audio codec as well as the highest tiers of AptX, including AptX Lossless). I also found their touch controls a little finicky at first but then I got them working well by holding onto the outside of the buds as I tapped on them. These will be very good open earbuds for some people but not everybody.\nFactors to consider when buying sports buds with hooks\nBudget\nBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new wireless sports buds with ear hooks. The quality of value-priced earbuds and headphones continues to improve, so you can find good affordable sports buds for less than $75. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost more than $100 and sometimes more than $150.\nNoise-isolating or open design\nSports buds with ear hooks are available in a couple of styles. Some come with silicone tips that are designed to create a tight seal in your ear and keep sound out (they have a noise-isolating design). Others have an open design with the buds resting on top of your ears, firing sound into them. The noise-isolating style typically gives you better sound with stronger bass while the open design has the advantage of allowing sound in for safety reasons.\nFit and comfort\nIt's key that sports earbuds fit your ears not only comfortably but securely. They should offer a comfortable fit that allows you to wear the earbuds for long periods without any irritation. Since all the buds on this list have ear hooks, they should stay on your ears well. Some will fit your ears more comfortably than others.\nDurability\nYou want sports buds that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality and a good water-resistance rating.\nReturn policy\nIt's critical to buy your sports at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days and then return one.\nHow we test wireless earbuds with hooks\nWe test true-wireless earbuds based on five key criteria, comparing similarly styled and priced models. These criteria are design, sound quality, features, voice-calling performance and value.\n- Design: We assess not only how comfortable the earbuds fit (ergonomics) but their build quality and how well the controls are implemented. We also look at water- and dust-resistance ratings.\n- Sound quality: We evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing the earbuds to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment.\n- Features: Some great-sounding earbuds aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from noise-canceling and transparency modes (ambient sound mode) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears.\n- Voice-calling: When we test voice-calling performance, we make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the earbuds reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear your voice.\n- Overall value: We determine value after evaluating the strength of the earbuds against all these criteria and what the buds are able to deliver compared to other models in their price class.\nOther sports wireless earbuds we tested\nBaseus Eli Sport 1: The Eli Sport 1 can be had for around $80 (currently $49 on a discount). While they may not sound quite as good as some of the premium open earbuds out there -- there can be a touch of distortion at higher volumes with bass-heavy tracks \u2014 they sound quite decent for their modest price and I found them comfortable to wear. They look more premium than their price would indicate. They have 16.2mm drivers, are IPX4 splash-proof and are rated for up to 7.5 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds FE: Carrying a list price of around $100, Samsung's 2023 Galaxy Buds FE feature a single driver (Samsung isn't saying what size it is), three mics on each earbud and active noise canceling. They charge in a case that's the same size and shape as what you currently get with all of Samsung's latest Galaxy Buds, including the Galaxy Buds 2 and Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. And they look a lot like an updated version of Samsung's discontinued Galaxy Buds Plus earbuds, which also came with a set of swappable fins that helped create a secure, comfortable fit. Like those buds, the Galaxy Buds FE are sweat-resistant with an IPX2 water-resistance rating that protects against splashes.\nBose Frames (Tempo) (Out of Stock): The Bose Frames are one of those products you have to try to fully appreciate -- or dismiss. The concept is that you're getting a decent pair of sunglasses with a pair of headphones that don't actually go in your ears. Rather, integrated micro speakers in each arm direct a beam of sound to your ears. That design could be appealing to people who don't like having headphones in or on their ears and also offers a degree of safety for runners and bikers who want their ears open to the world.\nJabra Elite 8 Active: Equipped with six microphones instead of four, slightly improved adaptive noise canceling and wind-reduction technology along with a higher durability rating, the Elite 8 Active looks, feels and performs like a modestly upgraded version of the Elite 7 Pro and Elite 7 Active. Jabra is billing them as the \"world's toughest earbuds,\" and based on our tests (they survived several drops without a scratch), that may very well be true.\nSoundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS: What makes these Soundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS buds special is that they sound surprisingly good for open earbuds -- they're pretty close to what you get from Apple's AirPods 3 for sound. On top of that, they support Sony's LDAC audio codec for devices that offer it. Not too many cheap open earbuds have good sound, but these Soundpeats have good bass response and clarity. They're also good for making calls and have a low-latency gaming mode. Battery life is rated at 5 hours at moderate volume levels, and these are IPX4 splash-proof."

      "text": "I'll lay it right out there: The degree to which you'll like the Powerbeats Pro, Beats' first true wireless earphones, will depend largely on how well they fit your ears. If you get a comfortable, snug fit with a tight seal from one of the four different sized included silicon tips, you'll probably love these headphones and feel OK about dropping $200 on them. End up with something less than that and you may question their worth.\nThe Good\nThe Bad\nThe Bottom Line\nI came close to getting a great fit. I would rate it between a B+ and A-. The issue wasn't one of security; I never had to worry about them falling off. With a few tweaks to the iconic earhooks -- they're bendable -- the Powerbeats Pros were essentially clipped onto my ears. I shot some hoops with them on and I suspect that they'd stay on even if I was capable of, say, a 360-degree slam dunk. (Alas, I am not.)\nRead more: The best true wireless headphones you can buy in 2020\nMy little problem: Even with the largest ear tips (yes, they're large but not quite large enough), my ear canal wasn't completely sealed off, so more ambient noise leaked in than I would have liked and sound quality was impacted in noisier environments -- like on the subway or the streets of New York. I was in the minority, however. I had CNET colleagues who were able to get a tight seal and not only really liked the fit but were immediately impressed with the sound.\nThese did fit me better and more comfortably than the earlier Powerbeats3 Wireless, which -- unlike the Pro -- have a wire connecting the left and right earbud. And, in fact, the Powerbeats Pro have been engineered to be compatible with a higher percentage of ears than past Powerbeats. That's because Beats, which is owned by Apple , refined their exterior design. According to Beats, the Powerbeats Pro are 23% smaller than the Powerbeats3 and 17% lighter. They're not rated as being fully waterproof, but they are sweat- and water-resistant. With an IPX4 certification, they can be splashed from any direction but could fail if sprayed with a sustained jet of water or are fully submerged.\nOne thing that's definitely not compact is the charging case. Although it isn't heavy, it's a good three to four times times the size of the AirPods charging case. It'll leave a pretty big bulge in your pocket, so you'll probably want to leave it in a bag or locker at the gym. Considering these cost $200, it would have been nice if Beats had thrown in a protective pouch to carry them around in for those times you want to leave the charging case behind.\nRead more: 9 tips a tricks to master Beats' completely wireless earbuds\nIt's also worth noting that the case doesn't offer wireless charging, as the new AirPods Wireless Charging Case does. However, it does charge via an included Lightning cable, which is better than Micro-USB. Beats' earlier BeatsX also charged via Lightning.\nBig sound upgrade from AirPods\nBeats says these guys use new upgraded piston drivers that are supposed to cut down on distortion. They sound significantly better than the original AirPods, which isn't that high a bar to clear, but the Powerbeats Pro deliver richer, cleaner sound with bass that's not only much bigger but tighter. As I said, a full seal is crucial to maximizing sound quality with these types of noise-isolating headphones, so if the tips aren't sitting snugly in your ear canals you can lose some bass.\nIn contrast, the AirPods have an \"open\" design and sit more loosely in your ears (though the newer AirPods Pro feature a noise-isolating design). They let in a lot more ambient noise as a result. Assuming you get that good seal, the Powerbeats Pro would be much better for, say, listening on an airplane than the AirPods, for instance.\nThe knock against Beats headphones used to be that they were too bass-heavy and that the bass was boomy and lacked definition. The Powerbeats Pro also accentuate the bass, but I didn't have a problem their bass performance. In fact, the bass is one of these reasons you'd buy this over something like the AirPods or Jabra's Elite 65t (or the Elite Active 65t). But I did notice some treble push -- sometimes referred to as presence boost -- that can make them sound a tad too bright with certain tracks. The BeatsX had the same issue, and while it may not be something regular people will be too perturbed about, audiophiles will probably take issue.\nThe Powerbeats Pro's sound is going to compare favorably with most other premium true wireless models, which can sound quite decent but ultimately don't measure up to a good set of wired earphones. That said, I thought the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless, which retails for $300, sounded better. It's just a little more detailed and smoother sounding. Likewise, the UA True Wireless Flash by JBL sound as good as the Powerbeats Pro for about $40 less. However, the Powerbeats have some advantages over both, including much better battery life.\nThanks to their larger design compared to the AirPods, Apple and Beats engineers have been able to incorporate a larger battery. The Powerbeats Pro are rated at 9 hours for music listening compared to 5 hours for the AirPods, and the charging case delivers 15 extra hours of juice. With the quick-charge feature, a 5-minute charge gets you an hour and a half of playback while a 15-minute charge will get you four and a half hours. The headphones automatically turn off when you drop them in the case and will go to sleep if you leave them sitting on a table.\nApple's H1 chip on board\nLike the AirPods, these also have Apple's new H1 chip that supports Bluetooth 5. That means Apple users get the same fast-pairing feature and always-on Siri that allows you to activate Siri by just saying, \"Hey, Siri,\" rather than touching a button. You can ask Siri to raise and lower the volume, and Apple Music users can tell Siri to skip tracks forward and back.\nNeedless to say, Siri features only work with Apple devices, but there's some good news for Android users: There are buttons on the earpieces that give you control of playback and volume levels. I thought they worked well during my two days of playing around with the product. Each earpiece has the same buttons, so you can control playback from either earpiece.\nIf you look closely, you'll see that there are optical sensors built into the buds. They detect whether you have the buds in your ears or have removed them, so your music will automatically pause and resume. Like the AirPods, each bud can be used independently of the other, so if you want to go with one bud -- left or right -- you can.\nThe AirPods are great for making calls, and Apple's engineers have brought some of the same technology to the Powerbeats Pro. There are two beam-forming microphones in each earpiece, along with a speech-detecting accelerometer that helps pick up your voice better -- whether it's for phone calls or talking to Siri. And like the second-generation AirPods, these are supposed to do a better job filtering out external sounds such as wind and ambient noise during calls.\nI thought they worked as well and maybe even better than the AirPods for making calls because they don't have an open design that allows sound to leak in (that makes them better for noisier environments). Callers said I sounded clear and they didn't have trouble hearing me when I made calls from the streets of New York.\nWorth the price?\nPeople have gotten used to spending $300-$350 on a pair of full-size noise-cancelling headphones, but $200 seems like a lot to spend on a set of true-wireless earbuds, particularly with the second-generation AirPods starting at $130 for the version with the standard charging case. However, as I said, if the Powerbeats Pro fit you well, you're going to be quite happy with them.\nYes, their large charging case is a notable drawback. But the combination of incorporating all the features that make the AirPods great while delivering richer sound and better battery life, in a design that won't fall out of your ears, is ultimately a winning proposition. Just make sure you buy them somewhere that has a good return policy in case you're in the small minority that has ears that aren't quite a match for them.\nFirst published May 2019"

      "text": "Apple makes some of the best wireless earbuds and headphones on the market -- and that includes models from Beats, which Apple acquired several years ago. Most recently, it introduced two new AirPods 4 earbuds, one with surprisingly effective active noise canceling for an open-ear design. While we're impressed with the AirPods 4 ANC in particular, the AirPods Pro 2 are arguably the best Apple AirPods you can buy if you don't mind having silicone eartips jammed in your ears. I've tested and fully reviewed all of Apple's headphones and earbuds that are on this list. We also keep a close eye on their prices so we can bring you the best deals on every AirPods model.\nOur Picks\nHEADPHONE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $250 (save $101)\n- $295 (save $154)\n- $278 (save $70)\n- $280 (save $170)\nBest Apple AirPods for 2025\nPros\n- Lightweight design, now with USB-C charging\n- Excellent sound and noise canceling\n- Powered by Apple's H2 chip\n- Strong voice-calling performance\n- Support for 20-bit/48 kHz Lossless Audio with Apple's Vision Pro headset\nCons\n- No support for high-resolution audio with other Apple devices except headset\n- Still no XL tips included\nApple not only swapped in USB-C for Lightning connectivity in its new iPhone 15 models, but it also made the switch with the AirPods Pro (second generation). The new AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe (USB-C) are nearly identical to their Lightning predecessor, delivering the same excellent sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance. That said, they offer some other small upgrades, including additional dust resistance and a new acoustic architecture that allows for Lossless Audio with the Vision Pro as well as the novel hearing aid mode to better hear the sound around you.\nNevertheless, the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are easy to recommend to Apple customers despite their high price. Pro tip: Don't pay more than $190 for these, which is the online sale price at which they're now frequently available.\nPros\n- Same H2 chip found in AirPods Pro 2\n- More compact design\n- Active noise canceling that works\n- Improved sound\n- Excellent voice-calling performance\n- Personalized spatial audio\n- Case has wireless charging and speaker for Find My\nCons\n- Battery life could be a little better\n- Noise-canceling isn't as good as AirPods Pro 2's\nIf you're looking for basic AirPods, the standard AirPods 4 ($129) certainly have their appeal and should cost closer to $100 during flash sales. They may not be quite as cheap or as small as the AirPods 2, but they sound a lot better and have more features.\nUltimately, however, the AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation are simply more special. They're the first open buds I've tried to have active noise canceling that actually works. That makes them the first noise-canceling earbuds for people who don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears. That's pretty cool and worth the extra $50 if you can afford it.\nPros\n- Lightweight design with integrated wingtip that fits securely\n- Very good sound and noise canceling\n- Powered by Apple's H1 chip\nCons\n- No wireless charging\n- No enhanced My Find with proximity view (only standard Find My)\nWhile the Beats Fit Pro technically aren't AirPods, they're built on the same tech platform as the AirPods Pro (yes, Apple owns Beats). Unlike Beats' earlier and less expensive Studio Buds and new-for-2023 Studio Buds Plus, the Beats Fit Pro includes Apple's H1 chip and has most of the AirPods Pro's features, including active noise canceling, spatial audio and Adaptive EQ. I'd venture to call them the sports AirPods you've always wanted.\nPros\n- Surprisingly comfortable for their weight\n- Impressive sound and build-quality\n- Adaptive noise canceling is top-notch and so is transparency mode\n- Good headset performance for calls\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Equipped with Apple's H1 chip, not the newer H2\n- No cable included for wired use\nYes, they're expensive, but the AirPods Max delivers richer, more detailed sound than lower-priced competitors from Bose and Sony. They also feature arguably the best noise canceling on the market along with premium build quality and Apple's virtual surround spatial audio feature for video watching. While they're heavy, they manage to be surprisingly comfortable, although I did have to adjust the mesh canopy headband to sit a little more forward on my head to get a comfortable secure fit when I was out walking with them. They should fit most heads well, but there will be exceptions.\nPros\n- Lightweight and discrete, they fit comfortably with upgraded performance all-around (voice-calling is excellent now)\n- Android friendly (iOS users get hands-free Siri)\n- Improved battery life\nCons\n- No wireless charging capabilities\n- Missing spatial audio\n- No head tracking or in-ear detection sensor\nWhy I like them\nCompared to the original Beats Studio Buds, which remain on the market, the newer Studio Buds Plus buds are significantly improved, with better sound, noise canceling and battery life. Additionally, they now deliver top-notch voice-calling performance. Read my Beats Buds Plus review.\nThe transparent version got a lot of attention at launch (who doesn't like transparent electronics?), but the big changes are on the inside. Beats says 95% of the components are new and improved, and the buds' \"acoustic architecture\" has been revised. The speaker drivers remain the same, but the Studio Buds Plus are powered by a new, more powerful custom chipset and have three new microphones in each bud, which are three times larger and more sensitive than the ones found in the Beats Studio Buds.\nReasons to buy\nThe compact Beats Studio Buds Plus offer good sound quality and strong all-around performance for an affordable price, especially when they're discounted, which they often are. It's also worth noting that like with other Beats headphones and earbuds, these are more Android-friendly than Apple's AirPods (there's a Beats app for Android) and the only feature that Apple users get that Android users don't is hands-free Siri.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nThe Studio Buds Plus were released in May of 2023, so they're over two years old and may be due for an upgrade. Also, while the AirPods Pro 2 may cost more, they have a more robust feature set -- for Apple users anyway.\nPros\n- Improved sound quality, noise canceling and ear pad design\n- Very good voice-calling performance\n- Spatial audio with head tracking for Apple users\n- USB-C audio\nCons\n- No Apple H2 chip\n- No ear-detection sensors\n- No major design changes except for case\nLove 'em or hate 'em, Beats Studio headphones are among the most popular headphones of all time, launching as wired headphones back in 2008. This is the fourth generation of them, and they carry the same list price as their predecessor and look very similar on the outside but have some big changes on the inside that make them significantly better headphones. I'm tempted to describe them as more affordable plastic versions of the AirPods Max. However, that's not quite accurate due to a choice in chipsets and one notable missing feature. But read our full review to find out what makes these very good headphones, albeit with some caveats.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Lightweight and comfortable\n- Very compact case\n- Good sound and voice-calling performance\n- Strong battery life\nCons\n- Few features\n- No battery or LED charging indicator in charging case\nWhy I like them\nAvailable in four color options, the Solo Buds are missing some key features found in more premium buds, including a battery in their very compact charging case, ear-detection sensors and active noise canceling. But they get the fundamentals right. They're lightweight and not only offer decent sound quality and strong battery life but very good voice-calling performance that rivals what you get with the company's more expensive Studio Buds Plus. Read my full review.\nReasons to buy\nThey're the most affordable Beats earbuds and their charging case is quite compact and doesn't take up much room in a pocket. They also have great battery life.\nReasons to skip/keep looking\nHaving no battery in the case may be a deal-breaker for some people (using a USB-C cable, your phone can supply power to charge the buds in the case, but not everybody likes that concept).\nFactors to consider when choosing AirPods\nDesign\nThe AirPods come in three styles: open earbuds (AirPods 3 and AiPods 4), noise-isolating earbuds with noise canceling (AirPods Pro 2) and over-ear headphones (AirPods Max). Some people like the standard AirPods because they have an open design and don't require you to jam silicone ear tips into your ears. Note that the discontinued AirPods 2, which are based on the original AirPods design, have longer stems and slightly smaller buds than the AirPods 3. The new AirPods 4 are slightly more compact than the AirPods 3 but slightly larger than the AirPods 2. Meanwhile, the Beats Fit Pro has built-in wingtips that may help you get a more secure fit. Newer models also feature USB-C charging ports to better align with the rest of Apple's new charging ecosystem, replacing the long-used Lightning port.\nBudget\nBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new AirPods. The quality of value-priced AirPods continues to improve as more models release, so you can often find good affordable AirPods on sale for less than $100. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost $300 or more -- sometimes much more in the case of the AirPod Max.\nFit\nIt's key that the AirPods you buy fit your head well. They should offer a comfortable fit that's snug yet not too snug. Ideally, you want headphones you can wear throughout the day with minimal breaks. Consider the differences between in-ear and over-ear AirPods before buying.\nDurability\nYou want headphones that hold up well over time, so look for AirPods models that we note have sturdy build quality.\nAirPods or Beats earbuds and headphones?\nBecause Apple owns Beats, the various AirPods models and Beats models can share similar components and features. Beats products tend to be geared to both Apple and Android users, while the AirPods tend to be focused more toward Apple users (they have more exclusive features for Apple users), although they can be paired with Android devices.\nReturn policy\nBecause the fit of your earbuds is so important, it's critical to buy your buds at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case the buds aren't a good match for your ears.\nAirPods price comparison\nComparisons for the prices of each AirPods model on this list\n| Model | Apple store price | Best price right now | Best all-time price |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| AirPods 4 | $129 | $119 | $119 |\n| AirPods Pro 2 | $249 | $189 | $169 |\n| Beats Fit Pro | $200 | $159 | $159 |\n| AirPods Max | $549 | $449 | $395 |\n| Beats Studio Buds Plus | $170 | $100 | $100 |\n| Beats Studio Pro | $350 | $136 | $136 |\n| Beats Solo Buds | $80 | $80 | $80 |\nHow we test wireless Apple AirPods\nAlong with all of our wireless headphones and earbuds, we test Apple AirPods based on six key criteria: design, sound quality, noise-canceling performance, voice-calling performance, features and value.\nDesign\nWe assess not only how comfortably the AirPods fit (their ergonomics) but also their build quality and how well the controls are implemented. With wireless headphones and earbuds, we'll note if they're water-resistant, but only a few full-size headphones have water- and dust-resistance ratings, which is especially important for workout headphones you may take to the gym or on a run.\nSound quality\nWe evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing headphones to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment.\nNoise-canceling performance\nIf the AirPods we're testing feature active noise canceling, we evaluate ANC performance by wearing the headphones in the same spot indoors near a noisy HVAC unit to see how well they do at muffling lower frequencies. Then we head out onto city streets to test the headphones in a real-world environment where we see how they do at muffling not only street noise but also people's voices. Those that are able to reduce the most amount of ambient noise are noted and rated highly on this list.\nExtra features\nSome great-sounding AirPods aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from quick-access awareness through a double tap to transparency modes (your music pauses and the headphones open up to the outside world so you can have a conversation) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears. The newest models even incorporate hearing health metrics with hearing tests and a new hearing aid mode. We also take a look at the companion app for the AirPods if there is one and how user-friendly it is and wireless charging capabilities.\nVoice-calling\nWhen we test voice-calling performance, we make phone calls on noisy city streets and evaluate how well the AirPods reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear our voices. Call quality is a key metric in today's work-from-home world, so we're sure to assess this feature in several fields.\nValue\nWe determine value after considering the strength of the AirPods against all these criteria and what they're able to deliver compared with other models in their price class. Some models require additional purchases, like a wireless charging case, to get the most out of their features, so we take those needs into account, too.\nOther AirPods we tested\nAirPods 3: With the arrival of the AirPods 4, Apple is phasing out both the AirPods 3 and AirPods 2. As a result, you may see some nice discounts on the third-generation AirPods as they exit the market. Slightly larger than the AirPods 4, they have better battery life than their successor and their case has wireless charging (only the step-up AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation have wireless charging). But with improved sound quality and Apple's more advanced H2 chip, the AirPods 4 -- even the entry-level model -- is superior to the third-generation AirPods.\nBeats Studio Buds: The Beats Studio earbuds often sell for $150 and offer decent sound and performance. The new Studio Buds Plus is a significant upgrade, with better sound, noise canceling and voice-calling performance, so we recommend users buy those instead.\nAirPods 2: The AirPods 2 are an incremental upgrade to an already excellent, fully wireless headphone, but sound quality, design and fit are basically the same. Such incremental upgrades tend to be a little boring. And on the surface anyway, the new AirPods aren't exciting. However, thanks to those updated components on the inside, including a new H1 chip that supports Bluetooth 5.0, improved audio synchronization and always-on Siri, they're definitely better in small ways that a lot of people will appreciate.\nBeats Flex: Yes, these are \"wired wireless\" earbuds -- with a cable connecting the left and right earbud, but they're also the most affordable wireless Apple headphones you can buy (Beats is a subsidiary of Apple). Equipped with Apple's older W1 chip, not the H1 found in the AirPods 3rd Generation, AirPods Pro and Beats Fit Pro, they don't have such extra features as spatial audio. However, they sound good and work well for making voice calls."

      "text": "Pros\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Very good sound and noise canceling\n- Good battery life\n- Case has wireless charging\n- Voice-control features built into buds\nCons\n- Buds and case are a little big\n- Voice-calling performance could be slightly better\n- Voice-control features are a bit hit or miss\nIn recent years, when it came to its new earbuds, Bose has focused on premium noise-canceling buds with premium price tags. But now it's released more affordable QuietComfort Earbuds at $179 (\u00a3180) for folks priced out of its $299 (\u00a3300) flagship QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. The new QC Earbuds, as Bose calls them, don't perform quite as well as the QC Ultra Earbuds, but they do offer strong sound and noice-canceling performance while adding a few features not found in the Ultras.\nIf you did a double take on the name of these buds, I did, too. And by \"too\" I mean that Bose released the QuietComfort Earbuds 2, the predecessor to the Ultras, a few years ago. And while Bose has now gone backward by naming these the QC Earbuds, the idea going forward is that this will be the more affordable, mid-range model while the Ultra Earbuds will be the flagship. This is sort of similar to what it's done with its full-size QuietComfort Ultra Headphones and step-down QuietComfort Headphones, although the QC Headphones feature a legacy design based on the QC 45 headphones.\nBose QC Earbuds 2024 design\nAvailable in black, white smoke and chilled lilac, the new QC Earbuds have a totally new design. Their shape reminds me a bit of Bose's old Sports Wireless Earbuds, which didn't have active noise canceling while these do. They also have a similar ear tip and stability band system to the Ultras that really helps you get a secure fit.\nAnd that fit is one of the strengths of these earbuds. Bose earbuds tend to be a little larger than a lot of earbuds on the market, but they typically offer a comfortable, secure fit. There are three sizes of ear tips and stability bands -- they're essentially sport fins -- to choose from.\nThey did stick out of my ears a fair bit (they do look a bit large), but I got a tight seal and really secure fit using the largest ear tips and the medium-sized stability bands. I had no problem running with the buds. They didn't budge in my ears, and they're IPX4 sweatproof and splash-proof.\nBose QC Earbuds sound quality and noise canceling\nAs I said, the QC Earbuds have active noise canceling and it's very good. While it's not quite as good as what you get with the flagship Ultras, which feature arguably the best noise-canceling on the market, it's pretty close. They also have a transparency or \"aware\" mode and I found it to be natural sounding with only a very faint hiss. No problems there.\nThese buds also sound quite good. Like Bose's other earbuds and headphones, they're designed to work well with a variety of music and offer generally smooth, punchy sound that's very pleasant for listening. While some competing buds offer a little more detail and clarity, the bass has a good kick to it without sounding booming.\nThe QC Earbuds don't sound quite as good as the Ultras, which have a bit more depth and extension (they offer slightly richer sound). But I did think the QC Earbuds buds played loud and most people should be satisfied with their sound quality.\nYou can also tweak the sound a bit as Bose had added a customizable five-band equalizer to its new QC Earbuds app. That app has been designed exclusively for these buds; it doesn't work with the Ultras, which use different firmware and a Qualcomm chipset that supports Qualcomm's Snapdragon Sound and its aptX Adaptive codec. These support the AAC and SBC audio codecs.\nBose QC Earbuds features\nThe buds have a few features not found in the QC Earbuds Ultra. For starters, the charging case has wireless charging. The case is a bit big and feels a little cheap in comparison to the Ultra's case, but Bose has finally added wireless charging.\nAnd the battery life is good. You can get up to 8.5 hours of playback time at moderate volume levels -- and that's with noise canceling on.\nThe second new feature is the ability toggle between noise canceling on, aware mode and a new off setting. Some people really wanted that off setting, which helps conserve battery life.\nThese don't have the Ultra's Immersion mode that widens the soundstage a bit and is kind of a spatial audio mode. But Bose says the Immersion mode is coming soon, though it could be months before we see it.\nThe buds also have some interesting voice-control features, including the ability to snap a selfie using a voice command through the buds. I found the voice commands to be a bit hit or miss. You have to say, \"Hey, headphones\" to activate the voice command mode, and sometimes it kicked on when I said the wake command and sometimes it didn't.\nWhen it's working, voice control allows you to skip tracks forward and backward and raise and lower volume, among other things. There are also the more standard customizable touch controls. In my tests. the touch controls were responsive; I didn't have an issue with them.\nOther features include ear detection sensors, a low-latency mode for gaming and video watching and multipoint Bluetooth pairing, though you can't have multipoint on to use those voice commands because if you're paired with two devices simultaneously, the buds don't know what phone to issue the voice commands for.\nBose QC Earbuds voice-calling performance\nBose says the earbuds have three microphones for noise canceling and voice-calling. I was slightly disappointed with the voice-calling performance. The buds do a very good job reducing background noise, but sometimes callers said my voice sounded muffled or glitched while I was talking. I sometimes had to repeat what I'd just said and talk louder.\nI tested the buds in the noisy streets of New York and under harsh conditions, which included some wind noise. They just didn't perform quite up to the level of other premium buds I've recently tested, including the AirPods 4, Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 Pro and Google Pixel Buds Pro 2. Hopefully, my review sample wasn't wonky, but I thought that voice-calling performance could be slightly better and hopefully we'll get a firmware update that tweaks the algorithm so my voice comes through more clearly in noisy environments.\nBose QC Earbuds final thoughts\nIn the final analysis, I think the QC Earbdus offer a comfortable, secure fit, sound very good and have top-notch noise canceling. I like the new features, particularly the voice commands, but the voice control doesn't work as well as it does with Samsung's Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. Hopefully a firmware upgrade will fix that.\nI do think the buds and case are a little big compared to what you get with other buds. And while the voice-calling performance had its plusses (good background noise reduction), callers said my voice sounded a little muffled and sometimes glitched in noisy environments.\nThe long and short of it is I came away impressed with the QC Earbuds, despite a couple of small shortcomings. Overall, they're very good buds and certainly worth considering, especially once they are discounted to $140 or less. Hopefully we'll see some firmware upgrades that tweak their performance and also add that Immersive Audio mode in the not-so-distant future."

      "text": "Ever since Apple's WWDC in June, we've known that the AirPods Pro 2 would be getting some new features with the arrival of iOS 17, which is officially available as Sept. 18. Among those free upgrades to the AirPods Pro 2 are Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness and Personalized Volume. They are definitely nice improvements that enhance the functionality of the AirPods Pro 2, and you should obviously try them out if you're an AirPods Pro 2 owner once you update to iOS 17. But as I've been testing out those new features with the \"new\" AirPods Pro 2 with MagSafe Charging Case (USB-C) that were launched alongside the new IPhone 15 models, I found myself asking a question that may be on other people's minds: Does the USB-C version of the AirPods Pro 2 sound any better than the previous Lightning version?\nHere's the thing: The new, USB-C version of the AirPods Pro 2 are very similar to the earlier Lightning model, but they are not identical. First, the new buds and charging case add increased dust-resistance (IP54 rating instead of IPX4). Second, in a pinch you can use your iPhone 15 to charge the USB-C AirPods with the included USB-C cable. And last and most interestingly, Apple has added support for 20-bit/48 kHz Lossless Audio with a \"massive reduction of latency\" for Apple's upcoming $3,499 Vision Pro headset (note that Apple Lossless Audio actually goes up to 24-bit/192 kHz). As part of that support, Apple has announced it's developed a \"groundbreaking wireless audio protocol,\" but some bloggers and YouTubers like former CNET editor Brian Tong, have noted that the AirPods Pro 2 feature a new \"acoustic architecture.\"\nWhat does that mean exactly? It's unclear whether that's a hardware change, a software change or both. But whenever I hear the words, \"new acoustic architecture\" on a set of earbuds or headphones, it raises the question whether the sound has changed at all.\nPut another way, the AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C are designed to sound better with the Vision Pro Headset, so is it possible that new acoustic architecture makes the buds sound subtly different with current devices like the iPhone? Granted, that new architecture may very well be all about delivering more wireless bandwidth. And Apple hasn't said anything about the sound being improved when you pair the new USB-C AirPods Pro 2 with current Apple devices. But that doesn't rule out the possibility that they sound ever so slightly different.\nA/B testing\nIn my attempts to ascertain whether there are any differences, I paired both the old and new AirPods Pro 2 to my iPhone 14 Pro (still running a version of iOS 16) and swapped them in and out of my ears, using the same large ear tips on both buds. For the record, the Lightning model number is A2698 running software version 6A301, while USB-C was model number A3048 running software version 6A300. I did my best to set the buds for the same volume level, left noise canceling turned on and didn't engage any other features, including spatial audio. I then listened to a handful of tracks over and over, including Spoon's Knock Knock Knock, Imagine Dragons' Monday, Florence and The Machine's Choreomania and Ed Sheeran's Shivers, on both Apple Music and Qobuz, which does offer hi-res tracks for devices that support hi-res wireless streaming via audio codecs like LDAC.\nI should note that I've been using the original AirPods Pro 2 for almost a year and the new USB-C AirPods for only a few days, so my two samples are not in identical condition from a usage standpoint. But since I test a lot of earbuds, I don't use the AirPods Pro 2 every day, only sporadically so they're not as well worn as a pair that's been used as someone's daily drivers for a year.\nEarly verdict\nLet me start by saying that the average listener will be hard-pressed to notice a difference in sound quality between the old and new AirPods Pro 2. They both sound excellent for how lightweight they are, which is partially why we gave the original AirPods Pro 2 a CNET Editors' Choice award last year. But I also came away from my testing feeling that the two earbuds don't sound exactly the same, and that maybe, just maybe, the new USB-C AirPods Pro 2 sound a tiny bit more refined with ever so slightly cleaner sound.\nMy only problem is that I'm dealing with is a little inherent bias. Ever since I learned there was some change to the acoustic architecture, I haven't been able to firmly believe the two buds sound exactly the same. So I could be wrong; my mind could be playing tricks on me. But then again, maybe not.\nWhy would Apple not say they sound better than the originals if they do? Well, sometimes Apple likes to keep things a little vague and mysterious and doesn't reveal everything about a product until months after it launches. Case in point: We only learned recently that the AirPods Pro 2 would be getting Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness and Personalized Volume -- all of which are now available via that iOS 17 update.\nMore tests on deck\nWas my observation bias -- that the new headphones should be \"better\" -- affecting my judgment? Will the performance on the two normalize once I upgrade to iOS 17? I'm doing that right now, and continuing my testing. Ultimately, once thousands of people try the USB-C AirPods Pro 2 and A/B them with the original AirPods Pro 2, we'll hopefully get a more definitive answer on whether they really sound identical or not. For now, my gut says they don't -- but I'll be updating this story soon with additional thoughts."

      "text": "Pros\n- Lightweight and comfortable\n- Good sound with very good noise canceling and ambient sound mode\n- Good voice-calling performance\n- Multipoint Bluetooth\n- 35 hours of battery life\n- Robust EQ settings\nCons\n- No carrying case\n- No ear-detection sensors\n- No LDAC support\nProducts like Sony's CH-720N headphones can be challenging to review. They're Sony's new and improved entry-level wireless noise-canceling headphones, joining a line that includes the $400 flagship WH-1000XM5, the earlier XM4 and the $250 WH-XB910N, an Xtra Bass model. That's all well and good, but here's the problem: At first glance -- and first touch -- they don't quite look or feel like $150 headphones.\nMaybe that's because they're so lightweight and have a bit of a plastic-y budget vibe even though there's some metal in their headband and their earcups have a clean, attractive design. Part of me was expecting them to sound pretty mediocre, but I was pleasantly surprised. No, they don't sound as good as the XM5s. But they sound more premium than they look (and feel) and their overall performance is a nice step up from their predecessor, the CH-710N. Are they worth $150? Maybe -- or maybe not. But the good news is that like the CH-710N and WH-XB910 before them, these should see some nice discounts in the not-so-distant future, which is what you may want to wait for.\nLightweight design, excellent comfort\nTruth be told I didn't love the CH-710N. I thought it was just OK and overpriced, unless it was on sale for less than $75. In contrast, the CH-720N is a significantly better headphone. It's more comfortable, has better sound, better noise canceling and better voice-calling performance. At 192 grams, Sony says it's the company's lightest over-ear noise-canceling headphone to date and it has nicely padded ear cups. In short, it ranks among the most comfortable headphones, which include Bose's QuietComfort 45 and Sony's own WH-1000XM5, which weighs in at 250 grams.\nRead more: Best noise-canceling headphones for 2023\nOne of the tip-offs that this may be more entry-level than midrange is that fact that no carrying case or pouch is included with the headphones. They fold flat like their predecessor and only have a single hinge, so they don't fold up. Some people were upset when Sony chose this type of design for the WH-1000XM5 when the XM4 had a dual-hinge and folded up and flat.\nThe CH-720N has some faux leather at the top of its headband with just the right amount of padding and the headphone's look and feel is a step-up from its predecessor despite its lack of premium qualities. I liked the matte finish and the headphones are currently available in two colors: black or white (I only tried the white version).\nNote that Sony also makes the CH-520, an on-ear model without noise cancellation that lists for only $60. This model is a big upgrade over that one both in terms of design and sound quality.\nEquipped with Bluetooth 5.2, the CH-720N eschews the touch controls of the WH-1000XM5 and sticks to physical buttons, which some people may appreciate. There's a universal control button along with volume control buttons and an NC/AMB button that allows you to toggle between noise canceling and an ambient sound mode (also referred to as a transparency mode) that lets you hear the outside world.\nThe headphones seem fairly sturdy and don't make any creaking noises when you adjust them on your head. I can't tell you how they'll hold up after months of use, but I'm sure they'd hold up better if you put them in some sort of cheap protective pouch or hard carrying case when not in use.\nLimited extra features\nAs you might expect, the CH-720N isn't loaded with extra features like the WH-1000XM5 is. There are no ear detection sensors, so your music doesn't pause when you take them off. The headphones can be set to shut down automatically after 15 minutes if you stop using them, though, which helps save battery life.\nYou don't get Sony's nifty Quick Attention and Speak To Chat features, which pause your music and puts the headphones into transparency mode, allowing you to have a conversation without taking the headphones off (Quick Attention is sort of manual version of Speak To Chat). There's no support for Sony's higher-fidelity LDAC audio codec that's compatible with many Android smartphones when streaming audio over Bluetooth. The CH-720N uses the AAC and SBC audio codecs, supported by both Android and iOS devices.\nThe headphones do have multipoint Bluetooth pairing, so you can connect them to two devices simultaneously -- a smartphone and PC, for example -- and have your audio automatically switch to your smartphone if a call comes in while you're listening to audio on your computer. The feature has to be enabled in Sony's Headphones Connect app for iOS and Android, which also enables you to tweak the sound profile of the headphones, upgrade the headphones' firmware and adjust the ambient awareness level.\nI tended to set the Ambient Sound at around Level 15 (out of 20) for what I felt was the most natural sound. While the ambient sound mode works well, it isn't as good as the AirPods Pro 2's transparency mode. The headphones are compatible with Sony's 360 Reality Audio format for music streaming services that support it.\nI should also note that you can use the headphones in wired mode (a cable is included). I didn't notice a significant difference in sound quality going wired and while you can use them passively with the headphones turned off, they don't sound so good that way. They're really designed to be listened to as a powered headphone but you can use them in a pinch as a wired headphone should the power die.\nBattery life is rated at up to 35 hours at moderate volume levels with noise canceling on and a 3-minute charge via USB-C will get you an hour's worth of battery life. You can get up to 50 hours of battery life with noise cancellation off.\nPerformance and sound quality\nLike the WH-1000XM5, this model has 30mm drivers, though they're not the same driver design. I found the earlier CH-710N's sound to be a little dull and unimpressive, but the CH-720N's sound is much more respectable. While it lacks the extra clarity, definition and more dynamic nature of the WH-1000XM5, the headphones sound quite pleasant with good overall tonal balance (it has a slight \"smiley face\" sound profile out of the box, with a touch of treble and bass push), punchy bass, good clarity and openness. I think most people will be quite happy with their sound and they do work well with a variety of music genres.\nYou can turn on DSEE, or Digital Sound Enhancement, in the app, which Sony says \"restores high frequency sounds lost in compression.\" It arguably improves the sound quality a tad, adding a touch more detail (though engaging it does impact battery life slightly).\nSony's equipped these headphones with its V1 chip, which is supposed to offer better digital processing, especially when it comes to the adaptive noise canceling. And the noise canceling is quite decent and noticeably improved from the noise canceling on the CH-710N. It's still a step behind that of the WH-1000XM5, but it's not that far off (Sony describes the XM5's noise canceling as \"industry-leading\" while it only refers to the CH-720N's as \"digital noise canceling,\" the same way it describes the feature for the WH-XB910N, which also has the V1 chip.\nFor voice calls, the CH-720N appears to use a pair of beamforming microphones (a single voice microphone paired with a feedforward microphone), with Sony referring to the system as Precise Voice Pickup Technology. The microphone set up isn't as sophisticated as what you get with WH-1000XM5, but the headphones did a surprisingly good job reducing background noise, including a fair amount of wind noise, when I was making calls from the noisy New York streets. Callers said they could hear me clearly for the most part, with only minimal intrusions of ambient noise. The noise reduction wasn't on par with the best-in-class noise reduction offered by the WH-1000XM5 during calls, but it's certainly well above average.\nSony CH-720N final thoughts\nWe have a list of the best \"cheap\" noise-canceling headphones that cost less than $100 and there are some models on that list that feature somewhat comparable sound quality to this Sony (the 1More SonoFlow, which costs around $80, also has support for LDAC Bluetooth streaming and includes a hard carrying case). That said, the CH-720N offers the appealing combination of a lightweight, comfortable design with respectable performance. The sound quality doesn't measure up with what you get from more premium models -- it lacks a bit of depth and definition by comparison -- but I was happy with what I heard from most of the tracks I listened to and I didn't experience any listening fatigue.\nAs I said at the outset, despite all their positives, these headphones seem a tad pricey at $150. There aren't a lot of competing noise-canceling headphones in this price range (they tend to cost over $200 or less than $100). You have the Soundcore by Anker Space Q45 ($150) and Edifier's WH950NB ($180), another two non-Sony headphones that support Sony's LDAC audio codec along with overall strong performance. But watch for the CH-720N to go on sale. You may end up feeling fine paying full price for them, but they feel like they should cost a little less."

      "text": "While it doesn't look like Sony is going to release a new set of WH-1000XM6 flagship over-ear headphones this year, it has introduced two new LinkBuds earbuds, the LinkBuds Fit and LinkBuds Open. Both cost $200 and come in multiple color options along with optional customizable accessories, including swappable fins and case covers that come in a variety of colors. They're available for preorder now and ship around October 22.\nI've been playing around with the new buds for the last few days and have been impressed with the improvements Sony has made to both models' designs and performance.\nI liked the original LinkBuds and thought their ring driver was innovative, but they didn't fit everybody's ears equally well. The new LinkBuds Open are slightly smaller with an \"evolved geometric form\" that does improve their fit. They also sound better.\nMeanwhile, the new LinkBuds Fit are Sony's response to Beats' popular Fit Pro earbuds. Lightweight and compact, they're the noise-isolating sibling to the LinkBuds Open and seem more like a second cousin to the LinkBuds S, which will remain in the line. When in your ears, it's actually a little hard to tell the two new models apart; both feature Sony's new Air Fitting Supporters, which are essentially sport fins.\nHere are my quick first impressions of both models. I'll have full reviews in the coming days, so stay tuned for those.\nSony LinkBuds Open hands-on early impressions\nWhile the LinkBuds retain their ring-shaped open driver -- these buds have no ear tips -- it's slightly smaller than the original's driver (11mm versus 12mm). Also, the Air Fitting Supporters are an improvement over the original's Arc Supporters, which were quite slim and didn't conform to the shape of your ear as well as these new supporters do.\nThe combination of the slightly smaller driver design and the new supporters should allow the buds to fit more ears more comfortably and securely. However, those with smaller ears may have some issues with them (I plan on having a few folks with smaller ears in the office try them on and get their impressions for my full review).\nI personally got a very secure fit and was able to run with the buds without a problem (they're IPX4 splashproof). The originals created some pressure points for some wearers. I had to fiddle around with their positioning in my ears from time to time, but I didn't experience any pain points with the LinkBuds Fit. However, Apple's new AirPods 4 were slightly more comfortable in my ears, though they didn't fit as securely.\nAside from the fit, the other big change is to the sound quality. It's definitely improved. Despite the smaller drivers, the buds play more loudly and also deliver a little more bass. The buds are equipped with Sony's V2 digital processing chip and Sony says the driver's have a \"high-compliance diaphragm and powerful neodymium magnet\" that were \"specifically selected to reproduce clear mid and high frequency sound.\"\nThey don't sound quite as good as the LinkBuds Fit, but they're among the best-sounding open earbuds and do feature clear, nicely detailed sound. They don't deliver as much bass as the LinkBuds Fit and other premium noise-isolating buds, but in quieter environments anyway, there's a relatively small drop-off in sound quality from noise-isolating buds. Also, like other open buds, their sound does have an open, airy quality to it.\nIn my early tests, voice-calling performance was good and the buds have good battery life. They're rated for up to 8 hours on a single charge, with the compact case providing an additional 14 hours. It's worth noting the lightweight case, which features a trendy marble swirl on the glossy top portion, feels a tad flimsy, but hopefully it will hold up fine over time. Note that the case does not have wireless charging, which is a tad disappointing for a set of $200 earbuds.\nThe LinkBuds Open do have a couple of extra features worth highlighting. Not only are they equipped with Sony's Speak-To-Chat feature that pauses your music when you start a conversation, but they have some voice controls built into the buds themselves. The voice-control feature has to be activated in the settings menu, as does Speak-To-Chat. But once it's activated, you simply say, \"Hey, headphones,\" then say one of the available voice commands, which include commands for skipping tracks forward and back as well raising and lowering volume.\n- Slightly smaller design\n- Improved sound quality\n- New Air Fitting Supporters (optional colors available as post-purchase accessory for $10)\n- New 11mm ring driver\n- Integrated Processor V2\n- Ear-detection sensors\n- Supports DSEE (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine)\n- Bluetooth 5.3\n- IPX4 splashproof\n- Up to 8 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels (additional 14 hours in charging case)\n- Compatible with Sony's \"renewed\" Sound Connect app for iOS and Android\n- Multipoint Bluetooth pairing\n- Built-in voice controls\n- Audio codecs supported: SBC, AAC and LC3\n- Available in black, white and Olivia Rodrigo's violet color\n- Price: $200\nSony LinkBuds Fit hands-on early impressions\nTruth be told, in some ways, I like the new LinkBuds better than Sony's flagship WF-1000XM5 noise-canceling earbuds. They don't sound quite as good or have noise-canceling that's as good as those buds, but they're lightweight (4.9 grams) and fit my ears comfortably and securely. And their sound, noise canceling and call-quality performance are all very good.\nLike the LinkBuds Open, they're powered by Sony's Integrated Processor V2, which Sony says \"optimizes noise canceling in real time according to the user's environment for optimal audio performance.\" Plus, its dual noise sensor technology \"filters exterior sound using multiple microphones, for greater immersion.\" The WF-1000XM5 has the same V2 chip but pairs it with its HD Noise Canceling Processor QN2e, which is supposed to further enhance noise-canceling and sound quality.\nOf course, if you can't get a good fit and tight seal with your earbuds, sound quality and noise-canceling performance will suffer, no matter what chips the buds have. More people will be able to get a better fit with the LinkBuds Fit than the WF-1000XM5. Part of that is due to those new Air Fitting Supporters, but Sony's also redesigned its ear tips and included a wide range of sizes, including XL tips that fit my ears well. (While I can't get a tight seal with any of the tips that Sony includes with the WF-1000XM5 earbuds, I use Sennheiser's large ear tips to get a tight seal.)\nOut of the box, the LinkBuds Fit feature Sony's signature sound profile. It's a tad warm (bass forward), but the sound is open and dynamic. If anything, it lacks a touch of clarity, but the profile works well with a variety of music genres, and most people should be pleased with the LinkBuds Fit's sound quality. You can tweak the sound a bit with the equalizer settings in Sony's new \"renewed\" Sound Connect app, which replaces the Sony Headphones app. Sony has streamlined the app a bit in an effort to make it seem less confusing to users. (It does seem a little more user friendly but there are still plenty of settings to choose from.)\nSony says it's also improved the ambient (transparency) mode from the LinkBuds S, making it sound more natural, and I do think that's the case from my early testing. As I said, the noise canceling doesn't seem quite as good as that of the WF-1000MX5, which features some of the best noise-canceling out there. But it's still very good overall.\nI thought the voice-calling performance was impressive. Callers said they could hear almost no background noise when I spoke to them from the noisy streets of New York. And they said my voice sounded pretty clear with minimal glitches.\nI'm not going to get into all of the LinkBuds Fit's features, but like the LinkBuds Open, they feature built-in voice controls, Sony's Speak-To-Chat feature that pauses your music when you start a conversation with someone. They also have the gesture controls of the LinkBuds S (you can nod or shake your head to accept or reject calls).\nBattery life is rated at 5.5 hours at moderate volume levels with noise-canceling on, and the charging case gives you an additional three charges. The charging case does not have wireless charging.\n- Compact, lightweight design (4.9 grams per bud)\n- 8.4 mm driver unit\n- Active noise canceling and ambient (transparency) mode\n- New Air Fitting Supporters (optional colors available as post-purchase accessory for $10)\n- Integrated Processor V2\n- Ear-detection sensors\n- Support DSEE (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine)\n- Bluetooth 5.3\n- Audio codecs supported: SBC, AAC, LDAC and LC3\n- IPX4 splash-proof\n- Up to 5.5 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels (additional 3 full charges in charging case)\n- Compatible with Sony's \"renewed\" Sound Connect app for iOS and Android\n- Multipoint Bluetooth pairing\n- Built-in voice controls\n- Available in black, white, green and Olivia Rodrigo's violet color\n- Price: $200\nLinkBuds Speaker first impressions\nSony has also introduced a new $180 LinkBuds Speaker, that comes in gray or black. At first glance, it seems a little weird that it's in the LinkBuds line because it's a speaker, not earbuds. But Sony's developed a new Auto Switch feature that swaps playback between your LinkBuds earbuds and LinkBuds Speaker automatically, depending on the situation. One example is that if you come home and are listening to your buds as you walk in the door, the music you're listening to will automatically switch over to the speaker, and you can remove your buds without stopping playback.\nI only listened to the speaker for a short time, but it does sound good for its compact size. Sony says it has best-in-class call quality of any of its wireless speakers (I'll be testing that in the coming days), and I did like that it comes with a dedicated charging dock.\n- Compact design\n- Quick Access allows for one-touch listening\n- Auto Play plays music according to your routine\n- X- Balanced Speaker Unit with a tweeter and passive bass radiators\n- Top call quality of any Sony wireless speaker\n- Detachable strap\n- Dedicated charging cradle\n- IPX4 splashproof\n- Up to 25 hours battery life at moderate volume levels and quick charging\n- Compatible with Sony Sound Connect app for iOS and Android\n- Available in light gray and black\n- Price: $180\nSony LinkBuds Open and LinkBuds Fit final first impressions\nI think Sony's done a nice job moving the LinkBuds line forward with both design and performance improvements. The customizable accessories are a bit of a gimmick (I'm not sure how great the earbuds look when you mix and match colors), though it's understandable that Sony would want to open a new post-purchase revenue stream. It's also too bad that Sony's raised the price for the buds by $20 from their predecessors. But that type of price hike seems to be the case with a lot of premium earbuds these days, including new models from Samsung and Google.\nUnless you're someone who just can't stand having ear tips in your ears, the LinkBuds Fit are probably going to be the better option if you're trying to choose between the two models. They sound better overall and also feature active noise canceling. The LinkBuds Open are certainly improved -- and very good open earbuds -- but they just may not be everybody's cup of tea."

Proprietary Bose OpenAudio technology allows the earbuds to play rich, immersive audio privately even though the speakers on the earbuds sit a short distance from your ear canal, leaving you open to the sounds of your surroundings. The cuffs hook around the outside of your ear so gently that you might forget they\u2019re even there, so you can leave them on all day, always ready for music, calls, or videos.\nThe Open Earbuds were designed from the ground up to give you a soundtrack for your life: to let you enjoy your music without blocking your ears, in a shape so comfortable you can almost forget you\u2019re wearing any earbuds at all. The engineering of these earbuds was a matter of squeezing Bose OpenAudio technology \u2014 which projects deep, rich sound across a short distance of open space to your ear canal \u2014 into a shape that could grip your ear extremely gently, leave your ear open to outside sounds, and contain a long-lasting battery. This design process resulted in the Open Earbuds\u2019 unique shape, inspired by ear cuff jewelry. The light-as-air flex arm connects the audio portion of the earbud to a battery barrel that goes behind your ear, providing just enough grip to keep the earbuds secure on any size ear.\nYes. The Open Earbuds are excellent for exercise, thanks to their confident stability on your ear, powerful sound, and open design. Bose\u2019s unique OpenAudio technology allows air to keep your ears cool and dry while you enjoy both your music and sounds from your environment, such as city sounds, nature, input from a coach or workout partner, or sounds that help you play a sport such as tennis or basketball.\nYes. The combination of skin-safe materials, a fully open design, long battery life, and unparalleled comfort means you can leave the earbuds on all day, always connected to your device and ready to produce rich audio the moment you need it.\nIn stereo mode, the earbud batteries will provide up to 7 hours of play time or 48 hours of standby time (no audio playing). For all-day wear that involves a mix of audio listening and standby, the battery life will vary depending on the proportion of each. For example, 5 hours of audio would leave 10 hours of standby life remaining. And if the battery does run out, a quick 10-minute charge in the case will add up to 2 hours of play time.\nYes. You can slide the earbud slightly up or down the outside of your ear to adjust for comfort, preferred sound balance, looks, or to avoid interference with jewelry.\nYes. The Open Earbuds are uniquely designed to attach to a part of the ear that does not interfere with most glasses, hats, and piercings. If your accessories touch the product, that\u2019s no problem as long as the earbuds remain comfortable and secure. The magnets that help the earbuds attach to their charging case may occasionally stick slightly to jewelry made of ferromagnetic metals like nickel; this is not damaging to the earbuds or the jewelry, but if bothersome can be avoided by slightly sliding the earbud up or down the ear, away from the jewelry.\nOpenAudio is a proprietary Bose technology that allows audio played a short distance from your ear canal to be rich, deep, and private \u2014 without sealing your ear. Each earbud uses a tiny dipole transducer system engineered for loud-and-clear personal audio that stays at the ear \u2014 instead of going everywhere else.\nIt\u2019s easy to hear the difference Bose OpenAudio makes by comparing the power of the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds with a traditional set of earbuds held slightly outside your ear. If you remove the traditional earbud from your ear canal and hold it near your ear at the same distance that the Open Earbuds sit, you\u2019ll notice the much greater volume and richer bass from the Open Earbuds.\nBose OpenAudio directs rich, deep audio into the ear canal while using proprietary technology to minimize sound spillage in other directions. In most environments and at most listening levels, people around you won\u2019t hear a thing. If you turn up the volume all the way in a very quiet environment, others may hear that something is playing from your earbuds, but they won\u2019t be able to hear any detail unless they get very close.\nNo. By design, the Open Earbuds don\u2019t block out the world or have noise cancelling, so you can enjoy your music while staying open to the sounds of the world around you. They do have an automatic volume control feature, available in the Bose app, that helps you hear your music evenly as your environment changes from quiet to loud and back.\nYes. The Ultra Open Earbuds have the Bluetooth multipoint feature allowing them to connect to two source devices at the same time. This is a recent update as of July 2024, so be sure to set up your earbuds with the Bose app to receive software updates.\nThe Bose app also allows you to customize the shortcut function on each earbud\u2019s button, and one of the available options is Switch Source. Setting a shortcut to Switch Source will enable you to switch between previously connected Bluetooth source devices with a press and hold of the earbud button without needing to take the earbuds off.\nGive your life a soundtrack\nGroove to your music and your surroundings \u2014 at the same time, all the time. This fresh take on listening combines premium sound quality, enduring comfort, and an innovative design.\nIn sync and open to anything\nOpenAudio tech is for moments that call for awareness, like crossing a busy street or taking a call in the park. Ultra Open Earbuds sit comfortably on your ears and project sound into them, keeping you engaged with life as you listen.\nMusic from start to finish\nFrom running errands to meeting up with the run club, experience the feeling of having your favorite artist right beside you.

      "text": "Pros\n- USB-C port for more convenient charging\n- Colorful matte design\n- Improved camera that can automatically take people and pet portraits\n- Dynamic Island brings better multitasking\nCons\n- No always-on display\n- Find My Friends feature only works with other iPhone 15 phones\n- Discounted iPhone 14 Pro may be a better value\n- Galaxy S23 offers a longer optical zoom\nEditors' note, Sept. 19, 2024: Apple has launched the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus. Read CNET's review here.\nAfter using the iPhone 15 for a few days, there's one thing I can say with certainty: It's a major upgrade for older iPhone users.\nThe biggest new addition is the USB-C charging port located where the Lightning connector used to be. That means you can use the same cable to charge your Mac, your iPhone and many of the other non-Apple devices in your life. (Although I'll have to admit, I accidentally tried plugging a Lightning cable into my iPhone 15 on my first night with the phone just out of habit.)\nThere's also a new second-gen ultra-wideband chip inside the phone, enabling it to pinpoint the precise location of friends and family members that are also iPhone 15 users. And the camera now captures enough depth data in the regular photo mode to create a portrait image after you took the picture.\nThe iPhone 15 and 15 Plus also heavily draw from the iPhone 14 Pro's influence, giving users who can't splurge on Apple's pricier phone a taste of last year's \"pro\" features. That includes the Dynamic Island, a dedicated area near the top of the screen for viewing time-sensitive data like your Uber's ETA, and the A16 Bionic processor. While the iPhone 15's camera technically isn't the same as the one on the iPhone 14 Pro, they each have a 48-megapixel main sensor.\nOverall, these changes come together to make the iPhone 15 feel like a big step forward for those upgrading from an aging iPhone. (That includes me, an iPhone 12 owner.) But it's not a dramatic difference from Apple's previous generation phone. Rather, it feels like an extension of the iPhone 14 Pro, which can make it hard to recommend over last year's premium iPhone if you can still find it at a discount.\nThe iPhone 15 starts at $799 (\u00a3799, AU$1,499) for the 6.1-inch model and $899 for the 6.7-inch Plus model. And if you're curious about the \"Pro\" line Apple is launching, check out my colleague Patrick Holland's review of the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. All four new iPhones are available now.\niPhone 15 gets USB-C and a new look\nSay goodbye to your Lightning cable. The iPhone 15 is the first iPhone to support USB-C charging, a move that complies with new rules from the EU mandating smartphones sold in Europe to adopt the common charging standard. A USB-C charging cable is included in the box instead of a Lightning cable.\nUSB-C has essentially been standard across most gadgets (laptops, tablets, phones, wireless earbuds) for years. But the iPhone's transition is significant because it has been the one major outlier when it comes to USB-C. Even other recent Apple gadgets, like newer iPads, have the charging port.\nFor iPhone 15 owners, the biggest benefit you'll get is a charging experience that's more convenient, and in some cases faster. The standard iPhone 15 can replenish its battery up to 50% in 30 minutes with a 20-watt adapter, but it'll charge at an even faster 27W if you plug it into the charger that comes with your Mac.\nFaster data transfer speeds, however, are reserved for the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, which support USB 3. The iPhone 15 supports USB 2 transfer speeds, just like the Lightning port on last year's iPhone 14 and 14 Pro.\nBut there's another way to put the iPhone 15's new charging port to use. You can use the iPhone to charge other gadgets. I charged the AirPods Pro 2, which Apple now sells with a USB-C case, by connecting the case to my iPhone 15 via USB-C.\nThe switch to USB-C may not feel immediately convenient, especially if you own other Lightning-powered products, like AirPods or an older iPad. But it'll be helpful in the long run.\nIn addition to supporting Apple's MagSafe magnetic charging system, the iPhone 15 is also compatible with the new Qi2 wireless charging standard. That should make it easier to align the iPhone 15 correctly on non-MagSafe Qi2 wireless chargers when those accessories eventually launch.\nThere's also some good news for those of you who prefer not to use a phone case. The iPhone 15's new finish feels more premium and doesn't gather as many fingerprint smudges. Apple says the back glass has been infused with color, giving it that cloudy look. It almost reminds me of the Galaxy S23, which also has a matte look, although its edges are glossy while the iPhone's are aluminum.\nI've so far been brave enough to use the iPhone 15 without a case, and I haven't had to wipe away fingerprint smudges once.\nMore from the Apple event\nThe iPhone 15 now has the Dynamic Island\nThe Dynamic Island, that tiny cutout for viewing sports scores and controlling Spotify, is no longer exclusive to Apple's Pro iPhones. It's now available across the entire iPhone 15 family, making it a part of the standard iPhone experience rather than an extra feature for niche \"pro\" users. The Dynamic Island's expansion also marks the end of the notch screen cutout, which debuted in 2017 on the iPhone X, on new flagship iPhones.\nApple introduced the Dynamic Island on the iPhone 14 Pro as a way to keep tabs on time-sensitive updates and manage music playback without having to switch between apps. I don't think it's a game changer, but the Dynamic Island does bring some convenience. For example, I use it to keep an eye on my fantasy football team's score and skip tracks in Spotify without opening the app. I could see it being especially helpful when I use my lunch break to squeeze in a workout, since I can control my Spotify playlist and keep Slack open on screen at the same time.\nThe Dynamic Island alone isn't a reason to upgrade. But I appreciate that it makes the iPhone better at multitasking, which is important considering the iPhone lacks the split-screen mode found on Android phones. Since the Dynamic Island works automatically for the most part, there's no learning curve.\nApple also increased the iPhone 15's display brightness compared to the iPhone 14. It now matches the iPhone 14 Pro's brightness, marking another similarity. This was noticeable in direct sunlight when I viewed both the iPhone 15 and iPhone 14's screens side-by-side, although the iPhone's screen was already bright enough to see comfortably in the sun.\nThe iPhone 15 should have an always-on display, too\nBut the iPhone 15 is missing one \"pro\" feature that I was hoping to see: an always-on display. Starting with last year's iPhone 14 Pro, Apple's pro devices have the ability to show information like the time and date even when the screen is turned off. This makes it easier to see bits of data at a glance without actually having to pick up your phone and unlock it.\nIn iOS 17, that always-on display has become even more useful thanks to a new feature called Standby mode. When your iPhone is charging and situated in landscape orientation, it will display large widgets and clock faces -- essentially turning it into a miniature smart display. But without an always-on display, the iPhone 15 turns eventually into a black rectangle instead of persistently showing the clock and my calendar.\nIt's reasonable that some features should remain exclusive to the iPhone 15 Pro, but I don't think the always-on display should be one of them. There are plenty of other features to distinguish the iPhone 15 Pro from the 15, such as a titanium build, a dedicated telephoto lens, the new A17 Pro processor and the Action button for programming shortcuts. Like the Dynamic Island, the always-on display feels like it belongs baked into the standard iPhone experience, especially since most competing Android phones in this price range and cheaper have the feature.\nThe iPhone 15 gets a camera upgrade\nThe standard iPhone is finally getting a bump in camera resolution. While the last several generations of the regular iPhone have had a 12-megapixel camera system, the iPhone 15 has a new 48-megapixel sensor that snaps 24-megapixel photos by default. This combined with the iPhone 15's improved dynamic range brings a big boost in image quality compared to older iPhones like the iPhone 12.\nThe iPhone 15's default 24-megapixel photos look rich, sharp and colorful. While you can't always see the difference at first glance compared to the iPhone 14, the improvements become clearer when zooming in. I noticed the iPhone 15's new camera at work most prominently when taking photos of people. The iPhone 15's camera captures crisper details in the face and hair, as you can see in the photo below of my husband.\niPhone 15\niPhone 14\nYou won't have to look twice to see the difference if you're upgrading from an older model like the iPhone 12. Just about everything looks better shot on the iPhone 15 compared to the iPhone 12 when capturing images of people. Take a look at the photo of my friend Jamie below, and you'll notice there's just so much more detail in her face and hair. It's especially impressive considering I took this photo in low light at an outdoor restaurant at night.\niPhone 15\niPhone 12\nApple clearly had portrait photography in mind for the iPhone 15. You no longer have to manually switch to Portrait Mode to shoot an image with a bokeh effect. The iPhone 15 can capture depth data automatically when shooting a person, cat or dog so that you can apply the effect afterwards. It's a fun addition that provides more flexibility when shooting and editing. It's refreshing to see Apple adding more editing options like these to the iPhone, considering that's typically been one of Google's strong points with its Pixel phones.\nTake a look at the photos below to see the same photo with and without the portrait blur effect.\niPhone 15 (Without portrait effect)\niPhone 15 (With portrait effect)\nEven though the iPhone 15 captures 24-megapixel pictures by default, you can also shoot at the full 48-megapixel resolution. But this is most useful for photos that you might want to print since the difference in quality isn't very noticeable to the naked eye.\nWhen I compared the same photo side-by-side -- one shot at 24 megapixels and the other at 48 megapixels -- I could only see the 48-megapixel photo's extra clarity when I zoomed in very closely. If I had a hard time noticing the difference on my 21-inch monitor, you certainly won't be able to see it on your phone's tiny screen.\nThat said, those minute details will likely be noticeable if you plan to order large prints of your iPhone photos. The 48-megapixel file was too large to upload for this review, but here's a look at a photo I captured at the 24-megapixel resolution.\niPhone 15 (24 megapixels)\nThe iPhone 15's new camera sensor also brings another trick: better zoom. There's a new 2x telephoto option in the camera app, which is frankly a much-needed upgrade considering Samsung has been far ahead in this regard. While you'll get a much higher quality zoom on the iPhone 15 Pro since it has a telephoto lens, the iPhone 15 uses the camera sensor's middle 12 megapixels to achieve a clearer 2x zoom.\nThe result is a cleaner zoomed shot that preserves more detail at 2x compared to the iPhone 14. But again, this is only truly noticeable when zooming in. To show you what I mean, I cropped in closely on the palm trees in the photo below, which was captured using the new 2x telephoto setting, to illustrate how the iPhone 15 captures more detail at the pixel level. On the iPhone 14, I manually zoomed in at 2x using the pinch-to-zoom function.\nOriginal Photo (iPhone 15, shot at 2x)\niPhone 15 (Cropped shot)\niPhone 14 (Cropped shot)\nSamsung, however, still has Apple beat when it comes to zoom photography. The $800 Galaxy S23 has a dedicated telephoto lens with a 3x optical zoom, offering sharper images and more flexibility when shooting. Take a look at the same portion of the image shown above shot on the Galaxy S23 Plus at a 3x zoom.\nGalaxy S23 Plus (Shot at 3x, cropped in)\nOverall, the iPhone 15's new camera will feel like a huge step up from older generations. While the camera upgrades are noticeable compared to the iPhone 14, it's not a big enough leap to justify upgrading just yet. But it'll feel like a night-and-day difference for those coming from older phones.\nTake a look at the gallery below to see some other photos I shot on the iPhone 15.\nThe iPhone 15 has the same chip as the iPhone 14 Pro\nThe iPhone 15 inherits the iPhone 14 Pro's A16 Bionic chip, which the company claims brings general performance improvements and enables faster machine learning, which is important for features that rely on language processing like iOS 17's voicemail transcriptions.\nThe A16 Bionic processor isn't Apple's newest mobile chip, but it's powerful enough for many of the things iPhone 15 owners are likely to be doing on their phones. That includes playing mobile games, scrolling through Instagram, editing photos and making video calls. The differences will be more noticeable if you're upgrading from a phone that's more than two years old.\nAnd I should know, because I've been using an iPhone 12 as my primary phone before reviewing the iPhone 15. Everything on the iPhone 15 feels lighter and faster compared to the iPhone 12. But taking photos in dim environments, like an outdoor restaurant at night, felt noticeably faster.\nThe iPhone 15 lineup also has Apple's second-generation ultra-wideband chip, which enables a new feature for finding friends and family members in a crowd. After sharing their location with you in the Find My app, your iPhone 15 will be able to show how far away the person is from your current location and point you in the right direction. It's like using your phone to find an AirTag.\nThe catch, however, is that this only works within the iPhone 15 lineup. So unless you and your friends are all planning on upgrading your iPhones, you likely won't be putting this feature to use anytime soon.\nThe iPhone 15 is rated for the same battery life as the iPhone 14 according to Apple's claims. That's up to 16 hours of streamed video playback for the iPhone 15, and up to 20 hours of video streaming for the iPhone 15 Plus.\nI had 35% of my iPhone 15's battery left after roughly 13 hours of use on a day that involved taking a lot of photos and uploading files to Google Drive. That suggests the iPhone 15's battery is enough to get through a full day with ease, but you'll want to pack a charger if you anticipate a long day that could involve taking a lot of photos and videos.\nAfter running CNET's anecdotal usage test, which involves playing mobile games, taking a video call, streaming video and scrolling through social media over the course of 45 minutes with the screen brightness set to 50%, the standard iPhone 15's battery dropped from 100% to 95%. That's an improvement from the iPhone 14, which saw a drop from 95% to 85% during the same test. The iPhone 15's results also match those of the iPhone 14 Plus and the Samsung Galaxy S23 Plus.\nWe'll update this review with more battery tests for both the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus shortly.\niPhone 15: Final thoughts\nThe iPhone 15's similarities to the iPhone 14 Pro gave me some deja vu. But those coming from an aging iPhone model will find a lot of value in this upgrade, from the new USB-C port to its higher resolution camera, the Dynamic Island and fresh design. As someone who's been using an iPhone 12 for the past three years (when I'm not reviewing other phones, of course), I can say this feels like a big upgrade. That said, if you have an iPhone 14, or even an iPhone 13, you can likely wait a little longer, unless you're super eager to get USB-C or the Dynamic Island.\nApple no longer sells the iPhone 14 Pro through its website, but you may be able to find it through third-party retailers and carriers. I recommend checking for a discounted iPhone 14 Pro before making your decision. It has a lot in common with the iPhone 15, but also includes a dedicated telephoto camera, extras like the always-on display and a high variable refresh rate for smoother scrolling. Just keep in mind you'll miss out on the USB-C port, which is an important consideration if you don't like packing extra cables.\nAll told, the iPhone 15 feels like a leap forward from older iPhones. It's almost like an iPhone 14 Pro Lite, showing that Apple's \"pro\" iPhones are having a bigger influence on the regular models.\nHow we test phones\nEvery phone tested by CNET's reviews team was actually used in the real world. We test a phone's features, play games and take photos. We examine the display to see if it's bright, sharp and vibrant. We analyze the design and build to see how it is to hold and whether it has an IP-rating for water resistance. We push the processor's performance to the extremes using both standardized benchmark tools like GeekBench and 3DMark, along with our own anecdotal observations navigating the interface, recording high-resolution videos and playing graphically intense games at high refresh rates.\nAll the cameras are tested in a variety of conditions from bright sunlight to dark indoor scenes. We try out special features like night mode and portrait mode and compare our findings against similarly priced competing phones. We also check out the battery life by using it daily as well as running a series of battery drain tests.\nWe take into account additional features like support for 5G, satellite connectivity, fingerprint and face sensors, stylus support, fast charging speeds, foldable displays among others that can be useful. And we of course balance all of this against the price to give you the verdict on whether that phone, whatever price it is, actually represents good value. While these tests may not always be reflected in CNET's initial review, we conduct follow-up and long-term testing in most circumstances.\niPhone 15 vs. iPhone 14\n| iPhone 15 | iPhone 15 Plus | iPhone 14 | iPhone 14 Plus | |\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate, brightness | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,556x1,179 pixels | 6.7-inch OLED; 2,796x1,290 pixels | 6.1-inch OLED; 2,532x1,170 pixels | 6.7-inch OLED; 2,778x1,284 pixels |\n| Pixel density | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 460 ppi | 458 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 2.82 x 5.81 x 0.31 in. | 3.06 x 6.33 x 0.31 in. | 5.78 x 2.82 x 0.31 in. | 6.33 x 3.07 x 0.31 in. |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 71.6 x 147.6 x 7.8 mm | 77.8 x 160.9 x 7.8 mm | 147 x 72 x 7.8 mm | 161 x 78 x 7.8mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 171 g (6.02 oz.) | 201 g (7.09 oz.) | 172 g (6.07 oz.) | 203 g (7.16 oz.) |\n| Mobile software (at launch) | iOS 17 | iOS 17 | iOS 16 | iOS 16 |\n| Camera | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 48-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 12-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 12-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) |\n| Front-facing camera | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 4K | 4K | 4K | 4K |\n| Processor | A16 Bionic | A16 Bionic | Apple A15 Bionic | Apple A15 Bionic |\n| Storage | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB |\n| Expandable storage | None | None | None | None |\n| Battery | Undisclosed; Apple claims up to 20 hours of video playback (16 hours streamed) | Undisclosed; Apple claims up to 26 hours of video playback (20 hours streamed) | Undisclosed; Apple claims 20 hours of video playback | Undisclosed; Apple claims 26 hours of video playback |\n| Fingerprint sensor | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) | None (Face ID) |\n| Connector | USB-C (USB 2.0) | USB-C (USB 2.0) | Lightning | Lightning |\n| Headphone jack | None | None | None | No |\n| Special features | Dynamic Island; 5G (mmw/Sub6); MagSafe; water resistant (IP68); wireless charging; eSIM; satellite connectivity | Dynamic Island; 5G (mmw/Sub6); MagSafe; water resistant (IP68); wireless charging; eSIM; satellite connectivity | 5G (mmw/Sub6); MagSafe; water resistant (IP68); wireless charging; eSIM; satellite connectivity | 5G (mmw/Sub6); MagSafe; water resistant (IP68); wireless charging; eSIM; satellite connectivity |\n| US price off-contract (at launch) | $799 (128GB), $899 (256GB), $1,099 (512GB) | $899 (128GB), $999 (256GB), $1,199 (512GB) | $699 (128GB), $799 (256GB), $999 (512GB) | $799 (128GB), $899 (256GB), $1,099 (512GB) |\n| UK price | \u00a3799 (128GB), \u00a3899 (256GB), \u00a31,099 (512GB) | \u00a3899 (128GB), \u00a3999 (256GB), \u00a31,199 (512GB) | \u00a3699 (128GB), \u00a3799 (256GB), \u00a3999 (512GB) | \u00a3799 (128GB), \u00a3899 (256GB), \u00a31,099 (512GB) |\n| Australia price | AU$1,499 (128GB), AU$1,699 (256GB), AU$2,049 (512GB) | AU$1,649 (128GB), AU$1,849 (256GB), AU$2,199 (512GB) | AU$1,299 (128GB), $1,499 (256GB), $1,849 (512GB) | AU$1,499 (128GB), $1,699 (256GB), $2,049 (512GB) |"

      "text": "Bone-conduction headphones continue to increase in popularity -- particularly for runners and bikers -- as Shokz, the leading maker of bone-conduction headphones, has made incremental improvements to their design, performance and sound quality over the years. The company's current top-of-the-line OpenRun Pro is the best set of bone-conduction headphones, although it may be a little too pricey for some people.\nOur Picks\nHEADPHONE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $250 (save $101)\n- $295 (save $154)\n- $278 (save $70)\n- $280 (save $170)\nWhile bone-conduction headphones are lacking in the bass department -- unless you plug up your ears with the included foam earplugs -- they're appealing for a few reasons. First, since they deliver sound to your ear through your cheekbones, you don't have ear tips jammed into your ears. And thanks to their open design, you can hear what's going on around you -- traffic noise in particular -- while listening to music or having a phone conversation. Also, some race coordinators don't allow runners to wear anything in their ears, which is where headphones like this come in handy.\nWhat are the best bone-conduction headphones overall?\nYou may notice that there are only Shokz products on this list. That's because they're currently the best option. We've tested other bone-conduction headphones -- you can find plenty of inexpensive generic models on Amazon -- but we've always come away feeling you're better off buying Shokz' entry-level OpenMove headphones than any of those.\nHere's a look at the top models. I'll update this list as new bone-conduction headphones are released.\nBest bone-conduction headphones for 2025\nPros\n- Lightweight, wraparound titanium frame\n- Secure fit with open design\n- Arguably the best sounding bone-conduction headphones\n- Decent voice-calling performance\n-\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\n- Bass lacks fullness (not for critical listening)\n- Neckband design isn't for everybody\nThe OpenRun Pro are Shokz' current top-of-the-line bone-conduction headphones. Featuring ninth-generation bone-conduction headphones, they offer slightly improved bass performance compared to the company's earlier flagship model, the Aeropex (now called the Shokz OpenRun). That makes the OpenRun Pro the best bone-conduction headphones you can get right now, although they still can't match the sound quality of traditional headphones.\nThe OpenRun Pro have a lightweight, wraparound titanium frame and are rated for up to 10 hours of music playback and you can get 90 minutes of battery life from a five-minute charge. (They have a proprietary charging cable instead of USB-C, which is not ideal.) I found them comfortable to wear, but you may occasionally have to adjust them on your head to relieve potential pressure points. While they do offer a bit fuller sound with more bass -- it's an incremental improvement, not a huge leap forward -- like other bone-conduction headphones these are strongest in the midrange where voices live so they're very good for podcasts, talk radio, newscasts and audiobooks. A hard carrying case is included as well as foam ear tips that you can jam into your ears to get better bass performance; most people use those tips sparingly.\nPros\n- Most affordable Shokz headphones\n- Secure, comfortable fit\n- Reasonably good sound for bone-conduction headphones\nCons\n- Proprietary magnetic charging (no USB-C)\n- Less sleek than step-up models\nUnlike Shokz' higher-end models, the OpenMove doesn't have as sleek a design. Nor does it feature its latest bone-conduction technology, being equipped with its seventh-generation tech with its PremiumPitch 2.0 sound. But these headphones do sound and perform better than other budget-priced bone-conduction headphones out there. In other words, while they're a step down from both the OpenRun and OpenRun Pro, they're still decent bone-conduction headphones that fit securely and comfortably (they just weigh a little more). Note that their price occasionally dips to as low as $55 during flash sales.\nPros\n- Very good voice-calling performance\n- Retractable boom microphone\n- Includes USB dongle for wireless PC connection\n- IP55 splash-proof\n- Zoom certification\nCons\n- Proprietary magnetic charging (no USB-C)\n- Not great for music listening with poor bass performance\nA few years ago, Shokz turned its OpenRun (formerly Aeropex) bone-conduction headphones into a more communications-friendly headset with an integrated boom microphone called the OpenComm ($160), which remains available. The second-generation OpenComm 2 UC costs more than the original, but features an upgraded Bluetooth 5.1 chipset that improves performance a bit and now allows for the firmware upgrades that are required for Zoom certification. Additionally, the microphone has moved from the left ear to the right and a convenient mute button has been added to the boom microphone -- an important addition.\nSince these leave your ears open -- the sound is conducted through your cheekbone -- they aren't for people who want to seal their ears out from outside noise. Rather, the idea is that you can hear everything around you without having anything covering your ears or jammed inside them. The headset is quite comfortable to wear. Some folks find that liberating and these do feature excellent noise reduction for calls, as callers told me they heard very little background noise even when I was out on the noisy streets of New York.\nWhile the Shokz are arguably the best-sounding bone-conduction headphones, they aren't great-sounding for music because they're lacking in the bass department. However, they're great for speech, so they work very well as a headset for making calls and listening to podcasts or audiobooks. These also have multipoint-Bluetooth pairing, so you can pair them with your phone and PC and easily switch to your phone if a call comes in while you're on your computer. And they come with either a USB-A or USB-C wireless dongle (you choose) that you plug into your computer for quick and reliable wireless connectivity.\nAs long as you don't mind the boom microphone, you can use the OpenComm 2 for sporting activities as well and are favorites for runners who want to keep their ears open to hear the outside world for safety reasons. They're also water-resistant. The only downside is they require a proprietary charging cable instead of USB-C. Battery life is rated at 16 hours of talk time and eight hours of listening.\nPros\n- Lightweight design\n- Fully waterproof and dust-proof\n- Decent sound for bone-conduction\nCons\n- Proprietary magnetic charging (not USB-C)\nReleased in 2021, the Shokz OpenRun is based on the company's former top-of-the-line bone-conduction model, the Aeropex. The OpenRun's design is the same as the Aeropex, but the headphone has been upgraded with a quick-charge feature and Bluetooth 5.1. It features eighth-generation bone-conduction technology instead of the ninth-generation technology found in the step-up OpenRun Pro (that OpenRun Pro has slightly better sound quality). The Pro also has slightly better battery at up to 10 hours versus eight hours for this model. That said, the OpenRun is fully waterproof and dust-proof with an IP67 rating while the Pro has an IP55 rating, which means it's dust-resistant and can deal with a sustained spray of water.\nOverall, the Pro does feature a slightly better design and performance, but it's not a huge difference (maybe 10% to 15% better) and the OpenRun does cost $50 less.\nPros\n- Lightweight design with shorter neckband than standard OpenRun\n- Fully waterproof and dust-proof\n- Decent sound for bone-conduction headphones\nCons\n- Proprietary magnetic charger (no USB-C)\nThe OpenRun Mini is just the OpenRun headphones with a shorter neckband. The OpenRun Mini has a 0.83-inch shorter band size than the OpenRun and Shokz says that if the back of your head's measurement from the left to the right ear is 9.25 inches or less, the Mini is your better choice.\nPros\n- Can be used underwater\n- Decent enough sound for underwater listening\n- 4GB of on board storage for MP3s\n- Fully waterproof\nCons\n- No Bluetooth option for wireless listening when out of the water\nThe Shokz OpenSwim is a rebranded version of AfterShokz Xtrainerz (yes, OpenSwim is much better name). This model is equipped with Shokz' seventh-generation bone-conduction technology, so it's not going to sound as good as the OpenRun Pro, which uses ninth-generation tech, but you're probably not going to be doing any critical listening while swimming -- most people are just looking for passable sound while swimming underwater. Note that these don't feature Bluetooth for wireless listening; Bluetooth doesn't transmit underwater. They have 4GB of onboard storage for playback of MP3 files that you have to load onto the headphones like an old-school MP3 player.\nThe OpenSwim offer up to eight hours of battery life and are obviously fully waterproof with an IP68 rating.\nFactors to consider when buying bone conduction headphones\nBudget\nBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new bone conduction headphones. The quality of value-priced earbuds and headphones continues to improve, so you can find good affordable bone conduction headphones for less than $100. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost more than $150 and sometimes more than $200.\nFit, aka comfort\nBecause of their non-traditional fit, it's key that bone conduction headphones fit your not only your ears, but your neck, too, both comfortably and securely. They should offer a comfortable fit that allows you to wear the headphones for long periods without any irritation to either part of the body.\nDurability\nYou want bone conduction headphones that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality and a good water-resistance rating to withstand sweat, dust, and damage from drops.\nReturn policy\nIt's critical to buy your headphones at a retailer that has a good return policy, in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days, and then return one.\nHow we test bone conduction headphones\nWe test our bone conduction headphones based on five key criteria, comparing similarly styled and priced models. These criteria are design, sound quality, features, voice-calling performance and value.\n- Design: We assess not only how comfortable the headphones fit (ergonomics) but their build quality and how well the controls are implemented. We also look at water- and dust-resistance ratings, which are especially important for evaluating the best workout headphones.\n- Sound quality: We evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing the headphones to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment.\n- Features: Some great-sounding headphones aren't loaded with features, but we do take into account what extra features are on board. These include everything from noise-canceling and transparency modes (ambient sound mode) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears.\n- Voice-calling performance: When we test voice-calling performance, we make calls in the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the headphones reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear your voice.\n- Value: We determine value after evaluating the strength of the headphones against all these criteria and what the buds are able to deliver compared to other models in their price class.\nOther bone conduction headphones we've tested\nShokz OpenFit: Shokz, the company formerly known as AfterShokz, has long been the leader in bone-conduction headphones. Models like the OpenRun Pro, which deliver sound to your ear through your cheekbones, are popular with runners and bikers who like to leave their ears open for safety reasons. However, Shokz's new OpenFit model, the company's first true wireless earbuds, doesn't use bone-conduction technology. They have an open design that fires sound into your ears using custom speaker drivers, which Shokz dubs \"air conduction\" technology."

And while they're excellent, we had some quibbles -- they're on the large side and aren't a good match for certain ears. Clearly, Sony took those gripes to heart when it set out to design its next-generation WF-1000XM5 flagship noise-canceling earbuds. Not only are the XM5s smaller, but they also offer improved performance pretty much across the board, with better noise canceling, sound and voice calling. Are the Mark 5s perfect? Not quite. And at $300 (\u00a3260) -- $20 more than their predecessor -- they're costly, too. But overall they're really impressive -- easily among the very top earbuds on the market.\nAvailable in black or silver, the XM5s are 25% smaller and 20% lighter than the XM4s, according to Sony, with each bud weighing 6 grams (the XM4s weigh 7.3 grams each). By comparison, Apple's AirPods Pro 2 weigh 5.3 grams each. The XM5s' charging case is smaller than the XM4s', too -- about 15% smaller -- and it has wireless charging capabilities.\nWatch this: Sony WF-1000XM5 Review: Top Earbuds Get Even Better\nAs I said, the XM4s are a little big. While they fit my ears nicely, they didn't necessarily fit people with small ears well and one of the focuses of this redesign is for the buds to fit a wider range of ears better. As I expected, the new XM5s are a good fit for my ears, but I did want to have someone with smaller ears try both the XM4s and XM5s and let me know what she thought. You can watch my companion video review to see my co-worker Tara try the buds -- and smaller XM5s clearly offered an improved fit for her.\nThe XM4s have a matte finish that I like. In contrast, these mix in a glossy finish that I was a little apprehensive about at first, but the outer part of the buds where the touch controls live has a matte finish, so it doesn't pick up fingerprints and even the glossy part on the black version of the buds avoids smudging pretty well. I also appreciate that the buds don't stick out of your ears as much as their predecessors did.\nThe XM5s include a fourth set of eartips (extra small), up from just three for the XM4s. And while they should fit most ears just fine, they retain a shortfall of the earlier model: they just don't quite give me the tight seal that you really need for optimal sound quality and noise canceling performance.\nThe tips are made out of a high-tech polyurethane foam material that's designed to conform to your ear canal and offer some added grip so the earbuds stay in your ears securely. But their shape isn't quite right for my ears -- I need tips that are a little wider and rounder -- and I had to swap in a set of my preferred silicone tips that allowed me to get a better seal. It'd be nice if Sony included a wider variety of tips, but, as I said, the majority of you shouldn't have a problem with the ones you get; many of you should be able to get a secure enough fit to run with these. Like the XM4s, the XM5s are IPX4 splashproof and sweat-resistant.\nSony WF-1000XM5 features\nSony's flagship headphones and earbuds have always been loaded with features. These XM5 buds add some new upgrades to go along with existing favorites like Speak-to-Chat, a mode you can enable that automatically pauses your music and activates the headphone's ambient mode when you start talking to someone. Ambient mode is similar to Apple's transparency mode but with the Sonys you can adjust the level of ambient sound you want to let in. (Apple's version of this feature is coming to the AirPods Pro 2 with iOS 17.)\nI'm not going to go through all the earbuds' features here, but I'll highlight the ones that stand out for me. First, you get multipoint Bluetooth pairing so you can pair the buds with two devices simultaneously and easily switch audio back and forth between them. There are also plenty of EQ settings to help tweak the sound and some adaptive sound modes, plus support for hands-free Alexa and Google Assistant (with my early review sample I could only get Alexa working, but Sony says hands-free Google Assistant is supported). That feature allows you to tap into Amazon's voice assistant without pressing anything on the buds. Also, there's a new beta setting called \"find your equalizer\" that lets you choose between a series of EQ setting tweaks to find the sound you like best to create a custom EQ setting. I thought that was a good addition.\nLike the XM4s, these buds have ear-detection sensors that pause your music when you take an earbud out -- yes, you can use a single earbud if you want -- and resume playback when you put it back in. But what's new is spatial audio with head-tracking. Currently, it's only available for Android users, according to Sony, and it's unclear if Apple users will ever get it. But in my tests, it seemed to work a lot like Apple's spatial audio for video watching.\nOne new feature that I almost missed is a new gesture control for answering and ending phone calls. You can choose to activate it or not, but it allows you to nod your head to answer or end calls. There's nothing yet that would allow you to skip music tracks forward or back by shaking your head left or right, but it would seem possible to add that gesture control.\nAccording to Sony, these are also compatible with the new LE Audio standard, so in the future, you should get access to features like Auracast broadcast audio that would allow you, for example, to tap into an audio stream being broadcast from a certain TV at the gym while you're on a treadmill.\nFinally, the XM5s support Sony's LDAC audio codec for devices that support it. Using LDAC can get you slightly better sound quality if you're streaming high-res audio tracks from streaming services like Qobuz, Tidal and Amazon Music. iPhone users get the AAC audio codec, but a lot of Android phones support LDAC, though you sometimes have to activate that support via the developer mode in the settings.\nIf there's a feature that's missing, it's some sort of \"find my buds\" feature built into the Sony Headphones app. The AirPods Pro 2 have a Precision Find My feature that really does come in handy at times.\nSony WF-1000XM5 noise-canceling performance\nAs far as performance goes, these feel like a bump up from the XM4s, though it's not a quantum leap. They have new 8.2mm speaker driver units and three microphones in each bud, and they're powered by two new proprietary Sony chipsets with more processing power -- the V2 Integrated processor and QN2e Noise-Canceling Processor.\nSony's been in a nip-and-tuck battle with Bose for the best noise canceling, and Sony says these buds have the best noise canceling based on its tests. It's not a huge upgrade over the noise canceling that the XM4s offered but it is a little more effective and is quite impressive overall.\nLike Bose's QuietComfort Earbuds 2, these buds are supposed to do a better job muffling a broader range of frequencies. From my anecdotal testing, they're right there with the Bose buds for noise canceling, but it's hard to declare an outright winner -- the Bose also has great noise canceling. So do Apple's AirPods Pro 2.\nAll three of these earbuds have adaptive noise canceling, though you can adjust the amount of noise canceling with the Bose using various mode settings. And all use increasingly more powerful processors and software algorithms to interpret the sound around you to cancel it out. Why I say it's hard to declare a winner is that sometimes one set of buds' noise canceling works a touch better under certain conditions than another and vice versa. And maybe the AirPods Pro 2's tips fit will get you a tighter seal than the Sony's. Or the Bose buds fit you get you a better seal. Alas, when it comes to noise-canceling supremacy, it's not so cut-and-dried, even if a company declares its noise canceling is the best. And software algorithms do get updated and tweaked.\nSony WF-1000X5 sound quality\nThanks to the new drivers and upgraded processors, there are also improvements to sound quality, although it's not a major bump up from the XM4s, which already sounded excellent. That said, I thought the XM5s just sound a little cleaner -- the treble sounds slightly more refined, the mids (where vocals live) come across with a bit more clarity, and the bass has slightly better definition. Everything's been tightened up a bit so the earbuds sound more accurate, which is what you're aiming for from an audiophile perspective. I'm not sure the soundstage has expanded at all, but the earbuds deliver big, voluminous sound that has nice depth and nuance to it (you can distinctly hear separate instruments in more complicated tracks).\nSome of my test tracks include Spoon's Knock Knock Knock, Athletes of God's Don't Wanna Be Normal, The Doors' Touch Me (Take 3), Orbital's Dirty Rat, Taylor Swift's Vigilante Shit, Jvke's Golden Hour and Passionfruit by Drake. I used Qobuz both on my iPhone 14 Pro and Pixel 7 Pro.\nTonally, they're a little warmer sounding than the AirPods Pro 2, which also sound excellent for their size, but the Sony XM5s arguably have a slight edge in overall tonal balance. They're just a very pleasant set of earbuds to listen to and some of the best-sounding earbuds out there.\nWith Spoon's Knock Knock Knock track, the AirPods Pro 2 have a touch more bite or sizzle to them -- I had to lower the volume a bit using the AirPods Pro 2 when switching back and forth between the two buds with my iPhone 14 Pro streaming music from Qobuz. The vocals in particular came across sounding slightly more natural with the Sonys, and the XM5s just sound slightly more refined overall. However, sound quality is subjective, and some people could very well prefer the AirPods Pro 2's sound.\nSony WF-1000X5 voice calling performance\nAs for voice calling, Sony says you're getting its \"best-ever call quality.\" The earbuds have bone conduction sensors that Sony says \"pick up the vibration of your voice directly from your skull bones, helping to isolate your speech from ambient sounds and background noise for clear calls, even in loud environments.\nI was generally quite impressed with the call quality and the noise reduction in particular -- it seems like a pretty significant improvement over the XM4s (the new processors certainly are a factor in those improvements). Under harsher conditions a few callers did say my voice warbled a bit, but we test under some pretty harsh conditions in the noisy streets of New York (in my companion video, I show a test call that gives you a sense of the call quality).\nSony WF-1000XM5 battery life\nBattery life on the WF-1000XM5 is the same as what you get with the XM4s: Around 8 hours on a single charge with noise canceling on at moderate volume levels, and up to 12 hours with it off. The case holds two extra charges. That's a couple of hours better than what you get with the AirPods Pro 2, so very good battery life overall.\nSony WF-1000XM5 final thoughts\nAs I said in my intro, these really are impressive earbuds. No, they're not perfect, and I'm sure Sony will issue some firmware updates to fix some bugs (the Sony Headphones iOS beta app I was using for this review did crash a couple of times on me) and perhaps improve performance a bit. But the key takeaway here is that Sony has managed to make its flagship earbuds significantly smaller while actually improving performance, with incremental upgrades to noise canceling and sound quality and a slightly bigger upgrade to voice calling. And for Android users anyway, there's spatial audio with head tracking.\nApple users may find some advantages with the AirPods Pro 2, whether it's from a fit or features perspective. As I've said before, the AirPods Pro 2 are hard to beat for Apple users -- they sound great for their size and also offer excellent noise canceling -- and they are being discounted to around $200, or $100 less than these.\nI also like the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds 2 and the new Beats Studio Buds Plus, the latter of which cost significantly less. But the WF-1000X Mark 5s really are the complete package, particularly for Android users. Yeah, you could quibble about them not including a wider variety of ear tips and maybe missing a feature or two and costing so much. But they do largely live up to their hype."

      "text": "Pros\n- Improved design and sound quality with smaller case\n- Equipped with more powerful H2 chip\n- Good noise canceling\n- Excellent voice-calling performance\n- Heart-rate sensors\n- Strong battery life\n- Wireless charging\nCons\n- Small percentage of users may not get a tight seal\n- Some features missing from AirPods Pro 2\n- More basic Find My feature (no Precision Finding)\nIt's been almost six years since the Powerbeats Pro were released in May 2019, so Beats has had a lot of time to plot how to improve the second generation of its popular ear-hook style true-wireless sport earbuds. And improve they have -- by quite a bit.\nNot only do they feature a new, more refined design with better ergonomics, but new drivers, a more powerful Apple H2 chip, a new built-in heart-rate sensor and, yes, active noise canceling for the first time in a pair of Powerbeats. Available in four color options, they cost $250, or the same price as Apple's AirPods Pro 2, which are also powered by the H2 chip.\nRead more: Best True Wireless Earbuds With Ear Hooks for 2025\nDesign upgrades\nTruth be told, I've never been a huge fan of the Powerbeats. Not really any of them. They didn't quite fit my ears right, they were priced too high and the original Powerbeats Pro's case was too big. However, I did recognize why many people liked the ear-hook design and the original Powerbeats Pro sounded a whole lot better than earlier Powerbeats. Ultimately, I preferred the Beats Fit Pro, which have an integrated wingtip to help lock the buds in your ears.\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2's design offers a few big upgrades. First, Beats says it's improved the overall ergonomic shape of the earbud and acoustic housing and completely redesigned the ear hook -- it's 50% smaller and incorporates nickel-titanium alloy, so it's both flexible and durable. The buds themselves are 20% lighter.\nThey definitely felt more comfortable to wear and fit my ears significantly better overall. But I still couldn't quite get a tight seal from any of the ear tips Beats provides, which now include an extra-large set of tips that's barely bigger than the large tips. Like with Apple's AirPods, there's an ear tip fist test that lets you know if you have a tight seal.\nTo be clear, most of you -- probably upwards of 90% -- will not have the problem I had. My ears typically require a certain shape of eartip and the Beats ear tips are a little too conical for me and don't quite extend far enough into my ear canal to seal it. Sennheiser and Bowers & Wilkens tips work best for my ears, and that's what I ended up sticking on these buds to get a tight seal.\nI mention this because the quality of the seal greatly impacts how these buds sound and how well their noise canceling works. Basically, if you get a tight seal, both are impressive, but I'll get into all that in detail later in the performance section.\nOne of the nice things about Beats buds is their physical \"b\" button to control playback and the Powerbeats Pro 2, like their predecessor, have that button along with a physical rocker for volume. When you're running or biking, it tends to be easier to use physical control buttons, and this ear-hook design will obviously appeal to folks who worry about keeping their buds in their ears during sporting activities -- or just in general. Like the original Powerbeats Pro and AirPods Pro 2, these are splashproof (IPX4 rated), but Beats says they've undergone rigorous testing for sweat resistance, so they should work fine even for heavy sweaters.\nThough the case is still a little beefy, Beats has made it 33% smaller and included wireless charging, a first in a set of Beats earbuds (hallelujah!). Battery life has improved slightly from the original Powerbeat Pro's battery life. Instead of nine hours, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are rated for up to 10 hours with noise canceling off at moderate volume levels. That drops to eight hours with noise canceling on and you get an additional three and a half charges in the case. That's almost double the battery life of the AirPods Pro 2, and my tests bore those numbers out.\nPacked with new tech\nBeats has managed to pack a lot of tech into the buds. They're not only equipped with Apple's H2 chip (Bluetooth 5.3), the same chip found in the AirPods Pro 2, but ear-detection sensors along with a tiny heart-rate sensor in each bud. Most earbuds I've tried with heart-rate sensors have only a sensor in a single bud. For example, Sennheiser's Momentum Sport Earbuds (2024) feature both a heart-rate and a body-temperature sensor in the left bud. I had high hopes for those Momentum Sports Earbuds, and while the heart-rate sensor worked pretty well, the buds felt uncomfortable in my ears, and their sound and noise-canceling performance fell short, especially considering their $330 list price.\nIf done right, ear-based heart-rate sensors can be quite accurate, and the dual sensors in the Powerbeats Pro 2 are designed to replace a heart-rate sensor you strap across your chest, though not the heat-rate sensor in an Apple Watch. In fact, if you have an Apple Watch, its heart-rate sensor takes precedence over the one in the Powerbeats Pro 2, so if you're wearing your Apple watch at the same time as the buds, your heart rate will be monitored by the watch.\nI'm not doing an in-depth review of the earbuds' heart monitoring here, but I did try it with the Nike Run Club app. It seemed to work fine, and battery life was barely affected. Heart-rate data was archived in Apple's Health app.\nAt launch, Beats has partnered with a handful of fitness apps, including Open, Peloton, Runna, Nike Run Club, Slopes Ladder and YaoYao. With iOS devices, the heart-rate monitor starts automatically when you put the buds in your ears and outputs parsed data every 5 seconds. Beats says all Android fitness and wellness apps with heart-rate monitoring capabilities should be fully compatible with Powerbeats Pro 2, but you'll have to manually start the monitoring.\niOS-exclusive features, but support for Android users\nWith some of its earlier earbuds and headphones, including its Studio Buds line and Studio Pro and Solo 4 headphones, Beats marketed them toward both Apple and Android users.\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 work just fine with Android devices and link up with the Beats Android app, but they do have several Apple-exclusive features, including Personalized Spatial Audio with head tracking, Hands-Free Siri, Audio Sharing and iCloud Pairing across all your Apple devices logged into your iCloud account. Alas, they have the more basic Find My feature for both Apple and Android users (Find My Beats for Android), not the more advanced Precision Finding found in the AirPods Pro 2, which have a U1 chip and a case with an integrated speaker that plays a sound to help you locate your buds.\nExcept for that U1 chip, the Powerbeats Pro 2 seem built on the same foundation as the H2-equipped AirPods Pro 2, and are ultralow-latency and can even do lossless audio like the AirPods Pro 2 when paired with Apple's pricey Vision Pro headset.\nOn a side note, from what I've been told, the reason the AirPods Pro 2 and Powerbeats Pro 2 are able to do true lossless audio with the Vision Pro headset is that the buds and headset sit only a few inches apart, making for an extremely short wireless connection that can reliably transmit lossless audio. In other words, with current technology, you'd have to wear your phone on your head to get a true lossless audio connection with your wireless earbuds and headphones. (I'll spare you a discussion over audio codecs like Qualcomm's aptX Lossless that claim to be lossless and also have specific hardware requirements to work.)\nAll that said, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are missing some of the AirPods Pro 2's newer features, at launch anyway, and that shouldn't surprise anyone. They have active noise canceling, a Powerbeats first, along with a transparency mode to let ambient sound in. But there's no hearing-aid feature, no Conversation Awareness mode that lowers your music's volume when you start a conversation and no Adaptive Audio mode that automatically adjusts noise canceling based on what's going on around you. I'm personally a fan of the Conversation Awareness mode, so hopefully that feature gets added in the future.\nPowerbeats Pro 2 vs. AirPods Pro 2\nAs I said, the Powerbeats Pro 2 and AirPods Pro 2 are fundamentally similar. So how do their sound and noise canceling compare? To my ears, anyway, the Powerbeats Pro 2 actually sound better, and both their noise canceling and transparency mode seem very close to what I get from the AirPods Pro 2. The transparency mode sounds quite natural.\nMy seal is slightly more consistent with the AirPods Pro 2, so the noise canceling on the AirPods Pro 2 seemed a touch better overall, but Beats says it has \"leveraged Apple's best noise canceling\" for these buds, so performance should be pretty similar. While it may not be quite on par with the noise canceling you get with Bose's and Sony's flagship earbuds, it's playing in the same league. Apple has some of the best noise canceling out there.\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2's new drivers, new venting system and amplifier make their sound seem bolder and clearer than the AirPods Pro's, with better overall separation. As you'd expect from a Beats product, these have strong bass performance, but it's well-defined and the earbuds seem pretty well balanced with bass that doesn't overwhelm the treble and midrange. They have a nice tonal depth.\nBy comparison, I got the slightly more pure, accurate sound from Bowers & Wilkin's pricier Pi8 earbuds or even Sennheiser's Momentum True Wireless 4 buds. With the Pi8's, the quality of the bass is a step up, the treble has a little more sparkle to it and the overall listening experience is a tad more immersive, with the Bowers & Wilkins buds sounding slightly more natural. I know it's a little unfair to compare these to $400 earbuds, but when it comes to more premium true-wireless earbuds, the Bowers & Wilkins are among my reference buds for sound quality. (Though their noise canceling, voice-calling performance and overall feature set aren't as good as the Powerbeats Pro 2's.)\nThe long and short of it is the Powerbeats Pro 2 have excellent sound and are a noticeable step up from the original Powerbeats Pro. I also thought their sound was a little more detailed with a bigger soundstage than the Beats Fit Pro's.\nSome of my test tracks include Billie Eilish's Everything I Wanted, Spoon's Knock Knock Knock, Alicia Keys' No One, Pete Townshend's A Little Is Enough, Travis Scott's The Plan, Foo Fighters' Everlong, The Doors' Touch Me - Take 3, Orbital's Dirty Rat, Taylor Swift's Vigilante Shit, Jvke's Golden Hour and The Strokes' Adults Are Talking.\nExcellent voice-calling performance\nHow good is the Powerbeats Pro 2's voice-calling performance? Thanks to the H2 chip, new microphones and voice accelerometers to help pinpoint your voice, Beats has made some big improvements in the voice department. Callers were impressed with how well they could hear me, even in noisier environments.\nI did some torture tests in the streets of New York where I was dealing with not only a lot of traffic noise but a decent amount of wind noise. With a lot of other earbuds in similar conditions, the people I'm speaking with usually complain about my voice modulating (glitching) and having a hard time hearing me. But during the three test calls I made, all the people I spoke with said they could hear me fine and could barely hear any background noise. In other words, the buds did a very good job filtering out background noise while keeping my voice sounding relatively clear and only slightly robotic. You can view and hear a sample call in my companion video review.\nBeats Powerbeats Pro 2 final thoughts\nWhile I personally had some issues with the included ear tips, I do think the Powerbeats Pro 2 are improved in every way from their predecessor and people who liked the originals will be impressed with this next-gen version.\nDespite their similarities, the AirPods Pro 2 still have some advantages, including a smaller design for both the case and buds, and a few extra features. But the Powerbeats Pro 2 have their own advantages, including a bit better sound and battery life along with the heart-rate sensor and ear-hook design that certainly helps keep the buds on your head. Just note that we may see new AirPods Pro 3 this fall that could feature their own performance and design improvements, making the choice between Apple buds even more challenging.\nThere are a lof of new premium earbuds with built-in ear hooks, though the majority of them, like Shokz OpenFit 2, have an open design with no ear tips, which some people prefer. I like the Shokz and some of those other open earbuds, but if you're looking for ear-hook style earbuds with noise canceling and superior sound quality, the Powerbeats Pro 2 are the best right now.\nBeat Powerbeats Pro 2 key specs\n- Weight: 8.7 grams per earbud (case weighs 69 grams)\n- Bluetooth 5.3\n- Apple H2 chip\n- Custom designed, dual-element dynamic diaphragm transducer\n- IPX4 splash-proof and sweat-proof\n- Active noise cancellation (adaptive)\n- Transparency mode\n- Adaptive EQ\n- Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking\n- 6 microphones total (1 dedicated voice microphone on each earbud)\n- Sensors (per bud): Optical in-ear detection, optical heart-rate monitoring, accelerometer, gyroscope\n- Customizable controls\n- 5 sizes of soft silicon ear tips (XS, S, M, L, XL)\n- Wireless charging case (Qi compatible or via USB-C cable)\n- Battery life: Up to 10 hours with ANC off (8 hours with ANC on)\n- 35 additional hours from charging case with ANC off (28 hours with ANC on)\n- Fast Fuel: 5-minute charge gets you up to 1.5 hours of playback\n- Telephony: Up to 5 microphones employed for phone calls, wind-noise reduction, voice accelerometer isolates user's voice\n- Colors: Electric orange, jet black, hyper purple and quick sand\n- Price: $250"

      "text": "Wireless earbuds come in different shapes and sizes, with clip-on buds being the latest style to get some traction in the marketplace. Several affordable clip-on earbuds quietly appeared on Amazon a couple of years ago but Bose's release of its Ultra Open Earbuds, which I called \"daringly different\" in my review, really brought a lot of attention to this style of earbuds, which do resemble clip-on earrings in some ways. Currently, all clip-on buds feature an open design, which means they don't have silicone ear tips that you jam in your ears. Open earbuds let you hear your surroundings, which is great for runners and cyclists, and the clip-on design helps the buds stay securely attached to your ears. I've tested all the earbuds on this list and fully reviewed some of them.\nOur Picks\nHEADPHONE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $250 (save $101)\n- $295 (save $154)\n- $278 (save $70)\n- $280 (save $170)\nRead more: Best Workout Headphones\nBest clip-on earbuds of 2025\nPros\n- Innovative clip-on fit\n- Comfortable to wear\n- Very good sound for open earbuds\n- Decent voice-calling performance\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Look may not appeal to everyone\n- Not great for noisy environments\nThe Bose Ultra Open Earbuds have one of the most unusual designs of any earbuds I've tested in the past several years. They literally clip onto the side of your ears, kind of like earrings, and their open design has micro speakers that fire sound into your ears while still being able to hear what's happening around you. At $299, they're somewhat overpriced but otherwise there's a lot to like about them, including a surprisingly comfortable, secure fit and very good sound quality for open buds.\nPros\n- Good sound for clip-on open earbuds\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Good battery life\n- Wireless charging\nCons\n- Pricey\n- Voice-calling performance could be a little better\nThe well-designed OpenDots One are among the best open earbuds out there right now. While they don't sound quite as good as the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, they're pretty close and fit my ears slightly better and have better battery life. Like the Ultra Open Earbuds, which list for $299 but are currently on sale for $249, they're overpriced but at least they cost less than the Bose and their case does have wireless charging. Read review.\nPros\n- Good sound quality for clip-on earbuds\n- Nicely-designed with comfortable, secure fit (flexible joint)\n- Good voice-calling performance\nCons\n- Somewhat pricey\nThe Soundcore AeroClip are Anker's current flagship clip-on earbuds. Not only do I like their design -- they have a premium look and feel -- but they're comfortable to wear and feature very good sound for clip-on buds. Equipped with 12mm drivers, they serve up ample bass with good volume and decent clarity. The buds sound fuller and more open than many cheaper clip-on buds and are among the better-sounding open earbuds I've tried. (Android users should note that they have support for Sony's high-quality LDAC audio codec.) I also thought they worked well for making calls. For the most part, callers said they could hear me clearly -- even in noisier environments like the streets of New York. Anker says they have five beamforming mics, wind-blocking meshes and advanced AI. Battery life is rated at up to eight hours at moderate volume levels and the buds are IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant (they're splash-proof). Their only drawback is their somewhat high price tag.\nPros\n- Affordable\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Decent sound\n- Good battery life\nCons\n- Somewhat generic design\nBaseus is known for its value earbuds, power banks and charging products. While its Bowie MC1 aren't in the same league as Bose's Ultra Open Earbuds, they cost around a sixth of the price and sound pretty decent for this style of clip-on earbuds, particularly with less demanding tracks that don't feature heavy bass and a lot of instruments playing at the same time. On Amazon, you'll find clip-on buds with a similar design, including the Tozo OpenEarRing ($30) and Amazfit Up ($50), so they're a little generic. But I found the sound quality to be slightly better many competing clip-on value buds. I also liked that they have a single physical control button on each bud for controlling playback and adjusting volume levels.\nBattery life is rated for up to 9 hours at moderate volume levels, which is good, but expect to get les than that because you do tend to have to listen to open earbuds at higher volumes, especially in noisier environments. With an IP57 certification, the buds are splash-proof and dust-proof, making them suitable for runners and bikers. Voice-calling capabilities are also decent but don't expect business-class performance.\nPros\n- Comfortable, secure fit\n- Very good sound for clip-on open earbuds\n- Active noise canceling\n- Spatial audio with head tracking\n- Heart-rate and blood oxygen detection\nCons\n- Noise canceling isn't all that effective\n- Touch controls are a little finicky\nBose's Ultra Open Earbuds may be the best-sounding and most comfortable clip-on earbuds. But they list for $299. In contrast, Edifier's new LolliClip buds cost $130 and their sound is pretty close to what you get with the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds -- and they're almost as comfortable to wear while fitting my ears securely. They also have some features the Bose buds don't have, including active noise canceling (it's not all that effective but you do sense it muffling some noise in the lower frequencies), a heart-rate monitor, blood oxygen sensor and spatial audio with head-tracking. There's also a low-latency mode for gaming and they support the LDAC audio codec for Android users.\nThe buds have a battery life rating of up to 6 hours with noise canceling on and 9 hours with it off at moderate volume levels. As for water-resistance, their IP56 rating means they can withstand a sustained spray of water and they're also dust-resistant. Overall, I was impressed with the sound quality. It's not going to be quite as good as what you get with noise-isolating earbuds with silicone ear tips that you jam in your ears, but for open buds it's quite good. With these type of buds, which allow you to hear the outside world for safety reasons, the bass tends to be a little weak. But the LolliClip buds output ample bass (you have a few EQ settings to choose from, including a bass boost mode) and offer decent clarity. Note that you will have to play around with the fit of the buds on your ears to optimize the sound quality -- a little adjustment can make a significant difference. Voice-calling performance was good but not exceptionally so.\nMy only gripe is with the touch controls. They're a little finicky (you have to figure out just what is the touch zone), but you do get several customization options in the Edifier ConneX companion app.\nPros\n- Improved sound quality with better bass and clarity\n- More comfortable fit (flexible joint)\n- Physical control buttons\nCons\n- Battery life could be a little better\nIn early 2024, Anker released its Soundcore C30i clip-on buds. Not only didn't they sound all that good (they distorted at higher volumes and were a little bass shy), but they weren't all that comfortable to wear. The C40i, which came out in October of 2024, are a different story. Equipped with a flexible joint (the C30i didn't have that), they're significantly better in terms of fit and sound quality, though the step-up Soundcore AeroClip sounds fuller and more open. They also come with attachable ear grips, although I didn't use them because they fit my ears securely without adding them.\nI liked the C40i's design and appreciated that they're equipped with physical control buttons, which makes skipping tracks forward or taking calls easier when you're running with the buds (they're suitable for running and biking). While they're not waterproof or dust-resistant, they're IPX4 splash-proof and their charging case is reasonably compact. While they don't sound as good or offer as good voice-calling performance as Anker's step-up Soundcore AeroClip buds, they're among the best-sounding clip-on earbuds that cost less than $100. Their voice-calling performance is pretty decent but not exceptionally good.\nFactors to consider when buying clip-on earbuds\nBudget\nBefore anything else, you'll want to figure out how much you're willing to spend on new clip-on buds. The quality of value-priced earbuds and headphones continues to improve, so you can find decent clip-on buds for less than $50. The premium models, which offer better build quality and performance, tend to cost more than $100 and sometimes more than $150.\nSound quality\nAll the clip-on earbuds I've tried have an open design with the part of the bud that contains the speaker driver resting over your ear canals, firing sound into them. How you attach the buds to your ears will impact sound quality so you'll have to play around with their placement to optimize comfort and sound quality. Some of the cheaper models don't sound all that good and tend to distort at higher volumes. You may have to pay a little more to get better sound quality.\nFit and comfort\nClip-on earbuds tend to offer a secure fit but their comfort level varies. Having a flexible joint (with some give to it) is important. Also, note that you typically have to make some adjustments when clipping the bud to your ear, placing it higher or lower on the side of your ear to optimize comfort levels as well as sound quality.\nDurability\nYou want clip-on on buds that hold up well over time, so look for models that we note have sturdy build quality and a good water-resistance rating.\nReturn policy\nIt's critical to buy your clip-on buds at a retailer that has a good return policy in case you have buyer's remorse. Some people who are having trouble deciding between two models sometimes buy both, try them out for a few days and then return one.\nHow we test clip-on earbuds\nWe test true-wireless earbuds based on five key criteria, comparing similarly styled and priced models. These criteria are design, sound quality, features, voice-calling performance and value.\n- Design: We assess not only how comfortable the earbuds fit (ergonomics) but their build quality and how well the controls are implemented. We also look at water- and dust-resistance ratings.\n- Sound quality: We evaluate sound quality by listening to a set playlist of music tracks and comparing the earbuds to top competing products in their price range. Sonic traits such as bass definition, clarity, dynamic range and how natural the headphones sound are key factors in our assessment.\n- Features: Some great-sounding earbuds aren't loaded with features but we do take into account extra features. These include everything from noise-canceling and transparency modes (ambient sound mode) to special sound modes to ear-detection sensors that automatically pause your music when you take the headphones off your ears.\n- Voice-calling: When we test voice-calling performance, we make calls on the noisy streets of New York and evaluate how well the earbuds reduce background noise and how clearly callers can hear your voice.\n- Overall value: We determine value after evaluating the strength of the earbuds against all these criteria and what the buds are able to deliver compared to other models in their price class.\nOther sports wireless earbuds we tested\nBaseus Eli Sport 1: The Eli Sport 1 can be had for about $80 (currently $41 on a discount). While they may not sound quite as good as some of the premium open earbuds out there -- there can be a touch of distortion at higher volumes with bass-heavy tracks -- they sound quite decent for their modest price and I found them comfortable to wear. They look more premium than their price would indicate. They have 16.2mm drivers, are IPX4 splash-proof and are rated for up to 7.5 hours of battery life at moderate volume levels.\nSamsung Galaxy Buds FE: Carrying a list price of about $100, Samsung's 2023 Galaxy Buds FE feature a single driver (Samsung isn't saying what size it is), three mics on each earbud and active noise canceling. They charge in a case that's the same size and shape as what you currently get with all of Samsung's latest Galaxy Buds, including the Galaxy Buds 2 and Galaxy Buds 2 Pro. And they look a lot like an updated version of Samsung's discontinued Galaxy Buds Plus earbuds, which also came with a set of swappable fins that helped create a secure, comfortable fit. Like those buds, the Galaxy Buds FE are sweat-resistant with an IPX2 water-resistance rating that protects against splashes.\nBose Frames Tempo (out of stock): The Bose Frames are one of those products you have to try to fully appreciate -- or dismiss. The concept is that you're getting a decent pair of sunglasses with a pair of headphones that don't actually go in your ears. Rather, integrated micro speakers in each arm direct a beam of sound to your ears. That design could be appealing to people who don't like having headphones in or on their ears and also offers a degree of safety for runners and bikers who want their ears open to the world.\nJabra Elite 8 Active: Equipped with six microphones instead of four, slightly improved adaptive noise canceling and wind-reduction technology along with a higher durability rating, the Elite 8 Active looks, feels and performs like a modestly upgraded version of the Elite 7 Pro and Elite 7 Active. Jabra is billing them as the \"world's toughest earbuds\" and based on our tests (they survived several drops without a scratch), that may very well be true.\nSoundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS: What makes these Soundpeats Air3 Deluxe HS buds special is that they sound surprisingly good for open earbuds -- they're pretty close to what you get from Apple's AirPods 3 for sound. On top of that, they support Sony's LDAC audio codec for devices that offer it. Not too many cheap open earbuds have good sound, but these Soundpeats have good bass response and clarity. They're also good for making calls and have a low-latency gaming mode. Battery life is rated at five hours at moderate volume levels, and these are IPX4 splash-proof."

      "text": "Pros\n- Improved sound quality, noise canceling and ear pad design\n- Very good voice-calling performance\n- Spatial audio with head tracking for Apple users\n- USB-C audio\nCons\n- No ear-detection sensors\n- No Apple H2 chip\n- No major design changes except for case\nIn recent years, Apple has produced a lot of earbuds, including a few iterations of AirPods and Beats buds, but precious few over-ear headphones. Back in December 2020, we got the high-end AirPods Max, and nearly three years later, the long-rumored Beats Studio Pro have finally arrived in four color options -- black, sandstone, navy and deep brown -- for $350 (\u00a3350, AU$530).\nLove or hate 'em, Beats Studio headphones are among the most popular headphones of all time, launching as a wired headphone back in 2008. This is the fourth generation of them, and they carry the same list price as their predecessor and look very similar on the outside but have some big changes on the inside that make them significantly better headphones. I'm tempted to describe them as more affordable plastic versions of the AirPods Max. However, that's not quite accurate due to a choice in chipsets and one notable missing feature. But read on to find out what makes this is a very good headphone with some caveats.\nRead more: Best Noise-Canceling Headphones for 2024\nBeats Studio Pro design\nI received a review sample of these headphones a little more than week before they were officially announced and took them out into the streets of New York for testing. Not a single person noticed that this was a new Beats Studio headphone, even on a crowded subway with people standing right next me.\nI'd venture to guess that there was a lot of internal debate at Apple, which owns Beats, about the design of these headphones. I personally like to see some pretty big design changes from generation to generation, particularly when the last version of this headphone, the Beats Studio 3 Wireless, came out nearly six years ago. But the other argument is, why mess with success? We'll stick with this iconic design and just make some tweaks around the edges and try not to reinvent anything. And that's what we've got here. (Note that I said something similar about the Beats Studio 3 Wireless' lack of design changes from its predecessor when they came out, but these days there's a lot more competition in the premium wireless noise canceling headphones market with several excellent models, including Sony's WH-1000XM5.)\nThe two biggest changes are the addition of USB-C charging and connectivity (for wired audio playback) and new ear pads. The ear pads no longer have any stitching, and they've been upgraded with higher grades of memory foam and engineered faux leather. They're apparently more durable, and I think they make the headphones slightly more comfortable. Also, the seamless design creates a better seal around your ear that helps keep outside noise from getting in and helps with noise canceling performance.\nOn a more cosmetic level, there's no obnoxious Beats logo on the exterior of the headband, which I appreciated, no chrome trim near the right hinge with \"Beats Studio 3\" etched into it and the headphones have a label for just the left ear piece on the inside of the headband, not the right. Finally, the headphones do incorporate more recycled materials. Overall, they have a slightly more chill look.\nI can't say I ever liked the hard case that came with previous Studio models. While it was protective, it was bulky and had no pockets for cables. Thankfully, Beats has moved to a new rectangular new soft case that has some pockets and is better overall, though it's a little harder to get the headphones in and out of the case.\nThese feature the same single-hinge design that allows you to fold the headphones up but not flat. The first two versions of the Studio had some issues with the durability of that hinge and the headband cracking and snapping over time, but Beats largely overcame those flaws with the Studio 3 Wireless, and this headphone does feel durable. The only thing I'd note is that the darker colored versions like the brown I got end up showing some fingerprints and grime from your hands. I like the brown and the blue looks pretty good too, but the sandstone color is probably the one you want if you don't want to deal with smudging.\nAs far as comfort goes, these are quite cozy headphones, but I found the Sony's WH-1000XM5 headphones to be a little more agreeable. The Sonys are a bit lighter at 249 grams versus 260 grams for the Beats Studio Pro, and they also don't clamp as tightly as the Beats. The AirPods Max (385 grams) are significantly heavier, but I also found them slightly more comfortable due to their headband's mesh design at the top and the design of their ear pads.\nBeats Studio Pro features\nOn the features side, there are a lot of upgrades but also some misses. In many ways, the features are similar to what you get with the Beats Studio Plus earbuds, and like those buds, the Studio Pro are geared toward both Apple and Android users and are powered by a custom Beats chip, not Apple's H1 or H2 chips. They're equipped with Bluetooth 5.3.\nAndroid users get Google Fast Pair and can download the Beats app for Android to their devices. Interestingly, there's multipoint Bluetooth pairing for Android users with automatic switching between devices linked to your Google account. However, if you're an Apple user, the headphones link to your iCloud account, but you'll have to manually switch between devices, which some people prefer because auto switching can be a bit wonky and irritating.\nTwo things that Android users don't get are spatial audio with head tracking and hands-free Siri -- that's the feature where you can access Apple's voice assistant by just saying the Siri wake command. Unlike the Buds Plus, these do have spatial audio with head tracking for Apple users when watching videos (and they also support Apple's Personalized Spatial Audio that works off a scan of the shape of your ears). In my tests using an iPhone 14 Pro, the spatial audio for video watching seems to be on par with the spatial audio with head tracking that you get with the AirPods Max and AirPods Pro 2.\nBeats notes that Android users get spatial audio for content recored in Dolby Atmos, but that's a standard feature that most headphones offer, including the nearly 6-year-old Beats Studio Wireless 3. For spatial audio with head tracking, you need to be using an Apple device running iOS, iPad OS, Mac OS and TVOS.\nFor both Apple and Android users, there's a Find My feature that helps locate your buds should they become lost, but it's not the more advanced precision finding that's included with the AirPods Pro 2.\nThe one big miss here is the lack of ear-detection sensors. That means your music doesn't automatically pause when you take the headphones off and resume when you put them back on. Most $350 over-ear headphones have this feature.\nI also think it was a mistake for Beats not to power these with Apple's H2 chip. It's probably a cost-cutting move, but going forward you won't get feature upgrades designed for that chip. Right now, it's only in the AirPods Pro 2, but I assume it's coming to the eventual next generation of the AirPods Max and maybe even the Beats Fit Pro 2, whenever those earbuds turn up.\nOn a more positive note, I think it's a big deal that Beats has included both a standard 3.5mm headphone cord for analog wired listening as well as USB-C connectivity for digital audio playback via a smartphone or computer's USB-C port -- though you lose access to noise canceling and transparency mode when connected via USB-C. (The headphones have a built-in DAC, or digital-to-analog converter.) I'll touch on that more in the sound quality section, but that USB-C connectivity for audio playback will become more relevant should Apple include USB-C connectivity on its iPhones going forward, as is rumored. For now you can plug into iPads and MacBooks with USB-C ports. All Android smartphones have USB-C ports.\nNote that Apple doesn't include a wired option for the AirPods Max. You have to buy a separate cable for $35. And using the AirPods Max in wired mode with high-res tracks makes a noticeable difference in sound quality.\nNoise canceling and voice-calling performance\nI found that the headphones performed very well. The noise canceling is quite effective. It's the adaptive variety, so it's not a fixed setting, and occasionally I'd hear it shift in strength as it adjusted to the ambient noise around me, whether I was on the subway or walking the streets of New York. It may not be the best out there, but it approaches what you get from top noise-canceling headphones from Sony and Bose, and the transparency mode allows you to hear the outside world in a pretty natural sounding way with virtually no hiss. I thought the AirPods Max and AirPods Pro 2 were slightly more natural sounding in their transparency modes, but the Studio Pro were close. It's a step down, but just a slight one.\nI was impressed with the voice-calling performance. The headset has six microphones for noise canceling and voice calling, and the noise reduction during calls is very good. It's a big bump up from what you got with the previous Studio headphones. If you watch my companion video reviews, I show a test call I recorded on the noisy streets of New York that gives you a sense of the call quality, though note the call is recorded via the Internet so you lose a little bit of fidelity in my voice. But John Falcone, the CNET editor who I was speaking with, said that he heard almost no background noise when I wasn't talking and only a little bit leaked in when I spoke. He could tell I was outside (my voice sounded a little compressed and clipped), but overall he had no trouble hearing me.\nSound quality\nThese have totally new custom 40mm drivers that Beats says have a dual-layer design and a \"precise array of micro-vents and fine acoustic mesh to optimize airflow and minimize distortion.\" As you might expect, they sound better than the Studio 3 Wireless. You get better clarity and definition along with tighter bass. And they sound really good overall and should work well with a variety of music genres.\nI went back and forth with these and Sony WH-1000XM5, and the thing you notice is that these are a more aggressive sounding headphone, which you may or may not like. The highs are a little more sculpted and everything sounds a little more forward, including the mids where voices live. Both the Sony and the AirPods Max are a little more laid back by comparison.\nSome of my test tracks include Spoon's Knock Knock Knock, Athletes of God's Don't Wanna Be Normal, The Doors Touch Me - Take 3, Orbital's Dirty Rat, Taylor Swift's Vigilante Shit, Jvke's Golden Hour and Drake's Passionfruit. The Beats delivered good detail and served up slightly more exciting sound but the Sony came across as slightly more open and natural sounding (accurate is a word you could also substitute for natural).\nI didn't experience any listening fatigue with the Beats but did find myself dialing back the volume a bit (they play loud). And like the previous model, these have physical volume controls above and below the \"b\" button on the left ear cup that are easy to operate.\nAs I said, the Studio Pro can be used in two ways in wired mode. You can plug them into a standard 3.5mm headphone port or connect them directly to your computer or smartphone's USB-C port to listen to lossless music tracks if you have access to them. I plugged the USB-C cable into a Google Pixel 7 and fired up the Qobuz music streaming service that offers high-res tracks and did notice a slight difference in sound quality. (It's a little cleaner overall.)\nYou can toggle between three EQ modes when you're in USB-C mode: Beats Signature Sound, an Entertainment mode for movie watching and game playing, and a Conversation mode that Beats says optimizes the frequency response for voice, which is ideal for making calls or listening to podcasts. No EQ settings are available when you're listening in wireless mode -- you just get Beats Signature sound.\nBattery life\nThe Beats Studio Pro are rated for up to 40 hours of playback with noise canceling off (at 50% volume level) and up to 24 hours with noise canceling or transparency mode on. You may even do better than that based on my experience. I used the headphones for four days for a couple of hours a day with noise canceling mostly on and the battery life indicator was at 72% at the end of that time. I tend to listen at about 65% to 75% volume.\nBy comparison, Sony's WH-1000XM5 are rated for about 20 hours of battery life with noise canceling on at moderate volume levels. With these types of over-ear headphones that generally feature 25 to 50 hours of battery life on a single charge, battery life really isn't an issue. Also, like the Sony and lots of other headphones and earbuds, the Beat Pro have a quick charge feature that gives you four hours of juice from a 10-minute charge.\nBeats Studio Pro final thoughts\nOverall, these are very good performing headphones that I've been happy to add to my headphone rotation. However, as I noted, they have a couple shortcomings that make them a harder sell against the likes Sony's excellent WH-1000XM5 headphones, which have been getting discounted to $350 or less. And Bose is rumored to be releasing a new set of flagship noise canceling headphones this year that should feature a new design and other improvements for around $400.\nThe good news is that like Beats' earbuds offerings, we should see the Studio Pro on sale a few months after launch. Not having ear-detection sensors and Apple's H2 chip probably allows for some room for discounting, and we should see these at less than $300 and maybe even less than $280 in the coming months. That's still pricey, but if you're a fan of the Beats Studio line, the Studio Pro are definitely a big upgrade over the Studio 3 Wireless, even if they don't really look different."

      "text": "Pros\n- Improved design with more comfortable fit\n- Excellent sound and good noise canceling\n- Very good voice-calling performance\n- Assortment of extra features for Galaxy device owners, including 360 Audio virtual surround sound and hands-free Bixby voice assistant\n- Fully waterproof (IPX7)\nCons\n- Fairly pricey\n- Some key features only work with Samsung devices\n- No true multipoint Bluetooth pairing\nWhen Samsung launched its original Galaxy Buds Pro noise-canceling earbuds, one of its headline marketing messages was the attention it paid to their sound quality. Indeed, they delivered on that front, but a certain subset of users, including me, found them to be a less than ideal fit for their ears. In my case, none of the included ear tips allowed me to get a tight seal, so I had to swap in a larger set of tips from a rival set of earbuds. So, needless to say, I was curious to see what Samsung's engineers had come up with for the second-gen Galaxy Buds 2 Pro ($230, \u00a3219, AU$349), suspecting they'd address that fit issue.\nSure enough, they did. The first thing you'll notice about the Samsung Galaxy Buds 2 Pro -- which are launching alongside the new Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4 and Galaxy Z Fold 4 -- is that they simply have a better all-around design than their predecessor. Not only are they 15% smaller, according to Samsung, but they weigh slightly less (5.5 grams per bud versus 6.3 grams) and have a matte finish on both the buds and case that gives them a nicer feel and makes them a bit more grippy.\nRead more: Best Wireless Earbuds for 2022\nThat makes the compact case a little less likely to slip out of your hand and -- more importantly -- it helps keep the buds in your ears a little more securely. And thanks to their new shape and smaller size, I was able to get a tight seal with the largest set of included ear tips and didn't have to supply my own. Additionally, the earbuds don't stick out of your ears as much as the original Galaxy Buds Pro did, and they look more discreet. They're available in three colors -- Bora purple, white and graphite -- and while I can't say they'll fit all ears equally well, they should provide a better fit to more ears than the original Galaxy Buds Pro.\nProprietary high-res audio and other Galaxy-exclusive features\nAside from the revamped design, Samsung is touting the buds' improved noise canceling and support for 24-bit high-resolution audio. The catch is to get that 24-bit audio you'll need a Galaxy device equipped with Samsung's One UI 4.0 and a music streaming service like Qobuz, Tidal or Amazon Music that streams high-res audio tracks. On all other devices, including Android phones and iPhones, the buds default to the AAC audio codec. They use Bluetooth 5.3.\nAlas, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro don't support the more common AptX Adaptive audio codec for Android devices, only the new Samsung Seamless Hi-Fi codec, which Samsung says delivers 256x more sound data than 16-bit (CD quality) audio. Numbers like that are a bit deceptive because, based on my experience, you're really only going to notice a slight difference when streaming higher bit-rate tracks. But more on that after I round out the rest of the feature set.\nLike their predecessor, these have touch controls (you can turn certain ones on or off, or you can turn them all off) along with an option to activate hands-free Bixby, Samsung's voice assistant. Additionally, Samsung's 360 Audio virtual surround feature (with head tracking) returns in an \"Enhanced\" version and now works with a variety of Galaxy devices out of the gate, though it's not compatible with other Android devices. It works along the same lines as Apple's spatial audio feature for AirPods and can enhance your movie and TV watching experience, though it doesn't seem to be as pronounced Apple's spatial audio, which I think is slightly better overall. It also works with music or any audio you're listening to.\nThe Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are IPX7 water-resistant, which means they can withstand being fully submerged in 1-meter deep water for up to 30 minutes. I had no problem running with them and they didn't slip out of my ears.\nLike their predecessors, battery life is rated at five hours with noise canceling on and eight hours with it off at moderate volume levels, plus you get about three additional charges from the case (it charges via USB-C and wirelessly). You could quibble that five hours is pretty mediocre and that no improvements have been made to the battery life, but it's hard to shrink buds while increasing battery life. Also, when you drop the buds in the case, there's a quick charge feature that nets you an hour of use with a five-minute charge and double that with a 10-minute charge.\nSensors detect when the buds are in your ears and will pause your music when you take both buds out of your ears and but won't resume playback when you put them back in without you tapping on one of the buds (you can use a single bud while leaving the other one in the case). Additionally, you can opt to activate a \"voice detect\" mode in the Galaxy Wearable companion app that automatically turns off noise canceling and switches to \"ambient sound\" mode when you speak, allowing you to hear the outside world and engage in a conversation with someone. Sony offers a similar feature with its WF-1000XM4 and LinkBuds S earbuds.\nAnother new feature worth mentioning has nothing to do with audio. You can toggle on the \"neck stretch reminders\" setting that detects your head position and alerts you when you've bent your head downward for 10 minutes. As I've written this review, I've been alerted several times to stretch my neck.\nLike the AirPods and some other earbuds these have a find-my-buds feature that Samsung calls SmartThings Find. It can tell you your location when the buds were last connected to your device, but it doesn't offer the more precise tracking capabilities of Apple's enhanced Find My in its latest AirPods.\nLastly, like their predecessor and the more affordable Galaxy Buds 2, the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro don't offer true multipoint Bluetooth pairing that allows you to pair them with two devices, such as a phone and computer, at the same time. But Samsung says they seamlessly pair with all the Samsung devices logged into your Samsung account, including Samsung TVs built in 2022 or later and Samsung Galaxy Books laptops built after 2020.\nThe Buds 2 Pro offer automatic switching between those devices. So if, for instance, a call comes in on your phone as you're watching a movie on your Tab S8 tablet, the audio will automatically switch to your phone when you answer the call. That's similar to how Apple's AirPods auto pair with any Apple devices logged into your iCloud account. Note that I haven't thoroughly tested the auto-switching feature with many Samsung devices (because I only own a few) so I can't confirm exactly how reliable it is. I spent more time manually switching my audio between a Galaxy Flip 3 and non-Samsung devices.\nImpressive all-around performer\nSamsung says it's improved the noise canceling on the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro by 40% (it calls it \"Intelligent ANC\"). I found it an improvement on the original Galaxy Buds Pro, but noise-canceling performance is affected by how tight a seal you get from the ear tips (as is sound quality), so your perception of how much it's improved may vary by how good a seal you get.\nI thought the noise canceling was close but not quite there, compared with the noise canceling of the Sony WF-1000XM4, but it did a good job muffling a variety of noise on the streets of New York and underground in the subway. You can turn the noise canceling off or activate ambient mode, the equivalent of Apple's transparency mode, which I thought sounded natural. But there's no setting to adjust noise canceling levels; it automatically adapts to your environment.\nThe Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are equipped with two-way drivers (10mm woofer, 5.3mm tweeter), which is nice, and three microphones, two of which are beam-forming for voice calls. I paired them with a Galaxy Z Flip 3, iPhone 13 Pro and Google Pixel 4 XL and streamed music using Qobuz. I also streamed some movies from Google Play and Netflix.\nAccording to Samsung, there's no way to check whether you're getting 24-bit audio (nothing indicates whether you are -- or aren't), but if your audio setup meets the requirements listed -- a Galaxy phone with Android 8.0 or higher and One UI 4.0 or higher with at least 1.5GB of RAM -- you'll be using the Samsung Seamless Codec, which transmits in 24-bit, assuming your audio files support it. (Qobuz files do.) I find it irritating that there's no way to tell what bit rate you're streaming at, but I'll have to take Samsung's word that I was getting 24-bit audio.\nI did notice a slight difference when streaming with the Galaxy Z Flip 3. However, using the iPhone 13 Pro, the sound quality was also very good with an amply wide soundstage. I went back and forth with Spoon's Knock Knock Knock track and a few other songs. The Flip 3's sound came across slightly more accurately (a bit more clarity) with a touch more detail and depth. The bass is punchy and well-defined and I didn't experience any noticeable distortion at higher volumes. In short, they're excellent-sounding buds, though I'm not sure they're superior to other top earbuds in their price range, including the Pixel Buds Pro, Beats Fit Pro and Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3.\nI mostly went with the default sound setting, though you can tweak the signature profile in the Galaxy Wearable app with some preset equalizer settings, including a bass boost setting. The truth is a lot of these premium earbuds are starting to sound pretty similar and it's really the fit -- and how they fit your particular ears -- that's going to make you like one more than another.\nI'll finish by saying that once again Samsung has delivered a set of Galaxy buds that work quite well as a headset for making calls. They have good voice pick-up from the beam-forming microphones while providing good background noise reduction. Callers said they could hear me relatively clearly in the noisy streets of New York and the buds did a decent job reducing wind noise. They're in the upper echelons in terms of voice-calling performance.\nGalaxy Buds 2 Pro final thoughts\nFor better or worse, Galaxy Buds have always been an accessory for Galaxy smartphones and, as a result, more geared toward owners of Galaxy devices. The Galaxy Buds 2 Pro are no exception. They're excellent earbuds, but you lose some of their key features if you're not a Galaxy device owner. For that reason, it's easy to see them as the Samsung equivalent of the AirPods Pro, which may very well get some sort of high-resolution wireless streaming option with the arrival of the AirPods Pro 2 that will likely use proprietary Apple technology that only works with its devices.\nBy comparison, the Pixel Buds Pro have fewer features geared exclusively toward Pixel owners (virtual surround), and such features as hands-free Google Assistant and true multipoint Bluetooth pairing are available across all Android devices. However, the Pixel Buds have no enhanced audio codec support, which may be important if you're convinced it makes a big difference. I personally think it makes only a slight difference with this class of earbuds, which may have a premium price tag but aren't high-end.\nThe bigger question will be whether it's worth upgrading to the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro if you already own a pair of Galaxy Buds, particularly the original Galaxy Buds Pro. I think that will largely depend on what price you can get the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro for. While their list price is $230, Samsung is currently offering trade-in deals (any Galaxy Buds in any condition) that bring their price down to around $155 and you can often get deals on them as part of a bundle with a new Galaxy phone.\nFor me anyway, while the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro offer some small performance improvements over their predecessor, their design is the biggest upgrade. That makes them the best Galaxy Buds yet."
