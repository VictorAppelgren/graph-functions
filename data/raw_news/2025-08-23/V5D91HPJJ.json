  "title": "28 years later, this anime masterpiece is coming to theaters in 4K",
  "description": "The first (and arguably best) movie from Paprika and Toyko Godfathers director Satoshi Kon will hit cinemas later in 2025.",
  "content": "Satoshi Kon only directed four movies before dying at age 46, but he's considered one of the greatest anime filmmakers of all time. And while his films run the gamut from high-concept science fiction to slapstick comedy, his greatest work is arguably his directorial debut: Perfect Blue.\n\nIf you've never seen it, we have some good news. Following a 4K restoration released on Blu-ray earlier this year, the film is now headed to theaters across the U.S. via distributor GKIDS. Perfect Blue will arrive in cinemas on Oct. 3. GKIDS announced the news during its Anime NYC panel on Aug. 23.\n\nWritten by Sadayuki Murai (and based on the novel Perfect Blue: Complete Metamorphosis by Yoshikazu Takeuchi), Perfect Blue tells the story of a pop star named Mima Kirigoe who is desperate to transform herself into a serious dramatic actor. At the same time, a stalker begins to pursue her. The pressures of Mima's life eventually reach a breaking point as she begins to lose her sense of reality, all while a string of murders seem to follow her career and anyone associated with it.\n\nWhile Perfect Blue and Kon's other films never found mainstream appeal in the U.S. in the way other anime movies have, his influence on Western filmmakers is undeniable. Darren Aronofsky has been accused of ripping off Perfect Blue's iconic bathtub scene for his movie Requiem for a Dream. (Calling it an homage is perhaps a nicer way to frame the similarities.) He's a noted fan of Kon's work. There are also some clear similarities between Kon's dream-based sci-fi thriller Paprika and Christopher Nolan's Inception, though Nolan has never admitted to taking any inspiration from Paprika \u2014 or even being aware of its existence.\n\nBut while plenty of American movies may borrow liberally from Kon's movies, nothing beats experiencing the real thing. See for yourself when the 4K version of Perfect Blue arrives in theaters on Oct. 3.",

      "text": "Welcome to another issue of the Animation Obsessive newsletter! Here\u2019s what we\u2019re doing today:\n1 \u2014 Satoshi Kon v. Darren Aronofsky, in detail.\n2 \u2014 this week\u2019s animation news, around the world.\nWe publish every Thursday and Sunday. If you\u2019re new here, it\u2019s free to sign up for our Sunday issues \u2014 they\u2019ll land right in your inbox, every week:\nThat\u2019s enough of that \u2014 here we go!\n1. \u201cToo much homage\u201d\nAt this point, the similarities between Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Requiem for a Dream (2000) and Satoshi Kon\u2019s cult anime classic Perfect Blue (1997) are common knowledge.\nYou\u2019ve likely seen a few of the side-by-side comparisons. They\u2019ve circulated for years. Each time they reappear, there\u2019s another small uproar \u2014 and old rumors pop up again, like the one where Aronofsky supposedly owned the rights to adapt Perfect Blue (he didn\u2019t).\nThat said, we\u2019re not here to restate the obvious. Perfect Blue and Requiem for a Dream are similar, but we\u2019re interested in the follow-up questions. Why? What really happened between Kon and Aronofsky? And when does homage stop being respectful and start being exploitative?\nWe\u2019ve chased down the answers for months \u2014 dredging up every source we can find, and even importing the recent French documentary Satoshi Kon: The Illusionist. (A tweet thread by Richmond Lee of Art Eater was also a big help.) Today, we\u2019re using what we\u2019ve learned to set the record straight.\nSo, let\u2019s take a trip into the past \u2014 to the turn of the 21st century.\nOnce upon a time, Satoshi Kon was a no-name. Just another artist struggling in manga during the \u201880s. Yet the talent was there, and it carried him. Becoming Katsuhiro Otomo\u2019s assistant on the manga series Akira, Kon was able to follow Otomo into the anime industry.\nKon hopped around as an artist and writer, working on projects like Roujin Z (1991) and Magnetic Rose (1995). He climbed the ranks until he got to direct his first feature. That was Perfect Blue \u2014 a film that, despite glowing reviews, did little to elevate Kon in the business. Here\u2019s how his colleague Masao Maruyama put it:\nLet\u2019s say that some said it was an original film, that it was very striking, and that it left a strong impression. We can\u2019t say that the animation industry considered it a very good film [\u2026] we did not cover our costs.\nBasically, Perfect Blue flopped. Kon was, as he later described himself, an \u201cunsuccessful animation director.\u201d But his film struck a chord with another artist, an ocean away.\nDarren Aronofsky was an anime fan \u2014 and a budding director. He\u2019d just debuted his first movie, Pi (1998), which had a much lower budget than Perfect Blue but made much more money. So, Aronofsky was working on his next film. This was Requiem for a Dream, based on a book from the 1970s by Hubert Selby Jr.\nAronofsky found Perfect Blue while writing the script. \u201cI was blown away by it \u2014 it was fantastic,\u201d he remembered in The Illusionist. \u201cAnd it was very different than any other anime that was out there that I had seen.\u201d\nAt that time, many live-action directors in America were taking from anime. It was often treated as raw material. When Terminator 2 borrowed a moment from Akira, one of James Cameron\u2019s artists recalled that Otomo\u2019s original visual was \u201calmost like a storyboard\u201d for the team. The Wachowskis pitched The Matrix by playing their producer Ghost in the Shell. As he recounted:\n\u2026 they said, \u201cWe wanna do that for real.\u201d And, you know, that was an incredible idea. To actually see that animation come to life. And, believe me, essentially it has.\nAronofsky was so smitten with Perfect Blue that, at one point, he even tried to buy the rights to do a live-action remake. That deal never went through (Aronofsky has given various reasons why over the years). Either way, the film influenced him.\nMost of the events in Requiem for a Dream derive from Selby\u2019s book \u2014 a disorienting, stream-of-consciousness story about addiction and despair. But Aronofsky also incorporated ideas from Perfect Blue, most famously the scene where Jennifer Connelly\u2019s character screams underwater in a bathtub. He remembers reaching out to Kon for permission, although we haven\u2019t seen Kon mention this.\nKon, for his part, was shocked when he saw Requiem for a Dream. In the early 2000s, he told the readers of his blog, \u201cThere are scenes in Requiem that were heavily influenced by Perfect and shots that were copied in their entirety.\u201d He singled out the tub scene, but didn\u2019t stop there. The shared motif of the red dress drew his attention, too.\nThen, on January 18, 2001, the two directors met.\nIt was a conversation at a hotel, hosted by Esquire to promote Requiem for a Dream. They spoke through an interpreter. Kon attended partly to advertise his second film, Millennium Actress. He and Aronofsky followed it with food at a Thai restaurant.\nAronofsky was overjoyed. \u201cI will never forget the meal I had with Satoshi Kon in Tokyo. He was incredibly generous and warm. For a fan, it was a huge thrill,\u201d he later wrote. He said that he asked Kon:\n\u2026 what he thought of the [tub] shot, and he said he was very proud. So, it was great. It was a lot of fun to have that kind of connection with him.\nKon\u2019s view of their conversation was a bit different. \u201cWhen I was told upon meeting him that he was a fan,\u201d he wrote on his blog, \u201call I could do was respond with the vague smile that Japanese people are good at.\u201d\nRegarding the shot, Kon broached the subject by telling Aronofsky, \u201cI was a little embarrassed to see scenes in Requiem that I had seen somewhere before.\u201d Aronofsky replied that he was paying homage.\nAs Kon\u2019s former colleagues repeatedly say in The Illusionist, Kon had two sides. One side was endearing. Kon could be supportive and courteous. Aronofsky saw that part of him. Yet, at other times, Kon could be vicious. He burned bridges. Many of his closest co-workers, even those who remember him fondly, have described him with the phrase iyana yatsu. \u201cNasty guy.\u201d1\nKon revealed a bit of this side on his blog after the meal, ribbing Aronofsky and suggesting that Requiem had ripped off Perfect Blue. He wrote that Aronofsky was paying \u201ctoo much homage.\u201d But his claws weren\u2019t totally out, and he treated Requiem for a Dream as mostly benign. Kon was much angrier when he recalled the meeting in 2007, during a lecture:\nSatoshi Kon: When I asked him about it, he said it was an homage. (laughs) An homage to me! To me! And who\u2019s doing this scene in Requiem for a Dream? Jennifer Connelly. She\u2019s doing this scene. Just like in my storyboard! (laughs) As a side note, last year I was on the same flight as Jennifer Connelly. She was in first class with her entire family; I was in business class. So she got off the plane first.\nRuna Nagai: So you didn\u2019t get a chance to talk to her?\nSatoshi Kon: No, you can\u2019t go, \u201cHey, Jennifer! Damn you, you copy-catted me.\u201d Well, not like she was the one who did it.\nIn part, his feelings were understandable. Aronofsky was a star by this point, while Kon was scrambling for funding. Pi was a hit, and Perfect Blue wasn\u2019t. That pattern played out again with Requiem for a Dream and Millennium Actress. Although Requiem for a Dream isn\u2019t to Perfect Blue what The Matrix is to Ghost in the Shell, you can still feel Kon\u2019s influence in it.\nYou feel it especially in the Connelly character, whose arc later in the movie takes cues from Mima, the protagonist of Perfect Blue.\nIt\u2019s in the tub scene. It\u2019s in the scene where Connelly trashes a room. And what happens to Connelly\u2019s character in the final moments of Requiem for a Dream is a close paraphrase of, arguably, the central sequence in Perfect Blue \u2014 from the blinding lights to the cheering men around the table. Unlike most of Requiem for a Dream, for the record, this scene is noticeably absent from Selby\u2019s original book.2\nAt least for the last leg of Requiem for a Dream, it\u2019s clear that Aronofsky saw in Perfect Blue a source of inspiration for what to do with Connelly\u2019s character. Ultimately, it\u2019s a small slice of the film. But it\u2019s still a slice.\nPointing out that Aronofsky took from Perfect Blue is different from condemning him for it, although you can do both. After all, every piece of art takes from somewhere. Kon was open about how much he learned from foreign filmmakers like Terry Gilliam. Meanwhile, Perfect Blue\u2019s film-within-a-film Double Bind plays much the same role in its story as Invitation to Love does in Twin Peaks (a series that went big in Japan).\nAt the same time, though, there\u2019s an ethical question.\nUntil the end of his life, Kon was a struggling director. Even after two acclaimed films, he was so unsuccessful that Tokyo Godfathers almost didn\u2019t get funded. Is it still an homage when you\u2019re lifting from an immediate contemporary who\u2019s far below you in status and clout? As Kon wrote in 2001, after meeting Aronofsky:\nI\u2019m feeling pathetic. It\u2019s a pitiful tale when the person being paid homage to has less name recognition, less social credibility and less budget to spend.\nAgain, most of Requiem for a Dream comes from Selby\u2019s book. Even the motif of the red dress and the moment when people pop out of a TV, which Kon perceived as plagiarism, are Selby\u2019s ideas from the \u201870s.3 Requiem for a Dream isn\u2019t Perfect Blue. But it does treat its ideas as fair game.\nAronofsky seems to have been a fan, first and foremost. He loved anime, and he loved Kon\u2019s work. The culture of swiping from anime in American cinema predated him. It persists now. As Rodney Rothman (Into the Spider-Verse) says in The Illusionist, \u201cA lot of people in live-action are chasing the \u2018Satoshi Kon feel,\u2019 that level of immersiveness.\u201d\nThat included Aronofsky himself, later in life, when he took from Perfect Blue again to make Black Swan. (He denied it, but come on.)\nIn the end, the real question we need to ask is much bigger than Aronofsky. It\u2019s even bigger than Kon. The question is, \u201cIs it right for Western directors to use anime as an idea factory, without paying its overworked creators a dime?\u201d\nKon bled for his films. He storyboarded every moment in detail, obsessively, and still never saw success in his lifetime (he died in 2010, around a week before the premiere of Black Swan). It stung him to see his concepts treated as the rough drafts for other people\u2019s films. He battled to create those concepts, until the end.\nLooking back on their meeting for his interview in The Illusionist, Aronofsky remembered:\n[It] was kind of inspiring to find out that he was conceiving it, drawing it, writing it, so many of all the different roles were basically coming out of his imagination and the hard work. I remember kind of feeling empathy for how much work he had to do. That it was gonna be a lot of pain, a lot of work to get his film done.\n2. Global animation news\nThe state of animation in wartime\nThe world of Russian animation isn\u2019t heading in a great direction.\nAs we\u2019ve reported, the global sanctions and boycotts on Russia, designed to pressure Putin into ending his horrific invasion of Ukraine, have touched Russia\u2019s animators. This week, the Russian Animated Film Association (AAKR) offered an update:\n\u2026 the current situation in the world has most painfully affected international relations in the field of animation and culture in general. We see how many of our partners from Europe and the United States refuse to cooperate, terminate existing agreements and block Russian-made children\u2019s content. Our films are not taken to international festivals or are asked not to mention that they are from Russia.\nThe AAKR ended with a plea to the world that \u201ccultural cooperation has no and should have no borders.\u201d As a new Iron Curtain settles around Russia, that view seems increasingly of the past.\nThe animation business in Russia is shrinking inward. Take the upcoming film Finnick. It just got signed to a distributor owned by Gazprom \u2014 after Sony Pictures dropped its previous distribution deal. As Western companies back out more and more, like Paramount and Disney did this week, the Russian animation industry will be trapped increasingly in Russia.\nAnd the country is leaning into this isolation. Dismissing a copyright lawsuit, the courts just granted an \u201centrepreneur\u201d named Ivan Kozhevnikov the right to plagiarize Peppa Pig. As one American lawyer writes, \u201cI would expect Russia\u2019s efforts to steal Western IP to intensify in the coming weeks.\u201d\nMeanwhile, domestic social media platforms VK and OK are booming, as Russians lose access to Western-made ones and VPN services get harder and harder to find. For a limited time, VK is reportedly giving 100% of ad revenue back to creators \u2014 which includes animators who share their work on the service.\nThat rush to fund artists is happening at the government level, too. New rules, rolled out this week, make it easier than ever to get state funding. Before, studios needed to put up anywhere from 50,000 to 1 million rubles as collateral to apply. Now, it\u2019s free.\nAt the same time, the world continues to support Ukraine directly. Artists are running \u201cfree film screenings for children and families at refugee reception centers near the Polish-Ukrainian border and throughout Poland.\u201d Streaming platforms in Germany and Poland are providing free Nickelodeon shows to Ukrainian refugee children. And France is rolling out a new fund for Ukrainian artists \u2014 and for Russian opponents of Putin who\u2019ve fled their home country.\nThis week, the French outlet La Croix spoke to animator Eug\u00e8ne Boitsov, a Ukrainian immigrant in Valence who\u2019s helping refugees in his area. Asked about the animation world\u2019s protests in support of Ukraine, he was torn. Part of him thinks they\u2019re useless. But another part believes that they matter.\n\u201cArt and animation will especially be very useful when Ukraine wins,\u201d Boitsov said, \u201cto help rebuild the country.\u201d\nThanks for reading so far!

      "text": "In 1999, Satoshi Kon released his first feature, Perfect Blue, into U.S. theaters. The film would mark the beginning of an illustrious yet tragically short career of animated films that tapped into societal obsession and isolation, themes that still resonate today. Kon\u2019s work, especially Perfect Blue, dove into what it means to have two personalities: one presented to the public and the \u201creal\u201d self.\nReleased at the cusp of widespread Internet usage, Perfect Blue anticipated how the online space would be used to manipulate and scare people, especially through stalking. Kon also addressed growing concerns around otaku, or young people who are obsessed with some aspect of pop culture, and how their obsessions could only be fueled by the access granted by the Internet. In 2019, Kon\u2019s film is more relevant than ever: every celebrity\u2019s action is scrutinized, women with an online presence are thought of as commodities, and everyone has two personalities to juggle day in and day out.\nPerfect Blue follows Mima as she transitions from pop star idol to serious actress. She began her career in the girl group, CHAM, where she attracts the attention of thousands of male fans. But when she leaves the group to pursue a new line of work, those men grow angry. They dissect her acting jobs and chastise her choices. The angriest of all is her stalker, Me-Mania, a repulsive character whose room is plastered with photos of Mima. He creates a blog called Mima\u2019s Room where he pretends to be writing posts by the young woman. Mima, having just received a computer, is learning how to operate the Internet and stumbles upon this site. As soon as she begins reading Mima\u2019s Room \u2014 paired with her new role on the crime show Double Bind \u2014 her grip on what is real and what isn\u2019t slips away.\nIn navigating what the Internet could mean for the future, Kon tapped into male obsession with the female body and a presumed ownership over women they\u2019ve never met. The introduction of CHAM in the film\u2019s opening moments set up this relationship between male fan and female star. Groups of otaku are seen milling around before a CHAM show, buying fanzines, scouring the Internet for news about the group, sharing videos of past concerts, and gossiping about Mima. These groups of otaku, all male, are shown throughout the film, providing a look inside the mind of an obsessed fan and how Mima\u2019s actions are perceived by strangers. As the show starts, crowds of men armed with video cameras cheer for CHAM as they all collectively gaze at Mima and her group mates\u2019 young bodies.\nCHAM\u2019s fans brag about attending almost all of the group\u2019s concerts and feel, due to their support, that they are owed a say in each girl\u2019s career moves. In one specific instance, Mima decides to film a rape scene for Double Bind. Her manager warns against it, saying it will destroy her career and her innocent persona that has earned her so much attention. Unfortunately, her manager isn\u2019t wrong and the gossiping otaku are shown scoffing as Mima\u2019s choice.\nWe see this idea of ownership that men exert over female bodies more and more, particularly when it comes to female online personalities. Twitch streamer Amouranth suffered fans\u2019 wrath after they found out she was married. Amouranth gained quite a large Twitch following but once it was revealed she had a husband, followers were enraged and doxxed her. They thought, since she had never mentioned she was married, she was single and therefore more available. They felt betrayed. Her mod even explicitly told her that he thought since she was single that he had a chance with her. Amouranth made a comment about the controversy and sarcastically said, \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard the news? Every female on the internet is eligible to be dated by people who see her. She\u2019s an eligible candidate for every person who sees her. That is the law of the land.\u201d\nIn Perfect Blue, Kon imagines the worst-case scenario: Me-Mania, who goes to disturbing lengths to claim Mima as his own, and causes her to slip into an unsafe mental state, one full of fear and confusion where she is not sure who she is anymore. Even in the \u201890s, Kon saw the issues of obsession with J-Pop groups and examined how that obsession would only grow with the help of the Internet. Not much has changed when you look at the current K-Pop sensation, BTS. The group is revered around the world, and has become a content-creating machine, fueled by an army of fans who demand access to all aspects of their lives. Like the CHAM-obsessed otaku, the ARMY \u2014 what BTS fans call themselves \u2014 pick over the group\u2019s music, photos, and videos. The behavior of the ARMY mirrors the opening scene of Perfect Blue: fans scouring the Internet for information, swapping stories, and scrutinizing career choices. The members of BTS even have numerous stalkers, some who operate fan sites that include paparazzi-like images of the group. The concept of Mima\u2019s room, one site operated by one stalker, has blossomed into a web of obsession that stretches across the Internet as we know it today.\nWhile the public does not have true access to BTS\u2019 private lives and cannot truly know how such attention has affected their mental states, there is no doubting the pressure fans put on its members. It\u2019s becoming corporate practice for groups such as BTS to cultivate ravenous fans through nonstop content creation, from new songs, videos, and even apps, not unlike the inner workings of Japanese media seen through Mima\u2019s own career negotiations. The world of Perfect Blue exists at the cusp of such practices, where young people are manipulated into idealized images that can be spread among fans like wildfire.\nHowever, even those of us who engage with social media experience a little sliver of what it means to be Mima. We curate our lives and present them online as perfect moments of what we want people to assume are beautiful lives. We are all Mima riding the train, looking out the window and seeing a reflection of her popstar persona. Deep down, we want to please those who look at our Instagram grids, Facebook page, and Twitter timeline. Influencers research how to create the perfect Instagram layout, painstakingly editing images to make sure they all achieve the same lighting, hues, and contrast. Just as Mima begins to lose grip of her reality, we are also lured into another place where everyone has the perfect job, relationship, pet, and life. We slip into a realm of anxiety, trying to prove ourselves to those on our feed.\nSocial media culture is an exponentially larger version of the world Kon envisioned with Perfect Blue. Despite creating the film at the dawn of the modern internet, Kon tapped into the dangers of technological fantasy and the damage it does to the obsessor and the targets of their obsession. In a world dominated by social media clout and follower counts, Perfect Blue scratched the surface of a digitally saturated culture that would blur the line between online personas and reality. From K-Pop fandoms to the daily ritual of posting on social media, Mima\u2019s world has become our own. We all live in Mima\u2019s room."

      "text": "If you\u2019ve somehow never had the pleasure of watching any of Satoshi Kon\u2019s films, this weekend is the perfect time and opportunity to start.\nIn partnership with the Japan Information & Culture Center and the Embassy of Japan, The Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of Asian Art is hosting an online retrospective dedicated to the legacy of the late anime auteur, streaming each of the director\u2019s four feature-length films \u2014 Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers, and Paprika \u2014 in addition to Pascal-Alex Vincent\u2019s 2021 documentary Satoshi Kon: The Illusionist.\nA former manga artist and assistant to Akira creator Katsuhiro Otomo, Kon made his mark on the anime medium through his genre-blurring body of work centered on the inextricable relationship and tenuous separation between reality and fiction.\nBeyond anime, Kon\u2019s films are known for having inspired the work of live-action Hollywood directors including Christopher Nolan and Darren Aronofsky. Aronofsky is one of several admirers of Kon\u2019s featured in Satoshi Kon: The Illusionist. Both 2000\u2019s Requiem for a Dream and 2010\u2019s Black Swan feature homages to Kon\u2019s Perfect Blue, homages that have since been characterized by several fans and critics (including the late Kon himself) as bordering on plagiaristic.\nThe retrospective is only accessible to audiences in the United States and will run from March 26 to April 10. Viewers will be able to stream Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, Tokyo Godfathers, Paprika, and Satoshi Kon: The Illusionist in Japanese with English subtitles starting on March 26 at 12 p.m. ET, after which they will have seven days to begin streaming and 48 hours to finish after a stream has begun. Going by the stated timeline, it\u2019s unclear what will be available to watch April 2-10, but we\u2019ll update this post if or when that is clarified.\nAudiences can register for the retrospective via the Eventive page here."

  "argos_summary": "Satoshi Kon\u2019s debut film *Perfect Blue* is receiving a 4K restoration and will open in U.S. theaters on Oct.\u202f3, with GKIDS announcing the release. The story of pop\u2011star Mima Kirigoe\u2019s transition to acting while a stalker pursues her has become a touchstone for Western filmmakers, inspiring scenes in Darren Aronofsky\u2019s *Requiem for a Dream* and Christopher Nolan\u2019s *Inception*, though debates over homage versus plagiarism persist. Kon, who directed only four feature films before his death at 46, remains a highly influential yet underappreciated anime auteur whose work continues to shape contemporary cinema. The article also notes broader animation industry issues, such as Russia\u2019s isolation amid sanctions and support for Ukrainian artists.",
