  "content": "Explore Ansell's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\n\n\nBuying a low-cost index fund will get you the average market return. But if you invest in individual stocks, some are likely to underperform. For example, the Ansell Limited (ASX:ANN) share price return of 21% over three years lags the market return in the same period. Zooming in, the stock is up a respectable 18% in the last year.\n\nOn the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nOver the last three years, Ansell failed to grow earnings per share, which fell 23% (annualized).\n\nThus, it seems unlikely that the market is focussed on EPS growth at the moment. Therefore, we think it's worth considering other metrics as well.\n\nThe modest 1.9% dividend yield is unlikely to be propping up the share price. You can only imagine how long term shareholders feel about the declining revenue trend (slipping at 6.7% per year). The only thing that's clear is there is low correlation between Ansell's share price and its historic fundamental data. Further research may be required!\n\nThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Ansell will earn in the future (free profit forecasts).\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Ansell's TSR for the last 3 years was 30%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!",
