  "title": "Florida State surprises Alabama as Tommy Castellanos backs up talk: Takeaways",
  "description": "It was a shocking win for a Florida State team that went 2-10 last year, and just as shocking a loss for an Alabama team with Playoff hopes.",
  "content": "Tommy Castellanos\u2019 bravado wasn\u2019t just empty boasts after all.\n\nThe Florida State quarterback, who infamously said this summer that Alabama didn\u2019t \u201chave Nick Saban to save them\u201d in Saturday\u2019s season-opening matchup, backed up his talk in the Seminoles\u2019 dominant 31-17 season-opening win against the No. 8 Crimson Tide in Tallahassee, Fla.\n\nAs important as Castellanos\u2019 steady exploits \u2014 152 yards passing, 78 yards rushing \u2014 were in the upset, Florida State coach Mike Norvell was responsible for the game\u2019s biggest play. With a 24-17 lead inside of 10 minutes and facing fourth-and-1 at his own 34, Norvell chose to go for the first down. Running back Roydell Williams burst up the middle, and ran over linebacker Deontae Lawson for four yards.\n\nThat gutsy call propelled the Seminoles on a game-clinching drive, culminating with a 20-yard touchdown run by Gavin Sawchuk.\n\nIt was a shocking victory for Florida State, which plummeted to 2-10 last year after a 13-1 season in 2023.\n\nIt was an equally shocking loss for Alabama, which hadn\u2019t lost a season opener since falling to UCLA in 2001 and was hoping for a better start in Kalen DeBoer\u2019s second season after missing the College Football Playoff in 2024.\n\nFlorida State won the game along the line of scrimmage, holding Alabama to less than 100 yards rushing while powering past the Tide for more than 200. Our takeaways:\n\nWhen Castellanos made those comments to On3, also saying he didn\u2019t see the Crimson Tide \u201cstopping me,\u201d it figured to end as overzealous trash talk gone bad. It figured to be rebutted emphatically by Alabama. It was noticed, with Lawson saying at SEC media days: \u201cAll disrespect will be addressed accordingly.\u201d\n\nBut Castellanos, who transferred to FSU from Boston College, backed it up all the way. After a rough finish to his 2024 season at BC \u2014 leaving the team late in the season and later getting into a public dispute with coach Bill O\u2019Brien about whether he quit the team or not \u2014 Castellanos no longer goes by \u201cThomas\u201d and no longer has to worry about that spat. He looked well-utilized in his debut in the creative rushing offense of offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn, who originally recruited him to UCF.\n\nThis might be a perfect fit, and a dangerous one for the rest of the ACC.\n\nThings figured to be different \u2014 as in, better \u2014 for DeBoer in his second season as Alabama coach after a disappointing 9-4, non-Playoff debut season. Saban, the coach DeBoer faced the impossible task of following at Alabama, has been bullish about an improved culture and team this season. But disapproving noise from Alabama fans is about to get very loud after DeBoer\u2019s latest failure. Alabama lacked physicality and discipline at key moments, two primary complaints from last season.\n\nDeBoer, who took Washington to the national title game in 2023, is going to get his time. Alabama deserves credit for scheduling this game. But that can only go so far, and this loss could be costly with games against Georgia, South Carolina, LSU and Tennessee on the schedule.\n\nBy early evening on the Saturday of Week 1, the SEC had some wounds to lick, and that\u2019s been a bit of a theme in recent years. No. 3 Texas losing at No. 1 Ohio State and No. 8 Alabama losing at Florida State does not equal embarrassment \u2014 those are quality road games, while most Power 4 teams fattened stats against huge underdogs at home. Still, those are flagship SEC programs and games that help shape conference strength narratives.\n\nLast year, the SEC got huge Week 1 wins for Georgia over Clemson and Texas at Michigan, but went 1-4 against the Power 4 otherwise. Two years ago, LSU lost to Florida State, and a week later Alabama lost at home to Texas \u2014 back when the Longhorns counted for the Big 12 and against the SEC.",

  "summary": "Florida State defeated No. 8 Crimson Tide 31-17 in the season-opening game, a surprising victory for the Seminoles. The victory was attributed to Tommy Castellanos' strong performance, which included 152 yards passing, 78 yards rushing, and a decision by Florida State coach Mike Norvell to go for the first down on a fourth-and-1 at his own 34. The loss was an unexpected victory for Florida State, which had dropped to 2-10 last year after a 13-1 season in 2023. Meanwhile, Alabama's Kalen DeBoer's second season was disappointing after a disappointing 9-4, non-Playoff debut season.

      "text": "Florida State QB Thomas Castellanos calls out Alabama: 'They don't have Nick Saban to save them'\nNew Florida State Seminoles quarterback Thomas Castellanos sat down for an exclusive interview with On3\u2019s Pete Nakos. There, he made headlines with his thoughts on the Alabama Crimson Tide ahead of their Week 1 matchup.\nIn particular, Castellanos called out Alabama for not being the same program as it was under Nick Saban. So, he\u2019s excited to have the opportunity to prove what he and the Seminoles are capable of doing to the Crimson Tide on that kind of stage.\n\u201cI\u2019m excited, man,\u201d Castellanos told On3\u2019s Pete Nakos in an exclusive interview. \u201cPeople, I don\u2019t know if they know, but you go back and watch every first game that I played in, we always start fast. I dreamed of moments like this. I dreamed of playing against Alabama. They don\u2019t have Nick Saban to save them. I just don\u2019t see them stopping me.\u201d\nThomas Castellanos began his college career at UCF before he transferred to Boston College. Amid coaching changes there, he found himself playing for three head coaches in as many seasons. He chose to move on again following the 2024 season and landed at Florida State, alongside his head coach at UCF Gus Malzahn, who is now the Seminoles\u2019 offensive coordinator.\nFor his career, Castellanos has a 58.6 completion percentage and 3,689 passing yards in 26 games. He also has 33 touchdown passes and 19 interceptions for his career. A dual-threat quarterback, he also has 1,427 career rushing yards and 15 rushing touchdowns. In Malzahn\u2019s offense, Florida State will likely look to take advantage of his legs.\nTop 10\n- 1Breaking\nRyan Williams injury\nBama WR leaves FSU game\n- 2New\nGus Malzahn\nTrolls Alabama\n- 3Hot\nSteve Sarkisian\nBlunt Arch Manning assessment\n- 4\nArch Manning\nHeisman Odds Plummet\n- 5\nJon Sumrall\nCalls out Northwestern\nGet the Daily On3 Newsletter in your inbox every morning\nBy clicking \"Subscribe to Newsletter\", I agree to On3's Privacy Notice, Terms, and use of my personal information described therein.\nAlabama is certainly going to be a different program without Nick Saban. Often regarded as the greatest coach of his generation, Saban led Alabama to six national championships before retiring after the 2023 season. The Crimson Tide had a 201-29 record under him. It\u2019s essentially impossible to replicate that success, but they\u2019re doing what they can to under Kalen DeBoer.\nIn DeBoer\u2019s first season, Alabama did take a step in the wrong direction, going 9-4 and missing out on the College Football Playoff entirely. At the same time, there were clear flashes of the capability of the Alabama program, like their win over Georgia.\nFlorida State, meanwhile, is coming off a shocking season where they\u2019d go just 2-10 and finish 17th in the ACC. That was one season removed from winning the conference. It was also a season where the Seminoles struggled to find stability at quarterback. Thomas Castellanos feels confident he can be that stability next season. It\u2019s his third school and a situation where he finally feels ready to play to his full potential.\nEither way, Thomas Castellanos is clearly excited for his opportunity this season. Alabama likely won\u2019t forget his comments either. The two sides won\u2019t have to wait long to prove things on the field, either. Florida State will host Alabama on August 30th to kick off the 2025 season.\nRead the full Thomas Castellanos interview with Pete Nakos on On3+"
