  "content": "Mustafa Khanwala is the Founder and CEO of MishiPay Ltd.\n\nPayments infrastructure may look sleek today, but the foundations were built decades ago, and many legacy dynamics still shape the industry. New players are pushing innovation faster than ever, delivering better experiences, smarter technology and faster go-to-market strategies. The payments landscape is shifting fast, shaped by legacy entrenchment, challenges facing new methods and the rise of smarter, more agile solutions.\n\nThe Legacy Lock: How Traditional Banks Tied Payments And POS Together\n\nPayments and point of sale (POS) have always been deeply intertwined. As a retailer, you weren\u2019t given much choice because banks offered bundled packages: \u201cDo you want POS systems? We\u2019ll provide POS and payment processing.\u201d\n\nThis bundling built powerful relationships between banks and early giants like WorldPay, Verifone and First Data. They didn\u2019t dominate by offering better tech; they tied payments to essential financial products that businesses relied on.\n\nEven today, that lock persists. The leader of a $100 million business seeking a line of credit often hears, \u201cWe\u2019ll offer great rates if you take our payment processing.\u201d The incumbents are still bundling payments with business-critical services, making it hard for new entrants to compete.\n\nThe Rise Of The Disruptors\n\nFor decades, the payments world moved slowly, tied to banking relationships, old tech and complicated onboarding. Disruptors broke that model.\n\nNew providers decoupled payments from banks, focusing on speed, simplicity and APIs. Onboarding could be completed in hours. Businesses could integrate through a modern API and instantly access new payment methods.\n\nBetter experiences and faster deployments allowed these companies to charge premium margins\u2014something legacy providers couldn\u2019t match.\n\nThis model gained traction first in the U.K. and Europe, then rippled into the U.S. As more acquiring licenses opened up, barriers fell, and agility, innovation and customer experience began to matter more than legacy ties.\n\nWhy New Payment Methods Struggle To Break Through\n\nWhen people ask why new payment methods like open banking haven\u2019t exploded in markets like the U.K. or U.S, the answer comes down to a few key points: entrenched networks, superior user experiences and the lack of a true \u201csign-up moment.\u201d\n\nStrong companies like Visa and MasterCard want to keep their structures firmly in place. They\u2019re deeply embedded across merchants, banks and consumer habits due to the sheer entrenchment of their systems globally.\n\nWhen launched, it wasn\u2019t offering a dramatically better experience for consumers in the U.K. and U.S., because we already have systems such as Apple Pay. And looking at it from a user experience perspective, Apple Pay and open banking are the same. You tap, you authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID, and you\u2019re done. There was no compelling reason for the average consumer to switch to something new.\n\nCompare that to markets like India or China, where open banking services like WeChat Pay, PayTM and UPI emerged because services like Apple Pay or Google Pay weren\u2019t established. Those ecosystems were wide open for disruption because the baseline experience was still more manual.\n\nBeyond that, there\u2019s the \u201csign-up moment.\u201d In London, for example, when the London Metro enabled direct TAP access with your bank card during the Olympics, it created a huge inflection point. Millions of people were given a reason to use contactless payments seamlessly and necessarily. Open banking never had a moment like that in Westernwestern markets, a large-scale, practical reason for consumers to try something new.\n\nWithout a better experience and a catalyst moment, new payment methods have struggled to break through. The bar for changing consumer behavior in payments is incredibly high, and Visa, MasterCard and contactless wallets still meet or exceed that bar.\n\nThe future of payments is about fully integrated POS systems. That\u2019s why Fiserv acquired Clover, and Square bundled payment processing with its POS offering. Controlling both sides lowers costs and deepens merchant relationships.\n\nBut scaling from small businesses to enterprises is tough. Large retailers can\u2019t afford one minute of POS downtime\u2014it would mean a massive loss of revenue. Enterprise businesses demand industrial-grade reliability, uptime and performance, making it difficult for some providers to move upmarket. They need to be able to guarantee operational scale.\n\nCustomer expectations are now the biggest force reshaping payments. Consumers want the fastest, best and cheapest experience.\n\nThat\u2019s why buy now, pay later (BNPL) models like Klarna took off. They made it easy: users were already signed up and could split payments instantly. The experience stayed fast and simple, while purchasing power improved.\n\nToday, it\u2019s not enough to offer cheaper processing behind the scenes. You have to improve the customer experience while making it easier on their wallets. Without both, adoption stalls.\n\nThe next wave of disruption will come from smarter credit products, digital wallets and embedded financial services.\n\nCredit options like BNPL are just the beginning. Companies like Adyen and Stripe already offer microloans based on real transaction histories, not outdated credit scores. Instead of applying for financing the old way, retailers can access capital instantly, based on how their business is performing.\n\nWallets will also keep expanding. Apple Pay offers a great tap-to-pay experience, but the future is about more than speed. Wallets will soon integrate payment, financing, loyalty and even identity into one seamless platform.\n\nWe\u2019re also starting to see true frictionless commerce with biometric payments. On Yas Island in Abu Dhabi, visitors link their Face ID to a wallet and pay for rides, food and shopping without pulling out a card or phone. It\u2019s faster, smarter and better for both consumers and merchants.\n\nThe payments industry is moving faster than ever, but the challenges of legacy systems, customer expectations and operational scale aren\u2019t going away. Success will come to those who can blend the best of both worlds, delivering smarter, more affordable solutions without sacrificing the seamless experiences that consumers and businesses demand.\n\nPayments infrastructure may look sleek today, but the foundations were built decades ago, and many legacy dynamics still shape the industry.

  "argos_summary": "The payments industry is undergoing rapid transformation, driven by new players that decouple payment processing from traditional banking relationships, enhancing speed and user experience. Legacy systems, however, still dominate, creating challenges for new methods like open banking to gain traction in markets like the U.K. and U.S. Consumer expectations are evolving, demanding seamless, integrated solutions, which is leading to innovations such as buy now, pay later models and biometric payments. The future of payments will likely focus on smarter credit products and digital wallets that combine various financial services into a single platform.",
