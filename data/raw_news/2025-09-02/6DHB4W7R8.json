  "description": "It will feel like late September and early October for some cities in the coming days.",
  "content": "\u2022 Chicago's high temperature for Sept. 3 was forecast at 76 degrees. The high Sept. 4-6 will only reach 66 degrees.\n\u2022 Grand Forks, North Dakota, is among cities where the high Sept. 4-5 is forecast in the 50s.\n\nAnother cold front sweeping down from Canada will drop already moderate temperatures 10-20 degrees across parts of the Midwest this week before its grip spreads across the Northeast, forecasters say.\n\n\"Temperatures will be stuck in the upper 60s, even lower 60s for much of the Midwest through next weekend,\" AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Tyler Roys told USA TODAY. \"This front is largely going to slowly take its time moving across to New England. It's going to feel like late September, early October for some places later this week.\"\n\nChicago's high temperature for Sept. 3 was forecast at 76 degrees. The high Sept. 4-6 will only reach 66 degrees, the National Weather Service says. Detroit could see 84 degrees Sept. 3 while the high for Sept. 4-7 will only reach the upper 60s. Grand Forks, North Dakota, is among cities where the high Sept. 4-5 is forecast in the 50s.\n\nRoys credited an upper level low system that will be rolling in from Canada. The front will move across the Upper Midwest on Sept. 2 and across the Great Lakes and into the Ohio Valley on Sept. 3. As it approaches the East Coast it will slow down.\n\n\"Especially in the D.C. area, the Philadelphia area, it will be moving at a snails pace,\" Roys said. \"Those areas will get a taste of what summer used to be before the front is knocking on your door Thursday, slowly moving in Friday and sneaking through on Saturday.\"\n\nPhiladelphia could see 85 degrees on Sept. 5, then top out at 75 degrees Sept. 7-8. Washington, D.C., could heat up to the upper 80s on Sept. 5, upper 70s Sept. 7-8.\n\nRoys said much of the Midwest and East could see a return to warmth and humidity sometime next week. But August in the East has been \"unusual,\" he said. In many places, high temperatures were below the \"historical normal\" from Aug. 18 through Aug. 31, he said.\n\nCool but way too dry in parts of the East\n\n\"What is record breaking is how dry it's been. Not everywhere, because there have been areas where you have had thunderstorms go through and get an inch, inch and a half (of rain) in one day,\" he said.\n\nIn Washington, Reagan National Airport recorded only two-tenths of an inch of rain throughout August, Roys said. That is just 6% of normal rainfall for the month. Baltimore's total rainfall, thanks to two thunderstorms, was 2.07 inches \u2212 half the normal amount for August. In Connecticut, Bridgeport only got. 08 of an inch, Roys said. The August average is almost 4 inches.\n\nThere is a chance of rain for parts of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions Sept. 4-6. Not everyone will get it, but everyone needs it, Roys said.\n\n\"There have been tumbleweeds of dust rolling around,\" he said.",

      "text": "Is summer over? Fall 2025 weather forecast is here\nSummer is turning to fall, and forecasters expect lingering heat, big cool downs and hurricane danger. Here's what to know.\nFolks in the eastern half of the United States might be wondering if the current ongoing cool pattern, which even saw temperatures dip into the 20s in portions of West Virginia on Aug. 26, is here to stay. Is summer over?\nForecasters say it will definitely stay chilly in the short term: \"A fresh area of high pressure will move from Canada into the Northeast over the weekend and remain in place for the Labor Day holiday,\" AccuWeather meteorologist Adam Douty said in late August. \"Most locations will experience comfortable days with a good deal of sunshine and chilly nights.\"\nIndeed, temperatures more common for October will trend as much as 15 degrees below historical averages, with near-record lows at night for many locations. Daytime highs will range from the 60s to 70s, with nighttime lows in the 40s and 50s.\nFederal forecasters agree with this prediction, noting that \"current outlooks for early September favor below-normal temperatures for much of the Midwest and East,\" Dan Collins, an extended range forecaster with NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center, told USA TODAY via e-mail.\nWhen does fall begin?\nSept. 1 is the beginning of meteorological fall in the Northern Hemisphere, while the beginning of astronomical fall is still three weeks away, this year occurring on Sept. 22.\nMeteorologists use the calendar to determine the change of seasons, while astronomers and the general public usually go with the autumnal equinox, when the sun is directly aligned with the equator, resulting in equal hours of daylight and darkness.\nWest, Florida will remain warm\nResidents of Florida and the western United States must wonder what the fuss is about, as summerlike warmth is predicted to continue over these areas for most of September, according to the Climate Prediction Center.\nIn early September, temperatures will be most unusually warm in the Northwest, with upper 90s likely, possibly reaching 100 degrees east of the Cascades, the Weather Prediction Center said in an online forecast.\nWarmth will return in the East\nHowever, according to AccuWeather senior meteorologist Chad Merrill, the warmth will return to the East by mid-month: The current cool temperatures should be replaced by above-average temperatures.\nForecasters from the Climate Prediction Center also note that \"we are favoring above normal temperatures for much of the Lower 48, including the Midwest and East, over the month of September,\" meteorologist Anthony Artusa told USA TODAY.\nBut AccuWeather's Merrill does not foresee a return to any extreme summertime heat of 95 degrees or above this season. \"In the East, those temperatures are finished for the year,\" he told USA TODAY.\nWhat is worrisome in the short-term is the lack of rainfall in the Northeast, which has prompted an expansion of drought in New England, according to the latest U.S. Drought Monitor released Aug. 28.\n\"Drought will worsen in New England before tropical moisture moves in for the second half of the month,\" Merrill said.\nMaximum heat index forecast across the United States for today and the next seven days\nHurricanes will return\nAccuWeather meteorologists anticipate periods of increased tropical activity in the Atlantic Basin during the rest of the hurricane season.\nAfter the current storm lull during the end of August and early September due in part to dusty, dry air and cool water in Hurricane Erin's wake, the threat of tropical cyclones is favored to return by the second half of the month and into October and even November, Merrill said.\n\"We are expecting the second half of the hurricane season to be busy,\" he told USA TODAY.\nCurrent severe weather warnings, watches and advisories across the country. See the full-size map here.\nWhat about La Ni\u00f1a? Could it still impact the hurricane season?\n\"Chances for the development of La Ni\u00f1a increase as we approach the upcoming winter,\" Johnna Infanti, a seasonal forecaster with NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Center told USA TODAY in an email.\nThe climate pattern, marked by cooler-than-average sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, could also help boost the number of hurricanes that form in the Atlantic by the tail end of the season:\n\"La Ni\u00f1a conditions are associated with more activity (double the amount) in November when compared to ENSO Neutral and especially when compared to Novembers with El Ni\u00f1o conditions,\" said Matthew Rosencrans, NOAA's lead hurricane seasonal forecaster, in an email to USA TODAY.\nENSO-neutral conditions occur when Pacific Ocean seawater is neither unusually warm or unusually cold.\nHow else might La Ni\u00f1a impact fall and winter weather in the United States?\nAccording to Infanti, some typical impacts of a La Ni\u00f1a winter can include cooler temperatures over the northern United States, and diminished storm track activity over the southern tier of the United States leading to milder-than-normal temperatures and below normal precipitation.\nIn turn, she said the storm track is typically shifted northward, bringing above-normal precipitation to parts of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes.\n\"However, predictions of this event are still uncertain, and indications point to a short lived, weak event. Weak and short lived events tend to have less reliable impacts than strong, long lived events,\" Infanti said."

      "text": "Kiko becomes a hurricane: Hurricane Center watching 3 weather patterns\nSeptember has arrived with the news that the National Hurricane Center is watching a new tropical storm off the southwest coast of Mexico, and a westward-moving tropical wave far out in the Atlantic Ocean shows increasing chances of becoming a tropical cyclone.\nMeanwhile, Tropical Storm Kiko, further west off Mexico's coast, strengthened to Hurricane Kiko in the Pacific.\nTropical storm Lorena forms\nThe most immediate concern is Tropical Storm Lorena, which has formed about 240 miles west of Manzanillo, Mexico and about 345 miles south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas. At 11 a.m. ET, Lorena had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph and was moving northwest at 14 mph. The storm is expected to strengthen to a hurricane over 36 hours, and could cause \"significant flash flooding\" in parts of the Baja California peninsula, the hurricane center said.\n\"Interests in southwestern Mexico and Baja California Sur should monitor the progress of this system,\" the hurricane center said in an advisory early Sept. 2. \"A Tropical Storm Watch could be required for portions of Baja California Sur later today or on Wednesday.\" A watch means tropical storm conditions are possible within 48 hours.\nBands of heavy rainfall are expected to begin impacting Baja California Sur by Sept. 3, the hurricane center said, and could persist through Friday.\nThe storm is forecast to reach hurricane status by Sept. 4, with maximum sustained winds up to 80 mph, according to the center's official forecast. Lorena is forecast to move generally northwestward through Thursday, but its strength and structure \"will have a sizable impact\" on its track and potential recurve toward Baja California Sur.\nThe center's forecast shows a potential landfall over central Baja on Sept. 5, but differences remain among the models used to guide forecasts, the center stated in an 11 a.m. discussion. The hurricane is expected to encounter cooler water and begin weakening before landfall.\nHeavy rainfall to the east and northeast of the storm may occur in portions of northwestern Mexico, from the states of Colima to Sinaloa, the hurricane center said, with flash flooding possible, especially in areas of mountainous terrain. Rainfall totals up to 8 inches are expected with maximum amounts up on 12 inches in some locations through Friday. The hurricane center said uncertainty remains and \"locally higher or lower amounts are possible depending on the track and strength of the system.\"\nScott Overpeck, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Albuquerque, said it's too soon to know whether the eventual remnants of Lorena could bring rainfall to the region, because of the uncertainties associated with its eventual track and intensity.\nCould another Atlantic storm form?\nThe tropical wave in the Atlantic, now south of the Cabo Verde Islands, is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms, but environmental conditions continue to be favorable for a tropical depression to form later in the week as it moves across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic, the hurricane center said. At 8 a.m. on Sept. 2, the hurricane center put the chances of development at 70% over the next seven days.\nThe next name up for the seventh storm of the Atlantic hurricane region is Gabrielle.\nWhat else is in the Pacific?\nHurricane Kiko, about 1,815 miles east of Hilo, Hawaii, has maximum sustained winds of 85 mph as it moves westward at about 6 mph. It's forecast to continue strengthening with peak sustained winds reaching as high as 115 mph by Sept. 4. Its five-day track shows no indication of a threat to land.\nDinah Voyles Pulver, a national correspondent for USA TODAY, covers climate change, weather, the environment and other news.

      "text": "Hurricane Kiko forms in the Pacific. See path tracker, forecast.\nHurricane Kiko has formed in the Pacific Ocean, while a tropical depression is expected to strengthen into a tropical storm on Tuesday, Sept. 2.\nThe National Hurricane Center said late Monday night, Sept. 1 (Hawaii time), Hurricane Kiko was located about 1,840 miles east of Hilo, Hawaii with maximum sustained winds near 75 mph with higher gusts.\nKiko was moving slowly west at about 7 mph, a motion that was expected to continue over the next couple of days. Steady strengthening was also forecast over the next couple of days, hurricane center forecasters said.\nThere were no hazards affecting land due to Kiko, as of Tuesday morning, Sept. 2.\nElsewhere in the Pacific, Tropical Depression Twelve-E was located about 190 miles west-southwest of Manzanillo, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds near 35 mph with higher gusts.\nForecasters said strengthening was expected and the system was likely to become a tropical storm on Sept. 2. The hurricane center said interests in southwestern Mexico and Baja California should monitor the progress of this system, as a tropical storm watch could be required for portions of Baja California Sur later Sept. 2 or on Sept. 3.\nAreas of heavy rainfall well east and northeast of the depression will continue to impact portions of northwestern Mexico from the states of Colima to Sinaloa Sept. 2, with isolated flash flooding possible in areas of mountainous terrain, according to the hurricane center.\n\"Bands of heavy rainfall are expected to begin impacting Baja California Sur by Wednesday and potentially persist through Saturday, with rainfall totals of 4 to 8 inches possible across portions of the area,\" the NHC said in an advisory.\nStorm tracker\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\nHurricane Kiko spaghetti models\nIllustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest performing models to help make its forecasts.\nNHC also tracking a tropical wave in the Atlantic\nThe hurricane center also said in an 8 a.m. advisory on Sept. 2 it is tracking a tropical wave located over the far eastern tropical Atlantic south of the Cabo Verde islands that is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms.\nEnvironmental conditions appear conducive for gradual development of this system over the next several days, and a tropical depression is likely to form later this week or this weekend, the NHC said.\nThis wave is expected to move westward around 15 mph across the eastern and central tropical Atlantic through the weekend, and forecasters give the system a 70% chance of formation through the next seven days.\nHow do hurricanes form?\nHurricanes are born in the tropics, above warm water. Clusters of thunderstorms can develop over the ocean when water temperatures exceed 80 degrees. If conditions are right, the clusters swirl into a storm known as a tropical wave or tropical depression.\nA tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm once its sustained wind speeds reach 39 mph. When its winds reach 74 mph, the storm officially becomes a hurricane.\nPrepare now for hurricanes\nDelaying potentially lifesaving preparations could mean waiting until it\u2019s too late. \"Get your disaster supplies while the shelves are still stocked, and get that insurance checkup early, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recommends.\n- Develop an evacuation plan. If you are at risk from hurricanes, you need an evacuation plan. Now is the time to begin planning where you would go and how you would get there.\n- Assemble disaster supplies. Whether you\u2019re evacuating or sheltering in place, you\u2019re going to need supplies not just to get through the storm but for a possibly lengthy aftermath, NOAA said.\n- Get an insurance checkup and document your possessions. Contact your insurance company or agent now and ask for an insurance checkup to make sure you have enough insurance to repair or even replace your home and belongings. Remember, home and renters insurance don\u2019t cover flooding, so you\u2019ll need a separate policy for those. Flood insurance is available through your company, agent or the National Flood Insurance Program. Act now, because flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period.\n- Create a family communication plan. NOAA says you should take the time now to write down a hurricane plan and share it with your family. Determine family meeting places and make sure to include an out-of-town location in case of evacuation.\n- Strengthen your home. Now is the time to improve your home\u2019s ability to withstand hurricanes. Trim trees and install storm shutters, accordion shutters, and impact glass; seal outside wall openings.\nGabe Hauari is a national trending news reporter at USA TODAY.
