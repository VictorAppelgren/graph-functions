  "title": "Question for students as school year starts: What public event shaped your life?",
  "description": "When Margaret Whitt taught new undergraduates, she would ask them this question: What public event has shaped your life?",
  "content": "Every generation has a public event that is life altering, character shaping. For my generation, that event was the assassination of John F. Kennedy on Nov. 22, 1963. Along with Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Donald Trump, I was a high school senior.\n\nStill today, we ask the question to people who we presume to be our peers: \u201cWhere were you when Kennedy was shot?\u201d\n\nMost remember exactly and can enumerate details associated with that event. This summer I visited with a friend from those long-ago days, and we began to recall the events of that day. Her memory and mine were actually quite different even though we were in the same school, in the same English classroom, when the PA intercom interrupted the teacher and announced the news and what we were to do right then. The details hardly matter these 62 years later, but that it happened had a definite impact on my life going forward.\n\nFor years, when I taught new undergraduates, I would ask them this question: What public event has shaped your life? I began to notice that the answer was often not a unified choice. International students in the mid-1990s did not respond with \u2014 the bombing of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995, or a few years later, simply, Columbine, April 20, 1999.\n\nI taught in Denver, so students from Oklahoma were right there remembering how close they felt to this terrorist activity in their home state. And Columbine was just miles from my campus; some students in my class had actually been students at Columbine when the shootings occurred. They were still inside the nightmare. Some knew the people who had been shot; some knew the killers. These are examples of public events being meshed with private events in their lives.\n\nOther events thrown out through the years: the space shuttle explosion that took the lives of astronauts and a teacher \u2014 many had watched it on TV from their elementary or middle school classroom.\n\nOn another day in September 2001, the first day of the new term, in my 8 a.m. class, I noticed my students\u2019 cell phones ringing aloud \u2014 not one phone, but almost every phone in the class of about 50 or more students. I called for an early break, and students went into the hall to respond to their missed calls. One came to me and said the call was from his mom about her brother (his uncle) who had been on the plane that crashed in Pennsylvania and would it be OK if he left? In years to follow, 9/11 became that public event that got mentioned with some unanimity.\n\nAlong the way, I remember in the 1980s asking my dad when I was home visiting what was the public event that had shaped his generation. He was born in 1905, so I thought he had a few options: WWI (when he was too young to fight)? The Great Depression? WWII (when he was too old to fight)? Without missing a beat, his response was \u2014 oh, when Will Rogers crashed on takeoff in Alaska. The year was 1935; my dad would have been 30 at the time. I wondered for years why he had chosen this moment to recall so quickly. Later, I remembered that Will Rogers used to say that he never met a man he didn\u2019t like. I believe my dad must have favored Rogers because he shared that kind of attitude.\n\nToday what would be the answer from students beginning college this year: would it be COVID? Would it be Jan. 6, 2021? Would it be Tropical Storm Helene? A wildfire? Or something else?\n\nWhat would international students say? How many would lift up a war in their or a neighboring country? How many would lift up a public shooting in their hometown? Would incidents that launched the Black Lives Matter period be offered? What about \u201cMe, too\u201d? What about immigration removals from a neighborhood? Or for some, would personal/private matters so rule their lives \u2014 death or divorce of parent(s), moving from one place to another \u2014 be so large that it would swamp the public event? Or would more students be offering a public event that directly has touched their lives? And, how, might that event shape the person they will one day become?\n\nOpinion: Hold on to long road trips, family milestones, home ... and Mark Twain\n\nOpinion: Small town dining in Western North Carolina is a journey back to happy memories\n\nMargaret Earley Whitt is a retired college professor and lives in Gerton.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Asheville Citizen Times: Oklahoma City, Columbine, Jan. 6 riots: What major event shaped you?",

Other public events such as the bombing of the Murrah Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 or Columbine, 1999, were also mentioned. In 2001, 9/11 was a public event that got mentioned unanimously. Whittly suggests that students starting college might also identify a significant public event in their lives, such as a war in their or a neighboring country, or a public shooting in their hometown. Suggestions for students include immigration removals from a neighborhood or a divorce from a parent.",

  "argos_summary": "The article reflects on how significant public events\u2014such as the JFK assassination, the Oklahoma City bombing, Columbine, 9/11, and others\u2014have shaped individuals\u2019 lives across generations. The author recounts asking students and family members what event most impacted them, noting varied responses that range from national tragedies to personal milestones. It highlights the interplay between shared historical moments and personal experiences, and questions what current events (e.g., COVID, Jan.\u202f6, or climate disasters) will become defining memories for today\u2019s students.",
