  "title": "Tom Hanks Pays Tribute to Jim Lovell After Apollo 13 Astronaut\u2019s Death",
  "description": "Tom Hanks honored late Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell in an emotional post reflecting on his achievements and inspiring space missions",
  "content": "Tom Hanks paid tribute to Apollo 13 astronaut Jim Lovell in a touching Instagram post following the space explorer\u2019s death at age 97.\n\nThe astronaut, who Hanks portrayed in the 1996 film, Apollo 13, died on Thursday, August 7. The actor reflected on Lovell\u2019s achievements via the social media post.\n\n\u201cThere are people who dare, who dream, and who lead others to the places we would not go on our own. Jim Lovell, who for a long while had gone farther into space and for longer than any other person of our planet, was that kind of guy,\u201d Hanks, 69, wrote.\n\nHe added, \u201cHis many voyages around Earth and on to so-very-close to the moon were not made for riches or celebrity, but because such challenges as those are what fuels the course of being alive \u2013 and who better than Jim Lovell to make those voyages. On this night of a full Moon, he passes on \u2013 to the heavens, to the cosmos, to the stars.\u201d\n\nHanks concluded the post, \u201cGod speed you, on this next voyage, Jim Lovell.\u201d\n\nLovell was famous for being the commander in the Apollo 13 space mission, which almost turned fatal during an attempt to land on the moon in 1970. After an oxygen tank exploded en route, Lovell and his crewmates, Fred Haise, and Jack Swigert, were forced to abandon their moon mission and focus their efforts on the difficult task of returning to earth safely.\n\nTheir harrowing journey became the inspiration behind the Ron Howard-directed movie which starred Hanks as well as Kevin Bacon and Bill Paxton.\n\nLovell\u2019s family confirmed via a statement on Friday that the astronaut died in Illinois earlier this week.\n\nTom Hanks and Rita Wilson have proven for decades that Hollywood romances can stand the test of time. According to Hanks, it was love at first sight when it came to his eventual wife \u2014 even if he didn\u2019t meet her until years after he first saw her. Wilson made her TV debut on the [\u2026]\n\n\u201cWe are saddened to announce the passing of our beloved father, USN Captain James A. \u2018Jim\u2019 Lovell, a Navy pilot and officer, astronaut, leader, and space explorer,\u201d Lovell\u2019s family said in the statement shared with multiple outlets. \u201cWe are enormously proud of his amazing life and career accomplishments, highlighted by his legendary leadership in pioneering human space flight.\u201d\n\nThe statement continued, \u201cBut, to all of us, he was dad, granddad, and the leader of our family. Most importantly, he was our hero. We will miss his unshakeable optimism, his sense of humor, and the way he made each of us feel we could do the impossible. He was truly one of a kind.\u201d",

      "text": "Savannah Blackstock Lee, daughter of Brandon Blackstock, announced she was pregnant with her second baby just one month before Blackstock\u2019s death at age 48.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been keeping a couple sweet surprises,\u201d Lee, 23, wrote in July via her Instagram account, which has since gone private. \u201cOne little girl will be making her arrival at the beginning of January and another beautiful girl named Julianna who has already been one of the greatest blessings to our family.\u201d\nShe continued, \u201cThe Lord has been so faithful. He\u2019s written a story we never could\u2019ve imagined, and His kindness in this season has left us in awe. He\u2019s answered prayers we never even knew how to pray. This journey has been so special full of peace, excitement, and so much grace. We\u2019re growing again, and our hearts are so full. Thank you, Jesus. \ud83e\udd0d\u201d\nSavannah and husband Quentin Lee are also parents of son Lake, 3. She is the daughter of Blackstock and Melissa Ashworth, who were married from 2001 to 2012. The pair also share son Seth, 19.\nBlackstock, the ex-husband of singer Kelly Clarkson, died on Thursday, August 7, after a three-year battle with cancer.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d a rep for the family told Us Weekly in a statement. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nNews of his death came one day after Clarkson, 43, announced her decision to pause her Las Vegas residency, saying Blackstock was sick, though she did not provide further details.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,\u201d she said in a statement shared via Instagram on Wednesday, August 6. \u201cWhile I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children\u2019s father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them. I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.\u201d\nClarkson and Blackstock began dating in 2012, tying the knot in October 2013. They later welcomed daughter River in June 2014 and son Remington in April 2016. Clarkson filed for divorce in 2020, and their split was finalized in 2022 as Clarkson was granted primary custody of River and Remington.\nBlackstock had not been seen in public since the divorce, last appearing with Clarkson on the red carpet at the Critics\u2019 Choice Awards in January 2020. Amid their separation, Blackstock relocated to Montana where he founded the local Valley View Rodeo."

All of the stuff that she was in,\u201d Hanks told The Knot and other reporters in 2016. \u201cI was actually at a friend of mine\u2019s house when that aired and remember thinking, \u2018That girl is cute.\u2019\u201d\nAfter meeting on the set of Bosom Buddies in 1981, sparks between the two could instantly be seen. At the time, Hanks was married to his college school sweetheart, Samantha Lewes. When the pair reunited to film Volunteers in 1984, their chemistry was undeniable and a relationship between the two followed \u2014 after the Splash actor\u2019s marriage broke apart a few years later.\nAlthough his divorce wasn\u2019t finalized until 1987, Hanks and Wilson took their relationship public in 1986. On April 30, 1988, the pair tied the knot,\nScroll below to see how Hanks and Wilson\u2019s relationship has evolved over the years."

He was 48.\n\u201cIt is with great sadness that we share the news that Brandon Blackstock has passed away. Brandon bravely battled cancer for more than three years. He passed away peacefully and was surrounded by family,\u201d a rep for the family said in a statement to Us Weekly. \u201cWe thank you for your thoughts and prayers and ask everyone to respect the family\u2019s privacy during this very difficult time.\u201d\nOne day earlier, while explaining her decision to halt her Las Vegas residency, Clarkson revealed that Blackstock was suffering from an illness, though she did not specify the exact condition at the time.\n\u201cUnfortunately, I need to postpone the remainder of the August Studio Session dates in Las Vegas,\u201d she said in a statement shared via Instagram on Wednesday, August 6. \u201cWhile I normally keep my personal life private, this past year, my children\u2019s father has been ill and at this moment, I need to be fully present for them. I am sincerely sorry to everyone who bought tickets to the shows and I so appreciate your grace, kindness and understanding.\u201d\nPrior to his relationship with Clarkson, Blackstock was married to Melissa Ashworth from 2001 to 2012. The pair welcomed daughter Savannah in June 2002 and son Seth in November 2006. (Blackstock later became a grandfather in January 2022 when Savannah gave birth to her first baby, son Lake, with Quentin Lee. She announced in July 2025 that she is pregnant with the couple\u2019s second baby.)\nClarkson and Brandon \u2014 whose father was her former manager Narvel Blackstock \u2014 began dating in February 2012 and tied the knot one year later in October 2013. The pair welcomed daughter River in June 2014 and son Remington in April 2016. During their marriage, Brandon served as Clarkson\u2019s manager.\nIn June 2020, Clarkson filed for divorce from Brandon after nearly seven years of marriage. The exes finalized the proceedings in March 2022, and Clarkson was granted primary custody of their two children. (The twosome had a messy battle in court over property and finances.)\nIn January 2024, Clarkson reflected on her divorce from Brandon, revealing that their marriage was not her idea.\n\u201cI never wanted to get married the first time,\u201d she told People. \u201c[Brandon] had children, a religious background, and it was important, I think, for him. But I\u2019ve never been that person.\u201d\nClarkson explained that her hesitancy stemmed from what she\u2019d seen her loved ones deal with, adding, \u201cBecause I\u2019ve been through a couple divorces in my family, I just don\u2019t like to put any weight on it.\u201d\nIn March, Clarkson shared a rare glimpse into her coparenting dynamic with Brandon during an appearance on Kylie Kelce\u2019s \u201cNot Gonna Lie\u201d podcast.\nWhile discussing kids\u2019 double standards for their mothers and fathers, she sarcastically confessed, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot that I keep in \u2026 because coparenting is fun.\u201d\nBlackstock is survived by River and Remington and his two older children, Savannah and Seth."
