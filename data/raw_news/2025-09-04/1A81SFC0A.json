  "argos_summary": "Canadian small\u2011cap stocks such as Amerigo Resources and Kelt Exploration are highlighted as potential growth opportunities amid a contracting economy and expected Bank of Canada easing. Amerigo Resources, a copper and molybdenum producer, shows strong earnings growth and a low debt\u2011to\u2011equity ratio, while Kelt Exploration offers attractive oil and gas exposure with solid returns. These companies could benefit from a shift toward commodity demand and monetary easing, presenting upside potential for investors seeking value in the Canadian market.",
