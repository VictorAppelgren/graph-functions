  "title": "A Picture Perfect Deal: Save 40% Off the Editors' Choice-Winning Photoshop Elements",
  "description": "Adobe Photoshop Elements provides a quick solution for design hobbyists. You can now grab a three-year license for $40 less in today's deal.",
  "content": "If you're a beginner or novice in the photo-editing space , sometimes Photoshop's full suite of features may seem intimidating. It can also be quite expensive, especially if you're not planning to use all of them. That's where Photoshop Elements comes in. It's a lighter version than Photoshop, but it provides the essentials for novice photo editors. It has also earned our Editors' Choice award for enthusiast-level photo-editing software. Over at Newegg, you can grab a 3-year subscription at a 40% discount, bringing the final price down from $99.99 to $59.99. As an added bonus, you can take an additional $15 off using a promo code. This kind of combination doesn't pop up too often, so don't miss out on this deal!\n\nPhotoshop Elements has handy features such as the AI-Powered Remove Tool, which lets you remove unwanted objects you paint over and replace them with generated background content, making it more efficient compared to manual removal methods. You can also combine photos and use the subject from one picture as the background of a second picture, all without having to use a green screen. Another useful feature is being able to use the automatic selection tool to choose objects in pictures, pick a color, and then change it to your selected color instantly. This can be incredibly helpful in creating different color versions of product mockups or simply just enhancing the picture.\n\nOur principal software writer, Michael Muchmore, awarded the software an \"Excellent\" rating. In our Photoshop Elements review , he said, \"A top photo-editing application for hobbyists, Adobe Photoshop Elements offers many advanced capabilities and AI features in a simplified interface.\" With this standing ovation, act fast!\n\nBe sure to check out our other Newegg deals and photo-editing software coverage .\n\nMore Photo-Editing Software Deals on Amazon\n\nMore Photo-Editing Software Deals on Walmart\n\nMore Photo-Editing Software Deals on Target",
