      "feedback": "This draft nails the high-level regime framing but fails the Section FOCUS constraints and risks dilution by multiple blocks; to upgrade, execute a clean, mechanically compliant Movers section first (exactly 4 lines: 2 Up, 2 Down) and isolate a separate Trade/Outlook plan if an asset is truly tradable. For the 4 movers, fix the time windows to: Up | 3–6 months; Up | 6–12 months; Down | 3–6 months; Down | 6–12 months. Anchor each line to first-principles drivers drawn from the regime map (Regime A disinflation, Regime B sticky inflation, Regime C growth slowdown) and tie probabilities to the published regime weights: Regime A ~50%, Regime B ~30%, Regime C ~20% (base-case sources NL5YYTLF2); ensure the “Driver/Mechanism” column cites the appropriate cause (e.g., wage-growth momentum and Jackson Hole dovish/dovish tilt; tariff posture at 15% envelope; energy regime signals) with precise IDs (e.g., NL5YYTLF2, RHFWI02JT, T1QE6JPIX, J99EM2TPZ); make “What to watch” crisp and event-driven (e.g., wage growth cooling, Jackson Hole signals, tariff trajectory, Brent/WTI regime shifts) and remove all non-mover blocks (Block 1/2, 0–3 weeks macro, Outlook) so you don’t mix horizons. For the 4 lines, avoid generic descriptors and ensure every numeric claim has a source ID; if you need to assign probabilities, ground them in the explicit regime weights rather than ad hoc percentages, and clearly annotate which source drives each probability. Regarding the Trade/Outlook Plan, since ACMR is tradable and has concrete price anchors in the material (ACMR near 30.53, consensus target 34.76 from SK994CBWR), add a Swing Trade line only if you can provide concrete entry/stop/target levels derived from live prices; otherwise keep a single Outlook line or omit the swing details until you can specify defensible Stop/Invalidation numbers (cite SK994CBWR for price anchors). Finally, harmonize all citations so that every asserted fact or number in the four movers is backed by IDs (e.g., NL5YYTLF2, RHFWI02JT, T1QE6JPIX, J99EM2TPZ, SGB2PAZGK, 37UZC9X8I, 22PL3Q360) and reconcile any conflicts (policy/tariff vs energy regime vs Chips Act implications) within the same causal chain rather than as parallel notes.",
