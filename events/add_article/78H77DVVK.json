      "summary": "Russia and China have signed a legally binding memorandum to build the 6,700‑km Power of Siberia 2 pipeline through Mongolia, with a 50 billion cubic metre per year capacity and a 30‑year contract. The new line will offer gas to China at lower transport costs than the European price, while existing deliveries on Power of Siberia will rise from 38 to 44 billion cubic metres annually. Negotiations on pricing remain unresolved and construction timelines are unclear, but the project is gaining traction amid heightened Chinese concerns over Middle East supply security following the Israel‑Iran conflict and U.S. attacks on Iran.",
