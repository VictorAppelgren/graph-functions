  "content": "It looks like the situation is becoming \u201cacrimonious\u201d so settling with flight attendants should be the priority to secure \u201clabour peace,\u201d Tom Fitzgerald said in a note.\n\nFlight attendants who work on the Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge airlines are set to hit the picket lines on the weekend after issuing a 72-hour strike notice on Wednesday. In anticipation of the looming deadline, the company began cancelling flights as preparation for grounding all flights unless the two parties can come to an agreement before the deadline.\n\nThe 10,000 flight attendants, who are represented by the Canadian Union of Public Employees, are seeking pay for work they do on the ground ahead of a flight taking off, among other issues.\n\nBreaking business news, incisive views, must-reads and market signals.

Please try again\n\n\u201cWe appreciate management wanting to be judicious on costs and not offer more than necessary in a negotiation,\u201d Fitzgerald said, adding that he thinks it would be better for airline executives to extend an \u201colive branch.\u201d\n\nHe said that a 50 per cent or 100 per cent increase in boarding pay \u2014 currently that work is unpaid \u2014 and about a one percentage point rise in annual pay are worth it to \u201csecure labour peace and happy front-facing employees\u201d while also securing good public opinion.\n\nFitzgerald also said that the investors he has spoken with are starting to express \u201cfrustration\u201d with management\u2019s approach and see their strategy as \u201cpenny-wise but pound-foolish.\u201d\n\nFor every day of the work stoppage, he said the company will lose $75 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), with a total hit of $300 million assuming the strike lasts three days and then operations restart two days later, something management has suggested.\n\n\u201cUltimately, we still view the business as very attractive and believe the company will be set up well in the years ahead if it can move past this volatile post-COVID period,\u201d he said.",
