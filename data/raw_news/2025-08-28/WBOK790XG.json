  "content": "A California fire captain has been charged with the cold-blooded murders of his girlfriend and her young son to allegedly \u201cprevent testimony\u201d for another crime they witnessed him commit.\n\nCalifornia Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Capt. Darin McFarlin is accused of killing 29-year-old Marissa Divodi-Lessa and her son, Josiah, inside a home in Cameron Park \u2014 just east of Sacramento \u2014 on Aug. 21, at around 9 p.m., the department said in a press release.\n\nWhen El Dorado County Sheriff\u2019s arrived at the home, they discovered Divodi-Lessa and her child suffering from gunshot wounds. Another child was also found safe in the house, police said.\n\nDivodi-Lessa was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nHer son, a second grader at Blue Oak Elementary School, was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.\n\nInvestigators quickly pegged McFarlin as the suspected killer and arrested him shortly after midnight on Aug. 22, authorities said.\n\nMcFarlin, 47, was charged with two counts of murder and one count each of attempted murder, child abuse, and domestic violence, and was booked into the El Dorado County Jail without bond.\n\nAuthorities said McFarlin and Divodi-Lessa were in \u201ca domestic relationship\u201d \u2014 with family members confirming they were boyfriend and girlfriend, KCRA reported.\n\nEl Dorado County prosecutors alleged Monday that McFarlin \u201cintentionally killed\u201d the mother and son as chilling details into the deaths surfaced, according to a criminal complaint obtained by Law & Crime.\n\nThe pair were allegedly witnesses \u201cto a crime\u201d committed by the Cal Fire captain and he gunned them down to \u201cprevent testimony.\u201d\n\nThe complaint does not specify the crime that was witnessed.\n\nProsecutors also claim McFarlin \u201cinflicted corporal injury\u201d on Divodi-Lessa in their bedroom, then grabbed a gun and killed her in the dining room after she tried to use her phone.\n\nHe also allegedly tried to kill the second child, who was found alive in the home, prosecutors say.\n\nThe Post has reached out to the El Dorado County prosecutors\u2019 office for comment.\n\nThe alleged killer made his initial court appearance at the El Dorado County Superior Court on Monday and pleaded not guilty on all counts, KCRA 3 reported.\n\nCal Fire Director Joe Tyler told the outlet Wednesday that McFarlin was off duty when he was arrested and has since been placed on unpaid administrative leave.\n\n\u201cMy deepest sympathies are with the family, loved ones and community of the victims during this extremely difficult time,\u201d Tyler said, adding he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the double murder.\n\n\u201cI too am heartbroken and shocked by this tragic event. This incident continues to have a profound impact on our personnel in the Amador \u2014 El Dorado Unit and beyond.\u201d\n\nLoved ones described Marissa Divodi-Lessa as \u201ca light, full of love and life,\u201d who leaves behind a daughter, Serafina.\n\n\u201cShe always made me laugh. She would always tuck in at night and we would always tell each other, \u2018I love you.\u2019 \u2018I love you more.\u2019 \u2018I love you most,'\u201d the grieving daughter and sister wrote on the GoFundMe page set up to raise money for legal expenses.\n\nShe also shared her brother \u2014 whom she called \u2018Jojo\u2019 \u2014 was a \u201csweet boy\u201d who suffered from \u201csome health issues,\u201d but her mother was always on top of caring for him.\n\nIf convicted on the murder charges, McFarlin could face the death penalty or life in prison without parole.\n\nHis next court appearance is scheduled for Sept. 29.",

      "text": "Emmanuel Haro\u2019s father admitted to killing missing baby and dumping him in trash can: report\nEmmanuel Haro\u2019s father was tricked into admitting that he killed the 7-month-old and dumped his body in a trash can, according to a new report \u2014 as authorities say the baby died after enduring lengthy abuse by his parents.\nInvestigators used an undercover inmate to goad Jake Haro into admitting to the grisly crime, NewsNation\u2019s Brian Entin reported, citing sources.\nMeanwhile, authorities said they can prove Emmanuel died after a long period of physical abuse at the hands of Haro and his wife Rebecca at their home Riverside County, California.\n\u201cWe believe baby Emmanuel was subject to abuse over time, and because of that abuse, he succumbed to his injuries,\u201d Riverside County District Attorney Michael Hestrin told reporters Wednesday.\n\u201cWe have a pretty strong indication of where the remains of baby Emmanuel are,\u201d he added.\nJake Haro\u2019s wife Rebecca initially told cops a strange man had hit her on the head and snatched the kid while she was changing his diaper outside a sporting goods store in San Bernardino on August 14.\nSheriff\u2019s deputies arrested the Haros several days later and charged them with murder, citing \u201cinconsistencies\u201d in their stories.\nJake Haro changed the story from jail, telling cops he rolled over on Emmanuel while he slept and suffocated him, burying his body near a freeway, according to Brian Entin\u2019s source.\nThe freeway story may explain why Jake Haro was seen with investigators in a remote field in Moreno Valley.\n\u201cWe have some ideas in terms of where we\u2019re going to look and where we\u2019re going to continue to investigate,\u201d Hestrin said.\nHestrin pointed to a 2023 child abuse conviction against Haro, 32, who severely beat his young daughter from a previous marriage, leaving the girl bedridden with permanent injuries.\nWhat you need to know about the disappearance of Emmanuel Haro:\n- Parents Jake and Rebecca Haro were arrested on Aug. 22 on murder charges a week after their 7-month-old son Emmanuel went missing in Cabazon, Calif.\n- The mother previously claimed their baby boy was abducted after a man attacked her outside of a sporting goods store in Yucaipa on Aug. 14 \u2014 but police said there were inconsistencies with her story.\n- Jake Haro\u2019s car was seized by police days later for evidence as the search continued for Emmanuel. The father previously served a prison sentence for child cruelty stemming from an incident in 2018 and is currently on probation.\n- Police officers stormed into the Haros\u2019 house and arrested them after determining there was no abduction. \u201cIt is believed Emmanuel is deceased, and the search to recover his remains is ongoing,\u201d the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department said in a statement.\n- Jake Haro was seen in an orange prison jumpsuit assisting police officers in the search for Emmanuel\u2019s remains off of a highway in Moreno Valley, Calif. on Aug. 24.\nHestrin said Haro should have been in prison after that incident, which left his child with fractured ribs, fractured skull, a brain hemorrhage, and other injuries.\nYet Haro received no jail time.\n\u201cThat decision was absolutely outrageous. Mr. Haro should have been in prison,\u201d Hestrin said.\nAuthorities confirmed that both Jake and Rebecca Haro will be charged with murder, but they emphasized that they do not have a precise location for Emmanuel\u2019s body.\nPolice also tried to dupe Rebecca Haro with a similar undercover inmate operation, also known as a \u201csnitch jacket,\u201d but she stuck by her story, NewsNation reported.\nEmmanuel may have been dead weeks before the couple reported the kidnapping, Entin added.\nThe couple have two other children: A 2-year-old daughter and a 16-year-old, who Jake\u2019s stepchild. The daughter has been taken into the care of Riverside Child Protective Services.\nThe parents were set to be arraigned on Tuesday but the appearance was postponed until next week.\nThe Riverside County Sheriff \u2014 which is conducting a joint investigation with cops in San Bernadino \u2014 revealed that they responded to a report of suspected child abuse near the sporting-goods store on the same day Emmanuel vanished \u2014 and that the Haros are linked to that probe.\nSheriff\u2019s deputies said the report involved a home on Cottonwood Avenue in Moreno Valley, just down the road from the Big 5 Sporting Goods, where Rebecca claimed to have been attacked.\n\u201cThe investigation is related to the Haros and no further details are available,\u2019\u2019 authorities said in a statement, referring to the child-abuse report.\nLittle Emmanuel\u2019s body still has not been found."

      "text": "CAMERON PARK, Calif. (KCRA/CNN/CNN Newsource/WKRC) \u2014 A fire captain was taken into custody in a double homicide of a woman and a child.\nA Cal Fire captain has been arrested in connection with a double homicide that left a woman and a child dead in a park in California. Authorities identified the suspect as 47-year-old Darin McFarlin, who is accused of killing a woman he was involved with and a boy under the age of 18.\nDeputies responded to a 911 call reporting the shootings around 9 p.m. Thursday at McFarlin's home. Sergeant Kyle Parker of the El Dorado County Sheriff's Office told KCRA, \"Life saving measures were attempted on both. But, the adult was unfortunately deceased, pronounced there at the scene.\"\nThe boy was transported to a hospital, where he later died. According to KCRA, the victims were identified as 29-year-old Marissa Divondi-Lessa and her son, Josiah Divodi-Lessa, who was said to have been in the second grade.\n\"The suspect and the adult victim were in a domestic relationship. Now, what kind of how that defines out, as far as, you know, married or dating, I don't know at this time,\" Parker told the outlet.\nKCRA reported that the victim's family said McFarlina nd Divodi-Lessa were in \"a domestic relationship.\"\nThe home, located on Oakwood Road, is described by neighbors as a quiet area. One neighbor expressed shock upon learning of the violence, having seen McFarlin earlier that morning and exchanged a friendly wave.\nDeputies tracked McFarlin to Mono County near the Nevada border around midnight, where he was arrested without resistance. \"I believe it was just kind of on, based information from the reporting party and then also to kind of what they found on scene for those initial deputies kind of responding,\" Parker told the station.\nInside the home, another child under the age of 18 was found unharmed. Authorities are still investigating the child's connection to the incident and whether they made the 911 call.\nAs detectives continue to search for a motive, McFarlin remains in custody without bond."

      "text": "Minneapolis school shooter ID\u2019d as trans woman Robin Westman \u2014 as apparent manifesto included \u2018kill Trump\u2019\nThe deranged gunman who slaughtered two children and injured at least 17 others at a Catholic school in Minneapolis has been identified as a transgender woman \u2014 as disturbing videos posted by the shooter show a handwritten manifesto and \u201ckill Donald Trump\u201d and \u201cfor the children\u201d scrawled on gun magazines.\nRobin Westman, formerly Robert Westman, opened fire through the stained glass windows of a church at the Annunciation Catholic School \u2014 where he attended \u2014 during a celebratory back-to-school Mass filled with children around 8:30 a.m. Wednesday.\nJust hours before the cowardly massacre, Westman, 23, posted a series of twisted videos on YouTube, which included a manifesto, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara confirmed at a press conference.\nIn one 20-minute video, Westman flips through the disturbing handwritten manifesto. Much of it is written in a homespun code that uses Cyrillic characters and English phonetic words.\nIn the deranged writings, he gleefully fantasizes about \u201cbeing that scary horrible monster standing over those powerless kids\u201d and reverently confesses admiration for the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre.\nWestman applied to change his birth name from Robert to Robin in Dakota County, Minn., when he was 17 years old, according to court documents. That name change was granted in January 2020.\nThe petition added that Westman \u201cidentifies as a female and wants her name to reflect that identification.\u201d\nBut, five years later, he seemed to have backed away from that identity.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to dress girly all the time but I guess sometimes I really like it. I know I am not a woman but I definitely don\u2019t feel like a man,\u201d he wrote.\n\u201cI really like my outfit. I look pretty, smart and modest. I think I want to wear something like this for my shooting.\u201d\nHe also goes into great detail about his decision to target Annunciation, where he graduated from grade school in 2017, according to a yearbook obtained by CNN.\nHis mother, Mary Grace Westman, also worked as a secretary at the school until retiring in 2021, according to a Facebook post by the church.\n\u201cI am feeling good about Annunciation. It seems like a good combo of easy attack form and devastating tragedy and I want to do more research. I have concerns about finding a large enough group. I want to avoid any parents, but pre and post school drop off,\u201d another page reads.\n\u201cMaybe I could attack an event at the on-site church,\u201d he ominously scribbled. \u201cI think attacking a large group of kids coming in from recess is my best plan \u2026 Then from there I can go inside and kill, going for as long as I can.\u201d\nNear the end of the video, Westman flicks through a number of blank pages before reaching what appears to be a drawing showing the inside of a church, saying \u201cHaha, nice\u201d as he stops turning pages.\nHe then takes out a knife and stabs into the center of the sketch, his hand momentarily quivering before he withdraws the blade, and quietly mumbles, \u201ckill myself.\u201d\nIn a video, titled \u201cSo long and thanks for all the fish,\u201d Westman slowly turns the pages of the red notebook, which is laid out on top of what appears to be schematic gun diagrams, one of them reading Ruger Mark IV \u2014 a type of small-caliber pistol.\nAs he flips the pages, an occasional plume of smoke is seen from the bottom of the screen, punctuated by coughs, disjointed cursing and maniacal giggles.\nEach page is filled with inscrutable handwritten doggerel, which includes violent ramblings such as \u201cI have had thoughts about mass murder for a long time. I am very conflicted with writing this journal,\u201d the text, translated by The Post, reads in part.\n\u201cI need to get my thoughts out without getting on a watchlist haha!\u201d\nHere is the latest on the mass shooting at a Minneapolis Catholic school:\n- First surviving victim in Minneapolis school shooting ID\u2019d, now out of surgery\n- Minneapolis mayor uses Catholic school shooting presser to speak out about transgender rights \u2014 as gunman ID\u2019d as trans\n- Melania Trump \u2018shattered\u2019 to \u2018senseless and depraved\u2019 Minnesota school shooting, calls for \u2018pre-emptive intervention\u2019\nThe journal contains a number of other subtle clues about Weston\u2019s identity \u2014 hinting at an angry melange of far-left politics and antisemitism.\nOne page includes a trans pride flag sticker with \u201cDefend equality\u201d printed across the bottom, with a black AK-47 sticker laid on top.\nIn another entry, he writes, \u201cIf I carry out a racially motivated attack, it would be most likely against filthy Zionist jews,\u201d before calling Jewish people \u201centitled\u201d and \u201cpenny-sniffing\u201d before adding \u201cFREE PALESTINE!\u201d\n\u201cI hate fascism,\u201d read yet another page, following it up shortly after with \u201cI also love when kids get shot, I love to see kids get torn apart.\u201d\nHe later bemoaned the media, saying he is \u201ctired of the news headlines.\u201d\n\u201cThey only talk about brown people dying and I don\u2019t care about them. I like to hear when Israelis get killed, but they don\u2019t like to report on that stuff,\u201d he wrote.\nThe demented manifesto sheds light on what appears to be a truly disturbed mind, with Weston musing about a grand \u201cfinal act\u201d \u2014 stating a desire to take out \u201ca target of political or societal significance\u201d before he died.\n\u201cTargets like [Elon] Musk, Trump or some significant exec.\u201d\nBut, he also claimed he had no political motive.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to [do] it to spread a message. I do it to please myself. I do it because I am sick,\u201d he wrote.\nHe also indicated that he knew the Annunciation shooting would culminate in his death and complained about apparent health issues.\n\u201cI think I might have some prostate problems. I have to piss so frequently and I\u2019m sick of it. Even if I can heal, I still just want to die and kill many people,\u201d the journal read.\nThe unhinged shooter went on to express sincere admiration for mass shooters \u2014 including Sandy Hook killer Adam Lanza.\n\u201cI have a deep fascination with one man in particular: Adam Lanza,\u201d he wrote in the journal on May 23 in reference to the 20-year-old perpetrator of the worst elementary school shooting in US history, which left 20 first-grade students and six adults dead.\n\u201cSandy Hook was my favorite, I think, exposure of school shootings.\u201d\nAnother video posted to YouTube in the hours before the sickening slaughter showed off a cache of weapons \u2014 including a semi-automatic rifle and a shotgun.\nGun magazines were scrawled with \u201cfor the children\u201d and \u201ckill Donald Trump.\u201d\nWestman, who died at the scene of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, was armed with a rifle, a shotgun and a handgun \u2014 all of which he bought legally, cops said.\nThe shooter was not previously known to law enforcement, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O\u2019Hara told reporters at a press conference."

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.
