  "content": "It sounds like President Trump no longer thinks Intel's CEO should resign. Trump has revealed on Truth Social that he met with Lip-Bu Tan, Howard Lutnick, the Secretary of Commerce, and Howard Lutnick, the Secretary of the Treasury. He didn't discuss the details of their meeting, but he described it as \"a very interesting one.\" Trump added: \"His success and rise is an amazing story.\" If you'll recall, Trump alleged that Tan was \"highly conflicted\" due to his investments in hundreds of Chinese firms and should resign. Reuters had previously reported that some of those companies had links to the Chinese military. \"Mr. Tan and my Cabinet members are going to spend time together, and bring suggestions to me during the next week,\" Trump said in his post.\n\nAccording to a report by the Financial Times, Tan wrote a letter to Intel employees about the issue, telling that there had been a lot of misinformation about the roles he'd held. \"I wanted to be absolutely clear... I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards,\" he reportedly wrote in the letter. He also said that Intel was communicating with the White House \"to address the matters that have been raised and ensure they have the facts.\"\n\nTrump's call for Tan to resign reportedly came about due a letter from Tom Cotton, the Republican head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, to the Intel CEO. Cotton apparently expressed concerns aout the \"security and integrity of Intel's operations\" due to Tan's ties with China. Tan was named the CEO of Intel in March, taking over a company that was losing money due to its foundry business being unable to secure big customers and lagging behind rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor. Since taking over, Tan has enforced several cost-cutting measures, including cutting jobs with the goal of reducing its workforce by 22 percent by the end of the year. He also recently told investors that Intel could abandon the development of its next-gen manufacturing technology if it fails to secure a large client.",

      "text": "Intel is separating its ailing foundry business from the main company\nIt will allow the foundry business to accept external sources of funding.\nIntel is turning its foundry business, which manufactures chips for other companies, into an independent subsidiary. The company has revealed its plan in a note to employees from its CEO Pat Gelsinger, published over a month after Intel disclosed that it's cutting 15 percent of its workforce. Intel is laying off more than 15,000 people as part of its $10 billion cost-reduction plan to regain financial stability following a second-quarter net loss of $1.6 billion. Gelsinger explained in his new memo that turning the foundry into a subsidiary \"will unlock important benefits,\" particularly the ability to evaluate and take external funding directly.\nGelsinger said that there will be no changes to the foundry's leadership, but the subsidiary will establish its own operating board with independent directors to govern it. According to CNBC, Intel is even considering making the foundry a separate publicly traded company. Intel is in the midst of modernizing its existing fabs and building new ones for its foundry business, which is costing the company billions of dollars, in an effort to catch up to its chipmaking rivals like TSMC and Samsung. The company has reportedly spent around $25 billion a year on its foundry business over the past two years, but that has yet to translate into profit.\nIn April, the company revealed in a presentation to investors that the business posted $7 billion in operating losses for 2023, even larger than the $5.2 billion in losses that it incurred the previous year. It had a revenue of $18.9 billion, down 31 percent from its 2022 revenue of $27.49 billion. Gelsinger warned investors at the time that Intel expects its foundry business' operating loss for 2024 to be even bigger and that it doesn't expect to break even until 2027. The foundry's finances aren't the division's only problem: Its next-gen manufacturing process referred to as \"18A\" reportedly failed crucial tests to prove that it's ready to be used for mass production.\nIn addition to announcing that the foundry business will become a subsidiary, Gelsinger also disclosed in the memo that Intel will be selling part of its stake in Altera, another chipmaker that it purchased for $16.7 billion in 2015."

      "text": "Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan responds to Trump comments that he should resign\n'There has been a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles,' he said.\nIntel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has responded after Donald Trump accused him of being \"highly conflicted\" and said he should resign, according to The Financial Times. \"There has been a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles,\" Tan said in a letter to Intel staff. \"I wanted to be absolutely clear... I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards.\" Tan said that Intel was engaging with the White House \"to address the matters that have been raised and ensure they have the facts.\"\nTrump's Truth Social post demanding Tan's resignation reportedly came about due to letter to Tan from Tom Cotton, the Republican head of the Senate Intelligence Committee. In it, Cotton \"expressed concern about the security and integrity of Intel's operations\" along with Tan's previous work in China. Tan has invested in Chinese tech companies through his own venture capital firm, including SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp.), China's biggest chip maker.\nIn addition, a company that Tan ran before being appointed Intel chief admitted last week to violating US export controls by \"unlawfully exporting semiconductor design tools to a restricted PRC [Chinese] military university,\" according to the US Department of Justice. The company agreed to plead guilty and pay criminal penalties totalling over $140 million dollars.\nTan took over a very leaky ship with Intel, which has bled red ink over the failure of its foundry business to keep up with rivals like TSMC and win customers. Since taking the job, he launched a cost-cutting program and said that Intel may need to abandon its next-gen fab tech \u2014 which hasn't shown great results to date \u2014 if it can't find a large customer. In the same letter, Tan said Intel's board is \"fully supportive\" of that work.\nTrump has meddled with corporations ranging from Apple to Bank of America, making him what one pundit called \"the most interventionist White House in my lifetime,\" particularly for a Republican. \"So many Wall Street folks worried that past Democratic administrations would interfere in their business,\" said MSNBC journalist and lawyer Ari Melber. \"But this first year of Trump's second term has done so much more than any modern administration.\"\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."
