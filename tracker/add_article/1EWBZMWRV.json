      "summary": "California Democrats, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, are set to approve a new congressional map that creates five Democratic‑leaning seats, a direct counter to the Texas GOP’s plan to add up to five Republican seats. Newsom’s strategy involves a supermajority vote, a November special election, and a signature deadline, all while navigating an independent commission that voters can override. Texas Republicans passed their map after a contentious session, prompting Democratic protests and a threat of legal challenge, while former President Obama publicly backed Newsom’s move. Trump’s push for partisan redistricting extends beyond Texas to states like Indiana and Missouri, and the Supreme Court’s endorsement of partisan gerrymandering leaves Democrats with limited options beyond litigation and voter approval.",
