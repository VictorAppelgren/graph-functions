  "description": "Colorado coach Deion Sanders is adding a new quarterback to the mix after a season-opening loss to Georgia Tech.",
  "content": "\u2022 Freshman quarterback Julian \"Juju\" Lewis will see playing time after not appearing in the season-opening loss.\n\u2022 Starting quarterback Kaidon Salter completed 17 of 28 passes for 159 yards and one touchdown against Georgia Tech.\n\u2022 Sanders had always planned to play Lewis this season but did not specify if the freshman would start.\n\nColorado football coach Deion Sanders said Tuesday, Sept. 2, that he will introduce a new element to his offense after his team got beat in a season-opening loss against Georgia Tech.\n\nInstead of playing just one quarterback, the Buffaloes seem likely to play two, this time with freshman Julian \u201cJuju\u201d Lewis. Sanders said Lewis would play this Saturday against Delaware (0-1) after he didn\u2019t see the field last week in the 27-20 defeat to the Yellow Jackets.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s playing this week for sure,\u201d Sanders said at his weekly news conference in Boulder. \u201cI know when I\u2019m going to see him. You just don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to see him.\u201d\n\nLiberty transfer quarterback Kaidon Salter started the season opener and completed 17 of 28 passes for 159 yards and one touchdown. He missed on some key throws and also threw the ball at times when he should have run, as Sanders said after the loss. Salter added 13 carries for 43 yards and a touchdown.\n\nWhy is Julian Lewis playing for Colorado this week?\n\nThe fact that Lewis is playing this week isn\u2019t an indictment on Salter. Sanders said he had planned to play Lewis at times this season. He said he just didn\u2019t think it was appropriate timing last week.\n\n\u201cNow he's going to play, so I don't even care about the flow with nothing,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHe's playing.\u201d\n\nSanders declined to say if Lewis might start against Delaware in a 3:30 p.m. ET game Saturday on Fox.\n\nHe also didn\u2019t seem overly concerned about Salter being able to learn from his mistakes on Saturday. Sanders said he didn\u2019t need to talk to him about using his legs more often to make gains.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t think he knows that?\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure the internet has told him, you know, if I didn\u2019t tell him. I don\u2019t have to babysit. These are some grown men getting handsomely paid. I\u2019m pretty sure they understand what the objective is to win and to exercise their skillset to its best possible usage. He knows what his gifts are. He\u2019s just got to use them.\u201d\n\nLewis is only 17 years old after graduating high school early in Carrollton, Georgia. He originally committed to play at Southern California before switching to Colorado.\n\nDelaware up next for Colorado\n\nBefore the loss to Georgia Tech, Sanders never had lost a season opener as a college head coach. The big question now is how his team responds to it. A loss to the Blue Hens, a team playing in its first season as a Bowl Subdivision member, in Week 2 would be nearly catastrophic. A decisive win could restart the conversation about playing for the Big 12 Conference championship heading into its conference opener Sept. 12 at Houston.\n\n\u201cWe know that one game doesn\u2019t define us and that if we want to make the playoff, we\u2019ve got to win out,\u201d Mata said Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the plan. It\u2019s Plan A. And it hasn\u2019t changed.\u201d\n\nColorado receiver Omarion Miller has a hamstring injury and might not play. Running back Dallan Hayden also might not play because of injury. But Sanders said both positions have enough depth to be successful.",

      "text": "Why Deion Sanders is still 'optimistic on everything' after Colorado loss to Georgia Tech\n- Colorado quarterback Kaidon Salter showed promise but missed opportunities to run, according to Deion Sanders.\n- The Buffaloes' defense struggled, giving up nearly 500 yards and failing to capitalize on early turnovers.\n- Sanders remains optimistic despite the loss and looks forward to improvements in the next game against Delaware.\nBOULDER, CO \u2013 Colorado football coach Deion Sanders admitted he had tears in his eyes before Friday night\u2019s season-opening game against Georgia Tech.\nIn previous years, he would take a pregame walk on the field with one or two of his sons: quarterback Shedeur and safety Shilo.\nBut both are gone now, having moved on to other pursuits. So he found it touching when another player, receiver Isaiah Hardge, came up to him before kickoff and said \"let's take the walk\" in their place.\n\"That was a wonderful moment, man,\" Sanders said after his team lost the game, 27-20. \"It\u2019s a moment that I will never forget, never, because it was not like I initiated it.\n\u201cHe came to me and said, 'Let\u2019s go.' That\u2019s what this college football thing is about. It\u2019s about love. It\u2019s about peace, forgiveness, trials, tribulations. It\u2019s a tremendous journey that we just want these kids to develop into men. Hopefully what transpired tonight will bring us closer together as a team, as well as challenge us to go to the next level and fix what was broken.\u201d\nDeion Sanders has a lot to fix\n\u220e Colorado gave up a 45-yard touchdown run from Georgia Tech quarterback Haynes King with 1:07 remaining, a score that broke a 20-20 tie by exposing the Buffaloes' new-look defense.\n\u220e The Buffs gave up 463 total yards, including 320 rushing yards, in front of a sold-out crowd of 52,868 at Folsom Field.\n\u220e Their new quarterback, Kaidon Salter, also threw the ball at times when he should have run, Sanders said. He finished with 43 rushing yards on 13 carries.\nAt the same time, this was Sanders\u2019 first game back since having his cancerous bladder removed in May.\nHe said he \u201cfelt darn good during the game\u201d and still liked what he saw from his team.\n\u201cI\u2019m optimistic on everything,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to be fine. I\u2019m not concerned about that. We could have won that game. It\u2019s not like we got our butts kicked.\u201d\nWhat did Deion Sanders say about his new QB?\nHe said Salter was a \u201clittle nervous\u201d but did well, except for one main thing. Sanders wanted Salter to be the \u201cdual threat\u201d QB Salter was at Liberty, with the ability to burn opponents with his legs and arm.\n\u201cCouple times he could have ran, and he decided to throw,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIt was like, dawg, you\u2019re a dual threat, you know what that mean? Like, use your legs. But man, he\u2019s a great kid and he played his butt off. I\u2019m proud of him in a lot of aspects.\u201d\nSalter completed 17 of 28 passes for 159 yards and one touchdown, which came on the game\u2019s first possession \u2013 an 8-yard throw to receiver DeKalon Taylor. His best drive came in the fourth quarter, when he capped a 75-yard possession with a 7-yard touchdown run to help tie the game at 20-20 with 8:25 left.\nSalter was the only quarterback who played for CU. Freshman recruit Julian \u201cJuJu\u201d Lewis did not, even though Sanders previously said Lewis would play occasionally depending on game situations.\nSalter agreed with Sanders afterward.\n\u201cMost definitely, I feel like I could have used my legs better,\u201d he said.\nWhat happened on Colorado's final drive?\nAfter King helped put Georgia Tech ahead, 27-20, Salter took over with 1:07 remaining at his own 25-yard line. Colorado had two timeouts left but never used them.\nWhy not?\n\u201cI think we got out of bounds a couple of times so we didn\u2019t have to take \u2018em,\u201d Sanders said.\nHe also said, \u201cWe were just really trying to preserve them till we certainly needed them.\"\nInstead of preserving precious seconds by using those timeouts, Colorado wasted chunks of that final minute by running around and letting the clock tick down. The Buffs ran five plays to get to the 50-yard line \u2212 three complete passes, a 5-yard run from Salter on third-and-1 and a deep throw that didn't connect.\nWith three seconds left, Salter then tried a final Hail Mary pass from the 50, which fell incomplete in the end zone as time expired.\nWhat happened with the Colorado defense?\nThe Buffs missed Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter, who played cornerback and receiver before moving on to the NFL. In his place, cornerback DJ McKinney intercepted a pass from King in the first quarter, but the Buffs couldn\u2019t convert it into points.\nThe defense actually came up with three straight turnovers to start the game, including two fumbles. The problem for the Buffs was that they netted only one touchdown from all of that\u2013 Salter\u2019s touchdown pass on his first possession. It gave Colorado its only lead of the game at 7-0, less than three minutes after kickoff.\nAfter that, the Georgia Tech offense just kept gashing the Buffs with motion, counter plays and guard pulls. By halftime, the Yellow Jackets led 13-10 and had 18 first downs, compared to five for CU.\n\"Maybe it messed with our eyes a little bit,\" Colorado linebacker Reggie Hughes said of Georgia Tech's offense.\nSanders joked that his team turned King into a Heisman Trophy candidate. King scored all three of Georgia Tech\u2019s touchdowns on runs of 4, 17 and 45 yards. He finished with 156 yards on 19 carries. He also threw for 143 yards on 13-of-20 passing.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to applaud the defense when we gave up darn near 500 yards,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat\u2019s kind of tough.\u201d\nHis team now faces Delaware at home Sept. 6.\n\u201cWe will do better next week,\u201d Sanders said.\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

      "text": "Top quarterback recruit Julian Lewis commits to Colorado\nDeion Sanders just caught another whale.\nJulian \u201cJuJu\u201d Lewis, one of the nation\u2019s top quarterback recruits, announced Thursday that he will play for Coach Sanders and his Colorado football team, making him the likely successor to Sanders\u2019 quarterback son, Shedeur, in 2025.\nLewis, who plays for Carrollton High School in Georgia, previously committed to play at Southern California but continued to take recruiting visits to other campuses, including Colorado, Georgia and Indiana. He recently reneged on his commitment to USC and picked the Buffaloes before the start of the early signing period for recruits on Dec. 4.\nLewis made the announcement on the Pat McAfee Show.\n\"Of course, it was big for me just coming in after Shedeur, just seeing what he\u2019s done to Colorado and what he\u2019s turned it into,\" Lewis said on the show. \"It\u2019s definitely a blessing getting put into this position coming after him and his dad. I couldn\u2019t beat it.\"\nLewis ranks as the nation\u2019s No. 6 quarterback recruit, according to 247Sports' composite rankings for 2025. He also ranks as the No. 2 pocket-passer recruit, according to ESPN, behind Bryce Underwood, who committed to LSU before switching to Michigan Thursday. The university community in Boulder embraced Lewis during his visits to the school, practically begging him to play for the Buffaloes. The Sink restaurant on university hill near campus even crafted a burger in his honor \u2013 a double cheeseburger with shredded lettuce, red onion, bacon and A-1 aioli.\nHow Julian Lewis fits into Deion Sanders' plans\nHis decision answers a big question for the Buffs in 2025: Who will be their starting quarterback after Shedeur?\nShedeur Sanders is expected to be a top draft pick in the NFL next year after exhausting his college eligibility this season. His backup, Ryan Staub, started one game in Shedeur\u2019s absence in 2023 \u2013 a 23-17 loss at Utah and attempted only three passes in the first 10 games of the season in 2024.\nIf the Buffs hadn't landed Lewis, they likely would have shopped for a quarterback in the transfer portal.\nLewis said on the show he will enroll at Colorado in January.\n\"Coach Prime\u2019s always said the best man\u2019s gonna play,\" Lewis said of Deion Sanders. \"And that\u2019s really what I wanted, was to be able to come in and compete and start as a freshman. I wouldn\u2019t have much fun sitting on the bench.\"\nLewis becomes the latest big fish reeled in by Sanders, who previously brought in the nation\u2019s top offensive line recruit (Jordan Seaton), top cornerback (Cormani McClain) and No. 1 overall recruit from 2022 (Travis Hunter). McClain has since left the program, while Seaton and Hunter have been keys to CU\u2019s success this year in its quest for the College Football Playoff.\nDeion Sanders was asked about the big news Thursday on his weekly Colorado Football Coaches Show. He said he \"can't wait to be a part of his life.\" He also was asked about how he gets involved with communicating with recruits and their families.\nAs an example, he said, \u201cHey, get JuJu on the phone and get his pop on the phone. See if his dad want to come down and just sit down and chop it up with me.\"\n\"He sat in my office I think a few weeks ago for a couple hours,\" Deion Sanders said on the show about the father. \"I said, `C,mon, give it all to me because I know you\u2019ve got a bunch of questions on your mind. Let\u2019s go.' And we did that. And he walked away feeling really comfortable about where we\u2019re headed.\"\nThe Buffs (8-2) play Kansas (4-6) Saturday at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City.\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

      "text": "Why Deion Sanders has portable toilet on sideline at Colorado\nColorado football coach Deion Sanders has been trying to remove the stigma associated with incontinence and bladder issues after having his cancerous bladder removed in May.\nHe even has discussed the need for a portable toilet on the sideline during games this season.\nOn Friday, Aug. 29, it became clear he wasn\u2019t joking. A Colorado official confirmed that the black tented box near the 20-yard line is Sanders\u2019 bathroom if he needs to use it during Friday night\u2019s season-opening game against Georgia Tech at Folsom Field.\nIt is sponsored by Depend, the adult underwear brand with whom Sanders has a partnership.\n\"I know I got halftime, but can I make it through a game?\u201d Sanders said to former NFL receiver Michael Irvin in an interview in July. \u201cWhat if there\u2019s a long quarter?

      "text": "Alabama's flop leads college football Week 1 winners and losers\n- Alabama lost to Florida State 31-17 in their season opener, their first opening-game loss since 2001.\n- Tulane emerged as a potential Group of Five playoff contender after defeating Northwestern.\n- Tennessee showcased a strong offense in their win against Syracuse.\nFifteen years of unparalleled dominance gone and erased \u2013 poof! \u2013 in the span of a season and one game.\nNick Saban isn\u2019t walking through that door. Heck, AJ McCarron isn\u2019t, either. There is no rationale reason for optimism.\nAfter losing to Vanderbilt and Oklahoma in coach Kalen DeBoer\u2019s debut, the No. 8 Crimson Tide opened 2025 with an embarrassing 31-17 loss at unranked Florida State, which ended last season at or near the very bottom of the Power Four. The loss was Alabama\u2019s first in a season opener since 2001.\nThere is nothing Alabama does particularly well and some obvious flaws, including the play of an offense that averaged just 4.6 yards per play. From drops to missed blocks to missed assignments, Alabama\u2019s offense managed to combine poor preparation with poor execution. Defensively, the Tide allowed 6.1 yards per play and 10.9 yards per pass attempt.\nThis is what Alabama resembles a game into DeBoer\u2019s second year: an average program farther away from the national championship than at any single point during the Saban era.\nAnd given what\u2019s unfolded since a win against Georgia last September, it\u2019s become incredibly hard to see how DeBoer\u2019s tenure gets back on track.\nThat makes the Tide the biggest losers of the first Saturday of the 2025 season. Coming in second is No. 1 Texas, which lost 14-7 at No. 2 Ohio State in one of the most hyped season openers in recent history:\nWinners\nOhio State\nThe win against Texas will reinsert the defending national champions atop the US LBM Coaches Poll as the Longhorns tumble down the rankings. But that\u2019s just the beginning. It\u2019s difficult to overstate the long-term impact the result of Saturday\u2019s season opener will have on both teams along with the Big Ten and SEC, especially in how the selection committee eventually assesses the Buckeyes, Longhorns and these two conferences.\nPlaying with a reworked roster and coaching staff, the Buckeyes squeezed just enough from an unimposing offense to score the type of victory that will linger deep into the regular season and beyond. While games against Penn State and Michigan will determine the Big Ten, the odds of Ohio State making the playoff in some capacity have increased dramatically.\nThere\u2019s plenty of improvement needed on the offensive end after the Buckeyes gained just 203 yards on 3.8 yards per play, including only 2.3 yards per carry. Before Saturday, the Buckeyes\u2019 fewest yards in a regular-season game since 2016 was 252 yards in last year\u2019s loss to Michigan. By default, Julian Sayin outplayed Manning by avoiding turnovers and focusing his attention on star wide receiver Jeremiah Smith, who had a game-high six receptions.\nBut this was to be expected: OSU was overhauling things on offense behind new personnel and a new offensive coordinator. That there are similar changes underway on defense speaks to the ability of that unit to keep the Buckeyes at or near the top of the FBS while the offense rounds into form. The defending national champions passed a high-profile test to open the year and should only get better from here.\nLSU\nNo. 9 LSU forced Cade Klubnik into a late incompletion on fourth down and with No. 4 Clemson in the red zone to win 17-10 in the other Death Valley and reclaim a huge chunk of the momentum lost during a disappointing 2024 season. Beyond flipping the script given the program\u2019s winless mark in season openers under Brian Kelly, this one puts LSU back on the map as a legitimate contender for the SEC crown and national championship. The defense stepped up: Clemson managed just 261 yards of offense and only 1.6 yards per carry. While that performance will reignite criticism of Clemson\u2019s offense, the story coming out of Saturday is about the growth seen from LSU after multiple years in a row of dismal defensive numbers.\nFlorida State\nWe won\u2019t know for a bit whether beating Alabama actually means anything when it comes to the Seminoles\u2019 chances of a worst-to-first climb in the ACC. But from a symbolic perspective, it\u2019s hard to top the deep meaning behind a win against the Crimson Tide. At a minimum, the victory speaks to the way Mike Norvell remade the program in the offseason, especially in hiring new coordinators Gus Malzahn and Tony White. Another big addition was former Boston College quarterback Thomas Castellanos who was dead-on accurate when he said in June that Alabama didn\u2019t \u201chave Nick Saban to save them\u201d anymore.\nTulane\nTulane is the current favorite for the Group of Five\u2019s bid to the playoff after Boise State\u2019s stunning loss at South Florida on Friday night and the Green Wave\u2019s 23-3 win against Northwestern. Brigham Young quarterback transfer Jake Retzlaff threw for 152 yards and ran for a game-high 113 yards with two touchdowns. The Wildcats are one of three Power Four teams in non-conference play for Tulane, joining Duke and No. 15 Mississippi. Splitting games against the Blue Devils and Rebels while losing just once in American play should leave Tulane atop the Group of Five in December.\nTennessee\nThe No. 18 Volunteers suffered no post-Nico Iamaleava hangover by beating Syracuse 45-26 in Atlanta behind 281 yards of total offense and three scores from new starting quarterback Joey Aguilar. The Appalachian State and UCLA transfer paced a balanced offense that threw for 247 yards and ran for 246 yards and two touchdowns on 6.2 yards per carry. Based on Saturday, the Volunteers have to be taken seriously as an SEC contender.\nJohn Mateer\nOklahoma\u2019s new quarterback looked the part of an impact transfer by completing 30 of 37 throws for 392 yards with four touchdowns as the Sooners beat Illinois State 35-3. The 392 yards set a new program record for a debut. While beating the Redbirds tells us nothing about the Sooners\u2019 chances in the SEC or against Michigan next week, it\u2019s clear that grabbing Mateer and coordinator Ben Arbuckle away from Washington State is going to have a hugely positive impact on this offense.\nLosers\nTexas\nThe Longhorns will spend the rest of the regular season trying to make up ground against a schedule that includes No. 4 Georgia, No. 17 Florida, No. 21 Texas A&M and Oklahoma. While we only have one year of data at our disposal, Texas could conceivably lose twice in the SEC and still be in position for an at-large playoff bid. But the issues run deeper for the Longhorns, and include early questions about Manning, the overall state of the offense and whether there is enough experienced talent to play with and beat the best teams in the FBS. Bellyflopping into the regular season after months of acclaim as the SEC favorite, Texas never resembled the team many expected to go wire to wire atop the Coaches Poll.\nArch Manning\nNo player reflects this disappointment more than Manning, who went 17 of 30 for 170 yards, averaging an anemic 5.7 yards per throw, with a touchdown and an interception to go with another 38 rushing yards. (There might not have been more commercials featuring Manning during the Fox broadcast than completions against the OSU defense from Manning, but it was close.) His struggles were underscored by the fact 98 of his passing yards came in the final five minutes after Texas trailed by 14. This is essentially a nightmare scenario for the youngest member of the quarterback dynasty: Texas lost while Manning was very unimpressive, and the talking-head coverage of the Longhorns and their quarterback this week will be absolutely brutal.\nKalen DeBoer\nHe\u2019ll shoulder the blame for Alabama\u2019s latest failure, as he should. The next few months will determine whether DeBoer returns in 2026, though you\u2019d have to think he\u2019d get at least one more year unless the Tide completely disintegrate in SEC play. More than a result of evaluation, development or game-day preparation, DeBoer\u2019s current predicament can be linked to a fateful choice: to replace the greatest coach in program history and inherit Saban-era expectations. It\u2019s always better to replace the guy who replaces the guy, you know.\nCade Klubnik\nClemson\u2019s road to the playoff still goes through teams such as Miami, SMU and the rest of the ACC\u2019s upper crust. In the end, the LSU loss does much more to Clemson\u2019s reputation and level of national respect than to the Tigers\u2019 overall playoff odds. (That respect level just took a big hit, by the way.) There\u2019s going to be a more concrete impact on Klubnik, who began the year as one of the co-leaders for the Heisman Trophy but will have a hard time moving past a mediocre game in the loss. The senior hit on 19 of 38 throws for 230 yards and an interception.\nKansas State\nAfter dropping the Week 0 opener to No. 21 Iowa State in Dublin, No. 20 Kansas State struggled to put away North Dakota of the Championship Subdivision before scoring with 42 seconds left to win 38-35. This one featured a better game from quarterback Avery Johnson, who had 318 passing yards and three scores, but narrowly getting past an FCS opponent doesn\u2019t help rebuild the Wildcats\u2019 diminishing credibility with Big 12 play around the corner."

      "text": "Carson Beck leads Miami past Notre Dame in redemption effort after messy Georgia exit\nMIAMI GARDENS, FL \u2014 He\u2019ll never say it because no matter the explanation, there are no winners in a blame game.\nOnly a loser who complains.\nSo I\u2019ll do it for Carson Beck: the problem at Georgia last season wasn\u2019t Beck. He\u2019s going to spend the next four months at Miami proving it.\n\"It's not about me, it's about this team,\" Beck said after a thrilling 27-24 victory over Notre Dame, Miami's first Top 10 win since 2017.\nAnd that's about as much complaining as you'll get from Beck.\nBut paint it any way you want, reality bleeds through. Georgia dropped 36 passes last season with Beck as quarterback. Thirty-six.\nMiami didn\u2019t drop a single ball in Beck\u2019s first game with the Hurricanes.\nI\u2019ll give you three guesses who looked like an All-America quarterback Sunday night in suburban Miami. And the first two don\u2019t count.\nBeck\u2019s redemption season kicked off here with a big game, and a bigger performance. With a late, game-winning drive, and a statement made.\nEven if ever-conservative Miami coach Mario Cristobal nearly swallowed the game whole.\nBut understand this: if Beck plays like this the remainder of the season \u2013 and if Cristobal let\u2019s go of the reins \u2013 Beck and the Hurricanes will give the storied program a breakthrough season for the first time in two decades.\nThe same thing he felt when he first walked into the Greentree football facility in Coral Gables in January, and sat down with offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson and transfer wideout CJ Daniels.\nHe was a few weeks removed from season-ending elbow surgery that forced him to miss the second half of the SEC championship game, and Georgia's College Football Playoff quarterfinal loss to Notre Dame.\nThe same two games that ignited the social media-fueled lunacy among Georgia fans, who fell in love with try-hard backup Gunner Stockton and blamed Beck for the program's postseason slippage.\nAs he sat there with Dawson and Daniels and talked ball, he knew something was different. It all played out months later against Notre Dame and one of the nation's best defenses.\n\"I tried to tell everyone that it was different here,\" Beck said. \"But actions speak louder than words.\"\nAfter the last-minute win over Notre Dame \u2013 where both the offense and defense closed out a critical win \u2013 those actions underscored another reality bleeding through. This team will go as far as Beck takes it.\nNo matter what Georgia fans think.\nWhile those same fans were dogpiling Beck and extolling the virtues of Stockton, Georgia coach Kirby Smart was the first to call Beck \u2013 and wanted him back in Athens \u2013 when he realized Beck was returning to college football in 2025. The best coach in the game wanted Beck back in Athens, unreasonable fans wanted him gone.\nYou do the math.\nAll it took was one game at Miami to show what Smart knew all along, and what Beck has been eager to prove since his Georgia career ended on the turf in the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, on the last play of the first half of the SEC championship game.\nThrows are easier when receivers aren\u2019t constantly dropping passes. The offense flows, it\u2019s structurally operational, and it\u2019s balanced.\nIf you\u2019re dropping passes, you\u2019re not setting up throws with the run game. If you\u2019re dropping passes, you\u2019re guessing when calling plays, unsure of what pays to call \u2014 much less setting up one play with another.\nThere\u2019s is no plan or propose when you can\u2019t consistently catch the ball. But when you can, when the quarterback can confidently step Ito throws, you get what played out against Notre Dame.\nSmart throws, key throws, game-changing throws. Like Beck extending a play and throwing a touchdown pass to Malachi Toney in the first quarter. Or the final drive of the game, after Miami\u2019s four previous possessions were all three-and-outs (with one ending in a field goal).\nBefore Cristobal got conservative and settled for a field goal, Beck hit Daniels with a 9-yard curl, and threw a perfect deep ball to Keelan Marlon \u2014 one where Irish cornerback Christian Gray had no alternative but to interfere with what looked like a certain touchdown pass.\nMiami eventually got the game-winning points, but the statement had been made over and over during Beck\u2019s first game with his new team. He wasn\u2019t the problem last year at Georgia.\n\"He's our general,\" said Miami running back Marty Brown. \"He's our leader in practice, and our leader in games. We follow him.\"\nThat's not to say Georgia didn't, but there were more levels to the regression in 2024. To be fair to the Georgia receivers, the pass game is a three-pronged attacked. It\u2019s protection, it\u2019s receivers getting open and catching the ball, and the quarterback throwing on time and with anticipation.\nIf any of those three doesn\u2019t happen, opportunity for success is significantly decreased. When two of the three have problems, it\u2019s near impossible to have a functional pass game.\nThe Georgia offensive line had problems all season. It couldn\u2019t stay healthy, guys were playing out of position and and some were underachieving. Now add those 36 drops to the equation.\nBeck struggled last season, his interceptions doubled (to 12), his completion percentage dropped eight points (to 64 percent) and his yards per attempt fell to a mundane 7.8 (from 9.5), because the pass game process was a mess.\nBy midseason, when it was clear Beck didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t trust his receivers, he started pressing. Started trying to make perfect throws to circumvent the two stragglers in the three-pronged pass game attack.\nNot because Beck regressed, or because ehe got a big head with a reported $3 million NIL deal. Or because he drove around a Lamborghini.\nAll nonsense, but all fan angst fuel for Georgia missing the CFP in 2023, and losing in the quarterfinals in 2024.\nFast forward to Sunday night: so many easy throws, so many usable pass concepts.\nHe threw for 205 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions \u2015 against a defense that, by the end of the season, may be the best in college football. Seven different receivers caught passes, and the pass game was an operational symphony.\nHours before the game, on the hourlong bus ride to Hard Rock Stadium, Beck said it felt like the big games he played in at Georgia. Months of thinking it was just another game in a different uniform quickly changed.\nUntil he got to the stadium, put on the jersey and started pre-game preparation.\n\"I got out there and felt surprisingly comfortable,\" Beck said. \"I'm not in this alone. I have teammates around me that makes plays. I just have to get them the ball.\"\nNow that's nothing to complain about.\nMatt Hayes is the senior national college football writer for USA TODAY Sports Network. Follow him on X at @MattHayesCFB."

      "text": "Best and worst of college football Week 1: Florida State QB trash talk, overhyped teams\n- Florida State quarterback Thomas Castellanos backed up his preseason trash talk, leading the Seminoles to an upset victory over Alabama.\n- Lee Corso correctly predicted the outcomes of three marquee games in his final appearance on \"College GameDay.\"\n- Preseason hype proved to be misleading, as highly touted teams like Alabama and Texas struggled in Week 1.\nEveryone knows talking trash can get you in some hot water. Not only does it cause a stir, but failing to back it up could lead to plenty of criticism.\nBut turning that trash talk from a prediction to a spoiler? That's some legendary stuff.\nIt only took one game for Thomas Castellanos to cement himself in Florida State lore. He couldn't be stopped by Alabama in the 31-17 upset the Seminoles quarterback said would happen two months ago.\nThere was a collective groan when Castellanos declared Alabama didn't \"have Nick Saban to save them\" and \"I just don\u2019t see them stopping me.\u201d It was bulletin board material for the Crimson Tide. Even more, Castellanos doubled-down on his words. You wouldn't blame anyone for expecting a blowout Alabama win and Castellanos to become the meme of the season.\nInstead, Castellanos proved Alabama needed Saban to stop him from running for a game-high 78 yards and a touchdown along with 152 yards in the air on just 14 attempts, leading a physical domination over a supposed College Football Playoff contender.\nIt took guts for Castellanos to back up his trash talk, and he leads the best and worst things we saw in Week 1 of the 2025 season.\nBest: Lee Corso goes out with a bang\nCollege football fans rejoiced their beloved game was back, but they also poured love to the retirement of Lee Corso after 38 memorable years on \"College GameDay.\" There's no debating his contributions to the sport, and while he has given us several iconic moments, it was clear Corso was reaching the end of his remarkable career.\nBut he left proving he still got it.\nIn his signature segment, Corso correctly picked Ohio State for his final headgear selection, his national championship pick LSU to beat Clemson and even better, was the only person to say his alma mater Florida State would upset Alabama. In the three marquee games, Corso goes 3-0.\nIt's not often greats end their careers with such a high note, but in his final act, Corso reminded everyone he knows ball.\nWorst: Preseason hype\nIt's practically a guarantee a team with preseason hype will get smacked by reality in Week 1. It's just a matter of who.\nIn 2025, that belongs to Arch Manning and Alabama. The Heisman Trophy favorite, Manning struggled against Ohio State with just 38 passing yards through three quarters. He finished with 170 yards in the air but it wasn't a performance that looked like the next great college quarterback.\nMeanwhile, Alabama was believed to be ready to return to the title picture after an up-and-down first year with Kalen DeBoer. Instead, the Crimson Tide didn't look anything close to a contender, beaten by Florida State team coming off a two-win season. Now, people in Tuscaloosa are already wondering if Saban's successor was a mistake.\nReality hits you fast.\nBest: Tulane makes New Orleans proud\nTulane wanted to recognize the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina by wearing blank green helmets and white jerseys in its home opener, what the team wore in its first game after the devastating hurricane. However, they weren't able to because Northwestern declined the decision as the road team.\nWhat was supposed to be a nice tribute to their city was denied. The Green Wave responded by dismantling the Wildcats, 23-3, and coach Jon Sumrall made sure everyone knew it fueled the dominant win.\n\"When you disrespect the city of New Orleans, that's what's going to happen to you. You're going to run into a team like this that had a chip on their shoulder,\" he said. \"We might've used that for a little motivation to represent the city.\"\n\"Don't disrespect the City of New Orleans, ever.\"\nWorst: Poorly planned 'neutral' games\nNeutral site games to start the season are pretty good ideas. They provide excitement for teams and fans to travel to fun cities and stadiums while increasing national exposure.\nUnless it's pretty much a road game.\nCincinnati and Syracuse signed themselves up for complete hostility; the Bearcats had to deal with Nebraska fans taking over Arrowhead Stadium \u2212 even though it was a \"home\" game \u2212 and the Orange were taken over by Tennessee orange in Atlanta.\nEssentially playing true road games, Cincinnati and Syracuse came up short and will probably rethink their future non-conference scheduling strategy.\nWorst: The Oregon Duck loses his head\nEven the greats have to shake off the offseason rust.\nThe Oregon Duck is one of the best mascots in sports, but his 2025 debut was rocky. Its head fell off as it made its way onto the field, resulting in a full sprint back to the locker room to protect the identity. A really tough moment from the person in the costume.\nIt could've been a bad omen, but luckily, the football team wasn't affected with a 59-13 win over Montana State.\nBest: Kent State snaps losing streak\nThe nation's longest losing streak is no more as Kent State snapped its run of 21 consecutive defeats with a win against Merrimack.\nIt's easy to forget how miserable the Golden Flashes have been. The last time they won a game was Sept. 16, 2023. That's 714 days of waiting. Since Kent State's last victory, Oregon has won a nation-high 23 games.\nThe cobwebs of the victory bell finally got to be shaken off. Enjoy it Kent State.\nSure it was a win over an Championship Subdivision team, but not every FBS team can say they won their game against one.\nWorst: Losing to FCS teams\nCase in point.\nArmy and Middle Tennessee State, congratulations on paying for a loss. The Black Knights were the first FBS team in 2025 to lose to an FCS team in Tarleton State. A missed field goal stopped them from winning in regulation, and another failed kick doomed them in overtime for a 30-27 loss. Army paid the Texans $250,000 for the game, and it doesn't look like a great use of government funds.\nMiddle Tennessee suffered a worse fate. Austin Peay jumped out to a 21-0 lead over the Blue Raiders and won 34-14 for its first win over an FBS team since 1987. It hasn't been revealed how much Middle Tennessee paid, but getting completing outplayed already cost too much.\nAt least Kansas State avoided being on this list, barely getting past North Dakota in a game it paid $475,000 for."

      "text": "Colorado freshman QB has business plan for success under Deion Sanders\nColorado freshman quarterback Julian \"JuJu\" Lewis doesn\u2019t turn 18 years old until September and still needs to add more beef to a body that weighs less than 200 pounds. But he\u2019s already in the middle of the biggest storyline of the season for his new head coach, Deion Sanders.\nAs a top recruit out of Carrollton, Georgia, Lewis also has a business agent, his own branded line of merchandise and an ownership stake in a company that aims to democratize name, image and likeness deals for college players (NIL).\nIn many ways, this makes him the poster child of this wild new era of college sports. His father even makes sure he knows his roles.\n\u201cHe\u2019s always reminding me that I have two jobs: QB and entrepreneur,\u201d Lewis said.\nLewis agreed to discuss these dual ambitions in an email interview with USA TODAY Sports. Both roles are being boosted by a company that he partly owns called Fanstake, where fans can pay to lure recruits to their favorite college teams by contributing to their NIL deals.\nBy the end of June, Lewis said he plans to announce at least three other equity deals besides Fanstake and will have four other active NIL deals before the season. Beyond that, Lewis hopes to win the battle to replace Shedeur Sanders as CU's next starting quarterback and then use Fanstake as a tool to lure top recruits to Colorado.\nThe goal is to seize all of these opportunities in Boulder, where the spotlight will include at least four CU games on ESPN or Fox in the first month of the season, but with no guarantee that Lewis will play in any of them.\nLewis part of battle to replace Shedeur Sanders\nAfter Lewis signed with Colorado Dec. 4, Liberty transfer quarterback Kaidon Salter committed to CU two weeks later with one season of college eligibility remaining.\nDid Lewis know when he committed to CU that the Buffaloes would bring in another QB for 2025?\nMight he split time with Salter this season or consider redshirting?\nThe interview was edited for clarity and length and was arranged through the company.\n\u220e USA TODAY Sports: Before you committed and signed with CU late last year, did you know CU might later bring in a transfer QB?\n\u201cCoach Prime runs this like an NFL team,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cPlus every program in college football is always going to try and get better and have depth at every position. You can\u2019t even prepare for the season without enough QBs on the roster.\u201d\n\u220e What did CU say about maybe bringing in another QB before you signed with CU?\n\u201cCU is about development and competition,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThe only thing I was looking for as a recruit was to be coached by great coaches and have an opportunity to compete as a freshman. I\u2019ve been competing for QB jobs since I was 7. I joined a team at 10 that already had a QB, I competed every day against the guy who was there, and we ended up winning the Battle Youth National Championship that season and I threw 70 touchdown passes.\u201d\nLewis also provided a reminder that he competed for the starting job in high school, too, where he played for the Carrollton Trojans in Georgia.\n\u201cCarrollton had kids who grew up wanting to be Trojans and I moved there,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t recruited by (coach) Joey King or asked to come. I made a decision to go and compete at the end of 7th grade. Then, going into 9th grade, I had to compete again for the varsity job. I\u2019m not the kid who was ever handed jobs. My story is different. People just see the results and assume I\u2019ve had some easy path. Other guys\u2019 dads coached teams, and they were automatically the QB (when Lewis was younger). My dad took me to the hardest coaches and toughest programs, and I always had to earn it. Anything different and this wouldn\u2019t be my story.\u201d\n\u220e Do you see CU picking one QB to go with in the fall season or maybe playing at least two on a situational basis because you have different styles?\n\u201cCoach Prime and Coach (Pat) Shurmur are going to put me in the best position to develop and our team in the best position to win. I have total faith in that. And I\u2019ve got a lot of work to do in a little bit of time, so I\u2019m ready when my coaches say I\u2019m ready.\u201d\n\u220e Do you plan to add a certain amount of weight as some new players do out of high school?\n\u201cI\u2019ve gained 15lbs since January,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cI\u2019ll probably put on whatever I can add before we get into pads and that will be what it is for this season.\u201d\nLewis is now up to 198 pounds on his 6-foot-1 frame. He normally would be headed into his senior season of high school in 2025, but he reclassified to start college a year earlier.\n\u220e How is your NIL business going and how important is that to your college career?\n\"I\u2019m blessed to be a part of this era in college and high school sports,\" Lewis replied. \"There are thousands of great athletes who came before us who didn\u2019t have the opportunities today. NIL has nothing to do with my college career; football and NIL are two very separate things. Football is my priority. I have a responsibility to myself, my teammates, and my university to become the best player that I can be. NIL is going well, I\u2019m thankful for the opportunities that I have. My dad and my team have done a really good job creating opportunities for me.\"\nHow Lewis plans to use company to boost CU roster\n\u220e How did you get involved with Fanstake and what appealed to you about it?\n\"When I heard about Fanstake, I was immediately interested because it allows players to help each other and their potential programs. At the end of the day we all want to win, and that\u2019s not possible without great teammates around you. The thought of fans being able to support their team and future players during the recruiting process is what made it a 'no brainer' for me.\"\nLewis also said he looks forward to \u201cusing them next portal season to bring in players to join us at CU.\u201d\nOne way he could do this is by encouraging CU fans to contribute money toward luring a player on Fanstake. The company started in November and already has more than 20,000 users, according to Greg Glass, the company\u2019s co-founder.\nOne example shows how Fanstake works. Five-star basketball prospect Nate Ament was wooed by Louisville fans who crowdfunded a combined $88,000 on Fanstake for him if he signed with the Cardinals. He instead decided to sign with Tennessee, whose fans had pledged only about $13,000.\nThe Louisville fans who put money down for Ament got their money returned since Ament signed with a different team. The $13,000 from Tennessee fans instead goes toward Ament\u2019s sponsorship deal with Fanstake.\n\u201cIt helps democratize this landscape a little bit because even if you can\u2019t write a half-million-dollar check, you can get 100,000 fans to write $10 checks, or whatever it might be,\u201d Glass told USA TODAY Sports.\nFanstake partnered with Lewis after he made his decision to commit to the Buffaloes. The deal appealed to him, Glass said, because it was a way to bring in more talent to Boulder.\n\u201cHe wanted to make sure it wasn\u2019t just his NIL, but that he had a squad around him that was going to be secure,\u201d Glass said.\nThe 'last thing' Julian Lewis is worried about\nLewis still made it clear where his NIL endeavors fit into his decision to join the Buffs after previously committing to play at Southern California.\n\u220e Was NIL part of your decision to go to CU?\n\"No it wasn\u2019t,\" Lewis replied. \"It really came down to where I wanted to live and the opportunity to follow Shedeur who everyone knew was leaving for the NFL.\"\n\u220e NIL is part of some players\u2019 decisions to stay at a particular school. Would it be for you going forward? If so, how?\n\"That\u2019s the last thing I\u2019m worried about, right,\" Lewis replied. \"I\u2019m a Buff.\"\n\u220e Because of your youth compared to Kaidon Salter\u2019s experience, some have wondered if you might be a candidate to redshirt this year. Nothing has been decided about that. But would you be open to that if it was ever suggested to you?\n\"I'm going to compete everyday and prepare for my freshman season,\" he stated.\n\u220e What are your plans this summer?\n\"I will be in Boulder for the summer, taking classes and working out.\"\n\u220e By chance do you go back to The Sink in Boulder to have the JuJu burger that the restaurant named after you?\n\"No not yet.\"\n\u220e For those who don\u2019t know, how did you get the nickname \u201cJuJu\u201d?\n\"My older sister started calling me JuJu when I was like 3.\"\nColorado opens the season Aug. 29 against Georgia Tech in a home game on ESPN.\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

      "text": "Bill Belichick's North Carolina debut turns into debacle with blowout loss to TCU\nCHAPEL HILL, NC \u2014 From start to finish, the whole thing was weird.\nWatching Bill Belichick follow North Carolina out of the tunnel for the season opener against TCU was jarring even the better part of a year after his arrival, demanding you finally come to grips with the fact that this is something that\u2019s actually happening: Belichick. College football. North Carolina.\nPart of your brain saw Albert Einstein walking into a new position teaching high school algebra. Another part saw Johnny Unitas as a backup for the San Diego Chargers. Something just did not compute.\nThe reception wasn\u2019t surprising, though. From the sold-out ticket allotment through the community\u2019s frenzied excitement surrounding his debut, the atmosphere inside Kenan Stadium \u2014 flashing lights, choreographed blackouts, even Michael Jordan in a luxury box \u2014 reflected the unrestrained jubilation over the school\u2019s football-forward decision to hire a six-time Super Bowl champion as the coach of this perpetually underachieving program.\nBut good vibes don\u2019t win football games. For Belichick and UNC, the party ended not long after kickoff, in a brutal blowout loss that managed to erase nine months of hope and hype in a single 60-minute package.\nFacing off against an established Power Four winner with a moderate chance of making the College Football Playoff, the Tar Heels scored a touchdown on the opening possession but were quickly overwhelmed by the Horned Frogs, who scored the ensuing 41 points and won 48-14.\nThe 48 points were the most UNC had allowed in a season opener in program history. Not once in his 511-game career as an NFL head coach had a Belichick team allowed that many points.\nOn the heels of a dismal end to his NFL career, Monday night\u2019s matchup gave Belichick a prime opportunity to start rewriting his narrative. Instead, the debut was an unmitigated debacle that triggered something close to sympathy, if not simple concern: Are you sure there isn\u2019t something else you should be doing? Is this really what you want to do? You could\u2019ve just retired, you know?\nBelichick\u2019s broad legacy may be secure; his unparalleled NFL achievements should grow, not diminish, with time. But first impressions matter, even for head coaches with an unmatched collection of Super Bowl hardware.\nHeld against the backdrop of his NFL success and all the attention paid to his arrival, this was one of the worst introductions by a new head coach in Power Four history. Rather than basking in adulation, the GOAT of NFL head coaches spent his Labor Day wearing a blank stare on the sour end of an embarrassment.\n\"They did a lot more things right than we did,\" said Belichick. \"Give them credit, they were the better team.\"\nWhile the Tar Heels should improve, Belichick\u2019s initiation to the Bowl Subdivision will stoke the cynical perception of his alignment with UNC as more of a publicity stunt than the result of a nuanced search for former coach Mack Brown\u2019s successor. Regardless, Belichick is being paid $10 million per season to deliver a winning product, not just sell out a home stadium that began to empty out early in the second half.\n\"There are no shortcuts,\" he said, and then in true Belichick fashion, mumbled that the Tar Heels were \"moving onto Charlotte,\" next week's opponent.\nTCU might be poised for a renaissance three years after making an unexpected run to the national championship game in coach Sonny Dykes\u2019 first season. This is more likely a team that contends for nine wins, hovering around the back end of the US LBM Coaches Poll without making a noticeable dent in the playoff race.\nMonday night doesn\u2019t provide a clearer picture. Even with a lengthy runway to prepare for the opener, UNC allowed the Horned Frogs to resemble the many NFL opponents that took turns humbling Belichick\u2019s teams over his post-Tom Brady tenure with the New England Patriots.\n\"We all felt a little disrespected,\" said TCU coach Sonny Dykes. \"There was a lot of conversation and none of it was about us.\"\nTCU finished with 542 yards, 258 yards coming on the ground and 284 through the air, on 7.5 yards per play. The Horned Frogs ran 72 plays and gained 29 first downs. The offense had six passing plays of at least 15 yards and six carries of at least 10 yards.\nThe Tar Heels managed only 222 yards, with over a third of that total coming on the opening drive. After that initial touchdown, UNC failed to gain another first down until just over three minutes left in the first half.\n\"They were clearly the better team tonight,\" Belichick said.\nLopez, named the starter last week, finished 4 of 10 for 69 yards with two turnovers. The former South Alabama completed just one pass after the first drive and was replaced by backup Max Johnson in the third quarter. Johnson was much better, completing 9 of 11 throws for 103 yards, sparking an early quarterback controversy for Belichick to address before meeting Charlotte in five days time.\nThe play from UNC was chaotic, full of sloppy snaps, sloppy tackling, sloppy angles, sloppy line play and sloppy play-calling that greased the wheels for the Horned Frogs\u2019 blowout. Part of this messiness can be attributed to a massive roster overhaul that brought 70 new players into the program, many after the end of spring drills.\nBut plenty of other first-year coaches in the portal era have conducted similar offseason renovations and hit the ground running \u2014 and Belichick didn\u2019t inherit a proven loser but a program coming off six bowl games in a row. That makes the Tar Heels\u2019 ugly, often undisciplined performance more concerning.\n\"I thought we were prepared for the game,\" said Johnson. \"We\u2019ve been working on our fundamentals this whole last year. But we\u2019ve got to do a better job executing.\"\nThere was a pick-six in the second quarter - a huge momentum swing - to put TCU ahead 17-7. There was the inane decision to punt on fourth down at the TCU 46-yard line with just over a minute left in the first half, which resulted in a botched snap and a 26-yard punt that helped the Horned Frogs drive for a field goal as time expired.\nThere was a backbreaking 75-yard touchdown run on the first play of the second half to push the score to 27-7. There was a 20-yard completion on third-and-20 on the Horned Frogs\u2019 ensuing possession that resulted in a 28-yard touchdown run on the next play.\nUNC took over and promptly turned the ball over again after Lopez was sacked and fumbled, with the loose ball scooped up by senior defensive end Devean Deal and returned 37 yards for yet another score.\nJohnson stemmed the Horned Frogs\u2019 run with a short scoring pass with under a minute to go in third quarter. Tossing garbage-time touchdowns aside, the Tar Heels were outgunned, outmanned, outplayed and outcoached for every meaningful moment outside of the first three minutes of the first quarter.\n\"We\u2019ve got to communicate better with what we\u2019re doing,\" said Johnson. \"We\u2019ve just got to do a better job of going out there and competing every single play, throughout the whole game.\"\nFrom here, the Tar Heels continue through a schedule that includes preseason ACC favorite Clemson in early October but is otherwise manageable, with matchups against California, Virginia, Stanford and Wake Forest seemingly paving the way for six wins and bowl eligibility. But that\u2019s good news and bad: Belichick\u2019s team might be able to take advantage of a flimsy schedule, but the lack of marquee competition will make it harder to overcome the stink of this opener.\nUNC hired him as a shortcut to relevancy, but trending online after losing by 34 points in front of a national audience isn\u2019t what the school had in mind. But that\u2019s where we are one game into this experiment, with Belichick humbled, stands empty, excitement erased and the Tar Heels facing the possibility of a long, long season. There's never been a debut quite like this.\n\"We\u2019ll keep working and grinding away,\" Belichick said. \"We\u2019ve got to correct some of the mistakes we made. We had too many self-inflicted wounds. We\u2019ll start with that.\""

      "text": "Deion Sanders reveals Colorado football's new starting quarterback\nColorado football coach Deion Sanders has named Liberty transfer Kaidon Salter as the team's starting quarterback for the season opener Friday Aug. 29 against Georgia Tech.\nAfter Sanders\u2019 quarterback son Shedeur moved on to the NFL, the question was not just who would replace him at Colorado but how.\nThe obvious choice was Salter, who is a dual threat signal caller and led Liberty to a 13-1 season in 2023. He has one season of college eligibility left.\n\u201cHe\u2019s the guy at this point,\u201d Sanders said at a news conference Tuesday.\nThe other top choice was Julian \u201cJuJu\u201d Lewis, a heralded freshman from Carrollton, Georgia. He\u2019s only 17 years old and has four years of college playing time ahead of him, but there\u2019s also the risk he could transfer out of Colorado if he doesn't see playing time.\nMight both of them share time at the position in the same game?\n\u201cWe're hoping that you see some JuJu periodically through the game as well,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe would like get him some reps as well. But the game predicates that.\u201d\nSanders said Salter\u2019s \u201cexperience is vital.\u201d\nThere was some mystery to the decision before Tuesday. Colorado offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur said Monday that Colorado coaches have discussed the quarterback situation \u201cat great length behind the scenes.\u201d\n\u201cWe'll just let it reveal itself, and if there are any announcements, that's certainly something Coach Prime will handle.\"\nShurmur also praised Salter.\n\u201cHe\u2019s obviously a tremendous athlete that if the situation presents itself, can do some good things with his legs,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019m looking forward to putting him out there to see what he can do.\u201d\nSanders said Tuesday he's known Salter's family for more than 10 years and coached his younger brother Kylan in youth football near Dallas. Kylan Salter is a sophomore linebacker at Colorado. Both are from Cedar Hill, Texas. Kaidon Salter joined Liberty after being dismissed from the team at Tennessee.\n\"I've been checking this kid out since high school,\" Sanders said of Kaidon Salter.\nSanders added that he didn't need to have a big talk with JuJu Lewis to explain the situation.\n\"He knows where we stand,\" Sanders said.\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.
