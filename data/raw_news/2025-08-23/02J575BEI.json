  "title": "Cadillac F1 Secures 2026 Driver Lineup After Sergio Perez Signing - Report",
  "description": "The Cadillac F1 team has reportedly signed the former Red Bull Racing driver, with an announcement expected shortly.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nThe Cadillac F1 team has reportedly signed Sergio Perez for the 2026 season. Formula.hu has confirmed that Cadillac F1 will announce the signing in the week ahead.\n\nNewsweek Sports recently reported that Cadillac F1 had signed Valtteri Bottas. With the team's driver lineup complete, the announcement of the signing will likely be made before the summer break ends next weekend.\n\nThe signing will mark the Mexican driver's return to the premier class of motorsport after he parted ways with Red Bull following the 2024 season. Perez faced a challenging time at the Milton Keynes-based outfit last year, when the team struggled with balance issues on the RB20 F1 car.\n\nRacing for F1's eleventh team will be a new experience for Perez, as the team begins a new racing journey from scratch. The 35-year-old driver's vast F1 experience, since his debut in 2011, will be extremely useful in uplifting Cadillac F1, the sport's second American team.\n\nPerez and his Cadillac F1 teammate, Bottas, who is currently Mercedes' reserve driver, arrive from championship-winning teams. Bottas' storied stint at Mercedes alongside Lewis Hamilton made headlines from 2017 to 2021, as he contributed significantly to the team's eight Constructors' Championships in the hybrid era.\n\nAt Red Bull, Perez proved to be an ideal wingman for four-time world champion Max Verstappen in the current ground effect era that began in 2022. The following year saw Red Bull secure the Constructors' Championship by winning 21 out of the 22 races, with Perez finishing second in the Drivers' Standings behind Verstappen.\n\nCadillac F1 becomes a Ferrari customer team next year, until General Motors fields its own engines in 2029. To adapt to the Scuderia's power units, it was reported that Cadillac F1 will conduct a Testing of Previous Cars (TPC) session in an old Ferrari F1 car with Bottas this year, and there is a near-certain probability that Perez will also be part of it.\n\nPerez revealed in a recent interview that he was seeking an F1 driver role in a team where he could help elevate it to a championship-winning level. When asked if he would be an advantage for a new team like Cadillac F1, he said:\n\n\"Yes, I believe it 100 per cent. If you look at my years with Force India, and then later with Red Bull - pushing the team forward race by race, and eventually becoming a winning team - that's exactly the kind of environment I'm looking for.\n\n\"A team with that mentality, that unity. For me, that's more important than any trophy or achievement: finding a project where the driver feels truly motivated.\"",

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nFormer Red Bull Formula One driver Sergio Perez has set one condition on his potential return to the sport. The clarification arrives amid rumors of his talks with the Alpine F1 team to race this year.\nPerez has been without a confirmed seat for the future after Red Bull parted ways with him at the end of 2024. However, being an experienced driver with nearly 15 years of premier class experience, the Mexican driver is in no hurry to return to the sport.\nSetting a criterion, Perez confirmed that he would return to F1 only if a project appealed to him, making it clear that he will in no way agree to a reserve driver role and wait on the sidelines for a full-time seat. Speaking on Desde El Paddock, he said:\n\"The answer is yes, I do want to return, but only if the right project comes along, one where I feel I truly belong or should be.\n\"I don't want to come back at any cost. I'm not interested in traveling around the world as a third driver or just waiting around for an opportunity.\n\"I feel fortunate for the career I've had, and I do want to come back - because I don't want my career to end like this.\n\"But I'm also fully aware that I'll only return if it's truly worth the price you have to pay to be in Formula 1 - 24 races, and an entire life dedicated to the sport.\"\nPerez qualifies as a fit for the Cadillac F1 team, which is considering having one experienced F1 driver and one young driver for its debut lineup next year, when it enters the grid as the sport's eleventh team. This could be Perez's chance to be a part of history in the making, especially since the project truly resonates with him. When asked if he would be an advantage for a new team like Cadillac, he said:\n\"Yes, I believe it 100 per cent.

For me, that's more important than any trophy or achievement: finding a project where the driver feels truly motivated.\"\nRecent rumors suggest that Alpine was in talks with Perez for a 2025 seat. However, the 35-year-old driver has ruled out an F1 comeback this year. He said:\n\"Things are going well, but I think it's still early in the season.\n\"As time goes on, things will become clearer, and I'll be able to make a final decision.\n\"I'm not in a rush - I know I won't be in F1 this year, so we'll see what happens for next year.\"\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nAbout the writer\nSaajan Jogia is a motorsport and automotive writer with over ten years of experience.

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nThe Cadillac F1 team has reportedly signed its first driver for its debut season in 2026. The second American team on the grid is currently gearing up for its F1 entry, but the drivers were the missing part of the puzzle. Now though, it appears that one driver has been signed.\nRacingNews365 reported that Valtteri Bottas, who was strongly linked to the Cadillac F1 team in recent months, has been appointed by the team, and an official announcement will be made next week. Bottas paused his full-time F1 career after parting ways with Sauber following the 2024 season.\nSince then, he has remained on the sidelines as a Mercedes AMG reserve driver, the team he raced for from 2017 to 2021. Being an F1 veteran, Bottas comes with immense premier class racing experience, having driven for four different teams since his F1 debut in 2013.\nCadillac will use Ferrari power units from 2026, which also marks the year when F1 enters a new era of regulations. The cars will be powered equally by two sources- an internal combustion engine running on sustainable fuel and electric power. The team plans to start using its own power units, developed by General Motors, in 2029.\nBut given its technical partnership with Ferrari, Cadillac will likely run Testing of Previous Cars sessions with both its drivers towards the end of 2025 to make them familiar with Ferrari's power unit.\nSpeaking of Cadillac's second driver, it remains to be seen if the team signs former Red Bull Racing driver Sergio Perez or if it shortlists a young driver. The Mexican driver, who departed Red Bull after the 2024 season, set a condition for his F1 return in the future, suggesting that he would only race if the project appealed to him. Newsweek Sports reported Perez's comments:\n\"I do want to return, but only if the right project comes along, one where I feel I truly belong or should be. I don't want to come back at any cost. I'm not interested in traveling around the world as a third driver or just waiting around for an opportunity.\n\"I feel fortunate for the career I've had, and I do want to come back - because I don't want my career to end like this.

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nFormer Formula One champion Jacques Villeneuve has opened up on the uncertainty surrounding the Cadillac F1 team's driver lineup and its approach to racing in 2026.\nCadillac F1's initial bid, which was led by Andretti Global, was rejected on financial grounds. However, with an increased participation of General Motors and a new management owned and operated by TWG Global, the bid was approved for Cadillac F1 to become the sport's eleventh team in 2026.\nHowever, with just ten rounds remaining for the conclusion of the 2025 season, the American outfit has yet to announce its driver lineup. Cadillac F1 reportedly prefers experienced drivers and is said to have shortlisted Sergio Perez and Valtteri Bottas. But with an announcement yet to be made, the picture seems uncertain.\nCadillac F1 has partnered with Ferrari to procure its power units from 2026 until it fields its own power units in 2029. However, Villeneuve has raised questions, especially with Michael Andretti having moved out of the way, since the team is yet to establish itself. This is unlike Audi, which concluded its takeover of the Sauber F1 team, and the results are already showing in Sauber's performance. Speaking to RacingNews365, he said:\n\"Who knows what's going on there. It's not the same team as a year ago. The whole project has changed, and the way it came in, forcefully, is not the best way either, but at least now they're in, fine.\n\"The question is, what will they do? What drivers will they choose? Who do they put in place?\"\nHighlighting the improvements in Sauber's pace this season, Villeneuve added:\n\"When you look at what Sauber has done, with Audi coming in, [with] Jonathan Wheatley, you already see the results now, even though it's the same car. Just the way the energy, the working... So you can expect great things there.\n\"We don't know with Cadillac yet. They say they want experienced drivers, right? But you want good, experienced drivers...The other thing, we have no idea which engine will be good, that's a big... Well, okay, we'll find out.\"\nThe 1997 F1 champion emphasized that Cadillac F1 will have to sign a big paycheck if it wants to hire a good racing driver. He said:\n\"Depends on how much money they put on the table. Because you want to get one of those drivers [a pure racer], you're a new team, you need to put [down] a big cheque.\n\"But with the value of F1 now, the big cheque is nothing. It's peanuts compared to what it used to be.\"\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nAbout the writer\nSaajan Jogia is a motorsport and automotive writer with over ten years of experience.

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nFormula One's governing body, the FIA, has been working to help underdog engine manufacturers in a big way from 2026, when the sport enters a new era of regulations. This will be possible through a new program called 'additional development opportunities for performance gaps,' which could prove highly beneficial for teams struggling to find performance.\nWith the reset in chassis and engine regulations from 2026, the FIA has been taking significant steps to ensure no single manufacturer dominates the new era of regulations. Mercedes was one such recent engine supplier that dominated the hybrid era that began in 2014, winning eight Constructors' Championships until 2021.\nSpeaking on the topic, FIA single-seater director Nikolas Tombazi told Auto Motor und Sport:\n\"I don't think we'll ever see such a dominant engine manufacturer again as we did in 2014. Back then, the powertrain became much more complex than its predecessor. This time, we're doing the opposite. We're simplifying the technology.\n\"Originally, we wanted to go even further, but we couldn't get it done. The new powertrains are simpler. They no longer have MGU-H, and there are stricter limits in some areas.\n\"On the other hand, we have newcomers among the manufacturers, and of course, there's always the risk that one of them will miss the mark with the first attempt. Despite budget constraints and limited test bench time.\"\nWhen put to him if struggling power unit suppliers would receive support to boost performance, he said:\n\"Yes. We've introduced a program for this that we call 'additional development opportunities for performance gaps.' It was in the rules from the beginning. In recent months, we've refined how we want to manage it.\n\"Essentially, we'll measure the average performance for each manufacturer every six races. For those below a certain level, there will be an upgrade option depending on how far behind.\"\nTombazis explained that the trailing manufacturers can bounce back in three ways. He added:\n\"This can be represented at three different levels: more money for development. More dyno hours. More time for specification homologation. So, those who are behind have a chance to catch up.\"\nHe was asked if the new system was similar to the Balance of Performance in endurance racing. While he denied the similarity, he emphasized that the FIA was making \"final adjustments\" to ensure the same rules apply to all engine suppliers and teams while providing struggling teams a much-needed push to improve their competitiveness. The FIA head said:\n\"That's not the case. The rules remain the same for everyone. No one gets more displacement or more fuel. If there were no budget cap, the lagging manufacturers would invest more money. When Honda entered in 2015 and was lagging behind, they had to invest a lot of money for a certain period of time to catch up. With a cost cap, there's a risk that you'll never be able to catch up. And no one wants to be humiliated forever.\n\"That wouldn't be fair either. We're currently working on the final adjustments to this system. The engine manufacturers have been extremely cooperative.\"\nGiven that the 2026 car will be entirely new, Tombazis revealed a system through which a manufacturer will be able to upgrade their components in case of reliability issues in the early stages.

It's pointless to leave someone out in the cold who has engine failure every weekend.\n\"These engines are expensive. In extreme cases, someone would quickly reach the limits of the cost cap if they didn't simultaneously scale back development. This proposal still has to be approved.

  "argos_summary": "Cadillac F1 is set to debut in 2026 with a driver lineup that includes former Red Bull star Sergio\u202fPerez and Mercedes reserve Valtteri\u202fBottas, both of whom have expressed interest in joining the new American team. Perez, who left Red Bull after the 2024 season, has stated he will only return to F1 if the project appeals to him and he is not willing to take a reserve role. The team will use Ferrari power units from 2026 until it develops its own engines in 2029, and it plans to conduct testing with former Ferrari cars to prepare the drivers. The announcement of the driver contracts is expected before the summer break ends, with official confirmation likely before the next weekend\u2019s race.",
