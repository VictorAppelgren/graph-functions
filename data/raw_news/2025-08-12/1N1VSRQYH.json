      "text": "The Best Sex and the City Outfits of All Time And just like that...we picked our faves. By Amber Rambharose Published on June 22, 2023 @ 10:10AM In This Article View All In This Article Carrie's Mixed Prints Carrie's Rose Peplum Dress Carrie's Beaded Fringe Dress Carrie's Cupcake Skirt Charlotte's Black Bridesmaid Dress Carrie's Vivienne Westwood Wedding Dress Samantha's '80s Jumpsuit Carrie's Mixed Floral Prints Miranda's \"Skinny\" Jeans Carrie's Dreamy Floral Ruffles Samantha Jones' Vintage Suit Close Credit: Getty Images What's more exciting than a Samantha Jones appearance in Season 2 of And Just Like That? How about a strut down memory lane looking back at all of Samantha, Carrie, Miranda, and Charlotte's most iconic looks from Sex and the City's six seasons and two movies? With Season 2 of And Just Like That underway, there's no better time than now to look back at the iconic looks from the extended Sex and the City universe. Whether you self-identify as a Carrie, Miranda, Samantha, or Charlotte, chances are one of these 12 best Sex and the City fashion looks from episodes \u2014 and movies \u2014 past will get you in the mood for even more of the fab four\u2019s fashion-forward styling. Carrie's Mixed Prints Getty Images The true mark of a fashion girlie is unapologetically mixing prints, something Carrie Bradshaw was all about right from the start of Sex and the City. Carrie's Rose Peplum Dress Getty Images Peplums are back with a vengeance, earning this look a spot on our list of best Sex and the City outfits simply for remaining relevant over a decade after the fact. Carrie's Beaded Fringe Dress Getty Images Love or hate Aleksandr Petrovsky, the only man to ever whisk Carrie Bradshaw away from NYC, you have to admit that his relationship with Carrie brought out some of her best looks, including this beaded fringe mini dress. Carrie's Cupcake Skirt Getty Images Our girl Carrie Bradshaw loved a tiered ruffle skirt and ankle boot as far back as 2003 when the sixth and final season of Sex and the City was filmed. The cropped jacket and red scoop neck tee on top added the perfect, subversive finishing touches. Charlotte's Black Bridesmaid Dress Getty Images The dress that launched a thousand memes has maintained its icon status since Kristen Davis pointed a furious finger at Mr. Big after he left Carrie at the altar in the first Sex and the City movie. Carrie's Vivienne Westwood Wedding Dress Getty Images Sure, the vintage suit that only she liked was the look Carrie actually wound up wearing to get married, but we still love the drama in this Vivienne Westwood wedding gown (just not the drama that came afterward). Samantha's '80s Jumpsuit Getty Images Do you remember what an absolute backless slay Samantha Jones' '80s-inspired jumpsuit was in \"The Post-It Always Sticks Twice,\" the iconic Season 6 iconic episode when he-who-we-will-not-name breaks up with Carrie via Post-It? We do. Carrie's Mixed Floral Prints Getty Images Who says you can't mix floral prints? Carrie Bradshaw certainly didn't get the memo in the first Sex and the City movie, and we're so glad she went for this look. Miranda's \"Skinny\" Jeans Getty Images Miranda was rarely as triumphant as she was when she fit into the \"skinny\" jeans after giving birth. The '70s bangles she stacked on her wrists and the layered thin belts were the most iconic elements of her look, but her confidence alone makes this 'fit one of the series' most iconic. Carrie's Dreamy Floral Ruffles Getty Images Early seasons of Sex and the City served us some subtly iconic fashion moments like this romantic ruffle floral dress Carrie Bradshaw wore in Season 3. Samantha Jones' Vintage Suit Getty Images Fans had mixed feelings about the first Sex and the City movie, but we adored the looks it featured from top to bottom, including this belted skirt suit worn by Kim Cattrall's Samantha Jones. Monochromatic, vintage-inspired, and perfectly fitted? Yes, yes, and yes. Read more: Fashion"

Wait okay a journalist.\nSpeaker 1 (03:25):\nI mean why not.\nSpeaker 3 (03:26):\nIt's because everyone's like, oh, yeah, you can do this podcast.\nBut even this, I'm like, you're my heroes, Like I\ngrew up with your work. Like I'm just so this\nis so And for the first thirty minutes it's just\nme being like I can't believe it's you and my\nbrain just being like in hearing your voice, yeah, to\nsay that to Youla or it's like her voice, yes,\nit's just like immediately I'm safe.\nSpeaker 2 (03:48):\nThat's nice.\nSpeaker 1 (03:49):\nThat is nice. I mean I'm going through such a thing,\nlike to go back and watch your work from so\nlong ago, you know, it is it's like therapeutic in\nso many ways, but it's also kind of trippy in\na weird way. It brings it home to you how\nlong you have been actually doing this.\nSpeaker 2 (04:06):\nI'm sure.\nSpeaker 3 (04:07):\nAnd the kind of also like thinking of the stories\nof the days, and I think that's even like, you know,\nI've done one season of a show and I watched\nit back and it's just funny being like, oh, I\nknow what I felt like that day.\nSpeaker 2 (04:19):\nI was puffy that day.\nSpeaker 1 (04:22):\nBefore, Yes, exactly the worst.\nSpeaker 2 (04:26):\nI'm just I'm so and I love it.\nSpeaker 1 (04:28):\nI love it every day, but it's not really there's\na couple of scenes where I go some ice, I\nthink you look amazing, So do you all the time?\nSpeaker 2 (04:36):\nAll the time?\nSpeaker 1 (04:38):\nNow, okay, I just want to backtrack in Benning World,\nso stand up, YouTube or both at the same time.\nSpeaker 3 (04:46):\nIt was the same time, but actually I think it\nwas Instagram first. Wow, yeah, which was kind of I\nI was still in the closet in college, right and show.\nSpeaker 1 (04:56):\nThat's what his show is about. If anyone hasn't seen\nit on Amazon TV Prime is it's really really clever\nand a version of this story that we have not seen.\nSo I really appreciate that.\nSpeaker 2 (05:05):\nThank you so much. I can't wait to if we\nget to do season two. I can't wait to make\nyou come.\nSpeaker 3 (05:11):\nRight. I feel like I don't know, you're so okay, yeah,\nlike you and Connie sisters.\nSpeaker 1 (05:17):\nYes, I love Connie so much.\nSpeaker 2 (05:19):\nIs I got so lucky. My parents were fantastic. Yeah.\nSpeaker 3 (05:23):\nI started on Instagram with this thing called dubsmash. They\nwere like lip sync videos, okay, and I loved doing that.\nSpeaker 1 (05:30):\nBut you just have like creative energy that had nowhere\nto go.\nSpeaker 2 (05:34):\nOh my god, so much.\nSpeaker 3 (05:35):\nI mean, even in this, I'm sure the comments will\nbe like so add I mean, I just like I\ngo everywhere, I think, so yeah with me, Yes, let's go,\nlet's go in the street. But yeah, I just I\nthink it had been so suppressed, like a performative version\nof me that maybe only came out when I had\nlike two drinks and was just with a girl and\nwe were like laughing and I could kind of let\n(05:56):\nit go. But I did lip sync videos because I\ndidn't want anyone to hear my voice, because I was\nlike the internet, wooll no, I'm gay.\nSpeaker 2 (06:05):\nEven though I was going really low.\nSpeaker 3 (06:07):\nI was like baritone, but I was so I was like, okay,\nI'll do this, and then people started commenting on them\nand sharing them, right, and then I came out and\nthen I was like.\nSpeaker 2 (06:16):\nOkay, maybe I'll do a sketch that's like I speak.\nSpeaker 3 (06:19):\nAnd I think it's me as a New Yorker describing\nhow to get somewhere. And so I was like me\nsaying like from the L to the.\nSpeaker 2 (06:25):\nF to the you know.\nSpeaker 3 (06:26):\nAnd I watch it back and it's shocking how deep\nI still was making my voice like it almost sounds\nlike there's like a like a modulator on Oh my gosh,\na little. It's mortifying, but I had to rewatch all\nthose things to get back and real you.\nSpeaker 1 (06:40):\nSee, it's mortifying, But I think it's important to say\nit is not easy in this world, no to come\nout to be different in any way. And sometimes it\nseems like we've made all these incredible strides forward, yet\nwe continue to go back and even like my daughter's\nturning fourteen and you know her, her friends, they're so worried,\n(07:01):\nyou know, about how they look and all the things like,\nit's still so true, and so I think it's just\nit kind of breaks my heart because here I have\nbeen living in this world, you know, the sex and\nthe City world. Obviously it's a very gay world in\na wonderful way, do you know what I mean? Yeah,\nI like that world, feel the power of it at\nof course, but then sometimes when you go back out\n(07:22):\nof that bubble, it's shocking.\nSpeaker 3 (07:24):\nIt's I'm so, it's so nice to hear you say that,\nbecause I think also, you know, there is this thing\nthat I had kind of when we were putting out\nthe show and some people being like, well do people\ncare about coming out anymore? Like is that a thing\nand my thing is, I'm like, yes, I think maybe\nwe're in New York and La Bubbles. Yeah, you don't\nknow what people are saying in locker rooms and Idaho. Still, yeah,\nI can't imagine that with the administration we have that\n(07:45):\nthey're saying that nice of things.\nSpeaker 2 (07:48):\nAnd really, what I think, you know.\nSpeaker 3 (07:49):\nEven I'm sorry to say this to someone who has\na fourteen year old girl, but I feel like there\nis that it's just one comment that someone says that\njust sticks with you. And that's literally why I made\nthe show. I'm like, it's just this group of kids\nin college that all got told this one thing about themselves,\nand it can be something as big as like, oh\nmy god, I'm gay no one can find out, or\njust like my hair's frizzy, or I'm not thin enough\n(08:11):\nor you know, it's like and then we have to\ncreate these full worlds around ourselves.\nSpeaker 1 (08:15):\nThey actually to that comment absolutely absolutely, I know what\nthe truth is. I mean, as you're getting older and\nyou're you're going through all of the things that you\ngo through, you realize that it doesn't matter if they\nlove you. You find your people and that's really all that matters, exactly.\nBut I will say this, and this is one of\nthe things that I really respect about you, is that\nyou've really done a lot of this publicly online and YouTube.\n(08:39):\nI mean that's not easy. Yeah, there are so many\npeople who are so mad critical, and their way, this\nis the way I'm thinking of it currently, their way\nto express themselves and get that out is towards other\npeople online. So for you, I worry, like you want\nto be handling it great, but like, yeah, how to deal.\nSpeaker 2 (09:01):\nI'm sure you feel that too. I mean, oh my god,\nyou're an actress who's done this for you.\nSpeaker 1 (09:08):\nBut we didn't have it. First of all, the whole\nis true, that's kind of nice.\nSpeaker 3 (09:11):\nYou just read it in like oneew maybe exactly.\nSpeaker 1 (09:15):\nLike and then you just stop reading reviews, which you\ncould do before everything was on that phone.\nSpeaker 3 (09:20):\nThat's the problem too, because you want to see the\ngood stuff. I want to know the scenes people loved\nor things that were making them laugh. And then oh god,\nyeah I got one recently that was so vile and\nI'm just like, god, I can't believe you even put\nthat in writing my thing that I'm trying to figure\nout how this would work. But I think if you're\non the Internet. It should have to be your full name.\nI mean, it should have to be your full name,\n(09:41):\nand it has to be like your driver's license or something.\nSpeaker 2 (09:43):\nYou know.\nSpeaker 1 (09:43):\nI'm like, I just I agree. I don't think there's\nreally a level of covering that enables people to be\nthey're most angry and mean selves.\nSpeaker 3 (09:52):\nAnd I get why people are angry right now. I\nmean that makes sense to me. And I think that\nif you know, if I'm the punching bag, fine, just don't.\nSpeaker 2 (09:59):\nDo it to my girls in my show.\nSpeaker 3 (10:01):\nI'm like, That's where I'm like, don't you dare do\nit to anyone else in the show. That's where I\nget like, So I'm like, how dear, like you know,\nand but you know, I feel like I learned this\nthing early and I forget where. I think I just\nsaw it on like a you know, I'm sure like\nwiki how told me how.\nSpeaker 2 (10:16):\nTo do this?\nSpeaker 3 (10:17):\nBut it was like if you see a mean comment,\ngo and like respond to a nice one, and then\nit's like you're having the connection with someone who's like\ngone out of their way to say something nice, which\nreally good is also not something that's common, Like people\ndon't nice.\nSpeaker 1 (10:29):\nPeople don't say that much it's just why heart right,\nand the other thing gets amplified and that's such a\nconfusing thing.\nSpeaker 3 (10:37):\nOh, it's so confusing, and you're like, oh my god.\nI someone told me I had dry lips one time.\nThey said dry a butthole lips. Sorry, that's where we're at.\nAnd I was like, so now every day, I mean,\nI was just in the bathroom, I'm like, can't have\na you know, I'm like.\nSpeaker 1 (10:52):\nI just it really no, it's true, it's true. I\nmean I don't I don't know that I have that\nbecause I have had so many negative comments for you know,\nprobably the entirety of my career Jesus. But I think\nthe things for me that lodged in there where I\nhad to create a thing around it, like you were saying,\n(11:13):\nwith you know, trying to be straight over compensating to\ncover the truth for so long you do create like\na whole persona or whatever. I think mine was relating\nto the thinness issue, which is, you know, it's hysterical\nto say I can realize that now, right, But like\nthere were times when Sarajisca would be like, you have\nbuddy dess morphia. I'd be like, I don't think I\n(11:33):\ndo because the world is literally telling me daily that\nI am para shaped, you know what I say, like\nso much, so much, to the point where like you\ncan't think straight, do you know what I mean? But\nthen you also, you know you have disordered eating. You're\nstarving yourself. I remember fainting in a parking lot one\ntime because I was on some crazy diet, you know\nwhat I mean. And then you're trying to work, and\nremember you're lying all the craziness, right, And then for\n(11:55):\nmany years, someone asked me the other day, like, you know,\nwhat do people say to you when they you you know,\nand it's morphed over time, which is the best. Right.\nThere was a good number of years when we were\non like the old school in your televisions, right, like\nHBO proper, And when people would see me on the\nstreet here or in New York, they would say, oh,\nbut you're not fat. I know, and I know they\n(12:19):\ndidn't mean anything bad. They mean it as a compliment, right,\nBut it's because I'm standing next to right, I get\nthat too. Or you're pretty your own person, and I'm\njust like, well.\nSpeaker 3 (12:29):\nOkay, I always get you're tall, Yeah, okay, I mean\nlike i'd be fine.\nSpeaker 1 (12:36):\nI'm like, you know, no, this is because I think\nnow because now the culture is like weirdly knows so\nmuch about what we do, right, so they know that\nall these other actors that they used to think were\ntall aren't actually not tall. I'm not going to name\nthem right now.\nSpeaker 2 (12:53):\nLater Offline season two.\nSpeaker 1 (12:57):\nBut it's it's so there's like a weird cynicism about\nour industry and about us that then permeates the thinking\nand the comments.\nSpeaker 3 (13:05):\nOh that is such a that is kind of explains\neverything almost like because even I do this podcast with\nMary Beth Brain.\nSpeaker 2 (13:14):\nYou listening to.\nSpeaker 1 (13:15):\nOur brain on the way here?\nSpeaker 3 (13:17):\nHave you heard us like our favorite scene in Sex\nand the City is Charlotte.\nSpeaker 2 (13:22):\nOkay, we'll save it for later. But I'm your wife\nand I'm sexual and I love you period.\nSpeaker 1 (13:31):\nHow I was dying when I had to film that.\nSpeaker 3 (13:33):\nWe you don't understand, but it's like it's so real.\nIt's so the inspiration for overcompensating it. You know, it's\nlike just being so vulnerable with someone and then they're\nlike looking at a titty mag It's like, what is\nthis life? I cannot believe that you shot that show\nwith no intimacy coordinator.\nSpeaker 2 (13:51):\nThat really is. So I'm laughing because I'm uncomfortable. I know,\nI'm just like that, but.\nSpeaker 1 (13:57):\nWe have one now. It was, but it wasn't Helen.\nSpeaker 2 (13:59):\nOkay, Okay, that's it wasn't.\nSpeaker 1 (14:01):\nIt definitely wasn't. And I did get in some terrible\ntrouble for saying something in jest on my own podcast. Okay,\nI repeat, I know, my god, right, like, oh, I\nthought that because you were telling the whole story that\nyou'd be safe, but.\nSpeaker 3 (14:14):\nNo, it's just a little cliff yeah, or I'm finding that. Yeah,\nI'm learning that every day.\nSpeaker 2 (14:20):\nI mean, it's a post full video podcast.\nSpeaker 1 (14:24):\nLike the more the more people know you, the more\nbaby you will become.\nSpeaker 3 (14:28):\nAnd I'm like, oh no, that's not that's I'm now.\nI'm truly I'm not that serious about really that many things.\nSpeaker 2 (14:36):\nYou know. It's like you I just kind of said that.\nSpeaker 1 (14:39):\nSeems like I'm so angry.\nSpeaker 3 (14:42):\nOh no, I was just kind of like having fun\nand I think my back hurt definitely.\nSpeaker 2 (14:47):\nWell.\nSpeaker 1 (14:47):\nThe thing that I said was in relationship to the\nintimacy coordinators. We were talking to Jenny Biks, who one\nof our early writers, first woman writer, and I was\njoking about Michael Patrick pushing me to do something that\nI was nervous about, and I was saying, it turned\nout fine. There's one of those things that in your\nmind you build up like I can't do it, I\ncan't do it, I don't know. I'm s and because\nwe didn't have the thing that I like about intimacy coordinators,\n(15:10):\nbecause we do have them on and just like that.\nBut it's really hard because it's most of us who\nwere together for all these many thirty years. It's a\nweird change. Do you have another person involved?\nSpeaker 3 (15:21):\nOh yeah, And it's it's very private, which is not\nI think that's what I was so fortunate because I'm\nthe creator in the show and I'm like, I loved\nthat I could have like private conversations and that all\nactors could have a private conversation.\nSpeaker 2 (15:34):\nI think that's part.\nSpeaker 3 (15:35):\nI think everyone thinks it's like in front of everyone,\nthat the intimacy coordinator's kind of there on set like\nwatching you, and you know it's kind of had one\nthat way. Okay, well that that was weird. So there's\na bad one. So that's not one that should be working.\nBut I found like so much piece in it. Of like,\nI'm so nervous about this thing, and I'm the creator\nand I don't want anyone to think I'm nervous.\nSpeaker 2 (15:55):\nI wrote it like what you.\nSpeaker 3 (15:57):\nKnow, it'd be the thing where one of the girls\nwould be like, you're nervous.\nSpeaker 1 (16:01):\nYeah right, I'm going to be.\nSpeaker 2 (16:05):\nTrying to make sure.\nSpeaker 3 (16:07):\nAnd because I think even with sex and the city too,\nthere is something about it being at times sex for comedy,\nwhich as an actor is so it's so uncomfortable because\nyou're like, no, I swear I'm.\nSpeaker 2 (16:18):\nGood at that.\nSpeaker 3 (16:19):\nYou know, it's like everyone's laughing at we make out\nwith this person, but like I'm actually like not a loser,\nof course.\nSpeaker 1 (16:24):\nAnd also you you know that it's for the comedy.\nBut as a woman, I would say the thing that\nwas great, especially back then, was that there had there\nwasn't really sex for comedy like in the film or\nthe TV, right, So it freed you in a certain\nway that you didn't have to be all like, you know,\nfake seductress all the time.\nSpeaker 2 (16:44):\nYeah, I know that makes sense, which is like if\nyou were.\nSpeaker 1 (16:46):\nAuditioning for some big film, you knew there would be some.\nSpeaker 3 (16:48):\nScene you have to fake seductress. There's so much your\nfake seductor. It's an overcompensating and sex in the city.\nThat's the diagram. Yeah, they're kind of like, isn't this hot?\nAnd they're like, no, not really different.\nSpeaker 1 (17:03):\nBut that's the difference, right, is yet like it's called\nout rather than like the movie version and the way\nthat I like to talk about it. I don't feel\nlike I've really perfected it. But when we started the show,\nwe had we as a group were unsure of what\nwe were doing with this sexuality, Like was it for\nthe male gaze, which is what everything else had been.\nThere had not been something made for the female gaze\n(17:26):\nof watching and performing and talking about something for them, right,\nSo like there were There's a scene in the first season,\nI think it was the first season where I'm trying\nto get this guy aroused and the director, I believe\nat the time, I'm not sure, think it was the\ndirector and or the DP thought that I was going\n(17:46):\nto be doing this hand motion on top of the\nsheets and I was like, yeah, no, what what that's\nreally weird? Like no, because as you know, you read something,\nyou have it in your mind, right, So it was\nunder the sheets what it should be like on the television.\nSpeaker 2 (18:03):\nWhat the heck did you bring to it? It's like,\nthis is.\nSpeaker 1 (18:06):\nRight, and like then it would you could use the\ncomedy more to just be like on my face you\ncan tell it's not working because you're obviously not going\nto show that it's not working.\nSpeaker 2 (18:14):\nWhat the heck?\nSpeaker 1 (18:15):\nRight? But this is the beginning. And it was also\nlike two am and Darren Starr wasn't there, Michael Patrick\nwasn't there. It was like me and the director, nobody\nwas there. None of my girlfriends were there, right, So\nI had to go lock myself in my room because\nthere's no intimacy coordinator, right, there's no one to help me,\nand to lock myself in my room, call my manager\nin LA and be like, what do I do? You\nwant me to do a hand job on top of\nthe sheets basically.\nSpeaker 3 (18:36):\nThe community, and they're just like this career I chose right,\nlike this.\nSpeaker 1 (18:40):\nA horrible, horrible mistake. Which I also had to call\nmy manager about the outfit when I come out and\nI say, I'm your wife and I'm sexual because that\nthing was see through, right, And I think there was\na conversation of should I wear underwear or not? And\nI think that came possibly from pat Field, because pot\nField is living out there on the edge at all times. Yeah,\n(19:03):\nliving every second of the day. And I think for her,\nyou know, she wanted Charlotte to be really out there.\nSpeaker 2 (19:10):\nYeah, this is the moment.\nSpeaker 3 (19:11):\nIt's like, I'm it's kind of her like last like.\nSpeaker 1 (19:16):\nLike absolutely and sadly he failed. Yeah, but I did\nnot think that I should do that, you know what\nI'm saying, of.\nSpeaker 2 (19:24):\nCourse, Yeah, yeah, Yeah, that's the conversation.\nSpeaker 3 (19:26):\nIt's like almost having those conversations, like the thoughts of\nlike having people to talk to that about. You know,\nit's like that's almost sometimes all you need.\nSpeaker 1 (19:34):\nAbsolutely, and that's what a good intimacy coordinator is doing.\nLike what is your concern you're in private? What is\nyour concern? You know, what do you want me to\nwatch for? What are you uncomfortable about? And like my\nthing that I always say, and I mean usually it's\nEvan right for me, and obviously I know him really well.\nBut you know, I did something else right before COVID,\nwhich was I think my first time with an intimacy coordinator,\n(19:55):\nand that was the questionable one. I had come from\na dance background, so her idea was to count us\ndown like a dance number. Okay, kiss two, three four, roll?\nSpeaker 3 (20:13):\nOh good, I'm glad. It's yeah, I'm dancing with the\nstarry I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 1 (20:19):\nI know another we were, but I was with another\nreally veteran actor, so thank god. But the thing that\nI had done, which was helpful in private, she said,\nwhat would you like? You know down here? Would you\nlike uh, you know, little patches, all the different choices?\nAnd I said, well, what does he want? Because you\n(20:40):\nknow you want to be on the same page. You\ndon't want to.\nSpeaker 3 (20:44):\nI was already scared. Yeah, he's going to throw a\ndog out. But sorry, no, but you know what it's like. Wait,\nI'm your son and I'm sexual and I love you.\nSpeaker 1 (21:03):\nSorry, okay, but I'm also Charlotte.\nSpeaker 3 (21:06):\nTotal total, and I'm telling you I'm always with charlottees love.\nI surround myself with Charlotte. You do, and I think\nI'm Charlotte Rising. We'll talk about Okay, I want.\nSpeaker 1 (21:14):\nTo hear I wonder anyway we're way off. I love\nit so much. I don't know where to go back to.\nSpeaker 2 (21:30):\nGosh, it's yeah, when what his what? His version?\nSpeaker 1 (21:34):\nHis version was cool? We can go with him now\nbecause he's awesome, And I don't want to make it\nseem like I'm complaining. It's going to be some fun\nkind of click.\nSpeaker 3 (21:40):\nI can tell to this is I was talking about,\nThey're like interesting the first time they does the tape. Yeah,\nI didn't know that there was this is terrible, but\nI hear it. I didn't know that there was like\na pad also like a sock essentially. I was just\nlike yes, and so I was like, oh, but and\n(22:01):\nthe whole thing was sticky. So it just ripped all\nthe hair off under my mom and I was like,\noh my and I'm like crying in my trailer and\nI'm like, oh my god.\nSpeaker 2 (22:10):\nI just I was not.\nSpeaker 3 (22:12):\nSo then after that, I, you know, more conversations with\ncostume and.\nSpeaker 1 (22:17):\nIt needs to be involved. Definitely, definitely. I mean I\nbelieve that my very seasoned coastar who I was with,\nwho I love very much, there was a towel, Okay,\nso there was like a everyone was covered privately, right,\nand then there was a towel in between, kind of\nlike a traditional con.\nSpeaker 2 (22:34):\nOkay, moms to figure that out.\nSpeaker 1 (22:39):\nYeah yeah, yeah, my god, even more interesting. I mean,\nit was more just for you know protection, you know\nwhat I'm saying.\nSpeaker 3 (22:48):\nYeah, it was just no matter what, it's weird and straight. Yeah,\nit's just straight, and it does get brought up so much.\nLike during press, I really was just like, oh, so\nmany people ask about this.\nSpeaker 1 (23:00):\nAnd I think people are very curious, and I get it.\nI get it, especially if you are in something like\nyour show or our show where there is a lot sex.\nBut let's get back to the business for a second,\nand then we're going to talk about the show. Okay,\nSo this is what I'm super fascinated. So you started\njust doing stuff on the Instagram. Yeah, with a different\nvoice because you didn't want anyone to know you were\ngay from your voice, which is like set put adorable. Yeah,\n(23:24):\nand then at a certain point you come out and\nyou decide, okay, I can use my voice, and then\nyou are more free and you start doing more skits\nand you put them on YouTube. Yeah.\nSpeaker 3 (23:33):\nIt was so it was kind of like, I the\nfloodgates were open once I was out and I met\nmy boyfriend Terry, and it was like, you know, he said,\nyour Instagram's private, like you should make it public, because\nI told him randomly i'd met him, and I had\nnever really said this out loud. But he's like, what\ndo you what do you really want to be? Like,\nI'm looking at your Instagram. You keep making these sketches,\n(23:54):\nand I was like, I just like really want to\nbe an actor.\nSpeaker 2 (23:56):\nBut I'm from Idaho.\nSpeaker 1 (23:58):\nSo that was now, which is crazy.\nSpeaker 2 (24:00):\nIt was just like that wasn't on the menu.\nSpeaker 3 (24:01):\nAnd then I went to school at Georgetown, which also,\nyou know, not a lot of actor yeah, and feels\nvery like, you know, you would go more into like\ngovernment or journalism, right, you know, And so I was like, okay,\nI'm just gonna not say it there either. And then\nfor some reason, in a park in Williamsburg one day\nto him, I was like, I want to be an\n(24:22):\nactor so bad. And he's like, I don't know anyone\nin that industry. And he's like, I don't know anyone\nwho's gone into it. He's like, you don't know anyone\nis I think maybe the internet is probably the only way.\nAnd I thought too, I was like, yeah, that's kind\nof my thought that like maybe I'll like, like do\nyou just.\nSpeaker 2 (24:39):\nGo viral and then you get an agent and then\nyou're in a movie?\nSpeaker 1 (24:42):\nYou know.\nSpeaker 2 (24:42):\nI'm like, I don't know how this works for me,\nhe just did.\nSpeaker 3 (24:44):\nSo I was just like, yeah, I would go to\nwork in the morning. I was editing videos first startup,\nand then they paid for Premiere Pro on this on\nthis computer, right, so it's like great, I have I\nhave an editing software now. So I would go and\nthen after work I would go and buy a coffee\nand like make my videos for the rest of the.\nSpeaker 1 (25:01):\nNight until like one am, and then we're happening.\nSpeaker 3 (25:04):\nAnd then it was like I did that probably for\nlike four or five months, and then I made this\nqueer Eye parody video and that one kind of I\nfinally saw like oh, like a lot of comedians that\nI loved were sharing it and actors and the cast responded,\nwhich was like the first time I'd had that kind\nof connection, and they were also sweet and really, I think,\n(25:25):\nyou know, I've always come to comedy, and I hope\nthat people feel this way of anyone I've done an\nimpression of that. I like, I never do something that\nI don't enjoy, like I love If I love someone's music,\nI'll do an impression of them. It's never really coming\nfrom like me. I'm not pointing at you, Yeah, I'm\njust kind of like this is an internet version of\nyou and like a you know, my caricature of this.\nSpeaker 1 (25:47):\nTotally, I haven't done it.\nSpeaker 2 (25:49):\nWhich is so crazy. I always wanted to do it.\nSpeaker 3 (25:51):\nI don't know what because I should do it, because\nI think for voices I could probably do you in\nSamantha the easiest totally, but yeah, Sarah, Jessica's hard, I\ndon't know. And then and she's a little hard yeah,\nand I feel.\nSpeaker 2 (26:04):\nLike okay, then maybe yeah, I'm like definitely. It takes\nme like that.\nSpeaker 1 (26:08):\nI remember the first time Saturday Night Live parody and\nyou're just like, oh my god, and you're like scared,\nand then you're like excited. I mean, it really is flattering.\nSpeaker 2 (26:16):\nIt is in the end, it's flattering.\nSpeaker 3 (26:18):\nI think that's what some I've had some conversations with\npeople I've done, and I think at first they think like, WHOA,\nwell you're not sure, you know, yeah, They're like because\nI think that naturally. I think we grew up, like\nI definitely did, around a time where it was more\nlike sketches on YouTube and things were a little bit meaner,\nlike if you were going to do a parody of someone,\n(26:39):\nit was usually you were like really not you know,\nyou and kind of going below the belt. And so\nI understood that people maybe come to my you know,\ncame to my videos with with caution and yeah being.\nSpeaker 1 (26:51):\nSuspicious, But how did so how did you know to\nput them on YouTube?\nSpeaker 3 (26:55):\nThat was just something I was I was watching YouTube\nat work all the time, and I was watching makeup\nartists Nick tutorials, so it's like my number one yeah\nand and like Jackie Aina, and they were all teaching\nme how to do Kardashian makeup because I was doing\nKardashian like you.\nSpeaker 1 (27:12):\nHad to know how to do it very complicated.\nSpeaker 3 (27:15):\nIt was so hard, and I was like I kind\nof want to look I want to try and look\nlike them. And then I started to love doing makeup too,\nso but it was just I was like, Okay, I\nfeel like YouTube's a good place for this. And YouTube\nis never like my major. It was always but I\nwas very smart to do. But I was like, great,\nwe'll do YouTube too. And then I started like a\nZodiac series and that kind of ended right before COVID.\nSpeaker 2 (27:37):\nDuring COVID, I just like went.\nSpeaker 1 (27:39):\nFull, it's incredible that you did this before COVID, like\nyou were on it.\nSpeaker 2 (27:43):\nMan.\nSpeaker 3 (27:43):\nNo, I really am like I can't make any more videos,\nis what I'm finding.\nSpeaker 1 (27:47):\nI guess.\nSpeaker 3 (27:47):\nI as as the show has come out, I'm like, oh,\npeople keep finding old ones, and I'm like, that is\nnot funny. I'm really I did not need to see\nthat one again. But but I love it right because.\nSpeaker 1 (27:58):\nI mean, I'm by years ago. You know what I'm saying,\nand it's Goodly there's something that doesn't hold up, you know,\nit's that's okay. We can talk about it like we grow,\nwe learned. Society changes, sometimes for better, sometimes not for better.\nSpeaker 2 (28:13):\nYou watch it back, you go, I like you are\nyou ever? Like I ate that day.\nSpeaker 3 (28:19):\nI have to think that when you step out after\nyou've had the miscarriage. Sorry, such a devastating No, it's\ndevastating people when you step out in that pink dress.\nSpeaker 1 (28:29):\nI haven't gotten. I mean, I know the look, I\nknow the look. I all think this. This this is\nback to my thank you, thank you. I As you said,\nwhen you're watching your work, you have so many different\nthoughts that go through about the day you filmed, about\nwhat was going on in your life at that Like,\nso many different things flood you, you know, not necessarily\n(28:49):\nobjective things like I ate in that scene or whatever. Yeah,\nI will think this though from the early because I'm\nonly in second season. I will think my hair looks great.\nSpeaker 2 (28:58):\nOh yeah, and it always that That's.\nSpeaker 1 (29:00):\nWhat I think. You're like, Wow, they did a great job.\nNow there's a couple of questionable styles, and that so\nwas I'm like, why am I wearing that eyeshadow? I\nthink the most random, weird things about myself. Yeah, I\nwant to go back to YouTube for a second. Okay, yeah,\nbecause do you know that the whole entire industry is\nlike unbelievably obsessed with YouTube right now? Do you know this?\nSpeaker 2 (29:18):\nI kind of? I mean, YouTube.\nSpeaker 1 (29:20):\nNumbers are super crazy in a way that none of\nthe other streamers, with the exception of Netflix, which obviously\nhas its own market share, that they were way ahead\nwhere Max.\nSpeaker 2 (29:30):\nAnd Prime Video Girls were. You know, we're doing the best.\nSpeaker 1 (29:32):\nWe're never going to reach either one of these two.\nAnd there's a lot of consternation. There's a lot of consternation.\nBut you very smartly put your stuff on YouTube and\nthen how did you go from there to your own show?\nSpeaker 2 (29:43):\nI need to know, my god.\nSpeaker 3 (29:44):\nOkay, So the the short of it kind of because\nlike I have to talk to you about fifteen different\nCharlotte looks.\nSpeaker 2 (29:52):\nAnd also to tell you why I wore this way.\nThere was a whole journey.\nSpeaker 1 (29:55):\nOkay, okay, so I it's a good color.\nSpeaker 3 (29:58):\nActually, thank you so much. It it was a yeah,\nI almost wore butter yellow, but it's got none could\nSo it was.\nSpeaker 2 (30:07):\nActually a very like New York story.\nSpeaker 3 (30:10):\nCaroline's on Broadway emailed me, I'm so sad they're not\nthere anymore. I don't think they haven't been in a while,\nwhich is so sad because that was such a special place.\nAnd they reached out to me because of my sketches\non the Instagram YouTube and we're like, do you have\na live show because we're doing New York Comedy Fest\nand we want kind of a range of different shows.\nAnd I was like, of course I have a live show.\nSpeaker 1 (30:32):\nAnd I was like I need to.\nSpeaker 2 (30:33):\nPay rent, you know what.\nSpeaker 3 (30:34):\nI thought like, oh yeah, maybe I could do this\nto pay rent because I didn't. I had gotten fired\nfrom this job. I had absolutely no money. My boyfriend\nlet me live with him. I was just like I, okay, cool, yeah, great,\nI'll make a live show. So I kind of did\nlike a stand up boot camp where I was like,\nI'll say yes to every And I had kind of\nbeen writing like stand up lines for a bit, but\nnot a show what a show would look like. But\n(30:56):\nI wrote this show called Overcompensating, and it was a\nstand up show about me being in the closet in\nhigh school and college, and then it kind of wove\nin my characters and kind of my journey and how\nI felt like both really confident and then also like,\nyou know, you come out and then you're like, okay,\nso I'm gay, but also like who am I as\na person now that I've been so stifled I think\n(31:19):\nfor so long. So yeah, that was kind of the\namazing the I guess like ethos of that show. And\nthen during that time, my agent reached out to me\nand he was like, you know, I'm watching your sketches\nand they're starting to feel like more episodic. So it's\ndoing these Kardashian ones, and they would be like Kardashian Christmas.\nSpeaker 2 (31:36):\nI'm sure you're familiar the classic.\nSpeaker 3 (31:39):\nCardaccian christ but and I was like, no, I didn't\ngo to school for it, but thank you for reaching out,\nyou know. I'm like always great to get a call\nfrom my agent and he was like, no, just like\njust try it.\nSpeaker 2 (31:49):\nYou don't have to.\nSpeaker 3 (31:50):\nHe's like, you know, you can figure out formatting later,\nbut you're writing scenes, and so I was like, okay, great.\nSo I went into my notes app and the first\nscene I wrote was this pregame scene with Benny Carmon\nand Haley and I had a character at that time\nnamed Hailey, and it just like fully.\nSpeaker 1 (32:04):\nInspired the character she is now amazing.\nSpeaker 2 (32:06):\nBrilliantly by Holmes.\nSpeaker 3 (32:07):\nBut yeah, I just I went to this kind of\nlike core relationship between gay men and women, and I\nwas like, I think when I met this girl in college,\nit was the first time I wasn't overcompensating so much.\nI started to tiptoe out of the closet and I'm like,\nI don't know if I've seen that relationship on screen\nin a while. That shows how complicated it is, too,\n(32:28):\nbecause it's very complicated, like sexually and emotionally. And then\nin the end I'm like, I my girls like saved\nyou know, my life and like changed my life amazing.\nSpeaker 1 (32:37):\nAnd then how did it become a show?\nSpeaker 2 (32:40):\nOh my god?\nSpeaker 3 (32:40):\nSo I wrote the pilot because I thought Internet boy,\nI got to just write this thing or else, no\none's going to believe that I can. So I kind\nof went on a boot camp again. I watched the\nShonda Rhimes master Class. Yeah, my friend gave me her\ndad's log in for master class. Thank you, Shonda. It's\na fabulous master class.\nSpeaker 1 (32:57):\nI mean, and I just wondered and I just was\nlike how I.\nSpeaker 3 (33:00):\nBut also I also didn't learn too many rules of scriptwriting.\nSo in my scripts, I like talk to the reader,\nwhich I didn't know, like I try to make the\nreader laugh, which I didn't.\nSpeaker 2 (33:12):\nI was just kind of like, oh, I want.\nSpeaker 3 (33:14):\nThis to be fun to read, because I assume a\nlot of people are reading scripts all, you.\nSpeaker 2 (33:17):\nKnow, all day.\nSpeaker 3 (33:18):\nSo I would say like, you know how that feels\nlull or like things like that as you know, or\nI'd be like I hate I hate how my fingers\nfeel right now, or like I would just say it's\nkind of like random.\nSpeaker 1 (33:28):\nLike intimate, it's kind of it.\nSpeaker 3 (33:30):\nVery yeah, where I would be like I hate writing\nthis scene, you know, And so I left them in.\nAnd then A twenty four joined and I felt so\nlucky for that, And then Jonahill and Strong Baby joined Wow,\nand then Charlie joined the project and then we took\nit out in Amazon swipe rat.\nSpeaker 1 (33:48):\nWhat a lovely, lovely, incredible story. Just gives me whole\nlucky for the young people yeah out there who need\nto express themselves.\nSpeaker 3 (33:57):\nYeah, and it's like and also, so you know, I\ndidn't know anyone in the industry, and I think that's\nthe beauty of the Internet. Like I think also because\nI came up with like Broad City and Issa Ray\nand these people that did kind of come originally from\nlike YouTube or Instagram or right that or Twitter even\nsure that, you know, I think it kind of has\nopened these like Hollywood iron gates.\nSpeaker 1 (34:19):\nIt's amazing, right, they should never be iron you know,\nthey should never be ironed.\nSpeaker 3 (34:23):\nAnd yeah, but it is interesting because people bring that\nup a lot of like it's like to be come\nfrom the Internet, and I'm like, well, yeah, I don't know.\nIt just feels like another way to access this, like\nmany jobs.\nSpeaker 1 (34:31):\nI think for you guys, that's what it is right\nfor us, where the Internet didn't exist when we started,\nI mean literally didn't exist, Like it's impossible. Like my\nchildren do not understand. I keep trying to say, like\nit's crazy they didn't have it. They're like, well, do\nyou know, when you were looking at your iPad, I'm like, yeah, no, no.\nSpeaker 2 (34:48):\nA printed headshot.\nSpeaker 1 (34:49):\nThink about it exactly. That you that you spent so\nmuch money off of course, but I still did.\nSpeaker 3 (34:56):\nI paid an agent in New York and someone was like, so,\njust to be clear, you should never pay an agent\nto join.\nSpeaker 2 (35:03):\nThey're like, so you shouldn't pay.\nSpeaker 3 (35:04):\nAn agent unless you yourself are making I was like, okay.\nSpeaker 1 (35:09):\nThe right is like thank god, because I do think\nthere used to be. I mean I would have friends\nwho would go to like this class with that classroom.\nYou know what, there's so many weird almost scam things.\nOh I was so hard to get in.\nSpeaker 3 (35:22):\nI'm very easily scammed. I would say, I'm glad I\ncan say that, but I'm always like yeah, of course, yeah, yeah,\nyeah yeah. I did an acting class in like North Hollywood.\nThat midway through I was like, so I do think\nthat this is a front for the cartel. There is\nsomething did you ever watch Barry No.\nSpeaker 1 (35:46):\nTake class? And then there's a cartel and some kind\nof connection remember okay, well.\nSpeaker 3 (35:52):\nThat's always Valley okay, oh yeah, then that's where I\nwas really inspired.\nSpeaker 1 (35:58):\nI think you would like Barry because Barry has a\nreal darkness about it. Oh yeah, interest, you can feel\nthat in me. I mean really, you do have a\nlot of different things.\nSpeaker 2 (36:07):\nI will love it. Also still hater.\nSpeaker 1 (36:09):\nHe's amazing. Done, He's amazing, Yes, done, I mean so funny.\nSpeaker 3 (36:13):\nI need to watch more TV. I'm just kind of rewatching.\nSpeaker 1 (36:17):\nWhen you're doing TV, you have no time to watch TV.\nSpeaker 3 (36:19):\nNo, and sometimes watching it, my brain right now is like, oh,\nthey paid so much for that, you know.\nSpeaker 2 (36:25):\nI'm like that needle drop costs so much money.\nSpeaker 3 (36:28):\nI'm like, oh, there's the brand deal that actually was\nreally no, it's hard and especially.\nSpeaker 1 (36:33):\nWhen you know people people and I do try to\nwatch my friends work, but like I have to be\nin the right headspace because like you can't give up\nand just watch as a viewer because you know them\ntoo well.\nSpeaker 3 (36:44):\nIt's so it is totally where I had that with\nwith Mary Beth. At first, I would watch the show\nand in the first episode I was like, I think\nit was the first scene.\nSpeaker 2 (36:53):\nI was like, Oh, that's funny, it's it's us. She's\nvery funny, and oh she's brilliant.\nSpeaker 3 (36:57):\nAnd then in the second scene, I was like, oh\nmy god, like my girl, I'm like, oh, yeah, we're.\nSpeaker 1 (37:03):\nSo locked in and it's such a great character.\nSpeaker 2 (37:05):\nYeah.\nSpeaker 3 (37:05):\nI just thought that was too much because make Stalter,\nI've known her for a while and I'm like so\nproud of her and the show is so amazing, Like\nI know, make so it is it does take a second.\nSpeaker 2 (37:15):\nFor your brain. And then I was just like, yeah,\nshe's brilliant.\nSpeaker 1 (37:18):\nI mean you want to support and you want to\nwatch and you want to be able to talk to\nthem about it, but at the same time, it's just\na different part of your brain that you're using, I\nthink to watch. Let's talk about the show.\nSpeaker 2 (37:38):\nOkay, so there's this show.\nSpeaker 1 (37:39):\nYou're so much fun anything.\nSpeaker 3 (37:43):\nOkay, So I just background. The first time I watched\nX in the City in its entirety was actually when\nI got asked by Carolines to do that show. I\nwas so nervous and I was like, for some reason,\nI just think, now is the time I'm going to\nwatch it, because I had seen episodes and movies, but\nI was like, no, I'm going to do my like\nlocked in.\nSpeaker 2 (38:01):\nI'm watching it from start to finish.\nSpeaker 1 (38:03):\nEverything that's interesting.\nSpeaker 3 (38:04):\nAnd it like got me through that time of like\ninsane nerves and then also just like I was living\nin New York, so I really you know, it's there\nfantasy very and then I did it again right before\nI did Writer's Room for Overcompensating, and then when we\nfinished shooting, I did it again. Oh my god, I\ncan watch it and it is me and Mary best\n(38:25):\nthing of like, if we can't find something hot child\nin the city, let her it hot Letter.\nSpeaker 2 (38:31):\nI think it's the best episode.\nSpeaker 3 (38:33):\nWait, I think it's one of the best episodes in\nthe I really think it's one of the best episodes.\nSpeaker 1 (38:37):\nOkay, no one has ever said those words.\nSpeaker 3 (38:39):\nWait, really, I think it is expertly crafted and it\nliterally feels like New York in the summer.\nSpeaker 1 (38:45):\nWell, can I tell you the story behind it? I\nhaven't rewatched it yet, right, and there's certain ones where\nI'm like, I'm so curious how I'm going to feel\nabout this when I watch it. Yeah, we you know,\nsome summers, like this current summer in New York are\nlike so hot, like aggressively hot, like if you opened\nthe door, you're like kind of hit by a wave\nof heat. Some summer's not so much. We'd been filming.\n(39:06):\nWe would usually go to work in February we'd be freezing, freezing,\nthink old in our tiny dresses, trying to pretend that\nwe weren't trying not to see our breath. We would\nwork all through the summer and wrap in August, so\nwe would get the beautiful spring and then the hot\nand then we would go home and do award shows\nand whatever. Once that got rolling, right, yeah, but then\nwe go back in February and also freeze. So one\n(39:27):\nsummer it was one of those like one hundred plus\nall summer and we were just dying. I mean we'd\nhave to reapply and makeup so much and we'd just\nbe like, oh, deliriously hot and tired and whatever. So\nthey wrote the show Hot Child in the City for\nthe next summer.\nSpeaker 2 (39:40):\nNot hot, Oh it was cold.\nSpeaker 1 (39:43):\nNo, hell, it was funny. It isn't there like a\nhose situation or something. There's there's something.\nSpeaker 2 (39:55):\nBecause in the City ends on the rooftop.\nSpeaker 1 (39:57):\nNo, oh my god.\nSpeaker 3 (39:58):\nYes, yeah, iconic moment where you're And then it got hard.\nSpeaker 1 (40:03):\nBecause that was like one of the last scenes we filmed.\nSpeaker 2 (40:07):\nIt feels very and the energy is.\nSpeaker 1 (40:10):\nYes, the tar was so soft that we got tar\non all of our shoes. Oh and Cynthia and I.\nYou know you do right, you know how you get\nlike gifts or food or things. We had decided that\nI don't know why we didn't talk to locations before\nwe made the decision. We decided to bring an ice\n(40:31):\ncream truck. But we were home and roof and it\nwas a very tall building. Yes, so the ice cream\ntrucks down there, and they and their stairs because they've\ntaken the elevator for the lights and then like the\ntechnical stuff boxes. Yes, like up and up and up\nand up city.\nSpeaker 2 (40:53):\nIt is right. I think that's I think it is.\nSpeaker 1 (40:55):\nI mean, I haven't we watched it yet.\nSpeaker 2 (40:56):\nI wonder if I'm wrong. Someone will come.\nSpeaker 1 (40:58):\nFrom this is the joy. No, No, no one's going\nto come for you. Because what I've found in my\nrewatching is that people have different scenes that stand out\nto them from different episodes, and they might mesh them together.\nAnd that's cool. I'm trying to say, oh, yeah, it's\nabout your experience watching.\nSpeaker 2 (41:12):\nIt's the world.\nSpeaker 3 (41:13):\nIt's like, it's all and it's funny that this is\nthe episode we're talking about today, because I Charlotte stands\nout to me in this one, because it's so this\nstoryline is I.\nSpeaker 1 (41:24):\nNeed to know your thoughts because I didn't remember the\nstoryline at all.\nSpeaker 3 (41:27):\nIt's what I care about, aesthetics something, So talk about\na good hair day for you that brunch.\nSpeaker 1 (41:34):\nIt looked good, it looked good. I was into my hair. Yes,\nmy hair is finally growing out from the haircut they\nmade me get for the pilot.\nSpeaker 3 (41:41):\nNo, it's so cute the hair in the pilot. There's\nso many different takes on hair in that.\nSpeaker 1 (41:46):\nWell we didn't have our people yet.\nSpeaker 2 (41:48):\nWell, it's so interesting because Sara Jessica's brunette.\nSpeaker 1 (41:50):\nRight and kind of like how she was, you know,\nlike my color.\nSpeaker 3 (41:54):\nThe change from episode one to two is really a\nlot pilot.\nSpeaker 2 (41:58):\nThe pilot culture so.\nSpeaker 1 (42:02):\nRight. It's crazy, I think for her because she was\nin very much like a Broadway you know, like I'm\ngoing to be myself. I mean I thought she looked\namazing that way. I think Darren really had Candace in\nhis mind, right, and I don't. I think Sarah Jessica\nwas like, I'm not going to be playing Candace as\nCandace because this has to be my own character, right.\nSo there are certain things that she that she took\n(42:24):\nand she very much knew that world but then I\nthink there were other things where she was like, well,\nI'm want to be myself, right, But then Darren was like,\nwe're going to work on the hair. And then I've\nnever told anyone this, but since you're here and you're you,\nso my hair was you know, it's natural, pristine, pure\nuntouched color. When we begin at a certain point, I\nwant to say in second season, they come to me,\n(42:46):\nthe producers, John Melfi by name, and they were like,\nyour hairs just it's too dark. And I'm like, what\ndo you What do you mean? I'm the brunette. I'm\nthe only one you're like, and they said it's hard\nto light and I'm like, but why?\nSpeaker 2 (43:08):\nI know?\nSpeaker 1 (43:08):\nRight? So I had to go get my hair colored\nwith highlights. I had never done it. I knew nothing. Okay.\nI took a huge canvas, like who should I go to?\nWho's going to be subtle? I don't want some time?\nSpeaker 2 (43:21):\nYes?\nSpeaker 1 (43:22):\nYeah, ended I ended up there, but I didn't start there.\nHow do I know that you're on it?\nSpeaker 3 (43:28):\nBut I don't know like my grandma's middle name, but\nI know that you know. It's like that's unfortunately.\nSpeaker 1 (43:34):\nImportant, it's important information. My current colorists started as an\nassistant in New York. See you're there, so I go.\nI get these highlights. They are very subtle. In the beginning,\nthey weren't enough. So come whatever season, I want to\nsay third, we haven't gotten to it yet. At a\ncertain point, I have kind of freakishly weird highlights that\n(43:56):\nthen grow out because no one really told me, like\nyou have to go get them touched up. I didn't\nhave any gray then, right, I'm young, so like we\nwould be working okay, Charlotte a stripe, like a yellow stripe,\nand we were so tired. I don't think we noticed\nit because you know, I lived in ponytails at that point.\nIt was hot, right, and I've got like a yellow stripe.\n(44:16):\nNo one even tried to fix it or color send\nme back or whatever. It's pretty funny.\nSpeaker 3 (44:20):\nIt is like you can really, and I'm sure you're\nfeeling this. You can see the things that are shot\nat the beginning of production and at the end.\nSpeaker 1 (44:28):\nAnd when it looks a little different, and especially like\nwhen you lose your mind because you're not sleeping, like\nall the things.\nSpeaker 2 (44:35):\nSome of the choices, I'm like, damn, Okay, Benny was\nmanic here. I like that Yeah.\nSpeaker 3 (44:40):\nYeah, I'm so happy to hear that other people are\nworried about hair because I have to say I was\nlike very specific of like I don't want wigs and\nI want I want that.\nSpeaker 1 (44:52):\nTake. I agree. I always saw the boys and I'm\nalso the hairline. And also, no one touches their hair\nwhen they're wearing a wig. It just do.\nSpeaker 3 (45:01):\nIt doesn't have Yeah, people touch their hair all super\ncollege girl. I'm like, it should just feel so both\nHomes and Marybeth.\nSpeaker 2 (45:07):\nTo dye their hair.\nSpeaker 3 (45:08):\nThat was sweet of them, Yes, was very sweet. And\nthat was and we offered Wiggs. Of course, we're like,\nif you really don't want to, but I think also\nto me, I'm kind of like dying for someone to\ntell me that. I'm sure everyone's like, yeah, but I do.\nI kind of like it feels like you could just\nget into the character. Like there's something about seeing it\nin the mirror and that shift.\nSpeaker 1 (45:29):\nI think changing your hair.\nSpeaker 2 (45:30):\nYeah, like that feels so.\nSpeaker 1 (45:32):\nSee. My problem was that I didn't think Charlotte would\nhave highlights.\nSpeaker 3 (45:35):\nWell I agree with that. Oh she would never right,\nSo I was even seemed kind of crazy.\nSpeaker 1 (45:42):\nWell that was me kind of fighting for change because\nat a certain point they would say to me two\nor three different things that I would just be like, man,\nyou guys are killing me. They'd be like, they'd be like,\nCharlotte doesn't get angry. This was maybe for like two\nsolid years, and I was like, you guys.\nSpeaker 2 (46:00):\nIt's time, come on.\nSpeaker 1 (46:01):\nYeah, after all this, Yeah, all these.\nSpeaker 2 (46:04):\nDudes, I think it's about time that. Oh god, what\nwhat episode is that when you're friend like, where is he? Oh?\nSpeaker 1 (46:10):\nYeah, I mean fifteen I'm exhausted. Yeah, that's third season.\nThird season in my mind is when we really were\nfiring on all cylinders.\nSpeaker 3 (46:19):\nI mean it's really the show does know who it\nis immediately, I.\nSpeaker 1 (46:24):\nWill say, definitely. And that's the yeah it is.\nSpeaker 3 (46:27):\nI mean, what a delicious moment when you don't have\nany more direct to cameras. Oh that was crazy, but\nyou test oh yeah, because it's just like it just\ntakes away from for iconic actresses.\nSpeaker 1 (46:44):\nAnd also you can't be with each other. You're like\nlooking at a camera for some unknown reason. And when\nCarrie's talking to herself with voiceover but then has to\nlook at the camera.\nSpeaker 3 (46:55):\nNo, Jessica, well we say high flea bag, let's go\nevery now and then I'm like, oh, love back, It's\nmy favorite show.\nSpeaker 1 (47:12):\nI just want to say one more time that I'm\njust so impressed.\nSpeaker 2 (47:15):\nOh my god, thank you so much.\nSpeaker 1 (47:16):\nYes, and I also really desire that you meet Michael\nPatrick King.\nSpeaker 2 (47:20):\nOh I'm dying too, because I'm dying to meet my king.\nAre you kidding?\nSpeaker 3 (47:25):\nI care so much to talk to him about, right,\nthat would be You want to talk about an A\nD D Lent Yeah, I.\nSpeaker 1 (47:34):\nYes, because he used to teach a class that Lena\nWaite took for Show owners.\nSpeaker 2 (47:40):\nOh, oh my.\nSpeaker 1 (47:43):\nGod, I would love and she gives him so much.\nSpeaker 3 (47:46):\nShow knows that Scott King, who I worked on this with,\nthey know each other and only has the best things\nto say about him.\nSpeaker 2 (47:51):\nI love all my kings.\nSpeaker 1 (47:53):\nThe Kings are kings. Tell me the looks you want\nto talk about, and then we're going to talk about this.\nSpeaker 3 (47:58):\nI wore a big pony polo today for you because\nCharlotte worked at Ralph Lauren. I was an Abercrombie Greeter,\nso real recognized real, real recognized real. But so I\ntried to find the sweater with my stylist. We were\ntrying to find the original sweater that you wear when\nyou're in the bookstore.\nSpeaker 2 (48:13):\nI believe.\nSpeaker 1 (48:14):\nYes, it's a breast cancer, so I don't think they're\nmaking it anymore making it.\nSpeaker 2 (48:18):\nI love them to reissue.\nSpeaker 1 (48:19):\nI agree.\nSpeaker 2 (48:20):\nI'm trying to find these. I wanted to do a\nlittle tight.\nSpeaker 1 (48:22):\nLittle Oh my god, that would be awesome.

I love the Zach\nPo's and black swan. I would never want to own\nit though, because it was very high main but I\nloved it stressful, partly because I love Zach. Yeah, and\nZach had come to that day. He was at a\nweird time with this business. You know, He's been through\nup and down, up and down, and he came to\nthe day when we were our first day at the library,\nwhen we were all dressed and he was standing across\n(52:16):\nthe street with the crowds.\nSpeaker 2 (52:17):\nOh my god.\nSpeaker 1 (52:18):\nWe were like, is that Zach Oh, oh my god.\nCome he was so shy.\nSpeaker 3 (52:24):\nI love it.\nSpeaker 2 (52:24):\nHe just wanted to see.

I think\nbecause we took time away, we appreciate them. And also\nthere's like this interactive thing that happens. Like there's a\nscene this past season where Sarah, Jessica and I are\nwalking along. I'm wearing a flower dress and she's wearing\nblack and white and we're in the village. It was\nhot and there were maybe one hundred and fifty people\n(52:55):\non the other side of the street. Yeah, so amazingly\nhelpful and quiet, like like we would say to them,\nlike when we say rolling, can you guys be quiet?\nBut it was a tiny street. It wasn't even like\na big one, right or like an avenue or anything.\nSpeaker 2 (53:09):\nAnd they be hushed, Oh okay, that's amazing.\nSpeaker 1 (53:11):\nSo like you feeling like you're yes, you have to\ntune them out somehow to be the scene. It'srespectful and\nthat's part of it, you know, So you feel like, oh,\nthey do really love us and respect us and want\nto be part of it, and we're happy that they're there.\nSpeaker 2 (53:25):\nThat's so sweet.\nSpeaker 3 (53:26):\nNow.\nSpeaker 1 (53:27):\nOne time I remember this is when it started to escalate,\nand I remember being like, what it is happening? We\nwere when we first started, we had no security. Sometimes\nwe wouldn't even have like a green room area or\na safe area to go except our trailers, which might\nbe blocks away, you know when you fill me in\nthe city, right of course. And it was we would\nalways shoot as we would start at five am on Monday,\n(53:47):\nand each day would get longer and longer and longer\ntill Friday. We were working until the sun came up\nbecause we had to stop when the sun came up\nbecause we were outside. Right, So Friday night we have\nlike possibly a five block walk and talk, all four\nof us in the wee hours. They picked sixth Avenue\nin the village. Okay, Friday night.\nSpeaker 2 (54:06):\nOkay, someone was playing games.\nSpeaker 1 (54:09):\nAnd we have no security, and they put our chairs\nin the gutter along six right, so we're just supposed\nto sit there in our outfits eating. Yeah. At that point,\nthe McDonald's French fries are there Friday night.\nSpeaker 2 (54:23):\nWe're like literally.\nSpeaker 1 (54:26):\nLike we would time it, like is it time for\nthe McDonald's run. Where's the diet coke? I had my\nspecial diet coke, Crispy diet coke, not anymore but.\nSpeaker 2 (54:39):\nA yeah.\nSpeaker 1 (54:40):\nBut we had to get through five blocks, like up\nand down the curbs. You know, we're miked, of course,\nour mics are between our legs. Don't get me started.\nBut we also have to be loud. They're trying to\nboom us as well. We've got so much dialogue, you know,\nblah blah blah blah blah blah. But Michael Patrick wants\na perfect word perfect, no mess ups, no ad libs,\nand fast. Yeah okay, you know, like old school.\nSpeaker 3 (55:02):\nRight.\nSpeaker 1 (55:04):\nWe are having some struggles. Let me tell you, it's\na lot. So if we could get through one all\nthe way, it would be amazing, right. And I remember\nat one point we're going, it's going great. Right, We're\non cue blah blah blah blah blah. This car drives\nby and these guys are like sex and the city bitches.\nWe're like get it.\nSpeaker 3 (55:27):\nYeah, God, we were like we go.\nSpeaker 1 (55:31):\nSo then at a certain point, I remember like we\njust could. We just couldn't when people were coming and\nthey're drunk. It's like the village on Friday night. So\nwe went into this restaurant, you know, like the little\nopening like for when it's cold, like the door and\nthen the door.\nSpeaker 2 (55:43):\nWe were like.\nSpeaker 1 (55:44):\nHiding in there, and then they came out, like what's\ngoing We were like, could we please hide it here?\nAnd then next year we had we had security and yeah,\nthank god. Okay, but most of the time now it's great.\nBut I think that's because we have a greater appreciation,\nyou know, all of it now, right, we've had time away.\nThat's beautiful, understand it better, you know what I mean?\n(56:05):\nWe have We have had paparazzi get into fights with\neach other, which is never helpful.\nSpeaker 3 (56:11):\nThat.\nSpeaker 1 (56:11):\nYeah, but if they're not attacking us, we're cool.\nSpeaker 2 (56:14):\nYeah, exactly. It's take the photo and right.\nSpeaker 1 (56:17):\nRight, you guys, Benny's here and I'm with you.\nSpeaker 2 (56:22):\nI'm sorry and we knew.\nSpeaker 1 (56:27):\nSo we're going to stop now and we're going to\ncome back. Please join us for our actual recap of\nold Dogs, New Digs, New dicksy.\nSpeaker 3 (56:37):\nI was like, am I saying New Dicks?\nSpeaker 1 (56:42):\nIt's all right?

Twenty seven years after they debuted their now-legendary friendship on Sex and the City, Kristin Davis is finally revealing what kind of fashion advice she gets from Sarah Jessica Parker. The dynamic duo, who play Charlotte and Carrie in both the original show and its reboot, And Just Like That, always strive to be \"in sync,\" Davis says. \"I always have to check in with Sarah Jessica,\" the actress said on a new episode of her podcast, Are You A Charlotte?. \"I need to know what Sarah Jessica's gonna wear to our different events, because she might be wearing something that is, like, way dressier than what I pictured in my mind, and I hate to be out of sync with her.\" Kristin Davis and Sarah Jessica Parker on the set of 'And Just Like That.'. Getty Images With that in mind, Davis's takeaway from the duo's 30-year friendship probably won't surprise you: one can never be too dressed up\u2014whether on-camera or off. \"[Carrie] doesn't care if she's too dressed up, because it's more important that she look good in case she runs into Big,\" the actress explained. \"But in general, the important fact is she doesn't care if she's too dressed up.
