      "fundamental_analysis": "At the macro‑level, the current regime is defined by an ESG‑driven commodity supply constraint that has been institutionalised through the Brazilian soy moratorium, which the federal court recently reinstated (J54PXL0NV). The moratorium, enforced by 30 major exporters under EU pressure (J54PXL0NV), has kept soybean production on Amazon land in check while allowing overall cultivation to grow 344 % between 2009 and 2022 (J54PXL0NV). In 2024 Brazil exported 97 Mt of soybeans (J54PXL0NV), and the agreement has been linked to a 69 % decline in deforestation in monitored areas (J54PXL0NV). By limiting the supply of Amazon‑grown soy, the pact creates a structural constraint that can support commodity prices relative to a fully competitive market (J54PXL0NV).  \n\nConcurrently, U.S. monetary policy is in a regime of perceived loss of independence, highlighted by President Trump’s request for Fed Governor Lisa Cook to resign (IBGK2IRII). Market expectations that the Fed will cut rates in September stand at 79 % (IBGK2IRII), and the political uncertainty has already widened Treasury risk premia, which in turn can accelerate a USD depreciation (IBGK2IRII). A weaker dollar would lift commodity prices denominated in USD, reinforcing the price‑support effect of the soy moratorium (IBGK2IRII).  \n\nOn the global capital‑flow front, Japanese banks Mizuho and MUFG are pursuing overseas money‑manager deals as domestic growth stalls amid an ageing population (PA57YBYVQ). Their search for higher‑yield, non‑domestic assets is likely to increase demand for foreign‑currency‑denominated securities and could tighten global liquidity (PA57YBYVQ). Meanwhile, the Trump‑Putin summit in Alaska has the potential to reshape European security architecture and defense spending, which could boost demand for energy and metals (G47IHVUJK). A failed summit, however, could heighten risk sentiment and strengthen the dollar (G47IHVUJK).  \n\nBase case: soybean prices are expected to remain near 2024 levels or rise modestly as the moratorium stays in force and the USD continues to drift lower; the dollar is projected to weaken by 1–2 % over the next 12 months; Japanese capital outflows should rise by 3–5 % of AUM as banks seek higher yields. Upside scenario: Fed cuts materialise and the moratorium remains, supporting commodity prices and a further USD decline. Downside scenario: Fed hikes, moratorium is lifted or weakened, and the Trump‑Putin summit collapses, leading to a sharp dollar rally and compressed commodity spreads. Monitoring signals include Fed Jackson Hole remarks, Brazilian court rulings on the moratorium, and the outcome of the Alaska summit. Confidence in this view is medium‑high, given the clear causal links between policy actions and market channels, but the inherent uncertainty of geopolitical negotiations and political interventions introduces notable volatility.",
