      "summary": "The U.S. court’s ruling in U.S. v. Google bars exclusive contracts for Google Search, Chrome, Assistant and Gemini, while permitting the company to share search index and user‑interaction data with rivals. It leaves the paid‑default model intact, allowing Apple to auction the on‑ramp and Google to continue collecting fees. Investors reacted positively, with Alphabet and Apple shares rising, and regulators tout the decision as a win for competition. The order marks a shift toward treating search as regulated infrastructure rather than a monopoly.",
