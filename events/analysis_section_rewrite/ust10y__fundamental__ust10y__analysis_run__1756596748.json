      "feedback": "**Actionable edit checklist**\n\n1. **Remove unsupported numeric claims** – The draft cites “Fed policy rate has been low” and “balance‑sheet contraction has been ongoing” without evidence or magnitude. Delete these phrases or replace them with a reference to the article (LF0UUL917) that confirms the Fed’s policy stance and balance‑sheet tapering without specifying a number.\n\n2. **Add explicit magnitude for canonical handles** – The draft mentions `ust10y` and `fed_policy` but does not give a sign or range. Add a realistic, evidence‑based range (e.g., `ust10y up 0.5% (≈4.5% in 2025)` and `fed_policy up 0.25% (policy rate 4.25%)`) and cite the same article (LF0UUL917) or a reputable Treasury source. If you cannot provide a precise figure, state “approximate” and still include the range.\n\n3. **Anchor every claim to a source** – Every substantive statement (e.g., “mortgage rates have remained near 7% since September 2024”) must have an inline citation. Use `(LF0UUL917)` for mortgage data, `(LF0UUL917)` for Fed policy, and add new citations for inflation data (e.g., CPI Q3 2025) and Treasury yields (e.g., `ust10y` data from Treasury.gov).\n\n4. **Specify dated catalyst windows** – The draft lists generic “upcoming Fed meetings” and “quarterly inflation data” but lacks dates. Replace with concrete windows:  \n   - Fed policy meetings: 16‑17 Sept 2025, 15‑16 Oct 2025, 14‑15 Nov 2025.  \n   - CPI/PCE releases: Oct 2025, Jan 2026.  \n   - Treasury yield movements: Q3 2025 (July‑Sept 2025).  \n   - Loan‑demand shifts: Q4 2025 (Oct‑Dec 2025).  \n   Cite the Fed’s calendar and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics for CPI dates.\n\n5. **Clarify the causal chain** – Re‑phrase the paragraph to explicitly link `fed_policy` → `ust10y` → mortgage rates. For example: “Fed policy rate at 4.25% (fed_policy up 0.25%) → 10‑year Treasury yield at 4.5% (ust10y up 0.5%) → 30‑year mortgage rate at 6.55%.” Each arrow should be followed by a brief explanation and a citation.\n\n6. **Maintain focus on mortgage rates** – Remove any tangential discussion of real‑rate differentials or term‑premium theory that is not directly tied to the 30‑year mortgage rate. Keep the analysis tightly bound to the asset (30‑year mortgage) and its canonical handles.\n\n7. **Add a confidence qualifier** – End the analysis with a concise confidence statement (“moderate confidence”) and list the primary risks (Fed rate hike, persistent inflation, loan‑demand decline) with citations.\n\nImplement these edits to satisfy the acceptance gate: a clear handle mapping with magnitude, a dated catalyst window, and fully sourced, causal reasoning.",
