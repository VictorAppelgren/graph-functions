  "title": "The Briefing: Why Max Dowman can break a 20-year Premier League record",
  "description": "The big talking points from the Premier League weekend, including more passing into trouble and the grappling 'crackdown'",
  "content": "Welcome to The Briefing, where every Monday during this season, The Athletic will discuss three of the biggest questions to arise from the weekend\u2019s football in England.\n\nThis was the round of matches when a boy who should be getting his feet measured for a new pair of school shoes about now threatened to break a Premier League record several years older than he is.\n\nThe other talking points include \u2018the most dangerous pass in football\u2019 doing far more harm than good to Manchester City, and we also take a look at the referees\u2019 clampdown on rugby-tackling at set pieces and wonder if it will be here today and gone tomorrow.\n\nRecords come and go, but the identity of the Premier League\u2019s youngest goalscorer has remained unchanged for far longer than Everton\u2019s James Vaughan could have imagined when he came off the bench, at the age of 16 years and 270 days, and turned home a cross against Crystal Palace at Goodison Park.\n\nThat was more than two decades ago \u2013 April 10, 2005, to be exact. Or, to put it another way, over four years after Max Dowman, who made his senior debut for Arsenal aged 15 years, five months and 28 days on Saturday against Leeds United, was born.\n\nVaughan took the record from the evergreen James Milner, who had held it for two and a half years. As for Milner, he knocked Wayne Rooney off his perch, only two months after the Everton teenager scored that goal against Arsenal. It was Michael Owen of Liverpool and \u2013 a blast from the past \u2013 Tottenham\u2019s Andy Turner before all of that.\n\nIt seems strange to think that the youngest player to score in the Premier League since Vaughan that day is Federico Macheda, who was 17 years, seven months and 14 days when he got the winner for Manchester United against Aston Villa in April 2009.\n\nTo highlight how times change, in an interview with The Athletic\u2019s Oliver Kay a couple of weeks ago, Milner told a story about how he spent his first Leeds win bonus on buying \u201cmy own phone line, my own Sky (satellite television) box and my own TV\u201d for his bedroom at his parents\u2019 house. Dowman, you imagine, will already be well covered in that respect.\n\nDowman, who is still at secondary school but has been playing under-18 football since he was 13, could have become the Premier League\u2019s youngest ever player last season \u2013 a record held by his Arsenal team-mate Ethan Nwaneri \u2013 but for Premier League age restrictions which state that 15-year-olds can only play provided they are 15 by August 31 in the campaign in question.\n\nBut becoming the youngest Premier League goalscorer feels close to inevitable, given Dowman has almost the whole of the 2025-26 season to do it and the esteem in which he is held.\n\n\u201cThere is a kid here that has zero hesitation and is so convinced that, at 15, he can go and deliver, which I have never witnessed in my life,\u201d Mikel Arteta, Arsenal\u2019s manager, said. \u201cFor us, he brings joy, he brings emotion and something else that makes our jobs so great.\u201d\n\nIt was an impressive half-hour cameo from Dowman against Leeds, featuring flair, confidence, pace, swagger and ability. The only thing missing was a goal \u2013 and you sensed that the rest of the Arsenal players wanted the kid to score every bit as much as he did himself.\n\nAt one point, Declan Rice relinquished the opportunity to shoot in favour of passing to Dowman, and there was a split-second later on when you wondered whether the Arsenal players might hand the ball to the teenager after he won the penalty that became their fifth and final goal of the game.\n\nWith or without any additional help, that landmark goal is surely going to come.\n\nWhy do teams keep playing that pass?\n\nLast season, The Athletic called it \u201cthe most dangerous pass in football\u201d.\n\nWe were talking about the short, vertical ball that teams use to play out against a high press, generally from inside their own penalty area, often from a goal kick and typically from the \u2019keeper to a midfield pivot, all with the intention of finding the spare man.\n\nWell, it\u2019s still giving supporters heart palpitations, driving managers bonkers, and serving up goalscoring opportunities on a plate for the other side.\n\nTottenham Hotspur doubled their lead at the Etihad Stadium in Saturday\u2019s early game after Manchester City got themselves into a tangle, and that evening Viktor Gyokeres should have opened the scoring for Arsenal against Leeds following another mix-up.\n\nIt\u2019s a high-stakes game of risk and reward that some managers would rather not play at any stage of the match, let alone in the closing moments.\n\nDavid Moyes, the Everton manager, threw his arms in the air in a mixture of frustration and despair when, with nine minutes of normal time remaining at Elland Road in Everton\u2019s opening game of the season last Monday, goalkeeper Jordan Pickford chose to play a straight ball to the feet of the retreating Carlos Alcaraz, who had Ilia Gruev, the Leeds midfielder, chasing him down.\n\nAlcaraz tried to turn as he received midway inside his own half but slipped. Gruev collected the ball and, less than 20 seconds later, Leeds were awarded the penalty that decided the game.\n\nFor City, in contrast to Everton, this is a central component of how they play under Pep Guardiola, using \u2018bounce\u2019 passes to invite pressure and find the free man. The goalkeeper is key to that process, and perhaps we had taken for granted just how calm and capable Ederson was during those moments when it must feel like a net is closing around you.\n\nJames Trafford, a former City academy kid signed from Burnley in the summer, found himself in that scenario as Tottenham pushed five players forward in a narrow and high press that snared the home side\u2019s Nico Gonzalez.\n\nMany people will shake their heads at the image above and wonder how the City midfielder, with Pape Matar Sarr tightly marking him and four other Spurs players within 10 yards, is the right pass.\n\nYou can\u2019t help but question why Trafford didn\u2019t either knock the ball to John Stones on his right or, better still, go over the top of the press, instead of delivering such a telegraphed pass.\n\nAt the same time, Gonzalez didn\u2019t help himself. Typically from a goal kick, the midfielder receiving will arrive on the blindside of their marker, as with Rice in the images below from Arsenal\u2019s game against Chelsea last season.\n\nGonzalez, however, made himself a sitting duck, and Trafford failed to recognise the danger.\n\nAs the camera cut to Guardiola seconds after Palhinha made it 2-0 to Tottenham, the picture said it all.\n\nAs for Leeds, they could count themselves fortunate that Gyokeres never realised how much time he had after Martin Zubimendi smothered Anton Stach following another signposted straight pass, albeit this time from a defender rather than the goalkeeper.\n\nThe intention, presumably, was for Pascal Struijk to find Joe Rodon via Stach. But Zubimendi read the script, Stach arrived straight, and it was an awkward pass for the midfielder to try to make to Rodon under intense pressure.\n\nIt evoked memories \u2013 and not good ones \u2013 of the way last season\u2019s three promoted clubs (Ipswich Town, Leicester City and, in particular, Southampton) underestimated how difficult it is to execute those patterns against far better quality opponents than they had to deal with in the second-tier Championship.\n\nThe phrase \u201ca time and a place\u201d comes to mind.\n\nNo more holding on corners\u2026 but pushing is fine?\n\nAnd so the officials\u2019 crackdown on holding at set pieces is a real thing, and Calvin Bassey has become an early victim of the promise to punish players for what has been described as performing a \u201cnon-footballing action\u201d that impacts on an opponent\u2019s movement. In other words, a rugby tackle.\n\nFulham\u2019s Bassey ticked that box at Craven Cottage on Sunday when he wrestled Mason Mount to the floor at a Manchester United corner, with a VAR review of the first-half incident resulting in a penalty award. Bassey, much like Mount a few seconds earlier, didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on at the end of it all, although that didn\u2019t stop the central defender from protesting.\n\n\u201cI still think it\u2019s harsh,\u201d Bassey told Sky Sports afterwards. \u201cI understand why it\u2019s given. (But) I\u2019m trying to stay strong because I know the block is coming. And then I\u2019ve just sort of pulled him over my foot. If it\u2019s someone stronger, I don\u2019t think it looks so bad.\u201d\n\nAs it was, Mount was thrown to the floor like a rag doll.\n\nThat said, it seemed curious that Luke Shaw got away with doing something not dissimilar to the Fulham forward Rodrigo Muniz on the same corner just a few feet away from the Mount incident. The explanation given was that Bassey committed his foul before Shaw did.\n\nThe question with anything like this is whether a stricter application of the rules is here to stay or just a fad that, much like a New Year\u2019s resolution, starts promisingly but quickly falls away.\n\nGrappling at corners and free kicks had been out of control for a while, to the point that the sight of defenders not even looking for the approaching ball while holding onto an opponent with both hands had almost become normalised.\n\nThe key for everyone \u2013 managers, players and supporters \u2013 is consistency around referees\u2019 decision-making, and from Fulham\u2019s point of view, they got a raw deal against United yesterday because of an incident that went against them in the second half of the game.\n\nReplays showed that Leny Yoro, the United defender, pushed Bassey in the lead-up to United opening the scoring, yet the goal was allowed to stand.\n\nPushing is clearly different to holding, or grappling, but it\u2019s a foul all the same.\n\u2022 Only one place to start: Newcastle versus Liverpool on Monday night. Always a lively fixture, this latest instalment promises to be compelling viewing given the absence of Alexander Isak. His name will dominate the build-up after being at the centre of a messy and bitter transfer saga involving the two clubs.\n\u2022 It\u2019s the second round of the Carabao Cup this week, the entry point for the 11 Premier League clubs not involved in European competition this season. Manchester United travel to Blundell Park, the home of Grimsby Town, on Wednesday. Grimsby are currently fifth in League Two and unbeaten in the fourth tier after five games. In short, it\u2019s the last sort of fixture United need right now. Wolves and West Ham \u2014 the bottom two in the Premier League after the season\u2019s first two weekends \u2014 would probably say the same about their meeting at Molineux tomorrow.\n\u2022 Maybe we cursed Celtic and Rangers in last week\u2019s Briefing by talking about a \u201csteady improvement\u201d in Scottish clubs\u2019 performances in Europe in recent years. Celtic promptly drew 0-0 at home against FC Kairat in their Champions League qualification play-off, while Rangers pressed the self-destruct button and lost 3-1 to visitors Club Brugge. Celtic\u2019s second leg in Kazakhstan tomorrow still looks winnable, but it\u2019s hard to say the same thing about Rangers in Belgium a day later.\n\u2022 Let\u2019s not dwell on Crystal Palace\u2019s Europa League/Conference League saga any longer. The bottom line is that their fans have waited a long time for European football, so it would be a crying shame if this proves to be a one-week-and-done affair. On Thursday, last season\u2019s FA Cup winners are in the Norwegian city of Fredrikstad for the second leg of their Conference League play-off tie, holding a slender 1-0 lead. Palace will be hoping this isn\u2019t the last time those supporters get their passports stamped this season.",

  "summary": "The Briefing, The Athletic's weekly news program, focuses on three key issues in football, including why Max Dowman is threatening to break a 20-year Premier League record, several years older than he is. Dowman, who made his senior debut for Arsenal at 15 years, five months and 28 days old, could break the record for the youngest Premier League goalscorer in the history of the league. James Vaughan, who held the record at 16 years and 270 days ago, was the youngest player to score in the Premier League since then. The Briefing also discusses the referees' clampdown on rugby-tackling at set pieces and the potential for teams to continue playing the dangerous pass used by Manchester City.",

      "text": "After Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly, there is no hiding from who appears to be next off the Hale End conveyor belt.\nMax Dowman\u2019s involvement during pre-season should not have come as a surprise to anyone who follows Arsenal.\nManager Mikel Arteta spoke about the 15-year-old in press conferences earlier this year, and made public his plans for the England Under-17 international to travel to Singapore and Hong Kong.\nWhat may be surprising, however, is the ease with which the attacker has translated his exploits in youth football to playing against senior pros.\nHis introduction against Milan on July 23 at the Singapore National Stadium was a clear indicator of his talent, but the skilful and powerful run that resulted in a penalty against Newcastle United four days later at the same venue showed his confidence.\nHe won another penalty in his first senior game at the Emirates against Villarreal on August 5, but it was his ability to repeatedly dribble past his man to get shots off and crosses into the box that really caught the eye.\nIt was reminiscent of Dowman\u2019s first appearance at the Emirates Stadium, an FA Youth Cup tie against Manchester United Under-18s in February. That night, there were times when he was triple-marked. Even so, he still found time to pick up the ball in his own half, drive up to the United penalty area, twist the opposition inside out to win a penalty, and then convert it.\nHe was playing three years above his age. By the end of the tour to Asia with the first team, the 15-year-old was being double-marked by Spurs\u2019 Djed Spence and Son Heung-min in Hong Kong in the first north London derby on foreign soil on July 31.\n\u201cIt is special,\u201d Arteta said after Dowman\u2019s performance against Newcastle. \u201cObviously, what he\u2019s done today against this team in the time that he had on the pitch is something certainly not common to witness for a 15-year-old.\n\u201cWe are extremely happy to have him. I think again the environment that he\u2019s around in, his family, the people at the club, and around the academy as well (are) super helpful because they put him into this position so early in his journey, having a real chance and a real presence when he plays for the first team.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nAfter his performance against Villarreal, the Arsenal manager added, \u201cHe continues to impress, without a doubt. The impact he had in the game again today, the efficiency that he shows in every attack and action, it\u2019s incredible. Again, he deserves to have chances, and if he continues like this, let\u2019s see what happens.\u201d\nArteta\u2019s use of Dowman on the right wing has made sense. As with Nwaneri last season, that is an area of the pitch that allows attacking players to get repetitive actions to showcase what they are good at. In Dowman\u2019s case, it is showing his initial burst of pace over five yards and sustaining it over a distance that makes it a genuine challenge to keep up with him. From there, he can either take on the last line of defence on the dribble or have a shot.\nThose strides, paired with his close control, were also an issue for Europe\u2019s best teenagers to deal with this year.\nAway in Albania for the Under-17 European Championship in May, he came up against Belgium midfielder Nathan de Cat. The 6ft 2in (188cm) 16-year-old, now 17, made 30 senior appearances for Anderlecht last season, scoring four goals and assisting another four. The pair had an intense midfield battle, each coming out on top in different moments, but to see Dowman survive against a player of that stature was encouraging.\nWhen it comes to his shooting, his ability off both feet sets him even further apart.\nWatching him for the first time in person, in October 2024 against Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Youth League, it was hard to distinguish which foot was the strongest.\nThat afternoon, he started the game on the bench, but was brought on after half an hour to play on the right wing. Towards the end of the first half, he latched onto a speculative ball forward and curled a well-struck left-footed effort just wide.\nBy the hour mark, he was hitting a strike just as firm off his right foot, which would have nestled in the top corner if not for the goalkeeper\u2019s quick reactions.\nAs was the case against Milan on the recent tour, it wasn\u2019t what he did in the final third that was the first impression. Instead, it was his awareness to let the ball run across his body followed by quick feet that saw him fouled within seconds of his introduction.\nDowman\u2019s age makes his situation different from almost everyone who has come before him.\nAdvertisement\nNwaneri was 15 years and 181 days when he became the Premier League\u2019s youngest player in September 2022, but he did not play back-to-back games until he was 17 last season.\nArteta cited this as the most similar situation to Dowman\u2019s he has seen, but added, \u201cIt was a different stage. With Max, it\u2019s been so fast. Even last year, when he was training with us, he was doing this kind of thing in training, and now he\u2019s doing it in the game consistently. So the three or four games that he\u2019s played, he\u2019s managed to impact and have big moments in the game.\u201d\nNwaneri\u2019s first pre-season involvement came as a 16-year-old, when he featured away at Nuremberg, but not on the actual tour in the United States. At Barcelona, Lamine Yamal made his first-team debut at 15 years and 289 days in April 2023, but like Nwaneri, this was his only first-team appearance that season. He did play 37 La Liga games as a 16-year-old the following season, though.\nGoing further back, Cesc Fabregas and Jack Wilshere were both months past their 16th birthdays when Arsene Wenger gave them debuts in 2003 and 2008 respectively. Like Yamal, their first spells of regular football did not come until the seasons that followed.\nLionel Messi was 16 and four months old when he played in a Barcelona friendly against Porto, the inaugural game in their Estadio do Dragao in October 2003. It was not until a year later, at 17 and four months, that Messi made his competitive debut against Espanyol.\nWith little precedence for blooding a 15-year-old into a first-team environment, care will be needed.\nAsked how realistic Premier League involvement would be for Dowman this season, Arteta said: \u201cLet\u2019s see how it goes. Let\u2019s go into Saturday (against Athletic Club), into the break as well. He needs a little break because he hasn\u2019t had any holidays really. So, in the next few days, he\u2019s going to have a break, which I think he needs. And then, following the week, he\u2019ll be ready again to go.\u201d\n(Top photo: David Price/Arsenal FC via Getty Images)"

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of Liverpool vs Bournemouth in the first match of the 2025-26 Premier League season\nThe 24th season of James Milner\u2019s Premier League career began with a knock on the door of his hotel room at 5.15am on June 2, just eight days after the previous campaign had ended.\nHe was on a golfing trip in America with a group of friends, but while the others were sleeping off their jet lag before the day\u2019s play, Milner and fitness coach Adrian Lamb were ready for work.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe 2025-26 season starts here,\u201d Lamb told him with a grin \u2014 and so it did, a gruelling gym session representing day one of a 10-week build-up to the new campaign for the Premier League\u2019s oldest player.\nThe Brighton & Hove Albion midfielder and Lamb go back a long way \u2014 to the summer of 2004, when the latter was taken aback by the sight of an 18-year-old Milner forcing his way to the front of the pack during a running drill on day one at Newcastle United under Sir Bobby Robson, an unexpected rival to the late Gary Speed\u2019s crown as the king of pre-season fitness testing.\nMilner\u2019s Premier League story goes back even further than that: as a 16-year-old, straight out of school, suddenly thrust into the first-team squad at Leeds United, training alongside his heroes, making his debut and then becoming the Premier League\u2019s youngest goalscorer nine days before his 17th birthday while still living with his parents.\nAnd look at him now, more than two decades later, five months short of his 40th birthday, 15 matches away from Gareth Barry\u2019s record of 653 Premier League appearances, counting down the days towards Brighton\u2019s opening game at home against Fulham on Saturday. He has come back for more despite spending most of last season on the sidelines, worrying that he might not even be able to walk again \u2014 never mind play again \u2014 after complications arising from knee surgery left him unable to move his foot for months.\nPre-season was very different in those days at Leeds and Newcastle in the early and mid-2000s. \u201cYou didn\u2019t get the balls out for the first two weeks,\u201d Milner says. \u201cThese days, you get your fitness from your football sessions on the pitch. Those sessions are intense, but it\u2019s a lot more ball-oriented as opposed to that base running on beaches and in forests, doing drills until someone was sick.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIn those days, there was one fitness coach (at a club), two maximum. These days, you come in for pre-season and the first two days are pure testing: running tests, jumping tests, nutrition tests, blood tests, fat tests, balance tests, concussion tests, strength in your legs, your teeth, your eyes.\u201d\nIn his time at Liverpool, Milner was famed for winning the pre-season \u201clactate test\u201d \u2014 a brutal exercise which tests players\u2019 aerobic endurance and measures their lactic acid level \u2014 year after year.\nHaving joined Brighton two years ago, he is no longer allowed to do some of the exercises \u2014 not to spare his younger team-mates\u2019 blushes but \u201cbecause of my age and because they\u2019re looking after me\u201d. \u201cBut I\u2019m still covering a good distance when I play,\u201d he says. \u201cThe high-intensity running and top speed have come down a little, but I can still get about the pitch. And they say as you get older, the first couple of yards are in the head.\u201d\nDid he ever question whether he wanted to carry on after last season\u2019s frustrations? Was there not a part of him that was starting to feel that, like Danny Glover\u2019s world-weary cop in the Lethal Weapon movies, he was \u201cgetting too old for this s**t\u201d?\n\u201cI always wanted to carry on,\u201d he tells The Athletic at Brighton\u2019s training ground. \u201cBut there were major doubts about whether I could. For a long time, I couldn\u2019t lift my foot up. That\u2019s probably enough for most people to have doubts about me. I can\u2019t really explain the feeling of trying to lift your toes, straining with everything you\u2019ve got, and nothing is moving.\n\u201cSean Duggan (Brighton\u2019s physio) did an incredible job looking after me all the way through. But with me not being able to lift my foot, we were both thinking it could be, \u2018That\u2019s it. Finished. Thanks for coming.\u2019\n\u201cBut we broke it down, took the time, worked hard to get the foot moving again and got the knee as strong as we could. It was a monumental effort on Sean\u2019s part to get me fit to come on at Spurs (in the final game of last season), and then the work has continued over the summer. I had literally a week off and then, from the start of June, I was straight on it again, trying to get ready for the season. Nothing changes.\u201d\nNothing changes? It is tempting to say that, since 2002, Milner has been the one constant in an English game that has changed almost beyond recognition. That 2002-03 season was the last time David Beckham played in the Premier League, the last Manchester City played at Maine Road, the last Chelsea spent under the ownership of Ken Bates before their history \u2014 and the entire ownership model in English football \u2014 was transformed by the Roman Abramovich takeover.\nAdvertisement\nIt is extraordinary to think that a player who played under a manager born in 1933 (Robson) is now working for one born in 1993 (Fabian Hurzeler). Likewise to think that a player who sat on the Leeds bench alongside former England goalkeeper Nigel Martyn (born 1966) for his Premier League debut in November 2002 \u2014 and immediately came up against a West Ham United full-back born in 1963 (Nigel Winterburn) \u2014 now shares the Brighton dressing room with a \u00a330million ($41m) centre-forward born in 2007 (Charalampos Kostoulas).\n\u201cMad, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Milner says. \u201cWe were working it out the other day and 15 of the lads here (Brighton) weren\u2019t even born when I made my debut \u2014 something daft like that. There are lads I played with at the start of my career whose sons I\u2019m now playing with or against: (Bournemouth forward) Justin Kluivert, I played with his dad (Patrick) at Newcastle; I played with (Derby County midfielder) Bobby Clark at Liverpool and played with his dad (Lee) at Newcastle; (Brighton winger) Tommy Watson\u2019s girlfriend is (former Leeds full-back) Ian Harte\u2019s daughter.\u201d\nThis season might even bring him up against Arsenal\u2019s 15-year-old prodigy Max Dowman, who was born on the final day of 2009 \u2014 by which time Milner was already an England international with more than 250 senior appearances to his name at club level. Without wishing to make him feel even older, Milner was probably already in his thirties at Liverpool, retired from international football, by the time Dowman first heard his name or found his image in a packet of football stickers.\nIt is one thing to break through early. It is quite another, having done so, to stay on the Premier League treadmill for 23 seasons and counting. It is often suggested that modern sports science has normalised longevity, but it isn\u2019t really true. Players such as Cristiano Ronaldo (40), Luka Modric (39), Lionel Messi (38) and indeed Milner are freakish exceptions.\nShould Milner appear in the Premier League after his 40th birthday in January, he will be only the fifth outfield player to do so and the first since Ryan Giggs and Kevin Phillips, both of whom were born in 1973. Greater professional standards and advances in sports science might have helped to increase players\u2019 longevity, but set against this is the increasing speed and physical requirements of the modern game, which in many cases seems to shorten careers at the highest level, particularly among early starters.\nMilner puts his longevity down to a combination of good fortune \u2014 he was an outstanding athlete from an early age \u2014 good influences (starting with his parents), good habits and a willingness to make sacrifices. As a teenager breaking into the first team at Leeds, he decided alcohol would not be part of his life. His unstinting dedication to his trade has at times seen him described as boring.\nSo many hugely talented players fall victim to pitfalls of one type or another early in their careers. Even among those who make it to the highest level, many seem jaded by the time they reach their late twenties or early thirties. You don\u2019t have to think too hard to come up with examples of those who have either lacked a Milner-type mentality in the first place or who, whether sated by success and riches or weighed down by negativity, seem to have lost it somewhere along the way.\nHe is diplomatic when it comes to other players\u2019 career trajectories \u2014 \u201cevery situation is different and everybody is different\u201d \u2014 but as a senior professional, dating back to his days at Liverpool and even before that at City, he has often felt compelled to take young players aside and spell out both the size of the opportunity and the number of pitfalls that lie ahead.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to want to do it,\u201d says Milner, whose drive was evident when working with him on his book about life as a footballer in 2019. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to have the love for it and the drive to do your best every day, season after season. The drive is probably the one reason I\u2019m still playing. That thing of, \u2018I don\u2019t really feel like it today\u2019, I\u2019ve never really had that.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not easy when you\u2019re injured and you\u2019re in the gym every day, doing your rehab, or when you\u2019re getting up stupidly early on holiday to train. But if I didn\u2019t have the drive to do that, it would probably be time to retire.\u201d\nAs a 16-year-old playing and scoring for Leeds in the Premier League in 2002, Milner was earning \u00a370 a week and still required to perform all the duties of a first-year apprentice \u2014 \u201ccleaning the first-team players\u2019 boots, picking their dirty kit up off the dressing-room floor\u201d.\nWith his first win bonus, he went out and bought \u201cmy own phone line, my own Sky (satellite television) box and my own TV\u201d for his childhood bedroom. It is a world away from the scenario faced by the Premier League\u2019s teenage stars today, many of them multi-millionaires while still in their teens.\nIn some ways, Milner feels the integration from academy to Premier League is smoother these days for young players such as Ethan Nwaneri, 18, and Dowman at Arsenal and 16-year-old Rio Ngumoha at Liverpool.\n\u201cThey\u2019re having proper training sessions at academies three times a week from eight years of age, playing tournaments all over the world in front of big crowds, getting used to it,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is more natural in some ways. There\u2019s all the support they have in academies these days. They\u2019re treated as professionals from a very early age.\n\u201cBut the money, the social media, the hype\u2026 I don\u2019t think any of that makes it easier. It becomes so easy to get ahead of yourself. It\u2019s all thrust on them so early and there\u2019s no hiding place for them, just because they\u2019re amazing at football and playing first team at 16, 17, 18.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cEverything is so public. There is talk about having cameras in dressing rooms, which for me is an absolute no-go. That can\u2019t happen.\n\u201cSome people are wise beyond their years, like (Brighton\u2019s 20-year-old midfielder) Jack Hinshelwood, but you have others who might be equally talented who have had a different upbringing and different journey and they\u2019re expected to grow up in public and somehow not make mistakes.\n\u201cThey\u2019re on holiday, trying to get away from the pressure of it, and people are there with camera phones, recording their every move. And it\u2019s going to grind you down. Then you get criticised, which is obviously a lot harder to take. And maybe it can get to that point where, for lads who have had all that from the start of their career, with that buzz and that energy, it starts to become a bit tiresome.\n\u201cAnd then if you\u2019re not getting a proper break in the summer, that becomes even harder. That\u2019s another topic in terms of how many games people are playing. Every other year, players should get a full rest in the summer. But instead, it\u2019s more and more games, less rest. With the Club World Cup and all of that now, it\u2019s getting ridiculous.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re expecting players to play from 18 to 32/33, when are they going to get a break? Everyone will burn out. It\u2019s going to become completely impossible.\u201d\nIf there had been no way back last season, if the doctors had told him it was over, would Milner have been able to make peace with that?\n\u201cOne hundred per cent, yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think it would be the ideal way to finish any career, but I\u2019ve been incredibly fortunate. I\u2019ve played two careers, really. Some people are lucky enough to get eight or 10 years in the Premier League. I\u2019ve had\u2026 what\u2019s this? Season 24? Last season was unfortunate, but what have I got to moan about? You get to 34, 35 and you start to think, \u2018If it ends at any point now, I can\u2019t complain\u2019.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHe was extremely grateful for the offer of a new one-year deal at Brighton at the end of that injury-ravaged campaign. He doesn\u2019t know whether this one will be his last. \u201cBut if it is \u2014 maybe, maybe not \u2014 it would be nice for it to be more positive than last year was,\u201d he says.\nWhat does he still hope to achieve? \u201cIt\u2019s about being part of it and contributing to the team,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s always been it for me, to help drive the team and the club forward. I came here because I can see this club going places. This club is in a great position. We\u2019ve got some great young players, a great young manager.\n\u201cThe club\u2019s journey over the past 20 years or so has been incredible and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s beyond the realms of possibility to get into Europe again or win a trophy this season. There\u2019s so much potential here. We just need to keep pushing forward.\u201d\nIs breaking Barry\u2019s record something he thinks about? \u201cOnly every time I do an interview and I get asked about it!\u201d he says. \u201cI keep hearing it\u2019s 15 games (to equal it). Fifteen games when you\u2019re 21 doesn\u2019t sound like much. But this time last year, I started the first three league games and then I was out for nine months. I might play every game this year or I might not get anywhere near it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of those: if I get it, fantastic, but to be honest I would rather be remembered for winning every domestic trophy with two clubs (Liverpool and City) or winning the Champions League (Liverpool) or scoring in the Premier League for Leeds when I was 16.\u201d\nMilner has had plenty of time to think about what might come next.\nAt one point, he doubted whether he would be tempted into management or coaching, but he has earned his UEFA B and A Licence qualifications and, though he is yet to do the Pro Licence, he spent his time on the sidelines last season smartly, working closely with Hurzeler and his staff on an informal basis \u201cto give me a taste for it\u201d.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t doing any actual coaching on the pitch,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I did a lot of stuff with the manager and the coaches \u2014 game prep, videos, stuff like that. I learned a lot from being in the meeting rooms and the manager was open to me giving my opinion on certain things. That was great, and hopefully I was bringing some value from his point of view as well.\n\u201cWhenever I do hang up my boots, I would still need that competition, whether that\u2019s in football, out of football, management, whatever other options there might be. I would fancy running a marathon or a triathlon or Hyrox, which combines running with sledge pulls and things like that.\n\u201cBut whenever it is, I think a little break will be on the cards. It\u2019s been quite intense for 24 years or whatever, so I\u2019ll want to spend some time with my family.\u201d\nThe 24th season of Milner\u2019s Premier League career will involve a new shirt number: the No 20, which he will wear in honour of his former Liverpool team-mate Diogo Jota, who, along with his brother Andre Silva, died in a car crash in northern Spain on July 3.\n\u201cI loved the guy, absolutely loved him,\u201d Milner says. \u201cLoved him as a player, loved him even more as a team-mate and a friend, absolutely loved him. Carlos (Baleba) wanted to change his number (Brighton's rising-star midfielder now has the 17 shirt), so the No 20 became available and it felt like the right thing for me to do. Every day when I put my kit on, I\u2019ll think of him.\n\u201cWe were only together at Liverpool for three seasons and you might not have thought we had much in common \u2014 different nationalities, very different ages \u2014 but we hit it off immediately. Maybe it was because we were both so stubborn. Honestly, people say I\u2019m stubborn, but Jots could give me a run for my money.\n\u201cHe was an unbelievable guy, one of my favourite team-mates I\u2019ve had in all my time playing. He was always up for a laugh, always winding people up. He was one of those you could put in any corner of the dressing room, next to any other player, and he would click with them straight away.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThey messaged each other the night before the tragedy. \u201cNothing major, just checking in and asking each other how things were going,\u201d Milner says.\nHe was at Brighton\u2019s training ground when the terrible news began to circulate on social media that Thursday morning. \u201cSomeone asked, \u2018Is that true?\u2019 and I didn\u2019t know at that point, obviously,\u201d he says. \u201cI messaged someone at Liverpool to try to find out and\u2026 just horrific. Not many tougher days than that.\u201d\nLiverpool arranged a charter flight to take a group of players to Portugal the next day for the funeral. Milner was determined to be there even if it meant a five-hour drive from England's south coast after training. In his attempt to make it to Merseyside, he ended up snarled in traffic on the M25, so he flew out from Luton instead. He is hugely grateful to Brighton, as well as to Liverpool, for allowing him to pay his respects.\nThe footage of Jota\u2019s former team-mates arriving in his hometown of Gondomar late that evening, before the funeral the following day, is harrowing. Milner describes the whole experience as \u201cdevastating\u201d but says he felt \u201cprivileged to be able to pay my respects with the other lads and to spend a small amount of time with his wife and his family, which was important. It\u2019s horrible to see a family go through that, but it\u2019s the least we can do, to show them we\u2019re there for them.\u201d\nMilner looks and sounds like someone who still cannot believe what has happened. He keeps coming back to the same words: \u201cdevastating\u201d, \u201chorrific\u201d.\nAt the same time, Jota\u2019s death has brought certain things into sharp context, about how fragile life \u2014 and within that, something like a football career \u2014 can be.\n\u201cIt goes back to what we were saying about the season and life in general, about enjoying it, getting what you can out of it,\u201d Milner says. \u201cAs you go through life, you get these reminders that every day is precious. You only get one go at a football career. You only get one go at everything, so you\u2019ve got to give it everything you\u2019ve got.\u201d\n(Photo: Visionhaus/Getty Images)"

      "text": "\u201cNo 7! No 7! Can we have your shirt please?\u201d\nThose high-pitched cries felt like the soundtrack to the evening at a stadium on the outskirts of London on Saturday as a group of young children constantly pleaded with Arsenal\u2019s right winger to hand over his jersey.\nThe venue was Meadow Park, home of non-League Boreham Wood, and the player in question was Max Dowman.\nAdvertisement\nPlaying three years above his age, Dowman was making his FA Youth Cup debut against Queens Park Rangers \u2013 a goalscoring debut, too. In September, he made his UEFA Youth League debut against Atalanta and, at the age of 14 years, eight months and 19 days, became the youngest player ever to score in the competition. In between, Dowman made his first appearance for Arsenal\u2019s under-21s \u2013 a boy against men.\nPerhaps there would have been a Premier League debut as well this season but for the rules and regulations getting in the way. You need to be at least an under-16 (15 years of age by August 31, 2024 for the current season) to appear in the English top flight, which isn\u2019t the case everywhere else. In theory, Dowman could play in La Liga now.\n\u201cAt the moment, with all the legislation, there are restrictions for your age \u2014 something that in other countries you don\u2019t even mention,\u201d Arsenal\u2019s manager Mikel Arteta said this week when asked about the possibility of Dowman getting some first-team minutes. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see. But he\u2019s taking very fast steps because every time you put him at a different level he overcomes that hurdle pretty quickly.\u201d\nGet ready to feel old. Dowman was born in 2009 \u2014 just. He celebrated his 15th birthday on New Year\u2019s Eve, which means \u2014 and this part of his story is easy to overlook when you focus on his football journey \u2014 that he is currently in Year 10 at school and won\u2019t be sitting his GCSE exams until the summer after next. It will be another two years before Dowman can drive a car in England and three years before he can buy a beer.\nIn other words, he is a gifted young footballer who plays with a maturity beyond his years but, ultimately, is still a teenage kid \u2014 and that adds an extra layer of responsibility to how you write about him.\nThose bursts of speed with the ball glued to his boot, his lovely knack of dropping his shoulder and gliding in off the right flank to shoot (or score, in the case of Saturday), the eye-of-the needle passes that he saw and you didn\u2019t, and the way that he receives so naturally with the outside of his left foot before spinning away from opponents\u2026 it would be easy to make comparisons with players X, Y and Z. But it would also be silly to do that.\nWhat we can say without getting carried away is that Dowman has huge potential and that seeing him running with the ball on Saturday, leaving a trail of QPR players in his wake at times, took your breath away \u2014 even if you were supporting Arsenal\u2019s opponents.\n\u201cOh, Jesus,\u201d said the voice in the row in front as Dowman set off on another of his trademark surges in the second half.\nAdvertisement\nRemarkably, Dowman trained alongside him as a 14-year-old at Arsenal \u2014 Gabriel Jesus, that is. Indeed, at an age when his peers are kicking a ball about in the playground before double maths, Dowman has been wowing Arsenal\u2019s first-team squad with his ability.\n\u201cSome of the things that he does in training are unbelievable,\u201d Arteta said on Tuesday, after Dowman took part in Arsenal\u2019s session prior to their Champions League game against Dinamo Zagreb. \u201cHe\u2019s a player with a huge talent.\u201d\nReporting twice a week to London Colney (the home of Arsenal\u2019s under-18s, under-21s and first team) as part of a bespoke development programme that includes one-to-one sessions, Dowman has been around Arteta\u2019s squad for a while now.\nAt some point in the near future \u2014 and it\u2019s surely just a question of when \u2014 the accelerated pathway that Dowman is on will culminate in a senior debut at Arsenal and see him join up permanently with Ethan Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly, who are still young enough to play in the FA Youth Cup this season but have both flown the under-18 nest to become regular members of the first-team squad.\nThat isn\u2019t hyperbole in relation to Dowman. It\u2019s just a logical progression for someone who featured for Arsenal under-18s when he was 13 and became the club\u2019s youngest-ever under-21 player at the age of 14. In fact, pretty much from the moment he walked through the door at Arsenal at the age of four, Dowman has been playing in advance of his years. Even at international level, Dowman plays two years above his age for England Under-17s.\nWithout seeing Dowman play, the natural assumption would be that he is a powerful early developer, as is often the case with teenagers who are fast-tracked through the academy age groups. Dowman is that to a point \u2014 he\u2019s a superb athlete, for sure \u2014 but he doesn\u2019t thrive just because of his physicality. His acceleration is a big asset but his exceptional technical ability, and the intelligence with which he plays and sees the game, really stand out.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cPlease go online and check out this kid,\u201d Rio Ferdinand said on his YouTube channel in November. \u201cHe was 14, I saw him coaching 18 and 19-year-olds on the pitch when he was playing with them. Bad player (which in this context actually means good player).\u201d\nThose internet showreels of Dowman are jaw-dropping at times, especially given the age disparity, and give you an insight into what all the fuss is about. He\u2019s capable of playing in multiple positions (many in the game think Dowman will end up more centrally, as a No 8 or a No 10), has a lovely range of passing, dribbles beautifully and scores freely.\nAt the same time, there\u2019s nothing quite like seeing a player perform live. You get to take in the bigger picture that the video highlights don\u2019t show, including how a player interacts with his team-mates and his coach, the positions they take up on the pitch when they don\u2019t have the ball at their feet, and how they deal with moments of adversity.\nEarly in the second half on Saturday, after Dowman skipped away from an opponent on the touchline, another QPR player came across to make a robust challenge from the side. It was a fair tackle \u2014 he took the ball \u2014 but it was full-blooded too and he cleaned Dowman out in the process.\nOne of the other QPR players revelled in the moment \u2014 something that\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s football. Teenage testosterone and all that. Plus, Dowman\u2019s reputation as a rising star precedes him at academy level in particular and that will stir all sorts of emotions in others.\nShirt and shorts covered in mud, Dowman got up, brushed himself down (literally) and didn\u2019t have any issue with the challenge. He seemed less impressed with the reaction elsewhere but dealt with it coolly, calmly waving his finger from a distance a few moments later and saying nothing. Others \u2014 and that includes players twice his age \u2014 might have been rattled and lost their focus.\nThat wasn\u2019t the case with Dowman, whose talking was done with his boots. He never stopped showing for the ball across 136 minutes of football (it was a long night with extra time) and, not surprisingly, his Arsenal team-mates kept giving it to him.\nWith a little over 20 minutes of normal time remaining and Arsenal trailing 2-1, Dowman pounced on a defensive mistake, dummied to shoot, shifted inside to open up the angle on his left foot and drilled home the equaliser. The outcome felt inevitable from the moment he picked up the ball.\nAn important equaliser from Dowman \ud83e\ude84#AFCU18 | #FAYouthCup pic.twitter.com/TlEtsTnchu\n\u2014 Arsenal Academy (@ArsenalAcademy) January 18, 2025\nHe also delivered an intelligent pass to release Dan Casey in the inside right channel to cross for Arsenal\u2019s third goal on a night when 18-year-old Emmerson Sutton scored an impressive hat-trick for QPR.\nProbably the overriding impression after watching Dowman is how totally at ease he is with a ball at his feet. He never looked remotely flustered in possession, even when taking the ball under pressure deep inside his own half, and those levels of confidence and self-belief manifested themselves in other ways too.\nAdvertisement\nWhen the Arsenal players gathered in a huddle at the end of extra time and their coach Adam Birchall asked who wanted to take a penalty, Dowman\u2019s hand went straight up in the air. Arsenal missed their first spot kick but Dowman scored their second and, following some heroics from their goalkeeper Jack Porter, they triumphed to set up a fifth-round tie against Fulham.\nAfter celebrating with his team-mates at the final whistle, Dowman climbed over the seats in the stand to embrace his family and friends. He was still wearing full kit, including the No 7 shirt that most people in the stadium \u2014 not just the children who wanted to take home a souvenir \u2014 had their eyes on all night.\n(Alex Burstow/Arsenal FC via Getty Images)"

It\u2019s a minor miracle they didn\u2019t concede against Newcastle when Bernd Leno signposted a pass to Emile Smith Rowe and Newcastle\u2019s players were left shaking their heads in disbelief after Fabian Schar somehow failed to score.\nBrentford had a reprieve against Ipswich, who were perilously close to serving a goal up on a plate to West Ham in October. A VAR offside call rescued Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Fraser Forster at Bournemouth, whose goalkeeper, Kepa Arrizabalaga, was lucky that Gabriel Martinelli didn\u2019t punish him for a loose straight ball against Arsenal, which is where Mads Hermansen passed Leicester and Harry Winks into trouble (see below) in September.\nAs for Manchester United, the awful goal they conceded against Viktoria Plzen in the Europa League last week was yet another example.\nThe list goes on and on and, in many ways, provides fuel for those who wonder why so many teams continue to take such chances playing out from the back and in particular by using this type of pass.\nThere are probably a few ways to answer that question. The first thing to say is that, on a broader level, the coaches that play this way believe it makes far more sense to attack in a controlled way, in possession, through a mix of established principles and rehearsed movement patterns, even if that leads to the odd mistake, rather than tossing a coin and hoping it lands heads up \u2014 which is how they view knocking longer balls forward.\nAdvertisement\nThe second point \u2014 and this shines through when you discuss some of the incidents highlighted above with coaches who are proponents of this style of play \u2013 is that the execution of that bounce pass close to goal, taking in the decision-making around it, the positioning, and the movement and the timing, is the problem when it goes wrong, not the pass itself.\nThird, it\u2019s inevitable that the moments when it breaks down will get far more attention than the good passages of play.\nBefore we look at some more examples, it\u2019s worth pointing out that some Premier League clubs \u2014 or maybe that should be \u2018some Premier League managers and goalkeepers\u2019 \u2014 have little or no inclination to play this game of risk and reward. The goalkeepers at Bournemouth (Arrizabalaga went off-piste against Arsenal), Crystal Palace, Everton, Newcastle United and Nottingham Forest in particular tend to play short sideways passes in build-up or go long.\nIn fact, even when the No 6 drops deep to receive a vertical ball in space with no sign of any pressure, the pass is often turned down by their goalkeepers. Below is Nottingham Forest\u2019s Danilo, arms outstretched, asking for a ball he was never going to receive from the goalkeeper, Matz Sels.\nNewcastle\u2019s Nick Pope does the same (Bruno Guimaraes is pointing out that Sandro Tonali is free below)\u2026\n\u2026 as does Everton\u2019s Jordan Pickford.\nThat said, Pickford bizarrely deviated from the script at Arsenal on Saturday. What followed was a car-crash moment between him and James Tarkowski, as the Everton goalkeeper bobbled a pass that the centre-back struggled to control, encouraging Martinelli to press. The expressions on the faces of the two Everton players afterwards said it all.\nTime to look at some passages of play that show the reward and not just the risk, beginning with Arsenal\u2019s 1-1 draw at Chelsea in November.\nDeclan Rice is the player to watch here. He takes up a starting position behind Nicolas Jackson, on the opposite side to the free man (William Saliba) he wants to find after Arsenal have provoked Chelsea\u2019s press with a short goal kick.\nCole Palmer makes the standard run (curved) for any player leading the press in this situation, attempting to force the ball one way. Jackson, meanwhile, is ready to jump to Gabriel if David Raya returns the pass.\nTiming and understanding are absolutely key to what happens next. Rice waits until Palmer gets closer to Raya and then runs on the blind side of Jackson to receive a soft pass in front of him that\u2026\n\u2026 he can play first time to Saliba, and Arsenal are out.\nIt is a pattern you will see again and again at Arsenal and elsewhere.\nBelow is an example of Ryan Gravenberch doing the same thing for Liverpool on the opening day at Ipswich.\nGravenberch is an interesting player to watch when receiving straight passes because of his exceptional ability to take the ball under pressure on the half-turn. In the image below, Chelsea\u2019s Romeo Lavia is pressing him.\nBut Caoimhin Kelleher\u2019s pass is \u2018safe side\u2019 (away from where Lavia is approaching), and Gravenberch is a master of getting his body between the opponent and the ball to protect and turn in one motion.\nNot only are Arsenal and Liverpool retaining possession in these images, but they\u2019re also taking opposition players out of the game while building an attack.\nTake a look at this example of Manchester City playing out against Liverpool at Anfield at the start of December. The image that starts this phase of play is remarkable and, in many ways, captures the modern game: Ruben Dias is playing one-versus-one against Luis Diaz, 10 yards out, with nobody in goal (Stefan Ortega is on the corner of the six-yard box, out of picture).\nAs soon as Dias passes to Ortega, Manuel Akanji knows he has to connect with the City goalkeeper. Cody Gakpo, circled on the left, is already anticipating the pattern and preparing to press Dias.\nThe natural thing for Akanji to do \u2014 and what happens 99 times out of 100 \u2014 would be to pass to Dias.\nIndeed, Mario Lemina did exactly that against Liverpool in September. Salah read him like a book but, uncharacteristically for him, shot wide of an open goal.\nAkanji, however, scanned prior to receiving from Ortega and, aided by Dias also pointing where to play next, recognised both the need and the opportunity for a different (and much more progressive) pass to Kyle Walker.\nAs the City right-back travels forward, a line of four Liverpool players are out of the game.\nBut that\u2019s Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City, I hear you say. What about clubs outside the traditional \u2018Big Six\u2019?\nBrentford are a fascinating case study, in part because of their evolution under Thomas Frank. The percentage of long passes from their goalkeepers has dropped by a third in less than two years. Furthermore, the bounce pass to play out has been used frequently this season and with the exception of a mix-up against Ipswich that went unpunished and a slightly nervy moment in the first half against Chelsea on Sunday, it has worked extremely well.\nThe example below is from Brentford\u2019s game against Villa and starts with Ethan Pinnock passing a goal kick to Mark Flekken. Vitaly Janelt\u2019s clean technique and game intelligence really stand out in these scenarios.\nIn the image below, Janelt has his right hand outstretched, preaching calm and telling Flekken to wait as Ollie Watkins starts to make that familiar curved run. Clearly, this passage of play asks a lot of Flekken \u2014 or any goalkeeper. It\u2019s not just about being good with their feet; they need to be calm, trust their team-mates, and make smart decisions in response to the opposition press.\nWhen Watkins gets closer, Janelt makes his move, arriving at pace and running off the back of John McGinn, who has his eyes on Flekken and Pinnock.\nYouri Tielemans leaves Yehor Yarmoliuk and jumps, along with McGinn, to press Janelt. But the Brentford midfielder and Flekken have worked it perfectly and Nathan Collins is \u2018out\u2019.\nThree Villa players have been bypassed as Collins drives forward and\u2026\n\u2026 a few seconds later, Yoane Wissa has the ball inside the Villa half and Brentford have a four-versus-four attack.\nThe instinct is to say that the passages of play highlighted above look relatively straightforward. In reality, they require hours and hours of practice on the training ground as well as players who have both the technical ability and the mental fortitude to handle the ball in these situations and deal with the crowd anxiety. Indeed, that leads into a question that football fans will often ask about their team: are our players good enough to play this way?\nAdvertisement\nLet\u2019s analyse some clips of where it goes wrong.\nThe clip below is from Manchester United\u2019s game against Tottenham in September. Diogo Dalot, playing the role of auxiliary No 6, receives a straight pass from Onana with his back to goal. Both United centre-backs \u2014 Matthijs de Ligt and Lisandro Martinez \u2014 are higher than you would expect in this scenario.\nNormally, the pass made from the player occupying Dalot\u2019s position here would be first time and with the left foot given where Dejan Kulusevski is pressing. But Dalot takes a touch to control with his right foot\u2026\n\u2026 turns his whole body around and passes with his right foot, too, allowing Kulusevski to get close to blocking. That extra touch also means Brennan Johnson is able to press Martinez easier (admittedly, Martinez\u2019s lack of depth doesn\u2019t help).\nPanicked, Martinez blindly helps the ball on\u2026\n\u2026 and Pedro Porro is now on the attack for Spurs.\nSome coaches are a lot more detailed with their messages than others. They will talk, for example, about the importance of goalkeepers receiving the ball in a neutral position, so that the opponent leading the press doesn\u2019t know which side to jump and also discourage goalkeepers from making sweeping actions with their passes (picture that awkward Pickford ball to Tarkowski at Arsenal) to prevent the ball arriving with a bounce or with spin on it.\nIn other words, completing a pass to a team-mate isn\u2019t enough when playing out against a press; it\u2019s about giving the player receiving the ball the best possible opportunity of making their next action perfect \u2014 after all, multiple passes will often be required. It\u2019s interesting to hear Liverpool players talking about how their manager, Arne Slot, has stopped training sessions because passes have not been played to the back foot of the receiver.\nAdvertisement\nThe problem with one sloppy pass is that it often leads to another. In the next photo, the Ipswich goalkeeper, Arijanet Muric, plays a ball around Tottenham\u2019s Dominic Solanke using the outside of his right foot. It\u2019s high risk and comes off, but the pass isn\u2019t easy for Sam Morsy to play first time and that contributes to the next pass being untidy\u2026\n\u2026 which ends up with Dara O\u2019Shea jumping to try to get the ball under control and encouraging Spurs to press even more.\nIpswich are committed to playing out from the back under Kieran McKenna and their build-up involves a lot of straight passes that they generally execute well \u2014 the montage below is from Saturday\u2019s game at Wolves.\nMcKenna \u2014 and this feels important for any coach who wants to play this way \u2014 took time to explain his philosophy to the Ipswich fans to try to manage the apprehension that often builds in stadiums during these phases of play.\nAway from home can be more challenging, though, and rival supporters will revel in the sort of moment that Ipswich endured at West Ham earlier in the season.\nThe first thing that jumps out when you watch the passage below is the setup. As well as being very close to the penalty area, both of Ipswich\u2019s defensive midfielders, Morsy and Kalvin Phillips, are marked from behind before the goal kick and that feels like a red flag.\nMorsy is unable to arrive at speed or on the blind side of an opponent. As for Phillips, he makes the penalty area more crowded by dropping inside and bringing Lucas Paqueta with him.\nIn fact, Phillips almost gets in the way of Morsy\u2019s pass\u2026\n\u2026 which ends up at the feet of Paqueta.\nAmid a scene of chaos in the Ipswich penalty area, O\u2019Shea clears off the line.\nOn the subject of overcrowding, there were 14 players (8 v 6) in a tight space when Southampton tried to play out against Villa this month (see the image below). Southampton survived this one, but they conceded against Liverpool in a not-dissimilar fashion and there was the Chelsea goal, too.\nWatching Southampton this season, it was hard to avoid the conclusion that neither Lumley nor Alex McCarthy, both of whom deputised for the injured Aaron Ramsdale, were equipped to play Russell Martin\u2019s brand of football at this level \u2014 and maybe they weren\u2019t alone.\nClearly, there are times when the straight pass isn\u2019t on and the goalkeeper needs to adopt a more pragmatic approach. Fulham\u2019s Sander Berge is pictured below signalling to Leno that he should miss him out and go over the top of Brighton\u2019s aggressive press.\nGetting caught in two minds is probably the worst position for a goalkeeper to be in and that\u2019s what happened to Tottenham\u2019s Guglielmo Vicario against Brentford (below). It\u2019s almost as if Vicario is so programmed to play that straight pass (it\u2019s central to the way Spurs build up under their manager Ange Postecoglou) that he doesn\u2019t recognise an alternative. Fabio Carvalho capitalised on Vicario\u2019s indecision but, to the Spurs goalkeeper\u2019s credit, he recovered and denied Bryan Mbeumo moments later.\nBoth Vicario and Forster, his deputy, have had their share of close shaves this season, most recently at Bournemouth a couple of weeks ago, where Kulusevski felt like a sitting duck for Tyler Adams when the straight pass arrived.\nOn Sunday, against Southampton, Spurs were at it again right from the kick-off.\nFour passes later, James Maddison was running through on goal and putting his team 1-0 up.\nThe risk, Postecoglou and others will argue, is worth the reward.\n(Top photos: Getty Images; design: Meech Robinson)"

      "text": "Follow live updates of Arsenal vs Leeds United on The Athletic\nMax Dowman, the 15-year-old midfielder, made his Arsenal first team debut in a 5-0 win against Leeds United on Saturday.\nDowman is now the second-youngest player ever to appear for Arsenal. His team-mate Ethan Nwaneri holds the club and Premier League record having made his first appearance aged 15 years, five months and 28 days in a match against Brentford in September 2022.\nAdvertisement\nMikel Arteta named the England youth international on the bench for the game after a swift rise through the academy age group sides in north London and replaced Noni Madueke in the 64th minute.\nThis follow\u2019s Dowman\u2019s first senior appearance during the club\u2019s preseason in Singapore, coming off the bench against Milan in July. He later caught the eye against Premier League opposition in Newcastle United four days later, winning a penalty in another substitute appearance.\nHe travelled with the squad for last weekend\u2019s opening game against Manchester United at Old Trafford but did not make the final 20. Saturday\u2019s game marked the first time he was included in a senior matchday squad for a competitive fixture.\nDowman\u2019s development is being carefully managed by the club and coaching staff, but after consistently impressing in training with the first-team through last season and in recent months he made his latest step up on Saturday.\nPremier League rules allow a 15-year-old to play so long as they are 15 by August 31 of the campaign in question. Dowman therefore wasn\u2019t eligible to feature last season.\nLast September, Dowman \u2014 who turned 15 in December \u2014 became the youngest player ever to score in a UEFA Youth League game when he scored in a 4-1 defeat to Atalanta.\nThe midfielder made his debut for Arsenal\u2019s under-18 team in September 2023, aged 13, and played a number of league matches at that level in 2024-25 alongside several appearances in the UEFA Youth League.\nAsked during pre-season what the plan for the teenager would be this term, Arteta said: \u201cWe don\u2019t know with all the young kids. At the end they are in and around the team constantly and they getting used to the dynamics and the demands.\n\u201cAnd especially raising the physical levels because the demands they need to perform and impact at the level is really high physical standards. They are getting there and that gives them a good platform and they will have to earn it.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWas Dowman\u2019s inclusion a surprise?\nBy The Athletic\u2019s Arsenal Writer Art de Roche\nDespite his age, Dowman\u2019s involvement in a Premier League matchday is not a total shock.\nMikel Arteta had been vocal about the 15-year-old in press conferences before last season had even finished.\nThe England Under-17 international was expected to feature in pre-season, and his ability to replicate his exploits from youth football against Premier League players was outstanding.\nHe was not just impressing in flashes, but actually impacting games by winning penalties against Newcastle United and Villarreal. Care will be needed around his development, but today shows the trust manager Mikel Arteta has in his ability.\nHow did Dowman play?\nAnalysis from football news writer Dan Sheldon\nMax Dowman became the second youngest-ever player to feature for Arsenal when he was introduced in the second half \u2014 but he looked like he had been playing in the Premier League for years, such was the assured nature of his 25-minute cameo.\nDowman played on the right flank and had his first look at goal in the 75th minute, bringing down a long diagonal ball with the outside of his left boot, before cutting in and getting a shot away.\nYes, it sailed over the bar, but the initial touch and confidence to drive forward and take on the Leeds defence is exactly why he is causing so much excitement.\nThere was another run a few minutes later, this time beating Gabriel Gudmundsson, only for Dowman to then be pulled down, prompting the Arsenal supporters to sing \u2018Super Max Dowman\u2019 in unison. It felt like the Arsenal crowd \u2014 and Dowman\u2019s team-mates \u2014 were desperate for him to score.\nIt was turning into the Dowman show, with the teenager\u2019s volley from the resulting free-kick zipping wide of the post. He won a penalty in added-time, skipping past Leeds defenders before he was brought down by Anton Stach.\nPoignantly, Arsenal ended the match with three Hale End graduates \u2014 Dowman, Nwaneri and Myles Lewis-Skelly \u2014 on the pitch, with all three showing plenty of signs that they will be mainstays in this Arsenal team for years to come.\n(David Price/Arsenal FC via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Tottenham Hotspur really love their trips to the Etihad Stadium.\nHaving won 4-0 there last season under Ange Postecoglou, Spurs pressed City high up the pitch under the instruction of Thomas Frank this time around \u2014 and it worked perfectly. Goals from Brennan Johnson and Joao Palhinha did the damage to make it three wins in their last five trips.\nAdvertisement\nCity lost left-back Rayan Ait-Nouri after 23 minutes to an ankle injury, with Nathan Ake replacing him. And it got worse for the home team 10 minutes before the break when Richarlison beat the tightest of offside calls to play in Johnson to fire beyond James Trafford \u2014 the goal given after a VAR check.\nThat was nothing compared to what happened in added time in the first period. Trafford had been fortunate when he escaped being penalised after a challenge on Mohammed Kudus, but when he attempted a pass to Nico Gonzalez in the area, it was intercepted by Pape Matar Sarr, and Palhinha rammed it home for his first Spurs goal.\nRodri returned for City after the break but Spurs were good value to continue Frank\u2019s stunning start as Spurs head coach.

It was a tough moment for the 22-year-old in only his second start since returning to the club in a \u00a327million deal from Burnley.\nEderson, who is the subject of interest from Galatasaray, watched on from the bench. It was just over a week ago that Guardiola stated he would start the season as his No 1 but the speculation has led to that spot being up in the air.\nAdvertisement\nTrafford would have hoped to use this window of opportunity to stake his claim, but this was a costly error that would not have done him any favours.\nJordan Campbell\nSpurs: Organised, aggressive, effective\nTottenham\u2019s failed pursuits of Eberechi Eze and Morgan Gibbs-White have left Frank without a natural No 10 in the absence of Dejan Kulusevski and James Maddison, who are out with long-term knee injuries. But as Spurs proved in the first half, sometimes an aggressive, organised press can be as effective as any playmaker.\nFrom the first time Trafford received the ball in open play, it was evident that Frank had directed his players to swarm City\u2019s goalkeeper. The initial demonstration of Spurs\u2019 effective press happened inside the first 10 minutes, with Cristian Romero going man-to-man with Haaland, who had dropped to the edge of the box to receive a pass from City\u2019s defenders.\nAs soon as the pass reached the Norway striker, Romero rushed in from behind and won the ball on the edge of the City box, leading to a Spurs free kick from 20 yards.\nThen, with Spurs already 1-0 up through Johnson, they doubled their lead as Sarr took advantage of a careless pass from Trafford to win the ball in the City box.\nPalhinha, on his first Premier League start for Spurs, then calmly converted from close range.\nElias Burke\nHow good a signing will Palhinha prove?\nFor long periods of last season, Tottenham were arguably the easiest team to counter-attack in the Premier League. Postecoglou tried (and failed) to find a combination at the base of his midfield to provide the protection he needed to play his attacking style, and Spurs invariably suffered as a result.\nIf this performance was anything to go by, Frank has found the answer in Palhinha, who has signed on loan for the season from Bayern Munich.\nAdvertisement\nIn the first half, Frank tasked Palhinha with marking Rayan Cherki out of the game, and the Portugal international thrived under the assignment. By the time Pep Guardiola had taken Cherki off on the 54th minute, he had been dispossessed twice and failed to make a meaningful impact on the game.\nMinutes later, it was Palhinha\u2019s tough tackle on Cherki\u2019s replacement, Bernardo Silva, that set Spurs off on a threatening counter-attack that could have put Spurs three in front had Johnson\u2019s touch been better.\nPalhinha\u2019s Spurs league debut may be remembered for his goal, but it is his steel and bite in midfield, combined with an underrated ability on the ball, that will make him essential to their success this season.\nElias Burke\nWas City\u2019s rotation really needed?\nIt was a common sight in the first half to see Guardiola shaking his head on the touchline as another attempt at building up possession went awry.\nCity never looked fully confident under pressure, with Rico Lewis and Gonzalez both giving the ball away too often. Guardiola made two changes from the team that beat Wolves, bringing in Omar Marmoush and Cherki for Bernardo Silva and Jeremy Doku, but City badly lacked cohesion in the final third.\nMarmoush, whose primary position at Eintracht Frankfurt was through the centre, looked awkward at times receiving out wide, while Cherki barely linked with Haaland, if at all.\nGuardiola has spoken about playing more direct this season, perhaps an influence of his new assistant Pep Lijnders, but what replaced control was frantic rather than precision.\nChanging the profile of attacking players so drastically means City did not have the luxury of consistency, but this is what having such a deep squad necessitates. Rotation has been key to his previous title-winning teams, but the squad size right now is so big and so diverse in skill set.\nAdvertisement\nIn attempting to keep everyone happy, Guardiola has to ensure he does not sacrifice consistency and fluidity.\nJordan Campbell\nWhat did Guardiola say?\n\u201cI have a feeling the performance was a little bit better than the result. We started well but conceded a goal that can happen and missed some simple things with the ball and after they scored the second goal it was difficult.\n\u201cI decided to continue with James (Trafford) after he made a good first game. When I take decisions in the first part of the season, for all the players you play one or two everyone thinks, \u2018OK this is the starting line up\u2019\u2026it was just today I decided that.\n\u201cThe game against Spurs this season is man marking, like Brentford, you have to play in a different way. We missed the simple things. The effort and running is extraordinary and I have no doubts about that. It\u2019s been really good. But we missed the simple things. We created chances, we created enough. It happened, it\u2019s football. It\u2019s just the second game. The last game vs Wolves everyone said everything was fine but I said it\u2019d just the first game and it\u2019s the same now.\n\u201cWe have to improve. Step by step until we make it click and the good connections\u2026 we have seven days rest and then Brighton.\u201d\nWhat did Frank say?\n\u201cVery delighted. Extremely proud of the players performance, it was an exceptionally good performance. We know it\u2019s always difficult to play against city. Here at the Etihad, even more difficult. The first 35 minutes, I thought, was fairly even, but with City on top.\n\u201cIt was a big mentality shift in terms of staying in the game and keep doing what we wanted to do, scoring a great goal. Maybe they changed a little bit of momentum, but we definitely stayed on top for 2-0.\n\u201cSecond half, we were very good. And the big spell where we could think that they would put pressure on us, we were very aggressive in the high pressure. I thought that we were very front footed, with the mindset to constantly go for third goal.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI must say that the clean sheet makes me very happy. It\u2019s a big thing we\u2019ve been working on. Not on clean sheets, that\u2019s easier said than done, but on the defensive side of the game. High pressure, middle block, low block, defend the box mentality, blocking shots. Everything. Because if you get clean sheets you\u2019re closer to winning a game.\u201d\nWhat next for City?\nSunday, August 31: Brighton (Away), Premier League, 2pm UK, 9am ET\nWhat next for Spurs?\nSaturday, August 30: Bournemouth (Home), Premier League, 3pm UK, 10am ET\n(Top photo: Palhinha celebrates after making it 2-0.

      "text": "Two games into the Premier League season and Manchester United remain winless despite promising performances.\nAt Craven Cottage, usually a happy hunting ground for the visitors, substitute Emile Smith Rowe denied Ruben Amorim\u2019s men three points with an equaliser in a hard-fought 1-1 draw.\nRodrigo Muniz scored an unfortunate own goal to give United the lead, as a Leny Yoro header from a Bryan Mbeumo corner deflected in off the striker in the 58th minute. The goal spared Bruno Fernandes\u2019 blushes after the United captain had wildly missed a first-half penalty.\nAdvertisement\nBut with his first touch, Smith Rowe came off the bench to brilliantly guide Alex Iwobi\u2019s fine cross home. It was a deserved goal for a Fulham team that finished the stronger of the two as Marco Silva\u2019s substitutions made an impact.\nCarl Anka and Mark Carey analyse the action.\nHow did Fernandes miss his penalty so badly?\nUnited moved the ball sharply, working it quickly into the channels where one of Mason Mount, Matheus Cunha or Mbeumo was able to make it stick. All that was missing was the opening goal.\nThat breakthrough seemed a matter of routine in the 33rd minute when referee Chris Kavanagh was called over to the pitchside monitor to review some agricultural defending on a Fernandes corner. Replays showed Calvin Bassey throwing Mount to the ground before the corner was delivered and the penalty was consequently awarded. Luke Shaw was also grappling with Muniz in the box, but the VAR was not reviewing that.\nFernandes went for a stutter-step run-up, but did not use his usual hop before striking the ball, opting for a powerful effort aimed for the top left corner. He struck the ball while leaning back, an unusual error from the typically reliable penalty-taker.\nThe United captain\u2019s regular routine appeared to be disrupted by the presence of the referee, who was in proximity to Fernandes before the midfielder started his run-up.\nThe referee\u2019s attempt to walk around the player during his run-up saw Fernandes inadvertently back into him. Fernandes was visibly frustrated, and it may have thrown him from his usual rhythm, but it was nonetheless a bad miss.\nSpeaking to NBC, Fernandes said: \u201cLike everyone, you have your own routine. I was preparing myself to get the penalty and that got a little bit on my nerves. But it is not because of that that I missed the penalty. I missed the penalty because I kicked very badly the ball. I took it too under and the ball ended up going over the bar.\u201d\nCarl Anka\nMount gives Amorim a good problem to have\nIt is widely discussed that Mason Mount is a player every manager loves.\nHis ability to stitch together attacks and provide disciplined defensive displays was on show last week against Arsenal, and the same was true against Fulham. Beyond his positive performances in the short term, it prompts an important, wider question for the season: which of United\u2019s new attacking signings is going to miss out as a consequence?\nFor now, Benjamin Sesko needs more time to get up to speed with his new squad, so two consecutive games starting on the bench are to be expected. However, the calls for Sesko, Mbeumo and Cunha to start together will be just around the corner, with fans likely to be clamouring to see their shiny new upgrades on the field at the same time.\nAdvertisement\nThe balance Mount offers to the team cannot be denied. Particularly accounting for Amorim\u2019s 3-4-2-1 system, there were times last season when the midfield duo looked dangerously overrun with the spaces far too wide to cover defensively. With Mount in the side, Amorim has a player who is comfortable tucking in to plug gaps out of possession, while still offering the technical quality to progress United up the field when his side are on the attack.\nIt is a good problem for Amorim to have, but with no European football this season, it will be harder to keep all of his star players happy all at once if Mount continues his strong start to the season.\nMark Carey\nSilva\u2019s case for new signings strengthened\nWith Fulham looking rather blunt in attack after the hour mark, Marco Silva looked to his bench. The arrival of Harry Wilson and Antonee Robinson was soon followed by Smith Rowe and Raul Jimenez \u2014 all of whom injected energy into the home side that led to Smith Rowe\u2019s excellent equaliser, meeting Iwobi\u2019s cross with a well-timed finish.\nSmith Rowe showed his eye for a late run into the box multiple times last season, knowing that his team-mates rarely need a second invitation to cross the ball. For context, no side averaged more than Fulham\u2019s 17.6 open-play crosses per 90 last season.\nIt would be crass to suggest that Silva would be happy that Fulham are still chasing their first victory of the season, but with the transfer window still open, it might strengthen his case that his side still needs reinforcements after a quiet summer of incomings.\n\u201cAt this stage of last season, we had two/three players in,\u201d Silva said at his press conference on Friday. \u201cThis season, we had a plan; the plan has fallen through. It\u2019s our fault, not active at all. We cannot be pleased.\u201d\nOn the one hand, there is plenty to be said about having a settled side going into a new season. Silva is excellent at managing his squad and making impactful substitutions, with 19 of Fulham\u2019s goals being scored by players from off the bench since the start of last season.\nAdvertisement\nOn the other hand, new signings can provide added freshness, competition for places, and greater quality as Silva looks to build on last season. Depending on Fulham\u2019s output this campaign, you can duly pick your narrative accordingly.\nMark Carey\nSesko will need time to acclimatise\nThe 53rd minute saw Amorim shake things up. Off came Casemiro and Amad to be replaced by Sesko and Diogo Dalot. That led to Mount dropping into the central midfield pivot, while Dalot offered some defensive security at right wing-back.\nBut Sesko, unfortunately, didn\u2019t get many shooting opportunities, finishing the game with 15 touches and zero shots. Marco Silva\u2019s decision to match United\u2019s 3-4-2-1 in phases meant the 22-year-old was unable to go hunting in the right half-space, as he did last week in the 1-0 loss against Arsenal. Instead, Sesko spent much of his appearance standing between Joachim Andersen and Bassey, trying to peel off Andersen and attack Bassey\u2019s blind side when the ball was funnelled out wide.\nFulham\u2019s touch-tight approach when defending Mbeumo (he only had six touches of the ball between the 45th and 70th minutes) limited the creative supply to the striker. In the final 10 minutes, Sesko tried his best with the limited chances his team manufactured. But while the away section chanted \u201cAttack, attack, attack attack attack!\u201d, United\u2019s players struggled to get the ball into the final third.\nWhen out of possession, Sesko could be found checking his shoulders to see if Cunha and Mbeumo would join his attempts to press. Amorim\u2019s new front three have plenty of running power and technical trickery, but they will need time to synchronise. Two games in, and we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of Sesko\u2019s talents.\nCarl Anka\nWhat did Amorim say?\n\u201cIt was a tough match. I think when we scored the goal we forget about maintaining the way we should play \u2014 we were just thinking about maintaining the result,\u201d he told reporters.\n\u201cWe want to win so bad we forget about maintaining possession, push the opponent, we just gave a little bit of the game to Fulham. We started really well, until the goal I think we were a good team. We can do better. After the goal, I think we were just thinking about maintaining the advantage. We cannot do that.\n\u201cWe are going to score goals because we are creating so many chances and that is the important thing. Then we just have to move on.\u201d\nWhat did Silva say?\n\u201cThe players that came on were brilliant,\u201d said Silva, per Fulham\u2019s official website. \u201cLast week was the same and last season it was the story of the season.\n\u201cHarry Wilson had a great pre-season and today he started on the bench, but a massive impact from him. Raul started last week and, of course, Emile, helped the team last week with the build-up for the goal and this afternoon he scored. He knows he\u2019s important for us and he can arrive in the right spots.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThey started better, but from 20 minutes we controlled really well. We didn\u2019t give many spaces to them and they only created moments from set pieces. They scored, but it was a great reaction from the boys in a difficult moment of the game. We finished the game stronger, in and around their box with some good moments. I\u2019m proud of the fans and the way they were with the team right until the end.\u201d\nWhat next for United?\nWednesday, August 27: Grimsby (Away), Carabao Cup second round, 8pm UK, 3pm ET\nWhat next for Fulham?\nWednesday, August 27: Bristol City (Away), Carabao Cup second round, 7.45pm UK, 2.45pm ET\n(Top photo: Mike Hewitt/Getty Images)"
