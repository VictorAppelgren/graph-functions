      "text": "Expert's Rating\nPros\n- Bigger, easier-to-read display\n- Faster charging\n- Refined design\nCons\n- Still only 18 hours battery life\n- Blood Oxygen unavailable in the U.S.\nOur Verdict\nAfter 10 years of Apple Watch releases, we know what to expect, and we are neither surprised nor disappointed. This is a set of nice, modest tweaks to a proven formula that needs little fanfare.\nPrice When Reviewed\nThis value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined\nBest Pricing Today\nBest Prices Today: Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm)\nFor the last several years, the Apple Watch has undergone a relatively modest series of yearly upgrades. It has more-or-less looked and felt the same since the Series 4, that huge upgrade that gave us a much larger display area (with rounded corners), a big leap in performance, and the impressive ECG feature.\nSince then, the watch has gotten just a tiny bit better each year. Maybe just a touch faster. Maybe there\u2019s a new sensor, like blood oxygen. Maybe the display is a little brighter. We had hoped the rumors of a iPhone X-style overhaul with the Apple Watch Series 10 were true. They weren\u2019t. This year\u2019s update once again takes very modest, measured steps to improve Apple\u2019s winning formula.\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 is my favorite Apple Watch, but it\u2019s still only a little better than the Series 9, which wasn\u2019t very different from the Series 8, which was only slightly better than the Series 7\u2026\nApple Watch Series 10 design: Bigger and flatter\nIt has been a while since Apple changed the physical design of the Apple Watch, so the Series 10\u2019s new design is notable. And while the updated shape of the Series 10 is not nearly as dramatic as you might have hoped, it is noticeable.\nThe watch is a little larger on the wrist, but also thinner and flatter, with sides that are even more rounded. The glass top curves smoothly to match the curve of the case with only the thinnest little line; you can barely see it. In practice, it doesn\u2019t feel a lot different than the earlier models. Perhaps just slightly more comfortable\u2014it\u2019s just a couple of grams lighter (though the new high-end titanium model is a lot lighter than the Stainless Steel it replaces), but that weight is spread out a little more. The ever-so-slightly flatter design tends to catch on cuffs and sleeves a little less, too.\nTo fit with the flatter shape, the digital crown is redesigned, with a smaller radius. The cellular red dot is also gone. Functionally, it hasn\u2019t changed, but you will notice a slight difference.\nApple\nApple Watch Series 10 display: Easier to see\nThere are three changes to this year\u2019s model that you\u2019ll actually notice in day-to-day use.\nThe first is the new speaker design, which Apple thinks is good enough to let you play music or podcasts directly from the watch rather than through a Bluetooth device like AirPods. It\u2019s both surprising how good it sounds considering the size, and also still not good enough that you\u2019d want to use it.\nIt\u2019s perfectly fine for most podcasts or audiobooks, as long as you\u2019re not in a loud environment, though it does take a heavy toll on battery life. Besides, it would annoy anyone around you. I suggest you stick with your AirPods.\nThe display is just as bright as the Series 9, which cranks up to 2000 nits in the sunlight and is very easy to see. Apple says the new display here is 40% brighter at an angle, and I don\u2019t know how to quantify that but I definitely could notice that it\u2019s much easier to see the time or a large complication without needing to turn the watch directly toward me. You can readily tell the difference.\nThe display is physically larger (a little less than 10% bigger) but the black bezels around the display have grown a little in appearance, too. The better viewing angles and slightly larger size does make it easier to read and the expanded touch targets makes precision tapping just a little bit easier.\nFoundry\nApple Watch Series 10 features: Better charging, same everything else\nCharging speed has improved when used with a fast-charge accessory (any Apple Watch charger from the Series 7 onward and a 20W or better USB-C power adapter). Apple says it goes from 0-80 percent in 30 minutes instead of the 45 minutes you\u2019d have to wait with other recent Apple Watches.\nI definitely noticed a significant difference. Generally, I could put my watch on a charging stand at the end of the day when I go to take a shower and take it off after 20 or 30 minutes with a full charge, or nearly so. If I had forgotten to charge my watch and it was too low to wear for sleep tracking that night, a brief 10 minutes on the charger would give me enough juice to last overnight.\nStill, the biggest flaw with the Apple Watch is that it\u2019s a \u201ccharge every day\u201d device. Faster charging makes this more convenient, but I still want multi-day battery life more than any other possible feature.\nOtherwise, the Apple Watch Series 10 continues with the strategy of making very small changes each year. Performance and battery life have remained relatively constant for years\u2014the S9 SiP introduced last year was supposedly a lot faster than the S8 and S7, but we certainly couldn\u2019t tell the difference in practical use, and the S10 in this model seems like the same thing again.\nBut you\u2019ll sometimes get a new sensor that enables something new, like blood oxygen, overnight temperature, fall detection, or a double-tap gesture. This year, there\u2019s a water temperature and depth gauge, along with the somewhat-improved speaker, larger display, and faster charging.\nIf you\u2019re in the United States, you\u2019ll also lose the Blood Oxygen feature if you had it on an older watch. Apple is in an ongoing patent battle with Masimo over it and has been forced to disable the feature on new watches sold in the U.S., though they didn\u2019t have to disable it on already-sold watches. The hardware is there and the feature could be re-enabled with a software update, depending on the outcome of the patent dispute.\nShould you buy an Apple Watch Series 10?\nIn our review of the Apple Watch Series 9, we wrote in response to this question: \u201cThat depends on what you currently own. If you\u2019re on a Series 7 or 8, I would say no, since the changes won\u2019t really be noticeable. If you\u2019ve got anything older, or if this is going to be your first Apple Watch, then dive on in! The water\u2019s lovely.\u201d\nThe same applies this year. The changes in this year\u2019s model are not enough to warrant an upgrade for most people using a Series 9 or even Series 8. But these small tweaks each year start to add up to big overall improvements, like compounding interest. If your Apple Watch is three or more years old, you will probably notice and appreciate the improvements in this year\u2019s model enough to justify the price."

      "text": "Early last year, Apple made the bold, court-mandated decision to remove the blood-oxygen feature from the Apple Watch Series 9 and Ultra 2 in the U.S. over a patent dispute with medical technology company Masimo. Since then, all new watches (including the Series 10, which launched several months later) have shipped with the sensor disabled, eliminating a feature available since the Series 6.\nNow, Apple has re-enabled the blood oxygen feature for Apple Watch Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2 users. In a press release titled, \u201cAn update on Blood Oxygen for Apple Watch in the U.S.,\u201d Apple says, \u201cUsers with these models in the U.S. who currently do not have the Blood Oxygen feature will have access to the redesigned Blood Oxygen feature by updating their paired iPhone to iOS 18.6.1 and their Apple Watch to watchOS 11.6.1.\u201d\nApple says the update, which arrived Thursday, was enabled by a recent U.S. Customs ruling. To apply the update, open Settings on your iPhone and go to General > Software Updates and follow the prompts. After your iPhone has updates, open the Watch app on your iPhone and select General > Software Update, then follow the instructions to update your Apple Watch.\nThe new feature will now measure and calculate sensor data on the paired iPhone, and results can be viewed in the Respiratory section of the Health app. Previously, users could take a blood oxygen measurement at any time with the Blood Oxygen app as well as track occasional background measurements. It\u2019s not clear whether this update will take away the ability to take instant readings on the watch.\nOlder watches that still have the blood-oxygen feature enabled will not be affected by the update, Apple says."
