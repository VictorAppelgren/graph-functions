  "title": "Eminem\u2019s Two-Decade-Old Song Reaches The Top 10 On Several Billboard Charts",

  "content": "When Eminem is not actively promoting a new album or single, he usually still manages to appear on the Billboard charts in America with Curtain Call: The Hits. His singles project, which includes most of his early-career smashes, is a regular across a number of rankings, and it is one of the most successful compilations ever released.\n\nFrom time to time, one or two tunes by the rapper can also make a home on various rankings, with their success depending on what else is happening in the music world. This week, Eminem scores a pair of top 10 hits in the United States with a decades-old smash \u2014 one that changed the trajectory of his career forever.\n\n\u201cLose Yourself\u201d Hits the Top 10 on Several Charts\n\n\u201cLose Yourself\u201d is one of a select few Eminem tunes that can often find space on at least one list in America, and this frame, the track settles into two U.S.-based tallies. \u201cLose Yourself\u201d lifts from No. 8 to No. 4 on the Rap Digital Song Sales chart. At the same time, it reappears on the R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales ranking at No. 6 \u2013 making it a top 10 bestseller on multiple rosters simultaneously.\n\n\u201cLose Yourself\u201d is one of the most successful singles in the history of both the R&B/Hip-Hop Digital Song Sales and Rap Digital Song Sales charts. Last frame, the smash reached 500 weeks on the rap-only ranking, and with its return to the broader tally, it hits 476 stays there as well.\n\nSomehow, despite selling millions of copies and continuing to perform well enough decades after its release to still find space on both lists simultaneously, \u201cLose Yourself\u201d has never conquered either of them. Eminem has pushed the blockbuster to the runner-up space in the past.\n\nBy the time Eminem released \u201cLose Yourself\u201d in the fall of 2002, he was already one of the biggest musical superstars on the planet. The track was written and recorded specifically for his semi-autobiographical film 8 Mile, and it turned out to be not just another hit, but one of the biggest songs of all time.\n\n\u201cLose Yourself\u201d shot to No. 1 on the Hot 100 and has since been certified 13-times platinum for moving 13 million copies in the U.S. The tune won a pair of Grammys and earned Eminem the Academy Award for Best Original Song \u2014 a first for hip-hop.",
