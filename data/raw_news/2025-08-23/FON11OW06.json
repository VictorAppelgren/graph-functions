  "content": "Nearly 100 people turned out to a candlelight vigil for a missing California infant just hours after his parents were arrested for his murder.\n\nFamilies with children in tow laid flowers, stuffed animals and other tokens on the fence outside of the home of Emmanuel Haro in Cabazon, about 35 minutes east of San Bernadino on Friday evening, while others held signs demanding justice for the still-missing infant, The Sun reported.\n\n\u201cWhere is the baby\u201d one sign read, according to the outlet.\n\n\u201cThe reason why we are here is to support baby Emmanuel,\u201d one attendee, Riah Huey, told The Sun. \u201cWhat they did to this child is not okay\u2026They did not give this boy the right life.\u201d\n\nJake and Rebecca Haro were taken into custody on suspicion of murder at their home hours earlier.\n\nThe arrest came nearly a week after the mother initially insisted her son was kidnapped outside a sporting goods store.\n\nThe twisted tale was a lie, said officials, who now believe the brown-eyed boy is dead.\n\n\u201cBased on the evidence, investigators determined a kidnapping in Yucaipa did not occur. It is believed Emmanuel is deceased, and the search to recover his remains is ongoing,\u201d the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Office wrote in a Friday statement.\n\nThe development left vigil attendees \u201cdisgusted,\u201d one said.\n\nMaya Gutierrez, 20, told the outlet she had been standing outside the home all afternoon to be a voice for the baby.\n\n\u201cNobody was his voice,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve that at all.\u201d\n\nThe infant\u2019s Aug. 14 disappearance also spurred national nonprofit Uvalde Foundation for Kids to announce \u201ca national operational \u2018blackout\u2019\u201d for 210 minutes Saturday in the baby\u2019s honor, with each minute representing the 210 days of the child\u2019s short life.\n\nThe organization had initially offered a $5,000 reward for the baby\u2019s return but later retracted it after investigators found inconsistency\u2019s in the mother\u2019s story.\n\nThe 41-year-old mom told police she was knocked out by a stranger while changing the tot\u2019s diaper outside of the local Big 5 Sporting Goods store and that the baby was gone when she regained consciousness.\n\nBut after spending a week publicly begging in news interviews for their baby\u2019s safe return, the Haros stopped cooperating with police, according to authorities.\n\nJake Haro, 32, had served a a six-month jail stint in 2023 for a willful child cruelty charge involving Emmanuel\u2019s older sister, authorities said.\n\nBoth parents were booked at Riverside County Jail Friday and were being held without bail.\n\nThe San Bernardino Sheriff\u2019s Department, which pledged to continue searching for Emmanuel, did not immediately respond to inquiries Saturday.",

      "text": "Parents of missing 7-month-old California boy Emmanuel Haro arrested on murder charges\nThe parents of missing infant Emmanuel Haro were arrested Friday for murder around a week after their 7-month-old boy mysteriously vanished, California authorities said.\nJake and Rebecca Haro were taken into custody by San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s homicide detectives at their Cabazon home after the baby\u2019s mother initially insisted her son was kidnapped outside a sporting goods store on Aug. 14.\nBut authorities said earlier this week that there were inconsistencies in Rebecca\u2019s claims as the probe into the couple ramped up and the sheriff\u2019s office refused to rule out foul play.\nThe sheriff\u2019s office said in a Facebook post Friday that the pair were being charged with murder, but investigators will carry on searching for the baby boy with a full head of brown hair and brown eyes.\nMore details around the arrest and charges were not immediately available.\nThe missing child case has sparked a furious search for little Emmanuel and nationwide attention after the child\u2019s mother told police she was assaulted and knocked out by an unknown man.\nShe said when she regained consciousness, her little boy was gone, but investigators alleged there were \u201cinconsistencies in her initial statement,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s office said.\nDuring the search leading up to the arrests, authorities served several search warrants at the Haro home as investigators reviewed troves of surveillance footage, according to the law enforcement agency.\nBoth parents begged for their son\u2019s safe return in interviews last week.\n\u201cIf you know anything, please come forward or take him to the cops,\u201d Rebecca told KTLA as she sported a black eye. \u201cPlease come and bring my son back. I\u2019m begging you.\u201d\nRebecca Haro\u2019s brother James Beushausen is currently serving at least 50 years in prison for the murder of his 27-year-old girlfriend Jaylynn Amanda Keith in 2017, according to reports.\nA lawyer that has been representing Jake Haro said he didn\u2019t know much about the arrest and charges, and was still trying to get in touch with his client.\nBut defense lawyer Vincent Hughes told The Post that Jake Haro has denied any involvement in his child\u2019s disappearance.\nHughes is only speaking on behalf of the father \u2014 and not also the mother \u2014 to avoid any potential conflicts of interest. He said he has represented the father in past criminal cases.\nJake Haro\u2019s previous legal trouble included a six month stint in jail in 2023 for a willful child cruelty charge, in which Emmanuel\u2019s older sister was the victim, according to a report.\nThe half-sister, whom Jake Haro had with another woman, suffered broken bones in Oct. 2018 when she was just 10 weeks old, according to the Orange County Register.\nHughes insisted there shouldn\u2019t be a nexus between the past criminal charge and the new legal trouble his client is now facing.\n\u201cThe criminal justice system is about reform, he completed the child abuse class, he did what he was told to do. I don\u2019t really see how if somebody has a charge, any future charge means that they did it,\u201d he said as the attorney complained he\u2019s faced a torrent of death threats and verbal abuse since the missing child case gained traction.\n\u201cI\u2019m being completely dragged through the mud because I\u2019m giving somebody what they are constitutionally protected and afforded it,\u201d said Hughes."

And, like, I fly off the cuff in not like a violent way, obviously,\u201d she laughed, adding that \u201cIf I feel something, I am going to say it. Sometimes it gets me into trouble.\u201d\n\u201cHe\u2019s always devil\u2019s advocate as much as it literally kills me. He\u2019s so thoughtful in his decisions. He\u2019s the most ethical human on this entire planet. Every single decision he makes is based on his code of ethics,\u201d she added in the over-the-top tribute.\nAs she continued to heap praise on her partner, the mom reflected on the life lessons he had taught her, including how to ask for help and the importance of being vulnerable.\n\u201cI think one of the things I\u2019m going to miss is being able to show him how wonderful he\u2019s been to me and he can enjoy that. I think that bums me out,\u201d she said in the video.\nEmily said she was heartbroken at the thought she\u2019d no longer be able to trade bizarre stories and have him roast her.\n\u201cThere is no point to this video except to say like, yes, I feel sorry for myself and I\u2019m scared about how my life is going to change and how hard it is going to be for me,\u201d she said in the clip.\n\u201cBut I know how truly at the end of the day I am just so scared that all these wonderful things from this phenomenally perfect man, who has given me more than I can ever thank him for, might not be here to see all that.\u201d\nThe video was among a slew of TikToks she posted in the months leading up to Monday\u2019s shocking murder-suicide that shed light on her declining mental state \u2014 including one where she even admitted she needed professional help.\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear exactly when Long posted the seven-minute clip, which has since been reposted by other users.\nThe harrowing details continued to emerge just days after investigators said she shot her husband and her two eldest children \u2014 Parker, 8, and Ryan, 6 \u2014 before taking her own life at their Madbury, New Hampshire, home early Monday.\nThe couple\u2019s 3-year-old child \u2014 the lone survivor of the slaughter \u2014 was found alive and unharmed inside the house.\nThe mom\u2019s death was ruled a suicide while her family members\u2019 deaths were ruled homicides, according to the New Hampshire Attorney General\u2019s Office.\nInvestigators haven\u2019t yet revealed a motive for the tragedy.\n\u201cWhile investigators are becoming aware of various concerns/issues ongoing in the household at the time of the event in question, people should avoid speculating that this event was caused by a single reason or stressor,\u201d the AG\u2019s office said in a statement."

      "text": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia to be deported after refusing plea offer\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Immigration officials said they intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda, after he declined an offer to be sent to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, according to a Saturday court filing.\nThe Costa Rica offer came late Thursday, after it was clear that the Salvadoran national would likely be released from a Tennessee jail the following day. Abrego Garcia declined to extend his stay in jail and was released on Friday to await trial in Maryland with his family. Later that day, the Department of Homeland Security notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.\nHis attorneys declined to comment on whether the plea offer had been formally rescinded. The brief they filed only said that Abrego Garcia had declined one part of the offer \u2014 to remain in jail \u2014 and that his attorneys would \u201ccommunicate the government\u2019s proposal to Mr. Abrego.\u201d\nFiled along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn\u2019t face the possibility of detention. An additional benefit of the offer would be that Costa Rica is a Spanish-speaking country, like Abrego Garcia\u2019s native El Salvador. Abrego Garcia would only be deported to Costa Rica after serving his sentence on the smuggling charges, according to the brief.\nAbrego Garcia\u2019s case became a flashpoint in President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported in March. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.\nHe has pleaded not guilty and has asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The Saturday filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive.\n\u201cThe government immediately responded to Mr. Abrego\u2019s release with outrage,\u201d the filing reads. \u201cDespite having requested and received assurances from the government of Costa Rica that Mr. Abrego would be accepted there, within minutes of his release from pretrial custody, an ICE representative informed Mr. Abrego\u2019s counsel that the government intended to deport Mr. Abrego to Uganda and ordered him to report to ICE\u2019s Baltimore Field Office Monday morning,\u201d it says, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nStay up to date on alleged MS-13 gangbanger Kilmar Abrego Garcia\n- Trump admin plans to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia after prison release \u2013 and not to El Salvador, prosecutor tells judge\n- Kilmar Abrego Garcia back in US to face charges of trafficking thousands of illegal migrants \u2014 including MS-13 gangbangers\n- Moment alleged MS-13 gangbanger Kilmar Abrego Garcia was accused of human trafficking revealed in new bodycam video\n- Alleged MS-13 gangbanger\u2019s rank, street name revealed as fight over deportation to El Salvador megaprison rages: docs\n- Supreme Court rules Trump admin must \u2018facilitate\u2019 return of wrongfully deported Maryland man\nAbrego Garcia has pleaded not guilty to the smuggling charges, which stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee for speeding. There were nine passengers in the car, and officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\nA Department of Homeland Security agent testified that he didn\u2019t begin investigating the traffic stop until this April, when the government was facing mounting pressure to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.\nAlthough Abrego Garcia was deemed eligible for pretrial release, he had remained in jail at the request of his attorneys, who feared the Republican administration could try to immediately deport him again if he were freed. A recent ruling in a separate case in Maryland required ICE to provide 72 hours\u2019 notice before initiating deportation proceedings \u2014 time to allow a prospective deportee to mount a defense. An email from ICE sent to attorneys at 4:01 p.m. on Friday refers to that decision.\n\u201cPlease let this email serve as notice that DHS may remove your client, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, to Uganda no earlier than 72 hours from now (absent weekends),\u201d it states.\nFederal officials have argued that Abrego Garcia can be deported because he came to the U.S. illegally and because a U.S. immigration judge deemed him eligible for expulsion in 2019, just not to his native El Salvador where he faces a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d of violence, according to court filings."

Many signs sought justice for him.\n\u201cWhere is the baby\u201d demanded one.\nThe community came together in a prayer circle with blue candles.

      "text": "Dramatic video shows Emmanuel Haro\u2019s parents being hauled away on murder charges after phony baby snatch story\nDramatic video captured cops hauling away the alleged killer parents of missing California 7-month-old Emmanuel Haro about a week after they claimed the infant was kidnapped \u2014 a twisted tale authorities said was a lie.\nJake and Rebecca Haro were arrested by a fleet of cops at their Cabazon home and slapped with murder charges early Friday after the baby\u2019s mother fiercely maintained her son was snatched outside a sporting goods store in Yucaipa on Aug. 14, the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department said.\nBut deputies confirmed Friday night that a kidnapping never happened \u2014 and they now believe the sweet boy with brown eyes and a full head of brown hair is dead.\n\u201cDuring the investigation thus far, numerous interviews have been conducted, search warrants have been served, digital and electronic evidence has been collected and closely analyzed,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s department said in a statement.\n\u201cBased on the evidence, investigators determined a kidnapping in Yucaipa did not occur. It is believed Emmanuel is deceased, and the search to recover his remains is ongoing.\u201d\nPolice stormed the murder suspects\u2019 desert home in tanks, trucks and cruisers, cuffing the disheveled and eerily emotionless couple \u2014 both of whom looked like they\u2019d just rolled out of bed \u2014 separately and hauling them away to a local lockup, according to footage released by police.\nThe alleged 41-year-old homicidal mom \u2014 dressed in black shorts, a white tank top and flip-flops with her hair in a messy bun \u2014 was the first to be taken into custody.\nHer 32-year-old barefoot husband, clad in striped shorts and a white shirt, then stumbled his way into the police cruiser after his arrest, the video showed.\nThe shady pair were dragged off to jail just days after police said there were inconsistencies in Rebecca\u2019s claims as the probe into the couple ramped up, and the sheriff\u2019s office refused to rule out foul play.\nThe missing child case sparked a furious search for little Emmanuel and drew nationwide attention after the child\u2019s mother told police she was assaulted and knocked out by an unknown man outside a store in Yucaipa while changing the tot\u2019s diaper.\nRebecca said when she regained concentration, her little boy was gone.\nBut when investigators questioned her initial statement, the suspected killer duo \u2014 who begged for their son\u2019s safe return in interviews last week \u2014 stopped cooperating with police, the law enforcement agency said.\nDuring the search leading up to the bust, authorities served several search warrants at the Haro home as investigators reviewed troves of surveillance footage.\nPolice confirmed no additional arrests have been made, and there are no other suspects.\nThey were both booked at Riverside County Jail and are being held without bail.\n\u201cThe circumstances surrounding this investigation are tragic, and we will continue to search for Emmanuel,\u201d Sheriff Shannon Dicus said in a statement, thanking all who were involved in the probe.\n\u201cI trust our justice system will hold the parents accountable.\u201d"
