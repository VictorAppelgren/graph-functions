      "feedback": "Overall, the draft maps a credible three-regime framework anchored in macro primitives but its execution drags in micro narratives (Strip pricing, individual stock anecdotes) that dilute a decision-ready brief; the PSA should be reformatted into a tight, executive house view with 4–6 sentences. Provide a crisp, separable structure: a base-case Regime I, a Tariff-Stress Regime II, and a Structural/Long-Run Regime III, plus a clearly scoped medium-term stock thesis (ABT/ABBV/PFE) with explicit probabilities and market implications. Tighten the causal chain from real-rate differentials, terms of trade, productivity, BoP/policy reactions to inflation dynamics, then to policy normalization and equity pricing, and tie the CPI anchors (baseline 0.30%–0.40% MoM; tail risks >0.40%) to S&P risk premia and sector tilts; avoid non-derivative color and ensure every claim cites a source ID (GB4W1L6J1, RHFWI02JT, SGB2PAZGK, 22PL3Q360, 2QRLB974F, YVQU6QCY4, WISLWAJ15, 6OOEK8TUR) so conflicts can be reconciled. Quantify and source: keep the numeric anchors and probabilities, map them to regime outcomes (e.g., regime probabilities p1/p2/p3 with p1+p2+p3≈1), and present how multiples, credit spreads, and sector tilts shift under each path. Recast the near-term section (0–3 weeks) as a watch-list of explicit signals and invalidations rather than narrative color, converting Perez’s pricing observations into trigger thresholds (e.g., if international arrivals or perks signals diverge by X, or if pricing power remains elevated Y weeks) with clear invalidation criteria. Finally, ensure the output remains 4–6 sentences and that the catalysts, risks, and watch items are explicit, numerically anchored, and traceable to the cited sources, with a concise, decision-useful mapping to the ABT/ABBV/PFE income thesis and the regime framework.",
