  "content": "The Georgia officer killed when a deranged gunman opened fire from a building across from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters was known for his deep commitment to serving his community, leaving behind a pregnant wife and three children, police said.\n\nThe DeKalb County cop, whose identity has not been released, was shot when the assailant stormed into a CVS on the Emory University campus in Atlanta around 4:50 p.m. and unleashed a barrage of bullets at nearby CDC buildings.\n\nThe heroic officer was rushed to a nearby hospital, where he was surrounded by his family as he succumbed to his injuries.\n\n\u201cIt is with profound sadness that we announced the loss of the life of one of our very own DeKalb County police officers,\u201d Interim Chief of Police Greg Padrick told reporters Friday night.\n\n\u201cThis officer responded to the call as he was trained to do and during that incident, he received gunfire and he lost his life in this incident.\u201d\n\nPadrick added the fallen officer was committed to serving his community, and gave his life with the dedication to serving others.\n\n\u201cThis evening, there is a wife without a husband,\u201d DeKalb County CEO Lorraine Cochran-Johnson told reporters Friday night.\n\n\u201cThere are three children, one unborn, without a father. There is a mother and a father, as well as siblings who also share in this traumatic loss. Let\u2019s join together to give this family the support it needs during this traumatic loss.\u201d\n\nAuthorities confirmed that no other civilians were injured in his hooting and there is no longer an active threat.\n\nThe gunman also died after being struck by gunfire, though police are unsure if his fatal wound was self-inflicted.\n\nLaw enforcement sources told CNN the shooter likely targeted the CDC after he became sick with an apparent illness he blamed on the COVID-19 vaccine, according to police interviews with the suspect\u2019s family.\n\nEmory University issued an urgent alert shortly after 5 p.m., reporting an active shooter near the Emory Point CVS on campus and urging all students to \u201cRUN\u201d and \u201cHIDE.\u201d\n\nLocal, state and federal officers swarmed the harrowing scene, with chilling photos shared on social media showing bullet holes piercing the windows of the CDC\u2019s building, located right next to the University.\n\nAtlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said the alleged shooter sprayed multiple rounds at law enforcement and the health agency, which also houses a daycare caring for 92 children, all of whom were unharmed.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to come give you this message that all the children are safe and that we will be making sure that you get reunited with them as soon as possible,\u201d Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said at a news conference.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a parent as well. I know your uncertainty and your fear and concern has been high.\u201d\n\nOne police cruiser at the scene also appeared to have been hit by about a dozen gunshots to its windshield and hood.\n\nThe CDC Atlanta campus was on lockdown following the shooting.",
