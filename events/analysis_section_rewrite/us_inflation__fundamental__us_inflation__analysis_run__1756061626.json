      "feedback": "Strong start tying AI-driven productivity, displacement risks, and policy debates to multi‑year macro dynamics, but to reach world‑class quality you need a tighter, first‑principles regime map and tighter calibration. Actionable edits: (1) Add explicit multi‑year regime anchors and transition rules (e.g., Regime A: AI-enabled productivity uplift dominates; Regime B: displacement pressures outpace productivity gains; Regime C: policy design, including targeted income/occupational re‑training, begins to lean the regime toward stability). State invariant anchors (e.g., real growth impulse from productivity p, labor supply frictions, policy reaction function r(π, u), terms of trade/BoP implications of trade/tech shifts) and specify the regime transition conditions with simple thresholds (e.g., unemployment claims U, labor-force participation LFP, and capex intensity) to tie to market pricing. (2) Strengthen the causal chain with first‑principles logic: AI adoption drives firm-level capex, profitability, and equity prices via sustained productivity uplift; but sectoral reallocation, supply-chain bottlenecks, and capital‑intensity imply lags and volatility; translate into a transmission ladder (AI improvement → capex intensity and sector mix → earnings and ROIC → stock multiples and duration of repricing). (3) Expand numeric anchoring across sources: quote Brookings’ 25% exposure figure verbatim and translate into plausible unemployment/participation ranges in each regime; but also ground Ford’s cyclicality and EV losses as near‑term hedges against a macro downturn; cite 17% YTD Ford rise, 1.3B EV Q2 operating loss, and 10.3x forward P/E with 5.18% dividend as sensitivities to macro shocks (22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW); embed Yale tariff impact (~$3,800 per household per year) and the 3–5% long‑run withdrawal risk into a single macro‑path scenario; and use ROIC (Walmart example 11.8% in 2022) and total‑return framing to quantify how equity income versus price appreciation could evolve (YVQU6QCY4, 4, 6). (4) Make the base case, risks, and “watch” list explicit and regime‑dependent: base case should specify a probabilistic path with a 1–2 notch range for AI‑driven growth (e.g., long‑run GDP growth 2.0–2.5% with an incremental productivity uplift of 0.2–0.5 pp/yr over 5–10 years), plus a nonzero but care‑weighted risk of policy missteps; key risks should include tariff/inflation shocks, a stubbornly slow EV transition, and a mis‑targeted UBI design that worsens identity/mental‑health dynamics; and watch indicators should be unemployment claims, LFP trends, EV capex pace and cost, tariff pass‑through, and active contrarian bets (as a test of regime resilience, per IGP1Q4ZEJ). (5) Tighten format to SECTION FOCUS by adding a clean execution: a short regime diagram, a base‑case narrative with explicit numbers, a list of catalysts/triggers and invalidation signals, followed by the watch list and a credibility/conﬁdence assessment; ensure every factual claim tied to a source uses an ID (e.g., NL5YYTLF2 for identity/UBI critique, 22PL3Q360 for Ford EV/cycle risk, YVQU6QCY4 for tariff impact, IGP1Q4ZEJ for Burry’s as‑contrast signal, 4 and 6 for total return/ROIC math). (6) Reconcile conflicts and avoid overreach: acknowledge the Finland UBI result as cited in NL5YYTLF2 but bracket its interpretation within a broader literature and emphasize identity effects documented there; present a balanced view of policy efficacy versus psychological costs. (7) Improve precision by avoiding generic phrasing; whenever you say “regimes will shape,” attach a concrete range or trigger and quantify the transmission channel (e.g., “if AI‑driven TFP growth adds 0.2–0.5 pp to trend growth and capex expands 3–6%/yr, equity multiples for structurally advantaged franchises rise 1.5–2.5x over 3–5 years”). (8) Ensure citation discipline: every quantitative assertion should be tethered to one of the seven IDs above, and avoid introducing non‑source numbers; keep the set of critical sources covered and reconcile any apparent conflicts in a dedicated short caveats box. Implementing these edits will produce a coherent, testable, multi‑year framework with explicit regimes, transition triggers, and disciplined, source‑based quantification.",
