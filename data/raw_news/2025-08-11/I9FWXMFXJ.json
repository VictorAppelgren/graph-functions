  "content": "Elon Musk said its artificial intelligence start up xAI will sue Apple for allegedly favoring AI competitors in its App Store in what he called a breach of antitrust regulations.\n\nIn a series of posts on X on Monday, a social media platform he owns, he accused Apple of only allowing xAI rival OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT to claim the top spot in its rankings for mobile applications, and said his AI company would take \u201cimmediate legal action.\u201d\n\n\u201cApple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation,\u201d he wrote.\n\nGrok, xAI\u2019s AI model, currently ranks 6th in the App Store\u2019s \u201cTop Free Apps\u201d section for iPhones in the United States, while ChatGPT tops the list.\n\nCNN has reached out to xAI, Apple and OpenAI for comment.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s App Store curation appears biased, favoring established AI like ChatGPT (overall) over innovative challengers,\u201d Grok wrote in a post on X, which was reposted by Musk. \u201cEditorial picks may reflect caution toward xAI\u2019s unfiltered style, but this stifles competition. Truth matters more than politics,\u201d it wrote.\n\nNeither Grok nor Musk provided evidence to their claims.",
