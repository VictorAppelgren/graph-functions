  "title": "Hurricane Erin: Mass. beaches closed as powerful storm brings huge waves, treacherous rip currents",
  "description": "Areas under a high surf advisory could see waves surge up to 20 feet, forecasters warned.",
  "content": "Several Massachusetts beaches have been closed to swimming as monstrous Hurricane Erin moves north in the Atlantic Ocean, churning up high surf and treacherous rip currents.\n\nThe closures affect several beaches along the southern coast of the Bay State, with Horseneck Beach in Westport prominently displaying signs prohibiting entry to the parking lot.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a forecast warning of rip currents that can pull swimmers away from the shore and into deep water, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey reminded residents.\n\n\u201cI want to urge everyone on our coasts to stay safe and alert as we expect to experience some effects of the storm passing offshore,\u201d Healey said in a statement. \u201cRip currents and high surfs are a serious threat to swimmers. Please be careful while the storm passes through our region and keep an eye out for neighbors who might need assistance.\u201d\n\nMany of the Department of Conservation and Recreation beaches are within the \u201cHigh Risk\u201d area of the NWS\u2019s surf zone forecast. High surf advisories are currently in effect through Friday and could extend into the weekend.\n\nHurricane Erin battered North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks with strong winds and waves that flooded part of the main highway and surged under beachfront homes on Wednesday.\n\nWhile Erin won\u2019t make landfall in New England, forecasters said it could regain strength and once again become a major hurricane, Category 3 or greater, on its trek north.\n\nErin remained a Category 2 hurricane early Thursday with maximum sustained winds around 105 mph. It\u2019s tropical storm-force winds spread across 500 miles, roughly the distance from New York City to Pittsburgh.\n\nThe NWS has issued a high surf advisory for Essex, Plymouth, Bristol, Dukes, Nantucket, and Barnstable counties through Saturday at 8 p.m.\n\nIn the impacted surf zones, the NWS warned of large breaking waves anywhere from 4 to 20 feet in height.\n\nWave heights are expected to peak on Thursday night, and the presence of double red flags on the beach indicates that swimming is strictly prohibited.\n\n\u201cThose waves out there are super powerful, but also what they\u2019re doing is paving a path for rip currents,\u201d DCR lifeguard Jillian Boyle said. \u201cAs these waves are crashing on shore, they\u2019re creating those narrow channels. That\u2019s going to be what we\u2019re going to start to see over the coming days and even after the storm has passed us, these really nasty rip currents.\u201d\n\nOfficials urged inexperienced swimmers to remain out of the water due to the dangerous surf conditions\n\nFlooding is possible along the coast\n\nA coastal flood advisory has also been issued for the same areas through early Saturday morning.\n\n\u201cIf travel is required, allow extra time as some roads may be closed. Do not drive around barricades or through water of unknown depth. Take the necessary actions to protect flood-prone property,\u201d the NWS advised.\n\nFishermen and boaters urged to use caution\n\nThe Division of Marine Fisheries is urging shore-based anglers to be vigilant of high surf conditions that can make areas unsafe for fishing. Mariners should also review marine forecasts.\n\nA gale watch will be in effect Thursday morning through late Friday night. Boaters should consider altering plans to avoid reduced visibility and potentially damaging winds.\n\nWind advisory for the Cape and the Islands\n\nGusty winds will also be a factor, especially Friday into Saturday.\n\nA wind advisory is in effect until 2 p.m. Friday for Barnstable, Nantucket, and Dukes counties.\n\nNortheast winds 15 to 25 mph with gusts up to 45 mph are expected.\n\n\u201cGusty winds will blow around unsecured objects. Tree limbs could be blown down, and some power outages may result,\u201d the NWS warned. \u201cWinds this strong can make driving difficult, especially for high-profile vehicles.\u201d\n\nThe Boston 25 Weather team will continue to track Erin, providing updates online and on-air.\n\nFollow Boston 25 News on Facebook and Twitter. | Watch Boston 25 News NOW",
