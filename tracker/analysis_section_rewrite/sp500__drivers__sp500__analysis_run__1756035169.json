      "feedback": "The draft conveys a plausible base-case but needs a tighter, methodical causal chain, explicit horizon framing, and numeric scaffolding to reach world-class quality. Actionable edits: (1) Rebuild the core chain with explicit, testable steps: Cloud/AI capex expands durable platform moats → higher revenue visibility and operating leverage → premium multiples; ecosystem leverage drives faster cross-sell and margin expansion; policy easing lowers discount rates → re-rating, all tied to quantifiable anchors (Shopify H1 metrics and Azure momentum as input, not just context). Tie each link to a specific source (e.g., Shopify H1 2025: GMV +27% to $163B, revenue +29%, op income +51%; Azure +39%, contracted revenue ≈$368B; 10Y yield context and dividend yields) and avoid generic wording. (2) Distinguish horizon-specific drivers and add a formal scenario tree: Base case (policy easing with data-dependent timing), bull (earlier-than-expected easing with stronger AI capex signal) and bear (deterioration in CPI/payroll or cross-asset shocks). For each, specify the mechanism and near-term catalysts. (3) Flesh out first-principles grounding: state the fundamental math of discount-rate compression vs. earnings growth, quantify margin and capex leverage using the ACMR data (2025 revenue 850–950m; gross margin ~49%; debt/equity ~23%), and connect to net present value/EV implications. (4) Quantify and use numbers/ranges from sources throughout, replacing vague claims with concrete ranges and sensitivity: e.g., 25bp vs 50bp rate cuts; 4.23% 10Y level; 1.8–2.2% dividend yield; 12–18% justness premium; include the exact numeric implications where feasible rather than qualitative statements. (5) Tighten citation discipline and reconcile conflicts: attach each datum to the correct IDs (QFDWCTAYB; 0G3A; GX057ADL7; SK994CBWR; TN66GHPAT; 4LQD15CFU; 5S9GJV2O3; UVEQ2SJ0W; HWGNUP2XG) and note any tensions (e.g., policy-driven re-rating vs. cross-asset shocks from EURUSD). (6) Elevate the watch-list to decisive signals: CPI/payroll prints, Fed guidance/timing of the Sept cut, ACMR 2025 trajectory, IBM hiring pause signals, Shopify/Microsoft updates, and any EURUSD regime shifts affecting risk premia; present as a compact, single-sentence trigger set with conditional paths. (7) Improve prose economy and remove redundancies: avoid repeated citations in close proximity, reduce repetition of the same data points, and ensure each assertion is tightly linked to a source. These edits will yield a clearer causal narrative, sharper horizon alignment, richer quantitative rigor, and a robust, source-backed watch-list.",
