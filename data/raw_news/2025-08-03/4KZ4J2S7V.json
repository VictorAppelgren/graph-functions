  "content": "5 Of The Best Pickup Trucks To Come Out Of The 1960s\n\nCars come in all shapes and sizes \u2014 hatchbacks, sedans, SUVs, MUVs, coupes, convertibles, and pickup trucks. and more \u2014 each serving its purpose. Among these, pickup trucks are so popular in the U.S. that they are a fixture of America's automotive landscape, serving as cultural icons and practical workhorses. The versatility of the pickup lies in delivering incredible power, a rugged nature, all-weather performance, and impressive towing capabilities. These features have earned the pickup a special place in the hearts of Americans. The Ford F-150 has been ruling the U.S. pickup truck market for the last four decades, and, according to Car and Driver, the top two best-selling vehicles of 2024 are none other than pickup trucks. The world's first pickup truck \u2013- the Ford Model T Runabout \u2013- was introduced back in 1925 and sold for $281. This pickup truck was so appealing that Ford moved over 33,000 units in the first year of production. Over the period, pickup trucks have evolved into tougher and more capable machines as decades passed. By the 1960s, competition and market demand encouraged automakers to merge heavy-duty performance with the comfort and artistic styling of passenger cars. The result was trucks from the 1960s becoming highly collectible in the modern world. Here are five of the best pickup trucks of the 1960s that defined a generation and laid the foundation of modern-day pickup trucks.\n\nAmerican automobile company Chevrolet has been manufacturing pickup trucks since 1918, with the first model being the Chevy Model 490 Light Delivery. The 1960s marked the beginning of one of its iconic models, the C/K Series pickup trucks. The 'C' in the C/K Series indicated two-wheel drive models, whereas the 'K' denoted four-wheel-drive options. The first-generation model came with an all-new frame, new suspension for a smooth ride, a dropped center frame that made it easier to get in and out of the truck, and introduced independent front suspension, which supplied the C/K Series with car-like handling. The second-generation Chevrolet C/K Series pickup trucks built between 1967 and 1972 brought more innovation. Notably, the second-generation C/K Series was also called the 'Action Line' because not only did it include an upgraded suspension and chassis, but it also introduced luxurious interiors coupled with exteriors featuring modern design language. The second-generation Chevrolet C/K Series pickup trucks were also the first to debut coil-spring rear suspension, improving maneuverability. The second-generation C/K Series was also offered in a variety of engine options, including inline-six and the powerful 327 ci V8 powerplants, and a 4x4 trim for heavy work. For those willing to spend extra money, Chevrolet offered luxury-focused Custom Sport Truck (CST) and Cheyenne trims that added lavish interiors, extra chrome, upgraded seats, and other cosmetic improvements.\n\nFord is practically synonymous with pickup trucks, especially in the U.S. One of the oldest car makers in the world, Ford has produced the F-series pickup trucks since 1948, and is still going strong. The Ford F-series has remained an incredibly popular pickup truck, maintaining the title of best-selling pickup truck in the U.S. for the past 48 years. The Ford F-100 (known as the F-1 at that time) series pickup truck is one of the most iconic Ford models ever built, and the first generation debuted back in 1948. The pickup truck was Ford's response to the growing demand for family-oriented utility vehicles in the booming and industrious post-war era. With the introduction of the second generation, Ford changed the nomenclature from F1 to F-100, rumored to be in honor of the U.S. Air Force's first supersonic fighter jet, the F-100 Super Sabre. Fast forward to 1961, and Ford introduced the fourth-generation F-100 with a unibody design that integrated the bed and cab, eliminating the gap between the two and offering more cargo space than previous models. This design made assembly much easier and less expensive to produce for Ford. However, this unibody design was short-lived because it flexed a lot when carrying heavy loads, causing the doors to remain locked. This prompted Ford to discontinue the unibody design in 1964. The new model received changes such as a 1-inch higher roof, a new grille, and an all-new bed. With the 1965 model, Ford introduced twin-I-beam suspension with a slogan, \"Drives like a car, works like a truck.\"\n\nJeep, which has been producing vehicles for over 80 years, was formed to help the American military transport things from one place to another, function as an ambulance, house machine guns, serve as a radio car, and do everything the army demands. Now part of the Stellantis group and with a host of legendary nameplates under its name, Jeep continues to produce some of the best off-roading vehicles for modern-day enthusiasts. However, the best pickup truck from Jeep to come out in the 1960s is the Jeep Gladiator J Series. Jeep used the name Gladiator for its first full-size pickup trucks, introduced in 1963, sharing its platform, styling, and engine options with the Wagoneer. The Gladiator was available in two variants: the J-200 (120-inch wheelbase) and J-300 (126-inch wheelbase), with strong four-wheel drive parts such as Dana 44 axles and a Dana 20 transfer case. In 1965, Jeep changed the names, and the J-200 and J-300 came to be known as the J-2000 and J-3000, respectively, and were available in two- and four-wheel drive options. The J-series trucks were offered with powertrains like the Jeep Hi-Torque 6 and the optional Vigilante V8. Jeep dropped the Gladiator name in 1971, switching to the J-Series until 1987. The Gladiator name returned in 2019, and its latest 2025 model is packed with all the latest features and technology in several trim options.\n\nToyota began trickling its reliability down to the Hilux in March 1968, and it earned a reputation as the most reliable and indestructible pickup truck ever. Currently in its eighth generation, the Toyota Hilux has sold over 19 million units. Interestingly, the car was manufactured outside of Toyota, by Hino Motors, Ltd., in Japan. The first-generation model came equipped with a 1.5-liter engine. Fun fact: The name 'Hilux' is a portmanteau of two words: high and luxury. While the first production model had a short wheelbase, just over a year later, in April 1969, Toyota introduced the Hilux with a long wheelbase model with a 2,250 mm-long bed. The first-generation Hilux had a payload capacity of 1,000 kg and was 1,850 mm long. In 1971, the Toyota Hilux with a 1.6-liter engine and 83 hp output was introduced. For North America, Toyota launched the Hilux with a very simple name, the 'Toyota Truck,' which was equipped with either a 1.9-liter or 2.0-liter R-series engine, and only the short-wheelbase version with a long bed was available. While the first-generation may not be the best version of the Toyota Hilux, it paved the way for one of the most iconic pickup truck names \u2014 one that remains in production and is as popular as ever.\n\nAfter the success of the Dodge C-Series pickup trucks \u2014 sometimes considered among the best-looking trucks of their time \u2014 Dodge introduced the all-new D-Series. This lineup featured a redesigned chassis, body, and engine compared to the C-Series. Dodge offered the D-Series pickup trucks in multiple powertrains, including inline-six or V8 engines. It was also available in different cargo and bed lengths, allowing customers to select the pickup truck as per their needs. Interestingly, Dodge offered the D-Series trucks in Custom Sports Special trim that featured a 7-liter Wedge V8 engine (which was quite maintenance hungry), pumping 365 hp. The improved suspension helped the pickup truck handle all the power. Looking back, many consider this model an early performance pickup truck. The second-generation D-Series included the D100, D200, and D300, some of the most beloved trucks to come out of the 1960s. The D100 was the full-size pickup, good for everyday tasks. For heavy-duty tasks, the D200 and D300 were the ones to go for, as they were built with commercial use and construction work in mind. Dodge gave six engine options along with four trim packages to choose from for the second-generation Dodge D-Series pickups. In mid-1965, Dodge restyled the D100, and it was made available in four and two-headlight options. The 383 V8 engine became the standard by 1967, and in 1968, the D100 again got style treatment and now featured an eight-hole front grille for a bolder appearance.",

      "text": "Every Toyota Hilux Generation Ranked Worst To Best\nSince its introduction in 1968, the Toyota Hilux has garnered a global reputation as one of the most dependable pickup trucks ever produced. This distinguished status has been forged over a span of more than 55 years, during which millions of Hilux trucks have been sold worldwide.\nThe name Hilux itself is derived from the combination of high and luxury, a title it has truly earned in contemporary times. Originating as a modest work truck, the Hilux has since evolved into a powerful luxury vehicle renowned for its exceptional comfort, consistent reliability, and impressive strength. It has gained the trust of companies and families alike in challenging terrain, ensuring safety and security. In remarkable instances, the Hilux has even served as a reliable combat vehicle.\nThe Toyota Hilux has changed in a lot of big ways over its history, which now spans eight distinct generations. While some iterations featured more substantial improvements than others, every generation contributed unique advancements. We're taking a look at every Toyota Hilux generation and then ranking them from worst to best, looking at overall improvements over preceding generations, drivability, reliability, and the profound impact each Hilux had on the automotive industry.\n8. 1st Generation (1968-1972)\nThe first-generation Hilux marks the beginning of an iconic legacy. Created as a replacement for the Toyota Stout, the initial version of the Hilux was designated as the RN10 model.\nEquipped with Toyota's R series 1.5-liter straight-4 engine that produced 76 hp, the Hilux RN10 boasted a hauling capacity of approximately 1,000 kg. Its design featured a 2-door, rear-wheel drive configuration with a compact cab. If you compare it to today's modern trucks, you're likely to be sorely disappointed, but this venerable vehicle saw service in the late 60s and early 70s. Not only were these specs rather impressive at the time, but they were also the foundation of reliability that would be one of the defining features of the Hilux.\nThe birth of the Hilux legend and its unwavering dependability can be traced back to this inaugural generation. While it remains an extraordinary vehicle cherished by collectors, subsequent generations have consistently improved upon its foundation. Considering the era it thrived in, the RN10 Hilux excelled in terms of specifications, capabilities, and reliability, making it one of the most trustworthy trucks of its time.\nOver the course of its lifespan, the RN10 received an upgraded 1.6-liter engine and underwent minor improvements that would eventually allow it to make up to 109 hp. Even today, a functional RN10 is highly sought after by classic car enthusiasts and devoted Hilux fans. However, it is worth noting that the first generation ranks lower simply because Toyota has continuously refined and enhanced the original design, leaving the RN10 unable to compete with its successors.\n7. 6th Generation (1997-2004)\nThe sixth generation of the Hilux, encompassing models N140, N150, N160, and N170, represented a significant step in the Hilux lineage. The September 1997 launch of the sixth generation Hilux brought forth two distinct lines: a truck line tailored for commercial purposes and a sports pickup line designed for personal use. In November, an additional model, the extra cab, was introduced. This open-deck multi-purpose vehicle could be configured with a long cargo bed or two seats in the rear cabin area.\nWhile not particularly groundbreaking, the sixth generation was good for consumers as Toyota began advancing its designs toward a more modern aesthetic. In terms of mechanical components, the transition from the fifth to the sixth generation brought about minimal changes. The engine and internal workings remained largely unchanged. Instead, the focus shifted towards enhancing the size and comfort of the vehicle. Toyota recognized the potential for the Hilux to cater to the multi-purpose vehicle market.\nThese improvements resulted in a noteworthy upgrade, rendering the Hilux significantly more comfortable for everyday driving. Driveability and comfort were enhanced without compromising its inherent utility as a pickup truck. Nevertheless, when compared to the advancements seen in other generations of the Hilux, the changes implemented in the sixth generation were relatively minor and, although they provided increased comfort, weren't particularly exciting.\n6. 3rd Generation (1978-1983)\nDrivers in the USA would be forgiven for not remembering the Hilux name or even thinking that America may have banned the Hilux due to their relative rarity. However, the truth is that by the third generation, the Hilux was rebranded as the Toyota Pickup for marketing purposes within the United States.\nDesignated as the N30 and N40 models, the third-generation Hilux was the first iteration to offer 4-wheel drive options. However, this feature was exclusively available on models equipped with Toyota 2-liter engines (such as the 18R) or larger. Smaller engines remained an option but were limited to rear-wheel drive configurations.\nThis generation is often likened to a reliable tool, comparable to a sturdy wrench or a traditional set of drill bits. When treated properly, they have remarkable durability and longevity. The third-generation Hilux is renowned for its outstanding reliability. Those lucky enough to find one that hasn't been left to the elements will find that the third-generation Hilux is a workhorse vehicle that still performs. At this point in time, however, many third-gen Hiluxes will have rust damage or need replacement parts. Still, they remain widely available and relatively cheap.\nComfort is not a strong suit of the third-gen Hilux. While the cab size surpasses that of its predecessor, it remains pretty bare bones in nature. This design approach aligns with its intended purpose as a functional work truck and not much more.\n5. 2nd Generation (1972-1978)\nThe second generation is where you start to see the Hilux develop the reliability, comfort, and drive that it's known for today. This generation was known as the N20 model. The difference between the first generation and the second generation is night and day.\nSince the initial design of the Hilux drew heavily from the Briska and Stout truck lines, it wasn't until the second generation that the defining characteristics of the compact truck truly emerged. Produced from 1972 to 1978, the N20 featured an overall larger frame compared to its predecessor, the RN10. The introduction of several new engine options further enhanced its versatility, although the most common was the 2-liter 18R engine, although this was also the first model to also include the smaller 1.6-liter engine with an automatic transmission.\nIt was during this second generation that the Hilux name was first dropped in favor of the Toyota Truck or Pickup. No matter its name, the N20 swiftly gained a reputation as a reliable small truck that proved ideal for daily use, particularly among industrial workers. One of the major improvements in this generation was the interior cab. Toyota prioritized overall comfort by enlarging the cab and equipping it with more comfortable seats. This shift in design philosophy transformed the Hilux from a purely commercial vehicle into a hybrid truck that catered to both personal and commercial needs.\n4. 4th Generation (1983-1988)\nThe fourth generation of Hilux comprises models N50, N60, and N70, all of which played a significant role in converting non-Hilux enthusiasts into ardent fans. This generation, particularly the N50, solidified its legendary status as one of the most durable commercially available trucks in the world thanks in part to three individuals: James May, Richard Hammond, and Jeremy Clarkson.\nThe esteemed hosts of \"Top Gear\" decided to subject the reputation of the N50 Hilux to an extreme test. They found an N50 model Hilux with an impressive mileage of approximately 190,000 miles on the odometer and launched a relentless mission to push the Hilux to its limits. The N50 Hilux was set on fire, subjected to multiple crashes, driven off ledges, and even left atop a building earmarked for demolition. Despite all the punishment inflicted upon it, the Hilux engine managed to start and continue running. Undoubtedly battered and bruised, the Hilux remained resilient and survived the ordeal.\nFew other trucks have been subjected to such an extraordinary spectacle, and even fewer would have been able to withstand such destruction. This remarkable display of durability is why the fourth-generation Hilux, to this day, remains one of the most sought-after and globally acclaimed vehicles renowned for its reliability.\nOf course, there's one other name mentioned in reference to the fourth generation Hilux \u2014 Marty McFly, the fictional character played by Micheal J. Fox, who receives a fourth generation Hilux at the end of \"Back to the Future.\"\n3. 7th Generation (2004-2015)\nThe seventh generation of Hilux, comprising the AN10, AN20, and AN30 models, represented a notable leap in size compared to its predecessor. This increase in size allowed Toyota to revamp the interiors, prioritizing comfort for drivers and passengers. This generation was part of Toyota's Innovative International Multi-Purpose Vehicle project (IMV), which aimed to optimize global production processes by utilizing a common platform to create different products. The seventh-generation Hilux is one of the models resulting from this endeavor.\nWhile the seventh generation embraced modern amenities and conveniences by catering to the needs of everyday drivers, it still provided options for heavy towing and raw power. One engine option included a rugged 4-liter V6 engine, while another option catered to users seeking the strength of up to a 3-liter diesel engine.\nThe remarkable capabilities of the Hilux caught the attention of the television show \"Top Gear\" once again, prompting them to subject a modified seventh-generation Hilux to another demanding test. This time, they successfully drove the vehicle to the North Pole. In a subsequent episode, the same Hilux underwent further modifications and achieved the extraordinary feat of driving up an active volcano, reaching its summit. From extreme cold to intense heat, the Hilux consistently exceeded expectations under the most extreme conditions.\nIn 2012, a modified version of the seventh-generation Hilux also participated in the grueling Dakar Rally. Giniel de Villiers demonstrated exceptional performance throughout the rally, consistently placing in the top three with this generation of the Hilux.\n2. 8th Generation (2015-Present)\nThe eighth generation of Hilux, comprising the AN110, AN120, and AN130 models, represents the latest iteration of this iconic vehicle. Toyota has skillfully blended new technologies with the Hilux's well-established reputation for reliability, delivering a generation that embodies its vision of \"redefining toughness.\"\nToyota went beyond mere specifications and engine power in pursuit of this goal, taking a holistic approach to the design of the Hilux while considering the needs of the driver. Toyota focused heavily on redesigning the cab for safety and comfort. The eighth-generation Hilux models boast larger dimensions and offer objectively greater luxury and comfort. This redesign was prompted by a keen understanding of drivers who rely on the Hilux as a work vehicle, often spending long hours behind the wheel.\nIn addition, visibility within the cab was enhanced, taking into account the demands of city driving. This impressive generation places a strong focus on enhancing the overall user experience, and the results speak for themselves. The eighth-generation Hilux received the prestigious 6th International Pick-Up Award for 2022/2023, serving as a testament to its technological advancements, exceptional comfort, and enduring reputation of reliability over five decades in the making.\nThe eighth and most recent generation Hilux stands as the culmination of Toyota's commitment to excellence, blending cutting-edge technology with the utmost consideration for driver satisfaction and the demands of a wide range of driving scenarios.\n1. 5th Generation (1988-1997)\nThe fifth generation Hilux includes the N80, N90, N100, and N110 models. To this day, the fifth generation is still one of the best versions out there. This wasn't the most comfortable, strongest, or fastest Hilux on the market \u2014 but it's the embodiment of what a truck should be.\nThe fifth-gen Hilux is an indestructible beast on the road, displaying remarkable durability. It set itself apart from competitors by employing a complete box frame, a design choice that rendered it substantially stronger than other offerings in the market. Combined with Toyota's renowned reputation, this feature contributed to its immense popularity, particularly as a reliable work truck.\nFor outdoor enthusiasts seeking adventure in off-roading and trailblazing capabilities, the Hilux became an easy choice. The fifth-generation Hilux could take a beating no matter what task drivers wanted it for, and it usually came out the other side unscathed. Furthermore, when repairs were necessary, the fifth-generation Hilux was known for its ease of maintenance and repairability.\nWhile newer Hilux models have emerged, offering increased speed, strength, and comfort, the fifth generation remains a true embodiment of what a truck should be. It exuded reliability, provided an enjoyable driving experience, and proved its longevity over time. Despite the presence of more advanced alternatives, the fifth-generation Hilux retains its timeless appeal as a rugged and enduring companion."

      "text": "The history of the Toyota Hilux spans eight generations, during which the pick-up has earned a reputation as one of the world\u2019s most trusted and reliable commercial vehicles. Having survived extreme environments in the Arctic and Antarctic \u2013 and all points in between \u2013 the credentials of this ultra-tough machine are proven beyond doubt.\nIt has sold more than 19 million units, while it remains Europe\u2019s most popular pick-up with sales just shy of 36,000 units in 2018.\nYet despite its no-nonsense approach, the Hilux package has gradually developed over the years to become a complete motoring solution, bridging the gap between work use and everyday driving needs.\nHistory of the Toyota Hilux: Partnership agreement\nTechnically, the history of the Toyota Hilux begins outside of Toyota Motor Corporation. Its roots are found in the Briska line of small pick-ups made by Japanese commercial vehicle manufacturer Hino Motors since 1961. Toyota\u2019s history with pick-ups dates back to the SB model of 1947 but halfway through production of the second-generation Briska, Toyota partnered with Hino Motors and pushed forward minor model improvements.\nThe Hino Briska was renamed the Toyota Briska from 1967, signalling a refocusing of the Hino brand towards production of medium- to heavy-duty commercial vehicles instead.\nHistory of the Toyota Hilux: Arrival of the fittest\nIt was March 1968 when Toyota dealerships in Japan took delivery of the first genuine Toyota Hilux pick-up. This new model bore the N10 chassis code, and although it was conceived by Toyota, the new Hilux continued to be engineered and built at Hino Motors\u2019 Hamura Plant.\nUpon its launch, the Hilux swelled Toyota\u2019s light-duty pick-up range from two to three separate models, the new pick-up joining the existing Corona and Masterline (Crown). The latter two were car-based derivatives and Toyota swiftly phased them out to create space between Toyota\u2019s light commercial vehicle range and its passenger cars.\nThe new Hilux \u2013 its name a contraction of \u2018high\u2019 and \u2018luxury\u2019 \u2013 utilised a separate frame construction with a double wishbone/coil spring suspension set up at the front and rigid axle/leaf spring arrangement at the rear.\nAt the outset, the Toyota Hilux began as a short-wheelbase model powered by a four-cylinder 1.5-litre R-series petrol engine with a column-shift, four-speed manual gearbox driving the rear wheels. Just over a year into production in April 1969, the Hilux range grew (literally) to include a long-wheelbase model. February 1971 witnessed the arrival of a gutsier 1.6-litre version that replaced the base engine. Passenger capacity was for three people sat abreast on a bench seat.\nFor the important North American market, Toyota made some unique changes. To begin with, the Hilux name wasn\u2019t used \u2013 instead, the pick-up was simply badged as the \u2018Toyota Truck\u2019 to prevent confusion over its name and purpose. The American market received larger 1.9- or 2.0-litre R-series powerplants, and only the short-wheelbase chassis with its 1.85m long bed was offered to buyers.\nHistory of the Toyota Hilux: More comfortable stretch\nThe second-generation Hilux was launched in May 1972 for the 1973 model year, and marked the model\u2019s introduction to the UK market. Essentially a reworked version of its predecessor, the N20 series featured an updated body with slightly extended wheelbases, more comfortable interior and carry-over engine range.\nAlso improved for the second-generation were Hilux\u2019s safety features \u2013 it now had servo-assisted dual brake master cylinders and load-sensing brake proportioning valves. And soon after launch, the North American market saw the introduction of a long-wheelbase model with a 2.25m loading bed (see comparison below between N10 and N20 series load bays). A column-mounted four-speed manual gearbox was the standard transmission setup, though buyers were now able to specify a floor-mounted gearshift, deleting the three-person bench in favour of two individual seats.\nA higher specification model was introduced to some markets from 1974 onwards, offering a more powerful 2.0-litre R-series engine and optional three-speed automatic gearbox, the first of its kind ever fitted to the Hilux.\nThis move upmarket was mirrored in the US in 1975 with the introduction of a larger 2.2-litre motor and SR5 trim designation, along with the option of a five-speed manual gearbox. In October 1975 the 2.0-litre engine was deleted in all other markets, consolidating the Hilux to one 1.6-litre unit to meet new emissions standards.\nHistory of the Toyota Hilux: Versatile equipment\nVersatility was the watchword for the third-generation N30/40 series Hilux when it went on sale in September 1978. Regardless of model \u2013 there were now three standard-length and four long-wheelbase derivatives \u2013 the third-gen Hilux was designed to offer saloon-like specification and ride comfort. This led to an evolution of the predecessor\u2019s double wishbone front suspension that replaced the coil springs for a torsion bar.\nSignificantly, a new top-of-the-range Super Deluxe model was introduced from launch; its extended cab was 90mm longer than standard, significantly improving interior space. The Super Deluxe was later supplemented with a full double-cab version with four doors and two rows of seats. All higher-grade models received front disc brakes as standard, and buyers could now specify a Toyota-embossed tailgate. Many of these improvements were borne out of Toyota\u2019s careful study of the US market, where the Truck routinely doubled as a passenger car and leisure vehicle. Even the cover of the Japanese brochure for the Hilux proclaimed that it was \u201cborn in Japan, raised in the US\u201d.\nThe new dual-purpose nature of Hilux was reinforced by the first four-wheel drive model in October 1979, which adopted the driveline and gearbox transfer case from the 40-series Land Cruiser allied to a reworked version of the now-reinstated 2.0-litre R-series petrol engine. Diesel power followed with a 2.2-litre L-series engine, available for the first time in both rear- and four-wheel drive formats.\nToyota further emphasised Hilux\u2019s lifestyle usage in 1981 when the maker partnered with Winnebago Industries and two other vehicle body manufacturers in the US market to produce SUV-type recreational vehicles. Based on the four-wheel drive Truck chassis cab, these companies added different fibreglass bodies to the steel framework around the rear wheels.\nIn fact, the success of these early walkthrough conversions led directly to Toyota\u2019s launch of the Hilux-based 4Runner and Hilux Surf station wagon models which appeared early in the fourth-generation\u2019s life cycle.\nHistory of the Toyota Hilux: Hilux meets SUV\nToyota released the fourth-generation Hilux in November 1983, and for a while it was available alongside its predecessor, which remained on sale in the domestic market as a rear-wheel drive base model.\nHowever, the newer generation vehicle was immediately characterised from its older sibling by attractively blistered arches and a renewed interior. What didn\u2019t change was its reputation for near-indestructibility; a fact that was underlined by BBC Top Gear in its unsuccessful attempts to \u2018kill\u2019 one hard-worked example.\nSingle- and double-cab versions were available from launch, including a new raised-bed model with three bottom-hinged sides. These additions increased the number of Hilux variations from 17 to 20.\nBuyers of rear-wheel drive models could choose from four engines \u2013 1.6- or 1.8-litre petrol, and 2.2- or 2.4-litre diesel \u2013 while four-wheel drive models used either a 2.0-litre petrol or the largest 2.4-litre diesel.\nSince the launch of the fourth-generation Hilux, the worldwide market for recreational vehicles had grown exponentially, with SUVs like the Ford Bronco and Nissan Pathfinder suddenly appearing on forecourts.\nToyota reacted swiftly and with simplicity by modifying the short-frame bed of the Hilux, removing the bulkhead from the back of the cab, adding a one-piece fibreglass-reinforced plastic canopy, fitting a bench seat in the back, and softening the rear suspension. Larger engines were fitted, including 2.4-litre turbo and 3.0-litre V6 petrol engines, though the larger dimensions of these units required the development of a wider front track and the switch from a solid front axle to an independent set up.\nThe vehicle that resulted from this unforeseen refresh was launched to the world from May 1984 onwards as either the Hilux Surf (domestic market) or 4Runner \u2013 essentially a three-door station wagon with off-road capability similar to that of the Land Cruiser. Toyota also adopted modifications from the A-pillar forwards throughout the entire Hilux range.\nHistory of the Toyota Hilux: Refining the concept\nSeptember 1988 marked the introduction of the new fifth-generation Hilux, with revised bodywork that represented many visual and physical improvements over the outgoing version.\nBuilt to the three core concepts of power, sturdiness and comfort, the new model\u2019s interior was far more car-like in terms of equipment level and dashboard design. Outside, the exterior bodywork now featured integrated window sashes in the doors and a one-piece loading bay that eliminated the worry about rust developing in the seams.\nFour-wheel drive models received distinctive arch flares that widened the overall body by 40mm, while rear-wheel drive models had a narrower style with traditional flat-sided front wings and rear quarter panels.\nThe engine range similarly differentiated between four- and rear-wheel drive models; the latter either received a new 1.8-litre Y-series petrol or 2.4-litre L-series diesel, the former a gutsier 2.0-litre Y-series or 2.8-litre diesel. Later in the N50\u2019s production the engine range of the rear-wheel drive models was upgraded to match that of the four-wheel drive versions.\nMeanwhile, the 3.0-litre V6 petrol engine was reserved for double-cab models and the second-generation Surf/4Runner. In answer to diversifying customer needs, the number of rear-wheel drive models available with the four-speed automatic gearbox was increased.\nThe second-generation Hilux Surf/4Runner arrived for the 1990 model year, again built on the Hilux platform; indeed, the models were almost identical from the B-pillar forward. However, whereas the first-generation model had a simple FRP structure on top of the pick-up bed, the new car featured a fully integrated steel body with five doors (a three-door was available during the first half of the production cycle but is very rare) and all-new coil sprung rear suspension.\nThis model was discontinued in 1995, and from its third-generation onwards the Hilux Surf/4Runner switched to use the Land Cruiser Prado platform.\nFurther changes were in store for the fifth-generation Hilux across worldwide markets. Toyota forged a partnership with Volkswagen in 1989 to further its presence in Europe, after which the German manufacturer launched the Taro, a barely-disguised badge-engineered version of the Hilux. The decision was also made that when the N50 ceased production, the US market would switch from the Hilux/Truck range to the larger, more genuinely truck-like Tacoma pick-up.\nHistory of the Toyota Hilux: Sixth sense\nWith the multipurpose Hilux Surf/4Runner line now forging ahead independently, Toyota gently refocused the new sixth-generation Hilux pick-up range into two clear branches \u2013 business use and personal use.\nThe range was introduced in Japan in September 1997 and is easily distinguished from previous generation models by a swage line that gently tapers downwards toward the front indicators. Once again it was available with two- or four-wheel drive transmission and either single- or double-cab body configurations. The engine line-up consisted of 2.0- and 2.7-litre four-cylinder petrol units as well as 2.4-litre turbo and 3.0-litre naturally aspirated diesels.\nPersonal-use models were now borderline sporty, equipped with additional equipment and devices to better suit their recreational intentions, such as a longer and taller cabin with improved sound insulation. Business-use models, on the other hand, were more basic and offered lower specification levels.\nThe biggest change for the sixth-generation was that all Hilux models now came with independent front suspension \u2013 the first time in the history of the Toyota Hilux. A solid axle may have been the traditional setup for off-road use but contemporary Land Cruiser models had proved the effectiveness of independence without sacrificing too much suspension travel, while delivering huge improvements in ride quality and handling.\nArguably this development helped the sixth-generation Hilux recapture its lead in the commercial one-ton pick-up market. This status was immortalised in July 2004 when the UK range expanded to include a new high-spec Invincible model, though that may have had something to do with the recent airing of the Top Gear programme mentioned earlier.\nHistory of the Toyota Hilux: Seventh heaven\nBased on a modified version of the previous generation\u2019s ladder frame underpinnings, the seventh-generation Hilux grew significantly in stature to become classified as a mid-size pick-up (the platform was also adapted into an SUV for the Toyota Fortuner model). This change gifted the car with greater road presence, interior space, and load capacity \u2013 all improvements identified from customer reports.\nPerhaps more than any other Hilux generation before it, this seventh iteration saw numerous, successive improvements throughout its life, enabling the model to consistently exceed consumer needs and ever-tightening emissions standards.\nFor instance, soon after its October 2005 launch in the UK, a third body style was inserted between the single-cab two-door and double-cab four-door variants. Called the Extra Cab, it offered seating for four behind just two doors and a longer load bay than that of the traditional double-cab.\nA new twin-cam 3.0-litre 16-valve D-4D diesel engine became available in January 2007 to supplement the existing 2.5-litre D-4D, thereby elevating the entire range to Euro 4 emissions standards.\nSoon afterward, this modern unit was put to the ultimate test of reliability by successfully powering Top Gear\u2019s latest assault on the Hilux\u2019s reputation to the North Magnetic Pole \u2013 a first for any motor vehicle. Further challenges saw the Hilux provide transport for an expedition to the South Pole and climb an erupting volcano in Iceland to retrieve lava samples, both of which it survived. Little wonder the Invincible grade remained available in this generation too.\nA comprehensive re-style was applied in October 2011 for the 2012 model year, encompassing smoother architecture from the A-pillar forwards. Inside, the upper dashboard was new and housed the latest versions of the Toyota Touch multimedia system for all mid- and high-grade models. Finally, the two diesel engines now met Euro 5 emissions regulations while being more powerful and economical than ever before.\nHistory of the Toyota Hilux: Eighth wonder\nBy 2015, Hilux had accumulated 16 million sales worldwide, and even in the last year of production it maintained class dominance in Europe by securing almost one-quarter of all pick-up sales. Toyota clearly had no intention of Hilux losing its reputation as the complete and super-tough motoring solution for its eighth generation.\nAvailable once again in Single Cab, Extra Cab and Double Cab body styles, the new generation Hilux advances the legend and redefines toughness with a stronger ladder chassis, reinforced deck structure, enhanced all-wheel drive capabilities and improved towing capacity.\nAt the same time, it responds to the growth in use of pick-ups for leisure in recent\nyears, offering a contemporary design, higher comfort levels, advanced equipment\nfeatures and improved safety, making it more stylish and stress-free to drive than\never before.\nThe first UK customer deliveries of the new eighth-generation Hilux began on 1 July 2016 and a process of continuous improvement has kept it ahead of the game. The latest Hilux has a larger, stronger and more practical cargo deck and an improved towing capacity of up to 3.5 tonnes.\nThe 2.4-litre D-4D engine delivers improved fuel economy, with combined cycle consumption from 29.12 to 32.47mpg for the Active Single Cab and 28.82 to 29.73mpg for the Invincible X Double Cab with automatic transmission (WLTP combined cycle data). From autumn 2019, the engine gained an eco stopstart system for Icon grade models and above.\nHilux is sold in the UK with the benefit of a five-year/100,000-mile warranty, bringing it into line with the generous cover Toyota provides for its new passenger vehicles.\nIn early June 2020, an overhauled version of the eighth-generation Hilux (pictured above) was unveiled. It features a striking new design, a powerful 2.8-litre powertrain, and equipment upgrades that will increase its appeal for business and leisure users.

      "text": "What Does C/K Mean On Chevy Trucks And Which Years Were They Made?\nChevrolet is one of the oldest brands in the auto industry, with a history dating back to 1911. Chevy has brought us eight generations of the beastly Corvette, and the Suburban's uninterrupted run of 90 years and counting makes it the longest continuously produced model in automotive history. The full-sized SUV is now in its twelfth generation, and the 2025 Suburban and Tahoe were redesigned on a platform shared with the SIlverado 1500 pickup.\nThe Silverado was the second-best selling vehicle of any kind in the United States during 2023, trailing only the Ford F-series pickup. The Silverado name had been in use for years as a trim level of C and K series pickups, and stepped in as a standalone replacement model in 1999 alongside the GMC Sierra. The C and K trucks had been in production since 1960, and hung around through 2002 alongside their younger cousins. The C label designated two-wheel drive trucks, and the K tags went on four-wheel drive models.\nThere were four generations of C and K series trucks\nThe C and K series of Chevrolet trucks were divided into four generations over 40-plus years, with the last two lasting longer than the first two. The first C and K trucks appeared for the 1960 model year as replacements for the late '50s Task Force series, and the model designations indicated capacity as well as drive type. C10 and K10 trucks had a half-ton payload, C20 and K20s were 3/4 ton, and the C30 and K30 designations went on one-ton trucks.\nThe first major update came for the 1967 model year. For the second generation that ran through 1972, C and K10 trucks and most 20-series models got coil springs at all four wheels. Big changes to the body came for the third generation in 1973, but despite the newly rounded corners, this iteration of the C/K series was dubbed the \"square body\" for its sharp corners and rectangular wheel openings. One-ton models were offered with a dually option, and the first Crew Cab appeared on C and K trucks during this generation as well. The fourth-generation trucks that appeared in 1988 all got an independent front suspension, and a high-horsepower 454 SS pickup was introduced for the 1990 model year."

      "text": "The 10 Most Iconic Ford Models Ever Built\nAfter 120 years in business, Ford Motor Company remains one of the world's largest carmakers, with multiple best-selling models in its current lineup. Its back catalog also includes a laundry list of iconic nameplates, many of which boast decades of production history and millions of units sold. Not every car the company has produced was a hit, however -\u2013 Ford has had its fair share of flops over the years too.\nLike every other major manufacturer in the industry, Ford is currently in the midst of pivoting its lineup towards EVs, with several high-profile models like the F-150 Lightning and Mustang Mach-E already in dealerships. So, now is a great time to take a look back and round up ten of the brand's most iconic nameplates so far. Reducing the list down to just 10 is no easy task, and plenty of well-loved models narrowly missed the cut. To keep things simple, we've also excluded cars by Shelby and Lincoln here -\u2013 both of which have enough icons in their back catalogs that they deserve lists of their own.\n1965 Ford Mustang\nAlmost 60 years after the first examples rolled off the production line, the Mustang continues to be the world's best-selling sports car. It was originally created as a result of Ford's research into the buying habits of the Baby Boomer generation, who were leaving college in the '60s and wanted a car that was both sporty and affordable yet still reasonably practical. The Mustang was designed to meet that untapped market, and it proved to be a huge success for Ford, with an estimated four million people flocking to showrooms to see the new car over its first weekend on sale.\nThe Mustang nameplate now spans seven generations, with the latest generation freshly launched for the 2024 model year. Even as rivals like the Chevy Camaro are retired in favor of a likely EV successor, the latest Mustang features no electrification options, such is Ford's reluctance to mess with the winning formula. However, the Mustang Mach-E electric crossover has controversially worn the iconic badge since its launch in 2021, marking the start of another chapter of the storied nameplate's history.\n1955 Ford Thunderbird\nAfter seeing Chevrolet's success with the two-seater Corvette, Ford hastily developed the Thunderbird, which went on sale for the 1955 model year. It shared a lot of parts with other Ford production cars, but its stylish looks and affordable starting price made it stand out from the rest of the lineup. In fact, it quickly outsold the 'Vette, although over the years, the two would eventually diverge away from being direct rivals.\nThe Thunderbird became Ford's luxury-focused offering, with a wider variety of body styles available after the initial run of two door convertibles from 1955 to 1957. After decades of production it was axed in 1997, before being briefly brought back in the early 2000s. The last Thunderbird left the line in 2005, with the iconic nameplate retired after 50 years.\nRecent rumors pointed to a revival of the name with a new car targeted at taking on the upcoming electric Corvette, although for now, Ford has remained tight-lipped on its future plans.\n1966 Ford GT40\nThe Ford GT40 is one of the most famous American race cars ever made, but it was originally built because of a grudge against Enzo Ferrari. In the early '60s, a tentative partnership had been formed between Ford and Ferrari to allow the American carmaker to enter GT racing, but Enzo backed out at the last minute, leaving Ford out of pocket. Henry Ford II then gave a small team of engineers orders to create a car that could beat the Italians, with the initial prototypes being developed in England and later versions built in a facility in Michigan.\nThe project had more than its fair share of hiccups as several key engineers quit halfway through and the car proved notoriously unreliable on the track. However, at Le Mans in 1966, the GT40 scored a decisive 1-2-3 victory, making Ford the first American manufacturer to ever take the top step of the podium. Today, original Ford GT40s often command seven-figure sums at auction, underscoring their importance as one of the brand's most important models ever built.\n1991 Ford Explorer\nAmerican buyers today can't get enough of SUVs, and the Ford Explorer played a key role in starting that market shift. According to Ford, the Explorer is the best-selling SUV of all time in the U.S., with the model first launched in the 1991 model year and remaining in continuous production ever since. Like many of the most successful Fords, the brand has kept the basic formula unchanged throughout those years of production: boxy, upright styling, a range of trims to suit all tastes and budgets, and plenty of space for a family and their luggage.\nHowever, an all-electric Explorer was recently unveiled for the European market, and Ford has hinted that it may eventually also be launched in America. If it does launch stateside, it would mark the most drastic change to the Explorer line since it was first released, although it's unlikely to replace the gas-powered bestseller outright anytime soon.\n1986 Ford RS200\nFord has a long history with rallying, although ironically the RS200 never got the chance to prove its worth in competition. It was designed to compete in Group B, but a series of tragic accidents saw the category unceremoniously canceled. Ford had barely finished work on the first iteration of the RS200 when the news broke and was left with a problem -\u2013 a batch of hastily-assembled cars, but nowhere to race. The 200 road-going cars were sold off, with some ending up competing in rallycross competitions, while the planned race cars were mostly kept as parts.\nDespite managing unimpressive results on the few rallies it entered before Group B was axed, the RS200 has gained a reputation as one of the most iconic rally cars of its era. Unlike most other Group B cars, the RS200 was built from the ground up as a race car and was a world apart from anything else the company offered at the time. Its rarity and unique history have kept values ticking steadily upward in recent years, with the late Ken Block introducing the car to a new generation of motorsport fans with his Hoonigan-customized example.\n1953 Ford F-100\nThe F-Series remains America's best-selling pickup truck line by a significant margin, with the first F-Series trucks appearing in the post-war years. The F-100 was the first to really capitalize on the trend of Americans using their trucks for everyday driving duties, offering increased comforts like sun visors and armrests. It was a huge hit, although it's tough to find one in original condition today -\u2013 most have been worked into the ground, modernized to some degree, or modified.\nThe second-generation F-Series truck was in production from 1953 to 1956, with later models gaining a wraparound windshield and other styling tweaks. Later successors added even more car-derived features, but today's most lavishly appointed trucks might never have been were it not for the success of the F-100. Like many of the best classic truck models, well-sorted examples of the F-100 are highly collectible, and the most pristine can command a significant premium on the occasion that an owner puts one up for sale.\n2005 Ford GT\nThe spiritual successor to the GT40, the Ford GT was the brand's first true supercar in decades. Its design took clear influence from the '60s race car, but this was no simple homage -\u2013 the engineering underneath was cutting-edge and proved that Ford could still compete with the Europeans when it came to track-ready road cars. It debuted in the midst of a golden age for halo cars, with Ferrari's benchmark Enzo and Porsche's sensational Carrera GT hitting the market just a year or two prior.\nA MotorTrend test of all three cars proved the GT had the performance chops to go toe-to-toe with the best in class, recording a top speed of just over 200 mph at Ford's Arizona Proving Ground. A full 10 years after the first generation, a second generation Ford GT was launched \u2014 which again proved the Blue Oval's competitiveness in the supercar field \u2014 while the ultra-limited 2023 GT Mk IV launched as the swan song for the current car.\n1968 Ford Escort\nAlongside its American operations, Ford has a long-standing presence in Europe, particularly in the U.K. There's a long line of models that were developed specifically for European tastes, but few can claim to be as iconic as the Ford Escort. The Euro Escort differed significantly from its North American counterpart, with the first generation car designed to replace the venerable Ford Anglia. A small, simple, and affordable car, the Escort soon proved to be a hit, both at dealerships and with the press.\nIt also proved to be highly successful in motorsport, with the Escort Mexico and RS2000 launched to capitalize on those successes. In particular, the car forged a reputation as one of the best rally cars of its day, handing Ford the drivers' championship in 1979 and 1981 with Bj\u00f6rn Waldeg\u00e5rd and Ari Vatanen at the wheel, respectively. The rise of four-wheel drive saw the Escort's reign cut short, but over a decade later, the Escort RS Cosworth reasserted the nameplate's place at the top of the sport.\nThe car remained in production from 1968 until 2000, when it was replaced in Europe by the Focus. However, the Escort remains a collectors' favorite today and can often still be seen at classic car rallies across the continent.\n2010 Ford F-150 SVT Raptor\nThe recently launched electric F-150 Lightning has previewed what the future of the American pickup market is likely to look like, and it's proved so popular that Ford is struggling to keep up with demand. However, for now there's still plenty of room left in the market for gas-guzzling V8 trucks like the recently unleashed 700 horsepower F-150 Raptor R. It's the latest in a line of Raptor-branded trucks that started with the 2010 F-150 SVT Raptor.\nWith its 6.2L V8 making 411 horsepower, the SVT Raptor kickstarted the off-road truck horsepower wars that are still going strong today. Previous high-powered pickups had been street trucks, focused on 0-60 mph times and straight-line bragging rights, but the SVT Raptor was built for the desert, not the drag strip. Its dune-bashing capabilities bested any previous production Ford pickup and proved such a hit both with critics and buyers that it spawned a whole new segment of the market.\n1908 Ford Model T\nIt's hard to understate the impact of the Ford Model T. Undoubtedly the most important model in Ford's production history, the Model T was launched in 1908 and helped transform mass production. Henry Ford's revolutionary assembly line slashed the cost of making each car, which in turn meant each model could be priced much lower than the competition. It was an unbeatable deal, and just 15 years after the model's initial launch, over half of all registered road cars were Fords.\nThe car remained in production until 1927, with over 15 million examples sold in total. The majority of those were painted black, although a select number of cars were also sold in other colors over the course of production. When it comes to iconic Fords, despite all of the segment defining luxury and performance models that have graced the car's dealerships over the years, its original mass-produced model is still firmly among the brand's most iconic vehicles ever made."

      "text": "The Most Reliable Car Brands You Can Buy In 2025\nBuying a car is a massive investment. Not only does the average American hold onto their cars for well over a decade, but cars depreciate in value from the moment they're driven off the lot. That means you'll never get out what you put in financially. For those reasons, it's important to buy a reliable vehicle that'll go the distance. After all, nothing feels worse than spending tens of thousands of dollars on a car and then having to fix it every year.\nThis is harder said than done because there are dozens of vehicle models on the market, and they are not all made the same. One brand may have excellent, reliable SUVs that stand the test of time while simultaneously selling cars that no new driver should buy. Even then, model years matter, and some years are better than others for virtually all vehicles, so it's worth taking a look every year to see where brands are when it comes to the overall reliability of their product lineup.\nIf you're car shopping in 2025, here's a list of brands that pass the test in terms of reliability. It is worth noting that most authorities on the matter consider today's vehicles to be a little less reliable than ones from years ago. Per JD Power, the main reason for this is basically a holdover from the pandemic when materials were out of sorts and the increasing number of infotainment problems customers have. With that said, let's talk about reliable car brands.\nNissan\nWe start our list with Nissan. In terms of overall reliability, Nissan is fairly average, scoring decent marks from JD Power, RepairPal, and other sources. That means that you have pretty good odds of getting a Nissan vehicle that'll last you for quite a while, but there are clearly better options out there in terms of reliability. That includes the entire lineup, from Nissan's insanely popular Nissan Rogue to the Frontier and everything in between.\nFor the most part, it seems the authorities on the matter like Nissan. JD Power gives most vehicles in the lineup favorable reliability ratings but does tend to be sweeter on vehicles with larger engines like the Frontier and Murano. Those larger engines tend to be naturally aspirated, which also tends to be more reliable overall. RepairPal says that Nissan vehicles can expect to break down less frequently than many other brands but does note that the severity of the breakdowns tends to be slightly higher than average.\nWith that said, the brand isn't without its controversies. A couple of Nissan's engines included in some Nissan Rogues and Altima models had a defect that caused premature engine failure. It seems the brand has cleaned up the mess, so 2025 models shouldn't be affected by the defect. Still, it's worth inquiring about before purchasing a new Nissan.\nInfiniti\nInfiniti is Nissan's luxury brand. As such, the two commonly share parts under the hood, so it shouldn't be much of a surprise that the two are fairly close together in the rankings. In fact, you could swap Infiniti for Nissan, and it would still be accurate as the two are virtually tied. JD Power is a little sweeter on Infiniti than it is on Nissan, but RepairPal likes Nissan a little more. Take that for what you will.\nIn any case, the same logic that these authorities have with Nissan holds true for Infiniti. The vehicles with the highest reliability ratings tend to be the brand's larger vehicles with larger engines. For example, JD Power says that the Infiniti QX80 is quite a bit more reliable than the smaller QX60. With that said, the predicted reliability of the brand's lineup is mostly positive or at least average, so Infiniti does okay overall. The big news here, though, is that Infiniti and Nissan are about the same.\nWith its close relationship with Nissan, Infiniti also had to deal with the three and four-cylinder engine issues in the brand's QX50 and QX55. The engines have since been cleaned up, but we might stick with the larger engines for Infiniti just to make sure.\nGenesis\nGenesis is in a similar spot as Nissan. None of the authorities on reliability rank the brand particularly high, but they also don't rank the brand as low either. It appears as though the powers that be consider Genesis average when it comes to overall reliability. Part of that is likely because Genesis is Hyundai's luxury brand, and luxury vehicles are judged a little harsher. The reason why varies, but it tends to stem from the fact that repairs and maintenance are more expensive on luxury models.\nGenesis doesn't have a ton of cars in its lineup so determining the best ones is pretty simple. Most authorities agree that the brand's sedans are more reliable than the SUVs. During our research, we found that the sedans like the G80 were considered noticeably more reliable than the GV80. There could be any number of reasons for this but most of the blame likely comes from the higher number of options like the Genesis GV80's electronically controlled suspension system that doesn't make an appearance in the G80. More moving parts usually means more problems.\nUnlike Nissan, Genesis lacks recent controversies. Indeed, by most accounts we could find, there are plenty of happy Genesis owners out there who have had little to no problems with their cars.\nBuick\nConsidering that GM brands tend to do poorly on predicted reliability rankings, it's kind of a surprise that Buick is here at all. Based on our research, it is the most reliable GM brand on the market and it's not particularly close. JD Power is the happiest with Buick's offerings, giving it 2nd place overall in its 2025 predicted reliability report. RepairPal and other authorities consider Buick slightly above average overall, which is a lot better than its corporate stablemates. We're not entirely sure why since all of GM's brands use similar parts.\nOur theory is that it's because Buick doesn't have that many models to bring down the average. Buick also bucks the trend of its larger vehicles having better-predicted reliability than the smaller ones. In fact, its Encore GX SUV is the brand's highest-rated Buick vehicle on JD Power despite being the smallest. Overall, all vehicles in Buick's lineup scored within a few points of each other, making it one of the most consistent brands on the list.\nGM has some of the biggest engine recalls in U.S. history, but none of the recent ones have affected Buick. In one instance, GM had to recall 500,000 vehicles for diesel engine woes. Buick doesn't use diesel engines, which is why they're here and the other GM products aren't.\nSubaru\nSubaru is much in the same position as Buick. Some reliability websites rank Subaru quite highly, while others are a little more lukewarm on the auto brand. However, Subaru scored above average everywhere and is definitely worthy of being on the list. Per RepairPal, Subarus have the same deal as Nissan. They tend to break down less frequently, but repairs tend to be more costly.\nWe don't know if it's Subaru's excellent boxer engines or what, but the brand has a pretty good track record overall. The Outback and Forester both score quite well, with the Crosstrek being among the highest rated vehicles in Subaru's lineup. The question mark appears to be the Subaru WRX. We're not sure if it's because people tend to drive WRX models more aggressively or if it's because modding is fairly commonplace, but they have historically not been the most reliable vehicles. This drags Subaru's score on some websites, even if the WRX isn't the brand's most popular car.\nThe short answer is this. If you want a reliable Subaru, you should probably stick with the more mainstream options or refrain from driving your WRX like you stole it.\nHyundai\nAh yes, the Hyundai and Kia twins. It wasn't long ago that both brands were considered toward the bottom of the reliability stack, either due to their former low-cost nature or because of the brand's hilariously unsuccessful Theta II engine. Regardless, both brands seem to have shed those old woes and are doing quite well these days. For Hyundai, the brand ranks above average on just about every website with RepairPal calling them a top 10 brand in terms of reliability.\nThere doesn't appear to be a reason for Hyundai's turnaround. In general, Hyundai's big-ticket items like the Tucson, Elantra, and Palisade all score high marks on all the reliability websites we looked at. There doesn't seem to be a pattern or reason for it. They are just solid vehicles. In fact, just a few years ago, Hyundai may have scored even higher on our list. However, EVs do not rank well in reliability ratings in general and the brand's Ioniq 6 definitely drags it down a bit in the rankings.\nOur advice is get the EV if you don't mind a few more repair shop trips, but most of the rest of the brand's lineup should be good, especially with Hyundai's long warranty.\nKia\nKia's ranking is virtually identical to Hyundai's. Generally speaking, we saw only minor differences on the various reliability websites. JD Power and RepairPal both like Kia a hair more than Hyundai. In all honesty, you could flip-flop Kia and Hyundai on any list you see them on, and it would still be accurate. Both companies use virtually the same architectures, engines, and other components, with most of the differences being in interior and exterior styling.\nThus, it should be no surprise that Kia's most reliable vehicles are just their versions of the same Hyundai vehicles. The Telluride, Kia K5, and Sportage all score high marks just like their Hyundai counterparts. The low points in terms of reliability are Kia's EV vehicles, such as the EV6, just like Hyundai's Ioniq. You see where this is going. The brands are nearly identical in terms of reliability because their vehicles are nearly identical where it counts.\nWith that said, the vehicles do look and behave differently. Hyundai tends to lean more luxury while Kia tends to lean sportier, resulting in different engine and suspension tunings. It's best to test drive both before making any decisions.\nAcura\nAcura is Honda's luxury brand and, as such, shares the same relationship that Nissan and Infiniti do. Acura is a darling on the reliability charts, scoring quite high nearly everywhere we looked. Only JD Power seemed a little sour on the brand, stating that their metrics showed that Acura was in the shop more often than other brands. Acura's lineup is quite small, so part of its advantage on a list like this is that there are fewer bad vehicles to drag down the averages.\nThat isn't to say Acura is perfect. Its RDX and MDX SUVs are the apple in Acura's eye when it comes to reliability, scoring well on every website we checked. Meanwhile, the sedans did a little bit worse than their SUV counterparts, which prevented Acura from climbing even further up the list. Additionally, Acura revived its ZDX badge for use in its new electric vehicle. It's too new to find trustworthy reliability numbers but EVs in general tend to score worse on these things anyway, which doesn't help Acura here.\nWe advise sticking with the SUVs since they are Acura's bread and butter, and you should be fine. The cars are still good, just slightly less so.\nHonda\nHonda has some of the most reliable vehicles ever built, and some of their engines have proven that they can stand the test of time. As such, it should be no surprise that Honda trends to the top of the leaderboards here. All reliability authorities scored Honda above average, with RepairPal scoring Honda as the most reliable brand according to its metrics. RepairPal says its metrics show that Honda not only goes to the mechanic less often, but its issues are generally not severe, leading to overall lower ownership costs.\nTo the surprise of no one, the CR-V is Honda's best-rated vehicle when it comes to reliability. The HR-V and Ridgeline also score well. Much like Acura, the sedans are a little less favorable, with the Accord scoring a merely average rating. Like Acura, Hyundai, and Kia \u2014 the inclusion of the Honda Prologue as an EV skews the ratings a little bit here. It's simply too new to get reliable data at this time but we already know that EVs tend to be less reliable.\nOverall, Honda is a solid brand, and its EVs are likely better than most. Even so, the CR-V is an easy choice for something functional and reliable.\nMazda\nMazda is an interesting case. It's the first brand on the list that has scored in the top 10 on every reliability list we looked through. In fact, it's one of only three automakers that can boast that distinction. Its highest ranking comes from JD Power, which ranks it third overall on its leaderboards, followed by RepairPal's fifth-place ranking. RepairPal says that Mazda's breakdown frequency is about average but that the severity of those breakdowns is rarely severe.\nMazda may fall down a few slots next year as it continues to phase out old products in place of new ones. As it stands, legacy products like the CX-5, Mazda3, and CX-30 carry the rankings with the highest marks among Mazda's lineup. The CX-50 and CX-90 are at the bottom but still garner at least average ratings overall.\nThe big thing working against Mazda is that they've introduced a few new cars in recent years. The CX-50 is only a few years old while the CX-90 was introduced in 2024. The middle child \u2014 the CX 70 \u2014 is new for the 2025 model year. None of those have a ton of historical reliability data yet, so we'll have to wait and see how they will do over the long term.\nToyota\nToyota is the second automaker to have top-10 finishes on every reliability list we sorted through. In fact, only RepairPal's 7th place rating kept Toyota from being the first automaker with top five placements all around. This shouldn't come as a surprise. Toyota has long been hailed as being a little bit boring but about as bulletproof as an auto brand can get. It seems 2025 won't be much different from the last couple of years for Toyota,\nToyota has a bunch of vehicles in its lineup. The Rav4, Highlander, Camry, and Corolla all score well on reliability metrics, which is surprising because Toyota sells hybrid models of all of those, and the electrification didn't lower the reliability scores by much. Among the hybrids, Toyota's recently redesigned Prius sits at the bottom but still scores higher than many hybrids. Only Toyota's bZ4X scored anything other than above average. It's the EV in the lineup, so that makes sense.\nThe short answer is that you can buy a Toyota with confidence. While their cars are often referred to as appliances for how boring they are, they'll get you and your family from point A to point B for years to come.\nLexus\nLexus is the highest-rated individual automaker on the list by every metric we could find. It scored top marks on JD Power, was in the top three on most other reliability ratings, and scored 6th on RepairPal. It's slightly lower score on RepairPal is almost certainly because it's a luxury brand, which is intrinsically more expensive as its breakdown rates and severity on RepairPal rivaled other top three automakers. In short, the only thing keeping Lexus down is technicalities.\nLet's break it down: The brand is held up by its RX 350 and ES 350 models, with the ES 350 having the highest predicted reliability of any model we've mentioned in this article. Its NX models also do quite well and even the hybrids do better than most. The bad mark on an otherwise excellent report card is the RZ, which is Lexus' EV. There simply wasn't enough reliability data since the badge is still so new, but we imagine it's not far off from other EVs.\nLexus is a luxury brand, so it's quite a bit more expensive than most of the other automakers on the list. That'll keep most folks from buying one, but those that do have good odds of getting a reliable car.\nMethodology\nFor the most part, this list was written using the process of elimination. We looked at predicted reliability from sites like JD Power and historical data from sites like RepairPal and started pruning the metaphorical bush from there. For example, BMW rated highly on many predicted reliability lists but was among the worst on RepairPal's list, so it was excluded. Meanwhile, other brands like Audi, Ford, most GMC brands, and all Stellantis brands ranked below average on every list we found, so they were also excluded.\nMeanwhile, EVs all ranked poorly on every list we found, canceling out Rivian, Tesla, and similar brands. The data is there and it can't be ignored as it also dragged down the score of every automaker that has one in their lineup. However, this makes sense because EVs are a new car technology, and it takes a while to work out the various bugs and issues. EVs will become more reliable as the years go but they're still in their infancy relative to the internal combustion engine.\nWe also want to point out that lists like this are intrinsically inexact. You can move the list around in a few different ways depending on how you look at the data and it'll still be accurate. However, we are confident that the automakers above have the best odds of pumping out a reliable vehicle."

      "text": "Why The Toyota Hilux Is Considered The Most Indestructible Truck Ever Made\nThe Toyota Hilux might be the toughest truck ever built. The unassuming mid-sized pickup has built something of a legend among auto fanciers, tackling everything from hard work on farms in Australia and South Africa to combat use in the Middle East. These days Hilux build quality is something of a meme: the boys at Top Gear famously sank a 1988 model into the sea, whacked it with a wrecking ball, set it on fire, and even detonated a 23-story apartment building under it. The Hilux took it all \u2013 flames, surging seas, a 240-foot drop amongst 12,000 metric tons of concrete shrapnel \u2013 and smiled.\nHeck, it's even economically resilient, having spent decades as a major player in the global pickup truck marketplace despite not even being offered for sale in the country that buys the most pickups (Americans probably wouldn't like it anyway).\nThe secret to Hilux immortality is partly Toyota engineering and partly build quality, but the X factor may well be the same thing that keeps it off the American market.\nNothing extra means nothing to break\nThe Hilux, from its 1960s debut to now, has been simple. Toyota designed the pickup according to the classic engineer's maxim: it's not done when there's nothing to add. It's done when there's nothing to take away. Early models didn't even have airbags and even the 2022 Hilux lacked automatic driver assists and other common extras. That put the Hilux at odds with American expectations, informed by mighty SUVs and ubiquitous F-150s full of creature comforts, but also reduced the number of things that could go wrong.\nToyota is also committed to the Hilux's invincible rep. Used Hiluxes that are either 10 or fewer years old or have under 100,000 miles on the clock are eligible for a manufacturer's warranty. Car Buyer notably gave the Hilux its Best Used Pickup award in 2022 for that very reason. To quote editor Richard Ingram:\n\"Pick-up buyers need a vehicle that is practical, versatile, and easy to live with. With up to 10 years warranty, this is a truck you can depend on.\"\nIt's a simple summation of what makes the Hilux great. Compact and straightforward with relentlessly rugged build quality, the Hilux is an excellent \u2013 and virtually indestructible \u2013 working truck."

      "text": "1960-1969\nThe all-new Jeep\u00ae Wagoneer represented unparalleled refinement and innovation. Prestige and individuality ruled the day. The Jeep Brand lineup grew to include 14 models \u2014 for work, play, recreation and luxuriously capable transportation.\nINTRODUCTION TO A DESIGN CLASSIC\nThe 1960s introduced the Jeep\u00ae Wagoneer in 1962, an instant classic designed by Brooks Stevens and advertised as \u201cAll-New, All-Jeep.\u201d It featured the first automatic transmission and independent suspension in a 4x4 vehicle. The Gladiator pickup truck was introduced as a \u201cbeautiful brute.\u201d A new \u201cDauntless\u201d V6 engine in the CJ-5 and Cj-6 doubled the power of previous engines.\nInspired Design Continues\n1961-1965 FLEETVAN (FJ-3/FJ-3A)\nWALK-IN DELIVERY VAN\nWillys Motors introduced the two-wheel drive Fleetvan was designed for light-duty, multi-stop applications such as postal delivery and ice-cream trucks. Practical was the operative word for the FJ platform. The Fleetvan was built on a beefed up DJ-3A Dispatcher platform and retained the same tough Jeep\u00ae Brand 81-inch wheelbase and F-134 Hurricane F-head engine. The FJ-Series was efficient, rugged and highly maneuverable.\nThis step-van featured sliding doors that were easy to enter from either side. Maximum use of front windshield glass permitted \u201call-points\u201d vision for the driver thanks to its cab-over engine design.\nThe first version was a right-hand-drive U.S. Post Office model that allowed the driver to operate the vehicle standing up for easier operation.\nThe slightly longer FJ-3A featured a long overhang with an overall length of 154-inches (vs 135 inches for the FJ-3).\nIn 1965, a new FJ-6 version was built on the CJ-6 platform. In 1975, the FJ-8 3/4-ton series and FJ-9-Series Postal Service vans built by AM General replaced the FJ-6.\n1963-1991 JEEP\u00ae WAGONEER (SJ)\nFIRST LUXURY 4x4 SUVs\nIn 1962, the Jeep\u00ae Brand introduced the Wagoneer\u2014the father of all luxury 4x4 SUVs. Replacing the Willys utility wagon lines, the Wagoneer was designed to provide passenger-car styling, comfort, and convenience with the advantages of four-wheel drive (4WD).\nThe revolutionary Wagoneer was filled with innovation and industry firsts: the first automatic transmission in a 4x4 vehicle; the first overhead-cam six-cylinder truck engine, the first 4x4 vehicle with an independent front suspension; the first automatic full-time 4x4 system. The revolutionary Quadra-Trac\u00ae 4x4 system, introduced in 1973, was available in full-size Jeep\u00ae Brand trucks and wagons, and later in the CJ-7.\nStyled by the famed industrial designer Brooks Steven, the Wagoneer captured the public imagination with its modern styling and good looks. The entire line of \u201cSenior\u201d (SJ) vehicles included the Gladiator and J-Series Trucks, Wagoneer Station Wagons, Panel Deliveries, and early Cherokee models.\nThe SJ line was in production for more than 28 years with only minor technical changes and when production ended\u2013was the longest continuous automotive production run, on the same platform, in U.S. automotive history.\nThe Wagoneer was renamed the Grand Wagoneer in 1984 to coincide with the introduction of the downsized Wagoneer and Cherokee (XJ) models.\n1963-1987 JEEP\u00ae GLADIATOR / J-SERIES TRUCK\nFULL-SIZE PICKUP TRUCKS\nIn 1962 a completely new \u201cJ\u201d line of Jeep\u00ae Gladiator trucks were introduced for the 1963 model year. The Gladiator full-size pickup trucks shared the same platform, front-end styling, and powertrain as the Wagoneer.\nThe Gladiator was available in either 120-inch (J-200) or 126-inch (J-300) form, and featuring a Dana 20 transfer case and Dana 44s front and rear. A tougher independent front suspension was available on half-ton trucks until 1965 but used a beefier 44IFS front differential.\nAvailable configurations included: Thriftside (narrow box), Townside (wide box), Chassis or Cab; Stake Bed; Wrecker; and Chassis-mounted campers with extended wheelbases.\nIn late 1965, the J-200 and J-300 Gladiators became known as the J-2000 and J-3000 respectively. The Gladiator name was dropped in 1971, after which the pickup line was known as the J-Series through 1987. In 2005, a new Gladiator concept vehicle was introduced as a prototype for the possible direction the Jeep\u00ae Brand might take in the near future.\n1964-1967 JEEP\u00ae CJ-5A/CJ-6A TUXEDO PARK\nDRESSED UP CJ\nThe Jeep\u00ae Tuxedo Park IV was a luxury special edition available on CJ-5A and CJ-6A vehicles produced from 1964-1967.\nTuxedo Park IV models included a chrome front bumper, hood badges, windshield hinges, taillamps, hubcaps with a \"Jeep\" emblem, column shift, four-wheel drive and a 160-horsepower V6 engine option. Jeep\u00ae CJ-5A Tuxedo Park\u2019s were used in Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s inaugural presidential parade in 1965.\n1965-1971 JEEP\u00ae J-2000 & J-3000 SERIES PICKUP (SJ)\nPOWERFUL AND TOUGH JEEP\u00ae BRAND TRUCKS\nIn late 1965, the J-200 and J-300 Gladiators became known as the J-2000 and J-3000 respectively. The J-2000 featured a 120-inch wheelbase, and the J-3000 had a 126-inch wheelbase. They were available in two or four-wheel drive configurations.\nThe J-Series Truck featured two great engines: the now standard Jeep\u00ae Hi-Torque 6, and the optional Vigilante V-8. You could get the Turbo-Hydra-Matic\u00ae automatic transmission along with a new, improved 4-wheel drive shift system and dual-range transfer case, new improved steering, optional full-time power steering, variable-rate rear springs\u2026 plus spirited new paint and trim options.\nIn 1968, the J-3000 Truck (126-inch) featured stout Dana 44 front and Dana 53 axles with 4.27:1 standard gear and 350 cubic inch \u201cDauntless\u201d V8 (Buick) engine and Four-speed transmission.\n1969-1974 JEEP\u00ae GLADIATOR / J-4000 SERIES PICKUP (SJ)\nSTANDARD 4x4 FOR MAJOR WORK AND FUN\nThe J-4000 Series pickup featured a new front clip, along 131-inch wheelbase. This brute featured a 19 spline Dana 44 front axle with D44, D53 or D60 rear. The standard powerplant was the 232 V6 engine. Engine options included the AMC 360 V8 and AMC 401 V8. In 1971, the Jeep\u00ae Gladiators were the only U.S. pickups to have four-wheel drive as standard and were completely at home in the toughest roughest country. Available options included a power takeoff, dumper body, snowplow, wrecker package and front-mounted winch.\nA J4800 Camper Special edition was available that could mount a living-space camper on the truck pickup body. This package featured a payload capacity of 3930 pounds, extra-heavy-duty suspension, four-speed all-synchro transmission, heavy-duty cooling and 10-ply tires.\n1966-1969 JEEP\u00ae SUPER WAGONEER (SJ)\nA \u201cSUPER-CUSTOM\u201d WAGONEER\nIn 1965, the Jeep\u00ae Brand introduced the refined Super Wagoneer\u2013a true luxury 4x4. Also known as the \u201cSuper Custom,\u201d the upscale Wagoneer was designed for the prestige buyer who desired rugged versatility with sedan comfort. It featured a single-speed transfer case for all-weather capability.\nSuper Wagoneer sported many premium features including: air conditioning, power tailgate, power brakes, power steering, seven-position tilt steering wheel, tinted windows, three-tone body striping, vinyl roof, padded vinyl roof with chrome roof-rack, full wheel hubcaps, white-walled tires, powerful 327-cubic inch \u201cVigilante\u201d four-barrel V8 engine (270 hp) with console-shifted TH400 \u201cTurbo Hydra-Matic\u201d automatic transmission\u2013all standard.\nWith this high level of standard equipment, Super Wagoneer paved the way for the burgeoning luxury Sport Utility Vehicle (SUV) market of today. The $5,943 MSRP was almost double that of the base Wagoneer, which set it apart from the masses.\n1975 marked the introduction of the \u201cwoody treatment, a wood grain appliqu\u00e9, a look that became synonymous with later Wagoneer\u2019s.\n1967-1969 M-715\nVIETNAM-ERA MILITARY PICKUP TRUCK\nThe M-715 series 1 1/4-ton military Jeep\u00ae Brand vehicle was designed to replace the Dodge M37 series 3/4-ton vehicles that had been in military service since 1951. The M-715 was an adaptation of the Gladiator pickup truck, becoming the first tactical vehicle built primarily from civilian components.\nThe M-715 featured an inline six-cylinder \u201cTornado\u201d engine, T-98 four-speed transmission, NP200 transfer case with low range, Dana 60 front and Dana 70 full-floating rear axle with 5.87:1 axle ratio. Top speed was 55 mph.\nThe front grille fenders, hood, doors and cab were stamped from Gladiator dies, with modifications to the upper part of the cab and doors as well as the fender cutouts. The cargo box was an entirely military design.\nThe M-715 came in several variations, all built on the same frame and wheelbase: the M-724 cab & chassis model, equipped with a welder, generator, and 8,000-pound winch; the M-725 standard army ambulance, the M-726 telephone maintenance truck with 8,000-pound PTO winch, and spotlight mounted on the left corner of the cowling. Non-military government agencies also used the M-715 as well, including: fire, forestry, and fish/game departments.\n1967-1973 JEEPSTER COMMANDO (C-101)/(C-104)\nA NEW JEEP\u00ae BRAND 4x4 FOR FUN AND ADVENTURE\nDuring the late 1960s, Kaiser detected a growing interest in leisure time use of 4x4 vehicles and capitalized on it with the introduction of a new series called Jeepster Commando. Kaiser Jeep borrowed the names of the Willys Jeepster and the Willys Commando Fire Truck for this sporty vehicle, designed to compete with the Bronco and Land Cruiser.\nLaunched with a youthful ad campaign promising seaside fun, the Commando was the first compact 4WD vehicle with automatic transmission and sported an interior \u201cdesigned to handle the elements and impress the ladies on the beach.\u201d\nThe C-101 (101-inch wheelbase) was built on a CJ-6 chassis with four body options\u2013roadster, pickup, power-top convertible and station wagon (8705F).\nLong a favorite among the Jeep\u00ae Brand faithful, early versions of the Commando came with many desirable components, including the \u201cDauntless\u201d V6, optional TH400 transmission, and full floating Dana 27 front and 44 rear axles. One of the rarest of rare Jeep vehicles is the 1971 Commando \u201cHurst Special,\u201d a AMC / Hurst joint promotion that featured a dual-gate Hurst shifter, ABS hoodscoop, 8,000 rpm racing tach, and blue and red exterior rally stripes. Fewer than 100 were ever produced and are much sought-after among collectors.\nTwo versions of the commando were built: the 1967-1971 Jeepster Commando (C-101) and the AMC-inspired Commando (C-104) of 1972-1973 (dropped Jeepster from name). Several special editions of the Jeepster Commando were produced. The Jeep\u00ae Brand produced the SC-1 or Sport Commando in 1971, which came standard with a V6 engine and included a special \u201cButterscotch\u201d paint job and \u201cspeed stripes.\u201d A similar version with revised sheet metal was offered in 1972 as the SC-2.\nThe front end of the Commando was restyled in 1972 to accommodate the AMC 232 and 258 OHV six-cylinder and 304 V8 engines. Many feel the departure from the traditional Jeep\u00ae Brand grille brought on a quick demise for the Commando."

      "text": "Mighty Fine Ford: Why The 1953 F-100 Is Held In Such High Regard\nFor over 130 years, since the development of Ford's very first ICE, the Ford Motor Company has risen to become an industry titan. As of 2023, the company is worth approximately $47.7 billion and has developed an enormous range of vehicles.\nAt times, Ford has demonstrated a certain taste for nostalgia. For example, the sleek Forty-Nine concept car evoked the spirit of the 1949 Ford, and it's understandable why. This era of the company's history was marked by the introduction of other popular vehicles, too. Where the '49 Ford was a car, the F-100 was a pickup, and a fondly remembered one at that.\nLet's take a look at the story of the F-100, what it packed under the hood, and exactly why pickup enthusiasts continue to hold it in high regard. An awful lot of time has passed since its introduction, yes, but a classic is a classic nonetheless.\nThe creation of the Ford F-100\n1953 was quite the year for the world. That May marked Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay's successful ascent to the top of Mount Everest, and Queen Elizabeth II's coronation occurred the next month. It was also Ford's fiftieth anniversary, which the company celebrated with the launch of the second-generation F-100 truck.\nThe original model, the F-1, was released in 1948, a product of the post-war truck boom. It was to be a very different type of truck, however: One that blended power and utility with style, usability, and drivability. The company expanded its offerings in the truck market with the F-1 to F-8 (the latter of which was Ford's largest yet, at three tons), utilizing the formidable new V8 engine. The half-ton F-1 proved the most successful model in the range, so building upon everything it accomplished with the next iteration of the F-Series was important.\nThis thinking resulted in the 1953 launch of the F-100, a pickup that took the principles of practicality, performance, and style to new levels for the time. It would be a crucial stepping stone in Ford's continued performance with the F-Series and the wider truck market.\nThe appeal of the F-100\nThe F-1, not unusually for the trucks of its time, sported a lot of rather harsh lines. For the 1953 F-100, the idea was to refine the idea that trucks could be aesthetically pleasing, too. As a result, the F-100 sports gentler curves, but the emphasis on size and power remains, as the roomy five-foot seat and hefty 106 HP V8 flat head would attest. Its continued appeal, however, has little to do with its 70-year-old specs.\nThe model is a slice of Ford's history and instantly recognizable to enthusiasts. The key to its lasting regard, though, is its aftermarket potential. The accessibility of parts and customization potential meant that wonderful, deceptively powerful builds could be created. In September 2019, MotorTrend shared the tale of F-100 enthusiast David Zambon, who spent nine years developing a build that utilized Potenzo Performance Tuning, a Boss 351, and a Ford Performance engine overlaid with Roadster Shop Fast Track Stage III. This F-100, according to Zambon, can hit more than 600 HP.\nThe build was showcased at Tennessee's Grand National F-100 Reunion that year. The fact that such an event exists speaks volumes about the continued reputation of the F-100. Trucks have come a long way since the model's first release, but thanks to people like Zambon, the F-100 has continued to advance alongside them."

      "text": "Who Owns Chevrolet And How Long Has It Been Around?\nIn the annals of the American automobile history, there are few names quite as revered as that of Chevrolet. There's good reason for that, as the automaker has produced as solid a stream of cars, trucks, and sport utility vehicles as any Stateside manufacturer. There have even been a few legitimate automotive icons in the company's lineup, with names like Impala, Corvette, Silverado, and Suburban fronting the pack of Chevrolet's most successful models.\nGiven the Chevrolet Silverado's 2023 ranking as the second best-selling vehicle in America, and the continued loyalty bestowed upon the Chevy brand by consumers, there's little reason to think its standing will fade anytime in the foreseeable future. But even as vehicles bearing the iconic Chevy bowtie logo continue to rate among the best-loved American-made automobiles, there's one fact about the manufacturer that even brand enthusiasts may not realize, which is that Chevrolet is not a standalone company. In fact, for most of Chevrolet's history, the company has been owned by General Motors, which also owns several other car brands, and over the years has been home to dozens of others.\nChevrolet has been around for more than a century\nGeneral Motors has owned Chevrolet since the early days of its existence, taking control of the automaker in 1918, just seven years after its founding. Yes, that means that Chevrolet has existed since 1911, which ranks Chevy among the oldest American auto brands still in existence, with only Buick, Ford, and Cadillac preceding it.\nChevrolet was spawned from a partnership between Louis Chevrolet, a Swiss race car driver and engineer, and William C. Durant, a co-founder of GM and head of the Buick Motor Company. As the story goes, Durant had previously hired Chevrolet to drive Buicks in promotional races, with the driver's successes inspiring the Durant to form a new automobile company. With Louis Chevrolet's help, Durant produced the company's first vehicle, dubbed the Series C Classic Six, in 1911.\nChevrolet was incorporated in Michigan that year, with the Classic Six serving as its first production car. In 1914, Chevrolet's mysterious bowtie logo would make its debut, and four years later, the company produced its first truck . That truck rolled off the line the same year GM acquired Chevy, and over the ensuing century-plus, the brand become as legit an American icon as you'll find on the roadway."

      "text": "Every Generation Of Ford's F-Series Ranked Worst To Best\nFor nearly 75 years, Ford Motor Company has led the pickup segment of the automobile industry with its F-Series trucks. Through technological innovation, quality construction, and exceptional reliability, the automaker has consistently offered buyers one of the best options for hauling, towing, off-roading, or riding comfortably in a daily-use vehicle. Over several generations, Ford implemented new designs or technologies that influenced future F-Series generations and had a significant impact on the pickup truck industry. Some of these include:\nV8 engine: Ford introduced a V8 engine in the F-Series trucks in 1948, and in 1954, the automaker implemented the Y-block overhead valve 239-cubic-inch V8. The original engine remained in service through 1962.\nTwin-I-Beam suspension: Ford introduced the independent front suspension with stable geometry to improve handling and provide a much smoother ride than traditionally offered in a pickup truck. The Twin I-Beam design is still used today in Ford's 3/4-ton and 1-ton trucks.\nFour-wheel-drive: Although Ford did not offer four-wheel-drive systems on its pickup trucks until 1959, when it did, the enhanced capability opened new opportunities for owners. Hauling and towing tasks became less challenging, and it raised the limit for weekend off-road adventurers out to tackle rough terrain.\nHere is a ranking of Ford's F-Series truck generations based on innovation as the principal criteria, starting with the worst (or, more accurately, the least innovative) to the best (most innovative).\nFord F-Series tenth generation (1997-2004)\nFord made major changes to the F-series for the tenth generation, including a new chassis, a softer shape, and creature comforts that were previously only found in the SUV. The automaker sought to market the F-150 to casual users, those seeking a daily driver more than a workhorse for hauling loads. The sleek, aerodynamic design used a lighter chassis that replaced the twin-I-beam front suspension with a torsion-bar setup. The F-250 and F-350 Super Duty models were focused on features required for heavy hauling and commercial applications.\nPerhaps the highlight of the tenth-generation F-Series was the re-introduction of the SVT Lightning in 1999. The new version boasted an Eaton Gen IV supercharged, liquid-to-air intercooled, 5.4L V8 engine fitted with forged-steel pistons and crankshaft, mated to a heavy-duty 4R100 four-speed automatic transmission. The powerplant generated 380 horsepower and 450 foot-pounds of torque, making the SVT Lightning the most powerful production passenger vehicle sold in the U.S. at the time. Car and Driver test results showed an acceleration from 0 to 60 mph in 5.2 seconds and a top speed of 142 mph.\nHowever, the 2004 Ford F150 suffered from a high number of engine failure complaints and faulty gas tank straps, resulting in an NHTSA recall (campaign number #11V385000). More than a million trucks were at risk of a corroded component that caused the gas tank to detach from the undercarriage of the truck, making it one of the least reliable Ford pickups ever produced, and the tenth generation the worst in the history of F-Series trucks.\nFord F-Series eleventh generation (2004-2008)\nFor the eleventh generation, Ford continued to evolve the F-150 into a vehicle with comfort features typically found in cars, but with a pickup truck's cargo space. A superior interior, a more forgiving ride, and improved handling appealed to the growing number of buyers who wanted to use pickups as a primary vehicle.\nFord offered the eleventh-generation F-150 with several engine options. A 4.2-liter V6 producing 202 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque was available starting with the 2005 model year. The two V8 engine options included a 4.6-liter with two valves per cylinder that generated 231 hp and 293 lb-ft of torque for the 2004-2006 model years, but produced an improved 248 hp and 294 lb-ft of torque through 2008. The other V8 option, a 5.4-liter with three valves per cylinder, produced 300 hp and 365 lb-ft of torque. Ford connected all the engines to four-speed automatic transmissions but offered a five-speed manual transmission as an option on the V6.\nPower was sent to the rear wheels as standard, but buyers could select 4WD drivetrains. Ford found the extra weight of the 4WD system significantly degraded the performance of F-150 models equipped with the V6, so it discontinued the option after the first year. However, even the rear-wheel drive version powered by the 4.6-liter V8 produced disappointing performance results, accelerating to 60 mph in 9.6 seconds and reaching a top speed of 130 mph.\nFord F-Series second generation (1953-1956)\nFord changed its naming system for the Ford F-Series with the 1953 model, but more significant were the creature comforts added to the cab and the replacement of the celebrated flat-head V8 in 1954 with the 239-cu.in. OHV Y-Block V8. The new engine, with a 7.2:1 compression ratio and a two-barrel carburetor, produced 130 hp and 214 lb-ft of torque. Ford offered a manual transmission in three configurations: a three-speed on the column, a three-speed with overdrive, or a floor-shifted four-speed. The automatic transmission was optional.\nAlthough Ford made modifications to the light-duty trucks in later generations to make them more appealing to the daily driver, the company had already begun the process in the second generation. Ford widened the front-end body panels, creating a more aggressive look while maintaining its passenger car's modern style. Driver and passenger visibility was improved with an increase in the size of the windshield (by 55 percent) using curved glass, and a new rear window that stretched the full width of the cabin.\nTo reduce driver fatigue, typical of pickup trucks in the early '50s, the automaker made the cab more passenger-friendly. A five-foot-wide seat and more interior space for its occupants made the standard cab more comfortable. Buyers could also choose the Deluxe cab option, including foam seat padding, a headliner, driver and passenger armrests, sun visors, a dome light, a cigar lighter, and chrome vent window moldings. The second-generation Ford F-series truck has become a favorite of hot rodders, and today, customized models fetch between $30,000 and $50,000.\nFord F-Series fourth generation (1961-1966)\nAlthough Ford introduced a novel \"unibody\" design with \"styleside\" or fleetside truck beds in 1961 that eliminated the gap between the cabin and the bed, the change was short-lived. The design enhanced the appearance of the truck and the continuous piece of sheet metal from the cab to the back of the bed made it less expensive to produce. However, several issues prompted Ford to discontinue the design for the 1964 model year. When the truck hauled a heavy load, the body flexed, causing the doors to jam and remain closed.\nArguably one of the most innovative designs in the history of the F-Series trucks, Ford introduced the twin-I-beam suspension in 1965. The automaker promoted the new independent front suspension that replaced the traditional solid-axle setup with the slogan, \"Drives like a car, works like a truck.\"\nBefore the change, pickup trucks were built with stiff suspensions designed for hauling heavy loads over uneven roads. While drivers who needed a truck for work tolerated the rough ride, a new category of pickup truck owners wanted a vehicle for occasional hauling and towing, but with the smooth ride of a passenger car for daily use. The independent design of the twin-I-beam system provided the solution. Ford removed the front leaf springs, replacing them with a coil-spring mechanism fitted with larger shock absorbers. Handling was improved, with more axle control and better traction, while the system absorbed the impact of road bumps for a smoother ride.\nFord F-Series fifth generation (1967-1972)\nFord completely restyled the new F-100 for the fifth generation that began with the 1967 models and, except for a few minor grille and trim upgrades, remained through 1972. Ford engineers made the cab and the hood wider. The flat grille was made, with four columns of stamped slots bordered by the headlights at each end. The trucks of this era are often referred to as the \"Bumpside\" pickups due to protruding ridges or \"bumps\" that run along the truck's body from the front to the rear. The ribs added strength to the body panels and gave the pickup a distinctive look.\nOn the interior, Ford added more luxury features typical of those found in cars. The upgrades reflected the trend toward building light trucks for daily driving and recreation as well as hauling and towing. Ford fitted the fifth-generation trucks with improved sound insulation for a quieter ride, more shoulder room, a heater, lap seatbelts, updated armrests, interior door handles, and two-speed windshield wipers as standard equipment. Options included power steering, power brakes, air conditioning, AM radio, and shoulder seatbelts.\nBeginning in 1967, Ford offered the pickup in Standard Cab, Custom Cab, and Ranger trim levels, all with the same drivetrain and bed options. Buyers could select an inline six-cylinder engine or the 352-cubic-inch \"Interceptor\" V8, producing 208 hp and 315 lb-ft of torque. In 1968, the automaker replaced the 352 ci V8 with a 360 ci and 390 ci V8 producing 215 hp and 255 hp, respectively.\nFord F-Series sixth generation (1973-1979)\nThree major factors impacted the design of Ford F-series trucks in the late 1970s. The OPEC oil embargo resulted in quadrupled gas prices that doomed large-displacement V8 engines. New, strict emissions standards deflated horsepower and performance. And buyer demand for pickups with comfort features that made them a viable option as daily drivers increased. The introduction of the Ford F-150 in 1975 highlighted the sixth-generation F-Series, demonstrating the influence of these issues on vehicle design and development.\nThe F-150 boasted a higher gross vehicle weight (6,050 pounds) than its sibling, the F-100. The heavier rating exempted the truck from some federal emissions standards, including the use of a catalytic converter and unleaded fuel. It also allowed the continued use of the naturally aspirated big-block V8 engines. Ford also avoided EPA regulations with the launch of the heavy-duty long-wheelbase F-350 in 1973, with an even heavier payload capacity.\nFord offered several trim levels across the F-100, F-150, F-250, and F-350 models. The Ranger was the most luxurious, with features found in a typical Ford sedan. Without the requirement for a catalytic converter, the F-150 was available with all of Ford's engines, including the 300-cubic-inch six that replaced the 240-cubic-inch engine and the 460-cubic-inch V8. Still, the impact of higher gas prices was evident in engine output. A 400-cubic-inch small-block produced only 169 hp, and a 351-cubic-inch version cranked out 160 hp.\nFord F-Series seventh generation (1980-1986)\nWhen Ford offered its first factory-built F-Series diesel pickup truck in 1983, it was powered by an International Harvester 6.9L IDI diesel engine that produced 150 horsepower and 285 lb-ft of torque, or an optional engine generating 170 horsepower and 315 lb-ft of torque. Ford offered the diesel engine in its F-250 and F-350 trucks as an alternative to the 7.5L 460 engine through the 1987 model year.\nWhile Ford forged new ground with the introduction of diesel-powered F-Series trucks, the automaker experienced robust sales over the complete F-Series truck line. In 1980, Ford sold 173,050 F-150s and 133,590 of the base F-100 pickups. However, in the early 1980s, domestic auto companies faced stiff competition for all their models from overseas. Consumers perceived imports as higher quality, more fuel-efficient, and less expensive than their American counterparts. Although the F-150 was the best-selling vehicle, Ford decided a new campaign was needed to remind buyers that American-made vehicles were built with high quality as well. The company adopted the slogan at Ford, \"Quality is Job 1.\"\nAt the end of 1983, Ford discontinued the F-100, making the F-150 the base model. The 1984 F-150 was offered in four trimlines \u2014 base, XL, XLS, and XLT Lariat, each of which could be configured with one of three engine options. The straight six-cylinder produced 115 hp, while the 302-cubic-inch V8 engine produced 130 hp, and the 352-cubic-inch engine generated 150 hp. Ford offered all the models with a manual or automatic transmission and either a rear-wheel or four-wheel drive.\nFord F-Series eighth generation (1987-1991)\nDuring the eighth generation of the Ford F-Series, all engines migrated to electronic fuel injection (EFI), marking the end of carbureted engines in the automaker's pickup truck line. An EFI system is composed of an Electronic Control Unit (ECU) and several sensors such as the Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) Sensor, Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor, and others that are used to instantaneously determine the ideal amount of fuel. The ECU reads engine RPM and information from the sensors to meter the fuel, adjusting the fuel pump and ignition timing.\nIn 1987, Ford offered the 1/2-ton F-150 in both regular cab and extended cab body styles, either with RWD or 4WD. The base model was fitted with a fuel-injected 300-cubic-inch six-cylinder that produced 145 hp and 265 lb-ft of torque. Ford still offered the 302-cubic-inch V8, but for the eighth generation, the automaker made the fuel-injected 5.8L high-output F-250 engine available in the F-150. The powerplant generated 210 hp and 305 lb-ft of torque. In 1987, a four-speed manual transmission was standard, but beginning in 1988, Ford made the five-speed manual standard and an automatic optional.\nThe eighth-generation F-Series trucks with base Custom, mid-range XL, and top-of-the-line XLT Lariat trim levels carried over much of the body style from 1980s models. However, minor changes featured a modern flat grille, flush headlamps replacing the sealed-beam headlights, and rounded wheel arches. The trucks included power steering, power brakes, and ABS brakes as standard equipment.\nFord F-Series third generation (1957-1960)\nAlthough third-party 4x4 conversions had been available on Ford F-Series trucks for several years, 1959 marked the first year the automaker offered it as a factory option. Many of today's new pickup truck buyers consider the four-wheel drive a \"must-have\" feature on a Ford F-series. Not only does it enhance the truck's hauling and towing capabilities, but it also allows drivers to venture just about anywhere off-road.\nFord's changes to the F-series' exterior for the third generation featured a wider, squared-off style. The larger cabin provided more space inside, and the flatter hood demonstrated a clamshell design. The new F-Series pickups also introduced the \"Styleside\" body that provided a more streamlined appearance and more space than the big-fendered look, with a split cabin-and-bed design. Although briefly discontinued, the style became a standard that remains to this day.\nFord offered the 1957 F-100 with two engine options: The 223-cubic-inch straight-six, producing 139 hp and 207 lb-ft of torque, and the 272-cubic-inch V8, generating 171 hp and 260 lb-ft of torque. However, in 1958, the Y-block 272 was first given a horsepower boost and later replaced with the 292-cubic-inch V8. All the engines were mated to a three- or four-speed manual transmission or a three-speed automatic. Today, the chunky style of the third-generation Ford trucks has gained popularity with collectors and hot rodders. The vehicles are simply built, with plenty of aftermarket parts available, making them ideal for customization. Resale prices vary from $17,000 for a stock model to nearly $50,000 for restored versions.\nFord F-Series thirteenth generation (2015-2020)\nFord initiated the F-Series thirteenth generation with a significant change in materials. The trucks were built with extensive use of aluminum, featuring a mostly aluminum body mounted on a traditional steel frame. The new body was much more rust-resistant than those made of steel, and weighed less. The 750 pounds of weight saved meant the truck performed better and was more fuel-efficient than the previous year's heavy models.\nIn 2018, Ford introduced a new base engine, the F-150 direct-injected 3.3-liter V6 engine, replacing the aging 3.5-liter V-6. The dual ports and direct injection boosted power and torque. The 3.3-liter V6 generates 290 hp and 265 lb-ft of torque (eight more hp and 12 more lb-ft of torque than the outgoing 3.5-liter V-6). In the same year, the automaker also offered a diesel engine for the F-150, based on the Lion turbodiesel 3.0-liter V-6.\nIn 2020, Ford offered the Super Duty line with XL, XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, Platinum, and Limited trims, each with three engine options. The gas-powered mills included a 6.2-liter V8 producing 385 hp at 5,750 rpm and 430 lb.-ft. of torque at 3,800 RPM and the 7.3-liter V8 generating 430 hp at 5,500 rpm and 475 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,000 RPM. The third engine option was the new Power Stroke 6.7-liter diesel V8 that cranked out 475 hp and a whopping 1,050 lb-ft of torque. The most powerful engine in the Super Duty line, it gave the diesel truck up to a 37,000-pound towing capacity.\nFord F-Series fourteenth generation (2021-present)\nAlthough Ford has dominated the pickup truck market since the introduction of the first-generation F-Series, competition from improving Ram, Chevrolet Silverado, and other models has inspired the automaker to maintain a margin of technology and performance superiority to stay ahead of its competitors. Two recent innovations are the PowerBoost Hybrid and the F-150 Lightning EV, both introduced in 2021.\nThe Hybrid is equipped with a 3.5L twin-turbo DOHC 24-valve V-6 producing 394 hp and 492 lb-ft of torque, and an electric motor generating 44 hp and 221 lb-ft of torque. The pickup generates a total of 430 hp and 570 lb-ft. The four-wheel-drive Hybrid is rated at 24 mpg by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and can travel up to 624 miles before refueling. Although the Ford F-150 is stingy on gas consumption, the pickup also boasts impressive performance, accelerating to 60 mph in 5.3 seconds.\nThe Ford F-150 Lightning offers buyers a full-size four-wheel-drive light-duty truck powered by dual permanent-magnet synchronous AC electric motors. Although the Lightning has many of the standard (gas-powered) F-150 features, it is limited by a range of 240 miles (EPA-estimated). However, the Extended Range model with a larger battery has a maximum driving range of 320 miles. The Lightning boasts an acceleration of 0 to 60 mph in 4.0 seconds, but the towing capacity, rated at 7,700 pounds, ranks low in its class. Of course, Ford still offers the conventional-fuel-powered F-150, as well as the muscular Ford F-150 Raptor, made for the off-roading enthusiast.\nFord F-Series ninth generation (1992-1997)\nA redesigned ninth-generation F-Series truck demonstrated a smoother, more modern appearance than previous generations, using the same chassis and cab but with updated tech. Robust sales of the ninth-generation F-series helped the pickup set sales records. In 1995, the pickup became the world's best-selling vehicle, exceeding the Volkswagen Beetle (although the Beetle remained the best-selling passenger car).\nHowever, the highlight of the generation was the introduction of the high-performance F-150 Lightning in 1993 and later the SVT version. The truck was powered by a naturally aspirated 5.8-liter V8 producing 240 hp and 340 lb-ft of torque. The engine featured cylinder heads that combined with a new \"Special Vehicle Team\" SVT-only, tubular aluminum intake manifold. Hypereutectic aluminum alloy and silicon pistons, a roller camshaft, a wide 65mm throttle body, and a dual-exhaust system also contributed to the F-150 Lightning's performance. The pickup truck accelerated from 0 to 60 mph in 7.2 seconds, reaching the quarter mile in 15.6 seconds.\nExcellent performance and handling typical of a high-performance sports car were provided by a sport-tuned suspension featuring twin I-beams up front and special front coil and rear leaf springs, 25.4mm front and rear sway bars, and Monroe Formula GP shock absorbers. Stopping power was achieved with 11.72-inch front discs and 11.03 x 2.25-inch-wide ABS rear drum brakes. The truck rode on 17 x 8-inch, cast-aluminum, five-spoke wheels with Firestone Firehawk P275/60HT-70 radial tires.\nFord F-Series twelfth generation (2009-2014)\nThe Ford F-Series twelfth generation saw two significant milestones in the history of the automaker's pickup trucks. In 2010, Ford introduced the F-150 Raptor, perhaps the best off-road production truck ever made. In 2011, the company also offered buyers an alternative to a V8 engine with the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6. It was the most powerful engine available in the F-150 lineup at the time, offered the highest towing capacity, and had the best gas engine fuel economy.\nFord equipped the first Raptor with an SOHC 5.4-liter V8 that produced 320 hp but upgraded to the 411-hp 6.2-liter V8 shortly thereafter. For the second generation, the automaker replaced the naturally aspirated V8 with the high-performance EcoBoost V6, generating more power at 450 hp and 510 lb-ft of torque. While the Raptor's power competed well with Chevy, GMC, and Ram pickup trucks of the its era, it was the off-road features that distinguished the pickup truck from its rivals.\nThe Raptor is a supercab design with two doors plus two rear-hinged half-doors and a small cargo box less than 70 inches long. The space is just large enough for hauling camping equipment, but too small to move a significant amount of dirt. The long-travel suspension was built with elongated cast-aluminum lower control arms, providing 11.2 inches of travel up front and 12.1 inches in the rear. Big-piston Fox Racing Shox shock absorbers at all four corners give the pickup the capacity to handle almost any road obstacle, deep ruts, or rocky tufts. The robust brakes, bolstered half-shafts, heavy-duty rear axle, and other mechanical upgrades made sure the pickup handled the toughest of off-road challenges.\nFord F-Series First Generation (1948-1952)\nAfter World War II, the Ford Motor Company set out to design and manufacture a pickup truck that would not only have features that appealed to farmers and fleet companies, but would be attractive to a much broader buyer. Styling, handling, driving comfort, fuel economy, and safety became priorities on the new pickups. Hence, the first F-Series pickup truck was born. The first generation of the F-Series, introduced in 1948 and promoted as the \"Bonus Built Line,\" marks the beginning of Ford's focus on designing trucks offering a range of models, cab, and chassis configurations.\nThe initial offering included eight numeric models, F-1 through F-8. The body included wide front fenders designed to look like a single piece and the rear fenders no longer had the teardrop shape of previous models. The vertical grille was replaced with a new wide five-bar horizontal grille, and the turn signals were built into the top grille bar. Ford redesigned the F-Series in 1951, modifying the front fenders, hoods, cabs, and grille, among other tweaks. The automaker also offered buyers two trim levels: the standard Five Star Cab and the deluxe Five Star Extra Cab. The deluxe trim included luxurious foam seat padding, two-toned seat upholstery, and extra sound-deadening material, among other upgraded features.\nThe last year of the first generation, 1952, saw few style changes but more power options. A new 215-cubic-inch six-cylinder engine generating 101 hp replaced the 95 hp flathead six. Ford still offered the flathead V8, but also configured some cars and trucks with the overhead-valve V8."

      "text": "2025 Ford F-150 Review: Hybrid V6 And New BlueCruise Help Find The Sweet Spot\nI could tell you how well the Ford F-150 has sold over the years but, at this point, that seems fairly redundant. Life at the bleeding (sales) edge of pickups in the U.S. gives Ford a perennial marketing boast, but it also puts the F-150 in the sights of every would-be challenger, whether storied or startup. A big bed and some nice seats are no longer enough to be truck royalty: these days you need technology, and useful technology, to hold on to your crown.\nOfficially, Ford wanted me to test out the latest iteration of BlueCruise, its hands-free driving assistance system for highways. In fact, the F-150 is the first to get the very latest update to the tech, version 1.4, though other models in the automaker's range will follow shortly after.\nThe truth of it, though, is that nobody is going to buy an F-150 solely for BlueCruise. And, equally true, the F-150 line-up has expanded over the years into a fairly arcane \u2014 and unarguably confusing \u2014 array of options, beyond just bed and cab size. With the EcoBoost Full Hybrid also in the mix, just where does the pickup sweet spot now lie?\nThe V6 hybrid is the one to have\nThough the knee-jerk reaction to not picking a V8 isn't quite so strong \u2014 just like Ford's decision to switch to aluminum for the F-150's body now seems prescient, not preposterous \u2014 and the truck's various EcoBoost options are sound, I'd still spend my own money on the hybrid. Available on the XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, and Platinum trims, it's a $1,900 option on this 2025 F-150 SuperCrew Lariat.\nIt bumps the regular 3.5-liter turbo V6's 400 horsepower and 510 lb-ft of torque to 430 hp and 570 lb-ft, respectively, and includes both 4x4 and a 10-speed automatic transmission as standard. More important, from behind the wheel, it leaves the F-150 feeling more enthusiastic around town. The regular EcoBoost isn't especially prone to turbo lag, but adding electrification gives a welcome shove that helps you ignore the fact you're driving a hefty full-size truck.\nAlso present on this particular F-150 was the $1,095 FX4 Off-Road Package. It adds Hill Descent Control and Rock Crawl Mode, off-road tuned front shocks and monotube rear shocks, and extra protection to the fuel tank, front diff, and transfer case. I'm not sure it made much difference to me in the Michigan snow and ice, but the Ford never felt less than sure-footed (and the 4A mode handled all-wheel drive transitions seamlessly).\nBlueCruise v1.4 raises its hands-free driving game\nThe 2025 F-150 is the first of Ford's fleet to support BlueCruise 1.4, the automaker's hands-off highway driving assistant. Resolutely not self-driving (regardless of what other automakers might claim of their similarly Level 2 systems), BlueCruise expects drivers to pay attention to the road ahead and be poised to retake the wheel should issues arise. However, on stretches of pre-mapped highway, it can maintain lane position, speed and distance from the vehicle in front, and change lanes for you on demand.\nVersion 1.4 has a number of improvements, with Ford suggesting better performance in tight curves and narrow lanes \u2014 BlueCruise will already offset its lane positioning, if a larger vehicle like a truck is looming alongside \u2014 along with more resilience to sun reflecting into the sensors, and during periods of inclement weather. The success of the latter was my biggest question, given the snowy conditions in the Midwest winter that coincided with my loan.\nWhile nature declined to supply me with anything close to a whiteout or blizzard, the F-150 handled snowy and slushy lanes just fine, as well as reduced visibility. Quite honestly, I wouldn't want my ADAS to be active during weather conditions more tricky: BlueCruise's assisted lane changes (launched in v1.2), which are triggered by tapping the turn signal stalk, are reasonably conservative, but there were still a couple of times when the system would've been content to pull across even though a higher-speed car was approaching on the semi-slippery asphalt. Just as with retaking manual steering control, deciding when is \u2014 and isn't \u2014 a safe time and stretch of highway to use BlueCruise is down to the human driver.\nHands-off, but not quite pulling ahead\nGenerally, I'm a fan of BlueCruise: though there are always a few miles of hesitancy, on my part, with any of these hands-off systems, Ford's tech is a confident and fairly reserved driver. I never had to weigh in for a bad decision, and \u2014 though far from scientific \u2014 it felt like the system deactivated less frequently due to road conditions, too.\nThere's still room for improvement, mind. Unlike GM's SuperCruise, which can automatically initiate a lane-change if the vehicle ahead is slower than the speed the system is set to, Ford's version currently won't do that. BlueCruise will suggest you change lane if you're traveling below your set speed for a period \u2014 I got the notification after a fairly long stretch at around 64 mph, when I'd set it to 70 mph \u2014 but we'll need to wait until BlueCruise 1.5 (likely to arrive later this year, and on the 2025 Mustang Mach-E first) for automatic lane changes.\nThat, of course, highlights one of the strengths of these systems, with Ford able to push out new versions to vehicles already on the road. The downside is the subscription fee. Lariat and Tremor trim buyers get a 90-day trial of BlueCruise on the F-150, while King Ranch and Platinum get a full year of use. After that, it's $495 annually, or $49.99 per month.\nMore potent Pro Power is the hybrid's wildcard\nThere are more reasons to like the hybrid F-150 than just its on-road performance. Ford's Pro Power system basically turns the pickup into a mobile generator, capable of powering work sites, homes experiencing outages, and campsites.\nWhile the 3.5-liter EcoBoost V6 \u2014 standard on the King Ranch, Platinum, Tremor, and Raptor trims \u2014 gets Pro Power with 2kW output, the more potent versions are saved for the hybrid engine. That means 2.4 kW standard (or 7.2 kW optional) is available on the XLT, Lariat, King Ranch, or Platinum trims with that engine. Now, an all-electric F-150 Lightning can deliver more juice \u2014 up to 9.6 kW \u2014 and tie into Ford's special home backup system that automatically switches over to the EV's battery if the grid goes down, but that doesn't make the hybrid systems disappointing.\nIn the case of the 7.2 kW version on this F-150 Lariat, for $850 you get two 120V/20A outlets in the bed, capable of 2.4 kW apiece. Or, you can plug into the 240V/30A outlet, to get the full 7.2 KW. That's enough to run proper workshop equipment or, with a generator interlock kit or similar, keep the essentials in your home running during a power outage. It's a huge advantage, especially given most full EVs still don't have 240V output support yet. Ford also adds a number of 120V outlets in the cabin.\nLariat straddles comfort and practicality\nInside, the middle-of-the-trim-walk Lariat straddles the worlds of work truck and a little luxury. The seats are clad in sturdy faux-leather, but they're still heated and ventilated in the front, paired with a heated, leather-wrapped steering wheel. There's a 12-inch touchscreen running SYNC4, dual-zone climate control, an embedded 5G modem with optional Wi-Fi hotspot, and a 360-degree camera, together with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support. Power-adjustable pedals, an 8-speaker B&O audio system, remote start and remote tailgate release, and a power-sliding rear window are also included on the Lariat.\nThis particular example had the $7,725 Lariat High Equipment Group (502A), too. It adds a head-up display, an upgraded B&O audio system with 14 speakers, heated second row seats, and the Mobile Office Package. Press a button to lower the transmission shifter \u2014 it slowly whirs down flush with the console, like a Transformer taking a cold plunge \u2014 and you can unfold the front center armrest into a flat desk.\nApparently F-150 drivers still like the reassurance of a physical shifter, hence Ford not replacing it with buttons, though I can't say I found its action forward and backward particularly satisfying.\nFord is, at least, liberal with its cubbies and storage bins. In the back, the split rear bench folds up; the resulting floor isn't entirely flat, though. A twin-panel moonroof is $1,495, while the Pro Access tailgate is part of the $1,620 Bed Utility Package. $430 adds a retractable rear center step, while the FX4 Off-Road Package sensibly swaps the Lariat's carpets for tailored (and easy to clean) rubber floor mats.\nJust where is the F-150 sweet spot in 2025?\nRoaming higher through the F-150 trims certainly gets you a more lavish truck (or, in the case of the Raptor, a more aggressive one), but I can't help but feel like the Lariat is the sweet spot. It's not exactly cheap \u2014 frankly, no full-size pickup is cheap these days, unless it's in barebones work truck spec \u2014 but it's the cheapest way to get both the full hybrid drivetrain and BlueCruise.\nWith the electrification, a year of the hands-off driving assistance, and the 7.2 kW Pro Power Onboard upgrade, you're at $70,065 including destination. Ford's current incentives slice that down to just shy of $68k. Weather conditions over the week meant I couldn't do my usual gauge of economy, but the EPA's quoted 23 mpg combined comfortably nudges the hybrid V6 ahead of even the smallest 2.7-liter EcoBoost and the 5.0-liter V8 (20 and 19 mpg combined, respectively, in their 4WD forms).\nChevrolet, meanwhile, will only sell you its Super Cruise option (currently around $6k after promotions) on a top-spec Silverado High Country (from $67,990 plus destination). While there's an all-electric Silverado EV, Chevy doesn't have a hybrid engine for the regular pickup.\n2025 Ford F-150 Verdict\nFor many truck buyers, what Chevrolet (or Ram, or anybody else) is doing in their dealerships won't make a jot of difference: brand loyalty arguably sells as many F-150 as the pickup's own talents might. The real question, then, might be whether Ford's updates on the tech side for 2025 leave this a more appealing vehicle, regardless of whether you're using it for work or play.\nI continue to find BlueCruise \u2014 and similar hands-off highway assistance systems \u2014 compelling, though as always there's the important note of being thoroughly aware of just what the tech can, and can't do. For now, with its ability to automatically perform lane-changes in response to slower traffic ahead, GM's Super Cruise still has a practicality edge. However, the fact that Ford makes its system far more available across the F-150 line-up, and that its roadmap includes adding that functionality, means this particular horse race is far from a done-deal.\nCombined with the full hybrid EcoBoost, though, it's a struggle not to recommend the F-150. Short of going for a fully-electric truck (at which point the F-150 Lightning wades into the fight), its combination of on-road enhancements and power features when parked are very nearly enough to have me wondering if I need a full-size pickup in my life (spoiler: I don't, but that doesn't stop me wanting one)."

      "text": "The 10 Best Jeeps Ever Designed, Ranked\nFor decades, the venerable Jeep has been a favorite among American and international car buyers. Born out of necessity during the struggle to defeat tyranny during WWII, the Jeep emerged as one of the victors' most useful and important tools. After the war, Willys transformed production of the military vehicle toward civilian use, creating an icon of the American road that has endured as an indelible part of automotive culture ever since.\nThrough the years, the Jeep brand has offered a limited range of vehicles based on the original military design and from original platforms. Some of these have been wildly successful while others languished in showrooms. However, a lack of sales success has not meant some models were altogether lacking or downright bad when viewed through retrospective lenses. Some less successful models could be desirable and valuable collector's models today. Regardless, Jeep has delivered a range of fantastic off-roading vehicles over the years, and these models represent the best designs to have come from the manufacturing plants of Jeep.\nJeep FC-170\nEarly civilian Jeeps were marketed toward agricultural buyers who could adapt them for farm work and take advantage of their adept capabilities off the road. Jeep provided the means to add implements taking power from the engine, transforming the vehicles into pseudo tractors that could also be driven to market. As an evolution of this concept, a truck was added to the lineup in 1956.\nThis rugged Jeep truck was known as the Jeep FC-170 \u2014 the FC stands for forward control. Controls of this cabover truck are placed ahead of the front wheels, hence forward control. The cabover design allowed Jeep to make the most of the space and offer a truck with an incredibly tight turning radius and excellent visibility. The other advantage of these design choices was the ability of parent company Willys to build a new truck on the existing chassis of its CJ-5 Jeep.\nThe FC is a spartan workhorse with zero creature comforts. Yet, its peculiar design makes for an endearing classic truck when viewed through modern spectacles. Part of its allure comes from its aesthetic qualities, courtesy of renowned industrial designer Brooks Stevens, and the other part lies in the inherent quirkiness of its forward-control layout. While modern collectors may be in love with these unique trucks, Jeep only sold about 30,000 models in total, making them a rare sight today.\nJeep Cherokee XJ\nNext to the CJ and Wrangler models, the XJ Cherokee is likely the best-known Jeep model. Introduced in 1984, this new Jeep borrowed its name from an existing full-size model and came with an upscale cousin which also borrowed its name, Wagoneer. Its construction represented a departure from tradition by merging the box frame and body into a single unit, providing more strength and rigidity with less weight. Furthermore, its smaller size and simple yet elegant design made for an attractive and enduring package that was a wildly successful model in Jeep's lineup, nearly unchanged until 2001 \u2014 an eternity for any automobile.\nWhat made the Cherokee work so well was a combination of impressive capabilities coming from tried and tested 4x4 components mated to a durable and torquey 4.0-liter straight-6 engine. Though straight and boxy, the Cherokee was attractive and could be had with nicely appointed and comfortable interiors. It was the vehicle to do everything.\nUpon its debut, the Cherokee earned 4x4 of the year from all three of the top off-road magazines of the day. The formula for it worked so well that it remained in production until 2001 using the same design with only a refreshed front fascia in 1997 \u2014 even the straight-6 engine remained until the model's discontinuation. With the onslaught of smaller SUVs and crossovers in the following decades, it's hard not to make an assumption that the 1984 Cherokee played a large part in the phenomenon.\nJeep Grand Wagoneer SJ\nWhile Americans are today accustomed to large SUVs with seating for six or more passengers, the roads were markedly different in 1963. Just before then, Kaiser Motors, which took over production and ownership from Willys-Overland in 1953, needed something to sell with broader appeal than the rugged wartime-derived CJ model. A new wagon was developed to offer comfortable seating for a family with room for luggage that retained the off-road prowess of its existing models. This vehicle would become known as the Wagoneer, an icon of the road for a generation.\nKnown internally as the Full-Size Jeep, its internal designation eventually shortened from FSJ to simply SJ. Like the FC truck, this one was also designed by Brooks Stevens, and its longevity in the market is perhaps a testament to the brilliance of his industrial design. The debut model came with a modest 140-horsepower Tornado inline-6 and became the first 4x4 vehicle offered with an automatic transmission, and a rear-wheel-drive-only option went away in 1969.\nFrom 1978 the Wagoneer moved upscale into a luxury flagship model for Jeep, receiving the updated Grand Wagoneer moniker. These relatively powerful and well-appointed models represent the finest of the Wagoneer. Although still capable of tearing up the side of a mountain, they became a sort of prototype for the Escalades, Navigators, and Lexus GX models that followed. The market for Grand Wagoneers is strong today with values running from $24,000 to $54,000 and recent sales as high as $177,000.\nJeep CJ\nIt's hard to overstate the impact of the original Willys MB light military transport on not just WWII, but on society. However, wartime production ended, leading to adaptation to civilian models. Modest changes were made and production of a civilian version commenced in July of 1945. This was dubbed the CJ-2A, and an evolution of this naming system continued until it was replaced by Wrangler in 1986.\nWhile early models were strictly utilitarian, they quickly transformed from rugged workhorses into play toys for adventurers, and Jeep capitalized on this trend early on. TV advertisements as early as 1959 touted its workability and penchant for adventure. Introduced for the 1955 model year, the CJ-5 established Jeep as a rugged and capable off-road vehicle with sporting credentials for free-wheeling fun. Its long run through 1985 also firmly established the image of what a Jeep should be.\nThe CJ-5 spawned several variants and special editions contributing to the colorful legacy of the Jeep brand. The CJ-6 extended the wheelbase and sported olive green paint for military use while the later CJ-7 debuted in the '70s as a slightly longer wheelbase version for consumers, and the rare CJ-8 truck-like Scrambler sold from 1981 to 1986. Special editions include the Renegade, Laredo, and the Golden Eagle, which looks much like Daisy Duke's Jeep in the \"Dukes of Hazzard.\" Despite being spartan and utilitarian, the CJ still holds a special appeal that plush and modern Jeeps never will.\nJeep Dispatcher\nAs it was born out of a military contract, Jeep maintained strong ties with the government fulfilling contracts for military transport. Therefore, Jeep was well positioned to fulfill a contract supplying the United States Postal Service with mail delivery vehicles based on a call to test and develop new models in 1954. This was the first time the USPS commissioned a purpose-built vehicle, resulting in thousands of postal Jeeps visiting American homes every day but Sunday for decades.\nThe official model name of the postal Jeep is the Dispatcher. It rode on the same chassis as the CJ model from the year of development with the driver position moved to the right, an enclosed cargo box built onto the body, and a sliding door for easy access. They were offered in left- or right-hand drive with a choice of hard or canvas top and were offered to institutions other than the USPS, including the Jeep Gala, painted bright pink with a fringe top.\nThe choice of Jeep for mail delivery made sense as its 4-cylinder engine was economical, the suspension could handle cargo, and it would have no trouble delivering to the vast expanses of rural space across the country, but with no amenities whatsoever. They were replaced by the soon-to-be-replaced Grumman LLV in 1987. Regardless, they are true American icons that remain such a beloved part of the country's history, the USPS sold die-cast replicas as recently as 2020, more than 30 years after being retired.\nJeep Grand Wagoneer WS\nWhile the Grand Wagoneer of the '80s ushered in a level of luxury never before seen in Jeep vehicles, the re-introduction of the name ushers in a level of luxury exceeding not just Jeep, but many of its peers. After a couple of years of dormancy, Jeep revived the name for the 2022 Grand Wagoneer, which arrived with an imposing stature and filled with opulence usually reserved for luxury-only brands.\nJeep revealed a Wagoneer concept in 2020 indicating that it was headed for production as a 2022 model as part of a future Wagoneer line of vehicles. Looking back, the concept was actually a fully fleshed-out model as little changed when production models arrived. Regardless, the new Grand Wagoneer took its place atop the Jeep hierarchy as a large family-friendly luxury leader that happens to have classic Jeep off-roading skills in abundance. Unlike moderately priced Jeeps of old, retail on this one started near $100,000 and surpassed it on nicely trimmed models. It has only become more expensive in the intervening two years.\nThe new model looks to be ushering in a new upscale era for the Jeep brand, and it appears to be doing so with aplomb. There likely won't be many of these getting down and dirty in a few inches of mud, but it is nice to think that if one wanted to get their $100,000 Grand Wagoneer caked in filth without getting stuck, they could.\nJeep Wrangler\nAfter decades of producing essentially the same hardy off-roader, Jeep gave it an overhaul while nixing the alphanumeric naming and dubbed it the Wrangler. While this model underwent many changes at the time, perhaps none had the visual impact of the iconic round headlamps, jettisoned in favor of a pair of rectangles. This followed 1980s design trends favoring angular designs and sharp creases. It was still unmistakably a Jeep, but transformed into a modern Jeep.\nWhile the shape of the Wrangler largely followed its predecessor, more significant changes came underneath where suspension upgrades and a longer wheelbase contributed to increased stability, particularly on the highway. Furthermore, the newly released and wildly successful Cherokee lent its interior aesthetic to the Wrangler, which received a stylish and modern dashboard in place of the austere metal wall housing a couple of gauges. Nicely trimmed seats and durable carpet further enhanced the driving and ownership experience that, combined with a new fuel-injected 4.0-liter 6-cylinder engine, made the Wrangler a much more pleasant Jeep to live with than the outgoing model.\nThe Wrangler continued the Jeep tradition and its popularity has not waned. Still in production, it still honors past Jeeps while celebrating modern car design and technology. The round headlights have returned, but spartan interiors are a thing of the past as modern Jeeps are highly refined vehicles full of modern technology. With the Jeep Wrangler now in its fourth generation, its popularity remains solid and its success seems a foregone conclusion.\nJeepster Commando\nThe last vehicle introduced by Kaiser before selling Jeep to AMC was the 1967 Jeepster Commando, which continued to sell through the 1973 model year. This model actually resurrected the Jeepster name and layout from a model produced by the previous owner, Willys, which was produced from 1948 to 1951 in modest numbers. With stiff competition in the limited market for off-road vehicles at the time, Kaiser introduced this model to bring in buyers wanting a vehicle with more passenger and cargo space and better protection from the elements. Furthermore, it was intended to compete with the International Scout and Ford Bronco.\nThe Jeepster Commando was a much more sporty version of a Jeep, although it retained the same four-wheel-drive capabilities. Jeep offered it in three body styles, including wagon, convertible, and truck. Early buyers had only an old and underpowered Hurricane 4-cylinder engine with 75 horsepower or the Dauntless V6, which doubled power to about 150. While the Commando departed in styling from the CJ, it shared the spartan interior, receiving few optional extras.\nAMC bought Jeep from Kaiser and a couple of years later, the Commando received a facelift and better AMC engine choices. They attempted to bring the oddball Jeep up to spec to attract new buyers but they failed to materialize. Jeep only made about 11,000 of these vehicles per year, and when the new Chevy Blazer came out in 1969, it just could not compete. It was phased out after 1973.\nJeep Gladiator JT\nUnder Kaiser ownership, Jeep introduced a full-size truck in the early '60s called the Gladiator. Its production ended in 1971, but the latest iteration of the Jeep brand resurrected the name for a new Wrangler-based truck in 2020. Jeep has a long history of making pickups, although they have never been a core part of the brand. The Cherokee-based Comanche was last sold in 1992, and Jeep was without a pickup all the way until the new Gladiator debuted.\nThe idea for the Gladiator is not new. Jeep offered its CJ-base Scrambler from 1981 to 1986, although, unlike the new pickup, it only featured two doors. The new Gladiator is based upon a four-door Wrangler and features a small pickup bed out back. It is just five feet long with a payload capacity of 1,700 pounds and is clearly not a serious work truck. Perhaps the biggest advantage this model of Jeep offers is a solid roof, allowing for better interior materials protected from the elements, such as leather.\nWith the 2020 Jeep Gladiator, fans of the brand may have received what they always wanted, but its appeal outside of that group may be limited. Regardless, it remains a nice addition to the lineup and having more options in vehicles to choose from is never a bad thing. Furthermore, for those wanting more adventure, Hennessey built the Maximus, a Hemi-powered Gladiator with 1,000 horsepower for $200,000, a perfect choice for drivers with more money than sense.\nJeep Cherokee Chief\nAlthough Kaiser introduced the Wagoneer in 1963 and found success with it, AMC chose to change things up with the brand when it acquired Jeep in the '70s. As the Wagoneer had already been receiving upscale upgrades, such as power options, AMC wanted to move it further upscale into near-luxury territory. However, not wanting to eliminate the market for buyers wanting more sporty models, AMC split the model line in two and offered a two-door variant called Cherokee.\nThe sporty Cherokee model was introduced in 1974 and continued in production until 1983. It was discontinued to make way for what would become five generations of the successful downsized Jeep Cherokee XJ. Jeep offered a range of engines from the standard AMC straight-6 to the largest V8 ever found in a Jeep, the AMC 401 V8. The popular Cherokee Chief package debuted as a 1976 model, providing optional trim, wider fenders, and wide-track axles with larger tires, creating an imposing and impressive off-road look. A Golden Eagle package was also introduced and sold alongside the Chief in 1979 only.\nWhen the XJ Cherokee replaced the old full-size model, it was during a time of downsizing across the industry and all manufacturers moving to more efficient platforms. With this trend, it is not likely the Cherokee Chief could have survived much longer, but it remains an integral part of Jeep history and remains a valued collectible model today.\nWhy are these the best Jeep models?\nThe truth is that maybe they are not the best performance models. However, each of these models represents something significant for the Jeep brand. They introduced a new way of building vehicles for Jeep or simply an interesting body style that maybe did not sell so well, but it is as popular as ever today. Some of these have become coveted rarities that command attention on the auction block while others simply represent the best of what the brand is right now.\nThe other truth about these Jeeps is that selecting the best design can be subjective and you may not agree with these picks. If you are a Jeep fan and whether you agree or not, hopefully, you will see value in reading about all of these models and possibly learn something new. Unless you are rating models using specific parameters, such as horsepower or top speed, no list will ever be definitive."
