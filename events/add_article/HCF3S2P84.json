      "title": "Tariff turbulence: Surat's diamond industry faces third crisis in 17 years",
      "summary": "Surat’s diamond polishing sector is suffering after the U.S. imposed 26 % and later 55 % tariffs on gems and jewellery, cutting demand by up to 40 % and threatening 50,000‑300,000 jobs. Artisans and unit operators face reduced production and the need to find new buyers, while the U.S. market shrinks by about 6 % and other key markets decline as well. Industry leaders see lab‑grown diamonds and alternative markets such as the Gulf, Europe, and Australia as potential lifelines, but the high cost of natural stones and tariff‑driven price pressure remain major challenges. Despite the downturn, India’s skill base keeps it a preferred polishing hub, though the future depends on navigating tariffs and shifting consumer preferences.",
