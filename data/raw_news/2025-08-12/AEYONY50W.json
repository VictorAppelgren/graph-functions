  "content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Homeless people in DC will be given the option of going to a shelter \u2014 or, if they refuse, jail \u2014 as part of President Trump\u2019s sweeping crime crackdown in the capital, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThe new federal agencies who have been surging on the streets of the District of Columbia are going to enforce the laws that are already on the books here in Washington, DC,\u201d Leavitt said.\n\n\u201cFor far too long, these laws have been completely ignored and the homelessness problem has ravaged the city. So DC Code 22-1307 and DC Municipal Regulation 24-100 give the Metropolitan Police Department the authority to take action when it comes to homeless encampments.\u201d\n\nLeavitt said that \u201chomeless individuals will be given the option to leave their encampment, to be taken to a homeless shelter to be offered addiction or mental health services, and if they refuse, they will be susceptible to fines or to jail time again.\u201d\n\nTrump on Monday asserted federal control over the 3,400-officer DC Metropolitan Police Department and ordered the DC National Guard and hundreds of federal agents onto the streets to address crime.\n\nThe president cited many high-profile recent crimes in DC, including the Aug. 3 attack on former Department of Government Efficiency staffer Edward Coristine, 19, during an alleged attempted carjacking and the June 30 murder of congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, in a drive-by shooting.\n\n\u201cWhile we are targeting criminals and trying to remove criminals off of the streets, we also want to make DC safe and beautiful,\u201d Leavitt said Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThat involves removing mentally disturbed individuals and homeless encampments as well. So we will be using these regulations and codes that already exist to clean up our streets.\u201d\n\nLeavitt said that US Park Police, which has jurisdiction over most of DC\u2019s major traffic circles and triangles, will work alongside MPD to house or incarcerate the homeless, who during Mayor Muriel Bowser\u2019s prior cleanup attempts have migrated in response to crackdowns.\n\n\u201cThe United States Park Police has actually done remarkable work in terms of removing homeless encampments from the city,\u201d she said.\n\nSince March, \u201c70 homeless encampments have been removed by the US Park Police,\u201d Leavitt said.\n\n\u201cThere are only two homeless encampments remaining in DC federal parks under the National Park Service\u2019s jurisdiction, and the removal of those two remaining camps is scheduled for this week.\u201d",

That\u2019s how bad it is.\u201d\nIn a gut-wrenching interview with \u201cFox & Friends First,\u201d Tamara described the moment she heard the news and her world shattered.\n\u201cYou don\u2019t expect to find out that your son gets brutally murdered, not with one gunshot wound, but riddled with them. And my son was a good boy, and he didn\u2019t deserve this. Nobody does. No innocent victim deserves what we\u2019re going through, and there\u2019s a lot of us out there,\u201d she said tearfully.\nEric was in Washington, DC, serving as an intern for Rep. Ron Estes (R-Kan.) at the time of the incident.\nThe shooting, which authorities say didn\u2019t target Eric, also left a 16-year-old male and an adult female injured.\nTamara told Fox News\u2019 Carley Shimkus that no suspects have yet been apprehended to her knowledge and that the 16-year-old male was allegedly the target.\nShe called on city officials to stop \u201ccoddl[ing]\u201d criminals and adopt tough-on-crime policies that will prioritize the best interests of DC\u2019s constituents, visitors and workers.\nPresident Trump has threatened to address leadership lapses via a federal takeover of the nation\u2019s capital unless something changes.\nTamara, reacting to that prospect, said something needs to change for the better.\n\u201cUntil this [DC] council can get their act together, which \u2026 maybe it will never happen, I don\u2019t know \u2014 but I believe that it should happen and they should work. And they should not put contingencies on any of this \u2014 the council. The crime needs to go away. These gangs need to go, and people will just keep getting assaulted and murdered \u2026\n\u201cThis is our nation\u2019s capital,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt should be the safest in the country and then everybody else, all the other states, should be following suit on how to make their city safe. It\u2019s really scary in America.\u201d\nTrump also sent a letter to the Tarpinian-Jachym family after the incident. Tamara said the gesture \u201cmeant a lot\u201d to her, and that Estes\u2019 office has also been kind in the aftermath of the shooting."

Members reported hearing screams and called 911, before trying to resuscitate the young designer \u2013 who was later pronounced dead.\nThe good Samaritans told The Post they were woken by a naked man throwing sunscreen at their boat and saw him running down the dock screaming, \u201cDo something!\u201d\nDurnan, 60, a familiar figure at the club, owns the Durnan Group in Rockville Center, which manages the \u201clargest, most successful Workers Compensation Safety Group for Real Estate\u201d on the company\u2019s website.\nHe owns \u201cRipple\u201d and a second boat, \u201cHell in a Bucket,\u201d which was docked alongside and is also a shout-out to the Grateful Dead, several club members confirmed.\nDurnan did not return several requests for comment.\nSuffolk County cops have not filed charges or identified any suspects in the case. But authorities have also not publicly ruled out foul play, despite revealing that there was no evidence of violence to the body.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s death is also being investigated by Suffolk County\u2019s East End Drug Task Force, according to a Tuesday report by Newsday.\n\u201cUntil you start ruling stuff out, everything is in play,\u201d a source familiar with the investigation told the outlet.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra, a native of the tiny Irish town of Carlow, migrated to the US, where she started as a bottle service girl in SoHo before co-founding East x East, a swimwear label.\n\u201cI always knew I wanted to be successful, that I was money-driven, business-driven, and that fashion is a tough industry and it would be a slow road,\u201d she told the Irish Independent last year.\nHer partner in the East x East, Dylan Grace, posted a moving tribute on Instagram following her death.\n\u201cWe dreamed big together, laughed harder than anyone else could understand and built so much from nothing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m truly blessed and grateful to have had you in my life.\u201d\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra summered in the Hamptons, where she hosted successful pop-up shows and fashion exhibits for wealthy clientele in Montauk and the surrounding area.\nShe had finalized her divorce to ex-Sam Ryan just months before her death, according to court records reviewed by The Post.\n\u201cI represented Mr. Ryan in a matrimonial proceeding. The final papers had been submitted to the court, and before the Judgment of Divorce was issued, I became aware of Ms. Nolan-O\u2019slatarra\u2019s passing and promptly notified the court,\u201d his attorney, David Centeno, said in a statement. \u201cOut of respect for the privacy of those involved and my ethical restraints, I cannot discuss whether there was a prenuptial agreement, mediation, or other private arrangements.\u201d\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s heartbroken mother, Elma Nolan, told the Irish Independent on Aug. 7 that her daughter was planning a trip home to Carlow before her death.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to my daughter,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cI feel numb and in shock.\u201d\n\u2014 Additional reporting by Brandon Cruz, Joe Marino and Peter Senzamici"
