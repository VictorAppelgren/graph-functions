      "feedback": "To upgrade to world-class quality, tighten the causal chain and anchor every move to the source: explicitly trace policy input (CHIPS Act/Secure Enclave funding) to the non-voting equity issued and the day-one ~1.9B paper gain, then articulate how the governance restrictions produce signaling rather than control and a state-risk premium, citing (3ITAKK6XJ) for mechanics and numbers; enforce SECTION FOCUS by delivering exactly four one-sentence forecast items (two Up, two Down) with crisp time windows, drivers, watch points, and a single probability figure per line, and by eliminating any filler or broad hedging; sharpen first-principles grounding by naming the regime logic (signaling vs leverage) and by tying outcomes to concrete, quantifiable metrics (e.g., IRR ~17% from 1.9B on 11.1B funding, as implied by 3ITAKK6XJ) rather than qualitative vibes; strengthen scenario structure with explicit base/upside/downside milestones and invalidate-only conditions (e.g., if London magnets concessions fail, if Nvidia licensing is denied, if LA deployment becomes militarized) and tie each to a concrete trigger and a close watch list (IPV6H0CMO, RHXDOHQQX, OATKNJQ0E, NOTMRPS8C, PSRZJ6OCU, 04M4L5BHA, 0J41Q7KTX), ensuring all factual claims carry an ID; increase citation density by placing (ID) after any fact drawn from a source and reconcile any conflicts across the cited IDs (e.g., magnets’China control, Nvidia licensing framing, FAA budget, LA troop data) rather than treating them as separate threads; quantify risk/return where possible and standardize probabilities with explicit midpoint anchors (e.g., base 50%, alt1 20–35%, alt2 10–20%) so the 4 lines read as a coherent, actionable forecast rather than a collection of observations; ensure formatting consistency (Up/Down | window | driver | watch | probability) and keep each line to one sentence, with no filler.",
