      "feedback": "The draft commendably anchors a cross‑topic frame around p, u, and r with the Brookings automation exposure and the Regime A/B/C map, but to reach world‑class quality it needs a sharper causal spine, tighter quantification, and a concrete, testable scenario architecture; concretely, (1) replace broad assertions with a first‑principles mechanism map that specifies how AI‑driven productivity (p) lowers unit costs and lifts ROIC/capex, how persistent labor frictions (u) feed wage/price dynamics, and how the policy reaction function (r) modulates monetary tightening/float in yields and risk premia, tying each channel to at least one source (e.g., p→ROIC/capex via 22PL3Q360; u/wage rigidity via NL5YYTLF2; r path via NL5YYTLF2/UVEQ2SJ0W); (2) turn Regime A/B/C into a compact, explicit matrix with definitions, drivers, asset/FX implications, and probabilistic weights (and clearly flag where sources conflict, e.g., oil overhang vs demand trajectory) (NL5YYTLF2; T1QE6JPIX; 5S9GJV2O3); (3) restructure the cycle analysis into a base/base‑case versus upside/downside with explicit triggers and 1–3 quarter horizons (inflation surprises, policy guidance shifts, AI capex prints, oil‑supply moves, EV‑cycle data) and clear invalidation conditions; (4) attach quantitative paths to key outputs drawn from the cited IDs (Ford Q2 EV losses ≈ $1.3B, adj. EBIT ≈ 4.3%, ROIC ≈ 10.1%, revenue CAGR 2.5% from 2014–2024; ACMR 2025 revenue ~\\$900m, GM ~4%; Brent/WTI ranges in Regime A ~ mid‑60s/low‑60s, Regime B shifts) and show how these feed risk premia, yields, and EURUSD, with explicit sensitivity ranges; (5) enhance citation discipline by appending the exact IDs after each quantitative claim and by reconciling any conflicts (e.g., the regime probabilities and oil‑supply paths) in a short appendix; (6) deliver a compact 6‑signal watchlist with signal name, source, trigger, timing window, and clear invalidation; (7) prune duplication (avoid repeating Regime A logic across paragraphs) and state succinct fragility points (e.g., u a delta that could tilt to Regime B, an oil supply shock, a faster AI‑capex acceleration that alters pricing power); and (8) ensure the write‑up remains within the required length/format by replacing prose repetitions with a tight mechanism map and a single, consolidated watchlist.",
