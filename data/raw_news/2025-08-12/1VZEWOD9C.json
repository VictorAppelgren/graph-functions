  "content": "Travel to the US tumbled 3.1% in July \u2014 the latest in a slew of monthly declines as the Trump administration imposes strict curbs on travel and pursues tough negotiations on trade.\n\nThe most recent drop was fueled by a steep pullback from Germany, China and Switzerland, which were down 14.7%, 13.8% and 12.7% respectively, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office, a government agency that works with the Department of Homeland Security and US Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe latest data does not include travel from Canada and Mexico, the two largest feeder markets to the US, but lately both have seen steep drops.\n\nCanadians in particular have been canceling trips to the US, offended by President Trump\u2019s suggestion that they be annexed to the US as the 51st state.\n\nIn June, flights from Canada were down 22% and car crossings were down 33%, according to a report by travel trade publication Skift.\n\nApril represents the only exception to the downward trend, possibly because Easter fell in April instead of March. Overseas visitors increased 0.4% in April, but have been down since then.\n\nAmong the top 20 countries, six increased their travel to the US in July, including Japan by 9.1%, Dominican Republic, by 7.3%, Spain by 6.7% Italy, by 6.3%, Israel by 6.1% and Ireland up by 2.9%, according to NTTO.\n\nSpending on promoting the US as a destination was decimated after the the \u201cBig Beautiful Bill\u201d was passed in April.\n\nBrand USA, a public-private partnership that promotes travel here, saw its federal funds cut by 80% this year.\n\nInternational travelers are especially coveted because they spend more and stay longer.\n\nEvery 40 international visit supports one US job, according to NTTO.\n\nLast week, the largest hotel company in the world, Marriott International, cut its full year forecast for revenue and profits on slowing travel demand for its properties in the US.",

  "summary": "Travel to the US fell by 3.1% in July, the latest monthly decline due to the Trump administration's strict curbs on travel and tough negotiations on trade. The most recent drop was driven by a decrease in travel from Germany, China, and Switzerland, with Germany, Switzerland seeing a decline of 14.7%, 13.8% and 12.7% respectively. This does not include Canada and Mexico, the two largest US feeder markets, which have seen significant decreases in travel. The National Travel and Tourism Office reported that Canada, the country's largest market, has seen a decline in travel since June, with flights from Canada dropping 22% and car crossings dropping 33%. The decline is blamed on President Trump's proposal to annexe the 51st state of Canada.",

      "text": "Inside the enormous Biden effort to \u2018debank\u2019 Trump after Jan. 6\nThe scale of the effort to \u201cdebank\u201d Donald Trump because of pressure from Biden administration regulators went far beyond JPMorgan and Bank of America, The Post has learned.\nAt least 10 other financial institutions closed their windows to the billionaire real estate tycoon over his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol Hill melee.\nThe moves came in the months after Trump left the White House in 2021, sources inside the Trump Organization told me.\nThe stunning scale of the blacklisting is being revealed here for the first time.\nIt should be reported as much as possible for the simple reason that if any big bank can cancel a former president over politics as opposed to illegality, then every American citizen is in danger of facing the same mistreatment.\nFor expressing an opinion, or starting a business out of step with the progressive culture norms that have infected so much of society, you too can see your economic livelihood go up in smoke and \u201cdebanked.\u201d\nDebanking is such an odd word for one of the most insidious parts of cancel culture, and its sponsors like it that way.\nIt sanitizes, via clumsy, obtuse lingo, what is essentially something of dangerous Orwellian magnitude: negating an American citizen\u2019s ability to save, and conduct business through a big bank.\nThat\u2019s why Trump and Republicans like South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott are taking steps to end the politicization of banking.\nKeep in mind, there are already laws preventing the likes of JPMorgan, BofA and Capital One \u2014 the banks Trump has publicly stated canceled him \u2014 from being conduits for drug kingpins and Mafiosi.\n(Trump has sued Capital One, which denied Trump\u2019s allegations.)\nDebanking takes it further. It forces banks to remove customers who might pose nothing more than \u201creputational risk,\u201d a flighty rule enforced by bank regulators in recent years to keep financial institutions from doing business with people like Jeffrey Epstein.\nThe now-deceased convicted child sex predator was a JPMorgan customer for years, and in theory making it impossible for Epstein to finance his illegality sounds like what should be happening.\nThat is until you dig deeper.\nUnder pressure from the Biden administration, just after Trump lost the 2020 election and started to act out (which the last time I checked was his constitutional right), the enforcement of reputational risk took a decidedly political turn, bank officials tell me.\nIf you believe people at the two largest banks, Jamie Dimon\u2019s JPMorgan and Brian Moynihan\u2019s BofA, the Biden administration unleashed its bank regulatory cops at the Office of Comptroller of Currency, the FDIC and the semi-independent Federal Reserve to go beyond nixing perverted financiers from their platform.\nThey used the amorphous nature of what is reputational risk to enforce a political regime, the bank officials said.\nThe Bidenistas hated crypto, thought it was an affront to their power to control the economy, and pressured banks from doing business with this somewhat heterodox emerging industry, according to the bank sources.\nSo was anything related to guns and certain conservative religious organizations, they added.\nAnd most of all, anything MAGA, including the multibillion-dollar real estate and resort empire of Mr. MAGA himself, Donald J. Trump.\nSuch an effort isn\u2019t easy to prove because there\u2019s no direct smoking gun, no memo (at least not yet) telling banks to cancel Trump from their system.\nThe banks say the pressure was more subtle but still real: Failure to remove Trump or crypto types and others would result in heightened enforcement, harassment and possibly fines.\nThe banks decided to drop customers, even rich ones like Trump, because it wasn\u2019t worth the hassle.\nI have covered finance for three decades now and thought I saw it all: Bernie Madoff, Epstein, the 2008 financial crisis, Wall Street scandals, penny stock scams and hedge fund implosions.\nBut what happened to Trump in 2021 was truly surprising given the breadth of big banks dropping him as a client and scary given their rationale.\nAs bad as the events of Jan. 6 were, Trump did tell the crowd that crazy afternoon to protest peacefully.\nTrump didn\u2019t break the law holding a rally.\nYou may disagree with his rhetoric that day.\nHe had just lost a closely fought election against Joe Biden.\nTrump said he really won it.\nMillions of people seemed to agree.\nHe wouldn\u2019t be the first politician to pull that lever. Democrat Stacey Abrams never really fully conceded when she lost in her first attempt to become governor of Georgia against Republican Brian Kemp.\nHow many times did Hillary Clinton say Trump was an \u201cillegitimate president\u201d after she lost the 2016 contest to him?\nDuring the violent social justice protests of 2020, Gwen Walz, the wife of Minnesota Gov. and 2024 Democrat VP candidate Tim Walz, said she \u201ckept the windows\u201d open to smell the burning debris.\n\u201cI felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening,\u201d she said.\nOr how about what Kamala Harris proudly said around the same time.\nThe then-Biden VP candidate, who went on to get trounced by Trump in 2024, supported the defunding of the police movement that led to much more mayhem than what occurred on Jan. 6.\nHer rationale for the \u201clargely peaceful protests\u201d that burned cities to the ground, delivered to fellow-traveler lefty late-night host Stephen Colbert, is at least as cringey as anything Trump said on Jan. 6.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not going to stop,\u201d she said during an appearance on the show.\n\u201cThey\u2019re not. This is a movement. I\u2019m telling you. They\u2019re not going to stop, and everyone, beware . . . That they\u2019re not going to let up. And they should not, and we should not.\u201d\nDid Jamie Dimon tell Harris that her money isn\u2019t good at JPM?"

      "text": "Coding students whose jobs were taken by AI forced to find work at Chipotle\nWhen Manasi Mishra began studying computer science, she envisioned a future writing code for major tech companies, not rolling burritos.\nBut the recent Purdue University graduate has been unable to land a job in her chosen field as tech companies increasingly turn to artificial intelligence to perform entry-level tasks.\n\u201cI just graduated with a computer science degree, and the only company that has called me for an interview is Chipotle,\u201d the frustrated Mishra said in a TikTok video earlier this summer, which has been viewed nearly 150,000 times.\nMishra\u2019s experience underscores a jarring shift in the job market for new coders.\nAccording to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the unemployment rate for recent computer science graduates is 6.1%, and 7.5% for computer engineering majors \u2014 both above the 5.3% average for all recent graduates and roughly double the 3% rate for majors like biology and art history.\n\u201cI\u2019m very concerned,\u201d Jeff Forbes, a former program director for computer science education and workforce development at the National Science Foundation, told the New York Times.\n\u201cComputer science students who graduated three or four years ago would have been fighting off offers from top firms \u2014 and now that same student would be struggling to get a job from anyone.\u201d\nFor more than a decade, tech leaders, billionaires and even US presidents encouraged young people to \u201clearn to code,\u201d promising that programming skills would all but guarantee a six-figure starting salary and job security.\nWhile there have been a handful of winners in the AI economy, with some commanding enormous paychecks as valuations of AI firms skyrocket. the majority of those companies employ relatively few people.\nDario Amodei, chief executive of AI developer Anthropic, has warned that AI could wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs within the next one to five years.\nThe arrival of AI coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot, CodeRabbit and others has accelerated the decline for entry-level programming roles, which are among the easiest for companies to automate.\nEconomists and industry executives say the hiring slowdown is also tied to post-pandemic overstaffing, aggressive cost-cutting, high interest rates and widespread hiring freezes.\nWhile experts debate how much of the current downturn is directly caused by AI versus the business cycle, there\u2019s little disagreement that junior coding positions are under intense pressure.\nThe result is a labor market that looks very different from a few years ago.\nZach Taylor, a 2023 graduate of Oregon State University, told the Times he\u2019s applied for nearly 5,800 tech jobs, leading to just 13 interviews and zero offers.\nEven the company where he interned couldn\u2019t take him on full-time.\nAfter trying to land a role at McDonald\u2019s and being rejected \u201cfor lack of experience,\u201d he moved back home to Sherwood, Ore., and began collecting unemployment.\n\u201cIt is difficult to find the motivation to keep applying,\u201d he told the Times.\nFor many job seekers, the application process has become a gauntlet: online coding assessments, live technical tests and multiple interviews, only to be turned down or ignored.\nSome describe the experience as \u201cbleak\u201d or \u201csoul-crushing.\u201d Others say they feel \u201cgaslit\u201d by an industry that once told them software skills were a golden ticket.\nIn San Francisco, billboards advertise AI coding tools that promise to write or debug code faster than humans.\nCodeRabbit, while not as widely used as Copilot, is praised for features like real-time collaboration and context-aware code reviews. These tools, coupled with a glut of applicants, mean companies can produce more software with fewer junior engineers.\nAudrey Roller, who recently graduated with a degree in data science from Worcester, Mass.-based Clark University, told the Times she writes her own applications without AI tools in hopes of standing out from the automated crowd.\nBut when one company sent a rejection email just three minutes after she applied, she suspected an algorithm had made the decision.\n\u201cSome companies are using AI to screen candidates and removing the human aspect,\u201d she told the Times.\nThe downturn has also gutted a parallel pipeline into tech: coding bootcamps.\nFor over a decade, these intensive programs offered a route into high-paying engineering jobs for people without traditional computer science degrees.\nNow, many are seeing their job placement rates collapse, Reuters reported.\nJonathan Kim, who paid nearly $20,000 for a part-time program at Codesmith in 2023, has applied to more than 600 software engineering roles with no offers.\nHe now works at his uncle\u2019s ice cream shop in Los Angeles while continuing to code on open-source projects.\n\u201cThey sold a fake dream of a great job market,\u201d he told Reuters.\nAt Codesmith, just 37% of students in the 2023 part-time cohort landed full-time tech jobs within six months, down from 83% in late 2021, according to the Council on Integrity in Results Reporting.\nPlacement rates at other bootcamps have similarly fallen into the 37\u201350% range for some cohorts.\nThe company told Reuters that the market is \u201ctough\u201d but notes that 70% of its full-time graduates found jobs within a year.\nIndustry veterans say this environment is pushing tech companies back toward a traditional hiring model that favors graduates of elite universities such as MIT and Stanford, reversing some of the diversity gains bootcamps once supported.\n\u201cThey\u2019re sending their recruiters to MIT and Stanford and wining and dining the top students,\u201d Michael Novati, co-founder of Formation Dev, which trains experienced engineers for interviews, told Reuters.\nWith Post wires"

      "text": "Spirit Airlines could soon go out of business \u2014 months after declaring bankruptcy\nSpirit Airlines is warning that it may not survive the next year unless it can quickly raise more cash \u2014 just five months after emerging from bankruptcy protection.\nThe budget airline said in a report Monday that fewer people are booking leisure trips within the US and tough competition from other carriers is making it hard to hit the money targets it promised after bankruptcy.\nThe company cautioned that failure to secure additional funds could trigger loan defaults and force it to sell assets, including planes, airport gates and real estate.\nThe airline\u2019s management said it faces \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d about its ability to keep operating beyond the next 12 months without fresh capital, citing uncertainty over the success of cost-cutting efforts and ongoing talks with stakeholders.\nSpirit also disclosed it may have to provide more collateral to its credit card processing partner to keep that relationship in place.\nSpirit\u2019s warning marks the latest setback in a turbulent period for the Florida-based airline, known for its bright yellow planes and low-cost fares.\nIt filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November, becoming the first major US carrier to do so since 2011.\nThe filing followed years of mounting losses, a failed takeover bid by JetBlue Airways, shifting passenger preferences toward more premium services and a large-scale engine recall that left many of its jets grounded.\nCOVID-19\u2019s lingering effects, supply chain disruptions and heavy debt loads added to the strain.\nAfter rejecting a merger offer from Frontier Airlines in February, Spirit completed its Chapter 11 restructuring in March.\nThe plan wiped out roughly $795 million in debt, brought in $350 million in new equity and set up a $275 million credit line.\nThen-CEO Ted Christie remained in place to lead a new strategy aimed at appealing to higher-spending travelers, revamping the frequent flyer program and boosting partnerships to increase revenue per passenger.\nBut the recovery has been rocky.\nChristie, who was due to receive a $3.8 million retention bonus, stepped down as CEO in late April. He was replaced by Dave Davis, former president and chief financial officer of Sun Country Airlines.\nChristie left the airline having received more than $4 million in bonuses as part of his 2024 compensation \u2014 plus a $1.5 million separation payment after leaving the company.\nIn June, Spirit reported a $143 million net loss for the first quarter of 2025, along with a warning that it still faced \u201cgoing concern\u201d risks.\nBy late July, the airline announced plans to furlough 270 pilots and reassign 140 others in a bid to conserve cash, even as it promoted new routes to Key West and the Cayman Islands starting later this year.\nThe company hoped that adding destinations could help drive bookings, but industry headwinds continued to mount.\nIn its latest earnings report, Spirit posted a second-quarter net loss of $245.8 million, widening from $192.9 million in the same period last year.\nThe company said elevated capacity in the domestic market \u2014 meaning more seats for sale than demand could absorb \u2014 has kept ticket prices under pressure.\nHigher operating costs, combined with tariffs imposed earlier this year, have further eroded margins. These challenges have hit low-cost carriers like Spirit especially hard because they rely heavily on price-sensitive leisure travelers.\nThe airline\u2019s troubles also reflect broader difficulties in the aviation industry. While some competitors have been able to offset weaker domestic demand with strong international traffic, Spirit\u2019s business is still centered on short-haul leisure routes, leaving it more exposed when vacation travel slows.\nManagement said that without significant improvement in its finances or a major infusion of cash, it may not be able to comply with the minimum liquidity requirements in its credit agreements.\nSpirit\u2019s latest moves to shore up its finances include exploring the sale of non-core assets such as surplus planes, airport gates and slots.\nHowever, the company acknowledged in its filing that there is no guarantee these efforts will succeed or be completed quickly enough to prevent further strain."

      "text": "Marriott trims full-year forecast for revenue, profit as travel demand to US falters\nMarriott International \u2013 the largest hotel company in the world \u2013 cut its full-year forecast for revenue growth and profit as travel demand in the US slows, the company said on Tuesday.\nTotal room revenue in the US and Canada was flat for the second quarter, up just 1%, compared to a year ago, the Bethesda, Md.-based reported.\nThe slowdown is mostly hitting its lower-cost hotels that include Marriott Courtyard, Fairfield Inn and SpringHill Suites, which were also hard hit by a 17% decline in bookings from government workers, the company said.\n\u201cThe low end of the travel segment is underperforming across the board right now,\u201d Morningstar analyst Dan Wasiolek said. \u201cThere is still elevated inflation in areas of the economy that is impacting budget-conscious customers.\u201d\nMarriott said it now expects 2025 revenue growth of 1.5% to 2.5%, below its previous guidance of 1.5% to 3.5% growth. It also lowered its profit guidance to $9.82 to $10.08 per share down, from $9.85 to $10.08.\nThe company blamed \u201cheightened macro-economic uncertainty\u201d due to trade policy changes.\nMarriott\u2019s luxury hotel brands, including the Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis and JW Marriott, saw a 4.1% increase in room revenue in the US and Canada in second the quarter.\nThe average room rate for luxury properties was $417 compared with $161 for its budget properties, according to Wasiolek.\nMarriott\u2019s total revenue rose 5% to $6.74 billion, fueled by its upscale properties and overseas business.\nThe company did not address international tourism to the US but there have been widespread reports of a pullback in visitors from Canada, Mexico and other countries due to blowback over President Trump\u2019s tariffs.\nMarriott CEO credited the signing of Trump\u2019s Big Beautifull Bill into law last month, for helping to curtail uncertainty that had depressed business.\n\u201cIn some ways, the best thing about [the bill] is that it\u2019s done. The level of uncertainty, both among consumers and among our owners and franchisees, improves meaningfully with the signature on that bill,\u201d Capuano said on an earnings call."

The Fort Lauderdale area especially is flush with Canadians, with many returning to the same spots winter after winter. This year the area had been expecting between 1.3 and 1.5 million Canadian visitors, spending $950-975 million dollars.\n\u201cCanadian snowbirds are just part of the fabric of this community all winter long, and have been for decades \u2013 at least 50 years,\u201d Stacy Ritter, CEO of Visit Lauderdale, told The Post.\nRitter said she\u2019s already been fielding emails from regulars who explained why they\u2019re not coming back.\nIt felt like a \u201cgut punch\u201d lamented Ritter. \u201cIt makes me want to cry.\u201d\nNorth of the 49th parallel, the owner of Maple Leaf Tours, who sells packaged group travel, told The Post an \u201calarming\u201d number of vacationers cancelled US tours this year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s taken a turn for the worse across the industry,\u201d said Kristine Geary.\nShe estimates US cancellations at 40%, and her losses in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen this,\u201d said Geary, whose family has owned the business for more than 30 years.\nAmericans, meanwhile, haven\u2019t been boycotting Canadian travel.\nIn January, the number of US travelers to Canada by car was 707,000, up more than 23% from the same month last year, according to Statistics Canada data.\nThat same Reddit group sees the occasional American asking if it\u2019s still okay for them to visit Canada.\n\u201cI\u2019m all for Americans coming up and supporting us!\u201d writes one Canuck.\n\u201cJust don\u2019t make any jokes towards us becoming a 51st state. I\u2019ll lose my s\u2013t.\u201d\nRep. Nick LaLota (R-NY) offered somewhat of an olive branch to the Great White North.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll happily welcome our little brother back\u2014whether it\u2019s as our 51st state or a trading partner at a table that\u2019s more balanced,\u201d he said."

      "text": "Big Apple tourism is at risk of tanking as travelers get rattled by swooning stock markets and rising geopolitical tensions, according to industry experts and data reviewed by The Post.\nHospitality executives say it\u2019s too early to call, but they\u2019re increasingly on edge because of recent declines in hotel bookings, as well as drops in foot traffic and ticket sales to key attractions.\nJust 22.5% of the city\u2019s hotel rooms were booked for July as of April 7, according to industry data tracker CoStar. That\u2019s down a whopping 11.5% from the same time a year ago, when 25.4% of rooms had been booked.\nTravelers still may end up booking rooms closer to the date if consumer moods improve, according to Jan Frietag, CoStar\u2019s national director of hospitality. Still, he said the data show how skittish travelers have lately become.\n\u201cWe are not quite ready to call it a prolonged downturn,\u201d Freitag told The Post. But New York City \u201cprobably hasn\u2019t seen this kind of deceleration since 2020.\u201d\nThe sluggish trend extends all the way to the holidays, with New York City hotel bookings for October, November and December down 20.6%, 19% and 19%, respectively, according to the data.\nThe Big Apple\u2019s tourism bureau \u2013 NYC Tourism + Conventions \u2013 still expects the city to finally shake off its COVID hangover and exceed the 66.6 million visitors it lured in 2019. The city currently estimates that 12.9 million overseas travelers came to the Big Apple in 2024 versus the 13.5 million that came in 2019.\n\u201cWe are committed to adapting to the ever-evolving landscape while continuing to market NYC worldwide,\u201d said Julie Coker, President and CEO of NYC Tourism + Conventions.\nNevertheless, trade wars and hassles at US borders for overseas travelers are starting to take a toll, according to industry players.\nThe Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island have seen ticket sales drop 5% through April, said Mike Burke, Chief Operating Officer of Statue City Cruises, which is owned by Hornblower.\n\u201cAll of our competitors and other attractions are down as well,\u201d Burke said, adding that peers in the tourism industry regularly compare notes. \u201cWe share the trends and they are all headed the same way.\u201d\nFoot traffic in Times Square rose by just 1.8% this year through April 16 versus a year ago. That\u2019s well short of the 7.3% jump it saw last year during the same time period, according to the Times Square Alliance.\nAt the Park Lane New York, which has stunning views of Central Park South, front office executives are worried about attracting visitors from the United Kingdom, Germany, Mexico and Brazil this summer, said managing director Niles Harris.\n\u201cWe are starting to see a pullback from those countries,\u201d Harris told The Post. \u201cIt\u2019s enough to get our attention.\u201d\nThe Park Lane also is getting more queries over the phone from guests who are looking for deals and promotions.\n\u201cPeople are more value conscious than they were a year ago,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThey want a better deal.\u201d\nLast year, New York metro area airports had their \u201cbusiest year ever\u201d in 2024, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. New York City\u2019s hotel occupancy rate of 84.3% in 2024 was the highest of the top 25 markets in the country, according to CoStar data.\nBut business lately has ducked in and out of positive territory. This month, occupancy was 83.8% as of April 12, up 0.3% versus last year. In March, it dropped 1.1% after rising 2.3% and 1.3% in January and February, respectively.\n\u201cWe are seeing the booking pace slow from Europe, Canada and Asia,\u201d said one hotelier who did not want to be identified, adding that \u201cNYC is a global city. The international segment is a very important business.\u201d\nNew York City is hardly alone.\nThe number of non-citizen arrivals by plane to the US dropped by nearly 10% in March, according to data from the International Trade Administration.\nCanadian flight reservations to the US alone are down a whopping 70% through September compared to the same period last year, according to an OAG Aviation Worldwide report.\n\u201cUS tariff announcements and a more aggressive stance toward historical allies have hurt global opinions about the US,\u201d Goldman Sachs economists Joseph Briggs and Megan Peters said in a March 31 report."

  "argos_summary": "Travel to the US declined by 3.1% in July, largely due to significant drops from Germany, China, and Switzerland, as well as a notable decrease in Canadian travelers reacting to US trade policies. The downturn in international travel is compounded by a broader slowdown in the tech job market, where recent graduates struggle to find positions due to AI automation and hiring freezes. Additionally, Spirit Airlines faces potential bankruptcy again, citing reduced leisure travel and competition, while Marriott has lowered its revenue forecasts amid similar trends in hotel bookings.",
