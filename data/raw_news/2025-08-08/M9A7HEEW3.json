  "description": "NYSE:BLD 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore TopBuild's Fair Values from the Community and select yours It's been...",
  "content": "Explore TopBuild's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\n\n\nIt's been a pretty great week for TopBuild Corp. (NYSE:BLD) shareholders, with its shares surging 12% to US$413 in the week since its latest second-quarter results. The result was positive overall - although revenues of US$1.3b were in line with what the analysts predicted, TopBuild surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$5.32 per share, modestly greater than expected. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. Readers will be glad to know we've aggregated the latest statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their mind on TopBuild after the latest results.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nFollowing last week's earnings report, TopBuild's twelve analysts are forecasting 2025 revenues to be US$5.23b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to decrease 8.4% to US$19.46 in the same period. Yet prior to the latest earnings, the analysts had been anticipated revenues of US$5.20b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$19.44 in 2025. The consensus analysts don't seem to have seen anything in these results that would have changed their view on the business, given there's been no major change to their estimates.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for TopBuild\n\nThe consensus price target rose 10% to US$435despite there being no meaningful change to earnings estimates. It could be that the analystsare reflecting the predictability of TopBuild's earnings by assigning a price premium. It could also be instructive to look at the range of analyst estimates, to evaluate how different the outlier opinions are from the mean. There are some variant perceptions on TopBuild, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$466 and the most bearish at US$320 per share. Analysts definitely have varying views on the business, but the spread of estimates is not wide enough in our view to suggest that extreme outcomes could await TopBuild shareholders.\n\nAnother way we can view these estimates is in the context of the bigger picture, such as how the forecasts stack up against past performance, and whether forecasts are more or less bullish relative to other companies in the industry. It's pretty clear that there is an expectation that TopBuild's revenue growth will slow down substantially, with revenues to the end of 2025 expected to display 0.7% growth on an annualised basis. This is compared to a historical growth rate of 15% over the past five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 3.4% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than TopBuild.",

      "text": "Results\n22\nMidstream oil and gas companies, specifically pipeline operators, are well-positioned to benefit from Trump\u2019s executive orders on fossil fuels enacted in early 2025. \u2013 \u2013 These policies aim to accelerate infrastructure development by streamlining environmental reviews and permitting processes, such as those under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling. Pipelines and storage facilities will be critical to moving larger volumes of oil and gas efficiently, especially with the renewed emphasis on LNG exports to meet global demand.\n22 companies\nChevron\nMarket Cap: US$312.8b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in the integrated energy and chemicals operations in the United States and internationally.\nCVX\nUS$153.16\n7D\n1.0%\n1Y\n6.0%\nWilliams Companies\nMarket Cap: US$71.6b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in the United States.\nWMB\nUS$57.89\n7D\n-3.4%\n1Y\n32.0%\nKinder Morgan\nMarket Cap: US$59.4b\nOperates as an energy infrastructure company primarily in North America.\nKMI\nUS$26.76\n7D\n-4.6%\n1Y\n27.0%\nCheniere Energy\nMarket Cap: US$52.3b\nAn energy infrastructure company, primarily engages in the liquefied natural gas (LNG) related businesses in the United States.\nLNG\nUS$235.27\n7D\n-0.3%\n1Y\n30.5%\nMarathon Petroleum\nMarket Cap: US$49.4b\nOperates as an integrated downstream energy company in the United States.\nMPC\nUS$161.51\n7D\n-5.1%\n1Y\n-7.3%\nONEOK\nMarket Cap: US$47.4b\nOperates as a midstream service provider of gathering, processing, fractionation, transportation, storage, and marine export services in the United States.\nOKE\nUS$75.48\n7D\n-8.1%\n1Y\n-11.5%\nDT Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$10.6b\nProvides integrated natural gas services in the United States.\nDTM\nUS$104.21\n7D\n1.4%\n1Y\n40.4%\nAntero Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.9b\nOwns, operates, and develops midstream energy assets in the Appalachian Basin.\nAM\nUS$18.46\n7D\n0.6%\n1Y\n31.2%\nHess Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$8.8b\nOwns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream assets and provide fee-based services to Hess and third-party customers in the United States.\nHESM\nUS$41.02\n7D\n-5.8%\n1Y\n13.9%\nKinetik Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$6.4b\nThrough its subsidiaries, operates as a midstream company in the Texas Delaware Basin.\nKNTK\nUS$41.53\n7D\n-4.3%\n1Y\n0.3%\nPBF Energy\nMarket Cap: US$2.6b\nThrough its subsidiaries, engages in refining and supplying petroleum products.\nPBF\nUS$22.30\n7D\n-1.3%\n1Y\n-40.7%\nRattler Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$2.2b\nRattler Midstream LP owns, operates, develops, and acquires midstream and energy-related infrastructure assets in the Midland and Delaware Basins of the Permian Basin.\nRTLR\nUS$15.22\n7D\n3.5%\n1Y\n45.0%\nPar Pacific Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.4b\nOperates as an energy company in the United States.\nPARR\nUS$27.13\n7D\n-13.5%\n1Y\n9.9%\nDelek US Holdings\nMarket Cap: US$1.2b\nEngages in the integrated downstream energy business in the United States.\nDK\nUS$20.74\n7D\n-7.3%\n1Y\n2.3%\nClean Energy Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$448.6m\nOffers natural gas as alternative fuels for vehicle fleets and related fueling solutions in the United States and Canada.\nCLNE\nUS$2.04\n7D\n0.5%\n1Y\n-31.3%\nOPAL Fuels\nMarket Cap: US$409.2m\nEngages in the production and distribution of renewable natural gas (RNG) for use as a vehicle fuel for heavy and medium-duty trucking fleets throughout the United States.\nOPAL\nUS$2.26\n7D\n-4.6%\n1Y\n-38.6%\nSummit Midstream\nMarket Cap: US$304.9m\nFocuses on owning, developing, and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets primarily shale formations in the continental United States.\nSMC\nUS$24.84\n7D\n-2.5%\n1Y\n-32.9%\nGranite Falls Energy\nMarket Cap: US$91.1m\nEngages in the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products in the continental United States.\nGFGY\nUS$2,975.00\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a\nStabilis Solutions\nMarket Cap: US$89.3m\nAn energy transition company, provides turnkey clean energy production, storage, transportation, and fueling solutions primarily using liquefied natural gas (LNG) to various end markets in North America.\nSLNG\nUS$4.45\n7D\n-3.3%\n1Y\n7.2%\nVivakor\nMarket Cap: US$47.0m\nOperates, acquires, and develops technologies and assets in the oil and gas industry in the United States and Kuwait.\nVIVK\nUS$0.95\n7D\n-13.6%\n1Y\n-51.5%\nMirage Energy\nMarket Cap: US$684.0k\nThrough its subsidiaries, focuses on developing an integrated pipeline and natural gas storage facility in Mexico and the United States.\nMRGE\nUS$0.0013\n7D\n8.3%\n1Y\n-81.9%\nEnergtek\nMarket Cap: US$51.4k\nProvides natural gas delivery solutions based on mobile pipe-less technologies and products.\nEGTK\nUS$0.0001\n7D\n0%\n1Y\nn/a"
