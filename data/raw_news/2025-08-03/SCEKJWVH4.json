  "content": "The financial giant behind the Apple Card is changing, but users are unlikely to see any big changes.\n\nThe transition of the Apple Card from being financed by Goldman Sachs to JPMorgan Chase will probably cut out a smaller company, CoreCard, that currently handles the credit card.\n\nGoldman has been using fintech payment processing company CoreCard to manage the Apple Card business, reports the Wall Street Journal\n\nWhen JPMorgan takes over, however, it will likely drop CoreCard as the Apple Card's processor in favor of its own in-house payment processing. Before it got the Apple account and its estimated 12 million users, CoreCard was considered a niche processor.\n\nCoreCard currently manages the day-to-day functioning of the Apple Card, ensuring that transactions are completed and handling the billing of users. It is also CoreCard that has been responsible for developing some of the distinctive features of the card alongside Apple, like its first-of-the-month billing cycle.\n\nCoreCard also developed the \"payment wheel\" graphic on its bills that show cardholders their projected interest costs, widely seen as consumer-friendly and educational. JPMorgan Chase will be responsible for the Apple Card once Goldman Sachs exits the consumer market.\n\nFor users of the Apple Card, the changes are likely to be perceived as minor. Goldman Sachs, which currently manages the card, announced in 2023 that it would be withdrawing from the consumer credit market. It originally took on the Apple Card in 2019.\n\nChanges unlikely in the short term\n\nBecause JPMorgan Chase has its own processing capabilities, CoreCard owner Richard Strange believes it likely that the Apple Card processing job will go in-house, dropping CoreCard.\n\nThe transition will mean the loss of its biggest client. When Goldman first announced in early 2023 that it would be withdrawing from consumer lending, CoreCard's stock fell some 70 percent.\n\nThe stock has recovered some ground since then. The change, however, forced CoreCard to sell itself to Euronet, which provides debit-card processing for banks and other financial firms mostly in Europe and Asia.\n\nJPMorgan will be unlikely to make noticeable changes to how Apple Card holders are handled as the transition completes.\n\nThe card's features, including CoreCard's billing cycle and graphic presentation of payment options, have proven popular with users. Thus, any new features or changes will presumably be rolled out over time.\n\nJPMorgan has not spoken about its future plans for the Apple Card. Euronet bought CoreCard for $248 million in an all-stock deal.",

  "summary": "The Apple Card is changing from being financed by Goldman Sachs to JPMorgan Chase, but users are unlikely to see any significant changes. The change will likely eliminate CoreCard, which currently manages the Apple Card, from JPMorgan Chase. Goldman Sachs has been using CoreCard for its Apple Card business, but when JPMorgan Chase takes over, it will likely drop CoreCard in favor of its own in-house payment processing. This will result in the loss of CoreCard's main client, Goldman Sachs, which is exiting the consumer credit market.

      "text": "Apple Card\nAll about Apple Card\nTable of Contents\n- Apple Card\n- 1. Applying\n- 2. Physical card\n- 3. Fees, rates, and limits\n- 4. Monthly installment plans\n- 5. Use with Apple Pay\n- 6. Wallet app\n- 7. Q&A\n- How do you apply for Apple Card?\n- What kind of credit do you need to be approved for Apple Card?\n- Is the Apple Card really titanium?\n- Does Apple Card offer cash back or rewards?\n- 8. Controversy\n- Denied Applications\n- Discrimination accusations\n- iPhone 13 pre-order issues through iUP\nLaunched on August 20, 2019, the Apple Card was designed by Apple and developed by Goldman Sachs. While it's primarily designed to work with Apple Pay in the Apple Wallet app, Apple provides each customer with a physical titanium card.\nGoldman Sachs had stated that this was the \"most successful credit card launch ever.\" Both Apple and Goldman Sachs have been pleased with the amount of consumer demand for the Apple credit card.\nThe card is issued through Goldman Sachs and exists within the Mastercard payment network.\nApplying for the Apple Card\nApplying for the card is a relatively quick and straightforward process. A prospective applicant will need to follow the steps below.\n- Open Wallet.\n- Tap the + symbol in the top-right corner.\n- Tap Apple Card, then Continue.\n- Fill in the name, date of birth, email address, and phone number fields, then tap Next.\n- Review the offer of credit limit and APR from Goldman Sachs, then tap Accept Apple Card.\n- On the Card Added screen, tap Continue to add it to Apple Pay on the device.\nPhysical card\nThe physical card is made primarily out of titanium, weighing 14.75 grams, or approximately half an ounce. The weight makes it somewhat lighter than other \"luxury\" style metal cards. A composite of 90% titanium and 10% aluminum alloy gives the card better sturdiness overall.\nThe card displays no card number, CVV security code, expiration date, or signature. The cardholder's name is printed on the front of the card, while the Apple, MasterCard, and Goldman Sachs logos are engraved.\nThis design choice lends itself to a rather minimalistic and sleek-looking card compared to competitors' offerings.\nUpon delivery, Apple Card holders who own newer iOS devices can activate the physical card by moving it near the product packaging. Those with an iPhone X or earlier will need to open Wallet and tap it against their iPhone.\nFees, rates, and limits\nDepending on the cardholder's credit history and income, there is a minimum APR of 13.24% and a maximum of 24.24%. The Apple Card has no yearly fees, no fees for transactions, and no fees for penalties.\nIt does have credit limits. The limits are determined by the cardholder's credit score, credit age, and income at the time of application. Apple Card holders have reported credit limits as low as $50 and as high as $15,000.\nAn Apple Card may be shared using Apple Card Family. It requires each person to be over 13 years old to share the card.\nMonthly Installment Plans\nUsers can purchase iPhones using their Apple Card and pay it off with a 0% interest rate over 24 months so long as they select a carrier at checkout. The 3% cashback still applies, thus giving users a great value when purchasing their new iPhone.\nAn update to the service in June 2020 allows users to purchase almost any Apple device or accessory on some length of the installment plan. Depending on price, users can buy devices on 6-month or 12-month installment plans at 0% interest.\nInstallment plans are available for the following:\n- iPhone\n- iPad\n- Apple Watch\n- Mac\n- Apple TV\n- AirPods\n- Apple Pencil\n- iPad Keyboard\n- Pro Stand, VESA Mount Adapter\n- Apple Afterburner Card\n- Apple Branded iPhone Case\n- Apple Watch Bands\n- Apple Branded iPad Cover\n- Apple Branded Mac Cover\n- MagSafe Charger\n- Apple Branded MagSafe iPhone Case\n- Apple Branded iPhone Leather Wallet with MagSafe\nOne can also bundle devices, like an Apple Pencil and iPad, increasing the installment plan to 12 months despite the individual products' lower pricing.\nUse with Apple Pay\nWhile users can place orders with their physical card, the Apple Card is designed to be used alongside Apple Pay. Apple Pay is the company's touchless, tap-to-pay payment method. Those who use their card with Apple Pay receive additional cashback benefits that can be applied to Apple Cash or Apple Savings account balances. The Apple Card can also be used with Apple Pay online.\nUsing the card via Apple Pay, either online or at a point-of-sale terminal will merit a user 2% cashback in the form of Apple Cash at most retailers. Cardholders may earn 3% back when using the card for Apple Pay purchases at participating stores and retailers, including Uber, Walgreens, and Nike.\nA cardholder can view their Apple Cash or Apple Savings account balance in Apple Wallet. A cardholder can use Apple Cash at retailers, send to others via iMessages, withdraw to a bank account, or use it to pay down the Apple Card balance. Money in Apple Savings grows at 3.65% APY (as of May 28, 2025).\nThe Wallet app\nCardholders can view additional information about their card inside Wallet on their iPhone. There, they can see any outstanding balance, remaining credit, weekly activity, itemized transactions, and make payments.\nThe Wallet app also provides insights into how a user may better use their card to avoid paying interest on their outstanding balance.\nCardholders can also send a text message to Apple support for help understanding their bills or to file a dispute.\nThe wallet app also can export transaction data in multiple formats, including CSV, Quicken, and Quick Books.\nCommon Apple Card Questions\nHow do you apply for Apple Card?\nThe Apple Card can only be applied for within the Wallet app. You can start applying by clicking the plus-button in the top right corner.\nWhat kind of credit do you need to be approved for Apple Card?\nApple does not specify what qualifies individuals for the card. There is a minimum APR of 13.24% and a maximum APR of 24.24% depending on your credit. The Apple Card has no yearly fees, no fees for transactions, and no fees for penalties.\nIs the Apple Card really titanium?\nApproximately 90% of Apple Card's material is titanium, with the remaining 10% of the alloy made up of aluminum. This is done to improve scratch resistance and durability of the card.\nDoes Apple Card offer cash back or rewards?\nYes, you will receive 3% cash back via Daily Cash at partnered retailers and Apple, 2% cash back for purchases made with Apple Pay, and 1% cash back for purchases made with the physical card. Daily Cash deposits are made after a purchase clears.\nUsers will recieve a notification every Sunday that tells them what their weekly spending, as well as their Daily Cash total is.\nApple Card Controversy\nAs with any Apple product, the Apple Card ran into some issues and controversy after launch.\nDenied Applications\nEarly reports stated that the card might be available to those with sub-optimal credit scores. Users with credit scores below 600 are likely to be declined. Additionally, anyone who has put a credit freeze on their account must lift the credit freeze before applying, or the application will be denied.\nApple has launched a new program specifically for users who are denied their Apple Card application. The four-month program coaches users on how best to increase their chances of being approved for the card. While paying down debt and decreasing income-to-debt ratio seem like common-sense tactics, many people aren't familiar with how companies make creditworthiness decisions.\nThe Apple Card financial health website helps users understand some key factors used during a credit card application.\nDiscrimination accusations\nIn November of 2019, David Hansson, the creator of Ruby on Rails, had posted to Twitter that he'd received 20 times the credit limit of his wife. He alleged that Apple had been indicative that Apple was taking part in gender-biased practices.\nIt should be noted that Goldman Sachs, not Apple, handles all applications and determines a user's APR and credit limit.\nA Goldman Sachs spokesperson responded by stating, \"Our credit decisions are based on a customer's creditworthiness and not on factors like gender, race, age, sexual orientation or any other basis prohibited by law.\"\nThe allegations piqued the interest of Wall Street regulators, who began an investigation to determine whether New York law was violated and if Goldman Sachs' algorithm practiced gender-biased discrimination on applicants of the Apple Card. The investigation found no evidence of discrimination.\niPhone 13 pre-order issues through iUP\nCustomers attempting to pre-order the iPhone 13 through Apple's iPhone Upgrade Program ran into errors when attempting to check out with Apple Card as payment. No official statement was made about the problem, though it appears the system was overloaded thanks to the mass amounts of people trying to buy an iPhone."

      "text": "There's been a quiet battle between banks to be the next Apple Card issuer as Goldman Sachs moves on, but another battle is brewing between networks to take over from Mastercard.\nApple is set to move Apple Card from Goldman Sachs at some point soon, but Apple could switch payment networks in the process. Goldman Sachs previously suggested it wanted to rid itself of Apple Card in 12 to 15 months as of November 2023 \u2014 so the move is past due.\nBefore the card issuer changes, however, Apple may choose to sign a new contract with a different payment network. The current network is Mastercard, but according to a report from The Wall Street Journal, Visa and American Express are fighting for the position.\nVisa has even reportedly offered Apple about $100 million to take over as the payment network. That's a large sum it has reserved for its biggest clients, like Costco.\nAmerican Express is also reportedly attempting to take over as both issuer and network for Apple Card. The Amex CEO has previously seemed uninterested in Apple Card, but throwing in the ability to be the network provider may sweeten the deal.\nApple can't move from Mastercard until that portion of the contract expires sometime in 2026. However, even if Goldman Sachs finds a new issuer, it'll take time to make the shift and may be able to include some negotiation into who the new network provider is.\nNothing official has been said publicly, and there is still no sign of what company will take over from Goldman Sachs or when. It could be several months before it all shakes out, but if Goldman Sachs is so pressed to be free of Apple, expect moves to be made soon."

      "text": "Apple Card and Apple Savings are performing so poorly for Goldman Sachs, one executive has reportedly said that \"we should never have done this f****** thing.\"\nGoldman Sachs invested heavily in its consumer lending projects, most notably on the Apple Card but also in others such as a General Motors credit card. From the start, the company faced problems such as accusations of gender bias in its credit limit calculations \u2014 which it has since been cleared of.\nThere was also just the fact that Goldman Sachs spent $350 for every new Apple Card user. In 2022, Goldman Sachs lost $1.2 billion, chiefly because of the Apple Card.\nAdd in later issues such as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigating allegations of fraud, and the relationship between Apple and Goldman Sachs deteriorated severely.\nGoldman Sachs regrets its Apple deal\nConsequently, Goldman Sachs has been working to get out of all of its consumer-facing deals with other firms. One of its last efforts was the Apple Savings account, which despite doubts it would ever happen, finally launched in April 2023.\nNow according to the Wall Street Journal, the finance company wants out of even that deal and has been negotiating to sell off all of its consumer products.\nReportedly, even as some Goldman Sachs executives were talking up the Apple Savings deal at launch, others were still against it. \"We should never have done this f****** thing,\" one partner is said to have told colleagues.\nGoldman Sachs has had talks with American Express, but AmEx is said to be concerned about issues such as the Apple Card's loss rates.\nApple taking over is not an option\nThe Wall Street Journal says that some Goldman Sachs executives have proposed that Apple itself take on more of the venture. One such possibility would be Apple taking on new card users, while Goldman Sachs maintains current ones.\nHowever, some Goldman Sachs executives have said this option is not being considered. And at neither Goldman Sachs nor Apple has it been discussed at high levels.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, some Goldman Sachs executives entirely blame Apple for problems with Apple Card. One example is that unlike other credit cards, all Apple Card bills go out at the same time, at the beginning of the month.\nThis is reportedly overwhelming customer service staff, and Goldman Sachs has been unable to persuade Apple to change to the normal rolling date.\nGoldman Sachs is due to announce its next earnings on Tuesday, October 17, 2023. It is expected to comment on its plans for the consumer division.\nSeparately, in September 2023, it was revealed that Goldman Sachs and Apple had jointly decided to abandon creating an app for stock-trading investors."

      "text": "JPMorgan Chase may become the new host for Apple Card, with Apple reportedly viewing the bank as the preferred replacement for Goldman Sachs.\nApple Card has had a troubled existence with Apple's original financial partner Goldman Sachs. After years of Goldman Sachs trying to get out of the partnership, it seems there may be light at the end of the tunnel.\nAccording to sources of the Wall Street Journal, the talks between Apple and JPMorgan Chase have intensified earlier in 2025. It has allegedly reached a point that Apple has informed JPMogran that it is the iPhone maker's preferred replacement as credit card partner.\nWhile this seems like good news for Apple Card's continued existence, the deal hasn't actually been signed yet. Talks are ongoing, and while they could result in a new partnership, they can just as easily fall apart.\nJPMorgan isn't Apple's only option either. In January, it was reported that Apple was in talks with Barclays and Synchrony Financial over possible Apple Card partnerships.\nIf it does actually complete, the deal will at least give Goldman Sachs the opportunity to get out of what was an expensive exercise for the bank.\nMassive bank, massive potential\nShifting Apple Card to the biggest bank in the United States can be an attractive proposition for JPMorgan Chase. It already operates credit cards and other facilities, which means it has considerable experience and systems in place to absorb Apple Card.\nEconomies of scale will help with the costs associated with managing Apple Card in a considerable way. Hopefully enough to avoid a repeat of the reported $1.2 billion hit to Goldman Sachs in 2019, which was associated with the Apple Card launch.\nIt can also be a way for JPMorgan to tap into the Apple customer base to provide even more financial services, which can in turn earn Apple more revenue.\nInternational expansion is another good reason for Apple to sign up with JPMorgan Chase.\nFor Apple to launch Apple Card in other territories, it has to work with partners that already operate in the region. In the case of JPMorgan Chase, it has been operating in the United Kingdom since 2021 as a retail bank, and as a credit card in 2024.\nThough not necessarily as fruitful as a tie-up with a major multi-national financial operator like Barclays, it would at least give Apple the opportunity to bring Apple Card across the Atlantic."

      "text": "After months of waiting, Apple Card has been launched and is potentially available to all iPhone users in the US. If it's right for you, Apple Card is going to change everything.\nSince Apple Card was announced back on March 25, 2019, we have steadily learned more and more about it, but now it's here, you can apply for it yourself.\nThere are conditions, but after a brief small rollout, it's now open to applications from everyone in the US. And there are strong reasons to want one.\nApplying\nYou'll have to have an iPhone. That's because applying is going to be done through the Wallet app. There are other requirements, to do with your finances.\nWhether you get an Apple Card or not depends on your personal, financial situation, but the process of applying for it is swift.\nThen Apple is not going to reveal its algorithm for determining who does or does not qualify, but it's unlikely to be any different to other credit cards. In which case, you may already know whether you can expect to qualify.\nIf you do get it, though, you get it just about immediately. If you apply right now, when the Card has just been launched, you're likely to find it slow as everyone else applies too, but that should only affect how many minutes it takes for you to get a decision. The actual steps you go through will be fast.\nFrom the moment your application is approved, you are the owner of an Apple Card \u2014 just not yet an actual card. Wherever you pay online, you'll be able to use your Apple Card right away.\nIf you elect to get a physical card, which you really should, then that already famous titanium credit card will arrive in the post after a few days. It'll look like every other credit card, and unlike any other, too. While the shape is the same and it'll have your name on it just like usual, it won't have any numbers on it at all.\nThe physical card can be optional because once you qualify for an Apple Card, its details will be in your Wallet and you'll be able to pay at any contactless or NFC terminal too. However, with the physical card, you'll also be able to use Apple Card wherever you can't currently use Apple Pay.\nSecurity\nOne of the strong attractions of the Apple Card is this business of it having no number on it. This card is going to be the most secure credit card around, and that's for many reasons.\nIf someone steals your card, they don't know the number. If they manage to spend something on it, you'll know because your iPhone will tell you.\nAnd you'll also be able to temporarily freeze or permanently delete the card if you need to. There's no keeping a list of bank phone numbers you have to ring, you cancel it right through your iPhone.\nWhen you absolutely have to give someone your actual credit card number, you won't have to give them your actual one. Apple Card will generate a number you can give just to them and just for this transaction.\nHow it works in stores\nIf you've used Apple Pay, you already know how most of this goes. You can use your iPhone or your Apple Watch on the NFC terminal, or you can insert the physical Apple Card into a store's reader.\nApple has rather trained us to know how to do all of this, but what's new is what happens after we've paid.\nFirst, every single transaction is monitored in detail \u2014 for you, not for Apple. While Apple itself won't know what you've bought or where you got it, you will be able to see exact details.\nRather than seeing an unknown name on your statement at the end of the month, you see the name of the store right now on your phone. If you're looking back over a couple of days and can't recognize the name, your iPhone will show you the location on a map.\nAnd you can also split purchases up into categories that you later track to see just what you're spending your money on.\nEvery day, every time you use the Card or any time when you need to know, all possible information is available to you immediately. You can't stop people being financially irresponsible, but you can do a lot and Apple has.\nEvery day\nSpeaking of every day and every purchase, Apple Card will pay you money each time you use it for anything.\nThere are many credit cards reward you, but often it's with points and always the aim is to get you to use the card more. Doubtlessly Apple wants the same result \u2014 it's predicted to earn $1 billion per year from Apple Card \u2014 but here it's coupled to that monitoring.\nWhile you get a certain amount of money each time you use the card, that's part of having you be aware of your spending. Together with the ability to see just what you're spending, and then with how clear Apple is about the interest you'll end up owing, Apple Card presents an appealing package.\nThe rewards cash could be better, there are cards that offer more in certain circumstances. Whatever you buy on Apple Card, you get at least 1% of the purchase price back. That might be quite a rare figure to get, as it's the percentage when you're paying somewhere that does not yet accept Apple Pay and so is using this as a regular credit card.\nIf you buy anything through Apple Pay, via the Apple Card, then you'll get 2% back. And if you do that in an Apple Store or via any Apple-owned online store like iTunes, you get 3%.\nEvery day, you'll get the cashback from 24-hours of shopping delivered into your account. By default that's a separate Daily Cash account in your Wallet, but you can have it be paid into your actual Apple Card account.\nSo you can have this daily cash go toward paying off your credit card.\nPaying off\nThe majority of credit cards present you with a bill at the end of the month, and while you can go online in the meantime, you tend not to. With Apple Card, the latest details are right there, on your iPhone, available to you immediately.\nWhat's more, that detail includes how much interest you are probably going to have to pay at the end of the month.\nWhile Apple doesn't charge an annual fee, and it doesn't charge you with late fees, it still works on a monthly cycle. And so you will owe the company money every month \u2014 in theory.\nIn practice, you can pay off your card at any time, and if you do that regularly, you will be able to avoid high interest charges. The interest rate you pay is dependent on your financial situation when you apply, but in all cases the Wallet app will show you what you're going to owe.\nIt can only be an estimate, though. What it is really saying is that right now, if you spent nothing else and paid off nothing, at the end of the month, this is what you would owe.\nLost\nYou need to be responsible, though Apple Card is helping you more than most credit cards. If you are diligent about paying off the card, however, this is a really attractive offer.\nAs well as the business of it just being seamless to use, as well as it giving daily cash and letting us avoid high interest payments, it's also cutting out the banks as much as possible.\nApple is partnered with Goldman Sachs, but that firm is not going to stop your card on a whim.\nWe've had cases, for instance, where a bank has decided to refuse an Apple Pay transaction because we had used Apple Pay too often. We can't tell you how many is too many, because that bank does not publish the information and it refuses to tell us.\nYou know that won't happen with Apple. So alongside all the tangible benefits and features, now that Apple Card is here, it is surely going to disrupt old-style, consumer-unfriendly banking forever.\nKeep up with AppleInsider by downloading the AppleInsider app for iOS, and follow us on YouTube, Twitter @appleinsider and Facebook for live, late-breaking coverage.

While Goldman Sachs has faced significant challenges and losses associated with the Apple Card, JPMorgan is anticipated to maintain the card's popular features, with changes likely being gradual and minimal for users. The shift comes as Goldman Sachs seeks to exit consumer lending, having previously expressed regret over its partnership with Apple.",
