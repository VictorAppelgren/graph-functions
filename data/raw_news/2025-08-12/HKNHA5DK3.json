  "description": "Another notorious inmate at the Texas prison has drawn intense attention.",
  "content": "But the arrival of notorious Jeffrey Epstein accomplice and convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell to FPC Bryan earlier this month has turned curiosity into unease. News organizations have descended on the neighborhood, hoping for a glimpse of Maxwell. Armed guards check cars, dark cars patrol the area, and security cameras are now affixed to utility poles around the area. The changes are unnerving residents of Bryan, which advertises itself as \"The Good Life, Texas Style.\"\n\nA shooting outside FPC Bryan last week appears to have only exacerbated tensions. Shots were fired near the jail, and local police and Bureau of Prisons officials said that no guards or staff members were injured. But the New York Post and others seized on a saucy story about \"gangbangers\" opening fire near Maxwell's \"cushy new federal lockup in Texas.\"\n\nThe new attention on the city has unnerved some residents who spoke to NBC News. Marina Boland, who lives across Highway 6 from FPC Bryan, told the outlet that she worried conspiracy theorists and gawkers would visit Bryan to catch sight of Maxwell. And she worried that her arrival could detract from the Bryan-College Station area's other attractions, such as nearby Texas A&M University.\n\nChron asked the City of Bryan if any officials would be willing to comment on the attention Maxwell has brought to the city, or if any residents had expressed concerns to city officials. But because the federal government operates FPC Bryan, Lacey Lively, a spokeswoman for the City of Bryan, said only that \"the city and its elected officials are not in a position to comment on the facility, its inmates, or transfer decisions.\"\n\nIt is an understatement to say that Maxwell's move to FPC Bryan has been controversial. FPC Bryan is considered a desirable prison assignment for inmates and has developed a reputation as a comfortable spot that's home to mostly white collar criminals and non-violent offenders serving out the final years of their sentences. But Maxwell, a British socialite and the daughter of media mogul Robert Maxwell, is currently in the early stretches of a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking girls for Jeffrey Epstein. She is eligible for release in 2037.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons' own policy requires that sex offenders like Maxwell be housed in low-security prisons. Maxwell was previously housed at one, FCI Tallahassee, before her transfer to FPC Bryan. The BOP has given no reason for the transfer, though Bryan residents have their ideas.\n\nInmates at FPC Bryan enjoy a high degree of freedom at the camp. They live in dormitory-style housing that is not locked at night, and they participate in all sorts of educational and recreational programs during their stay. Chain link and decorative wrought iron fencing surround parts of the compound, but is FPC Bryan is so low security that inmates have simply walked off the premises in the past. Inmates have been known to wave at neighborhood residents.\n\nThat has changed, however. Last week, residents told NBC News that a large mesh privacy screen had been put up along the fence, blocking any views of the prison yard. More mesh screening has been installed around the running path inmates use, presumably to keep out paparazzi.",

      "text": "The federal prison camp in central Texas that Ghislaine Maxwell was transferred to last week has increased security measures in response to her arrival, according to a senior law enforcement official.\nAttributing the enhanced security to Maxwell\u2019s presence, the official could not say whether there have been any direct threats to her, other inmates or Federal Prison Camp Bryan itself.\nMembers of the federal Bureau of Prisons\u2019 Special Operations Response Team have been positioned outside the front entrance to FPC Bryan since the weekend to check IDs and wave people through, two current employees told NBC News.\nThey said it\u2019s an unfamiliar sight at the all-women, minimum-security camp where staff members and visitors can generally enter the grounds without going through rigorous security protocol. The camp, which houses about 635 prisoners in a residential neighborhood, has wrought-iron fencing out front, as well as chain-link fencing with razor wire around the perimeter.\nThe security measures are \u201cnot like ones at the penitentiary or medium [security],\u201d an employee, who asked not to be named for fear of job reprisal, told NBC News last week.\nMembers of the special operations team are highly trained to respond to disturbances and security breaches at federal prisons and are deputized by the U.S. Marshals Service. They were deployed to anti-police brutality protests during the first Trump administration and, most recently, helped in the response to the deadly July 4 flooding in Texas Hill Country.\nA BOP spokesperson said the agency does not \"discuss specific security procedures\" when asked about the increased security at FPC Bryan and whether it is connected to Maxwell, who was transferred from a low-security facility in Tallahassee, Florida, to FPC Bryan overnight Friday.\nMaxwell\u2019s attorney, David Oscar Markus, didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Markus has also not responded to previous questions about Maxwell\u2019s safety and details surrounding her transfer.\nMaxwell, 63, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in recruiting and trafficking minors for sex as a co-conspirator and confidant to wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein. In 2019, Epstein killed himself in a New York City jail cell as he was facing charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy.\nBut his case has come under renewed scrutiny in recent weeks after the Trump administration decided not to release all federal files related to Epstein, prompting outcry from parts of Trump\u2019s base who have fueled conspiracies and pushed unfounded narratives surrounding Epstein\u2019s death.\nMaxwell, too, returned to the spotlight when it was revealed that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with her last month for nine hours over two days in a federal courthouse in Tallahassee.\nA source familiar with the matter told NBC News on Tuesday that the Trump administration is considering releasing a transcript from the interview.\nBut it remains unclear why Maxwell, just days after the meeting with the Justice Department\u2019s second-in-command, was transferred to FPC Bryan, where, employees say, inmates are granted more freedoms in dormitory-style housing in which their rooms aren\u2019t locked and they can roam outdoor and recreational spaces.\nTrump told reporters Tuesday that he was unaware that Maxwell had been moved to the Texas camp until after it occurred and that transfers like Maxwell\u2019s were common.\nBut the BOP\u2019s own policy indicates Maxwell should be ineligible to be housed at a minimum-security prison camp because she is a convicted sex offender.\nA sex offender must be in at least a low-level security prison like the one Maxwell was housed in previously, unless a waiver is granted by the administrator of the BOP\u2019s Designation and Sentence Computation Center.\nMaxwell\u2019s presence at FPC Bryan has stoked outrage among some current and former BOP employees who question why she would be placed there given her sex offense charges and the level of security she would require. The majority of inmates at the camp are serving time for nonviolent offenses and white-collar crimes.\nThe family of Epstein abuse survivor Virginia Giuffre, joined by Epstein and Maxwell accusers Annie and Maria Farmer, have also criticized Maxwell\u2019s move. They said in a statement that \u201cshe should never be shown any leniency\u201d as a convicted sex offender.\nCharles Lockett, a former federal prison warden who spent 31 years with the BOP, said he would have never approved the transfer of such a high-profile inmate to a place like FPC Bryan.\nLockett said he\u2019d be especially concerned about the safety risks posed to Maxwell, as well as those who work there.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have the manpower there to deal with such people, and they don\u2019t have the hardened structure,\u201d said Lockett, who oversaw the Florida prison where Boston gangster James \u201cWhitey\u201d Bulger was held before his doomed transfer to a facility in West Virginia. \u201cI just find it unbelievable.\u201d"

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nGhislaine Maxwell has been quietly moved to a Texas minimum-security prison.\nMaxwell had been serving a 20-year sentence in a Florida prison after being convicted of helping sex offender ex Jeffrey Epstein recruit and abuse young girls. Now she has been relocated to the Federal Prison Camp Bryan in Bryan, Texas, a Bureau of Prisons spokesperson told Newsweek.\nNewsweek has reached out to Maxwell's attorney David Oscar Markus via email for comment.\nWhy It Matters\nThe prisoner transfer comes as Maxwell is set to testify before Congress on August 11, about Epstein's network.\nHer lawyer had previously sent a list of terms and conditions to her testimony, which included formal immunity and a guarantee that the interview not take place at the Florida prison where she was previously being held. If her terms could not be met, Markus warned she would have \"no choice but to invoke her Fifth Amendment rights.\"\nThe House Oversight Committee rejected Maxwell's demand for immunity, but a spokesperson said Wednesday they would respond to her other requests shortly.\nIt's not clear if the prison transfer is in response to Maxwell's request.\nWhat To Know\nMaxwell's transfer was managed directly by Bureau of Prisons officials, a source told the The New York Sun. Typically, prisoner transfers are handled by the U.S. Marshals Service. Maxwell also had a brief stopover at FCI Oakdale in Louisiana on her way to Texas, the Sun reports. Newsweek has not been able to independently verify the source.\nThe move comes just a week after Maxwell sat down for a two-day interview with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.\nBlanche has not yet commented on the contents of their discussion, but Maxwell's attorney Markus said Friday there have been \"no asks and no promises\" about clemency.\nMaxwell's Department of Justice conversations and looming Congressional testimony are taking place as pressure continues to build on Donald Trump and his administration, who made the release of the Epstein files a campaign promise.\nThe president has faced strong backlash, including from his own MAGA base, since July 6, when the DOJ and FBI released a joint memo that said the sex offender had \"no incriminating 'client list'\" and reiterated that he died by suicide in his jail cell in August 2019.\nTrump has come under additional scrutiny since The Wall Street Journal reported that in May, Attorney General Pam Bondi told the president his name appeared \"multiple times\" in the so-called Epstein files. This claim was dismissed as \"another fake news story\" by White House communications director Steven Cheung.\nWhere is Ghislaine Maxwell located now?\nAs of August 2025, Maxwell is at Federal Prison Camp Bryan in Bryan, Texas.\nWhat we know about Federal Prison Camp Bryan\nFederal Prison Camp Bryan is a federal minimum-security facility in Bryan, Texas, housing nonviolent female offenders. The institution's focus on rehabilitation offers a considerably less restrictive environment compared to traditional prisons. Certain inmates are allowed participation in off-site work programs and benefit from greater autonomy, though they remain under strict supervision.\nDid Ghislaine Maxwell get pardoned?\nTrump has not granted Ghislaine Maxwell a pardon, but he has publicly addressed the possibility, stating he is \"allowed\" to grant one. He did not say whether a pardon could be a possibility in the future.\nMaxwell and her attorneys have indicated they hope for clemency, but no formal petition or action has been taken.\nWho is Ghislaine Maxwell's father?\nMaxwell's father was Robert Maxwell, a British media proprietor and former member of Parliament. He died under disputed circumstances in 1991, and a subsequent financial scandal revealed substantial debts within his publishing empire.\nWho was Virginia Giuffre?\nVirginia Giuffre is one of the earliest and most prominent accusers of Epstein, alleging she was trafficked and abused as a minor by Epstein with Maxwell's assistance. She died by suicide earlier this year.\nGiuffre's family has criticized the possibility of leniency for Maxwell, with her sister-in-law, Lanette Wilson, telling CNN she could not see any reason to speak to her.\n\"She has perjured herself in the past,\" Wilson said. \"We're talking about a sex trafficker, a monster that could do unspeakable things to young women without conscience. So what would she do to get herself out of the situation that she's in?\"\nWhat People Are Saying\nBureau of prisons spokesperson told Newsweek: \"We can confirm, Ghislaine Maxwell is in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) at the Federal Prison Camp (FPC) Bryan in Bryan, Texas.\"\nMaxwell's attorney, David Oscar Markus, said Friday, \"We can confirm that she is being moved but have no further comment at this time.\"\nTrump said on Monday, when asked about a pardon for Maxwell, \"Well, I'm allowed to give her a pardon but nobody's approached me with it, nobody's asked me about it. It's in the news about that\u2014that aspect of it, but right now it would be inappropriate to talk about it.\"\nDeputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said on X, ahead if his two-day interview with Maxwell last week, \"If Ghislaine Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say.\"\nGiuffre's family said in a statement on Thursday, \"The government and the president should never consider giving Ghislaine Maxwell any leniency.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nMaxwell is scheduled to testify before Congress on August 11.\nNo formal commutations, deals or pardons have been announced for Maxwell, who has a pending appeal to the Supreme Court. Her projected release date remains July 17, 2037.\nAbout the writer\nHannah Parry is a Newsweek Live Blog Editor based in New York. Her focus is reporting on U.S. politics and ... Read more"

      "text": "BRYAN, Texas \u2014 Daisy Perez has lived across the street from the all-women\u2019s prison in her residential community for nine years, forming a careful, if not curious, co-existence with her fenced-in neighbors clad in matching khakis and boots.\nThe prisoners at Federal Prison Camp Bryan wave to Perez, 42, and her 78-year-old mother while they\u2019re looping around the recreation yard. They wave as they pick up litter along the roadside. On Sundays, Perez sees them with visitors outside, the scene reminiscent to her of families enjoying a carefree day at the park.\nThe prison is set in a neighborhood of bungalows and craftsman-style homes with well-kept yards and gardens. Mockingbirds, wrens and sparrows flit in and out of crape myrtle trees lining part of the property\u2019s outside perimeter.\n\u201cSometimes my girls say, \u2018Man, they got the good music in there,\u2019\u201d Perez said. \u201cYou can hear it. It\u2019s loud. \u2026 They jam.\u201d\nBut the casual atmosphere shifted last week when Perez and her neighbors noticed heightened security \u2014 armed guards checking cars, patrol vehicles circling the perimeter and surveillance cameras affixed to utility poles \u2014 stationed around FPC Bryan. When she turned on the news, it clicked: Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s co-conspirator and confidant, who was convicted of sex trafficking charges involving underage girls, was Bryan\u2019s newest inmate.\n\u201cI say that\u2019s crazy,\u201d Perez said. \u201cIt\u2019s creepy because a lot of people try to catch her.\u201d\nThe 91,500 residents of Bryan, a small city about 100 miles northwest of Houston, are used to high-profile inmates calling the low-key prison camp home, often drawing media attention and paparazzi staking out the premises. But the arrival of Maxwell, whose association with Epstein and the baseless conspiracy theories surrounding his suicide in a New York City jail in 2019, has spurred a whole new level of concern for some residents.\nMarina Boland, 29, who lives across a highway from the prison, said, \u201cIt\u2019s scary to think\u201d that someone would be motivated to come to Bryan in connection with the controversies linked to Epstein, the wealthy financier who had cultivated friendships and relationships with powerful people, from business leaders to presidents.\nBoland, who was recently wheeling her two young children in a wagon cart out of Bryan\u2019s downtown library, said Maxwell\u2019s arrival has made locals hypervigilant about who it draws to their town, and in turn, who they speak with \u2014 as unfounded internet conspiracies can have real-world consequences.\n\u201cPeople could be out here to cause harm,\u201d Boland said.\nEpstein was facing charges of sex trafficking and conspiracy when he killed himself. Maxwell, a socialite and daughter of a British media mogul, was convicted on federal charges in 2021 for her role in helping Epstein recruit and sexually abuse young girls.\nIn recent weeks, the release of files related to Epstein has become a politically charged debate after the Trump administration said it would not put out all of the documents detailing the federal government\u2019s investigation into him. Maxwell herself returned to the spotlight after it was revealed that Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met with her last month for nine hours over two days in a federal courthouse in Tallahassee, Florida.\nDetails of their discussion have not been made public, but in the days after the meeting Maxwell was transferred from her low-security prison in Florida to minimum-security Bryan. That stoked outrage among some current and former federal Bureau of Prisons employees who question why she would be placed there given her sex offense charges and the higher level of security she requires.\nBoland said Maxwell\u2019s presence is detracting from her town, which beckons visitors with the sign, \u201cWelcome to Aggieland,\u201d a reference to Texas A&M University located in neighboring College Station.\n\u201cBryan is a beautiful place and it\u2019s kind of upsetting it\u2019s known for the prison,\u201d said Boland, who originally moved here from Chicago.\nShe said she is disgusted by Maxwell\u2019s crimes and noted they have placed her in a facility that typically houses nonviolent and white-collar criminals.\n\u201cI don\u2019t consider what she did a nonviolent offense,\u201d Boland said.\nOther residents questioned why Maxwell \u2014 who isn\u2019t slated for release until July 2037, when she would be 75 \u2014 would get moved to a prison camp where security has traditionally been lax.\nThe BOP\u2019s policy indicates she should be ineligible to be housed at a minimum-security prison camp because she is a convicted sex offender.\nA sex offender must be in at least a low-level security prison, unless a waiver is granted by the administrator of the BOP\u2019s Designation and Sentence Computation Center. The BOP declined to comment on Maxwell and the security procedures put in place at FPC Bryan.\nMaxwell\u2019s transfer \u201cmakes me mad,\u201d said Robert, 43, who declined to give his last name but said he owns a home renovation business. Standing attentively by his son while the boy played at a park near FPC Bryan, he said Maxwell\u2019s relocation gives the appearance that people who come from power and influence are being treated differently.\n\u201cThe punishment does not match her crimes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was anyone else, definitely that person would get worse punishment.\u201d\nAnother parkgoer, Ashley Doss, 41, wondered if politics or something else was behind Maxwell\u2019s move.\n\u201cIt seems like these people that are high profile do get put here, though,\u201d said Doss, while she sat with one of her sons on a bench.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always surprising to me that our little town is on the map because of our women\u2019s prison here,\u201d she added.\nThe prison grabbed headlines two years ago when Elizabeth Holmes, the disgraced founder of the blood-testing lab Theranos, arrived to serve her sentence for wire fraud. It was the same year that \u201cReal Housewives of Salt Lake City\u201d star Jen Shah began her sentence for running a telemarketing scheme that targeted elderly victims. In 2020, Hot Pockets heiress Michelle Janavs served a five-month sentence at FPC Bryan for her role in a sweeping college admissions scandal.\nUnlike a traditional federal prison, inmates at Bryan are provided more freedoms: They live in dormitory-style housing with no locked doors. They can mingle in sitting areas between housing units. And they have access to the recreation yard and a hobby and crafts area.\nThe chain-link fencing topped with a strand of coiled barbed wire and a section of decorative iron bar fencing surrounds the 37-acre compound, but it\u2019s not unheard of for inmates to occasionally walk off the premises before being forced back.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a facility where you see guard dogs walking around and a whole bunch of concertina wire,\u201d said Bryan Councilman Ray Arrington, whose district includes the prison. \u201cIt\u2019s not like that. It looks like a school.\u201d\nOn Thursday night, neighbors noticed a new feature at the prison: a mesh privacy screen was put up along a portion of the fencing, blocking their views. Then on Friday, additional privacy screening was affixed to the fence around the campus, blocking public views of the running path used.\nArrington said he has not personally heard from constituents about Maxwell\u2019s arrival, but he believes local law enforcement and prison security would be able to handle any related threats.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have any fears,\u201d Arrington said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have any issues in the past week.\u201d\nResidents around FPC Bryan say the change in security is a diversion from the norm.\n\u201cThey are patrolling for her, not for us,\u201d Marc Ybarra, 22, said from his home across the street from the prison, referring to Maxwell.\nYbarra said it makes sense she would end up in Texas, and in a semi-remote area such as Bryan, to keep her and the controversy surrounding her \u201chush-hush.\u201d\n\u201cIt makes for whatever agenda they had, whatever they are trying to push,\u201d added Ybarra\u2019s partner, Mya Lopez, 21. She waved to an inmate who was walking the prison\u2019s jogging path.\nOn a recent afternoon, Bryan native Angel Castaneda worked with a crew on a driveway and sidewalk of a home across from the prison camp, as armed guards with bulletproof vests and other equipment patrolled around the property.\n\u201cThey\u2019re 24/7 now,\u201d Castaneda said.\nCars used to be able to drive up to the prison\u2019s entrance and use a scanner to get past a barrier arm, he said, but now, drivers are met by guards.\n\u201cMost people have always felt this was safe. It has never really been a problem,\u201d Castaneda said of the prison camp. \u201cThey\u2019ve always had everything under control.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019ll hear of a woman escaping every two, three, five years. It\u2019s random,\u201d he said, adding that they usually don\u2019t make it far.\nMaxwell\u2019s arrival at the prison does have him concerned, he said, but more so given her status as a sex offender than any conspiratorial association.\n\u201cIf they have them in custody,\u201d Castaneda said, \u201cit\u2019s probably better that way.\u201d\nSuzanne Gamboa reported from Bryan and Erik Ortiz from New York."
