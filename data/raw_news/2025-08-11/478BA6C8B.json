  "description": "The tax exclusion for employer-provided student loan assistance that was introduced in the CARES Act is now permanent, which may help borrowers repay their debt.",
  "content": "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) made headlines for narrowing students' abilities to repay student loans, but the bill may have another significant effect on students. Through the CARES Act, employers could contribute towards employees' loans tax-free. This was a temporary measure, but the OBBBA has made the tax exclusion permanent. The annual $5,250 cap on tax-free contributions will be adjusted for inflation starting in 2026. We'll look into how these changes could affect students and their increased debt burden as student loan payments resume.\n\nWill the OBBBA Help or Hurt Borrowers? What It Could Mean for You\n\nWhen employees receive employer contributions toward debt repayment, these contributions are tax-free, meaning they won't face a tax bill at the end of the year for the assistance they receive. Instead, employees can direct more of their income toward debt repayment, which could help them stay on top of their loans and pay them off faster.\n\nThe OBBBA has dramatically changed student loan financing and repayment. Existing students won't have access to income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, and, although the SAVE plan is still tied up in the courts, interest has resumed, so borrowers will see their balances increase. Future students will have less access to federal aid to pay for school, which can make higher education more costly.\n\n\n\nIn a competitive job market, employers often advertise benefits like paid time off, health care coverage, retirement packages, and more. As more young people graduate with increasingly high student loan debt, a company can stand out by offering student loan payment assistance. Plus, companies can structure the assistance to play out over a few years, which can help employers retain their employees.\n\n\n\nIn the past decade, employers have been hesitant to adopt education assistance programs without being sure the tax exclusion would continue. Since employers didn't want to offer assistance and then remove it, many haven't offered it at all.\n\nHowever, with the permanent tax exclusion, employers may be more likely to adopt and offer student loan repayment programs going forward.\n\n\n\nMaking the tax exclusion for employer-provided student loan repayment assistance permanent could encourage more employers to help their employees pay for school. While this is a step in the right direction, it does little to help employees of companies that do not or cannot provide student loan repayment assistance.",

      "text": "KEY TAKEAWAYS\n- The 'Big, Beautiful Bill' was recently signed into law, and will replace the older student loan repayment system with one that is simpler but potentially more expensive for some borrowers.\n- The bill includes a revised standard plan for borrowers who take out loans after July 1, 2026. The new standard plan will be less expensive monthly for some borrowers.\n- It also eliminates all older income-driven repayment plans and replaces them with the newly created Repayment Assistance Plan for future borrowers. This plan has cheaper monthly payments for the average single borrower, but can be more expensive for borrowers with families.\nA new student loan repayment system that is simpler, but potentially more expensive, is set to roll out next summer.\nThe 'One Big, Beautiful Bill' that President Donald Trump signed into law on July 4 will change the rules for all borrowers who take out federal student loans after July 1, 2026. The law will eliminate all older income-driven repayment plans and revise the standard repayment plan option.\nNew borrowers will be automatically assigned to the revised standard plan, or they can move to the newly created income-driven Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP).\nPreviously, all borrowers were placed in a standard repayment plan that gave them 10 years to pay off their loans. If borrowers wanted lower monthly payments, they could enroll in one of three income-driven plans: Income-Based Repayment (IBR), Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR), and Pay As You Earn (PAYE). Those plans will not be available to future borrowers.\nThe Revised Standard Plan Lowers Monthly Payments\nFor new borrowers who hold more than $25,000 in student loans, the revised standard plan's monthly payments may be smaller than what they would have paid under the older standard plan.\nThe older standard plan gave borrowers 10 years to pay off their loans, regardless of how much they borrowed. However, if borrowers wanted cheaper payments, they could have enrolled in an extended standard plan, a graduated repayment plan, or consolidated their loans.\nIn the revised standard plan, the repayment period varies depending on the loan size. Some borrowers might get 15 to 25 years to pay off their loans. That lowers the monthly payments, but it also requires these borrowers to pay more in interest over time.\n| How The Revised Standard Plan Works | |\n|---|---|\n| Total Outstanding Balance Amount | Repayment Period |\n| Less Than $25,000 | 10 years |\n| $25,000 to $49,999 | 15 years |\n| $50,000 to $99,999 | 20 years |\n| $100,000 or more | 25 years |\nThe New Income-Driven Plan Is Cheaper For Some Borrowers\nIf future borrowers can't afford the standard plan payments, they can opt for the new income-driven plan, RAP.\nRAP uses a different calculation method than older income repayment plans. Monthly payments are based on a percentage of the borrowers' adjusted gross income (AGI), as opposed to older income-driven plans, which use discretionary income to calculate payments.\nThis new calculation method means the \"average recently graduated\" single borrower will pay less under RAP than they would have under the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) Plan, which won't be available for future borrowers.\nFuture borrowers can subtract $50 a month from their payments for every dependent child they have. Despite this, in many cases, borrowers with a family will pay almost $50 more each month than if they were in IBR.\nThe RAP plan also requires all borrowers to pay at least $10 a month, whereas some borrowers can have payments as low as $0 a month on existing income-driven plans.\n| How The New RAP Plan Works | |\n|---|---|\n| Borrowers' Adjusted Gross Income | Monthly Payment Amount |\n| Less Than $10,000 | $10 a month |\n| $10,000 to $19,999 | 1% of monthly AGI |\n| $20,000 to $29,999 | 2% of monthly AGI |\n| $30,000 to $39,999 | 3% of monthly AGI |\n| $40,000 to $49,999 | 4% of monthly AGI |\n| $50,000 to $59,999 | 5% of monthly AGI |\n| $60,000 to $69,999 | 6% of monthly AGI |\n| $70,000 to $79,999 | 7% of monthly AGI |\n| $80,000 to $89,999 | 8% of monthly AGI |\n| $90,000 to $99,999 | 9% of monthly AGI |\n| More than $10,000 | 10% of monthly AGI |"

      "text": "Key Takeaways\n- Readers wanted to know what exactly the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" is, what's in it, and what the next steps are toward it becoming law.\n- The bill is a \"reconciliation\" bill, which sets the budget for the year ahead, raises the debt ceiling, and cannot be blocked by a filibuster in the Senate.\n- The bill has several steps to go before being enacted into law: it must pass the full House of Representatives, the Senate must create its own version, and the two chambers of Congress must hammer out any differences.\nThe proposed budget bill, dubbed the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" by its Republican authors, is advancing through Congress.\nLawmakers are debating the bill, which narrowly passed the House of Representatives this week. It now heads to the Senate, where it faces potentially stiffer opposition.\nThe bill could affect your taxes, government benefits, and federal services. Here's what you need to know about the bill and the process to get it approved.\nWhat Exactly Is The 'One Big Beautiful Bill?' Is It Really Just One Bill?\nIn congressional jargon, the budget proposal is a \"reconciliation\" bill.\nGenerally, a reconciliation bill requires that each committee write a bill outlining how the parts of government that fall under their purview will spend, save, or raise money. Then, the Budget Committee consolidates all the individual plans into one big bill.\nLooking for more details?\nTo zoom in on some of the individual committee or program budget changes, read more from Investopedia.\nThis year, the bill combines government spending and taxation measures for the year ahead with an increase in the debt ceiling.\nLike any legislation, it must be passed by a majority vote in the Senate and the House of Representatives and signed by the president to become a law.\nWhat's In The Bill?\nThe bill sets the federal budget for the next fiscal year and is poised to make many changes to the tax code, many of which were President Donald Trump's campaign promises.\nThe bill extends many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that were set to expire at the end of the year. It would also add new tax cuts, including eliminating income tax on car loan interest, overtime pay, and tips.\nThe bill cuts funding for Medicaid and the SNAP food aid program, and eliminates the government's free tax filing website. Overall, the changes benefit wealthier taxpayers and make those with the lowest income poorer, the Congressional Budget Office estimated.\nWhy Is It A Republican Budget?\nBecause Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House, the GOP is in the driver's seat, with the Democrats mostly powerless to influence the process.\nReconciliation bills are not subject to the Senate's \"filibuster\" procedure, which allows the minority party to shoot down any legislation that has the support of fewer than 60 of the Senate's 100 members. That's especially important because the Republicans only control 53 Senate seats, so they don't have enough votes alone to overcome a filibuster.\nHowever, the Republicans' narrow majority in both chambers makes passing the legislation tricky, since it would only take a handful of dissenters from the ranks to stop its passage. The bill passed by just one vote in the House. It would only take four Republican Senators joining the Democrats in voting against the bill to prevent it from passing.\nAt least five Republican Senators have reportedly objected to the bill in its current form. Some have called for steeper cuts to Medicaid, while others have objected to the new work requirements on the program. Others still oppose raising the debt limit.\nWhat Happens Next?\nThe Senate will now have a chance to debate and modify the bill.\nAfter the Senate passes its version, any differences between the two iterations will be hammered out, either by exchanging amendments or through a conference committee.\nChanges could be introduced at every step of this process, so the final bill version will likely differ from the latest proposal.\nFinally, the bill will be sent to the president, who can either sign it into law or veto it. Trump has said the budget bill is \"arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will ever be signed in the History of our Country,\" and that Senators should \"send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.\"\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent has pressured lawmakers to pass the bill before July 4.\nUpdate, May 23, 2025: This article has been updated to include information about the bill's progress through Congress.\nCorrection, May 22, 2025: A previous version of this article mislabeled the government's health insurance program for low-income households in one mention. It's Medicaid."
