  "title": "AI Data Centers' Soaring Energy Use: Who Pays Those Costs?",
  "description": "Building the infrastructure for generative AI like Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot could spark local fights for energy.",
  "content": "The increase in the number of AI data centers in the US could drive utility costs higher and has put parts of the grid in the hands of tech companies, The New York Times reported on Aug. 14.\n\nCompanies such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are reshaping their relationships with the energy grid to support AI workloads. Their subsidiaries now generate and sell electricity, both to the tech companies and to the general public. But even with all of this infrastructure, AI may demand more power than the grid can give without compromise.\n\nA potential precedent has emerged in Ohio, where American Electric Power (AEP) in late 2024 proposed creating a new customer class for data center operators. Under the plan, large new data center customers would be required to pay fixed rates for at least 85% of their energy allotment, even if they use less.\n\nAmazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and other tech companies argued the plan lacked flexibility, touted the benefits data centers bring in jobs and other ways, and asserted they should pay less than the utility asked.\n\nIn July, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio sided with AEP.\n\n\u201cI am grateful for the collaboration of all the parties involved in this filing, which ultimately brings clarity and certainty for infrastructure planning,\u201d said Marc Reitter, AEP Ohio president and chief operating officer, in a press release on July 9. \u201cWe are looking forward to ending the moratorium and continuing to support development of more data centers in our service territory.\u201d\n\nTech companies petitioned the commission on Aug. 8 to reconsider, according to the Times.\n\nData centers projected to draw 12% of US electricity by 2026\n\nIn 2023, data centers consumed 4% of the entire country\u2019s electricity \u2014 a figure the Department of Energy projects will triple by 2026, largely due to generative AI.\n\nThis surge raises a critical question: Should tech companies cover the bills for upgrading the grid used by both businesses and consumers? Naturally, representatives of tech companies have signaled reluctance, and whether they contribute could depend on future legislative pressure.\n\nA Virginia agency warned that electricity bills for residents could rise by $276 annually by 2030 due to data center expansion, according to a December 2024 report cited by the Times.\n\nThe conundrum leads to alternate setups, such as tech companies owning their own power plants (utilities are not legally allowed to do). These subsidiaries have come to represent a larger portion of sales on the wholesale electricity market.\n\nSales of electricity from major tech companies into the wholesale electricity market have reached more than $2.7 billion in the past decade, according to Jeremy Singer-Vine of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, as cited by the Times.\n\nAnother complicating factor: Tech companies could build data centers that sit idle for years if they do not find customers.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration encourages an aggressive buildout of AI infrastructure to power the likes of OpenAI\u2019s large language models.\n\nIn early August, Google agreed to reschedule or pause non-urgent AI workloads at its data centers when Indiana Michigan Power and Tennessee Valley Authority grids are strained.",

      "text": "Gahanna, OH, July 9, 2025 \u2013 AEP Ohio today recognized a ruling by the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio that addresses the power needs of Ohio\u2019s growing data center industry while protecting AEP Ohio\u2019s other customers.\nThe ruling approves a request made by AEP Ohio in May 2024 to establish enhanced financial obligations that data centers must undertake to support infrastructure that serves them. The staff of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (PUCO), the Ohio Consumers\u2019 Counsel, the Ohio Energy Group and others had joined AEP Ohio in the filing. The financial requirements are designed to protect other customers from shouldering the costs of grid improvements required to meet data centers\u2019 energy demands.\n\u201cWe are glad the PUCO agrees that it is critical to align data centers\u2019 demand for energy with the infrastructure costs needed to support their growth in Ohio,\u201d said Marc Reitter, AEP Ohio president and chief operating officer. \u201cThis infrastructure will support Ohio\u2019s growing tech sector and help secure America\u2019s data storage and processing facilities here in the U.S.\u201d\nAEP Ohio\u2019s proposal approved today by the PUCO requires large new data center customers to pay for a minimum of 85% of the energy they are subscribed to use \u2013 even if they actually use less \u2013 to cover the costs of infrastructure needed to bring electricity to those facilities. The plan creates a sliding scale that allows small and mid-sized data centers more flexibility. It also requires data center owners to provide proof they are financially viable and able to meet those requirements. The terms also include an exit fee if a project is canceled or unable to meet the obligations over the term of the electric service agreement contract.\nThe requirements would be in place for 12 years, including a 4-year ramp-up period.\nThe agreement also outlines a process to end the moratorium on new Central Ohio data center agreements, which AEP Ohio had instituted to protect the grid and the company\u2019s other customers while the PUCO considered these new rules.\n\u201cI am grateful for the collaboration of all the parties involved in this filing, which ultimately brings clarity and certainty for infrastructure planning,\u201d Reitter said. \u201cWe are looking forward to ending the moratorium and continuing to support development of more data centers in our service territory.\u201d\n###\nAEP Ohio is based in Gahanna, Ohio, and is a unit of American Electric Power. AEP Ohio provides electricity to 1.5 million customers across 61 counties. News and information about AEP Ohio can be found at AEPOhio.com.\nAt American Electric Power (Nasdaq: AEP), based in Columbus, Ohio, we understand that our customers and communities depend on safe, reliable and affordable power. Our nearly 17,000 employees operate and maintain more than 40,000 miles of transmission lines, the nation's largest electric transmission system, and more than 225,000 miles of distribution lines to deliver power to 5.6 million customers in 11 states. AEP also is one of the nation's largest electricity producers with approximately 29,000 megawatts of diverse generating capacity, including nearly 6,000 megawatts of renewable energy. AEP is investing $43 billion over the next five years to make the electric grid cleaner and more reliable. We are on track to reach an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 and have a goal to achieve net zero by 2045. AEP is recognized consistently for its focus on sustainability, community engagement and inclusion. AEP's family of companies includes utilities AEP Ohio, AEP Texas, Appalachian Power (in Virginia and West Virginia), AEP Appalachian Power (in Tennessee), Indiana Michigan Power, Kentucky Power, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, and Southwestern Electric Power Company (in Arkansas, Louisiana, east Texas and the Texas Panhandle).
