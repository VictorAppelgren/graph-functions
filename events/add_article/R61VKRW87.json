The discussions come as the deadline for a satisfactory resolution approaches, with the European nations expressing increasing skepticism over Iran's nuclear activities, particularly after Tehran ceased cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The situation is further complicated by Iran's threats against the IAEA's director-general and the looming expiration of the 'snapback' mechanism that allows for the reinstatement of sanctions.",
