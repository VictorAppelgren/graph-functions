  "content": "San Francisco officials lowered flags at City Hall Thursday in memory of a Marin County couple and their son who were lost in the deadly flash floods that struck Central Texas in July.\n\nKentfield residents Mark Walker, 51, and Sara Walker, 50, were staying at their house in Hunt, Tex. with their son Johnny, 14, when the catastrophic floods washed away their home that stood along the Guadalupe River, according to Mark\u2019s mother Kathy Walker.\n\nTheir daughter Ellie, 16, was attending summer camp at Camp Waldemar seven miles away, where she remained safe through the storm.\n\n\u201cMark, Sara and Johnny Walker were cherished members of the San Francisco Bay Area community, and I was heartbroken to hear that they were among those lost in the devastating Texas flooding,\u201d Mayor Daniel Lurie said in a Thursday statement.\n\n\u201cOur city is grieving with them, and today, we are honoring the Walkers and the impact they had on our community,\u201d Lurie added.\n\nKathy\u2019s younger son, Tyler Walker, was a major league baseball player whose long career spanned five teams, including the San Francisco Giants from 2004 to 2008. Now living in San Rafael, Tyler graduated from San Francisco\u2019s University High School and UC Berkeley before launching his professional baseball career.\n\nTyler traveled to Texas in the immediate aftermath of the flood to search for his missing family members and to support his niece Ellie.\n\nMark and Johnny Walker had planned to fly back to the Bay Area just a few days after the flood, with Johnny set to start football practice at Marin Catholic High School as an incoming freshman.\n\nThe flash floods resulted in a death toll of over 135, including over 35 children. Dozens were missing for several days following the disaster.\n\n\u201cMy family and I are thinking of the Walkers, including their surviving daughter Ellie, as well as their entire community and all those lost in the floods,\u201d Lurie said.",
