  "description": "Drag icon Heidi N Closet shares her top E.l.f. products and stars in a new campaign with Matt Rife, defending your wallet from overpriced beauty.",
  "content": "\u2022 Drag superstar Heidi N Closet partners with E.l.f. Cosmetics for a budget-friendly and inclusive makeup campaign.\n\u2022 The campaign, \"The Law Offices of E.l.f.ino & Schmarnes,\" humorously targets overpriced beauty products.\n\u2022 Heidi praises E.l.f. for offering high-quality makeup at affordable prices, highlighting the Incredi-Curl Mascara.\n\nWhen it comes to beauty that\u2019s bold, inclusive and budget-friendly, you can't really beat E.l.f. Cosmetics. And no one knows that better than Heidi N Closet, the fan-favorite drag superstar who recently teamed up with E.l.f. to bring the drama, humor and heart right to your makeup bag (without the splurge).\n\nThe RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race alum's latest role is a beauty injury attorney starring alongside comedian Matt Rife in The Law Offices of E.l.f.ino & Schmarnes, a new campaign inspired by those nostalgic early 2000s legal commercials. Together, they bring their signature playful flair to defend your eyes, lips and most importantly, your funds from overpriced beauty.\n\nFrom their inclusive campaigns to their hilarious marketing, Heidi says she was all-in on E.l.f from the jump. \u201cWhen I tell you it was a no-brainer, gurl case closed,\u201d she told USA TODAY Shopping. \u201cI\u2019ve always believed everyone deserves to look and feel their best without breaking the bank, and E.l.f. is serving premium quality at jaw-dropping prices.\"\n\n\u201cIt flips the script on the idea that expensive means better makeup,\u201d she says of the beauty brand. \u201cPlus, I\u2019m obsessed with the Incredi-Curl Mascara. It\u2019s only $8 and gives you lashes that won\u2019t quit.\u201d\n\nUSA TODAY Shopping caught up with Heidi to talk about the affordable E.l.f Cosmetics products in her shopping cart, her love for cheeky branding and why beauty should be for every eye, lip and face.\n\nWhat's in your cart? Shop E.l.f. Cosmetics with Heidi N Closet\n\nWhether you\u2019re a drag queen, a beauty beginner or just someone who loves a good deal, Heidi\u2019s cart is full of products for $25 or less that prove you don\u2019t need to spend big to feel beautiful.\n\nSkincare tip from Heidi N Closet: \"I would say stop picking at the pimples because that\u2019s just irritating the area and drinking a lot of water is also really good my skin.\"\n\nFans can call 1\u2011855\u2011COLD\u2011HARD\u2011LASH to leave a message about their beauty grievances. Yes, that\u2019s 1\u2011855\u2011265\u20113427 and yes, it\u2019s real.\n\n\ud83d\udcc6 On Wednesday, August 13, E.l.f. and Heidi are bringing The Law Offices of E.l.f.ino & Schmarnes to life with a one-day pop-up event in NYC inside the Oculus.\n\nCan you fight for inclusivity and still have fun with beauty?\n\nHeidi says: \u201cAbsolutely\u2014we have to do both! Beauty should be joyful, expressive and above all, inclusive. You can fight the good fight in fabulous heels and a glossy lip, darling!\"\n\nIf you could name an E.l.f. beauty product, what would it be?\n\nHeidi says: \"I would want something branded along the lines of 'Blessed and Highly favored,' which I feel is very on brand with me, and honestly, knowing E.l.f.\u2019s creativity and sense of humor, the marketing for it would be hilarious and so fun.\"\n\nUSA TODAY Shopping covers all the best sales, trends and drops, so be sure tosign up for text alerts,sign up for our newsletter andfollow us on Instagram to stay updated!",
