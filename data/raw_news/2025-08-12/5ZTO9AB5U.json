  "description": "Comprehensive cross-platform coverage of the U.S. market close on Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio, and YouTube with Romaine Bostick, Scarlet Fu, Carol Massar and Tim Stenovec. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "And right now we are 2 minutes away from the end of the trading day. Romaine Bostick here with Vonnie Quinn taking you through to that closing bell with a global simulcast. It started Carol Massar in the radio booth. David Gura in today for Tim Stenovec, a big welcome to our audiences across all of our Bloomberg platforms, including our partnership with YouTube. On a day where we see the S & P up 1% at a record high, the Russell 2000 up 3% on the day. Carol Massar And that's all because CPI rose. Well, you know, the expectation is what now? Yes, indeed. Check, check. We're going to get that rate cut come September. But as our Michael McKee and others remind us, we have a bunch of data before we get to that next Fed meeting. So hold on, everybody. Bunch of data. And of course, the meeting in Jackson Hole is where the party is for the party data. Data side is ready to party, But yeah, a lot of data. We're going to get these policy speeches as well. So a lot to happen here before the Fed meet once again here in September. Just I mean, not to pick on Carol, but why is everybody pooh poohing this report? Because everyone keeps saying, oh, just wait till we get to the next PC thing or wait till we get to something. You really think the tariffs are all baked in yet? We have some major trading partners that we have yet to figure it out. I don't know. But I guess it doesn't matter. I mean, if you're an equity investor, at least, I mean, you know, you enjoy the ride until it's over. If inflation starts to pick up again and the Fed cuts in, then they have to raise rates again. I don't think that's great policy. What do you think when you go on my side or I just I also think it's a little freaky that it was carefully. VARNEY Yeah. Yeah. I'm on both of your sides. And also, that's upside. There's three sides. Oh, there's no side. David has basically yeah. I mean, I think it was a little freaky that it was services inflation that went up so much as well. All right. Let's break down the numbers here because we do have a record day on Wall Street, but more importantly, one that I think defied a lot of expectations. A CPI report that did show inflation is still there and on a year over year basis, still holding a level that it's been. But a lot of now optimism about the idea that at least with it being somewhat benign, the Fed will have the room to begin those rate cuts as soon as it's meeting in September. The S & P 500 ending the day higher by more than 70 points, 6000 for 45 and change up about 1% on the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average making a similar move on a percentage basis. The Nasdaq composite up about 1.4% on the day. A similar move for the Nasdaq 100. But look at the cyclical sectors. S & P mid-caps up 2.3%, Dow transports up 3% on the day. The Russell 2000 also up 3% on the day. Carol Massar may be potentially a vote of confidence that it may be it's safe to embrace some of those cyclical and economic names. You almost sound irrational, exuberant, but I'm going to be very careful here. Well, don't worry, I'll be pessimistic tomorrow. S & P 500 folks are most names are broad based buying as remain just laid out, 401. Names to the upside in the S & P 500. 100 to the downside, vonnie and to unchanged. You heard that incredible roar from the exchanges, right, guys? I mean, it's an incredible performance today. All sectors in the s & p 500 ended in the green. Even consumer staples, which was lagging just that tiny little bit, one tiny sliver of red and that was insurance companies. But even then, they were down literally fractionally. All right, guys, let's get to some of the individual gainers. Got them into an airline names in today's session, up about 9% as a group. Overall, we did get a read on inflation. We saw airline fares, a big contributor to the super core services gain that 4% month. They increased the biggest for this category in more than three years. We also talked a little bit about Spirit Airlines and what's going on with them. And then maybe that provides more business for others as they have their own struggles. So anyway, airlines definitely some outperformance united. In fact, that stock alone was up 10% in today's session. The number one gainer in the S & P Delta was the number two gainer. Want to mention the stocks, the Philly Semiconductor index, that was up about 3% in today's session. Shareholders reacting to CEO Louboutins meeting with President Trump. The president describing the meeting as a very interesting one. He talked about his amazing story, his background, a little bit more positive. So Intel also up about 5.6% in today's session and then asked Space Mobile. We talked about it a little bit on air David and I did with Nura. Melinda, It's a satellite firm. It set out an ambitious plan to launch about 45 to 60 satellites this year and next year. It also said it received two additional early stage contracts from the US government. So that won some outperformance there as well. David up 8%. I'm looking at decliners. Nobody wants to on decliners on a record setting day, so I'll move swiftly through these. But I am looking at a couple of health care services stocks on this Tuesday, a broad umbrella so much underneath there. But McKesson's, the first one I'm going to point out here, headquartered in Irving, Texas, it announced plans to spin off its Medical Surgical solutions business segment into another discrete company. Another health care services company. I'm looking at is Cardinal Health down about 8% today, buying Solaris in a .9 billion deal that on the heels of a miss in adjusted operating income, I think it's down the most since 2021. Last company I'll flag here is Aon that professional services company a lot of action in the options space there but we've seen it down today as well guys and we take a quick check on. Yields. And I think the seeping in of the yield curve really tells the story of where this market's head is, that you did see short term yields drop the two year down about four basis points as now the market seems to price in a much firmer possibility that we will get a rate cut in September, and that includes a 94% chance based on Bloomberg calculations, that we will get a 25 basis point cut at the September meeting and an 81% chance that we'll get a second cut before the end of the year. Basically, what's already been telegraphed on the DOT plot and of course, all of this has to do with the idea, the read through, Carol, that we're getting right now potentially from that CPI report that the impact of tariffs maybe a little bit less severe than what the market had priced, or at least the president wants to make clear that, well, that's what he thinks. And he had some choice words for none other than one of the big bank CEOs. Yes, indeed. We're talking about Goldman Sachs. President Trump saying that the Goldman Sachs team and the CEO, which are about David Solomon, he criticized it, saying the bank was, quote, wrong about the tariffs and their impact on consumer prices. So a research note that was out by Goldman said the impact of those terrorists from the president on consumer prices was just starting to be. And we should point out that research note was not put out by David Solomon. No, put out by John Perverse researcher. I just want to make that clear. So not that he couldn't if he wanted to. I'm sure if David Solomon wanted to, I think he has other things he has to do during the day. You're tough today, but part and parcel, I think, of this theme we're seeing from the president weighing in on all manner of corporate affairs. So, Carol, just a moment ago, talking about Intel, we heard the president calling for the resignation of of that CEO a few days ago. Here he is going after you on how he is not not by name. David Solomon as well, taking a, shall we say, more muscular role here than previous presidents have and kind of advising large American companies on the way they should conduct. Yeah, I mean, he doesn't like not getting credit, does he, David? He literally said David Solomon and Goldman Sachs refuse to give credit where credit is due and you know to the that out well before he said that David should go and get himself a new economist or maybe he ought to just focus on being a DJ and not bother running a major financial institution. He's just the next CEO in the crosshairs, right? I mean, will we be seeing him visit the White House? David Solomon like it was live Bhutan did just the other day. I so the idea though to I mean we talk about a market at record highs at least for the S & P on the NASDAQ and the Russell looks like it's trying to claw its way back towards it. But your point, David, about this, the interjection, if you will, by the president and the White House and to so many things that at least in the past, it would have just been left to its own devices, let corporate America do its thing as long as they're of course, they're not breaking the law or doing anything unethical. But now, with his sort of finger on the scale, whether it's with Intel or the latest comments about Goldman Sachs and David Solomon, does that become a potential market risk, a potential headwind going forward? For sure. Or a question let's just when you regatta earnings really quickly, because, of course, this is the quantum computing company that really had the market's attention there when it did a demonstration just about three or four weeks ago and the stock price shot up and we had a bunch of price targets come out after that. The operating loss wasn't as bad as anticipated, 9.9 million. The estimated operating loss was for $20.9 billion and then second quarter revenue, 1.8 million. The estimate was 1.87 billion. So slightly shy on revenue. But again, a better operating loss than anticipated. That stock has been rising in recent sessions. Can I just let remain I think you're right and I think he's right, like this idea that you always have to be. We'll take it both now. But I think they have to be so careful. Right. It's almost like nobody wants to be caught on the president's social feed. And because you don't know, we do see stocks move on it. We certainly see, you know, we end up doing segments on it because there is concerns about what that might mean in terms of regulatory or oversight. I don't know. But it definitely is tricky for I think, companies and CEOs. Yeah. And we should point out we've been talking to a lot of folks today about the CPI report and they also point to this idea, the resiliency right now of corporate America, the idea that the bottom lines for a lot of these companies are holding up and we continue to get our earnings crossing the wire. We have H & R BLOCK, of course, this is the tax prep company. Those shares actually moving lower in the after hours trade. The company in its fiscal fourth quarter did report a slight beat and revenue of about .11 billion. But on the EBIT basis, basically the bottom line here, the company says that it's looking at about $413 million and that's slightly below what the street was looking for. The company did increase its quarterly dividend and did provide a 20 fiscal 2026 forecasts for revenue of 3.88 billion to 3.9 billion. The Street was looking for a 3.83. Who's next? I don't know. We're waiting for court. We've. It's just Corey was actually crossing. So let me just start with that if I can, guys. Second quarter revenue, we're just getting one number so far, 1.21 billion. The Street estimate is 1.08 billion. And we're seeing core we've already a pop about 2.8% here in the after our second quarter loss of $0.60 a share. The estimate on the street was for a loss of $0.46. So that seems a little bit larger there. And second quarter adjusted EBIT margin remains 62%, slightly better than the street estimate of 61.9, paring some of the gains, but still up about 2.2% here in the aftermarket, something that we've been watching certainly for the results of this company. Also keeping an eye on Lumentum. It kind of makes lasers and optics. They're kind of used in data centers and in the air space. So shares moving higher in the after hours trade after reporting the beat on the bottom line for the most recent quarter, $0.88 a share, the Street was looking for 80. Even net revenue also coming in above estimates at roughly about $481 million. All right, guys. Yep. Thank you so much. That is a really to Carol. And thank you, David. Thank you, man. I appreciate it. Well, actually, I'm always on your side, so watch out of here. I'm out of here.",
