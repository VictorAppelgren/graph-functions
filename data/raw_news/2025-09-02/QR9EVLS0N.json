  "description": "Spanish PM insists \u2018migration is an opportunity\u2019 and is not afraid to discuss what he considers Europe\u2019s recent failures",
  "content": "When Pedro S\u00e1nchez and Keir Starmer meet in Downing Street on Wednesday it will be the first such bilateral summit between a Spanish prime minister and his British counterpart for more than a decade, an interregnum explained by Brexit and the now healed sore of Gibraltar.\n\nThe absence of highest level diplomacy has become more glaring given the two men are the leading social democratic leaders of Europe, facing similar problems of migration, souring populist parties, the climate crisis and divisions over how to minimise the damage caused to the European global influence by Donald Trump\u2019s erratic unilateralism.\n\nBut in a Guardian interview with S\u00e1nchez in the prime minister\u2019s office in Madrid, the contrasts, as much as the similarities, were on display in the political choices being made by the two leaders.\n\nIn many ways, S\u00e1nchez, putting aside the corruption allegations that dog his family and former senior advisers, is the kind of socialist that many ordinary British Labour party members crave as they urge their leadership to move away from a political agenda determined by Reform that they fear Starmer can never win.\n\nSometimes accused of not wielding Spain\u2019s influence on the world stage \u2013 he was not invited to the recent European discussions with Trump \u2013 S\u00e1nchez showed a willingness to frame a values-based foreign policy that could transcend what he described as the transatlantic bond.\n\nOn migration for instance S\u00e1nchez, faced by Vox, the rightwing populist party currently at 15% in the polls, will not apologise for saying migration is a necessary boon to the economy. \u201cI am willing to explain the figures and how migration is helping to boost the economy and to increase our social spending. We have to do it with clear data in order to fight the populist approach,\u201d he said. \u201cIn Spain migration represents 25% of our per capita GDP, 10% of our social security revenues and only 1% of our public expenditure.\u201d\n\nFaced by accelerating population decline, western societies face a \u201cdilemma between opening up and growing or closing off and shrinking\u201d, he argued.\n\nFar from talking about Spanish people \u201cfeeling like strangers in their own land\u201d, he confidently predicts \u201cthe vast majority of Spanish citizens understand quite well that migration is an opportunity and not just a moral duty\u201d.\n\nOne senses S\u00e1nchez regards the migration debate as less about identity and more about living standards and the economy, issues that will not be solved in Spain\u2019s case without continued migration.\n\nS\u00e1nchez has also shown himself willing to air his differences with Trump without, he insists, intentionally weakening the transatlantic relationship. At the recent Nato summit in June, Spain was the only country that refused to sign up to Trump\u2019s demand to reach a target of defence spending at 5% of GDP by 2035.\n\nSpain was a reliable Nato partner, he insisted, adding that in terms of capabilities Spain was meeting Nato commitments but the cost of reaching a target of 5% (Spain is just reaching 2.1 %) was one he has not willing to bear. On one estimate, it would require S\u00e1nchez to increase defence spending by \u20ac80bn (\u00a369bn) a year, a proposal he would never get through his coalition government. He claimed that, as Nato\u2019s southern flank, Spain faced different security threats to northern Europe.\n\nAt the summit, Trump responded to Spain\u2019s refusal by threatening to double tariffs on Spain, saying he would personally oversee this negotiation and adding \u201cthe Spanish economy could be blown right out of the water\u201d. But S\u00e1nchez said US tariffs are set for the whole of the EU and Spain cannot be singled out as a target. No punishment specific to Spain had been issued, he said.\n\nNor did Trump\u2019s lingering threat hold him back from criticising US global leadership in a way that Starmer has been reluctant to articulate explicitly. \u201cThe shocking reality is that what we are witnessing is that the principal architect of the international order, which is the US after the second world war, is now weakening that order and that is not something positive for the US society or Europe,\u201d he said, highlighting US cuts to global aid and defending the role of the World Trade Organization.\n\nS\u00e1nchez has also led the way in Europe in criticising Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza. In June, he directly accusing Israel of causing a genocidal situation, a verdict the UK government will not deliver, arguing only international courts can make such a judgment.\n\nSince spring last year, S\u00e1nchez has argued not only that European states should recognise Palestine as a state, but also that the EU should suspend its trade association agreement \u2013 again, something the UK has also refused to do. He says the divisions within Europe over the past 18 months means the EU efforts on Gaza represent \u201ca failure, absolutely\u201d, arguing that he can only try to persuade more EU states until there is a majority for suspension. What he describes as the \u201cdarkest episodes of international relations in the 21st century\u201d leave him with no other option, but he says he will not cut off diplomatic relations with Israel since that would only lose him any remaining influence.\n\nThe refusal to take concrete steps against Israel has damaged the west\u2019s credibility with the global south, he says, and by displaying double standards weakened the cause of Ukraine.\n\nThe perceived moral void being left by the west will be filled, he predicted. The new partnership between India, China and Russia on display this week in Beijing may mask ideological conflicts, but \u201cin politics, as in life, there is always someone who is going to fill the gap you leave, and that is what we are witnessing when it comes to some east Asian countries\u201d.\n\nBut making an appeal to the global south on the biggest issues societies are facing, such as the climate crisis, was becoming harder owing to fissures in the west. After a summer of forest fires that in his view confirmed climate change was happening faster in Europe than the scientists predicted, he admits \u201cthe problem we are now facing is that there are traditional rightwing parties that perhaps don\u2019t deny scientific reality, but they act and behave as if climate change does not exist\u201d.\n\nThe traditional right, he said, by turning the scientific evidence of climate change into a traditional ideological political struggle \u201care committing their biggest mistake\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo combat climate change, you need resources, you need consistency, you need solidarity and you need a long term perspective, and unfortunately in politics nowadays we lack a bit of all that.\u201d It is a depressing admission that in reality he could apply to all the dilemmas facing social democrats in government.",

      "text": "Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has announced a 10-point plan to prepare the country for the climate emergency, warning: \u201cIf we don\u2019t want to bequeath our children a Spain that\u2019s grey from fire and flames, or a Spain that\u2019s brown from floods, then we need a Spain that\u2019s greener.\u201d\nS\u00e1nchez said August\u2019s heatwave-fuelled wildfires \u2013 which killed four people, burned through an area six times the size of Ibiza and required \u201cthe biggest human and technical deployment\u201d ever seen in Spain \u2013 showed that immediate action must be taken to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis.\nHe said waiting any longer would be dangerous and expensive, and he criticised those who deny the realities of global heating in Spain. Over the past five years, he said, the climate emergency had caused more than 20,000 deaths and cost the public purse \u20ac32bn (\u00a328bn) in material losses.\n\u201cWe need to mobilise as a society against climate change, which is a common enemy that lies beyond ideologies,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change kills. It kills. And that\u2019s why we have to be aware of everything it represents in terms of insecurity and in terms of the risks it poses to our lives.\n\u201cThe climate change denial that\u2019s coming from an important part [of society] \u2013 and which is growing as a result of the lies spread on social networks by some members of our political class \u2013 is as incomprehensible as it is worrying.\u201d\nHe proposed a series of initiatives including a state civil protection agency to coordinate crisis responses, a network of climate refuges across the country and a rethink of forest management and land use. Only by acting now, he said, could the country hope to avert similar disasters or reduce their impacts.\n\u201cThe biggest opportunity we have right now is to avoid this tragedy \u2013 and to do that, we need to do as a US president once advised when he said that the moment to fix your roof is when the sun\u2019s shining and not when it\u2019s raining,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI think he was right because these sixth-generation fires that have burned through more than 300,000 hectares in our country aren\u2019t put out in summer; they\u2019re put out in winter and in autumn. They\u2019re put out by working all year.\u201d\nOther measures in the socialist-led government\u2019s \u201cstate pact to address the climate emergency\u201d include funds to prepare for, and rebuild after, climate-related disasters, improvements to firefighting capacity, a plan to increase water resilience in the face of floods and droughts, and initiatives to fight rural depopulation and thus help keep the land clear of combustible material.\nS\u00e1nchez said farming would also play an important role in fighting the climate crisis, pointing to the benefits of extensive agriculture, careful grazing and efficient irrigation. The final two measures are promoting a \u201ccivic culture of prevention and reaction\u201d and accelerating the green transition.\nThe plan will be approved in cabinet on Tuesday and put out for public consultation."

      "text": "Europe and the west\u2019s double standards over the wars in Ukraine and Gaza threaten to undermine its global standing, the Spanish prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has warned, describing the response to Israel\u2019s assault on the Palestinian territory as one of the darkest episodes of international relations in the 21st century.\nIn an interview with the Guardian before talks with UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, in London on Wednesday, the socialist leader also said the US under Donald Trump was trying to end the post-second world war, rules-based global order it had originally created.\nHe also defended the benefits of migration and blamed traditional rightwing parties for breaking the consensus over the response to the climate emergency by copying the policies of their populist rivals.\nS\u00e1nchez \u2013 the first senior European leader to accuse Israel of genocide in Gaza \u2013 said he was pleased that other European nations were following Spain\u2019s lead in recognising a Palestinian state, but accepted Europe\u2019s response had been poor.\n\u201cIt is a failure,\u201d he said. \u201cAbsolutely. It is also the reality that, within the European Union, there are countries that are divided when it comes to how to influence Israel. But in my opinion, it\u2019s not acceptable and we can\u2019t last longer if we want to increase our credibility when it comes to other crises, such as the one we face in Ukraine.\n\u201cThe roots of these wars are completely different but, at the end of the day, the world is looking at the EU and also at western society and asking: \u2018Why are you doing double standards when it comes to Ukraine and when it comes to Gaza?\u2019\u201d\nSpeaking as he attempts to reassert himself on the international stage and move past a series of damaging corruption allegations that have battered his administration and fuelled calls for a snap general election, S\u00e1nchez said he was pushing Europe to do more, including punishing Israel financially.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re now witnessing in Gaza is perhaps one of the darkest episodes of international relations in the 21st century, and in this regard what I have to say is that Spain has been very vocal within the EU and also within the international community,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin the EU, what we have done so far is advocate to suspend the strategic partnership that the EU has with Israel.\u201d\nSanchez, who has clashed with Donald Trump over Spain\u2019s refusal to meet the US president\u2019s demands to spend 5% of GDP on defence, said Spain was a \u201creliable partner\u201d in Nato. He said he was committed to preserving \u201cthe best relationship with the US\u201d, regardless of who was in the White House \u2013 and despite Trump\u2019s isolationist actions.\n\u201cWith all due respect, we have a pragmatic approach in our relationship with the US,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time, I think we have a different vision on how to face the challenges that the world and our societies are facing. And I think there\u2019s a big mistake with leaving the Paris agreement and reducing contributions to aid programmes and to the World Health Organization. But at the end of the day, our societies are facing global challenges that don\u2019t understand borders, and we need to strengthen our cooperation and collaboration.\u201d\nBut he also said that the US\u2019s withdrawal from global institutions could allow others to play a greater international role.\n\u201cThe most shocking reality that we\u2019re facing is that the principal architect of the international order \u2013 which is the US after the second world war \u2013 is now weakening this international order, and that\u2019s something that\u2019s not going to be positive for US society or for the rest of the world, especially western countries,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why I think there\u2019s an opportunity for the European Union and also for the UK.\u201d\nHe added that while still being loyal to the \u201ctransatlantic bond\u201d, European countries could strengthen their power and influence \u2013 if they acted morally and consistently.\n\u201cWhat does it mean? It means that we need to avoid these double standards. It means that we need to reinforce our commitment when it comes to the green pact. It means that we need to have a humanitarian and moral vision \u2013 and also a pragmatic one \u2013 when it comes to migration.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cIn politics, as in life, when you leave a gap, there\u2019s always someone who\u2019s going to fill it. And I believe that that\u2019s what we\u2019re also witnessing when it comes to some eastern Asian countries.\u201d\nWednesday\u2019s meeting in London will be the first significant bilateral summit between the two countries\u2019 leaders for more than a decade. It was made possible by the UK and Spain striking a deal over Gibraltar\u2019s future, ending the long-running dispute over the territory after Brexit and easing the movement of people and goods across the border.\nWhile Starmer and his Labour government have taken an increasingly hard line on immigration, S\u00e1nchez has been forthright about the benefits it can bring.\n\u201cThe dilemma that western societies are facing is whether we decide to be an opening-up and growing society, or a closing-off and shrinking society,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so far, I believe that the vast majority of citizens in Spain understand quite well that migration is also an opportunity and not only a moral duty. It\u2019s an opportunity to respond effectively to the challenges that we are facing when it comes to economic growth and when it comes to the labour market or helping to finance our welfare state in the present and the future.\u201d\nS\u00e1nchez, who announced a 10-point plan earlier this week to help Spain mitigate the effects of the climate emergency, also warned that efforts to tackle the crisis were being undermined by rightwing parties adopting the far right\u2019s narratives in the hope of electoral gain.\n\u201cOf course, there\u2019s a far right that denies the reality of the climate emergency,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe problem that we\u2019re now facing is that there are traditional rightwing parties that perhaps don\u2019t deny the scientific reality, but which act and behave as if climate change doesn\u2019t exist. And this is the biggest problem. I think that traditional rightwing parties \u2013 not the far right \u2013 trying to transform the scientific evidence on climate change into ideological and political struggles is the biggest mistake that rightwing parties are committing. And this is something we\u2019re facing in Spain.\u201d\nHe was speaking after the UK Conservative party said it will aim to \u201cmaximise extraction\u201d of oil and gas in the North Sea if it wins power, copying Trump\u2019s \u201cdrill, baby, drill\u201d election slogan.\nS\u00e1nchez, whose party, administration and family have faced a slew of damaging corruption allegations over recent months that have threatened to topple his minority government, said he was committed to cracking down on graft, and to transparency.\nAsked whether he had confidence in Spain\u2019s justice system given his claims that his wife is the victim of a rightwing and far-right judicial smear campaign, he said: \u201cThe large majority of judges in Spain fulfil their obligations and do their jobs \u2026 But there are some judges that are playing politics, and that\u2019s a reality we\u2019re facing not only in Spain but also in many other democracies \u2013 especially when it comes to progressive forces or progressive governments.\u201d\nS\u00e1nchez said his minority government was delivering economically and socially and would continue to do so. \u201cOf course these corruption scandals were very difficult for us to accept, but the political project is broader, and I think the most important message that I\u2019d like to explain to my citizens is that the direction of the country that we started seven years ago is the correct one, and it\u2019s not an abstract one,\u201d he said.\nHe said the opposition parties offered no real alternative, only \u201ca regression\u201d, adding: \u201cWhat we\u2019re witnessing in Spain is the political collapse of the traditional party, not only in substance, but also in style, because it\u2019s copying the far right.\u201d"

      "text": "Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s claim that the Israeli military\u2019s killing of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in Gaza on Monday night was \u201ca tragic incident\u201d did precious little to allay the fears of Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez. Nor did his assertion that \u201cthis happens in wartime\u201d.\nS\u00e1nchez, who has been one of the most outspoken and persistent European critics of the way in which Israel has prosecuted its war in Gaza after the terrorist atrocities of 7 October, described the Israeli prime minister\u2019s \u201csupposed explanations\u201d as \u201ctotally unacceptable and insufficient\u201d. He added that Spain was waiting for a full and detailed account of the killings before deciding \u201cwhat action we\u2019ll take with regard to the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu\u201d.\nS\u00e1nchez\u2019s latest remarks \u2013 along with his announcement on Monday that Spain intends to recognise a Palestinian state by July \u2013 are a further example of how some of the more habitually taciturn members of the EU have found themselves compelled to speak up amid concerns that the bloc is failing to live up to its moral, political and humanitarian duties.\nWhile condemning Hamas\u2019s \u201cshocking acts of terrorism\u201d and acknowledging Israel\u2019s right to defend itself, S\u00e1nchez has infuriated Netanyahu\u2019s government by calling the number of dead Palestinians \u201ctruly unbearable\u201d, and emphasising that Israel\u2019s response cannot include \u201cthe deaths of innocent civilians, including thousands of children\u201d. Spain\u2019s socialist prime minister has also said he has \u201cgenuine doubts\u201d about whether Israel is complying with international humanitarian law in its offensive in Gaza.\nIn an interview with al-Jazeera on Thursday afternoon, S\u00e1nchez said Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza could even lead the EU to debate \u201cwhether we continue with this strategic relation or not\u201d.\nThe language from Ireland, which is widely perceived as the most pro-Palestinian voice in the EU, has been similarly unvarnished. The outgoing taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has described the assault as \u201capproaching revenge\u201d, while the foreign minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin, has said it was \u201cdisproportionate\u201d.\nSome European diplomats feel history will not look kindly on the EU\u2019s inclination to look the other way on Israel and Gaza when the bloc was all too prepared to call out Russia\u2019s actions in Ukraine. One senior diplomatic source told the Guardian that Spain and Ireland\u2019s strong positions on Palestine were beginning to pay off, adding that each time Madrid and Dublin spoke out, the loneliness of their stance faded and others were emboldened to join them.\nBoth S\u00e1nchez and Spain\u2019s foreign minister, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Albares, are adamant that the two-state solution remains the only answer to the crisis in the Middle East \u2013 hence the Spanish government\u2019s urgency in recognising a Palestinian state.\n\u201cIf we look at the medium and long term, if we don\u2019t do something differently to how we have been acting in the last decade, we will see this spiral of violence once again. And in order to do that [something different] \u2026 we need a real and valuable Palestinian state,\u201d Albares told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday. \u201cThat\u2019s why we are going to recognise the state of Palestine.\u201d\nAlbares also pointed out that the recognition of a Palestinian state had long been a key foreign policy commitment for S\u00e1nchez\u2019s Spanish Socialist Worker\u2019s party (PSOE). The EU\u2019s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, himself a former Spanish foreign minister, has also made his feelings plain when it comes to Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza.\n\u201cWhich are the other solutions they have in mind?\u201d Borrell said in January. \u201cTo make all the Palestinians leave? To kill them? Twenty-five thousand already in Gaza, 70% women and children. Certainly, the way of trying to destroy Hamas is not the way they are doing, because they are seeding the hate for generations.\u201d\nDublin has been seeking to make common cause with like-minded members and has calibrated its statements to nudge, but not subvert, the EU foreign policy mainstream. As well as teaming up with Spain, Slovenia and Malta last month to express a readiness to recognise Palestinian statehood, it has partnered with Spain to prod the EU into reviewing an Israel trade deal over human rights obligations.\nLast week Ireland announced it would intervene in South Africa\u2019s landmark international court of justice case against Israel by attempting to widen the definition of genocide to include blocking aid.\n\u201cClearly an entire population is being impacted here not just through the bombing but through starvation,\u201d Martin, told the Guardian. \u201cWe\u2019ve experienced famine, we know what it\u2019s like in our psyche,\u201d he said, citing the 1840s disaster known as the Great Hunger.\nMartin linked Dublin\u2019s response to the devastation in Gaza with an Irish foreign policy tradition of seeking to curb certain weapons, such as cluster munitions, and promoting humanitarian corridors in Syria, Ethiopia and other conflicts.\nMartin said he expected Ireland\u2019s foreign policy to remain unchanged under Simon Harris, who is due to succeed Varadkar as taoiseach next week. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked with Simon Harris for the last four years in government, so we don\u2019t anticipate any major issues around the content of foreign policy,\u201d he said.\nIrish diplomats and analysts say Ireland\u2019s colonial history has predisposed it to back the underdog. It was the first EU state to endorse Palestinian statehood in 1980. Even so, Ireland strives to remain within the EU consensus, said Niall Holohan, who served as Ireland\u2019s representative to the Palestinian Authority from 2002 to 2006.\nIsrael has accused Dublin of giving succour to Hamas, whose 7 October attack on southern Israel triggered the war, but domestically the Irish government has faced accusations of being too soft on Israel. Opposition parties have pushed for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador and proposed a law that would ban the Irish state from investing in companies that operate in illegal Israeli settlements, moves the government has resisted.\nS\u00e1nchez\u2019s erstwhile allies in the far-left Podemos party have also been forthright in their condemnation, accusing Israel of planning a \u201cgenocide\u201d against the Palestinian people and calling for Netanyahu to be brought before the international criminal court to face war crimes charges.\nAs European and international exasperation increases, some diplomats blame the continued division in the bloc on the early unconditional support for Israel given by the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, arguing it would not be at odds if she had clearly mentioned Israel\u2019s obligation to observe human rights in her initial support of the country\u2019s right to defend itself.\nSix months on, waiting for a change in the status quo is simply no longer an option for many. \u201cIf we wait for the 27 member states [to recognise Palestine] we will be waiting for ever,\u201d said one senior diplomat."

      "text": "The Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, will land in China this weekend for his first visit in seven years \u2013 a trip that puts him in the company of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, and the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, just as India\u2019s ties with Washington have soured.\nModi\u2019s visit to Tianjin for a regional security summit comes days after the US doubled tariffs on Indian exports to 50%, citing New Delhi\u2019s refusal to stop buying Russian oil.\nThe row has upended years of deepening cooperation between India and the US, built on technology and a shared determination to counter Beijing\u2019s global ambitions. It has also forced India to aggressively look elsewhere to diversify its trade.\n\u201cIndian trust in the US is shattered,\u201d the South Asia analyst Michael Kugelman said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure whether US officials fully realise how much trust they have squandered in such a short time.\u201d\nFor China, the two-day Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit that starts on Sunday could not be better timed. Modi \u201cwill be in China at a moment when India-China relations are stabilising and India-US relations have gone south. It is a powerful optic,\u201d Kugelman said.\n\u201cNo doubt there are some in China who are revelling in the trade tensions between India and the US,\u201d said Manoj Kewalramani, the head of Indo-Pacific studies at the Takshashila Institution in Bengaluru.\nPutin would want to \u201ccapitalise on the moment by reasserting Russia\u2019s close relationship with India\u201d, Kugelman said, adding that it would be \u201ca great moment for everyone to stick out their tongues at Washington\u201d.\nWashington has pointed to India\u2019s continuing purchases of Russian crude oil and defence hardware as the reason for the tariff increase, arguing that Delhi is helping fund Moscow\u2019s war on Ukraine.\nAs Modi began his trip, Donald Trump\u2019s trade adviser Peter Navarro stepped up his attack on India, claiming on X that the country had become an \u201coil money laundromat for the Kremlin\u201d.\nIndia has consistently defended its Russian oil purchases, saying they are vital to keep energy costs stable in the vast developing economy, help steady prices globally and comply with international law. Modi has tried to strike a balance over the Ukraine war, refusing to criticise Moscow directly while urging peace.\nThe economic blow of the tariffs is immense. The US is India\u2019s biggest export market at $86.5bn a year, and two-thirds of that \u2013 about $60.2bn in goods \u2013 is subject to the new duties, hitting labour-intensive sectors from textiles to jewellery.\nEven before the tariffs, India had been cautiously warming to China as a source of investment and technology and in hopes of boosting trade.\nRelations froze after a deadly clash along their disputed Himalayan border in 2020 but began to thaw when Modi and Xi met in person for the first time in four years at a Brics summit in Russia in October. Now, \u201cthe US-India crisis has given Modi good cause to accelerate efforts to ease tensions\u201d, Kugelman said.\nModi is expected to meet Xi on the sidelines of the regional summit, with trade and investment high on the agenda.\n\u201cAn effort is under way to see if India and China can reach some sort of new equilibrium,\u201d Kewalramani said. \u201cBoth recognise that the world order is in flux. Neither is likely to decisively manage all the frictions but there\u2019s at least a process of trying to grow the relationship.\u201d\n\u201cHistorical mistrust will remain,\u201d he added, pointing to their contested frontier that China continues to reinforce with new roads, railways and settlements. \u201cBut if Delhi and Beijing can create a measure of stability and predictability, without expecting structural breakthroughs, there are practical gains to be had.\u201d\nRussia, too, stands to benefit from India\u2019s rift with the US, with Delhi seeing the relationship as more vital than ever for balancing ties with the west, diversifying military hardware purchases and ensuring energy security.\nFor Modi, the photos of him standing alongside Xi and Putin at the summit \u201cwill send a pointed message to Washington\u201d, a retired Indian diplomat said.\nIndian officials stress Delhi wishes to continue its ties with the US, but also needs to \u201cdiversify its partnerships\u201d. India cannot \u201cafford to appear as though it is giving in to US pressure on oil imports, or anything else that could be construed as a capitulation \u2013 and public anger is high\u201d, said one official who could not be named.\nOn Thursday, the Indian government fired its first shot to offset the US tariffs, rolling out an export drive across 40 countries from the UK to South Korea to boost its textile trade.\nBefore heading to China, Modi travelled to Tokyo for the annual India-Japan summit, where he met the Japanese prime minister, Shigeru Ishiba. The trip takes on added weight in light of the US tariffs, as by deepening defence, technology and investment ties with Japan, India signals it can cushion the blow of lost US market access.\nJapanese companies are also set to invest up to \u00a510tn ($68bn) in India in the next decade, public broadcaster NHK said, as Suzuki Motor pledged to pump in about $8bn (\u00a36bn) over the next five to six years.\nThe two nations were partners \u201cmade for each other\u201d, Modi said this week, after visiting a Suzuki plant in India. The leaders are expected to discuss tie-ups on critical minerals and Japanese investments in high-value manufacturing in India, officials said.\nIndia is believed to hold substantial deposits of rare earths \u2013 used in everything from smartphones to solar panels \u2013 but lacks the technology to mine and process them extensively.\nWith Reuters"

S\u00e1nchez also highlighted Spain\u2019s refusal to meet Trump\u2019s 5% defence\u2011spending target and the potential for tariffs, while calling for greater solidarity and consistency in tackling climate change. His remarks signal a push for a more assertive EU stance and a re\u2011evaluation of Spain\u2019s role in global affairs.",
