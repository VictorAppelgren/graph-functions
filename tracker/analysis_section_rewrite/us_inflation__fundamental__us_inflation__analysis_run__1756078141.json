      "feedback": "Actionable edits to lift the piece to world‑class level: reframe the narrative as a true multi‑year, regime‑based macro framework anchored in first principles (real rate differentials, terms of trade, productivity, BoP/international balance of payments, and policy reaction functions). Explicitly map regimes and transition conditions (e.g., regime A: data‑dependent easing with Powell signaling rate cuts and Jackson Hole/5‑year policy review anchoring a 2% target framework; regime B: inflation sticky but policy still constrained; regime C: AI‑driven productivity disruption and potential UBI debates; regime D: tariff/geopolitical shocks). For each regime, state the causal chain to asset pricing: how policy stance shifts discount rates, risk premia, and capital allocation; how crypto pricing is transmitted through institutional entry (ETH ETFs inflows, corporate treasuries), staking dynamics, and regulatory tailwinds (GENIUS Act, Project Crypto) with precise links to OGK8WLL69. Quantify the base case with numbers drawn from sources: ETH near 4,955 (OGK8WLL69) and recent intraday highs; BTC around 110k–125k bands; Bitmine Immersion’s $45 million ether treasury activity; ETH ETF inflows totaling roughly $9.6B year‑to‑date (via sources like OGK8WLL69 and related scraped pieces); Ford’s 5.18% dividend yield and forward P/E ≈10.3 illustrating income‑tilted demand in risk‑off tones (W2622L6WW). Integrate transferable non‑crypto anchors (O’Leary’s two rules on financial independence and quality holdings; NL5YYTLF2’s identity/UBI critique) to ground medium‑term demand shifts in household/behavioral context, citing 1GVYF2V8O and 2QRLB974F for the behavioral/wealth‑planning lens and NL5YYTLF2 for UBI identity risks. Build a narrow set of catalysts/triggers and invalidation points: policy clarity/timing (Powell’s rate‑cut path), regulatory milestones (GENIUS Act/Project Crypto), notable treasury moves, and AI‑displacement signals that could alter employment/consumption dynamics; define explicit invalidation scenarios (e.g., a surprise hawkish inflation surprise or tariff regime reversal) and the market responses. Constrain the piece with disciplined citation mapping (attach IDs after every factual claim) and reconcile tensions across sources (the bullish crypto‑adoption view in OGK8WLL69 versus NL5YYTLF2’s caution on UBI/identity, and Ford’s dividend‑driven equity narrative in W2622L6WW). Finally, deliver a clean base‑case, a concise watchlist, and a confidence assessment (quantify regime probabilities where possible) to satisfy SECTION FOCUS; ensure the prose preserves coherence of the causal chain, uses concrete numbers rather than platitudes, and keeps the length tight without sacrificing essential caveats (OGK8WLL69; NL5YYTLF2; W2622L6WW; 1GVYF2V8O; 2QRLB974F).",
