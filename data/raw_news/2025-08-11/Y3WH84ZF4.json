  "title": "Why Dennis Quaid's iconic 'Parent Trap' pool scene was a costume designer's nightmare",
  "description": "Dennis Quaid's famous pool scene from \"The Parent Trap\" turned out to be a massive undertaking in the fashion department.",
  "content": "Not even Elizabeth James could save Dennis Quaid from the fashion heroics of \"The Parent Trap.\"\n\nQuaid starred alongside then-newcomer Lindsay Lohan and Natasha Richardson in the 1998 family comedy about estranged twin sisters Hallie Parker and Annie James, who scheme to reunite their divorced parents after meeting during a chance encounter at summer camp.\n\nOne of Quaid's most memorable scenes from the Disney film, which grossed $92.1 million at the global box office, is when his character Nick Parker spots his fashion designer ex, Elizabeth James (Richardson), at a hotel pool area.\n\nStunned to see his former spouse after more than a decade, Nick quickly \u2014 and ungracefully \u2014 makes his way across the deck to talk to James, eventually falling into the pool after bumping into a hotel employee. Nick, who was dressed in a crisp two-piece suit and black dress shoes, later emerges from the pool and sheepishly walks over to James to greet her.\n\n\"Dennis was very game to fall into the pool a few times in a row, which meant drying off, changing, and taking another spill,\" the film's director Nancy Meyers told People magazine in an interview published Aug. 9. \"He was just wonderful to work with.\"\n\nThe now-iconic scene was filmed at The Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey, California, and turned the marina hotel into something of a pop cultural landmark over the years.\n\n\"Of all the filming we have had at the hotel over the past 35 years, that is the movie that guests mention the most,\" Ed Curry, the hotel's director of sales and marketing, told the magazine. \"People love the movie, and all seem to know that is our pool area.\"\n\nQuaid's commitment to his \"Parent Trap\" wipeout came at a sartorial cost.\n\nCostume designer Penny Rose told People magazine that Quaid changed between six identical designer suits from Giorgio Armani for the aquatic scene, with the production crew even spraying the suits with pool water to test the fabric.\n\nRose noted that the chlorine from the pool water caused the suit to shrink. \"I mean, I've had Tom Cruise in a fake suede shirt so that he can get it wet,\" Rose said. \"But you can't really replicate an Armani suit.\"\n\nQuaid reflected on the impact of \"The Parent Trap\" on his career in a March interview with People magazine, telling the outlet that the beloved dad character has become his signature role.\n\n\"Everybody grew up with 'The Parent Trap,' and now there's always new kids coming along,\" said Quaid, jokingly adding: \"I tell people, 'I was your babysitter because your parents would put this on. They'd go do what they wanted to do in the next room.'\"",

      "text": "'Parent Trap' reunion! Lindsay Lohan explains Elaine Hendrix's 'Freakier Friday' cameo\nElaine Hendrix has long proclaimed that her character in \u201cThe Parent Trap\u201d is not the villain of the 1998 movie, and now Lindsay Lohan is weighing in.\nLohan, 39, played dual roles in Disney\u2019s remake, starring as twins Hallie and Annie, who were separated when their parents, Nick Parker (Dennis Quaid) and Elizabeth James (Natasha Richardson), divorced. Elizabeth raised Annie in London, while Hallie had her run of Nick\u2019s vineyard in Napa.\nA chance meeting at summer camp reunited the twins, and they switched places in hopes of bringing their parents back together. But the duo ran into a little problem when they learned that Nick was engaged to Meredith Blake (Hendrix), a 26-year-old PR powerhouse. Sure, she might be eyeing Nick\u2019s bank account and unknowingly standing in the way of true love, but as Meredith says in the movie, \u201cBeing young and beautiful is not a crime, you know.\u201d\nLohan and Hendrix reunite in \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d (in theaters now), a sequel to the 2003 film in which angsty teenager Anna (Lohan) switched bodies with her psychologist mom Tess (Jamie Lee Curtis). In the second installment, Anna has shelved her dreams of becoming a rock star in order to be a devoted mom to her teenage daughter Harper (Julia Butters) and now manages a rising pop artist, Ella (Maitreyi Ramakrishnan). Thanks to a fortune teller (Vanessa Bayer), Anna swaps with Harper and Tess trades places with Harper\u2019s school nemesis and soon-to-be stepsister Lily (Sophia Hammons).\nHendrix, 54, appears briefly as Anna\u2019s colleague Blake Kale, who assists at a photoshoot for Ella\u2019s album. Lohan tells USA TODAY that she and \u201cFreakier Friday\u201d director Nisha Ganatra are both friends with Hendrix, which is how the cameo came to be.\n\u201cWhen it was mentioned, \u2018Should we have Elaine do a little cameo?\u2019 We were like, \u2018Yeah, why not? Let's do it! Let's get Elaine in here,\u2019 \u201d Lohan says. \u201dBecause she's so awesome and she's amazing.\u201d\nLohan says she felt like the clock had turned back two decades.\n\u201cWhen we were shooting, I kept laughing because she says this line, something puss, and I was like, \u2018Oh, my God. That's like a \u2018Parent Trap\u2019 line,\u201d Lohan says. \u201cI felt like I was 10 again.\u201d (In \u201cThe Parent Trap,\u201c Meredith tells one of the twins, \u201cOK, puss, you listen and you listen good. I am marrying your father in two weeks, whether you like it or not.\u201d)\nIs Meredith the villain in 'The Parent Trap'?\nIn 2022, Hendrix leaned into the \u201cHe\u2019s a 10 but \u2026\u201d trend and took the opportunity to roast Nick in a TikTok set to Adele\u2019s \u201cEasy on Me.\u201d\nShe revisited the movie\u2019s plot with a video snippet of Hendrix pouring herself a tall glass of red wine.\nA voiceover says Meredith, Nick and the twins, \u201cgo on a camping trip to get to know one another, but you\u2019re not a nature girl and the twins know it. So the little brats put rocks in your backpack, a lizard on your head, sugar water in your mosquito repellent, and push your air mattress into the lake while you\u2019re sleeping.\u201d\nSo you lose it, the text reads, \u201cthreaten to ship them to Switzerland (for boarding school) and throw a ring at his head. And you\u2019ve never looked back.\u201d\n\u201cShe's a bit of a villain in that movie,\u201d Lohan says. \u201cBut she's also just a beautiful blonde bombshell who falls in love with a man, and it's his fault too.\u201d\n\u201cI think if you asked Hallie and Annie, they'd probably still say that she was the villain,\u201d Lohan adds with a laugh. \u201cOr I don't know what they\u2019d feel today! Maybe we'll see.\u201d"

She has been working at PEOPLE since 2023. Her work has previously appeared on Real Simple, Architectural Digest, and World Wildlife. People Editorial Guidelines Published on August 9, 2025 11:00AM EDT 17 Comments Natasha Richardson and Dennis Quaid in The Parent Trap. Credit : Disney NEED TO KNOW Nancy Meyers' 1998 remake of the classic 1961 The Parent Trap has been beloved since it hit the big screenOne pivotal scene, in which Dennis Quaid falls into a pool, proved to be a challenging day on setHere, 17 cast and crew members from The Parent Trap reveal what it was actually like to trap the parents and make the iconic movie It was a beautiful November day at the Ritz-Carlton in Marina del Rey, interrupted only by the continuous shout and splash of Dennis Quaid crashing into the pool. \u201cPoor Dennis went in and out of that pool for 4 days in an Armani suit that shrank the second he went in,\u201d The Parent Trap director Nancy Meyers said in the film\u2019s director's commentary. Now, 27 years later, she tells PEOPLE that Quaid\u2019s willingness to do it over and over again has always stuck with her. \u201cDennis was very game to fall into the pool a few times in a row, which meant drying off, changing and taking another spill,\u201d she says. \u201cHe was just wonderful to work with.\u201d The cast and crew of the iconic 1998 remake of the beloved 1961 original were nearing the end of their months-long shoot and finally filming the titular trap scene, where Quaid\u2019s Nick is so stunned by seeing Natasha Richardson\u2019s Elizabeth that he takes an epic trip and falls into the hotel\u2019s pool. Lindsay Lohan in The Parent Trap. Disney In what was Meyers\u2019 directorial debut, Lindsay Lohan also made her triumphant first splash on the big screen, new motion control technology was used to its most perfect potential and the set was filled with friends and family, including Meyers and producer Charles Shyer\u2019s two daughters, the real-life Annie and Hallie. Now, nearly three decades later, 17 of these actors, costumers, location managers and VFX experts sat down with PEOPLE to share their memories of this pivotal scene and the impact of the movie\u2019s legacy in the wake of Shyer\u2019s December 2024 death. Lohan, 39, tells PEOPLE that she can\u2019t pick just one piece of direction from Shyer or Meyers that has stuck with her because \"everything\" she learned \"from both of them on that film has always been incredible.\" The director-producer pair had their work cut out for them during the pool scene. Over the couple of days that The Parent Trap crew took over the Marina del Rey Ritz-Carlton, the director of photography, Dean Cundey, said lighting was their biggest foe. Location manager Rory Enke remembers Cundey using a simple trick to help Lohan stop squinting into the bright sun. \u201cBefore they rolled cameras, he said, \u2018Now Lindsay, I want you to close your eyes and put your face towards the sun.\u2019 And with her eyes closed, she stood there for maybe a minute,\u201d Enke explains to PEOPLE. \u201cThen he said, \u2018Now turn and look at me.\u2019 With her back to the sun, she opened her eyes, and she didn't squint.\" Dennis Quaid in The Parent Trap. Disney As the crew dealt with the ever-changing light, Quaid was getting his stunt practice in, changing between six identical Armani suits, being sprayed with pool water and intermittently jumping into the jacuzzi to warm up. Costume designer Penny Rose, who was hired in part because she had an 11-year-old daughter at the time, tells PEOPLE that the worst problem they faced still makes her laugh. \u201cIt was the shrinkage because of the chlorine. I mean, I've had Tom Cruise in a fake suede shirt so that he can get it wet. But you can't really replicate an Armani suit,\u201d she says, noting that the production team even got a sample of the Ritz\u2019s pool water to run tests on the fabric. Each night, costume supervisor Carolyn Dessert tells PEOPLE, the suits were picked up by Dmitry Tokar at La Cienega Dry Cleaners, made perfect again and brought back at 5 a.m. the next morning to do it all again. Composer Alan Silvestri, who had already worked with Meyers and Shyer on Father of the Bride, says that this pool stunt was more than just a fun gag; it also called back to the couple\u2019s body of work. \u201cFilmmakers have their motifs. As you recall, George Banks [in Father of the Bride] fell in a pool and so Chuck and Nancy have a thing about falling into pools,\u201d he says. \u201cI think audiences fall in love with filmmakers and their approaches to things. So inherently there are Easter eggs that are sometimes incredibly subtle that make for enjoying a filmmaker's body of work.\u201d Related Stories \"The Parent Trap\" 's Tie-Dye Girl Is Reclaiming the Joy from Her Iconic Role While Raising Her Own 4 Kids (Exclusive) Elaine Hendrix Is Coming Back to 'The Parent Trap,' but Not for a Sequel: 'Justice for Meredith Blake!' (Exclusive) Although the costuming was a hassle and the fall into the pool had to happen over and over again, Dessert says Quaid was a \u201ctrooper\u201d and stayed \u201ceasy going.\u201d Lohan, then 11, agreed in behind-the-scenes footage shot at the time. \u201cHe makes everything fun, even if it\u2019s the worst day of his life. For other actors, he\u2019ll make it fun,\u201d she said of Quaid. \u201cHe\u2019s always happy. I mean, he just did like five scenes in a row jumping into water, and he\u2019s still happy.\u201d Finding the perfect Nick was not a simple feat, casting director Ilene Starger tells PEOPLE. Ultimately, through the search, Starger found that one throughline in the process made the biggest impact on how they picked \u201cthe \u2018dream\u2019 dad.\u201d \u201cOne thing that moved me was that whenever Charles and Nancy\u2019s daughters Annie and Hallie would visit their offices, Charles would just light up at the sight of them, and put everything aside to spend time with them,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was obvious that he and Nancy were wonderful parents, and I think that informs their script for The Parent Trap, the roles of Nick and Elizabeth, and their working relationship with Lindsay.\u201d The role was unlike anything Quaid had starred in, as he was most known for violent, dramatic movies at the time, so his charming take on Nick Parker made an outsized impact on his career. The actor told PEOPLE in March 2025 that he is most recognized for the doting dad role. Natasha Richardson, Dennis Quaid, Elaine Hendrix, screenwriter Charles Shyer, director Nancy Meyers on set of The Parent Trap, 1998. Walt Disney/courtesy Everett Collection \"Everybody grew up with The Parent Trap and now there's always new kids coming along,\" he said, adding with a laugh, \"I tell people, 'I was your babysitter because your parents would put this on. They'd go do what they wanted to do in the next room.' \" While Quaid had quite a few acrobatics to perform in the scene, most of the actors were tasked with doing their best lounging by the poolside. When the scene opens, Nick's housekeeper Chessy (Lisa Ann Walter), Elizabeth's butler Martin (Simon Kunz) and Annie, still pretending to be Hallie (Lohan), are relaxing by the pool, discovering their newfound dynamic. \u201cMost of the time we just glammed it out,\u201d Kunz tells PEOPLE. The iconic house manager-butler duo had just met a scene ago, when Martin strolls into the hotel living room in only a Speedo. In the film, Chessy is taken by his confidence and the two immediately hit it off, rushing down to the pool, leaving Elizabeth to spiral. On set, Kunz was not so sure about being the only nearly naked man in a Disney movie. Rose remembers having to \u201cpersuade\u201d him into wearing the \u201cbudgie smuggler,\u201d as she and Kunz called it, after Meyers insisted it would be funny. \u201cIf ever I do get recognized nowadays, Speedos comes up. Handshake and Speedos. That's basically it. That's the two things,\u201d Kunz jokes to PEOPLE. Simon Kunz in The Parent Trap. Disney Walter, for her part, was reminded that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d but tells PEOPLE, \u201che did not need to be.\u201d \u201cThere was nothing to be ashamed of, seriously. When he came out, me and Natasha looked at each other and gave each other the raised eyebrow of, \u2018Hey,\u2019 \u201c she recalls. Walter even remembers Shyer at one point offering to \"strip down to a Speedo\" with him so that the actor didn't \"have to worry.\" In part, Chessy and Martin look to have such an instantly natural dynamic because Walter and Kunz had connected quickly on set, and their chemistry was evident. He says she took him under her wing because it was his first time in Los Angeles, and he had originally arrived solo. \u201cI did take him under my wing because I had a house in L.A. and family, and he was alone. Of course, he was gonna come over,\u201d Walter says. \u201cMy family loved him, too.\u201d While shooting the pool scene, and sunning themselves as Kunz remembers, he and Walter also had a little photoshoot, resulting in what she says are her \u201cfavorite on-set pictures ever.\u201d Simon Kunz in Parent Trap. Disney After Quaid falls into the pool, Martin snaps a photo of him, a moment Kunz said was a bit of improv. The actor says this kind of creativity was encouraged on set \u2014 Quaid\u2019s \u201cyou\u2019re all wet\u201d line was also improvised \u2014 and guided by Meyers\u2019 particular filmmaking sensibility. While some of the actors took a breather and had fun improvising during these shoot days, for the crew, the pool scene proved to be one of the most difficult logistically. Meyers and Shyer\u2019s assistant at the time, Roshanna Baron, who also appeared as an extra in the pool scene, remembers the mayhem of the shoot. \u201cThat day was very much a whirlwind. It had a lot of moving parts because everybody was on set and there were a lot of intricacies in trying to get the timing right,\u201d she tells PEOPLE. Script supervisor Jeanne Byrd, who was tasked with ensuring continuity at all times with the added challenge of motion control technology, tells PEOPLE that the scene had many hurdles. \u201cOh my gosh. Who said what, when, at what point does he come up out of the water with what hand flailing so she [Meyers] could cut to the wider shot of the same hand flailing? I mean, it was a nightmare,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cI don't think I slept for days before we shot that scene and probably drank lots of wine on the night that we finished it.\u201d Lindsay Lohan and Elaine Hendrix in Parent Trap. Disney Twenty-seven years later, though, they both have fresh perspectives on the moment. Baron still remembers the air on set. \u201cWhen we got done with the scene, everybody was clapping and grateful,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a fun set. Everybody was just happy to work around each other. It was a joy to be around when everybody knows what they're doing and gets it done right.\u201d Meyers agrees and adds, \u201cThe whole cast on that film was fantastic, and it was very fun having them all in the same scene.\u201d Thomas Harrigan, who was an assistant location manager, also concurs that all the right people came together on The Parent Trap, working to the best of their ability to make a difficult project come to life. \u201cYou just make it happen,\u201d he tells PEOPLE. \u201cThere's almost nothing impossible to do in film.\u201d And, despite the difficulties, Byrd concedes that she still enjoyed the pool scene more than the motion control shots. Out of only a handful of scenes like it, the pool scene featured an actor other than Lohan taking part in the new technology, Elaine Hendrix. Meyers and Shyer said they loved writing the scene in which her character, Meredith, enters and finally learns that there is not one but two of her archnemeses to contend with. In real life, the then-26-year-old was also taking on this new motion control style of shooting in stride. The technology allows camera movement to be computerized and replicated so filmmakers can shoot two sides of the same shot in an identical fashion. For the actors, this means repeating their lines and reactions over and over again. Lindsay Lohan behind the scenes of The Parent Trap. RGR Collection/Alamy \u201cI remember Nancy saying that she trusted me. By that point, she could see everything I could do physically and that she wasn't concerned,\u201d Hendrix tells PEOPLE. \u201cAnd I remember feeling kind of honored by that.\u201d Joining the ranks of Polly Holliday (who played camp leader Marva Sr. and appeared in a motion control shot during the breakfast line), Hendrix was directed to do the scene by the pool over and over again \u201cexactly like you did it before.\u201d Hendrix says. \u201cThat took particular focus and attention and time, and that was just longer to do.\u201d Gayle Busby, one of the visual effects producers, remembers the massive operation it took to run the motion control tech. Seven on-site technicians were constantly compositing the side-by-side shots of Lohan in the moment so that Meyers could pick which she most liked. Byrd likens the process to \u201cflying the plane while building it.\u201d She tells PEOPLE, \u201cThe motion control was stimulating because it was new and different, but it was also scary and so scientific.\u201d Our new app is here! Free, fun and full of exclusives. Scan to download now! The writing in this technically brilliant scene has its own charming flair, too, which made it Richardson\u2019s favorite in the whole movie, according to Meyers. The writers maintained a line from the original movie, when Annie says she has been \u201cquite without a father,\u201d and had a little more fun with Hallie\u2019s side of the coin, having the fiery twin rant about her upcoming \u201cmessed up teenage years.\u201d This labor of love on the intensive pool scene paid off, and then some. Ed Curry, director of sales and marketing at the Marina del Rey Ritz-Carlton, tells PEOPLE the hotel is lucky to still have some of the same staff who were working during filming and many of these folks (and guests!) remember the movie fondly. \u201cOf all the filming we have had at the hotel over the past 35 years, that is the movie that guests mention the most,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople love the movie, and all seem to know that is our pool area.\u201d Curry continues, \u201cThe leadership team even watched the pool scene for inspiration as we look to renovate the pool area.\u201d Simon Kunz and Lisa Ann Walter in The Parent Trap. Disney Picking locations for The Parent Trap, including the Marina Ritz, was an at times painstaking process, led by Enke, John Panzarella and Thomas Harrigan, among others. Enke, who had worked with Quaid on The Right Stuff years earlier, remembers dressing up an administration building on Treasure Island to look like the front of the grand hotel. Panzarella recalls spending time with revered production designer Dean Tavoularis while he and his family and friends, whom he\u2019d brought on as crew, searched for locations and had laughter-filled lunches in between. \u201cThe decorator [Gary Fettis] was his nephew, the art director [Alex Tavoularis] was his brother and the prop master [Douglas T. Madison] was somebody he had worked with for years and years, and we'd all go out to lunch together. It was like the Tavoularis Mafia,\u201d he tells PEOPLE with a laugh. \u201cDean would regale the table with incredible stories of Apocalypse Now and the making of The Godfather. It was just magic for me.\u201d Nancy Meyers, Lindsay Lohan, screenwriter Charles Shyer on set of The Parent Trap, 1998. Walt Disney/courtesy Everett Collection Casting director Starger reflects on how the magic of making The Parent Trap reverberated out into the success of the movie. \u201cIt\u2019s worth remembering that this was Nancy Meyers\u2019 first film as a director, and she did a superb job. It\u2019s a film which seems to appeal to all genders and ages, and it has stood the test of time in that audiences still enjoy it,\u201d she tells PEOPLE. \u201cI always smile when I\u2019m on a plane and notice, on a screen by someone else\u2019s seat, that they are watching this movie!\u201d The familial vibe on set spread into the cast\u2019s real-life connections and into the legacy of the movie, too. \u201cI'm very close with Nancy Meyers now, and I was close with Charles. They were like a second family to me,\u201d Lohan says. At the end of the director\u2019s commentary, as the credits play, Shyer says something particularly poignant to hear today. \u201cIf we get lucky, this could be one that lasts,\u201d he remarks as the final credits roll. And lasted it has, in ways far beyond the cast and crew\u2019s imagination. Close Leave a Comment Read more: Entertainment Movies Comedy Movies"

      "text": "Revive that handshake: 'The Parent Trap' is 25! See Lindsay Lohan and cast then and now\nWhile it might sound as absurd as two divorced parents splitting up and raising their identical twins as only children, the Lindsay Lohan version of \u201cThe Parent Trap\u201d turns 25 on Saturday.\nAs Hayley Mills did in the original 1961 movie \u2212 which inspired the 1998 remake \u2212 Lohan portrayed the pair of siblings scheming to get their parents back together upon realizing they have a twin. Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson play Annie and Hallie\u2019s parents, Nick Parker and Elizabeth James. The twins\u2019 mission of reuniting their parents was made all the harder by Nick\u2019s fianc\u00e9e Meredith Blake (Elaine Hendrix), who taught audiences that \u201cBeing young and beautiful is not a crime, you know.\u201d\nIn celebration of the anniversary, put on a pot of Chessy\u2019s chili as we dive into what the film\u2019s stars have been up to lately.\nLindsay Lohan\nLohan has gone from parent trapper who discovers she has a long-lost sister to parent herself: The 37-year-old actress and her husband, financier Bader Shammas, have welcomed their first child, the couple confirmed to USA TODAY earlier this month. They wed in 2022 and named their son Luai, meaning \u201cshield\u201d or \u201cprotector\u201d in Arabic.\nThough Lohan had a string of popular teen movies in the mid-2000s \u2212 \u201cFreaky Friday,\u201d \u201cConfessions of a Teenage Drama Queen\u201d and \u201cMean Girls\u201d \u2212 her career stalled amid struggles with substance abuse.\nLohan moved to Dubai in 2014 and worked sporadically, mostly on TV series. Last November, Netflix announced a two-picture deal with the star. The first film, \u201cFalling for Christmas,\u201d in which Lohan played a hotel heiress struck with amnesia, arrived that same month.\nLindsay Lohan is a mom! Actress welcomes first child with Bader Shammas\nDennis Quaid\nAfter Quaid played Nick, the man who could melt you just by saying \u201cLizzie,\u201d he continued to have a steady career, with roles in \u201cAny Given Sunday,\u201d \u201cTraffic,\u201d \u201cThe Rookie,\u201d \u201cThe Day After Tomorrow\u201d and the remake of \u201cFootloose.\u201d He received an Emmy nod for his work on HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Special Relationship\u201d (2010) for his portrayal of Bill Clinton.\nIn recent years, Quaid has starred in numerous inspirational films, including \u201cI Can Only Imagine,\u201d \u201cBlue Miracle\u201d and \u201cOn a Wing and a Prayer.\u201d This week, the 69-year-old released his Christian music album \"Fallen: A Gospel Record for Sinners.\" He told People that he had once again embraced his Christian upbringing.\nQuaid, who previously battled cocaine addiction, told the magazine: \u201cWhen you're done with the addiction, you need something to fill that hole, something that really works, right?\u201d\nNatasha Richardson\nFollowing her role as an elegant fashion designer in \u201cThe Parent Trap,\u201d Richardson appeared in 2002\u2019s \u201cMaid in Manhattan,\u201d starring Jennifer Lopez and Ralph Fiennes. Sadly, about a decade after \u201cThe Parent Trap,\u201d Richardson died in 2009 at 45. While skiing in Qu\u00e9bec, Richardson hit her head and refused to see a doctor. But she fell ill and her husband Liam Neeson made the decision to remove life support.\nQuaid remembered his co-star in a 2018 interview with Us Weekly. \u201cShe was such a beautiful person, such a beautiful, beautiful person. Just none of that, that actor stuff, prima donna stuff,\u201d Quaid said. \u201cSomeone easy to work with and such a great sense of humor.\u201d\n'Really special': Lindsay Lohan reflects on 'Parent Trap' experience in co-star reunion\nElaine Hendrix\nHendrix played the villain who thought she\u2019d scored, landing a fianc\u00e9 who owned a Napa Valley vineyard. With dreams of sending his maniacal twins to boarding school, Meredith was ultimately taken down by Annie and Hallie.\nFollowing \u201cThe Parent Trap,\u201d Hendrix, 52, appeared in popular series like \u201cFriends,\u201d \u201cER\u201d and \u201cTwo and a Half Men.\u201d More recently, she portrayed Alexis Carrington on CW\u2019s reboot of \"Dynasty.\"\nHendrix hasn\u2019t strayed from referencing the iconic Meredith Blake over the years on social media. \"People loved to hate her,\" she told Insider in 2021, \"and now people just love her.\"\nLisa Ann Walter\nAfter playing the sharp housekeeper Chessy in \u201cThe Parent Trap,\u201d Walter appeared on TV series like \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm,\u201d \u201cNip/Tuck\u201d and \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy.\u201d Since 2021, the 59-year-old actress has played rough-around-the-edges teacher Melissa Schemmenti on ABC darling \u201cAbbott Elementary.\u201d\nWalter and Hendrix remain close after all these years.

Dennis Quaid not sure it's possible without Natasha Richardson\nDennis Quaid is on board with a \"The Parent Trap\" revival \u2014 but the movie wouldn't be the same without a key character.\n\"That would be fantastic, but Natasha (Richardson). How do we do it without Natasha?\" he told Entertainment Tonight on the red carpet of his new film \"Reagan\" on Tuesday. Her sudden death at 45 years old in 2009 still \"breaks my heart,\" he added.\nIn the 1998 remake of the original \"The Parent Trap\" released in 1961, Quaid and Richardson played the parents of identical twins Annie and Hallie (played by Lindsay Lohan) who contrived a plot that brought the exes back together. Lisa Ann Walter \u2014 who recently said she'd \"love to go back for another version\" of the movie \u2014 played nanny Chessy, and Elaine Hendrix portrayed Quaid's villainous fianc\u00e9e, Meredith Blake.\nLohan \"is really fantastic. She's grown into a beautiful person,\" Quaid said.\n\"'The Parent Trap' was, like, a whole new career for me,\" he continued. \"It's such a beautiful movie. And I think people will be watching that 100 years from now, I really do.\"\nRichardson died after a seemingly minor fall that led to a blow to the head while skiing at Quebec\u2019s Mont Tremblant. The actress initially waved off medical care, but the head injury turned out to be fatal. She was survived by her husband, actor Liam Neeson, and their sons Miche\u00e1l and Daniel, who were then 13 and 12, respectively.\nRichardson was part of the prominent Redgrave family, the daughter of Oscar, Emmy, Tony and Golden Globe winner Vanessa Redgrave and director Tony Richardson.\n\u201cWhen that accident happened, it just devastated me and so many other people,\u201d Quaid told Us Weekly in 2018. \u201cShe had such a beautiful love, married life with Liam, and two beautiful boys. She always had a smile on her face when she came to work. That really affected everyone around her.\u201d\nTwenty-six years of 'The Parent Trap': See Lindsay Lohan and cast then and now\nLindsay Lohan cried when she caught her son watching 'The Parent Trap'\n\"The Parent Trap\" still holds a special place in Lohan's heart, too.\nIn 2020, director Nancy Meyers and Katie Couric reunited the cast over Zoom to reminisce and reenact scenes from the beloved film.\n\"Without this movie, I wouldn't have gotten the acting bug. How do you not want to only act for the rest of your life after doing a film like this?\" Lohan said in the video. \"It's timeless and special. Just really special.\"\nThe 26-year-old Disney film popped back up in Lohan's life in an unexpected way earlier this year when she caught her infant son Luai watching it on TV, she revealed on \u201cThe Drew Barrymore Show\u201d in March.\n\"I just started to cry because I'm like, he doesn't even know that's mommy yet,\u201d Lohan said. \u201cI was like, do I turn it off? And he was kind of just staring. Because maybe my voice is still similar to how it was then, so I was like, maybe he knows a little bit that it's me \u2018cause it sounds like me. But it was a really magical moment. I took tons of pictures of it.\"\nContributing: Bryan Alexander and Edward Segarra"
