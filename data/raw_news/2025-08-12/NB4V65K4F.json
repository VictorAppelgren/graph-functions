  "description": "President Trump\u2019s plan to end the war in Ukraine through Alaska talks with Putin hits roadblock as Zelenskyy cites constitutional limits on giving up land.",
  "content": "Tammy Bruce, the State Department spokeswoman, told me in an interview that the president is strategically positioned to stop the fighting in Ukraine.\n\n\"The point is that the killing has to end,\" she said on \"Media Buzz.\" \"And if there\u2019s anybody who can confront and deal with and manage Putin, it is Donald Trump.\"\n\nBut what if it\u2019s Putin who\u2019s managing Trump? And how can there be any kind of settlement when Volodymyr Zelenskyy is refusing to participate, saying the Kremlin dictator is trying to deceive America?\n\nTrump addressed this yesterday, at his news conference on the feds taking over the D.C. police department\u2013and let\u2019s just say he made a point of lowering expectations.\n\nOne thing that\u2019s impossible to ignore is that whenever Trump threatens sanctions against Moscow, he finds a way to avoid following through. Remember the 50-day deadline? And then the 10-day deadline?\n\nPutin has been diplomatically isolated since his illegal invasion of Ukraine, which has featured the deliberate killing of civilians. \n\nBy inviting him to Alaska\u2013which America bought from Russia in 1867 and is no longer deemed \"Seward\u2019s Folly\" \u2013 Trump is granting Putin respect as a legitimate world leader, not a pariah.\n\nPutin\u2019s plan all along has been to make gains on the battlefield and then hold onto all or most of that land in any settlement. That\u2019s why he\u2019s continued to intensively bomb Ukraine, killing more civilians, even amid the chatter about peace.\n\nZelenskyy says he can\u2019t cede any land because that would violate the country\u2019s constitution. It would also create a political firestorm at home. But a recent poll says 38 percent of Ukrainians are willing to give up some territory to end the war.\n\nTRUMP BLASTS ZELENSKYY FOR CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECTION TO 'LAND SWAPPING' IN UKRAINE WAR\n\nTrump has talked about \"some swapping of territories,\" but Ukraine doesn\u2019t have much to swap. The country took over 500 square miles in a surprise attack in the Russian area of Kursk, but that has dwindled to just four square miles and came at the cost of significant casualties.\n\nSo this could be a repeat of what happened when Russia seized Crimea in 2014. The world was outraged, and then everything went back to normal.\n\nAs for Putin, Trump told reporters yesterday, \"I\u2019d have a great call with him and then missiles would be lobbed into Kyiv.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m going to be telling him to end this war.\"\n\n\"I get along with Zelenskyy but I disagree with what he\u2019s done.\"\n\nThe president said he\u2019ll try to get some territory back \"for the good of Ukraine.\"\n\n\"Probably in the first two minutes, I\u2019ll know whether a deal can be made.\"\n\nIf not, \"I may leave and say good luck.\"\n\nNow you might question why Trump is granting Putin an audience on U.S. soil without any previous understanding. The president believes in face-to-face negotiating but it doesn\u2019t always work. For all the love letters between him and Kim Jong-un, North Korea never budged on its nuclear program.\n\nTrump said of Putin and Zelenskyy, \"Ultimately I\u2019m going to put the two of them in a room.\" Well, maybe.\n\nEven if Zelenskyy goes to Alaska, or a later meeting with Putin, he\u2019s not going to agree to rewarding Russia for its military aggressiveness, giving land \"to the occupier,\" as he put it.. Trump may blame Zelenskyy as the fall guy, but that doesn\u2019t get us any closer to peace.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBesides, Zelenskyy would understandably want security guarantees. Otherwise, Putin could use a cease-fire to allow his forces to rest and recuperate, then attack again in six months or a year\u2013a replay of the post-Crimea strategy.\n\nSo much for settling the war in 24 hours.\n\nIt\u2019s a bloody, frustrating, complicated war that has resulted in huge casualties for both sides. But it all stems from an illegal invasion by a dictator who insists that Ukraine has no right to exist.",

  "summary": "The State Department spokeswoman, Tammy Bruce, stated that Donald Trump is positioned to mediate and manage Putin in an effort to end the fighting in Ukraine. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has been diplomatically isolated since his illegal invasion of Ukraine, has refused to participate in any settlement talks. He has been criticized by Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who believes Putin's plan is to gain on the battlefield and then hold onto all or most of the land in any agreement. Despite this, a recent poll found that 38 percent of Ukrainians were willing to give up some territory to end Ukraine's war. Despite these efforts, there is a risk of a repeat of what happened when Russia took Crimea in 2014, which was seen as a major issue. Despite inviting Putin to Alaska, Trump has shown signs of respect for Putin, stating he will know 'in the first two minutes' if a peace deal can be made.",

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump.

We are grateful to everyone around the world who supports peace efforts and helps us protect lives,\" Zelenskyy wrote on X.\n\"We understand who makes the decisions in Russia and who must end this war.

Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences. I hope this will not be one of those instances,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\nZelenskyy\u2019s message comes as Putin has just one week to meet Trump\u2019s deadline for ending the three-and-a-half-year war. Acting U.S. Representative John Kelley announced the deadline at a United Nations Security Council briefing on \"Threats to International Peace and Security.\"\nTrump, who has consistently voiced his desire to end the war, recently said Russia\u2019s actions against Ukraine were \"disgusting.\"\n\"Both Russia and Ukraine must negotiate a ceasefire and durable peace. It is time to make a deal. President Trump has made clear this must be done by August 8. The United States is prepared to implement additional measures to secure peace,\" Kelley said.\nKelley reiterated the U.S.\u2019s support of Ukraine\u2019s right to defend itself in the face of Russian attacks.\nTRUMP BRUSHES BACK RUSSIA'S MEDVEDEV AFTER 'WAR' WARNING: 'WATCH HIS WORDS'\n\"Our support for Ukraine\u2019s defense cannot be compared to the supply of arms and material to Russia, which enables Russia to continue its full-scale invasion and occupation of Ukrainian territory,\" Kelley said. \"Last week, we called on all UN Member States to help bring the war to an end by ceasing any and all support to Russia\u2019s war efforts. We do so again today.\"\nThe American diplomat explicitly named North Korea, China, and Iran as countries that have helped Russia both directly and indirectly. He said that while Beijing has not directly provided Moscow with weapons, it has acted as a \"decisive enabler\" by \"being the most important supplier of Russia\u2019s war industrial machine.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIt seems unlikely that Russia would come to the negotiating table as it carried out a deadly airstrike against Kyiv and its representatives at the U.N. appeared to double down on Moscow\u2019s desire to retake Ukraine.\n\"We are not seeking to destroy [Ukraine], its culture or its identity. We would like Ukrainian [and] Russian cultures coexist in this country, as it used to be for decades without any problems or conflicts,\" Russia\u2019s Mission to the U.N. wrote on X.\nIn the early hours of Thursday, Russia launched more than 300 drones and eight missiles that hit residential areas in Kyiv. On Friday, Ukraine mourned after 31 were killed in the strike, which was the deadliest air attack carried out by Moscow this year. The death toll includes five children, one of whom was just two years old, according to Reuters. Additionally, more than 150 people were wounded, including 16 children."

This is a war that should have never happened,\" Trump said, reiterating his belief that the Ukrainian president is in part at fault for Russia\u2019s illegal 2022 invasion.\n\"I was a little bothered by the fact that Zelensky was saying, \u2018Well, I have to get constitutional approval\u2019,\" Trump said. \"I mean, he's got approval to go into war and kill everybody, but he needs approval to do a land swap, because there'll be some land swapping going on.\"\nSUMMIT WITH PUTIN SET TO TOP TRUMP'S AGENDA THIS WEEK AS UKRAINE WAR TAKES CENTER STAGE\n\"I know that through Russia and through conversations with everybody,\" Trump added, noting it was \"for the good of Ukraine.\"\nZelenskyy \u2013 who did not declare war on Russia, as Moscow had already invaded, did declare Martial Law on Feb. 24, 2022 with the approval of Ukraine\u2019s parliament, which gave him presidential powers to mobilize a military response \u2014 made clear over the weekend that he objected to Trump\u2019s \"land swapping\" proposal and has repeatedly said it would require a national referendum under the nation\u2019s constitution, not a unilateral decision by him.\nZELENSKYY THANKS NATO, EUROPEAN LEADERS FOR BACKING HIS PUSH TO JOIN TRUMP\u2011PUTIN SUMMIT\nTrump wouldn\u2019t detail what exactly he hopes to get out of the meeting with Putin and described it as a \"feel-out meeting,\" saying within \"the first two minutes [he\u2019ll] know exactly whether or not a deal can be made.\"\n\"I'm going in to speak to Vladimir Putin, and I'm going to be telling him, you got to end this war, you got to end it,\" Trump said, reiterating his belief that if he had won the 2020 election, Putin wouldn\u2019t have invaded Ukraine, saying \"he wasn\u2019t going to mess with me.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I go into that thing fully loaded right up there, and we're going to see what happens,\" he continued. \"It could be a good meeting, and we'll go a step further.
