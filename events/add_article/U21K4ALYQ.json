Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that a weaker labor market and tariff risks could justify a cut, prompting a 2% rally in the Dow and gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. Meanwhile, Trump’s remarks on tariffs and the Fed, and a lawsuit over a Tesla Cybertruck fire, a Cracker Barrel rebrand backlash, and a Google Gmail security alert illustrate broader market and regulatory turbulence.",
