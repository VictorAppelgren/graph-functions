  "content": "A ferry thought to have been operating for more than 700 years is running again after essential repairs to its landings. In January, the West Lynn Ferry in Norfolk was suspended because of cracks in concrete steps and concerns about safety barriers and handrails. But, with work complete, it resumed trips across the Great Ouse between King's Lynn and West Lynn at 07:00 BST on Monday. One of the first on board was the mayor of Lynn and West Norfolk, councillor Andy Bullen, who said: \"You see King's Lynn in another light from the other side of the river.\"\n\nHe added: \"There was a lot of local people, even though it was seven o'clock in the morning. \"So many people are committed to the ferry, it's held with great affection locally. \"It's not only wonderful for West Lynn and King's Lynn and further afield, but it's a great part of the town.\n\nAccording to the King's Lynn Civic Society, there has been a ferry operating on the river since at least 1285. Previously, Ben Ellis, skipper and co-owner, said he was looking forward to getting back up and running. \"The ferry's coming back stronger than ever. I can't wait to get going. \"To all those who said they'd use it, I hope to see you soon,\" he said. The repairs have been jointly funded by Norfolk County Council and the Borough Council of King's Lynn and West Norfolk.",

We need a way of carrying a large number of people across the river.\"\nCurrently, there is no pedestrian-only bridge across the Great Ouse.\nPeople have to drive south from West Lynn to the Pullover Roundabout, before driving across the A47 road bridge to get to King's Lynn, or by using the Wisbech Road/Clenchwarton Road single-carriageway bridge just to the north of it.\nWhile the construction of a bridge may be a long way off, Alexandra Kemp, who co-leads the Progressive Independent group, was successful in gaining funding for the study into the ferry, which gained widespread support.\nShe highlighted the importance of the service as an important link for West Lynn \u2013 a community she says is \"socially isolated\" \u2013 through reducing the number of cars entering the town.\nWest Norfolk Council officials are currently working to bring the ferry back into use by repairing the landing stage.\nGet in touch\nDo you have a story suggestion for Norfolk?\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, external, Instagram, external and X, external.\nRelated internet links\n- Published25 February\n- Published16 January"
