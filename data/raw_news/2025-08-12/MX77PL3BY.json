  "description": "Perplexity has offered to buy Chrome from Google for $34.5 billion cash in an unsolicited offer.",
  "content": "In a moonshot move, AI search engine Perplexity has offered to buy Chrome from Google for $34.5 billion cash in an unsolicited offer, Reuters reported and Perplexity has confirmed to TechCrunch.\n\nPerplexity tells TC the terms of the offer include a commitment to keep Chrome\u2019s underlying engine, Chromium, open source and continue to invest in it. Perplexity\u2019s offer includes a promise to invest $3 billion into the open source project.\n\nPerplexity is also promising not to change the user defaults of Chrome users, including the default search engine. That is, Perplexity is promising to leave Google as the search engine rather than making its own AI-powered option the default.\n\nGoogle could not be reached for comment. TechCrunch will update the article if the company responds.\n\nThis bid comes after the Department of Justice proposed in March that Google be forced to sell Chrome after a judge ruled the tech giant acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search. Google has not agreed to sell Chrome and has vowed to fight the ruling.\n\nThe Perplexity spokesperson believes the court will soon set terms for remedies, perhaps later this month. (Google is also fighting another federal case where the judge ruled it illegally monopolized adtech, and the DOJ is proposing Google be forced to divest two of its adtech products or otherwise break up its ad business.)\n\nWhen the DOJ first proposed that Google divest Chrome, both OpenAI and Perplexity expressed interest in buying it. Given that Chrome is the dominant browser, with 68% marketshare according to Statcounter, if the court rules Chrome must be sold, no doubt others worldwide would want to bid as well.\n\nInterestingly, the CEO of rival search engine Duck Duck Go testified in April that Chrome could be worth \u201cupwards of $50 billion,\u201d Bloomberg reported at the time. Should Perplexity\u2019s offer succeed, it could be considered a bargain.\n\nStill, this offer for Chrome is far more than Perplexity has raised from investors and more than the startup\u2019s current valuation. Perplexity has raised about $1.5 billion to date, Pitchbook estimates, including an extension round of $100 million raised last month that valued it at $18 billion, Bloomberg reported.\n\nIn the meantime, Perplexity last month launched its own browser, called Comet, in its bid to grow its AI search business without having to serve its customers through a browser, particularly one owned by its main rival Google.\n\nAnd, by the way, last month, Perplexity also reportedly submitted a bid to merge with TikTok.",

      "text": "Google will appeal a U.S. District Court judge\u2019s opinion Monday that found the technology giant acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search.\nThe decision from Judge Amit P. Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia is a major defeat for Google that could alter the way it does business and even change the structure of the internet as we know it, should the decision stand.\nMehta said that Google abused its monopoly power over the search business in part by paying companies like Apple to present its search engine as the default choice on their devices and web browsers. The Justice Department and states filed the antitrust suit against Google in 2020, which kicked off in court in September 2023.\nGoogle pays companies, including Apple, Samsung and Mozilla, billions of dollars for prime placement in web browsers and on smartphones. In 2021 alone, Google spent $26 billion to be the default search engine across Apple and Android platforms. According to The New York Times, about $18 billion of that spend went to Apple alone. Google shares 36% of search ad revenue from Safari with Apple. The government has argued that paying for the dominant position effectively kneecapped competitors from being able to build up their own search engines to a scale that would give them the data and reach to stay competitive.\n\u201cAfter having carefully considered and weighed the witness testimony and evidence, the court reaches the following conclusion: Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly,\u201d Mehta wrote in his opinion filed Monday. \u201cIt has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.\u201d\nSection 2 of the Sherman Act makes it illegal for any person or business to monopolize, attempt to monopolize or conspire to monopolize any part of trade or commerce.\nKent Walker, Google\u2019s president of Global Affairs, told TechCrunch the company plans to appeal the decision. Walker doubled down on Google\u2019s previous arguments that it has used its dominant position to make the best and most useful search engine, which has benefited consumers and advertisers alike.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\n\u201cThis decision recognizes that Google offers the best search engine, but concludes that we shouldn\u2019t be allowed to make it easily available,\u201d Walker told TechCrunch. \u201cWe appreciate the Court\u2019s finding that Google is \u2018the industry\u2019s highest quality search engine, which has earned Google the trust of hundreds of millions of daily users\u2019, that Google \u2018has long been the best search engine, particularly on mobile devices\u2019, \u2018has continued to innovate in search\u2019 and that \u2018Apple and Mozilla occasionally assess Google\u2019s search quality relative to its rivals and find Google\u2019s to be superior.\u2019\u201d\nThe opinion caps off a years-long case \u2014 U.S. et al. v. Google \u2014 that resulted in a 10-week trial last year. The Department of Justice and a group of attorneys general from 38 states and territories, led by Colorado and Nebraska, filed similar but separate antitrust suits against Google in 2020, alleging that Google unfairly blocked out would-be search rivals like Bing and DuckDuckGo. The Department of Justice estimated that Google had a 90% share of the search market, a figure that Google disputed.\nThe outcome of the case is a significant win for the Justice Department in an election year when former president Donald Trump would, should he win a second term in office, almost certainly take a decidedly more hands-off, deregulatory approach to tech. President Joe Biden\u2019s pick to lead the Federal Trade Commission, Lina Khan, has garnered a reputation for coming after big tech, particularly in regards to antitrust law, that many of those companies have not taken kindly to.\nThis case could set precedent for the raft of other antitrust lawsuits making their way through the courts today. The DOJ has sued Apple for making it difficult for consumers to switch away from the iPhone. The FTC has also recently sued Meta for stamping out early competitors and Amazon for squeezing sellers on its online marketplace.\nJudge Mehta\u2019s decision Monday may also impact the outcome of the Justice Department\u2019s second antitrust suit against Google, which alleges that Google illegally monopolized the digital ads market. Arguments for that case are scheduled to begin September 9.\nThe judge has yet to decide remedies for Google\u2019s behavior. He could force the company to change the way it runs its search business \u2014 or order it to sell off parts of that business. The opinion could be appealed, of course, and the final verdict may differ significantly, as happened with Microsoft\u2019s famed antitrust case in the dot-com era.\nIn that case, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft violated antitrust laws and ordered the company to be split into two entities. Microsoft appealed the decision, and an appeals court overturned the breakup order, but Microsoft still had to take certain steps that experts today say might influence Mehta\u2019s behavioral remedies for Google. As part of Microsoft\u2019s settlement, the company had to share its APIs with third-party companies and appoint a panel to monitor its compliance.\nUpdate: This article was originally published August 5 at 12:20 p.m. PT.

      "text": "With a TikTok ban looming in the United States, Perplexity AI is the latest bidder hoping to give the video app a new corporate home.\nCNBC first reported on Perplexity\u2019s interest. A source with knowledge of the offer confirmed to TechCrunch that Perplexity (whose CEO Aravind Srinivas is pictured above) has submitted a bid to merge with TikTok US.\nThe source also confirmed other details about the bid \u2014 that it would create a new entity combining Perplexity, TikTok US, and new equity partners; that most investors in TikTok\u2019s parent company ByteDance would be able to retain their equity; and that by merging, Perplexity hopes to bring more video to its AI search engine.\nA law requiring ByteDance to either sell TikTok or see it banned in the U.S. is set to take effect on Sunday, January 19. That will be President Joe Biden\u2019s last day in office, and officials from his administration have said that it will leave the actual implementation of the ban \u201cto the next administration.\u201d\nMeanwhile, President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated on Monday, said he would \u201cmost likely\u201d give TikTok a 90-day extension, and TikTok\u2019s CEO posted a video thanking Trump for his efforts.\nHowever, TikTok said that without more explicit assurances of non-enforcement from the Biden administration, it will be \u201cforced to go dark\u201d on Sunday.\nDespite a number of buyers expressing interest in TikTok, ByteDance has said repeatedly that it does not intend to sell. (The company described a report that the Chinese government is open to an acquisition by Elon Musk as \u201cpure fiction.\u201d) CNBC reports that Perplexity is hoping it can overcome those reservations by proposing a merger rather than a sale.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

      "text": "A federal judge has found that Google violated antitrust laws by \u201cwillfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power\u201d in the advertising technology market, rounding out a two-year saga after the U.S. and eight states filed its initial complaints against the Alphabet-owned company.\nThe court will set a briefing schedule and hearing date to determine appropriate remedies for the antitrust violations, per a Thursday filing.\nThe remedies could include forcing Google to break up its advertising business, like selling its Google Ad Manager, which includes the AdX ad exchange and DFP (DoubleClick for Publishers), the ad server used for publishers.\nOr the courts could force behavioral remedies that would allow Google to keep its business intact, but would impose restrictions to ensure fair competition, like prohibiting Google from prioritizing its own exchange or demand in auctions.\nIn a separate antitrust case, another federal judge last year found that Google illegally monopolized the general internet search market. The judge has not yet issued remedies on that case, but is expected to do so in mid-2025.\nIn the adtech case, Judge Leonie M. Brinkema wrote in her memorandum opinion that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the \u201copen-web display advertiser ad networks\u201d are a relevant market where Google has monopoly power. These networks help advertisers buy display ads across the open web, so they\u2019re outside of closed ecosystems like Facebook, Instagram, and Google Search.\nThe judge did agree that Google violated the Sherman Act by monopolizing and unlawfully tying two parts of the adtech stack together, specifically DFP and AdX, and that Google is guilty of abuse of monopoly power in the publisher-side adtech.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

We disagree with the Court\u2019s decision regarding our publisher tools. Publishers have many options and they choose Google because our ad tech tools are simple, affordable and effective.\u201d\nThe Department of Justice \u2013 alongside California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Virginia \u2013 filed suit against Google\u2019s alleged use of monopoly power over the digital ad market in January 2023.\nThe DOJ argued that Google achieved its monopoly through anti-competitive conduct when it purchased DoubleClick in 2008, which then became the backbone of its ad business. Google then bought AdMeld in 2011 to gain more control over the ad market\u2019s supply side. The government says this allowed Google to hike up ad prices and harm publishers by taking larger cuts of each sale.\nThe trial for this case began in September 2024 and lasted for three weeks, with closing arguments presented in late November.\nThis article has been updated to include more background about the case."

      "text": "The U.S. Department of Justice is still calling for Google to sell its web browser Chrome, according to a Friday court filing.\nThe DOJ first proposed that Google should sell Chrome last year, under then-President Joe Biden, and it seems to be sticking with that plan under the second Trump administration. The department is, however, no longer calling for the company to divest all its investments in artificial intelligence, including the billions Google has poured into Anthropic.\n\u201cGoogle\u2019s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that \u2014 no matter what occurs \u2014 Google always wins,\u201d the DOJ said in a filing signed by Omeed Assefi, its current acting attorney general for antitrust. (Trump\u2019s nominee to lead antitrust for the DOJ still awaits confirmation.)\nFor that reason, the DOJ said it hasn\u2019t changed the \u201ccore components\u201d of its initial proposal, including the divestment of Chrome and a prohibition on search-related payments to distribution partners.\nOn AI, the DOJ said it\u2019s no longer calling for \u201cthe mandatory divestiture of Google\u2019s AI investments\u201d and will instead be satisfied with \u201cprior notification for future investments.\u201d It also said that instead of giving Google the option to divest Android now, it will leave a future decision up to the court, depending on whether the market becomes more competitive.\nThis proposal follows antitrust suits filed by the DOJ and 38 state attorneys general, leading Judge Amit P. Mehta to rule that Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search. Google has said it will appeal Mehta\u2019s decision, but in the meantime offered an alternative proposal that it said would address his concerns by providing partners with more flexibility.\nA Google spokesperson told Reuters that the DOJ\u2019s \u201csweeping proposals continue to go miles beyond the Court\u2019s decision, and would harm America\u2019s consumers, economy and national security.\u201d\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda.

      "text": "In This Article:\nBy Akash Sriram\n(Reuters) -Perplexity AI made a $34.5 billion unsolicited all-cash offer for Alphabet's Chrome browser on Tuesday, a bid far above its own valuation as the startup reaches for the browser's billions of users pivotal to the AI search race.\nRun by Aravind Srinivas, Perplexity is no stranger to headline-grabbing offers: it made a similar one for TikTok US in January, offering to merge with the popular short-video app to resolve U.S. concerns about TikTok's Chinese ownership.\nOpenAI, Yahoo and private-equity firm Apollo Global Management have also expressed interest in Chrome as regulatory pressure threatens Google's grip on the industry.\nGoogle did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. The company has not offered Chrome for sale and plans to appeal a U.S. court ruling last year that found it held an unlawful monopoly in online search. The Justice Department has sought a Chrome divestiture as part of the case's remedies.\nPerplexity did not disclose on Tuesday how it plans to fund the offer. The three-year-old company has raised around $1 billion in funding so far from investors including Nvidia and Japan's SoftBank. It was last valued at $14 billion.\nMultiple funds have offered to finance the deal in full, Perplexity said, without naming the funds. Alphabet's shares were up 1.6% in afternoon trading.\nAs a new generation of users turns to chatbots such as ChatGPT and Perplexity for answers, web browsers are regaining prominence as vital gateways to search traffic and prized user data, making them central to Big Tech's AI ambitions.\nPerplexity already has an AI browser, Comet, that can perform certain tasks on a user's behalf and buying Chrome would allow it to tap the browser's more than three billion users, giving it the heft to better compete with bigger rivals such as OpenAI. The ChatGPT parent is also working on its own AI browser.\nPerplexity's bid pledges to keep the underlying browser code called Chromium open source, invest $3 billion over two years and make no changes to Chrome's default search engine, according to a term sheet seen by Reuters.\nThe company said the offer, with no equity component, would preserve user choice and ease future competition concerns.\nAnalysts have said Google would be unlikely to sell Chrome and would likely engage in a long legal fight to prevent that outcome, given it is crucial to the company's AI push as it rolls out features including AI-generated search summaries, known as Overviews, to help defend its search market share."

But I pushed myself to go to an English-speaking university, and that opened up a door. Then I chose to work for McKinsey, because I thought it would open another door and maybe I\u2019d get a chance to work overseas. I was reading about what was happening in Silicon Valley in the mid 90s, before I came to the U.S. Already, I\u2019m starting to see the beginnings of the internet. Did I fathom how big it would be? Absolutely not. I didn\u2019t know what venture capital was. I didn\u2019t know that I would join a startup. I just had an intuition that I needed to be here. A friend of mine introduced me to Elon in 1999 and I joined PayPal. Then when Mike Moritz asked me to come interview at Sequoia, that was just another door opening. Where might this one lead? Whenever I interview people, I ask about those key moments in somebody\u2019s life where they\u2019ve made career decisions. And I think about companies in the same way\u2014there are these crucible moments that have an enormous bearing on ultimate outcomes.\nRoelof's Sessions\nWhat Sequoia Sees Coming Next\nAs one of the most influential VCs of the modern era, Roelof Botha has seen it all; booms, busts, and billion-dollar breakout bets.

This bid follows a ruling by a U.S. District Court that found Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, prompting the Department of Justice to propose the divestiture of Chrome. Perplexity's offer is significantly higher than its current valuation, reflecting the browser's dominance in the market, while Google plans to appeal the court's decision.",
