  "content": "Star Trek\u2019s fictional Dr. \u201cBones\u201d McCoy may have had a tricorder, but NASA astronauts could soon have something almost as futuristic and real: An artificial intelligence (AI)-powered medical assistant that can diagnose and help treat illnesses millions of miles from Earth.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nGoogle and NASA are testing the \u201cCrew Medical Officer Digital Assistant,\u201d an AI-powered system to help astronauts with their healthcare needs during extended space missions to the moon, Mars or even farther out, according to a Aug. 7 Google blog post. Such long-range missions can experience a lag in communications with those on Earth.\n\n\u201cCurrently, low Earth orbit missions such as those to the International Space Station have frequent and relatively robust connectivity to allow for close collaboration with ground-based support teams,\u201d David Cruley, customer engineer of Google Cloud Platform, told PYMNTS. \u201cHowever, as distance from the Earth increases, so will latency and communication gaps.\u201d\n\nThe communication lag can be as long as 22 minutes one-way on a mission to Mars, according to an April report from NASA, \u201cAssessment of the State of Communication Delay Research in Preparation for Missions Beyond Low Earth Orbit.\u201d Missions to the moon can experience latencies of three to 14 seconds one-way, but Mars missions can have up to a 22-minute one-way delay or 44 minutes round-trip.\n\nSince every second counts in a medical emergency, the AI doctor steps into the gap while the crew waits for connectivity to catch up.\n\nWhile there will be a human medical officer on board the spacecraft, Cruley said more information and support might be needed in diagnosing medical issues, especially for longer-range space missions. Moreover, if the medical officer is the one with the health problem, the rest of the crew would need help from the AI-powered doctor.\n\nThis development comes at a time when NASA is preparing for a new stage of space missions, starting with the Artemis campaign to set up its first long-term presence on the moon. The space agency said on its website that an exploration of the moon will yield scientific discovery, technology advancement and lessons on living and working \u201con another world as we prepare for human missions to Mars.\u201d\n\nGoogle and NASA said on the Google post they are currently in the initial phases of testing the AI space doctor. It has undergone preliminary trials in which a panel consisting of doctors and an astronaut evaluated its performance in simulated medical scenarios, Cruley told PYMNTS.\n\n\u201cThe next step is to continue testing the model with medical doctors to enhance its accuracy and reliability,\u201d he added.\n\nThe AI doctor is trained on spaceflight data and uses natural language processing and machine learning to give astronauts timely, data-driven guidance for managing medical issues during missions.\n\nThe model\u2019s performance is measured using what\u2019s called the Objective Structured Clinical Examination, according to Google. This exam is used to assess the skills of medical students and professionals, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nInitial results show the AI could deliver \u201creliable\u201d diagnoses based on reported symptoms, according to Google. The company and NASA are now working with medical experts to refine the system\u2019s accuracy and decision-making.\n\nCruley says there\u2019s no launch date yet for the AI space doctor. But while the project\u2019s primary mission is to support astronauts, its potential reach is much broader.\n\n\u201cThe idea of an AI Digital Health Assistant is portable to Earth-based applications,\u201d Cruley said. \u201cLessons learned could be applied to providing quality medical care in remote or underserved areas with limited access to healthcare professionals.\u201d",

      "text": "How Google and NASA are testing AI for medical care in space\nJim Kelly\nVice President, Federal Sales - Public Sector\nAs NASA embarks on a new era of human spaceflight, beginning with the Artemis campaign's aim to return to the Moon, preparations are underway to ensure crew health and wellness. This includes exploring whether remote care capabilities can deliver detailed diagnoses and treatment options if a physician is not onboard or if real-time communication with Earth is limited. Supporting crew health through space-based medical care is becoming increasingly important as NASA missions venture deeper into space.\nTo address this challenge, Google and NASA collaborated on an innovative proof-of-concept for an automated Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) known as the \"Crew Medical Officer Digital Assistant\" (CMO-DA). Designed to assist astronauts with medical help during extended space missions, this multi-modal interface leverages AI. The goal is to potentially support human exploration of the Moon, Mars, and beyond.\nThe CMO-DA tool could help astronauts autonomously diagnose and treat symptoms when crews are not in direct contact with Earth-based medical experts. Trained on spaceflight literature, the AI system uses cutting-edge natural language processing and machine learning techniques to safely provide real-time analyses of crew health and performance. The tool is designed to support a designated crew medical officer or flight surgeon in maintaining crew health and making medical decisions driven by data and predictive analytics.\nInitial trials tested CMO-DA on a wide range of medical scenarios. Outputs were measured using the Objective Structured Clinical Examination framework, a tool used to evaluate the clinical skills of medical students and working healthcare professionals. Early results showed promise for reliable diagnoses based on reported symptoms. Google and NASA are now collaborating with medical doctors to test and refine the model, aiming to enhance autonomous crew health and performance during future space exploration missions.\nThis innovative system isn't just about supporting space exploration; it's about pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI to provide essential care in the most remote and demanding environments. This tool represents an important milestone for AI assisted medical care and our continued exploration of the cosmos. It holds potential for advancing space missions and could also benefit people here on Earth by providing early access to quality medical care in remote areas.\nAt Google Public Sector, we\u2019re passionate about supporting your mission.
