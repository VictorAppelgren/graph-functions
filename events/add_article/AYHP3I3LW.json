      "summary": "Faruqi & Faruqi LLP is pursuing a federal securities class action against Charter Communications, alleging the company misled investors about the impact of ending the Affordable Connectivity Program and the resulting decline in internet customers and revenue. The firm urges investors who suffered losses over $100,000 between July 26, 2024 and July 24, 2025 to contact partner Josh Wilson for legal options, noting a deadline of October 13, 2025 to become lead plaintiff. Charter’s Q2 2025 earnings revealed a significant drop in customers and a 18.5% fall in stock price, underscoring the alleged misstatements. The firm invites whistleblowers, former employees, and shareholders to provide information on the alleged misconduct.",
