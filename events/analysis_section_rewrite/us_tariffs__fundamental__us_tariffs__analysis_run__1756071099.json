      "feedback": "This draft would become world-class with a disciplined, regime-based framing, explicit first-principles anchors, and precise, source-backed quantification; currently it reads as a narrative overlay of events rather than a multi-year, invariant framework. Actionable edits: (1) Build a multi-year regime map anchored in first-principles: define regimes (e.g., open-growth with selective protectionism; deregulation-driven reform; tariff-driven re-pricing with policy-instrument mix; subsidy/equity-based industrial policy) and state-transition conditions (court rulings, CRA/DOGE-like deregulatory moves, congressional action, tariff implementation timelines) with explicit baselines and regime probabilities; (2) Translate the causal chain into a clear transmission mechanism: tariff pass-through to consumer prices and business costs, inflation impulse and margin re-pricing (use Yale Budget Lab figures ~1.8% short-term price rise and $2,400 per household impact; also reference 18.6% average tariff level post-change); deregulation steps altering investment appetite and capital allocation (Intel CHIPS subsidy equity stake as governance risk premium); cross-border frictions feeding into supplier costs (Japan anti-dumping probe) and global pricing; (3) Quantify and bracket key numbers from sources: fix a central base-case tariff ~15% on most EU goods with EU car exemption and steel-quota pending, acknowledge 18.6% average tariff across partners, $750B energy purchases and $600B investments in the EU framework, Adyen’s H1 metrics as a domestic payments/logistics backdrop, and the Intel/chips-context for policy risk; present ranges (e.g., tariff pass-through 1–3% headline CPI, commodity/steel-price effects if anti-dumping actions expand) and attach sources (RHFWI02JT for tariff framework; 2SJORBV6H for Japan steel-probe; QRX2HD4X0 for embedded-finance backdrop; 5M9M1KACF for Intel subsidy/equity angle; 9W8ZUIBDY for competition-order/deregulation arc); (4) Strengthen base case and scenarios: spell out a base-case 3–5 year path with inflation at x–y% (grounded by cited pass-through), GDP growth modestly positive but volatile, and external balances under pressure if tariffs escalate; add upside/downside scenarios with triggers (court rulings overturn tariffs, CRA reversals, new subsidies, or broader protectionist cycles) and invalidate paths if triggers fail; (5) Clarify triggers and invalidation: list concrete catalysts (court outcomes on emergency tariffs; CRA resolutions overturning Biden-era rules; Supreme Court or appeals on tariff legality) and their timing; (6) Reconcile conflicts across sources by presenting a central, evidence-based base-case and a transparent belt of sensitivity bands; explicitly note where numbers differ (e.g., 15% tariff framework vs. Yale/AP inflation implications) and why you bracket them; (7) Improve SECTION FOCUS alignment by delivering a formal horizon narrative (base case, risks, what to watch, confidence) and a concise regime-transition chart, not a paragraph-long causal sweep; (8) Tighten citation discipline: after each factual claim tied to a source, append only the source ID(s) in parentheses (e.g., (RHFWI02JT); (2SJORBV6H); (QRX2HD4X0); (5M9M1KACF); (9W8ZUIBDY)); (9) Reduce hedging and generic language; replace with crisp, decision-relevant statements and a short, quantitative verdict on confidence; (10) Reorganize the write-up into a base-case narrative plus a short watchlist (6–12 months) and a risk matrix; (11) Ensure all critical sources are covered (EU framework depth from RHFWI02JT, AP/CSR on consumer-price pass-through, regulatory-deregulation arc from 9W8ZUIBDY and 5M9M1KACF, Japan anti-dumping from 2SJORBV6H, Adyen context from QRX2HD4X0) and reconcile any tensions between them rather than treating them as independent data points.",
