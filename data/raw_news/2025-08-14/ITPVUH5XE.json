  "content": "As laptop clashes go, they don't get much bigger than Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch vs Dell 14 Premium. These two premium devices are both among the best laptops and come in at similar prices \u2013 but which should you buy?\n\nThe Dell 14 Premium is the successor to the very popular Dell XPS 14, and while it doesn't change much from its XPS pedigree, it does have some new hardware under the lid that makes it more powerful than its predecessor.\n\nThe Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch, meanwhile, consistently ranks as the best laptop for creatives owing to its powerful hardware, sleek design, longevity, and accessible price.\n\nChoosing between them is no easy task, but I've spent days testing the two laptops to answer this very question. Read on to learn the pros and cons of each device and look at the data I've collected to see which one is right for your needs and budget.\n\nThe Dell 14 Premium and Apple MacBook Pro 14 are priced in the same ballpark, but the Dell has a slight advantage here. It starts at $1,499.99 / \u00a31,499 / AU$2,798.40, while the Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) is $100/\u00a3100 more at $1,599 / \u00a31,599 / AU$2,499.\n\nAs you move up the spec stack, the Dell 14 Premium maintains its pricing advantage, with the highest-spec 14 Premium configuration coming in at $2,399.99 / \u00a32,364.59 / AU$4,207.50, while the MacBook Pro 14-inch's top spec configuration with an M4 chip comes in at $2,599 / \u00a32,749 / AU$4,229.\n\nIf you opt for M4 Pro or M4 Max chips, then the price of the MacBook Pro 14-inch will be much higher, and at that point it is really competing with the Dell Pro 14 Premium and Dell Pro Max 14 Premium, not the Dell 14 Premium.\n\nI've left those models out of this comparison and just focused on the base machines \u2013 and in this category the Dell just pips the MacBook.\n\nIn terms of specs, it's a bit difficult to directly compare the Dell 14 Premium to the Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch, since Dell actually has three different lines that could go up against it, depending on which Apple M4-series chip you configure it with.\n\nStarting out, though, the Dell 14 Premium stacks up fairly well against the base configuration of the MacBook Pro 14-inch.\n\nThere is one major area where the MacBook Pro 14 totally outclasses the base-spec 14 Premium, though: its display.\n\nUnlike the 14 Premium, the MacBook Pro 14-inch uses the same mini-LED liquid retina XDR display for every configuration, so it's going to look great right out the gate, while you'll have to pay extra to upgrade to an OLED panel for the 14 Premium.\n\nLike I said, if you're talking about the top configuration for the MacBook Pro 14-inch, you can configure it with the much more powerful M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, and those are not really comparable to the Dell 14 Premium. For those chip configurations, you'll need to look at the Dell Pro 14 Premium and Dell Pro Max 14 Premium, respectively.\n\nIf we limit this comparison to MacBook Pro 14-inch with standard M4 chip, though, the top-spec configuration of the 14 Premium definitely has the advantage thanks to its discrete Nvidia RTX 4050 GPU. That is much more powerful than anything you'll get with Apple's integrated gaphics.\n\nWhen it comes to the design of these laptops, the Dell 14 Premium and Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch both have plenty of things going for them \u2013 and interestingly enough, where they stumble, both do so in exactly the same ways in a couple of key areas.\n\nThe 14 Premium retains much of the same aesthetics as the previous-gen XPS 14, including the borderless trackpad and virtual function keys, which aren't great for accessibility.\n\nThe laptop itself is well-built and sleek, if a bit boring, and it is only slightly heavier than the MacBook Pro 14-inch, though it is still very portable.\n\nThe MacBook Pro 14-inch, meanwhile, is also little changed from its M3 model, but it is still an iconic-looking laptop, and its design is certainly one of its biggest draws.\n\nIts keyboard and trackpad also have a better feeling in use than those on the Dell 14 Premium, and even though the Dell machine's OLED panel is more than a match for the MacBook Pro's mini-LED display, the base-spec 14 Premium will not look nearly as nice as the MacBook.\n\nThe biggest gripes I have about the 14 Premium beyond the accessibility issues with the trackpad and function keys are its rather boring color options and the lack of a privacy shutter for its webcam.\n\nThese complaints equally apply to the MacBook Pro 14-inch, which might have made this category a tie were it not for the MacBook's superior trackpad and function keys and its slightly better overall design. As it is, I have to give this one to the Apple device.\n\nComparing performance is a bit tricky with these two devices, since the two units I had on hand to test aren't exactly equivalent (the Dell 14 Premium has twice as much RAM and SSD storage).\n\nThat said, the two devices I tested are close enough that I feel comfortable making some direct comparisons, especially in tests where RAM and storage capacity don't really affect the final result, such as direct CPU and GPU benchmarking.\n\nNote that each of the charts below features multiple benchmarks which you can switch between via the drop-down arrows. To get the full picture, you'll want to look at them all.\n\nOn the CPU side of things, the Apple M4 chip overpowers the Intel Core Ultra 7 255H in the Dell 14 Premium, especially in single-core performance, which drives a number of high-intensity apps such as Adobe Photoshop.\n\nThings swing in the Dell 14 Premium's favor when it comes to GPU performance, though, thanks to the discrete Nvidia RTX 4050 GPU.\n\nThe base-spec 14 Premium won't come close to these numbers, seeing as it uses integrated Intel Arc graphics, but the upgrade to the RTX 4050 is highly recommended, even if you don't go with an OLED display.\n\nTechnically, both laptops use PCIe 4.0 SSD storage, but the MacBook Pro 14-inch's SSD is a lot slower than the 14 Premium's.\n\nThe 14 Premium's read speeds mean that the laptop will start up faster, apps will load more quickly, and opening large files will feel noticeably faster. The write speeds for both laptops are close enough that you likely wouldn't notice much difference in real world use.\n\nBoth of these laptops are good for creative pros, though in different ways. If you plan on doing a lot of 3D modeling work, the Nvidia RTX 4050 GPU offers substantially better performance in this regard, but if you are looking to do some serious video or photography work, the MacBook Pro 14-inch is going to give you noticeably better performance.\n\nTurning to gaming, neither of these are making any best gaming laptop lists any time soon, but the RTX 4050 GPU combined with nearly every PC game treating Windows as its target platform puts the Dell 14 Premium well ahead of the MacBook Pro 14-inch in this regard.\n\nGiven how each laptop has its strengths and weaknesses, it's hard to come down and declare a clear winner here. It's really going to be a matter of which workload you expect to focus on, so all I can really do is call it a tie.\n\nI can't speak directly to the battery life of the base-spec Dell 14 Premium, which might be substantially better than what I got in my testing with the top-spec configuration \u2013 but I think it's safe to say that the MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4 will walk away with this category.\n\nIn our standardized battery life testing, the Dell managed just over 8hrs, while the MacBook lasted for more than 18 hours. That's a phenomenal performance and a real mark in its favor.\n\nSure, if you choose a different spec for the Dell the numbers above might improve a little, but really it's only a matter of how badly the 14 Premium gets beaten.\n\nIf you take all of my benchmark scores and average them all out to get a final tally, the Dell 14 Premium comes out ahead purely on the strength of the discrete RTX 4050 GPU. If you opt for the Intel integrated graphics option, things might turn out quite differently.\n\nIn either case, the MacBook Pro 14-inch has some other non-quantifiable factors in its column, including a better design. And of course there's that battery life. For a laptop like this, which is meant to be used on the go, the fact that it lasts for a substantially longer time needs to be weighted a bit more heavily in the final average.\n\nWith that in mind, I'm inclined to call it a draw between the Dell 14 Premium vs Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch. Both are noticeably better in different use cases, so depending on what you need your laptop for, things can go either way.\n\nIf gaming and 3D modeling are important to you, go with Dell. If you're a video editor or photographer, or if you need seriously long battery life, go with Apple.\n\nYou might also like...\n\u2022 Dell 14 Premium review: still contending with Apple's best\n\u2022 Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) review: one of the best Pro laptops around",

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 is a pro-grade portable that impresses in every area. It's a pleasure to use, and rises to meet virtually any challenge. It joins Apple's pantheon of excellent laptops, and will duly take its place at or near the top of our best laptops list.\nPros\n- +\nM4\n- +\nNano-texture screen\n- +\nCenterstage camera\n- +\nExcellent design\nCons\n- -\nNo design updates\n- -\nNo Wi-Fi 7\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024) : Two-minute review\nApple's MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 is the full package, a near-perfect blend of price, performance, and utility. The M4 is the base edition of the newest and most powerful generation of Apple silicon (it's the same chip that's already running in the iPad Pro 13-inch) but it's still bursting with power, and more than capable of doing most of the heavy-lifting you want from a pro-level portable machine, as ready to edit raw photos and 4K video as it is to stand in as an able gaming console.\nI've long been a fan of the MacBook Pro design, especially since Apple refined it by removing the Touch Bar, a neat innovation that never reached its full potential. My M4 Pro review unit, supplied by Apple, is a sleek-looking Space Black that's both elegant and wonderfully functional. The Magic Keyboard is still a typing gem, and I love the massive trackpad and all that space for resting my hands. And the stereo speakers that straddle the keyboard deliver powerful, crisp, and clear audio that could provide the soundtrack for your party in a pinch.\nWhen I think about the reasons why you'd buy an M4 14-inch Mac Pro over the cheaper M3-running MacBook Air, the list is smaller than when I've compared the Pro and Air options previously, but there are a handful of standout features that make this MacBook Pro 14 M4 (2024) a near-perfect choice.\nFor starters, you have the ports. Where the Air tops out at a Thunderbolt 3 port, you get a trio of speedy Thunderbolt 4 ports with the MacBook Pro (you'll need to upgrade to the M4 Pro model for Thunderbolt 5). You also gain the SD card slot, an instant bonus for photo and video professionals. The larger body and ever-efficient 3-nanometer system-on-a-chip (SoC) means a promised 24 hours of battery life \u2013 for a Pro-level system, that's unheard of. Naturally, real-world usage times varied widely in my testing based on activity (AAA gaming can quickly eat up battery).\nThe biggest difference between Air and Pro might be the display. This Liquid Retina XDR is an inch larger than the MacBook Air's, and it offers a nano-texture option (an extra $150 / \u00a3150 / AU$230), something I highly recommend for cutting down on reflections in almost any situation.\nWith the MacBook Pro 14-inch M4, Apple has created a pro-grade portable that impresses in every respect. It joins Apple's pantheon of outstanding laptops, and is set to take a well-deserved place at or near the top of our best laptops rankings.\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024) review: Price and availability\n- Starts at $1,599 / \u00a32,149 / AU$3,199\n- Nano-texture (which you want) will run you another $150 / \u00a3150 / AU$230\nApple unveiled the M4 MacBook Pro 14-inch on October 30, along with the new MacBook Pro 16-inch, Mac mini, and iMac. All these new Macs are running variations of Apple's M4 silicon.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nPricing for the M4 MacBook Pro 14-inch starts at $1,599 / \u00a31,599 / AU$2,499 for the base configuration, which comes with the standard M4 chip and 16GB of unified memory. If you want the M4 Pro chip, pricing starts at $1,999 / \u00a31,999 / AU$3,299, while the M4 Max model starts at $2,399 / \u00a32,399 / AU$3,999.\nMy Space Black review unit is the base model (10-core M4, 16GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage) but with one key enhancement: the aforementioned nano-texture Liquid Retina XDR display coating, which costs an extra $150 / \u00a3150 / AU$230.\n- Value score: 4/5\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024) review: Specs\nThe MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024) comes in three main configurations: our test unit, the base M4; a pair featuring the M4 Pro chip with options of 16- or 20-core GPU and up to 1TB storage; and at the high end, the M4 Max model, which offers one configuration with a 14-core CPU, 32-core GPU, 32GB of unified memory, and 1TB of SSD.\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | MacBook Pro M4 Pro 512GB | MacBook Pro M4 Pro 1TB |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice: | $1,599 / \u00a31,599 / AU$2,499 | $1,799 / \u00a31,999 / AU$3,299 |\nCPU: | Apple M4 Pro (10-core) | Apple M4 Pro (10-core) |\nGraphics: | Integrated 16-core GPU | Integrated 16-core GPU |\nRAM: | 16GB unified memory | 16GB unified memory |\nScreen: | 14.2-inch, 3024 x 1964 Liquid Retina XDR display (mini-LED, 1,000 nits sustained brightness, wide color P3 gamut, ProMotion technology) with Nano-texture | 14.2-inch, 3024 x 1964 Liquid Retina XDR display (mini-LED, 1,000 nits sustained brightness, wide color P3 gamut, ProMotion technology) |\nStorage: | 512 SSD | 1TB SSD |\nPorts: | 3x Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C), HDMI, SDXC card slot, 3.5mm headphone jack, MagSafe 3 | 3x Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C), HDMI, SDXC card slot, 3.5mm headphone jack, MagSafe 3 |\nWireless: | Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.3 | Wi-Fi 6E (802.11ax), Bluetooth 5.3 |\nCamera: | 12MP Centerstage Camera (Desk View support) 1080p FaceTime HD webcam | 12MP Centerstage Camera (Desk View support) 1080p FaceTime HD webcam |\nWeight: | 3.4 lbs (1.6kg) | 3.5 lbs (1.6kg) |\nDimensions: | 12.31 x 8.71 x 0.61 inches (313 x 221 x 16mm) | 12.31 x 8.71 x 0.61 inches (313 x 221 x 16mm) |\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024) review: Design\n- Virtually the same design as the previous model\n- All the key ports you need\n- Fantastic screen\nOver the last few years I've become an unabashed fan of Apple's increasingly iconic laptop design. Where competitors often try different and sometimes odd design flourishes, Apple carefully peeled away all but what matters, leaving a MacBook Pro that looks and feels as if it was carved from a couple of pieces of 100% recycled black aluminum. Nothing feels like, or works like, it was left to chance. That impression starts when you put your finger under the lip of the display and flip open the clamshell to reveal the screen and keyboard. That hinge is as sure as it gets, offering the perfect blend of tension and smooth movement.\nAt 3.4lbs / 1.55kg, the MacBook Pro 14 M4 is not the lightest laptop or even the lightest MacBook. The excellent MacBook Air holds that distinction, and if you prize portability over power you might be reading the wrong review. On the other hand, the MacBook Pro 14 is by no means heavy (the 16-inch MacBook Pro, by contrast, weighs nearly 5lbs / 2.27kg).\nFolded close, the MacBook Pro 14 is just 0.61 inches tall, 12.3 inches wide, and 8.71 inches deep. It slips into my backpack and, even though I'm used to carrying the M3 MacBook Air, I mostly forget it's there.\nApple hasn't adjusted the ports since the M2 MacBook Pro, which is fine with me. We still have the HDMI-out port if you want to extend your display to a giant, high-resolution screen. Next to that is one of the three Thunderbolt 4 ports and an SD card slot, which I used to transfer some raw images from my DSLR. On the opposite side is the MagSafe charge port, two Thunderbolt 4 (40Gb/s) ports, and the 3.5mm headphone, although I generally connect my AirPods Pros 2 for audio. If you need Thunderbolt 5's 120Gb/s throughput speeds you'll want to upgrade to an M4 Pro chip.\nThe full-sized backlit Magic Keyboard is a pleasure to use (I'm composing this review on it), with ample travel and a satisfying typing feel. It includes the arrow keys and a full line of function keys. On the right side of that is the Touch ID power and sleep button. During setup, it took me a few moments to register my index finger which I now use to unlock the laptop and log into some online services. Below the keyboard is the massive, nearly 6-inch diagonal, and very responsive Forcetouch trackpad.\nOne of the benefits of a larger laptop is that Apple can fit a pair of speaker grilles on either side of the keyboard. They provide fantastic sound, especially when playing spatial audio (try Territory on Netflix).\nThe system features a pair of four-inch vents, one on each side. You usually won't hear the fan until you play AAA games or run benchmarks.\n- Design score: 5/5\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024) review: Display\n- It's gorgeous\n- Better brightness for SDR\n- The coating you want\nWhile it might look like Apple left the Liquid Retina XDR display from the M2 MacBook Pro untouched, there are a couple of noteworthy differences. But let's start with what's the same.\nIt's still the same mini-LED technology offering a 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio and one billion colors with a P3 wide color and ProMotion with up to 120Hz refresh rate. The resolution is still nearly 4K at 3096 x 1964 pixels. However, Apple has boosted the brightness a bit, with SDR content now getting up to 1,000 nits. HDR still gets a peak brightness of 1600. These numbers primarily matter outdoors, where you might be battling back the sunshine, and I found that the display was quite effective at remaining viewable and usable in direct sunlight. I attribute this, however, only in part to the heightened SDR nit capabilities.\nMy screen came with the optional nano-texture coating. This adds a fine texture across the entire screen that's meant to diffuse direct sunlight (the MacBook Pro comes with a special cloth for cleaning the screen). It costs an extra $150 / \u00a3150 / AU$230, but it's transformative technology. Not only does it effectively kill outdoor reflections, it also transforms how streaming and gaming content looks on the display. No more desk and overhead lamp bulbs peaking into the frame. No more window light killing your gaming groove. I honestly wonder why all laptops, Macs and otherwise, do not come with this texture. It's a game-changer.\nThe 14.2-inch screen is big enough for lots of side-by-side app work. It's the perfect canvas for photo editing in Adobe Lightroom and video work in FinalCut Pro. but is also well suited to lighter productivity (like my efforts to write this review), email, and web browsing. It's not a touch screen because Apple refuses to bring that technology to Macs, even as the touch-friendly iPad Pro becomes more and more Mac-like. The trackpad is large enough that I don't miss touching a screen (as I did for years for Microsoft Surface Pro) but I can't help but wonder how a MacBook Pro with a touch, and Apple Pencil-friendly, display would alter the way we use this laptop.\nThe other display change relates less to what you'll see on the Liquid Retina XDR panel and more to how others will see you through it. Apple has upgraded the FaceTime camera, which sits at the top of the display in a cutout notch, with a 12MP ultrawide that supports its Center Stage technology. Center Stage takes the full 12MP ultrawide frame and narrows the viewport so that you are always centered in the frame. It doesn't matter if you lean left or right or get up and walk around the room, Center Stage will follow. It's a useful feature in FaceTime \u2013 I tested it on a call with my wife who wondered why I kept moving around \u2013 and also on Zoom, where it worked well but was not useful in a broadcast video situation, so I turned it off. Center Stage did not work for me in Google Meet, where I conduct most of my video meetings.\n- Display score: 4.5/5\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024) review: Performance\n- M4 has the Pro power most need\n- macOS Sequoia is flexible and easy to use\n- AAA gaming on a Mac is real\nHere\u2019s how the MacBook Pro 14-inch (2024) performed in our suite of TechRadar and Future Labs benchmark tests:\nCinebench R23 CPU: Single-Core: 2,180 Multi-Core: 13773\nGeekbench 6.3 Single-Core: 3,845; Multi-Core: 15,136\nGeekbench AI: Single: 4,764 Half Precision: 7,837 ; Quantized Score: 6.357\nPugentBench Photoshop: 10,542\nPugentBench Premier Pro: 4,618\nBlender: Monster: 115.8; Junkshop: 73.17; Classroom: 188.1\nBattery Life (web site surfing rundown): 18 hours and 31 minutes\nThe last time we reviewed a 14-inch MacBook Pro, it was running an M2 Pro. The base M4 inside my test unit has similar but not equal specs. It's still a 10-core CPU, but where the M2 Pro had a 16-core GPU, the M4 starts with 10 cores. However the M2 chips were all built on a 5-nanometer process, and the M4 line is on the more efficient three nanometers, which could lead to a better combination of power and efficiency.\nThe Neural Engine, which handles a lot of onboard machine learning and AI tasks, still has the same 16 cores.\nApple is now backing all of its new Macs with at least 16GB of RAM. This pays dividends in AI (Apple Intelligence is on board) and graphically intense operations like ray tracing, which helps make games like Lies of P look incredible on the MacBook Pro 14.\nIn benchmark testing, I found the numbers in line with the M4 performance I saw from the iPad Pro 13 inch. Geekbench 6.3 numbers measurably exceed those of the M3 in my MacBook Air.\nWhen I played Shadow of the Tomb Radar, Steam's internal frames per second counter showed I got anywhere between 42fps and 62fps. To my eyes, there was no tearing or dropped frames.\nNumbers only tell you so much, and what matters most is real-world experience. I did do a fair amount of gaming on this MacBook Pro. As I noted above, the nano-texture screen makes games look amazing. In my Lies of P sessions (I connected an X Box controller via Bluetooth), I took note of the rich atmospherics, from rain to fire, and the level of detail that never descended into unwatchable blurs. Gaming on the MacBook Pro benefits from macOS Sequoia's Game Mode, which prioritizes gaming tasks for truly smooth and responsive performance.\nIn FinalCut Pro, I edited four 4K 30fps streams at once, which played back smoothly in full-screen preview. However, when I tried the same thing with four 4K 120fps video clips shot on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, full-screen playback started dropping frames \u2013 an on-screen message confirmed this. It was one of the rare times I found the limits of Apple silicon.\nEditing raw photos in Adobe Lightroom is a breeze. It's also worth noting that I rarely shut down other apps while I performed these operations, and as I noted earlier, the only times I heard the fans were during console-grade gameplay and Cinebench 23 benchmarking.\nKeep in mind that my tests were all with the base M4 Apple silicon; imagine what you can expect from the M4 Pro and M4 Max.\nConnectivity is mostly what you would expect, with support for Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 6E. I am a bit disappointed, though, that Apple didn't future-proof the laptop a bit with Wi-Fi 7 support.\n- Performance score: 5/5\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024) review: Software\n- macOS 15.1\n- Some Apple Intelligence\nmacOS Sequoia (macOS 15.1) has a lot to offer. There's the new Passwords app, which gives you a full-blown application for managing your passwords, and there's the updated Notes, which can now transcribe recordings. It's not as good as the transcription in Voice Recorder on Android (it doesn't identify multiple speakers) but it's still useful.\nThere are now Highlights in Safari that can take a 3,000-word-plus New Yorker article and boil it down to a one-paragraph summary. I worry that loses the nuance of such a piece, but if you're in a hurry...\nThere's also iPhone Mirroring, which lets you access and control your iPhone from the MacBook Pro. It's supposed to be useful when you don't have access to your iPhone (maybe it's just in another room), and I found it easy to connect an iPhone 16 Pro and then have a virtual version of the iPhone on my MacBook Pro 14 desktop. What's even wilder is how I can control the phone from the desktop system. I can message, browse the web, and even drag and drop between the desktop and the iPhone interface. I did notice that while I can open the iPhone camera, I cannot use the MacBook Pro 14 to take a picture with the phone.\nApple Intelligence is here within macOS 15.1, in the form of a redesigned Siri that supports Type to Siri and which can be dragged around the desktop. I found that I could ask Siri how to do things with the MacBook Pro, like find my Wi-Fi settings and opening an app like Notes.\nApple Intelligence puts email summaries at the top of email, and the writing tools are embedded throughout the system. In Notes, I asked the Writing Tools to rewrite my lengthy meeting notes. It did a really good job of boiling it all down to a concise bullet list, which I could also easily undo. This could be very useful.\nThis is not all of Apple Intelligence. There's no Image Playground for instance, but that will show up with macOS 15.2, possibly by early December.\nA taste of AI\nDuring my testing, I did install the macOS 15.2 Developer Beta so that I could get a sample of this MacBook Pro 14 M4's Apple Intelligence capabilities. Because this update is not intended for the public, my thoughts on this dev beta were not considered as part of my final software, performance and overall review score.\nFirst, I was excited to see Clean Up now inside of the Photos app. It works just as it does in iOS 18 on the iPhone, and was useful for removing some unwanted items from my photos.\nChatGPT's Siri integration, which I had to enable, is quite smooth, and looks and works as if it's a part of Siri. I used it in the Type to Siri mode, entering my prompt about how to create a goods presentation. The answer I got from ChatGPT through Siri was solid.\nImage Playground, the generative AI image tool which lives in an adorable kitty app icon in the Dock, is also part of this beta, but it's still gated by an invite and, as I write this, I still await mine.\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024) review: Battery life\n- Rated for 24-hour video streaming\n- Lasted more than 18 hours in our tests\n- Battery life is dependent on activity\nThe MacBook Pro 14 M4 is, according to Apple's promises, perhaps the first truly all-day laptop, rated to last up to 24 hours on a charge. Naturally, that's if you do nothing but stream seasons 1 through 3 of Stranger Things. Once you start adding in activities like web browsing, and emailing, Slack, gaming, and photo and video editing, those numbers change.\nIn our Future Labs tests, we found that we could get 18.5 hours of web browsing, which is two hours more than Apple is promising. Once I started gaming, though, battery life took a fast tumble; the system is clearly hard at work rendering the exquisite detail in Lies of P. I heard the fans going full-blast, and noticed the bottom of the laptop got quite warm. My advice is if you want to use the MacBook Pro 14 M4 as a gaming rig, keep the included 70W charger and woven USB-C to MagSafe cable close by.\nSpeaking of that charger; when I drained the system to zero, I was able to use it to recharge the MacBook Pro 14 M4 to 43% in 30 minutes. That's a bit less than the 50% I was expecting. To fully recharge, it took more than an hour.\nI've had incredible battery experiences with the MacBook Air and its M3 chip. I can already see that, in normal use, the MacBook Pro 14 M4 is a sun-up-to-sun-down kind of system. That's impressive, and a big win for Pro fans.\n- Battery score: 4.5 / 5\nShould you buy the Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch M4 (2024)?\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Good price for more memory and a faster CPU | 4/5 |\nDesign | Virtually the same design as the previous model.

We found performance across the board to be exceptional, whether you're using it for running office apps or video editing. Like most MBPs, it's also available in 14-inch and 16-inch models, and the display remains one of the best you can get on any laptop, period.\nBut in general, if you just need a decent all-rounder, you can't really go wrong with any M-series MacBook Pro (avoid the MacBook Pro Intel laptops, though). Even the older M1 chips are great for productivity and creative workloads.\nIn this round-up, I've included some of the best MacBook and Macs, the best business Mac and MacBook, and best video editing Mac and MacBook that we've reviewed. As part of our testing process, we've benchmarked performance, timed batter lift, and explored the full capabilities of Apple's premiere laptop.\nQuick List\nBest overall\nThe best MacBook Pro overall\nThe MacBook Pro 14-inch with the latest M4-series chips offers outstanding, best-in-class performance while getting fantastic battery life and features the best display of any MacBook ever.\nBest on a budget\nThe best MacBook Pro on a budget\nWith the release of the M4-powered MBP, I'm seeing some great deals on the previous M3 models, and it's still an incredible workstation for Apple fans.\nBest for creators\nThe best MacBook Pro for creators\nPerfect for creative professionals, the MacBook Pro 16-inch with the M4 Pro and M4 Max chips is Apple's most powerful laptop on the market. Expect staggering performance.\nBest M3\nThe best MacBook Pro with M3 chip\nLooking for an M3-powered MacBook Pro? This one comes equipped with the exceptional M3 Pro or M3 Max chip, delivering incredible performance - and that gorgeous display, too.\nBest M2\nThe best MacBook Pro with M2 chip\nThe early-2023 MacBook Pro 14-inch isn't as powerful as the M3-series models released later that same year, but it's still a fantastic performer that you'll likely find on sale.\nBest entry-level\nThe best entry-level MacBook Pro\nThe MacBook Pro 14-inch with M1 Pro might be harder to find than newer models, but if you can find this powerhouse on clearance, it'll be well worth the effort.\nThe best MacBook Pro overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe new MacBook Pro 14in, powered by Apple's M4 chip, particularly the high-end M4 Max processor, is more than just a new laptop; it's a testament to the chip's raw power. The highest-end configurations showcase superior performance due to their additional CPU and GPU cores and large memory capacity (128GB). While the base M4 model still offers advanced features like hardware-based ray tracing, mesh shading, and a fast neural network, it has fewer cores and less memory.\nThis MacBook Pro stands out for its design, including an option for a fingerprint-resistant Space Black finish, a highly praised keyboard, and the macOS Sequoia platform, offering versatility for various activities. It's considered the best MacBook to date.\nIn our experience, the complete MacBook Pro M4 series, from the base model to the M4 Pro and M4 Max, rank among the top laptops available, not just the best MacBook Pro devices, with the M4 Max configuration also a contender for the best gaming laptop list and the best portable workstation due to it's raw power and ability.\nI've opted for the 14-inch version here, as I feel it nicely balances price and performance, but there is a 16-inch model for those who want the larger screen and more configuration options.\nRead our full MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) review\nThe best MacBook Pro on a budget\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFor a cheap MacBook Pro with a modern performance, you can pick up a last-gen model with the M3 processor for a reasonable price. It's not as powerful as the newer (and more expensive) M4 versions, but for everything from office work to video editing, the MacBook Pro 14-inch M3 is still a mighty laptop.\nLike any MacBook Pro, this laptop excels at graphically-intensive work. However, we found it was also very capable at gaming. In common with modern MacBooks, it also boasts one of the best screens on a laptop, with the Liquid Retina Display featuring wide color gamut, True Tone technology, and ProMotion technology providing a 120Hz refresh rate.\nFor an even cheaper MacBook Pro, the M1 and M2 models are still very much worth exploring, however, I'm finding them harder to buy these days unless they're refurbed. These older machines may lack the power of the newer models, but performance is still excellent overall. For a cheap non-Pro version, see our MacBook Air M4 review, a top pick at an excellent price if your needs are more simple.\nRead our full MacBook Pro 14-inch (M3 Max) review\nThe best MacBook Pro for creators\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe MacBook Pro 16, powered by Apple\u2019s M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, takes high-performance laptops to the next level. If you opt for the M4 Max configuration, you\u2019re getting unmatched power - featuring advanced CPU and GPU cores and up to 128GB of unified memory. It\u2019s purpose-built to handle anything you throw at it, from 3D rendering and massive simulations to high-end video editing projects. If you're a creative professional, it's the one to choose.\nThe 16-inch Liquid Retina XDR display is an absolute showstopper. It\u2019s the biggest and brightest display in Apple\u2019s line-up, delivering stunning color accuracy, 1,600 nits of peak brightness, and buttery-smooth ProMotion technology. Whether you\u2019re a creative pro or a multitasking powerhouse, the screen\u2019s spacious layout gives you the room to focus and create like never before.\nAnd let\u2019s talk about the Space Black finish. It\u2019s as stylish as it is functional. Thanks to the fingerprint-resistant anodized coating, it stays clean and sleek no matter how much you use it. If you\u2019re after ultimate performance, versatility, and a laptop that can keep up with your creativity, this is the one to beat.\nSure, the MacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro/Max) doesn\u2019t come cheap, but it\u2019s built for those who demand the best. For a slightly cheaper alternative, the M3 Max model is also worth considering, and scores very high in the performance stakes.\nRead the full Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro) review\nThe best MacBook Pro M3\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nOnce the top-end MacBook Pro, the M3 Max-powered model is still incredibly impressive machine and if you're looking for pure power for slightly less than the M4 Max models, we can't recommend this one enough.\nThe MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3) boasts an exceptional 16.2-inch display with Liquid Retina XDR technology, 1,600 nits peak brightness, and 120Hz ProMotion tech, ensuring a vivid and responsive visual experience. It also features a range of ports for enhanced connectivity.\nThe MacBook Pro is a powerhouse in performance. During our review process, this MBP laptop effortlessly handled intensive tasks like editing 4K footage, and in a major shift, even proved capable of running the latest games. Compared to the M1 Max, our own benchmark tests showed a 35% increase in Geekbench 6 in single core CPU performance, and an increase of 69% in multi-core performance. We also ran our standard battery life test, where the laptop shone, delivering more than 24 hours of life on a single charge. Now that's impressive (although it lasted less when gaming compared to less intensive tasks.\nThe MacBook Pro M3 Max is, admittedly, an expensive device, and not everyone will require the sort of power and performance on offer here. But for those that do, this one gets a strong recommendation.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Max) review\nThe best MacBook Pro M2\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nPowered by the impressive M2 Pro and M2 Max processor, we found this Apple MacBook Pro to provide blistering speeds and buttery smooth running of everything from productivity and office apps to video and photo editing software. Yes, the design is effectively identical to its predecessor, but that bump in specs is noticeable.\nAs usual, build quality is excellent here. It feels robust and durable in hand, and it's a real pleasure using the keyboard and trackpad, too. However, the truly eye-catching thing about this laptop - and, indeed, all the best MacBook Pro devices - is that screen. With its 3024 x 1964 resolution, Liquid Retina XDR display and mini-LED technology, the results are stunning, and during our review, we found it capably delivers vibrant colors and a rich, deep contrast. Elsewhere on the machine, you'll find a fair amount of ports. The selection, which includes three Thunderbolt 4 ports and a HDMI port, should satisfy most users without restriction.\nPerformance-wise, the M2 Pro easily handles heavy workloads - and few will need the absolute power of the M2 Max, although the option is nice to have for, say, professional video editing at high resolutions.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M2 Pro) review\nThe best entry-level MacBook Pro\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe MacBook Pro 14-inch powered by the original M1 chip is still an impressive beast, despite being three model generations behind the current line-up. Even today, it's a stand-out MBP for creative professionals editing images, videos, and running office apps.\nThis model remains a compelling device, especially for those who may find it on clearance. If you can get one powered by Apple's M1 Pro or M1 Max chips, you'll find - as we did - that it outperforms the base Apple M2 processor. The device features a comprehensive array of ports, addressing a common grievance among users of previous generations by eliminating the dependency on dongles and hubs for peripheral connections.\nWith three Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI, SDXC card slot, and MagSafe 3 for charging, it caters adeptly to the needs of professionals requiring a robust mobile workstation for a more modest investment than newer models demand.\nThis MacBook Pro not only boasts superior internal hardware but also introduces an upgraded Liquid Retina XDR display with mini-LED technology, akin to that in the latest iPad Pro, offering an impressive 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio and ProMotion technology for refresh rates up to 120Hz. This ensures stunning visual quality, whether for editing HDR content, scrolling through websites, or engaging in any task that benefits from vibrant colors and fluid motion.\nAdditionally, when we ran our tests, we found battery life extends to 17 hours, a notable feat for a mobile workstation of this caliber, allowing it to maintain performance without throttling to conserve power. Despite its premium pricing at launch, the MacBook Pro 14-inch (M1) remains an unrivaled option for professionals needing exceptional performance and functionality. Its blend of power, design, and utility makes it an excellent investment, particularly if available at a reduced price, underscoring its status as not just an older model, but a timeless piece of technology offering outstanding value.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M1) review\nBest MacBook Pro laptops: Compared\nModel | CPU | GPU | RAM | Screen | Storage | Dimensions |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) | Apple M4 \u2013 M4 Max | Integrated GPU | Up to 128GB | 14-inch Liquid Retina XDR display | Up to 8TB | 12.31 x 8.71 x 1.55 in / 31.26 x 22.12 x 1.55 cm |\nApple MacBook Pro 13-inch (M2) | Apple M2 with 8-core CPU | Integrated 10-core GPU | Up to 24GB | 13.3-inch display, 2560 x 1600 | Up to 2TB | 11.97 x 8.36 x 0.61 in / 30.41 x 21.24 x 1.56 cm |\nApple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro) | Apple M3 Pro \u2013 M3 Max | Integrated GPU | Up to 128GB | 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, 3456 x 2234 | Up to 8TB | 14.01 x 9.77 x .66 in / 35.57 x 24.81 x 1.68 cm |\nApple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M3 Max) | Apple M3 Pro \u2013 M3 Max | Integrated GPU | Up to 128GB | 16.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, 3456 x 2234 | Up to 8TB | 14.01 x 9.77 x .66 in / 35.57 x 24.81 x 1.68 cm |\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M2 Pro) | Apple M2 Pro (10-core) - Apple M2 Max (12-core) | Up to 38-core GPU | Up to 96GB | 14-inch Liquid Retina XDR display | Up to 8TB | 12.31 x 8.71 x 1.55 in / 31.26 x 22.12 x 1.55 cm |\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M1) | Apple M1 Pro - Apple M1 Max | Up to 32-core GPU | Up to 64GB | 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, 3024 x 1964 | Up to 8TB | 0.61 x 12.31 x 8.71 inches / 1.55 x 31.26 x 22.12 cm |\nThe best MacBook Pro: FAQs\nMacBook Pro versus MacBook Air: which is better?\nWhile the MacBook Air is a fantastic and ultra-portable laptop at a great price, it is not really geared for the highest level of creative professionals, so it might not have the memory, storage, and processing power you'll need for the top end creative workflows.\nIf you need to do serious creative content work, or if you need a machine that will stand the test of time and you're willing to invest a bit more than a MacBook Air, the MacBook Pro is the way to go. If this is the case, pair with the best monitors for MacBook Pro for the absolute in color fidelity, expanding your digital workspace to an even larger display.\nIs the MacBook Pro good for gaming?\nIt really depends on the laptop model and the type of games you want to play. You're unlikely to get the same level of performance at max settings on most of the best MacBook Pro compared to the best gaming laptops.\nSaying that, though, using a MacBook Pro laptop for gaming has come on leaps and bounds, and is set to only get even better.\nOur News Editor Jacob tried playing Cyberpunk 2077 on a MacBook Pro 16-inch with the M4 Max. You can check out what he discovered by clicking here, but essentially, performance proved excellent.\nHe said: \"It was on \u2018Ultra\u2019 settings with a buttery smooth and excellently rendered 120 frames per second. And yes, this performance is derived from Apple\u2019s M4 Max chip \u2013 no discrete GPU required. Further, this was fully taking advantage of Apple's Metal 4, coming later this year, including MetalFX Frame Interpolation. It looked fantastic and was responsive.\"\nHow long does a MacBook Pro last?\nIn short, it should last years and years. They are expensive, but I tend to think of them as being investment laptops.\nCouple the specs with a robust and well-built chassis and you're looking at a long-lasting machine.\nI still recommend M1-powered MacBook Pro laptops, which came out at the tail-end of 2020, because while they're not the latest and greatest, performance remains exceptional.\nWhich MacBook Pro processor is best?\nThis isn't as straightforward a question as it might seem, honestly. The MacBook Pro 14-inch with an M4-series chip is our top pick, but an M2 Max MacBook Pro is going to outperform an M3 or M3 Pro chip, even though these were released more recently. It all depends on your performance needs and your budget, since older models might be cheaper than current models while still giving you the level of performance you need.\nIt's truly up to you and your needs, budget, and current deals going on. The MacBook Pro notoriously runs for quite some time, so don't feel like just because a new model dropped that your previous generation is going to bite the dust anytime soon.\nShould I get a MacBook Pro with an Intel chip?\nI wouldn't recommend it. While they're a lot cheaper, they're also far slower (and older). If you're going for an Intel processor, opt for a Windows laptop instead.\nIt really wasn't until the launch of the Apple Silicon system-on-chip that MacBooks really showed off what they're truly capable of - we've loved every M-series MacBook Pro we've tested when it comes to performance.\nHow to choose the best MacBook Pro for you\nThe two key factors to keep in mind when choosing a MacBook Pro is price and performance, since the designs and displays of each MacBook Pro on our list are similar enough that you won't find much difference there. Only slight differences in design, port offering, transfer speeds and specs.\nOlder models will be cheaper, as will smaller sizes, so if you're on a more restricted budget, the M2-series MacBook Pros in 13-inch and 14-inch are great, and you can get up to an M2 Max in a 15-inch MacBook Pro. If you've got a lot of room in your budget, a 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Max is going to be the best you can get and will last you much longer than other models might, which is great for future-proofing, however it is also going to be the most expensive, by far.\nFor memory and storage, unless you're doing substantial video editing work with very large source files at high resolutions, you shouldn't need more than 24GB or 32GB of memory, and 1TB storage is going to be more than enough for most users. Video pros will definitely need a minimum of 32GB and 2TB, and higher memory and storage configurations are recommended.\nIf you do a lot of cloud-based work, or don't work with heavy files, you can get away with smaller storage sizes, or you can use some of the best external hard drives for Mac expanding your storage for cheaper than you may find internal storage to be.\nAt the end of the day, decide what is priority, be it the processor, storage, ports, or screen, and then look for the right combination based on that. For most, any MacBook Pro is more than enough, so pay attention to what is needed, and go from there.\nFor more laptop peripherals, see our reviews of the best MacBook Pro accessories.\nHow we test the best MacBook Pro laptops\n\u2705 More than 1,800 laptops, Chromebooks, and MacBooks reviewed\n\u2705 15 years of product testing\n\u2705 Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2705 Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWe put all the MacBook Pro models we review through our standard battery of benchmark tests to score their processing power, both in absolute synthetic terms but also with workloads like video editing, 3D rendering, and others.\nTraditionally, MacBooks are some of the best laptops for photo editing, best video editing laptops, and best laptops for graphic design - so we're always keen to see how the latest models perform in the creative arena. We also conduct extensive battery testing to measure its real world longevity.\nWe measure these scores against their predecessors to determine if it's worth the upgrade to the latest models, or if the previous model offers a better value of price for its performance.\nFor more computing essentials, we reviewed the best monitors for the Mac mini\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nSteve is B2B Editor for Creative & Hardware at TechRadar Pro.

Dell has a new and improved iteration of its powerful Dell XPS 13, while Apple is fighting for the laptop crown with its latest M4 MacBook Air 13-inch - but which one is the better device?\nTo help you make an informed decision, we\u2019re pitting the 2025 editions of both devices against each other, comparing them across all the most important areas. From price to performance, from design to display, we\u2019re covering it all. Which one will win? Read on to find out.\nDell XPS 13 vs MacBook Air: Price\nAlthough at first glance both laptops are aimed at the same demographic, the MacBook Air is a fair bit cheaper than the Dell XPS 13. With a starting price of $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,699, it's a decent chunk more affordable than Dell\u2019s asking price of $1,099.99 / \u00a31,299 / AU$2,797.30, particularly in regions outside of the US.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that these prices are for the lowest specification of each model with the Dell XPS 13 - our current top pick of the best Dell laptops - going up to a whopping $2,249.99 / \u00a32,348.98 / AU$3,898.40. Meanwhile, the MacBook Air 13-inch effectively maxes out at $2,199 / \u00a32,199 / AU$3,229 for relatively similar specifications, so the price gap closes a bit at the higher end of configurations; this is because Apple aims to keep the base package price of its MacBooks as low as possible, but charges a lot more for add-ons like extra storage or RAM.\nRegardless, the MacBook Air wins this round - its tightly controlled hardware ecosystem means you're simply getting a bit more bang for your buck with Apple's lightweight laptop.\n- Winner: MacBook Air\nDell XPS 13 vs MacBook Air: Design\nAs we've come to expect from high-end laptops, both of these devices are absolutely stunning from a design perspective. The Dell XPS 13 comes packed into a lightweight, ultra-thin chassis that looks fantastic and is easy to take with you anywhere - without having to worry about your shoulders slowly starting to collapse under the weight of your laptop.\nIn our review, we found that the keyboard felt great to type on, but one notable downside our Computing Editor Christian Guyton highlighted was the \u2018invisible\u2019 touchpad - this poses an issue with accessibility for blind or partially-sighted users, as you can\u2019t feel the difference between the palm rest and the actual touchpad. There's also a distinct lack of physical ports on the XPS 13, with only two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports - you\u2019ll likely be relying on Bluetooth if you want to connect any peripherals.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIn comparison, the MacBook Air also comes with a sleek chassis, which again looks breathtaking. It\u2019s super light, weighing almost exactly the same as the XPS 13, making it a similarly great option to pop in your backpack and take on the go. The MacBook Air is actually thinner than the XPS 13, measuring in at 1.13cm to Dell\u2019s 1.48cm - and while that sounds marginal, it's enough that you can notice the difference.\nIn testing, we found that the MacBook's keyboard was amazing to type on, with great key travel and responsiveness for such a thin device. The MacBook Air does suffer from a similar issue to the XPS 13 regarding its lack of ports, with only two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and MagSafe 3 for charging. However, that's enough to ensure that the MacBook Air just barely wins this round; after all, you don\u2019t have to sacrifice a USB-C port for charging.\n- Winner: Macbook Air\nDell XPS 13 vs MacBook Air: Performance and display\nWhen we reviewed the Dell XPS 13, we were absolutely blown away, with it performing admirably across multiple areas throughout its entire testing period. It was great for real-world usage, easily coping with countless Chrome tabs, and also held up well when being put through its paces during our synthetic benchmarking process. While the fans did get a little noisy during the 3DMark graphics tests, this is to be expected, and it remained silent during all other usage.\nWe'll take a brief aside here to talk about on-device AI, since it's the current hot topic. Here, the XPS 13 is indisputably the winner, packing a 2nd-gen Intel Core Ultra chip with a superior neural processing unit (NPU) to Apple's M4 Neural Engine. You also get a more developed and fleshed-out AI experience in Windows 11 with Copilot, since Apple Intelligence arrived on the scene a lot later than Microsoft's AI helper.\nThe screen on the Dell XPS 13 is undeniably the standout feature. You get a top-spec 3K (2880 x 1800) InfinityEdge OLED touch display, which provides excellent picture quality and color reproduction. Even when conducting graphics benchmarking, which often results in some choppy framerates, it still looked fantastic.\nSimilarly, the MacBook Air performed exceptionally well, from everyday productivity usage to intensive benchmarking. No matter what we threw at it, it ran smoothly and silently, even running some triple-A games - something which would have been unimaginable on a MacBook Air even just a few years ago. Performance-wise, the base configuration edges out Dell's laptop thanks to its superior onboard graphics, but it's a close fight.\nThe MacBook Air display features a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina panel (Apple's signature display type, found on most of the best MacBooks and Macs) with a 2560 x 1664 resolution and 500 nits of sustained brightness. It is brilliant for everything from gaming to content creation or even watching movies - but the XPS 13's OLED panel is certainly the better screen, so this one ends up coming out as a draw.\n- Winner: Tie\nDell XPS 13 vs MacBook Air: Battery life\nWhile both devices deliver great battery life, there's a decisive winner here. The Dell XPS 13 comes with a bold promise of 24-hour battery life - and in our review, we found that it delivered just that, giving us a whopping 23 hours and 26 minutes of usage in our TechRadar movie test. This laptop will easily see you through a full workday (or two, or three) and also charges super fast, going from empty to 80% in an hour while not being used.\nOn the other hand, Apple claims that the MacBook Air offers up to 18 hours of battery life when it comes to movie playback, but it delivered under 15 hours in our active web surfing benchmarking. Granted, that's still pretty darn good, but it's frankly dwarfed by the best-in-class battery life of the XPS 13. Again, this device will easily last you a full workday and then some, but it just doesn\u2019t quite live up to the competition here. Another downside is that this device doesn\u2019t charge as quickly either, taking 90 mins to reach 50% charge.\n- Winner: Dell XPS 13\nWhich one should you buy?\nAlthough the MacBook Air technically won more categories, it\u2019s hard to determine a clear overall winner between these two laptops. While the Dell XPS 13 decisively takes home the crown when it comes to battery life and display quality, the MacBook Air does offer very similar performance at a significantly lower price point while also offering more ports and a thinner chassis.\nOne key factor we haven't discussed here - since it largely comes down to personal preference - is operating system. Windows and macOS are hugely different, and if you're already accustomed to using one of them, switching to the other will be difficult and potentially confusing. It's also worth noting that the XPS 13 also offers somewhat better software compatibility than the MacBook Air, since it uses an x86-based Intel processor rather than an Arm-based M4 chip seen in the Air. If you have specific software needs, be sure to confirm that the required programs are compatible before making a purchase.\nWhile both of these devices are absolutely fantastic options for those looking for a new laptop, which one you pick up should ultimately be based on your needs and how much you\u2019re willing to spend. If you prefer Windows and want something that will last you days without needing a charge, then the Dell XPS 13 is likely the one for you. On the other hand, if you\u2019re hoping to save some money where you can but still need a high-end device, then the M4 MacBook Air 13-inch will probably suit you better.\nJasmine is a gaming hardware and tech journalist with an appreciation for all things others dare to call boring or complicated.\nPreviously of GamesRadar and The Mirror, Jasmine has reviewed and covered hundreds of devices from laptops to sound bars, monitors to cameras and almost everything in-between.\nIn her spare time, Jasmine enjoys playing games that make her rage and building PCs, which also makes her rage \u2013 as well as spending time with her three cats.

With it's all-AMD hardware (both CPU and GPU are from Team Red), this laptop offers great game performance without breaking the bank.\nThe best laptop overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nApple has once again launched the best laptop money can buy with the new MacBook Air 13-inch (M4). Not only does this refresh bring the extra power of the M4 chip, which can handle day-to-day tasks with ease, as well as more intensive tasks such as video editing and music recording, but it also comes at a new lower price, making this by far the best laptop you can currently buy. There's simply not another laptop at this price point that offers the same mix of performance, design and build quality. A new and improved webcam brings some handy AI-powered tools to make video calls look even better, and the new Sky Blue color option gives you more options for picking a MacBook Air that suits your tastes. If you want a laptop with a bigger screen, then consider the MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) instead.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want the best laptop for your money: The M4 MacBook Air 13-inch is now the MacBook (and laptop) we'd recommend to pretty much anyone thanks to a great design, excellent performance and relatively affordable price.\n\u2705 You want a laptop for traveling with: The stylish thin and light design, plus the long battery life, makes this an excellent laptop for going out and about with.\n\u2705 You want power - but not too much: The M4 chip powering the MacBook Air is great at day-to-day tasks, as well as video editing and AI.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want a touchscreen: While there are plenty of touchscreen laptops in our best laptops guide, Apple is still holding out on giving its MacBooks touchscreens.\n\u274c You want plenty of ports: The MacBook Air (M4) once again features just two Thunderbolt ports. If you have a lot of peripherals to plug in, you'll need to use a hub or adaptor.\n\u274c You want a bigger screen: The 13-inch screen of the MacBook Air makes it nice and portable, but some people may find it a bit too small to work on - in that case, you should consider the 15-inch model instead.\nIn-depth analysis\nThe latest MacBook Air sticks pretty closely to same design we've seen with the older M2 and M3 models, but with a new, improved webcam and Sky Blue color choice. It has a stylish and modern look that's easy to carry around and comfortable to work on. This does mean that port selection remains limited, which won't be a deal breaker for many people, but if you have lots of peripherals you need to plug in, you'll want to invest in a USB-C hub or look into getting a MacBook Pro.\nThe new MacBook Air 13-inch features the M4 chip, currently Apple's latest generation, and it's an excellent performer, especially for day-to-day tasks like browsing the web and creating documents. It also supports Apple Intelligence, though so far the AI tools on offer are a little underbaked. This isn't the most powerful MacBook, but for the price you are getting a dependable workhorse that Windows 11 rivals will struggle to match.\nApple claims the MacBook Air 13-inch (M4) can last up to 18 hours watching Apple TV shows and 15 hours browsing the internet, and we found in our own tests that you can expect at least 14 hours on a single charge when using the new MacBook Air for a variety of tasks. This means you can expect to go several workdays without needing to plug it in, which is seriously impressive.\nThe MacBook Air 13-inch has always been Apple's best value laptop, and it's just got better, as it now starts at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,699, which is a price cut compared to the M3 model's starting price of $1,099 / \u00a31,099 / AU$1,799. While this still isn't budget laptop territory, the performance and build quality you're getting for the price is seriously impressive, and you'd be hard pressed to find a Windows 11 laptop that offers the same level of finesse for this price.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | Apple has lowered the starting price for the latest MacBook Air making it much better value | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nDesign | No new design, but it remains one of the best looking laptops in 2025 | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nPerformance | Performance is great thanks to the M4 chip, but it's not a huge leap over the M3 or even the M2 | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nBattery life | You can work on this laptop for a whole work day on a single charge | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\n\ud83d\udcbb Apple's 13-inch MacBook Air remains my favorite laptop. The MacBook Air 13-inch (M4) has an excellent build and design, working on it is a pleasure, and the M4 provides all the power I need for the widest range of tasks. I appreciate the long battery life, bright, colorful screen, and clear audio. Read the full review: Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M4)\nThe best budget laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Asus Chromebook CM14 is one of the best Chromebooks we've ever reviewed, and it's also my pick as for best budget laptop you can buy in 2025.\nNow, make no mistake: this isn't a powerful device, so if you want something to handle more intensive tasks than browsing the internet and writing up documents, you'd be much better off checking out the MacBook Air (M4) at the top of this best laptops list.\nHowever, if you're on an extremely tight budget, then the Asus Chromebook CM14 is definitely worth considering. Retailing for just $299 / \u00a3299, and often found on sale for even less, there's simply no Windows 11 laptop at this price point that can compete.\nThis is because its operating system, ChromeOS, is able to run smoothly on lower-powered (and therefore cheaper) components, so you get a much better experience on low-cost laptops than similarly priced budget Windows 11 laptops, which struggle to run the more demanding operating system on weaker hardware.\nWith the Asus Chromebook CM14, you get a laptop that's around a third of the price of the cheapest MacBook, but which will offer decent enough performance for day-to-day tasks. This makes it a particularly good pick for kids and students looking for a new laptop that doesn't break the bank, but which is dependable for schoolwork.\nDespite the low price, we were impressed with the build quality when we reviewed the Asus Chromebook CM14, and battery life is also excellent, with it lasting almost 10 hours on a single charge. However, it'll struggle with any intensive tasks, and the screen isn't great. Still, for a rock-bottom price, you're getting a great budget laptop for a price that its rivals will really struggle to match.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You have a very tight budget: You won't find many laptops as cheap as this, and certainly very few that are worth buying. For the price, this is a very good budget laptop.\n\u2705 You want something portable: The Asus Chromebook CM14 is very thin and light, and the 14-inch screen means the overall size of the laptop is relatively small, making it a great choice for people who need a laptop that they can easily carry around with them.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want a 2-in-1 device: While you can recline the screen up to 180 degrees, which is useful in some scenarios, such as collaborating on a presentation, the display doesn't fold all the way back, so look elsewhere if you want a laptop that can be used like a tablet as well.\n\u274c You want to do any kind of multitasking: While the Asus Chromebook CM14 is a fine choice for basic tasks such as internet browsing, document creation and streaming movies and TV shows, the lack of RAM means you can't do loads of things at once without the performance seriously suffering.\nIn-depth analysis\nThe Asus Chromebook CM14 isn't the most glamorous or stylish laptop, but it comes with a good looking, modest, design that will fit in with any professional or academic setting, and its thin and light design, weighing just 1.45kg (3.20 lbs) makes it a great laptop for people looking for a device they can easily take with them when traveling. The overall build quality is impressive considering the price, with a sturdy feel that means you shouldn't worry about chucking it into a bag, and there's a decent amount of ports as well, including two USB-C, one USB-A, microSD and 3.5mm audio jack. However, during our review, we found that the budget nature of the Asus Chromebook CM14 is evident in the screen, with a low 1366 x 768 resolution that's a little blurry and washed out.\nYou really need to keep your expectations in check with the Asus Chromebook CM14 when it comes to performance. For basic tasks, it does a fine job, including streaming high definition content from the likes of Netflix. It can even play a few (very basic) mobile games - we fired up Clash of Clans and Asphalt Legends Unite and they ran without issue. However, the 4GB of RAM means that having multiple apps open at once isn't really feasable, and the Chrome web browser can start to struggle with too many tabs open at once.\nWhen it comes to battery life, the Asus Chromebook CM14 really punches above its weight, with it lasting almost 10 hours in our battery life tests, which involve playing a 1080p video on a loop with the screen set to 50% brightness. This is an excellent result that many other Chromebooks and budget laptops simply cannot compete with, though some Chromebooks, such as the Acer Chromebook Spin 314, do offer a slightly longer battery life (for more money).\nThe Asus Chromebook CM14 costs $299 / \u00a3299 (about AU$473), and we're already seeing price cuts that make it even more affordable. As long as you keep your expectations in check, you'll be very impressed with what you get for this money, and if you want a laptop that you can use for basic tasks, or something that can get through a school day without breaking, then this is one of the best value laptops you can buy. However, if your budget can stretch to it, I recommend going for a slightly more powerful laptop that will be more future-proof.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | For the ultra-low price, you get a very decent little laptop. | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nDesign | The Asus Chromebook CM14 is thin, light and very portable, with an impressively robust build quality. | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 |\nPerformance | Don't expect super-fast performance, this is a budget laptop and that means basic tasks are fine but anything more demanding will frustrate. | \u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606 |\nBattery life | Battery life is very good, at just over 9 and a half hours, and it charges back up to full very quickly, making the Asus Chromebook CM14 a great laptop for working away from a desk. | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\n\ud83d\udcbb The Asus Chromebook CM14 makes a good first impression with its light and thin design. It can handle light productivity and entertainment, but it comes unstuck when multitasking \u2013 even running basic apps can cause issues. However, new Chromebooks don\u2019t get much cheaper than this, so you\u2019ll have to consider whether you can live with its limited capabilities. Read the full review: Asus Chromebook CM14\nThe best for Windows 11\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAfter reinvigorating the Surface Laptop line with last year's model, Microsoft has now released a smaller, more affordable version of the Surface Laptop for 2025 - the Surface Laptop 13-inch, and it is now our pick as the best Windows 11 laptop in 2025.\nThe new Surface Laptop 13-inch offers MacBook Air-rivalling price and build design, with some lovely color options and a general premium look and feel that other laptop makers, outside of Apple, struggle to match.\nThe fact that it comes with a lower price than last year's model is also a big win for us consumers, however it is important to note that in order to offer the Surfce Laptop 13-inch at a cheaper price point, Microsoft has made some sacrifices - and we're not just talking about the smaller screen.\nFor a start, this is a less powerful laptop than the larger models, using a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus 8-core chip, rather than the more powerful X Elite chip that powers the previous model. It also only comes with 16GB of RAM, so you can't configure it benefit from more memory, though for most people 16GB will be plenty.\nAs for the screen, it's smaller and lower resolution than the previous model, and offers 60Hz refresh rate, half of the 120Hz the last model supports. This might sound like a rather big downgrade, and a puzzling one at that, as most of the time newer models come out with more powerful hardware, but it starts to make sense when you realize that Microsoft, having dropped the affordable Surface Go lineup, is now pitching the Surface Laptop 13-inch as the cheapest entry-point into the Surface ecosystem, with the larger, more powerful, edition from 2024 still being sold, but as the premium, high-end model. This means the 13-inch Surface Laptop is actually a brilliant choice for most people, offering a premium experience at an affordable price.\nGet the best deal on your next Microsoft product with our Microsoft coupon codes.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want the best Windows 11 laptop in the world: The latest Surface Laptop is a stunning compact laptop, offering build quality, performance, and battery life that puts most competitors in the same price bracket to shame.\n\u2705 You want a great-looking laptop: Microsoft shows Apple how it's done by bringing some bright and vibrant color choices for the new Surface Laptop, putting the muted hues of modern MacBook Airs to shame.\n\u2705 You want a laptop that will last all day: In our tests, the Surface Laptop 13-inch managed an excellent 17 hours of work on a single charge. We even used it throughout a 15-hour flight to Taiwan and it kept on going.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You need lots of power: As I mentioned earlier, Microsoft has designed the Surface Laptop 13-inch as a more affordable, entry-level Surface device, and that means if you want something with loads of power, look elsewhere.\n\u274c You want to play games: The Arm-based chip comes with an integrated GPU, which is fine for most tasks, but isn't able to handle demanding games.\n\u274c You don't want to worry about app compatibility: The Surface Laptop's Arm-based chip means some apps build for Intel or AMD chips might not run correctly. Thankfully, that's becoming more rare, especially with Microsoft's Prism compatibility tool, but it's something to keep in mind.\nIn-depth analysis\nMicrosoft's Surface devices have always been stylish products, and the latest Surface Laptop continues that trend, even with a lower price. It has a thin and light chassis that is easy to carry around, yet feels sturdy and premium, and we especially love the new purple colorway, though that is only available on the higher-specced model. However, the quality of the screen has been reduced compared to the more expensive model from 2024.\nFor day-to-day tasks, this is a great performer, and Windows 11's Arm-compatibility has come a long way. However, it's far from the most powerful laptop in our best laptops list, and the M4-MacBook Air (which sits at the top of this guide) offers much better performance. Also, if you're looking for a laptop to play games on, then you should look elsewhere, as this is a laptop that really isn't built for that kind of use.\nAs with other Arm-powered laptops, the Surface Laptop 13-inch is incredibly power efficient, and that means that the battery life is excellent. We found it lasted over 17 hours during our tests, and in real-world usage it even lasted an entire 15-hour flight as well.\nWith the new Surface Laptop coming with a cheaper starting price compared to last year's model, this is a laptop that offers brilliant value for money, with a build quality and design that makes it look and feel like a much more expensive device. While Microsoft has made compromises to keep the price down, it has resulted in a great-value laptop that is more accessible for people.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | While the Surface Go lineup is no more, Microsoft has made the 13-inch Surface Laptop the most affordable way to get into the ecosystem | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nDesign | It looks great and feels fantastic to type on, though the display could be better | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nPerformance | For a casual use notebook, it's in line with similarly specced Windows laptops, but the MacBook Air 13-inch with M4 runs circles around it | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 |\nBattery life | At just over 17 hours of battery life in our tests, this is one of the longest-lasting Windows laptops around | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\n\ud83d\udcbb The Microsoft Surface Laptop 13-inch is a gorgeous laptop that is great for everyday and productivity tasks with some of the best battery life of any laptop of its size, but its weaker Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus chip falls far short of a similarly priced MacBook Air 13-inch, making it much harder to recommend unless you absolutely don't want a Mac. Read the full review: Microsoft Surface Laptop 13-inch\nThe best Ultrabook\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDell continues to prove it's the go-to company for some of the best Windows laptops money can buy, with its latest XPS 13 laptop that features Intel's cutting-edge Core Ultra 200 series processors. We previously had the Dell XPS 13 model with the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip in this position in our best laptops list, but the newer Intel model has knocked it off thanks to its improved performance and general compatibility with Windows 11 apps. You still get a gorgeous thin and light design with a stunning 13.4-inch screen, and with in our tests it also hit almost 24 hours on a single charge - an incredible performance considering the power on offer here.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want seriously long battery life: Offering almost 24 hours on a single charge, the Dell XPS 13 (9350, Intel Core Ultra 2nd Gen) will keep going over multiple work days.\n\u2705 You want a thin, light and powerful laptop: The Dell XPS 13 (9350, Intel Core Ultra 2nd Gen) features Dell's trademark design flair and build quality, while housing cutting-edge components that will handle most tasks with ease.\n\u2705 You want the best Windows 11 laptop: Powerful components, including Intel\u2019s Lunar Lake chips with boosted NPU performance for improved AI performance, makes this the best Windows 11 laptop in the world right now.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want to plug in lots of peripherals: The Dell XPS 13 is a very thin device - but that comes at the cost of ports - you only get two USB-C ports.\n\u274c You're after an affordable laptop: Perhaps unsurprisingly, the latest XPS 13 is an expensive, premium, laptop. There are far cheaper laptops on this list that will be more suited to most people's budgets.\n\u274c You are sight-impaired: The biggest issue we had with the Dell XPS 13 is that its edgeless touchpad and touch button design for the function bar means partially-sighted users could find using this laptop frustrating.\nIn-depth analysis\nThe Dell XPS 13 continues the XPS lineup's reputation as being some of the best-designed Windows 11 laptops you can buy. It looks gorgeous with a thin and light design that rivals any Apple product, and it feels sturdy and well built as well. You can pick from three different screen resolutions, with the 3K touchscreen option being a particular highlight.\nThe Dell XPS 13 offers excellent day-to-day performance thanks to its new Intel Ultra Series 2 chips, which can handle day-to-day tasks with ease. You also don't get some of the compatibility issues that the Snapdragon model suffers from, which while rare does mean that the Intel model is far more versatile.\nAmazingly, the Intel model of the Dell XPS 13 beats the Snapdragon model by a few hours when it comes to battery life, easily lasting several work days on a single charge. This is a testament to the power efficiency of Intel's new chips, and makes the Dell XPS 13 (Intel Core Ultra 2nd Gen) an ideal laptop for people who want to work while out and about.\nWhile the Dell XPS 13 is one of the best laptops running Windows 11 you can buy, it isn't the cheapest - by a long shot. The starting price will put a lot of people off, and it gets a lot more expensive as you configure the specs. Of course, for the (high) price you're getting a lot - including a brilliant design, stunning screen (especially if you pay extra for the 3K model) and cutting-edge components.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | Undeniably a rather expensive laptop, but it delivers your money's worth with strong performance and design that looks and feels premium | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nDesign | It's got a sleek and svelte design that puts other laptops to shame - but we do have concerns about the accessibility of the trackpad and function keys | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nPerformance | Excellent all-round performance, and can handle multiple apps open at once with ease | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | With truly all-day battery life off a single charge, the XPS 13 with Intel Lunar Lake proves that it can go the distance | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\n\ud83d\udcbb The latest Dell XPS 13 brings Intel's Lunar Lake chips to the iconic laptop line, delivering truly all-day battery life and strong performance across the board in a sleek and stylish MacBook-esque design. However, I still have reservations about the latest XPS redesign, especially concerning its edgeless trackpad and adaptive function bar that could create some problems with usability, and which prevent it from reaching true greatness. Read the full review: Dell XPS 13 (9350, Intel Core Ultra 2nd Gen)\nThe best value laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe best value laptop you can buy in 2025 doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be the very cheapest laptop out there (check out our pick for the best budget laptop higher up in this guide if you want a laptop with a rock-bottom price), but what it does mean is that the laptop provides excellent value for money, offering features, performance and build quality that matches or even surpasses much more expensive laptops.\nThat's exactly what the Dell Inspiron 14 Plus does. Dell's Inspiron line has always featured solid mid-range laptops, and the latest Dell Inspiron 14 Plus (7441) model continues that trend. In our Dell Inspiron 14 Plus review, we were very impressed with the performance and design of the laptop, and its extremely long battery life was particularly noteworthy. While this laptop is still on the pricey side, it offers unbeatable value for money that shames rivals such as HP and Apple.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want an affordable laptop that doesn't compromise: The Dell Inspiron 14 Plus offers plenty of bang for your buck, all for a more palatable price than flagship laptops.\n\u2705 You fancy a MacBook Air, but prefer Windows 11: Slim, good performance, and excellent battery life make this an excellent alternative if you like the idea of the MacBook Air but don't want to use macOS.\n\u2705 You want a future-proof laptop without spending a fortune: The Dell Inspiron 14 Plus comes with cutting-edge technology, especially with its ARM-based Qualcomm processor and support for on-device AI tools.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want the best of the best: The Dell Inspiron 14 Plus offers excellent value for money, but it's not a premium flagship laptop, so there are some (thankfully small) compromises. Go for the Dell XPS 13 (also in this guide) for a fully premium laptop instead.\n\u274c You want the cheapest laptop: The Dell Inspiron 14 Plus offers great value for money, but it's not the cheapest laptop on sale in 2025. If you are on a tight budget, you are probably better off looking at a Chromebook instead.\nIn-depth analysis\nWhile the design of the Dell Inspiron 14 Plus is a bit on the safe side, there's no denying that this is a stylish and modern thin and light laptop that looks more expensive than it actually is. While a few things, like the keyboard and touchpad, prevent the Dell Inspiron 14 Plus from being a truly premium-feeling device, you're not going to find a better-looking laptop at this price.\nAs long as you keep your expectations in check, the capabilities of the Dell Inspiron 14 Plus will impress you, with solid and dependable performance in Windows 11 with most apps. For day-to-day use, this is a fantastic value laptop - but if you want something to edit videos, play games or run complex tasks, you're better off looking elsewhere.\nIn our review we found the Dell Inspiron 14 Plus had a phenomenal battery life, lasting almost 18 and a half hours on a single charge - and we could work on the laptop for three work days - and there was still 50% battery left! This is seriously impressive, especially considering the affordable price of this laptop.\nWhile there are cheaper laptops out there, the Dell Inspiron 14 Plus is our pick as the best value laptop in 2025 because it punches above its weight when it comes to performance and battery life in particular. Rather than splashing out on a premium flagship model, the Dell Inspiron 14 Plus offers a more affordable alternative with few compromises.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | This is an excellent value Windows 11 laptop, and Dell often has very tempting sales | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nDesign | While the keyboard and touchpad are passable, this laptop is thin and light. It is a bit cookie-cutter in its aesthetics | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nPerformance | The performance is more than enough for most people\u2019s day-to-day needs. | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nBattery life | Though not quite as long as advertised, the battery life here is ridiculously long | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\n\ud83d\udcbb The Dell Inspiron 14 Plus 7441 is, in my mind, a solid alternative to the MacBook Air. While that\u2019s not exactly unique, this laptop does a good job at it as it\u2019s very portable, has snappy day-to-day performance, and comes with a very long battery life. Read the full review: Dell Inspiron 14 Plus\nThe best student laptop\nSpecifications\nDespite no longer being the most recent model, the Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M3) remains one of the best MacBooks you can buy in 2025 - especially if you're a student. This is because with the launch of MacBook Air 13-inch (M4), which sits at the top of this page, many retailers are cutting the price of the M3 model, making it an excellent choice for students who want a premium laptop to work and study on, but without spending a fortune. One thing to note, however, is that Apple itself is no longer making or selling the M3 MacBook Air, and that means stock at other retailers will begin to reduce, so if you've been meaning to pick one up, now is the best time.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want the best student laptop for your money: The MacBook Air 13-inch (M3) is now the MacBook we'd recommend to students thanks to its new, lower price.\n\u2705 You want a portable laptop: The thin and light design, plus the long battery life, makes this a laptop you can easily travel with.\n\u2705 You want dependable performance: The M3 chip powering the MacBook Air is still great for day-to-day tasks, and can even cope with video editing and AI.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want the latest MacBook Air: This is the previous generation of MacBook Air, so if you want the very latest model, go for the MacBook Air 13-inch (M4).\n\u274c You want lots of ports: The MacBook Air (M3) features two Thunderbolt ports, which means you might struggle if you have lots of peripherals that need plugging in.\n\u274c You want a bigger screen: The 13-inch screen of the MacBook Air makes it portable, but the 15-inch model might be a better choice for people who like working on a larger screen.\nIn-depth analysis\nThe MacBook Air M3 comes with the same design as the previous M2 model - but that's fine with us. It remains a stylish and modern-looking thin and light laptop, with Apple's renowned design and build quality. Only two USB-C ports does mean plugging in lots of accessories will need a USB hub, however.\nThe MacBook Air comes with the M3 chip - and there are actually two versions you can buy: a base model with an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU, and a more powerful version with an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The some base models also come with 8GB of memory, which is quite low by today's standards, but Apple has also released a base model with 16GB, which is much better for modern workloads.\nAccording to Apple, the MacBook Air 13-inch (M3) can last up to 18 hours watching Apple TV shows and 15 hours browsing the internet, though in our battery life benchmark tests (which involve playing a looped 1080p video) the 13-inch MacBook Air lasted a bit less than that, at 14 hours and 19 minutes. That's an excellent time for a laptop of this power, however it is slightly less than the previous model lasted in the same tests, which could suggest the bump in performance has come at the cost of efficiency.\nThe MacBook Air 13-inch (M3) launched at $1,099 / \u00a31,099 / AU$1,799, which was slightly higher than the older M1 MacBook Air\u2019s launch price of $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,599. Now that the M4 model has launched (with a cheaper starting price of $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,699), the M3 model has recieved some big price cuts to help retailers clear stock.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | The M3 MacBook Air was already excellent value for money (launching with a lower price than the M2 model), and with new price cuts it's even better | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nDesign | This remains one of the most stylish laptops you can buy | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPerformance | Performance remains excellent, and isn't too far behind the newer M4 model | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nBattery life | The epic battery life means you can work on the MacBook Air for multiple work and school days on a single charge | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\n\ud83d\udcbb The MacBook Air 13-inch (M3) is easily the best laptop that money can buy for students, especially thanks to new price cuts since the M4 model came out, though we recommend boosting the memory and storage space when ordering. That makes it more expensive, but far more future-proof. Read the full review: Apple MacBook Air 13-inch (M3)\nThe best Chromebook\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe HP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch is our latest pick for the best Chromebook you can buy in 2025 thanks to its premium design and build quality, while still keeping prices ($549.99 / \u00a3449.99 / AU$749) impressively low. Sure, this isn't the cheapest Chromebook out there (check out the Asus Chromebook CM14 higher up in this list for our budget pick), but it's still a lot cheaper than most Windows 11 laptops, and certainly any MacBook, yet it offers dependable performance that will be fine for pretty much any day-to-day task you require from it. As a Chromebook Plus device, the HP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch offers relatively powerful components for a Chromebook, and that means that ChromeOS and its apps feel fast and responsive, while the 1080p screen with 144Hz refresh rates is easily one of the best displays you'll find on a Chromebook, and will beat most displays you'll find on other budget laptops at this price. During our review of the HP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch, we really liked how it performed with productivity apps like Google Docs, and we also hooked up a Bluetooth gamepad and played mobile games including Asphalt Legends Unite, again with impressive results. If you're looking for a new Chromebook, this is easily the best you can buy right now, and it's a worthy entry in our best laptops list in its own right.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want high performance with a Chromebook: This is a great Chromebook for productivity with a large screen and excellent performance thanks to the Intel processor and 8GB of RAM, which is a lot more than you'd usually get with a Chromebook.\n\u2705 You want a well-made laptop: Just because Chromebooks like the HP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch are cheap it doesn't mean they have to look or feel cheap, and HP has done an excellent job of proving that with this laptop.\n\u2705 You want a portable 15-inch laptop: It's impressively thin for a laptop, and its battery life means you won't need to worry about plugging it in too often.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You need specific Windows or macOS apps: As a Chromebook, this uses Chrome OS which doesn't have all the apps a Windows laptop or MacBook have access to.\n\u274c You want a 2-in-1 laptop: There are plenty of Chromebooks (and other laptops) that are convertible, allowing you to use it as both a laptop and a tablet, but the HP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch isn't one of them.\n\u274c You want the very cheapest laptop: The HP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch offers superb value for money, but there are cheaper Chromebooks out there.\nIn-depth analysis\nLike other Chromebook Plus laptops, the HP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch features a much more premium design (and build quality) than standard, less expensive Chromebooks, and it feels solidly built as well. Its compact size makes it an easy laptop to carry around for hours, though this does mean that the keyboard layout feels a bit cramped.\nAs far as Chromebooks go, the HP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch is an excellent performer, with the Chrome OS operating system booting quickly, while apps run impressively smoothly. Again, being a Chromebook Plus device means it's kitted out with relatively powerful components for a Chromebook and this results in day-to-day tasks running smoothly, and you can even play games on it (from Google's Play Store). Sure, it can't compete with more expensive Windows 11 laptops or MacBooks, but for the price, you'll struggle to find a better performing laptop.\nEven with its large 15.6-inch 1080p screen, the HP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch's battery lasts impressively long, with the laptop lasting 10 hours and 41 minutes during our battery life test, which involves running a looped 1080p video with the screen at 50%. It also charges quickly, with it going from 30% to full in just 90 minutes.\nChromebook Plus devices are usually a bit more expensive than standard Chromebooks, and the HP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch is no different. However, compared to other laptops, the HP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch offers excellent value for money with a fantastic display, premium design and solid performance that other laptops at this price point struggle to match. It often goes on sale as well, making it even better value when sales events like Black Friday roll around.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | Like a lot of Chromebooks, this offers brilliant value for money | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nDesign | This is a well built and attractive-looking laptop that looks more expensive than it actually is | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nPerformance | The HP Chromebook Plus can handle most everyday tasks with ease, it boots up quickly and the screen looks fantastic | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nBattery life | The battery life is among the best we've tested, and it charges quickly as well | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\n\ud83d\udcbb The HP Chromebook Plus is a smooth and fast performer with a great build quality and premium feel. It handles light productivity, streaming and gaming with aplomb, barely putting a foot wrong during my time with it. The display is equally impressive, and battery life is good to boot. Read the full review: HP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch\nThe best laptop for creatives\nSpecifications\nThe brand-new MacBook Pro 16-inch now comes with the excellent M4 Pro and M4 Max chips - Apple's latest and most powerful bits of silicon that offer incredible performance, especially when it comes to creative tasks such as video editing. Throughout our time testing the M4 Pro version, we found the new 16-inch MacBook Pro could take on even the most complex of tasks with ease - and with a battery life well in excess of 20 hours - this is the best laptop for creatives who want the freedom to work anywhere they like.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You need the most powerful MacBook ever: You\u2019re guaranteed incredible performance that\u2019ll crush the more demanding workloads, whether it's the M4 Pro or M4 Max model you go for.\n\u2705 You\u2019re a traveling creative pro: If you're a creative who needs power, a gorgeous display, great-sounding speakers and lots of ports, this is the perfect travel companion, especially as it can go several work days on a single charge, so you don't have to worry about finding a plug socket.\n\u2705 You want the best that Apple Silicon can offer: Apple's M-class chips have revolutionised laptops, and the M4 Pro and M4 Max are the very pinnacle of Apple's hardware.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You have an earlier 16-inch MacBook Pro: The M4 Pro and M4 Max 16-inch MacBook Pro models are truly excellent devices, but if you have an M3 Pro, M3 Max, M2 Pro or M2 Max MacBook Pro, you probably don't need to upgrade.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for an affordable workstation laptop: The 16-inch MacBook Pro is an expensive investment, which means it may be priced out of many people's reach. The 14-inch model is more affordable, and you can get it with the base M4 chip.\n\u274c You\u2019re a casual user: Unless you\u2019re a creative professional, you\u2019re unlikely to need the kind of performance that the MacBook Pro 16-inch offers, especially with the M4 Max chip. For regular use, the MacBook Air 15-inch will be a better buy.\nIn-depth analysis\nThere's no obvious new design for the M4 Pro or M4 Max MacBook Pros, which is disappointing in some respects, but it remains a fantastic looking laptop. However, there have been some subtle tweaks to the design, with Thunderbolt 5 support, improved webcam and an optional nano-texture coating for the screen.\nOur independent benchmark tests showed a decent bump in performance over the M3 Pro model (we tested the M4 Pro version of this year's 16-inch MacBook Pro), and while there wasn't enough of a leap to make upgrading from the M3 generation worthwhile, it does mean that the new MacBook Pro is the most powerful laptop Apple has ever made - and it out performs most Windows 11 laptops at this price as well. If you want the very best hardware from Apple, this is the device to get.\nOnce again, Apple's 16-inch MacBook Pro comes with industry-leading battery life. In our tests it easily lasted over 20 hours on a single charge. Not only does that mean you can work for multiple days without needing to plug it in, but it's remarkable how this laptop offers such good the performance while also having a battery that lasts for days.\nThe MacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro/M4 Max) is an incredibly ambitious laptop both in terms of hardware and design, and it\u2019s aimed at creative professionals who need powerful mobile hardware. Yes, it's an expensive laptop - but if you need all that power, it's well worth paying for it.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | Same base price as the previous model in the US, and a bit cheaper in UK and Australia - but still very expensive | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 |\nDesign | No new design, but it's still a well built laptop with some nice subtle tweaks | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nPerformance | The M4 Pro is an incredible performer, especially with heavy duty creative tasks | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | You'll be able to go multiple workdays on a single charge with this laptop | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\n\ud83d\udcbb The latest MacBook Pro 16-inch is more powerful than ever thanks to the new M4 Pro (which we test here) and M4 Max chips, providing the level of performance that creative professionals require - and then some. While I found the lack of a new design disappointing (and you might also), I did appreciate that there's still been a few quiet tweaks under the hood, including Thunderbolt 5 support, an improved webcam and new optional nano-texture screen that together make this the most powerful MacBook Apple has ever made. Read the full review: MacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro)\nThe best laptop for gaming\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you want the very best gaming laptop, and price isn't much of a consideration, then you should seriously consider the new Razer Blade 16. Coming with Nvidia's latest RTX 5000 series laptop GPUs, including the ridiculously powerful RTX 5090, this is a sleek and slim machine that can rival even the most powerful gaming PCs. This all comes at a (very) high price, however, with a starting price of $2,999.99 / \u00a32,699.99 / AU$4,899.95 - and that price climbs quickly when you start upgrading the components.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want enthusiast-class performance: Thanks to cutting-edge components, especially the RTX 5090, you're getting incredible performance, allowing you to play the very latest games at their highest settings.\n\u2705 You want a killer design: Razer has an excellent reputation for designing great-looking devices, and the Razer Blade 16 is no exception - it's impressively thin for a gaming laptop, and feels solid and dependable.\n\u2705 You want something for more than gaming: While this is a laptop built from the ground up to play games, it also does a great job with productivity tasks, especially creative ones. The long (for a gaming laptop) battery life also helps.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You\u2019re on a budget: Razer laptops are notoriously expensive, and the Razer Blade 16 is yet another example of this. Check out the Acer Nitro 16 instead, which we've picked as the best cheap laptop you can buy right now.\n\u274c You are a casual gamer: The Razer Blade 16 is designed for enthusiasts and hardcore PC gamers. If you only play the occasional game, especially ones that aren't that graphically-demanding, then this will be a waste of money.\n\u274c You want to travel really light: While thin compared to most gaming laptops, the Razer Blade 16 has a chunky power brick. Yes, you can use USB-C instead, but it won\u2019t supply enough power to keep up when gaming.\nIn-depth analysis\nRazer makes some of the best thin and light laptops on the market, so it'll be no surprise to learn that the Razer Blade 16 is another example of this. Forget thick and chunky gaming laptops - the Razer Blade 16 proves powerful laptops for gaming don't have to be big and bulky. It also has one of the best screens you can find on a laptop and a keyboard that's a joy to type on.\nYou're not going to get a better performing gaming laptop in 2025 thanks to the high-end components Razer has put into the Blade 16. Even PC gamers who normally prefer desktop PCs will be impressed with how powerful this laptop is, and you'll have no issue playing the latest games for years to come at their highest graphics settings.\nGaming laptops aren't known for their long battery lives, but the Razer Blade 16 pleasantly surprised us, lasting seven and a half hours when not being used for gaming - which means you could use this as a work laptop and not have to charge during the workday. When gaming, the battery life around two and a half hours, which is to be expected considering the powerful internals of this laptop.\nLike with most Razer laptops, don't expect a budget device. The Razer Blade 16 is an extremely expensive laptop, and while you get a stunning design, excellent screen and some of the best mobile gaming tech on the market, it also means that this won't be a laptop that everyone can afford. If your budget can stretch to the steep asking price, however, you'll be getting an awesome gaming laptop that will last you for years and years.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | It's undeniably expensive, which will place it out of reach for some gamers, although you do get plenty of bang for your buck. | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606 |\nDesign | The design, though not really different from last year's model, is still unmatched in a gaming laptop. | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPerformance | Very few laptops will measure up against the RTX 5090 version of the Blade 16 when it comes to gaming performance - and those that can will inevitably be bulkier. | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nBattery life | Gaming laptops rarely offer good battery life, but the new Blade 16 surprised us with its power-efficiency. | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\n- Take a look at our Razer discount codes for the best Razer offers and savings.\n\ud83d\udcbb I loved reviewing the Razer Blade 16, a gaming laptop that delivers power and style in spades, offering best-in-class performance in games and even managing to hold its own as a day-to-day work laptop thanks to the improved battery life. Nvidia RTX 5000 GPU options bring DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation to the party, and some small but smart design tweaks from the previous model help make this an even better high-end laptop. Read the full review: Razer Blade 16 (2025)\nThe best 17-inch laptop\nSpecifications\nThe Dell XPS 17 (9730) remains the best large-screen laptop you can buy. If you find that working on a 13-inch or even 15-inch laptop isn't comfortable, then this is a laptop that's well worth considering. One of the best things about the Dell XPS 17 is that as well as offering an excellent large screen to work on, it maintains the thin, light and stylish design of the smaller XPS 13 and XPS 15 models, so you're not making too many compromises to portability for the bigger display. As a flagship laptop, the Dell XPS 17 comes with some of the most powerful mobile components around, including a discrete graphics card from Nvidia's latest RTX 4000 series, and while it can play game, it's best used as a productivity laptop. Digital creatives will especially love its mix of large screen and powerful components.\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want a solid and attractive 17-inch laptop: The Dell XPS 17 (9730) features the premium design and build quality we've come to expect from Dell's XPS lineup, alongside a large 17-inch screen.\n\u2705 You want excellent performance: The XPS 17 comes with very powerful components that means it performs brilliantly no matter what you throw at it.\n\u2705 You want a laptop that lasts: Despite its large screen and powerful components, battery life of the Dell XPS 17 impresses, with almost 10 hours on a single charge.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want a gaming laptop: The Dell XPS 17 can be configured to come with a dedicated GPU, but this is not a gaming laptop. Serious gamers can get better performance with the Razer Blade 14 (click for details).\n\u274c You want a budget laptop: The Dell XPS 17 is a large, flagship laptop with a premium design, which means it's quite expensive compared to other laptops - even big screen ones.\n\u274c Portability is a must: Unsurprisingly, this 17-inch laptop isn't the easiest to carry around compared to 13-inch Ultrabooks. That said, for the size, it is impressively svelte.\nIn-depth analysis\nThe Dell XPS 17 looks and feels extremely premium thanks to its machined aluminum body. Thin bezels surround the display, giving it a modern look while also keeping the overall size of the laptop as compact as possible. This isn't a laptop you can comfortably carry around in a small bag, mind you, but Dell has done a great job of making sure it's not big or bulky.\nThis is an excellent performer, packed with high-end components from Intel and Nvidia. Day to day tasks feel fast and responsive, and heavy creative workloads, such as 3D rendering and 4K video editing, are handled well. If you want a powerful workstation laptop with a large screen for creative work, and you don't fancy the MacBook Pro 16-inch (which is also in this guide), then this is an excellent alternative.\nPowerful laptops with large screens often suffer from poor battery life, but thanks to the efficient hardware in the Dell XPS 17, it avoids that fate. During our review, we found that for watching videos and web browsing, it'll last just under 10 hours on a single charge, meaning you can use it unplugged for a whole workday - though heavier workloads will see the battery deplete faster.\nThe Dell XPS 17 (9730) starts at $1,599 / \u00a32,698.99 / AU$4,398.90, though the base model varies depending on location. This is certainly pricey for a laptop, though you do get good specs, a large screen and thin and light design for your money. If you configure it with more powerful components, expect the price to rise even further.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | Not cheap, and the price creeps up depending on how you configure it | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nDesign | This is an impressively thin and light laptop considering its screensize | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nPerformance | Excellent at day-to-day and creative workloads, but don't expect a gaming powerhouse | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nBattery life | Almost 10 hours is impressive given all the power | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\n\ud83d\udcbb The Dell XPS 17 is everything I wanted from a larger laptop. By giving up the portability of smaller laptops, it can offer a large, vibrant screen and powerful performance. Of course, it also keeps the elegant trappings set out by the XPS laptop line. Read the full review: Dell XPS 17 (9730)\nThe best OLED laptop\nSpecifications\nWe were absolutely blown away while testing the Asus Vivobook S 15 Copilot+ thanks to its stunning design - which includes an excellent OLED display that makes colors pop, and with a 120Hz refresh rate, it feels fast, fluid and responsive as well. The built-in Harman/Kardon speakers makes this one of the best-sounding laptops in the world as well, and makes watching media on the Asus Vivobook S 15 Copilot+ an absolute joy. It also packs the Arm-based Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip, offering performance and battery life that rivals the M3-powered MacBook Air (which also uses an Arm-based chip).\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want a great value laptop for productivity: While the Asus Vivobook S 15 Copilot+ isn't cheap, considering the specs and performance on offer, it offers excellent value.\n\u2705 You love watching movies: Not only is its OLED screen gorgeous to look at, but it has some of the best speakers you'll find in a laptop.\n\u2705 You want to use AI locally: As a Copilot+ PC, the Asus Vivobook S 15 is able to run AI tasks locally, so you don't need to connect to the internet.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want a gaming laptop: While the 120Hz OLED screen might sound like a great display to play games on, the rest of the laptop isn't suitable - buy a dedicated gaming laptop instead.\n\u274c You don't care about AI: One of the biggest selling points of the Asus Vivobook S 15 Copilot+ is its AI-capable NPU. If you're not bothered about AI, then you might be better off getting something else.\n\u274c You're on a tight budget: The Asus Vivobook S 15 Copilot+ offers plenty to like for the price, but it is an expensive choice that might not suit everyone's budget.\nIn-depth analysis\nThe Asus Vivobook S 15 Copilot+ proves that you don't have to spend a fortune to get a great looking laptop. Its metallic chasssis is stylish and modern, while incredibly thin bezels ensure that the stunning OLED screen is your main area of focus. It also comes with a good selection of ports, including two USB 4 Type-C ports, two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, a Micro-SD card reader, a 3.5mm combo audio jack, and an HDMI out.\nIn our tests, the Asus Vivobook S 15 Copilot+ performed incredibly well, proving that its Arm-based Snapdragon X chip is no slouch, even when compared to Intel-powered laptops. The more energy efficient chip in the Vivobook S 15 meant that the laptop remained almost completely silent whilst we put it through its paces. One area it did fall down on, however, was graphics performance, so you might want to think about buying a different laptop if you're looking for something to edit videos or create 3D models on.\nAsus rates the Vivobook S 15 at 70WHrs for its battery capacity, and promises around 18 hours of battery life. In our tests we found it came close to that promise, lasting around 17-hours on a single charge. This means it's an excellent choice for anyone looking for a laptop they can use for multiple work days without worrying about charging it.\nWhen it comes to the price, the Asus Vivobook S 15 is impressively affordable for what you\u2019re getting. With a price tag of $1,299.99 (\u00a31,299.99 / AU$2,699), it packs in some serious hardware for that cash, though there's no denying that it is still an expensive laptop.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | This laptop is exceptionally well priced for what you get. With OLED screen, Harman/Kardon audio, and some seriously epic hardware, it\u2019s a solid pick | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nDesign | A beautiful satin metallic finish, subtle branding, and its awesome feature set makes this a stunning laptop | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\nPerformance | It might not be that great at gaming, and the AI needs some work, but it dominates every other performance metric | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nBattery life | With an 18-hour rated battery life, our testing saw the Vivobook S 15 land at around 17 hours or so under standard load, making it one of the most efficient laptops out there | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\n\ud83d\udcbb I think that the Asus Vivobook S 15 is an absolutely phenomenal piece of kit. With an aesthetic that\u2019d make even the Milano fashion houses jealous, it combines the latest and greatest Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, a beautiful OLED display, plus some serious hardware under the hood to deliver a phenomenal laptop experience with outstanding battery life for day-to-day usage. Read the full review: Asus Vivobook S 15 Copilot+\nThe best affordable gaming laptop\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Asus TUF Gaming A16 (we reviewed the Advantage Edition), is a brilliant budget laptop that proves you don't need to spend a fortune if you want to play the best PC games. While the specific specifications change slightly depending if you're shopping from the US, UK or Australia, you're getting solid AMD specs that will allow you to play modern games at medium to high settings. The Asus TUF Gaming A16 doesn't feel cheap either thanks to a solid design from Asus that we've come to expect of its TUF line, so you can throw this in your backpack without worrying about damaging it (within reason, of course - don't chuck it across a room).\nReasons to buy\n\u2705 You want a cheap gaming laptop that doesn't suck: Despite its lower price, the Asus TUF Gaming A16 offers strong performance and good build quality.\n\u2705 You want a gaming laptop with decent battery life: Thanks to the power efficiency of modern AMD hardware, when reviewing this laptop we found it lasted well over 10 hours.\n\u2705 You want a nice screen: Asus hasn't skimped on the screen, with the 16-inch display offering 1600p resolution and 240Hz refresh rates for smooth gameplay.\nShow expert analysis \u25bc\nReasons to avoid\n\u274c You want to max out your games: If you're a hardcore PC gamer that wants 4K gaming at ultra settings and with ray tracing on, you may want to check out the Razer Blade 16 if you have the money.\n\u274c You want the best gaming features: Some of the best features to help boost game performance, especially DLSS upscaling and multi frame generation are exclusive to Nvidia GPUs - so if you get an all-AMD Asus TUF Gaming A16 you won't have access to these.\n\u274c You want a future-proof gaming laptop: The Asus TUF Gaming A16 does a good job of playing modern games, but if you want something that will be able to max out future games in five year's time, then you'll need to invest in something more powerful.\nIn-depth analysis\nWhile the Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition looks unmistakably like a gaming laptop, the design doesn't go too overboard when it comes to gaming aesthetics. The slim bezels around the screen keep it from being too bulky (often an issue with budget laptops), and gives the 16-inch screen room to shine. It also feels solid and robust, which is the hallmark of Asus' TUF line of products.\nThe Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition model we reviewed comes with the AMD Radeon RX 7600S GPU, which is roughly equivalent to an Nvidia RTX 4060 laptop GPU, which means playing at 1080p at max settings gives you a nice balance between visual splendor and slick performance. Taking advantage of the higher 1600p resolution the screen offers will see framerates drop however, but AMD's FSR upscaling tech, while not as good as rival DLSS tech from Nvidia, does a good job of keeping games running smoothly.\nThe AMD hardware in the Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition means this laptop can hit over 10 hours when unplugged. Sure, that's not while gaming, but it far surpasses a lot of gaming laptops, especially at this price point. A lot of this is thanks to AMD's Smart Access Graphics GPU-switching tech which switches between the dedicated Radeon RX 7600S GPU and the low-power integrated graphics to help prolong battery life.\nConsidering the specs, build quality, and overall performance of the Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition, this is an affordable gaming laptop that offers excellent value for money. The large screen with high refresh rate is particularly pleasing to see at this price point. However, if you have a bit more money in your budget, going for a laptop with an Nvidia RTX 4060 - or even a newer RTX 5070 - laptop GPU will give you a decent bump in performance.\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nPrice | The Asus TUF Gaming A16 offers a great mix of affordability and performance. | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nDesign | The Asus TUF Gaming A16's design is solid in all senses of the word. It might not turn heads, but it'll survive being knocked about. | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nPerformance | For 1080p gaming, the Asus TUF Gaming A16 does a good job of playing modern games. | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 |\nBattery life | Over 10 hours of (admittedly) light use for a gaming laptop is excellent, and it's mainly thanks to the efficient AMD hardware. | \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 |\n\ud83d\udcbb With the TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition, Asus has gone with all-AMD hardware for this reasonably priced gaming laptop. It mostly works, with both decent gaming performance and great battery life. However, I feel that if your budget can stretch a bit further, a gaming laptop with Nvidia's RTX 4060 GPU is still marginally the better choice. Read the full review: Asus TUF Gaming A16 Advantage Edition\nOther laptops to consider\nNew laptops are launched every month, and while this guide has the very best of the best, there are many alternatives which are worth checking out, even if they didn't quite manage to make it on to our main best laptops list.\nHere are some honorable mentions of other laptops we've tested that are worth checking out:\n- HP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch: The HP Chromebook Plus is a smooth and fast performer with a great build quality and premium feel. It handles light productivity, streaming and gaming with aplomb, barely putting a foot wrong. Read the full HP Chromebook Plus 15.6-inch review\n- Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition: While the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition shines in portability, a few design choices may leave you disappointed. However, those willing to overlook the quirks will find a remarkably lightweight and slim device featuring a stunning 2K IPS touchscreen that looks fantastic and Dolby Atmos-compatible speakers that sound just as good. Read the full Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Aura Edition review\n- Apple MacBook Air 15-inch (M4): While we've included the 13-inch MacBook Air with M4 chip in our main list, the 15-inch model is also worth considering if you prefer a bigger screen to work on. It lacks the portability of the smaller model, but otherwise it offers the same great design and performance. Read the full Apple MacBook Air 15-inch (M4) review\nHow to choose the best laptop for you:\nWhat are the best laptop brands? The best brands for laptops include Apple, Dell, Lenovo and HP, and they all have their strengths. For example, Apple make brilliantly-designed slim and light laptops, while Dell does a great range of high-end ultrabooks, as well as affordable devices and Chromebooks as well. Lenovo's well known for making solidly-built business laptops (and some great 2-in-1 laptops as well), and HP\u2019s also been making some gorgeous laptops recently that are some of the best laptops in the world.\nWhen it comes to gaming, the best laptop brands include Alienware, Asus and Acer.\nHow much RAM does a laptop need? RAM (Random Access Memory) is an important specification to look for in a laptop. You\u2019ll want 4GB at the very least for a Windows laptop \u2013 though we\u2019d actually recommend for many people to go for 8GB. That will ensure that the laptop runs well for years to come. Budget Chromebooks can get away with less RAM, such as 1GB or 2GB.\nBattery life considerations Finally there\u2019s battery life. This is likely to be one of the most important considerations you have when choosing what laptop to buy. The best laptops need to be able to let you work - and play - for hours on end without you having to scramble for a power adapter. Modern laptops are getting ever more power-efficient, which has led to longer battery lives. For a laptop to be included in our best laptops list, it needs to offer a battery life of five hours or more.\nWhat to look for\nBattery life: The best thing about laptops is that they allow you to break free from your desk and use them almost anywhere - which is why checking the battery life is essential. For pure battery life, Chromebooks are the best laptops you can buy \u2013 but Apple\u2019s latest MacBooks with M1, M2, M3, and brand-new M4 chips come close, offering well over 10 hours of battery life. Meanwhile, gaming laptops usually sacrifice battery life for performance instead.\nPerformance: When looking to buy the best laptop for your needs, you should consider the performance a potential purchase offers. You don\u2019t want to be stuck with a laptop that starts lagging after a few years. For Windows laptops, look to get one with a modern 14th generation (or 13th) Intel processor, or AMD Ryzen 7000 series. With a MacBook, go for an M2, M3, or new M4 model (for MacBook Pros) \u2013 which are Apple\u2019s powerful chips made specially for its laptops.\nYou should also go for a minimum of 8GB of RAM, though 16GB is more future-proof. Recently, Microsoft suggested that 16GB of RAM would be the minimum requirement for the next generation of 'AI laptops'. For Chromebooks, however, 4GB of RAM is fine.\nWhich type of laptop is best for you?\nGeneral laptops: When it comes to the best cheap laptops, these devices focus more on practicality than style, portability or power. That\u2019s not to say they can\u2019t be fast, but you\u2019ll typically find a non-Ultrabook clamshell laptop with an HD screen and spinning drive-based storage for less than $600 or \u00a3400. It's here where you often find the best laptop deals, too.\nUltrabooks: Where you\u2019ll find thin-and-light notebooks sporting SSD storage and display resolutions that exceed 1080p. Paired with powerful, albeit mobile-centric components and especially long battery life, the best Ultrabooks will cost a pretty penny \u2013 $700 or \u00a3500 to $2,000 or \u00a31,800.\n2-in-1 laptops: The best 2-in-1 laptops double as tablets and are outfitted with both detachable and 360-degree rotating hinges, these hybrids are the most versatile way to experience Windows 10 (or Chrome OS) on a touchscreen.\nChromebooks: The best Chromebooks, running Chrome OS, do much of what Windows and macOS can in the browser, focused on cloud storage over local, while recently getting Android app support for touchscreen models. They generally cost less than $300 or \u00a3200 and some can even withstand a slight tussle.\nGaming laptops: Need a laptop to play games (almost) just like a shiny desktop PC can? Then you\u2019ll want one of the best gaming laptops. These machines generally cost from $800 or \u00a3600 to upwards of $3,000 or \u00a32,800 and they\u2019ll likely be the ones to take advantage of AMD\u2019s laptop-grade Ryzen processors first. If you're really on a budget, then you can check out the best cheap gaming laptop deals.\nLaptop-tablet hybrids: Designed from the tablet-first approach to laptop-tablet hybrids, the best Windows tablets pack beyond-HD touchscreens, sometimes with kickstands in their frames or provided via keyboard covers. These generally shine with a stylus and range from the budget to the premium price ranges.\nWhat I'm looking for\nEvery year, hundreds of laptops are released, but only the very best get to make it onto this list. So, what makes a laptop good enough for me to recommend them in our best laptops guide?\nI\u2019ve been updating TechRadar\u2019s best laptops page for almost 10 years, and here are the things I look for when deciding what devices should be on this page \u2013 and where.\nValue for money\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThis is probably the most important consideration when it comes to picking the best laptops to recommend to you. No matter if it\u2019s a powerful gaming laptop that costs thousands of dollars, or a humble budget Chromebook, each device needs to justify its price tag by excelling in the tasks it\u2019s designed for.\nBattery life\nThis is another hugely important consideration for many people when looking to buy a new laptop. One of the best things about laptops is how portable they are \u2013 but if you need to always look out for a power outlet to keep using your device, then you\u2019re going to get very annoyed very quickly.\n\u25bc\nOf course, battery life expectations will vary depending on the type of laptop. For Chromebooks and modern MacBooks, a time of around 10 to 20 hours between charges should be expected.\nWindows laptops based on AMD or Intel hardware should expect around 10 hours on a single charge, but the latest range of Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered Windows laptops, also known as \u2018Copilot+ PC\u2019 devices, should offer battery lives similar to Chromebooks and MacBooks.\nGaming laptops, however, will typically offer around four to eight hours of battery life. This is because they value performance over efficiency, and their high-powered components can quickly deplete any battery when playing games. These gaming laptops, along with powerful workstation laptops often known as \u2018desktop replacements\u2019 are usually designed to be used while plugged in. However, you should expect at least a few hours of battery life for when you\u2019re using the laptop for less strenuous tasks such as emailing and editing documents.\nSpecifications\nWhen reviewing laptops, I also look at the hardware within the device \u2013 often known as the hardware specifications. This can give you a good idea of how well the laptop will perform, whether or not it\u2019s good value for money, and if the laptop will be future-proof.\n\u25bc\nWhen reviewing laptops, I also look at the hardware within the device \u2013 often known as the hardware specifications. This can give you a good idea of how well the laptop will perform, whether or not it\u2019s good value for money, and if the laptop will be future-proof.\nWhen I say \u2018future-proof\u2019 what I mean is that if you buy a laptop, you won\u2019t need to upgrade or buy a new one for a long time. A laptop with old hardware might be cheaper, but if you feel the need to buy a new laptop after only a year or so, it\u2019ll cost you more in the long run.\nDepending on the type of laptop you\u2019re looking for, the hardware specifications will vary. For standard Windows 11 laptops, I recommend 8GB RAM as a minimum, but ideally 16GB, 512GB of storage and a current generation Intel or AMD processor.\nIf you want to make use of on-device AI tools, like image generation, then you\u2019ll want to look at the new range of \u2018Copilot+ PCs\u2019. These laptops meet certain criteria set by Microsoft so they can make use of AI features in Windows 11, such as having 16GB of RAM and a dedicated NPU (neural processing unit) that\u2019s capable of 40 trillion processes a second (TOPS).\nIf that\u2019s a lot of jargon, don\u2019t worry as these laptops will be clearly labelled with Copilot+ PC branding, which means they come with the right hardware.\nWhen looking for a MacBook, you\u2019ll want to make sure it has a new M-series chip, with the M3 currently being the most recent. Entry level MacBooks come with 8GB memory and 256GB SSD, and while this is OK, I recommend going for 16GB and 512GB if you can afford it, as that will ensure it keeps running well for years to come.\nAs ChromeOS, which Chromebooks use as an operating system, isn\u2019t as demanding a bit of software as Windows 11 and macOS, it means Chromebooks don\u2019t need as high specifications \u2013 and that\u2019s why they are often quite a bit cheaper than laptops and MacBooks.\nSo, an older processor, 4GB of RAM and even just 64GB of storage (due to Chromebooks using a lot of cloud-based services) should get you decent performance on a budget Chromebook. However, investing in a Chromebook with 8GB of RAM, a larger SSD and new processor will give you a much better experience.\nDesign\nWhen picking laptops for this guide, I\u2019m looking for products with stylish yet functional designs. Laptops should be compact enough to carry around with you easily, while also being comfortable to use for long periods.\nThe design should also feel solid and dependable, being able to withstand knocks, drops and scratches.\nHow we tested these laptops\nHow we test the best laptops\nWe understand that a new laptop is a significant investment, so each laptop on our list has been thoroughly tested by our team (read more on how we test laptops). We integrate these laptops into our daily routines to evaluate their performance comprehensively, in addition to running industry standard benchmarks like GeekBench, PCMark, 3DMark, and the latest PC gaming benchmarks.\nOur assessment includes examining a laptop\u2019s design, with special attention paid to the aesthetics, portability, and overall comfort for everyday use. We also consider any additional accessibility and security features like haptic feedback, key backlighting, fingerprint scanning or facial recognition, and physical privacy shutters for the built-in webcam.\nOn the performance side, we use a combination of real-world tasks and synthetic benchmarks to determine the laptops' capabilities. We test all laptops in a given model year using the same benchmark versions to ensure consistent comparisons across reviews for the laptops you might be considering. And since benchmark scores can sometimes be difficult to interpret, we leverage our expertise to explain these scores for you to help you compare the performance of competing laptops in easy-to-understand terms.\nBattery life is another critical factor we measure. We track how long we can use each laptop before needing to recharge. Additionally, we perform our own battery life test, which involves looping a 1080p movie until the battery depletes, a proprietary web surfing script, and the PC Mark 10 battery life benchmark, which simulates real-world usage such as web browsing and document creation. These tests provide us with a clear understanding of the battery longevity for each laptop.\nFinally, we consolidate all our findings and compare them to the laptop\u2019s price, determining if it offers the best value for customers.\nTested by\nEvery laptop in this guide has been thoroughly, and independently, tested by our team of laptop experts, including members of TechRadar's computing team, as well as experienced freelance reviewers.

Can it fend off a Microsoft's latest thin and light Surface Laptop 13-inch?\nPros\n- M4 chip delivers top-notch performance\n- Design is still the best\n- All-day battery life\n- Lower price\nCons\n- Apple Intelligence is still a mixed bag\nNow that the Microsoft Surface Laptop 13-inch is on sale, there\u2019s naturally going to be people looking at the Surface Laptop 13-inch versus the MacBook Air 13-inch (M4) when weighing their next laptop purchase.\nWithout a doubt, these are two of the best laptops going\u2014especially for students who are looking for the best student laptop for the coming school year\u2014and those who like to get work done on the go, whether that\u2019s at a cafe, on a train, a plane, or sitting in a doctor\u2019s office waiting for an appointment.\nThese two laptops are all about portability without compromising too much in other areas like design, battery life, or performance, so they really are two of the best 13-inch laptops you can buy.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re the same, though, as they use two entirely different operating systems, and there are other key differences that potential buyers will need to consider when choosing between the Surface Laptop 13-inch vs MacBook Air 13-inch.\nSurface Laptop 13-inch vs MacBook Air 13-inch: Price\nFortunately, both the Surface Laptop 13-inch and MacBook Air 13-inch are widely available through Microsoft\u2019s and Apple\u2019s websites, so just about every major market globally won\u2019t have to wait for either laptop to make it to their shores.\nPrice here is going to be the biggest difference between the two laptops though, as the Surface Laptop 13-inch starts at $899.99 / \u00a31,039 / AU$1,699, whereas the latest MacBook Air 13-inch with M4 starts at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,699.\nFrom here, the Surface Laptop 13-inch only increases by $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$200 for the expanded storage option (as well as the additional colorways).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe Apple MacBook Air 13-inch, however, can be configured up to $2,199 / \u00a32,199 / AU$3,499 with additional memory and storage options, giving it a much wider range of price points than the Surface Laptop 13-inch.\nThat said, if price is your most pressing concern, there\u2019s no ignoring the roughly 10% cheaper starting price of the Surface Laptop 13-inch, which saves you $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$200 right out the gate for almost identical specs. So let's make the transition to talking about those specs, shall we?\n- Price: Surface Laptop 13-inch\nSurface Laptop 13-inch vs MacBook Air 13-inch: Specs\nThe starting specs for the Microsoft Surface Laptop 13-inch vs Apple MacBook Air 13-inch are functionally identical, other than the system-on-a-chip (SoC) at the heart of the two systems and the quality of the displays.\nBoth Apple\u2019s M-series processors and Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon chips are fabricated using ARM architecture, which is renowned for its energy efficiency, but with the MacBook Air 13-inch, you do have the option of picking a slightly more powerful 10-core GPU.\nModel: | Surface Laptop 13-inch | MacBook Air 13-inch |\n|---|---|---|\nColorways: | Platinum | Sky Blue, Silver, Starlight, Midnight |\nCPU: | Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus (8-core, X1P-46-100) | Apple M4 (10-core) |\nGPU: | Qualcomm Adreno X1-45 | Apple M4 8-Core |\nNPU: | 45 TOPS Qualcomm Hexagon NPU | 38 TOPS Apple Neural Engine |\nMemory: | 16GB LPDDR5X-4300 | 16GB LPDDR5X-7500 |\nStorage: | 256GB SSD | 256GB SSD |\nScreen: | 13-inch, 3:2, 1920x1280p PixelSense display (178 PPI, 60Hz, 400-nit, Touch) | 13.6-inch, 2560 x 1664 Liquid Retina display (224 PPI, 60Hz, 500 nits, non-Touch) |\nPorts: | 2 x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 w/ DP and Power Delivery, 1 x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 1 x combo jack | 2x Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C), 3.5mm headphone jack, MagSafe 3 |\nBattery (WHr): | 50WHr | 53.8WHr |\nWireless: | Wi-Fi 7, BT 5.4 | Wi-Fi 6E, BT 5.3 |\nCamera: | 1080p | 1080p |\nWeight: | 2.7 lbs (1.22 kg) | 2.7 lbs (1.24kg) |\nDimensions: | 11.25 x 8.43 x 0.61 ins | 285.65 x 214.14 x 15.6mm | 11.97 x 8.46 x 0.44 ins | 304 x 215 x 11.3mm |\nWhen it comes to the topline specs available for each system, the MacBook Air 13-inch has substantially more options on offer than the Surface Laptop 13-inch, so if you\u2019re looking to better customize your system to your needs, Apple has you covered much more than Microsoft does.\nModel: | Surface Laptop 13-inch | MacBook Air 13-inch |\n|---|---|---|\nColorways: | Platinum, Violet, Ocean | Sky Blue, Silver, Starlight, Midnight |\nCPU: | Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus (8-core, X1P-46-100) | Apple M4 (10-core) |\nGPU: | Qualcomm Adreno X1-45 | Apple M4 (10-Core) |\nNPU: | 45 TOPS Qualcomm Hexagon NPU | 38 TOPS Apple Neural Engine |\nMemory: | 16GB LPDDR5X-4300 | 32GB LPDDR5X-7500 |\nStorage: | 512GB SSD | 2TB SSD |\nScreen: | 13-inch, 3:2, 1920x1280p PixelSense display (178 PPI, 60Hz, 400-nit, Touch) | 13.6-inch, 2560 x 1664 Liquid Retina display (224 PPI, 60Hz, 500 nits, non-Touch) |\nPorts: | 2 x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 w/ DP and Power Delivery, 1 x USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, 1 x combo jack | 2x Thunderbolt 4 (USB-C), 3.5mm headphone jack, MagSafe 3 |\nBattery (WHr): | 50WHr | 53.8WHr |\nWireless: | Wi-Fi 7, BT 5.4 | Wi-Fi 6E, BT 5.3 |\nCamera: | 1080p | 1080p |\nWeight: | 2.7 lbs (1.22 kg) | 2.7 lbs (1.24kg) |\nDimensions: | 11.25 x 8.43 x 0.61 ins | 285.65 x 214.14 x 15.6mm | 11.97 x 8.46 x 0.44 ins | 304 x 215 x 11.3mm |\n- Specs: MacBook Air 13-inch\nSurface Laptop 13-inch vs MacBook Air 13-inch: Design\nOn the design front, there\u2019s naturally going to be some subjectivity, but both laptops are exceptionally well-crafted with an aluminum chassis that makes them lightweight and very portable.\nIn terms of color options, Apple saved itself in this regard with its recent release of a sky blue MacBook Air 13-inch, breaking from the more conservative colorway choices of varying shades of silver and black that M2 and M3 models were stuck with.\nI\u2019d argue that Apple had no choice here, however, as colorful, personality-rich laptops like Surface Laptop 7 with its Sapphire colorway effectively shamed the MacBook maker into making a more colorful laptop (something I\u2019ve been banging on about for years).\nHowever, the Surface Laptop 13-inch comes in a pastel-purple Violet colorway, which I have been begging Apple to make ever since before the M2 MacBook launched. For me, that seals the deal in the Surface Laptop 13-inch\u2019s favor, making it the best ultrabook running Windows right now, but I understand if you disagree.\n- Design: Surface Laptop 13-inch\nSurface Laptop 13-inch vs MacBook Air 13-inch: Performance\nNo matter how beautiful the Surface Laptop 13-inch might look, however, it can\u2019t keep up with the MacBook Air 13-inch in terms of performance.\nThe 8-core Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus SoC in the Surface Laptop 13-inch is good enough for everyday performance and productivity tasks, but the M4 chip is simply better in just about every workload you can throw at it.\nEven the MacBook Air 13-inch with an M3 chip is a better performer, and given how Apple\u2019s app ecosystem has now moved over to supporting Apple\u2019s M-series processors, you don\u2019t run into the same kind of performance and compatibility issues with a MacBook Air 13-inch that you do with the Surface Laptop 13-inch.\nWindows apps are overwhelmingly designed to run on the x86 architecture used in both Intel and AMD chips, which power over 90% of the best Windows laptops. In order to run these apps on an Arm-based chip like the Snapdragon X Plus, Windows needs to use a software layer called Prism to translate x86 apps into ARM apps in real time.\nThis adds resource overhead to many applications, so they won\u2019t run as smoothly as they would on an Intel or AMD chip. In real-world use, this isn\u2019t as big an issue as it sounds, since the Snapdragon X Plus is fast enough that you won\u2019t really \u2018feel\u2019 that slight performance hit, but it is there, and it\u2019s something that the MacBook Air 13-inch simply doesn\u2019t have to worry about.\n- Performance: MacBook Air 13-inch (M4)\nSurface Laptop 13-inch vs MacBook Air 13-inch: Software\nThe biggest difference between the MacBook Air 13-inch vs Surface Laptop 13-inch is going to be the kind of software available. The Surface Laptop 13-inch runs an Arm-native version of Windows 11, while the MacBook Air 13-inch runs macOS Sequoia.\nMost popular apps like Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Office 365 will have different versions that are compatible with both operating systems, so in most cases, you\u2019re likely going to be able to run the apps you want on either laptop, but there will be instances where that is not the case. Most PC games, for instance, do not have macOS versions (especially older titles).\nThat said, many Windows-exclusive apps are designed for x86 chips like the Intel Core Ultra 200 series and AMD Ryzen AI 300 series, so those apps will need to be run using the Windows Prism emulation layer, and sometimes that doesn\u2019t work very well.\nWhat\u2019s more, there will be times when a Windows app just won\u2019t run at all on the Surface Laptop 13-inch\u2019s Snapdragon X Plus SoC, even with Prism emulation, and you might have to wait until the software developer releases an ARM-native version of the app.\nAnd while 99.9% of the time you won\u2019t need to worry about compatibility issues, a 0.1% chance still exists that the app you want or possibly need to run won\u2019t work, and that\u2019s enough to tip things in Apple\u2019s favor here.\n- Software: MacBook Air 13-inch (M4)\nSurface Laptop 13-inch vs MacBook Air 13-inch: Battery Life\nThe good news is that both offer fantastic battery life since both of these laptops are built using Arm-architected chips, which are renowned for their energy efficiency. That said, in my testing, the Surface Laptop 13-inch lasts over an hour longer than the most recent MacBook Air 13-inch.\nBoth will get you all-day battery life, but the Surface Laptop 13-inch just lasts longer, making it perfect for those who are on the road and away from a wall outlet. The Surface Laptop 13-inch is one of the best student laptops for this reason in particular, as spending a whole day on campus running from classroom to classroom might not give you a chance to recharge your device during the day.\n- Winner: Surface Laptop 13-inch\nSurface Laptop 13-inch vs MacBook Air 13-inch: Verdict\nAs much as I love the Surface Laptop 13-inch for giving me the purple laptop I\u2019ve been begging for, I still have to side with Apple in the end, and I don\u2019t even really like the MacBook Air 13-inch all that much.\nIt might have been different had the Surface Laptop 13-inch used an Intel Lunar Lake chip instead of the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus, which would have eliminated the current growing pains Windows-on-Arm is having and delivered a much more performant device to compete with Apple\u2019s most popular laptop.\nIt doesn\u2019t though, and despite the significant strides Microsoft has made in delivering a true MacBook Air alternative for Windows users, Apple\u2019s MacBook Air 13-inch is still the better overall product.\nIf you\u2019re a dedicated Windows user, don\u2019t despair, though. The Surface Laptop 13-inch is as close as anyone\u2019s come to delivering the MacBook Air experience for Windows that we\u2019ve been waiting for, and you\u2019ll find a lot to love with the Surface Laptop 13-inch. I know I did.\nIf you\u2019re choosing between the two, however, and want to know which one is the better overall purchase, the MacBook Air 13-inch continues its reign as the best laptop for most users.\n- Winner: MacBook Air 13-inch\nYou might also like...\nJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.\nNamed by the CTA as a CES 2020 Media Trailblazer for his science and technology reporting, John specializes in all areas of computer science, including industry news, hardware reviews, PC gaming, as well as general science writing and the social impact of the tech industry.\nYou can find him online on Bluesky @johnloeffler.bsky.social\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nIt's not often that a laptop can challenge the esteemed MacBook Pro 16-inch and survive the battle, but the Dell 16 Premium absolutely holds it's own against the favored laptop of creatives everywhere, often outperforming it in key areas. If you go for the OLED model, however, just know that its battery life is not great, so bring a charger.\nPros\n- +\nOutstanding performance\n- +\nCheaper than MacBook Pro 16-inch\n- +\nGorgeous OLED display option\nCons\n- -\nBattery Life for OLED model is mediocre\n- -\nApple M4 Pro can greatly outperform Intel Arrow Lake chip in some cases\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nDell 16 Premium: One-minute review\nThe Dell 16 Premium is Dell\u2019s newest flagship machine for professionals, creatives, and developers who demand a blend of portability, performance, and polish, and it has a pretty high bar to clear.\nIts predecessor, the Dell XPS 16, was consistently one of the best laptops produced in every year it was available, and a lot of XPS fans were disappointed to hear about its rebranding. But, at the end of the day, that\u2019s really all it is, as the 16 Premium is everything people loved about the XPS 16 in recent years along with some fancy new tricks.\nStarting at $1,799.99 / \u00a31,699 / AU$4,379.10, the Dell 16 Premium isn\u2019t necessarily cheap, but it is fairly in line with similar creative-focused laptops like the MacBook Pro, and given how often Dell has sales on its laptops, you can often find it for much cheaper than the competition.\nThere are a few configuration options available, but you do start off with an Intel Core Ultra 7 255H CPU with Intel Arc 140V graphics, 16GB LPDDR5x RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a 16.3-inch non-touch 2K display. From there, you can add in RTX 5050, RTX 5060, and RTX 5070 GPUs, depending on the region, and configure it up to 64GB memory and 4TB SSD storage (though these options will limit which GPU you can pick).\nRight now, the Dell 16 Premium is on sale starting at $1,549.99 in the US, while the review configuration is available for $2,799.99, a $400 discount.\nWhat truly sets it apart, though, is the outstanding 16.3-inch 4K OLED touchscreen with 120Hz refresh rate, perfect for high-res content creation, editing, and media consumption, though the OLED display will substantially cut into the device\u2019s battery life.\nWith premium build quality, great speakers, and modern I/O, this laptop nails almost everything it sets out to do, though its borderless touchpad and keyless function bar design remain controversial.\nAll that said, chances are you\u2019re really looking for performance with this laptop, and here, the unit I reviewed often ran circles around the competing MacBook Pro 16-inch with M4 Pro, especially in creative workloads where the MacBook Pro\u2019s strong industry reputation does a lot of heavy lifting. In this regard, the Dell 16 Premium is easily the best laptop for creative pros who want MacBook Pro performance on a Windows 11 device.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nDell 16 Premium: Price & availability\n- How much does it cost? Starts at $1,799.99 / \u00a31,699 / AU$4,379.10\n- When is it available? It's available now\n- Where can you get it? You can buy it in the US, UK, and Australia through Dell\u2019s website and other retailers.\nThe Dell 16 Premium is available now in the US, UK, and Australia through Dell\u2019s official website and major retailers. Prices start at $1,799 in the US, \u00a31,699 in the UK, and AU$4,379.10 in Australia.\nUpgrading the configuration can significantly increase the price, but even when the price is maxed out, the highest level configuration is still substantially less than a competing MacBook Pro 16-inch with M4 Pro, much less one with an M4 Max chip.\n- Value: 4 / 5\nDell 16 Premium: Specs\n- Up to RTX 5070 GPU\n- Up to Thunderbolt 5\n- Wi-Fi 7\nDell offers multiple configurations of the Dell 16 Premium laptop across different regions. The starting models include a Core Ultra 7 processor, 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, 512GB SSD, and integrated Intel Arc graphics (Australia starts with an RTX 5050 GPU), as well as a 2K IPS non-touch display.\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | US | UK | Australia |\n|---|---|---|---|\nPrice | |||\nCPU | Intel Core Ultra 7 255H | Intel Core Ultra 7 255H | Intel Core Ultra 7 255H |\nGPU | Integrated Intel Arc 140T | Integrated Intel Arc 140T | Nvidia RTX 5050 |\nMemory | 16GB LPDDR5x - 7467MT/s | 16GB LPDDR5x - 7467MT/s | 16GB LPDDR5x - 7467MT/s |\nStorage | 512GB PCIe NVMe | 512GB PCIe NVMe | 512GB PCIe NVMe |\nDisplay | 16.3-inch non-touch 2K IPS 120Hz | 16.3-inch non-touch 2K IPS 120Hz | 16.3-inch non-touch 2K IPS 120Hz |\nPorts | 1 x 3.5mm combo jack, 3 x Thunderbolt 4 Gen 2 (DP 2.1, Power Delivery), 1 x microSDXC 7.1 | 1 x 3.5mm combo jack, 3 x Thunderbolt 4 Gen 2 (DP 2.1, Power Delivery), 1 x microSDXC 7.1 | 1 x 3.5mm combo jack, 3 x Thunderbolt 4 Gen 2 (DP 2.1, Power Delivery), 1 x microSDXC 7.1 |\nBattery | 99.5WHr | 99.5WHr | 99.5WHr |\nWireless | Wi-Fi 7, BT 5.4 | Wi-Fi 7, BT 5.4 | Wi-Fi 7, BT 5.4 |\nCamera | 1080p IR camera | 1080p IR camera | 1080p IR camera |\nWeight | 4.56 lbs | 2.06kg | 4.56 lbs | 2.06kg | 4.56 lbs | 2.06kg |\nDimensions | 14.1 x 9.4 x 0.75 ins | 358.1 x 240 x 19mm | 14.1 x 9.4 x 0.75 ins | 358.1 x 240 x 19mm | 14.1 x 9.4 x 0.75 ins | 358.1 x 240 x 19mm |\nThe max spec on the 16 Premium vary by region, with the US topping out at an RTX 5070 GPU, which also comes with three Thunderbolt 5 ports rather than the three Thunderbolt 4 ports on RTX 5060 models and lower. In the UK and Australia, there are no RTX 5070 configurations available yet, but they do max out with a 4TB PCIe SSD.

The same borderless trackpad and keyless function bar remain from the XPS, and for the most part, the form factor is essentially unchanged.\nThe touchbar is definitely one of the more controversial design choices of the Dell 16 Premium, held over from the earlier XPS redesign from 2023. It's a bit of an accessibility challenge for those who struggle with low vision, as the only thing that indicates where a given function key is is a backlit label on a completely smooth and flat glossy surface.\nEven if you don't have limited vision though, if there's an especially bright light (say, a sunny day outside), finding any given F-key might be challenging.\nLikewise, the borderless trackpad isn't great either, and for similar reasons. It takes some time to learn and figure out where exactly the trackpad is, but once you do, it works pretty well.\nThe keyboard is ok. It's never been the best feature on the Dell XPS line, but it's not terrible and functions well enough.\nFor ports, you get at least three Thunderbolt 4 Gen 2 ports, a MicroSD card slot, and a 3.5mm combo jack. This is about as much as you can expect on a chassis this size, and while it would be nice to have a USB-A port, there is an adapter dongle that you can buy while configuring your laptop (about $35) that lets you get HDMI 2.0 and USB-A 3.0 connectivity if your have a mouse and monitor that require it.\nThe audio is pretty good on the 16 Premium, largely thanks to the top-firing speakers, but it's not spectacular. If you plan on working on audio projects, a headset would be advised.\nThe webcam is a 1080p IR camera, meaning that it's compatible with Windows Hello, and it's fairly good for video conferencing and the like. That said, it lacks a physical privacy shutter, which isn't really acceptable in 2025, so I have to take some points off for that.\nWhile it might seem like I have a lot of complaints about the design of the 16 Premium, I only highlight the above issues because they are somewhat controversial in some corners, as is the rebranding away from XPS to Premium.\nI get those concerns, but in my estimation, this is an exceptionally built laptop, and the issues I have with it don't detract that much from the overall quality of the device. If you opt for the OLED panel rather than the base IPS, pretty much every other consideration feels like nitpicking for a device that looks and feels great\u2014better than the MacBook Pro in many ways.\n- Design: 4 / 5\nDell 16 Premium: Performance\n- Often outperforms the MacBook Pro 16-inch with M4 Pro\n- Discrete RTX GPU embarrasses the MacBook Pro in several workloads\n- Not a bad gaming laptop either\nUltimately, if you're paying this much for this laptop, performance is going to be front of mind, especially since this is really targeted toward the MacBook Pro creative crowd.\nIn that regard, the 16 Premium might even be a better creative laptop than the MacBook Pro 16-inch, despite the strong performance of the MacBook Pro 16-inch in some areas.\nIn terms of synthetic CPU performance, the MacBook Pro 16-inch with M4 Pro greatly outperforms the Dell 16 Premium in workloads like GeekBench 6.4.\nHowever, once you start adding in real-world tests that actually test its performance in workloads creatives and gamers are actually interested in, the MacBook Pro only wins out in our PugetBench Photoshop benchmarks. Otherwise, the RTX 5070 GPU in the 16 Premium wrecks the MacBook Pro 16-inch just about everywhere else.\nNow, the MacBook Pro 16-inch can be configured with an M4 Max chip, which might substantially change the comparative assessment, but it would add more than a grand to the price you'd pay compared to the best Dell 16 Premium.\nPlus, even though the MacBook Pro 16 can now play Cyberpunk 2077 natively, Macs just aren't serious PC gaming devices. They've come a long way in recent years, but you simply don't have anything concerns about that with the Dell 16 Premium. If a game is on Steam, the Dell 16 Premium will be able to play it, something that even the best MacBook will never be able to claim.\n- Performance: 5 / 5\nDell 16 Premium: Battery Life\n- How long does it last on a single charge? 5 hours, 18 minutes\nSo, there is a major caveat when it comes to battery life on the 16 Premium unit I tested. OLED displays are notoriously unforgiving toward battery life. Add in the power-hungry RTX 5070 GPU, and we are really talking about battery life that is just slightly better than you'd find with the best gaming laptops.\nWith a max battery life of about 9 hours, according to Dell, the OLED configuration cannot keep pace with the MacBook Pro 16-inch, which can make it about 20 hours on a charge in our testing. In my testing, the Dell 16 Premium only gets about 5 hours in mixed use, and at best, about 2.5 hours under heavy load.\nOf course, the MacBook Pro 16-inch isn't going to make it 20 hours if it's playing Shadow of the Tomb Raider or rendering a 4K video overnight on battery power, so the difference between the two laptops is probably closer than my tests show. But there's no getting around the fact that the MacBook Pro 16-inch is going to last far longer than the Dell 16 Premium, and that's something to consider.\n- Battery Life: 3 / 5\nShould you buy the Dell 16 Premium?\nCategory | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Premium priced, but delivers excellent performance and features | 4 / 5 |\nSpecs | Lots of options, including powerful GPUs with Thunderbolt 5 and a gorgeous OLED display. | 5 / 5 |\nDesign | Though it has great port selection, display, and aesthetics, there are legacy issues from its XPS heritage. | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Simply outstanding performance across every workload, beating out the MacBook Pro 16-inch in all but a few cases. | 5 / 5 |\nBattery Life | Not great if you get an OLED panel, but better than other similar laptops with its specs. | 3 / 5 |\nFinal Score | On balance, if the Dell 16 Premium fixed some of its design issues, it would be a true MacBook Pro killer, but it does battle Apple's best to a draw. | 4.3 / 5 |\nBuy the Dell 16 Premium if...\nYou want a high-performance laptop with discrete graphics\nWith up to an RTX 5070, the Dell 16 Premium has outstanding configuration options for top-tier performance.\nYou need a stunning OLED display for creative work\nThe OLED display option is simply gorgeous and fantastic for creative pros.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou need long battery life\nThe battery life on the 16 Premium is not great, but it's in line with what you'd expect for an OLED laptop.\nYou're on a tight budget\nThe base spec for this laptop starts out expensive and only gets pricier the better you configure it.\nAlso consider\nApple MacBook Pro 16-inch\nIf you're considering the Dell 16 Premium, the only other laptop worth considering is the MacBook Pro 16-inch, especially if you're a creative pro.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Pro 16-inch (M4 Pro) review\nHow I tested the Dell 16 Premium\n- I spent about two weeks with the Dell 16 Premium\n- I used it for everyday work and creative tasks\n- I ran it through our standard battery of benchmark tests\nI used the Dell 16 Premium for everyday work and creative tasks for about two weeks, including writing this review and editing all the photos therein on the device.\nI put it through our standard battery of benchmark tests, as well as used it for everything from creative work to gaming to really push it to its limits.\nI've tested several dozen laptops for TechRadar over the past several years, so I am very familiar with what makes a laptop a great value for its market, and my extensive experience gives me insight that lets me better assess its benchmark results.\n- First reviewed August 2025\nJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.\nNamed by the CTA as a CES 2020 Media Trailblazer for his science and technology reporting, John specializes in all areas of computer science, including industry news, hardware reviews, PC gaming, as well as general science writing and the social impact of the tech industry.\nYou can find him online on Bluesky @johnloeffler.bsky.social\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nI\u2019m not sure Dell marketing has the name of this product up to the speed that XPS and Latitude once meant. This hardware offers exceptional battery life, but it\u2019s not a great CPU and is expensive for a machine that doesn't feel robust. A good option, then, for many business pros and PC users, though the security features may be overkill for non-business users.\nPros\n- +\nLatest Intel silicon\n- +\nHigh-quality webcam\n- +\nExceptional battery life\n- +\nLightweight frame\n- +\nCollaboration touchpad\n- +\nGreat keyboard\n- +\nAI built-in (Intelligent privacy, onlooker detection, etc.)\n- +\nExcellent connectivity (5G, Wi-Fi 7E, Bluetooth 5.4)\nCons\n- -\nUnderwhelming CPU performance\n- -\nExpensive\n- -\nNot XPS build quality\n- -\nLimited upgrades\n- -\nThe collaboration touchpad is limited\n- -\nThe display is good, but not great\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nDell Pro 14 Premium: 30-second review\nFor those not in the loop, Dell has rebranded its XPS, Latitude and Inspiron lines to Dell, Dell Pro and Dell Pro Max. The new line-up is Dell, Dell Pro, and Dell Pro Max.\nSo, this laptop is the Dell Pro 14-inch Premium model, which would have been previously a Latitude family laptop. The \u2018premium\u2019 is Dell\u2019s subtle way of building expectations that this won\u2019t be cheap.\nAs a top-end ultra laptop design, it sports the latest Intel Core Ultra 200 series processor with vPro, 60Wh of battery capacity, a 14-inch 400nit display, and up to 32GB of LPDDR5x memory.\nIn terms of mobile platforms, this is the pinnacle of what Intel has to offer, and it delivers exceptional battery life accordingly. That\u2019s a feature you can bank on, but the performance of this machine is less impressive for other purposes, even if Dell heavily pushes its Copilot credentials.\nThis reviewer was also somewhat disappointed by the build quality, because while the chassis of this machine uses 90% reclaimed magnesium, to keep weight down, it's remarkably thin metal.\nThat raises questions about durability for a front-line device and what might happen to it when it's deployed in the office. When you consider how much the review machine costs, having extended coverage on this machine might be worth the extra money.\nOverall, the Dell Pro 14 Premium will last a long time without a charge. Its single-thread performance is good, but it\u2019s not a great multi-threaded platform. And, if the thought of spending $2600 on a laptop is overly shocking, then maybe something without a Core Ultra 7 processor might better suit you.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nThe lack of raw performance in the 200 series, overall build quality, and price makes it unlikely to be included in our round-up of the best business laptops.\nDell Pro 14 Premium: Price and availability\n- How much does it cost? From $2030/\u00a31,770\n- When is it out? Available now\n- Where can you get it? Direct from Dell\nA Dell feature, the Pro 14 Premium comes in a range of SKUs, and those SKUs aren\u2019t the same in every region.\nThe base model offers an Intel Core Ultra 5 236V vPro CPU, 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, non-touch FHD+ IPS 14-inch display for \u00a31,769.4 in the UK and $2029 in the US. At the other end of the scale is a machine with the Intel Core Ultra 7 268V vPro, 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage and the same screen for \u00a32383.98 in the UK. For US customers, it comes with only 512GB of storage and costs $2,559. Elevating it to the 1TB storage capacity increases the price to $2661.50.\nDell has promised a higher-resolution OLED display with touch later in the year, but what price impact this option might have is unclear.\nTo put this into perspective, Acer has the Swift 14 AO Touch-screen SF14-61T built around the excellent AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 processor for only \u00a31,499.99 with the same amount of RAM, memory and storage.\nLenovo has the ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition (review coming soon), which has the same CPU, memory and storage as the Pro 14 Premium, but with a dramatically better OLED display costs only \u00a31,900 or $2,041.55.\nI could list more alternatives, but the price of this laptop is far too high for the specifications it offers.\nObviously, corporations will pay less than the retail costs for these machines, but that's also true of the cheaper competitor options.\n- Value: 3 / 5\nDell Pro 14 Premium: Specs\nItem | Spec |\n|---|---|\nHardware: | Dell Pro 14 Premium (PA13250) |\nCPU: | Intel Core Ultra 7 268V vPro |\nGPU: | Intel Arc 140V GPU |\nNPU: | Intel NPU |\nRAM: | 32 GB LPDDR5x SDRAM 8533 MT/s |\nStorage: | 1TB M.2 NVMe SSD PVC10 SK Hynix |\nScreen: | 14.0-inch 16:10 FHD+, (1920x1200), IPS Non-Touch, 400 nits |\nPorts: | 2x Thunderbolt 4 USB-C, 1x USB 3.2 Gen 1 USB-C with power share, 1x HDMI 2.1, Audio Combo Jack |\nCamera: | 8MP HDR + IR Camera with Presence Detection, Temporal NoiseReduction, Camera Shutter, Microphone |\nNetworking: | Intel BE201 Wi-Fi 7 2x2, Bluetooth 5.4 |\nDimensions: | 311.2 \u00d7 216.7 \u00d7 17.95 mm |\nWeight: | 1.141 kg |\nOS: | Windows 11 Pro (pre-installed) |\nBattery: | 3 Cell, 60 Wh, Li-ion, ExpressCharge 1.0, ExpressCharge Boost |\nPower supply: | 64.98W (19V 3.42A) |\nDell Pro 14 Premium: Design\n- Magnesium exterior\n- Mini-LED keyboard\n- Limited ports\nI\u2019d like to admit now that I own a 2012 Dell XPS that I bought, and the skin of that laptop is almost entirely aluminium. I mention that because while the Dell Pro 14 Premium is fashioned mostly from magnesium, this laptop feels much less durable.\nAlongside that magnesium chassis, you'll find a good port selection, solid camera, great built-in and helpful AI, a solid screen, and some cool features I wish every laptop had.\nDeploying the digital callipers, I determined that the thickness of the skin is typically about 1.3mm, enabling the entire removable underside to weigh just 117g. That\u2019s good for the weight, but compared to my ageing Dell XPS and its 2.5 mm-thick aluminium, the magnesium might be as strong, but it feels less substantial.\nOpening the machine, Dell used a keyboard with large key tops and zero gutters between them, and each key had a mini LED that illuminated the symbol. The key to travel is relaxed, giving enough feedback that I can type accurately but not so much travel that I get fatigued when typing for extended periods.\nWhile I will still say that the Apple touchpads on their laptops are the absolute gold standard, this touchpad is quite good and has a trick up its sleeve with the collaboration features baked into the top, though I wish this would work with more meeting platforms like Google Meet.\nBracketing the keyboard are two speaker vents, and there are two more on the underside at the front, creating a total of four sources for audio.\nThe power button features a fingerprint sensor, but users might prefer to use the decent webcam in the Pro 14 Premium, which has a Windows Hello-compliant design built to identify users quickly.\nMany laptop makers have done well selling docking stations to corporate customers, and this laptop was designed to elicit more of those purchases.\nThe left side has an HDMI port, a single Thunderbolt and a 3.5mm audio jack, whereas the right side has another Thunderbolt port, a single USB 3.2 Type-A port, and a security slot.\nMy positive take on this arrangement is that you can add a second screen without a dock. However, since one of the Thunderbolt ports will be used for charging, you will still need one if you have multiple USB-C devices or want to access a wired network.\nSome other great features that I find myself wishing I had on other laptops would have to be the built-in AI privacy tools like onlooker detection, look-away detection, and safe shutter that allows for manual blocking of the camera to give peace of mind that you won't accidentally show too much when joining a camera while working from home with a business professional top and your underwear down low.\nThe overall form factor of the Dell Pro 14-inch premium laptop is impressive. It's sleek, easy to hold and carry, and lightweight. I can toss it in my backpack and forget that it's there, yet it has power when I need it.\nBut to be brutally honest, the general feel of the Dell Pro 14 Premium is of a laptop that is in the region of $1000-1500, and not up to $1000 more than that price range.\nObviously, though, that doesn\u2019t take into account some of the technology that\u2019s inside, which is the latest from Intel. Overall, this design doesn\u2019t give this reviewer a Premium vibe, or justify its cost.\n- Design: 3 / 5\nDell Pro 14 Premium: Hardware\n- Intel Core Ultra 200 series CPU\n- Average screen\n- Limited upgrades\nThe story of the Core Ultra series processors has been a problematic gestation for Intel, and how badly it has been received might well have convinced Pat Gelsinger to exit stage left into retirement.\nThe problems that new Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan inherited won\u2019t be fixed overnight, as architecturally, the 300 and 400 series are already set in stone, or silicon, at this point.\nThe Intel Core Ultra 7 268V vPro in our review machine is almost at the pinnacle of the Core Ultra 200 series mobile parts, and according to Intel, it features \u201cthe latest generation of P-core, E-core, and low-power E-core architectures, advanced NPU AI Engines, and available with built-in Intel\u00ae Graphics or Intel\u00ae Arc\u2122 GPUs1 driven by Xe2 architecture for discrete-level graphics performance.\u201d\nExcept these mobile parts only have P-cores and low-power E-cores, and in this context, only four of each, giving up to eight threads in total, since Intel did away with hyperthreading.\nWhen you realise that some of the last Core series mobile chips had twenty-thread processing, this seems a retrograde step and a big one at that.\nAs we\u2019ll get into with the benchmarks, the single-thread performance of this silicon is decent, but the multi-threaded isn\u2019t, and what Intel did was trade that for power efficiency. The problem is that the best laptop needs to have excellent battery life and performance when required, and at least one leg of this table has been cut short.\nTherefore, unless you are looking for a machine that only delivers exceptional battery life and never needs raw power, this probably isn\u2019t the system you would want.\nSome of the cheaper SKUs in this product range use the lesser Luna Lake CPUs, and these have less AI processing power, can address only 16GB of RAM, have one less Xe GPU core, and lower clocks. The saving of around $200 for an Intel Core Ultra 5 236V isn\u2019t probably worth it, especially because of the memory limits.\nOne of the minor disappointments with this machine is the display. I appreciate 16:10 aspect ratio displays like you'll find here, but it only has a maximum resolution of 1920 x 1200. Its maximum brightness of 400 nits isn\u2019t ideal for outdoor work, although Dell did at least put an anti-glare coating on it. It will work and be fine for business work; the text will look okay. But there are no touch-screen options in this range, and there is no 1440p display either.\nThe panel is reasonably sharp and performed reasonably well in our calibration testing. Its strengths are its decent gamut and high contrast. But it suffers from a lack of luminescence uniformity, being excessively bright in the centre, and while having plenty of colours, they\u2019re not always the most accurate. It achieved 98% of RBG, 75% of AdobeRGB and 75% of P3 colours. It only delivered 54% of the Rec2020 gamut.\nThis screen is fine for office work, but it isn\u2019t anything that might attract a creative worker. For creative professionals or those who care about having a crispy screen, you'll probably best off waiting for the OLED model is slated to arrive in the near-future.\nIn the last part of this section, I want to talk about potential upgrades that this machine might get over its operational life.\nDell engineers made a good stab at making this laptop reasonably easy to get inside, with just seven retained screws and a small spudger between the owner and the internals. However, once you get inside, things get decidedly less helpful.\nAs now seems commonplace, the memory on this unit is surface mounted, meaning that if you want 32GB of RAM, the most on offer, you will need to specify it at purchase. There are only two major components that you can swap, and those are the M.2 NVMe storage device and the battery. A refresh of the battery after a few years of use might well be worth the expense for those who recharge every working day.\nThe real annoyance is that the M.2 slot is only a 2232 scale slot, which limits the capacity and performance that can be placed inside the Pro 14 Premium. If this had been done to leave enough room for another drive, it might have been acceptable, but there are literally acres of unused space on parts of the mainboard that could have seen a 2280 slot or at least a 2242-sized one.\nIn most regions, Dell only offers a 1TB internal drive, which isn\u2019t remotely enough for those who use lots of applications or AI features to work with local models. The lack of drive space is a head-slapping moment for the Dell Pro 14 Premium.\nOverall, with the exception of the battery life, this is a mediocre hardware offering, and Dell made it worse by choosing the smallest M.2 slot. This CPU series supports four Gen 4 PCIe lanes and four Gen 5 lanes; on this machine, most lanes do practically nothing.\n- Hardware: 3.5 / 5\nDell Pro 14 Premium: Performance\nLaptops | Header Cell - Column 1 | Dell Pro 14 Premium | Dell Latitude 9450 |\n|---|---|---|---|\nCPU | Row 0 - Cell 1 | Intel Core Ultra 7 268V | Core 7 Ultra 165U |\nCores/Threads | Row 1 - Cell 1 | 8C 8T | 12C 14T |\nTPD | Row 2 - Cell 1 | 17W-37W | 15W |\nRAM | Row 3 - Cell 1 | 32GB LPDDR5X | 32GB DDR5 (8x 4GB) |\nSSD | Row 4 - Cell 1 | 1TB PVC10 SK Hynix | 512GB Kioxia BG6 |\nGraphics | Row 5 - Cell 1 | Intel Arc 140V GPU | Intel Graphics |\nNPU | Row 6 - Cell 1 | Intel NPU (48 TOPS) | Intel NPU (40 TOPS) |\n3DMark | WildLife | 20,738 | 14,643 |\n| Row 8 - Cell 0 | FireStrike | 9375 | 4676 |\n| Row 9 - Cell 0 | TimeSpy | 4335 | 1453 |\n| Row 10 - Cell 0 | Steel Nomad.L | 2899 | 1149 |\nCineBench23 | Single | 1831 | 1603 |\n| Row 12 - Cell 0 | Multi | 9567 | 7734 |\n| Row 13 - Cell 0 | Ratio | 5.23 | 4.83 |\nCineBench24 | Single | 125 | 97 |\n| Row 15 - Cell 0 | Multi | 665 | 465 |\n| Row 16 - Cell 0 | Ratio | 5.31 | 4.82 |\nGeekBench 6 | Single | 2531 | 1653 |\n| Row 18 - Cell 0 | Multi | 11143 | 6026 |\n| Row 19 - Cell 0 | OpenCL | 30382 | 13892 |\n| Row 20 - Cell 0 | Vulkan | 34370 | 10077 |\nCrystalDIsk | Read MB/s | 6569 | 4997 |\n| Row 22 - Cell 0 | Write MB/s | 5844 | 4363 |\nPCMark 10 | Office | 7232 | 6293 |\n| Row 24 - Cell 0 | Battery | 21h 23m | 19h 18m |\nBattery | Whr | 60 | 60 |\nWEI | Score | 8.8 | 8.2 |\nWith the 200 series Ultra processors, Intel has jumped in with both feet on the power efficiency bandwagon, something that they started to do with the 100 series.\nThis was a response to the battery life that AMD Ryzen mobile processors offered, and with the 12th and 13th generation chips, it was something the chip maker had effectively ignored.\nThe Intel Core Ultra 7 268V vPro in the review machine is at the top of the Luna Lake Core Ultra 7 series, with only the Core Ultra 9 288V above it.\nWith a base clock of 2GHz and a turbo speed of up to 5GHz, it splits the performance and efficiency cores evenly with four of each.\nThe problem with this chip is that when you compare it to older Intel designs, this CPU hasn\u2019t improved its multitasking substantially over the 100 series.\nTo reveal these improvements, I\u2019ve placed the Dell Pro 14 against one of its same-brand predecessors, the Dell Latitude 9450 and its series 100 Core 7 Ultra 165U CPU.\nThe places where the Core Ultra 7 268V is advantageous are mostly in respect of the graphics performance since it has eight Xe cores in the ARC 140V GPU, whereas the Core 7 Ultra 165U has half as many. It\u2019s also significantly better in the single-core mode that can utilise that 5GHz turbo clock.\nHowever, with only eight cores, of which only four are performance, the Core Ultra 7 268V has a major problem when confronted with a multi-threaded problem, something that also plagued the Core 7 Ultra 165U.\nThe Cinebench 23 multitasking score is 9567, which looks decent against the older series 100 CPU. But looking back at even older data, I\u2019ve reviewed at least two laptops that have exceeded that score. The Dell Precision 5470 using the Intel Core i7-12800H CPU and the Framework 7040 with its AMD Ryzen 7 7840U both went faster with scores of 11872 and 13735, respectively.\nMy conclusion is that older Intel Alder Lake processors and previous generation AMD Ryzen mobile chips multitask better than the Core Ultra 7 268V.\nThis chip is undisputedly superior with battery life, where it takes a great score of the Core 7 Ultra 165U and, with the same battery capacity, achieves approximately two hours more. That battery life should convert into at least two working days and possibly the majority of a third if you work the timescales that most Europeans would consider a working day.\nThe problem for Intel is that it is possible to get equivalent battery life using the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite CPU, as seen in the Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6. And, it\u2019s possible to get a machine using these Qualcomm chips for half what Dell is asking for the Dell Pro 14 Premium.\nI wouldn\u2019t read much into this laptop\u2019s having an NPU of 48 over the 40 of the predecessor series since most people won\u2019t be running locally trained AI on a laptop. It can run Microsoft Copilot using the NPU, if you can call that AI, but compared to cloud-based models and processing power, this laptop isn\u2019t a serious AI tool.\n- Performance: 3.5 / 5\nDell Pro 14 Premium: In use\nDuring testing, this laptop has gone with me to the coffee shop to knock out some emails, it went with me on a quick weekend trip to the city, it went with me on an extended trip out of state, it's gone with me into businesses I work with, and it's gone with me all around my home/office.\nIt feels like the Windows version of the ever-so-popular MacBook Airs, especially the M2-M4 series. This laptop is remarkably lightweight and easy to carry around. It's a good computer, especially for those in the professional business space and not so much for the creative space. I wouldn't want to video edit this thing anytime soon. But this thing is an absolute beast for emails, spreadsheets, documents, research, organization, project management, virtual meetings, all-day battery life, and things of that nature.\nI can do all this without worrying about my battery life thanks to the 21.2 hours (estimated) of working time on a single charge. What I frequently find is that when with other computers, I would have to be prepared with a charger close if I know it's going to be an intense workday; when I have the Dell Pro 14 Premium, I can confidently leave the charger in my backpack or even at home, and I can knock out my work wherever I am.\nThe more and more that I find myself switching in and out of laptops, the more I notice that in quick moments of typing and navigating, I use my thumb with my fingers still on the keys to navigate my mouse with my touchpad.\nFeatures work well here, such as the fingerprint scanner on this laptop and the Windows Hello. Like my FaceID on my iPhone, I can look at this laptop and log in (something you still can't do on Mac, sadly), and it's accurate. I tested this feature by putting the face scanner to the test with dozens of other people, and it never worked for anyone but myself.\nTo go back to the touchpad, I love the collaboration feature built-in. I wish it worked with Google Meet (or maybe just any virtual meeting platform) since I am in and out of Google Meet... meetings... all day, every day. But, for the few Zoom meetings I had (sorry, Zoom), I enjoyed the ease of use, especially when multitasking while the meeting was going on.\nAnother huge pro for this computer is the connectivity. The Dell Pro 14 Premium has 5G capability, Wi-Fi 7E, and Bluetooth 5.4 to allow for the best connections available (literally) to external devices. And, since those protocols are backward-compatible, you can still connect to older devices, making this a super easy laptop to work with.\nDell Pro 14 Premium: Final verdict\nIf this machine were still called a Latitude, would I have gone easier on it? Probably not. It has several problems, some of which involve the underlying hardware platform.\nFor most business professionals, the Dell Pro 14 Premium is a fine option. It's got an incredible battery life, and great built-in security features. Having said that, the display is not the absolute best it could be, and performance isn't as high as you'd expect from a laptop sporting the \"premium\" moniker.\nI don\u2019t think the Intel Core Ultra 200 series chips are great, as they sacrifice multitasking performance to achieve power efficiency without considering how people use these systems every day. But for light tasks, they\u2019re good, and the battery life is exceptional.\nMy biggest issue with the Dell Pro 14 Premium is the high price being asked. Putting the words \u201cPro\u201d and \u201cPremium\u201d in the name suggests a design, build and performance level that this hardware doesn\u2019t quite deliver.\nFor those who aren't paying themselves, the cost might be irrelevant, but the Dell Pro 14 Premium doesn't offer great value, looking at the bigger picture.\nShould you buy a Dell Pro 14 Premium?\nValue | Expensive for what technology is in it | 3 / 5 |\nDesign | Mostly plastic, nice backlit keys, limited ports | 3 / 5 |\nHardware | 200 series CPU, DDR5 and ARC GPU make for power efficiency, but almost no upgrades | 3.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Good at single tasks and graphics, less wonderful at multitasking | 3.5 / 5 |\nOverall | Overpriced or underspecified, not great value | 3.5 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou need multi-day battery life\nIn a continuous test, this hardware is approaching working for nearly two working days, not just one. It\u2019s as efficient as a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite system, which is impressive.\nYou use Copilot\nThis is an official Copilot laptop, having been given the blessing of Microsoft and an Intel NPU-capable processor. I\u2019m sure better AI solutions that don\u2019t use local processing are available, but the choice is yours.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou need workstation performance\nCompared to the new Snapdragon X or AMD Ryzen 9 mobile chips, the Ultra Series processors aren't competitive when serious processing is required.\nYou need ports\nThe lack of ports on this machine could be an issue if you do not have a Thunderbolt or USB 4.0 dock. It is possible to get adapters to get LAN ports from the USB-C, but one of the two Thunderbolt ports is needed for charging.\nFor more options, we reviewed the best Dell laptops.\nMark is an expert on 3D printers, drones and phones.

The Dell XPS 14 (2024) was one of the best Dell laptops I've ever reviewed, and the 14 Premium is even better still.\nStarting at $1,499.99 / \u00a31,499 / AU$2,798.40, the 14 Premium matches the starting price of the Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) that it is competing with, though the 14 Premium does max out a bit cheaper than the MacBook Pro 14.\nObviously, you won't get the same kind of performance from the base-spec 14 Premium as you do if you go the discrete graphics, non-OLED route, which starts at $1,999.99 / \u00a31,999 / AU$$3,297.8. Content creators, or those who want one of the best displays you're going to find on a laptop right now, will want to check out the RTX 4050/OLED configurations, which start at $2,199.99 / \u00a32,199 / AU$3,598.10.\nThe Dell 14 Premium is on sale right now, with configurations starting as low as $1,499.99 in the US, with higher-tier configurations marked down more than $250 at Dell's website.\nIf performance is what you're after, the Dell 14 Premium beats out the MacBook Pro 14-inch, overall, in my testing, but it's not a total knockout. Given the performance I've seen from the MacBook Pro 14-inch base-spec, the 14 Premium really can't keep up on the low-end, and those looking to keep things within a tighter budget will likely be better off with a MacBook Pro (as much as it pains me to say it as a diehard Windows user).\nIf you're looking for high-end performance, however, the MacBook Pro 14-inch's M4 just can't keep up with the 14 Premium's RTX 4050 discrete graphics. It makes a huge difference in some workloads, like 3D modeling, and especially when it comes to gaming.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nOne other thing the 14 Premium has over the MacBook Pro 14-inch is the option for an OLED display, which looks gorgeous. The rest of the laptop is solid and has a much more premium feel to it than the 14 Plus, but there are some design quirks that keep it from truly laying out its competition on the mat.\nWhile the discrete graphics and OLED upgrades do push the price considerably higher, there's no question that the upgrade is worth it, especially the upgrade to the RTX 4050 GPU, which unlocks a lot of power necessary for high-end applications.\nThis, of course, considerably impacts the device's battery life, dragging it down below nine hours in my testing. But for a laptop this compact with a high-end display and discrete graphics, it's definitely a worthwhile compromise.\nSo, bottom line: does the Dell 14 Premium defeat the current MacBook Pro 14-inch with M4? Yes, but it's down to the judges rather than a KO, and so your mileage may vary depending on your needs and budget. If you're going with high-end specs, the Dell 14 Premium is probably the best Windows laptop going right now, but if you're not going to go with the RTX 4050 GPU, the MacBook Pro 14-inch is probably the better bet for those looking to stay on budget.\nDell 14 Premium: Price & availability\n- How much does it cost? Starts at $1,499.99 / \u00a31,499 / AU$2,798.40\n- When is it available? It's available now\n- Where can you get it? You can buy it in the US, UK, and Australia through Dell\u2019s website and other retailers.\nThe Dell 14 Premium is available now in the US, UK, and Australia, starting at $1,499.99 / \u00a31,499 / AU$2,798.40, respectively.\nThis puts it a bit cheaper than the starting price of the MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4), and is roughly in line with where the XPS 14 (2024) launched last year, though the 14 Premium is cheaper to start in the UK and Australia than its predecessor.\nGiven its premium status, this isn't really that bad a price for a laptop like this, and its high-end configurations are cheaper than a comparable MacBook Pro 14-inch, which definitely can't be overlooked. Still, it's expensive, especially in an era where everyone is a bit less free with their spending than they were even a year ago.\n- Value: 4 / 5\nDell 14 Premium: Specs\n- Up to RTX 4050 GPU\n- Wi-Fi 7\n- Only Thunderbolt 4\nThe specs for the Dell 14 Premium are pretty much identical to the Dell XPS 14 that preceded it, with some important differences.\nThis is not an Intel Lunar Lake laptop; it's an Arrow Lake H laptop, so while the processor model numbers might look very similar, they are two different architectures.\nThis allows the Intel Core Ultra 255H chip to be paired with an Nvidia RTX 4050 GPU, something last year's model wasn't capable of due to the limitations of the Lunar Lake chip design.\nThe 14 Premium is also configured with Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity, though it only has Thunderbolt 4 ports rather than the newer Thunderbolt 5 that the top-spec Dell 16 Premium has.\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | US | UK | Australia |\n|---|---|---|---|\nPrice | |||\nCPU | Intel Core Ultra 7 255H | Intel Core Ultra 7 255H | Intel Core Ultra 7 255H |\nGPU | Integrated Intel Arc 140T | Integrated Intel Arc 140T | Integrated Intel Arc 140T |\nMemory | 16GB LPDDR5x - 7467MT/s | 16GB LPDDR5x - 7467MT/s | 16GB LPDDR5x - 7467MT/s |\nStorage | 512GB PCIe NVMe | 512GB PCIe NVMe | 512GB PCIe NVMe |\nDisplay | 14.5-inch non-touch 2K IPS 120Hz | 14.5-inch non-touch 2K IPS 120Hz | 14.5-inch non-touch 2K IPS 120Hz |\nPorts | 1 x 3.5mm combo jack, 3 x Thunderbolt 4 Gen 2 (DP 2.1, Power Delivery), 1 x microSDXC 7.1 | 1 x 3.5mm combo jack, 3 x Thunderbolt 4 Gen 2 (DP 2.1, Power Delivery), 1 x microSDXC 7.1 | 1 x 3.5mm combo jack, 3 x Thunderbolt 4 Gen 2 (DP 2.1, Power Delivery), 1 x microSDXC 7.1 |\nBattery | 69.5WHr | 69.5WHr | 69.5WHr |\nWireless | Wi-Fi 7, BT 5.4 | Wi-Fi 7, BT 5.4 | Wi-Fi 7, BT 5.4 |\nCamera | 1080p IR camera | 1080p IR camera | 1080p IR camera |\nWeight | 3.66 lbs | 1.66kg | 3.66 lbs | 1.66kg | 3.66 lbs | 1.66kg |\nDimensions | 12.6 x 8.5 x 0.71 ins | 320 x 215.97 x 18mm | 12.6 x 8.5 x 0.71 ins | 320 x 215.97 x 18mm | 12.6 x 8.5 x 0.71 ins | 320 x 215.97 x 18mm |\nThe base specs are fairly modest, though you do start out with at least 16GB LPDDR5x RAM and a 512GB SSD, which is necessary if you're planning on using Windows 11's Copilot+ AI features. There's also no difference in starting configuration between the US, UK, and Australia.\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | US | UK | Australia |\n|---|---|---|---|\nPrice | |||\nCPU | Intel Core Ultra 7 255H | Intel Core Ultra 7 265H | Intel Core Ultra 7 255H |\nGPU | Nvidia RTX 4050 | Nvidia RTX 4050 | Nvidia RTX 4050 |\nMemory | 32GB LPDDR5x - 8400MT/s | 32GB LPDDR5x - 8400MT/s | 32GB LPDDR5x - 8400MT/s |\nStorage | 2TB M.2 PCIe NVMe | 2TB M.2 PCIe NVMe | 2TB M.2 PCIe NVMe |\nDisplay | 14.5-inch Touch 3.2K OLED, 400 nit, 120Hz | 14.5-inch Touch 3.2K OLED, 400 nit, 120Hz | 14.5-inch Touch 3.2K OLED, 400 nit, 120Hz |\nPorts | 1 x 3.5mm combo jack, 3 x Thunderbolt 5, 1 x microSDXC 7.1 | 1 x 3.5mm combo jack, 3 x Thunderbolt 4 Gen 2 (DP 2.1, Power Delivery), 1 x microSDXC 7.1 | 1 x 3.5mm combo jack, 3 x Thunderbolt 4 Gen 2 (DP 2.1, Power Delivery), 1 x microSDXC 7.1 |\nBattery | 69.5WHr | 69.5WHr | 69.5WHr |\nWireless | Wi-Fi 7, BT 5.4 | Wi-Fi 7, BT 5.4 | Wi-Fi 7, BT 5.4 |\nCamera | 1080p IR camera | 1080p IR camera | 1080p IR camera |\nWeight | 3.79 lbs | 1.72kg | 3.79 lbs | 1.72kg | 3.79 lbs | 1.72kg |\nDimensions | 12.6 x 8.5 x 0.71 ins | 320 x 215.97 x 18mm | 12.6 x 8.5 x 0.71 ins | 320 x 215.97 x 18mm | 12.6 x 8.5 x 0.71 ins | 320 x 215.97 x 18mm |\nOn the top-end, the Dell 14 Premium configurations are nearly identical, save that in the UK, you can opt for a slightly more powerful Core Ultra 7 265H chip rather than the Core Ultra 7 255H in every other configuration.\nFor this review, I tested out the top US configuration listed above.\n- Specs: 4.5 / 5\nDell 14 Premium: Design\n- Gorgeous OLED display\n- Excellent port selection\n- Trackpad and function key row still controversial\nFrom the outside, the Dell 14 Premium is identical to last year's XPS 14 (save for the new logo on the lid), and that's not a bad thing. The 14 Premium's construction and minimalist aesthetic definitely make it look like it's all business, something you'd expect from a company like Dell, renowned as it is for its business and enterprise market dominance.\nThat doesn't make it ugly, though. It's a good-looking laptop, somewhat undercut by its two colorways, Graphite and Platinum, which are honestly rather boring at this point.\nWith the new Surface Laptop 7 coming in a gorgeous Sapphire colorway and even Apple adding a Sky Blue option for this year's MacBook Air models (not to mention my beloved Microsoft Surface Laptop 13-inch having a Violet option), laptops are starting to finally have more personality than the design deadend that Apple pushed us all into with its MacBook Silver and Space Gray colorways in the 2010s.\nIn this regard, I hope Dell catches up next year, but one thing at a time, I guess. Dropping the XPS branding and introducing a splash of color in one release might have pushed some Dell fans over the edge, so steady as she goes, design-wise.\nI've spilled enough ink over the past couple of years about my mixed feelings when it comes to the borderless trackpad (and loss of the delightful carbon-fibery palm rests), so I'll let that critique go. Finally.\nI've yet to fully embrace the solid strip beneath the keyboard, as it does take some getting used to for finding out exactly how to right click on something, but it's easy enough to pick up and soon becomes second nature. It's still an accessibility nightmare, as is the lack of physical function keys along the top of the keydeck. On the plus side, there are top-firing speakers, which isn't always a sure thing on a 14-inch laptop.\nThe keyboard itself is decent enough, though these aren't my favorite keys to type on. I'm very used to mechanical keyboards, so the travel and tactile responsiveness of the 14 Premium's take getting used to, and I'm not sure I ever will. If this is going to be your only or even just your primary laptop, however, you'll get used to it just fine.\nSome are going to complain about the lack of USB Type-A ports on the 14 Premium, but frankly, it's 2025. At some point, older, slower interfaces will be retired, and it's time, honestly. There are plenty of adapters out there to convert USB-A to USB-C, and you can even add the option for a mini-hub dongle with USB-A and HDMI ports that can plug into one of the three Thunderbolt 4 ports on the device. All three provide power delivery and DisplayPort out, with up to 4 monitors supported overall.\nYou also get a microSD slot, which is great for creative pros who work with SD cards alot, and a dedicated 3.5mm combo jack. All in all, a solid port selection for a device this small.\nOne other knock I have to give the 14 Premium though is its webcam. The 1080p IR webcam itself is perfectly good, and gets up to 30 FPS 1080p video, which is great for video calls and meetings. My problem, though, is the lack of a privacy shutter. It's 2025, and this should be the default on a 'premium' laptop.\nThe overall aesthetics of the 14 Premium are as good as its XPS pedigree, but it could use some freshening up in the next couple of years, in my opinion. It's built solid and won't be embarrassing to whip out in the office in five year's time, but we are kind of coming up against this design's shelf life, and I hope we see something new next year.\n- Design: 4 / 5\nDell 14 Premium: Performance\n- Powerful creative chops\n- Decent 1080p gaming\n- Falls a good bit behind Apple's MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) on some benchmarks\nSo, when it comes down to it, performance really is the most important factor in a laptop like the Dell 14 Premium. It's competing against one of the best MacBooks ever made in the recent MacBook Pro 14-inch, and given its pricing, the 14 Premium has to deliver on something other than cost.\nIt's a bit of a mixed bag, ultimately. The CPU performance for the M4 chip outperforms the Intel Core Ultra 255H in all tests but Geekbench 6.4 multicore performance, where they are very close, with the Dell 14 Premium in the lead.\nThat said, the Intel Core Ultra 255H is mostly competitive with the M4 in CPU computing tasks, and the difference is such that you'd be very hard-pressed to notice the M4's faster performance in actual use. The 14 Premium falls behind quite a bit on single-core performance, which is important for running some high-impact creative apps like Adobe Photoshop or Pro Tools, but that's only part of the story.\nThe very strong single-core performance for the MacBook Pro 14-inch is offset quite a bit by the relatively slow SSD performance I saw in my Blackmagic Disk Speed Test benchmark. The Dell 14 Premium clocked in with an impressive 4,235 MB/s read speed to the MacBook Pro 14-inch's 2,900 MB/s. That's a nearly 50% faster read speed for the 14 Premium, and that translates directly into faster load times for programs and opening files.\nThe MacBook Pro 14-inch might beat the 14 Premium in single-core performance, but when it comes to system and app startup, downloads, and other file operations, that extra sluggishness on Apple's part will noticeably cut into its advantage here. That doesn't mean the 14 Premium will somehow eek out a win when it comes to video encoding or processing photos in Photoshop. What it does do, however, is help keep the 14 Premium in the hunt when its Intel chip is being outclassed by the M4's processing power (ironically, last year's Dell XPS 14 scored the highest in my storage benchmark tests).\nSwing things around to GPU performance, though, and things fall apart for Apple pretty quick. There just isn't a way for an integrated GPU to compete with even a budget discrete Nvidia GPU like the RTX 4050.\nThere are only a few cross-platform GPU tests that I can use for both the Dell 14 Premium and the MacBook Pro 14-inch, but in all cases, the RTX 4050 just outclasses the M4 10-core GPU, especially in ray-tracing workloads like Solar Bay\nMeanwhile, in areas like video and photo editing, the MacBook Pro 14-inch might have an advantage over the 14 Premium, but it's not earth-shattering.\nThe 14 Premium encoded a 4K video into 1080p about 22% slower than the MacBook Pro 14-inch, which is definitely something for video editors to consider (who are we kidding, we know y'all are just going to buy a MacBook Pro. Your entire industry is built around macOS). In my PugetBench for Creators-Adobe Photoshop tests, the Dell 14 Premium came in about 29% slower. For video and photography pros, this will absolutely be a dealbreaker and push you firmly back into the Apple camp, and that's understandable if that's what you're looking to use your next laptop for.\nHowever, compare those results to the MacBook Pro 14-inch's Blender Benchmark 4.3.0 performance, which is about 60% slower, overall, than the 14 Premium's.\nWhen it comes to machine learning workloads, the situation will be similar, since Pytorch, the software framework that drives pretty much all AI development right now, is deeply tied to Nvidia's tensor core hardware. We don't have any good cross-platform AI benchmarks right now to give quantitative numbers, so giving a percentage of which laptop is better isn't really possible yet (I'm working on it, I promise).\nThat said, I've spent the better part of a decade studying computer science to earn my Master's degree in the field, and I can tell you that not a single person I know uses anything other than Nvidia hardware for this kind of work, and the Dell 14 Premium will be able to run AI inference and GAN workloads far better than the MacBook Pro 14-inch.\nFinally, when it comes to gaming, none of these laptops are making it onto our best gaming laptop list, but the RTX 4050 GPU in the 14 Premium I tested made it much easier to play modern AAA PC games, with reasonable adjustments made to settings.\nAt 1080p on the highest settings in those games where I can compare results across devices, the Dell 14 Premium averaged about 75% faster FPS on average overall compared to the MacBook Pro 14-inch.\nOf course, there's also the issue with whether or not the game you want can run on a Mac, which isn't a guarantee, while Windows is the default for all PC games on major platforms like Steam or GOG. I wouldn't go out of your way to buy the 14 Premium to play games on, but it's nice to know that you can effectively game if you're on the road for work and you're tired of writing up reports or designing work presentations in your hotel room.\nOf course, all of this is contingent on similarly-specced devices. The MacBook Pro 14-inch can be configured with an M4 Pro or M4 Max chip, which is substantially more powerful than anything the Dell 14 Premium can offer. For that, you might want to look at the Dell Pro Premium and Dell Pro Max Premium models, respectively.\n- Performance: 4.5 / 5\nDell 14 Premium: Battery Life\n- How long does it last on a single charge? 8 hours, 16 minutes\n- How long does it take to charge from empty to full? It takes about 2 hours and 20 minutes to charge to full with a 100W AC adapter\nFor battery life, the Dell 14 Premium doesn't have spectacular longevity, especially compared to something like the Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch, which run about 55% longer than the 14 Premium, but there are costs involved in using discrete graphics and more power hungry OLED displays.\nOverall, I think the tradeoff is worth it, but if batter life is a major concern for you, sticking with an LCD display and integrated graphics are the way to go here, and should get you a good bit more juice on a single charge.\n- Battery Life: 3.5 / 5\nShould you buy the Dell 14 Premium?\nCategory | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | The 14 Premium is not totally out of line price-wise for its market. This is still a premium device, so budget-conscious buyers might be better off looking elsewhere. That said, for the level of performance and portability, it will likely offer a better value than a similarly specced MacBook Pro 14-inch. | 4 / 5 |\nSpecs | There aren't a whole lot of configuration options available, you do get three Thunderbolt 4 ports, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, and options for an RTX 4050 GPU and a gorgeous OLED display. | 4.5 / 5 |\nDesign | The 14 Premium is a good looking device that is well-made and portable. Its 'virtual' function keys, borderless trackpad, and lack of webcam privacy shutter knocks some points off though. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | While it doesn't dethrone the MacBook Pro 14-inch as the go-to device for creative pros, it more than holds its own against Apple's popular laptop and even outperforms it in key areas. | 4.5 / 5 |\nBattery Life | At just over 8 hours of battery life on a charge, this isn't the longest-lasting laptop going. If batter life is a concern, skip the RTX 4050 GPU and OLED display to reduce strain on the 69.5WHr battery. | 3.5 / 5 |\nFinal Score | The Dell 14 Premium outperforms the MacBook Pro 14-inch when every score is averaged, but there's enough nuance here that it's not a laptop I can unconditionally recommend to everybody. Most people? Yes; but creatives will still want to look at the MacBook Pro 14-inch. | 4.10 / 5 |\nBuy the Dell 14 Premium if...\nYou want a high-performance 14-inch ultrabook\nThe highly portable form factor belies some seriously powerful hardware inside.\nYou need an Nvidia GPU for on-the-go work\nThere are some tasks that simply require an Nvidia GPU, and this is one of the most portable laptops you'll find that offers one.\nYou want to do some moderate PC gaming\nThe RTX 4050 GPU in the 14 Premium has 1080p gaming chops, just keep your graphics settings reasonable.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou're on a tight budget\nAs the name suggests, the 14 Premium doesn't come cheap. You might be better off with the Dell 14 Plus if money's tight.\nYou plan on doing heavy-duty video editing\nWhile the 14 Premium can handle serious video editing tasks, the MacBook Pro 14-inch is simply better suited for that workload.\nYou need all-day battery life\nThe battery life on the 14 Premium isn't terrible, but you will need to bring a charger with you in you plan on working on it all day.\nAlso consider\nApple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4)\nThe Dell 14 Premium is directly competing with the MacBook Pro 14-inch, and both are pretty evenly matched in the end.\nRead our full Apple MacBook Pro 14-inch (M4) review\nDell 14 Plus\nIf you're looking for a cheap Windows 11 laptop, the Dell 14 Premium is fairly pricey, so check out the 14 Plus if you're on a budget.\nRead our full Dell 14 Plus review\nHow I tested the Dell 14 Premium\n- I spent about two weeks with the Dell 14 Premium\n- I used it for everyday work and creative tasks\n- I ran it through our standard battery of benchmark tests\nI spent about two weeks working with the Dell 14 Premium, putting it through my typical battery of benchmark tests, and using it for everyday productivity and creative work.\nI used standard benchmarking tools like 3DMark, Geekbench, PugetBench for Creators, and in-game benchmarks for PC gaming performance analysis.\nI also used the laptop as my everyday device, including some light gaming in addition to working with Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop.\nI've been reviewing laptops for Techradar for more than five years, and I've tested more than a hundred laptops in that time, both for reviews and for investigative testing to support special computing features and content in that time, so I know better than most when a laptop is hitting the mark and when and where it misses.\n- First reviewed August 2025\nJohn (He/Him) is the Components Editor here at TechRadar and he is also a programmer, gamer, activist, and Brooklyn College alum currently living in Brooklyn, NY.\nNamed by the CTA as a CES 2020 Media Trailblazer for his science and technology reporting, John specializes in all areas of computer science, including industry news, hardware reviews, PC gaming, as well as general science writing and the social impact of the tech industry.\nYou can find him online on Bluesky @johnloeffler.bsky.social\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."
