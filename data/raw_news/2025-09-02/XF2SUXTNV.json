      "text": "How to watch NFL games without cable: The best football streaming deals for the 2025\u20132026 season\nTable of Contents\nIt's finally that time again: a new NFL season is upon us. That means it's also time to get all of your streaming services in order.\nNotorious gatekeepers of their broadcasts, watching NFL games has become a tangled web of subscriptions. Even if you still have cable, you're going to need a couple of extra subscriptions to watch every game. We've done our best to sort out all the complicated details for you.\nIf you want to watch your favorite teams battle it out this season with or without cable, here's everything you need to know \u2014 including the cheapest possible way to do so (legally).\nHow to watch NFL games during the 2025\u20132026 season\nSince no single network owns the rights to every game, watching your favorite teams isn't as cut and dry in the NFL as it is with some other sports. And now with streaming services throwing hats in the ring, even cable TV subscribers will need a few extras to catch every game.\nHere's the general schedule each week for the 2025\u20132026 season:\nThursday Night Football kicks off the week exclusively on Prime Video (starting week two)\nSunday afternoon games air on CBS (stream on Paramount+) for AFC teams and FOX (stream on Fox One) for NFC teams\nSunday Night Football games air on NBC and stream on Peacock\nMonday Night Football games air on ESPN, ABC, ESPN+ (stream on ESPN Unlimited)\nNFL Network will also broadcast seven different games throughout the season\nNetflix will once again broadcast two games on Christmas Day this season\nYouTube, for the first time, will broadcast the Chiefs vs. Chargers game week 1 from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nIf you don't have cable, you have an abundance of options for watching games live. If you're a casual fan, you can simply invest in a digital TV antenna to catch local games and nationally broadcast games live on ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX. Beyond football, a digital antenna will also grant you free access to local news, nationally broadcast events like the Grammys or Oscars, and other network programming. If you're reasonably close to your local TV stations, you should be able to pick up at least the four main networks. Unfortunately, you probably won't be able to access ESPN.\nYou can also sign up for a live TV streaming service like YouTube TV or Fubo to get access to local networks, plus a ton of other channels. Live TV streaming services can be pretty pricey, but you do get a lot of bang for your buck. This option will get you ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, ESPN, and NFL Network in most markets. No need to be close to your local TV stations.\nWith either option you choose, you'll still have to sign up for Prime Video if you want to watch Thursday Night Football games and Netflix for the two games on Christmas Day. You can also utilize streaming apps like Peacock, Paramount+, the new Fox One, and revamped ESPN to watch many regular-season games. It's all up to you and how many games you want access to. Below, we've rounded up the best streaming deals for each streaming service required to watch football games this season.\nIn-market vs. out-of-market games\nBefore you pull the trigger on any paid TV provider or streaming service, you need to decide whether you want access to local in-market games or out-of-market games. This is where watching sports gets really confusing and frustrating.\nIf you're a fan of your local sports team and strictly want to watch their season unfold, a digital antenna or live TV streaming service will get the job done. You will generally only get access to in-market games, which include the teams geographically closest to you.\nIf your favorite teams are not geographically close to you, they will likely be blacked out unless they are national broadcasts. In this case, the only legal way you can watch out-of-market games is via NFL Sunday Ticket. A costly streaming service, NFL Sunday Ticket exclusively streams out-of-market, regular-season, Sunday football games. There are two ways to subscribe: as an add-on to a YouTube TV base plan or as an individual primetime channel on YouTube. It costs $378 as a YouTube TV add-on and $480 as a standalone service, although there are typically deals around the start of the season (more on that below).\nSo if you\u2019re a Baltimore Ravens fan living in Nashville, you can watch all of the Sunday Ravens games that aren\u2019t shown on NBC, CBS, or FOX in your area with NFL Sunday Ticket. If you're a Ravens fan living in or near Baltimore, however, you'll want to grab a digital antenna or sign up for a streaming service like Paramount+ or YouTube TV.\nThe best football streaming deals for the 2025\u20132026 NFL season\nThe best Prime Video deals for Thursday Night Football\nIn addition to Thursday Night Football games, Prime Video is also set to stream an exclusive Black Friday game and a playoff game again this season during Wildcard weekend. Prime members get access to Prime Video included in their subscription, which costs $14.99 per month. If you're new to Prime, you can even score a free 30-day trial before you'll owe a monthly fee. Here are a few other ways you can save some money.\nBest for long-term viewing: Prime Annual (save 22%)\nEnjoy the perks of a Prime membership, including access to Prime Video, for an entire year with a Prime Annual subscription. Rather than paying a $14.99 monthly fee, you'll pay $139 up front. That ends up saving you about 22%, knocking the price down to about $11.59 per month.\nMost affordable: Prime Video only (save $6 per month)\nIf you don't want all the extra perks of being a Prime member, you can simply subscribe to Prime Video as a standalone service for just $8.99 per month. That's $6 per month cheaper than a full Prime membership. Naturally, Amazon makes it unnecessarily complicated to sign up for Prime Video alone. When you go to sign up for a subscription, you'll have to select the option to \"see more plans\" or \"change plans\" and navigate to the option for Prime Video on its own. Like a Prime membership, you can still cancel whenever you please with no strings.\nBest for those under 24: Prime for Young Adults (save 50%)\nAmazon's Prime Student subscription has now evolved into Prime for Young Adults. Those between the ages of 18 and 24, as well as college students of any age, can now score a free six-month trial to Prime. After the trial period is up, it'll cost just $7.49 per month \u2014 that's 50% in savings. You'll have to verify your age or student status, but after that, the world of Prime is your oyster.\nThe best live TV streaming deals for NFL Sunday games\nSunday afternoon games are broadcast on either CBS (for AFC teams) or FOX (for NFC teams). CBS is accessible without cable through Paramount+, while FOX is now accessible through a new streaming service called Fox One (see bundle deal under Monday Night Football). Meanwhile, live TV streaming services like Fubo, YouTube TV, or Hulu + Live TV will give you access to both CBS and FOX, although they are much more expensive. Whichever route you choose, we've found a few different deals currently live for the start of the NFL season. Here are our top picks.\nBest for AFC games only: Paramount+ Essential annual subscription (save 17%)\nParamount+ is one of the most affordable streaming services at just $7.99 per month with ads. However, you can score it for even cheaper by opting for an annual subscription for $59.99. Slash 17% off when you pay for a year upfront. That knocks the monthly cost down to just $5 per month. Just note that Paramount+ only gives you access to in-network AFC games via CBS.\nBest for students who want to watch AFC games: Paramount+ for students\nStudents who want to watch in-network AFC games can score a Paramount+ Essential subscription for only $3.99 per month for 12 months. That's 50% cheaper than a typical Paramount+ subscription. You'll just have to verify your student status to unlock the deal.\nBest for NFC games only: Fox One annual subscription\nFox has finally launched its own streaming service, filling the gap for NFC games. With Fox One, you'll be able to catch in-market Sunday afternoon games, as well as plenty more of Fox's programming. It'll cost you $19.99 per month, but if you subscribe for the whole year, it's just $199. That's 17% in savings.\nBest live TV streaming service deal: YouTube TV (save $99 on your first three months)\nYouTube TV is one of our favorite live TV streaming options. It will give you access to all the networks you need to watch Sunday afternoon games in your network, as well as Sunday night and Monday night games \u2014 NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, NFL Network, and ESPN. Through Aug. 31, YouTube TV is offering new users a discount on their first three months of service. Plus, you can kick things off with a free 10-day trial. It usually costs $82.99 per month for the base plan, but you'll pay just $49.99 per month (save $99) for your first three months, making it the most affordable and most well-rounded option for a live TV streaming service.\nBest a la carte option: Sling Season Pass (save $50.95)\nIf you prepay for five months of Sling Orange, Blue, and Sports Extras, you can save $50.95 with Sling Season Pass. The Blue package gets you access to FOX, NBC, ABC, and NFL Network in local markets, while the Orange package gets you access to ESPN. With the Sports Extras add-on, you'll also get access to NFL RedZone, where you can see every touchdown that happens on Sunday afternoons. It'll cost you $329 for five months of Sling Season Pass, which is significantly cheaper than any other live TV streaming service. Just be sure to check your local market to ensure you'll have access to the channels you need.\nBest bang for your buck: Get Hulu + Live TV, Disney+, and ESPN+ all for $82.99 per month\nWhile other live TV streaming services might be a little cheaper, Hulu + Live TV comes with the most bang for your buck. You'll pay $82.99 per month and get access to the live TV channels you need to watch NFL games, plus Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+ (all with ads). For comparison, YouTube TV is also $82.99 per month and includes a similar live TV channel lineup, but no extras. Fubo is $84.99 per month and features a slightly wider channel lineup, but still no extras. Unfortunately, there's no introductory offer, but you will get your first three days for free.\nAnother live TV streaming deal: Take $30 off your first month of Fubo\nFubo isn't our first pick for a live TV streaming service, simply because it's too expensive. However, the streamer is currently offering new subscribers their first month at $30 off. That knocks the Pro plan down to $54.99 for your first month ($84.99 per month thereafter) and the Elite plan with Sports Plus down to $74.99 for your first month ($104.99 per month thereafter).\nThe best Peacock deals for streaming Sunday Night Football\nIf you don't have access to local networks via a live TV streaming service or a digital antenna, you can still tune into Sunday Night Football on NBC by signing up for Peacock. The streamer will also host a Week 17 Peacock exclusive game, as well as the Super Bowl. After a recent price hike, subscriptions now start at $10.99 per month, but we've rounded up a few ways you can save.\nBest for long-term viewing: Peacock Premium yearly subscription (save 17%)\nIf Peacock isn't running any sort of special, the best Peacock deal for most people on any given day is the annual subscription deal. And since you're going to need the streamer long term if you plan on watching the Big Game in February, it's worth committing to a yearly subscription. A monthly subscription with ads costs $10.99 per month (which adds up to $131.88), but a yearly subscription will only run you $109.99 (which breaks down to about $9.17 per month). That's about 17% in total savings. For those who prefer watching without ads, you'll pay $169.99 per year (which breaks down to about $14.16 per month instead of $16.99).\nBest for students: Peacock Premium Student Discount (save $8 per month)\nStudents wanting to tune into Sunday Night Football can score a Peacock Premium subscription for only $2.99 per month for an entire year. That's $8 cheaper than a typical Peacock subscription. You'll just have to be able to prove your student status through SheerID.\nBest for first responders, teachers, military: Peacock Premium for $3.99 per month\nWith annual first responder and military verification through SheerID, you can get Peacock Premium for just $3.99 per month. Upon verification, you'll receive a unique promo code to use when subscribing to Peacock. That will knock $7 per month off your total cost for the streaming service. Teachers can also score Peacock Premium for $3.99 per month, although their promotional period is limited to one year.\nBest Peacock third-party deal: Free Peacock Premium with Instacart+ (save $10.99 per month)\nIf you subscribe to Instacart+ for free grocery delivery, which costs either $99 per year or $9.99 per month, you'll get a free Peacock Premium subscription included. Just log in to your Instacart account, select your Instacart+ membership, then \"unlock special offers\" and activate the Peacock offer. You'll get redirected to Peacock's website, where you can sign in or create an account to activate the benefit.\nThe best ESPN deals for Monday Night Football\nLast season, in order to watch Monday Night Football games on ESPN and ABC, you needed a live TV streaming service that included the channels in its lineup. This season, things have evolved. ESPN launched its own direct-to-consumer streaming service on Aug. 21, which means you can stream games on ESPN, ABC, and ESPN+ live without cable on the ESPN Unlimited plan. ESPN also recently acquired the rights to NFL Network and RedZone, so these channels are expected to stream on the new ESPN app as well. It costs $29.99 per month, but there are a few options that allow you to save some money.\nBest for long-term viewing: ESPN Unlimited annual subscription (save 17%)\nIf you're all in on ESPN's new streaming service, you can save about 17% by subscribing for a full year instead of paying monthly. It'll cost you $299.99 in total, which breaks down to about $24.99 each month. That means you'll save $5 every month.\nBest introductory deal: ESPN Unlimited with Disney+ and Hulu (save $19.98/month)\nAs an introduction to its new streaming service, ESPN is offering its Unlimited plan bundled with Disney+ and Hulu (both with ads) for just $29.99 per month for your first year. That essentially gets you Hulu and Disney+ for free.\nBest bundle deal: ESPN Unlimited + Fox One\nYou can watch live Monday Night Football games on ESPN, ABC, and ESPN+, plus live Sunday afternoon games on Fox with the new ESPN Unlimited and Fox One bundle. Usually $29.99 per month apiece, you can sign up for both for just $39.99 and save $10 each month. This is a great value, particularly if you're a fan of an NFC team. Unfortunately, the bundle deal isn't set to launch until Oct. 2, so you'll have to subscribe to both separately in the meantime.\nWhat's the cheapest way to watch the most NFL games this season?\nGood question. If you want to watch mainly in-market games and nationally broadcast games, the cheapest way to do so would be to sign up for the new ESPN Unlimited and Fox One bundle, Peacock, Paramount+, and Prime Video for a grand total of $67.96 per month. This will give you access to FOX (via Fox One), ABC, ESPN, and ESPN+ (via ESPN Unlimited), NBC (via Peacock), CBS (via Paramount+), and Prime Video. You could also add Netflix into the mix in December if you want access to those two games for $6.99 (per month). If you add Netflix to the total, December would run you a little more at $74.95.\nHere's the breakdown:\n$39.99 per month for ESPN Unlimited and Fox One \u2014 NFC games on Sunday afternoons and Monday Night Football games on ABC, ESPN, and ESPN+\n$10.99 per month for Peacock \u2014 Sunday Night Football games on NBC, plus Peacock-exclusive game\n$7.99 per month for Paramount+ \u2014 AFC games on Sunday afternoons\n$8.99 per month for Prime Video \u2014 Thursday Night Football\n$6.99 per month for Netflix \u2014 two exclusive games in December\nFor out-of-market games, things get a bit more expensive. NFL Sunday Ticket is one of the only ways you can watch out-of-market games throughout the season. If you run and sign up before the Aug. 31 cutoff, new subscribers can score NFL Sunday Ticket for $34.50 per month, or $276 total for the regular season. It's typically $60 per month or $480 total, so we highly recommend signing up sooner rather than later. Check out our guide to out-of-market games for more information.\nAnother option for out-of-market games would be to sign up for a VPN and attempt to use a different location with any of the live TV streaming services above. For more information about VPNs and how to watch the NFL 2025\u20132026 season from other countries (or pretending to), check out this article on bypassing geo-restrictions.\nTopics Streaming Sports How to Watch\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhile it would be extremely generous of Amazon to offer games for free, that's not the case. In order to watch Thursday Night Football games on Prime Video, you'll need either a Prime membership ($14.99 per month) or a Prime Video subscription ($8.99 per month). If you're new to Prime or returning after some time away, however, you can get a free 30-day trial to kick things off.\nNFL+ is the NFL's official subscription service. The streaming provider allows subscribers to stream any national or local market games, regardless of the network or streaming service. Out of market games are not available. It's important to note, however, that the games can only be viewed on phones and tablets. That's why we don't typically recommend it. NFL+ Premium allows access to NFL RedZone as well as game replays of in and out-of-market games.\nNFL+ costs $6.99 per month and $49.99 annually, while NFL+ Premium costs $14.99 per month or $99.99 annually.\nIf you're a fan of a team outside your local market, you've got it rough in 2025. The only way to simply and legally access out-of-market games is through an NFL Sunday Ticket subscription, which is outrageously overpriced at $480 per year. NFL Sunday Ticket is a premium sports package exclusively available through YouTube that broadcasts all out-of-market regular season Sunday NFL games. So, for example, if you're a Baltimore fan living in Nashville, you'll be able to tune into Ravens games on CBS instead of Titans.\nYour other options are to go to a local bar that broadcasts all of the games, or try your hand at using a VPN to bypass geo-restrictions. Top VPNs like NordVPN and ExpressVPN may allow you to skirt a blacked out game by setting your location to a different region in the U.S. It's worth a shot if you have some decent internet skills and don't want to pay $480 for Sunday Ticket.\nFour separate international games will air on NFL Network this season, as will three other games through the regular season. Unfortunately, NFL Network isn't a local channel, so an over-the-air antenna won't grant you access. The only way non-cable subscribers can watch NFL Network without cable is through a live TV streaming service like Sling, Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, or Fubo. You could also opt for an NFL+ subscription, but you'll only be able to stream the games on your mobile device.\nESPN recently acquired NFL Network, but there's no word yet on when the network will appear on ESPN's streaming service.\nChristina Buff is a Nashville-based freelance writer for who covers shopping with a splash of entertainment. If you\u2019re ever wondering what streaming service you need to watch something (and the cheapest way to sign up for it), she\u2019s your girl.\nChristina received a B.S. in Business Communication (concentration in writing) from Stevenson University and began her professional journey writing and editing press releases. Since then, she\u2019s written content for a marketing agency, blogged for celebrities, and covered local news, politics, women\u2019s lifestyle, fashion, beauty, and just about everything in between for various publications.\nWhen she\u2019s not writing, she\u2019s probably enjoying live music, studying human design, or embroidering and upcycling clothes.

That's its best price on record.\nGet this limited-time offer here.\nLauren Allain is a freelance journalist covering deals at Mashable.

      "text": "The 10 best movies of 2025 (so far), and where to watch them\nJoin Mashable as we look back at the viral moments, breakout movies, memes, dating trends, tech buzz, scientific breakthroughs, and more that have defined 2025 \u2014 so far!\nWe're halfway through 2025, and the cinema has been outrageous!\nIf you love action, this year's delivered plenty already. Tom Cruise dazzled in Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning. Anthony Mackie and Florence Pugh returned to the MCU with Captain America: Brave New World and Thunderbolts*, respectively. Martial arts movie legends Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio joined forces with Ben Wang in the rousing Karate Kid: Legends. Then of course, Jack Black's A Minecraft Movie has action scenes so bonkers it drove audiences absolutely wild.\nOther movies offered action with high doses of side-splitting buddy-comedy, like One of Them Days, starring Keke Palmer and SZA, and The Accountant 2, which reunited Ben Affleck and Jon Bernthal. Meanwhile, horror offered plenty of new reasons to scream with Final Destination: Bloodlines, Heart Eyes, The Ugly Stepsister, and Ryan Coogler's epic vampire movie, Sinners. But of course, that's a movie that's more genre-fluid than just horror.\nIn fact, as Mashable's entertainment team looked over the movies hitting so far this year, we found a lot of our favorites didn't snugly fit into one genre. They could best be described as post-apocalyptic rom-com, espionage family-comedy, body horror fairy tale, sci-fi screwball comedy, and vampire historical drama/musical? But no matter how you categorize them, these films are absolutely awesome.\nSo with no further ado, here are the 10 best movies of the year so far, and where you can watch them.\n10. The Phoenician Scheme\nWes Anderson reunites with The French Dispatch's Benicio del Toro for a father-daughter story unlike any you've seen before. Tapping into some elements of espionage thriller \u2014 spies! explosions! international intrigue! poisonous gas! \u2014 Anderson and company unfurl the story of manipulative and massively wealthy businessman Zsa-zsa Korda (del Toro) and his daughter Liesl (Mia Threapleton).\nThe subject of a U.S. government investigation and a flurry of assassination attempts, Korda decides to reach out to his estranged daughter, who is training to become a nun. He wants her to be his heir and aid in his \"Phoenician Scheme.\" But her faith and his dastardly dealings quickly lead to conflict. Along their journey, they'll meet an array of colorful characters, allowing Anderson to fold in familiar faces from his recurring collaborators, as well as Michael Cera, who \u2014 as I wrote in my review \u2014 was born to be in a Wes Anderson movie.\nWhile critics have been divided on this Anderson offering, I cheered the filmmaker's genre approach and wrote, \"The Phoenician Scheme becomes a charmingly hopeful tale about how even with our flaws we might find love, family, and salvation.\"\nStarring: Benicio del Toro, Mia Threapleton, Michael Cera, Riz Ahmed, Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Mathieu Amalric, Richard Ayoade, Jeffrey Wright, Scarlett Johansson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Rupert Friend, and Hope Davis\nHow to watch: The Phoenician Scheme is now in theaters.\n9. The Ugly Stepsister\n2025 is proving a great year for great horror movies, and it kicked off with The Ugly Stepsister out of the Sundance Film Festival. This twisted fairytale plays like the grubby baby of Wicked and The Substance. Hear me out.\nThis gnarly body-horror movie reimagines Cinderella by focusing on the heroine's much-maligned stepsister Elvira (Lea Myren). Writer/director Emilie Blichfeldt delivers not only a deeply empathetic tale of a young girl grappling with a princely crush, sibling rivalry, and crippling societal pressures to conform to cruel beauty standards, but also the grisly scenes to back up its social critique. This one isn't for the faint of stomach.\nIn my review for Mashable out of Sundance, I cheered, \"The Ugly Stepsister is a deranged and dizzying achievement, folding in a classic story with a bitingly modern satire and bold body horror. Blichfeldt weaves these elements together to make a film that feels both of this moment but aesthetically nostalgic... And yet, her journey, as gross and grim as it is, is threaded with a ribbon of exhilaration, rebellion, and even defiant joy. Simply put, The Ugly Stepsister is savagely brutal and yet strangely beautiful.\"* \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Lea Myren, Thea Sofie Loch N\u00e6ss, Ane Dahl Torp, Flo Fagerli, Isac Calmroth, and Malte G\u00e5rdinger\nHow to watch: The Ugly Stepsister is now streaming on Shudder.\n8. Love Me\nWhile the debate of AI in work, education, and even our sex lives rages on, Love Me imagines a post-apocalyptic Earth in which AI is all that remains of humanity. And despite that very bleak setup, it's deeply sweet.\nKristen Stewart and Steven Yeun star as will-they-won't-they lovers in this tale of buoy meets... satellite. She is a buoy, frozen in the ocean of a dead earth, programmed to learn from her surroundings. He is an orbiting satellite, left behind as a sort of time capsule of humanity's long-ago reign on the planet. She is entranced by him, but when looking to understand love finds cached videos of a pair of influencers, who who relish silly onesies, date night, Friends, and Blue Apron. So, these machines begin to mimic mankind. But can they find a love of their own?\nWritten and directed by Sam Zuchero and Andy Zuchero, Love Me is a strange sci-fi treasure. In my review, I praised Stewart and Yeun's performances, which begin as roboty voiceover and evolve into flesh and blood portrayals of identity crises and romance in peril. \"As their characters shift from jaunty animated avatars to carefully crafted human forms \u2014 complete with flaws \u2014 the performances carry a new emotional weight, as both feel out the shift in tone,\" I wrote, adding, \"Props to the Zucheros; however, who refuse to abandon the weirdness of their premise or online courtship. A satisfying steamy yet surreal sex scene creates a unique space for their self-actualizing characters to explore their desires and bodies. Moments like this, where their heroes' self-expression is a messy bramble of ideas, colliding imitation with their own impulses, sets Love Me apart from a sea of sweet but superficial rom-coms.\"\nStarring: Kristen Stewart and Steven Yeun\nHow to watch: Love Me is available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n7. Mickey 17\nAs follow-up to his Best Picture-winning Parasite, Bong Joon Ho delivered a scathing and silly political satire with Mickey 17.\nRobert Pattinson stars as the eponymous protagonist, a low-level criminal who flees earth by taking a pretty brutal gig on a colonizing spaceship. He's an expendable, meaning a human test dummy who dies over and over only to be human printed again to, well, die again. Despite all these deaths, Mickey makes a cozy life for himself on the ship, falling for the tough-as-nails Nasha (Naomi Ackie). But their love life is thrown into spin when human error leads to two Mickeys \u2014 17 and 18 \u2014 existing at once. That's a threat to the snarling rich folk (Mark Ruffalo and Toni Collette) who rule the ship. And, man, we haven't even gotten to the \"creeper\" aliens who live on the surface of the humans new home world!\nA film rich in plot and twists, Mickey 17 is a rollicking ride, mainly because its celebrated writer/director refuses to be predictable. The movie shifts tones and genres freely, reflecting the tumultuous life (or lives) of Mickey. And it's an absolutely mind-blowing blast. As I wrote in my review for Mashable, \"The journey Mickey goes on is winding and wild, bucking the conventional flow of a sci-fi action movie, by being only gently sci-fi and barely action. Instead, Mickey 17 plays as a political comedy with cross-genre flare, ultimately urging the audience to see the similarities, and perhaps find our own inner Mickey 17.\"\nStarring: Robert Pattinson, Naomi Ackie, Steven Yeun, Toni Collette, and Mark Ruffalo\nHow to watch: Mickey 17 is now streaming on HBO Max.\n6. The Life of Chuck\nWhen people think of the works of Mike Flanagan (The Fall of the House of Usher, Midnight Mass) or Stephen King, they don't usually think life-affirming stories. But The Life of Chuck will change that.\nBased on a King novella, this genre-bending wonder is post-apocalyptic thriller meets feel-good coming-of-age drama meets ghost story. And yet, it's more! Tom Hiddleston stars as Chuck Krantz, whose life, at a glance, might be considered average. But in this rapturous movie, filled with a wonderful ensemble cast, King and Flanagan weave a tale of love, loss, and dance that's sure to enthrall audiences.\nIn Mashable's review out of the film's Toronto International Film Festival premiere, I cheered, \"The Life of Chuck is masterfully told. Like King's most moving adaptations, it doesn't play by standard rules of structure or audience expectations. It demands we follow the winding road through playful dialogue, painful lows, and rollicking highs to an unknown beyond. It's surprising and upsetting, funny and profound. I laughed hard, cried 'til my eyes ached, and once gasped so loud that I heard it echo across a theater struck silent by a moment both shocking and tender.\" Simply put, see it theaters, or you'll be missing out.*\nStarring: Chiwetel Ejiofor, Tom Hiddleston, Annalise Basso, Benjamin Pajak, Karen Gillan, Mia Sara, Matthew Lillard, Carl Lumbly, Samantha Sloyan, Harvey Guill\u00e9n, Jacob Tremblay, Kate Siegel, and Mark Hamill\nHow to watch: The Life of Chuck is now playing in theaters.\n5. Black Bag\nBlack Bag marks the third collaboration between director Steven Soderbergh and screenwriter David Koepp, the first being the riveting techno-thriller Kimi, and the second being the superbly unique haunted house movie Presence. Both creators relish the opportunity to shake up a genre. With this movie they do that to the espionage thriller, with Cate Blanchett and Michael Fassbender.\nWhen UK intelligence tells agent George Woodhouse (Fassbender) that his wife Kathryn (Blanchett) might be a turncoat, he does what any master spy might: He throws a dinner party, inviting all the suspected double agents. While Black Bag offers espionage standards like globe-trekking, covert surveillance, and lie detector tests, it's Koepp's dialogue over dinner that makes this movie absolutely electrifying. Soderberg's direction of a crackling cast makes the most of every cutting line.\nIn my review for Mashable, I was especially elated to see a portrayal or marriage that didn't fall into the tedious cliches of stagnation. I wrote, \"As soon as Black Bag was over, I felt that dizzying high one gets from a proper spy thriller, the rush of vicarious adrenaline from the case cracked and the day saved. But I also had the deep urge to see this movie again immediately. Because as generous as the filmmaker and stars are with slathering this story in George and Kathryn's mutual attraction, I couldn't get enough. I wanted to go back to feel the thrill of their love for each other all over again.\"\nStarring: Cate Blanchett, Michael Fassbender, Marisa Abela, Tom Burke, Naomie Harris, Reg\u00e9-Jean Page, and Pierce Brosnan\nHow to watch: Black Bag is now streaming on Peacock.\n4. Bring Her Back\nIn 2023, filmmaking duo Danny Philippou and Michael Philippou awed critics and horror fans with their haunted hand hit Talk to Me. Now, they return with a gnarly psycho-biddy horror offering starring two-time Academy Award\u2013nominee Sally Hawkins. The result is a nail-biting film that might have you gagging, covering your eyes, or experiencing some hard-won catharsis.\nThe Philippou brothers probe into grief once again, exploring how this unmooring feeling can make the world around us feel unreal, hostile, and strange. In Bring Her Back, Hawkins stars as a foster mom named Laura, who takes in young orphans like Oliver (Jonah Wren Phillips), and siblings Piper (Sora Wong) and Andy (Billy Barratt). But despite Laura's chipper demeanor, 17-year-old Andy realizes something is off in her remote forest home. But can he stop the hell that's coming?\nIn my review for Mashable, I wrote, \"Bring Her Back is extraordinary. For those who found Talk to Me sensationally scary, this follow-up will thrill with its deeply deranged tale of heartache and body horror. But the Philippous went deeper, presenting a character-driven drama with flares of psycho-biddy and religious horror. That heady combination not only makes for a satisfyingly scary as hell movie, but also a profound one.\"\nStarring: Sally Hawkins, Billy Barratt, Sora Wong, Jonah Wren Phillips, and Sally-Anne Upton\nHow to watch: Bring Her Back is now in theaters.\n3. The Ballad of Wallis Island\nYou might have missed this feel-good movie when it hit theaters, but don't sleep on the chance to enjoy it at home. Perhaps while wearing a cozy sweater to be lavish in comfort.\nWritten and starring Tom Basden and Tim Key, this Focus Features gem imagines what would happen if a lonely but lovely folk-rock fan won the lottery. In The Ballad of Wallis Island, Charles (Key), who lives on the remote island, uses heaps of cash to reunite his favorite band, McGwyer Mortimer. There's just one problem. This folk duo \u2014 made up of Herb McGwyer (Basden) and Nell Mortimer (Carey Mulligan) \u2014 weren't just a band, but also a couple, who broke up hard. So, this reunion concert is socially awkward, to say the least.\nAdapted from an award-winning short film Basden and Key made with director James Griffiths, The Ballad of Wallis Island creates an enveloping village atmosphere. Then it plops down a flailing rock star and his chipper ex to create some sparks and lots of laughs. In my review out of SXSW 2025, I cheered, \"The Ballad of Wallis Island is not only deeply charming and laugh-out-loud funny for all its social foibles and comedy duo banter, but it's also cathartic....as Basden and Key strike their final chord of this masterfully charted comedy, you feel it reverberate warmly in your heart, carrying you out of the theater with a song still playing there.\"\nStarring: Tim Key, Tom Basden, Sian Clifford, Akemnji Ndifornyen, and Carey Mulligan\nHow to watch: The Ballad of Wallis Island is available for rental or purchase on Prime Video.\n2. Pee-wee as Himself\nBetween Pee-wee's Playhouse and Pee-wee's Big Adventure, Pee-wee Herman was an '80s icon adored by kids and grown-ups alike. But a scandal in 1991 brought Paul Reubens, the man behind the children's show, into a cruel tabloid spotlight. Since then, Reubens rebuilt his reputation and broadened his career, appearing in movies like Mystery Men, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Matilda. But the scorch of scandal kept Reubens reluctant to be open with the public about his life and loves \u2014 that is, until documentarian Matt Wolf began collaborating with the comedian for Pee-wee as Himself.\nThough Reubens died of cancer before the film was wrapped, Wolf has built an empathetic and comprehensive portrait of the man, the artist, and the enigma. Told in two parts, this HBO documentary explores not only Reuben's inspirations for his most popular character, but also his queerness, and why he chose to go back into the closet to pursue a career in Hollywood.\nIn my review out of Sundance, I wrote, \"Pee-wee as Himself is not a simple love letter to the iconic character or Reubens. That would suggest Wolf goes easy on either, fawning over them without reservation. This is something greater...Thought-provoking, boldly funny, and emotionally riveting, Pee-wee as Himself is [Reuben's] gift to us as grown-ups, as it reveals how hard that lesson can be, and how we must keep pushing ourselves to learn it.\"\nStarring: Paul Reubens, Lynne Marie Stewart, Laurence Fishburne, Natasha Lyonne, Cassandra Peterson (aka Elvira: Mistress of the Dark), Debi Mazar, and David Arquette\nHow to watch: Pee-wee as Himself is now streaming on HBO Max.\n1. Sinners\nRyan Coogler reunited with Michael B. Jordan, star of his critically heralded films, Black Panther, Fruitvale Station, and Creed. With Sinners, the two set the bar against which every other 2025 movie would be compared \u2014 not to mention every vampire movie from here to eternity.\nJordan stars as the Smokestack Twins, gangsters turned juke joint-proprietors whose opening night is crashed by a vicious vampire (Jack O'Connell), who craves the blood of their magical bluesman (Miles Caton in a jaw-dropping debut). Weaving folk lore, hoodoo practices, and history into the vampire subgenre, Coogler, who wrote and directed, built a world so rich that it could only be properly appreciated in 70mm IMAX. And in a time where naysayers are ringing the bell for the death of movie theaters, audiences came in such numbers that Sinners got a 70mm IMAX re-release to meet demand.\nTikTok has been exploding with fans digging into every detail of the film, and we got in on the fun too! Critics praised the epic scope Coogler applied to his genre-fluid drama \u2014 which might be a horror musical. And audiences swooned over the ensemble, who were radiant as they created characters complex and compelling.\nIn my review of the film, I cheered, \"Sinners is more than a hell of a thrilling vampire movie. Like Black Panther, it expands beyond the expectations of its genre to become a magnificent film, emanating with spirit, power, and purpose. Smoothly blending vampire horror into a unique tale of regret, resilience, and redemption, Coogler and Jordan have made a cinematic marvel that is terrifying, satisfying, and unforgettable.\"\nStarring: Michael B. Jordan, Hailee Steinfeld, Miles Caton, Jack O'Connell, Wunmi Mosaku, Jayme Lawson, Omar Miller, Li Jun Li, Yao, Lola Kirke, and Delroy Lindo\nHow to watch: Sinners is now in theaters and is available for rent or purchase on Prime Video.\nTopics Film Watch Guides How to Watch\nKristy Puchko is the Entertainment Editor at Mashable.

      "text": "A rundown of the new LG TVs from CES, plus some deals on old ones\nUPDATE: Jan. 21, 2025, 12:45 p.m. EST LG dropped new versions of its flagship OLED and QNED TVs at CES, pushing discounts up to $1,500 on 2023 and 2023 flagship LG TVs. Several prices have dropped further since our original coverage of these deals on Jan. 16. New deals on several sizes of the 2024 G4 TV have also popped up.\nIn case you forgot, LG is the authority on cool screens. From a 5K2K bendable gaming monitor to another portable TV to quite a few regular ol' TVs, the brand's CES 2025 showcase didn't come to play.\nNew LG OLEDs are brighter and zippier than ever\nLG has completely switched up its whole OLED panel situation for 2025. Its two new flagship OLEDs, the M5 and the G5, will be lit by a \"four stack engineering process\" rather than the MLA (Micro Lens Array) panels it had been using. You can get into the weeds on that tech elsewhere on Google, here's the short version: It's a new lighting panel featuring a fourth OLED layer, and that means brightness, brightness, brightness.\nThe LG M5 will likely be the most expensive TV in LG's 2025 OLED lineup, but not 100 percent for the reasons you're thinking. While it will have a lot of LG's best specs for picture quality, it'll be special in another way to gamers: it can wirelessly display the content you're casting to it from a console.\nEqually as exciting (from a performance standpoint) is the announcement of the LG G5 OLED. Cost-wise, it'll likely run a bit cheaper than the M5. But that ranking doesn't take away from the fact that it's about to be a beast for gamers and avid movie watchers, packing a lot of premium value into a price that'll likely feel more doable for the average household.\nNoteworthy G5 specs include a 165Hz refresh rate (a rarity in a sea of 144Hz TVs), four HDMI 2.1 ports, and Brighter Booster Ultimate mode to make it pop 40 percent more than its predecessor, the G4. LG also says that the G5's peak brightness is three times higher than that of the B5, which was also announced at CES. Unlike the G4 line, the G5 is LG's first flagship OLED that'll come in 48 inches.\nThe LG C5 and B5 OLEDs were also announced and, as expected, will be LG's more entry-level OLED TVs.\nNew LG QNEDs *checks notes* ditch quantum dots\nLG hasn't yet mastered QNED like it has OLED, but damn, it is trying. LG's 2025 crop of QNED TVs got just as much of an internal makeover as the OLED stacks did: Traditional quantum dots are out, some tech called \"Dynamic QNED Color Solution\" is in. LG hasn't given much intel into what this means past the fact that it focuses on a wider color gamut, using fluorescent elements to more accurately convert light into purer, more vibrant colors.\nContributing to a richer viewing experience is a feature called Dynamic Tone Mapping Pro: an AI-fueled tool that fine tunes HDR effects and zoned brightening for each scene. That AI simultaneously keeps tabs on each scene's audio, quickly separating background noise from voices and making those voices clearer.\nThe most premium QNED of the 2025 bunch, the QNED92, also features a mini-LED backlight. The mid-tier and entry-level models, the QNED9M and QNED85, both feature regular LED backlights in tandem with the new color gamut system mentioned above. Oddly enough, it's the mid-tier LG QNED that got outfitted with the Zero Connect box for wireless console transmission.\nAll LG TVs announced at CES are expected to be released in the spring.\nDon't feel like waiting (or paying) for LG's latest and greatest TVs? You have LG options from years past to shop on sale right now. As of Jan. 16, several 2023 and 2024 LG OLED and QNED models are quietly on sale at Best Buy \u2014 just in time to upgrade your NFL playoffs watching experience.\nLG OLED TVs on sale\n2024 LG 55-inch B4 OLED 4K TV \u2014 $999.99\n$1,399.99(save $400)2024 LG 55-inch G4 OLED 4K TV \u2014 $1,999.99\n$2,499.99(save $500)2024 LG 65-inch C4 OLED 4K TV \u2014 $1,499.99\n$1,799.99(save $300)2024 LG 65-inch G4 OLED 4K TV \u2014 $2,399.99\n$3,099.99(save $700)2023 LG 77-inch C3 OLED 4K TV \u2014 $1,699.99\n$2,299.99(save $600)2024 LG 77-inch B4 OLED 4K TV \u2014 $1,799.99\n$2,499.99(save $700)2024 LG 77-inch G4 OLED 4K TV \u2014 $3,499.99\n$4,299.99(save $800)2024 LG 83-inch C4 OLED 4K TV \u2014 $3,299.99\n$4,499.99(save $1,200)\nLG QNED TVs on sale\n2024 LG 43-inch 80 Series QNED 4K TV \u2014 $429.99\n$549.99(save $120)2024 LG 65-inch 80 Series QNED 4K TV \u2014 $699.99\n$899.99(save $200)2023 LG 50-inch 75 Series QNED 4K TV \u2014 $449.99\n$549.99(save $100)2024 LG 98-inch 89 Series QNED 4K TV \u2014 $3,999.99\n$5,999.99(save $2,000)\nTopics CES\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers and tests essential home tech like vacuums and TVs, plus eco-friendly hacks.

      "text": "Fall TV preview: 25 TV shows you need to know, and where to stream them\nSummer's nearly over, and you know what that means: It's almost time to cozy up at home, wrap yourself in some blankets, and binge boatloads of fall TV.\nAnd boy oh boy, is a lot of TV coming our way this fall and winter. Old favorites like Only Murders in the Building and Stranger Things make their triumphant returns, while plenty of new series \u2014 including an Office spin-off! \u2014 pique our interests.\nMissing Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul? Brace yourself for Vince Gilligan's sci-fi series, Pluribus. Looking for a sports comedy in the vein of Ted Lasso? Try the Glen Powell-led Chad Powers. What about some horror in time for Halloween season? Check out It prequel It: Welcome to Derry, or the much more comedic Haunted Hotel.\nThat's just the tip of the iceberg of the TV that'll be closing out 2025, and while it may seem overwhelming, we're here to help. We've picked out 25 titles for you to peruse over a wide variety of genres. Plus, we've sorted everything by streaming service, so you can figure out which shows you'll have access to, or which streamer you'll need to get in order to catch an upcoming series that strikes your fancy. Dive on in, and happy streaming!\nWhat's new to AMC+ this fall?\nWhile AMC's current crown jewel, Interview with the Vampire, won't be back until 2026, AMC is offering up a new story set within Anne Rice's Immortal Universe that's sure to intrigue fans of the supernatural. All just in time for Halloween!\nTalamasca: The Secret Order\nAs fans of Interview with the Vampire eagerly await the show's third season (re-titled The Vampire Lestat), they can sink their fangs into other corners of AMC's Immortal Universe thanks to the release of Talamasca: The Secret Order. The spin-off series draws from Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and Lives of the Mayfair Witches.\nIn Rice's work, and in the show, the Talamasca is a secret society that monitors the world's supernatural activity. We're talking vampires, witches, demons, and more. Interview with the Vampire already gave viewers a taste of the Talamasca in Season 2, but based on Talamasca's first trailer, there's so much more supernatural goodness where that came from. As if that weren't enough, Interview with the Vampire's Daniel Molloy (Eric Bogosian) is set to make an appearance in Talamasca, suggesting major overlap between the shows.\nStarring: Nicholas Denton, Elizabeth McGovern, William Fichtner, Maisie Richardson-Sellers, C\u00e9line Buckens, Jason Schwartzman, and Eric Bogosian\nHow to watch: Talamasca: The Secret Order premieres Oct. 26 at 9 p.m. ET on AMC and AMC+.\nWhat's new to Apple TV+ this fall?\nSeveral of Apple TV+'s biggest shows are returning this fall, including the Emmy\u2013winning Slow Horses and The Morning Show. But the most intriguing title has to be the sci-fi series Pluribus, from Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul creator Vince Gilligan.\nThe Last Frontier\nBetween 2023's Hijack and the upcoming The Last Frontier, Apple TV+ is really starting to lean into the genre of \"shows where something goes horribly wrong on a plane.\" In The Last Frontier's case, that \"something wrong\" is a full-on plane crash in the Alaskan wilderness. The plane in question is a prison transport, and the crash allows dozens of its violent passengers to escape. (Think Con Air meets The Grey.)\nNow, it's up to U.S. Marshal Frank Remnick (Jason Clarke) to protect a nearby town from the escaped passengers. However, he's got a sneaking suspicion that the crash wasn't an accident at all, but part of a larger conspiracy.\nStarring: Jason Clarke, Dominic Cooper, Haley Bennett, Simone Kessell, Dallas Goldtooth, Tait Blum, and Alfre Woodard\nHow to watch: The Last Frontier premieres Oct. 10 on Apple TV+.\nLoot, Season 3\nYou could always use more Maya Rudolph in your life, so be sure to get your required Rudolph dose with Season 3 of Loot.\nThe show follows billionaire Molly Wells (Rudolph), who's on a mission to use her $87 billion divorce settlement to do good with her philanthropic organization, the Wells Foundation. On top of Rudolph, Loot boasts a stacked ensemble cast that includes Joel Kim Booster, Michaela Ja\u00e9 Rodriguez, Nat Faxon, and Ron Funches.\nStarring: Maya Rudolph, Joel Kim Booster, Michaela Ja\u00e9 Rodriguez, Nat Faxon, Ron Funches, Stephanie Styles, D\u2019Arcy Carden, Adam Scott, Zane Phillips, and Henry Winkler\nHow to watch: Loot Season 3 premieres Oct. 15 on Apple TV+.\nThe Morning Show, Season 4\nIt's time to tune back into UBA, because The Morning Show returns this fall. Season 4 picks up two years after the events of Season 3. The UBA-NBN merger is officially complete, and several new players are entering the broadcasting game to either ally themselves or butt heads with the likes of Alex (Jennifer Aniston) and Bradley (Reese Witherspoon). New cast members include Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons, William Jackson Harper, and Boyd Holbrook.\nThe Morning Show showrunner Charlotte Stoudt has teased that Season 4 will touch on pressing concerns like deepfakes and AI. But more importantly, what will the show do to top sending Bradley to space in Season 3?\nStarring: Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon, Billy Crudup, Mark Duplass, Karen Pittman, Greta Lee, Nestor Carbonell, Jon Hamm, Nicole Beharie, Marion Cotillard, Jeremy Irons, Boyd Holbrook, William Jackson Harper, and Aaron Pierre\nHow to watch: The Morning Show Season 4 premieres Sept. 17 on Apple TV+.\nPluribus\nBreaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan and Rhea Seehorn proved a match made in heaven in Better Call Saul. This fall, the dream team reunites for Pluribus, a genre-bending show about how the most miserable person on Earth must save the world from happiness. Plot details are otherwise shrouded in secrecy, but between the Gilligan-Seehorn reunion and the fact that Apple TV+ has already picked the show up for a second season, we're absolutely seated.\nStarring: Rhea Seehorn, Karolina Wydra, Carlos-Manuel Vesga, Miriam Shor, and Samba Schutte\nHow to watch: Pluribus premieres Nov. 7 on Apple TV+.\nSlow Horses, Season 5\nThe Emmy\u2013winning espionage drama Slow Horses returns for its highly anticipated fifth season, based on Mick Herron's fifth Slough House book, London Rules. (Shout out to the show for putting out five seasons since its 2022 premiere \u2014 I admire the efficiency.)\nThis time around, the Slow Horses, led by Jackson Lamb (Gary Oldman), are investigating a series of increasingly bizarre events befalling London. Expect tech specialist Roddy Ho (Christopher Chung) to take on a bigger role this season, especially since his glamorous new girlfriend makes the whole team suspicious.\nStarring: Gary Oldman, Kristin Scott Thomas, Jack Lowden, Saskia Reeves, Rosalind Eleazar, Christopher Chung, Aimee-Ffion Edwards, Ruth Bradley, James Callis, Tom Brooke, Jonathan Pryce, and Nick Mohammed\nHow to watch: Slow Horses premieres Sept. 24 on Apple TV+.\nWhat's new to Disney+ this fall?\nIt's a franchise-heavy fall for Disney+, which welcomes back Percy Jackson and the Olympians and introduces a new Marvel hero in Wonder Man.\nPercy Jackson and the Olympians, Season 2\nGet excited, demigods! We're headed back to Camp Half-Blood for Percy Jackson and the Olympians Season 2, which adapts Rick Riordan's The Sea of Monsters. Book readers know that there will be no rest for Percy (Walker Scobell) after he successfully returned Zeus's Master Bolt in Season 1. Now, he faces another dangerous quest: Find the Golden Fleece in the Bermuda Triangle \u2014 and hopefully save his missing bestie, Grover (Aryan Simhadri), on the way.\nLuckily, he won't be alone: Annabeth (Leah Sava Jeffries) is along for the ride, as is Percy's half-brother, Tyson (Daniel Diemer). Expect larger roles for Clarisse (Dior Goodjohn) and Luke (Charlie Bushnell) too, and the arrival of more monsters straight out of Greek myth. Scylla and Charybdis, here we come.*\nStarring: Walker Scobell, Leah Sava Jeffries, Aryan Simhadri, Charlie Bushnell, Dior Goodjohn, Glynn Turman, Jason Mantzoukas, Toby Stephens, Virginia Kull, Daniel Diemer, Tamara Smart, Andra Day, Timothy Simons, Sandra Bernhard, Kristen Schaal, and Margaret Cho\nHow to watch: Percy Jackson and the Olympians Season 2 premieres Dec. 10 on Disney+.\nWonder Man\nThe MCU gets meta with Wonder Man, a miniseries about struggling actor Simon Williams (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) auditioning for the role of a superhero, only to become a superhero himself.\nCreated by Shang-Chi director Destin Daniel Cretton and 30 Rock and Community writer Andrew Guest, Wonder Man is a show under the \"Marvel Spotlight\" banner, meaning you won't need to watch other MCU shows to understand what's going on. Still, that doesn't mean you won't be seeing any familiar faces from the MCU. Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley), of Iron Man 3 and Shang-Chi fame, will be popping up, presumably as another actor in Simon's circle.*\nStarring: Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Ben Kingsley, Demetrius Grosse, Ed Harris, Lauren Glazier, Josh Gad, Byron Bowers, and Manny McCord\nHow to watch: Wonder Man premieres this December on Disney+.\nWhat's new to Hulu/FX this fall?\nOn top of the return of Only Murders in the Building, Hulu and FX are launching several exciting new shows this fall, including noir The Lowdown, sports comedy Chad Powers, and campy legal drama All's Fair.\nAll's Fair\nNew Ryan Murphy show alert! For his upcoming legal drama All's Fair, the TV mogul is teaming back up with Kim Kardashian for their second collaboration since American Horror Story Season 12. This time, though, Kardashian is the lead, which is an... intriguing move given the who's who of powerhouse actresses Murphy has cast alongside her: Naomi Watts, Niecy Nash-Betts, Teyana Taylor, Sarah Paulson, and Glenn Close. Will Kardashian be able to hold her own against these Emmy and Oscar nominees and winners?\nAll's Fair centers on a team of female divorce attorneys who leave a male-dominated firm and start their own practice. There, they weather scandals, secrets, and in-fighting (and wear many, many glamorous fur coats). With this one, we're hoping for scenery chewing, great one-liners, and camp.\nStarring: Kim Kardashian, Naomi Watts, Niecy Nash-Betts, Teyana Taylor, Matthew Noszka, Sarah Paulson, and Glenn Close\nHow to watch: All's Fair premieres this fall on Hulu.\nChad Powers\nRemember when Eli Manning went undercover as a man named Chad Powers at Penn State\u2019s walk-on football tryouts? Well, that video is now the basis for an entire TV show, starring Glen Powell (Hit Man, Twisters). The move (and the show's sports focus) calls to mind the creation of Ted Lasso, since the character originally starred in ads for NBC's coverage of the premier league.\nCreated by Michael Waldron (Loki) and Powell, Chad Powers introduces quarterback Russ Holliday (Powell), whose bad behavior puts an unceremonious end to his college career. To get back in the game, Russ walks onto a struggling Southern football team disguised as the charming Chad Powers. (Of course he's charming \u2014 he's played by Glen Powell.) Could Russ' alter ego help the team turn over a new leaf, and improve his own behavior?*\nStarring: Glen Powell, Steve Zahn, Toby Huss, Perry Mattfeld, Clayne Crawford, Wynn Everett, Frankie A. Rodriguez, Colton Ryan, Keese Wilson, Xavier Mills, and Quentin Plair\nHow to watch: Chad Powers premieres Sept. 30 on Hulu.\nThe Lowdown\nSterlin Harjo, creator of the Emmy\u2013nominated and Peabody Award\u2013winning Reservation Dogs, returns to FX for noir series The Lowdown. The series stars Ethan Hawke \u2014 who collaborated with Harjo in one of Reservation Dogs' best episodes \u2014 as Tulsa citizen journalist Lee Raybon. As a self-proclaimed \"truthstorian,\" Lee is obsessed with uncovering the truth. However, that obsession can land him in some pretty hot water, especially once he tangles with the powerful Washberg family. A mysterious conspiracy and a Harjo-Hawke team-up? We're sold.\nStarring: Ethan Hawke, Ryan Kiera Armstrong, Kaniehtiio Horn, Tim Blake Nelson, Jeanne Tripplehorn, Kyle MacLachlan, and Keith David\nHow to watch: The Lowdown premieres Sept. 23 at 9 p.m. ET on FX. Episodes stream the next day on Hulu.\nOnly Murders in the Building, Season 5\nRing in the fall with a return to the Arconia, the most murder-ridden building in all of New York City. That's right, Only Murders in the Building is back for Season 5, giving podcasting trio Charles-Haden Savage (Steve Martin), Oliver Putnam (Martin Short), and Mabel Mora (Selena Gomez) yet another case to solve. This time around, the murder victim is Arconia doorman Lester (Teddy Coluca). Based on the trailer, his untimely death could have ties to the New York mob \u2014 or to a group of billionaires who keep skulking around crime scenes.\nWho plays these billionaires, you may ask? None other than Christoph Waltz, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, and Logan Lerman, three major names joining Only Murders' already impressive list of guest stars. They're not alone, though: This season also adds T\u00e9a Leoni, Bobby Cannavale, Beanie Feldstein, Jermaine Fowler, Keegan-Michael Key, and Dianne Wiest to the mix, while Meryl Streep, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Richard Kind, Nathan Lane, and Michael Cyril Creighton are all set to return. Which of these stars will make it out alive, and which one is a murderer? Tune in to Season 5 to get the scoop.\nStarring: Steve Martin, Martin Short, Selena Gomez, Michael Cyril Creighton, Teddy Coluca, Christoph Waltz, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Logan Lerman, T\u00e9a Leoni, Bobby Cannavale, Beanie Feldstein, Jermaine Fowler, Keegan-Michael Key, Dianne Wiest, Meryl Streep, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Richard Kind, and Nathan Lane\nHow to watch: Only Murders in the Building Season 5 premieres Sept. 9 on Hulu.\nWhat's new to HBO/HBO Max this fall?\nFrom horror title It: Welcome to Derry to gritty crime drama Task, tune into HBO Max's fall programming if you want an extra dose of tension.\nIt: Welcome to Derry\nNo, It: Welcome to Derry isn't about Pennywise the clown (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) joining up with the Derry Girls crew. (But wouldn't that be delightful?)\nInstead, this prequel to Andy Muschietti's It films takes us back to Derry, Maine, in 1962, when Pennywise last awoke to frighten the living daylights out of the children of Derry. According to Entertainment Weekly, It: Welcome to Derry draws inspiration from Mike Hanlon's interludes in Stephen King's It, which means book fans can look out for key moments like the racially motivated burning of the Black Spot, a Derry club that served Black customers.*\nStarring: Jovan Adepo, Chris Chalk, Taylour Paige, James Remar, Stephen Rider, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, Madeleine Stowe, Alixandra Fuchs, Kimberly Guerrero, Dorian Grey, Thomas Mitchell, BJ Harrison, Peter Outerbridge, Shane Marriott, Chad Rook, Joshua Odjick, Morningstar Angeline, and Rudy Mancuso\nHow to watch: It: Welcome to Derry premieres this October on HBO and HBO Max.\nTask\nLooking for a crime drama in the vein of Mare of Easttown? Then you're in luck, because Mare of Easttown creator Brad Ingelsby is returning to HBO with the miniseries Task.\nThe series stars Mark Ruffalo as an FBI agent who heads up a task force investigating a string of violent robberies in the working class suburbs of Philadelphia. At the head of these robberies is an unsuspecting family man (Ozark's Tom Pelphrey) looking to give his kids a better life. Get ready for a gritty cat-and-mouse game between Ruffalo and Pelphrey, who lead an exciting (and sprawling) ensemble cast.\nStarring: Mark Ruffalo, Martha Plimpton, Mireille Enos, Tom Pelphrey, Emilia Jones, Thuso Mbedu, Ra\u00fal Castillo, Jamie McShane, Sam Keeley, Fabien Frankel, Alison Oliver, Owen Teague, Dominic Col\u00f3n, Margarita Levieva, Raphael Sbarge, Mickey Sumner, Elvis Nolasco, Colin Bates, Isaach De Bankol\u00e9, Phoebe Fox, Silvia Dionicio, and Coral Pe\u00f1a\nHow to watch: Task premieres Sept. 7 on HBO and HBO Max.\nWhat's new to Netflix this fall?\nThe biggest story on Netflix this fall is undoubtedly the final season of Stranger Things, Season 5. While that epic last chapter doesn't kick off until Nov. 26, there's still so much to look forward to before then, like the cartoon Haunted Hotel and mysterious limited series Wayward.\nBlack Rabbit\nJude Law and Jason Bateman team up for Black Rabbit, a gritty drama about two brothers who are big players in the New York nightlife scene. Law plays Jake Friedkin, the owner of Black Rabbit, a high-profile restaurant and VIP lounge. Black Rabbit is set to become New York's hottest destination, but the unexpected return of Jake's troublesome brother, Vince (Bateman), throws Black Rabbit into chaos. As past traumas and new opponents collide, Jake and Vince will have to stand strong together if they want the business they've built to survive.\nStarring: Jude Law, Jason Bateman, Cleopatra Coleman, Amaka Okafor, \u1e62\u1ecdp\u1eb9\u0301 D\u00ecr\u00eds\u00f9, Dagmara Domi\u0144czyk, Chris Coy, Troy Kotsur, Abbey Lee, Odessa Young, Robin De Jesus, Amir Malaklou, Don Harvey, Forrest Weber, Francis Benhamou, Gus Birney, John Ales, and Steve Witting\nHow to watch: Black Rabbit premieres Sept. 18 on Netflix.\nHaunted Hotel\nRick and Morty fans, your new cartoon obsession may be close at hand in Netflix's Haunted Hotel. Created by Rick and Morty writer Matt Roller, the series is also executive produced by Dan Harmon and Steve Levy. That's already a lot of creative overlap between the two shows, even before we get to Haunted Hotel's zany premise.\nThe series checks viewers into the Undervale, a hotel plagued with all manner of ghosts and demons. Single mother Katherine (voiced by Eliza Coupe) runs the establishment with help from her estranged brother Nathan (Will Forte), who also happens to be one of the hotel's ghosts.

Other Peacock titles of note include the Sarah Snook-led thriller All Her Fault and true crime drama Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy.\nAll Her Fault\nAfter watching Sarah Snook's Emmy\u2013winning work as Shiv Roy in Succession, I'd watch her in anything. Lucky me, then, as Snook is back on TV in thriller All Her Fault. Snook plays Marissa Irvine, a mother who goes to pick up her son Milo from his first playdate. However, the woman who answers the door isn't someone Marissa recognizes. Not only that, this woman has never even heard of Milo. What follows is a parent's worst nightmare, all based on the novel by Andrea Mara.\nStarring: Sarah Snook, Jake Lacy, Dakota Fanning, Michael Pe\u00f1a, Sophia Lillis, Abby Elliott, Daniel Monks, Jay Ellis, Thomas Cocquerel, Duke McCloud, and Kartiah Vergara\nHow to watch: All Her Fault premieres Nov. 6 on Peacock.\nDevil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy\nPeacock delivers a dose of true crime this fall with limited series Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy. The show tackles one of America's most notorious serial killers in John Wayne Gacy (Severance's Michael Chernus), who became known as the \"Killer Clown\" due to his appearances at events like children's birthday parties while dressed as Pogo the Clown.\nFrom 1972 to 1978, Gacy kidnapped, raped, and murdered 33 men and teenage boys, burying 26 of them in the crawlspace of his suburban Illinois home. Hoping to avoid sensationalizing their deaths in the series, Devil in Disguise showrunner Patrick Macmanus opted not to depict any of the victims' murders, telling Vanity Fair he wanted to focus more on their lives outside of their encounters with Gacy.\nStarring: Michael Chernus, Gabriel Luna, James Badge Dale, Michael Angarano, Chris Sullivan, and Marin Ireland\nHow to watch: Devil in Disguise: John Wayne Gacy premieres Oct. 16 on Peacock.\nThe Paper\nReturn to the world of The Office in The Paper, an Office spin-off from Greg Daniels and Michael Koman. The series picks back up with the documentary crew that followed Dunder Mifflin. This time, though, they've got their sights set on a different target: the Toledo Truth Teller, a once-historic local newspaper that's now struggling. Idealistic editor-in-chief Ned (Domhnall Gleeson) hopes to turn the Truth Teller around with the help of volunteer reporters, but how can they restore the Truth Teller to its glory days when they've never written a story before?\nFans of The Office will get a kick out of The Paper's workplace cringe comedy and the return of Oscar (Oscar Nu\u00f1ez). But The Paper stands on its own two feet, building a lovable newsroom in its own right and cementing itself as one of fall's can't-miss comedies.\nStarring: Domhnall Gleeson, Sabrina Impacciatore, Chelsea Frei, Oscar Nu\u00f1ez, Melvin Gregg, Gbemisola Ikumelo, Alex Edelman, Ramona Young, and Tim Key\nHow to watch: The Paper premieres Sept. 4 on Peacock.\nWhat's new to Prime Video this fall?\nIf you love genre fiction, chances are Prime Video's got something for you this fall. Love video game adaptations? Good news, Fallout's back! What about superhero stories with some edge? Dig into Gen V Season 2. And if you want fantasy adventuring, check out Critical Role's The Mighty Nein.\nFallout, Season 2\nSeason 1 of Fallout cemented itself as one of the best video game adaptations of all time, racking up critical acclaim and 16 Emmy nominations, including one win for Outstanding Music Supervision. With the imminent arrival of Season 2, it's time to head back to the wasteland and catch up with Lucy (Ella Purnell), Maximus (Aaron Moten), the Ghoul (Walton Goggins), and more.\nThe end of Season 1 saw Lucy turn against her father, Hank (Kyle MacLachlan), and fully join forces with the Ghoul, while Maximus was knighted as part of the Brotherhood of Steel. So what's next for these wasteland dwellers? Given that Hank was headed to New Vegas in the Season 1 finale, it looks like we'll be getting elements from Fallout: New Vegas. Hopefully we'll also get some killer MacLachlan TikTok promotion along with it.\nStarring: Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Walton Goggins, and Kyle MacLachlan\nHow to watch: Fallout Season 2 premieres Dec. 17 on Prime Video.\nGen V, Season 2\nGen V took the gore and shock value of The Boys to college in its spectacular first season. Now school's back in session at Godolkin University, and things look bleak for Marie Moreau (Jaz Sinclair) and her crew.\nOff-campus, war is brewing between humans and supes, as Homelander (Antony Starr) rules America with an iron fist. On-campus, Godolkin has a sinister new dean (Hamish Linklater) who's determined to push students to their limits. Plus, the mysterious Project Odessa \u2014 also mentioned in Season 4 of The Boys \u2014 keeps coming up. That's not the only The Boys crossover on display, though. According to Gen V Season 2's trailer, Marie will cross paths with Annie/Starlight (Erin Moriarty). Could this be an incredible team-up, or will it end in disaster for both heroines?\nStarring: Jaz Sinclair, Lizze Broadway, Maddie Phillips, London Thor, Derek Luh, and Asa German\nHow to watch: Gen V Season 2 hits Prime Video on Sept. 17.\nThe Mighty Nein\nCritical Role struck gold adapting their first live-streamed Dungeons & Dragons campaign into The Legend of Vox Machina, an animated adventure that gets better season after season. Now, they look to do it again with The Mighty Nein, which adapts Critical Role's second campaign. (The series gets hour-long episodes, as opposed to The Legend of Vox Machina's half-hour installments.)\nThe Mighty Nein introduces a brand-new adventuring party made up of fugitives and outcasts, each with their own dark secrets and trauma. Their first major mission? Saving the world from wrongdoers who would misuse the powerful arcane relic known as \"the Beacon.\" The very fabric of reality depends on their success. Expect magical hijinks, killer fight scenes, and a whole crew of heroes you may get way attached to, way too fast.\nStarring: Laura Bailey, Taliesin Jaffe, Ashley Johnson, Matthew Mercer, Liam O'Brien, Marisha Ray, Sam Riegel, and Travis Willingham\nHow to watch: The Mighty Nein premieres Nov. 19 on Prime Video.\n(*) means that a blurb has come from a previous list.\nTopics Streaming Watch Guides\nBelen Edwards is an Entertainment Reporter at Mashable.

      "text": "Your guide to watching college football without cable this season\nTable of Contents\nThe 2025 college football season kicks off Aug. 23 with a matchup between Iowa State and Kansas State in Dublin for Week 0. Thankfully, there are no sweeping conference changes or shake-ups this year, which is a relief after the scrambling that happened prior to last season. The 12-team playoff format is still in place, but the seeding of the teams will differ from last year. There are also some minor rule changes to combat the faking of injuries and to timeouts in overtime. No biggies, though. The most complicated thing about the 2025-2026 NCAA football season is figuring out how to watch your favorite team.\nDon't worry; we've got you covered. Keep scrolling to learn how to watch college football without cable in 2025, which channels you're going to need, and the best ways to get them.\nCan I watch college football games without cable?\nYes, you can watch every college football game without cable. The only problem is that you may need a patchwork of streaming apps, depending on which teams and how many games you want to watch. The 2025 college football season will be broadcast across an array of local channels, specialty sports networks, and even a couple of streaming services.\nNewly launched streaming services from ESPN and Fox are really changing the game this season. ESPN's direct-to-consumer subscription now encompasses the full suite of ESPN networks and services for $29.99 per month, including ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPNEWS, ESPN Deportes, SEC Network, ACC Network, ESPN on ABC, ESPN+, ESPN3, SECN+, and ACCNX. Meanwhile, Fox One is a one-stop shop for the entirety of the Fox TV portfolio. It costs $19.99 per month and includes access to Fox News, Fox Sports, Fox Weather, FS1, FS2, Fox Business, Fox Deportes, Big Ten Network (B1G), local Fox stations, and Fox Network. These two apps alone will give you access to the majority of college football games this season, and as of Oct. 2, you'll be able to bundle them together for a discounted rate.\nA live TV streaming service or cable replacement will give you the most comprehensive channel selection overall, but will also cost you the most money (i.e., YouTube TV or Fubo). You can also subscribe to a standalone service like Peacock or Paramount+ if you just want to casually tune into a few games throughout the season. As the cheapest option, it's also the most limited.\nTL;DR: You get what you pay for.\nWhat channels are college football games on?\nBefore you decide on which live TV service or streaming app you need to watch NCAA college football games, you need to know which networks your team(s) plays on. Check the conference list below to see which channels and streamers will air games for each conference in 2025. Not sure which conference your team is in? Check out the list over at ESPN.com.\nAmerican Athletic Conference (AAC) \u2014 ABC, ESPN, ESPN 2, ESPN U, ESPN+\nAtlantic Coast Conference (ACC) \u2014 ABC, ACC Network, ACC Network Extra, ESPN, ESPN 2, ESPN U, ESPN+, The CW\nBig 12 \u2014 ABC, ESPN, ESPN 2, ESPN U, ESPN+, Fox, Fox Sports 1, TNT\nBig Ten \u2014 Big Ten Network, CBS, Fox, Fox Sports 1, NBC, Peacock\nConference USA \u2014 CBS Sports Network, ESPN, ESPN 2, ESPN U, ESPN+\nFBS independents \u2014 CBS, CBS Sports Network, ESPN, ESPN+, NBC, Peacock\nMid-American Conference (MAC) \u2014 CBS Sports Network, ESPN, ESPN 2, ESPN U, ESPN+\nMountain West Conference (MW) \u2014 CBS, CBS Sports Network, Fox, Fox Sports 1, truTV\nPac-12 Conference \u2014 CBS, ESPN, ESPN 2, ESPN U, ESPN+, The CW\nSoutheastern Conference (SEC) \u2014 ABC, ESPN, ESPN 2, ESPN U, ESPN+, SEC Network, SEC+\nSun Belt Conference \u2014 ABC, ESPN, ESPN 2, ESPN U, ESPN+\nWhat are the best streaming services for college football?\nAs I mentioned above, the best streaming service for college football depends on your team and budget. The best streaming apps for live sports run the gamut of pricing \u2014 from eight bucks per month to a monstrous $100 per month. The more you pay, the wider selection of games you'll have access to.\nThe best live TV cable alternatives include YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV, Fubo, and Sling. Sling is the most affordable of the bunch, but gives you access to a more limited live channel selection, while YouTube TV, Hulu, and Fubo offer hundreds of channels but cost a bit more. ESPN and Fox One offer a wide selection of games at a mid-range price point, making us more inclined to recommend these services for most people. We haven't had the opportunity to test these new streaming services out yet, but they certainly sound promising. You can also watch limited live games on Peacock, Paramount+, and HBO Max \u2014 some of which will exclusively host games this season.\nIt's a bit confusing, but at least it's not as difficult as figuring out how to watch every NFL game this season. To help with your decision, we've rounded up the best streaming deals for college football fans. You can also check out the complete broadcast schedule on the NCAA website.\nThe best live TV streaming deals for NCAAF 2025\nBest overall: ESPN Unlimited bundle\nChannels: ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPNEWS, ESPN Deportes, SEC Network, ACC Network, ESPN on ABC, ESPN+, ESPN3, SECN+, and ACCNX\nESPN's newly launched Unlimited plan gives you access to the entirety of ESPN's suite of networks and services. For college football, you'll have live access to games on ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPN+, SEC Network, SECN+, ACC Network, and ABC. That's a pretty big chunk \u2014 nearly 50 percent \u2014 of the channels you'll need to tune into games this season. The Unlimited plan on its own costs $29.99 per month, but for the first year, new subscribers can get the Unlimited plan bundled with Disney+ and Hulu for the same cost. That ultimately gives you Hulu and Disney+ for free for a year.\nCome Oct. 2, you'll also be able to bundle ESPN and Fox One together for just $39.99 per month ($9.98 cheaper than paying for both services separately).\nBest for Fox and Big Ten Network (B1G) games: Fox One annual subscription\nChannels: Fox, FS1, FS2, Big Ten Network\nFox conveniently launched its first streaming service the same day as ESPN's new Unlimited plan. It also offers a direct-to-consumer streaming model, giving subscribers access to live broadcasts on Fox, Fox Sports, FS1, FS2, and Big Ten Network throughout the college football season. It costs $19.99 per month, but you can save $40 by opting for the annual plan for $199.99 instead. Also, as noted above, you'll be able to bundle Fox One with ESPN come October for the ultimate sports streaming deal.\nBest cable alternative deal: $49.99/month for your first 3 months of YouTube TV\nChannels: ABC, ACC Network, Big Ten Network, CBS, CBS Sports Network, ESPN, ESPN 2, ESPNews, Fox, FS1, FS2, NBC, NBCSN, SEC Network, and The CW\nThe best value for a live TV cable alternative, YouTube TV gives you access to over 100 live channels. Those include most of the ones you need to watch college football games live \u2014 NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, and ESPN, as well as specialty networks like Fox Sports 1, and SEC Network. For a limited time, YouTube TV is offering new users a discount on their first three months of service. Plus, you can kick things off with a 10-day free trial. The base plan usually costs $82.99 per month, but you'll pay just $49.99 per month (save $99) for your first three months.\nRunner-up cable alternative deal: Sling Season Pass\nChannels: ABC, ACC Network, Big Ten Network, ESPN, ESPN 2, ESPN 3, ESPNews, ESPN U, Fox, FS1, FS2, NBC, Pac-12 Network, SEC Network\nBy prepaying for five months of Sling Orange, Blue, and Sports Extra in the Sling Season Pass, you can save about $51. The Orange and Blue packages give you access to FOX, NBC, ABC, ESPN, and more in local markets, while the Sports Extra package unlocks access to ACC Network, SEC Network, Big Ten Network, and more. It'll cost you $329 for five months of Sling Season Pass, which is significantly cheaper than any other live TV streaming service (about $66 per month). Just be sure to check your local market to ensure you'll have access to the channels you need.\nBest bang for your buck: Get Hulu + Live TV, Disney+, and ESPN together\nChannels: ABC, ACC Network, Big Ten Network, CBS, ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNews, ESPNU, ESPN Deportes, SEC Network, SECN+, ACC Network, ESPN+, Fox, FS1, FS2, NBC, and The CW\nWhile other live TV streamers might cost a little less, Hulu's live TV service definitely offers the most bang for your buck. You'll pay $82.99 per month (after a three-day trial) and get access to over 95 live TV channels, plus Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN Unlimited (all with ads). For comparison, YouTube TV is also $82.99 per month and only includes the live channels. With ESPN's new Unlimited plan, you'll unlock access to even more college football games on top of live TV networks like ABC, FOX, ESPN, The CW, ACC Network, and more.\nBest Fubo deal: Take $30 off your first month of Fubo\nChannels: ABC, ACC Network, Big Ten Network, CBS, CBS Sports Network, ESPN, ESPN 2, ESPNews, Fox, FS1, FS2, Marquee Sports Network, Monumental Sports, NBC, NBCSN, SEC Network, and The CW\nFubo isn't our first choice for a live TV streaming service, but we do like that it takes sports seriously. With a Pro subscription (the most affordable tier), you'll get access to most college football broadcasts for $84.99 per month. You can also upgrade to 4K with the Elite plan, but it'll cost $104.99 per month. Either way, you can test the waters for seven days before you pay and, for a limited time, take $30 off your first month.\nBest for CBS games only: Paramount+ Premium annual subscription\nChannels: CBS\nIf your team is in the Big Ten or plays on CBS and you're only a casual college football fan, a subscription to Paramount+ Premium is probably the best option. Paramount+ Premium allows you to tune into live CBS broadcasts of nearly two dozen Big Ten games, including a weekly, Saturday afternoon Big Ten game, starting Saturday, Aug. 30. It's regularly $12.99 per month, but you can save 17% by paying for a year upfront. That knocks the monthly cost down to just $9.99.\nBest for NBC and Peacock games: Peacock Premium yearly subscription\nChannels: NBC, Peacock\nSimilar to Paramount+, Peacock offers simulcasts of games airing on NBC throughout the 2025 season. Plus, Peacock offers exclusive broadcasts as well. In order to watch live games, you'll need at least the Premium plan, which starts at $10.99 per month. You can save about 17%, however, by paying for a year upfront. That knocks the monthly price down to about $9 per month.\nMore Peacock deals:\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWeek 1 of the NCAA football season kicks off on Aug. 28, 2025, though a few teams will kick off in Week Zero (which begins Aug. 23). The season typically lasts for 13 weeks and closes out with the Army vs. Navy game on Dec. 13, 2025.\nThe NCAA has set the following schedule for the college football playoffs and championship for the 2025-2026 season:\nQuarterfinals \u2014 Dec. 31-Jan. 1\nCotton Bowl: 7:30 p.m. on Dec. 31\nOrange Bowl: 12 p.m. on Jan. 1\nRose Bowl: 4 p.m. on Jan. 1\nSugar Bowl: 8 p.m. on Jan. 1\nSemifinals \u2014 Jan. 8-9\nFiesta Bowl: 7:39 p.m. on Jan. 8\nPeach Bowl: 7:30 p.m. on Jan. 9\nCFP National Championship \u2014 Jan. 19\n7:30 p.m. at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida\nAll bowl games and the CFP National Championship game will air on ESPN.\nOhio State won the College Football Playoff National Championship during the 2024-2025 season. Michigan and Georgia won the prior two seasons. Here's a complete list of the college football national champions.\nLike in the NFL, if the game is tied after four quarters, it goes to overtime, where officials invite the team's captains to the 50-yard line for a coin toss. But that's about where the similarities end. Overtime periods in college football consist of a two-possession series \u2014 each team gets one possession on offense and one on defense. The team on offense always starts at the designated 25-yard line (unless there's a penalty called).\nEach team retains the ball until it scores or fails to make a first down. Each team will receive one timeout for every overtime period. The team that scores the most points during regulation and overtime wins the game \u2014 if it's still tied after an overtime period, there will be another.\nChristina Buff is a Nashville-based freelance writer for who covers shopping with a splash of entertainment. If you\u2019re ever wondering what streaming service you need to watch something (and the cheapest way to sign up for it), she\u2019s your girl.\nChristina received a B.S. in Business Communication (concentration in writing) from Stevenson University and began her professional journey writing and editing press releases.

RetailMeNot may, in its sole discretion, extend or shorten the redemption period for a Rewards O\ufb00er. As between you and RetailMeNot, the determination as to what transactions are Qualifying Transactions shall be made by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Bonus Rewards. From time to time, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er a Bonus Reward to certain RetailMeNot members who complete a qualifying activity or who meet certain criteria, as de\ufb01ned in a Rewards O\ufb00er Card or Promotion Landing Page, in addition to or in combination with o\ufb00ers for Online Cash Back Rewards or In-Store Cash Back Rewards. For example, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er certain Bonus Rewards to new members who earn an Online Cash Back Reward for the \ufb01rst time or earn certain Online Cash Back Rewards for the \ufb01rst time. In order to earn a Bonus Reward, you must satisfy all criteria set forth for earning the Bonus Reward as well as the requirements of these Promotion Terms during the promotion period for the Bonus Reward. RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust the promotion period and/or the bonus amount for Bonus Reward, at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Bonus Rewards are a limited time o\ufb00er and all criteria must be satis\ufb01ed within the dates of the Promotion. Returns, Approvals, and No Ownership. For any Rewards O\ufb00er, if you return or exchange the items purchased, complete your purchase before or after the Promotion Period, initiate a purchase that results in a chargeback, or fail to satisfy a Minimum Purchase Amount, or any other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card, RetailMeNot reserves the right to invalidate or withdraw all or part of the Rewards O\ufb00er, or reclaim Reward earnings. The determination of whether or not a purchase quali\ufb01es for the Rewards O\ufb00er and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed is at the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. In the event of a dispute, you may be required to provide your order con\ufb01rmation as proof of purchase. Order confirmations must be provided within six (6) months from the purchase date to qualify for this review. The timing of when RetailMeNot will issue an Approved Reward will vary based on a number of factors. These factors may include the type of Promotion pursuant to which a Reward is o\ufb00ered and your account activity as a member of RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the order and timing in which to process its con\ufb01rmation of eligible purchases. Rewards may be limited where participation exceeds the Total Rewards O\ufb00ers available during Promotion or in other cases, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. RetailMeNot also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reevaluate Approved Rewards, at any time, without notice, including, but not limited to, whether purchases qualify for the Promotion and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed, and RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust or withdraw any Rewards O\ufb00ers or any Approved Rewards (or reclaim Reward earnings), at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Participating in a Rewards O\ufb00er does not give you ownership or any other legal claim to any Reward unless and until RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, determines that you have met all eligibility criteria and ful\ufb01lled all requirements for the Promotion and you have completed the Redemption Process. Rewards O\ufb00ers are provided solely by RetailMeNot and are not underwritten or funded by any other third party. You may not make any claims for Rewards O\ufb00ers against Merchants or any other third party. Notwithstanding that Rewards O\ufb00ers may include o\ufb00ers of cash, prior to redemption, Rewards O\ufb00ers and Approved Rewards have no monetary value and you may not obtain any money or any other thing of value for any Approved Reward or participation in any Rewards O\ufb00er unless and until you complete the Redemption Process and a payment has been issued by RetailMeNot for Approved Rewards. Wallet and Redeeming Rewards. Approved Rewards will be shown in the RetailMeNot Rewards Wallet. You have no vested rights in Approved Rewards unless and until you complete the Redemption Process. If your RetailMeNot account is terminated by RetailMeNot, as provided in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, or if you elect to close your RetailMeNot account, you will no longer be permitted to access the Rewards Wallet or redeem Approved Rewards shown therein. You may redeem Approved Rewards for cash using PayPal or Venmo. Redeeming for cash to Paypal or Venmo. In order to redeem Approved Rewards for cash via PayPal or Venmo, you must: (1) have or create a PayPal or Venmo Account that is linked to the phone number or email address, where applicable, that RetailMeNot has on \ufb01le for you; (2) navigate to the \u201cMy Rewards\u201d section of your account, click \u201cRedeem Rewards\u201d, and then click either \u201cPaypal\u201d or \u201cVenmo\u201d, as applicable; and (3) perform any actions speci\ufb01ed in the RetailMeNot app or website, as modi\ufb01ed from time to time in the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. For example, such actions may include, but are not limited to, authenticating your account by providing a US based cell phone number with SMS capabilities, re-entering a password, and clicking the appropriate link or button. Once you have completed the required steps to redeem Approved Rewards, RetailMeNot will issue a payment to the PayPal or Venmo Account, as applicable, that is linked to the email address, or phone number, as applicable, that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account. An email or text message, where applicable, will be sent to that email address or phone number, where applicable, con\ufb01rming that the payment has been issued. Generally, redemption of an Approved Reward will result in the issuing of payment within minutes, but in some cases may require a longer time period. RetailMeNot is not responsible for lost or stolen payments or for delivery of payments to the wrong PayPal or Venmo account. If an account has not been credited with a Qualifying Transaction in the previous 12 months, it may be deemed an Inactive Cash Back Account. Accounts which meet this criteria will be debited a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of the lesser of $2.00 or the current account balance. Maintenance fees will not draw the account balance below $0.00. Maintenance fees will be assessed until the account balance reaches $0.00 or the account becomes an active cash back user again. Forced Redemptions. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with any limitations or requirements speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot from time to time, including, but not limited to, requirements not to redeem Approved Rewards that exceed amounts speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to cause the redemption of Approved Rewards, in whole or in part, and issue payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, but RetailMeNot undertakes no obligation to do so under any circumstances. You hereby authorize RetailMeNot to perform any such redemptions and issue any such payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, automatically and without further action by you. Abuse and Cancellations. RetailMeNot reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a user\u2019s account, entire Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you, including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures, limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning of the Promotion, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Without limiting anything in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of any individual it \ufb01nds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion, or in behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, RetailMeNot reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. RetailMeNot shall not be liable to you for any suspension, modi\ufb01cation or termination of a Rewards O\ufb00er, Approved Rewards, or the Promotion program. Use of any automated means or more than one account is prohibited and will result in disquali\ufb01cation. In the event of any dispute as to the quali\ufb01cation of potential recipients of a Reward, the authorized account holder of the email address or phone number provided to RetailMeNot at the time the account was created will be deemed the quali\ufb01ed Reward recipient. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Each potential recipient of Rewards may be required to show proof of being an authorized account holder. If your account remains inactive for 24 months, RetailMeNot reserves the right to permanently close the Account at which time the cash back rewards will be considered expired and will no longer be eligible for redemption. Before closing the Account, RetailMeNot will attempt to alert you to the fact that your account may be shut down due to inactivity. Premium Services: Certain Services provided by Ziff Davis require registration and payment (such Services are referred to collectively as the \u201cPremium Services\u201d). You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis\u2019 third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below. If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. For CNET Cash Back and Rewards Services Acceptance of terms. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms and conditions, and that you agree to be legally bound by all of them. You also acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to review and agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, you may not participate in or use the Services. Eligibility. You represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under age eighteen (18), you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. Rewards. The Services enable you to access and earn rewards, subject to the guidelines herein (\u201cServices\u201d). CNET offers users opportunities to earn cash back on their purchases from Merchants activated by the creation of trackable links (\u201cLinks\u201d) for a Merchant as a way to incentivize the purchase and promotion of the Merchant\u2019s products. Links are configured to track and attribute transactions to you so that you may earn a reward if you or someone to whom you send a Link completes a qualifying transaction with a Merchant. The CNET cashback program is an incentive and promotional program. Some transactions may not earn rewards or may earn at a rate different from the rate indicated by the Service. You are not guaranteed to earn a reward from a transaction for several reasons, without notice to you, including, without limitation: Merchants may alter terms, conditions, or commission rates. Merchants may discontinue their programs. Merchants may exclude certain products from Reward eligibility. Merchants may have technical failures which result in transactions failing to be tracked or attributed to you. Links may fail to function properly. Links may be disabled by web browsers or ad blockers. Merchants may reject transactions due to suspected policy violations. Other: charge-backs, product returns, accounting error, Merchant non-payment, fraudulent transactions, our inability to contact you to validate transactions, your inappropriate distribution of Links, or your failure to comply with Merchant policies. If the Merchant pays less than the expected amount or does not pay a commission for the transaction, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to adjust or cancel the reward. Furthermore, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to withhold, cancel or adjust the amount of any reward, for any reason at any time. By using the Services, you accept this condition. CNET may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any person, including any affiliate, without your consent. Payout timing. We only provide a reward to you after a transaction is successfully tracked and completed, after we receive payment for that specific transaction from the Merchant, and after you accrue the Minimum Redemption Amount (as defined below). Merchants usually have holdback periods during which they hold a pending payment (for example, until the expiration of a return policy and/or until a service is consumed). Rewards remain in a pending state until we receive payment from the Merchant for the associated transaction. After we receive payment and you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, you may request to redeem your rewards. Payout Threshold. A minimum approved balance of $10.00 is required for redemption (the \u201cMinimum Redemption Amount\u201d). This amount may change from time to time, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. If your balance is below the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards will be stored in a record on your account and may be subject to a Dormant Account Fee (as defined below). Once you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards may be redeemed for third-party merchant gift cards. Use of a third-party merchant gift card at a selected merchant will be subject to such merchant\u2019s and/or the gift card issuer\u2019s own terms of service. Coupons. Some rewards may include coupons, discounts or promotions from Merchants (\u201cOffers\u201d). We do not guarantee that Merchants will honor Offers. Offer codes may be expired or invalid. Offers may not be eligible for your transaction, based upon exclusions, terms and conditions determined by Merchants. Offers are not redeemable for any value with CNET. Dormant accounts. If you have pending rewards and your account has no new activity (defined as the earning of a pending reward) for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, we reserve the right to assess a monthly Dormant Account Fee of up to $5.00 USD, until such time as your reward balance reaches $0.00, to recover the cost associated with maintenance of the account. Any Dormant Account Fee we apply may or may not be displayed in your user dashboard. If your account has no new activity for a period of twelve (12) months, we reserve the right to void any remaining balance of rewards in your account. Tax. You are solely responsible for independently assessing and complying with all relevant tax and legal requirements. We shall not provide you with tax or legal advice. Cookies. Some Merchants may place cookies (or other tracking beacons) on your device to recognize your device during a subsequent visit. If you, or those clicking on your shared Link, block or delete cookies, tracking and attribution may be inoperable, in which case no reward shall be earned. Third-Party Services. We do not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products, services or content of Merchants or other third parties. We are not an agent, broker or otherwise responsible for any Merchant\u2019s activities, policies, products or services.

In such jurisdictions, the liability of Ziff Davis, third party content providers and their respective agents shall be limited to the greatest extent permitted by applicable law. 10.

Legal ComplianceZiff Davis ensures its SMS programs comply with applicable laws and industry standards, including the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), the CAN-SPAM Act, and CTIA guidelines. 11. Member Disputes You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Members of the Services. Ziff Davis reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Members and to take action (e.g., account deletion or removal of content posted by a user) if Ziff Davis determines that there has been a violation of the Agreement or if such action is otherwise necessary or desirable, in its sole discretion. 12. International Use We make no claims that any Material, Services or any Content is appropriate or may be downloaded outside of the United States or outside the country where such Material, Services or any Content was produced. Access to the Material, Services or any Content may not be legal in certain countries or for certain persons. If you access any Material, Services or Content from outside of the United States, you do so at your own risk and are responsible for compliance with the laws of your jurisdiction. You agree to comply with: (i) all local rules regarding user conduct on the Internet and acceptable content; and (ii) all applicable laws regarding the downloading and/or transmission of technical data and other material from or to the United States and the country in which you are located. 13. No Submission of Unsolicited Ideas Ziff Davis does not accept unsolicited ideas of any kind, including ideas for: advertising; promotions; new products, technologies, processes, or materials; marketing plans; or product names. Please do not send us any such ideas or materials relating to such ideas. This is to avoid any potential misunderstanding or dispute should our products or marketing strategies seem similar to unsolicited ideas submitted to us. If, despite this request, you do send us any unsolicited ideas or materials, we make no assurances that such ideas or materials will be treated as confidential or proprietary. 14. Binding Arbitration In the unlikely event that you\u2019re not satisfied with customer service\u2019s solution, and you and Ziff Davis are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (1) Claims Subject to Arbitration: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ziff Davis and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a current member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. References to \u201cZiff Davis,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including Ziff Davis, Inc., Ziff Davis, LLC, Everyday Health, Inc., Everyday Health Media, LLC, and their affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. (2) Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Ziff Davis must be emailed to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). Any Notice must include (i) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute. After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). If you are unable to participate in the settlement conference by video, you may attend telephonically upon showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances warranting telephonic participation (e.g., inability to afford equipment or sufficient Wi-Fi due to indigent circumstances). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules). Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(2). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and Ziff Davis have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration. (3) Arbitration Procedure: The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a75.) The NAM Rules are available online at www.namadr.com or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. We and you agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Section 13(2) and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address and you and a Ziff Davis representative will be required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding only between you and Ziff Davis and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court. As in court, you and Ziff Davis agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriately represented parties and counsel. Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (b)). (4) Arbitration Fees: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees. (5) Confidentiality: Upon either party\u2019s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law. (6) Offer of Settlement: In any arbitration between you and Ziff Davis, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party\u2019s favor and is less than the defending party\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party\u2019s favor, the other party must pay the defending party\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing. (7) Requirement of Individualized Relief: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and Ziff Davis will be subject to this Section 13 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 13 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement. (8) Opt Out of Future Changes: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if Ziff Davis makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending Ziff Davis an email to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; (v) the relevant Site; and (vi) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether. (9) Mass Filing: If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 13(2), until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge. Stage Four: If your claim is not resolved at this time, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. You and Ziff Davis agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Ziff Davis acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.(10) Severability: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein. 15. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER You and Ziff Davis agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and Ziff Davis may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and Ziff Davis may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Ziff Davis may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Ziff Davis waive any right to a jury trial. 16. Limitation Period for Claims You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. 17. Miscellaneous We may be required by international, state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Ziff Davis each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, the Borough of Manhattan (the \u201cCourts\u201d) with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding (whether based on forum non conveniens or otherwise); additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances. Ziff Davis\u2019 failure to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by Ziff Davis, and such waiver shall not be construed as Ziff Davis\u2019 waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 18. New Jersey Residents If, and to the extent that New Jersey law applies, with respect to residents of New Jersey, the terms in Sections 6 (insofar as any claims may arise from, or relate to, consumer protection or fraud and/or misrepresentation, or result in attorney\u2019s fees), 9 and 14 do not limit any rights you may have as a consumer under New Jersey law and are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the state of your residence. Subject to the foregoing, Ziff Davis, third party content providers, and their respective agents reserve all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under New Jersey law. Nothing in this Section shall modify the binding arbitration clause and waiver for class action and jury trial in Section 13. 19. Australia Residents Nothing in these Terms (including in Sections 6, 9 and 15) limits, excludes or modifies any rights you may have under any law, including under the Australian Consumer Law (the \u201cACL\u201d) and consumer guarantees under the ACL, which may not be limited, excluded or modified by agreement (including where such exclusion, restriction or modification would be illegal or void under such law). 20. Privacy Policy The applicable privacy policy will be made available on the property from which you accessed these Terms. Such privacy policy is incorporated by reference into these Terms.
