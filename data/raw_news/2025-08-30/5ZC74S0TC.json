  "description": "Home Depot's Labor Day sale offers the perfect opportunity to save hundreds off everything from new furniture to DIY tools.",
  "content": "Labor Day weekend is officially here, along with some great deals. If you're hoping to score some savings, you're in luck. Major discounts have started to drop at retailers like Home Depot.\n\nYou can already grab some fantastic deals on appliances, power tools and outdoor essentials before the the rest of the crowd joins in. Keep checking back, and CNET's expert team will keep this space updated as long as the deals keep coming in.\n\nHey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money.\n\u2022 : Host your final dinner parties of the summer outdoors and seat up to nine people.\n\u2022 : This option is a great entryway into the world of smokey goodness.\n\u2022 : Last chance to throw those burgers and hot dogs on the grill until next summer.\n\u2022 : Elevate any space by adding this simple yet chic mirror.\n\u2022 : An ultra-powerful air purifier and fan combo that'll leave your guests green with envy.\n\u2022 : Relax on the built-in seat while running the nine whirlpool jets, then drain the tub in just over a minute when you want to get out.\n\u2022 : This smart stove and oven has special features such as rapid boiling, air frying, voice control and more.\n\u2022 : You won't even notice the machine is on with super quiet cleaning at just 44 decibels.\n\u2022 : These high-end machines have tons of fancy features like AI fabric sensors, smart learner and pairing and more.\n\u2022 : Get this nice looking all-black washer that can get through a full load in 28 minutes.\n\u2022 : Save space with this large-capacity two-in-one machine that can handle everything your family throws at it.\n\u2022 : A smart dishwasher that can detect leaks so you never have to worry about running it before you leave the house.\n\u2022 : Store your tools and any other items in the garage cabinet that comes with an adjustable height shelf.\n\u2022 : A set of 45 bits for use with impact or drill drivers.\n\u2022 : Who doesn't need a trusty measuring tape?

Since it's the end of the summer season as well, you'll find great deals on all things outdoor. This includes patio furniture, lawnmowers, grills and more. However, every category has tons of savings, not just outdoors.\n\nWhere are the best Labor Day sales?\n\nThere are Labor Day sales going on everywhere. Just about every retailer is participating in Labor Day sales. This includes favorite names ranging from Amazon to Walmart to Best Buy and more.\n\nLabor Day 2025 falls on Monday, Sept. 1, but not all sales begin and end on that date. Many sales are already starting to go live, especially mattresses. Other retailers are starting to drop prices as well, but we expect to see Labor Day sales officially kick off a few days before the holiday. We also expect sales to extend through the week after Labor Day. We'll be monitoring sales to help you nab the most savings this year.\n\nHow we choose the best Labor Day deals\n\nAt CNET, we've got a team of expert shoppers and deal-hunters whose experience spans years of helping buyers understand which major sales and deals are legitimately good and which are more routine. That includes Black Friday, Prime Day, Fourth of July and countless other shopping events. We've gotten very good at weeding out scams and superficial deals. We look for real discounts, quality reviews and remaining sale time when choosing a deal to show you.\n\u2022 Real discounts mean exactly that. We look at the price history for all items sold at Home Depot to make sure no manufacturers are inflating prices to make the discount seem more substantial than it is.\n\u2022 Quality reviews are important for any product, but especially for big purchase items like grills, furniture and appliances. If it breaks the first time you use it, the discount isn't really worthwhile.\n\u2022 Remaining sale time is a huge part of our vetting process. If a deal seems like it will only be around for a short while or will only be available for the remaining stock, we'll let you know upfront so you don't come back to the deal later only to be disappointed.",

But impulse purchases don't always have to be something you'll regret, especially if you're shopping for the perfect gift. Impulse buying can lead to rare finds that surprise and delight -- and leave your recipient wondering how they ever lived without that wonderful and unique thing.\nWe rounded up our favorite impulse buys that ended up being must-have products.

This handy tool lets you quickly remove the green leafy top and stem so you're not tossing away the good stuff. It's much easier to use than a paring knife, and it works like a charm every time.\nElectric wine opener\nThe Rabbit is so last year. CNET's Corinne Reichert prefers this handy electric wine bottle opener, which quickly and easily removes corks without all the fuss and having to strain your wrist. Keep it on the charging dock and it's always ready to open a bottle -- or two or three. It's 41% off for Black Friday.\nCar phone mount\nIf you depend on your phone for navigating, streaming music or just taking calls hands-free while driving, it's a good idea to invest in a car phone mount. iOttie's Easy One Touch 5 doesn't have all the bells and whistles of more expensive car phone mounts (like wireless charging or arms that open automatically). It made our list of the best car phone mounts for 2025, and it's 20% off right now.\nPeeps glasses cleaner\nIf you wear glasses, you know how quickly they get filthy and smeared. \"This Peeps cleaner works like a miracle,\" says CNET's Gael Cooper. \"You gently slide it over your lenses and voila, they're cleaner than ever. I've given them to everyone I know.\"\nA spatula for lefties\nLike a lot of kitchen tools, spatulas are designed with right-handed folks in mind, which can make something that's usually simple -- like flipping eggs -- a major hassle. If you, or someone you know, is left-handed, this spatula is a game changer in the kitchen.\nNail polish organizer\nKeep your nail polish collection easily accessible with this handy organizer case. It fits bottles from just about any nail polish brand, and you can store all your accessories, like emery boards, nail glue, acrylic dip powder and more.\nMicrofiber face towels\nWe've found these towels to be considerably better at removing makeup and grime from your face compared with a standard washcloth. And they're more cost-effective and environmentally friendly than using disposable face wipes. CNET's Faith Chihill says, \"I quit using face wipes and switched to using these with some micellar water and my skin is so thankful.\"\nPacking cubes\nIf you know someone who likes travel, these packing cubes are totally life-changing. Not only do they keep you organized and make things easier to find, but they also save you tons of space. Put your shirts in one, your underwear and socks in another, your chargers and gadgets in yet another, and you'll never have to go digging through your bag again to find that one item you needed.\nConair fabric shaver\nFor people who like to keep things looking their best, using a fabric shaver can be satisfying -- therapeutic even. Like most fabric shavers, this Conair model isn't perfect. You'll still have to empty the lint catcher, but the thrill you'll get when you transform the look of your fuzzy sweaters is worth it.\nLulu candles\nScented candles are a great gift for any occasion, and Lulu's scents are just as fresh and complex as brands that charge a premium. CNET's Jessica Dolcourt says, \"I've bought four of them for myself, and as gifts, to add some aroma and elegance to spaces throughout my home.\"\nTP-Link Kasa Wi-Fi mini smart plug\nYou can never have too many smart plugs on hand, whether you want to use them for automating lights, turning gadgets on and off with voice commands and so much more. This Kasa smart plug is a budget-friendly choice and makes a great gift, especially if you pair it with something like an Echo Dot or smart LED lights.\nCountertop water dispenser\nThis little battery-powered water dispenser lets you easily (and elegantly) serve up water, beer, cocktails and more wherever and whenever you'd like. It's USB rechargeable, so you can bring it with you to parties, camping or any outdoor gathering. CNET's James Bricknell says, \"I have mine on my bedside table with a 5-gallon water tank hidden behind my bed. It looks great and saves me from 'bathroom water.'\""

The majority of retailers have maintained discounted prices on several items across the board, with some of the biggest and most aggressive savings on appliances. Labor Day is one of the few remaining shopping events of the year for cleaning up with big markdowns on your home upgrades, and sales that continue on past the holiday are still a great time to save on appliances of all sizes.\nHow do I find the best remaining Labor Day deals?\nFortunately for you, you don't have to look very far. We routinely scour the internet to bring you the most up-to-date deals and discounts. Check out our Deals page for the latest and greatest deals or subscribe to our Newsletter so that you never miss a chance to save.\nHow we choose the best remaining Labor Day deals\nAt CNET, we've got a team of expert shoppers and deal-hunters whose experience spans years of helping buyers understand which major sales and deals are legitimately good and which are more routine. That includes Black Friday, Prime Day, Fourth of July and countless other shopping events. We've gotten very good at weeding out scams and superficial deals. We look for real discounts, quality reviews and remaining sale time when choosing a deal to show you.\n- Real discounts mean exactly that. We look at the price history for items sold at various retailers to make sure no manufacturers are inflating prices to make the discount seem more substantial than it is.\n- Quality reviews are important for any product, but especially for big purchase items like grills, furniture and appliances. If it breaks the first time you use it, the discount isn't really worthwhile.\n- Remaining sale time is a huge part of our vetting process. If a deal seems like it will only be around for a short while or will be available only for the remaining stock, we'll let you know upfront so you don't come back to the deal later only to be disappointed."

This tiny hydration backpack is perfect for cycling, running, hiking and much more, and has a separate pocket for your keys, wallet and other essentials.\nWhen do Prime Day deals end?\nMany Amazon Prime Day deals have already expired, but there are still lingering discounts to be had. This year, Prime Day ran from July 8 to July 11. Now that the event is over, deals are harder to come by and there's no telling how long the remaining deals will last.\nDo I have to be an Amazon Prime member to shop Prime Day?\nTo access most Prime Day deals, you'll need to be a Prime member. If you've always wanted the benefits of Prime but haven't made the jump, now's a great time to subscribe. Subscribing now could lead to significant savings since tariffs are expected to raise prices on a lot of goods. A recent CNET survey found that 64% of shoppers have bought or plan to buy tech products soon to avoid price increases or shortages. In fact, 16% of shoppers say they're using Prime Day to start their holiday shopping well ahead of the holiday season, according to a new RetailMeNot survey. (Disclosure: RetailMeNot is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\nRead more: How to Sign Up for a Prime Membership\nPrevious Amazon Prime Day dates\nSince Amazon launched its first Prime Day sale in 2015, the company has scheduled the event for around the same time of year. Outside of a couple of recent years, Amazon has traditionally kicked off its main sale event around the middle two weeks of July and 2025 is no exception.\nHere are the previous Amazon Prime Day dates:\n- Prime Day 2015: July 15\n- Prime Day 2016: July 12\n- Prime Day 2017: July 11 to 12\n- Prime Day 2018: July 16 to 17\n- Prime Day 2019: July 15 to 16\n- Prime Day 2020: Oct. 13 to 14\n- Prime Day 2021: June 21 to 22\n- Prime Day 2022: July 12 to 13\n- Prime Early Access Sale 2022: Oct. 11 to 12\n- Prime Day 2023: July 11 to 12\n- Prime Big Deal Days 2023: Oct. 10 to 11\n- Prime Day 2024: July 16 to 17\n- Prime Big Deal Days 2024: Oct. 8 to 9\n- Big Spring Sale 2025: March 20 to 25\n- Prime Day 2025: July 8 to 11\nWill tariffs affect this year's Prime Day deals?\nTariffs are top of mind for most Americans and it could affect this year's Prime Day event. Prices on items like electronics could very well increase, with companies like Apple trying to avoid tariffs by moving manufacturing operations elsewhere. The tariffs were paused earlier this month, but only until Wednesday, right after Prime Day began.\nWhat is Prime Day?\nAmazon began the annual Prime Day tradition in 2015. Ever since, bargain hunters have eagerly awaited its return every summer. The Prime Day sale event has historically taken place in July, and this year is no exception. Amazon often has other sales throughout the year, including a second Prime Day-like sale in October and the Big Spring Sale in March.\nThis year's Prime Day is here -- though not for much longer. We've covered all the essentials, including everything from signing up for Amazon Prime and returning Prime Day purchases to getting Prime Day deals free and using extra Prime perks.\nHow we choose deals\nCNET has a team of shopping experts and deal hunters who have operated across major sales events for many years, making sure you understand when a deal is worth taking advantage of or when it's worth skipping. Whether it's for Black Friday, Memorial Day, the Fourth of July or Prime Day, we have the expertise to make sure you get the best deal possible.\nTo do this, we look for real discounts, quality reviews and remaining sale time when choosing an offer to show you.\n- Real discounts mean real discounts. We look at the price history for that product to make sure no manufacturers are inflating prices to make the discount seem more substantial than it is.\n- Quality reviews are equally important for any product, but particularly for deeply discounted items. If it breaks the first time you use it, the discount isn't really worthwhile.\n- Remaining sale time is a huge part of our vetting process. If a deal seems like it will only be around for a short while or will only be available for the remaining stock, we'll let you know in advance, so you don't return later only to be disappointed.\nWe are also considering the rising costs associated with tariffs to help you find items worth buying now.\nRead more: Tariff Tracker: We're Watching Prices for 11 Products You Might Need to Buy\nHow to keep up with the best Prime Day sales\nThere are a lot of ways to ensure you're getting the latest scoop on Prime Day deals.

In fact, there's a 30% discount across the website, so you might want to take a look even if you're not in the market for a new mattress.\nBest Buy: Shop incredible Labor Day deals on laptops, headphones, televisions and more.\nWhich Labor Day sales are the best?\nThere are plenty of competing Labor Day sales and deciding which is best for you will depend on what you're hoping to buy.\nAmazon, Best Buy and Walmart are generally good starting points if tech and smart home purchases are on your mind. If home and garden products are what you need, start with stores like Home Depot, Lowe's and Overstock.\nDon't rule out more niche retailers, such as B&H Photo, Dell, GameStop and HP, though, if their Labor Day promotions suit your needs. You can also shop direct at your favorite brands for Labor Day deals.\nWhen do Labor Day sales start?\nLabor Day 2025 falls on Monday, Sept. 1, but not all sales begin and end on that date. Many sales are already starting to go live, especially mattresses. Other retailers are starting to drop prices as well, but we expect to see Labor Day sales officially kick off a few days before the holiday. We also expect sales to extend through the week after Labor Day. We'll be monitoring sales to help you nab the most savings.\nShould I wait for Black Friday sales?\nLabor Day sales offer some of the best savings at this time of year, sitting nicely between Memorial Day sales and Black Friday. If you need something now, particularly furniture or yard equipment, Labor Day is a great time to buy, with end-of-summer pricing applying to a lot of those products.\nBlack Friday is the biggest sale of the year, though, and if you can afford to wait the extra couple of months, you could potentially get more for your money. That being said, rumors abound of a second Prime Day sale or \"Prime Early Access Sale\" slated for October, which could kick off the holiday shopping season much earlier and may mean even less time between Labor Day and fall sales.\nHow do I make the most of Labor Day sales?\nBefore diving into Labor Day sales, narrow down exactly what is on your shopping list this year. That way, you can identify the best retailers to start your search and avoid being distracted by the thousands of deals that will bombard you as you explore the Labor Day sales.\nThe CNET Deals team will keep you up to date on the best deals this Labor Day and beyond, so be sure to follow the team on X and sign up for the CNET Deals newsletter."

If you've always wanted the benefits of Prime but haven't made the jump, now's a great time to subscribe.

A recent CNET survey found that 64% of shoppers have bought or plan to buy tech products soon to avoid price increases or shortages. In fact, 16% of shoppers say they're using Prime Day to start their holiday shopping well ahead of the holiday season, according to a new RetailMeNot survey. (Disclosure: RetailMeNot is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\nRead more: How to Sign Up for a Prime Membership\nPrevious Amazon Prime Day dates\nSince Amazon launched its first Prime Day sale in 2015, the company has scheduled the event for around the same time of year. Outside of a couple of recent years, Amazon has traditionally kicked off its main sale event around the middle two weeks of July and 2025 is no exception.\nHere are the previous Amazon Prime Day dates:\n- Prime Day 2015: July 15\n- Prime Day 2016: July 12\n- Prime Day 2017: July 11 to 12\n- Prime Day 2018: July 16 to 17\n- Prime Day 2019: July 15 to 16\n- Prime Day 2020: Oct. 13 to 14\n- Prime Day 2021: June 21 to 22\n- Prime Day 2022: July 12 to 13\n- Prime Early Access Sale 2022: Oct. 11 to 12\n- Prime Day 2023: July 11 to 12\n- Prime Big Deal Days 2023: Oct. 10 to 11\n- Prime Day 2024: July 16 to 17\n- Prime Big Deal Days 2024: Oct. 8 to 9\n- Big Spring Sale 2025: March 20 to 25\n- Prime Day 2025: July 8 to 11\nWill tariffs affect this year's Prime Day deals?\nTariffs are top of mind for most Americans and it could affect this year's Prime Day event. Prices on items like electronics could very well increase, with companies like Apple trying to avoid tariffs by moving manufacturing operations elsewhere. The tariffs were paused earlier this month, but only until Wednesday, right after Prime Day began.\nWhat is Prime Day?\nAmazon began the annual Prime Day tradition in 2015. Ever since, bargain hunters have eagerly awaited its return every summer. The Prime Day sale event has historically taken place in July, and this year is no exception. Amazon often has other sales throughout the year, including a second Prime Day-like sale in October and the Big Spring Sale in March.\nThis year's Prime Day is here -- though not for much longer. We've covered all the essentials, including everything from signing up for Amazon Prime and returning Prime Day purchases to getting Prime Day deals free and using extra Prime perks.\nHow we choose deals\nCNET has a team of shopping experts and deal hunters who have operated across major sales events for many years, making sure you understand when a deal is worth taking advantage of or when it's worth skipping. Whether it's for Black Friday, Memorial Day, the Fourth of July or Prime Day, we have the expertise to make sure you get the best deal possible.\nTo do this, we look for real discounts, quality reviews and remaining sale time when choosing an offer to show you.\n- Real discounts mean real discounts. We look at the price history for that product to make sure no manufacturers are inflating prices to make the discount seem more substantial than it is.\n- Quality reviews are equally important for any product, but particularly for deeply discounted items. If it breaks the first time you use it, the discount isn't really worthwhile.\n- Remaining sale time is a huge part of our vetting process. If a deal seems like it will only be around for a short while or will only be available for the remaining stock, we'll let you know in advance, so you don't return later only to be disappointed.\nWe are also considering the rising costs associated with tariffs to help you find items worth buying now.\nRead more: Tariff Tracker: We're Watching Prices for 11 Products You Might Need to Buy\nHow to keep up with the best Prime Day sales\nThere are a lot of ways to ensure you're getting the latest scoop on Prime Day deals.
