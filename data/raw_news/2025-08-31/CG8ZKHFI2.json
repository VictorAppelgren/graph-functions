  "title": "With the S&P 500 at Historically High Levels, This ETF Could Be the Best Way to Invest in the Index",
  "description": "The index has been on a roll, but will the party continue for much longer?",
  "content": "The index has been on a roll, but will the party continue for much longer?\n\nThe S&P 500 has long been the stock market's most followed and important index. Tracking 500 of the largest American companies on the market, it's often used to gauge the health of the U.S. economy and market. After the index declined by over 19% in 2022, it has experienced a bull run, with its levels increasing by over 68% since the start of 2023. That's the good news.\n\nThe \"we should keep an eye on that\" news is that now the S&P 500 is trading at historically high levels. Based on its Shiller price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio -- which measures stock prices against inflation-adjusted average earnings over the past 10 years -- the S&P 500 is trading at levels we haven't seen in quite some time. And unfortunately, anytime the index has reached these levels, sharp declines soon followed.\n\nFor investors interested in investing in the S&P 500, its extremely high valuation may be alarming. However, there is another way to invest in the index that could possibly hedge against a sudden pullback. And that's via an S&P 500 equal-weight ETF like the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP -0.10%).\n\nThe difference between the standard S&P 500 and equal-weight S&P 500\n\nThe standard S&P 500 is weighted by market cap, so larger companies account for more of the index than smaller companies. In the equal-weight S&P 500, each company accounts for roughly the same amount.\n\nHistorically, being weighted by market hasn't been an issue for the S&P 500, but as megacap tech stocks have exploded in valuation over the past couple of years, a handful of companies are now worth a large portion of the index. The Magnificent Seven stocks -- Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla -- now account for over a third of the index. In the equal-weight S&P 500, they only account for 2.18%.\n\nThe high concentration in a handful of tech stocks has worked out well for the S&P 500, given the artificial intelligence (AI)-fueled run they have been on; however, as the saying goes, \"the same thing that makes you laugh, makes you cry.\" Pullbacks in these stocks, or the tech sector as a whole, will significantly weigh down the index.\n\nHere is how the top 10 holdings of the standard S&P 500 compare between the two:\n\nGoing with the equal-weight ETF doesn't mean sacrificing returns\n\nOver the past decade, the S&P 500 has outperformed the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF, rising 233% compared to its 153%. However, since the ETF hit the market in April 2003, the roles have switched, and the ETF has outperformed.\n\nPast results don't guarantee future performance, but it's worth noting that the ETF tends to outperform the market during periods when the broader market is rallying, the early stages of market recoveries, or periods when smaller companies and more value-based stocks are outperforming megacap tech stocks.\n\nWith the S&P 500 being as seemingly overvalued as it is -- and what has happened historically when it has reached these levels -- this seems like a good time to hedge against the standard S&P 500 and its reliance on the Magnificent Seven stocks.",

      "text": "Broadly speaking, a bull market is a sustained period -- usually months or years -- when prices rise. The term is most commonly used in reference to the stock market, but other asset classes can have bull markets as well, such as real estate, commodities, or foreign currencies.\nWhat exactly is a bull market?\nWhat exactly is a bull market?\nUsually, a bull market marks a 20% rise in stock prices, which follows a previous 20% decline and is followed by another 20% decline. As you can see from the chart below, there was a bull market that began in 2003 and ended when the S&P 500 hit its peak in 2007.\nBut there's one important caveat: The dates of a bull market can only be known in retrospect.\nCharacteristics of a bull market\nCharacteristics of a bull market\nThere are several things that tend to accompany a bull market. For starters, they generally happen during periods when the economy is strong or strengthening. Bull markets are often accompanied by gross domestic product (GDP) growth and falling unemployment, and companies' profits will be on the rise.\nAdditionally, one of the best non-numerical indicators for a bull market is rising investor confidence. During these times, there is a strong overall demand for stocks, and the general \"tone\" of market commentary tends to be positive. And, because companies can get higher valuations for their equity, we tend to see high levels of initial public offering, or IPO, activity in bull markets.\nThe opposite of a bull market is a bear market, which is typically defined as stocks falling by 20% or more from a recent peak. Bear markets are often accompanied by recessions, falling investor confidence, and declines in corporate profits.\nLearn more: Bull vs. Bear Market\nHow to invest in a bull market\nHow to invest in a bull market\nRegardless of what the market is doing, you should maintain a long-term focus to cultivate long-term wealth. While it can be a smart idea to invest when stocks are cheap, it's unwise to try to time the market. Great long-term businesses can be found in any market.\nOne smart thing to do is learn the principle of dollar-cost averaging. This involves investing equal dollar amounts at specific time intervals, which can help you invest during a bull market while allowing your portfolio to benefit from corrections and crashes as well.\nHistoric bull markets\nHistoric bull markets\nAs an example, consider the 2009-2020 bull market, which was the longest in stock market history. After plunging as a result of the 2008 financial crisis, the S&P 500 bottomed out in March 2009 and then proceeded to climb until early 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic sent stocks crashing.\nRelated investing topics\nPrior to the latest one, there was a lengthy bull market that lasted from 2002 until the late-2007 bear market that coincided with the financial crisis. The bottom line is that bull markets tend to be several years in length and are always preceded by and ended by bear markets."

      "text": "You probably interact with artificial intelligence (AI) more often than you think. AI is powering the algorithm arranging your Netflix (NFLX -1.88%) menu, the software expediting your Amazon (AMZN -1.16%) package, and the brains behind many smartphone apps you use every day.\nIf you've used ChatGPT, the OpenAI chatbot that has wowed users by writing code and instantly answering complex questions, or a similar chatbot, then you've glimpsed into the next frontier in AI, known as generative AI. Big tech companies, including Alphabet (GOOG 0.56%) (GOOGL 0.6%) with Gemini and Meta Platforms' (META -1.69%) with Meta AI, have developed AI chatbots and other generative AI technologies, and usage has soared. Meta reported that Meta AI had 1 billion active users by early 2025.\nArtificial Intelligence\nIf you want portfolio exposure to AI companies but don't want to identify individual AI stocks, investing in an AI-focused exchange-traded fund (ETF) is a good option. AI ETFs provide exposure to a broad range of the best AI companies, so you don't need to research and choose individual stocks on your own.\nAI ETFs are ETFs that hold AI stocks or have some kind of an AI theme, such as the ones below.\nBest AI ETFs\nBest AI ETFs to buy in 2025\n| AI ETF | Assets Under Management | Expense Ratio |\n|---|---|---|\n| Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ) | $3.68 billion | 0.68% |\n| Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (NASDAQ:BOTZ) | $2.72 billion | 0.68% |\n| Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (NYSEMKT:ROBO) | $1.05 billion | 0.95% |\n| iShares Future AI and Tech ETF (NYSEMKT:ARTY) | $1.09 billion | 0.47% |\n| First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF (NASDAQ:ROBT) | $496.3 million | 0.65% |\n1. Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF\n1. Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF\nThe Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF (AIQ -0.99%) is the largest AI ETF and a good first choice for investors looking for an AI ETF.\nThe ETF started in 2018 and aims to invest in companies that can benefit from the development of AI technology, as well as companies that make hardware facilitating the use of AI. According to Global X, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to grow from $184 billion in 2024 to $826.7 billion in 2030.\nThe ETF has 89 stocks, and the biggest holdings will be familiar to most investors. As of mid-2025, the top five holdings accounted for roughly 16% of the fund:\n- Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -3.52%): The leading fabless chip company has moved further into AI with several acquisitions, and as it advances franchises like its Instinct GPUs, EPYC data center CPUs, and Ryzen AI CPUs for PCs.\n- Meta Platforms (META -1.69%): The social media giant has made AI a clear priority, developing large language models and AI chatbots, making acquisitions like its deal for data-labeling start-up Scale AI, and its partnerships with Ray-Ban and Oakley to make smart glasses.\n- Microsoft (MSFT -0.65%): Microsoft has long dominated the market for enterprise software, and it's become a leader in cloud computing as well with Azure. That puts it in a good position to be an AI provider, and its partnership with OpenAI has paid off with products like its Copilot AI assistant.\n- Samsung (SSNL.F 9.01%): The Korean tech giant is the world's No. 2 chipmaker and well-known for devices like smartphones. It's introduced AI features like live translate and chat assist to help users write messages.\n- Broadcom (AVGO -3.7%): A leading maker of networking chips is seeing AI demand for things like custom AI chips and high-performance networking components used to run AI systems.\nAs you can see from the chart below, this Global X ETF has outperformed over its history, likely with the help of stocks like Meta and Broadcom that have soared lately.\n2. Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF\n2. Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF\nEstablished in 2016, the Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ -1.53%) is similar to the Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF, but with a focus on robotics. It's a fund that invests in \"companies that potentially stand to benefit from increased adoption and utilization of robotics and artificial intelligence.\" This includes enterprises working in industrial robotics, automation, nonindustrial robots, and autonomous vehicles. According to Global X, the global robotics market was valued at more than $80 billion in 2022 and could grow to $280 billion by 2032.\nThe ETF held 49 stocks in mid-2025, and its top five holdings made about 41% of the fund:\n- Nvidia (NVDA -3.38%): This semiconductor maker's chips are used in a wide variety of applications -- including autonomous vehicles, virtual computing, and cryptocurrency mining -- and are central to many AI technologies.\n- ABB (ABBN.Y -1.29%): This Swiss company makes industrial automation and robotics products used in utilities and infrastructure.\n- Fanuc (FANUY -3.62%): This Japanese maker of factory automation products includes motors, lasers, and robots in its product lineup.\n- Keyence (KYCCF -5.09%): This Japanese company makes factory automation products, such as sensors and scanners.\n- Intuitive Surgical (ISRG -0.17%): This company makes the da Vinci robotic surgical system, which allows for minimally invasive surgeries with precise control.\nAs the chart below shows, shares of the ETF have underperformed the S&P 500 index since its 2016 launch. The share price fell sharply in 2022 in line with the broad sell-off in tech stocks, although it has rebounded since then.\nThe ETF offered a modest dividend yield of 0.24% in mid-2025, but it is better suited as a growth-oriented investment. It's an actively managed fund with an expense ratio of 0.68%, which is higher than what you'd pay for most index funds.\nExchange-Traded Fund (ETF)\n3. Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF\n3. Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF\nThe Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF (ROBO -1.27%) focuses on companies driving \"transformative innovations in robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence.\" This ETF invests in companies primarily focused on AI, cloud computing, and other technology companies.\nCloud Computing\nThe ETF holds 76 stocks, with no single holding accounting for more than 2.5% of the ETF's value. Its top five holdings comprise only about 10% of the fund's total value. In mid-2025, major holdings included Fanuc and four others:\n- Symbotic (SYM -3.85%): A tech company that makes software and robotics for warehouses, including end-to-end systems for automation.\n- Celestica (CLS -8.11%): The tech company provides services like design, manufacturing, and logistics, and its components are used for AI infrastructure.\n- Joby Aviation (JOBY -0.84%): A development-stage maker of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicles, used for short-distance transportation and defense applications.\n- Teradyne (TER 0.3%): A maker of automated test equipment and robotics systems for applications like testing semiconductors and related hardware.\n- Kardex Holding (KRDXF -2.77%): Specializes in intralogistics solutions like lifts, carousels, and other products for moving materials in a facility or an automated warehouse.\nSince its inception in 2013, Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF has underperformed the S&P 500, as the chart below shows. It trails the broad market index, with dividends factored into the return. The ETF pays a dividend yield of 0.5%, and its expense ratio is 0.95%.\n4. iShares Future AI and Tech ETF\n4. iShares Future AI and Tech ETF\nThe iShares Future AI and Tech ETF (ARTY -1.77%), formerly traded under the ticker IRBO, aims to track the results of an index of developed and emerging market companies that could benefit from long-term opportunities in robotics companies and AI. The ETF was formed in 2018 and has about $1.3 billion in assets under management.\nWith 48 stock holdings, it's now well diversified. Many of its top holdings also give investors exposure to fast-growing small-cap companies. The fund's top five investments as of mid-2025 accounted for about 25% of the ETF's assets and included Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom, plus:\n- Vertiv Holdings (VRT -4.88%): A maker of infrastructure technologies for data centers, communication networks, and industrial applications, its systems help manage power supply, cooling, and monitoring.\n- Super Micro Computer (SMCI -5.42%): Supermicro, as the company is also known, makes servers and is well-regarded as a leader in AI servers and for its close relationship with Nvidia.\nAs you can see from the chart below, the ETF has underperformed the S&P 500 since its founding. The ETF fell in 2022 when tech stocks crashed.\nThe expense ratio is competitive at 0.47%, and the trailing-12-month yield in August 2025 was 0.17%. The fund's performance will likely be heavily influenced by the overall performance of cloud and chip stocks since they're the largest areas of exposure for the fund.\n5. First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF\n5. First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF\nThe First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF (ROBT -0.58%) tracks the Nasdaq CTA Artificial Intelligence and Robotics index, which comprises companies engaged in AI and robotics in technology, industrials, and other sectors. The fund currently holds 101 stocks. Top holdings in mid-2025 were Symbotic and four others:\n- Upstart Holdings (UPST -0.56%): This lending platform uses AI to model creditworthiness to improve default and approval rates.\n- AeroVironment (AVAV -3.02%): This company manufactures unmanned aircraft systems and tactical missile systems, while also providing logistics, support, and engineering services.\n- Recursion Pharmaceuticals (RXRX -3.49%): This clinical-stage biotech company uses AI and machine learning for drug discovery with focus on rare diseases. Its Recursion OS platform is at the center of its technology.\n- Synopsys (SNPS -1.31%): This semiconductor services company works in electronic design automation, providing software to help engineers design and test chips.\nRelated investing topics\nShould I buy?\nShould I buy AI ETFs?\nThe best way to decide which ETF to buy is to consider which stocks a fund holds and how many are true AI companies. A fund's expense ratio, dividend yield, and past performance are also important, and you can opt to invest in a basket of all five of these AI ETFs to maximize your diversification.\nOver time, AI will grow smarter and play a greater role in our daily lives. Already, AI represents a global market worth hundreds of billions of dollars, and its wide range of practical applications includes face recognition, predictive algorithms in internet search, smart-home devices, and autonomous vehicles. So, pay attention to the AI market now, and you may find yourself reaping the rewards in years to come.\nFAQs\nInvesting in artificial intelligence ETFs: FAQs\nWhich ETF is best for AI?\nAI investors have several options in ETFs. The best-known of the AI ETFs above is Global X Artificial Intelligence and Technology ETF, which holds a number of well-known AI stocks, including Meta and Microsoft. AI investors may also want to consider an ETF that tracks the Nasdaq-100, such as the Invesco QQQ ETF (NASDAQ: QQQ), because big tech companies with exposure to AI make up almost half of the fund.\nDoes Vanguard have an AI ETF?\nVanguard does not currently offer an AI-focused ETF. However, the asset manager offers an information technology ETF that includes several AI stocks.\nWhat is the best AI to invest in?\nNvidia is currently the best-known AI stock and has also been one of the most successful stocks in AI. Past performance does not guarantee future returns, but it makes sense to invest in ETFs with exposure to Nvidia and other AI chip stocks as they emerge.\nDoes Charles Schwab have an AI ETF?\nCharles Schwab (NYSE: SCHW) does not have an AI ETF. However, the brokerage firm does have an AI \"theme\" that contains as many as 25 AI stocks that Schwab account holders can buy together, based on Schwab's proprietary algorithms and research.\nWhat ETF has the highest exposure to AI?\nThere's no simple answer to which ETF has the most exposure to AI, but of the five ETFs above, the iShares Future AI and Tech ETF (ARTY) has the most direct exposure to stocks that have gained in the AI era, thanks to its ownership of companies like Nvidia, Broadcom, and Vertiv."

      "text": "The price-to-earnings ratio, also known as the P/E ratio, is one of the most commonly used stock valuation metrics, and it is important for any investor to understand. In this article, we\u2019ll take a closer look at what the P/E ratio is, how to calculate it, and how to use it as part of your investment analysis.\nUnderstanding the P/E ratio\nUnderstanding the P/E ratio\nThe P/E ratio, or price-to-earnings ratio, is a metric that compares a company\u2019s net income to its stock price. It can be an excellent tool when analyzing stocks and can help investors get a sense of whether a stock is a good value or expensive.\nAs the name implies, the P/E ratio is calculated by taking the current share price of a stock and dividing by its earnings per share over a one-year period. For example, if a stock trades for $40 per share and earned $2 per share in the past year, its P/E ratio would be 20.\nYou may hear the P/E ratio also referred to as the P/E multiple or earnings multiple, and it\u2019s important to realize that these terms are often used interchangeably and mean the same thing.\nThere are several different ways to calculate the P/E ratio, with the two most common being the trailing P/E and the forward P/E. A stock\u2019s trailing P/E is calculated by using its past four quarters\u2019 earnings, while the forward P/E is calculated by using the consensus projections, or the company\u2019s own guidance, for the next 12 months of earnings.\nWhy is P/E ratio important?\nWhy is the P/E ratio important?\nThe P/E ratio is important because it is a valuation metric that is useful for comparing different investment opportunities to one another. It can be a useful tool when trying to identify undervalued stocks, and it can help you avoid overpaying for stocks as well.\nHow to use the P/E ratio\nHow to use the P/E ratio\nThe most effective way to use the P/E ratio is to compare the valuations of businesses in the same industry at similar stages of maturity. For example, you might use the P/E ratio as part of an analysis comparing Target (TGT -0.85%), Costco (COST -0.23%), and Walmart (WMT 0.88%).\nIt is also worth pointing out that the P/E ratio doesn\u2019t work on companies that aren\u2019t profitable. There are other valuation metrics that can be applied to early-stage growth companies, but the P/E ratio isn\u2019t one of them.\nNo valuation metric can tell you if a stock is an attractive investment opportunity all by itself, and the P/E ratio is no exception. For example, the stock of a faster-growing business should have a higher P/E ratio than a slower-growing one, all other factors being equal. So the P/E ratio is best used as one piece of the puzzle, in combination with earnings growth, cash and debt levels, gross and net profit margins, and other figures.\nFinally, if a stock has a P/E ratio that is much lower than its peers, it can be a red flag that is worthy of further investigation. Companies with P/E ratios that seem too good to be true often have declining sales, poor balance sheet quality, or another underlying reason for the seemingly cheap valuation.\nExample of using the P/E ratio\nExample of using the P/E ratio\nLet\u2019s take a look at a real-world example of calculating the P/E ratio. As of Feb. 6, 2023, Apple (AAPL -0.19%) traded for $154.50. Over the past four quarters, Apple earned $5.90 per share. So we can calculate its trailing P/E ratio as follows:\nSo Apple trades for 26.2 times its trailing-12-month earnings. If we wanted a more forward-looking metric, we can use Apple\u2019s projected earnings over the next 12 months, which are $6.23 per share. If we use this, our forward earnings calculation looks like:\nNow let\u2019s say that you\u2019re trying to decide between Apple and Microsoft (MSFT -0.65%). On the same date, Microsoft traded for $255.12. Its trailing-12-month earnings were $8.99 per share, so its trailing P/E ratio could be calculated as:\nApple\u2019s trailing P/E is 26.2, while Microsoft\u2019s is 28.4. Based on the P/E ratio alone, Apple appears to be the cheaper stock. However, as mentioned above, it\u2019s important to understand the P/E ratio is just one metric that should be used in stock analysis and doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.\nSo when conducting an analysis of two companies like this, the best practice is to use the P/E ratio along with other metrics for both companies to develop a thorough comparison of the two investment opportunities."

      "text": "Value investors want to buy stocks for less than they're worth. If you could buy $100 bills for $80, wouldn't you do so as often as possible?\nEven high-quality companies with strong fundamentals see share prices fall when the overall stock market drops. Plus, value stock companies tend to be well established and less volatile than growth stock companies.\nHere's an overview, including some excellent beginner-friendly value stocks and key concepts and metrics that value investors should know.\nTop value stocks\n4 best value stocks for beginners\nValue stocks are generally publicly traded companies trading at cheap valuations relative to their earnings and long-term growth potential. Let's look at four excellent value stocks: Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.66%) (BRK.B 0.63%), Target (TGT -0.85%), General Motors (GM 0.27%), and Signet Jewelers (SIG -2.01%). Then, we'll dive into some metrics that can help you find the best value stock investments.\n1. Berkshire Hathaway\nBerkshire Hathaway is a unique company on the stock market and has long been a top choice for value investors. That's largely because longtime CEO Warren Buffett is the world's most admired value investor, and his investing acumen is the biggest reason for the company's success.\nSince Buffett took over in 1964, Berkshire Hathaway has grown into a conglomerate with more than 60 wholly owned businesses and a massive stock portfolio with more than 30 different holdings. Berkshire has steadily increased its book value and earnings power over time.\nIt operates under the same business model that has led the stock to almost double the annualized return of the S&P 500 index for more than 55 years. That track record is unmatched and will probably never be beaten.\nAs part of their value investing strategy, Buffett and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, kept large cash reserves to deploy when they spotted an opportunity. Buffett's also been content to own companies outright that can generate profit and don't need to grow, using those profits to fund stock purchases and new acquisitions, a unique strategy in the stock market.\nWholly owned subsidiaries, such as See's Candies, Dairy Queen, and Brooks running shoes, are all good examples of cash-flowing stable businesses that don't need to grow to contribute to Berkshire's business model. Buffett's value investing approach also explains why he favors sectors like insurance, which provide a \"float\" in the form of premiums that he can reinvest.\nBuffett announced at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in May 2025 that he would step down by the end of the year. He will be passing the reins to Greg Abel, who is currently CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Energy.\nAs of the end of the second quarter, Berkshire had more than $340 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet, putting it in a good position to make an acquisition if it finds one attractive. Additionally, the company could pay a dividend. Abel is expected to run the business with a value-oriented mindset similar to Buffett's, though the Buffett imprint is likely to change over time.\nOne sign that even value stocks are getting expensive is that Berkshire was a net seller of stocks in 2024, signaling that Buffett may believe the market is overvalued. Stocking up on dry powder is another smart strategy of value investors like Buffett, and it will likely pay off if stocks pull back again as they did at the beginning of 2025.\n2. Target\nTarget is one of the largest retailers in the U.S. and one of only a handful of national multi-category retailers, along with Walmart (WMT 0.88%), Costco (COST -0.23%), and Amazon (AMZN -1.16%). The company has been a steady engine of growth throughout most of its history. It has a wide reach for a brick-and-mortar retailer -- operating in urban, suburban, and rural locations -- and stores in all 50 states.\nHowever, Target has struggled in recent years due to weak consumer discretionary spending, inventory fluctuations, and internal issues such as theft. It's also faced customer backlash due to changes in its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, which may have contributed to a weak first quarter in 2025. As a result, the stock traded at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 11.3 as of July 2025.\nThat's a great price to pay for a retailer with differentiated positioning and one that's still opening new stores. Target is also a Dividend King with a dividend yield of 4.5%, offering a reward to income investors.\nTarget still has a long-term growth opportunity in retail, both through new stores and e-commerce. This includes its range of same-day fulfillment options, such as curbside pickup, known as Drive Up, and same-day delivery through Shipt.\nTarget's stock has fallen for a number of reasons, but its challenges are fixable. The company expects to grow sales by a total of 15% over the next five years, and at its current valuation, the stock looks like an easy winner if it can accomplish that goal. While its recent results have been disappointing, Target is the kind of value stock that offers value because of its turnaround potential.\n3. General Motors\nValuation is arguably the most important test of a value stock, as a value investor is ultimately looking to buy a stock worth more than its price. As Buffett has said, \"Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.\"\nBy that yardstick, General Motors (GM) may be one of the best value stocks around. GM has been a leading player in the auto industry for a century and remains one of the world's largest automakers.\nBased on its adjusted earnings per share (EPS), GM currently trades at a P/E ratio of 8. This is a reflection of investors' low growth expectations and uncertainty around tariffs and trade, which are expected to weigh on results this year. However, GM has continued to deliver solid results.\nThe company should benefit from slowing growth in electric vehicles (EVs), though it has a number of them on the market, as it will support sales of its combustion vehicles. GM also announced in late 2024 that it would end its Cruise autonomous vehicle business, which had cost it an estimated $10 billion over its history. Investors responded positively to the move because it will help GM's cash flow.\nConcerns about tariffs have also pushed the stock lower, but it's unclear how the import taxes will affect the business since higher car prices could be good for GM, or at least for its American-made inventory. A recent hike in steel tariffs to 50%, however, is expected to be a hardship for GM and its peers.\nAs a value stock, GM is also able to aggressively repurchase stock to lift its EPS. It has reduced shares outstanding by almost one-third over the last 18 months. That's one way value stocks can grow profits even without growing revenue.\n4. Signet Jewelers\nSignet Jewelers is the world's largest diamond jewelry retailer. With a market cap of just $3 billion, it's much smaller than any of the other stocks on this list, but value stocks come in all sizes.\nSignet operates in a mature industry, and the stock has historically traded at a discount because investors regard it as a low- or no-growth company. There also seems to be some concerns about disruption from lab-grown diamonds, though Signet is benefiting from that segment as well.\nThe company has made some smart moves, including reducing its real estate footprint, investing in higher-margin service businesses, like repair and warranties, and focusing on its largest brands, including Kay, Jared, and Zales.\nBased on adjusted EPS, Signet trades at a P/E ratio of just 8, and the company has taken advantage of that discount to buy back stock. In the first quarter of 2025, it repurchased 5% of shares outstanding after the stock fell sharply, and its shares outstanding have fallen by roughly half over the last decade.\nWhat are they?\nWhat are value stocks?\nMost stocks are classified as either value stocks or growth stocks. Generally, a value stock trades for a lower price than its financial performance and fundamentals suggest it's worth. A growth stock is a company expected to deliver above-average growth compared to its industry peers or the overall stock market.\nGrowth Stock\nSome stocks have both attributes or fit in with average valuations or growth rates, so whether they are value stocks depends on the number of pertinent characteristics they possess. Value stocks generally have the following characteristics:\n- They are typically mature businesses.\n- They have steady (but not spectacular) growth rates.\n- They report relatively stable revenues and earnings.\n- Most pay dividends, although this isn't a set-in-stone rule.\nSome stocks easily fit into one category or the other. For example, package delivery giant FedEx (FDX -0.14%) is clearly a value stock that's fallen out of favor with Wall Street due to some short-term challenges. Conversely, fast-moving Tesla (TSLA -3.45%) is an obvious example of a growth stock.\nOn the other hand, some stocks can fit into either category. For example, there's a case to be made either way for tech giants Apple (AAPL -0.19%) and Microsoft (MSFT -0.65%), though their valuations may be a little too stretched currently to be seen as value plays.\nRegardless of a stock's category, economic downturns present an opportunity for a value investor. The goal of value investing is to scoop up shares at a discount, and the best time to do so is when the entire stock market is on sale; for instance, during a recession.\nFinding them\nHow to find value stocks\nThe point of value investing is to find companies trading at a discount to their intrinsic value, with the idea that they'll likely outperform the overall stock market over time. However, finding undervalued stocks is easier said than done. That said, here are three of the best metrics to keep in your toolkit as you search for a bargain:\n- P/E ratio: This is the best-known stock valuation metric -- and for good reason. The P/E ratio can be a very useful tool for comparing the valuations of companies in the same industry. To calculate it, simply divide a company's price per share by its past 12 months of earnings per share.\n- Price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio: This is similar to the P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio adjusts to level the playing field between companies that might be growing at slightly different rates. By dividing a company's P/E ratio by its annualized earnings growth rate, you get a more apples-to-apples comparison between different businesses.\n- Price-to-book value (P/B) ratio: Think of the book value as what would theoretically be left over if a company stopped operations and sold all its assets. Calculating a company's share price as a multiple of its book value can help identify undervalued opportunities, and many value investors specifically look for opportunities to buy stocks trading for less than their book value.\nWhy invest in them?\nWhy invest in value stocks?\nThere are a number of reasons why investing in value stocks can be a good strategy.\n- Value investing tends to be more methodical than growth investing. It's typically easier to identify a stock that is a good value than to predict a business's long-term growth rate.\n- Value stocks typically have less downside than growth stocks. Since their valuations are already low, they have less room to fall than growth stocks.\n- Value stocks often pay dividends. Their yields can be high, as dividend yields are inversely correlated with valuations.\n- Value investing can pay off when the market is expensive. When the market gets frothy, value stocks tend to be better long-term bets.\nValue investors\nValue investors\nLong-term investors can generally be classified into one of three groups:\n- Value investors try to find stocks trading for less than their intrinsic value by applying fundamental analysis.\n- Growth investors try to find stocks with the best long-term growth potential relative to their current valuations.\n- Some investors take a blended approach and do a little of each.\nBuffett is perhaps the best-known value investor of all time. From the time he took control of Berkshire Hathaway in 1964 to the end of 2024, the S&P 500 generated a total return of 31,223%. Berkshire's total return during the same period has been a staggering 5,502,284% (that's not a typo).\nAlthough he isn't as well-known as Buffett, Benjamin Graham is often referred to as the father of modern value investing. His books, The Intelligent Investor and Securities Analysis, are must-reads for serious value investors. Graham was also Buffett's mentor.\nRelated investing topics\nTheir power\nDon't underestimate the power of value stocks\nWhile they may not be quite as thrilling as their growth stock counterparts, it's important to realize that value stocks can have just as much long-term potential, if not more. After all, a $1,000 investment in Berkshire Hathaway at the beginning of 1965 would be worth more than $28 million today. Finding companies that trade for less than they are truly worth is a time-tested investment style that can pay off tremendously.\nFAQ\nInvesting in value stocks FAQ\nWhat is a value stock?\nA value stock is one that trades for a lower price than its financial performance and fundamentals suggest it's worth.\nWhat are value stocks versus growth stocks?\nValue investing and growth investing are two different investing styles. Value stocks usually present an opportunity to buy shares below their actual value, while growth stocks exhibit above-average revenue and earnings growth potential.\nWall Street likes to neatly categorize stocks as either growth or value stocks. The truth is a bit more complicated since some stocks have elements of both value and growth. Nevertheless, there are important differences between growth and value stocks, and many investors prefer one investing style over the other.\nWhat are value stock ETFs?\nAn exchange-traded fund (ETF) that invests in value stocks uses specific criteria to find companies whose intrinsic values substantially exceed the market values implied by their stock prices. By investing in a wide range of undervalued companies, value stock ETFs confer instant portfolio diversification. Buying shares in a value stock ETF can be a safe and easy way to invest in companies in cyclical industries.\nHow do I start value investing?\nValue investing requires a great deal of research. You'll have to do your homework by going through many out-of-favor stocks to measure a company's intrinsic value and comparing it to its current stock price. You'll often have to look at dozens of companies before finding a single one that's a true value stock.\nWhat are the risks of investing in value stocks?\nThe biggest risk of investing in value stocks is the potential to invest in a value trap. This is a stock that looks cheap, but it's cheap because the company is declining. Typically, owning shares of a declining company is a recipe for losing money in the stock market.\nWhat are some strategies for investing in value stocks?\nTo find value stocks worth buying, it's a good idea to start with some stock screens to find stocks trading at low P/E ratios or low valuations, according to other metrics. However, that alone isn't sufficient.\nIt's a good idea to do a discounted cash flow valuation to see whether the stock is trading for less than the present value of its future cash flows. While it's impossible to predict future cash flows perfectly, the exercise should help give you a sense of whether the stock offers value.\nWhat is a good P/E ratio for a stock?\nA good P/E ratio for a stock depends on multiple factors. It's more than just looking at a number.\nTo understand whether a stock has a good P/E ratio, it's a good idea to compare it to its peers and the S&P 500. If it's growing faster than its peers and trades at a lower or even equal P/E ratio, for example, that's a sign that the stock is a good value.\nA P/E ratio under 10 would generally be considered cheap, but that's different from offering value since the number alone doesn't tell you enough about the company without looking at its financial performance."

      "text": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" describes the seven biggest technology-focused companies that have led the market's returns in recent years. Bank of America (BAC 0.51%) analyst Michael Hartnett coined the phrase based on the Western film with the same name (originally made in 1960 and remade in 2016).\nThis update on the term FAANG stocks encompasses more of the top companies capitalizing on technology megatrends. Here's a look at the Magnificent Seven stocks and whether they are good investments right now.\nWhat are they?\nWhat are the Magnificent Seven stocks?\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks are seven of the largest technology-focused companies by market cap.\n| Company name | Company ticker | Market cap | Sector |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Apple | NASDAQ:AAPL | $3.4 trillion | Information Technology |\n| Alphabet | NASDAQ:GOOG | $2.6 trillion | Communication Services |\n| Amazon | NASDAQ:AMZN | $2.4 trillion | Consumer Discretionary |\n| Meta Platforms | NASDAQ:META | $1.9 trillion | Communication Services |\n| Nvidia | NASDAQ:NVDA | $4.2 trillion | Information Technology |\n| Microsoft | NASDAQ:MSFT | $3.8 trillion | Information Technology |\n| Tesla | NASDAQ:TSLA | $1.1 trillion | Consumer Discretionary |\nAll seven companies are focused on capitalizing on large technology-driven growth trends. But technically speaking, five are tech stocks, and two are tech-focused consumer discretionary stocks.\nThey're leaders in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, video games, social media, digital advertising, software, hardware, e-commerce, and electric vehicles (EVs). These technology trends are driving outsize growth for companies focused on them.\nShould I invest?\nShould I invest in the Magnificent Seven?\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks have delivered magnificent returns. As a group, these seven stocks delivered a 58% two-year return in 2023 and 2024. They contributed more than half the return delivered by the S&P 500.\nWhile Magnificent Seven stocks have slumped in early 2025 due to Deepseek and tariff-driven market uncertainty (down about 14% as a group as of mid-2025), they've still delivered market-crushing returns over the past decade:\nMany investors believe this group of mega-cap stocks can continue producing dominant returns. They're capitalizing on several technology megatrends that should enable them to continue growing at outsize rates. For example, many businesses are still in the early stages of digital transformation (bringing their business processes into the cloud).\nThis trend could drive growing demand for cloud services for years, benefitting cloud titans Microsoft (MSFT -0.65%), Alphabet (GOOG 0.56%)(GOOGL 0.6%), and Amazon (AMZN -1.16%). Meanwhile, consumers continue to embrace technology, driving demand for tech-driven consumer products and services, like Apple's (AAPL -0.19%) iPhones, Microsoft's Xbox, Amazon's e-commerce store, and Tesla's (TSLA -3.45%) EVs.\nThose consumer trends are also shifting more ad dollars online, benefitting Meta (META -1.69%), Microsoft, and Alphabet. Finally, AI is still in the very early stages of what could be an extraordinary growth cycle, providing a boost to Nvidia (NVDA -3.38%), Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta.\nGiven the Magnificent Seven's still-untapped growth potential, investors should consider adding one or more of them to their portfolios. An alternative way to invest in stocks like the Magnificent Seven is to buy an exchange-traded fund (ETF) with meaningful exposure to those tech titans.\nFor example, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS -1.39%) focuses solely on investing in the Magnificent Seven. Alternatively, the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ -1.23%) focuses on the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100. The Magnificent Seven were all among its top 10 holdings in mid-2025 and totaled almost 40% of its total assets.\nAsset\nRisks\nRisks of investing in the Magnificent Seven\nAlthough the Magnificent Seven are among the world's largest and financially strongest companies, they're not without risk. One of the biggest risks of investing in these stocks is their high valuations.\nAfter their market-smashing returns in recent years, the group traded at a premium price. In mid-2025, the Magnificent Seven traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 18 times (Alphabet) to more than 150 times (Tesla), with most trading at more than 30 times earnings. That was higher than the S&P 500's P/E ratio (22.5 times) and a bit more than the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 (more than 29 times).\nThat's a hefty premium to pay for companies as large as the Magnificent Seven. It could be hard for those already large companies to grow into their valuations in the future, potentially causing their stock prices to underperform.\nAnother risk is that tech spending tends to be cyclical. If there's a recession and economic growth slows, it could significantly affect the growth of the Magnificent Seven. Given their premium price tags, a recession-driven slowdown could cause a steep decline in their stock prices. We saw this in early 2025 when the group tumbled on concerns that tariffs could cause a recession.\nA longer-term risk is that they might struggle to grow at above-average rates because of the law of large numbers. Given their mammoth sizes, it will likely be challenging for the Magnificent Seven to deliver sustained above-average growth in the years ahead unless a new tech trend emerges that accelerates their growth (like AI). If growth slows, it could take some of the premium out of their share prices. Even a whiff of slower growth can weigh on the sector, which was the case when Deepseek unveiled its low-cost AI model, causing concerns that it could affect the growth of other AI-focused tech companies.\nGiven their large sizes, Magnificent Seven companies could also face growth challenges due to potential antitrust concerns. Governments might reject future acquisitions they attempt -- much like Microsoft's long road to acquire Activision and Nvidia's blocked deal for Arm Holdings (ARM -2.97%).\nIf regulators block future deals, it could slow the companies' growth. Meanwhile, due to antitrust concerns, the federal government could eventually force some of the Magnificent Seven to break up.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line on the Magnificent Seven\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks have delivered magnificent returns over the years. These tech-focused companies have capitalized on many of the biggest technological growth trends, enabling them to grow rapidly and produce strong returns for their investors.\nWhile they're in excellent positions to continue growing rapidly in the future, they're not without risk. Investors must understand the risks before loading their portfolios with these seven stocks.\nFAQ\nMagnificent Seven FAQ\nWhat are the Magnificent Seven stocks?\nMagnificent Seven stocks are seven mega-cap, tech-focused companies: Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.\nIs there an ETF for the Magnificent Seven?\nThere is an ETF for the Magnificent Seven stocks. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF focuses solely on the Magnificent Seven stocks. It held all seven with a roughly equal weighting. The fund had an ETF expense ratio of 0.29%."

      "text": "Equal-weight funds have underperformed in recent years, but there are some good reasons to consider them today. Let's dive into what equal weighting means and the effects this strategy can have on a fund's performance.\nUnderstanding equal-weight index funds\nOverview\nEqual-weight index funds hold their assets in identical proportions. This differs from weighting by market capitalization, which gives bigger companies more influence over the portfolio via higher exposure percentages.\nTypically, the benchmark index of an equal-weight index fund is a secondary version of a cap-weighted index. An equal-weight S&P 500 fund, for example, tracks the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index. There are also equal-weight versions of the Russell 1000 and the MSCI USA.\nAn equal-weight S&P 500 portfolio holds the same percentages of all S&P 500 constituents. In other words, the fund's position in Microsoft (MSFT -0.65%) or Apple (AAPL -0.19%) has roughly the same value as its position in, say, Ulta Beauty (ULTA -7.11%) or Monster Beverage (MNST 0.6%).\nCapitalization-Weighted Index Funds\nImplications of equal weighting\nImplications\nEqual weighting does have strategy and performance implications:\n- More trading is required to keep a fund's positions weighted equally. This translates to higher expense ratios.\n- In an equal-weight fund, smaller companies have the same influence on returns as larger companies. This can result in higher volatility. Returns vs. cap-weighting will be higher when smaller companies outperform. If large companies are growing quickly, the cap-weighted portfolios will do better.\n- The fund will trim the share count of growing stocks and increase the share count of shrinking stocks. This aligns with the value-minded approach of buying when prices are low and selling when prices are high.\n- Equal exposures across positions reduce the risk of concentration in overvalued stocks.\n- Equal weighting relative to cap weighting changes sector exposure. In the era of dominant mega-cap tech stocks, for example, an equal-weight large-cap fund will have a smaller concentration in technology.\nThree popular equal-weight funds\nThree popular funds\nThe table below includes three equal-weight funds and their net assets, number of holdings, expense ratios, and 10-year average annual returns.\n| Fund metrics and data | Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (NYSEMKT:RSP) | Invesco Russell 1000 Equal Weight ETF (NYSEMKT:EQAL) | Direxion Nasdaq-100 Equal Weighted ETF (NYSEMKT:QQQE) |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Net assets | $54.6 billion | $589 million | $1.2 billion |\n| Number of holdings | 505 | 991 | 100 |\n| Expense ratio | 0.20% | 0.20% | 0.35% |\n| 10-year average annual return | 10.40% | 8.49% | 13.23% |\nOne quick takeaway from the data is the higher expense ratios relative to standard index funds. While there are many index funds with expense ratios less than 0.10%, that is a rarity for equal-weight funds.\nComparative performance\nComparative performance of weighting\nComparing the growth of an equal-weight index to its cap-weighted counterpart demonstrates more clearly how each strategy affects performance.\nThe table below shows average annual returns in the last 10 years for the Russell 1000 Equal Weight Index and the Russell 1000. Both indexes include the 1,000 largest companies by market capitalization.\n| Time frame | Russell 1000 Equal Weight Index | Russell 1000 Index (Cap-Weighted) |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1-year return | 18.23% | 28.01% |\n| 3-year return | 1.82% | 8.46% |\n| 5-year return | 10.42% | 15.42% |\n| 10-year return | 8.49% | 12.40% |\nAs you can see, equal-weighting has lagged cap-weighting throughout the last decade. In the last three years, the gap between the two strategies has widened. This isn't surprising, given the outsized gains from mega-cap tech stocks since 2021. Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia (NVDA -3.38%) have eclipsed $3 trillion in market cap and are continuing to climb in the artificial intelligence (AI) investing race.\nThe question is whether they can continue growing faster than small and mid-caps. Historically speaking, big companies haven't always been the drivers of market growth.\nRelated investing topics\nAccording to SSGA, the S&P 500 Equal-Weight index outperformed cap-weighted returns in 10 of the 20 years between 2003 and 2023. However, cumulative returns for the 20-year period are about the same across the two indexes.\nWhether you choose an equal or cap-weighting strategy depends on which risks you'd rather avoid. If over-concentration in the largest companies and most dominant sectors is a concern, equal weighting may suit you. Know that with that choice, you also accept a greater reliance on smaller companies, potentially higher volatility, and contrarian trading activity."

  "argos_summary": "The S&P 500 has surged 68% since early 2023, reaching historically high levels that historically precede sharp declines, largely driven by the Magnificent Seven tech giants. Its high Shiller P/E suggests overvaluation, prompting investors to consider the Invesco S&P 500 Equal\u2011Weight ETF (RSP) as a hedge, which reduces concentration in mega\u2011caps and offers a more balanced exposure. RSP has outperformed the cap\u2011weighted index during recent market recoveries and when smaller\u2011cap stocks outperform, but it lags during strong mega\u2011cap rallies and carries higher expense ratios. The article highlights RSP\u2019s trade\u2011off between reduced concentration risk and potentially lower returns in a tech\u2011heavy market, suggesting it as a strategic option for investors wary of a S&P 500 pullback.",
