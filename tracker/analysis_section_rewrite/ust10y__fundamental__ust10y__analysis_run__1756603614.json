      "feedback": "Your draft is a good first pass but it fails the mandatory handle‑mapping rule and could be tightened for clarity. 1) **Add a canonical handle** – explicitly link mortgage rates to the UST 10‑year yield (ust10y) as the benchmark that drives the term‑premium and liquidity premia, and optionally to cdx ig for the credit‑risk component. 2) **Insert the current 30‑year rate** (6.548 % from LF0UUL917) and the 10–20 bp sensitivity to Fed moves to give concrete numbers. 3) **Trim verbosity** – each sentence should convey one idea; remove redundant phrases (“the Fed’s policy stance, inflation expectations, national debt, and loan demand are the main drivers…”) and keep the causal chain tight. 4) **Specify a catalyst window** – e.g., Fed meeting Sept 16‑17 2025, CPI release Oct 2025, Treasury issuance Q4 2025 – and cite (LF0UUL917) for each claim. 5) **Keep citations** – every substantive claim must reference (LF0UUL917). 6) **End with a concise base case, risk list, watch list, and confidence rating**.  Implementing these edits will satisfy the acceptance gate, improve precision, and align the piece with the “multi‑year structural” focus.",
