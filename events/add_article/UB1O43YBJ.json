      "summary": "Global bond markets are experiencing a deep selloff, with long‑dated yields climbing to levels not seen since the late 1990s and early 2000s. Japan’s 20‑year notes hit a 1999 high, Australian 10‑year yields rose to July levels, and U.S. 30‑year yields approached the 5% threshold. The rally reflects growing worries over fiscal deficits, debt sustainability, and potential inflation, prompting investors to seek steepener strategies to profit from widening long‑short spreads.",
