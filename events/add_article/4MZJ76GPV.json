      "summary": "Nvidia’s Q2 2026 data‑center revenue of $21.9 billion is heavily concentrated, with roughly 53% coming from three unnamed clients—likely Elon Musk’s xAI, an OpenAI/Oracle partnership, and Meta—raising concerns about a structural vulnerability. The company’s dominance in AI GPUs is under pressure from geopolitical risks, including U.S. export restrictions on its H20 chips and China’s recent clamp‑down on purchases, which could erode a significant portion of its cash flow. This concentration risk, coupled with potential shifts to in‑house or competitor chips, could trigger a sudden revenue shortfall for Nvidia if any of the key clients pivot or face operational disruptions.",
