  "content": "NASHVILLE, Tenn., Sept. 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- SEGG Media Corporation (NASDAQ: SEGG, LTRYW) (\u201cSEGG Media\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), a sports, entertainment and gaming conglomerate that owns Sports.com, Concerts.com, and Lottery.com closed out the 2025 NTT INDYCAR and INDY NXT by Firestone seasons this weekend at Nashville Superspeedway. With senior leadership in attendance, SEGG Media strengthened relationships with its three drivers, while beginning exploratory discussions with teams and partners ahead of the launch of the 2026 SEGG Elite Driver Program.\n\n\n\nSEGG Media executives at Nashville included:\n\u2022 Matthew McGahan, Chairman and CEO, SEGG Media\n\u2022 Marc Bircham, Main Board Director and Head of Sports.com Acquisitions\n\u2022 Warren Macal, Main Board Director\n\u2022 Gregory Potts, COO of SEGG Media\n\u2022 Patrick Ogle, Director of Concerts.com \u201cHaving the C-suite and directors on the ground in Nashville sends a clear signal of SEGG\u2019s intent in motorsports,\u201d said Matthew McGahan, Chairman, President & CEO of SEGG Media. \u201cThis weekend was about more than the finale \u2014 it was about building long-term partnerships, securing global brand exposure, and advancing the Elite Driver Program as we look ahead to 2026.\u201d Rahal Letterman Lanigan\u2019s Louis Foster capped his rookie season by winning the prestigious 2025 NTT INDYCAR Rookie of the Year title. Starting 24th on the grid, Foster was involved in mid-race contact and received a blocking penalty, which forced him to manage damage and run laps down. Despite the setbacks, Foster secured the points needed to clinch the honor. Foster\u2019s No. 45 car ran in a striking black and gold livery, with the Sports.com logo prominently displayed on the end plates of the front wing. The branding stood out on national FOX television coverage, showcasing SEGG\u2019s global presence. \u201cOne of the main goals we had this year was to win this title,\u201d said Foster. \u201cThe RLL team have been incredible all year and I owe this to them and everyone supporting me on the path to the INDYCAR series. I\u2019ve learned a huge amount, and I\u2019m excited to reset for 2026 with more experience and determination.\u201d PREMA Racing\u2019s Callum Ilott overcame a grid penalty carried into Nashville to secure P9, his fourth top-10 finish of the season. Calm and precise throughout the 225-lap race, Ilott once again showcased his trademark race craft \u2014 widely regarded as among the best on the grid. \u201cIt was a good race,\u201d Ilott said. \u201cWe stabilised mid-pack and made a strong push on the Alternates late. The crew did a great job in the pits and Chevrolet delivered on the engine. It\u2019s a positive way to finish our first season together.\u201d\n\nAndretti Cape Indy NXT rookie Seb Murray wrapped up his debut season with a P11 finish at Nashville, ending the year 13th in the championship standings. Murray ran a refreshed livery that integrated SEGG Media\u2019s brands: Lottery.com across the sidepods, Sports.com on the rear wing, and additional Lottery.com placements along the midsection of the car. \u201cOverall it was a solid weekend and a good rebound from Milwaukee,\u201d said Murray. \u201cWe had the pace for a top 10, but a couple of small mistakes cost us. I\u2019m grateful to Andretti and to all of my partners \u2014 this season has been about learning and laying foundations for 2026.\u201d \u201cA huge thank you goes to our three drivers \u2014 Louis Foster, Callum Ilott, and Seb Murray. We\u2019ve enjoyed working with them throughout 2025 and look forward to continuing these relationships into 2026. INDYCAR has surpassed all expectations in terms of global brand exposure for SEGG Media, particularly for Sports.com and Lottery.com. As an American company listed on the most prestigious exchange in the world, it is important to our shareholders and investors that our brands are front and center in America\u2019s finest sports. INDYCAR has proven to be the perfect stage for that.\u201d \u2014 Matthew McGahan, Chairman, President & CEO of SEGG Media \u201cAs the 2025 INDYCAR season draws to a close, it has exceeded our expectations in brand exposure and opened the door to new connections and potential joint ventures for 2026. We\u2019ve taken a hands-on approach with our drivers, attending as many races as possible to encourage, develop, and expand our presence in INDYCAR. We are excited to soon share with shareholders and investors our plans for 2026, which include the launch of the Elite Driver and Sponsorship Program.\u201d \u2014 Marc Bircham, Main Board Director of SEGG Media and Head of Sports.com Acquisitions With three drivers delivering results and significant brand exposure in Nashville, SEGG Media is now focused on expanding its motorsport footprint for 2026.
