  "description": "Your iPhone doesn\u2019t have to be this frustrating.",
  "content": "Some default iPhone behaviors can be more frustrating than helpful. But there's no need to put up with them. A few quick adjustments in Settings are all it takes to remove those annoyances and make your iPhone far more enjoyable to use.\n\nBy default, the iPhone\u2019s Control Center stretches across three pages. This seems handy, as you get extra space for quick toggles and shortcuts to features you might need occasionally. In reality, though, I\u2019ve realized that most of us only need one page, and that is enough to hold everything that actually matters.\n\nAlso, the multipage setup has its own headaches. For instance, swiping through pages to reach the toggle you want can be frustrating. To simplify things, I've trimmed my Control Center down to a single page. This way, all my essential toggles are right there, ready to use.\n\nType to Siri keeps popping up\n\nSiri is supposed to make life easier, but sometimes it feels like an overenthusiastic assistant who won't take a hint. I often found myself accidentally triggering the Type to Siri feature when all I was trying to do was swipe up from the bottom.\n\nTo turn it off, go to Settings > Apple Intelligence & Siri > Talk & Type to Siri, then turn off Type to Siri. Personally, I prefer talking to Siri anyway, since it's faster and feels more natural. Once I made this change, my swipes stopped triggering unwanted pop-ups, and my iPhone finally started behaving.\n\nAnother default behavior that drove me nuts was Reachability. Swiping down on the bottom edge brings the top of the screen within the thumb\u2019s reach. This is surely helpful for anyone who has a Pro Max model and likes using the one-handed mode.\n\nIn reality, though, this is another feature that's easy to trigger. To turn it off, go to Settings > Accessibility > Touch and turn off Reachability. Once I did this, my screen stopped jumping around unexpectedly.\n\nNotifications keep lighting up the screen\n\nLock screen notifications are useful as they alert you to important things even when you\u2019re not actively using your iPhone. The problem is that every single one of them lights up the screen. This means a late-night email, a random app alert, or even a calendar reminder can suddenly flash your phone awake and demand your attention.\n\nUnfortunately, iOS doesn't offer a direct setting to stop the screen from lighting up. There are workarounds, though. One option is to enable Do Not Disturb, but that means missing all notifications. A better option is to disable lock screen notifications for apps that don\u2019t really need your immediate attention.\n\nGo to Settings > Notifications, select the app, and untick Lock Screen. With this change, only the truly important alerts will wake your phone, while everything else stays quietly in the background.\n\nAccessing an app\u2019s settings is usually something you want to do while you\u2019re actually using it. Take the Camera app, for example. You might want to enable or disable the grid, switch capture formats, or tweak other options.\n\nOn Android, you can often adjust these settings right inside the app. On an iPhone, though, you have to back out, head to Settings > Apps, scroll down, and then find Camera.\n\nThis behavior is the same across all apps, including App Store, Maps, Phone, and others. It's not very intuitive. The good news is there's a quicker way to access app settings. Swipe down on the home screen, type the app's name, scroll down to the Settings section, and tap the app's settings icon. This works for all apps, including third-party ones.\n\nThose little red badges sitting on app icons are meant to be helpful reminders. However, when every other app on your home screen is showing a glaring red circle, it can get annoying really fast. Instead of nudging you to check something important, badges often become a constant distraction.\n\nThe problem is more common in apps like Messages, Mail, and YouTube. Go to Settings > Notifications, pick an app, and toggle off Badges.\n\nYou\u2019ll still get alerts in your Notification Center, but your home screen won\u2019t be littered with red dots demanding constant attention. Once I turned off badges for apps like Mail and social media, my home screen felt calmer and far less distracting.\n\nEvery time you snap a photo on your iPhone, it plays that classic shutter click. It\u2019s meant to mimic the feel of a real camera, but the sound can be distracting sometimes. Maybe you want to capture a quiet moment, like taking a photo of a sleeping baby, without drawing attention.\n\nThe easiest way to silence the iPhone camera sound is by enabling the Silent mode using the Ring/Silent switch or Action button on the side of your iPhone. But if you don\u2019t want your phone in silent mode all the time, there\u2019s another option: enable Live Photos. With Live Photos turned on, the shutter sound is automatically muted, so you can take photos in peace.\n\nComing from Android, I expected some adjustment time with the iPhone. What I didn\u2019t expect was how many little default settings would get in the way. After making the changes above, many of my biggest annoyances disappeared, and the iPhone became far easier to live with.",

      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\n- The Control Center on your iPhone lets you quickly access features like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, the flashlight, Do Not Disturb, and more.\n- You can customize the Control Center by adding, rearranging, or removing controls to suit your preferences.\n- It's a good idea to disable Control Center access on the Lock Screen to prevent others from making changes to your iPhone's settings.\nThe iOS Control Center offers a convenient way to quickly access various settings and features without needing to navigate through the Settings app or third-party apps. Here's everything you need to know about using and customizing your iPhone's Control Center.\nHow to Access Your iPhone's Control Center\nLet's start with the basics, i.e., opening the Control Center. The method varies slightly depending on your iPhone model:\n- On an iPhone with a Home button (like the iPhone SE, 8, and earlier), you need to swipe up from the bottom of the screen.\n- On an iPhone with Face ID (like the iPhone X and later), swipe down from the top-right corner of the screen.\nTo close the Control Center, long-press on an empty area. Depending on your iPhone model, you may also swipe up (models with Face ID) or down (models with a Home button) to exit.\nOpening the Control Center also displays handy icons at the top, such as the carrier name, rotation lock status, and battery percentage. With iOS 18, you also get an option to turn off your iPhone directly from the Control Center.\nWhat to Do if You Can't Access the Control Center\nIf, for some reason, you can't access the Control Center, try restarting your iPhone first. If that doesn't help, ensure that Control Center is enabled within apps and on the Lock Screen.\nFinally, if nothing else works, updating to the latest iOS version and resetting all settings by going to Settings > General > Reset > Reset All Settings should help.\nHow to Use the Control Center on Your iPhone\nFrom adjusting brightness and volume to controlling media playback and activating Do Not Disturb mode, the Control Center puts essential tools at your fingertips. Plus, using the Control Center is straightforward.\nIf your iPhone is running iOS 18, you can swipe between different Control Center pages by swiping up and down or tapping the icons on the right. You can tap, slide, or long-press the toggles to interact with them.\nFor example, you can swipe up or down on the brightness slider to adjust the brightness. Pressing and holding the brightness slider reveals icons for Dark Mode, Night Shift, and True Tone. Similarly, long-pressing the flashlight icon allows you to adjust its intensity.\nIf you tap and hold on the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or AirDrop icons, you can select a different Wi-Fi network, choose another Bluetooth device, or change AirDrop visibility settings, respectively.\nHow to Edit the Control Center on an iPhone\nThe Control Center offers several handy options on your iPhone. You can add, rearrange, or remove controls to customize it according to your preferences.\nTo edit the Control Center on your iPhone, follow these steps:\n- Open the Control Center and tap the plus button (+) in the top-left corner. Alternatively, you can long-press anywhere on an empty spot to edit the Control Center.\n- Tap Add a Control and then scroll through the list to select the control you want to add.\n- Once added, you can drag the control anywhere to place it or move it to a different page. You can also resize the control to your liking.\n- To remove a control, tap the minus icon in its top-left corner.\n- Tap anywhere on an empty spot to save the changes.\nBy default, the Control Center shows only three pages, but you can add or remove pages as needed. To add a new page to the Control Center, tap and hold an empty spot to enter edit mode, then tap the circle icon on the right to access a blank page. Next, tap Add a Control and select a control to create a new page. To remove a Control Center page, simply remove all the controls from that page.\nHow to Disable Control Center Access on the Lock Screen\nBy default, anyone with access to your iPhone can access the Control Center from the Lock Screen. From there, they can put your device in Airplane Mode, turn off Wi-Fi, play music, use Home controls, and more.\nHowever, you can prevent this by disabling Control Center access on the Lock Screen. To do this:\n- Open Settings, then scroll down and tap Face ID & Passcode or Touch ID & Passcode.\n- Enter your iPhone passcode to continue.\n- Under Allow Access When Locked, turn off the toggle next to Control Center.\nHow to Turn Off Control Center Access Within Apps\nIf you play iPhone games that involve vigorous swiping, or if your kids use the device to learn and play, you may want to disable Control Center access within apps to prevent accidentally opening it. Here's how to do that:\n- Open the Settings app on your iPhone.\n- Scroll down and tap Control Center.\n- Turn off Access Within Apps.\nAfter this, you'll need to head to your iPhone's Home Screen or Lock Screen to access the Control Center.\nUseful Control Center Tips to Maximize Your Experience\nNow that you are familiar with how to access, edit, and disable the Control Center on your iPhone, here are some useful tips to help you make the most of it:\n- With iOS 18, the Control Center now supports toggles for various third-party apps, so you'll see options from apps like ChatGPT, Instagram, Snapchat, and more.\n- You can add a Notes icon to the Control Center, allowing you to quickly jot down text from your iPhone's Lock Screen.\n- If you wish to record your gameplay, create tutorials, or similar activities, you can add the Screen Recording shortcut to the Control Center.\n- Adding the Shazam icon to the Control Center lets you recognize songs on your iPhone without having to summon Siri.\n- If you have an Apple TV, adding the Apple TV Remote to the Control Center provides you with a virtual remote to control your Apple TV.\n- You can also add a shortcut for any app to launch it quickly from the Control Center.\nThe Control Center on your iPhone is extremely useful for accessing essential features and settings. By taking advantage of the iOS Control Center, you can avoid heading to the Settings app or opening third-party apps to access the features you use frequently."

      "text": "Summary\n- Type to Siri allows typing commands to interact silently, reducing awkwardness in public or noisy places.\n- Updated in iOS 18.1 with new UI and Apple Intelligence, Type to Siri is available on newer iPhone models.\n- Enable and use Type to Siri by toggling settings based on iPhone model & activation method preference.\nUsing voice commands to interact with Siri lets you perform tasks and get answers to queries hands-free, making it perfect for multitasking. However, speaking to Siri can feel awkward in public places. Thankfully, you can use Type to Siri to get around the awkward conversations with your phone, while still getting the answers you need.\nWhat Is Type to Siri?\nType to Siri allows you to interact with Siri by typing your commands and queries instead of speaking them out loud. While specifically helpful for individuals with speech impairments, the feature provides value for everyone.\nNot only does it help eliminate the awkwardness of talking to Siri in public, but it also enables you to effectively interact with Siri in noisy environments, where it can be challenging for Siri to hear and understand you.\nType to Siri was first introduced in iOS 11 as an accessibility feature. However, Apple realized that more people could benefit from it, and it released an improved version of Type to Siri with iOS 18.1. The latest update gives Type to Siri a new UI, introduces a new activation method, and makes it more context-aware with Apple Intelligence integration. You can even enable the ChatGPT extension to seek help with advanced queries.\nWhich iPhones Support Type to Siri?\nType to Siri is available on all iPhones running iOS 11 or later. However, you need an iPhone that supports Apple Intelligence to use its updated version. Here's a list of the iPhone models with the updated version:\n- iPhone 15 Pro\n- iPhone 15 Pro Max\n- iPhone 16\n- iPhone 16 Plus\n- iPhone 16 Pro\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max\nHow to Enable and Use Type to Siri on Your iPhone\nEnabling and using Type to Siri on an iPhone is straightforward. However, the process differs for older and newer iPhone models due to the relocated toggle and trigger.\nEnabling and Using Type to Siri on iPhones With Apple Intelligence\nOn Apple Intelligence-supported iPhones:\n- Open Settings.\n- Tap Apple Intelligence & Siri > Talk & Type to Siri.\n- Toggle the button beside Type to Siri to on.\nOnce enabled, all you need to do is double-tap the horizontal App Switcher bar along the bottom edge of the screen to activate Type to Siri. Then, begin typing your query or command and hit the send key to submit the request. Siri will then respond to it accordingly.\nIf tapping the App Switcher bar feels awkward, you can customize your iPhone's Action button to invoke Type to Siri instead. Just open Settings and select Action Button. Then, scroll to Controls and hit Choose a Control. Finally, look up Type to Siri and tap it.\nNow, press and hold the Action button to activate Type to Siri.\nEnabling and Using Type to Siri on Older iPhones\nTo enable Type to Siri on iPhones that don't support Apple Intelligence, follow these steps:\n- Open Settings.\n- Head to Accessibility > Siri.\n-\nToggle on the Type to Siri option.\nAfter you've enabled Type to Siri, press the Side button on your iPhone to invoke it. When this brings up the keyboard, type whatever command or query you have for Siri, and it will respond.\nUnlike on iOS 18.1, Siri can sometimes fail to determine when you make a query using text and will respond using voice instead. If you think you'll be using Type to Siri most of the time, you can tell it to respond silently. On the Siri settings page, go to the Spoken Responses section and select the Prefer Silent Responses option.\nType to Siri is a handy feature when you want to interact with Siri discreetly. So, be sure to enable it on your iPhone, especially if you use Apple Intelligence or Siri frequently. Doing so won't disable the voice functionality, so you can pick your preferred method to seek assistance from Siri based on the situation.\nAside from your iPhone, you can also use Type to Siri on your Mac. Type to Siri is available on Macs running macOS High Sierra or above, though you need an Apple Intelligence-compatible Mac running macOS Sequoia to use its latest version."

      "text": "Turning off the camera sound on your iPhone is something you probably want to do at times. That sound doesn't really add anything valuable, and it's loud when taking a picture at night or in quiet places. It's a similar story with the screenshot sound, which doesn't serve much of a purpose.\nIf you're wondering how to turn off the camera shutter sound on your iPhone, or disable the screenshot sound on your iPhone, you've come to the right place. We'll show you several methods to turn off these sounds.\nIf you live in Japan or South Korea, these tips won't work for you. This is because phones sold in those regions have a hard-coded camera sound that you cannot disable, to prevent people from taking inappropriate pictures of others without their knowledge. Thus, the only way to disable those sounds is through jailbreak methods, which is beyond the scope of this guide.\n1. Turn Off the Screenshot and Camera Sounds by Flipping Your iPhone's Silent Switch\nThe easiest way to turn off the camera sound on your iPhone 13, 12, 11, X, 8, 7, 6, SE, or any other model is to flip the mute switch on the side of your device. Every iPhone model has a ring/silent switch on its left side, at the top.\nIn silent mode, your iPhone will not ring for calls and other alerts. However, it will vibrate if you have the Settings > Sounds & Haptics > Vibrate on Silent slider enabled. Crucially, having your iPhone in silent mode also prevents the camera and screenshot sounds from playing.\nWhen the switch is closer to the screen, ring mode is enabled, so your device will play sounds as normal. When it's in the silent position, you'll see orange underneath the switch. Simply move the switch to the silent position (away from your device's screen) and you can take as many silent screenshots and pictures as you like.\n2. Enable Live Photos to Turn Off the iPhone Shutter Sound\nOn the iPhone 6s and later, you can capture Live Photos. These \"moving pictures\" include a few seconds of video and sound from before and after you took the photo. If you enable Live Photos, your iPhone won't play the camera sound\u2014since it would be audible in the Live Photo and thus ruin it.\nTo toggle Live Photos in the Camera app, simply tap the Live Photos icon, which looks like a circle with several rings around it. The icon appears at the top-right of the screen for most modern devices. When it doesn't have a slash through the icon, you've enabled Live Photos and won't hear a shutter noise.\nThis allows you to turn off the camera sound on your iPhone without muting it. Unfortunately, this method won't disable the sound effect for taking screenshots.\nKeep in mind that Live Photos use more space on your device and that they might include audio you intended to be private.\n3. Manually Lower Your iPhone's Volume to Disable the Camera Sound\nYou can silence your iPhone's camera sound by manually lowering the volume on your device. Normally, you can use your iPhone's Volume buttons, on the left side of your phone, to adjust this. However, if you press them while using the camera, it will take a picture instead.\nThus, before you open the Camera app, simply press and hold the Volume down button until the sound is all the way down, or at least as quiet as you desire. If you prefer, you can also lower the volume using iOS' Control Center.\nOn an iPhone without a Home button, swipe down from the top-right to open Control Center. On iPhone models with a Home button, swipe up from the bottom of the screen instead. Here, find the Volume slider and lower it all the way.\nTurning down the volume on your device will mute the camera sound effect on your iPhone. Unfortunately, this won't mute the screenshot sound.\n4. Take a Picture Without the Camera Sound While Recording Video\nThe three methods above are the easiest ways to turn off the shutter sound on your iPhone. However, there are yet more ways to silence this sound if you desire additional workarounds.\nYou can also silently take a picture on your iPhone while recording a video. To do this, open the Camera app and select the Video mode. Tap the red Record button to start capturing video. While the video is running, you'll see a white shutter button appear to the side. Simply tap this button to take a picture of the current frame.\nKeep in mind that starting and stopping the video recording will play a brief sound. However, this isn't as annoying as the camera shutter sound, and taking a picture while recording doesn't make the shutter sound.\n5. Connect Headphones Before Taking a Picture to Redirect the Shutter Sound\nWhen you connect headphones or earbuds to your iPhone, it will play all sounds through that device. You can use this to your advantage to take pictures on your iPhone without the shutter sound.\nSimply connect headphones, whether wired headphones that use the Lightning port on your device or wirelessly using Bluetooth. Then, when you take a picture, the camera sound will play\u2014inside the headphones. With a pair of earbuds in your ears (or even laid around your neck), nobody else will hear the sound.\nJust be sure that the volume isn't too loud on your device ahead of time, or you might hurt your ears when you take a screenshot or photo.\nEasily Turn Off the Camera and Screenshot Sounds on iPhone\nIt's not hard to disable the sounds that play when you take a picture with the camera or snap a screenshot on your iPhone. As long as you think ahead before you do it, you won't have to deal with the potentially embarrassing or annoying sound effects from taking a picture.\nMeanwhile, if you ever expect to hear the screenshot sound but don't, you may need to troubleshoot the volume on your iPhone."

      "text": "Do Not Disturb is now categorized under Focus, and it's a valuable tool you can use to stop distractions as you go about your business. It stops calls, notifications, and other prompts that typically pop up on your Apple devices.\nHowever, there are various Focus presets, and Do Not Disturb is just one of them. You can learn to edit your Focus presets so that they are more optimized for what you need them for. We've detailed the steps for how to do it on your iPhone.\nHow to Edit Focus Settings on Your iPhone\nApple's Focus feature has preset modes you can set up, but you can also create custom modes if needed. However, if you're ever dissatisfied with how Do Not Disturb or other Focus modes work, you should head to Settings > Focus and tap the preset you want to change.\nTo make things simpler, we've divided the settings menu into different sections so you can better understand what each of them does.\nAllow Notifications\nAs pointed out in the description, Allow Notifications will let certain contacts and apps ignore Focus and notify you. And there are three options here: People, Apps, and Options.\nPeople has two modes: Silence Notifications From and Allow Notifications From. The first silences notifications from the people you add to the list below (it's inefficient unless you're being very specific on the people you don't want to reach you). The second one is the default, and it lets you choose who can reach you instead.\nThe next section in People, called Phone Calls, is designed so you can also choose to allow calls from some people.\n- Allowed People Only lets you receive calls from people you've allowed notifications from.\n- Favorites lets people on your iPhone's favorite list call you while in Focus.\n- Contacts Only stops all calls from unsaved numbers.\n- Everybody lets everyone reach you.\nYou can also create custom contact lists which will appear in the Allow Call From dropdown menu.\nThe last setting here is Allow Repeated Calls, which, if toggled on, would let calls from people who call you twice within three minutes.\nApps mirrors People in that it lets you choose to either Silence Notifications From or Allow Notifications From the apps you add to the list below. However, instead of \"Allow Repeated Calls,\" it has a Time-Sensitive Notification toggle, which, if toggled, would allow apps with notifications marked Time Sensitive to notify you even while in Focus.\nThe last part of Allow Notifications is Options (or Notification Options). It has three toggles:\n- Show On Lock Screen will display all the silenced notifications on the Lock Screen instead of sending them to the Notification Center to peruse later.\n- Dim Lock Screen simply darkens the Lock Screen while this Focus is on. It's a good way to remind yourself your phone is in Focus.\n- Hide Notification Badges hide those little red circles appearing on your apps. They tell you how many unread notifications you have on that app.\nYou can learn more about badges, banners, and alerts to make the most of your iPhone notifications.\nCustomize Screens\nIf you'd like something cosmetic to help you avoid distractions, Focus allows you to have a different Home Screen and Lock Screen for the duration of Focus.\nThere are two images in this section; the one on the left (with the time) is the Lock Screen, and the other is the Home Screen.\nHere's how to change your Lock Screen and Home Screen background image:\n- Tap Choose below the Lock Screen page and create a new Lock Screen by tapping Pick a Lock Screen from the Gallery.\n- Choose something from all the different categories.\n- Select Add on the top right of the sample view.\n- Tap Set as Wallpaper Pair if you want your Lock Screen as your Home Screen as well.\n- You can also select Customize Home Screen to choose more specific details on what you want your Home Screen to look like.\n- Tap Done on the top right when you're finished.\nSurprisingly, selecting Choose under the Home Screen doesn't let you change your Home Screen wallpaper. Instead, it makes you select what page(s) you would like on your Home Screen as a way to limit distractions. So, you can pile up all the apps you need to work on one page and turn off all the rest.\nSet a Schedule\nYou can automatically trigger Focus by using a schedule. You can set it up based on time, location, or an app.\nHere's how to create a schedule:\n- Tap Add Schedule.\n- You have four options: Time, Location, App, and Smart Activation.\n- Smart Activation will learn from your app usage, locations, and other factors to automatically turn your Focus on. Tap the plus (+) sign on Smart Activation to create a Smart Activation schedule.\n- If you want to use another schedule, tap Time, Location, or App instead. But remember, you can have multiple schedules for one Focus; you don't need to worry that choosing one will exclude the other.\n- Tap Time to set up the hours and days of the week you want your Focus on. Tap Done when you're finished.\n- Tap Location, search for a place, and use the slider at the bottom to reduce or increase the area of effect. Tap Done when you're finished.\n- Tap App to choose from a list of apps.\nCombine schedules as you please to create a more wholesome automated Focus experience.\nFocus Filters\nFocus filters add another layer of distraction avoidance to your Focus mode by removing elements of certain apps while in Focus.\nScroll down to the last segment of your Focus settings and tap Add Filter. A list of the available filters will appear. This list falls into App Filters and System Filters.\nApp Filters vary depending on what apps you have installed. For example, if you Messages, you'll have the option to filter conversations in Messages so you only see conversations from contacts you have added to your Focus.\nSystem Filters, on the other hand, are system settings you can automatically enable by turning on the Focus. For instance, you can enable Low Power Mode if you would like it to turn on once you enter a particular Focus mode.\nSelect the filters you want to use and tap Add at the top-right corner.\nApple's Focus Feature Has Come a Long Way\nComing from the lowly days when Focus was just Do Not Disturb, it has grown a lot to become a powerful tool for productivity. It's also a great way to combat phone addiction or avoid constant notifications from social media.\nMix and match these Focus settings till you find one that isn't too excessive or too light, and you will enjoy peace of mind while working or spending time with your loved ones."
