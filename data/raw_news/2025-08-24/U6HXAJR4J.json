  "content": "European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned against questioning the independence of policymakers and their institutions, arguing that economies risk becoming dysfunctional if governments get involved in setting interest rates.\n\n\u201cThe independence of any central bank is critically important,\u201d Lagarde said on Fox News\u2019 . \u201cWe have to be accountable, we have to report back and answer all the questions of either Congress in the US or the European Parliament, for me. But it\u2019s vitally important that a central bank is independent.\u201d\n\u2022 We Need a Reality Check on Crime, Safety and Transit\n\nShe added that during her time at the top of the International Monetary Fund, she had a chance to watch what happens when central-bank independence comes under threat.\n\n\u201cIt becomes dysfunctional, it starts doing things that it shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d Lagarde said. \u201cThe next step is disruption. It is instability, if not worse. So I think that this should not be debated.\u201d\n\nIn the US, where Lagarde attended the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Fed Chair Jerome Powell is under relentless attack from US President Donald Trump for refusing to lower rates. Officials attending the gathering expressed their support for him with a standing ovation before his speech.\n\u2022 Taco Bell\u2019s Not-So-Secret Sauce: An Endless Stream of New Stuff\n\u2022 Staff Cuts and Turmoil Hit the CFTC While the Crypto It Oversees Booms\n\u2022 Women\u2019s Earnings Never Really Recover After They Have Children\n\u2022 Foreigners Are Buying US Homes Again While Americans Get Sidelined",
