  "description": "Fast, affordable internet has never been more accessible",
  "content": "Some of the biggest changes to the NBN since its launch are just around the corner, with planned NBN speed upgrades going live from Sunday, September 14.\n\nWhen they do, millions of homes in Australia with fibre to the premises (FTTP) or hybrid fibre coax (HFC) connections will be eligible for major speed boosts, either to their current plan or by upgrading to NBN 2000 plans, with a theoretical maximum download speed of 2Gbps.\n\nThe best of the speed boosts in my opinion, however, come with the arrival of NBN 500 plans \u2013 an upgrade to the current crop of the best NBN 100 plans, giving them a 5x speed boost to a maximum of 500Mbps. In my mind, 500Mbps download speeds will be more than enough for the majority of Australian homes, and given they\u2019re set to arrive at no extra cost (in theory), they\u2019re on course to offer the greatest overall value.\n\nCementing my argument has been the early launch of three NBN 500 plans from reputable providers Exetel, Spintel and Tangerine. All three are incredibly competitively priced, costing less than a few NBN 25 plans that are 20x slower. Exetel comfortably takes the crown for the most affordable plan, and so, I\u2019m now waiting in suspense for the wider rollout from other providers to see if anyone undercuts it.\n\nIf you want to get ahead of the pack, the three providers mentioned are the only ones to currently offer an NBN 500 plan. And as also mentioned, you\u2019ll need an FTTP or HFC connection to take advantage of them. If you don\u2019t have either of these connection types, then you may be eligible for the free fibre upgrade program, which will see the necessary equipment installed at your premises. You can activate this upgrade via your chosen provider when you order your NBN 500 plan.\n\nThe plans to get\n\nAll of these three NBN 500 plan offerings are easy to recommend, although I\u2019d argue Exetel\u2019s is the most attractive. As mentioned, I\u2019ll be keeping an eye on what happens in a couple of weeks when the remaining RSPs launch their own.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 Check out more of the fastest NBN plans\n\u2022 Keen on NBN Co's big free speed boosts this September?

      "text": "Keen on NBN Co's big free speed boosts this September? You might also need a new router\nTo get the best speeds on the new faster plans, your router may need an upgrade too\nBig speed boosts are coming for the NBN, and while changes to your plan in the past might have been as simple as upgrading your speed tier or switching between the best NBN providers, things are different this time around \u2013 and many households may need to buy a new Wi-Fi router to get the full speed available.\nIn September, Australia\u2019s NBN network will receive its most substantial speed upgrade since it was first switched on in 2010. For FTTP (fibre to the premises) and HFC (hybrid-fibre coaxial) customers, NBN 100 plans will have their maximum download speed boosted from 100Mbps to 500Mbps, while NBN 250 will get an increase from 250Mbps to 750Mbps. A new top tier is also being introduced, NBN 2000, which as the name suggests will have a theoretical top speed of 2,000Mbps.\nNBN 1000, NBN 25 and the most popular speed tier in Australia, NBN 50, will not get new maximum speeds, though NBN 1000 will be given a new minimum speed of 750Mbps. If your household is still using FTTN (fibre to the node) or FTTC (fibre to the curb) technology, you'll need to see if you qualify for the government's free NBN fibre upgrade program to enjoy the new speeds.\n- Read more: NBN 500 plans are coming as a FREE upgrade starting September \u2013 here's how to make sure you're eligible\n- Read more: NBN 750 plans are set to replace NBN 250 with triple speeds for free \u2013 here\u2019s everything you need to know\n- Read more: NBN 2000 plans: all your questions about the upcoming Hyperfast internet tier answered\nYou may also want to consider our guides to the best NBN plans and the best cheap NBN plans if you\u2019re thinking about switching providers in the lead-up to the September speed changes.\nIf you\u2019re tempted by the exceptional speeds that\u2019ll be available on the 500Mbps, 750Mbps and 2,000Mbps speeds, note that you may need to also purchase a newer and faster router to actually get the full speed on devices like laptops, desktop PCs, phones and gaming consoles.\nIf your Wi-Fi router is particularly old (let\u2019s say five or more years) or you notice dramatic speed drops around the home when using Wi-Fi, then an upgrade may also help resolve these problems. To make choosing the right router easier, we\u2019ve highlighted five models below that can help ensure you get the best speed possible from your NBN connection and also avoid any frustrating dead spots around your home. We also note the kinds of Wi-Fi routers that are needed to achieve full speed on an ultrafast 1,000Mbps or new 2,000Mbps NBN plan.\nWhat happens if you have an older Wi-Fi router but don\u2019t upgrade? Your internet will still work, but you may notice you aren\u2019t getting anywhere close to the full speed possible when the new NBN plans start to arrive in September.\nWant to know more about how to find the best router? We dig deep in our FAQ further down.\nWhat minimum Wi-Fi type will you need for each speed tier?\nDeciding on the minimum Wi-Fi type you need can be tricky, as everyone's home internet requirements are different. However, if we\u2019re looking at the minimum required tech for an NBN 500 or faster plan, we\u2019d recommend a router with at least Wi-Fi 6 connectivity, and one that offers enough extra overall bandwidth so you can achieve your plan\u2019s top speed consistently, even if you're not physically right next to the router itself.\nIf you\u2019re shopping for a new router, the maximum Wi-Fi bandwidth a model offers is reflected in the numbers immediately following AX, AXE or BE when looking at the specs of your device. For example, AX1800 is good for up to 1,800Mbps, but note that\u2019s maximum combined throughput, factoring in having multiple wireless devices connected and accessing the internet.\nIn the real world, when you\u2019re sitting on the couch with one of the best laptops, an AX1800 router will give you a top wireless speed of 750Mbps to any individual device. While that\u2019s fine for a NBN 500 plan, it falls short of what\u2019s needed to get the full speed from NBN 1000 or NBN 2000. Moreover, the further away you are from your router, the lower the maximum wireless speed will be, so to achieve top speeds throughout your house, we advise choosing a router that doesn\u2019t just meet the minimum your NBN plan might need, but provides significantly more so you have some headroom.\nFor NBN 750 and NBN 1000, you could get by on a Wi-Fi 6 router, but ideally we\u2019d recommend a Wi-Fi 6E or 7 model, and in all those cases, you should aim for a combined top speed rating of at least 3,000Mbps (AX3000 or BE3000) of bandwidth.\nFor NBN 2000, keep in mind that the NBN Co. will also need to upgrade the NTD (network termination device) at your location, and you will need a router with a 2.5Gbps wired Ethernet port. While the best Wi-Fi 6E routers will work with NBN 2000, you should be looking at Wi-Fi 7 models with 11,000Mbps (or better) throughput, and for power users, 19,000Mbps (BE19000).\nHere's a quick recap of the above recommendations:\n- NBN 500: Wi-Fi 6 or higher (1,800Mbps or faster)\n- NBN 750: Wi-Fi 6E or higher (3,000Mbps or faster)\n- NBN 1000: Wi-Fi 6E or 7 (3,000Mbps or faster)\n- NBN 2000: Wi-Fi 7 (11,000Mbps or faster)\nThe best easy NBN router solution\nGoogle Nest Wi-Fi Pro\nA simple router for any household\nWireless connectivity: Wi-Fi 6E, 2.4GHz/5GHz/6GHz simultaneous tri-band | Wired connectivity: 2x Gigabit Ethernet ports | Features: Mesh, Matter support, parental controls | Throughput: up to 5,400Mbps | Suitable for: up to NBN 1000\nGoogle\u2019s Nest Wi-Fi Pro is the best all-rounder solution if you\u2019re after a simple internet upgrade to support the new faster NBN tiers. Capable of maximum throughput of up to 5,400Mbps and offering Wi-Fi 6E with mesh support, this router will have no trouble accessing the fast speeds offered by NBN 1000.\nA three-pack isn\u2019t much more expensive than a single Nest Wi-Fi Pro module, so we recommend picking that kit, even if your home has a small footprint. With only Gigabit Ethernet on wired ports, it won\u2019t cut it for NBN 2000, but this is a suitable choice for anything up to NBN 1000.\nThe best budget NBN router\nTP-Link Deco X55 AX3000\nA low-cost way of getting NBN 1000-ready\nWireless connectivity: Wi-Fi 6, 2.4GHz/5GHz | Wired connectivity: 3x Gigabit Ethernet ports | Features: IoT device support, parental controls | Throughput: up to 3,000Mbps | Suitable for: up to NBN 1000\nThe TP-Link Deco X55 AX3000 is the router to go with if cost is your main concern. This device comes as either a three-piece mesh kit or as a single device, meaning you can easily add more units in the future to cover a larger area.\nCombine that flexibility with an AX3000 speed rating and Wi-Fi 6 connectivity, and you\u2019ve got a great all-rounder that\u2019ll deliver fast speeds well. Just be aware that some additional features are locked behind a subscription (such as advanced parental controls and additional antivirus security), which can cost between AU$4.99 per month (or AU$59.99 annually) and AU$7.99 per month (AU$29.99 annually).\nThe best NBN router for an apartment or small home\nTP-Link Deco XE75\nThe best option for an apartment or small home\nWireless connectivity: Wi-Fi 6E, 2.4GHz/5GHz/6GHz simultaneous tri-band | Wired connectivity: 3x Gigabit Ethernet ports | Features: IoT device support, parental controls | Throughput: up to 5,400Mbps | Suitable for: up to NBN 1000\nIf you\u2019re living in an apartment without much space, you may not need a mesh network, and your wireless signals may be overlapping with dozens of others in the building, which can lead to the main Wi-Fi bands being quite congested \u2013 and slow speeds down for everyone. This makes a router like the TP-Link Deco XE75 a worthwhile option, as its Wi-Fi 6E tri-band connectivity allows it to better avoid congestion by using the newly unlocked 6GHz band, plus it has a range of improved technologies that better handle crowded airwaves.\nIf you want, you can add on an additional XE75 unit to create a mesh network, or purchase the router in a pack of two or three mesh devices. Keep in mind that some security and parental controls settings are locked behind a subscription, costing between AU$4.99 per month (or AU$29.99 annually) and AU$7.99 per month (AU$59.99 annually) depending on your selected features. This router only features a single gigabit Ethernet port, so it isn\u2019t suitable for NBN 2000.\nThe best NBN router for a big home\nNetgear Orbi 770\nThe best option for a big home\nWireless connectivity: Wi-Fi 7, 2.4GHz/5GHz/6GHz simultaneous tri-band | Wired connectivity: 1x 2.5Gb Ethernet (WAN), 3x 2.5Gb Ethernet (LAN) on router / 2x 2.5Gb Ethernet (LAN) on satellites | Features: App support, Guest and IoT networks, multi-link operation | Throughput: up to 11,000Mbps | Suitable for: up to NBN 2000\nNetgear\u2019s Orbi range is brilliant for a big home, with the 770 being competitively affordable when compared to other Wi-Fi 7 mesh networks. Read our 4.5-star Netgear Orbi 770 review for the full story, but the short version is that it offers Wi-Fi 7 and a total throughput of up to 10,800Mbps. The Orbi 770\u2019s mesh nodes can also use tri-band Wi-Fi or 2.5GbE wired connections to communicate with each other, to help ensure you get the best possible speeds across your entire home.\nThe 11,000Mbps bandwidth might seem overkill, but that\u2019s ideal for getting the most out of an NBN 500, 750 or 1,000 connection. If going for NBN 2000, we\u2019d recommend running Ethernet cables between your mesh nodes to ensure the fastest throughput possible. For power users on NBN 2000 plans, it\u2019s also worth considering the even faster Orbi 870.\nThe best router for performance\nNetgear Nighthawk RS700S\nThe best option for homes with a need for speed\nWireless connectivity: Wi-Fi 7, 2.4GHz/5GHz/6GHz | Wired connectivity: 1x 10Gb Ethernet, 4x Gigabit Ethernet ports | Features: IoT network tools, Smart Connect, multi-link operation | Throughput: up to 19,000Mbps | Suitable for: up to NBN 2000\nThis was Netgear\u2019s first Wi-Fi 7 router and it\u2019s definitely worth considering if you want the fastest speeds possible. Offering an ultrafast 10Gb Ethernet connection and total Wi-Fi throughput of up to 19,000Mbps, this is a router for serious gamers and families where everyone wants to stream their own show in 4K at the same time. Unlike other routers on this list, the RS700S allows you to split its bands into separate SSIDs, giving you more freedom to decide exactly how devices are connected on your home network.\nAt the moment, the RS700S isn\u2019t a mesh router, though it\u2019s expected to get updated with EasyMesh support at some point in the future. Alternatively, if you\u2019re after high speeds with a mesh network, you may be more interested in the Netgear Orbi 970, which offers a combined 27,000 Mbps of bandwidth.\nHow to pick a router for the fastest NBN speeds\nForgive us for getting technical, but there are a couple of things to consider.\nThroughput\nThroughput considers the maximum data transfer rate across all bands and ports, not the speed that you should expect from any single device. For a Wi-Fi 6 router, this is represented by AX and the numbers following it, with the latter providing a rough total of the available bandwidth in Mbps.\nA Wi-Fi 6E router will generally use the AX or AXE prefixes in its model name, and a Wi-Fi 7 router will use BE. It's recommended to go with a router with much more throughput than your NBN speed \u2013 for example, we suggest 1,800Mbps for NBN 500, all the way up to 11,000Mbps or better for NBN 2000.\nWi-Fi standard\nThis is likely the naming convention you\u2019re most familiar with. The Wi-Fi standard uses figures like \u2018Wi-Fi 6\u2019, \u2018Wi-Fi 6E\u2019, \u2018Wi-Fi 7\u2019 and so on to denote the generation of Wi-Fi technology a device supports. We\u2019re not recommending Wi-Fi 5 routers in this article because they don\u2019t tend to have the bandwidth needed for high speed NBN (500Mbps or faster), but an extremely basic rule of thumb is that the newer the tech and higher the Wi-Fi \u2018number\u2019, the better your router\u2019s throughput will be.\nWi-Fi 6 operates across both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz radio spectrums (or bands), with the router capable of using both. Wi-Fi 6E operates similarly, but adds the 6GHz band into the mix, which can help avoid interference. Wi-Fi 7 typically offers all three bands (though there are some dual-band Wi-Fi 7 routers on the market), but adds additional technology to improve speed and reliability \u2013 especially for connecting multiple devices and roaming on a mesh network.\nThese three radio bands each offer different performance considerations:\n- 2.4GHz, for example, tends to have the best range indoors, but real-world bandwidth tends to cap out at only a few hundred megabits per second, and as 2.4GHz has been around the longest, it tends to suffer the most interference\n- 5GHz offers much better bandwidth of up to 1,000Mbps at the cost of shorter range, and is common enough now that interference can be an issue.\n- 6GHz offers the same bandwidth as 5GHz, but on a frequency that is not yet commonly used, and is ideal for reaching or exceeding 2,000Mbps Wi-Fi speeds.\nUsing all three bands at the same time will improve the chances that individual devices get the best speeds possible.\nNow, let\u2019s bring these factors together. Combining the AX or BE indicated throughput with the latest Wi-Fi standards, you should be able to access the fastest possible speeds throughout the home \u2013 provided the router isn\u2019t too far away from your client device (and if it is, you may be interested in one of the best mesh Wi-Fi systems).\nEverything comes down to throughput \u2013 a Wi-Fi 7 router with a lower AX or BE rating should still be capable of offering max speeds on an NBN 750 connection, but what really matters is the maximum Mbps throughput your router can provide when transmitting a Wi-Fi signal.\nJust keep some things in mind about Wi-Fi standards:\n- Wi-Fi 6 utilises the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, with the 2.4GHz band prone to interference in crowded living environments, and Wi-Fi 6 is less capable of intelligently routing local traffic to be as fast as possible, at least when compared to Wi-Fi 6E and 7\n- Wi-Fi 6E uses 2.4GHz, 5GHz and 6GHz, incorporating newer tech to clamp down on interference, so there\u2019s less of a congestion issue \u2013 at least until 6GHz-capable routers become more common\n- Wi-Fi 7 gives better future-proofing, and can better handle multiple devices and roaming\n- A mesh Wi-Fi system can greatly improve Wi-Fi coverage throughout the home, regardless of the Wi-Fi standard being used\n- If you live in an apartment, check if your router has a feature called BSS colouring, as it helps address interference, and makes it easier for your router to ignore any signals from other networks. MU-MIMO is another great feature, and allows your router to better speak to several client devices at once, instead of one-by-one.\nWhat about the rest of my tech?\nWi-Fi\u2019s strong backwards compatibility means that older client devices like phones, laptops and other internet-connected tech may work with your new router, but for the best speeds those client devices will also need to match your router\u2019s fastest Wi-Fi standard.\nEach client device will support a specific maximum throughput, Wi-Fi standard and select bands \u2013 although typically, only the bands and Wi-Fi standard are openly advertised, and discovering the maximum speed a device supports will often mean doing a little digging.\nFor example, the PlayStation 5 launched with Wi-Fi 6 and a much slower throughput (around 1,000Mbps) than the later-released PlayStation 5 Pro, which offers Wi-Fi 7 and real-world throughput of up to around 3,000Mbps.\nThe same goes for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, which offers Wi-Fi 7 and throughput speeds of up to around 3,000Mbps. However, note that not all Wi-Fi 7 devices can connect at the same speed \u2013 for example, the latest iPhone 16 uses Wi-Fi 7, but only reaches top speeds of about 1,500Mbps in real-world tests, so it won\u2019t be able to fully utilise the maximum possible speed offered by an NBN 2000 plan. As a comparison, that still dwarfs the real-world throughput of the iPhone 14 with Wi-Fi 6, which peaks around 1,000Mbps.\nWhat about laptops? The latest M3 and M4 MacBook Pro laptops support Wi-Fi 6E and as such are capable of transferring data at up to 2,000Mbps, while older M2 Macs offer Wi-Fi 6 and will max out at around 1,000Mbps. There aren\u2019t a lot of laptops that support the full bandwidth made available with Wi-Fi 7, so to get the fastest speeds on an NBN 2000 connection, you\u2019d likely need to use a wired Ethernet connection.\nWhat is a Wi-Fi router?\nA Wi-Fi router is the box that takes your internet connection and redistributes it to all your client devices, from phone and laptops to doorbell cameras. For locations with an NBN connection, routers connect to another box with an NBN logo on it (known as a Network Termination Device), which connects to your NBN provider.\nYour router may have been provided directly by your NBN provider as an inclusion with your plan, or you may have purchased one from a tech retailer like Amazon or JB Hi-Fi. If it was purchased in the last couple of years, you might not need to upgrade it to support the incoming NBN speed boosts, but there are some indicators that can help determine if you should purchase a new unit or not.\nShould I upgrade my router for faster NBN speeds?\nSimply put, the newer the technology, the better the speed, and the more consistent experience when using Wi-Fi. The most consistent wireless experience often comes from using a mesh system, where nodes are placed around your home evenly and your devices connect to the optimal one. This is very helpful if your home is big or has thick walls, allowing you to expand the footprint of your network and avoid any dead spots.\nAdditionally, most older routers use Gigabit Ethernet ports (1,000Mbps) for wired connections, and we\u2019d recommend checking this \u2013 you will find more information in your router\u2019s manual or by looking it up online, or the max speed may be physically indicated on the device\u2019s ports. To handle the bandwidth of a 2,000Mbps connection from an NBN 2000 plan, your router will need 2.5GbE (2,500Mbps) support on its WAN (wide area network) port.\nGenerally speaking, if your router is Wi-Fi 5 or older, we think it is well worth purchasing a newer device if you\u2019d like to make the most of these new, faster plans. If your router is Wi-Fi 6, we\u2019d still recommend upgrading if you\u2019re considering NBN 1000, and if you\u2019re thinking of signing up to NBN 2000, we\u2019d recommend a Wi-Fi 7-capable model.\nYou may not see the benefit of upgrading if your household doesn\u2019t use the internet very intensively, but if you\u2019re finding things are slowing down (particularly when lots of people are using it) or care about getting the best possible speeds, the upgrade could be well worth it.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nZac has been in the tech writing game for six years, having previously written for Gizmodo Australia, Canstar Blue, and The Daily Mail Australia (with articles on Nine, Junkee, Kotaku Australia and Lifehacker Australia).

      "text": "NBN speed upgrades: launch date, new tiers, eligibility and everything else we know about the September 2025 changes\nGet high-speed ready with our in-depth guide to the changes coming to the NBN network\nYou may have seen our recent articles regarding the upcoming September 2025 NBN speed upgrades, which are set to affect fast NBN plans from 100Mbps up. If you haven\u2019t, and you\u2019re landing on this page for the first time, then here\u2019s a quick rundown.\nWhat are the NBN speed upgrades?\nIn short, NBN Co is introducing a new speed tier known as NBN 2000, which will offer up to 2Gbps download speeds \u2013 double that of the current fastest gigabit NBN 1000 tier.\nAlongside this new tier, NBN Co has also announced some speed upgrades to a selection of the current NBN tiers:\n- NBN 100 plans will see a 5x speed upgrade and become NBN 500, with a maximum download speed of 500Mbps\n- NBN 250 plans will get a 3x speed boost and become NBN 750, with a maximum download speed of 750Mbps\n- NBN 1000 plans will be upgraded to a minimum guaranteed speed of 750Mbps, but still max out at 1,000Mbps. They\u2019ll also receive a bump in upload speed, from 50Mbps to 100Mbps. We imagine they\u2019ll still be referred to as NBN 1000.\nWhen are the NBN speed upgrades happening?\nNBN Co has penned September 14, 2025 as the date the upgrades will be made available to retail service providers (RSPs) at a wholesale level.\nWe don\u2019t yet have confirmation as to when they\u2019ll be rolled out to customers by all the RSPs we monitor, but from our time searching for the best NBN plan recommendations, we have seen many indicating they will be activating the upgrades on the 14th, or very soon after.\nWho can access these NBN speed upgrades?\nBecause of the higher speeds involved, these speed upgrades will only be available to households and businesses that connect to the NBN via either a fibre to the premises (FTTP), or hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) connection type.\nCurrently, NBN 250 and NBN 1000 plans already require these types of connection, however NBN 100 plans are available to virtually everyone who connects to the fixed-line NBN network. Therefore, only customers with an NBN 100 plan and who connect via FTTP or HFC will be eligible to receive the speed boost to 500Mbps.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nHow can I get the NBN speed upgrade?\nIf you already connect via FTTP or HFC and you\u2019re signed up to an NBN 100 plan or higher, then in theory, you may not need to do anything, as we expect many RSPs will automatically push the speed increases out to you once they\u2019ve done any required back end tinkering. You may also need a new modem-router to achieve the new maximum speeds of your plan, which we\u2019ve detailed a little more below.\nIf you want to upgrade to the brand new NBN 2000 tier, however, then you\u2019ll need to sign up for a plan via an NBN provider when these become available. Most customers signing up for NBN 2000 will also need a new network termination device (NTD), which requires a technician to visit your premises to install. This will be arranged after ordering the plan from your selected RSP.\nIf you currently connect via a fibre to the node (FTTN) or fibre to the curb (FTTC) connection, then you will need to have the equipment upgraded to FTTP to access any of these upgraded speeds. Many FTTN and FTTC connections can access this upgrade for free thanks to NBN Co\u2019s free fibre upgrade program, as long as you live in an eligible suburb.\nThe majority of suburbs in Australia where a fixed-line NBN connection is available should now be eligible, and NBN Co has previously stated it intends to make the program available to 10 million households by the end of 2025.\nIf you don\u2019t know what connection type is at your address, you can use the NBN\u2019s free address checker to find out.\nIf you\u2019re already signed up for an NBN 100 plan, then come September 14, you may be able to ask your provider to activate the upgrade for you. If you\u2019re signed up to a slower plan \u2013 NBN 50 or lower \u2013 then you\u2019ll need to switch to at least an NBN 100 plan in order to receive the free FTTP upgrade.\nHow much will the upgraded NBN plans cost?\nIn theory, for those on NBN 100, 250 and 1000 plans, the improvements shouldn\u2019t increase your monthly fee, or if there is a price rise it should only be minimal.\nNBN Co has instituted new wholesale costs for its current plan line up as of July 1, 2025, which will likely see small increases across the board prior to the speed upgrade rollout. However, NBN Co has stated it won\u2019t be charging RSPs a higher wholesale cost when the upgraded speeds come into effect \u2013 so, for example, the wholesale cost of an NBN 500 plan will be the same as an NBN 100 plan.\nThere\u2019s one key unknown when it comes to costs, however, and that\u2019s to do with a part of accessing the internet that\u2019s out of NBN Co\u2019s hands \u2013 international bandwidth. Because the National Broadband Network infrastructure only operates within Australia, it\u2019s up to each provider to organise its own international connections.\nThese are required to reach any sites or services that do not have servers located in Australia. While many major brands and platforms (such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Microsoft and PlayStation) do have Australian servers, there are some notable exceptions \u2013 TikTok being a key one \u2013 and traffic to these does theoretically come at an additional cost to RSPs.\nSo, while we would love to say categorically that the faster plans won\u2019t cost more from September, RSPs do have costs beyond the wholesale fees NBN Co charges. In particular, if providers believe the increased speeds will strain their current capacity to serve international traffic \u2013 and they\u2019ll therefore need to purchase more bandwidth to cope \u2013 they may pass on a small increase to customers\u2019 monthly fees.\nWill my current modem-router still work with the new speeds?\nThe main recommendation we can make regarding the upcoming speed boosts is, if you do get them, you\u2019ll want to make sure you have a suitable Wi-Fi router at home that can support the faster speeds.\nMore specifically, we mean you should arm yourself with at least a Wi-Fi 6 modem, or to futureproof yourself even more, Wi-Fi 7. Both of these Wi-Fi technologies are able to support greater overall bandwidth compared to Wi-Fi 5 routers, and much faster download speeds than Wi-Fi 4 routers. It should be stressed that an older Wi-Fi 4 router will likely struggle to provide the full bandwidth of an NBN 500 plan, so if you\u2019re using an aging router on this plan, consider upgrading it.\nA Wi-Fi 5 router is theoretically fast enough for up to an NBN 1000 plan in a perfect environment, but few of us live in one. So, to compensate for potential interference (like walls or other nearby routers) and the natural drop in speed that happens as you get further away from your router, it\u2019s wise to upgrade to a model that will provide significantly more overall bandwidth than your NBN connection itself offers.\nConsidering more and more connected devices now integrate at least Wi-Fi 6, opting for a router that can match them is a good place to start.\nFor more information regarding routers and the NBN speed upgrades, be sure to read our in-depth guide.\nWhat NBN plan should I get before the upgrades?\nIf all this talk about NBN speed upgrades has you giddy with excitement, but you're not yet on an eligible plan to take advantage of them \u2013 or if you simply want to get faster internet today \u2013 the good news is a few providers jumped the gun incredibly early, meaning you can actually sign up for an NBN 500 or NBN 750 plan ahead of time.\nExetel One | 500Mbps | AU$80p/m\nExetel was one of the first to market with an NBN 500 plan and, on paper at least, it's a doozy. You're promised the full 500Mbps during the busier evening hours, along with some added perks such as boosting the speed and dropping the cost a little when you're away from home. It's also highly affordable, costing less than some plans that are 20x slower!\n\u2022 AU$80 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$960 yearly cost\nSpintel | 750Mbps | AU$80p/m (first 6 months, then AU$90.95p/m)\nSpintel's NBN 750 plan used to be its gigabit plan, but considering the fact it maxes out at 750Mbps, we're now calling moving it down a category. It's remarkable value, costing the same as the slightly slower Exetel plan above for the first 6 months. The ongoing cost is still competitively priced, undercutting slightly faster NBN 1000 plans.\n\u2022 AU$80 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,025.70 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,091.40 ongoing yearly cost\nSuperloop | 860Mbps TES | AU$85p/m (first 6 months, then AU$109p/m)\nPromising some of the fastest speeds right now in Australia, this Superloop NBN 1000 has been a favourite of ours for some time. And the good news is, it's especially affordable, with AU$144 in total savings over the first half-year. While the 860Mbps typical evening speed claim is already higher than the promised upgrade in September, there's a chance you'll be able to achieve closer to gigabit speeds when the upgrades roll out.\n\u2022 Total minimum cost: AU$85\n\u2022 First year cost: AU$1,164\n\u2022 Ongoing yearly cost: AU$1,308\n\u2022 View more of the best NBN 1000 plans\nYou might also like\n- View our current pick of the best NBN plans\n- Find out who we rate as the best NBN provider\n- Check out the best NBN 100 plans in line for the speed upgrade\nMax is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.

      "text": "Best NBN 100 plans: our top picks for fast 100Mbps internet\nThe best NBN 100 plans are perhaps the most appealing in Australia thanks to their availability, speed and good overall value.\nThose latter two points are both set for an upgrade in September, as NBN Co has confirmed households with an eligible connection type will receive a 5x speed boost, transforming these into NBN 500 plans with 500Mbps theoretical maximum download speeds in the process.\nThe incoming change could well mean that NBN 100 plans become increasingly more popular, as not only will they deliver much, much faster download speeds, but they should do so for free. We've already claimed we envisage them to offer the best overall value amongst the best NBN plans, and following the early arrival of a couple of 500Mbps options from Exetel and Spintel, we're sticking to that claim.\nIf you don't have the required connection type (FTTP or HFC) to support the faster speeds, then you may want to see if you're eligible for the free fibre upgrade. If you're not, perhaps you live in an apartment building, then an NBN 100 plan is the fastest available for you. And that means you're on the perfect page to help you discover a better option for your home.\nBest NBN 100 plans\nConsidering the majority of the best NBN providers claim to deliver the maximum plan speeds of this tier \u2013 100Mbps \u2013 shortlisting the best plans requires a little extra digging. Fortunately, we know what to look for, so you'll find our top recommendations below.\nBest overall NBN 100 plan\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nSpintel Home Fast | 100Mbps | AU$68p/m (first 6 months, then AU$86.95p/m)\nSpintel continues to be our pick for the best NBN 100 plan for most people, as it advertises maximum plan speeds and it was recently awarded Australia's Best Broadband Provider by Mozo. Spintel is also one of our favourite providers here at TechRadar, as it provides a generally favourable and reliable service. It's an affordable service too, beaten only by Kogan Internet, which we've listed further down.\n\u2022 AU$68 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$929.70.70 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,043.40 ongoing cost\nBest fast NBN 100 plan\nSuperloop Family | 100mbps | AU$75p/m (first 6 months, then AU$95p/m)\nWe've selected Superloop has the best fast NBN 100 plan, owing to the fact it grants customers the ability to boost the speed of their service to the next available tier \u2013 NBN 250 \u2013 for free, five times a month. It's a great way to see if you could benefit from an even faster connection, although do note, it's only available to customers who connect to the fixed-line NBN via FTTP or HFC connection types.\n\u2022 AU$75 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,020 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,140 ongoing cost\nCheapest NBN 100 plan\nKogan Internet | 100Mbps | AU$67.90p/m (first 6 months, then AU$85.90p/m)\nKogan Internet's plan is currently the cheapest option amongst the providers we monitor, despite a recent price increase of a couple of dollars. Despite that, it's the most affordable provider in the first year of service and only beaten in ongoing yearly cost by Flip. However, if you have an FTTP or HFC connection at home, you can get a 5x speed boost with the Exetel One plan, for only a little extra in the first year compared to Kogan, and for much less during each ongoing year.\n\u2022 AU$67.90 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$922.80 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,030.80 ongoing yearly cost\nBest NBN 100/40 plan\nAll of the plans above are known as NBN 100/20 plans, with the 20 indicating the maximum upload speed you can achieve. An NBN 100/40 plan, therefore, doubles the maximum possible upload speed to 40Mbps, which is ideal for people who carry out a lot of video calls, or need to upload larger files to the cloud.\nNot every provider offers an NBN 100/40 plan, however, so we've chosen just one plan that we recommend.\nSuperloop | 100/34Mbps | AU$85p/m (first 6 months, then AU$99p/m)\nSuperloop is still our pick for anyone wanting to maximise upload speeds with their NBN 100 plan. Only a handful of providers offer this speed tier, and Superloop is the cheapest. Not only does it claim a speedy 34Mbps upload speed during the busier evening hours, but it's also eligible for the Speed Boost feature that will increase your downloads, too.\n\u2022 AU$85 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,104 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,188 ongoing yearly cost\n- Telstra vs Optus NBN: who has better broadband?\nNBN 100 FAQ\nHow fast is NBN 100?\nNBN 100 plans offer download speeds up to 100Mbps, although actual usage will vary, particularly during the busy hours between 7pm and 11pm. Most NBN providers who offer a plan on this tier don\u2019t report a typical evening speed of 100Mbps, with the average speed sitting at 97Mbps.\nThere are two types of NBN 100 plan, and what differs between them is their maximum upload speed. The more popular NBN 100/20 plan offers maximum uploads of 20Mbps, while the less common NBN 100/40 plan has a maximum upload speed of 40Mbps.\nNBN providers don\u2019t always disclose which of these two plans you\u2019re signing up for, so check the provider\u2019s critical information summary if you\u2019re unsure. In the meantime, the ACCC is pushing for internet providers to be more transparent about upload speeds.\nHow much does NBN 100 cost?\nThe market has plenty of variety when it comes to cost for an NBN 100 plan. Prices now range between AU$84 to AU$113 a month for an ongoing rate, but the average monthly price among the NBN 100/20 plans we monitor is just under AU$95 a month, while an NBN 100/40 plan will set you back just over AU$107 a month on average.\nPlenty of telcos will also offer you a six-month discount when you first sign up to an NBN 100 plan, and these prices start around the AU$65 mark.\nAs you might expect, the telco with the most expensive NBN 100 plans is Telstra. You\u2019ll typically find that Telstra sweetens the deal by offering other inclusions or discounts, such as a modem with 4G back up.\nCan I get NBN 100?\nWhile all connection types can sign up for an NBN 100 plan, not all of them may be capable of getting the full speeds offered by the service. Before signing up with a provider, it's worth double checking what connection type you have \u2013 such as hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) cable or a fibre-to-the-node (FTTN) connection \u2013 and asking the telco if it\u2019ll be suitable for the speed tier.\nTo check what NBN connection type you have, you only need to enter your address on the provider\u2019s website, or check your address on NBN Co\u2019s website. Some providers offer a trial period to test their service, so be sure to make use of this if it\u2019s an option, and let them know if you\u2019re unsatisfied with the speeds you\u2019re receiving. We have a dedicated guide on how to do an NBN speed test if you need.\nWhen are NBN 100 plans getting a speed upgrade?\nA series of NBN speed upgrades are arriving in September 2025, which will see NBN 100 plans receive a 5x speed boost to a theoretical maximum of 500Mbps download speeds. This speed boost should arrive for free, but will only be available to customers who connect to the fixed-line NBN network via a FTTP or HFC connection.\nNBN 50 vs NBN 100?\nAs with any purchasing decision, the 'better' option won\u2019t be better for everyone. For light internet users \u2013 that\u2019s households of two to four users that stream content and don\u2019t plan to use it for anything more intensive \u2013 an NBN 50 plan is likely to be more than enough.\nBut for anyone currently running into congestion problems, or anyone that wants their download wait time drastically cut down, the extra AU$200 or so per year is certainly a small price to pay for double the download speeds \u2013 particularly in the context of a plan that already costs around AU$750 annually, in the case of NBN 50 plans.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMax is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.

      "text": "If you need another reason to sign up, Superloop NBN just won a coveted Ookla Speedtest award\nOur favourite gigabit NBN provider just got the gong for having Australia\u2019s fastest fixed network\nWhen you\u2019re searching for a new NBN plan, ensuring you\u2019re going to get the fastest possible download speeds is going to be a major deciding factor for most people. It makes sense: if you\u2019re paying for a service, you want to get what you pay for.\nWell, popular internet-testing service Ookla Speedtest just made it clear which NBN provider has the fastest fixed network of H1 2025, with the award going to Superloop.\nTo decide which provider could be deemed the fastest fixed network, Ookla didn\u2019t simply just close its eyes and throw a dart at a dartboard. Instead, it analysed the results of over 18 million consumer initiated Speedtest results across 2.4 million users during Q1 and Q2 of 2025, focusing on major NBN providers.\nFollowing its analysis, Ookla awarded Superloop as the Fastest Fixed Network in Australia of H1 2025, with users on its speediest plans experiencing the highest average download speeds of 768.77Mbps.\nProviders weren\u2019t just measured on download speed though: Ookla calculates its own aggregate \u2018Speed Score\u2019 metric to compare different providers, which it says \u201cuses data from various metrics, including 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of download and upload throughput and loaded latency. It combines to give an overall view of network performance\u201d. Based on that combination, Superloop came out in front with a final Speed Score of 63.32 \u2013 around 8 points ahead of the runner up.\nSuperloop\u2019s download speed result of 768.77Mbps is also significantly ahead of the next nearest provider (11.2% to be specific) and roughly doubles or even triples the numbers for some of Australia's biggest internet providers. You can find out more about Ookla specific tests and findings here.\nIt\u2019s a great achievement for the Australian-owned telco, and perfectly timed with the incoming arrival of the September NBN speed upgrades. We already regularly rate Superloop highly in our guide to the fastest NBN plans, with its gigabit NBN 1000 plan being a particular highlight \u2013 not only for the speeds it claims to provide, but for the incredible value on offer too.\nComing in at just AU$85p/m for the first six months, before increasing to a still-competitive AU$109p/m ongoing, Superloop\u2019s Lightspeed 1Gbps plan represents one of the most cost-effective routes to blazing-fast download speeds.\nSuperloop Lightspeed NBN | 860Mbps (TES) | AU$85p/m (first 6 months, then AU$109p/m\nSuperloop\u2019s gigabit NBN plan gives you 860Mbps download speeds during the busier evening hours and, as evidenced by those Ookla test results, you are likely to achieve them. Do note that you will need a fibre to the premises (FTTP) or hybrid fibre coax (HFC) connection in order to support these speeds.\n\u2022 AU$85 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$$1,164.00 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,308.00 ongoing yearly cost\nSuperloop is a TechRadar preferred partner (What does that mean?)\nMax is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.

      "text": "NBN 2000 plans: all your questions about the upcoming Hyperfast internet tier answered\nRoughly a year since it was first teased and seven months since they were confirmed, we\u2019re now approximately three months away from the rollout of new NBN 2000 plans.\nSet to launch officially on September 14, the new NBN 2000 plans \u2013 appropriately dubbed \u2018Hyperfast\u2019 \u2013 will offer homes and businesses connected via fibre to the premises (FTTP) or hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) the chance to double the maximum download speeds currently available.\nOn paper at least, they're going to be strong contenders for the top spot in our guide to the fastest NBN plans.\nBut how fast exactly will NBN 2000 plans be and, more importantly, how much will they cost? While specific details are relatively thin on the ground right now, we\u2019ve sifted through everything NBN Co has said so far to answer the key questions about the upcoming tier. Read on to find out all there is to know about NBN 2000 plans.\nWhen will NBN 2000 plans be available?\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nNBN Co has said NBN 2000 plans will be available from September 14, 2025. However, it adds that this is the date the new plans will be available for retail service providers (RSPs) to purchase, that are then sold to customers. With this in mind, it means that you may not be available to sign-up for an NBN 2000 plan until some time after, so we imagine they\u2019ll be more broadly available to consumers and businesses from around the beginning of October.\nWe will of course be keeping our eyes peeled for when the new plans become available and will update this page as soon as we know more.\nHow fast will NBN 2000 plans be?\nAs the name implies, NBN 2000 plans will offer theoretical maximum download speeds of 2,000Mbps (or 2Gbps) \u2013 double that of the current theoretical maximum of the best NBN 1000 plans.\nUpload speeds will also get a major speed increase to a maximum of 200Mbps (compared to the 50Mbps maximum on NBN 1000 plans) although this will only be available to customers connected via FTTP. Customers connected via HFC will only be able to achieve a maximum upload speed figure of 100Mbps, or half that of full fibre.\nAs with all of the best NBN plans, the 2,000Mbps figure is just the theoretical maximum available, which is often different to the typical evening speed figure achievable in the real world. For example, the maximum typical evening speed figure we\u2019ve seen for NBN 1000 plans is 900Mbps from Flip and Swoop.\nThis means customers are unlikely to achieve 2,000Mbps download speeds, although by how much is currently anyone\u2019s guess.\nHow much will NBN 2000 plans cost?\nThe quick answer is, we don\u2019t know. However, we do know that the wholesale cost NBN Co will charge service providers is AU$115 per month, so we can expect the final retail cost to customers to be higher. Of course, how much higher will depend on the provider, as we already see a great variance between providers on other speed tiers.\nAs an example, the cheapest regular monthly cost for an NBN 1000 plan is AU$90 from Spintel, while the most expensive is AU$150 per month from Telstra, a difference of AU$60 p/m. For greater context, the current wholesale cost of an NBN 1000 plan to ISPs is AU$72.22, so it\u2019s clear different providers choose to mark up their plans differently.\nTaking this into account, an NBN 2000 plan could therefore cost anywhere from AU$150 p/m to AU$200 p/m or more. We\u2019ll update this page with details of specific plans and prices as soon as we spot them.\nWhat equipment do I need for an NBN 2000 plan?\nWhether you already connect to the fixed-line NBN network via FTTP or you're on one of the inferior FTTN/C connection types, you'll need new equipment if you want to sign up for a new NBN 2000 plan.\nNBN Co has confirmed that a new connection box is coming and, interpreting its wording, will become the new default connection box for anyone upgrading to FTTP, regardless of the plan speed they opt for.\nNot only will the new connection box support the multi-gigabit NBN 2000 plans, but it also now features just a single port, as opposed to the four-port design of the current connection box. In the majority of cases, homes connected via FTTP will likely only use just one port, which is the reason for this design change.\nNew four-port connection boxes will also be available for homes that need them, but details regarding the logistics of how you go about obtaining one are thin on the ground right now.\nShould I get an NBN 2000 plan?\nThat all depends on the needs of your household and, as mentioned, NBN 2000 plans will only be available to customers who connect to the NBN via FTTP or HFC infrastructure. In 2025 that's less of a barrier than it was in previous years. If your premises don\u2019t currently use either of these technology types, and you instead connect via fibre to the node (FTTN) or fibre to the curb (FTTC), you'll likely be eligible to take advantage of NBN Co\u2019s free NBN fibre upgrade program.\nBut wait, there\u2019s some other good news to coincide with the launch of the new multi-gigabit plans. The current crop of higher speed NBN plans (so NBN 100 and faster) are set to receive a speed boost and should, in theory, remain free of any price increases since NBN Co\u2019s wholesale costs aren\u2019t expected to rise too much at the turn of the new financial year.\nWhile those speed increases won\u2019t be coming to the best NBN 25 plans or best NBN 50 plans, the best NBN 100 plans, best NBN 250 plans and best NBN 1000 plans should all be automatically upgraded. NBN 1000 plans will get a guaranteed minimum speed increase to 750Mbps, up from the current 500Mbps, while NBN 100 plans will see the maximum download speed increase to 500Mbps, and customers on an NBN 250 plan will get a speed bump to 750Mbps maximum.\nSo, by the time they're rolled out, the answer to the question \u201cdo I need an NBN 2000 plan?\u201d, might actually be no. The 5x speed increase on an NBN 100 plan could be all your household needs to ensure all your connected devices run smoothly. Do note, however, that you will still need a FTTP or HFC connection to receive these increases. To check what connection you have, you can head to NBN Co\u2019s website.\nWhat NBN plan is best to get now?\nIf you\u2019re keen to change your NBN plan today, the good news is that gigabit NBN plans have never been cheaper, with plans now starting at just AU$90 p/m. Alternatively, if you feel that 1,000Mbps speeds will be overkill for your home, there are a number of great-value 100Mbps plans also available.\nYou can view our expert picks for each speed tier below.\nSpintel | 100Mbps | AU$65p/m (first 6 months, then AU$81.95p/m)\nSpintel is currently our favourite provider for an NBN 100 plan thanks to its low introductory cost and the cheapest ongoing cost of any provider we monitor. In fact, it's the only provider to come in under AU$1,000 a year after the introductory discount ends.\n\u2022 AU$65 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$881.70 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$983.40 ongoing yearly cost\nSpintel is also our favourite when it comes to choosing an NBN 250 plan. Once again, cost is the key factor here, with the telco now charging a flat fee for the life of the plan. At AU$80 p/m, it's the outright cheapest of any provider by at least AU$15 each month. This plan doesn't quote maximum typical evening speeds, but in our opinion the 10Mbps drop is outweighed by the seriously cheap price.\n\u2022 AU$80 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$960 yearly cost\nFinally, Spintel once again takes the crown for the NBN 1000 tier and again, it's largely because of price. As with the 250Mbps tier, Spintel isn't offering an introductory discount here and instead simply charges a flat fee of just AU$90 p/m, which is exceptional value. Not only does this make it almost AU$800 cheaper per year than Telstra's (slower) NBN 1000 plan, it's actually just AU$1 more per month that Telstra's NBN 25 plan. What\u2019s more, Spintel claims 750Mbps typical evening speeds, which while not the fastest, should be plenty fast enough for most customers.\n\u2022 AU$90 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,080 yearly cost\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMax is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.

      "text": "Fastest NBN plans: 100Mbps, 250Mbps, 500Mbps and 1,000Mbps internet plans compared\nIf you're looking to improve your download speeds at home, these are the plans we can't get enough of\nThe fastest NBN plans \u2013 those that deliver download speeds of 100Mbps of faster \u2013 are ideal for larger households, gamers who need to download large files or anyone who loves to stream 4K UHD movies from the best streaming services.\nFor a long time, there were just three speed tiers available to households classed as high-speed NBN plans. However, from September 14, 2025, NBN Co is introducing new speed tiers, comprising speed boosts to current plans and a new tier known as NBN 2000.\nThe speed boosts will affect NBN 100 plans and NBN 250 plans, which will get a 5x and 3x increase, respectively. While not officially confirmed, we're tentatively calling these NBN 500 plans and NBN 750 plans. Anyone currently signed up for an NBN 100 or NBN 250 plan and with an FTTP or HFC connection at home, should receive the speed upgrade at no extra cost.\nSome providers have already jumped the gun and launched these boosted plans, including Exetel, Spintel and Tangerine. They've been able to do so as a result of provisioning faster speeds or, in Exetel's case, scrapping all other plans entirely, leaving the telco with just the single, low-cost option.\nSo, if you're ready to upgrade your home internet and experience faster downloads, read on to discover our top recommendations.\nJump to:\n\u2022 Fastest NBN 100 plan \u2013 AU$75p/m from Superloop (first 6m, then AU$95p/m)\n\u2022 Fastest NBN 250 plan \u2013 AU$85p/m from Superloop (first 6m, then AU$99p/m)\n\u2022 Fastest NBN 500 plan \u2013 AU$80p/m from Exetel\n\u2022 Fastest NBN 1000 plan \u2013 AU$94p/m from Flip (first 4 months, then AU$104.90p/m)\nCan you get NBN 250, NBN 500 or NBN 1000?\nNot everybody will be able to sign up for a fast NBN plan. The high-speed tiers are only available on two types of NBN connection \u2013 fibre to the premises (FTTP) and hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC). If your household is serviced by an FTTP or HFC installation, you should be able to sign up to an NBN 250, NBN 500 or NBN 1000 plan.\nIt's this connection type that will also be required to service the incoming NBN 750 and NBN 2000 plans.\nAll NBN connection types should be able to support 100Mbps speeds, but if you want to be sure, then you'll want to see if you can get a free fibre upgrade and have FTTP technology installed at your premises.\nNoteworthy fast NBN deals\nBelow we\u2019ll run through our top plan picks, but first, check out these ace offers currently available on fast NBN plans:\n- Dodo: lowest introductory cost on NBN 100 plan \u2013 AU$62.99p/m\n- Spintel: Great value NBN 500 plan from just AU$74p/m\n- Buddy Telco: NBN 1000 for just AU$99p/m\nFastest NBN plans\nFastest NBN 100 plan\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nOur choice for large households and those who want a little extra speed\n\u2022 NBN 100 plans are the most broadly available fast plans, with the telcos reporting a typical evening speed of 97Mbps on average.\nSuperloop Family | 100Mbps | AU$75p/m (first 6 months, then AU$95p/m)\nNow, this Superloop plan isn't the most affordable NBN 100 option, but we've selected it because it includes a Speed Boost feature, which lets you temporarily boost the download speed of your plan to the next tier up \u2013 NBN 250. It's for this reason we've selected it when discussing the fastest NBN plans, as it offers the potential to go faster than other providers. You will need an FTTP or HFC connection to activate the speed boost, however.\n\u2022 AU$75 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,020 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,140 ongoing yearly cost\n\u2022 See more: Best NBN 100 plans\nFastest NBN 250 plan\nThe go-to for lightning-quick broadband\n\u2022 The availability of NBN 250 plans is now almost on par with that of NBN 100, with telcos reporting a typical evening speed of 237Mbps on average.\nSince we first created this guide to the fastest NBN plans, the number of internet service providers quoting close-to maximum typical evening speeds on the NBN 250 speed tier has increased considerably, creating greater competition in the process.\nTelstra and AGL plans are on the more expensive side, and Southern Phone has such bad reviews online that we feel we can't recommend it. We've therefore looked at the remaining NBN providers and taken into account other factors they offer to settle on an overall pick.\nSuperloop Superfast Plus | 250Mbps | AU$85p/m (first 6 months, then AU$99p/m)\nSuperloop has been a firm favourite of ours for some time and now has two 250Mbps plan options available with a couple of key differences. The Superfast Plus plan we've selected gets you 250Mbps speeds and up to 100Mbps uploads (85Mbps typical evening speeds). Interestingly (and the reason why we've chosen it) is that it's cheaper than the Superfast plan. This second option drops the uploads to a maximum of 25Mbps but it's eligible for the Speed Boost feature, which lets you temporarily increase your speeds to the NBN 1000 tier, for free, five times a month. You can view both plans and weigh up your options via the same link.\n\u2022 AU$85 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,104 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,188 ongoing yearly cost\n\u2022 View more of the best NBN 250 plans\nFastest NBN 500 plan\nThe NBN 500 tier is brand new and has been slated to effectively replace NBN 100 plans with a free 5x speed boost from September (only for customers via a FTTP or HFC connection).\nHowever, as of July 1, a couple of providers have flicked the switch early and dropped their own NBN 500 plans, with incredibly competitive pricing to boot.\nExetel One | 500Mbps | AU$80p/m\nExetel's NBN 500 plan is, on paper at least, exceptional value. For just AU$80p/m (AU$13p/m cheaper than Telstra's 25Mbps plan) you can revel in truly glorious speeds of up to 500Mbps download and 50Mbps uploads. It's the only plan the telco now offers, so if you've got the right connection type, it's undoubtedly one of the best fast NBN plans to get right now. There are other perks too, such as the ability to boost the speed to the next tier up and even save AU$1 a day to downgrade the speed to 12Mbps, ideal if you're away from home for a long time.\n\u2022 AU$80 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$960 yearly cost\nSpintel Home Turbo | 500Mbps | AU$84p/m\nSpintel has also surprised us with a 500Mbps NBN plan of its own, advertising the same typical evening speeds as Exetel (500/42Mbps) and a similarly low cost of just AU$84p/m. There's no immediate sign of any extra perks, however, so ultimately the Exetel One plan is our top pick, but if you've been a Spintel customer previously, you may wish to stay loyal.\n\u2022 AU$84 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,008 yearly cost\nFastest NBN 1000 plan\nThe fastest you can get, but only available in select locations\n\u2022 The once sparse NBN 1000 tier is growing in availability, with an average typical evening speed of 795Mbps reported by the telcos.\nFlip | 900Mbps | AU$94p/m (first 4 months, then AU$104.90p/m)\nFlip continues to be our pick for the best fast NBN 1000 plan overall, due to it currently advertising the fastest typical evening speeds of any provider we monitor at 900Mbps. While it's not the cheapest, it's by no means the most expensive, and in reality, it presents as great value. For a cheap NBN 1000 plan, we recommend Buddy.\n\u2022 AU$94 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$1,215.20 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,258.80 ongoing yearly cost\n\u2022 See more: Best NBN 1000 plans\nFast NBN plans: major telcos\nWhen it comes to the big three internet providers, these are the best fast plans available:\nOptus' best high-speed NBN plans\nOptus has recently removed the NBN 250 tier from its line up, and has also done away with introductory discounts. Instead, in order to make a saving on an NBN plan, you can add a second Optus service, such as a SIM plan, and save AU$15 a month for a full year.\nTPG's best high-speed NBN plans\n- NBN 100 (100Mbps): AU$64.99p/m (first 6 months, then AU$94.99p/m)\n- NBN 250 (250Mbps): AU$79.99p/m (first 6 months, then AU$99.99p/m)\n- NBN 1000 (800Mbps): AU$89.99p/m (first 6 months, then AU$109.99p/m)\nTelstra's best high-speed NBN plans\n- Telstra vs Optus NBN: who has better broadband?\nFast NBN FAQ\nWhat are NBN 1000 real world speeds?\nThe Australian Competition & Consumer Commission conducts quarterly reports focusing on the broadband performance in Australia. Its latest report, published in June 2025, found the average download speed ranged across the day from 870 Mbps to 885Mbps.\nThese are undeniably fast, but still a little way off the theoretical top speed available on these plans of 1,000Mbps. Outside of the peak busy period, we\u2019ve seen real-world speed test results that are much higher at 900Mbps, though still not reaching the maximum amount.\nWhat are NBN 250 real world speeds?\nThe second-fastest tier is NBN 250, which the NBN Co refers to as 'Superfast'. The amount of providers which offer an NBN 250 plan has grown significantly and it\u2019s now almost on par with the number which offer NBN 100 plans. Among the telcos we monitor, the average download speed on these plans is 235Mbps during the evening hours. Actual speed does vary among the internet providers with NBN 250 plans, so be sure to read the fine print.\nWhat are NBN 100 real world speeds?\nThe NBN 100 tier is the most affordable option from the fastest NBN category, and you can expect a typical evening speed of 98Mbps on average. While the tiers mentioned above are leaps and bounds ahead in terms of speed, they are also limited in their availability \u2013 only FTTP and HFC connections can sign up to NBN 1000 and NBN 250 in most cases.\nNBN 100 is referred to as 'Fast' by the NBN Co \u2013 it\u2019s available for most connection types, and is often the fastest option available for the millions of Australians using fibre-to-the-node (FTTN) technology.\nYou can read more about each connection type in our guide to the best NBN plans.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMax is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.

      "text": "Best NBN 500 plans: jump the queue with these expert-rated picks\nBuckle up, folks \u2013 we\u2019re now less than a month away from one of the biggest shake-ups to the NBN in years, which will see the introduction of all-new NBN 500 plans.\nThe new tier is set to officially arrive in September as a speed upgrade to the current NBN 100 plans, and as the name suggests, should offer theoretical maximum download speeds of 500Mbps. The better news is that eligible customers currently signed up to an NBN 100 plan should receive the upgrade for free.\nThere are some caveats, however. Firstly, in order to sign up for an NBN 500 plan, you'll need to connect to the fixed-line NBN network via a fibre to the premises (FTTP) or hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) connection, as only these two utilise the necessary technology to support the faster speeds. Now would be a great time to check to see if you're eligible for the free NBN fibre upgrade.\nSecondly, while we say current NBN 100 customers should receive the upgrade for free (those with the aforementioned connection type) we have seen some providers, such as Spintel, offering an NBN 500 plan for less than its 100Mbps option, so you may find switching to a different plan is the best course of action. We expect most providers will continue to offer 100Mbps plans for customers without the required connection type.\nWhile NBN 500 plans don't officially launch until September, some providers have dropped their plans early, and we've compared them all below.\nBest NBN 500 plans\nBest overall\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nExetel One | 500Mbps | AU$80p/m\nWe rate Exetel's NBN 500 plan as the best option for anyone wanting to experience the faster speeds right now. The telco has scrapped all other plan options, leaving just the single plan you see here. In doing so, it's enabled Exetel to be incredibly competitively priced. Promising download speeds of up to 500Mbps (even during the busier evening hours) and speedy uploads of up to 50Mbps, it offers homes a great balance of speed and price. Whether you want to stream to multiple devices without interruption or download large game files, the Exetel One plan is one to consider.\n\u2022 AU$80 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$960 yearly cost\nCheapest first-year cost\nTangerine Speedy Max | 700Mbps TES until 14/09/25 | AU$68.90p/m (first 6 months, then AU$88.90p/m)\nTangerine's plan is an interesting proposition, with a couple of things to note. Firstly, it's technically a gigabit plan at the moment, but will migrate to an NBN 500 plan on September 15th. Until then, you're promised 700Mbps typical evening speeds, making this is a great one to take advantage of. Fast speeds for a low introductory cost makes for great value in our opinion.\n\u2022 AU$68.90 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$946.80 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,066.80 ongoing yearly cost\nFan-favourite provider\nSpintel Home Turbo | 500Mbps | AU$74p/m (first 6 months, then AU$84.95p/m)\nSpintel's NBN 500 plan is an equally compelling option, claiming maximum download speeds during the busier evening hours, and an attractive introductory cost. The first year cost is slightly less than the Exetel plan above, but the ongoing cost will set you back around AU$60 more. There aren't any extra features with Spintel's option either, so you'll want to weigh up what's most important to you before signing up.\n\u2022 AU$74 minimum cost\n\u2022 AU$953.70 first year cost\n\u2022 AU$1,019.60 ongoing yearly cost\nNBN 500 FAQ\nHow fast will NBN 500 plans be?\nAs is the case with all speed tier naming conventions, NBN 500 plans will offer a theoretical maximum download speed of 500Mbps \u2013 five times the current maximum of the NBN 100 plans they\u2019ll replace. Upload speeds will also increase from the current maximum of 20Mbps to 50Mbps.\nIndeed, both Exetel and Spintel claim 500Mbps typical evening speeds on their respective plans, which, considering some providers of slower plans don't even promise maximum speeds, is exceptional.\nAs with all fixed-line NBN speeds over 100Mbps, NBN 500 plans will only be available to customers who connect to the network via a fibre to the premises (FTTP) or hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) connection. If you currently connect via fibre to the node (FTTN) or fibre to the curb (FTTC), then you won\u2019t have the technology to support the faster speeds.\nIf you\u2019re not sure what connection type you have at home, you can use NBN Co\u2019s address checker. If you find you do connect via either of the inferior technologies (FTTN/C), then you may be eligible for NBN Co\u2019s free fibre upgrade program, which provides a full fibre FTTP installation at your address.\nIf your home isn\u2019t currently in an eligible upgrade location, or you choose not to upgrade, then following the introduction of the new tiers, you\u2019ll likely still see NBN 100 as your fastest possible option and not NBN 500. If you can take advantage of the upgrade as soon as possible, you\u2019ll be in the best position come September when the increased speeds take effect.\nHow much will NBN 500 plans cost?\nAside from the major speed increase, the best part of the proposed speed upgrade is that it should, in theory, not cost you extra each month.\nWe say \u2018in theory\u2019 because, while NBN Co has said the extra speed benefits will be made available at no additional wholesale cost, RSPs will still be free to price them as they see fit.\nAs you can see from the plans above, however, they represent exceptional value. Consider the fact all three cost less than some NBN 25 plans that are 20x slower (looking at you, Telstra) and an NBN 500 plan makes for a compelling option.\nWe\u2019ll be keeping our eyes peeled for any new NBN 500 plans as soon as they hit the market, so we can then formulate a more concrete idea of which offer the best value.\nShould I get an NBN 500 plan?\nIn some ways, this is a tricky question to answer. If you\u2019re already signed up to an NBN 100 plan and you connect via FTTP or HFC, then in theory you\u2019ll automatically be moved over to an NBN 500 plan at no extra cost.\nHowever, there\u2019s a strong case to be made for everyone else \u2013 even those who are signed up to one of the best NBN 1000 plans \u2013 to switch to a NBN 500 plan once they\u2019ve launched. This is because we believe the combination of fast speeds (500Mbps should service the majority of Australian homes more than adequately) and the great value already offered by NBN 100 plans (which generally cost less than AU$10 p/m more than slower NBN 50 plans), makes for a potent combination.\nWe\u2019d even go as far as saying we reckon they could become the most popular NBN plan of them all \u2013 a position currently held by NBN 50 plans, which make up around two-thirds of fixed-line NBN subscriptions at the time of writing.\nIf you\u2019re currently signed up to one of the best NBN 250 plans, then you will also receive a speed increase to a 750Mbps NBN 750 plan. If you think this might be a bit of overkill, then dropping down to an NBN 500 plan will likely save you some money \u2013 depending on the provider you choose, of course.\nOn the other hand, if you're happy to wait, this NBN 100 plan from Mate is also a great option, and it should see an upgrade to NBN 500 later this year.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMax is a senior staff writer for TechRadar who covers home entertainment and audio first, NBN second and virtually anything else that falls under the consumer electronics umbrella third.

  "argos_summary": "Australia's NBN Co is rolling out speed upgrades on September 14, 2025, boosting NBN 100 plans to 500Mbps and NBN 250 to 750Mbps, with a new NBN 2000 tier at 2Gbps. Early adopters like Exetel, Spintel, and Tangerine are already offering NBN 500 plans at low cost, while customers with FTTP or HFC connections can upgrade for free. The upgrade will require compatible routers (Wi\u2011Fi 6 or higher) to fully utilize the new speeds. Providers may adjust pricing, but wholesale costs are unchanged, suggesting minimal price impact for consumers.",
