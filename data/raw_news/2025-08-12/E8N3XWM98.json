  "content": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia \u2014 Sonic Incytes Medical Corp, proudly announces that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted 510(k) clearance for Velacur ONE\u2122, its point-of-care ultrasound elastography device. Building on the success of its original model, Velacur\u2122, Velacur ONE\u2122 introduces an enhanced interface and features for improved portability and user experience. These improvements enable broader scalability to support Sonic Incytes\u2019 accelerated US and global expansion strategy. Velacur ONE\u2122 measures attenuation, VDFF (Velacur Determined-Fat Fraction), and liver stiffness using 3D S-WAVE and aids in the management of chronic liver disease including MASH and MASLD.\n\nVelacur ONE\u2122 arrives at a critical time for improved non-invasive testing, following the recent FDA clearance of Rezdiffra\u2014the first therapeutic for Metabolic dysfunction\u2013associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a progressive and often underdiagnosed liver disease. In the U.S. alone, an estimated 100 million adults have Metabolic dysfunction\u2013associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)1, with 15\u201320 million of those affected by MASH2. Yet, 90% of MASH cases remain undiagnosed3. If left untreated, worsening MASH increases morbidity and may progress to severe complications, including cirrhosis, liver failure, liver cancer, and liver transplant4,5. MASH remains challenging to diagnose effectively due to the limitations of existing non-invasive methods, especially those available at the point-of-care.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\nWith the first therapeutic now available and more in the pipeline, clinicians need improved non-invasive tests to diagnose and monitor MASH at point-of-care6. Current treatment guidelines for MASH recommend imaging-based elastography, such as Velacur\u2122, to assess liver scarring (fibrosis) and fat content (steatosis). While ultrasound elastography is widely used, when it comes to treating patients with MASH, liver stiffness alone cannot be relied on to assess treatment response in the short term7. The best predictor of treatment responses was a decrease in steatosis (identified as \u226530% reduction in MRI-PDFF)8.\n\nVDFF, Sonic Incytes\u2019 proprietary algorithm that received FDA clearance in 2024, demonstrates a strong correlation (r = 0.85) with MRI-PDFF\u2014the gold standard for liver fat measurement\u2014and achieves an outstanding accuracy (AUC) of 95% of patients with more than 5% MRI-PDFF, defining the presence of hepatic steatosis9. Velacur ONE\u2122 combines this technology with a refined user interface, including B-mode imaging\u2014enabling 3\u20134x higher reimbursement than non-imaging elastography\u2014and an AI-based organ overlay feature to aid in liver localization, making it the only point-of-care device that estimates both liver stiffness and attenuation that correlates to MRI-PDFF10.\n\n. \u201cThis next-generation device enhances clinical utility and operational scalability, positioning us to better support the growing demand for accessible, non-invasive liver diagnostics and treatment, particularly in the management of MASLD and MASH at the point-of-care.\n\nSonic Incytes is committed to enhancing patient care through innovative diagnostic solutions. The company\u2019s flagship product, Velacur\u2122, equips physicians with an advanced liver imaging tool to help manage the growing epidemic of fatty liver disease. Velacur\u2122 offers real-time, AI-guided quantification of the key markers for fatty liver disease: liver stiffness, attenuation and VDFF. With real-time results, a low up-front cost and AI guidance, Velacur\u2122 makes liver imaging at the point-of-care affordable and accessible.",
