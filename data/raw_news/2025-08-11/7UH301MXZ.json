  "title": "Emergency Sefton Council meeting calls rejected after disruption",
  "description": "Sefton Council's previous meeting ended last month with some items on the agenda left unresolved.",
  "content": "A council leader has rejected calls from opposition parties for a full emergency meeting despite the previous one being scrapped due to a protest. Labour-run Sefton Council's leader Marion Atkinson said an extra meeting was not needed, even though some items on the agenda at last month's meeting had been left unresolved. Police were called to Southport Town Hall on 10 July after reports of \"people shouting from the public gallery\". Sefton Mayor June Burns halted proceedings after one of the protestors shouted at a councillor to \"shut up\".\n\nOne of the decisions due to be taken at that meeting concerned plans for Southport's Town Hall Square and Gardens. Liberal Democrat group leader John Pugh requested an extraordinary meeting of the council to pick up issues which were not debated or agreed upon. He said they included money for pothole repairs, road resurfacing and funds for children with Special Educational Needs. The next full council meeting is scheduled for September.\n\n\"I cannot understand the logic of letting a disturbance in the public gallery lock up council business,\" said Pugh. He added that he found it \"baffling\" when he compared his life as the MP for Southport between 2001-2017 with life in the council chamber. \"During my time in the [House of] Commons I witnessed chemicals thrown into the chamber and terrorist attacks that cost lives, but the democratic process continued as normal. \"Sefton has keeled over because of a bit of shouting in the public gallery and let it mess up business as usual.\" Atkinson accused Pugh of \"petty political posturing\" and said the mayor's decision to halt the meeting on safety grounds had been \"sensible\". She said some of her female colleagues had faced misogynistic abuse from protestors. \"Aggressive and bullying behaviour must and will be met with a zero-tolerance approach,\" said Atkinson. She added that Pugh \"should not belittle the genuine fears that councillors and staff had about their safety, in addition to the fact children were also in the gallery on the night.\"",

      "text": "Council chaos delays Southport victims garden plan\n- Published\nPolice were called to a chaotic Sefton Council meeting that had to be abandoned after protestors began \"screaming and shouting\" at councillors.\nThe local authority was due to discuss plans for a major revamp of Southport's Town Hall gardens in memory of Elsie Dot Stancombe, Alice Aguiar and Bebe King, when the protest took place.\nIt began when a member of the public asked about whether the council had turned down any applications for 5G masts on health grounds, before descending into a row.\nThe Mayor of Sefton June Burns halted proceedings after one of the protestors shouted at a councillor to \"shut up\".\nPeople in the public gallery were asking questions about issues including immigration, net zero and 5G masts but became increasingly frustrated and vocal about the responses they were receiving.\nThe mayor adjourned the meeting on Thursday before much of the agenda could be discussed.\nThe meeting re-started to enable a group of teenagers to present a petition they had launched to get a BMX park built, but was then halted again and the police called.\nMembers of the public shouted \"shame on you\" and \"cowards\" as the councillors left the chamber at the meeting on Thursday night.\nOne of the protestors was heard making derogatory comments about a female councillor.\nThe meeting had to be abandoned before approval could be given to plans to create a new family-friendly space in the Town Hall gardens on Lord Street.\nEarlier this year, the families of the three young girls who were murdered in last summer's knife attacks secured funding from the combined authority and the government for the project.\n'Sad moment'\nMike Prendergast, leader of the Conservative opposition group, said: \"As an opposition councillor, I don't always like the answer that I am given but I don't scream and shout during the meeting to get my point across.\"\nHe said there \"has to be a process and a procedure and we want to get people more engaged in politics\" but what happened at the meeting \" isn't going to help with that\".\nPrendergast said: \"We wanted to ask questions on behalf of the people of Southport but that's now being delayed because a small number of people decided to take it upon themselves to decide that their opinions were more important than other people's.\"\nThe council's Liberal Democrat group issued a statement which said the suspension of the meeting marked a \"sad moment for local democracy\" in Sefton.\nIt said: \"Residents deserve and need to have their say but it has to be conducted in the right forum.\n\"Shouting from the gallery just throws meetings into disarray and means no one can be heard properly.\"\nSefton's next full council meeting will take place in September.\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover on Merseyside\nListen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, external, X, external, and Instagram, external.
