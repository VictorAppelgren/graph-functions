      "feedback": "**Actionable Edit Instructions (compact paragraph)**  \n1. **Embed precise numbers and inline citations**: Replace vague statements (“UAS jobs doubled”) with the exact figures from FOM34PUWA (712 → 1,400 jobs, $105,912 avg salary) and cite the ID. Do the same for the Russell 2000 valuation (lowest since 2008, % negative‑earning companies) and Vor Biopharma (Sharpe –0.1642, 12‑month target $0.40–$3.00, cite M2PF568NP). For dividends, list exact yields (Abbott 1.8%, AbbVie 3.2%, Pfizer 6.7%) and cite WISLWAJ15.  \n2. **Strengthen the causal chain with first‑principles logic**: Explicitly link BOJ’s “tight labor market” to wage‑driven inflation, to Fed/BOJ tightening, to risk‑premium compression, and to valuation compression across the market (cite A7VLN74BK). Show how UAS contract growth injects capital into small‑cap defense firms, creating a sector‑specific upside (cite FOM34PUWA). Contrast this with biotech volatility eroding risk‑premium compression (cite M2PF568NP).  \n3. **Define a clear 3–6‑month scenario structure**:  \n   - **Base case**: Russell 2000 up 10–15 % (Q7VVGNSQE), small‑cap UAS earnings +5–7 % (FOM34PUWA), dividend yields +3–5 % (WISLWAJ15), BOJ neutral (A7VLN74BK).  \n   - **Alt 1**: Small‑cap rally stalls, dividend yields flat, UAS growth falters → Russell 2000 down 5–10 % (FOM34PUWA, WISLWAJ15).  \n   - **Alt 2**: Fed rate hike + BOJ tightening → risk premium spikes, Russell 2000 down 10–20 % (A7VLN74BK).  \n4. **Specify timing windows and triggers**:  \n   - Fed minutes (Q4 2025) → potential rate cut or hike.  \n   - DoD UAS contract announcements (Q1 2026) → capital inflow to small caps.  \n   - Biotech earnings (Q2 2026) → risk‑premium shift.  \n   - Negative‑earning % in Russell 2000 (monthly) → sentiment gauge.  \n5. **Add a watch‑list section**: List the above triggers with clear “watch signals” and link each to the relevant source ID.  \n6. **Quantify confidence**: State a 70 % probability for the base case, justify with the convergence of macro, sector, and dividend data, and note that confidence is moderate‑high but contingent on the Fed’s stance.  \n7. **Improve coherence and depth**: Re‑order paragraphs to follow the causal chain, use bullet points for clarity, and avoid generic platitudes. Ensure every claim is backed by a source ID and that conflicting data (e.g., UAS data sparsity) is acknowledged and mitigated.  \n8. **Citation density**: Aim for at least one citation per sentence that contains a key fact or figure. Use the format (ID) immediately after the fact.  \nImplement these edits to elevate the analysis to world‑class quality, ensuring depth, precision, and actionable insight for a 3–6‑month horizon.",
