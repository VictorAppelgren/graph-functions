      "feedback": "**Feedback & Edit Instructions**\n\n1. **Causal Chain & Depth**  \n   - Tighten the narrative around the *direct* transmission from Fed policy to the 10‑year yield. Explicitly state: *Fed’s policy rate → 10‑year yield → equity risk‑premia* and quantify each leg (e.g., a 25 bp cut → 10‑20 bp drop in the 10‑year).  \n   - Add a short “scenario” table:  \n     | Scenario | Fed move | Yield change | Equity impact | Probability |  \n     |---|---|---|---|---|  \n     | Baseline | 25 bp cut | –15 bp | +1 % S&P | 70 % |  \n     | Upside | 50 bp cut | –30 bp | +2 % S&P | 20 % |  \n     | Downside | Hold/raise | +10 bp | –1 % S&P | 10 % |  \n\n2. **Quantification & Ranges**  \n   - Replace vague “10‑20 bps” with a range derived from recent Fed‑funds futures: *Fed‑funds futures imply a 25 bp cut will move the 10‑year down 12–18 bps; a 50 bp cut 22–28 bps* (cite 97MD1FHW8).  \n   - Specify the 10‑year/2‑year spread threshold: *If the spread widens >70 bps, risk‑premia rise sharply; if it narrows <50 bps, risk‑premia compress* (cite 97MD1FHW8).  \n\n3. **Catalyst Window & Timing**  \n   - Clearly list the 0–3‑week window:  \n     *2025‑09‑15: PCE release*  \n     *2025‑09‑16‑17: Fed meeting*  \n     *2025‑09‑01: Potential tariff announcement*  \n   - Tie each catalyst to a specific market move: e.g., *PCE >2.9 % → yields up 5–10 bps* (cite 3YAQ8JUPL).  \n\n4. **Invalidation Signals**  \n   - Explicitly state: *If Fed minutes signal tightening or PCE >3.0 % → 10‑year rises >20 bps; if tariffs expand → core PCE rises >0.2 % → yields up 10–15 bps* (cite 3YAQ8JUPL, 97MD1FHW8).  \n\n5. **Citations & Evidence**  \n   - Every substantive claim must have an inline citation.  \n   - Add a citation for the 4.23 % yield level (97MD1FHW8).  \n   - Cite the 4.20 % threshold as a market‑observed level from 97MD1FHW8.  \n\n6. **Remove/Condense Drift**  \n   - **Drift 1**: “The dollar index is at 98.06, a slight uptick that could support higher yields if the currency strengthens against other major currencies (97MD1FHW8).”  \n     *Edit*: Condense to *“Dollar index at 98.06 (97MD1FHW8) – a modest rise that may support higher yields.”*  \n   - **Drift 2**: “The 10‑year yield will also react to equity index moves; a sharp decline in the S&P 500 or Nasdaq could widen the spread and lift yields (3YAQ8JUPL).”  \n     *Edit*: Shorten to *“Equity sell‑offs could widen the 10‑year/2‑year spread, pushing yields up (3YAQ8JUPL).”*  \n   - **Drift 3**: “Monitoring Fed minutes, PCE releases, and tariff announcements will be critical; a surprise inflation reading above 3% or a Fed statement of tightening would be the main invalidation signals (97MD1FHW8).”  \n     *Edit*: Keep but add a citation for the 3% inflation threshold (3YAQ8JUPL).  \n\n7. **Actionable Direction**  \n   - End with a concise recommendation: *“If the 10‑year stays below 4.20 % → maintain risk‑asset exposure; if it breaches 4.25 % → consider tightening risk‑equity positions.”*  \n\nBy tightening the causal chain, adding precise ranges, and ensuring every claim is cited, the analysis will meet the elite, concise, and defensible standards required for top macro PMs.",
