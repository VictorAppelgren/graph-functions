  "description": "Microsoft$MSFT ( \u25b2 0.19% ) is a tech company most of us take for granted, but it\u2019s been a strong and steady market performer.",
  "content": "Microsoft$MSFT ( \u25b2 0.19% ) is a tech company most of us take for granted, but it\u2019s been a strong and steady market performer, up over 135% in the past five years, and up 20% this year alone. With big tech now pouring hundreds of billions into AI, BBTW editor Peter Green spoke with Motley Fool Asset Management\u2019s chief investment strategist, Bill Mann, about why we still tend to gloss over the country\u2019s most diversified mega-cap tech firm, and why that\u2019s always a mistake.\n\nBill Mann:If you look at what Microsoft has done for the last 40 years, it has been one of the 10 largest companies in the U.S., which is an extraordinary streak, and it speaks to a longevity and a creativity that goes on and on. Still, from time to time, we make the mistake of underestimating Microsoft. When they came up with \u201cFANG\u201d (an acronym for Facebook$META ( \u25bc 1.49% ) , Amazon$AMZN ( \u25bc 0.93% ) , Netflix$NFLX ( \u25bc 0.78% ) and Google$GOOGL ( \u25b2 0.21% ) ), Microsoft wasn\u2019t even included, but it is the most internally diverse of the mega-cap tech companies. In an era of incredible economic restructuring in this country around AI and cloud computing, it\u2019s become the safest of the tech plays. Even in an era like this, you can trust Microsoft to have figured out where opportunities lie across the tech stack.\n\nSo where do those opportunities lie?\n\nTheir cloud computing business, Azure, has been incredible. It\u2019sgrowing at 34%. That\u2019s been a huge new business for them. In enterprise security, there are three main players, Microsoft, Sentinel One$SENTINELONE ( 0.0% ) , and CrowdStrike$CRWD ( \u25bc 1.01% ) , controlling most of the market. That\u2019s a $30 billion business for them, and it\u2019s something that almost feels like it\u2019s side-of-desk, but it\u2019s a huge area of opportunity and advantage for them. And there\u2019s Microsoft Co-Pilot, an AI-powered companion designed to assist with various tasks, at $30 a seat per month, $20 billion in additional revenue two years from now.\n\nWhat are the threats to any of these existing businesses?\n\nThe first is that they\u2019ve been generally pretty cooperative with OpenAI, but, as we saw last week, OpenAI is contemplating a bid for Chrome. For OpenAI to make a move to make itself independent, that can be harmful to Azure because they\u2019re pretty well integrated. But I tend to think of Microsoft as being the guy behind the guy. So it\u2019s at a lower risk of being disintermediated, even from some of its hyper-scaling peers. The other big risk to Microsoft? They\u2019re spending $30 billion in CapEx this quarter, and there are structural reasons why the demand for AI and cloud could be slowed down, like the power grid can\u2019t handle all this demand. I don\u2019t care how big you are; if you strand $30 billion in capital expenditures, that\u2019s meaningful. I see plenty of speed bumps for Microsoft and for the entire sector, but given the internal diversity that they have, it is still my favorite bet in the sector.\n\nIs the demand really there for all this AI work?\n\nThe demand will be there, it\u2019s almost a sure thing because it\u2019s happened in every other revolution in the economy, going back to the railroads, that a lot of the capital expenditures are going to be stranded. They\u2019re not all going to win, but none of the hyperscalers want to be left behind.\n\nHow is Microsoft dealing with the AI energy bottleneck?\n\nThey say they have a plan and you would have to assume that all of these companies have recognized the risk, because they\u2019ve already had difficulty sourcing energy. But that place in line is much more important than what the demand for the services looks like in 2028.\n\nTo me, it\u2019s the highest quality investment opportunity in the space.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for brevity and clarity.\n\nGet Big Business This Week in your inbox every week\u2014and read it before everybody else!

The Trump Administration wants to take a $10.86 billion grant awarded to Intel $INTC ( \u25bc 0.87% ) under the Biden Administration\u2019s CHIPs Act, and turn it into a 10% equity stake in the troubled U.S. chipmaker. Intel\u2019s problem is that it\u2019s not making chips that people want to buy. The CHIPs aid was meant to help it build facilities to make market-worthy chips. To make the investment work, the Trump administration would need to lean on potential Intel clients. It\u2019s reminiscent of France\u2019s state-run industrial policy, \u201cdirigisme,\u201d where the government owned golden shares in large enterprises, awarded them state contracts, and ensured they kept employment high. On Monday, Intel said it has been promised a $2 billion investment from Softbank $SFTBY ( \u25bc 0.33% ) , which has already promised Trump it will shower the U.S. with hundreds of billions of dollars of investments. Markets aren\u2019t overconfident in the strategy: Intel shares are down 7% in the past year, and about the same in the past five days.\n\u2022 The tech stock drop. By the time you read this, tech stocks may have recovered, but a number of the most high-flying tech stocks were down significantly Thursday morning. Palantir $PLTR ( \u25b2 0.13% ) dropped nearly 20% since Friday before recovering a bit, Oracle $ORCL ( \u25bc 0.54% ) is down 6% since Tuesday, AMD $AMD ( \u25bc 0.8% ) is down 8% in the past five days, Nvidia $NVDA ( \u25bc 0.31% ) fell as much as 7% on Tuesday alone, Arm $ARM ( \u25b2 1.21% ) is down 6.5% in the past five days, and Softbank is down 15% since the market closed on Monday. What\u2019s going on? The consensus from Cheddar Street is that long-term shareholders are cashing out (the famous profit-taking) and others are wary that AI, big tech, and big chips may have reached a plateau for now.\n\u2022 Off-Target: Target\u2019s $TGT ( \u25bc 2.54% ) got a new boss, but he\u2019s cut from the same cloth as the old boss. COO Michael Fidelke, a 20-year Target vet, will take over in February from Brian Cornell who\u2019ll become executive chairman. But will that help? Profits plummeted 20% in the last quarter as shoppers shunned the store\u2019s offerings, and only massive sales kept revenue from bottoming. Analysts appear to be doubting an insider can fix the chain, hammered by Walmart $WMT ( \u25bc 4.91% ) and Amazon $AMZN ( \u25bc 0.93% ) , and the impending price shock of the tariffs. Shares in Target are down more than 6% since the announcement. They\u2019re down 32% in the past 12 months.\n\u2022 When inflation goes high, Mickey D goes low: As lower-income Americans run out of cash, their favorite eatery is cutting prices. A hard-won fight with franchisees has McDonald\u2019s $MCD ( \u25b2 0.09% ) cutting the price on combo meals by 15%, with plans to offer a $5 breakfast and $8 Big Mac combos. Even as U.S. same-store sales grew 2.5% in the last quarter, traffic was down 2.8% at fast-food restaurants in general. The firm\u2019s shares are up 2.5% in the past 5 days.\n\u2022 Zuck unstuck? Meta $META ( \u25bc 1.49% ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg has launched another re-org as he seeks to make the Facebook parent a dominant player in AI, and get new AI products to market faster. Meta Superintelligence Labs is splitting into four groups, one focused on A.I. research, one on Zuck\u2019s \u201csuperintelligence,\u201d; another on products, and one on data centers and infrastructure. Meta said its investments could reach $73 billion this year, with most of that going to AI.\n\u2022 Claire\u2019s is still there! Tween costume jewelry and ear-piercing fave Claire\u2019s just got a lifeline out of liquidation. The bankrupt chain halted liquidation sales at most of its North American stores, and said it\u2019s selling most of its business to PE firm Ames Watson. The new buyers say they want to preserve \u201ca significant retail footprint\u201d for the chain.\n\u2022 Grinning all the way to the bank: Chinese retailer Pop Mart\u2019s $PMRTY ( \u25bc 0.01% ) stock popped 12% on Wednesday after it announced the impending sale of mini-Labubu dolls, those smirking elvin fluffies collected by Rihanna and Dua Lipa. The minis will be small enough to hang on mobile phones. Don\u2019t let your tween daughters near your credit card.\n\u2022 I would never join a club that would take me as a member: Soho House $SHCO ( \u25b2 0.06% ) , a string of clubs for people who know wealthier and more interesting than you or I, is going private after losing more than half a billion dollars since going public. Investors include Ashton Kutcher, and the company\u2019s existing executive chairman, Ron Burkle. The deal values the floundering business at $2.7 billion. Boutique hotel owner MCR will take a stake in the new company, hoping to revive interest in the club concept. But this is the only year that Soho Club has been profitable as a public company. That may be because of an existential dilemma Groucho Marx would be proud to outline: While defined by its exclusivity, the company has 46 clubhouses and 270,000 members. That\u2019s an awful lot of D-listers and then some. Yet if you kick people out, you can\u2019t make money. Or: Can you?\n\u2022 Subtalk: Overwhelmed by all those subscription TV services? Major e-commerce sites and cable companies want you to buy your streaming services through them. Amazon, with 46 million streaming subs is leading the charge \u2014they take a 30% to 50% commission for the subscriptions they gather for streamers, the New York Times reports. But those high rates from Amazon have kept Netflix $NFLX ( \u25bc 0.78% ) , for one, from signing up. Still, HBO Max found itself hostage to Amazon when it left Prime Video in 2021. It lost 5.1 million subscribers, but when it returned a year later, it won 3 million subscribers within 3 months.\n\u2022 MSNB-whatevuh? As Comcast $CCW ( 0.0% ) prepares to spin off liberal cable news channel MSNBC, severing it forever from NBC News, it\u2019s given the channel what is possibly the worst brand name in TV history. The new moniker: MS Now, short for My Source News Opinion World. (The MS originally came from Microsoft, which created the channel with NBC back in 1996). CNBC gets to keep its name, which always stood for Consumer News & Business Channel, but both will drop the NBC Peacock logo.\n\u2022 The Fox Follies: Remember the $787.5 million Fox paid voting machine company Dominion to settle defamation claims after Fox alleged Dominion had fixed the 2020 presidential election? Well, voting machine firm Smartmatic is still pursuing its own suit for $2.7 billion over the same unproven allegations of fraud, and conservative TV channel Newsmax has agreed to pay Dominion $67 million for broadcasting similar false claims.\n\u2022 Mergermania: Local TV giant Nexstar $NXST ( \u25b2 0.72% ) says it\u2019s agreed to buy Tegna, the spinoff holding Gannett\u2019s TV stations. Adding Tegna\u2019s 64 local stations would give Nexstar 265 stations in 44 states, and requires FTC approval, especially since the two overlap in 35 markets. Nexstar CEO Perry Sook says the $6.2 billion deal (that\u2019s just a tad larger than Nexstar\u2019s market cap) is vital to compete with tech giants Meta and Alphabet. Conservative network Sinclair is also angling for Tegna.\n\u2022 The Apprentice: Fed Chair Edition. Sub-plots within plots! Trump took to social media to demand that Fed governor Lisa Cook \u201cresign now !!!,\u201d after Trump ally and federal home mortgage chief Bill Pulte said Cook appeared to have claimed two different homes as her primary residence when applying for federally guaranteed mortgages, in order to get better loan terms. Removing Cook wouldn\u2019t give Trump allies a majority on the Fed. There are still only two governors who are avowedly pro-Trump, of the 12 members who vote on interest rates, but a replacement could help put public pressure on chair Jerome Powell.\n\u2022 The Gilded Aged: The name is Bond. Donald Bond. Shaken or stirred, Donald Trump has spent at least $100 million buying corporate and local government bonds since he became president, CNBC reported, citing an Aug. 12 filing with the Office of Government Ethics. The corporate bonds include those issued by T-Mobile $TMUS ( \u25bc 0.54% ) , UnitedHealth $UNH ( \u25b2 1.92% ) , Home Depot $HD ( \u25bc 1.01% ) , and Meta $META ( \u25bc 1.49% ) . All but Home Depot are closely regulated by federal agencies.\n\u2022 Y Not? It may not be quite big enough for Musk\u2019s own extended family, but a new, extended Tesla $TSLA ( \u25bc 1.08% ) Model Y is coming to China. With three rows of seats, it can hold six people, and will sell for about $47,000. \u201dThis variant of the Model Y doesn\u2019t start production in the US until the end of next year,\u201d Musk said on X, adding, \u201cMight not ever, given the advent of self-driving in America.\u201d Tesla shares are down more than 4% in the past 5 days, and down a third from their all-time high last December.\n\u2022 Short ride? Short-seller Jim Chanos says it\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d to think that Musk will make Tesla Robootaxis profitable when ge can\u2019t cut the cost per mile below 20 cents.\n\u2022 About that $29 billion comp package. While Musk and X challenge a Delaware court\u2019s decision to block his 2018 comp package that was worth nearly $58 billion at one point, a new shareholder group is challenging the company\u2019s interim award of a $29 billion equity grant. Raising concerns about executive comp rules compliance with Nasdaq, SOC Investment Group says the board failed to win shareholder approval for the grant.\n\nYou\u2019re clearly into smart people talking about even smarter things.

      "text": "Microsoft$MSFT ( \u25b2 0.19% ) is a tech company most of us take for granted, but it\u2019s been a strong and steady market performer, up over 135% in the past five years, and up 20% this year alone. With big tech now pouring hundreds of billions into AI, BBTW editor Peter Green spoke with Motley Fool Asset Management\u2019s chief investment strategist, Bill Mann, about why we still tend to gloss over the country\u2019s most diversified mega-cap tech firm, and why that\u2019s always a mistake.\nPeter Green: What\u2019s driving Microsoft these days?\nBill Mann:If you look at what Microsoft has done for the last 40 years, it has been one of the 10 largest companies in the U.S., which is an extraordinary streak, and it speaks to a longevity and a creativity that goes on and on. Still, from time to time, we make the mistake of underestimating Microsoft. When they came up with \u201cFANG\u201d (an acronym for Facebook$META ( \u25bc 1.49% ) , Amazon$AMZN ( \u25bc 0.93% ) , Netflix$NFLX ( \u25bc 0.78% ) and Google$GOOGL ( \u25b2 0.21% ) ), Microsoft wasn\u2019t even included, but it is the most internally diverse of the mega-cap tech companies. In an era of incredible economic restructuring in this country around AI and cloud computing, it\u2019s become the safest of the tech plays. Even in an era like this, you can trust Microsoft to have figured out where opportunities lie across the tech stack.\nSo where do those opportunities lie?\nTheir cloud computing business, Azure, has been incredible. It\u2019sgrowing at 34%. That\u2019s been a huge new business for them. In enterprise security, there are three main players, Microsoft, Sentinel One$SENTINELONE ( 0.0% ) , and CrowdStrike$CRWD ( \u25bc 1.01% ) , controlling most of the market. That\u2019s a $30 billion business for them, and it\u2019s something that almost feels like it\u2019s side-of-desk, but it\u2019s a huge area of opportunity and advantage for them. And there\u2019s Microsoft Co-Pilot, an AI-powered companion designed to assist with various tasks, at $30 a seat per month, $20 billion in additional revenue two years from now.\nWhat are the threats to any of these existing businesses?\nThe first is that they\u2019ve been generally pretty cooperative with OpenAI, but, as we saw last week, OpenAI is contemplating a bid for Chrome. For OpenAI to make a move to make itself independent, that can be harmful to Azure because they\u2019re pretty well integrated. But I tend to think of Microsoft as being the guy behind the guy. So it\u2019s at a lower risk of being disintermediated, even from some of its hyper-scaling peers. The other big risk to Microsoft? They\u2019re spending $30 billion in CapEx this quarter, and there are structural reasons why the demand for AI and cloud could be slowed down, like the power grid can\u2019t handle all this demand. I don\u2019t care how big you are; if you strand $30 billion in capital expenditures, that\u2019s meaningful. I see plenty of speed bumps for Microsoft and for the entire sector, but given the internal diversity that they have, it is still my favorite bet in the sector.\nIs the demand really there for all this AI work?\nThe demand will be there, it\u2019s almost a sure thing because it\u2019s happened in every other revolution in the economy, going back to the railroads, that a lot of the capital expenditures are going to be stranded. They\u2019re not all going to win, but none of the hyperscalers want to be left behind.\nHow is Microsoft dealing with the AI energy bottleneck?\nThey say they have a plan and you would have to assume that all of these companies have recognized the risk, because they\u2019ve already had difficulty sourcing energy. But that place in line is much more important than what the demand for the services looks like in 2028.\nSo is Microsoft a sell, a hold, a buy?\nTo me, it\u2019s the highest quality investment opportunity in the space.\n#NotFinancialAdvice\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for brevity and clarity.\n\u2014Peter S. Green\nWatch Big Business This Week on Cheddar\u2014and YouTube!\nBig Businesses mentioned this week\n$MSFT ( \u25b2 0.19% ) $META ( \u25bc 1.49% ) $AMZN ( \u25bc 0.93% ) $NFLX ( \u25bc 0.78% ) $GOOGL ( \u25b2 0.21% ) $SENTINELONE ( 0.0% ) $CRWD ( \u25bc 1.01% ) $INTC ( \u25bc 0.87% ) $SFTBY ( \u25bc 0.33% ) $PLTR ( \u25b2 0.13% ) $NVDA ( \u25bc 0.31% ) $ORCL ( \u25bc 0.54% ) $AMD ( \u25bc 0.8% ) $ARM ( \u25b2 1.21% ) $TGT ( \u25bc 2.54% ) $WMT ( \u25bc 4.91% ) $AMZN ( \u25bc 0.93% ) $MCD ( \u25b2 0.09% ) $TSLA ( \u25bc 1.08% ) $CLRS ( 0.0% ) $PMRTY ( \u25bc 0.01% ) $SHCO ( \u25b2 0.06% ) $CCW ( 0.0% ) $NXST ( \u25b2 0.72% )\nGet Big Business This Week in your inbox every week\u2014and read it before everybody else! Sign up today.\nThe usual suspects\n- Inside Intel? The Trump Administration wants to take a $10.86 billion grant awarded to Intel $INTC ( \u25bc 0.87% ) under the Biden Administration\u2019s CHIPs Act, and turn it into a 10% equity stake in the troubled U.S. chipmaker. Intel\u2019s problem is that it\u2019s not making chips that people want to buy. The CHIPs aid was meant to help it build facilities to make market-worthy chips. To make the investment work, the Trump administration would need to lean on potential Intel clients. It\u2019s reminiscent of France\u2019s state-run industrial policy, \u201cdirigisme,\u201d where the government owned golden shares in large enterprises, awarded them state contracts, and ensured they kept employment high. On Monday, Intel said it has been promised a $2 billion investment from Softbank $SFTBY ( \u25bc 0.33% ) , which has already promised Trump it will shower the U.S. with hundreds of billions of dollars of investments. Markets aren\u2019t overconfident in the strategy: Intel shares are down 7% in the past year, and about the same in the past five days.\n- The tech stock drop. By the time you read this, tech stocks may have recovered, but a number of the most high-flying tech stocks were down significantly Thursday morning. Palantir $PLTR ( \u25b2 0.13% ) dropped nearly 20% since Friday before recovering a bit, Oracle $ORCL ( \u25bc 0.54% ) is down 6% since Tuesday, AMD $AMD ( \u25bc 0.8% ) is down 8% in the past five days, Nvidia $NVDA ( \u25bc 0.31% ) fell as much as 7% on Tuesday alone, Arm $ARM ( \u25b2 1.21% ) is down 6.5% in the past five days, and Softbank is down 15% since the market closed on Monday. What\u2019s going on? The consensus from Cheddar Street is that long-term shareholders are cashing out (the famous profit-taking) and others are wary that AI, big tech, and big chips may have reached a plateau for now.\n- Off-Target: Target\u2019s $TGT ( \u25bc 2.54% ) got a new boss, but he\u2019s cut from the same cloth as the old boss. COO Michael Fidelke, a 20-year Target vet, will take over in February from Brian Cornell who\u2019ll become executive chairman. But will that help? Profits plummeted 20% in the last quarter as shoppers shunned the store\u2019s offerings, and only massive sales kept revenue from bottoming. Analysts appear to be doubting an insider can fix the chain, hammered by Walmart $WMT ( \u25bc 4.91% ) and Amazon $AMZN ( \u25bc 0.93% ) , and the impending price shock of the tariffs. Shares in Target are down more than 6% since the announcement. They\u2019re down 32% in the past 12 months.\n- When inflation goes high, Mickey D goes low: As lower-income Americans run out of cash, their favorite eatery is cutting prices. A hard-won fight with franchisees has McDonald\u2019s $MCD ( \u25b2 0.09% ) cutting the price on combo meals by 15%, with plans to offer a $5 breakfast and $8 Big Mac combos. Even as U.S. same-store sales grew 2.5% in the last quarter, traffic was down 2.8% at fast-food restaurants in general. The firm\u2019s shares are up 2.5% in the past 5 days.\n- Zuck unstuck? Meta $META ( \u25bc 1.49% ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg has launched another re-org as he seeks to make the Facebook parent a dominant player in AI, and get new AI products to market faster. Meta Superintelligence Labs is splitting into four groups, one focused on A.I. research, one on Zuck\u2019s \u201csuperintelligence,\u201d; another on products, and one on data centers and infrastructure. Meta said its investments could reach $73 billion this year, with most of that going to AI.\nThe usual suspects\n- Claire\u2019s is still there! Tween costume jewelry and ear-piercing fave Claire\u2019s just got a lifeline out of liquidation. The bankrupt chain halted liquidation sales at most of its North American stores, and said it\u2019s selling most of its business to PE firm Ames Watson. The new buyers say they want to preserve \u201ca significant retail footprint\u201d for the chain.\n- Grinning all the way to the bank: Chinese retailer Pop Mart\u2019s $PMRTY ( \u25bc 0.01% ) stock popped 12% on Wednesday after it announced the impending sale of mini-Labubu dolls, those smirking elvin fluffies collected by Rihanna and Dua Lipa. The minis will be small enough to hang on mobile phones. Don\u2019t let your tween daughters near your credit card.\n- I would never join a club that would take me as a member: Soho House $SHCO ( \u25b2 0.06% ) , a string of clubs for people who know wealthier and more interesting than you or I, is going private after losing more than half a billion dollars since going public. Investors include Ashton Kutcher, and the company\u2019s existing executive chairman, Ron Burkle. The deal values the floundering business at $2.7 billion. Boutique hotel owner MCR will take a stake in the new company, hoping to revive interest in the club concept. But this is the only year that Soho Club has been profitable as a public company. That may be because of an existential dilemma Groucho Marx would be proud to outline: While defined by its exclusivity, the company has 46 clubhouses and 270,000 members. That\u2019s an awful lot of D-listers and then some. Yet if you kick people out, you can\u2019t make money. Or: Can you?\nThe media mirror\n- Subtalk: Overwhelmed by all those subscription TV services? Major e-commerce sites and cable companies want you to buy your streaming services through them. Amazon, with 46 million streaming subs is leading the charge \u2014they take a 30% to 50% commission for the subscriptions they gather for streamers, the New York Times reports. But those high rates from Amazon have kept Netflix $NFLX ( \u25bc 0.78% ) , for one, from signing up. Still, HBO Max found itself hostage to Amazon when it left Prime Video in 2021. It lost 5.1 million subscribers, but when it returned a year later, it won 3 million subscribers within 3 months.\n- MSNB-whatevuh? As Comcast $CCW ( 0.0% ) prepares to spin off liberal cable news channel MSNBC, severing it forever from NBC News, it\u2019s given the channel what is possibly the worst brand name in TV history. The new moniker: MS Now, short for My Source News Opinion World. (The MS originally came from Microsoft, which created the channel with NBC back in 1996). CNBC gets to keep its name, which always stood for Consumer News & Business Channel, but both will drop the NBC Peacock logo.\n- The Fox Follies: Remember the $787.5 million Fox paid voting machine company Dominion to settle defamation claims after Fox alleged Dominion had fixed the 2020 presidential election? Well, voting machine firm Smartmatic is still pursuing its own suit for $2.7 billion over the same unproven allegations of fraud, and conservative TV channel Newsmax has agreed to pay Dominion $67 million for broadcasting similar false claims.\n- Mergermania: Local TV giant Nexstar $NXST ( \u25b2 0.72% ) says it\u2019s agreed to buy Tegna, the spinoff holding Gannett\u2019s TV stations. Adding Tegna\u2019s 64 local stations would give Nexstar 265 stations in 44 states, and requires FTC approval, especially since the two overlap in 35 markets. Nexstar CEO Perry Sook says the $6.2 billion deal (that\u2019s just a tad larger than Nexstar\u2019s market cap) is vital to compete with tech giants Meta and Alphabet. Conservative network Sinclair is also angling for Tegna.\nTrumplandia\n- The Apprentice: Fed Chair Edition. Sub-plots within plots! Trump took to social media to demand that Fed governor Lisa Cook \u201cresign now !!!,\u201d after Trump ally and federal home mortgage chief Bill Pulte said Cook appeared to have claimed two different homes as her primary residence when applying for federally guaranteed mortgages, in order to get better loan terms. Removing Cook wouldn\u2019t give Trump allies a majority on the Fed. There are still only two governors who are avowedly pro-Trump, of the 12 members who vote on interest rates, but a replacement could help put public pressure on chair Jerome Powell.\n- The Gilded Aged: The name is Bond. Donald Bond. Shaken or stirred, Donald Trump has spent at least $100 million buying corporate and local government bonds since he became president, CNBC reported, citing an Aug. 12 filing with the Office of Government Ethics. The corporate bonds include those issued by T-Mobile $TMUS ( \u25bc 0.54% ) , UnitedHealth $UNH ( \u25b2 1.92% ) , Home Depot $HD ( \u25bc 1.01% ) , and Meta $META ( \u25bc 1.49% ) . All but Home Depot are closely regulated by federal agencies.\nElon\u2019s world\n- Y Not? It may not be quite big enough for Musk\u2019s own extended family, but a new, extended Tesla $TSLA ( \u25bc 1.08% ) Model Y is coming to China. With three rows of seats, it can hold six people, and will sell for about $47,000. \u201dThis variant of the Model Y doesn\u2019t start production in the US until the end of next year,\u201d Musk said on X, adding, \u201cMight not ever, given the advent of self-driving in America.\u201d Tesla shares are down more than 4% in the past 5 days, and down a third from their all-time high last December.\n- Short ride? Short-seller Jim Chanos says it\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d to think that Musk will make Tesla Robootaxis profitable when ge can\u2019t cut the cost per mile below 20 cents.\n- About that $29 billion comp package. While Musk and X challenge a Delaware court\u2019s decision to block his 2018 comp package that was worth nearly $58 billion at one point, a new shareholder group is challenging the company\u2019s interim award of a $29 billion equity grant.
