They deliver high-fidelity audio performance and world-class noise cancellation that allow you to hear more of your music and movies \u2014 while traveling, at the office, or at home.\nQuietComfort Ultra Headphones offer our most premium design and our most advanced technologies, for the best Bose listening experience in a headphone. With QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, you will enjoy our best headphone noise cancellation, audio quality personalized with CustomTune, and voice pickup, among other premium features.\nProprietary TriPort acoustic headphone structure utilizes external ports to vent the earcups and effectively enlarge the acoustic volume, without increasing the size of the earcup. The result is better audio and active noise reduction from a smaller, lighter, more comfortable headphone.\nBose QuietComfort Headphones utilize both active and passive noise reduction technologies. They use a sophisticated proprietary electronics approach for active noise reduction, placing microphones both inside and outside the earcups. The electronics system senses the sound in almost any environment and then measures, compares, and reacts \u2014 instant by instant \u2014 to produce an opposing cancellation signal. Meanwhile, passive noise reduction is achieved by the combination of earcup fit, design, and clamping force of the headband.\nAware Mode turns on the external microphones of QuietComfort Headphones and feeds ambient sounds into the headphones, enabling awareness of the sounds in the environment, such as cars and emergency vehicles, while still enjoying audio content.\nThese headphones were designed to maximize all the features that contribute to comfort, especially when you\u2019re using the headphones for extended periods of time. All materials have been selected for their comfort and lightweight properties. Protein leather is used for its comfort, durability, and acoustical properties. The earcups rotate easily for a uniform, comfortable seal. And most importantly, stability is achieved with minimal clamping force, allowing for hours of comfortable wear.\nYes. Bose QuietComfort Headphones have an adaptive microphone system that allows you to use the headphones during calls when connected to any smartphone. In addition to traditional calls, the headphones will work with many apps that use Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), such as Zoom or FaceTime. The microphone system adapts to your environment to isolate your voice from competing background noises and wind so that you can confidently take a call or speak to your voice assistant anywhere you go \u2014 knowing you will be heard clearly and naturally.\nFirst, make sure your headphones are turned on with the slider switch in the middle \u201cOn\u201d position. Next, slide and hold the switch to the Bluetooth icon until the Bluetooth LED flashes blue or when the voice prompt indicates the headphones have entered into pairing mode. Please note, if this is your first time connecting the headphones, they will automatically turn on into pairing mode. Voice prompts will provide you with additional guidance. We recommend using the Bose app to complete the pairing process, however, Bluetooth settings on your device can be used to complete pairing.\nYes. Multipoint technology allows Bose QuietComfort Headphones to maintain a connection to two devices at the same time \u2014 for example, an iPad and a smartphone. So while you\u2019re watching video on the connected iPad, the headphones will automatically pause the video to answer a call from the connected smartphone. When the call is finished, the headphones switch back to the video on the iPad.\nBose QuietComfort Headphones have a range of up to 30 ft (9 meters) from the source device. This range may be reduced by physical obstructions, such as walls and doors, or by interference from other electronic devices. Pops or a cracking noise may be heard if there\u2019s interference with the Bluetooth connection. If that happens, move away from wireless routers or microwaves and bring your headphones closer to the Bluetooth device.\nThe headphones can be charged using the USB-C cable supplied in the box and plugging into a USB port on a PC, laptop, or wall charger. Allow up to 2 hours for the headphones to fully charge. The battery light indicator will show an amber light while the headphones are charging and turn green when fully charged. When you don\u2019t have time for a full charge, the fast-charge feature provides up to 4 hours of play time from a quick, 15-minute charge.\nBose QuietComfort Headphones use a lithium-ion rechargeable battery that provides up to 24 hours\u00b9 of audio playback with noise cancelling turned on.\nYes. You can continue to listen to your source even if the battery power is depleted. Without power, the headphones operate in a passive mode and neither active noise cancellation nor Active EQ is able to function.\nBose QuietComfort Headphones also give you two options when it comes to audio EQ. Do nothing and the bass, midrange, and treble of whatever you\u2019re listening to will be adjusted automatically to make it sound great. Or choose Equalizer in the settings of the Bose app to change the audio levels yourself to however you like them best. Either way, you\u2019ll enjoy immersive sound at any volume.\nThe larger middle button on the right earcup is the Multi-function button. It initiates play/pause and other track controls for videos and music, answers and ends calls, and also provides access to your phone\u2019s default virtual assistant, like Siri. The buttons on either side of the multi-function button are volume +/\u2013 buttons. They allow you to easily adjust volume in an intuitive up/down vertical orientation.\nOn the left earcup there is a single Action button. This toggles between Quiet Mode (noise cancelling), Aware Mode, and your Custom Modes. This is also a shortcut button; when you press and hold the button for approximately 2 seconds your shortcut, such as battery life status or Spotify Tap, will activate.\nUsing the Multi-function button on the back of the right earcup, QuietComfort Headphones give you access to your phone\u2019s default virtual assistant, like Siri.\nNo. In general, the audio/video delay will be excessive and most noticeable in games where action and audio are supposed to be synchronized.\nSpotify Tap allows Spotify users to access their music with a single tap on a designated control on their headphones. Press and hold the \u201cAction\u201d button on the left earcup to start your listening session and press down again for Spotify to offer up recommendations for other music you might like. You need a Spotify account and can configure the shortcut control to activate Spotify Tap using the Bose app.\nOwner's guide\nTry legendary noise cancelling\nQuiet when you want it, awareness when you need it. QuietComfort Headphones feature legendary Bose noise cancelling with Quiet and Aware Modes so you can decide how much of the world to let in.\nDesigned for extended listening sessions in a classic, iconic design, the plush earcups softly hug your ears while the secure yet comfortable headband uses steel in just the right places to optimize strength and feel. Whether you choose a standard color or a standout hue that makes a statement, you\u2019ll be ready to go beyond the beat with this modern twist on a beloved classic.\nThe magic of modes\nTune out the world \u2014 or let it in \u2014 with world-class noise cancellation and customizable listening modes to match the mood or moment.\nThe Bose app maximizes everything your headphones have to offer, ensuring optimal functionality with regular software updates and access to the latest features.\nCreate shortcuts: Assign or modify shortcuts for Immersive Audio settings, Spotify Tap, and voice assistant access.\nMake a mode: Create custom modes with a noise cancellation level and Immersive Audio setting of your choosing.\nCustomize your sound: Adjust EQ settings by modifying the levels of bass, mid-range, and treble to your liking.\nDownload on the App Store or Google Play.\n\u201cThey\u2019re comfortable to wear, easy to use and the sound is perfection.

Proprietary Bose OpenAudio technology allows the earbuds to play rich, immersive audio privately even though the speakers on the earbuds sit a short distance from your ear canal, leaving you open to the sounds of your surroundings. The cuffs hook around the outside of your ear so gently that you might forget they\u2019re even there, so you can leave them on all day, always ready for music, calls, or videos.\nThe Open Earbuds were designed from the ground up to give you a soundtrack for your life: to let you enjoy your music without blocking your ears, in a shape so comfortable you can almost forget you\u2019re wearing any earbuds at all. The engineering of these earbuds was a matter of squeezing Bose OpenAudio technology \u2014 which projects deep, rich sound across a short distance of open space to your ear canal \u2014 into a shape that could grip your ear extremely gently, leave your ear open to outside sounds, and contain a long-lasting battery. This design process resulted in the Open Earbuds\u2019 unique shape, inspired by ear cuff jewelry. The light-as-air flex arm connects the audio portion of the earbud to a battery barrel that goes behind your ear, providing just enough grip to keep the earbuds secure on any size ear.\nYes. The Open Earbuds are excellent for exercise, thanks to their confident stability on your ear, powerful sound, and open design. Bose\u2019s unique OpenAudio technology allows air to keep your ears cool and dry while you enjoy both your music and sounds from your environment, such as city sounds, nature, input from a coach or workout partner, or sounds that help you play a sport such as tennis or basketball.\nYes. The combination of skin-safe materials, a fully open design, long battery life, and unparalleled comfort means you can leave the earbuds on all day, always connected to your device and ready to produce rich audio the moment you need it.\nIn stereo mode, the earbud batteries will provide up to 7 hours of play time or 48 hours of standby time (no audio playing). For all-day wear that involves a mix of audio listening and standby, the battery life will vary depending on the proportion of each. For example, 5 hours of audio would leave 10 hours of standby life remaining. And if the battery does run out, a quick 10-minute charge in the case will add up to 2 hours of play time.\nYes. You can slide the earbud slightly up or down the outside of your ear to adjust for comfort, preferred sound balance, looks, or to avoid interference with jewelry.\nYes. The Open Earbuds are uniquely designed to attach to a part of the ear that does not interfere with most glasses, hats, and piercings. If your accessories touch the product, that\u2019s no problem as long as the earbuds remain comfortable and secure. The magnets that help the earbuds attach to their charging case may occasionally stick slightly to jewelry made of ferromagnetic metals like nickel; this is not damaging to the earbuds or the jewelry, but if bothersome can be avoided by slightly sliding the earbud up or down the ear, away from the jewelry.\nOpenAudio is a proprietary Bose technology that allows audio played a short distance from your ear canal to be rich, deep, and private \u2014 without sealing your ear. Each earbud uses a tiny dipole transducer system engineered for loud-and-clear personal audio that stays at the ear \u2014 instead of going everywhere else.\nIt\u2019s easy to hear the difference Bose OpenAudio makes by comparing the power of the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds with a traditional set of earbuds held slightly outside your ear. If you remove the traditional earbud from your ear canal and hold it near your ear at the same distance that the Open Earbuds sit, you\u2019ll notice the much greater volume and richer bass from the Open Earbuds.\nBose OpenAudio directs rich, deep audio into the ear canal while using proprietary technology to minimize sound spillage in other directions. In most environments and at most listening levels, people around you won\u2019t hear a thing. If you turn up the volume all the way in a very quiet environment, others may hear that something is playing from your earbuds, but they won\u2019t be able to hear any detail unless they get very close.\nNo. By design, the Open Earbuds don\u2019t block out the world or have noise cancelling, so you can enjoy your music while staying open to the sounds of the world around you. They do have an automatic volume control feature, available in the Bose app, that helps you hear your music evenly as your environment changes from quiet to loud and back.\nYes. The Ultra Open Earbuds have the Bluetooth multipoint feature allowing them to connect to two source devices at the same time. This is a recent update as of July 2024, so be sure to set up your earbuds with the Bose app to receive software updates.\nThe Bose app also allows you to customize the shortcut function on each earbud\u2019s button, and one of the available options is Switch Source. Setting a shortcut to Switch Source will enable you to switch between previously connected Bluetooth source devices with a press and hold of the earbud button without needing to take the earbuds off.\nGive your life a soundtrack\nGroove to your music and your surroundings \u2014 at the same time, all the time. This fresh take on listening combines premium sound quality, enduring comfort, and an innovative design.\nIn sync and open to anything\nOpenAudio tech is for moments that call for awareness, like crossing a busy street or taking a call in the park. Ultra Open Earbuds sit comfortably on your ears and project sound into them, keeping you engaged with life as you listen.\nMusic from start to finish\nFrom running errands to meeting up with the run club, experience the feeling of having your favorite artist right beside you. The high-quality audio of Ultra Open Earbuds keeps you connected no matter where the day takes you.\nFor your ears only\nTry the surprisingly private yet open experience of Ultra Open Earbuds.\nWeightless comfort\nA soft yet sleek, silicone hinge adapts effortlessly to your ear during movement, staying secure and stylish. Plus, the light-as-air fit means you\u2019ll forget you\u2019re wearing them.

Then, the earbuds played IEC 60268-1 pink noise using A2DP Bluetooth audio streaming at an RSSI of 75 dBm until battery depletion. Volume was set to a playback loudness of 75 dBA and 3-band EQ was set to zero. Testing repeated until the case battery was depleted.

You\u2019re trying to pick a brand, a size and you need to understand all the language around a variety of extra features. To help, we\u2019ve answered a few of the most asked questions.\nWhat is 4K resolution?\nA TV with 4K offers a much clearer picture than regular HD TVs. It has a resolution called Ultra HD (UHD), which means it has about four times more pixels than a Full HD TV. The higher pixel count makes the images on the screen look sharper and more lifelike.\nWhat features does a smart TV have?\nA smart TV offers much more than just TV channels. They come loaded with apps like Netflix, Hulu, Paramount+ and other streaming services, although you will still need subscriptions to these services to use the apps. Many smart TVs also come with voice control capabilities through built-in assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant. They also support screen mirroring, which allows you to display content from your smartphone, laptop or tablet on the TV screen.\nWhat size TV should I buy?\nThe right size TV for you depends on your needs. A smaller room requires a smaller TV (unless you\u2019re willing to have it take up the entire room), while larger living rooms and entertainment rooms can house TVs up to 100 inches. A good mid-level TV is a 40- or 50-inch TV, which is large enough to keep the whole family entertained."
