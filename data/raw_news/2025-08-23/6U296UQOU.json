  "content": "Shawn Kemp was sentenced to 30 days of electronic home monitoring after firing a gun in a Tacoma shopping mall parking lot in March 2023.\n\nThe six-time NBA All-Star is required to begin home monitoring within two weeks, serve one year of state supervision and complete 240 hours of community service, according to the Seattle Times.\n\nKemp pleaded guilty in May to second-degree assault, admitting that he shot at two men inside a Toyota 4Runner after they broke into his truck and stole numerous items, including keys to his business, a cellphone, paperwork and sports memorabilia.\n\nKemp then followed the location of the phone to track down the thief who was driving the stolen 4Runner.\n\nHe allegedly returned fire after one of the men began firing a gun toward him.\n\nKemp was initially charged with a count of first-degree assault with a firearm enhancement, and had second-degree assault, firearm enhancement and drive-by shooting charges added in May.\n\n\u201cShawn is committed to moving forward in a positive direction,\u201d Kemp\u2019s attorney Tim Leary said earlier this summer. \u201cHe was presented with an offer from the state that allows him to take responsibility, but I think also recognizes the self-defense nature of how this transpired.\u201d\n\nThe prosecution had been urging the judge to sentence him to nine months in jail, one year in community custody and to pay restitution.\n\n\u201c[Kemp\u2019s] plan is to tell the community about the dangers of gun violence, really to be a positive influence on youth,\u201d Aaron Kiviat, one of Kemp\u2019s other attorneys, said.\n\nKemp spent 14 years in the NBA, retiring after the 2002-03 season.\n\nHe had his best run with the Supersonics, making the 1996 NBA Finals and All-NBA second team three times during his time in Seattle.",

      "text": "Access the Yankees beat like never before\nJoin Post Sports+ for exciting subscriber-only features, including real-time texting with Greg Joyce about the inside buzz on the Yankees.\nTry it freeAnthony Volpe\u2019s rough season got even worse Friday in a 1-0 loss to the Red Sox.\nNot only did the shortstop go hitless again to extend his slump to 1-for-25, he got booed after a strikeout in the eighth and made a mental error at shortstop an inning later.\nVolpe\u2019s miscue at short in the top of the ninth of a one-run game came with Jarren Duran on second.\nCeddanne Rafaela hit a grounder to Volpe and instead of making the routine throw to first, Volpe threw behind Duran to Jazz Chisholm Jr. at second.\nDuran was safe and Rafaela beat Chisholm\u2019s throw to first.\nThe play went as a fielder\u2019s choice, but Volpe\u2019s 16 errors is the highest in the league.\n\u201cIt was obviously not the right play, but it was a little bit of a heady play, too,\u2019\u2019 Aaron Boone said, somewhat in defense of his shortstop.\nBoone noted that there was a \u201cgap\u201d between Duran and Chisholm.\nStill, it\u2019s a play that can\u2019t be made at that point.\nVolpe followed with a solid throw home to get Duran at the plate on a contact play later in the inning.\nThe shortstop\u2019s slump is just as alarming.\nHe has 10 strikeouts in his last 25 at-bats and when he whiffed against Garrett Whitlock for the second out in the bottom of the eighth, Volpe heard some relatively loud boos.\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t swung it great the last week,\u201d Boone said. \u201cThe last two days, he\u2019s just missed a couple pitches and then he had some confused swings. We\u2019ve got to get him going again offensively.\u201d\nOnly six players have a worse OPS than Volpe\u2019s .680 mark since June 12.\nAnd his .171 average is the worst among 162 qualified hitters in the same span.\nPrior to the game, hitting coach James Rowson said Volpe\u2019s performance at the plate hasn\u2019t been as bad as the recent numbers would indicate.\n\u201cIt shows up sometimes as he doesn\u2019t have hits in a certain number of at-bats, but it\u2019s not purely about results,\u2019\u2019 Rowson said. \u201cHis at-bats over the last month or so have been really good. The results have to be there, too, and there haven\u2019t been a lot of hits, but he\u2019s not doing much different than when he was locked in earlier in the season.\u201d\nTo Rowson\u2019s point, an argument could be made that Volpe has hit into some bad luck, with a .167 BABIP since Aug. 2, compared to his .272 career mark and .241 number for this season.\nBoone said there was no update on when Aaron Judge may be able to play the outfield as he deals with a right flexor strain that\u2019s limited him to DH duties.\nJonathan Lo\u00e1isiga is scheduled to see Dr. Keith Meister on Tuesday as the right-hander could be headed toward another elbow surgery. Lo\u00e1isiga has appeared in 30 games this season, but was on the IL with back tightness prior to the elbow injury.\nFernando Cruz (oblique) gave up a run in 1 \u00b9/\u2083 innings in a rehab appearance with Double-A Somerset.\nBoone said he considered pinch-hitting Amed Rosario for Trent Grisham against Aroldis Chapman in the ninth, but decided against it.\nRosario is 3-for-7 with two homers against the lefty, while Grisham is now 0-for-3 with three strikeouts.\n- CHECK OUT THE LATEST MLB STANDINGS AND YANKEES STATS\nAustin Wells has seen his playing time dip recently, a result of his struggles at the plate, as well as the emergence of Ben Rice at catcher.\n\u201cBen has earned more opportunities there,\u2019\u2019 Boone said of Rice, who was at first Friday. \u201cWells has gone through struggles the last few weeks\u2026 We know what Austin is capable of and it\u2019s a product of Rice pushing in and [having Paul] Goldschmidt at first.\u201d\nWells was coming off a game in which he homered twice against the Rays.\n\u201cHopefully, Wells gets a little traction offensively,\u2019\u2019 Boone said.\nAustin Slater (left hamstring strain) has started baseball activities and did drills in the outfield Friday, but Boone said there was no updated timeline for his return."

      "text": "Shawn Kemp, who was one of the most popular athletes in Seattle in the 1990s when he played for the Sonics, was sentenced Friday in Pierce County Superior Court to 30 days of electronic home monitoring for second-degree assault.\nKemp must submit to home monitoring within two weeks and will also serve one year of community custody and complete 240 hours of community service.\nUnder state sentencing guidelines for second-degree assault, Kemp faced a standard range between three and nine months in jail. Judge Michael Schwartz found that the circumstances surrounding the crime warranted an \u201cexceptional sentence\u201d downward, allowing Kemp to avoid jail time.\nWhen Schwartz delivered the sentence, Kemp looked at the ceiling and blew a huff of air, then repeatedly made the sign of the cross with his hand.\nKemp, 55, pleaded guilty in May to shooting at two men inside a Toyota 4Runner outside the Tacoma Mall in March 2023, damaging the 4Runner and another vehicle. None of the rounds fired by Kemp hit anyone, nor was he injured, according to court documents.\nKemp contended that he acted in self-defense, returning fire after one of the men shot at him from inside the 4Runner, which fled the scene before Tacoma police arrived, court records show. When the vehicle was found abandoned in Federal Way five days later, an empty holster was found inside, but there was no gun.\n\u201cI\u2019m very apologetic for what I did,\u201d Kemp said to the judge before sentencing concluded.\n\u201cHe understands and appreciates that he could have and should have conducted himself differently that afternoon in the Tacoma Mall parking lot,\u201d Kemp\u2019s defense attorney, Timothy Leary, wrote in a sentencing memo. \u201cHowever, the public scorn, disappointment, embarrassment and personal shame weighs heavy on Mr. Kemp. That punishment lasts much longer than any jail sentence.\u201d\nThe defense also claimed that the two men Kemp shot at provoked the shooting by stealing Kemp\u2019s truck, his cellphone and memorabilia in Seattle. Judge Schwartz agreed.\nKemp used an app to track his stolen phone in the car and followed the men to the Tacoma Mall to recover his property.\nDuring the sentencing hearing on Friday, deputy prosecutor Sean Plunkett played videos from nearby businesses and witnesses. Kemp is overheard on a 911 call saying \u201cThey took all my (expletive) out of my (expletive) vehicle.\u201d\nProsecutors argued there is no evidence that either of the men fired at Kemp first.\n\u201cAt no point does he flinch. At no point does he look like he\u2019s trying to protect himself,\u201d prosecutor Thomas Howe said.\nHowever, Schwartz noted the holster that was later found in the 4Runner, lodged in the front panel.\nThe state had asked the judge to sentence Kemp to nine months in Pierce County Jail. Prosecutors said Kemp threw his gun into some bushes and didn\u2019t immediately tell police officers who responded to the scene, creating \u201ca dangerous situation\u201d outside a business.\nSchwartz emphasized that the shooting \u2014 and the risk of injuring or killing someone \u2014 could have been easily avoided if Kemp walked away.\n\u201cProperty is replaceable,\u201d he said. \u201cHuman life is not.\u201d\nSeveral people submitted letters of support to the court on Kemp\u2019s behalf, and about 30 people attended the hearing, including his pastor and former NFL star Marshawn Lynch.\nKemp\u2019s daughter, Bella Kemp, wrote that \u201cwe are all capable of making mistakes.\u201d\nThe executive director of Seattle\u2019s Central Area Senior Center, Dian Ferguson, wrote to the judge that Kemp and his wife have offered support to their programs serving low-income seniors, including sponsoring Thanksgiving meals.\n\u201cShawn has thrown through his actions that he will never give up on people whom society has written off,\u201d said Paula Sardinas, the founder of Washington\u2019s Build Back Black Alliance, during the sentencing.\nA six-time NBA all-star, Kemp was a major part of the Sonics\u2019 successful run in the 1990s and later played for Cleveland, Portland and Orlando, Fla., before retiring in 2003. In 2020, he opened a cannabis dispensary in Seattle\u2019s Belltown neighborhood and then a second shop in Sodo in February 2023.\nOne of the other two men involved in the encounter is in prison in the Stafford Creek Corrections Center. That man is suing Kemp, alleging severe personal injuries and emotional distress.\nIn a victim impact statement, the man wrote that he is traumatized from the shooting and has \u201cbeen left in a state of emotional suffering,\u201d and can\u2019t watch basketball or play sports with his kids without being triggered.\n\u201cThe assault against me by Mr. Kemp has left me paralyzed with fear and hopelessness about the future,\u201d he wrote.\nThe man is requesting that Kemp pay the Department of Corrections the cost of his medical treatment while he is incarcerated.\nAfter the hearing, Kemp said in an interview that \u201cthe last three years have been tough.\u201d\nKemp said he plans to be an advocate against gun violence, especially among youth.\n\u201cThink twice,\u201d he said. \u201cThink twice when you get mad. Think twice when you get a little upset.\u201d"

      "text": "Micah Parsons\u2019 contract standoff with the Cowboys took a bizarre turn thanks to his antics at the team\u2019s final preseason game Friday night.\nThe two-time All-Pro was seen walking the hall of AT&T Stadium eating nachos before the Cowboys clashed with the Falcons.\nOne Atlanta fan yelled for him to join their franchise, to which Parsons made the\u201d call me\u201d gesture.\nThings got stranger as Parsons, the only player not in uniform, arrived at the field.\nThe 26-year-old linebacker, who is a hold-in during training camp, dressed in a navy hoodie with gray sleeves and was later seen resting on the medical table as the Cowboys were on offense.\nParsons, who is seeking a lucrative multi-year contract extension, explained his actions on social media after the game in response to a post by Dallas sports anchor Mike Leslie saying he was only lying on the table for a \u201crelatively short portion\u201d of the game in an attempt to add some context.\n\u201cI actually appreciate this. The way media shapes perception and narratives is wild\u2014and if he hadn\u2019t said anything, everyone would\u2019ve just run with it,\u201d Parsons said.\n\u201cI\u2019d never disrespect the guys out there fighting for their lives.\u201d\nCowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer told reporters he was unaware of what Parsons was doing because he was focused on the game, a 31-13 win.\nParsons did not speak to reporters after the game, but cornerback Trevon Diggs put Parsons\u2019 availability for Week 1 in doubt beyond his contract status.\nDiggs revealed Parsons had an MRI on his back.\n\u201cIt depends on how his back feels,\u201d Diggs said. \u201cI know he was real sore this morning. He went and got it checked out. That\u2019s the last thing I heard from him.\u201d\nOwner and general manager Jerry Jones has said Parsons\u2019 back issue is just part of the negotiation tactics.\nJones addressed the contract stalemate and Parsons\u2019 trade request Friday.\nHe said they don\u2019t plan on trading Parsons, calling any talk of it \u201cBS.\u201d\nHe put some of the blame on Parsons\u2019 agent David Mulugheta, saying he told the Cowboys to stick their offer \u201cup our ass.\u201d\n\u201cWe were going to send it (an offer) over to the agent and the agent said don\u2019t bother because we\u2019ve got all that to negotiate,\u201d Jones said on Michael Irvin\u2019s podcast. \u201cWell, I\u2019d already negotiated. I\u2019d already moved off my mark on several areas. And so, the issue is frankly that we already had the negotiation in my mind, and now the agent is trying to stick his nose in it.\u201d\nMulugheta said that \u201cnever happened\u201d to ESPN\u2019s Ryan Clark.\n\u201cThis is just another public way to make this situation, which is already ugly, even uglier,\u201d Clark said in a video posted to X. \u201cDavid Mulugheta in no way has ever told Jerry Jones or any other general manager or owner that. It\u2019s all bull crap. It\u2019s all lies.\u201d\nParsons is set to play on his $24 million fifth-year rookie contract option this season and is likely seeking a deal similar to T.J. Watt\u2019s three-year, $123 million pact with the Steelers.\nThe Cowboys could franchise tag him for the next two seasons to keep him from hitting free agency."
