      "summary": "Amazon and Alphabet are projected to surpass Apple in market capitalization by 2028, driven by strong growth in cloud computing, AI services, and advertising revenues. Amazon’s AWS remains a profit engine, while its AI‑powered logistics and expanding ad business fuel momentum. Alphabet’s dominant search advertising, rapid cloud expansion, and AI integration support its valuation climb, though antitrust risks could pose a downside. Both companies’ diversified tech ecosystems position them to outpace Apple’s slower AI adoption and tariff exposure.",
