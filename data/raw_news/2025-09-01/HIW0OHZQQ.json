  "description": "Merz Says No Clear End in Sight for War in Ukraine",
  "content": "Let's talk about the assessment from the German chancellor. Pretty negative. Yes, it is pretty negative, but also potentially clear eyed. We've seen successive rounds of negotiations between the two sides and they've largely just produced prisoner swaps. Putin has stuck to maximalist demands and hasn't backed down. And the Kremlin really hasn't shown any indication that they want this conflict to end or that they're even willing to do a cease fire. Meanwhile, Ukraine, they see this as an existential fight, so they're very unlikely to lay down their weapons with neither side able to gain a military advantage. It does look like the conflict is mired in sort of a stalemate and nothing, no end in sight. So kind of a clear idea. I remember you and I were discussing this around the time that this summit is sort of the rehabilitation of Vladimir Putin on the global stage. And now he's in Shanghai. He's meeting with all of these other leaders around the world, President Xi, they are going to be meeting with President Modi. So that really just speaks to the elevation that he's received around the world in the last month. But at the same time, the Europeans are still pressing ahead and saying that more secondary sanctions need to be applied on Russia. We heard this from Macron and Merz over the weekend. Could we expect more action to that effect on sanctions out of Europe? Well, it is interesting. I mean, historically, Europe has been somewhat reluctant on the secondary sanctions, but in some ways, this is an admission that the direct sanctions on Russia have reached the limits of what they can do. They're not a very powerful level around Putin. Obviously, the conflict continues. But if you dig a little deeper, it's also an attempt to prod the U.S. to back them in secondary sanctions and to take more actions. Donald Trump has said that he is willing to impose sanctions on Russia, but he's largely been reluctant to and has not impose any kind of punitive measures onto Putin. So they're also trying to get the U.S. to step up to the plate and put pressure on Russia to finally end this conflict or at least come to a.",

This follows a series of unsuccessful negotiations between the two sides, which have resulted in prisoner swaps and no agreement on a cease-fire.

Putin\u2019s recent Shanghai visit and meetings with global leaders signal a diplomatic rehabilitation, while European leaders push for more secondary sanctions to pressure Russia. Historically hesitant, Europe now acknowledges that direct sanctions have limited impact and seeks U.S. support for stronger measures. President Trump has expressed willingness to sanction Russia but has not acted, leaving the U.S. role uncertain.",
