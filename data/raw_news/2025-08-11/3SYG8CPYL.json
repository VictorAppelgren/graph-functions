  "title": "Trump delays China tariff increases by another 90 days",
  "description": "Trump has extended the current pause on higher tariffs with China for another 90 days while trade negotiations continue.",
  "content": "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order extending lower tariffs with China for another 90 days, CNBC reports. The new executive order was signed before the previous agreement was set to end on August 12 at midnight.\n\nThe extension will maintain the current 30 percent tariff on goods from China while representatives from both countries negotiate a new trade deal. The previous agreement lowered US tariffs down from 145 percent to 30 percent, and Chinese tariffs down from 145 percent to 10 percent.\n\nAt the time, it was unclear how the move would impact the price of electronics manufactured in China, but for at least some companies, it's still led to higher costs. While the price of the Switch 2 is remaining the same, Nintendo announced at the beginning of August that the price of the Switch 1 would increase by $40 or more. Sonos has said that some of its products would increase in price, but hasn't shared details. Both DJI and Microsoft announced price hikes on some of their products back in May, too.\n\nFor companies manufacturing products abroad, the sudden swerves in Trump administration trade policy seem almost as difficult to deal with as the tariffs themselves. That erratic protectionism is reshaping global trade, and it's also won concessions from companies trying to do business as normal. Apple committed to spending an extra $100 billion on US manufacturing last week to avoid being subjected to tariffs. And early today, both AMD and NVIDIA reportedly agreed to pay the US 15 percent of their profits to be allowed to sell GPUs in China.",

      "text": "Microsoft is raising prices on the Xbox Series S and Series X\nThe two consoles will now start at $380 and $550, respectively.\nMicrosoft is dramatically increasing the price of the Xbox Series X and Series S, as well as new games and accessories. As of today, the Series S will start at $380, up from $300, while the Series X will begin at $550, a $100 increase from its previous price. As for the 1TB Series S, it now costs $430, up from $350. Meanwhile, if you want the Series X with disc drive, it will now set you back $600. Lastly, the 2TB Galaxy Black Special Edition now costs an eye-watering $730.\nAdditionally, Microsoft says beginning this holiday season \"some\" new first-party games will release at $80. As a small consolation, if you purchase one of those games through the Xbox Store, it will support Microsoft's Play Anywhere feature, allowing you to play it on PC at no additional cost.\nAt the same time, the company is increasing the price of nearly all of its first-party and peripherals. Most notably, a core controller will now set you back $65. Microsoft is also increasing pricing in Europe, UK, Australia and many other countries.\n\"We understand that these changes are challenging, and they were made with careful consideration given market conditions and the rising cost of development,\" the company said. \"Looking ahead, we continue to focus on offering more ways to play more games across any screen and ensuring value for Xbox players.\"\nHistorically, the price of consoles has gone down, not up, mid-generation. In 2002, for instance, Sony cut the price of the PlayStation 2 from $299 to $199. Alongside the system's extensive game library, Sony's aggressive pricing strategy was widely credited for the PS2's runaway success. Similarly, Sony revived the PlayStation 3's fortunes in 2009 with the console's 'Slim' redesign and price cut to $299. The fact Microsoft is now increasing the price of the Xbox Series X/S nearly five years after release is likely to kill whatever little momentum the two consoles had."

      "text": "US and China agree to slash tariffs for 90 days\nIt's not yet clear how the substantial reduction will affect the price of electronics.\nFollowing negotiations in Geneva, the United States and China have agreed to lower tariffs substantially for the next 90 days, the White House announced. The aim is to de-escalate the current trade war and allow both parties time negotiate to achieve a \"sustainable, long-term and mutually beneficial economic and trade relationship,\" they said in a joint statement.\nThe US will temporarily lower its tariffs on Chinese goods from 145 to 30 percent (10 percent plus a 20 percent fentanyl-related levy). China, meanwhile, will cut its tariff on American imports from 125 percent to 10 percent. It's not clear exactly how that will affect prices of electronics goods coming into America from China like smartphones, computers, cameras and drones.\nThe news caused an after-hours stock rally with S&P 500 futures rising 2.8 percent and the dollar up 0.7 percent against other currencies. \"We want more balanced trade and I think both sides are committed to achieving that,\" said US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent. \"Neither side wants a decoupling.\"\nThe effect of US tariffs on the price of consumer goods was brought home recently with the news that DJI had increased the price of its popular Osmo Pocket 3 gimbal camera from $520 to $800 over the past few months. Given the rhetoric between the nations and the sky-high tariffs imposed, such a substantial reduction comes as a surprise. \"This is better than I expected. I thought tariffs would be cut to somewhere around 50 percent and this is much lower,\" economist Zhiwei Zhang told Reuters."

      "text": "President Donald Trump on Monday delayed high U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods from snapping back into place for another 90 days, a White House official told CNBC.\nThose tariffs were set to resume Tuesday. But Trump signed an executive order hours beforehand that extends the deadline until mid-November, according to the official.\nThe delay was the expected outcome from the latest round of talks between U.S. trade negotiators and their Chinese counterparts, which took place in Stockholm in late July.\nIf the deadline were not extended, then U.S. duties on China would have shot back up to where they stood in April, when the tariff war between the world's largest trading nations was at its peak.\nAt that time, Trump had cranked up blanket tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, and China had retaliated with 125% duties on U.S. goods.\nBut the two sides agreed to pause most of those tariffs in May, after negotiators met for the first time in Geneva. The U.S. pared its tariffs back to 30%, and China dropped its levies to 10%.\nMonday's extension is the latest example of how Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs have shifted with little prior notice, a dynamic that has made U.S. trade policy unpredictable for many businesses.\nTrump has previously announced steep tariffs on countries or specific sectors, only to scale them back, tweak them or pause them days or weeks later.\nThe \"reciprocal tariffs\" he initially rolled out in early April, for instance, were quickly paused and then delayed multiple times before taking effect in an altered form last week.\nOn Sunday, Trump said he wanted China to \"quickly quadruple\" its orders of U.S. soybeans.\n\"This is also a way of substantially reducing China's Trade Deficit with the USA,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.\nChicago soybean prices rose Monday. It was not immediately clear if China has agreed to step up its soybean purchases in response to Trump's post."

      "text": "NVIDIA may give US government a cut of its profits to sell AI chips to China\nThe unusual deal goes against the advice of many national security experts.\nThe debate over whether AI chipmakers should be allowed to sell their products to China has taken an unusual turn. The US government has reportedly given NVIDIA and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) permission to make the sales but for one big catch: 15 percent of the sales. The news was first reported by The Financial Times, which cited multiple people familiar with the agreement.\nIn July, NVIDIA announced that the US government would approve export licenses to sell its H20 AI GPUs after blocking their sale in April. NVIDIA created these specific chips \u2014 which are less powerful than ones sold in the US \u2014 in response to restrictions on sales to China. It previously developed the A800 and H800 chips for the Chinese market, but those were also banned.\nNow, NVIDIA and AMP were both reportedly granted export licenses for China last week, after agreeing to give the government 15 percent of their profits. AMP will provide the share from sales of its MI308 chip.\nThere's significant debate over whether selling AI chips to China will endanger US national security. At the end of July, 20 national security experts and past government officials \u2014 including President Trump's former deputy national security advisor, Matt Pottinger \u2014 wrote a letter to Howard Lutnick, the US Secretary of Commerce, stating as much.\nThe signatories \"believe this move represents a strategic misstep that endangers the United States\u2019 economic and military edge in artificial intelligence.\" They worry it will restrict the number of chips available for the US and be used by China's military, among other concerns. NVIDIA disagrees, claiming the export licenses will allow it to compete with Chinese businesses."

      "text": "Apple to invest another $100 billion into the US to avoid tariffs\nThe company previously committed to investing $500 billion over the next five years.\nApple plans to invest an additional $100 billion in the US, the company announced on Wednesday. The investment follows President Donald's Trump's announcement yesterday that he would impose a 100 percent tariff on chip imports, with an exemption for any companies \"building in the United States.\"\nAlso relevant is the White House's previously announced plans to raise tariffs on India by an additional 25 percent (bringing the total tariff to 50 percent) for purchasing oil from Russia. Apple relies heavily on manufacturers in India to create the iPhone, so adding to its already $500 billion investment in the US is likely a way to avoid being impacted by the tariffs.\n\"Today, we're proud to increase our investments across the United States to $600 billion over four years and launch our new American Manufacturing Program,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook shared in a statement. \"This includes new and expanded work with 10 companies across America. They produce components that are used in Apple products sold all over the world, and we\u2019re grateful to the President for his support.\"\nIn February, Apple said its original $500 billion investment plan would go towards building Apple Intelligence servers in the US, and that the majority of the new jobs the funding would provide would be focused on R&D, silicon engineering, software development and AI and machine learning. As part of this additional investment, Apple says it's also deepening its relationship and investment in component makers working in the US, like Corning and Amkor.\nCorning produces the glass for iPhones and Apple Watches, and the company says that \"soon, every iPhone and Apple Watch sold around the world will be built with Kentucky-made cover glass.\" Apple is investing in Amkor to take advantage of the company's \"advanced chip packaging and test facility in Arizona.\" Apple says its \"leading the creation of an end-to-end silicon supply chain in the United States\" through its investments.\nIn addition, Apple said it would be working with Samsung \"to launch an innovative new technology for making chips, which has never been used before anywhere in the world.\" Those chips will reportedly be cutting-edge image sensors for iPhone cameras and be built in Texas, according to The Financial Times. Apple may be shifting at least part of its sensor purchases to Samsung from Sony due to tariffs \u2014 Samsung has chip plants in the US and Sony doesn't. Apple said that Texas Instruments, Broadcom and GlobalFoundries would expand component manufacturing in the US as well.\nIn a statement to Bloomberg before the announcement, a White House spokesperson suggested the new investment would \"help reshore the production of critical components to protect America\u2019s economic and national security.\" The Trump administration has previously called for Apple to make the iPhone in the US, something CNN reports is difficult to downright impossible.\nApple's current strategy for dealing with Trump is similar to how it handled the President during his first term. In 2019, Cook and Trump \"opened\" a Mac Pro factory in Texas. The factory had been up-and-running since 2013, but the President was pleased by the optics of making a deal. Apple's partnership with Amkor was similarly announced years ago in 2023, but is being trotted out now because it fits with Apple's \"American Manufacturing Program.\"\nApple is a trillion-dollar company that can afford to spend a few billion to avoid paying tariffs, but it also likely planned to increase its investment in the US anyway to keep up with competitors. It's entirely possible the company is just packaging its spending in a way that flatters the President.\nSteve Dent contributed to this report.\nIf you buy something through a link in this article, we may earn commission."

      "text": "Sonos is raising prices this year to make up for tariff expenses\nPrice increases will apply to a selection of the company's products, but we don't know which yet.\nSonos plans to raise prices across its lineup of products later this year in order to minimize the impact of tariffs on its earnings, the company has revealed alongside its financial results for the third quarter of 2025. It hasn't listed the products and their new prices yet, but it said that it's evaluating any changes it might need to its promotional strategies and that it has flexibility to move production between Vietnam and Malaysia as needed. To note, the Trump administration had imposed a 20 percent tariff on imports from Vietnam and a 19 percent tariff on imports from Malaysia. Sonos also said that it will invest on diversifying its geographic footprint and expanding its presence in markets that represent only a small share of its revenue today to drive growth.\nA Sonos spokesperson confirmed that not everything in the company's lineup will go up in price, but it sounds like products in its main product categories will get more expensive. We don't yet know the specifics on what products are getting more expensive yet.\nThe company took steps to diversify its supply chain last year, which led to its manufacturing facilities in the two aforementioned countries. It now only relies on Chinese plans for products bound to the US for a limited number of accessories, such as speaker stands. Still, for the third quarter of 2025, tariffs reduced Sonos' gross margin for the third quarter by $2.1 million and its cash flow by $3.5 million. In the fourth quarter of the year, which covers the holiday shopping season, Sonos expects tariffs to reduce its gross margin by $5 million and to remove between $8 to $10 billion from its cash flow.\nOverall, Sonos posted a revenue of $344.8 million in the third quarter, which is almost $100 million larger than its revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. It's not a secret that 2024 was a tough year for the company. It rolled out a major update that broke its app, which led to the delay of product releases as it worked to fix the issue. Former Sonos CEO Patrick Spence even stepped down in the beginning of 2025 and was replaced by ex-Snap executive Tom Conrad.\nUpdate, August 11, 2024, 11:08AM ET: This story has been updated to note that not all of Sonos' products are getting price increases."
