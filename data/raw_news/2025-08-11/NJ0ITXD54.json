  "description": "Best known for a viral video in which she straddled an oil pumping jack while topless and without pants, a Texas elected official now faces jail time after smoking a joint on TikTok.",
  "content": "Best known for a viral video in which she straddled an oil pumping jack while topless and bottomless, a Texas elected official now faces jail time after smoking a joint on TikTok.\n\nDistrict Attorney Sarah Stogner, 41, could be incarceration after she posted a social media video of herself smoking weed in protest of a state ban on THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.\n\nThe Republican made headlines in 2022 when she posted the viral clip of her riding the oil pump jack at the time she was running to be the state's railroad commissioner.\n\nStogner, now the DA of Texas's 143rd judicial district near Pecos, hopes her latest stunt might shame Texas into legalizing weed - especially if she is arrested and made a martyr for the cause.\n\n'I did this to raise attention,' she told Newsweek.\n\n'Its silly that our elected officials want to completely ban THC when that's not what our constituents want.'\n\nMedical marijuana is legal in Texas, but recreational use of the drug is not.\n\nAnd in recent weeks, Lone Star State lawmakers passed a bill banning any products containing any 'detectable amount of any cannabinoid.'\n\nIf signed into law, the bill would outlaw the majority of hemp products, including those that are legal under the federal definition in Texas.\n\nStogner revealed on a TikTok livestream this weekend that she traveled to New Mexico to buy cannabis and then brought the drug back across state lines to Texas.\n\nThe admission she brought an illegal substance into the Lone Star State could open her up to being arrested on a misdemeanor possession charge.\n\n'You might want to guard the New Mexico border on Saturday,' Stogner posted in an X post addressing Lt. Governor Dan Patrick.\n\n'I'm going to a dispensary to buy a joint. And then I'm going to smoke it in my backyard at 4:20 pm. Come and take it,' she continued.\n\nThe timing of Stogner's smoking is a play on the number 420, a nickname for weed.\n\nBeing found in possession of marijuana carries up to a 180 days in prison and up to a $2,000 fine.\n\nSeparately, anyone bringing cannabis across state lines could be fined up to $250,000 or be sentenced to five-year prison sentence, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nDespite admitting to breaking the law, Stogner isn't worried she will be charged with a crime.\n\nSince she is the prosecutor that would have jurisdiction, she shamelessly told the publication she would not bring charges against herself, adding that juries aren't willing to bring charges against pot users or even dealers.\n\nHowever, her last media stunt backfired.\n\nStogner's raunchy reel of her humping a dirty oil pump naked did not win her the public office she was running for.\n\nThe clip was apparently meant to garner attention for Stogner's campaign, as she trailed frontrunner Wayne Christian, the incumbent who out fundraised her.\n\nHowever, Stogner was ridiculed online - and even lost the endorsement of one of the state's major newspapers - while others praised her bravery and success at garnering attention.",

  "summary": "Texas District Attorney, Sarah Stogner, may face up to five years in prison for smoking a joint on TikTok in protest of a state ban on THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, following her social media post showing herself smoking the drug in her garden. The move is part of Stogern's campaign to raise awareness about the ban on the THC, which is currently banned in Texas. Despite admitting to breaking the law, she is confident she will not be charged with a crime as she is the prosecutor who has jurisdiction. Stagner's previous stunt, which included a viral video of her naked oil pump jack ride, failed to garner attention for her running for a public office.",

      "text": "'They say I needed money. I have OTHER assets': West Texas GOP wannabe railroad commissioner, 37, divides locals after posting TikTok video of herself TOPLESS while straddling oil pumping jack\n- Sarah Stogner, 37, tweeted a video of her straddling an oil pumping jack while topless and without pants on on February 13\n- It was meant as a way to garner attention for her campaign for Texas Railroad Commissioner, which controls the state's oil and gas\n- She was soon ridiculed online and had an endorsement from one of the state's major newspaper rescinded\n- Stogner said the video was meant as a joke to bring awareness to her campaign\n- She also said that the San Antonio News-Express' editorial 'felt very much like slut shaming'\nA West Texas woman running to be the state's railroad commissioner has turned heads after she posted a TikTok of herself topless and without pants while straddling an oil pumping jack.\nSarah Stogner, 37, tweeted out the controversial video, set to The Sugarhill Gang's Apache (Jump On It) song, on February 13, writing: 'They said I needed money. I have other assets.'\nThe video - which has now been viewed more than 104,800 times - was apparently meant to garner attention for Stogner's campaign, as she trailed frontrunner Wayne Christian, the incumbent who currently has $766,256 on hand as voters head to the polls, according to Transparency USA, a website that tracks campaign funding.\nBut in the wake of the video, Stogner was ridiculed online - and even lost the endorsement of one of the state's major newspapers - while others praised her bravery and success at garnering attention.\nSarah Stogner, 37, posted a short TikTok video of her straddling an oil pumping jack on February 13 as a way to garner attention for her campaign for Texas Railroad Commissioner\nShe said it was filmed as a joke and she only decided to post it because she was trailing incumbent Wayne Christian in the polls\nThe video - which has now been viewed more than 104,800 times - was apparently meant to garner attention for Stogner's campaign\nStogner was ridiculed online - and even lost the endorsement of one of the state's major newspapers\nStill, Stogner insists the video was meant as a joke\nShe said: 'They said I needed money. I have other assets'\nAfter the video was posted on Twitter, one person commented: 'I'm confused. Are you running for political office, or auditioning to be a stripper,' and another wrote: 'Sad. Some people like to display their qualifications, but if this is all you have...'\nAnother man then chimed in: 'When you have literally nothing to base your candidacy on, go with \"stripper rides mechanical bull\" said no one ever,' while another said: 'If you want to make money on Onlyfans, just do that.\n'This ad is just going to confuse people because people don\u2019t tend to want to associate railroad commissioners with softcore porn.'\nThe San Antonio Express-News editorial board even dropped its support of the candidate.\n'We were disappointed to see a disgraceful TikTok video posted Sunday from Sarah Stogner, whom we recently recommended in the Republican primary for railroad commissioner,' the editorial board wrote. 'We rescind our recommendation.'\nThe editorial board instead endorsed Stogner's opponent, Dawayne Tipton, saying they would not have endorsed Stogner for the position, which oversees the state's oil and gas industry, if she had posted the video earlier.\n'This is an opportunity to reaffirm our principles and expectations,' the San Antonio Express-News board wrote. 'We expect candidates for public office to model civil discourse and decorum worthy of the public's trust. This was neither.\n'Instead, it's an indictment of these times that a candidate, even a marginal one, would appeal to potential voters in such way via social media ... this was an embarrassing failure.'\nOthers, though, expressed their support of Stogner's ad, with one man writing: 'Whatever you think of this ad, it's probably the most effective ad in politics.\n'There's probably a few million people who never heard of her that has now heard of her. Publicity is the most important thing in elections.'\nAnother asked how many times he could vote for her, and a third said: 'As a Texan, I believe that if one has the galls to pull this kind of stunt off, you deserve my vote.'\nAnd for his part, Tipton, who is now endorsed by all of the state's largest newspapers said he does not fault Stogner for the video.\n'It was a Hail Mary to energize her campaign,' he said, according to the Houston Chronicle. 'It's not something that I would personally do or undertake.')\nStogner said the criticism of the video felt 'very much like slut-shaming'\nAfter she posted the video, people ridiculed her on Twitter while others praised her bravery and her ingenuity in creating the ad\nStill, Stogner insists the video was meant as a joke.\nShe started her campaign last year when she found success posting TikToks about leaking oil wells near her West Texas home, garnering thousands of views on each video. With that success, the Chronicle reports, Stogner thought she could unseat the incumbent without the hundreds of thousands of dollars needed to run a state campaign.\nStogner even hired a documentary crew to film her campaign, which shot the clip in November. She said she did not plan to release it, but as polls showed she was only a few points behind Christian, he decided it was worth the risk.\n'I knew it would be controversial,' she said. 'I didn't realize it would incite the rage and anger that it did from the press.'\nStogner said she found out that the San Antonio Express-News was going to drop its endorsement after she posted the video.\nShe told Chron that editorial page editor Josh Brodesky contacted her on Facebook and asked her if she was hacked.\nOnce she confirmed that she did, in fact, post the video, Brodesky informed her that the board would be rescinding its recommendation.\n'Wow, OK. I wish you would wait and hear what I have to say before making the decision,' she said. 'We have radiation in our water, but me scantily clad is where the line is drawn.'\n'It feels very much like slut-shaming,' she said. 'We were just goofing off. We had the footage from last year, and I said \"I'm going to make my own Super Bowl commercial.\n'If I had gone off and shot machine guns and screamed about the border, they wouldn't have a problem with it.'\nStogner also took issue with the San Antonio Express-News vetting process, pointing out that she posted a picture of herself nude facing away from the camera to Instagram and Twitter in June 2021.\n'They said they did their homework on me,' she said. 'Ask them if they saw my picture from last summer. It's on Instagram. I'm naked, bare butt in the sand hills, raising awareness.\n'It's not sexual,' she told Chron. 'But if female nudity isn't for sexual use, I guess it's a no-go.'\nMost watched News videos\n- Moment passengers 'stop' man who pulled down trousers on tube\n- Moment Cycling Mikey pushes bike into a car after furious row\n- Kristen Welker calls out JB Pritzker over Gerrymandering\n- Shocking moment woman strikes flight attendant before being removed\n- Shocking moment man is gored to death after charging at bull\n- Family-friendly restaurant Cracker Barrel unveils bold new look\n- Chinese navy vessel collides with one of its own chasing Philippine boat\n- Moment 'dine and dashers' run out on \u00a3200 bill at Indian restaurant\n- Chinese Navy ship collides with own vessel while chasing boat\n- Hawaii ferry is tossed by strong waves before being run aground\n- Florida man knocks out kayakers while attempting a DAREDEVIL leap\n- Father of children mowed down in Oatlands tragedy confronts killer"

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nA Texas district attorney could face a prison sentence for livestreaming herself smoking marijuana to protest a proposed ban on weed-associated products.\nSarah Stogner, a Republican district attorney for Texas's 143rd Judicial District, said she bought the marijuana from New Mexico, where it is legal to do so and transported it to Texas to smoke outside her home in Ward County to make a point.\nIn doing so, she could be arrested on a misdemeanor possession charge.\nStogner told Newsweek that she wasn't concerned about being prosecuted because, as a district attorney, she has jurisdiction in the area she smoked in and because juries don't want to prosecute those who possess or even deal marijuana.\n\"I did this to raise attention,\" she said. \"Its silly that our elected officials want to completely ban THC when that's not what our constituents want.\"\nWhy It Matters\nStogner's action follows a sustained conflict about whether to permit certain cannabis products in Texas. THC is an $8 billion industry in Texas, and a number of experts say the drug is beneficial for medicinal reasons. Others warn of safety concerns about the use of THC.\nIn June, Texas Governor Greg Abbott vetoed a proposed ban on cannabis-derived compounds, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) products.\nHowever, similar legislation is to be mooted in a special session item in the state Senate, after it passed the House on Friday. It would ban the sale of products containing THC but would allow the sale of other cannabinoids.\nWhat To Know\nPossessing cannabis in Texas is classed as a Class B misdemeanor. This carries up to 180 days in prison and up to a $2,000 fine.\nTransporting cannabis across state lines also carries a potential $250,000 fine or a five-year prison sentence, according to the Drug Enforcement Agency.\nIn her video, Stogner addressed Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick, a proponent of banning marijuana. She also posted an image of her smoking marijuana on X and directed it to Patrick, whom she called on to \"free the plant.\"\nStogner told The New York Times she lined up a defense lawyer and alerted the local district judge before her stunt.\nWhat People Are Saying\nMatthew Mangino, a former district attorney in Lawrence County, Pennsylvania, told Newsweek: \"I don't see Sarah Stogner getting prosecuted by the state of Texas. First, she is a Republican, recently recruited to unseat a Democrat DA in rural Texas. Second, she targeted the lieutenant governor for his support of a THC ban, while Governor Abbott is not seeking a ban on THC, only regulation.\"\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott previously told Newsweek: \"Texas can and should reasonably regulate consumable hemp products to protect public health and safety. THC products for Texans under 21 should be banned, as should be dangerous synthetic products. We can do that without also eliminating consumer access to adults.\"\nStogner told Austin news station KVUE-TV that she would consider posting similar videos again: \"Because it raises awareness, and I'm a nobody from nowhere. With social media and the ability to have a voice, that's how you have a voice.\"\n\"I'm tired of our elected officials not doing what's best for the people on the ground,\" she added. \"We've got real crimes to prosecute\u2014oilfield theft, rape, murder\u2014and right now, we can't enforce the law as written on marijuana because of testing requirements.\"\n\"If we want to protect kids, then we need to legalize and regulate it, and we need to tax it, just like we do with alcohol,\" she said.\nWhat Happens Next\nWhether Stogner faces legal consequences for her protest remains to be seen.\nMeanwhile, the ban will need to face the Senate and, if passed, Abbott's approval before becoming a law.\nAbout the writer\nKate Plummer is a Newsweek reporter based in London, U.K. Her focus is on U.S. politics and national affairs, and ...
