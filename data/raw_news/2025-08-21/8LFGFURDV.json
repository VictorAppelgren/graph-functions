  "description": "News of the December 2024 incident made headlines months later in May.",
  "content": "It\u2019s a good thing there was \u201cno hair-pulling\u201d when Bill Belichick\u2019s ex, Linda Holliday, wanted his current girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, removed from a December holiday party in Nantucket.\n\nElin Hilderbrand, a novelist and a friend of Holliday\u2019s, who was part of the group that asked Hudson to leave the event, explained that it was \u201cgrossly inappropriate\u201d for the 24-year-old former college cheerleader to be there as Holliday\u2019s twin daughters were DJing at the party.\n\n\u201cNo punches were thrown, no hair was pulled,\u201d Hilderbrand told The New Yorker in a lengthy timeline piece published Monday about Belichick\u2019s life and career. \u201cBut we did suggest she leave because we thought it was grossly inappropriate for her to be there.\n\n\u201cBill and Linda were together since the girls were, like, fourteen years old, and they thought of him as a father figure.\u201d\n\nThe UNC coach, 73, and Holliday, 62, a former TV personality and Nantucket socialite, were together for 16 years before their split in September 2023.\n\nBelichick and Hudson\u2019s relationship became public in June 2024. The pair met on a flight in 2021.\n\nHudson reportedly attended the party with her friend and Miss Massachusetts USA 2024, Melissa Sapini, and the pair was asked to leave towards the end of the night. They agreed and left the event alongside an employee.\n\nHolliday declined to speak with The New Yorker.\n\nHolliday and Hudson\u2019s run-in made headlines months later in May.\n\nTMZ published an internal incident report that an employee filed at the event, which said Hudson \u201cwas a paying guest\u201d and that \u201cno concerns had been raised regarding her behavior nor had any issues been reported up until that point in the evening.\u201d\n\nThe report stated that Holliday \u201cfelt [Hudson\u2019s] presence was inappropriate, since the event was widely advertised as a party headlined by her daughters.\u201d\n\nSecurity footage showed Hudson surrounded by three women, including Holliday and Hilderbrand, who had confronted her near the dance floor.\n\nAccording to the incident report, Hudson refused to leave at first, saying she didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but then decided to exit the function as it was close to being over.\n\nHudson told the employee that Sapini \u201cwas seemingly threatened by Ms. Holliday, saying that if Ms. Sapini valued her current title, she should think twice about who her friends are and that she [Holliday] had many powerful friends in the pageant organization.\u201d\n\nHolliday told the employee, \u201cIf this didn\u2019t involve my girls, I don\u2019t think this would have bothered me as much. The \u2018momma bear\u2019 in me came out.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Holliday and Hudson crossed paths at a fundraiser for Nantucket Cottage Hospital.",

Threatened Miss Mass., Too\nBill Belichick's ex-girlfriend, Linda Holliday, ran into his current one, Jordon Hudson, while the two were at a Christmas party late last year ... and TMZ Sports has learned their meetup was anything but friendly.\nThe intense encounter went down on Dec. 6 ... at a \"Stroll Party\" in Massachusetts hosted by Dreamland -- which describes itself as \"Nantucket Island's Year-Round Nonprofit Film, Performing Arts & Cultural Center.\"\nHolliday's daughters -- Ashley and Kat Hess, AKA The Hess Twins -- were DJing the bash ... which started at around 7 PM.\nBut, according to a Dreamland incident report we obtained, at around 9:30 PM -- Holliday, who reportedly moved into a Belichick-purchased Nantucket home in 2024, contacted an event official with a Hudson-related issue.\nThe documents state Holliday was upset by the presence of Belichick's current girlfriend ... believing it was \"inappropriate, since the event was widely advertised as a party headlined by her daughters.\"\n\"She asked that I remove Ms. Hudson from the premises,\" the official wrote in the report.\nA short time later, according to the documents, Holliday was seen on security video confronting Hudson with a few of her friends right in the middle of a dance floor -- where roughly 200 people were partying.\nThe documents state as the Dreamland official approached the scene, Holliday and her friends \"backed away\" as the person questioned Hudson.\n\"I asked Ms. Hudson if she thought it was a good idea to be there considering the clear animosity the above individuals felt towards her,\" the official wrote in the docs. \"She defended herself by saying she'd done nothing wrong, and it was her first time attending Christmas Stroll and wanted to attend the 'big party' going on that night, which happened to be the one featuring the Hess Twins.\"\n\"She said she was not looking to cause any problems, but just wanted to go out and have fun with her friend,\" who the report ID'ed as Melissa Sapini, Miss Massachusetts USA 2024.\nAfter being reminded there were only a few minutes remaining in the party, Hudson agreed to leave -- but as she and Sapini were walking out, the event staffer stated Hudson told them Holliday, who has ties to the pageant world, threatened Sapini while they were on the dance floor.\nShe said Holliday told Sapini if she \"valued her current title, she should think twice about who her friends are.\"\nHolliday allegedly added that she \"had many powerful friends in the pageant organization.\"\nWaiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\nThe documents noted Sapini did not speak, but did begin to cry in the corner of the room while the conversation was going on.\nA short time later, the event staffer returned to speak with Holliday, who said, \"If this didn't involve my girls, I don't think this would have bothered me as much, but because it did the 'momma bear' in me came out.'\"\nDreamland declined to issue a formal comment on the incident, though a spokesperson for the org. did tell us despite the heated nature of the matter, police never got involved and neither did event security. The rep added no one is facing any kind of ban ... and all involved parties will be allowed back at future events.\nWe've reached out to Hudson and Holliday for comment, but multiple attempts to contact the two have been unsuccessful.\nHolliday, of course, dated Belichick for nearly two decades ... from 2007 to 2022. A short time after they split, Belichick got romantic with Hudson, whom he met on a plane ride in 2021."

I am just shook really.\u201d\nShe\u2019s not the only tennis star to join the OnlyFans platform; Nick Kyrgios signed up in 2023.\nFor Vickey, it\u2019s always been about \u201cpushing boundaries.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been outspoken about racial hate I get online, body-shaming,\u201d she said on the \u201cBlack Spin Global\u201d podcast in June. \u201cI\u2019m very open about a lot of stuff. I\u2019m still playing tennis. My career is still going, but I also want to do things outside of tennis. I\u2019m starting to explore more opportunities on social media.\u201d\n\u201cBeing a tennis player definitely helped my marketing,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m at a stage where I don\u2019t do the absolute most on there but I\u2019m comfortable as I need to be. I\u2019m doing really well.\u201d\nThat\u2019s been the case on the court, as well: Vickery kicked off a potential U.S. Open run with a victory over Anastasiya Soboleva on Tuesday, earning her a matchup against No. 21 Ella Seidel on Thursday."

      "text": "On the morning of December 12th, Bubba Cunningham, the athletic director at the University of North Carolina, in Chapel Hill, sent the football team\u2019s equipment manager to pick up a U.N.C. sweatshirt with removable sleeves. He asked his wife to go to Goodwill and buy a suit jacket. Cut the sleeves off, he texted her, then added, \u201c(Seriously).\u201d\nSixteen days earlier, U.N.C. had announced the retirement of its football coach, Mack Brown. This had come as news to Brown. Cunningham was now preparing to reveal his replacement: Bill Belichick, who led the New England Patriots to a record six Super Bowl victories before leaving the team in January, 2024, fifteen wins shy of breaking Don Shula\u2019s record as the winningest head coach in N.F.L. history. Colleges had hired former N.F.L. coaches before (Pete Carroll, at U.S.C.; Nick Saban, at Alabama), but there was no coach quite like Belichick, a brilliant tactician with an introvert\u2019s appetite for granular detail, a shabby habit of wearing the sleeves of his sweatshirts cut off near the elbow, and the delicacy of a junk-yard dog. As far back as 1993, during Belichick\u2019s first head-coaching job, with the Cleveland Browns, Sports Illustrated described him as \u201can automaton who offers no positive motivation and sees players only as faceless cogs.\u201d At press conferences, he delivered curt non-answers or sometimes simply walked out of the room. Observers, including colleagues, called him \u201crobotic,\u201d \u201cgray,\u201d \u201cflat,\u201d \u201cthe Kremlin,\u201d \u201cSominex,\u201d \u201cAsshole,\u201d \u201cDoom and Gloom,\u201d \u201ca potted palm,\u201d and \u201cthe greatest enigma in sports.\u201d After two Patriots cheating scandals\u2014Spygate (2007) and Deflategate (2015)\u2014Shula started calling him \u201cBelicheat.\u201d\nThe split with the Patriots and the team\u2019s owner, Bob Kraft, was characterized as mutual. No one believed that. According to ESPN, the Atlanta Falcons came close to hiring Belichick; then Kraft warned the Falcons\u2019 owner that Belichick, whom he\u2019d worked with for a quarter century, was arrogant, untrustworthy, domineering, cold. Belichick got no offers. For the first time in forty-nine years, he spent football season not on the field but as a TV commentator\u2014a member of the media, which he\u2019d always seemed to despise.\nU.N.C., a twenty-eight-sport school that plays in the Atlantic Coast Conference, calls its athletic teams the Tar Heels, a reference to the distinctive footprints made by Colonial laborers who worked in turpentine distilleries. Carolina is a basketball school, and Chapel Hill is a basketball town. The men\u2019s team has won as many national championships as Belichick has Patriots-era Super Bowl rings. Shelby Swanson, a recent U.N.C. grad who was the sports editor for the Daily Tar Heel, Carolina\u2019s student newspaper, recently told me, \u201cI\u2019m from here. Both of my parents went to U.N.C. I just graduated from U.N.C. Basketball is the national brand.\u201d Football has always been \u201csort of an afterthought,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI mean no disrespect to the great players who\u2019ve come through here, but literally for the entirety of my life I don\u2019t think U.N.C. football has been nationally relevant.\u201d\nCarolina\u2019s football team has never won a national championship, and last won a conference title in 1980, when Lawrence Taylor played linebacker. Fans have been known to arrive at games late and leave early, if they come at all. Yet U.N.C. football has repeatedly, and wishfully, been called a \u201csleeping giant,\u201d as if all the team needed were a jolt.\nAt two o\u2019clock on the day that Cunningham sent his wife to Goodwill, Belichick\u2019s hiring was announced at a standing-room-only press conference on campus. U.N.C.\u2019s chancellor gave Belichick the sweatshirt; Cunningham got a laugh by putting on the mutilated jacket. Belichick calmly answered reporters\u2019 questions. When one asked whether he was biding his time until he could get back to the N.F.L., Belichick, without ripping the guy\u2019s head off, replied, \u201cI didn\u2019t come here to leave.\u201d\nHours after the announcement, an enterprising U.N.C. alum trademarked the nickname Chapel Bill. It zipped into circulation in the shops on Franklin Street, the backbone of Chapel Hill\u2019s historic core, where one need only step over a low stone wall to be on campus. U.N.C., the oldest public university in the United States, opened in 1795, predating the town that grew up around it. Chapel Hill, which is closer to Virginia than to South Carolina, sits midway between the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Atlantic Ocean, in forests so dense that, this time of year, one can lose sight of the horizon amid a disorienting spectrum of sun-soaked green. In June, Thad Dixon, a new Carolina defensive back and a Los Angeles native, referenced the \u201cculture shock\u201d of moving to Chapel Hill by saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of trees out here, bro.\u201d\nThe men\u2019s basketball team plays in the Dean Dome, which is named for Dean Smith, U.N.C.\u2019s most revered coach, who led the team from 1961 to 1997, winning two championships and thirteen A.C.C. tournament titles. Smith integrated Carolina basketball, and helped integrate Chapel Hill. He stressed team over self, a philosophy that became known as the Carolina Way. There is never any question of filling the Dean Dome. Cunningham decided to present Belichick there, on December 14th, at halftime of a game against La Salle.\nThe equipment manager had made another stop, at Julian\u2019s, a men\u2019s clothier that has been on Franklin Street since 1942. The store occupies a long ground-floor space fragrant with polished wood and good wool. The owner, Bart Fox, often works at a desk in the rear, where a muted television shows whatever Carolina game happens to be on. The equipment manager asked for sports jackets, shirts, and ties, telling Fox, \u201cYou have five minutes. He\u2019s gonna be on camera.\u201d\nFox assessed Belichick to be just shy of six feet tall, barrel-chested, and still \u201cmostly muscle,\u201d with none of the stooping that begins to happen to men in middle age. He selected a lightweight wool jacket in a hopsack weave that featured a tight pattern of light blue, medium blue, and eggshell, which together created the appearance of the official school color, Carolina blue, a color that must never be called baby blue or powder blue. Fox described it to me as the blue that a Chapel Hillian sees when looking up at the sky on a nice day. (But don\u2019t call it sky blue, either.) U.N.C. had tinkered with Carolina blue over the years, arriving at a slightly richer shade for uniforms: Pantone 542. Older alums griped, but optics prevailed\u2014the new version popped on television.\nAt the Dean Dome, the court cleared for halftime, and an m.c. stepped out with a mike. After congratulating the U.N.C. women\u2019s soccer team for its twenty-third national title, he introduced Belichick as \u201cone of, if not the, best ever.\u201d Belichick joined him and said, \u201cCan\u2019t wait to get started.\u201d He often mumbles and speaks so inaudibly that Swanson, the former Daily Tar Heel sports editor, told me she once had to borrow audio from someone who\u2019d placed a recording device directly beneath his mouth at a presser.\nThe crowd cheered, but I wouldn\u2019t say wildly. Julian\u2019s framed a photo of Belichick\u2019s appearance, pairing it with a mannequin outfitted in the clothing that Fox had selected, and added a sign: \u201cDress like coach!\u201d The sign was leaned against a larger framed image\u2014of Dean Smith, on the cover of Sports Illustrated, shown triumphantly cutting down a championship net.\nIn Chapel Hill, all kinds of things get painted Carolina blue: fences, buildings, hair, fire trucks. About twelve years ago, a contractor named Geary Blackwood hauled a massive flint rock to one of his properties, on a busy highway, to mark a row of mailboxes that kept getting mowed down. He decorated the rock with some leftover paint, which turned out to be \u201ckind of a darker blue,\u201d he told me. \u201cIn this part of the country, that doesn\u2019t sit too well with a lot of people.\u201d Dark blue is the color of U.N.C.\u2019s archrival, Duke, a private university in Durham, one town over.\nBlackwood recently went to a hardware store where an employee had become known for her ability to mix a proper Carolina blue, and bought new paint. At Walmart, he bought bucketloads of industrial glitter. While the paint was wet, he used a leaf blower to bedazzle the rock. \u201cWhen the sun hits it, it\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Blackwood told me. We were standing within sight of the rock on a nuclear afternoon in July; the surface did have the twinkling depth of a star-choked sky. I asked him why he\u2019d decided to repaint it now. He said that it was to honor Belichick\u2019s predecessor, Mack Brown\u2014\u201ca beautiful man.\u201d Blackwood, and a lot of others I met in Chapel Hill, felt that the university had treated Brown harshly at the end of his tenure. When I asked what he thought of Belichick, he said, \u201cI really like Mack Brown a lot.\u201d\nBlackwood climbed onto a front loader and drove it off the back of a flatbed truck. He and a crew had spent the morning working on a refurbishment project at Kenan Stadium, where the football team has played since 1927, and where the Belichick era will formally begin, on the evening of September 1st, when the Tar Heels host Texas Christian University. Season tickets sold out, even with a price hike of twenty-five per cent. Individual tickets have sold out, too. Gabe Feldman, a sports-law professor at Tulane, told me, \u201cThe attention on those first few games is going to be unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen in college sports. It\u2019s something people still can\u2019t quite wrap their heads around.\u201d Carolina football is being called \u201cthe thirty-third N.F.L. team\u201d before the first snap.\nThe author and sportswriter Art Chansky grew up in Newton, Massachusetts, near Boston. He moved to Chapel Hill in the seventies, to attend U.N.C., and stayed. As a longtime Patriots fan, he considered Belichick a \u201chero,\u201d he told me this summer. We were sitting on the patio at a chain restaurant called First Watch, eating from a hot skillet of blueberry-lemon cornbread. \u201cHe\u2019s a genius of the nuances of football,\u201d Chansky told me. \u201cBut can he get the players\u2014and enough of them? That\u2019s the big question. And can he coach them?\u201d Belichick has spent his entire career focussing on experienced, peak-conditioned professionals, not teen-agers weeks out of high school. Chansky wondered what might happen when Belichick inevitably \u201cgets tough on them.\u201d In recent years, the N.C.A.A. has streamlined the transfer process, making it relatively easy for a player who feels slighted to change schools in a huff. As a sports psychologist at U.N.C. once pointed out, the football players often present as grown men, but beneath the uniform \u201cthey\u2019re still college students.\u201d\nOr at least they\u2019re supposed to be. Student athletes are expected to balance competition with scholastics, a once sacrosanct ideal that\u2019s getting overshadowed as intercollegiate sports increasingly resembles the pros. A player who fails classes may lose a scholarship or a spot on a roster\u2014a coach is supposed to monitor academic performance\u2014but at this point all you hear about is money. In June, a federal court in California finalized a settlement, in House v. N.C.A.A., allowing colleges, for the first time, to share a certain percentage of athletic revenue with their players. U.N.C. athletics brought in a hundred and fifty-one million dollars in 2023-24, about half of which came from television rights and ticket sales. Per the House settlement, the school can now spend $20.5 million paying athletes, with an allowable annual increase of four per cent. (Football and men\u2019s basketball are expected to receive most of the money, because they earn the most.) Allocating a fixed amount of cash up and down a roster involves weighing the dollar value of each position; overspend on your quarterback and you\u2019ll have less money to attract the players necessary to support him. Belichick had to make such calculations constantly in the N.F.L., which has a salary cap.\nCollege sports was already being transformed by the \u201cname, image, and likeness\u201d rule, or N.I.L., which took effect in 2021, allowing student athletes to be compensated for appearances, autographs, and endorsements\u2014the kind of thing that used to result in penalties. That first year, the N.I.L. market was worth an estimated nine hundred and seventeen million dollars; it\u2019s now worth an estimated $2.3 billion. Star players have landed million-dollar deals with brands like Bose and 7-Eleven. Shedeur Sanders (of the Cleveland Browns) reportedly had an N.I.L. value of $4.8 million at the University of Colorado, where he played for his father, Deion. The U.N.C. quarterback Drake Maye (now of the Patriots) had deals with Jimmy\u2019s Famous Seafood and Zoa Energy, which is owned by Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson, and with Mitchell Heating and Cooling. In 2022, Maye, addressing rumors about courtship from other teams, told a reporter, \u201cSadly, I think money is becoming a reason why kids go places,\u201d and \u201cI think college football is going to turn into a mess.\u201d\nThis spring, the Times declared U.N.C. to be \u201cat the forefront of the next stage of the N.I.L. era.\u201d Carolina has more than eight hundred student athletes, and Article 41, a self-described \u201ctalent management and social training\u201d firm, was trying to turn all of them into influencers. Vickie Segar, a founder of the company, said that U.N.C. wants \u201cevery athlete at the school to make as much money as possible because it will get better athletes.\u201d In Chapel Hill, I heard people talking about athletes who drove brand-new vehicles, acquired from local dealers in exchange for social-media posts. Restaurants name dishes after players and let them eat for free. Alex Brandwein, the owner of Brandwein\u2019s Bagels, offers a gift card, branded swag, and, during finals, free bagels and coffee to any U.N.C. athlete who joins \u201cTeam Brandwein,\u201d which currently has a couple of hundred members. Brandwein, a native New Yorker and a U.N.C. business alum, who used to work in finance, told me, \u201cWe just want to give some shine and say thank you.\u201d Brandwein\u2019s loses nothing if a player leaves. At Chapel Hill Sportswear, on Franklin Street, Holly Dedmond, the store\u2019s longtime manager, showed me racks of unsalable N.I.L. merchandise tied to players who\u2019d wound up transferring.\nIn the N.F.L., Belichick had the draft, in which teams select from a pool of eligible players, who have little control over where they land; as a college coach, he has to recruit, which requires persuasion\u2014people skills. Belichick\u2019s forte has always been strategy. He learned that from his father, Steve Belichick, who was a legendary college scout. Steve spent two seasons as an assistant coach at U.N.C. (1953 to 1955) before taking an assistant-coaching job at the U.S. Naval Academy, in Annapolis, from which he ultimately retired after thirty-three years. He showed Belichick, an only child, how to break down game film when he was still in elementary school. In \u201cThe Education of a Coach,\u201d the journalist David Halberstam writes that Belichick had a coach\u2019s mind by age ten. \u201cAll I knew was college football,\u201d Belichick said at the U.N.C. presser. He showed off a vintage Carolina sweatshirt that he said had belonged to his dad. A photograph of Belichick as a toddler in the bleachers at Kenan Stadium was floating around. One had to strain to believe him when he claimed that his first words were \u201cBeat Duke.\u201d\nWhen I was in Chapel Hill this summer, the coaches and the players were away, but you could sense a large machine shifting gears. In the N.F.L., Belichick famously resisted hiring a general manager, but he had hired one at Carolina, Michael Lombardi, whom he has known since his days with the Browns. They were revamping the football facilities the way that an incoming President personalizes the White House. U.N.C. had replaced the stadium\u2019s body-wrecking synthetic turf with sixty-seven thousand square feet of Tahoma 31 Bermuda sod\u2014Belichick wants his team playing on real grass. There had also been talk of bringing back boxwood hedges, which once bordered the playing field and provided a snack for the team\u2019s wildly popular live mascot, Rameses, a Dorset ram whose curled horns its owners and handlers, the Hogans, an eleventh-generation farming family in Chapel Hill, ceremonially paint Carolina blue every autumn.\nReal grass requires more upkeep. U.N.C. recently hired its first chief revenue officer and will soon hire a new executive director of the Rams Club, the athletics booster organization. The Rams Club has raised more than three hundred and fifty million dollars since 2019\u2014some years up, some years down. Dedmond, the Franklin Street sportswear merchant, and a U.N.C. alum, told me, \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned in the past thirty years, it\u2019s that even though some of us Carolina fans are true blue, down to the core, there are plenty more that are bandwagon fans. If your team got beat bad on Saturday afternoon, you\u2019re not gonna proudly wear your Carolina polo to work on Monday morning. That\u2019s a real thing. People get embarrassed and ashamed, and they will put their Carolina stuff in the very back of the closet if the team\u2019s not winning.\u201d Chansky, the sportswriter, told me, \u201cHiring Bill Belichick is either one of the greatest hires that any school has ever made or it\u2019s the biggest embarrassment that U.N.C. will ever have.\u201d\nEverywhere I went in Chapel Hill, people wanted to talk about \u201cthe girlfriend,\u201d or, as one woman, a highly educated medical professional, put it, \u201cthat Jordon person.\u201d She meant Jordon Hudson, whom Belichick has been dating for a few years and who is twenty-four\u2014forty-nine years his junior. Belichick has three children, and all of them are older than Hudson: Amanda, the head coach of women\u2019s lacrosse at Holy Cross, in Massachusetts, is in her early forties; Steve and Brian, former Patriots coaches who have joined Belichick\u2019s U.N.C. staff, are in their thirties. The Belichick children are products of Belichick\u2019s only marriage, to Debby Clarke Belichick, whom he met in high school and married in 1977. She owns an interior-design firm in Massachusetts and was rarely mentioned in connection with Belichick\u2019s N.F.L. career. Chansky believes that football is \u201cold-fashioned,\u201d and told me that fans preferred coaches to have wives and girlfriends who \u201cnever said peep.\u201d\nIn February, 2007, not long after Bill and Debby divorced \u201cquietly and amicably,\u201d as Halberstam put it, the Post reported that Belichick had been named in a New Jersey divorce case concerning a former receptionist for the New York Giants, where Belichick won his first two Super Bowl rings, as defensive co\u00f6rdinator. Belichick had been sending the woman \u201cabout $3,000 a month\u201d for several years, and had provided her with a \u201c$25,000 Jersey Shore summer rental\u201d and \u201ca private jet to Disney World.\u201d He\u2019d also bought her a \u201csecret $2.2 million Park Slope town house\u201d with \u201cstained-glass windows and parquet floors.\u201d (The woman has called Belichick a \u201cfamily friend.\u201d)\nThat year, Belichick met a new friend, Linda Holliday. She was a decade younger than him, with twin teen-age daughters. She owned a clothing boutique and was a former Mrs. Little Rock who\u2019d gone on to be runner-up in the Mrs. Arkansas pageant. Belichick and Holliday began dating, and spent time together in Florida and in Hingham, down the shore from Boston and not far from Foxborough, where the Patriots play. They also hung out on Nantucket, where Belichick lived in the off-season and, according to the Boston Globe, has amassed ten million dollars\u2019 worth of property. A friend of Holliday\u2019s told me that Belichick sometimes attended gatherings, and hosted the occasional crab boil, but that he preferred private, more solitary activities, like paddleboarding.\nIn 2013, Holliday became president of the newly created Bill Belichick Foundation, which supported youth-sports organizations. She appeared with Belichick on red carpets and at Patriots events, once wearing a custom-made Patriots hoodie with \u201cBELICHICK\u201d spelled out in Swarovski crystals. In the summer of 2017, the couple got the cover of Nantucket Magazine, with the headline \u201cBelichick & Holliday: America\u2019s Winningest Team.\u201d The publication declared Holliday the \u201ckryptonite to soften the steeliest coach in the game.\u201d Belichick called her \u201cthe rose next to the thorn.\u201d\nBelichick was on the verge of a tumultuous period. In 2020, the Patriots\u2019 star quarterback, Tom Brady, left the team and then signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Belichick had taken Brady in the sixth round of the draft, in 2000, and helped him develop into the greatest quarterback of all time; many wondered what the Patriots would be without him. In 2021, Tampa won the Super Bowl, and Brady got ring No. 7. The Patriots, meanwhile, were struggling. A former Patriots cornerback, Asante Samuel, Jr., tweeted that, with Brady gone, Belichick was \u201cjust another coach.\u201d\nFour days after Brady\u2019s seventh Super Bowl win, Belichick met Hudson, on a commercial flight from Boston to Palm Beach. She was a student at Bridgewater State University, where she cheered competitively, and she had just been licensed as a cosmetologist. Hudson later posted a photograph of an inscription that Belichick had made in her \u201cDeductive Logic\u201d textbook: \u201cThanks for giving me a course on logic!\u201d Below his signature, he listed the Super Bowls that he\u2019d won with the Patriots. He repeated one, naming seven, not six\u2014a curious mistake from a guy known for his fastidiousness.\nIn the 2022 season, the Patriots went 8\u20139, and failed to make the playoffs, for the second time in three years. In January, 2023, a video surfaced online, showing Belichick walking in New Orleans with a woman who turned out to be Hudson. \u201cLinda was shocked,\u201d Holliday\u2019s friend told me. \u201cShe had no idea there was another girl.\u201d That fall, People reported that Holliday and Belichick had separated.\nAnother video soon went around, showing Ring footage of Belichick, shirtless, leaving an Airbnb on the Massachusetts coast, where he and Hudson had reportedly vacationed. By the time it appeared, Belichick was in what would be his final season with the Patriots, and was headed for his worst record in twenty-four years with the team. He had another year on his contract, worth twenty-five million dollars. The Patriots again failed to make the playoffs. Belichick departed the organization.\nHalberstam had written that Belichick was \u201cuneasy about and distrustful of the world of modern media and public relations precisely because he saw it as a world of people wanting to know the wrong things about him and his players. It wanted him to be more charismatic. There was a great contradiction here: He was ferociously driven, and his drive had made him a singular success, and his success had made him a celebrity,\u201d which he \u201cmost demonstrably did not want to be.\u201d Belichick was so resistant to social media that he dismissed Instagram as \u201cInstaface.\u201d He was so private that, according to Halberstam, he once barked at a reporter for daring to ask how one of his kids was doing after a tonsillectomy.\nYet, once he and Hudson were dating, he started to appear in her social-media posts, in scenarios that seemed starkly out of character. On Instagram, he allowed himself to be seen in a Halloween costume: a fisherman pretending to catch Hudson, a mermaid. In another picture, he lay on a beach with his legs up, balancing Hudson like an airplane, which is both a form of acroyoga and the game that parents play with very small children. (Last week, Belichick said that his players at U.N.C. have been using yoga as part of their post-training recovery regimen.) As recently as 2018, the Globe had declared, \u201cHis image is rarely for sale. No Dunkin\u2019 Donuts spots. No how-to books. No exclusive line of hoodies.\u201d But, during this year\u2019s Super Bowl, there was Belichick\u2014in a Dunkin\u2019 ad, with Hudson. Her L.L.C., Trouble Cub Enterprises, filed paperwork to trademark famous Belichickisms. \u201cNo days off!\u201d and \u201cDo your job!\u201d had already been nabbed, by the Patriots, as had \u201cChapel Bill,\u201d by the U.N.C. alum, a lawyer in Manhattan. Hudson borrowed a Taylor Swift workaround: \u201cChapel Bill (Bill\u2019s Version).\u201d The press reported that she was scooping up millions of dollars\u2019 worth of real estate in Massachusetts.\nThis past December, Hudson showed up at a popular Christmas gala on Nantucket, where Holliday\u2019s daughters were d.j.\u2019ing. Hudson was with the reigning Miss Massachusetts U.S.A., who had on a sash and a tiara. Friends of Holliday\u2019s\u2014and then Holliday herself\u2014asked Hudson to leave. She refused, and the confrontation got heated enough that an employee of the venue wrote an internal incident report, which TMZ later published. The report noted that Hudson \u201cwas a paying guest\u201d and that \u201cno concerns had been raised regarding her behavior.\u201d The employee nevertheless escorted Hudson out and wrote that Holliday said, at the time, \u201cIf this didn\u2019t involve my girls, I don\u2019t think this would have bothered me as much,\u201d adding, \u201cThe \u2018momma bear\u2019 in me came out.\u201d\nHolliday declined to speak with me. Elin Hilderbrand, a novelist and a friend of Holliday\u2019s, who was part of the group that asked Hudson to leave the event, told me, \u201cNo punches were thrown, no hair was pulled. But we did suggest she leave because we thought it was grossly inappropriate for her to be there.\u201d She explained, \u201cBill and Linda were together since the girls were, like, fourteen years old, and they thought of him as a father figure.\u201d\nThe week following the gala, Belichick was announced as U.N.C.\u2019s next head football coach. Almost immediately, Hudson became a presence in university matters. Belichick asked a member of the athletics-communications staff to include her on all his e-mail correspondence. HBO was considering featuring U.N.C. and Belichick on \u201cHard Knocks,\u201d a series that typically profiles an N.F.L. team in the run-up to the season opener, until Hudson was said to have demanded an executive-producer title, and the plan fell through. (Belichick, through a university spokesperson, said that the show\u2019s format \u201cdid not fit what we wanted to do.\u201d)\nIn April, during the Tar Heels\u2019 spring training, Hudson accompanied Belichick to a public event called Practice Like a Pro, where she stalked on and off the field officiously, miking Belichick and flashing people the thumbs-up. Critics noted her miniskirt, duster, and tall white spike-heeled boots. One wrote, \u201cSome kid is gonna tear an MCL tripping on a divot she left in the turf.\u201d Other barbs included \u201cattention seeking,\u201d \u201cGold digger,\u201d \u201cMeghan Markle vibes,\u201d \u201chow did we get from Dean Smith to this?!,\u201d and \u201cYour football program is now officially a punchline.\u201d Chansky, who is in his late seventies, told me, \u201cIt\u2019s fine with me if Belichick wants to have a twenty-four-year-old girlfriend, but you can\u2019t have one who\u2019s getting all the headlines.\u201d He added, \u201cThere\u2019s still an understanding around here that you do things with a certain tone to it.\u201d Belichick later told Michael Strahan, a down pillow of an interviewer, that Hudson represented his personal business interests only. In another interview, he insisted that Hudson \u201cdoesn\u2019t have anything to do with U.N.C. football.\u201d\nBelichick had a memoir forthcoming, \u201cThe Art of Winning,\u201d about his nearly fifty years with the N.F.L. In late April, he appeared on \u201cCBS News Sunday Morning\u201d to promote the book. Hudson accompanied him and watched the interview in progress. When Belichick was asked how they\u2019d met, she interjected, \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about this,\u201d then reportedly stormed out and asked Belichick to come along. The clip went viral.\nHudson was ridiculed as overbearing and defensive. On Instagram, the comedian Nikki Glaser remarked that she appeared to have been simply acting as Belichick\u2019s publicist; an account attributed to Belichick\u2019s daughter-in-law Jen Belichick, who\u2019s married to Steve, replied, \u201cPublicists act in a professional manner and don\u2019t \u2018storm\u2019 off set delaying an interview.\u201d\nCharlotte Wilder, who had been dissecting the Belichick-Hudson affair with Madeline Hill on their podcast, \u201cThe Sports Gossip Show,\u201d told CNN, \u201cIf I were the parent of a student athlete and I saw a coach whose public narrative is completely out of control, I would ask, \u2018Why are you the guy who can then guide my children through this program?\u2019 \u201d In May, Wilder and Hill showed up in Maine to watch Hudson compete in the Miss Maine U.S.A. pageant, and then did an episode about it. (Last year, Hudson was the pageant\u2019s runner-up. This year, she came in third; Belichick watched from the front row.) One night last month, according to Wilder, her phone rang. To her surprise, it was Hudson. Wilder says that she and Hill had several conversations with her, hoping to land an on-air interview. Then they did an episode about the phone calls, saying that, after some \u201cyelling\u201d and \u201ccrying,\u201d Hudson had eventually gone silent.\nBelichick declined, through U.N.C., to speak with me, and when I tried to reach Hudson, also through U.N.C., I got no response. She sometimes claps back at her detractors (\u201cKeep swinging, Keyboard Warriors\u201d), though she became somewhat less visible after the pileup of embarrassments led U.N.C. faculty members and donors to express concerns about the school\u2019s reputation. According to the Raleigh News & Observer, one U.N.C. law professor asked Cunningham, the athletic director, \u201cWhat amount of pride are we willing to sacrifice for (perhaps) a few more wins per year? What happened to the Carolina Way?\u201d A local real-estate agent, Shenandoah Nieuwsma, who has a Ph.D. in religious studies from U.N.C., told me, of Belichick, \u201cThe only way he can dig himself out of this is by winning.\u201d\nAt least one of Chansky\u2019s books, on Dean Smith and racial integration, is taught in U.N.C.\u2019s history department, but he told me that he specializes in \u201cshort form.\u201d He gets to the point in conversation, too. We had barely sat down to our blueberry cornbread when he mentioned President Donald Trump: \u201cPardon my French, but this fucking country elected him\u2014twice! It\u2019s beyond my belief! This town is as divided as any place, but it\u2019s mostly blue.\u201d\nThe President may have been on Chansky\u2019s mind because of how Belichick got his new job. \u201cRemember, he wasn\u2019t their first pick,\u201d a host on NESN, the New England Sports Network, recently said. It has been widely reported that U.N.C. did not go to Belichick; Belichick went to the U.S. Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, the former senator from Florida. (Belichick owns a condo in Jupiter, near Palm Beach.) Rubio told Thom Tillis, who represents North Carolina in the Senate, that Belichick was looking for a \u201cschool with a sterling academic reputation that would allow him to build a program towards a national championship,\u201d the News & Observer reported. Tillis then contacted the North Carolina Senate\u2019s president pro tem, whose former chief of staff was the U.N.C. system\u2019s general counsel. WRAL, in Raleigh, noted the development by saying that U.N.C. leaders \u201cpushed back\u201d on a \u201csuggestion that the well worn path between the General Assembly and Chapel Hill represents a good-ol\u2019-boy system.\u201d On NESN, a host put it this way: \u201cBill bullied his way into the job.\u201d\nBelichick, who has known Trump for more than twenty years, publicly backed him in 2016. I met Chapel Hillians who suspected that this affinity, which appeared to involve a mutual hatred of the press, didn\u2019t hurt him with U.N.C., whose governing board has close ties to wealthy Republicans. Nieuwsma, the real-estate agent, told me, \u201cA lot of faculty, and the general public, are kind of upset about the way the administration at U.N.C. is going.\u201d In a recent editorial, the Daily Tar Heel pointed out that U.N.C.\u2019s chancellor, Lee H. Roberts, who served as the state\u2019s budget director from 2014 to 2016, had supported allocating \u201cthe lowest share of funding to higher education since 1981,\u201d and suggested that, among other things, he favored \u201cmillionaires at the expense of working-class North Carolinians,\u201d including low-income students at U.N.C.\nU.N.C. is paying Belichick fifty million dollars over five years, making him, by orders of magnitude, the highest-paid public employee in the state. \u201cPlease explain how UNC is suddenly so flush with money?\u201d a U.N.C. economics professor, Peter Norman, asked university officials this spring, according to the News & Observer, whose journalists obtained e-mails about Belichick via open-records requests. Norman wondered how U.N.C. could afford to pay its football coach ten million dollars a year when academic departments were \u201calways told that there are not enough funds to hire the number of professors that we need.\u201d There was a rumor that Belichick, who can buy out his own contract for a million dollars, had taken the Carolina job on the condition that his son Steve, the Tar Heels\u2019 defensive co\u00f6rdinator, succeed him. Steve is being paid $1.3 million. Brian Belichick, who also coaches defense, makes half a million dollars. The state pays the average U.N.C.-system professor a hundred and twelve thousand dollars a year.\nWhen the news of Belichick\u2019s hiring went public, Matthew Andrews, a U.N.C. professor who focusses on the intersection of sports and history, was at a pub. \u201cThere were these five middle-aged guys at the bar, and they stood up and high-fived and were jumping up and down,\u201d he told me. \u201cI was, like, Oh, I guess some people are actually quite excited about this. If you think football is the most important thing ever, you\u2019re pretty excited about Bill Belichick. And if you think that we waste a lot of time talking about football, and that football is a symptom of many problems, you\u2019re down on the Belichick era.\u201d\nI had run into Andrews at a coffee shop, where he was chatting with Swanson, the former Daily Tar Heel sports editor, who was leaving the next morning for a summer internship at the Minnesota Star Tribune. They were sitting outside, beneath a dense canopy and near thickets of ivy, where a sign warned of copperhead snakes. Andrews, who has taught at U.N.C. since the late nineties, told me about \u201cthe Matt Doherty years,\u201d in the early aughts\u2014a dark time of bad basketball. \u201cSports bars went out of business,\u201d he said. \u201cThey rely on these nights when people come in and spend a hundred dollars each, on beer and wings. I knew sports were emotionally important. I didn\u2019t realize how financially important they are to the community.\u201d Yet Andrews didn\u2019t want Belichick\u2014or his girlfriend\u2014to become \u201cthe face of this town and this university,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m already uneasy with football coaches being the face of universities.\u201d\nA contingent in Chapel Hill, Andrews went on, wants the football team to fail. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to be a football school,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe want to be a basketball school.\u201d In the evolving ecosystem of college sports, universities like Carolina will need to be both. \u201cI realized this when Alabama beat us for the third year in a row in basketball,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cI\u2019m, like, Wait a minute. Alabama is not supposed to beat us in basketball. Then it\u2019s, like, Oh, their football money is buying basketball players.\u201d He looked at Swanson and said, \u201cIf we\u2019re not good at basketball, what are we?\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to Olympic-sport coaches and there\u2019s two schools of thought,\u201d Swanson replied. \u201cOne is that we want to make sure our sports are prioritized and funded, and when we see that so much money is dedicated to football\u2014we disagree with that. Another school of thought is that there\u2019ll be a trickle-down effect.\u201d\n\u201cWhat it doesn\u2019t trickle down to is the history department,\u201d Andrews said.\nOne Saturday, I dropped by Lapin Bleu, which calls itself \u201ca JAZZ BAR with a HOCKEY PROBLEM.\u201d The owner, Mike Benson, was sitting with a few regulars, watching a television with the sound off. Carolina\u2019s baseball team was in the seventh inning of game two of the super regionals, against Arizona. The team was trying to return to Omaha, for the College World Series, for the second year in a row. On another TV, \u201cJaws\u201d was showing. Roy Scheider had just learned that he was gonna need a bigger boat.\nThe House v. N.C.A.A. settlement had been finalized a day earlier. One of Benson\u2019s friends, Chip Hoppin, a fifty-year-old screen-printer who was drinking Guinness, whirled around on his barstool and said that he strongly supported paying student athletes but that money was \u201cruining all of sports, honestly.\u201d He said, \u201cWould you pay any seventeen- or eighteen-year-old to do anything\u2014carpentry, play an instrument at your wedding\u2014before the job\u2019s done? No!\u201d He preferred an incentive model: win a conference or a national championship, here\u2019s a bonus. College football had become a free-for-all because of \u201crich old white guys with so much money they don\u2019t give a fuck about anything.\u201d\n\u201cThey give a shit about winning,\u201d Benson said.\n\u201cThey care about selling concessions and selling seats\u2014to them, that\u2019s winning,\u201d Hoppin said, adding, \u201cWhen I win the lottery, I\u2019m gonna be the most humanitarian motherfucker on the planet.\u201d Of Belichick, he said, \u201cMotherfucker\u2019s a Trumper. You think he cares about people?\u201d\nBenson\u2019s girlfriend came in with their dog, Cowboy. Arizona scored four runs, and took the lead. On the other TV, the shark hunters spent a tense night in their creaking boat, singing \u201cShow Me the Way to Go Home.\u201d Hoppin, moving on to \u201cthe freaking real-estate market,\u201d said, \u201cWho can buy a house right now? No one! Houses cost a million dollars. They\u2019re not seventy thousand dollars anymore. Your kids literally can\u2019t keep their eyes off their screens. You\u2019re expecting them to go off into the workforce and actually work? When\u2019s the last time anything was made in America? Everyone\u2019s, like, \u2018We\u2019re gonna bring factories back!\u2019 It takes twenty years to bring back industry!\u201d\n\u201cI disagree,\u201d Benson said. \u201cThere is a factory that\u2019s thriving in America. It\u2019s called the Cheesecake Factory.\u201d\n\u201cDo you realize that hundreds of Latinos, at every single construction site, are getting shipped out of here, arrested?\u201d Hoppin said. \u201cWhat are all these contractors\u2014who are Republicans, by the way, who voted for Trump\u2014gonna do? Where are all the white people lining up for these jobs? Where are all the white people lining up to pick lettuce and rutabagas and shit? Mike\u2019s, like, \u2018Chip, shut up, just have fun, drink another beer, everything\u2019s fine.\u2019 \u201d\nBenson said, \u201cThat\u2019s pretty true.\u201d\n\u201cWe can go back to the Roman times,\u201d Hoppin went on. \u201cDo you think the senators gave a shit who won in the Colosseum? No! They built the Colosseum to keep the people at bay, so they wouldn\u2019t revolt. They\u2019re trying to keep poor people entertained while they take all their freaking money. It\u2019s as old as the freaking hills\u2014give them entertainment.\u201d\nAt the baseball game, the camera panned to Roy Williams, who spent eighteen years as Carolina\u2019s basketball coach. When he retired, in 2021, one of his assistant coaches, Hubert Davis\u2014who played for Dean Smith before going to the New York Knicks in the first round of the 1992 N.B.A. draft\u2014replaced him. Williams was sitting in the sun-beaten stands with a wet cloth around his neck. Belichick had been seen on the field, shaking the coach\u2019s hand, before presumably watching the game from an air-conditioned suite. Carolina lost, and would lose again the next day, and not get to go to Omaha.\nBenson sent me to visit Scott Maitland, the owner of Top of the Hill, a bar-and-grill that, for the past twenty years, has hosted a live radio show on the Monday before every U.N.C. football game. A popular order there is a \u201cblue and white\u201d\u2014half blueberry beer, half Belgian-style white. Maitland and I each ordered one. He showed me where the football coach sits, at the front of the restaurant, to chat with an interviewer as a hundred or so fans watch, over drinks and food. Maitland pays a broadcast company about twenty-five thousand dollars for seasonal hosting rights. When I asked if he expected Belichick to uphold the tradition, he joked, \u201cWhat, in his professional career, makes you think he likes doing shows?\u201d On the other hand, Maitland said, Belichick might be inclined to do it because the show features \u201cnot, like, real reporters.\u201d\nMaitland, who grew up east of Los Angeles, graduated from West Point, where he captained the water-polo team. He deployed to the first Gulf War. In 1996, after finishing law school at U.N.C., he opened Top of the Hill in order to spare Franklin Street the arrival of a TGI Fridays franchise. He told me, \u201cThe concept of a student athlete\u2014that\u2019s important to me. Unfortunately, that era is gone.\u201d The school letters on a team jersey used to be more important than the name on the back, he said, adding, \u201cYou could ride that idea down to the bottom of the ocean, or embrace the new.\u201d\nOn July 24th, coaches and players assembled in Charlotte, two hours southwest of Chapel Hill, for the annual pre-season blitz of appearances and interviews known as the A.C.C. Football Kickoff. That morning, Belichick emerged from a black S.U.V. at the Uptown Hilton, wearing a dark sports coat and a Carolina-blue tie. My first impression of him was that, in person, he is smaller than you\u2019d expect, and that he looked both relaxed and tanned.\nThe A.C.C. had issued a record number of media credentials for the event, and hired extra security. Belichick bypassed \u201cradio row,\u201d a nest of hosts in headphones sitting at placarded tables (Wake Up Warchant, iHeartRadio), and went to the TV floor, where there were studio sets and rows of mannequins dressed in the uniforms of all seventeen A.C.C. teams.\nIn Charlotte Hall, an auditorium, each head coach took turns appearing onstage with a few top players. Dabo Swinney, of Clemson, the defending A.C.C. champion, filled almost every seat. He is as gregarious as Belichick is stony, and is the winningest head coach in conference history. In 1992, he played on a championship S.E.C. team, at the University of Alabama, where he was twice named an Academic All-S.E.C. scholar-athlete. Swinney went on to earn an M.B.A., in case football didn\u2019t work out. He had walked on at Alabama\u2014a phenomenon that almost certainly will die now that every roster position in college football demands a dollar value.\n\u201cOur purpose is graduation, number one,\u201d Swinney declared. \u201cNumber two is to equip \u2019em, as men, through the game. Number three is to make sure they have a great college experience. Lastly is to win a championship.\u201d Other college football coaches often gesture at this hierarchy; Swinney conveys it with an evangelist\u2019s zeal. Last year, he told a Clemson publication, \u201cNinety-eight percent of these kids are not going to play in the NFL. We need to educate our young people in this society.\u201d Sixteen years ago, Swinney began implementing a life-skills curriculum for Clemson football players, which centralizes instruction on everything from financial literacy and community service to \u201chow to tie a tie, how to have a nice dinner\u2014to r\u00e9sum\u00e9, to how to do an interview,\u201d as he put it onstage. He recruited players who \u201calign with our purpose, guys that really value education and want structure and family and accountability.\u201d\nBelichick moved nowhere without a scrum. Observers in lanyards clocked his every twitch. Sports Illustrated noted that his pocket square was \u201ctucked in a little too far.\u201d The Athletic watched him sugar his iced tea and ask the staff of the ESPN booth for popcorn. I was standing outside Charlotte Hall when the energy shifted and he materialized, and strode past, encircled by an entourage, then disappeared into a greenroom.\nThree of his star players settled themselves onto stools onstage, at which point such a hush befell the auditorium that I joked with a TV cameraman, \u201cAre we in church?\u201d Belichick took the stage in utter silence. He broke the tension by throwing his arms up over his eyes, joking about the glare of the lights. He spoke for four minutes and fourteen seconds. He touched on the \u201cgreat brand\u201d of U.N.C., donor events, N.I.L., revenue sharing, the N.F.L. draft, scouting, competition, the physical condition of his roster, the transfer portal, and the importance of \u201cstacking good training days.\u201d Zero mention of the purpose of college.\nThe coverage was fawning. One newspaper declared Belichick\u2019s appearance a \u201cwatershed moment\u201d reminiscent of the excitement surrounding standout A.C.C. basketball tournaments, including one in 1982 when James Worthy and Michael Jordan played on the same U.N.C. team. Chansky called Belichick \u201calmost human.\u201d The flamethrowing commentator Paul Finebaum, meanwhile, predicted that Carolina football was \u201cnot going to be must-see TV.\u201d Of Belichick, he proclaimed, \u201cThe end of his career was a disaster. He didn\u2019t win a playoff game in his last five seasons. He had losing seasons three out of the last five. It was a mess at the end. He should have been fired earlier than he was.\u201d Belichick was now \u201cjust trying to make good,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to impress his girlfriend. He\u2019s trying to make some money.\u201d\nFinebaum\u2019s network, ESPN, had just arranged to show the first three games of Belichick\u2019s inaugural season at U.N.C. ESPN, which is owned by Disney, had also committed to doing a live pre-game show on the sidelines at the season opener. The financial details were not immediately revealed, but it was already known that ESPN had extended its relationship with the A.C.C. through 2035, in a contract worth $3.6 billion.\nWatching Belichick from the back of the auditorium, I saw Cunningham, the U.N.C. athletic director, whom I\u2019d been trying to reach, slip into the second-to-last row. I tapped him on the shoulder. The next day, I visited him on campus, in his office, a second-floor corner space with picture windows. Outside, red-tailed hawks were wheeling about, hunting.\nSomeone in the general counsel\u2019s office had recently used a word that Cunningham liked\u2014\u201climinality\u201d\u2014when referring to this crazy period in college athletics, and Cunningham repeated it to me. \u201cIt\u2019s not defined yet, what our future looks like,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe firmly believe that the investment that we\u2019re making in football right now is more than going to pay for itself.\u201d\nThe university had been brainstorming everything from selling jersey advertising space to stadium naming rights, according to the Assembly, a Raleigh-based news outlet that had learned these details through public-records requests. Maybe U.N.C. would raise the price of parking, or reduce the number of complimentary tickets, or bring multimedia promotional operations in house. There was talk of a \u201cre-imagined basketball arena\u201d: replacing the Dean Dome with a \u201cmixed-used development\u201d that includes premium seating.\nThe schools with the best resources will get the top talent. When coaches are recruiting, they\u2019ll have to do better than a masseuse and a new locker room. The more successful the team, the more attractive it becomes to television and, potentially, to other N.C.A.A. conferences. Those conferences, previously bound by geography and historic rivalry, have been disbanding and morphing\u2014who\u2019d have thought that Stanford and Berkeley would wind up in the A.C.C.? Networks dictate game time, which, as Andrews, the history professor, mentioned, ripples out to the community, particularly the food-and-beverage industry. Restaurateurs in Chapel Hill told me that they much prefer a three-o\u2019clock kickoff, which allows them to make more money by drawing crowds at both lunch and dinner. Antoni Sustaita, who founded the Mexican restaurant Bandido\u2019s thirty years ago, in a basement space in the heart of Franklin Street, said that for home games \u201cwe staff up. Or, if the team\u2019s no good, we reduce staff. There\u2019s no proven way to do it. It\u2019s a gut instinct. The one thing we do know is that if it\u2019s anything that involves Duke\u2014\u201d He didn\u2019t even have to finish the sentence.\nWhen I met Cunningham, U.N.C. had just announced that next year he will move to a newly created position in the chancellor\u2019s office, where he will help to oversee the diversification of revenue streams. The new athletic director is Steve Newmark, a former auto-racing executive whose teams competed on the Nascar circuit. He advised the school during the Belichick hiring process. His specialty is corporate sponsorships. \u2666"

      "text": "The holiday spirit apparently did not stop a tense scene between Bill Belichick\u2019s current girlfriend and his ex last December at a Nantucket, Massachusetts party.\nLinda Holliday confronted Jordon Hudson on the dance floor after asking the organizers of the shindig to remove her from the gathering, TMZ reported on Tuesday night.\nAccording to a Dec. 6, 2024, incident report obtained by the outlet, Nantucket Dreamland \u2014 a non-profit \u201cdedicated to enriching the cultural and intellectual life\u201d of the area \u2014 said Holliday was irked by Hudson\u2019s presence at the event and asked for her removal from the premises.\nHolliday\u2019s daughters, Ashley and Kat Hess, were DJing the \u201cStroll Party.\u201d\n\u201cMs. Hudson was a paying guest. No concerns had been raised regarding her behavior nor had any issues been reported up until that point in the evening (the event began at 7pm),\u201d a staffer wrote in the incident report, which also said Hudson was there with Miss Massachusetts USA 2024 Melissa Sapini. \u201cMs. Holliday felt her presence was inappropriate, since the event was widely advertised as a party headlined by her daughters. She asked that I remove Ms. Hudson from the premises, to which I responded that I would speak with Ms. Hudson after contacting Dreamland executive director Alicia Carney to discuss the matter.\u201d\nAfter making the request to have Hudson removed, Holliday and two other women confronted Belichick\u2019s girlfriend on the dance floor, where she was among 200 other guests of the event, according to security footage.\nCarney said she observed \u201cthreatening body language and escalating aggression\u201d from Holliday and one of the other women with her toward Hudson.\nThe staffer who wrote the report then said Hudson was asked if it was a good idea to be there in the face of the clear \u201canimosity\u201d toward her, with Hudson responding that she hadn\u2019t done anything wrong and was just hoping to be at the \u201cbig party.\u201d\nAfter some back and forth, Hudson agreed to let the staffer walk her and Sapini from the party minutes before the lights were set to come on.\nNevertheless, Hudson said Holliday told Sapini that if she \u201cvalued her current title, she should think twice about who her friends are,\u201d the incident report said before adding that she \u201chad many powerful friends in the pageant organization.\u201d\nThis left Sapini in tears.\nAs Hudson and Sapini exited, Holliday thanked the party staffer, saying the \u201cmomma bear\u201d in her came out because of her daughters\u2019 involvement in the festivities.\nAfter the event, Holliday shared a series of pictures to Instagram with the caption: \u201cAnother Nantucket Stroll in the books!\u201d\nThe TMZ report comes one day after Page Six reported that Hudson was being \u201ciced out\u201d while trying to make inroads in the Nantucket social and charity scenes.\n\u201cHis ex, Linda, is working the philanthropic and social circles and she [Hudson] wants to get more involved,\u201d a Nantucket society source told Page Six.\n\u201cShe\u2019s trying to claim her stake in the social circle. That is Linda\u2019s thing.\u201d\nAnother source told Page Six that \u201cNo one is going to be welcoming [Hudson] with open arms.\u201d\nIt\u2019s been weeks of headline-making news for Hudson and her boyfriend, the new coach of the University of North Carolina football.\nAt the end of April, the two caused a stir during Belichick\u2019s awkward \u201cCBS Sunday Morning\u201d interview in which Hudson stopped a question where the coach was asked how he and his girlfriend met.\nThen came a podcast from ex-ESPNer Pablo Torre, which, among the many claims, said Hudson was no longer welcome in UNC\u2019s football facilities.\nThe school later denied that claim.\nBelichick, while speaking on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d last week, tried to clarify Hudson\u2019s role.\n\u201cShe\u2019s been terrific through the whole process, and she\u2019s been really helpful to me,\u201d Belichick said. \u201cShe does the business things that don\u2019t relate to North Carolina that come up in my life, so I can concentrate football and that\u2019s really what I want to do.\u201d\nOn Tuesday, the New York Times reported that Hudson told at least one person that she and Belichick got engaged.\nBelichick and Holiday ended things in September 2023 after 16 years together."

Linda is Bill\u2019s ex for a reason, he\u2019s moved on, he\u2019s looking forward to the upcoming UNC season and he is madly in love with Jordon,\u201d the insider said of Holliday, whose breakup with Belichick, 73, was reported in 2023 after 16 years together.\n\u201cThey are having an incredible time together. That is what Bill\u2019s thoughts are directed toward.\u201d\nBelichick, currently preparing for his first season as football coach of the Tar Heels, went public with his romance with Hudson in 2024, three years after they met on a flight.\nThe pair has been at the center of intense media scrutiny since revealing their relationship, with Hudson at the center of the news cycle in May after it was reported Holliday had confronted her at a festive Nantucket party in December.\nIn an incident report obtained by TMZ, Holliday told a staffer, \u201cshe was upset by the presence of Jordon Hudson,\u201d believing \u201cher presence was inappropriate, since the event was widely advertised as a party headlined by her daughters,\u201d and requested the former college cheerleader\u2019s removal.\nHolliday and other guests confronted Hudson inside the venue later in the evening, according to the report.\nWhen a staffer inquired if Hudson \u201cthought it was a good idea to be there considering the clear animosity\u201d displayed by select partygoers, she \u201cdefended herself by saying she\u2019d done nothing wrong.\u201d\nHudson hasn\u2019t shied away from the Nantucket social scene following the December clash, having frequented the same Massachusetts fundraiser as Holliday earlier this month.\nTMZ reported that \u201cno issues were seen by partygoers.\u201d\n\u201cIf Jordon happens to be in the same spots as Linda, that\u2019s just life.
