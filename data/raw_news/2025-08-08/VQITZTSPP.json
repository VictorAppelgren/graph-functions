  "description": "The DOJ opened a grand jury investigation in New York into state Attorney General Letitia James tied to her lawsuit against President Donald Trump.",
  "content": "The Department of Justice convened a grand jury to investigate New York Attorney General Letitia James, marking an escalation in President Donald Trump's fight with New York's top prosecutor.\n\nThe investigation is being run out of Albany, New York, and focused on possible deprivation of rights allegations, two well-placed sources familiar with the probe told Fox News Digital.\n\nThe investigation is in an early stage, but Fox News Digital has learned that James's office received subpoenas for documents this week, including for information related to her civil fraud lawsuit against Trump.\n\nJames, a Democrat who was elected attorney general in 2018, has long been a target of Trump. James successfully brought civil charges against him for business fraud in 2022 and has had an instrumental role in challenging his current administration's executive actions in court.\n\nJames's office did not respond to requests for comment about the investigation.\n\nNY AG'S OFFICE HIRES ATTORNEY THAT REPPED HUNTER BIDEN TO DEFEND LETITIA JAMES AGAINST FRAUD ACCUSATIONS\n\nJames began investigating the Trump Organization soon after she took office, eventually securing a $454 million judgment against the then-former president and some of Trump's company's executives, including two of his sons.\n\nA New York judge found Trump and his business partners grossly overstated Trump's wealth to obtain favorable loans and other financial benefits. James said at the time that financial fraud was not a \"victimless crime.\"\n\n\"If average New Yorkers went into a bank and submitted false documents, the government would throw the book at them, and the same should be true for former presidents,\" James said.\n\n\u2018DANGEROUS AND ILLEGAL\u2019: DEMOCRAT AGS SUE TRUMP OVER EFFORT TO USE SNAP TO LOCATE MIGRANTS\n\nJames also has been a leading figure in bringing litigation challenging the second Trump administration's executive actions. James and other Democratic attorneys general have sued to fight spending freezes on federally funded social programs, mass firings of federal employees and restrictions on transgender care for minors, among other matters.\n\nNews of a grand jury investigation comes as tensions have continued to build between Trump and James.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn April, the Trump Federal Housing Finance Agency asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate James over mortgage fraud, and the DOJ opened a separate investigation into that matter. James received grand jury subpoenas in the inquiry, the Washington Post reported.\n\nAt the same time, Trump called her a \"wacky crook\" on Truth Social.\n\n\"Letitia James, a totally corrupt politician, should resign from her position as New York State Attorney General, IMMEDIATELY,\" Trump wrote.",

      "text": "The New York Attorney General's Office has hired high-powered attorney Abbe Lowell to defend Attorney General Letitia James against fraud accusations being levied against her.\nThe office confirmed it hired Lowell, who has represented high-profile political figures on both sides of the aisle, including Hunter Biden, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, former Sen. Bob Mendez and Bill Clinton.\nIt is unclear whether taxpayer dollars are going towards James' defense, as the attorney general's office stopped answering questions once Fox News Digital began asking about how Lowell would be compensated.\nLowell will represent James as a private citizen, not as part of Winston & Strawn LLP, where he had been a partner. A spokesperson for Winston & Strawn said Lowell \"left to form his own firm, allowing him to better balance his legal work, teaching, writing and charitable work\" but would not say when Lowell and the firm parted ways.\nHUNTER BIDEN HIRES ALEX MURDAUGH'S LAWYER IN LATEST COURT CASE; ABBE LOWELL OUT\nU.S. Federal Housing Director William Pulte is requesting the Department of Justice investigate James and consider prosecuting her for allegedly falsifying bank documents and records in order to garner more favorable loans. Lowell, who hung up on Fox News Digital when reached by phone, sent a letter to the DOJ Thursday urging them to reject Pulte's request for prosecution.\nLocal reporting from the Times Union said the attorney general's office indicated the decision to hire Lowell to defend James was, in part, based on their allegation that the Trump administration is pushing a politically motivated criminal referral in response to James bringing a civil case against Donald Trump last year for allegedly inflating asset values to obtain favorable loans.\nLowell, in his letter to the DOJ that was directed to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, referred to Pulte's criminal referral as \"the latest act of improper political retribution\" from Trump.\nNEW YORK ATTORNEY GENERAL CLAIMS DOJ'S MORTGAGE FRAUD ACCUSATIONS ARE \u2018BASELESS\u2019\n\"The stunning hypocrisy of President Trump\u2019s complaint that the Justice Department had been \u2018politicized\u2019 and \u2018weaponized\u2019 against him is laid bare as he and others in his administration are now asking you to undertake the very same practice,\" Mr. Lowell wrote.\nIn his letter, Lowell points to instances where Trump has called for revenge, and instances where the president has personally attacked James.\nLowell also went after the allegations, including that James listed a home in Virginia as her primary residence while serving as a state official in New York. According to Lowell, James had no intention of using the property as a primary residence and her indication of this in a power-of-attorney letter was a mistake. Lowell pointed out there were other documents where James indicated to her lender that the Virginia home would not be her primary residence.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nA second accusation of fraud against James accuses her of inflating the number of livable units in a multifamily Brooklyn residence to receive better interest rates. Lowell accuses Pulte of disregarding updated documentation listing the residence as a four-unit multifamily residence, and instead pointing to a certificate of occupancy from 2001."

      "text": "New York Attorney General Letitia James on Monday said she is helping lead a group of 20 Democratic attorneys general in suing the Trump administration over its demands that they turn over information about food stamp recipients and applicants in their state\u2014an effort she excoriated as a \"dangerous and illegal overreach\" by the administration to unlawfully locate and track down illegal immigrants.\nThe lawsuit, led by James, California Attorney General Rob Bonta, and Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, comes after the Trump administration demanded states turn over detailed personal information related to recipients and applicants of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, before July 30.\nThe Trump administration has threatened to withhold SNAP funding from states who fail to comply with the July 30 deadline\u2014teeing up a high-stakes, eleventh-hour court clash between Trump officials and leaders from 20 Democratic-led states.\nSpeaking to reporters on a press call Monday, James and other attorneys general took umbrage with the new SNAP data-sharing requirement, describing it as an \"illegal data grab\" designed to intimidate vulnerable communities and help track down migrants who might be subject to deportation.\n\"This administration is attempting to use this program as a tool in their cruel and chaotic targeting of immigrants,\" James said.\nTRUMP FOE LETITIA JAMES LEADING CHARGE ON NEW MULTISTATE LAWSUIT OVER HHS CUTS\nThe lawsuit is not the first time James, a longtime Trump foe, has sparred with Trump in court since the start of his second presidential term.\nTo date, she's joined Democratic attorneys general in more than a dozen other lawsuits challenging his early actions.\nBonta, for his part, described the USDA's new demands as a cruel bait-and-switch from the Trump administration.\nHe noted that the data the administration is allegedly attempting to mine comes from a decades-old aid program designed to help ensure that low-income families have access to food.\n\"SNAP recipients provided this information to get help to feed their families\u2014not to be entered into a government surveillance database, or be used as targets for the president's inhumane immigration agenda,\" Bonta said on Tuesday.\n\"This kind of targeting doesn't make America safer. It threatens kids' access to school meals, it jeopardizes wildfire survivors' access to relief,\" he added.\n\"And it sends a chilling message: if you reach out for help, you may be punished for it.\"\n100 DAYS OF INJUNCTIONS, TRIALS AND 'TEFLON DON': TRUMP SECOND TERM MEETS ITS BIGGEST TESTS IN COURT\nThe trio also rejected the assertion that USDA's request for the additional SNAP data, first announced in March, was made under the guise of helping eliminate \"waste and fraud\" within the federal government\u2014noting that the SNAP program historically has \"very low rates of fraud.\"\nRather, the Democratic attorneys general described the demand for information as a \"flat-out illegal\" attempt by the Trump administration to unlawfully obtain personal information about immigrants living in their states.\nThey noted that, in addition to threatening to withhold SNAP funds, Trump officials have expanded the amount of data that states are required to submit about the individuals in the program.\nThe new USDA demands, released last week, require states to provide a list of individuals who have applied or are currently receiving SNAP benefits, in addition to other information such as a list of their immigration statuses in the U.S., and information including their marital statuses, their residential and mailing addresses, and education and employment history, among other things.\nEach of the attorneys general said Monday that the program would require them to share the personal information of millions of residents in their states, dating back to 2020, and bypassing federal laws that dictate how such information can be used.\n\"This is not for research,\" James said. \"They are basically trying to weaponize the SNAP program against immigrant communities, in violation of the law.\"\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta, for his part, described the push by the administration as an attempt to \"hunt down\" and obtain personal information for millions of residents in their states.\n\"They're bypassing legal procedures, ignoring privacy protections, and demanding data that federal law explicitly says can only be used for administering the SNAP program,\" Bonta said, noting that they \"ignored hundreds of public comments pointing out major flaws in the government's plans.\"\nFEDERAL JUDGES IN NEW YORK AND TEXAS BLOCK TRUMP DEPORTATIONS AFTER SCOTUS RULING\nThe lawsuit comes as James and other Democratic-led states have taken aim at Trump's sweeping policy goals and executive orders in court, which they describe as excessive and unconstitutional.\nSince his inauguration in January, Bonta noted, Democrat-led states have filed 35 lawsuits against the Trump administration.\nBonta said Monday that the USDA requirement is a \"clear violation\" of the \"Spending Clause, federal privacy statutes, and the USDA's own authority,\" prompting them to file suit.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"President Trump made promises to the American people and now he's breaking them,\" the group said Monday.\n\"He's rewriting the rules, targeting the most vulnerable and expecting states to fall in line.\""
