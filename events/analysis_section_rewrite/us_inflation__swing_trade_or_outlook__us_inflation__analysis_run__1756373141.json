      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid start but falls short of the “world‑class” standard in several key areas. First, the “Movers & Scenarios” block must contain **exactly four lines** (two Up, two Down) and each line must follow the strict syntax: *Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %*. Your current list mixes a 1‑3 month and 4‑6 month view in a single line and includes a “Bullish” line that violates the format. Replace it with two clear Up lines: (1) Fed‑rate cut in 1‑3 months narrowing Δr and lifting risk appetite; (2) RNC big‑beautiful bill enacted in 4‑6 months boosting disposable income. Likewise, craft two Down lines: (1) Moratorium repeal in 1‑3 months expanding soy supply; (2) Trump troop deployment >5,000 in 4‑6 months triggering risk‑off. Assign probabilities that reflect the evidence: e.g., 65 % for Fed cut (Fed minutes, Powell remarks OGK8WLL69), 60 % for bill passage (EPJYXB7DX), 40 % for moratorium repeal (J54PXL0NV), 35 % for troop deployment (PHWYW5YLQ). Second, the **Swing Trade** line must be a single line (or two if you need a second entry) and must include *Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100*. Your current “Bullish” line is malformed and lacks a stop/target. Draft, for example: *Long | 3‑4 mo | 4,500 | 4,350 | 4,650 | 1:1.5 | Fed minutes no cut | Fed minutes rate cut | 60% | 70*. Third, embed **quantitative anchors**: use the Δr formula to compute the expected widening if Fed cuts stall (e.g., Δr rises from 0.75 % to 1.25 %); state the implied risk‑premia shift (e.g., 0.5 % lift to crypto). Fourth, tighten citations: every factual claim (e.g., “Fed policy signals a potential cut”) must reference an ID; avoid generic statements like “Fed policy remains critical” without a source. Fifth, reconcile conflicting signals: if the RNC bill is passed, the tax‑cut lift may offset the Fed‑rate‑cut risk‑on; explicitly note this interaction. Finally, ensure the **confidence** figure is justified by the number of independent, high‑confidence signals (e.g., 3/4 signals >60 % each → 75 % confidence). Implement these edits, and your analysis will meet the required depth, clarity, and format.",
