  "title": "3 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks to Buy Right Now",

  "content": "Which income investors want to buy stocks with dividends likely to decline and iffy businesses? None. Instead, income investors want practically unstoppable dividend stocks.\n\nThree Motley Fool contributors think they've identified healthcare stocks that fit the bill. Here's why they picked Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT), Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN), and AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV).\n\nA Dividend King with a diverse business to buy and hold for years\n\nDavid Jagielski (Abbott Laboratories): Want a top dividend stock that you can safely buy and hold for years? Check out Abbott Laboratories. The company not only has a solid track record for paying and increasing dividends, but its broad and diverse business makes it highly probable that the hikes to its payout will continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nYou might dismiss Abbott as a mediocre income stock due to its modest dividend yield of 2%. There are many other high-yielding stocks out there. But the real payoff from owning the stock is over the long haul. The stock is a Dividend King that has increased its dividends for 52 consecutive years. It has also been paying dividends for a century.\n\nThe company doesn't just have a solid track record, either. Its future remains promising as Abbott has a lot of different ways it can grow its business. It has pharmaceutical, nutritional, medical device, and diagnostics business units that provide it with varying growth opportunities. In its most recent quarter (which ended in June), the company reported positive organic growth, excluding the impact of COVID-19 tests, of more than 9% across its entire operations. Each one of its segments generated positive organic growth compared to the previous year.\n\nThe stock's modest payout ratio of 67% suggests there's still plenty of room ahead for the business to raise its dividend, especially when you consider the strength and diversity which comes with Abbott Laboratories' operations. This is one of the better dividend stocks that buy-and-hold investors can own today.\n\nProsper Junior Bakiny (Amgen): What is the most crucial thing for dividend investors to consider? A high yield is attractive, as is a competitive dividend per share. One might mention several other dividend-centered metrics, but a company's underlying business remains the most crucial factor to consider. A corporation's dividend is only as good as the business backing it.\n\nThat's what makes Amgen such an attractive option. Amgen is a leading biotech company with a solid track record of innovation and a long list of approved products, many of which generate over $1 billion in sales every year.\n\nIts pipeline looks equally exciting, especially as it might have one of the most promising candidates in the exciting weight loss market; Amgen's MariTide produced strong results in phase 2 studies. There's still a long way before it earns approval, if it goes that far. But it already has some analysts excited. According to market researcher Evaluate Pharma, MariTide could generate as much as $2.1 billion in sales by 2030.\n\nThough Amgen's organic revenue growth hasn't been that impressive in the past three years, candidates like MariTide and others will help move things in the right direction. Amgen's dividend program has remained strong throughout. The company's payouts have increased by 55% in the past five years. Its forward yield stands at 2.74%, higher than the S&P 500's average of 1.32%. Thanks to the company's strong fundamentals, investors can trust Amgen to continue raising its dividends.\n\nAnother great member of the dividend A-team\n\nKeith Speights (AbbVie): I didn't know that all three of our picks would begin with the letter \"A.\" However, I think it's appropriate because AbbVie truly deserves to be on the dividend A-team.\n\nThe big drugmaker spun off from Abbott in 2013. AbbVie therefore inherited Abbott's fantastic track record of dividend increases and is counted as a Dividend King like its parent company. However, income investors should like AbbVie's forward dividend yield of nearly 3.2% even more than they like Abbott's yield.\n\nAbbVie is reasonably valued with its forward earnings multiple of 18.2. The stock's valuation looks even more attractive with the company's growth prospects factored in.\n\nTo be sure, AbbVie's revenue and earnings have fallen since its top-selling drug, Humira, lost U.S. patent exclusivity in early 2023. However, a strong rebound should be on the way. Sales are skyrocketing for AbbVie's newer autoimmune disease blockbuster drugs, Rinvoq and Skyrizi. The drugmaker also has great growth drivers in antipsychotic medication Vraylar and its migraine therapies Qulipta and Ubrelvy.\n\nAbbVie's pipeline provides more reason for optimism. The company has over 90 programs in development. These include promising cancer, immunology, and neurological drugs, several of which are in late-stage testing.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in AbbVie right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in AbbVie, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and AbbVie wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $792,725!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than quadrupled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nDavid Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Keith Speights has positions in AbbVie. Prosper Junior Bakiny has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Abbott Laboratories. The Motley Fool recommends Amgen.

      "text": "Everybody needs healthcare -- or will, at some point. And, when there\u2019s something everyone needs, there\u2019s a huge opportunity for investors.\nAbout $9.8 trillion is spent on healthcare globally. Half of that amount -- around $4.9 trillion -- is spent in the U.S. With the healthcare sector growing significantly faster than the overall economy, the numbers will almost certainly be much larger by the end of the decade.\nHow can investors profit from this growth? Here\u2019s what you need to know about investing in healthcare stocks.\nTypes of healthcare stocks\nDifferent types of healthcare stocks\nThe healthcare sector is so broad that there are several different kinds of healthcare stocks. Four of the most important types are:\n- Drug stocks: Drugmakers focus on developing drugs that treat or prevent diseases. Biotech companies use live organisms such as bacteria or enzymes to develop drugs, while pharmaceutical companies use chemicals. Drug stocks range from huge companies with billions of dollars in sales each year to small biotech firms with no products on the market yet.\n- Medical device stocks: Medical device companies make devices used to care for patients. The devices range from disposable gloves and thermometers to artificial heart valves and robotic surgical systems. Medical device stocks include many health tech stocks, as well as medical equipment stocks.\n- Payer stocks: Payers, including health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), play an especially important role in the U.S. healthcare system. Insurers charge premiums to individuals and employers to pay for healthcare costs, while PBMs administer prescription drug benefits for employers and health plans.\n- Healthcare provider stocks: Healthcare providers stand at the front lines, delivering healthcare services to patients. They include hospitals, physician practices, home health companies, and long-term care facilities.\nTop healthcare stocks\nTop healthcare stocks to buy in 2025\nStrong companies can be found within each type of healthcare stock. We\u2019ll break down at least one example of each with a look at Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX -0.45%), Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 1.22%), TransMedics Group (TMDX 0.67%), UnitedHealth Group (UNH 1.34%), and HCA Healthcare (HCA 0.15%).\n- Vertex Pharmaceuticals stands out as one of the top biotech stocks on the market. The company primarily focuses on developing drugs that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF), a rare genetic disease that damages the lungs and other organs. Vertex has also expanded beyond CF with gene-editing therapy Casgevy (a one-time treatment for the rare blood disorders sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia) and acute pain therapy suzetregine.\n- Intuitive Surgical is a great example of a medical device stock that also falls into the category of surgical stocks. The company\u2019s Da Vinci robotic surgical system has been used in more than 16 million procedures since its 1999 introduction. Intuitive Surgical also markets Ion, a robotic system for minimally invasive peripheral lung biopsy. Over the long run, the company should have tremendous growth opportunities ahead with an aging population requiring the types of surgical procedures for which Da Vinci is frequently used.\n- TransMedics Group developed and sells the Organ Care System (OCS), a system for transporting lungs, hearts, and livers intended for transplantation. OCS replicates the human body in many ways, keeping donated organs alive until they can be transplanted. TransMedics also created a National OCS Program (NOP) that provides end-to-end services related to organ transplantation, including air transportation. The company has a major growth opportunity in disrupting the organ transplant market.\n- UnitedHealth Group ranks as the largest commercial health insurer in the U.S. It also operates one of the biggest PBMs and is a leader in healthcare delivery services. The company\u2019s size, stability, and dividend make UnitedHealth Group one of the most attractive payer stocks on the market. UnitedHealth Group has also expanded its presence in the healthcare provider market with its 2023 acquisition of home health services provider LHC Group.\n- HCA Healthcare owns and operates 187 hospitals and around 2,400 outpatient facilities including surgery centers, physician clinics, freestanding emergency rooms, and urgent care centers. It's the largest health system operator in the U.S. HCA also operates healthcare facilities in the United Kingdom. The company continues to grow, in large part, by making acquisitions.\nWhat to look for\nWhat to look for in healthcare stocks\nHow do you find the absolute best healthcare stocks to buy? There are four key things to look for:\n1. Growth prospects\nThe most important thing you\u2019ll want to check out with any healthcare stock is the company\u2019s growth prospects. Determine how quickly revenue has grown in recent years. The future doesn\u2019t always mirror the past. However, if a company hasn\u2019t been able to deliver strong revenue growth so far, it probably won\u2019t in the future.\nRead the investor presentations on companies\u2019 websites to learn their strategies for growth and the size of their potential markets. Check out the companies\u2019 rivals to see if their strategies seem to be as good or better. Note that companies will often mention specific competitors by name in their 10-K annual regulatory filings to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nDon\u2019t overlook the possibility that mergers and acquisitions (M&A) could boost a company\u2019s growth prospects. Companies that have grown through M&A in the past could be looking for new deals to make in the future.\nKeep in mind that deals don't necessarily include an outright purchase of another company. Larger companies sometimes collaborate with smaller players instead of buying them. For example, Vertex Pharmaceuticals teamed up with small biotech CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP 2.82%). The two companies won U.S. regulatory approvals for gene-editing therapy Casgevy in treating sickle cell disease in December 2023 and for treating transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia in January 2024. They're also working together to develop therapies targeting type 1 diabetes.\n2. Financial strength\nThe SEC filings also include statements that can help evaluate the financial strength of a company. Ideally, a company will already be profitable. If it isn\u2019t, make sure you learn how it plans to achieve profitability and how quickly it expects to do so.\nA company\u2019s cash position includes cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. It can be found on the balance sheet (a financial statement that lists all the company\u2019s assets, liabilities, and shareholder equity) in the company's annual and quarterly regulatory filings. Think about cash position the same way you\u2019d think about the amount of money in your checking, savings, and retirement accounts: The more, the better.\nAnother important gauge of financial strength is the free cash flow (FCF) generated by a company. FCF is the cash left over after operating expenses and capital expenditures (which includes money spent on buildings, equipment, and land). As with the cash position, the higher a company\u2019s FCF, the stronger its financial position.\nYour dollars and mine, our capital, is helping shape the world.David Gardner, co-founder, The Motley Fool\n3. Valuation\nYou\u2019d want to know how much a new car is worth before buying it. Determining the value of a healthcare stock before buying it is also important so you can make sure you\u2019re paying a fair price.\nThere are quite a few valuation metrics. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is the most popular and measures the price of a stock in relation to its earnings per share, or what you get in earnings for every dollar you invest.\nSome P/E ratios are backward-looking, or reflecting earnings from a previous period (typically the past 12 months). Forward P/E ratios, which use earnings estimates for one year into the future, can be more helpful in assessing the valuation of fast-growing healthcare stocks. Comparing P/E ratios with other stocks in the same industry will help you determine if the stock is relatively cheap or relatively expensive.\nJust because a stock\u2019s P/E ratio is higher than those of its peers doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a good or bad buy. It could indicate that the company\u2019s growth prospects are much better than those of its rivals. Be sure to also check out the stock\u2019s price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio, which incorporates projected earnings growth rates (typically over five years). Stocks with lower PEG ratios (especially when the ratios are less than 1) are more attractively valued than those with higher PEG ratios.\n4. Dividends\nSome of the best healthcare stocks pay dividends -- a portion of earnings that the company returns to shareholders. Dividends can boost the overall return you receive from owning a stock.\nThe dividend yield tells you how large a stock\u2019s annual dividend payments are as a percentage of the current share price. Consider the stock\u2019s payout ratio, which measures dividends as a percentage of earnings and indicates how much of the company\u2019s cash is being used to cover the dividend. The lower the payout ratio, the greater the likelihood that the company will be able to keep paying dividends in the future.\nRisks\nWhat are the risks of investing in healthcare stocks?\nInvesting in any kind of stock comes with risks, including the possibility that competitors will develop more successful products and services. Healthcare stocks face these risks, as well as others that are more unique to the sector.\nHealthcare is highly regulated. Drugmakers and medical device makers can fail to secure the necessary regulatory approvals to market new products. Regulatory changes can drastically alter a healthcare stock\u2019s growth prospects. In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) oversees the regulation of drugs and medical devices. It\u2019s smart to pay attention to any FDA action related to medical stocks you\u2019re watching.\nMany healthcare stocks also face significant litigation risk. For example, biopharmaceutical companies, medical device makers, and healthcare providers can be sued if patients think the companies\u2019 products and services have caused them harm.\nIn addition, drugmakers and medical device makers must convince payers, including health insurers, PBMs, and government agencies, to buy their products. If companies aren\u2019t successful in obtaining reimbursement approvals, their growth prospects can be reduced.\nMany healthcare companies are also highly dependent on Medicare reimbursement levels. Recent changes to Medicare allow the program to negotiate prices for some high-cost drugs with pharmaceutical companies. Some drugmakers' revenues and profits could be negatively affected as Medicare pays less for certain drugs.\nRelated investing topics\nBottom line\nHealthcare stocks should have healthy returns\nDespite these risks, the overall outlook for healthcare stocks appears very good over the long term. Aging demographic trends around the world, combined with advances in technology, should open up tremendous opportunities for healthcare stocks -- and provide healthy returns for patient investors.\nFAQs\nFAQs\nWhat are the best healthcare stocks to buy now?\nMany healthcare stocks are good alternatives for investors to buy now. Some top candidates representing various areas of the healthcare sector include Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Intuitive Surgical, TransMedics Group, UnitedHealth Group, and HCA Healthcare.\nIs it smart to invest in healthcare?\nWhile investors must decide for themselves whether any sector is a good fit for them, healthcare could be a smart area in which to invest for many. Healthcare spending is growing faster than the U.S. GDP as the population ages. This should create significant opportunities for innovative healthcare companies.\nDo healthcare stocks do well in a recession?\nMany healthcare stocks perform relatively well during a recession. Healthcare products and services are usually needed regardless of economic conditions. However, some healthcare stocks might be more affected by recessions than others."

      "text": "Identifying a company with a blockbuster drug in the pipeline can seem like the holy grail if you're a healthcare investor. A blockbuster drug is one that generates at least $1 billion in annual revenue. While blockbuster drugs often fuel profits for pharmaceutical companies, the big bucks usually fade once the drug's patent expires.\nBlockbuster drug defined\nWhat is a blockbuster drug?\nA blockbuster drug is a medication that generates annual sales of $1 billion or more. These drugs usually treat conditions that affect many people -- like hypertension, high cholesterol, cancer, arthritis, and diabetes -- and require chronic care over the long term.\nExamples of blockbuster drugs include AbbVie's (ABBV 0.38%) Humira -- an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat a host of conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease -- and Pfizer's (PFE 0.33%) cholesterol drug Lipitor.\nAlthough a drug that produces $1 billion in annual revenue may seem like a boon to pharmaceutical companies and their shareholders, it's important to consider how much companies spend on drug development. Bringing a new drug to market can cost more than $2 billion.\nOnly about 12% of drugs that make it to clinical trials ultimately get FDA approval. As a result, drug companies often lean heavily on the sale of blockbuster drugs to offset the costs of research and development for drugs that never make it to market.\nWhat happens when patents expire?\nWhat happens to a blockbuster drug when its patent expires?\nDrug patents typically last for 20 years, but that doesn't necessarily mean a company that develops a drug gets to sell that drug exclusively for 20 years. Most patents are filed long before a company actually wins approval for a drug.\nGiven the lengthy timeline for bringing a new drug to market, a company that develops a blockbuster drug often has a window substantially shorter than 20 years within which to sell the drug before competitors can sell generic versions.\nThe expiration of a patent is often referred to as a patent cliff. The inventing company can no longer charge a premium for the drug as generic competitors flood the market. By some estimates, a company loses about 80% of its revenue from a blockbuster drug after its patent expires.\nIf you're interested in investing in a company that makes a blockbuster drug, it's essential to consider whether it has other promising drug candidates in its pipeline. An expiring patent can cause a major source of cash flow to dry up.\nExamples of blockbuster drugs\nOzempic and Wegovy: The blockbuster weight-loss drugs\nOzempic and Wegovy are two blockbuster drugs that have recently been in the spotlight. The injectable medications were both intended to treat diabetes, but their popularity skyrocketed as word spread that both are highly effective at helping people lose weight.\nRelated investing topics\nNovo Nordisk (NVO 2.62%), the Danish company that created the drugs, reported that Ozempic had sales of almost $9.4 billion during the first nine months of 2023, while Wegovy brought in about $3.1 billion in revenue for the same period.\nThe drugs' blockbuster sales have made Novo Nordisk the most valuable company in Europe -- a title previously held by French luxury conglomerate LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy (OTCMKTS:LVMUY) -- with a market capitalization of more than $430 billion in late 2023."

      "text": "The biotech Amgen (AMGN 0.06%) isn't exactly known as a growth stock. Over the past few years, the company's organic revenue hasn't been increasing at a particularly impressive rate. The drugmaker has tried to improve on that front through acquisitions and developing newer products.\nThough these initiatives have had a positive effect, there is still room for more progress. Here's the good news: Amgen is currently working on medicines in an exciting and fast-growing therapeutic area. If the biotech can be successful, it could be its next big growth opportunity. Let's find out more.\nAn increasingly crowded field\nBusiness success tends to attract competitors. Novo Nordisk (NVO 2.62%) and Eli Lilly (LLY 0.13%) are making small fortunes from their dominance in the weight loss market thanks to GLP-1 medicines such as Wegovy and Zepbound.\nMany drugmakers are looking to take a slice of this growing pie: According to some estimates, the weight loss market will be worth $44 billion by 2030 -- it was valued at just $2.5 billion in 2022.\nAmgen is one of those companies developing brand-new obesity therapies. Even though this space is getting crowded, it could carve out a niche.\nConsider the biotech's leading weight loss candidate, MariTide. This product is currently undergoing phase 2 studies. Amgen plans to release topline data from this trial later this year.\nMariTide produced highly promising results in a phase 1 study. In a paper published in Nature Metabolism, Amgen reported that patients treated with MariTide lost weight and kept it off for up to 150 days after the last dose.\nMany patients are worried that they will regain their weight once they stop taking GLP-1 medicines. Early data suggests that MariTide might be able to help with that, at least somewhat. Of course, there is still a long way to go before this product hits the market, but it looks highly promising.\nThe research company Evaluate Pharma recently ranked MariTide as one of the 10 most valuable research-and-development projects in the pharmaceutical industry, with projected 2030 sales of $2.1 billion and a net present value of $12.4 billion.\nConsidering MariTide wouldn't earn approval for at least a couple of years, if it can indeed generate that much by 2030, it would become an important growth driver for Amgen well into the next decade.\nIs Amgen stock a buy?\nWhat if MariTide fails in clinical trials? Even if it fails to make a name in the weight loss market, Amgen will earn approval for brand-new therapies in other areas. The company's pipeline features more than 50 ongoing programs. They won't all clear the clinical and regulatory obstacles needed to obtain approval, but even a modest 25% success rate will lead to many brand-new drugs and various label expansions.\nAmgen is still dealing with some of its older products that are losing steam. Medicines such as Enbrel, which treats rheumatoid arthritis; Neulasta, used to prevent infection in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, and immunosuppressant Otezla are practically ancient. Enbrel has been on the market for well over 20 years. But thanks to Amgen's pipeline, the company should eventually be able to move on from these products.\nAnd the biotech is an excellent dividend stock. In the past 10 years, the company has increased its payout by almost 269%. Its forward yield tops 2.7%, and its cash payout ratio, at about 65%, is still manageable.\nThis might not be a top growth stock, but it has other qualities. It is a steady and reliable business that should perform well in the long run since the need for innovative medicines won't disappear anytime soon. And, of course, Amgen is also an excellent pick for income seekers."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "Dividend stocks are shares of companies that make regular distributions to their shareholders, usually in the form of cash payments. Dividend stocks can be a useful source of income, but the best dividend stocks can also be an excellent way to build wealth over the long term.\nHowever, not all dividend stocks are great investments, and many investors are unsure how to start their search. With that in mind, here's a list of dividend-paying stocks you might want to consider and some of the most important things to look for in top dividend stocks.\nNine best stocks\nNine best dividend stocks\nThe Dividend Kings list is a great place to find top dividend stocks. Dividend Kings are companies that have paid and raised their base dividends for at least 50 consecutive years.\nThe Dividend Achievers\u2122 list, whose companies boast 10-plus straight years of dividend increases, is a trademarked property owned by the Nasdaq and another great list to research. Both lists include some great stocks to buy, and we have included a few from each in our list below. Here are nine top dividend stocks to consider buying now.\nCompanies 1 - 3\n1. Lowe's\nHome improvement giant Lowe's (LOW 3.1%) may not seem like a very exciting stock. And that's true -- unless you like dividend growth. The company has raised its dividend almost every year since going public in 1961 and has raised the payout by more than 300% over the trailing decade alone.\nInvestors worried about the housing downturn shouldn't fret. When the housing supply is tight, homes are harder to buy, and people tend to spend more to upgrade their existing homes. So, any cyclical weakness in its results will likely return to growth over the long term, even if short-term shifts in consumer spending cause an overall slowdown in renovations.\nWhile consumer expenditures on home improvement projects remain in flux, particularly as concerns about the economy persist, these are durable spending trends over the long run. As consumer spending appetite improves, home upgrades and other projects, from which Lowe's has historically experienced considerable growth, should see an uptick.\nAnother important factor that's good for Lowe's is that the typical U.S. home is between 31 and 60 years old, depending on the state. The next generation of DIYers will spend a lot of money at Lowe's, as will home improvement contractors. It's made professionals a priority, and sales to contractors are growing.\n2. Realty Income\nIf you're looking for a simple way to invest in high-quality real estate for income and growth, Realty Income (O -1.11%) might be the perfect stock. The company owns an array of largely e-commerce-resistant properties, earning strong cash flow from tenants on long-term leases.\nRealty Income is also a Dividend Achiever, with more than three decades of consecutive annual dividend increases every year since going public in 1994 -- and over 55 straight years of paying a dividend every month. Since its founding, Realty has declared 661 consecutive monthly dividends and has habitually increased its dividend for the last 30 consecutive years.\nThis best-of-breed real estate investment trust (REIT) has also taken steps to continue delivering on its dividend-growing ways. In early 2024, it closed the $9.3 billion acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital, which it said would immediately add 2.5% to its adjusted funds from operations (FFO).\n3. Chevron\nFor years, Chevron (CVX 1.5%) has been a big winner for investors and a solid stock to own, especially for dividend investors. It has maintained a steady track record of generating strong cash flows and growing payouts modestly every year for 38 years and counting.\nThe stock price can fluctuate with oil prices, and Chevron has been part of the volatility trend afflicting many oil stocks recently. Still, Chevron has proven a profitable investment for dividend-seekers over the long term.\nIts $53 billion deal to acquire Hess (NYSE:HES) means significantly more low-cost onshore oil in the Permian Basin and some of the cheapest offshore oil currently being produced. However, a legal challenge by competitor ExxonMobil (XOM 1.72%) delayed the deal's closing until recently.\nIn January 2025, the Federal Trade Commission approved a consent order to resolve antitrust issues concerning the deal, satisfying a key closing condition. Arbitration proceedings over the remaining interests off the coast of Guyana then concluded in May 2025. Chevron ultimately prevailed in the arbitration case and announced the completion of its acquisition of Hess in July 2025.\nThe Hess acquisition significantly strengthens Chevron's portfolio, including adding a 30% interest in the highly valuable Stabroek Block in Guyana. Chevron is now focused on integrating Hess's operations, and is aiming to achieve $1 billion in annual run-rate cost synergies by the end of 2025.\nCompanies 4 - 6\n4. Target\nFor years, Target (TGT 1.98%) was more profitable than its peers, posting some of the highest gross margins and operating margins in retail. At the same time, its focus on increasing its e-commerce business and expanding in-store offerings helped stabilize its top line while improving profitability.\nRecent years have been quite tumultuous as Target has worked through some growing pains, dealing with lower-than-expected growth compared to industry peers, slowdowns in consumer spending, and other notable headwinds. However, Target remains profitable with a robust balance of cash on hand.\nIn fiscal 2024, the company reported net earnings of $4.1 billion on net sales of $106.6 billion. At the end of the fiscal year, the company had about $4.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.\nThat's great news for dividend investors. With dividend growth at 55 years and counting and shares trading for attractive earnings and cash-flow multiples, dividend investors should put Target on their shopping list.\n5. Starbucks\nOver the past four decades, Starbucks (SBUX -0.27%) has established itself as the dominant global brand in coffee beverages. With more than 40,000 global stores and Starbucks-branded ready-to-drink beverages and packaged coffee in hundreds of thousands more locations, nobody sells -- or buys -- more coffee than this company.\nIn 2023, China returned to more normal public commerce, which has been a big boost for the company. China is Starbucks' second-largest market outside the U.S. and its largest international market. Starbucks has counted on that country to become its biggest and most profitable market over the next decade.\nThe company has also cemented partnerships across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East (both through franchise and licensing agreements) as it seeks to open new profitable stores and expand its international segment. However, the company has some challenges to deal with.\nCritics say Starbucks hasn't introduced many exciting new drinks recently, making the menu feel stale and unappealing to customers. Newer coffee chains are gaining popularity, and despite significant expansion in China, Starbucks faces increased competition from local coffee brands, affecting sales in that key market.\nOver the long run, though, its strong brand and power as a buyer have resulted in robust competitive advantages, including cost benefits throughout its operations and pricing power with consumers. Those economic moats and the company's strong digital presence have resulted in a cash cow business.\nWhile business results have softened more recently, this isn't the first challenge the company has faced. It could be an enticing opportunity to invest. Starbucks has increased its dividend yearly for 14 consecutive years.\nIt has also increased annual earnings per share by more than 300% over the last five years alone. Its yield of about 3% at recent prices is on the higher end of its historical range, representing an attractive price to buy company shares.\n6. Brookfield Infrastructure\nSometimes, the best stocks are the ones hidden in plain sight. That's the case with Brookfield Infrastructure (BIPC 3.83%) (BIP 2.13%), which owns water, energy, utility, transportation, and communications infrastructure projects worldwide.\nIts assets generate steady recession- and inflation-resistant cash flow, and Brookfield returns a sizable portion to shareholders. At recent Class C share prices, it claimed a dividend yield of about 4.1%, more than 5% for the limited partner units, and aims to raise the payout by 5% to 9% every year.\nCompanies 7 - 9\n7. Microsoft\nMicrosoft (MSFT 0.56%) is one of the most important software companies on the planet. Over the past decade, it has rebuilt its business to focus on recurring subscription-based revenue that keeps its customers connected and the cash flowing. The company has a solid balance sheet with more cash than debt and a very low payout ratio that leaves tons of room to increase the dividend.\nIts 20-year streak of dividend increases is easy to miss. Its yield of less than 1% at recent prices hasn't put it on many dividend investors' radars. But what it hasn't paid in yield, Microsoft has absolutely delivered, with total returns of more than 3,000% since 2009 and dividends accounting for a sizable portion of those total returns.\nLooking forward, Microsoft wants to take a commanding lead in artificial intelligence (AI). With significant investments in and a partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, the company is integrating AI features across its suite of productivity and communications platforms and its Windows operating system.\n8. American Express\nFinancial services, such as consumer and business lending, are another place to find a handful of top dividend stocks, and American Express (AXP 3.47%) is one of the best. Although it's not on the list of companies that raise their dividends every year, Amex has a decades-long track record of either raising or maintaining its dividends through every economic environment.\nThe big lesson here: When other banks and lenders have cut or even eliminated their dividends, Amex has proven strong enough to keep the payouts coming for its shareholders. That's a credit to its high-quality lending standards and focus on higher-income credit customers who are less likely to default on their debts during weak economic periods.\nThe bottom line is that Amex appeals to investors who like owning a top financial services company but are also concerned about economic conditions. This is a great stock to buy during broad market downturns and a solid hold for a bull market recovery.\n9. Clearway Energy\nRenewable energy is mostly considered a place for growth investors, but it's also a wonderful opportunity for dividends. Clearway Energy (CWEN.A 1.0%)(CWEN 1.21%) is a perfect example. The company invests in, acquires, and operates renewable energy facilities, selling the power on long-term contracts -- think decades, not years -- to utility companies and large power consumers.\nThe stock witnessed extensive volatility over the last few years due to concerns that rising interest rates and perceived weakening in demand for renewables could affect its business. The market could be pricing in those concerns now, but the flip side is that its dividend yield was around 5.7% as of August 2025.\nWorries about the business are probably significantly overstated. Yes, rising rates and inflation have sent wind and solar into a downturn. These are cyclical industries that ebb and flow. Plus, Clearway's earnings come from long-term power production, and utilities continue to demand more and more clean power.\nManagement is moving forward, too, saying their long-term expectations remain unchanged. With ample opportunity ahead and plenty of access to funding, Clearway expects it can continue to grow profits and increase its payout.\nHighest dividends\nHighest dividend stocks\nWhether it's to generate the income you'll use today or the capital you can reinvest to increase your wealth, there's a good chance you're looking for a big dividend payout. If you're hoping to maximize the number of dividends you earn, here are some suggestions.\nFirst, consider dividend yield above dividend size. The dividend yield is a percentage of the share price you paid for the stock, paid in dividends annually. That's far more relevant than the dollar amount of dividends per share.\nNext, don't make owning high-dividend-yielding stocks your No. 1 priority. Focus first on business quality and a company's ability to maintain and increase the payout. Only then can you know whether a high dividend yield is sustainable.\nDividend investors should focus not on dividend size but on dividend yield.\nHow to invest\nHow to invest in dividend stocks\nThis article hits on a few things to avoid (e.g., focusing too much on a high yield that might be a trap) and the power of dividend growth stocks as some of the best winners. Here are some key things to look for when investing in dividend stocks.\n- Identify dividend stocks that meet your criteria. You may be looking for yield, a history of dividend growth, and so forth.\n- Research the history of earnings growth. Dividend growth is sustainable only if a company's earnings have also steadily grown at a similar or higher rate over time.\n- Consider valuation. While paying a modest premium for a high-quality business can sometimes be justified, overpaying can significantly weigh on long-term returns.\n- Determine position sizing. Consider how much exposure you want to a particular stock, how much income you expect it to generate, and other factors to ensure you buy an appropriate amount.\n- Focus on the long term. Dividend stocks deliver best when bought and held for many years. Having patience and letting exceptional managers run great companies while you just sit back and own them is how you get the best returns from dividend stocks.\nWhat to look for\nWhat to look for in dividend stocks\nIf you're new to dividend investing, it's smart to familiarize yourself with dividend stocks and why they can make excellent investments. Once you have a firm grasp of how dividends work, a few key concepts can help you find excellent dividend stocks for your portfolio.\n- Payout ratio: A stock's payout ratio is the amount of money the company pays per share in dividends divided by its earnings per share. In other words, this tells you the percentage of earnings a stock pays to shareholders. A reasonably low payout ratio (say, 70% or less) is a good sign that the dividend is sustainable.\n- History of increases: It's a very good sign when a company raises its dividend year after year, especially when it can continue to do so during recessions and other tough economic times.\n- Steady revenue and earnings growth: When looking for the best dividend stocks to own for the long term, prioritize stability. Erratic revenue (up one year, down the next) and fluctuating earnings can be signs of trouble.\n- Durable competitive advantages: This is perhaps the most important feature. A durable competitive advantage can take several forms, such as proprietary technology, high barriers to entry, high customer switching costs, or a powerful brand name.\n- Supportable yield: This is last on the list for a reason. A high yield is obviously preferable to a lower one, but only if the other criteria are met first. A high dividend is only as strong as the business that supports it. So, compare dividend yields after ensuring the business is healthy and the payout is stable.\nRelated investing topics\nDividend stocks are long-term investments\nEven the most rock-solid dividend stocks can experience significant volatility over short periods. There are simply too many market forces that can move them up or down over days or weeks, and many have nothing to do with the underlying business itself.\nSo, while the companies above should make great long-term dividend investments, don't worry too much about day-to-day price movements. Instead, focus on finding companies with excellent businesses, stable income streams, and (preferably) strong dividend track records. The long term will take care of itself.\nDividend stocks vs. dividend funds\nDividend stocks and dividend funds are both popular ways to generate income and potentially grow your investments. Dividend funds, such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs), invest in a portfolio of multiple dividend stocks. Dividend funds offer diversification and professional oversight by investment managers who carefully select the underlying stocks. With a dividend fund, it's important to pay attention to the expense ratio to determine how much of your investment may go towards fees.\nDividend stocks provide the potential for higher returns but also higher risk. It also takes time and effort to carefully research each business so you can understand whether it is a good fit for your portfolio. Depending on your investing style, you might prefer investing in dividend funds for the instant diversification and exposure they provide to a wide range of income stocks vs. putting cash to work in individual businesses. However, both types of investments can offer advantageous returns for a long-term investor with a well-diversified portfolio.\nFAQ\nBest dividend stocks: FAQ\nWhat stocks pay the highest dividend?\nWhile chasing yield can often lead to bad outcomes, some stocks are just built to be yield machines. Two categories known for paying above-average yields are utilities and REITs, or real estate investment trusts. But just as with any other dividend stock, don't assume that the highest-yielding ones are the best. Be sure to evaluate business quality and whether a company's cash flows support a dividend.\nWhat are dividends in stocks?\nDividends are payments made by a company to its shareholders. U.S. companies typically pay dividends quarterly, though some pay less often, and a few even pay monthly.\nDividends are generally paid in cash, but some companies pay in \"scrip,\" which is dividends paid in stock. Note that this is not the same as a dividend reinvestment plan, or DRIP, where a company (or your brokerage) automatically takes your cash dividend and purchases shares for you.\nWhat is considered a good stock dividend?\nIt can vary by sector and even particular industries within a sector, but the most important answer is \"one that can be sustained.\" This is why chasing yield is so dangerous, as a high yield that can't be maintained is no good at all.\nA useful metric for determining a dividend's safety is the dividend payout ratio, which is the percentage of a company's earnings that it pays out in dividends. The safest dividends generally have the lowest payout ratios.\nIs it a good idea to buy dividend stocks?\nWhether you're looking for income or just the best possible total returns, chances are good that many dividend stocks can be ideal ways to reach your financial goals. Just remember that yield is often less important than other factors, such as a company's ability to maintain and grow the payout for the long term.\nHow do dividends work?\nA dividend occurs when a company sends money (or stock, though very rarely) to its shareholders. When a company reaches the point that it consistently earns more than management can effectively reinvest, establishing a dividend policy and sending those excess profits back to investors is a smart move.\nDo ETFs pay dividends?\nYes, many ETFs pay dividends. Dividend ETFs hold stocks that pay dividends, and the ETF then distributes those dividends to its investors.\nDoes it matter when you buy a dividend stock?\nWhen you buy dividend stocks, it matters if you purchase them before the ex-dividend date. To receive the next dividend payment, you need to own the stock on or before the ex-dividend date."

A Dividend King is a company that's grown its dividend payment for at least 50 consecutive years.\nCompanies that pay -- and then grow -- their dividends every year generally have the sort of characteristics investors should look for:\n- Durable competitive moats that help them generate steady profits year after year.\n- Some ability to grow earnings per share over the long term.\n- Prudent board members and management who prioritize returning excess profits not needed for reinvestment back to shareholders.\nWhat is a Dividend King?\nWhat is a Dividend King?\nWhat's the most exclusive group of dividend stocks? It might not be what first comes to mind.\nMany investors are familiar with the Dividend Aristocrats\u00ae. (The term Dividend Aristocrats\u00ae is a registered trademark of Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC.) These stocks are members of the S&P 500 that have increased their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years.\nBut there's an even more elite group of dividend stocks that doesn't receive as much attention. Dividend Kings don't have to be members of the S&P 500, but they must reach an ultramarathon-like dividend streak -- at least 50 consecutive years of payout growth.\nHere's what you need to know about the Dividend Kings and how they can fit into your investment portfolio.\n2025 Dividend Kings\n2025 Dividend Kings list\nThese 55 stocks qualified as Dividend Kings as of March 3, 2025, including two \"unofficial\" Dividend Kings that qualify depending on how you interpret dividend growth.\n| Dividend King | Sector | Dividend Increase Streak |\n|---|---|---|\n| American States Water (NYSE:AWR) | Utilities | 70 |\n| Dover Corporation (NYSE:DOV) | Industrials | 69 |\n| Northwest Natural Holding (NYSE:NWN) | Utilities | 69 |\n| Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) | Consumer Goods | 69 |\n| Parker Hannifin (NYSE:PH) | Industrials | 68 |\n| Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) | Consumer Goods | 68 |\n| Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) | Industrials | 68 |\n| Cincinnati Financial (NASDAQ:CINF) | Financials | 65 |\n| Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) | Consumer Goods | 63 |\n| Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) | Healthcare | 62 |\n| Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) | Consumer Goods | 62**** |\n| Lancaster Colony (NASDAQ:LANC) | Consumer Goods | 62 |\n| Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) | Consumer Goods | 61 |\n| Illinois Tool Works (NYSE:ITW) | Industrials | 53 |\n| Nordson (NASDAQ:NDSN) | Industrials | 61 |\n| Farmers & Merchants Bancorp (OTC:FMCB) | Financials | 59 |\n| Hormel Foods (NYSE:HRL) | Consumer Goods | 59 |\n| California Water Service Group (NYSE:CWT) | Utilities | 58 |\n| Tootsie Roll Industries (NYSE:TR) | Consumer Goods | 58** |\n| ABM Industries (NYSE:ABM) | INdustrials | 57 |\n| Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) | Real Estate | 57 |\n| Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE:SWK) | Industrials | 57 |\n| Commerce Bancshares (NASDAQ:CBSH) | Financials | 57 |\n| SJW Group (NYSE:SJW) | Utilities | 57 |\n| Stepan (NYSE:SCL) | Industrials | 57 |\n| H.B.

This shouldn't be a surprise. Companies in these sectors tend to pay dividends and raise their prices with inflation, and many have also been in operation for a long time. The list breaks down as follows:\n- 16 industrial companies\n- 16 consumer goods\n- 9 utility stocks\n- 4 healthcare stocks\n- 6 financial stocks\n- 1 energy stock\n- 1 materials stock\n- 1 real estate stock\n- 1 tech stock\nThere aren't any exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus exclusively on Dividend Kings. However, the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF (NOBL 1.42%) owns shares of all Dividend Aristocrats\u00ae.\nChanges in 2025\nDividend King changes in 2025\nAlthough there's some risk that a potential recession could upend one or more of these dividend streaks, companies that make this list rarely lose their status. There's tremendous pressure on companies that have increased their dividends for 50-plus years to keep their streak going. No CEO wants to be known as the leader who messed up an impressive dividend track record.\nChief Executive Officer (CEO)\nConversely, it takes a half-century to make this list, a rare feat indeed. Yet we have recently seen several companies achieve Dividend King status. Automatic Data Processing joined the exclusive club in 2024. So far in 2025, we have added one new Dividend King, RLI Corp, with its dividend increase in February adding it to the royal list.\nThese stocks are now former Dividend Kings\nDespite management's efforts (or often because of them), not all companies stay on the list. In 2024, two former Dividend Kings cut their payouts, losing status.\nLeggett & Platt (LEG 5.92%) was the first, slashing its dividend in April, ending a 52-year run of dividend growth. 3M (MMM 2.73%) cut its payout more recently, lowering the dividend in May and bringing its six-decade growth streak to an end. In the case of both companies, bloated expenses, weak growth, and a number of acquisitions that haven't gone well played a role in the financial results weakening and eventually leading to a need to cut the payout.\nTwo \"unofficial\" Dividend Kings\nA note on two \"unofficial\" Dividend Kings\nWe have added Canadian Utilities and Tootsie Roll Industries to this list. Both have characteristics that make them Dividend Kings, though some investors may argue they make the cut on a technicality or two.\nCanadian Utilities is certainly a king if you're a Canadian investor; however, the changes in foreign exchange rates have recently made the effective dividend paid to U.S. investors fall. We don't want to shortchange the company or our Canadian investors because of this. The money the company has paid from its coffers every year has indeed increased for 53 years in a row.\nTootsie Roll is a little more complex. To start, the company has a long history of paying a dividend, but the $0.09 quarterly cash portion of the dividend has remained unchanged for years. Its payout has grown via the 3% stock dividend it also pays every year. So long as the stock price increases in value, the total dividends paid grows. We thought this quirk was worth explaining in detail.\nLikely Dividend King winners in 2025\nLikely Dividend King winners in 2025\nThree key factors could affect many stocks in 2025, including several of the Dividend Kings:\n- Inflation\n- Interest rates\n- A possible recession tied to the two factors above\nThese factors could benefit some stocks but hurt others. Here are three Dividend Kings that could be winners in 2025:\n1. Target\nTarget has been on a seriously rough ride in recent years. Like many other big-box retailers, the impact of inflation and supply chain challenges left the company with too many of the wrong goods and rising costs, pressuring its cash flow following the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe expectations of its e-commerce-driven business during the pandemic, along with some continued struggles with inventory and store-level execution, have weighed on its business in recent years, pulling shares to some of the lowest levels in the past five years. And while the business hasn't delivered the growth many expected, it's in far better shape than the stock would have many investors believe.\nIts e-commerce investments and large physical presence are a powerful combination that should serve Target well. Target is a major supplier of consumer staples, and even as consumers feel the pinch on their discretionary spending, Target is built to profit across economic environments.\nTrading for a cheap valuation and paying a safe dividend, Target looks like a great Dividend King to buy today and hold for the long term.\n2. Altria\nSome investors look at the tobacco giant with disdain; others simply won't buy a company whose products cause so much harm. But if that's not a concern for you, Altria should be on your list.\nThe company has had a number of missteps around vaping products in recent years, and its ability to crack the cannabis market isn't clear (nor is the future of cannabis's legality in many of Altria's markets).\nHowever, it continues to generate mountains of cash -- $8.6 billion in free cash flow over the past four quarters -- and returns much of that, $6.8 billion, to shareholders in dividend income. It also sells a product its customers buy across every economic condition, making its sizable dividend safe in every economic environment.\n3. Johnson & Johnson\nAnother Dividend King that's gone through a tumultuous past several years is Johnson & Johnson (J&J). However, the healthcare giant could emerge as a winning stock this year. To start, today's J&J is a more streamlined business, having divested Kenvue, its consumer products business, in 2023. Now, the company is focused on pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and technology exclusively.\nOver the past few years, J&J stock hasn't made for a great investment even with dividend growth, returning under 9% in total over the past three years. However, despite the paltry return in recent years, the five- and 10-year returns are better, at closer to 8% per year on average even with the recent weakness. With the company now lean and focused on its core pharma and medical devices businesses, 2025 could be a great year to add J&J to your long-term dividend growth portfolio.\nFuture Dividend Kings\nFuture Dividend Kings\nHere are some notable companies close to King status, and how long their current dividend growth streak is:\nThere are several large, well-known companies that are also primed to join the Dividend Kings list in the next half-decade. We will update the list as they move closer!\nRelated investing topics\nWhy invest in Dividend Kings?\nWhy invest in Dividend Kings?\nDividend Kings aren't necessarily a good fit for every investor. Many of these stocks frequently deliver relatively low growth and may or may not prove better investments than the stock market average. For example, of the 10 Dividend Kings with the longest records for dividend increases, only one has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 10 years, while six of the 10 have outperformed since 1990.\nIn other cases, their long records of growing payouts can make them reliable income generators, but being a Dividend King is no promise of market-beating returns.\nDividend Kings can be a great component of retirement portfolios or for investors looking for reliable income. Most of these stocks offer higher dividend yields than the average yield of S&P 500 members. Their consistency in paying and increasing dividend payouts can also provide a measure of confidence for anyone, depending on income generated by the dividend stocks they own.\nFAQ\nDividend Kings FAQ\nAre Dividend Kings a good investment?\nIn general, Dividend Kings as a group are solid investments. However, each company presents its own individual risks and opportunities and should not be bought just because it's a Dividend King. That said, as part of a broad, diversified portfolio, Dividend King stocks can be a great way to build and maintain wealth and generate income.\nWhat is considered a Dividend King?\nA Dividend King is a publicly traded company that has both paid and increased a regular dividend every year for at least 50 consecutive years.\nWhat is the highest-yielding Dividend King in 2025?\nAs of late 2024, Altria had the highest yield, about 9.56% at recent prices. The tobacco products giant often has a very high yield, with the stock typically trading for a below-average earnings multiple that keeps shares cheap and the yield high.\nWhat is the highest-paying Dividend King?\nThe Dividend King with the highest yield is Altria, with a 9.56% yield as of late 2024."

      "text": "Dividend stocks can be a great way to generate passive income. The best ones consistently increase their dividends per share each year.\nHowever, not all companies can routinely increase their dividends. One differentiating factor is the dividend payout ratio. Here's a closer look at this crucial metric for dividend investing.\nDividend payout ratio formula\nDividend payout ratio formula\nA company's dividend payout ratio is the percentage of that company's earnings that it pays out to its investors as dividend income. The dividend payout ratio formula is:\nTotal Annual Dividend Payments \u00f7 Annual Earnings = Dividend Payout Ratio\nSay a company earns $100 million this year and makes $50 million in dividend payments to its shareholders. In this case, its dividend payout ratio would be 50%. You can also use per-share amounts to get the same result. This can be simpler since companies report dividends and earnings in per-share amounts.\nHow to use the dividend payout ratio\nHow to use the dividend payout ratio\nLet's use Apple (AAPL 1.21%) to demonstrate how to calculate the dividend payout ratio using per-share information. As of October 14, 2025, Apple had earned $6.58 per share over the previous four quarters. Its most recent quarterly dividend was $0.25per share, which works out to $0.96 per share annually. Using the dividend payout ratio formula above, we have:\n$0.96 Annual Dividend Payments \u00f7 $6.58 Earnings Per Share = 15% Dividend Payout Ratio\nA good dividend payout ratio\nWhat is a good dividend payout ratio?\nDividend payout ratios tend to vary by industry. Companies that operate in mature, slower-growing sectors that generate lots of relatively steady cash flow may have higher dividend payout ratios. They don't need to retain as much money to fund their business for things like opening new stores, building another factory, or on research and development for new products. For financially strong companies in these industries, a good dividend payout ratio may approach 75% (or higher in some cases) of their earnings.\nHowever, companies in fast-growing sectors or those with more volatile cash flows and weaker balance sheets need to retain more of their earnings. Ideally, it should be less than 50%.\nA safe dividend payout ratio\nWhat is a safe dividend payout ratio?\nWhen you calculate dividends, you'll also want to calculate the dividend payout ratio. A safe dividend payout ratio varies by industry and a company's overall financial profile. For example, one company operating in a stable sector might safely maintain a high dividend payout ratio of 75% of its earnings because it has a strong balance sheet. On the other hand, a competitor in that same industry that has a weaker financial profile might not be able to sustain its dividend if it had a payout ratio that high.\nHistorically, the safest dividend payout ratio has been around 41%, according to research by Wellington Management and Hartford Funds. More dividend stocks with a payout ratio averaging around that level have outperformed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the S&P 500 than those with other payout levels. That's because they can pay an attractive dividend yield while also retaining a significant amount of cash to expand their business. They can also use it on other shareholder-friendly activities such as share repurchases and debt repayment.\nDividends Per Share\nIs a high payout ratio good?\nIs a high dividend payout ratio good?\nA mistake many beginning investors make is to buy stocks with the highest dividend yields they can find. They assume that the higher yield will enable them to earn greater returns.\nUnfortunately, that's not always the case. Many stocks with high yields also have a high dividend payout ratio. That potentially puts them at risk of cutting the dividend if business conditions deteriorate. They're also less likely to increase the amount of dividends paid since they have lower retained earnings. That gives them less wiggle room to increase their payout ratio.\nA better approach is to buy stocks with a lower payout ratio, even if it means sacrificing potential yield to ensure that you own companies that can continue to pay dividends. These companies have more financial flexibility to invest in expanding their earnings, which will enable them to increase their dividends.\nThis is evident in the historical performance of dividend stocks:\n| Grouping | Annual Average Returns (1973-2022) |\n|---|---|\n| Dividend growers and initiators | 10.24% |\n| Equal-weighed S&P 500 Index | 7.68% |\n| No change in dividend policy | 6.6% |\n| Dividend cutters and eliminators | 3.95% |\nAs the table shows, companies that made no change to their dividend policy (i.e., they maintained their payout level) and those that either cut or eliminated their dividends have underperformed the S&P 500 over the past several decades.\nOn the other hand, companies that recently initiated a dividend and those that have consistently increased their dividends -- such as Dividend Achievers and Dividend Kings -- have outperformed the S&P 500 over the long term. That's why investors should seek out companies with a lower dividend payout ratio instead of a higher yield since they're more likely to increase their payouts.\nRelated investing topics\nDon't overlook the dividend payout ratio\nThe dividend payout ratio is a vital metric for dividend investors. It shows how much of a company's income it pays out to investors. The higher that number, the less cash a company retains to expand its business and its dividend.\nGiven the significant outperformance of dividend growth stocks, investors can use the dividend payout ratio to find companies with the flexibility to routinely reward them with more dividend income in the future."
