      "feedback": "Your draft is a good start but still feels like a high‑level synopsis rather than a world‑class 3–6‑month thesis. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly linking each catalyst to a quantifiable outcome (e.g., “ad‑tier adoption projected to lift revenue by 5 % annually → 13 % CAGR through 2026” and cite the source that gives the 5 % figure—currently missing a citation). Replace vague “high current P/E of 51.7” with a concrete valuation narrative: show the current multiple (61SVFUKBY), the expected 30–35 multiple by 2030 (61SVFUKBY), and explain the mechanics of the compression (content spend ratio, ad‑revenue mix). Add a short‑term trigger window: “Q3 2025 earnings release” and an invalidation: “ad‑tier revenue < 3 % of total” with a source. Include macro data: Fed rate hikes (source YX2J8NHZ1) and their impact on discretionary spending, and quantify the sensitivity (e.g., a 25 bp hike → 0.5 % drop in subscriber growth). Structure the scenario map: base case, “strong ad‑tier” alt, “content cost blow‑out” alt, each with 3‑month timing. Add a watch‑list: quarterly churn, ad‑tier revenue, P/E trend. Cite all critical sources (61SVFUKBY, A88B7V8PY, YX2J8NHZ1) and reconcile any conflicting data (e.g., differing revenue CAGR estimates). Finally, end with a concise 3–6‑month price target range, confidence rating, and key risk/reward summary. This will elevate depth, clarity, and actionable insight.",
