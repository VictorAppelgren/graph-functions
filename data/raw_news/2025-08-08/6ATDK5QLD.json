  "title": "Apple iPad Mini A17 Pro plummets to its record-low price, saving you $120",
  "description": "Save $120 on the best small tablet around. The Apple iPad Mini A17 Pro is gorgeous, capable, and super portable.",
  "content": "I\u2019ve always been a huge fan of the iPad Mini series. These are much more portable, but usually more capable than the larger standard iPad. That said, they are also more expensive than an iPad, so it\u2019s always good to wait for the right deal. We have a good one for you, today. The Apple iPad Mini A17 Pro is at its record-low price of $379! Buy the Apple iPad Mini A17 Pro for just $379 ($120 off)\n\nIn the tablet market, smaller devices are usually associated with lower-end models. The Apple iPad Mini A17 Pro is the obvious exception, as it is not really the cheapest or least capable iPad model (the larger Apple iPad takes that spot). This is technically the tablet to get if you like smaller pads that can perform.\n\nThis is quite a powerful little machine. It comes with an Apple A17 Pro processor and 8GB of RAM. Performance will be great, and this is actually the cheapest iPad with Apple Intelligence support. This is definitely a nice addition if you know you\u2019ll be taking advantage of AI.\n\nThe main factor to keep in mind is that this is the smallest iPad available, so you must be willing to sacrifice screen real estate for more portability and easier handling. It comes with an 8.3-inch display. That said, it is a pretty nice one, with a 2,266 x 1,488 resolution. Even larger competitors usually stick to 1,080p or 1,440p on the higher-end. At a smaller size, the iPad Mini will show a super sharp definition. And it also reproduces the DCI-P3 color gamut, so creatives, movie watchers, and gamers will love its color accuracy.\n\nIf you need additional input methods, the Apple iPad Mini also supports the Apple Pencil Pro and Apple Pencil USB-C. This is great if you like jotting down notes or drawing.\n\nThe design and build quality are everything you can expect from Apple. The Apple iPad Mini A17 Pro has a full aluminum back and squared edges. The color options come in both traditional and fun hues, for every type of user.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been hoping to get an Apple iPad Mini A17 Pro, today is the best day to do so. Again, it\u2019s at an all-time low price, and such deals don\u2019t come too often.\n\nExtra deal: You can save more if you get the Apple iPad A16\n\nOf course, you get a larger 11-inch screen with a 2,360 x 1,640 resolution. It holds an A16 chipset and 6GB of RAM. That said, it is still plenty capable and can handle any app or game you throw at it. The only real downside is that the A16 doesn\u2019t support Apple Intelligence, so there\u2019s that.\n\nIf you want stylus support, you still get it with the Apple iPad, but it doesn\u2019t work with the Apple Pencil Pro. Instead, you\u2019ll need to use either an Apple Pencil USB-C or an Apple Pencil First Generation.",

Learn more.\nWhat are display color gamuts? sRGB, DCI-P3, Rec. 2020 explained\nSeptember 30, 2024\nMost of us don\u2019t think twice about how displays produce color. But if you\u2019ve ever looked at a sampling of televisions next to each other at an electronics store, you may have realized that practically none of them match up. Even if you play the same video, different displays just tend to process and output colors differently. So why is that?\nIt turns out that there\u2019s a hidden display specification most people don\u2019t know about, called color gamut. So in this article, let\u2019s take a closer look at color gamuts, how they affect image quality, and what you should look out for when shopping for your next display.\nWhat is a color gamut and why does it matter?\nIn general terms, the phrase color gamut simply refers to all of the colors our eyes can perceive. It is commonly represented by a horseshoe-shaped figure \u2014 called the xy chromaticity diagram (shown below). There\u2019s also a three-dimensional representation, but that\u2019s a technicality we don\u2019t need to worry about.\nWhen we\u2019re talking about computer graphics, however, gamut refers to a display\u2019s color handling capabilities. Simply put, it is a measure of the colors a given display can reproduce.\nKnowing a display's color gamut is enough to give you some indication of its color handling capabilities.\nDisplay color gamuts are a subset of the chromaticity diagram \u2014 almost always in the shape of a triangle, as shown below. In other words, displays can only output a fraction of all visible colors. sRGB, the most common display color gamut in use today, is highlighted in the following diagram. An sRGB display simply cannot reproduce any color that lies outside of the triangle.\nA larger triangular area means that the display\u2019s gamut covers a greater percentage of the visible spectrum. And as you\u2019d expect, the larger the overlap between a display\u2019s color gamut and what our eyes can distinguish, the better.\nNo consumer display on the market right now can cover our entire visual spectrum. But that\u2019s not a problem as such.\nA word on bit-depth\nBefore we can talk about the different types of color gamuts, it\u2019s worth understanding how displays produce colors in the first place. In a nutshell, virtually all displays are made up of tiny red, green, and blue sub-pixels that combine to output a desired color. These sub-pixels are invisible to our eyes, but you can see them pretty clearly under a microscope.\nTo that end, a wide color gamut isn\u2019t the only criteria necessary for an image to look good. Displays must also be capable of producing unique red, green, and blue shades within their limited gamut.\nWe use bit-depth to measure the number of unique shades a display can produce. Put simply, it is the amount of data used to indicate the brightness level of each sub-pixel.\nA higher bit-depth ensures that the display can accurately output subtle transitions or gradients between colors.\nA display with a bit-depth of 8 bits will produce 28 or 256 shades of each primary color (red, green, and blue). Combined, that gives you 16.7 million possible color combinations. A 10-bit display, on the other hand, can output 1,024 shades or a cumulative 1.07 billion colors.\nA higher bit-depth ensures that the display can accurately output subtle transitions or gradients between colors. This is simply because the display has more \u201csteps\u201d in between similar colors. Otherwise, you observe an effect commonly known as banding, which visually looks like well-demarcated gradations between similar colors. This is even more important for wide-gamut displays. An exaggerated rendition of this is highlighted in the above illustration.\nNow that we\u2019ve got the technical definitions out of the way, let\u2019s talk about the four most prominent color gamuts in use today.\nsRGB explained\nsRGB, or standard RGB, is the oldest but still the most commonly used color space. It was originally designed by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in the 1990s for CRT displays. Since then, it has been adapted for LCDs and other display technologies as well.\nWhile popular, sRGB only covers a fraction of the visible light spectrum. Put simply, an sRGB display can reproduce 25 to 33% of the colors our eyes can perceive. Looking at the chromaticity diagram, it\u2019s immediately apparent that we\u2019re missing a lot of the outer sections of each primary color.\nWhile sRGB includes a range of red, green, and blue shades, it doesn\u2019t cover the more saturated sections. This is especially true if you look at the green area. Naturally, this reduces the so-called vividness of the image, making colors look a bit more muted than they perhaps would in real life.\nWhile sRGB includes a range of red, green, and blue shades, it doesn\u2019t cover the more saturated sections.\nsRGB is closely related to the Rec. 709 gamut. In fact, the two standards cover the same area of the chromaticity diagram. The only difference is that sRGB uses a lower gamma value than Rec. 709.\nsRGB\u2019s lower gamma facilitates better color perception in brighter rooms such as an office space. Rec. 709, on the other hand, was designed for televisions and assumes that the display is viewed in dimly lit environments. Since most displays allow you to tweak the gamma yourself, the distinction between sRGB and Rec. 709 is largely irrelevant.\nIn spite of its limited color coverage, sRGB has become the dominant standard for displays of all shapes and sizes. Most PC operating systems, including Windows, are tuned for sRGB out of the box. Similarly, most websites and content are also designed with sRGB in mind.\nAdobeRGB: designed for photos\nAs you may have guessed, the AdobeRGB color space was developed and popularized by software giant Adobe. It is a wider gamut than sRGB, covering approximately 50% of the visible color spectrum.\nUnlike most other color spaces on this list, AdobeRGB is not used for video at all. Instead, it was designed specifically for photography and popularly used in programs like Adobe Lightroom. To understand why, we\u2019ll have to shift our focus to photo printers. You may have noticed that color printers don\u2019t combine red, green, and blue (RGB) ink to produce color prints.\nInstead, most color (and photo) printing equipment uses the CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) color model. In 1998, Adobe developed AdobeRGB to cover this color space and provide photographers with more control over their prints. In effect, AdobeRGB expands sRGB\u2019s limited coverage of cyan and green hues \u2014 immediately apparent if you look at the chromaticity diagram.\nWhile AdobeRGB is undoubtedly beneficial for photography, most cameras still default to the sRGB color space. This is because most images are viewed digitally, on screens that are limited to the sRGB gamut. Furthermore, even on compatible displays, most programs cannot output AdobeRGB.\nAdobeRGB has limited utility today because it was designed to mimic the color space used by photo printers.\nIf a website includes an AdobeRGB file, for example, web browsers will automatically attempt to render it in sRGB instead. However, this conversion process is not perfect and the result is often significantly worse-looking than an sRGB image.\nIn summary, handling AdobeRGB content requires the use of photo-specific software and tools. If the file is handled improperly at any point, you could end up with an inferior sRGB image. All of this, coupled with low consumer demand over the years, means that AdobeRGB is a niche color gamut today. Still, some high-end computer monitors offer a dedicated picture profile that is calibrated specifically for this use case.\nDCI-P3 or Display P3\nDigital Cinema Initiatives \u2014 Protocol 3, commonly shortened to DCI-P3 or Display P3, was developed by the cinema industry to replace sRGB.\nDCI-P3 covers a 25% larger area of the chromaticity diagram, a figure that\u2019s pretty similar to AdobeRGB. As opposed to AdobeRGB\u2019s green-cyan bias, however, P3\u2019s gains are more evenly spread out across all three primary colors. In practice, this means that DCI-P3 displays can output more saturated and vivid colors across the board.\nSince DCI-P3 was developed for use over a digital medium, it has seen much wider adoption than AdobeRGB. Almost every single device type, from televisions to smartphones, now aims for at least some coverage of this color space, with higher-end displays offering around or above 90% coverage.\nDCI-P3 has become increasingly popular over the past few years, and is considered the baseline for a good HDR display.\nAs with all color gamuts, keep in mind that you also need content mastered for DCI-P3 to appreciate the full extent of its range. If you view an image that was mastered for sRGB, you\u2019ll get much more saturated colors on a DCI-P3 display than the creator probably intended.\nDisplay P3 or DCI-P3 is a wider color gamut or space compared to sRGB. A Display P3 image will show more saturated colors compared to an sRGB one.\nRec. 2020, BT2020 and Rec. 2100\nRec. 2020 and 2100 are the newest gamuts on this list. Besides covering the largest area on the chromaticity diagram, Rec. 2020 also helped define the UHDTV (ultra high definition television) standard. In a nutshell, it was the first standard to include support for 10 and 12-bit displays alongside higher resolutions such as 4K and 8K. The specification also lists support for higher than 60Hz refresh rates, topping out at 120Hz.\nThe Rec. 2020 gamut, also referred to as the BTU2020, covers an impressive 75% of the visible light spectrum. That\u2019s a nearly 40% jump from DCI P3 and an even more significant leap from sRGB.\nIn fact, the color gamut is so wide that even the best consumer displays can only cover around 60 to 80% of it. Advancements in microLED, OLED and quantum dot display technologies, however, will likely improve their color reproduction capabilities in the long term.\nThe Rec. 2020 gamut covers an impressive 75% of the visible light spectrum, but most displays can't offer full coverage yet.\nRec. 2100, on the other hand, is an expansion of Rec. 2020. It leaves most parameters unchanged from Rec. 2020, including the color coverage. The only thing it adds is support for high dynamic range (HDR) through two techniques: hybrid log gamma (HLG) and perceptual quantization. The latter forms the basis of common HDR formats like HDR10 and Dolby Vision. HLG, on the other hand, is exclusively used for broadcast television.\nBeyond color: Color errors and white point\nWhile a wide color gamut is certainly desirable, it\u2019s not the only factor that determines how well a given display will perform. We\u2019ve already spoken at length about how gamma and bit-depth influence the overall perceived image.\nIn that vein, no two displays ever look the same, even if they boast nearly identical color gamuts. That\u2019s because there are a couple of other important metrics that can lead to variances in a display\u2019s color rendering capability. You typically won\u2019t find these attributes represented on most display spec sheets. Besides the display\u2019s gamut coverage, we also need to look at two more metrics, namely Delta E and color temperature.\nDelta E\nYou can think of Delta E as a way to measure the error in a display\u2019s color output. What does an error look like in practical terms? A display that makes reds look like dark orange, for example.\nMore specifically, though, Delta E measures the difference between a display\u2019s color output versus the standard gamuts like sRGB.\nThe above graph, for instance, shows our benchmark of the OnePlus 8 Pro\u2019s display against the sRGB standard. The result indicates that the display is well-calibrated in most areas, except for a couple of offshoots in the red-yellow sections. The average Delta E (or the difference between output and reference) in this case was approximately 2.8.\nFor context, a Delta E value below one represents an imperceptible error, at least to the human eye. Professionals that use calibrated displays tend to prefer a maximum Delta E of 2.0. Any higher than that and the shift in color accuracy quickly becomes apparent.\nColor temperature\nWhite point, also commonly known as color temperature, has a large impact on the appearance of whites on a display. The above image, for example, shows what \u201cwhite\u201d looks like on different smartphone displays.\nWe typically measure color temperature in Kelvin and you\u2019ll find values typically lie in the range of 4,000 to 7,000K. Why Kelvin when we\u2019re not talking about a display\u2019s actual temperature? Because the scale corresponds to the color of light radiated from a hot, glowing metal object. Think of a gas flame \u2014 you see reddish-yellow hues at one extreme and bluish tones at the other. In displays, we refer to whites with a blue cast as having a \u201ccooler\u201d look and vice-versa.\nColor standards typically expect displays to have a white point of 6,500K, also known as D65. For some context, the color temperature of sunlight lies somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 Kelvin.\nMost color gamuts are designed around the D65 white point, or 6,500 Kelvin.\nIf either the white point or Delta E values are off by a significant margin, it may be possible to recalibrate the display. In fact, even high-end displays that ship properly calibrated from the factory can experience drift after long periods of time. The tools needed to accomplish this, however, are not cheap. And unless you\u2019re a creative professional, you\u2019re unlikely to notice or care about a small error anyway.\nShould I buy a TV or display with a wide color gamut?\nOur eyes have become rather accustomed to the narrow sRGB gamut over the past few decades. However, that\u2019s only because, until recently, just a handful of displays featured wider color gamuts. These often cost a pretty premium too \u2014 so only creative professionals could justify picking one up. That\u2019s no longer true today, though.\nThe display industry has finally progressed to the point where mass-produced panels with wide color gamuts have become affordable. Simultaneously, advancements in camera technology have made it easier than ever for filmmakers to capture additional color detail. Combined, these two factors have made gamuts like DCI-P3 extremely accessible and affordable.\nMany mid-range and flagship smartphones these days strive to offer good coverage of the DCI-P3 color space, thanks to the proliferation of OLED displays. Many flagships, including Google\u2019s Pixel 8 series and Apple\u2019s iPhone 15, will even shoot photos and videos in a wider color gamut. Similarly, televisions and computer monitors are finally moving past sRGB as well. On the software side of things, major desktop and mobile operating systems also now support color spaces beyond sRGB.\nMany mid-range and flagship smartphones these days offer good coverage of the DCI-P3 color space, as do televisions and monitors.\nThe content industry\u2019s push for HDR has further helped drive demand for wider color spaces. Indeed, you\u2019ll find that most content \u2014 from video games to TV shows \u2014 is available in a wider color gamut than sRGB. Moreover, HDR sources such as gaming consoles, video streaming services, and even broadcast televisions are now readily available. Even web design standards like CSS are starting to include support for Display-P3 (Apple\u2019s implementation of DCI-P3).\nIn a nutshell, HDR aims to make images look more lifelike and realistic. As you\u2019d expect, delivering a more vivid color palette helps to achieve that goal. Most HDR formats, including Dolby Vision and HDR10+, mandate that displays and content covers the DCI-P3 color space at a minimum.\nThe display industry is also aiming for full coverage of the more expansive Rec. 2020 color space at some point in the future. While no consumer product delivers a color gamut that wide today, it\u2019s only a matter of time before that changes.\nBT 2020 or Rec 2020 is the widest color space adopted by the latest high-end displays. Adobe RGB is a smaller color space that was specifically created to produce the best results for traditional photo printing.\nThank you for being part of our community.
