  "description": "Yesterday, President Trump called for the resignation of Intel's CEO. Now, the executive is making it clear he has no plans to step aside.",
  "content": "Yesterday, President Donald Trump publicly called for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan\u2019s resignation, over accusations of \u201cdeeply conflicted\u201d ties to China. Now, he is speaking out and making it clear he has no plans to step aside.\n\nBefore joining Intel, Tan worked as CEO for Cadence Design Systems, a firm that just pleaded guilty to an investigation by the Justice Department over charges of \u201cselling its chip-design products to a Chinese military university,\u201d per the Wall Street Journal\u2019s description.\n\nTan was also the subject of a Reuters investigation earlier this year, which found that he had \u201cinvested in hundreds of Chinese tech firms, including at least eight with links to the People\u2019s Liberation Army\u201d.\n\nThis led at least two Republican Senators to publicly question Tan\u2019s suitability as Intel\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, and urge the board to consider new leadership.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks yesterday escalated things further, adding to months of escalating friction between Tan and Intel\u2019s board over the company\u2019s future.\n\nIn a letter sent to all Intel employees (and later published on the company\u2019s website), Tan pushed back on what he described as \u201cmisinformation\u201d about his past ties to China, and reiterated his commitment to both the company and the United States.\n\nDespite mounting pressure both inside and outside the company, Intel\u2019s board is standing by Tan for now, and the CEO says Intel is in active talks with the White House to clear the air:\n\nAfter falling 3% yesterday, Intel\u2019s stock spent most of the day down another 1% before bouncing back late in the session to close 0.9% higher. Still, shares remain 23% below the post-spike high that followed Tan\u2019s appointment as CEO.\n\nBelow is Tan\u2019s full letter to Intel employees:\n\nMy commitment to you and our company I know there has been a lot in the news today, and I want to take a moment to address it directly with you. Let me start by saying this: The United States has been my home for more than 40 years. I love this country and am profoundly grateful for the opportunities it has given me. I also love this company. Leading Intel at this critical moment is not just a job \u2013 it\u2019s a privilege. This industry has given me so much, our company has played such a pivotal role, and it\u2019s the honor of my career to work with you all to restore Intel\u2019s strength and create the innovations of the future. Intel\u2019s success is essential to U.S. technology and manufacturing leadership, national security, and economic strength. This is what fuels our business around the world. It\u2019s what motivated me to join this team, and it\u2019s what drives me every day to advance the important work we\u2019re doing together to build a stronger future. There has been a lot of misinformation circulating about my past roles at Walden International and Cadence Design Systems. I want to be absolutely clear: Over 40+ years in the industry, I\u2019ve built relationships around the world and across our diverse ecosystem \u2013 and I have always operated within the highest legal and ethical standards. My reputation has been built on trust \u2013 on doing what I say I\u2019ll do, and doing it the right way. This is the same way I am leading Intel. We are engaging with the Administration to address the matters that have been raised and ensure they have the facts. I fully share the President\u2019s commitment to advancing U.S. national and economic security, I appreciate his leadership to advance these priorities, and I\u2019m proud to lead a company that is so central to these goals. The Board is fully supportive of the work we are doing to transform our company, innovate for our customers, and execute with discipline \u2013 and we are making progress. It\u2019s especially exciting to see us ramping toward high-volume manufacturing using the most advanced semiconductor process technology in the country later this year. It will be a major milestone that\u2019s a testament to your work and the important role Intel plays in the U.S. technology ecosystem. Looking ahead, our mission is clear, and our opportunity is enormous. I\u2019m proud to be on this journey with you. Thank you for everything you\u2019re doing to strengthen our company for the future.\n\nWhat do you think Intel should do? Let us know in the comments.",

      "text": "When Lip-Bu Tan took over as Intel\u2019s CEO last March, the market reacted with a 13% stock bump, signaling renewed confidence in the company\u2019s future. But today, after weeks of internal tensions, Intel\u2019s situation has grown even more delicate, now drawing scrutiny from the White House.\nInternal pressure at Intel has been mounting for months\nAfter Tan was appointed as Pat Gelsinger\u2019s successor as Intel CEO, many saw it as a positive move to reset the company\u2019s strategy and leadership.\nTan, for his part, was quick to slash projects, jobs, products, and divisions, as he moved to get Intel to focus on what he saw as the company\u2019s biggest opportunities to get back on track, make up for lost time, and regain the trust of both the stock market, and the company\u2019s partners.\nThe problem is that the initial optimism quickly gave way to internal tension, especially amid growing uncertainty around tariffs, and as setbacks mounted across Intel\u2019s roadmap, including ongoing yield issues with its next-generation 18A process.\nTrump chimes in\nThings came to a head today, after President Donald Trump publicly called for Tan\u2019s resignation over what he described as the CEO\u2019s \u201chighly conflicted\u201d ties to China.\nMany have attributed that to the fact that before joining Intel, Tan used to lead Cadence Design, a firm which just pleaded guilty in an investigation by the Justice Department over charges of \u201cselling its chip-design products to a Chinese military university,\u201d per the Wall Street Journal\u2019s description.\nThe settlement had already raised alarms in Washington, leading at least two Republican Senators to publicly question Tan\u2019s suitability for the role and urge the board to consider new leadership. Trump\u2019s remarks earlier today escalated things further.\nIntel stands by Tan\nIntel, for its part, is publicly standing by Tan, despite months-long internal disagreements between him and company leadership over key issues. That includes whether Intel should remain in the chip manufacturing business, one of its core operations.\nFollowing Trump\u2019s public call for Tan\u2019s ouster, Intel\u2019s stock dropped 3% today, falling back to the level it was at before his appointment as CEO.\nAnd while shares had dipped to that range in prior weeks, largely due to ongoing tariff uncertainty, today\u2019s decline might be the signal of a broader unraveling, especially if Tan\u2019s position comes under even closer scrutiny in Washington, pushing Intel further into unprecedentedly dangerous territory.\nDo you think Lip-Bu Tan should resign?

Despite this pressure, Tan has defended his position, asserting his commitment to Intel and the U.S., while the company's board continues to support him.
