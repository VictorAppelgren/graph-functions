      "feedback": "The draft is technically sound and follows the structural‑horizon logic you asked for, but it fails the *Acceptance Gate* because it does **not map to any canonical market handle** (e.g., UST 10y, UST 2y, DXY, etc.). Mortgage rates are a derivative of the UST yield curve, so you must explicitly tie the analysis to a canonical handle—e.g., “UST 10y” or “UST 30y” (if you add a new handle).  \n\n**Actionable edits**\n\n1. **Add a canonical handle mapping**  \n   - Insert a sentence such as: “The 30‑year mortgage rate tracks the UST 10y yield plus a spread that reflects term‑premium and liquidity conditions.”  \n   - Cite the source: (LF0UUL917).  \n\n2. **Ensure every claim has a citation**  \n   - The draft already cites (LF0UUL917) throughout; double‑check that each paragraph ends with a citation.  \n\n3. **Remove any drift**  \n   - The draft is focused on mortgage rates; no drift detected.  \n\n4. **Add a brief note on the spread**  \n   - Mention that the spread between 30‑year mortgage rates and UST 10y yields is currently ~0.5 % and is a key transmission channel.  \n\nOnce the handle mapping is added, the analysis will satisfy the acceptance criteria and be ready for inclusion.",
