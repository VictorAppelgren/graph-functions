      "summary": "President Trump has demanded that pharmaceutical companies, including Pfizer and Moderna, provide evidence of the effectiveness of their COVID‑19 drugs, citing new FDA restrictions and a need for greater transparency. He criticized the firms for not publicly sharing results and called for answers amid ongoing CDC leadership turmoil and the rescission of emergency vaccine authorizations by HHS. The call follows Trump’s praise of Operation Warp Speed and coincides with political pressure on vaccine makers that has weighed on Pfizer and Moderna stock performance.",
