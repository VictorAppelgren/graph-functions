      "text": "Atlas PRIME\u00ae is ranked Best Provider Data Management Platform of 2025 by MedTech Breakthrough \u2192 Read More\nProvider data management solutions for enhanced accuracy and efficiency\nWe Help Keep Your Provider Data Accurate & Compliant\nWhy provider data management is important\nKeeping provider data and directories up to date is a complicated and challenging task \u2013 one that few payers have the time or resources to manage. Provider staff are also overworked and struggle to handle requests from multiple payers. As a result, this adds difficulty for payors working with provider offices and is only compounded by constantly changing, uncooperative, or unengaged provider staff.\nFailure to remain compliant with Federal and state regulations can have huge consequences: fines, brand damage, and poor member experiences. Provider Data Management (PDM) plays a pivotal role by helping payors maintain, manage, and validate provider information. Whether it\u2019s contact details, specialties, or availability, having access to accurate provider data is essential for delivering the best possible care to patients.\nThe atlas advantage\nAtlas\u2019 PRIME\u00ae solves this problem with primary source validation: a unique, gold-standard system grounded in direct outreach to contracted health systems, provider groups, and individual practitioners. Our many years of experience doing this in a streamlined fashion enables us to achieve better results at a lower cost compared with a health plan trying to do it themselves.\nWe also make sure your directory adheres to Federal (CMS) compliance standards, state regulatory compliance such as CA SB137, and the requirements of the No Surprises Act. Our solutions are also designed to be compatible with FHIR, facilitating seamless integration and data exchange.\nTo minimize provider abrasion and maximize compliance, we meet providers where they are \u2013 whether that\u2019s a phone call, self-service portal, or roster (with support for custom formats and direct/API integrations).\nPRIME\u00ae also utilizes an intuitive, browser-based dashboard \u2013 an all-in-one window into your findings and attestation progress. You can use our AI-driven Ask PRIME\u00ae engine to ask almost any question that you would like to answer from your data \u2013 with answers arriving in seconds!\nUnmatched success rate\nWe offer convenient, user-friendly attestation channels - including a state-of-the-art self-service portal - achieving success rates of 95% in validating provider data.\nKey Benefits:\n- Provider data validation at the source\n- Less than one month of implementation to go-live\n- Full audit transparency\n- Intuitive, browser-based dashboard with near real-time results\n- AI-powered tools\nSelf-service validation\nOur new Self-Service Portal (SSP) makes it much easier for providers to double-check and correct their own data. The intuitive platform can condense hundreds of columns of data into just a few, making updates simple and straightforward, and also allow optimized views of providers\u2019 data.\nThe SSP dramatically eases the providers\u2019 burden while making our own systems more efficient \u2013 a remarkable step forward in low-friction provider data collection. Its format is reminiscent of an Excel spreadsheet, which customers find intuitive to use, and the technology in the background allows us to embed business rules that can mitigate the risk of error and oversight.\nKey Benefits:\n- Reduce provider abrasion\n- Improve self-service validation speed\n- Eliminate errors from manual spreadsheets\nAI-powered dashboard\nOur intuitive, browser-based dashboard provides an all-in-one window into your findings and attestation progress in near real-time. You can also use our AI-driven Ask PRIME\u00ae feature to ask almost any question that you would like to answer from your data \u2013 with answers arriving in seconds!\nKey Benefits:\n- Customized dashboard for near real-time results\n- AI-powered tools to help you achieve more insights with less digging\nCMS Appointment Wait Time compliance\nFor health plans with products on the federal exchange, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will require plans to conduct annual \u2018secret shopper\u2019 surveys to measure and document appointment wait times for various products and markets in their network starting in January 2025. Participating health plans are required to achieve a 90% compliance rate and this process cannot be done in-house, but by an independent third-party partner not affiliated with the health plan.\nThis requirement presents at least two potential benefits to the plan. First, it can serve as a useful audit of your network --one that allows you to check your directory accuracy with a small but statistically valid sample. Second, with some design creativity and the addition of a few well-structured questions, this survey process could contribute meaningfully to the health plan\u2019s NCQA accreditation efforts.\nKey Benefits:\n- Over 12 years of experience conducting secret shopper surveys on behalf of health plans\n- Includes full statistical analysis and reporting\n- Ensure compliance with an end-to-end solution\nWhy Choose Atlas Systems?\nProvider data validation at the source\nMinimize provider abrasion\nEnsure compliance with complex and ever-evolving regulations\nCost-effective, responsive, and fast-moving partner\nFAQs About Provider Data Management Solutions\nHow can organizations get started with implementing Atlas Systems' provider data management solution?\nOrganizations can start by partnering with Atlas Systems to assess provider data workflows, configure platform settings, and set up real-time updates aligned with operational needs.\nWhat sets Atlas Systems apart from other provider data management solutions?\nAtlas Systems combines real-time data updates, configurable workflows, FHIR compatibility, and compliance with healthcare standards to deliver a complete provider data management system.\nHow does Atlas Systems handle real-time provider data updates?\nAtlas Systems captures provider updates from multiple systems, normalizes the information, and pushes accurate data back into payer and provider directories without delays.\nIs Atlas Systems\u2019 provider data solution HIPAA-compliant?\nYes, Atlas Systems\u2019 provider data management software is designed to meet HIPAA compliance requirements for handling protected healthcare information.\nHow do providers update their data within Atlas Systems\u2019 platform?\nProviders can update their information through self-service portals or integrated workflows that feed directly into the Atlas Systems platform for validation and reconciliation."
