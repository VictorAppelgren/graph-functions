      "feedback": "Overall: strong cross‑asset framing and multi-source texture, but the piece needs a disciplined, multi‑year regime map, tighter first‑principles anchors, a complete causal chain from AI displacement to pricing, explicit catalysts/invalidation, and numerics anchored to the cited sources. Actionable edits: (1) add a explicit horizon regime ladder with at least three states (e.g., Regime I: baseline productivity growth with gradual AI uptake; Regime II: acceleration of displacement requiring policy/manual reallocation; Regime III: stabilization via policy and external balances) and define transition conditions (e.g., AI‑task coverage thresholds, unemployment/participation shifts, tariff pass‑through, and Fed policy stance shifts as signaled at Jackson Hole); anchor these to first‑principles invariants (real rate differentials, terms of trade, productivity progress, BoP/current‑account signals) and spell out how each regime would alter risk premia and discount rates. (2) concretize the transmission mechanism with a canonical causal chain: AI adoption raises productivity, alters sectoral demand/supply, shifts unemployment and wage dynamics, feeds back to inflation/monetary policy, reprices risk assets (equities, crypto, rates) via shifts in expected real returns; tie each link to at least one source datum. (3) sharpen base case and add explicit scenario ranges: e.g., Ether around recent highs near 4,955 dollars and Bitcoin around 112–124k during the regime shift, with a multi‑year path under a gradual 25–50bp of cumulative Fed easing if Powell’s framework materializes (cite OGK8WLL69 data); avoid over‑asserting crypto leadership—present a probabilistic path with a central path plus ±20% bands. (4) enumerate catalysts and invalidate‑signals crisply: Powell Jackson Hole remarks and rate‑cut bets; GENIUS Act/Project Crypto and ETF inflows as catalysts; macro tariffs and supply‑chain pass‑through as risks; invalidate if policy stays restrictive longer than expected or if crypto liquidity fractures; cite the corresponding statements in OGK8WLL69 and Powell‑related source. (5) address conflicts and nuance: explicitly flag UBI/identity literature (NL5YYTLF2) as a debated channel with mixed empirical evidence (Finland trials, mental‑health risks) and present a calibrated stance rather than a uniform bullish read; reconcile with crypto adoption narratives by differentiating policy/institutional acceptance from speculative flows (OGK8WLL69). (6) tighten sourcing discipline: weave NL5YYTLF2 for the identity/UBI channel, BS3876D03 for radar/coverage analogies as a caution on imperfect signal transmission, and OGK8WLL69 for crypto macro‑regime, with precise in‑text pulls (e.g., cite ETH/BTC price levels and rate‑cut expectations) rather than generic statements; avoid extrapolations beyond the cited data. (7) elevate numerical discipline and add a watchlist: monitor Fed communications at the Sept FOMC; ETF/treasury flows into ETH/BTC; corporate treasury activity (Bitmine Immersion et al.); tariff developments; and select crypto/stock correlations under the regime paths (cite OGK8WLL69, NL5YYTLF2). (8) improve readability without sacrificing rigor: present a compact, one‑page sheet that enumerates base case, three regime states with triggers, a concise causal chain, a clearly defined watch list, and a succinct set of risks with quantified ranges. These edits will align the analysis with the SECTION FOCUS (multi‑year horizon, first‑principles anchors, regime transitions, and a transparent base case with risks and what to watch) while enhancing depth, specificity, and citation integrity (NL5YYTLF2, OGK8WLL69, BS3876D03). Citations to weave in: (NL5YYTLF2)(OGK8WLL69)(BS3876D03) in the revised segments, with targeted pulls from OGK8WLL69 for price/monetary policy anchors and NL5YYTLF2 for the UBI/identity channel.",
