  "title": "Why I Won't Be Buying the iPhone 17 Air on Release Day",
  "description": "The new iPhone sounds promising, but let someone else do a trial run before you buy.",
  "content": "There are few things more exciting than buying a brand-new product on launch day, but if you\u2019re set on the iPhone 17 Air, feel free to let people cut you in line. From past production troubles to a device that\u2019s possibly just a novelty, it may be a good idea to see what others say first before forking over your money.\n\nWhy I Won\u2019t Be First in Line\n\nOn paper, the new slim iPhone sounds rather promising. Current rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Air will have decent stats: either the A19 or a GPU-nerfed A19 Pro chipset, 16GB of RAM, a 6.6-inch OLED display with 120Hz ProMotion support, and a 48MP single-lens camera.\n\nIt\u2019s all speculation before Apple's big reveal, but it\u2019s the camera that can potentially disappoint me the most, as ultrawide and telephoto lenses are pretty handy. I also worry that the slim design may have a big impact on battery performance, and I\u2019m not alone in worrying about these things.\n\nA big thing folks also have to worry about this year is that the iPhone 17 lineup may be more expensive than years prior due to the rising cost of components. We'll have to wait for Apple\u2019s official announcement before we get a look at any price tags, but some reports remain optimistic that the iPhone 17 Air will be priced at $899. Should this rumor hold true, it\u2019s a good selling point for the device, but it\u2019s hard not to wonder in this current climate if maintaining the same price as similarly-specced models of yesteryear doesn\u2019t come without sacrifice.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also the issue that it can be hard to trust first-run production models for brand new product lines. It can feel like you\u2019re a beta tester, simply hoping that the device you just paid for has gone through rigorous testing and will stand up to the everyday tests of the real world. You certainly want that to be the case, but remember the R1 Rabbit? Big on promises with little delivery.\n\nObviously, Apple isn\u2019t even in the same league, but that doesn\u2019t mean the company hasn\u2019t bungled a release.\n\nIt Wouldn\u2019t Be the First Time\n\nNot every iPhone has had a disastrous first day\u2013far from it. However, there have been plenty of instances where going all-in on a first-run production hasn\u2019t worked out. In recent times, it was the iPhone 15 Pro series that experienced severe heating issues just days after release, which was patched with a software update. There were also obvious production and supply issues during the COVID-19 pandemic\u2013with the iPhone 13 series being a good example\u2013but obviously faulting Apple for this would be bullheaded.\n\nLooking further into the past, the iPhone 5 had issues after manufacturer Foxconn returned millions of assembled devices to Apple for failing standards, and let\u2019s not forget \u201cAntennagate\u201d and the iPhone 4. Between the company going with a stainless steel band doubling as an antenna and Steve Jobs insisting users were holding their devices incorrectly, it really wasn't a good look for anyone\u2013especially people who thought they needed to find a new way to hold their iPhone.\n\nBut perhaps my fears are most justified by the fact that Apple has literally had problems with slim iPhones in the past. In 2014, the iPhone 6 Plus underwent its infamous \u201cBendgate\u201d controversy after some unfortunate consumers discovered that even putting the device in their pocket could bend it. Critics note that the aluminum unibody design and lack of proper reinforcement caused far more bending in devices than Apple was initially willing to admit, with the company stating it planned to address the issue in future production runs.\n\nI'm Going to Wait and See\n\nDespite problems in the past, it\u2019s still rather likely that the iPhone 17 Air launch will go well for millions of people. Though there is the potential for issues, it\u2019s a bit like being afraid to go in the ocean because you\u2019ll get bitten by a shark. Sure, there\u2019s a small chance it may happen, but it\u2019s more likely that it won\u2019t (unless you live somewhere where shark attacks are common, in which case I'd urge you to think twice before rolling that dice).\n\nI\u2019m willing to admit some of my skepticism arises from being victim to the overheating iPhone 15 Pro. Slight bias aside, the idea that the iPhone 17 Air may experience bending issues in its first production run isn\u2019t unfounded, though Apple is pretty good at learning from its mistakes. Rumors suggest that the new device will be made of titanium, which tracks rather well, likely giving it a far better chance of standing up to the forces of nature compared with the iPhone 6 series. However, how much reinforcement is inside the iPhone remains to be seen.\n\nThis then begs the question: how long should you wait before you put your money where your mouth is? Given this release, my honest answer would depend greatly on when you last updated your iPhone and when the first sale of the iPhone 17 Air begins.\n\nGetting any day-one device is always something of a gamble. The vast majority of the time, you get the pleasure of getting access to advanced tech the moment it comes out. However, when it doesn\u2019t work out, it can blossom into a total nightmare. If you want to get the iPhone 17 Air the moment it releases, there's probably not a lot I can say to deter you. More than likely, you\u2019re going to have a great time, and using iOS 26 on that beautiful new screen is going to be a real treat. But don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to come without some risks.\n\nIf you\u2019re the cautious type, I think it would be in your best interest to wait for a product teardown of the iPhone 17 Air or at least a fully comprehensive review\u2013which we\u2019ll naturally oblige, of course. Most issues start to rear their head within the first few weeks of a device being put through its paces, while other more obvious shortcomings (like a disappointing battery life) are immediately apparent.\n\nIf you really want to be frugal, waiting to upgrade isn\u2019t always a bad thing, and the iPhone 16 series can also treat you right.\n\u2022 $700 at Apple $700 at Best Buy\n\u2022 A version of Apple's newest iPhone with a larger screen featuring a camera button, a programmable action button, and artificial intelligence features. $999 at Apple $999 at Best Buy\n\nIf you\u2019re the type that blows caution to the wind or doesn\u2019t particularly worry about funds, I\u2019d consider the iPhone 17 Pro if you\u2019re looking to go big.

      "text": "It\u2019s nearly time for Apple to woo us with shiny new gadgets, and this year\u2019s worst-kept secret is the upcoming announcement of an ultra-thin iPhone 17. Dubbed the \u201cAir\u201d by anyone familiar with Apple\u2019s naming schemes, the device follows in the footsteps of the Samsung S25 Edge as a sliver of premium Apple smartphone for those who value pocket space.\nFor me, it\u2019s iPhone upgrade year. My 13 Pro feels a bit rusty, and the charging port has been playing up. Despite the opportunity, I don\u2019t find myself tempted by the slimmest iPhone 17.\nWhat the Rumors Say\nThe thin iPhone 17 has yet to be announced, but the rumor mill has been swirling and spitting out tidbits of information for well over a year. While nothing is confirmed and everything should be taken with a grain of salt, current rumors point to a super-flat profile that\u2019s around 5.5mm thick, which would make it just 0.2mm thicker than the impossibly thin 11-inch iPad Pro and significantly thinner than the 8.25mm iPhone 16 Pro (excluding the camera bump, obviously).\nIt is expected that the \u201cAir\u201d will have a 6.6-inch display, which sits somewhere between a regular-sized iPhone 16 and the larger Plus and Pro Max models. Rumors also point to the same OLED panel upgrade as the base model iPhone 17, since Apple is expected to finally equip the whole generation with 120Hz displays.\nIt has also been suggested that a new, thinner iPhone would use a titanium alloy body, rather than the aluminum seen in the current base model iPhones. This sounds reassuring for anyone who remembers \u201cbendgate\u201d during the iPhone 6 era, where the Plus models in particular incurred permanent damage on account of the malleable chassis. The use of titanium will add some extra weight and likely push the price up somewhat.\nSince Apple is also expected to drop the Plus base model iPhone this year (instead leaving only the high-end Pro Max for anyone who loves a phablet), it\u2019s quite possible the \u201cAir\u201d will occupy the same price bracket at around $899. That said, brace yourselves for a price hike, given that this is a brand-new iPhone model released during economically uncertain times.\nThere are many reasons that a slim iPhone 17 could succeed and become a best-seller for Apple, but I\u2019m yet to be swayed by any of them.\nI\u2019ll Put a Case on It Anyway\nHow many \u201cnaked\u201d iPhones do you see out in the wild? I love the way my titanium iPhone 13 Pro looks and feels without a case on it, but I also love having an iPhone that lacks dents and a broken screen. There\u2019s absolutely no way I\u2019ll be investing around a thousand dollars and not encasing my iPhone in a hunk of rubbery plastic to save me from my own clumsy self.\nI\u2019ve no doubt that upon walking into an Apple Store sometime after the product launch, I\u2019ll be wowed by the razor-thin iPhone in all its glory. It will undoubtedly feel glorious in the hand, like a futuristic piece of engineering that\u2019ll make my existing model feel bloated by comparison. I had a similar experience when I saw the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge for the first time.\nBut how long will this spectacle last? I\u2019ll probably preorder a case the second I preorder my new iPhone. By the time I\u2019ve taken everything out of its packaging, most of Apple\u2019s engineering will be hidden away.\nI\u2019m partial to the Quad Lock family of cases, which have saved me from cracked screens more times than I could possibly imagine. This is down to a small \u201clip\u201d that rises above the surface of the screen. When your iPhone lands not-quite-face-down and clips a curb, it\u2019s the case that takes the scuff. My last Quad Lock case was polished shiny from hand grease, warped from the Australian heat, and covered in battle scars that I wore with pride. The iPhone beneath is pristine.\nA thinner iPhone would mean a thinner case, but applying a case at all means immediately undoing much of the reason you\u2019d pick a device like this. After all, the iPhone needs to be able to take a knock; it\u2019s not an iPad Pro that lives on a coffee table, or a MacBook Air that gets transported in a bag designed for this purpose.\nA Single Camera? No Thanks\nOutside of a temperamental charging port, which I could (and will, eventually) get fixed, the main reason I\u2019m upgrading from the iPhone 13 Pro is to reap the camera benefits. Despite owning a decent Sony mirrorless camera that shoots magnificent photos and videos, my iPhone is still my primary shooter. I take it everywhere and never think twice about squeezing the proverbial shutter.\nWhile the wide (1x) camera on my iPhone 13 Pro looks great, the ultrawide (0.5x) and telephoto (3x) leave much to be desired. This is especially true when comparing my photos to those shot by my partner, who last year upgraded to the iPhone 16 Pro. I absolutely love having a range of focal lengths to choose from, and I\u2019m eager to see a quality upgrade across the board.\nThe iPhone 17 \u201cAir\u201d is rumored to only have a single camera, much like the regular base model iPhone. While Apple has jacked the megapixel count up to 48 and implemented a lossless 2x zoom that effectively crops the sensor down to 24MP to avoid losing image quality, I\u2019m simply not interested in going back to a single lens camera.\nIf you\u2019re enthusiastic or even curious about photography, I\u2019d strongly recommend springing for a Pro model iPhone. The only downside here is that the choice of focal lengths has absolutely ruined my ability to ever consider an iPhone with a single camera ever again. I\u2019m locked into the Pro lineup from here on out unless Apple makes some big changes to the base models.\nIronically, the iPhone 17 Pro leaks point to the inclusion of a seriously chunky camera block this year, which I\u2019ll happily admit looks terrible. Nevertheless, I\u2019m always going to pick function over form when it comes to the camera (and I\u2019ll pay considerably more for it).\nMiddling Battery Life Out of the Gate\nMy iPhone 13 Pro is still on its original battery, which means I have to charge it fully at least once a day with a few top-ups here and there. I\u2019m a \u201csipper\u201d in this regard\u2014I\u2019ll whack my phone on charge 20 minutes before leaving the house to go from 20% to 70%, and I never charge overnight. Suffice to say, I\u2019m used to poor battery life and anxiety-inducing single-digit percentage readings.\nNow consider for a moment that the iPhone 17 Air will have less room for battery than any iPhone that came before it. Forget the camera or the cooling; it\u2019s likely that battery life will be the biggest sacrifice that Apple will have to make to shave a few millimeters from the device\u2019s overall thickness. The inclusion of Apple\u2019s in-house C1 modem\u2014first seen in the \u201cbudget\u201d iPhone 16e\u2014will certainly help scrape back some power efficiency, but it can only go so far.\niPhone 16e\n- Brand\n- Apple\n- SoC\n- A18\nThe iPhone16e is an affordable addition to the iPhone 16 line, costing $200 less than the base iPhone 16.\nSo far, numbers thrown around by analysts range from 2,800 to 3,000mAh. For comparison, the iPhone 16 has a 3,561mAh battery while the 16 Pro Max houses a 4,676mAh cell. Apple increased these capacities last year, and rumors suggest the same will be happening again this year (with the 17 Pro potentially looking at a boost to somewhere in the region of 5,000mAh).\nOne of the big contributors to that \u201cnew iPhone feeling\u201d is a fresh battery that seems to last all day long. But things aren\u2019t looking great for the iPhone 17 \u201cAir\u201d\u2014particularly when you factor in a few years of aging. I\u2019ve come to expect my iPhone battery to lose around 30% of its total capacity within three years, though Apple adopting silicon-carbon batteries could offer a boost.\nThe good news here is that owners of a slim iPhone could remedy this relatively easily with a MagSafe battery pack. The downside is that the battery pack attaches to the back of the iPhone, adding thickness.\nI\u2019m Not the Target Audience\nThere\u2019s undoubtedly a group of people out there for whom the iPhone 17 \u201cAir\u201d makes a lot of sense, but I\u2019ve come to realize that I\u2019m not in it. I\u2019m quite happy with how much space the iPhone 13 Pro takes up in my pocket. I have big hands, so I have no issues reaching the furthest edge or gripping the phone. I\u2019ve been lugging a titanium brick around for four years, and I have no qualms about the associated weight.\nI\u2019m also way more excited about the gains that Apple will make with the iPhone 17 Pro. Three cameras at 48MP, a potentially anti-reflective display that\u2019s better at preventing scratches, better battery life, the performance boost in the form of a new A19 Pro chip, and all the features I\u2019ve missed out on in four years of not upgrading\u2014Camera Control, Dynamic Island, faster charging speeds, and Apple Intelligence (for what that\u2019s worth).\nIf you\u2019re a fan of Plus-sized iPhones but don\u2019t have the budget to stretch to the Pro Max models, you might want to buy an iPhone 16 Plus sooner rather than later. Alternatively, maybe the iPhone 17 Air is exactly what you\u2019re hoping for.\nWe\u2019ll have to wait and see how the dust settles when Apple announces its new hardware sometime in September. Looking back at 2024, the iPhone 16 family was unveiled on September 10 and released more than a week later on September 20 alongside iOS 18."

Its titanium frame is lighter weight while even more elegant in the hand. The camera system gains enhancements, too. Even the USB-C port allows for more charging convenience. The iPhone 15 Pro, while better, is just less interesting than the 14 Pro was when it introduced an always-on display and Dynamic Island. The iPhone 15 Pro might not be the splashiest phone ever released by Apple, but its details are what make it worth the purchase.\nApple iPhone 15 Pro\n- SoC\n- A17 Pro\n- Display\n- 6.1-inch, 2556 x 1179 resolution\n- RAM\n- 8GB\n- Storage\n- 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1T\nThe Apple iPhone 15 Pro features a titanium design with Action button, A17 Pro chip, USB-C port, and a 48MP camera.\n- Ports\n- USB-C\n- Operating System\n- iOS 17\n- Colors\n- Wide color (P3)\n- Weight\n- 6.60oz (187g)\n- IP Rating\n- IP68\n- Material\n- Titanium, glass\n- Main Camera\n- 48MP 24 mm, \u0192/1.78 aperture\n- Wide-Angle Camera\n- 12MP 13 mm, \u0192/2.2 aperture\n- Telephoto\n- 12MP 3x 77 mm, \u0192/2.8 aperture\nThe Design of a Mature iPhone Pro\nApple touted a new design of the iPhone 15 Pro at the phone\u2019s launch event, but until you hold it in your hand, those design tweaks are almost imperceptible. It looks like the last few phones before it.\nOnce you do palm the 15 Pro, its refinements are immediately evident. For example, its 19g weight loss compared to the 14 Pro is roughly a 10% difference. It felt lighter to hold in a way that could be meaningful throughout the day. The subtly rounded edges of the titanium frame also felt great.\nAltogether, the phone felt utterly polished, in a way only a constantly refined product could be. It actually felt so great in my hand that I dreaded putting a case on it\u2014so far, I haven't. The titanium sides will get smudgy from fingerprints. I don\u2019t care. For now, it still looked good and felt smooth between my fingers.\nIn the same vein of the exterior being elevated rather than changed, the Action button doesn\u2019t look all that different from the previous mute switch. It\u2019s about the same size and shape. In function, however, it\u2019s completely different with the ability to personalize what it does. My first instinct was to use the button to launch the camera, making it the shutter button once the camera was in use.\nTo use the Action button it does require a slight hold delay. If you simply tap the button quickly, the iPhone will display an icon in the Dynamic Island of what it\u2019s programmed to do and then instruct you to hold the button down longer to activate it. I didn\u2019t find it annoying or difficult to master. It did feel odd to use as my go-to trigger switch at first, though.\nAfter several days of tinkering with the customizable button, I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019ll ever be able to decide on a single function. Most likely, I\u2019ll keep changing what it does. I love its addition to the Pro line. For now, I\u2019ve landed on using it for a Shortcut that brings up a menu of items, such as toggling orientation lock or launching the Sonos app\u2014we\u2019ll see how long that lasts.\nUSB-C Is Super Fun and Weird!\nThe Lightning port had a good run, but it\u2019s time for USB-C. It doesn\u2019t matter why the new port is here now. It\u2019s only important that it is here.\nBecause this is a \"Pro\" phone, the port gets USB 3 speeds, which, in this case, means 10Gbps transfer speeds. This phone can also be connected to a storage device and used as direct storage when shooting video.\nWhat I was most interested in was using the new port for charging\u2014in all kinds of ways. Although people buying the Pro iPhone could be more likely to use it for video transfers or something more advanced, nearly everyone will plug their phone in for power at some point.\nI tried all sorts of USB-C cables\u2014cheap ones and more expensive ones. All of them performed fine and powered the iPhone 15 Pro. The braided USB-C cable the iPhone 15 Pro comes with was satisfying to plug in the first time.\nThe iPhone itself can share power with other devices like AirPods, Apple Watch, and even another iPhone. Of course, the iPhone 15 Pro will only provide 4.5W of power, so it is best suited to boost small accessories. But it did work.\nEven though the USB-C port is boring\u2014Hi, Android phone owners\u2014it\u2019s still the part of the phone that gets interacted with on a regular basis. The port is a solid addition that doesn\u2019t get locked down in any strange ways.\nOther USB-C notes\n- I bought a Ugreen USB-C to 3.5mm headphone jack for under $10, and it worked instantly. The same adapter worked on my iPad and Mac too.\n- The USB-C to Lightning cable I used to charge my AirPods 3 from the iPhone was the one that came in the box last year with the iPhone 14 Pro.\n- The new Beats Studio Pro headphones can plug in directly to the 15 Pro to play lossless audio over the included USB-C cable.\nThe Minor Improvements of the iPhone 15 Pro Camera\nThe first thought for discussing the 15 Pro camera system might be the photos themselves. They\u2019re good, but all iPhones have done well at taking \u201cgood\u201d pictures for the last five years, at least. My first thought was to try the different camera focal lengths.\nIf you tap on the 1x icon in the Camera app, it will toggle between 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm focal lengths\u2014also shown as 1x, 1.2x, and 1.5x. Last year\u2019s 14 Pro, with its default 24mm focal length, pushed the distance farther away than it had been in the past. It was something that continually tripped me up as I shot product pictures for reviews.\nNot only can you change these focal lengths, but in the settings for the Camera app, you can pick a default one and turn any of them off that you don\u2019t want to toggle through. Until recently, I would have hesitated about doing this and relying on a digital zoom. In this case, there isn\u2019t any part of the iPhone\u2019s camera system that isn\u2019t digital or processed. The picture-taking pipeline bins pixels and enhances the end photo for all focal lengths and in nearly every setting.\nBased on the specs Apple has made public, the camera sensors in the 15 Pro are the same as the ones in the 14 Pro. The camera system this year does have more capabilities, however. Likely enabled by the A17 Pro chip, the camera shoots 24MP photos by default, which have more detail.\nSo there will be some differences in the pictures taken by the 14 Pro and 15 Pro phones, but it\u2019s not because of any hardware enhancements\u2014it's because of digital processing upgrades, probably tied to the better phone chip.\nI could tell a difference between iPhone 14 Pro and 15 Pro pictures, but only when comparing them directly next to each other. When separated, it was harder to tell. You will need to consider how much you're willing to spend to get minor year-over-year improvements in this area.\nThe sample images below haven\u2019t been retouched or edited in any way\u2014only converted from .heic to .jpeg at full resolution. The landscape gallery shows a progression of 24mm, 28mm, 35mm, 2x, and 3x. The picture of the succulent shows a progression of 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm.\nThe 3x zoom helped extend reach, but as you can see above, there is a noticeable difference between the main camera and the telephoto one. The zoom feature alone would not be worth upgrading from the iPhone 15 to the 15 Pro. (It would need to be that, plus other aspects of the Pro phone.) Interestingly, the 15 Pro Max's new 5x telephoto camera has a bigger sensor which results in better pictures. But you'll have to read How-To Geek's full review on that phone to get the scoop on that camera system.\nIn terms of the front-facing camera, there are no surprises here. It's the same 12MP camera as it was last year. There are tiny enhancements on the software side like Smart HDR 5, instead of Smart HDR 4 on the 14 Pro. But really, the photos look the same. A sample photo from the front-facing camera is below.\niPhone 15 Pro Performance With a Pro Chip\nThe A17 Pro is Apple's first 3nm chip. The smaller the fabrication process, the potential for more power or more energy savings, or a combination of the two, comes into play. In this case, Apple claims a 10% processing gain while stating the same battery life as last year's 14 Pro. There is a 6-core GPU in the 15 Pro, while there was a 5-core GPU in the previous model. So this year's Pro phone should be 20% faster for graphics processing simply because more capability was added to the chip.\nI don't have many examples of how this faster A17 Pro chip delivered speedier experiences. Most likely, what's happening is that Apple is enabling more experiences in the Camera app, in photo processing, and how the system continues to keep everything running smoothly. And, of course, playing games. The casual games I play don't push the boundaries in any way. But all of them ran smoothly and loaded a touch quicker.\niOS 17 on iPhone 15 Pro\nThe star of the show for iOS 17 on iPhone 15 Pro is StandBy mode. Although anyone with an iOS 17-compatible phone can experience the ambient information displayed from clocks and widgets, only iPhone 14 Pro owners, or now people with an iPhone 15 Pro\u2014phones that have an always-on display\u2014can experience it continually, as a nightstand display.\niPhone 15 Pro Battery Life\nHaving only limited time with the phone initially, long-term battery life is to be determined. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth hollowly posturing about what could be after a short time. I will say that in early use, my battery life seemed to be about the same as it was on the 14 Pro. It was aggressively average and didn\u2019t stick out as better in any way. Make of that what you will.\nUpgrading From a 14 Pro to the 15 Pro\nThere\u2019s very little reason to justifiably upgrade from a 14 Pro to a 15 Pro. But here\u2019s what I\u2019ve noticed initially.\n- The USB-C port has already been convenient for the cables I have around my house.\n- The 15 Pro\u2019s weight reduction is more noticeable at first and becomes the new normal within a day or two.\n- Battery life was fine on the new phone, even through heavy initial use, but ultimately about the same between last year and this year.\n- Photos from the 15 Pro are better when comparing them directly to ones from the 14 Pro, but most people will have a hard time telling the two results apart.\n- The 14 Pro's mute switch immediately felt antiquated going back to it a few days later\u2014it only does one thing!\nPrice and Availability\nThe iPhone 15 Pro starts at $999 for 128GB of storage and goes up from there. It\u2019s available in four shades of gray: white, blue, natural, and black.\nShould You Buy the Apple iPhone 15 Pro?\nThis is an expensive question. Unfortunately, there is no formula that says when each person should upgrade their iPhone\u2014or pick a Pro model versus the regular one. My recommendation is that most people should probably upgrade every three years, general enthusiasts every two years, and early adopters will find a way to justify a new iPhone every year.\nYou should know where you fall within that spectrum. As a final parting note. The iPhone 14 Pro seemed like the most advanced Pro phone in a while, with its visible always-on display and Dynamic Island. The iPhone 15 Pro, however, feels like the nicest, most premium iPhone\u2014possibly ever.\nApple iPhone 15 Pro\n- SoC\n- A17 Pro\n- Display\n- 6.1-inch, 2556 x 1179 resolution\n- RAM\n- 8GB\n- Storage\n- 128GB, 256GB, 512GB, 1T\nThe Apple iPhone 15 Pro features a titanium design with Action button, A17 Pro chip, USB-C port, and a 48MP camera."

      "text": "The iPhone 15 Pro is a hot commodity, but is it too hot? Some of the earliest iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max users say that their phone overheats while using apps or charging. These reports are completely anecdotal, of course, but they're common enough to be worth your attention.\nReports of overheating cropped up shortly after the iPhone 15 Pro's launch. Many of these reports come from random Twitter and Reddit users, though the Wall Street Journal spoke one-on-one with customers who have experienced the issue. One customer contacted Apple and was told that excessive heat may occur during the iPhone setup process\u2014days later, the customer says that his iPhone 15 Pro Max is still too hot. Some professionals in the tech industry have also run into this problem.\nStill, we don't have concrete evidence to prove that this is a problem. And we can't verify the anecdotal experience of other people. It's also hard to pin down anything that might be responsible for overheating. Ming Chi-Quo, a respected Apple analyst, says that the iPhone 15 Pro's titanium frame is the problem. Titanium is a fantastic insulator, so this isn't a bad theory, but the iPhone 15 Pro's titanium frame is only 1mm thick. And the phone's internal frame, which is now made of aluminum instead of stainless steel, should (theoretically) draw more heat away from the phone's internal components.\nThe writers here at How-To Geek regularly test new phones, and in our experience, it's not uncommon for a phone to get alarmingly hot during setup. The iOS and Android operating systems have a very intense setup process that can take several hours or even a full day. The length of your setup process largely depends on the amount of data (apps, contacts, etc) associated with your previous device. Using or charging the phone during setup will force it to produce more heat, which may explain why some customers are met with an overheating notification while charging or playing games.\nWe reviewed the iPhone 15 Pro and didn't run into overheating or other defects. Other publications, including CNET, Ars Technica, and Mashable, do not mention overheating in their reviews of this phone. If overheating is truly a problem, it doesn't appear to be very widespread. Maybe it's the result of some defect, or it may be the result of specific user behavior.\nWe'll continue keeping an eye on this situation, and we'll update this post with any new information we come across.\nSource: Bloomberg and Wall Street Journal via MacRumors"

      "text": "Quick Links\nYour iPhone is getting a big update come the fall with the release of iOS 26, the yearly refresh of Apple\u2019s mobile operating system. Free for all iPhone owners with a supported device, iOS 26 signals a change to Apple\u2019s naming convention and brings a fresh new look to your iPhone. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.\nWhat Happened to iOS 19?\nYou\u2019d be forgiven for thinking that iOS 18 would naturally become iOS 19, but the next release will in fact be iOS 26. We just skipped five whole version numbers because Apple is standardizing its software version naming convention by moving to years instead.\nFor 2026, that\u2019s iOS 26. The same naming convention will be used across all of Apple\u2019s software releases going forward, which should make it easier to remember as long as you keep in mind that the iPhone released in 2025 will in fact be running the software release named after 2026 (which itself also releases in 2025).\niOS 26 Design\nFront and center at Apple\u2019s WWDC 2025 presentation was the announcement that the company is adopting a new design for iOS 26, the first major redesign since iOS 7. Apple uses the term \u201cLiquid Glass\u201d to describe the new look, which features lots of transparency and some neat-looking glass effects like light refraction.\nThe new look seamlessly adapts between light and dark, with icons and interface elements tinted using the customization options that Apple added last year in iOS 18. There\u2019s also a new \u201cclear\u201d look mode for minimalists and anyone who wants their background image to take center stage. It looks fluid and impressive, though some commenters (and staff members at How-To Geek) have raised concerns about readability, particularly for lighter elements.\nApple says that the new look is only possible thanks to advancements in chip design, notably GPU power. How these effects will hold up on older devices remains to be seen. Thankfully the redesign goes beyond a simple reskin, as Apple also appears to have made things feel more functional across the operating system.\nRedesigned on-screen elements float above content and shrink and grow as you scroll up and down. Apple noted that iOS 18 still leaned heavily on a design language that was left over from the days of rectangular screens and that the new approach emphasizes the rounded edges of modern iPhones.\nApple also showed off changes to the context menu that appears when you highlight text. iOS 26 no longer requires you to scroll horizontally to find features like text formatting controls, instead expanding the menu so that you can quickly pick what you\u2019re looking for.\nAs is becoming a theme, the new look is unified across all devices. That means that the Mac gets it, as do other devices like the Apple Watch.\niOS 26 Features\nIn addition to a new look that will also change the way you use your iPhone, Apple will be rolling out several new features and changes to existing apps and services with iOS 26.\nImprovements to the Lock & Home Screen\nIn keeping with the Liquid Glass aesthetic, the iOS 26 home screen has a new design. The clock now has a glassy look that reacts when you tilt your device, and it even conforms to the background image you choose, growing and shrinking in size. This happens when you scroll through your notifications too, with the focal point of your background image (like a face) moving and resizing the clock.\nThere\u2019s a new pronounced 3D effect for \u201cSpatial\u201d background images, which gives more depth to 2D images and allows them to react to your movement. You can also tap on album art in the Now Playing widget that appears on your lock screen to view Apple Music album art in full-screen view (with animations for supported albums).\nApple also claims that things on the lock screen are more responsive (we\u2019ll have to wait and see, but the move to 120Hz on the base iPhone 17 will likely have a far more pronounced effect here).\nMore Immersive Safari\nSafari is an app that looks to benefit greatly from Apple\u2019s new Liquid Glass design. Webpages now run edge to edge all of the time, as Apple finally does away with the boxy look of iOS 18 that cuts off the top and bottom of the content.\nThe tab bar at the bottom has been redesigned to now float above the content, shrinking as you scroll down and reappearing when you scroll up. Though you can still access the refresh button and website options buttons plus a back button, everything else is hidden under a \u201cMore\u201d button for a cleaner look.\nCarPlay Gets Overhauled\nApple has neglected CarPlay over the past few iOS releases, so it\u2019s a relief to see things changing for the better in iOS 26. Most importantly, the bulk of the changes apply to all users\u2014not just those with fancy new cars that support the new CarPlay Ultra interface (though there are improvements there too).\nFirst, the glassy look is extended to CarPlay elements. This design decision has had some positive knock-on effects like a new smaller compact incoming call notification box that means you can take or reject calls without the whole display being occupied by the incoming call screen.\nMessages in CarPlay get Tapbacks for quick reactions that don\u2019t demand a huge amount of your attention, and your pinned conversations now appear in the Messages app on your car\u2019s display just like they do on your iPhone (a long overdue feature).\nCarPlay also gets widgets, and Apple says that these are the same widgets that are designed for use with the iPhone. On top of this, Apple is bringing Live Activities into your car to surface relevant information. Apple gave the example of a flight tracker, but it could extend to things like sports games or food deliveries.\nAll of these improvements are coming to the high-end CarPlay Ultra, which includes enhanced customization to layout and design in iOS 26.\nPhone App Gets Call Screening and Hold Assist\nA new Call Screening feature allows the iPhone to answer calls for you, learn who is calling and why, and then ring you while displaying a message explaining what the call is about, just like Live Voicemail does in iOS 18. The feature automatically kicks in for unknown callers and is designed to cut down on spam.\nAlong the same lines is a feature called Hold Assist, which silences hold music and lets you put your phone down for as long as you\u2019re on hold. You\u2019ll get a ring when the operator is ready to take your call. Apple even says you can put your phone away while this is happening.\nThe app also has a new unified view that was introduced as something you \u201ccan choose\u201d by Darin Adler, Apple\u2019s VP of Internet Technologies (perhaps Apple is learning from the Photos mistake). It includes floating tabs for Calls, Contacts, and Keypad and puts your favorite contacts at the top followed by a list of your recents (complete with voicemail messages you can play with a tap).\nChanges to Messages\nLike Call Screening, Messages gets its own spam-prevention feature in the form of the ability to screen unknown senders. Rather than cluttering up your conversation list, these messages will now appear in their own folder that\u2019s accessible from a button in the top-right corner of the screen.\nApple says that time-sensitive messages, like table reservations and two-factor authentication codes, will still be delivered as normal. Everything else will be hidden from view, and won\u2019t appear as a notification either.\niMessage conversations finally get customizable backgrounds, with Apple including its own dynamic options and also allowing you to choose your own or generate them yourself. These push to everyone in the conversation.\nApple is also adding polls to iMessage group conversations to settle multiple-choice questions, with anyone being able to add options. Apple Intelligence will even detect when a poll might be useful and suggest creating one.\nTwo small group chat enhancements include typing indicators and the ability to share Apple Cash with multiple people.\nVisual Intelligence Is Finally Ready\nWhile Visual Intelligence launched with the arrival of iOS 18.2, it only applied to things you point your camera at. In iOS 26, Apple is extending the feature to anything on your screen, which works a lot like Google\u2019s Circle to Search feature on Android.\nThe feature uses the same combination of buttons that are used for screenshots (the Side button and volume up or down). You can then access it by tapping the new \u201cImage Search\u201d option in the bottom-right, or use your finger to highlight objects first to narrow down your search.\nYou\u2019ll also get in-line context-appropriate suggestions, like an \u201cAdd to Calendar\u201d button that appears beneath the screenshot when an event is detected in the frame. In the lower-right corner is a new \u201cAsk\u201d button for asking ChatGPT questions about what\u2019s on-screen. All of this works with other apps, like Etsy or Pinterest, allowing you to narrow down your results.\nAnd yes, the familiar screenshot tools are still right there at the top of the screen (phew).\nA New Live Translation Feature\nAnother Apple Intelligence feature, Live Translation brings on-device translation features to Messages, Phone, and FaceTime. This works offline but requires an iPhone 15 Pro or later (it also works on the Apple Watch, when paired with a phone that supports Apple Intelligence).\nIn Messages, the feature can automatically translate to a language of your choosing as you type, with incoming messages translated back to your own tongue. FaceTime video calls show a live translation in text above what is being spoken, so you can hear the other person.\nRegular phone calls go a step further and your iPhone speaks for you, translating your spoken words aloud (and back again). Since this takes place on your device, there\u2019s no need for the other party to have an iPhone for this to work. There\u2019s even a Live Translation API for developers to add the feature to their own calling apps.\nAs expected, the feature is limited in scope at launch. It\u2019s currently restricted to Chinese (Simplified), English (UK, U.S.), French (France), German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil), and Spanish (Spain). Expect Apple to slowly roll out more languages, over time, usually in smaller iOS updates as has happened in the past.\nApple Fixed the Photos App (Kinda)\nIn Apple\u2019s iOS 26 WWDC presentation, Craig Federighi remarked that \u201cmany of you missed using tabs in the Photos app,\u201d which might be the understatement of the year. Thankfully, Apple is putting tabs back into the camera app for Library and Collections. While Library is a view of everything, Collections lets you quickly jump to your favorites, albums, and search.\nSimplified Camera View\nThe Camera app has been slightly updated to feature a bigger viewfinder with greater emphasis on the basic Photo and Video modes (which are the only two mode buttons that appear on-screen all of the time). You can swipe left and right to reveal the other modes, like Slo-Mo and Portrait, or swipe up to access all of your other camera settings.\nA New Games App\nNew for iOS 26 is a dedicated Games app, which sounds a lot like a redesigned Game Center (so let\u2019s hope Apple doesn\u2019t abandon it). The app is designed to make it easier to access and discover games, putting what you\u2019re currently playing on the main screen along with a summary of what\u2019s new. You\u2019ll also get recommendations based on your tastes.\nOn top of this, there are tabs for Apple Arcade and a Library that brings every game installed on your iPhone into one place. Finally, the Play Together tab is designed to make gaming on your iPhone a more social experience allowing quick access to your friends so you can see what everyone is playing, compare scores, and send invites for a new challenge mode.\nApple Music Improvements\nApple Music gets its share of Live Translation features too, with the ability to translate lyrics automatically and subtitles to help you pronounce lyrics properly (the example Apple gave was the romanized pronunciation of Korean K-Pop lyrics).\nAlso new is Automix, a DJ feature that uses time-stretching and beat-matching to move from one song to the next. We\u2019ll have to see how far this can be pushed, but it\u2019s a neat idea. Lastly, the Music app now features more customization, with the ability to pin your favorite playlists, artists, and albums to the top of the Library tab.\nEven More Changes\nSmaller changes that are also worth noting include improvements to the FaceTime app with new floating UI elements that automatically hide, plus a new landing page to quickly access frequent contacts and video messages (which now auto-play).\nApple has updated Genmoji to let you combine two emojis into one and change things like expressions and hairstyles when using your contacts as source material. On a similar note, Image Playground has added support for ChatGPT-generated images plus new ChatGPT image styles. There\u2019s also a new Image Playground API for developers to integrate into their own apps.\nMaps now saves places you\u2019ve been as Visited Places, so you can check your location history. Apple stressed that this is end-to-end encrypted and you can delete your history at any time. Maps also learns your preferred routes and offers them as suggestions, rather than just figuring out A to B in the most efficient way. You\u2019ll get notifications if things like traffic are affecting your preferred route and likely to make you late.\nWallet is getting support for more car keys, more driving licenses (eventually), and a new Digital ID that doesn\u2019t replace your passport but can be used to verify identity and age, and for U.S. domestic travel. Improved digital boarding passes allow you to quickly access maps for airport navigation, Find My for AirTags, and share flight status.\nLastly, you can use rewards when shopping online with Apple Pay and use points when paying in person. Apple has infused order tracking for Apple Pay purchases with Apple Intelligence, so you can see where packages are, all within the Wallet app.\niOS 26 Release Date\nApple hasn\u2019t yet announced when iOS 26 will be available officially, but the past three releases have landed on September 12, 18, and 16. From this, we can infer that mid-September is a safe bet.\nBefore that, a public beta will be available for anyone to try. iOS 18\u2019s public beta arrived on July 15, 2024. The developer beta is available right now, but it\u2019s often unstable and lacking in many features (last year\u2019s beta notably lacked Apple Intelligence features).\nYou\u2019ll need to enroll with Apple Developer to get access to the developer preview. Once complete, head to Settings > General > Software Update and use the \u201cBeta Updates\u201d option to select \u201ciOS 26 Developer Beta.\u201d\niOS 26 Compatibility\niOS 26 will be compatible with the iPhone 11 and second-generation iPhone SE or later. You\u2019ll need an iPhone 15 Pro or later for Apple Intelligence features. This year\u2019s iOS release says goodbye to the iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max models.\nThe full list of supported devices is:\n- iPhone 16e\n- iPhone 16 and 16 Plus\n- iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max\n- iPhone 15 and 15 Plus\n- iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max\n- iPhone 14 and 14 Plus\n- iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max\n- iPhone 13 and 13 mini\n- iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max\n- iPhone 12 and 12 mini\n- iPhone 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max\n- iPhone 11\n- iPhone 11 Pro and 11 Pro Max\n- iPhone SE (2nd generation and later)\nThis is most of the major iOS 26 features, but there are many more changes under the hood. Not all of these features will be ready at launch, and some may be pushed back for future revisions."

      "url": "https://www.howtogeek.com/309838/what-is-a-telephoto-lens/",
      "text": "Quick Links\nTelephoto lenses can be incredibly useful, but how is it different from other lenses, and when should you use it?\nWhat Is a Telephoto Lens?\nA telephoto lens is a lens that appears to magnify distant objects. To do that, they need to have a focal length longer than that of a normal lens, or a lens that approximates the optical qualities of the human eye. A normal lens has a focal length of between 40mm and 58mm on a full frame camera so any lens with a focal length longer than 60mm can be considered a telephoto lens. The longer the focal length, the more magnification there is.\nThe most common telephoto zoom lenses have a focal range of 70mm to 200mm. Any lens with a focal length longer than about 300mm can be considered a super telephoto lens as well.\nOn a crop sensor camera, telephoto lenses are those with a focal length longer than about 40mm, although the magnification will be minimal until about 50mm.\nLet\u2019s look at this in action. This photo was taken at 50mm, a normal focal length, on a full frame camera. The photo appears pretty similar to how things look with your eyes. The other photos were all taken from the same spot with a crop sensor camera; I don\u2019t have a long enough full frame telephoto to really make the point clear.\nThis photo was taken at 45mm using a crop sensor camera. The full frame equivalent focal length is 72mm. You can see how the image is a little tighter on the car.\nThis photo was taken at 85mm, equivalent to 136mm on a full frame camera. Now the car totally fills the frame.\nThis photo was taken at 135, equivalent to 216mm on a full frame camera. We\u2019re incredibly close to the car compared to the normal photo. It\u2019s impossible to fit the whole thing in the picture.\nHow a Telephoto Lens Affects Your Images\nThe main effect of telephoto lenses is that, like a telescope, they magnify distant objects. Distant football players, small birds sitting in trees, and other similar subjects are all much easier to capture with a telephoto lens.\nThe flipside of this is that they have a very narrow field of view. To use a telephoto effectively, you need to stand well back from your subject. With a 70mm telephoto lens, you have to stand around 15 feet back from a human subject to fit them in the frame. With longer telephoto lenses, how far away you need to be from your subject to get everything in frame grows quickly.\nIt\u2019s very easy to get a shallow depth of field with a telephoto lens; it\u2019s one of the reasons they are so popular with portrait photographers. It also means that it\u2019s very hard to get photos with a large depth of field. Even at apertures like f/11 or f/16, you still will struggle to get everything in the frame in focus.\nTelephoto lenses appear to compress everything in the image. Objects that are distant in real life will appear closer together in the image. This is neither a positive nor a negative, just an effect you need to be aware of.\nThe Pros and Cons of Telephoto Lenses\nTelephoto lenses are great for getting close to your subject without having to be physically close. You can\u2019t walk into the middle of a football game or wander right up to a shy bird to take a photo so instead, with a telephoto, you can sit back snap from a distance.\nTelephoto lenses take great portraits. The 70mm-105mm range is very very popular for them. Personally, I use an 85mm lens for most of mine.\nWhile telephotos do everything they\u2019re meant to do wonderfully, they do have a few downsides. They tend to be big and heavy. It\u2019s just a side-effect of having a long focal length. This makes them awkward and unwieldy, even at the best of times.\nYou also have to be far away from your subjects to use a telephoto lens. When you\u2019re outside, this is normally okay, but in any confined area, you might not be able to get enough distance to get your subject in frame.\nTelephoto lenses also require faster shutter speeds to get sharp exposures. Even with a tripod, if you use a telephoto lens with a shutter speed lower than about 1/200th of a second you risk having camera shake in your images. This means they need a lot more light to get good photos; using a long telephoto lens at night is almost impossible.\nWhat Telephoto Lenses are Available?\nThe majority of affordable telephoto lenses are zoom lenses, although you can get a few single focal length prime lenses if you want a specific portrait lens. Here are some of the best starting options for different cameras.\nCanon\n- Full Frame: Canon EF 70-200mm f/4.0 L USM Lens.\n- Crop Sensor: Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM Lens.\nNikon\n- Full Frame: Nikon 70-200mm f/4.0G ED VR AF-S Lens.\n- Crop Sensor: Nikon AF-S DX NIKKOR 55-300mm f/4.5-5.6G VR Lens.\nA telephoto lens is one of the first purchases most photographers should make once they\u2019ve master the kit lens. They\u2019re necessary for a lot of popular fields of photography, like sports and wildlife."

      "url": "https://www.howtogeek.com/what-makes-rabbit-r1-different-from-other-ai-assistants/",
      "text": "Summary\n- The Rabbit R1 is a handheld device that offers a new way to interact with AI beyond smartphones and computers.\n- It uses a Large Action Model (LAM) to understand complex requests and perform tasks across different web apps and websites.\n- The device can learn from you through its \"teach mode,\" and learn any phrase or command to perform tasks.\nThe Rabbit R1 unveiled at CES 2024 seems to have gotten the tech world talking. What exactly is it, and how is it different from other AI products?\nRabbit R1 Hardware Specs\nThe R1 is the brainchild of Jesse Lyu, who dreamed up \"the simplest computer, something that is so intuitive that you don't need to learn how to use it.\" It is a handheld gadget that offers a new way of interacting with AI beyond smartphones and computers.\nHardware-wise, it sports a 2.88-inch TFT touchscreen display, a push-to-talk button, a far-field mic, and a 360\u00b0 rotational camera. Under the hood, the device is powered by a MediaTek MT6765 Octa-core (Helio P35) processor with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. It's got all the usual sensors you'd find on a modern device\u2014accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GPS\u2014plus Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi at 2.4GHz + 5GHz, and 4G LTE for connectivity.\nThe R1 comes in bright orange and features 2W speaker output, a dual microphone array, an old-school analog scroll wheel, and a SIM card slot (unlocked). Furthermore, it supports a photo resolution of 8MP, 3264x2448, and a video resolution of 24fps, 1080p. It is powered by a 1000mAH rechargeable lithium battery, which you can charge with a USB-C cable. However, no accessories are included with the purchase.\nRabbit R1 Uses a Large Action Model (LAM) to Perform Tasks for You\nThe R1 runs a dedicated operating system called Rabbit OS powered by a Large Action Model (LAM). The LAM helps the device understand complex requests and take action across different web apps and websites. If you asked Google Assistant or Siri to book flights or order you a coffee, the best they could do is say, \"Yeah, sure, here are some websites where you can book flights or order a coffee\u2026\" without actually carrying out the task.\nHowever, with the R1, for example, you can say something like, \"Rabbit, please order more dishwasher detergent from my usual brand on Amazon.\" It will access your Amazon account and place the order, assuming you frequently order from a particular brand. You don't need to open Amazon's website or click through multiple things. This also applies to music streaming, ride-sharing, banking, social media, and more. You can say, \"Play Today's Hits playlist on Spotify,\" or \"Call me an Uber for six people to the airport,\" and Rabbit R1 will interface with those services to fulfill your request.\nUnlike smartphones or computers, the Rabbit R1 doesn't have specific apps installed on it. Instead, it interacts with the web apps and services you authenticate through its web portal called the Rabbit Hole.\nRabbit R1 Can Learn from You\nThe cool thing about Rabbit R1 is that it's not just an AI assistant that follows commands\u2014the \"bunny\" can actually learn new things and preferences from you when you trigger its \"teach mode.\" When teach mode is on, Rabbit R1 will record your screen as you show it how to do stuff in web apps and websites.\nFor example, you could walk Rabbit through ordering a custom pizza on your favorite delivery app. You could show it to do stuff like, \"First open the app or website...tap on create a new order...next choose the crust...\" You get the idea. Rabbit R1 will observe and memorize your actions, so it can do the same later when you ask for \"my special pizza order.\"\nAdditionally, you can teach Rabbit R1 any phrase or command using your own voice and language. Maybe you want it to pull up the batting stats of your favorite baseball team when you say, \"How's my swing looking?\" You can teach it that command, and Rabbit will add it to its repertoire.\nThe Rabbit R1 Won't Replace Your Smartphone\nBefore you get too excited, let's get one thing straight: the Rabbit R1 will not replace your smartphone. At least, not anytime soon.\nThe R1 has a limited hardware capacity that can't compete with your smartphone's processing power, storage, battery life, and camera quality. For example, the R1 might not be your cup of tea if you're a gamer. Its small screen, limited graphics, and lack of dedicated gaming controls make it less than ideal for gaming. Sure, you might be able to play simple games like trivia, word, or puzzle games that work with its voice and touch interface. But for those high-performance, graphics-heavy, control-intensive mobile games? Probably not the best choice. And if you're into watching videos, the Rabbit R1 might leave you feeling a bit frustrated. Its screen resolution isn't as high as modern smartphones, its speaker isn't the strongest, and it doesn't have a headphone jack.\nThe R1's main selling point is that it can help you reduce your screen time and improve your focus and productivity. The creators claim that using a voice-only device can avoid the distractions and negative effects of staring at a screen all day. They also claim that by using a voice-only device, you can communicate more naturally and efficiently with your AI assistant and get things done faster and easier. However, these claims have yet to be tested in the real world.\nThe Rabbit R1 might actually be more distracting and frustrating than your smartphone because it mostly forces you to use voice as your input method, which may not always be the best or most convenient option. Voice is a relatively slow and noisy input method that requires you to speak clearly and loudly and sometimes repeat yourself. Output-wise, it requires you to listen carefully and attentively and to ask for clarification or confirmation. Using voice can also be a socially awkward and inappropriate input and output method. Especially when you have to talk to a device in public or in front of others and expose your personal information and preferences to others.\nIn contrast, your smartphone gives you the choice and flexibility to use voice or other input and output methods, depending on your context and preference. You can use your voice when it's convenient and comfortable, such as when driving or cooking or when you want to have a casual conversation with your AI assistant. In addition, you can use other input and output methods, such as touch, text, or gestures, when they're more efficient and effective, such as when you're reading or writing or when you want to have a precise or private interaction with your AI assistant. Besides, you can manage your screen time and avoid distractions, such as turning on do not disturb mode, setting app limits, or using dark mode on your smartphone.\nMaybe R1 might get sophisticated enough down the road to replace your traditional device. But for now, your iPhone or Android is probably safe.\nRabbit R1 Release Date and Price\nAccording to the official website, the Rabbit R1 has a $199 price tag, excluding extra fees like taxes, shipping, and import duties for orders outside the US and Canada. As for how many you can pre-order, you can only purchase up to 5 units per order as of the time of writing.\nIf you are pre-ordering from the US and Canada, here's a rough timeline of when you should expect to receive your new gadget:\n- The first batch should ship out around March or April 2024.\n- The second batch should follow in April\u2013May 2024.\n- Batch number three is expected to be in May\u2013June 2024.\n- Then, batches four, five, and six are slated to ship in June\u2013July 2024.\nFor international pre-orders beyond the US and Canada, the expected shipping date is, unfortunately, less clear at this point. The company thinks units will start heading to other countries later in 2024, but it doesn't have specifics to share yet.\nThese shipping estimates are subject to change based on manufacturing capacity and component availability.\nThe Rabbit R1 is teeming with potential. It could potentially herald the end of the era of smartphones and computers. But does the Rabbit R1 truly live up to all the excitement surrounding it? That's a judgment only you and the test of time can make."

      "text": "I love my iPhone, but I\u2019ve come to find that upgrading annually is something I can avoid while still getting a stellar experience. Instead of purchasing a new device with each release, the true sweet spot is waiting two years to upgrade.\nBuying a new iPhone is fun, but setting up a rhythm wherein you upgrade every other year can offer several advantages in the long run, like a more rewarding hardware experience and the ability to save money.\nHardware Isn't Changing Drastically\nPurchasing a brand-new iPhone can be wonderful: peeling back the cellophane on that all-white box and pulling a fresh device from it can make you feel like a child on their birthday. Virtually any iPhone you purchase is going to be a high-quality product, but these days there isn\u2019t always a major reason to go through this process every year other than having that unboxing experience.\nSmartphone technology is always improving, but not at the rate it once was. Screens get slightly larger and brighter, cameras get a bit more powerful, and the processor inside an iPhone gets faster with each generation. Although hardware upgrades like these are introduced with each release, they're not always as noticeable as you might hope. This isn\u2019t something unique to the iPhone; other smartphones also suffer.\nSince the release of the iPhone 14 Pro series and its Dynamic Island, it appears Apple is attempting to do something to ensure that each new generation stands out beyond incremental internal hardware upgrades. The iPhone 15 switched to USB-C and the Pro series adopted the Action Button. For iPhone 16, it received the Camera Button. It seems like the big thing for the next generation will be the thin iPhone 17 Air.\nWhile these upgrades offer benefits and help make the product unique, they may not be enough for someone who makes an annual upgrade. For example, the new Camera button is great, but having the Action Button on the iPhone 15 Pro seems just as convenient. You also have to consider that certain features can be paywalled behind a Pro-series upgrade.\nWaiting to upgrade also means potentially receiving a higher-quality product, comparatively. When I made the jump from an iPhone 12 Pro to the iPhone 15 Pro, it was incredible. A brand-new lithium-ion battery, a massive upgrade from a 12MP main camera to a 48MP main camera, and other perks like the move to USB-C and the versatile Action Button.\nSoftware Keeps You Current\nOne perk of waiting to upgrade your device is that you\u2019ll still receive access to software updates. While we could spend all day arguing about whether Apple intentionally kills older products, forcing consumers to upgrade, the fact is that an iPhone generally receives software updates for a good five to six years before it becomes obsolete.\nWhile this isn\u2019t ideal for someone who wants to buy a single smartphone and be done with it, anyone who aims to upgrade annually should realize there\u2019s a lot of life left in their current device.\nJust be aware that not every iOS update is going to create a spellbinding experience. While this certainly isn\u2019t the case for iOS 26\u2014which features a complete UI overhaul thanks to Liquid Glass\u2014there are times when a new software release can be underwhelming as well.\nSaving Money, Helping the Environment\nNaturally, we have to talk about money if we\u2019re talking about the iPhone. For the past several releases, Apple has been fairly consistent in keeping a base-model device with no upgrades at around $800, give or take. That's good, but the money you use for a new iPhone every single year holds the potential for something else in your life.\nMaybe you found a really great deal on the M4 MacBook Air, or perhaps it\u2019s finally time to install that security camera on your front door. Maybe you decided to buy a Nintendo Switch 2 for the fun of it. These days, waiting a year or two to upgrade an iPhone can be extremely helpful financially.\nTurning your smartphone upgrade into a biennial event or longer can also be good for the environment. Sure, Apple is going to produce the same number of devices regardless of whether you heed my advice, but you\u2019re still doing your part in a very small way. Plus, you don\u2019t have to worry about properly recycling your old phone. Doing something small to help reduce e-waste can go a long way.\nDon't Waste Your Money, There Are Only 4 Real Reasons to Upgrade Your iPhone\nThere's more reasons not to upgrade all the time.\nAvoiding First-Run Issues\nNot to generalize, but if you\u2019re the type that likes to buy a new device every year, it seems like a fair bet that you would also like to purchase it on release day. There\u2019s nothing wrong with this\u2014I do the same thing. There\u2019s certainly a thrill going to the Apple Store; not only are you getting to experience cutting-edge tech in the palm of your hands, you get to see the excitement of others experiencing this as well.\nGetting a day-one device is a lot of fun, but it also exposes you to potential issues. Going with something that\u2019s first out the door from a facility means you\u2019re getting a device that may not have had a pristine production run. It can take some time to fine-tune a production line, and while Apple typically has a great rhythm, it isn\u2019t all peaches and cream.\nFor example, upon initial release, both iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models experienced overheating. While the issue was thankfully resolved via a software update, it\u2019s not always that simple. Longtime iPhone fans may also recall the infamous \"Antennagate\" incident with the iPhone 4, in which Steve Jobs attempted to convince everyone that they were holding their phone incorrectly. It turns out that there was a flaw in the antenna\u2019s design; one class action lawsuit later, the whole ordeal is now a negative mark on Apple\u2019s record.\nWhile release day can be a lot of fun, being an experiment can have a lot of downsides. Even if you don\u2019t heed my advice about skipping a year, waiting for user reviews after release day can be a good way to avoid taking a risk.\nShould You Skip the Next iPhone?\nIf you have the means, and you simply can\u2019t live without that fresh, out-of-the-box experience, don\u2019t let me be the one to stop you. Some people use buying a new phone every year as an opportunity to pass their old device to a friend or family member, and that\u2019s awesome. What I want people to take away from this is that they shouldn\u2019t feel an obligation to make the jump every year, especially when there\u2019s so much nerdy tech in the world to enjoy.\nLike a fine wine or a moldy cheese, a lot of the arguments made here grow stronger the longer you wait. Waiting two or even three years to upgrade may seem like an eternity, but it\u2019s only going to make the experience of a new iPhone even more exciting. There\u2019s also the added benefit that you can get a previous-generation model for much cheaper than if you choose to buy the latest top-of-the-line device.\nUltimately, you\u2019re free to spend your money as you see fit. However, taking a moment to decide if a hardware upgrade is worth the price of admission is something that you should keep in the back of your mind. No matter what, you\u2019re gaining access to a fantastic product, but waiting may make that sweet Apple even sweeter.\niPhone 16e\n- Brand\n- Apple\n- SoC\n- A18\n- Display\n- 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED, HDR10, 1,200 nits of peak brightness, 60Hz\n- RAM\n- 8GB\n- Storage\n- 128, 256, 512GB\n- Battery\n- 26 hours of video playback\nThe iPhone16e is an affordable addition to the iPhone 16 line, costing $200 less than the base iPhone 16.\n- Ports\n- USB-C\n- Operating System\n- iOS 18\n- Camera (Rear, Front)\n- 48MP wide, 12MP Selfie\n- Colors\n- Black, White\n- Weight\n- 167g\n- IP Rating\n- IP68"

      "text": "The iPhone 17 and a higher-end Pro model are expected to arrive some time in September 2025, with some big changes rumored for this year\u2019s lineup. As always, you should take these rumors with a pinch of salt until Apple\u2019s big event.\nA New Slim iPhone Model\nNext year\u2019s iPhone lineup could feature a brand new slim model dubbed the iPhone 17 Air, according to analysts Jeff Pu (via MacRumors) and Ming-Chi Kuo.\nKuo suggests that the new model will feature a 6.6-inch display and use titanium in its frame. The rumor claims that the \u201cAir\u201d will feature a single wide-angle camera and no \u201cPro\u201d chip. This suggests it\u2019s not designed to compete with the iPhone 17 Pro as some sort of \u201cUltra\u201d iPhone.\nInstead, the \u201cAir\u201d looks set to be a lifestyle device that puts form over function, with The Information suggesting that the device could be priced even higher than the iPhone 17 Pro Max despite its pared-back hardware.\nThis could suggest that Apple is hoping to appeal to a new market segment that\u2019s happy to shell out for a pricey iPhone in a new form factor that prioritizes aesthetics over raw performance.\nX (formerly Twitter) account Apple Hub mocked up an image of what a slimmer model could look like (above).\nNo More Plus Model\nDespite rumors of a new iPhone model launching in 2025, the lineup could still be limited to just four devices if Ming-Chi Kuo\u2019s report is to be believed. The analyst predicts that there will be no iPhone 17 Plus, owning to the fact that the bumper-sized base models only account for 5-10% of sales.\nThese numbers are backed up by a Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) report that suggested that the iPhone 15 Plus made up for only 9% of sales in the first quarter of 2024 (as reported by MacRumors).\nIf you like a larger iPhone but aren\u2019t prepared to shell out for the high-end iPhone Pro Max, the iPhone 16 Plus might be your last chance to grab a large iPhone at a reasonable price. We\u2019ve seen this before when Apple ceased production of smaller iPhones after the iPhone 13 mini.\nWith the iPhone 13 slowly beginning to show its age, this has left many iPhone 13 mini owners wondering what their upgrade path looks like.\n120Hz Always-On Displays on All Models\nAccording to a post on X (formerly Twitter) by the CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants, Ross Young, 2025 is the year that we\u2019ll finally see 120Hz always-on displays in the base model iPhone 17. The change is long overdue, with many iPhone rivals (like Google\u2019s rival Pixel 9) having 120Hz refresh rates already.\nSamsung even equips its iPhone 16-comparable Galaxy S24 with an always-on display that matches that of Apple\u2019s more expensive Pro model.\nThe same source previously suggests that the iPhone 17 Pro would feature under-display Face ID sensors (with a hole-punch style cutout for the front-facing camera), but this has since been retracted.\nTougher Anti-Reflective Displays\nAll iPhone 16 models saw an upgrade to the Ceramic Shield, Apple\u2019s proprietary tough display glass which the company claims is \u201ctougher than any smartphone glass.\u201d\nMacRumors reports that Weibo leaker Instant Digital predicts even tougher display glass will be used in future models, which is great news for durability. The same rumor suggests that the glass will be more resistant to reflections, which would make it easier to use in bright direct lighting.\nA 24MP Selfie Camera\nAnalyst Ming-Chi Kuo also reports that the iPhone 17 will feature an upgraded 24MP front-facing camera, up from 12MP on the 2024 model. The report states that this \u201cwill significantly improve the image quality\u201d which is great news if you love shooting selfies and vertical video.\nSince the iPhone 17 was specifically mentioned, we can infer that the iPhone 17 Pro would get the same upgrade since it\u2019s unlikely that the more expensive model would be stuck with an inferior camera. This improvement is also likely to be included in a new slim model, should it materialize.\nFaster Chips, More RAM\nPerhaps the most predictable upgrade is a small bump in overall power thanks to a new processor. MacRumors reports that a \u201creputable\u201d source of information (Weibo user iPhone Chip Expert) claims the new chips won\u2019t use a more efficient 2-nanometer process since these chips won\u2019t be mass-produced until the end of 2025.\nEither way, we can probably pencil in an A19 and A19 Pro processor, particularly with Apple\u2019s renewed focus on in-device machine learning with the introduction of Apple Intelligence.\nA similar rumor from analyst Jeff Pu (also reported by MacRumors) suggests that we\u2019ll see 12GB of RAM in the iPhone 17 Pro. All models of iPhone 16 have 8GB of RAM (up from 6GB on the iPhone 15), and the iPhone 17 and the rumored slim model is expected to follow suit.\nApple-Designed Wi-Fi and 5G Chips\nMacRumors reported as far back as December 2023 that (according to analyst Jeff Pu), the iPhone 17 Pro would feature an Apple-designed Wi-Fi chip.\nDigiTimes also issued a report around the same time, saying it was unlikely that the chip would make it into the base iPhone 17.\nA newer DigiTimes report from September 2024 suggests that 2025\u2019s iPad lineup will also see the in-house Wi-Fi chip, which lends support to the idea that the iPhone 17 (or at least the Pro models) could see the same tech.\nThis same report also suggests that we\u2019ll see Apple\u2019s in-house 5G chip appear in 2025 iPhone models, starting with the long-awaited iPhone SE refresh. This could mean that even the base model iPhone 17 would see the 5G chip.\nApple is likely doing this to reduce its reliance on third-party chip manufacturers and streamline manufacturing processes. That said, the prospect of a new Apple-designed router is tantalizing and would surely sell like hotcakes.\nA 48MP Telephoto Lens (iPhone 17 Pro)\nAnalyst Jeff Pu also suggested that the iPhone 17 Pro Max would see a new 48MP telephoto lens. This would bring the telephoto in line with the wide and ultra-wide cameras, and vastly improve image quality and versatility in terms of digital zoom.\nIt would be great to see this come to the iPhone 17 Pro too, given that Apple has closed the gap on this year\u2019s Pro models by finally bringing the 5X telephoto to both.\nThough it can be tempting to use these rumors to help you decide whether or not to upgrade this year, don\u2019t lose sight of the fact that rumors are just unconfirmed reports. We might see some of these features (or products) slip entirely, just like we could be surprised with some as-yet-unknown welcome additions."

      "text": "Quick Links\nWith the arrival of the Galaxy S25 Edge already official, Apple fans are now eyeing the rumored iPhone 17 Air. While some speculation has me excited, like the presence of a ProMotion OLED screen and an A19 chip on the slimmest iPhone, I'm a bit concerned about its camera and battery performance.\nUltra-Slim Titanium Chassis With Camera Control Button\nThe iPhone 17 Air is said to be Apple's thinnest iPhone ever. Currently, that title rests with the iPhone 6 (with a 6.9mm thin chassis). However, the iPhone Air will be even slimmer, measuring 5.5mm at its thinnest, excluding the camera bump (via Ming-Chi Kuo).\nChinese tipster Ice Universe claims that the iPhone 17 Air will feature a 4.0mm camera bump, implying that it could measure 9.5mm at the thickest point.\nSpeaking of the camera, it is expected to reside in a pill-shaped horizontal housing at the top of the back panel (similar to what we've seen on the recent Google Pixel smartphones), as claimed by tipster Majin Bu. A report by MacRumors states that all models in the iPhone 17 lineup will use an aluminum frame, except for the iPhone 17 Air, which may feature a titanium frame.\nAt first, this may sound counterintuitive, but aluminum's lower carbon footprint could help Apple achieve its goal of carbon neutrality by 2030. Meanwhile, carving a titanium frame for the iPhone Air could enhance its rigidity and in-hand feel (and bring parity with the Galaxy S25 Edge).\nBloomberg's Mark Gurman claims that the super-thin iPhone will feature the Camera Control button (as seen on the latest iPhone 16 lineup) and a USB-C port at the bottom (toward the back panel instead of the center).\nThe handset is also said to feature the programmable Action Button, as seen in the pictures of the iPhone 17 dummies shared by Australian leaker Sonny Dickson. Last but not least, the Naver (Korean blog) user \"yeux1122\" claims that the iPhone 17 Air will weigh about 145 grams.\niPhone 17 Air Could Get a 6.6-Inch OLED ProMotion Screen\nFirst, the super-thin iPhone is said to have a 6.55-inch screen (which could be marketed as a 6.6-inch screen), according to a report by 9to5Mac that cites Display Supply Chain Consultants analyst Ross Young. Kuo also corroborates the 6.6-inch screen size, which could make it bigger than the display on the standard and the Pro iPhones in the lineup.\nWhat's interesting is that the handset is rumored to use Samsung's M14 OLED panel, the one that powers the ProMotion display (LTPO panel with variable refresh rate) on the iPhone 16 Pro models.\nThere has been some chatter about the non-Pro iPhones getting a 120Hz fixed refresh rate LTPS screen, according to a Chinese tipster.\nI believe that including a ProMotion screen on the iPhone Air would make much more sense, as it would help preserve battery life by switching to 1Hz when viewing static content or in always-on mode, as opposed to a panel locked at 120Hz.\nThe sleekest iPhone should also retain the Dynamic Island from the recent iPhones, but sources seem to be divided on its width. While analyst Jeff Pu believes that Apple could utilize metalens technology for the Face ID system on all iPhone 17 models (via 9to5Mac) to reduce the thickness of the Dynamic Island, Kuo doesn't expect the pill-shaped cutout to change at all.\nApple's Ultra-Thin iPhone Could Get the A19 Chip\nBack in the day, Apple used to power its regular and Pro iPhones with the same chip. Take the iPhone 12 and the iPhone 12 Pro as examples: both feature the A14 chip. However, beginning with the iPhone 14 series, the company started equipping the Pro iPhones with more powerful chips, giving buyers a clear incentive to upgrade.\nLast year, the Cupertino giant released two new chips based on TSMC's N3E (3nm) fabrication technology: A18 (for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus) and A18 Pro (for the iPhone 16 Pro models). If Apple sticks to its plan, we should see two new processors later this year: the A19 and the A19 Pro.\nContrary to this, a MacRumors report citing a research note shared by Jeff Pu suggests that the standard iPhone 17 may borrow the A18 chip from the iPhone 16, while the iPhone 17 Air may debut with a new A19 chip.\nAlthough we don't know the extent of CPU or GPU upgrades the A19 chip might offer, it is said to be based on TSMC's third-generation 3nm fabrication process called N3P (which should unlock higher clock speeds and improve efficiency).\nIf I were to speculate, the standard A19 chip should provide a modest performance improvement over the A18 Pro chip on the iPhone 16 Pro (somewhere around 10 to 15% better scores in synthetic benchmarks).\nBesides the processor, memory could be another difference between the regular and Air iPhones. Per Kuo, at least three variants in the iPhone 17 lineup may feature 12GB of RAM (mostly to accommodate all the Apple Intelligence features), including the ultra-thin iPhone and the two Pro models.\n6 Things Apple Must Add to the iPhone 17 or I'm Not Upgrading\nGetting me to upgrade this year is going to require some changes.\nFrom what it looks like, Apple could use the performance advantage to sell more iPhone 17 Air units.\nIn-House C1 Modem and Custom Wi-Fi Chip\nIn February 2025, Gurman (in December 2024) and Kuo (in July 2024) collectively stated that Apple's slimmest iPhone would use the in-house C1 modem, the one that debuted with the iPhone 16e.\nAccording to Apple, the C1 subsystem is the power-efficient cellular chip in an iPhone, which could help the iPhone 17 Air conserve battery while browsing via mobile data or making a voice call. However, the modem only supports sub-6 GHz 5G connectivity.\nIn February 2025, Kuo also claimed that all iPhones in the iPhone 17 lineup will utilize Apple's custom Wi-Fi chip, which may support Wi-Fi 7, as part of the company's plans to transition from the Broadcom Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chips currently used in iPhones.\nDeveloping a Wi-Fi chip will give the company more control over its cost, configuration, and optimization. Another connectivity-related change coming to the ultra-thin iPhone is the removal of the physical SIM card slot, i.e., the slimmest iPhone might be eSIM only.\nAll iPhone 17 Models Get iOS 26 and the Liquid Glass Design\nThanks to the Worldwide Developers Conference 2025, we already know about the operating system that will power the iPhone 17 lineup: iOS 26.\nYes, Apple has skipped five version numbers in favor of iOS 26, as it is standardizing the naming convention by moving to years (and aligning the version with its calendar year). Besides the name, it is the Liquid Glass design language that's the center of attraction.\nThe Liquid Glass design largely consists of translucent user interface layers that each behaves as if they were made of glass. The layers, when stacked on top of one another, also exhibit the properties of reflection and refraction as if they were made of real-world glass.\nAll The iOS 26 iPhone Features You're Not Getting This Fall\nApple didn't discuss them, but we found 'em all!\nWith iOS 26, Apple has added elements across the board, such as floating on-screen elements like menus, a glassy lock screen clock (with dynamic sizing), Call Screening and Hold Assist in the native Phone app, Live Translation in the Messages app, an overhauled CarPlay with the Liquid Glass design, so on and so forth.\nDon't Expect Dual Cameras (Or Speakers) on the iPhone 17 Air\nMultiple sources, including an Instagram reel by WEIS Studio, a YouTube video from the popular channel Front Page Tech, and a CAD render shared by leaker Majin Bu, all point toward a horizontal camera bump on the iPhone 17 Air, housing a single camera lens.\nAs seen in videos and renders, the camera bar features the lens on the left, while the microphone and LED flash module are positioned on the right. In October 2024, Jeff Pu (via a MacRumors report) claimed that the slim iPhone 17 would feature a single 48MP rear-facing camera, and that has been the collective opinion ever since.\nYou'd get lossless in-sensor crop (2x) and fantastic video stabilization, but you won't be able to zoom out in case you need to capture a group picture. So, if you're someone who captures a lot of ultrawide pictures, the thinnest iPhone could be disappointing for you.\nMost recently, I commended Samsung for equipping its super-thin flagship, the Galaxy S25 Edge, with a dual-rear-facing camera setup (200MP + 12MP), and, unfortunately, the iPhone 17 Air's camera may lack this versatility.\nHowever, you should still get all the other features, including Photographic Styles, portraits with focus and depth control, Cinematic Video, Dolby Vision recording, and many more. On the front, the thinnest iPhone 17 may feature a 24MP camera, up from the 12MP sensor found on the iPhone 16 lineup.\nAccording to a report by The Information, the iPhone 17 Air will feature a single speaker in the earpiece; you might not get a dual-speaker setup after all. This will most certainly result in a reduction of the loudness and fullness of sound from the speaker.\niPhone 17 Air's Battery Conundrum\nLast month, The Information reported (citing Apple's internal tests) that only 60 to 70% of iPhone 17 Air customers will be able to use the phone for a day without needing to recharge it. For other iPhones, this number is around 80 to 90%.\nThough I don't remember a day I didn't have to plug in my iPhone 16 before sleeping to finish off the digital chores at the end of the day, the iPhone 17 Air's battery situation could be even more concerning, especially for heavy users like me. To solve the issue, Apple could release battery cases for the slim iPhone (last seen for the iPhone 11 lineup).\nThe leaker \"yeux1122\" says (via a blog post on Naver) that the iPhone 17 Air will feature a 2,800 mAh battery. However, Apple is also said to use a high-density, silicon-anode battery (according to Ming-Chi Kuo and Bloomberg, respectively), which could increase the effective usage time by 15-20% (when compared to a regular 2,800 mAh battery).\nHow the Ultra-Thin iPhone Air Could Avoid the Galaxy Edge's Biggest Problems\nThe iPhone 17 Air might be a better deal than the Galaxy S25 Edge, provided Apple solves these problems.\nPer Dickson (mentioned earlier in the article), the purported iPhone could also feature the MagSafe charging infrastructure (including the wireless charging coil and the magnetic rings).\nPrice and Availability\nApple might price the slimmest iPhone between the standard and the Pro version, or similar to the current iPhone 16 Plus (whose baseline variant costs $899). The Pro and the Pro Max, on the other hand, could cost $100 more than the current versions.\n-\niPhone 16e\n- Brand\n- Apple\n- SoC\n- A18\nThe iPhone16e is an affordable addition to the iPhone 16 line, costing $200 less than the base iPhone 16.\n-\nApple iPhone 16\n- Brand\n- Apple\n- SoC\n- A18 chip\nApple's newest iPhone featuring a camera button, programmable action button, and artificial intelligence features.\n-\nApple iPhone 16 Pro\n- SoC\n- A18 Pro\n- Display\n- 2,622 x 1,206 resolution (460 ppi)\nA version of Apple's newest iPhone with a larger screen featuring a camera button, a programmable action button, and artificial intelligence features.\nIn terms of design, in-hand feel, display quality, and performance, the iPhone 17 Air looks set to be an exciting development. However, I'm skeptical about how potential customers would feel about its camera and battery life."
