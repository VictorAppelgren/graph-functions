  "description": "Pricey prescriptions and nagging medical costs are swamping some insurers and employers now. Patients may start paying for it next year.",
  "content": "Health insurance will grow more expensive in many corners of the market in 2026, and coverage may shrink. That could leave patients paying more for doctor visits and dealing with prescription coverage changes.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a period of uncertainty in every health insurance market right now, which is something we haven\u2019t seen in a very long time,\u201d said Larry Levitt, an executive vice president at the nonprofit KFF, which studies health care.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\nEnrollment in the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance marketplaces swelled the past few years. But a crackdown on fraud and a tightening of eligibility verifications that were loosened during the COVID-19 pandemic makes it harder for some to stay covered, Jefferies analyst David Windley noted.\n\nNew gene therapies that can come with a one-time cost of more than $2 million also are having an impact, insurance brokers say. Those drugs, which target rare diseases, and some newer cancer treatments are part of the reason Sun Life Financial covered 47 claims last year that cost over $3 million.\n\nThe financial services company covers high-cost claims for employers that pay their own medical bills. Sun Life probably had no claims that expensive a decade ago and maybe \u201ca handful at best\u201d five years ago, said Jen Collier, president of health and risk solutions.\n\nPrice hikes will be most apparent on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual coverage marketplaces. Insurers there are raising premiums around 20% in 2026, according to KFF, which has been analyzing state regulatory filings.",

Rising costs are driven in part by expensive gene therapies and new cancer treatments, with insurers like Sun Life reporting multi-million dollar claims for rare disease drugs. The combination of higher premiums and stricter coverage rules may leave patients paying more for doctor visits and facing reduced prescription coverage.",
