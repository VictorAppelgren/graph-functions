  "description": "The six-time MotoGP world champion is undefeated since June and is rapidly closing in on another riders title.",
  "content": "The six-time MotoGP world champion is undefeated since June and is rapidly closing in on another riders title.\n\nDucati\u2019s Marc Marquez has delivered a masterclass at the Balaton Park Circuit, winning the first Hungarian Grand Prix in 33 years to secure his seventh straight sprint and main race double and stretching his championship lead to a commanding 175 points.\n\nKTM\u2019s Pedro Acosta and Aprilia\u2019s Marco Bezzecchi joined Marquez on the podium on Sunday as reigning champion Jorge Martin came fourth \u2013 his best finish on the Aprilia since his return from injuries.\n\nGresini Racing\u2019s Alex Marquez, second in the championship behind his brother, could manage only 14th place after an early fall on the opening lap.\n\nAgainst the picturesque backdrop of the largest lake in Central Europe, pole-sitter Marc Marquez lost the lead on lap one to drop out of the podium positions, but his tyre strategy proved decisive.\n\nHaving clinched his 13th sprint victory of the season on Saturday, Marquez had another good launch to lead into turn one.\n\nBut Bezzecchi took the lead on the next turn, as Marquez made contact with the Aprilia and lost speed to drop to fourth.\n\n\u201cLuckily for both of us, I was able to save the crash, and he just continued his way. But from that point, the race changed a bit,\u201d Marquez said.\n\nBezzecchi and then-second-placed Franco Morbidelli were on soft rear tyres while Marquez was on the medium compound with the Spaniard easily climbing to second once his tyres were fully warmed up.\n\nAcosta also made a smooth overtake on Morbidelli to move up to third, but he had a gap of nearly two seconds with Marquez, who had virtually erased Bezzecchi\u2019s lead as they continually exchanged overtakes.\n\nMarquez patiently bided his time, staying on Bezzecchi\u2019s rear wheel. The inevitable moment came on lap 11 when he pounced, using the Aprilia\u2019s slipstream to reclaim the lead before streaking away.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw that the soft rear tyres started to drop \u2013 I was with the medium \u2013 I started to attack,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a super nice rhythm. I was flowing on the track.\u201d\n\nFive laps later, Acosta attacked Bezzecchi on the same straight heading into turn one, guiding his KTM past the Aprilia on the inside and carrying that momentum into the next turn to take second.\n\n\u201cI needed the extra grip from the soft [tyre] in braking, so I risked it with the soft. But for us, maybe it was better [to use] the medium,\u201d Bezzecchi said.\n\nAlthough Acosta had Marquez in his sights, the six-time champion found another gear towards the end of the race and extended his lead to more than three seconds to secure the victory.\n\nHowever, the second-year MotoGP rider was happy with second place after destroying his bike in a qualifying crash.\n\n\u201cI just want to thank every one of them because yesterday they were working until 2am in the morning to just bring two completely new bikes for this [race],\u201d Acosta said.\n\nThe Aprilia garage was all smiles when Martin, who started 16th on the grid, set a fastest lap before finishing fourth \u2013 suggesting that injury struggles are now behind him.",

Jose Luis Morales made it 2-0 in first-half injury time by converting a penalty after a video review called a handball by Alejandro Balde when he blocked Morales\u2019s shot.\nBut Pedri started the fightback in the 49th when he received Yamal\u2019s pass well outside the area, picked his spot in the corner of the net and blasted in a shot from long range.\nFerran, who had hit the woodwork in the first half, levelled in the 52nd when he fended off his marker and volleyed in Raphinha\u2019s corner kick.\nBarcelona then pressed for the decider, which Yamal helped find just after the 90 minutes were up.\nBarcelona coach Hansi Flick praised Pedri for his goal, saying that \u201cit changed the match\u201d.\n\u201cThe first goal we scored helped us a lot to get our confidence in the box, but until the end, it was not easy for us to get the three points.\u201d\nBarcelona won its opener at nine-man Mallorca 3-0 last weekend.\nRashford makes first league start\nNewcomer Marcus Rashford made his first league start for Barcelona since his loan move from Manchester United as a left-side forward for Flick.\nThe English international was replaced by Dani Olmo at halftime, after the biggest threats had come from Pedri\u2019s passes in the middle and Yamal\u2019s incursions down the right.\n\u201cI think Marcus [Rashford] had some situations in the first half where he showed how good he is and how he can help us, and that is how we have to continue,\u201d Flick said.\nBarcelona\u2019s Robert Lewandowski played his first minutes of the season as a late substitute after recovering from a muscle injury.\nBarca will visit Rayo Vallecano next week as it continues its title defence. Levante, which has lost both its opening fixtures, will travel to Elche, hoping for a more positive result."

Isak, however, on social media has made clear his desire to make the move to the defending Premier League champions and his dissatisfaction with the Magpies for obstructing it.\nAs a result, he has been training away from the rest of the Newcastle squad as they prepare for a rematch of their 2025 Carabao Cup triumph, which marked the Magpies first major trophy win in 70 years.\nManager Eddie Howe confirmed Isak will not play Monday. But he is hopeful the Swedish striker who scored 23 league goals last season can be reintegrated into the squad, saying there is no personal animosity between them.\nHe also admits the ordeal has put the club in a difficult position.\n\u201cIt is a lose/lose situation to a degree for us because I don\u2019t think we can come out of this winning in any situation,\u201d Howe told reporters Friday. \u201cWe love Alex in the sense of what he\u2019s done for the football club since he\u2019s been here, what he\u2019s contributed, what he\u2019s given, how professional he\u2019s been.\u201d\nWhat was Newcastle\u2019s result in their Premier League opener?\nWithout Isak, the Magpies were forced to settle for a 0-0 draw at Aston Villa to open their campaign despite creating the majority of the chances.\nHow did Liverpool fair in their Premier League opener?\nLiverpool looked excellent at times and vulnerable at others in their season-opening 4-2 home win against Bournemouth, one that came despite giving back a two-goal lead via Antoine Semenyo\u2019s second-half brace.\nSubstitute Federico Chiesa scored the eventual winner in the 88th minute, and Mo Salah added his first of the year in second-half stoppage time. Summer signing Hugo Ekikite scored his first Liverpool goal and added his first assist to help the Reds to a 2-0 lead.\nWhat is Liverpool\u2019s take on the Newcastle trip?\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot is mindful of the hostile atmosphere his side would be likely to face even without the Isak episode.\n\u201cNothing to do with anything that\u2019s in the media a lot, but I think if you go to Newcastle, you know what to expect,\u201d Slot said. \u201cWe\u2019ve played them three times last season, and twice their intensity levels were above ours. In the away game, especially the first 60 minutes, they were so, so, so intense. They were fully deserved [of a point].\u201d\nWhat happened the last time Newcastle met Liverpool?\nNewcastle were 2-1 winners against Liverpool in the Carabao Cup final in March.\nThe teams shared a 3-3 draw at St James\u2019 Park last season, but the Reds did win the league meeting at Anfield 2-0.\nHead-to-head\nThis is the 189th meeting between the clubs, with Liverpool winning on 93 occasions compared to Newcastle\u2019s 50 victories.\nNewcastle have not beaten Liverpool in the league since a 2-0 home win in December 2015.\nThe Reds have won 12 of 17 fixtures between the clubs since then.\nNewcastle team news\nIsak is the big-name omission from the Newcastle match-day squad once again.\nShould Joe Willock return from a calf problem, however, then Newcastle will otherwise have a fully fit squad to choose from.\nJacob Ramsey has signed from Aston Villa and could be in line for a debut for the Magpies.\nLiverpool team news\nOne of Liverpool\u2019s new signings, Jeremie Frimpong, will be out after the international break with a hamstring injury.\nConor Bradley has returned to full training from injury, but Joe Gomez is still be assessed following a knock but may not yet be fully fit to start.\nPredicted Newcastle starting lineup\nPope; Trippier, Schar, Burn, Livramento; Guimaraes, Tonali, Joelinton; Elanga, Gordon, Barnes\nPredicted Liverpool starting lineup\nAlisson; Szoboszlai, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo; Ekitike"
