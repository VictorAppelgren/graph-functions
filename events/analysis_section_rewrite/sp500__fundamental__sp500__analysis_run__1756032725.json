      "feedback": "The draft nails the secular cloud/AI thesis and leverages concrete SHOP/MSFT metrics, but it fails to meet the multi‑year, first‑principles framing required by the SECTION FOCUS: it lacks explicit regime structure, invariant anchors, and a transparent causal chain from megatrend to market pricing, and it leans too heavily on marketing-style summaries rather than a tight, source‑anchored scenario with clear catalysts and invalidation signals. To upgrade: (1) state a concise horizon and invariant anchors (e.g., platform moat economics, network effects, switching costs, and cash‑flow visibility) anchored to first principles; map these to the sources (e.g., SHOP’s GMV/revenue growth and SFN divestiture in QFDWCTAYB, Microsoft cloud momentum and contracted revenue backlog in 0G3A676BP). (2) build a regime‑based scenario structure: Regime A (high‑growth cloud/AI expansion with durable margins, 5–7+ years), Regime B (mature but still expanding platform with slower CAGR and leverage), Regime C (late‑cycle/ macro‑ineri downturn/investor repricing). For each regime, specify the transmission channel and plausible ranges for revenue growth, margins, and FCF, tying to the numbers in the sources (e.g., Shopify GMV growth 27%, revenue up 29% Y/Y to $5B in H1 2025 and 16% FCF margin in Fool’s cloud stock pieces; Azure/Adobe/SNOW/ServiceNow momentum in 0G3A676BP). (3) articulate a crisp causal chain: megatrend → user/merchant network effects and ecosystem moat → scale benefits and operating leverage → cash returns → multiple re‑rating; explicitly show where backlogs, contracted revenue, and cash flow translate to valuation support (cite 0G3A676BP and QFDWCTAYB). (4) add explicit catalysts and invalidation triggers: e.g., Azure cloud growth staying above a threshold (e.g., mid‑to‑high‑20s to 40% range cited in 0G3A676BP), SHOP GMV/revenue trajectory continuing, SFN divestiture impact fading; adverse triggers include a sustained deceleration in GMV growth, a material margin compression, or a slower cloud/AI cycle; (5) quantify with explicit ranges and sensitivity: base case revenue growth and FCF margins for SHOP and MSFT over 3–5 years, plus WACC and perpetuity assumptions with ± basis‑point sensitivity; (6) tighten citations so every factual claim ties to IDs in SOURCE MATERIALS (QFDWCTAYB, 0G3A676BP, 48JXC9VDP, 9X7XOLXMH, 0VMWQTKHB, etc.) and reconcile any conflicts (e.g., differing takes on CF/income drivers between Fool articles vs. Shopify press framing); (7) avoid generic platitudes—quote and reference the actual metrics (GMV, revenue, net income, FCF, FCF margins, backlog) and embed them in the narrative rather than listing them as ancillary points; (8) ensure length/format aligns with a compact, horizon‑focused world‑class report by delivering a short base case, then a brief upside/downside with catalysts, regime transitions, and watchpoints, each anchored to the cited numbers; (9) cross‑check for redundancy across 0G3A676BP and QFDWCTAYB (duplicate coverage) and drop duplicative lines (e.g., repeated boilerplate on “forever stock”) to improve precision; (10) finish with a crisp, explicit base‑case forecast, key risks, watchpoints, and confidence judgment that preserves the multi‑year, structural framing.",
