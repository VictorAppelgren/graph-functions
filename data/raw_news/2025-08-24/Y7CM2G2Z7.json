  "content": "Sydney Sweeney has suffered back-to-back box office flops with two of her latest films, Eden and Americana, following her American Eagle ad scandal.\n\nThe latest film starring the 27-year-old actress \u2014 Ron Howard's $50 million-budget survival thriller Eden \u2014 debuted in 664 theaters this weekend and earned just $1 million, according to Deadline.\n\nThe film's disappointing box office performance may be partly due to its lackluster reviews, as it currently holds a 55% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, despite it's star studded-cast.\n\nSydney had a dramatic make-under for her role as the real-life German settler Margret Wittmer in the movie, which also stars Ana de Armas and Jude Law.\n\nIt comes after her other film, Americana, made only $500,000 its opening weekend against a $9 million budget, the weekend prior.\n\nThe box office failures come on the heels of Sydney's viral ad for American Eagle, which provoked a social media meltdown as frenzied critics compared it to 'Nazi propaganda' for playing on the phrase 'good genes' with a blonde, blue-eyed star.\n\nIn Eden, Sydney's character was four months pregnant when she moved the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago's Southern most island Floreana in 1932 with her husband Heinz (Daniel Br\u00fchl) and stepson Harry (Jonathan Tittel).\n\nSydney has a wild birth scene in the film, where she fends off feral animals just as her water breaks, and Margret eventually welcomes a son and daughter on the remote South American isle.\n\nThe tight-knit community soon discover 'their greatest threat isn't the brutal climate or deadly wildlife, but each other' as Eloise Bosquet de Wagner Wehrhorn (de Armas) and Dr. Friedrich Ritter (Law) begin wielding guns.\n\nThe real Margret Wittmer was buried on Floreana Island in 2000 when she died, at age 95, after expanding the settlement and writing about her experiences in the 1959 book Floreana: A Woman's Pilgrimage to the Gal\u00e1pagos.\n\nThe Echo Valley actress replaced Daisy Edgar-Jones in the role back in 2023 due to her commitment to Twisters amid the SAG-AFTRA strikes.\n\nThe movie, formerly known as Origin of Species, also stars Vanessa Kirby, Felix Kammerer, Toby Wallace, and Richard Roxburgh.\n\nMeanwhile Sydney's Americana director, Tony Tost, said he feels his movie got 'gobbled up by the zeitgeist,' amid its commercial failure.\n\nWhile the movie emerged as a damp squib at the box office, Sydney's co-star Halsey urged viewers to see it in spite of the '24hr gossip tabloid denim bulls***.'\n\nThe crime comedy received a warmer response from the critics, with the New York Times calling it a 'slick and skillful debut feature' and Variety saying Tony's 'first feature arrives more polished than most filmmakers\u2019 third or fourth.'\n\nNow Tony, who made his directorial debut with Americana, has defended the project as 'a \"hidden gem\" type movie' rather than a 'blockbuster.'\n\n'One of the great things about movies is that they outlive the zeitgeist into which they were released,' he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n'As someone whose first film sorta got gobbled up by the zeitgeist, I'll be curious to see how it'll stand up after this moment is over. Hopefully fairly well!'\n\nAmericana premiered at SXSW in March 2023, four months before its production company Bron Studios filed for bankruptcy, and finally achieved a theatrical release on over 1,000 screens more than two years later this August.\n\nAmericana stars Sydney as a waitress with a stammer who aspires to become a country singer, amid a cast that includes I, Tonya breakout Paul Walter Hauser, Grey's Anatomy heartthrob Eric Dane, Red Rocket lead Simon Rex and Halsey.\n\nEarlier on Wednesday, Sydney opened up about the 'disrespectful' messages she gets on social media in an interview with The Sun.\n\nThe star said that her inbox is 'not a safe space' and that she's dealt with 'anxiety' after posting anything on social media due to trolls.\n\n'My DMs are not a safe space. There is no respect in those,' she told the publication.\n\n'It's a tricky one because I understand that I am playing a character, that they feel close to me where I don\u2019t know this person. So, like, they might have a relationship with me that I don\u2019t have with them,' she added.\n\n'And so it\u2019s just something that I have to navigate, and I\u2019m still trying to figure out.'\n\nSydney's controversial American Eagle ad, entitled Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans, shows its star buttoning up a set of denim trousers and offering a playful pun on the word 'genes.'\n\n'Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color...my genes are blue,' Sydney says.\n\nThe campaign was met with an explosion of controversy, as social media users feverishly accused the ad of being racist and flirting with eugenics in light of its star's blonde-haired, azure-eyed appearance.\n\nOther viewers leapt to the busty bombshell's defense, calling the blowback 'unhinged' and saying opponents of the ad were 'reading too much into this.'\n\nAmerican Eagle insiders subsequently shared that about 70% of respondents to independent polling had a positive reaction to the promo, via TMZ.\n\nOn November 25, Sweeney wrapped her role as professional boxer Christy Martin in David Mich\u00f4d's untitled biopic, which she called 'one of the most emotional, transformative experiences of my life.'\n\nThis summer, the Fifty-Fifty Films co-founder will begin producing and starring in her Euphoria castmate Colman Domingo's feature directorial debut Scandalous! about the love affair between Kim Novak and Sammy Davis Jr. (David Jonsson).\n\nSydney is very much in demand with several projects in the works including the Reddit-based thriller I Pretended to Be a Missing Girl for Warner Bros, Jon M. Chu's sci-fi flick Split Fiction for Amazon MGM Studios, and she's producing Michael Bay's video game adaptation OutRun for Universal.\n\nAside from her movie career, Sweeney is every bit the influencer with lucrative paid partnerships for brands like Samsung Mobile USA, Dr. Squatch, LANEIGE US, Bai, and HEYDUDE.",

The film, which premiered in 664 theaters and was largely criticized for its poor reviews, holds a 55% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

Her other film, Americana made only $500,000 its opening weekend against a $9 million budget. Despite this, Sydney's co-star Halsey urged viewers to see it despite its commercial failure. Meanwhile, the director Tony Tost defended Americana as a 'hidden gem' rather than a 'blockbuster' and said he felt his movie got 'gobbled up by the zeitgeist' after its commercial success.",

      "text": "Ron Howard\u2018s star-studded early 20th century island survival thriller, Eden, finally arrived in theaters this weekend after world premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival close to a year ago thanks to Vertical\u2018s theatrical belief in the film, the pic opening to $1M at 664 theaters.\nBefore another rival trade can declare \u201cbomb\u201d on another back-to-back Sydney Sweeney movie this summer, once again, Eden was a niche play like last weekend\u2019s Lionsgate Premiere title Americana with the expectation that the movie\u2019s ancillary revenues remain its ultimate savoir.\nStill, Eden\u2018s path to production, and ultimate theatrical distribution is a case study in the current post pandemic theatrical acquisitions marketplace, one in which there are several star-studded indie movies which remain unsold. While $1M isn\u2019t anything to brag about, it\u2019s a means to an end in understanding how a $55M gross budgeted, but $35M net production big swing was assembled.\nWatch on Deadline\nEden took eight months before it finally found a U.S. distribution deal with Vertical with no minimum guarantee paid. Why, oh, why did it take that long for a smart thriller from 2x Oscar winning filmmaker Howard to find a distributor? Alas, the movie also carries an awards patina in Oscar nominees Vanessa Kirby, Ana de Armas, Jude Law, 2x Primetime Emmy nominee Sweeney, and BAFTA nominated thespian Daniel Br\u00fchl.\nUnfortunately, what prevented Eden from receiving an MG was its lackluster reviews (currently at 55% on Rotten Tomatoes) out of TIFF. It should be noted that the movie\u2019s world premiere at Roy Thomson Hall was temporarily halted by a medical emergency suffered by a ticketholder. Sources tell Deadline had the movie received great reviews ala last fall\u2019s The Brutalist (93% certified fresh), which bowed out of Venice and was acquired by A24 for $10M leading to 3 Oscar wins and $16.2M domestic/$50.3M WW box office, Eden\u2018s fate would have been different. Post TIFF, AGC Studios was seeking a distribution deal whereby the distributor would handle P&A. Lionsgate at one point was interested, and liked the movie, but had their own Sweeney movie in Americana. Vertical was willing to make a low single digit millions P&A commitment on Eden with a distribution fee in the low-to-mid teens. The pic is on a 30-day exclusive theatrical window before PVOD and an awards campaign is being mulled.\nHowever, paradise isn\u2019t completely lost on Eden. While some foreign partners who bought theatrical (i.e. Germany, Benelux, Italy, Eastern Europe, Middle East, China, Japan) stand the risk of a haircut at the box office, there is about half of foreign\u2019s first window sold to Prime Video. The advise for Eden\u2018s foreign theatrical distributors is to mimic Vertical\u2019s stateside release pattern and bank on this star-studded movie delivering in the home market. At the same time, there wasn\u2019t a domestic screen count minimum requirement which had to satisfy foreign distributors (who often argue for 1,000 minimum U.S. break). Eden opted for a platform release to build word of mouth (the Rotten Tomatoes audience score being higher than critics at 71%).\nHow the back of the napkin math works for Eden is that the $55M production cost was reduced down to a net $35M production cost thanks to soft money from Australian tax credits. AGC Studios raised a net $26M in foreign sales out of Cannes 2024 giving them a gap to make-up of $9M. Financiers Library Pictures, Medan Pictures, as well as AGC Studios covered 15% of the budget, collectively that being the $9M once you factor in the cost of money. Elevate and Cooper Island were lenders against the presales and tax credit.\nHow to make-up the majority of that gap? The idea is with a domestic streaming deal which AGC Studios and Vertical are both currently teaming to negotiate on. Aren\u2019t those deals based on a movie\u2019s box office success? Not necessarily as the sheen of the cast alone is enough to drive viewers to watch, all box office aside. The hope is that PVOD, TVOD and AVOD will also assist in clearing Eden\u2018s $9M shortfall. AGC Studios didn\u2019t charge a 20% foreign sales package fee on the film rather 5% which is the going rate in the current climate particularly on an indie title with financiers like this.\nHoward was attracted to Eden in its true story about \u201ccharacters who are really pressure tested\u201d in a tale where mother nature wasn\u2019t the biggest antagonist, rather human nature. Howard first heard about this story 15 years ago on a trip to the Galapagos; Eden following a small group of European settlers who flee post WWI Germany for a peaceful life in the wilds of Floreana Island. Law plays Dr. Friedrich Ritter, whose survival and philosophical tales in the wild have become quite popular in his native Germany. He lives on the island with his partner, Dore Strauch (Kirby), who is battling MS, though Ritter believes he\u2019s been able to quell her condition. Their solitude is suddenly intruded upon by fellow German family, Margret and Heinz Wittmer (Sweeney and Br\u00fchl), who are inspired by the doctor\u2019s writing. The simple island life of caves, crabs, lizards, wild boar and no running water is upended with the arrival of de Armas\u2019 Baroness Eloise Bosquet de Wagner Wehrhorn who threatens to build an exclusive hotel. Chaos ensues among the group in a Lord of the Flies meets Mosquito Coast like movie, which in some ways thematically isn\u2019t far from Howard\u2019s dark 2003 $60M budgeted western, The Missing, starring Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones. That movie with reviews of 58% on RT, and a B CinemaScore made $27M domestic, $38.3M worldwide financed by Joe Roth\u2019s Revolutions Studios.\nEden\u2018s arrival in theaters comes at a time when motion picture distributors are severely weighing whether a feature is worth their investment, and streamers significantly curtailing their film pick-ups; their internal efficiency statistic of cost-to-viewership being the key metric of a movie\u2019s worth. Coming out of a sluggish Sundance, and entering a vibrant Venice-Telluride-Toronto where there\u2019s an abundance of product, overnight sudden auctions have become rare with acquisition talks with potential distributors long after the fests are done. Some film financiers such as Black Bear have opted in this climate to brave it and release and market their own slates, their critically acclaimed Matthew McConaughey SXSW title, The Rivals of Amziah King, embarking on such a route.\nJust like Eden is a cautionary tale about humans\u2019 endurance in the wild, so is it one when it comes to indie financing nowadays, and the challenges involved in building a mid-sized budget picture sans a domestic deal.\nIf survival of the fittest exists in this brutal landscape of indie feature financing and acquisitions, sources consider Eden a compass.\nLet\u2019s not forget that THE SHELTERING SKY, THE MOSQUITO COAST, and AT PLAY IN THE FIELDS OF THE LORD \u2013 similar films with big stars and directors \u2013 were considered bombs as well.\nHeard the budget was higher. Vertical always there the loses aren\u2019t so steep\nWhat losses ??\nGotta believe the movie will generate WAY more than $9m from ancillaries over time. Thats an epic cast by any standards and the audience worth of the mouth is quite good if the article is accurate.\nGood to know that companies like Vertical can help provide a genuine path to profits for movies that don\u2019t hit the festival sale jackpot !!!!!\nThis isn\u2019t a bomb. People don\u2019t go to the theater to watch dramas anymore. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a small, mid or big budget drama. Nobody goes to the theater to see them. It\u2019s the end of a hundred year old film genre. And the end of movie stars.\nIts premise is more suited for art houses, and the movie got mixed reviews. That\u2019s why it didn\u2019t gain any traction at the theaters\u2026 plus, a halfhearted marketing push. With so few screens, the movie has to be award buzzy\u2026 this is not.\nWhat kind of give back did AGC give to their foreign buyers since the film did not have a major theatrical release?\nDidn\u2019t the article say that there weren\u2019t any screen commitments to foreign distributors. I\u2019m sure Amazon Prome\nWeren\u2019t worried about that either. There\u2019s your answer."

I\u2019d expect this from Abercrombie\u2026 but not yall.'\nOne user wrote of the promotion featuring the surging star, 'This is such a f****d up campaign' while another called it 'weird as hell.'\nOthers vented about the message they felt the campaign inherently sent, as one said they were 'never shopping at AE again' while another asked the fashion house, 'What are you doing???'\nOne Instagram user speculated, 'This has to be rage bait,' while another suggested the clothing retailer 'read the room\u2026' in reference to the current campaign.\nAnother user asked, 'Who on your marketing team said this was a good idea.'\nYet many were quick to defend Sydney, branding the backlash 'unhinged'.\nThey shared on X/Twitter: 'I'm not sure how to say this nicely but if you think a jeans ad with a pun about Sydney Sweeney being pretty is a nazi dogwhistle you genuinely need to put the phone down for a while.'\nAnother argued that 'everyone is seriously reading too much into this and y\u2019all need to go take a hike or something because sydney sweeney is literally just promoting jeans, not \u201cnazi propaganda.\"'\nThe absurd response from some corners of the internet is absolutely not reflective of how American Eagle's customers feel,' the representative added to TMZ\n'The claim that Sydney Sweeney\u2019s American Eagle ad is pro-eugenics because of a \u201cgood genes/jeans\u201d pun is genuinely unhinged. It\u2019s a denim campaign, not a manifesto. Not every blonde with blue eyes is a Nazi. Some of you need a history book \u2014 and a nap,' wrote another.\n'You guys don\u2019t have to like Sydney Sweeney or the ways she promotes herself but don\u2019t you think comparing those Jean commercials to nazi propaganda is a tad extreme?' noted another.\nSweeney said in a July 23 news release about the fall campaign: 'There is something so effortless about American Eagle.'\nShe said of the clothier: 'It\u2019s the perfect balance of being put-together but still feeling like yourself.'\nThe Euphoria star continued: 'Their commitment to creating pieces that make you feel confident and comfortable in your own skin is something that resonates with me.\n'It\u2019s rare to find a brand that grows with you, the way American Eagle has for generations.'\nThe Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood actress wrapped up in saying, 'They have literally been there with me through every version of myself.'\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters president Jennifer Foyle opened up about the ad campaign, which is slated to raise money for domestic violence charities, in the news release.\nThe advert has divided fans, however, with one critic calling the clip 'one of the loudest and most obvious racialized dog whistles we've seen and heard in a while'\nYet many were quick to defend Sydney, branding the backlash 'unhinged'\n'This fall season, American Eagle is celebrating what makes our brand iconic \u2013 trendsetting denim that leads, never follows,' Foyle said. 'Innovative fits and endless versatility reflect how our community wears their denim: mixed, matched, layered and lived in.'\nThe fashion executive explained why Sweeney made for the perfect focal point of the promotion.\n'With Sydney Sweeney front and center, she brings the allure, and we add the flawless wardrobe for the winning combo of ease, attitude and a little mischief,' Foyle said.\nIn terms of the charitable aspect of the ad campaign, American Eagle Outfitters is working with Crisis Text Line in an effort to provide grants for mental health support and crisis intervention.\nProceeds from a special edition of The Sydney Jean will be donated to the organization.\nAmong the related grants include a $100,000 Signature Grant posted this past February 2025 in an effort to expand programs at Historically Black Colleges and Universities."
