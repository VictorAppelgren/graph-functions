  "content": "The depraved teacher, who authorities claim confessed to stabbing a couple hiking in Arkansas with their two young daughters, pleaded not guilty to capital murder charges Thursday.\n\nAndrew James McGann, 28, was charged with two counts of capital murder for the July 26 killing of Clinton David Brink, 43, and Cristen Amanda Brink, 41.\n\nMcGann was set to start working at Springdale Public Schools, just 30 miles north of Devil\u2019s Den State Park, where he allegedly slaughtered and ditched Clinton and Cristen\u2019s bodies.\n\nThe couple died protecting their daughters, 9 and 7 years old, from their killer, family members said.\n\nThe girls were found uninjured after the attack and were placed in the custody of other family members.\n\nAuthorities have yet to determine a motive for the attack, but don\u2019t suspect the young girls were the primary targets.\n\nPolice said that Clinton hung behind to try and fend off the assailant while Cristen rushed their children to safety. Once they were far enough away, Cristen doubled back to help her husband and was eventually killed alongside him.\n\nTheir bodies were found in a remote part of the park, far off the hiking trail. By then, their assailant was long gone, and police waited six hours before notifying the public that an apparent murderer was still at large.\n\nIn the days following the brutal double homicide, a statewide manhunt ensued as police provided a sketch and descriptions of the killer based on the courageous girls\u2019 vivid accounts.\n\nOn July 31, McGann was arrested mid-haircut, which authorities chalked up to the teacher\u2019s attempt to get a fresh back-to-school look \u2014 not to conceal his identity.\n\nMcGann\u2019s shellshocked hairdresser described him as \u201csoulless,\u201d while parents of his former students said he was frequently \u201cstandoffish\u201d and relatively \u201cdisinterested in his students.\u201d\n\nHe resigned from an elementary school in Texas in 2023 after an internal investigation found that \u201chis classroom management and professional judgment\u201d were below par.\n\nAt the same time, he faced allegations of displaying inappropriate behavior in front of his students, including \u201ctickling\u201d and giving gifts to female students, horrified parents told The Post.\n\nCircuit Judge Joanna Taylor scheduled McGann\u2019s next hearing for Nov. 14. He\u2019s being held without bond.",

Reporters received tips of a massive police presence in the area at 4:30 p.m., but were told to leave the area and given no info, 5News said.\nIt was not until 8:40 p.m. \u2014 roughly six hours after the initial call \u2014 that Arkansas State Police released the first warning that a massive manhunt was underway, the outlet noted.\nThe delay was blamed on how \u201cthe terrain is rugged, vegetation is thick and there is no cellphone service.\u201d\n\u201cThe location is in remote, rural Arkansas,\u201d an ASP spokesperson told 5News. \u201cIt took time for our special agents to arrive on scene, locate witnesses, conduct interviews, and collaborate information so we released the appropriate information.\u201d\nPolice issued an updated description of the suspect on Sunday and said he was last seen wearing a long-sleeve shirt with the sleeves rolled up rather than a tank top as initially reported.\nHe is described as having a medium build, wearing dark pants, a red baseball cap and sunglasses. Police said he also had a backpack and was wearing fingerless gloves.\nThe suspect was seen driving into the park in a black four-door sedan, possibly a Mazda, with its license plate covered by tape.\nShea Lewis, secretary of the Arkansas Department of Parks, Heritage and Tourism, said in a statement that the state has \u201cincreased law enforcement presence in our state parks.\u201d\n\u201cOur Park Rangers are fully commissioned law enforcement officers, and they are actively engaged in ensuring the safety and security of our park guests,\u201d he said. \u201cWe remain committed to supporting the ongoing investigation and to maintaining Arkansas State Parks as safe, welcoming places for all.\u201d\nDevil\u2019s Den State Park \u2014 nestled in Ozark National Forest about 30 miles south of Fayetteville \u2014 is a tourist destination famous for its caves, rock formations and thousands of acres of woods."

They ask that if anyone has any information at all that will help in the investigation to please contact the proper authorities immediately.\u201d\nAuthorities have not disclosed how the mother and father were killed.

Police blamed it on the difficulties of the remote murder scene.\nThe bodies were found in \u201ca remote and rural area, where the terrain is rugged, vegetation is thick and there is no cellphone service,\u201d state police said."
