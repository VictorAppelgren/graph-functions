  "title": "90s Movies: A Nostalgic Look at What Made Them Special",
  "description": "From practical effects to VHS rentals, weird blockbusters to iconic soundtracks, the 90s were a unique era for film. Nostalgic for the movies of your childhood? Here are 10 things that made 90s movies so special.",
  "content": "I'm a 90s kid, which meant I spent the bulk of my childhood watching the films of the 90s (and older obviously), which admittedly makes me pretty biased when I say that 90s films were pretty special.\n\nOf course, every era of film over the last century or so has some unique flavor to it. However, the 90s were a pivotal time for film where many things were transitioning from long-established traditions and the modern methods of the 2000s and later. This is why I think the movies of the 90s are so special.\n\nThis is the decade where CG finally became viable for mainstream use in film. Starting with movies like The Abyss and Terminator 2: Judgment Day and rounding the decade off with CG-heavy blockbusters like The Matrix.\n\nHowever, while these were the early days of CG, it was also the end of decades of practical effects experience. So we got movies like Total Recall, Jurassic Park, and Death Becomes Her with astounding practical effects, with perhaps wonky CGI thrown into the mix in some cases.\n\nHappily, we are now going back to practical effects becoming more common in movies, with the added bonus of mature CG to enhance those in-camera VFX to give us the best of both worlds.\n\nThe Rise (and Peak) of the VHS Rental Culture\n\nWhile people were obviously renting movies on VHS in the 80s, VCR ownership peaked by the year 2000 and by 2001 DVD sales surpassed VHS for the first time. In short, the 90s were when VHS rental and VCR ownership were red-hot.\n\nNow, VHS is objectively a terrible format, and since I had been unlucky enough to experience LaserDisc in the 90s, I was painfully aware of this. However, nothing beats heading out to a rental store on a Friday night and browsing the shelves of tapes, looking for something to watch over the weekend.\n\nIn particular, the delectable selection of terrible direct-to-video slop of the 90s practically defined this era for me. There was always some sort of combo deal where you could take some cheap and nasty movie along with a new release, and so you'd just look at the covers, read the blurb, and still have no idea what you're getting into. No internet, and no way to check reviews\u2014it was amazing.\n\nI'm not going to downplay how absolutely amazing the music of the 80s was, but there was definitely a change in the air in the 90s when it came to the music scene, and movie soundtracks reflected that. There's a reason almost every modern movie seems to feature 90s music\u2014just slowed down and sung mournfully by a waif for some reason.\n\nBack then, I had my uncle record the music from the credits of films like The Fifth Element and Men in Black from VHS to casette tape, and I still listen to many 90s movie soundtracks on services like Spotify to this day.\n\nI know we get plenty of \"weird\" movies and shows these days, but they feel so safe compared to what came out in the 90s. I'm talking weird movies like Strange Days, The Mask, Fear And Loathing in Las Vegas, Pi, Jacob's Ladder, Dark City and so many more. If you have any issues with existential dread, you probably want to give this decade a skip.\n\nThe 90s were pretty much the beginning of the end for film, and by the 2000s Hollywood was starting to embrace digital recording technology and neat tricks like color-grading made possible by using ones and zeros instead of silver crystals to record light particles.\n\n90s films certainly look distinct from movies that came out in the 80s, whether they shared film as a basis or not. There's a dream-like quality to these movies that no other era has quite managed to replicate.\n\nI can't help but remember the 90s not just as a time of iconic and singular movies, but also as a time driven by the personality of the actors themselves. These days, I don't think actors play quite as much of a role in a movie's marketing or personality, but in the 90s names like Stallone, Van Damme, or (believe it or not) Segal would share almost equal movie poster real estate with the actual title of the film.\n\nGenre Blending and \"Cool' Aesthetics Were the Norm\n\nIt's a tradition that's lived on, but the 90s really was a wonderful time for genre-blending and experimentation with tropes that had become stale over the course of the 20th century. We got horror-comedies, action sci-fi, and plenty of other interesting mashups. It was also the peak of that \"90s cool\" genre, with movies like Blade and The Matrix exemplifying the leather and shades aesthetic.\n\nWhile it still happens today, it's pretty rare for mid-budget films to strike it big, and really is there even still a thing like a mid-budget movie these days? The 90s had plenty of examples of movies that didn't cost a lot to make, but became huge profitable hits. Now, it seems that studios are spending more money than ever on big-budget films and barely breaking even after marketing and cinema cuts of tickets are taken into account.\n\nIn the 90s, we had movies like Pretty Woman, Home Alone, Kindergarden Cop, and, of course, the first movie I ever saw in a cinema\u2014Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Which, for years, was the most profitable indie movie in history. These movies cost modest amounts of money to make, but were amazing works that were rewarded prodigiously.\n\nIf you look at our this list from our friensd over at Screen Rant with the highest-grossing movies of the 2010s, those titles probably all individually cost as much to make as the top ten mid-budget 90s movie list combined.\n\nIn the 90s, most people didn't have a smartphone. They didn't have home internet access, and there was no rescue drone coming for you. These realities made it easier to write good stories in genres like horror or suspense, which just won't work anymore in modern times. There's a reason horror films now tend to be set before all of these convenient technologies made these plots untenable. The only alternative is to find some reason for all of your character's phones to stop working in the first five minutes of the film.\n\nThey just don't make movie trailers like they used to. Not only do modern trailers boldly spoil the entire movie plot, they take themselves way too seriously. Case in point, the \"In a world...\" movie voice is pretty much gone. Don't know what I'm talking about, have a listen to one of my favorite trailers of all time\u2014Tomorrow Never Dies.\n\nNow that is how you tease a movie and explain just enough of the plot to make it interesting. I need us to have a dude with an overly dramatic voice anti-ASMR movie details right into my earholes. We've definttely left some things behind in the 90s that need to come back!",

      "text": "Summary\n- The success of franchises like the MCU and Fast and Furious is not just limited to box office performance, but also includes merchandising, fan theories, and theme park attractions.\n- The Avengers, Star Wars, and Jurassic World proved that capitalizing on iconic franchises can lead to huge box office success, with Avengers: Endgame becoming the highest-grossing film of all time.\n- Disney's live-action remakes, such as The Lion King and Frozen II, have been successful at the box office, showcasing the studio's ability to reimagine beloved classics for modern audiences.\nThe 2010s had some huge box office hits with nearly 40 films making over $1 billion. Popular franchises emerged in the 2010s, none more so than the MCU, which had a dominant spell during the decade. The superhero franchise has proved to be a massive box office success, already having 10 MCU films grossing over $1 billion. Large franchises and sequels played a massive part in making this era of filmmaking so profitable and successful.\nIt's not just the box office performance that has made these successful films so popular. Merchandising, fan theories, and even theme park attractions have all cemented how remarkably well these movies have done. One of the biggest reasons for their success is how invested fans can get in these franchises and film genres. Of all the mega-hits to come out of the 2010s, here are the ten movies that pulled in the most money at the box office.\n10 Black Panther\nBlack Panther was a massive hit for Marvel that only further proved they didn't need established superheroes to make box office phenomenons. Iron Man was early proof of this, kick-starting the entire MCU and grossing over $500 million. Ten years later, Black Panther came along as one of the few solo Marvel projects to gross over $1 billion. The late Chadwick Boseman put in a career-defining performance, helping the film gross over $1.344 billion and become the 10th highest-grossing film of the 2010s.\n9 Avengers: Age Of Ultron\nContinuing the theme of Marvel dominance, Avengers: Age of Ultron was the 9th highest-grossing film of the decade after making upwards of $1.403 billion. After the success of the first Avengers film, Marvel capitalized on the team-up concept and made yet another huge financial profit from the sequel. Despite being the lowest-rated and lowest-grossing Avengers movie, Avengers: Age of Ultron still managed to soar at the box office. This confirmed that the Avengers formula was a certified victory for Marvel and helped lay the groundwork for their most financially successful projects.\n8 Frozen II\nDisney's 2020s box office has been shaky to say the least, however, Frozen was one film that really stood out in the 2010s. Six years later, they struck gold again with Frozen II which became an even bigger triumph than the original. Its box office totaled $1.453 billion, highlighting quite how much people loved the original. With its interesting premise and lovable characters, Frozen II managed to be one of Disney's all-time biggest films. With Frozen 3 officially in the works, it could give Disney the box office boost they need, adding to Avatar: The Way of Water's success and putting the studio back on track.\n7 Furious 7\nThe Fast and Furious franchise has been going strong for over two decades and has released a film as recent as this year with Fast X. While Fast X had mixed box office success, Furious 7 was a record high for the film series. Paul Walker passed away during the film's production, yet the studio was still able to make the movie a massive hit, finishing Furious 7 after Paul Walker's death and turning out the highest-grossing film of the franchise. It grossed over $1.515 billion and was met with positive reviews, perfectly cementing Walker's legacy.\n6 The Avengers\nThe Avengers will go down as one of the most iconic movies of its era. It may not be the most profitable of the series, nor the highest rated, but it certainly holds its place in cinema history. Marvel fans all united in theaters to witness the comic book franchise's most memorable heroes unite on the big screen for the very first time. The movie managed to gross over $1.519 billion - a few million more than Furious 7 - and end Phase 1 of the MCU. It succeeded in becoming the sixth highest-grossing movie of the decade.\n5 The Lion King\nConsidering that The Lion King was once regarded as a classic that perhaps shouldn't be remade, it was easy to see why the 2019 film could have been a disappointment. Grossing around $1.656 billion, The Lion King managed to prove that live-action remakes is a formula that can work. While there are questions around Disney's live-action remake strategy, The Lion King's box office success has shown why Disney continues in this direction. With a stacked cast and a fairly large $260 million budget, Disney banked on The Lion King being a huge hit and it paid off. While their recent Little Mermaid didn't do quite as well as expected, Disney continues to look for their 2020s live-action remake victory.\n4 Jurassic World\nMuch like The Lion King, Jurassic World capitalized on its predecessor to make it a hit. With Jurassic Park being such an iconic and recognizable franchise, cashing in on the name was a no-brainer. The movie proved to do even better at the box office than expected, earning $1.671 billion and making it the 4th highest-grossing movie of the decade. Jurassic World started Chris Pratt's box office domination, becoming his first-ever movie to gross over $1 billion. He has since had four other movies pass the $1 billion mark including Jurassic World's sequel, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, which was 13th in the 2010s box office.\n3 Avengers: Infinity War\nBetween 2018 and 2019, Marvel had five movies gross over $1 billion, emphasizing their dominance of the 2010s. They had spent much of the decade building up their cinematic universe and come the end of the 2010s, their movies were quickly becoming must-see entertainment for moviegoers. Avengers: Infinity War was no exception; the movie brought the biggest heroes together and had them face their greatest threat yet. The film grossed over $2 billion in 48 days. Its record-breaking numbers speak for themselves in terms of how much hype there was surrounding it.\n2 Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens\nThe return of one of cinema's biggest franchises did not disappoint financially. When Disney acquired Star Wars, it was only a matter of time before they brought back the franchise, doing so in the form of Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Reviving Star Wars was always going to be a huge gamble and many mistakes were made in Star Wars' sequel trilogy. Despite this, Star Wars: The Force Awakens was anything but a disappointment financial-wise. It became the second highest-grossing film of the 2010s, making $2.066 billion which showed that regardless of some negative reception, there was a huge interest in more Star Wars content.\n1 Avengers: Endgame\nWith the success of Avengers: Infinity War just a year prior, its sequel managed to surpass the high box office expectations and become the highest-grossing film of the decade. Earning $2.798 billion, Avengers: Endgame not only dominated the 2010s but became the second highest-grossing movie of all time. The 2010s box office belonged to the MCU, and it is only fitting that the film that culminated 11 years of movies became Marvel's biggest cinematic triumph. While the MCU continues today, Phase 3's final movie wrapped up the Infinity Saga and did so in a big way, metaphorically and financially."

      "text": "Computer-generated graphics (CG) have revolutionized what filmmakers can do these days. It seems the only limit is your imagination (and budget), because there are no practical challenges you need to overcome.\nYet before CG was a thing, or at least advanced enough to play a major role in a movie, we had films that defied the imagination and brought places, people, and creatures to life using nothing but practical artistry. If you feel there's something missing with glossy, modern CG, then any one of these films will work as a strong palate cleanser.\nThis list is in no particular order. Every movie here is a banger in its own right, as the kids like to say.\n9 The Thing\n|\nRelease Year |\n1982 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 49 minutes |\nIf there is such a thing as a perfect movie, then John Carpenter's The Thing is pretty close to it. The story, the pacing, the acting, it all comes together. A remake of 1951's The Thing From Another World, this movie's greatest strength is its creature effects.\nThe titular Thing is a beast of infinite horrors, and the imaginative ways Rob Bottin and his team designed and animated the alien in its various forms have never been surpassed. The modern prequel to this film tried to replicate the presence of the creatures in the 1982 film using CG, and failed miserably.\n8 2001: A Space Odyssey\n|\nRelease Year |\n1968 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n2 hours 29 minutes |\n2001: A Space Odyssey came out the year before the Moon landings, and I guess people must have thought the visual effects were out of this world, because a long-standing conspiracy theory is that the landings were faked with the help of Stanley Kubrick. Of course, this is entirely possible, but Kubrick being Kubrick, he probably insisted they film on location.\nAll joked aside, this movie holds up perfectly more than half a century later. The use of detailed models, multiple exposures of the same film to optically composite elements, and ingenious tricks to fake zero gravity or create the trippy visions seen by the protagonist near the end of the film represent a long list of technical solutions that lesser creators would have given up on.\nIt's also perhaps the quintessential cautionary story about the dangers of artificial intelligence, which is amazing considering that when this film came out the most powerful computer in the world was nothing more than a glorified pocket calculator.\nA movie so good, it convinced people that Kubrick helped fake the moon landings.\n7 Star Wars (1977)\n|\nRelease Year |\n1977 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n2 hours 1 minute |\nOf course, there probably isn't a person in the world who hasn't heard of Star Wars, but despite how massive the franchise has become, we can still appreciate the monumental visual effects achievement the first film was at the time.\nThis is the beginning of Industrial Light and Magic. It's the first time such dynamic space battles were made possible thanks to brilliant camera and miniature work. The dirty and lived-in look of the world was also a big break from what space and sci-fi movies looked like before. Not a frame of this film goes by without some amazing practical artistry on display.\nIt might seem a little quaint now, but it's still entirely possible to forget that you're looking at special effects, and just immerse yourself in this world. Now, technically there are some computer graphics in this movie. Specifically, the wireframe 3D graphics you see on some computer displays in the movie, but the actual visual effects are all practical.\nThe original Star Wars film still holds up after all these years\u2014and after all George's fiddling.\n6 Blade Runner (1982)\n|\nRelease Year |\n1982 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 57 minutes |\nBlade Runner effectively established what a cyberpunk film should look like on screen. The work was done with miniatures, and amazing in-camera effects (such as the flames coming from industrial chimneys.\nThis film is dripping with atmosphere and style from every pore, and the world feels real and grounded, despite being cobbled together from miniatures and sound stages.\nInterestingly, after visiting the set of Blade Runner for a few days, Ed Neumeier was inspired by what he saw to create Robocop (as per our friends at Collider), another film you'll find further down this list.\nOne of the most important films in history, from the visual language, to the acting, to the deeply philosophical story. Also Pris does some sick flips.\n5 An American Werewolf in London (1982)\n|\nRelease Year |\n1981 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hours 37 minutes |\nAs a movie, I personally prefer the later sequel, but An American Werewolf in London still has the greatest werewolf transformation scene in history. Sure you could go look up just this one pivotal scene on YouTube, but it's within the context of the movie as a whole where it has the greatest impact.\nRich Baker and his team are firing on all cylinders for the entire run of this film, and while the effects are sparing, when you see the creatures (or the undead victims) you can't help but admire the twisted minds that spend thousands of hours painstakingly inserting every stand of fur or line of detail just to scare you for a few minutes.\nThis classic horror film still has, hands-down, the best on-screen werewolf transformation of all time.\n4 Alien (1979)\n|\nRelease Year |\n1979 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 57 minutes |\nThe visual language and design of Alien has become both iconic and timeless. The look and feel of Alien comes from two main artists. Ron Cobb's designs are largely responsible for the technology we see, such as the human spaceships and ship interiors, while H.R. Giger was responsible for the alien and its organic accessories, like the eggs and the facehugger.\nThe gritty, realistic depiction of space truckers picking up a load they should have declined still looks amazing, and even the modern films have strived to preserve the look of this universe rather than misguided attempts at \"updating\" it.\n3 The Dark Crystal (1982)\n|\nRelease Year |\n1982 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 35 minutes |\nWhile Jim Henson is mainly known for his family-friendly Muppets, he wasn't averse to more mature fare. The Dark Crystal isn't suitable for younger viewers, but it is a wonderful, beautifully-crafted dark fantasy tale. The conflict between the alien, but gentle Gelflings and the horrible vulture-like Skeksis play out in the form of puppetry on hand-crafted stages, but you'll quickly forget that you're watching a puppet show and believe that these characters are real.\nJim Henson and Frank Oz catch lightning in a bottle with one of the greatest dark fantasy films every made\u2014with puppets!\n2 Robocop (1987)\n|\nRelease Year |\n1987 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 42 minutes |\nRobocop is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I can literally spend hours talking about the themes, the satire, the cinematography, and all the behind-the-scenes shenanigans, but the visual effects alone would make it stand out from the crowd.\nThat iridescent plastic suit is completely believable as a heavy metal cyborg body. The facial makeup on Peter Weller completely convince you that this isn't a human you're looking at. Everything related to Robocop himself is visually flawless. I certainly think it looks better than the suit in the remake!\nApart from Robo's fabulous effects, the blood and gore is next-level (though take the R-rating seriously!) and Phil Tippet's stop-motion work with the ED-209 is top-tier to this day. The only black mark here are Dick Jones' weirdly long arms in the final sequence of the film, but we don't talk about that.\nThe greatest sci-fi satire ever made, and still a great story at its core. Watch this now or there will be...trouble.\n1 The Terminator (1984)\n|\nRelease Year |\n1984 |\n|---|---|\n|\nRuntime |\n1 hour 47 minutes |\nThe Terminator is one of those rare indie movies (yes it was self-financed) that punches so far above its weight most people think of it as a big studio blockbuster. However, this film had almost no money, and often needed to be shot in ways that are legally dubious,thanks to a lack of permits.\nDespite this, Stan Winston's and his team manages to create a groundbreaking mix of rear projection composition, miniatures, puppets, prosthetics, and stop-motion for what's really just a slasher film with a smart premise.\nIt's also interesting that The Terminator and Terminator 2: Judgement Day neatly lay on either side of the CG and non-CG divide, as the second film was the first truly major box office success that relied heavily on computer effects for the T-1000.\nI recently re-watched The Terminator in the cinema, and it absolutely holds up and is not one inch less tense than it was the day it released.\nA time-travel slasher film that skyrocketed the careers of several superstars and launched a franchise that, like a Terminator, just won't die.\nI wish this list could be so much longer. It would let me add more films like The Wizard of Oz or Conan the Barbarian. The 20th century is filled with wonderful movies that use practical artistry and in-camera optical effects to craft unforgettable worlds and characters. Ones with weight and substance that are more believable than much of the early CG effects we saw in the 90s and 2000s.\nToday, filmmakers are using the best of both worlds, combining practical and CG effects to truly elevate what's possible in films like Blade Runner 2049 and Dune. For someone who loves movie effects, that's good news all around!"

      "text": "I used to love watching movie trailers. Long before we had the internet at home, some of the magazines I bought had a cover disc that included some movie trailers. I watched the trailer for Tomorrow Never Dies over and over again on my PC back in the day, until I finally got to see the movie.\nThese days, I don't rush to YouTube to see the latest trailer for a movie that I plan to watch. Instead, I avoid it like the plague, because it's almost certainly going to spoil something important for me.\nTrailers Used to Be an Artform\nFor the longest time\u2014decades and decades\u2014a movie trailer was a crucial piece of media that could make or break a movie before a single ticket had been sold. In a minute or two, you had to convince people that they wanted to see your film. You had to excite and intrigue them but, most importantly, you had to leave them wanting more. Editing a trailer was a job for a specialist, and would even be done by an independent marketing company, rather than the movie's director or editor.\nLook at this trailer for 2008's Watchmen.\nIt shows off key parts of the film, without actually letting on what the plot is. The premise of the film is on show, the visuals, the vibe, everything that matters, but the trailer is cut in such a way that it's self-contained and satisfying while still leaving you in the dark as to what the exact plot is. Whether you read the Watchmen graphic novel, or didn't know a thing about it, this trailer is equally effective.\nLikewise, let's look at the Tomorrow Never Dies trailer I loved so much as a child.\nNow this is still a master class in how to cut a movie trailer. It covers the broad points of the plot setup, it shows off some cool action scenes (but not all by far), and is sharply edited with humor. Who wouldn't want to watch this movie after seeing the trailer? There's much more to the actual move than what's shown here, and classic trailers might even have some deliberate misdirection, which means even more surprises when you sit down to watch the final cut.\nA Lot of Streaming \u201cTrailers\u201d Are Just Random Clips\nSince we're all watching on-demand movies and shows using streaming services now, you could argue that trailers are more important than ever. With classic films that already have theatrical trailers, we tend to simply get those existing trailers as a preview, but it seems that neither the rights holders or streaming platforms can be bothered to pay for properly put-together trailers for everything else.\nFor a lot of streaming shows, the \"trailers\" are either just a random assortment of clips, or it's literally just a segment of the show or film that plays for a minute or two. Not a carefully selected bit of the program that would give you useful information about the plot, or make you want to watch it either. Honestly, the only thing these auto-playing previews achieve is annoying me into not wanting to watch whatever I accidentally highlighted with my remote.\nMovie Trailers Summarize Plots and Give Away Twists!\nI can understand the financial and logistic reasons for now cutting a good trailer together for a huge backlog of TV shows, but I'm much less sympathetic when it comes to trailers made for modern movies.\nTrailers that spoil big movie twists are nothing new. It happened with Soylent Green in the 70s, and with Terminator 2 in the 90s. It's not unheard of at all. However, I do feel that modern trailers simply give away too much of the movie during the trailer. It doesn't feel like I'm watching a trailer for a film, it feels like I'm just watching a two-minute cut of the movie. After seeing most trailers these days, I basically feel like I've already seen the movie, or at least I've read the CliffsNotes.\nIt's almost as if teaser trailers are now what trailers used to be, where we still get a little mystery about what's going to be in a film.\nI\u2019m Avoiding Trailers Now\nWhile not all modern trailers are like this (I thought the new Superman trailer was pretty good), I just can't take the chance of watching the trailer for a movie that I'm interested in.\nIf I don't leave the plot details a complete mystery, it really robs the impact of the film, but apparently that's how things work now.\nWhy Do Trailers Suck Now?\nA few years ago, I read that some people in Hollywood feel that spoilers in trailers are good. There's a theory that it's a generational thing, and that having key plot points spoiled in a trailer makes younger people these days more likely to watch than not. Attention spans are shrinking, and you should probably just throw all your best stuff in the trailer, because it's the only two minutes with potential customers you're going to get.\nSince on-demand streaming is now the norm, and people may not even go to the cinema to watch a movie, this modern style of trailer could be the result of what the algorithm says converts more trailer viewers into movie watchers. Test screenings might show that certain scenes are going to have the biggest impact on audiences, so the bean counters want them in the trailer, even if it spoils a major twist or plot point.\nThere's also just so much content coming out, that studios might feel they should let it all hang out in the trailer to have any chance of catching the attention of overloaded viewers.\nWhatever the reasoning, trailers don't seem to have the same purpose and function anymore, or perhaps it's that modern audiences are just looking for something different in movie trailers, and the industry has just responded to that.\nPlease Make Trailers Good Again\nOn the rare occasion I still go to the cinema these days, I have a sense of trepidation that I'm going to see a trailer I'll regret. So in order to skip the ads and trailers, I try to be 15 minutes late to the movie, which usually works out pretty well. You can take that as a free tip.\nWhile I know it's a plea that will fall on deaf ears, if enough people complain about modern trailers, perhaps they'll change back to something more like the trailers I used to love. However, I guess the numbers don't lie, and simplistic, spoiler-laden trailers must be filling seats. At least, if they didn't believe that, then we wouldn't be in this mess."

      "text": "Quick Links\nAs it dawns on us that the internet isn't forever, and you don't really have control over your digital media, it's becoming more popular to collect physical media. While DVDs and Blu-ray media are a non-issue, what about older formats like LaserDisc and VHS? Should anyone be collecting these? If so, which one makes the most sense?\nQuality and Format Differences\nLaserDisc is a higher quality format than VHS, period. LaserDisc offered almost twice as many horizontal lines of detail than VHS, so there really is no comparison. However, with LaserDisc you'll have to flip the disc over partway through most films. Like me, you probably have rose-tinted memories of what VHS looked like, but if you head to YouTube and look at digitized VHS recordings, you'll soon realize we could barely see what was going on. While LDs are still short of DVDs in quality, on the right equipment it can still look great.\nLongevity and Durability\nVHS tapes are not great from a longevity and durability perspective. Every time you play back a VHS tape, it gets a little more worn out. Not to mention that the tape itself will degrade over time, and it's susceptible to magnets.\nLaserDiscs, on the other hand, may also be analog in nature, but because the disc is read using a laser, there's no wear and tear, and the quality should not degrade through normal use. However, these discs are susceptible to their own form of \"disc rot.\" It's not entirely clear why some LDs get disc rot, but it's enough of a problem that enthusiasts maintain a list of problematic titles.\nOverall, I'd give this one to LaserDiscs on balance, especially since VHS seems to have its own inevitable decline as well.\nOne thing I do worry about is the longevity of the actual players, since LDs will eventually break down when the lasers don't work anymore, and VHS players are mechanically complex and were unreliable even when new. Well, at least the mainstream models my family could afford were. Whether there will be any way to play these media decades from now is debatable.\nRarity and Availability\nLaserDisc was a relatively rare format at the best of times. One of the main reasons VHS became so popular was affordability, and the sheer number of VHS titles released. So finding VHS from the late 90s and onward should still be relatively easy. That said, you'll find plenty of LaserDisc listings on sites like Ebay. Not as many as VHS titles based on my casual browsing, but they're still available.\nPackaging and Artwork\nThe truth about vinyl records is that the perceived \"quality\" advantage it has over digital music doesn't have a basis in reality, but I feel many people collect them because the shape and size of vinyl records lends itself to amazing packaging and artwork. Similarly, there's just no comparison to how beautiful LDs can be as objects, even if you never play them. From this perspective, they are highly collectible.\nVHS tapes, on the other hand, are ugly and spartan. Of course, that's just my opinion, but in this category I just find no merit to them at all.\nCost\nOddly enough, as I was looking for prices on both VHS players and LD players, it seems that things more or less even out. As for the prices of the media, LDs seem quite a bit more expensive. However, I'd hazard to say that if the LD is in good condition it's probably worth the additional asking price.\nCultural and Historical Significance\nLet's be honest, if any film or show that exists on either LaserDisc or VHS is available on DVD or Blu-ray, you're far better off getting those more modern formats. If something only exists on LD or VHS, then LD seems like the better choice, and then VHS should be a last resort.\nHowever, there is the nostalgia factor with VHS, and in the case of LDs, there might be historical value to some of them. After all, for a long time the widescreen LaserDisc releases of the original Star Wars trilogy was the only untouched version of the original theatrical edits of those movies, untouched by George Lucas' \"improvements.\"\nThere's no winner here, other than LD being the better option for preservation if no newer media of that content exists.\nCommunity and Fandom\nYou'd think that LaserDisc would have a more intense fandom, but as a crude metric, consider that r/VHS has over 60K members, while r/LaserDisc has a hair under 10K members. There are, of course, forums and groups dedicated to both media all over the web, but the size of the VHS community did surprise me a little.\nI think perhaps a part of it has to do with just how many VHS titles there are, and there's an endless flood of rare or obscure finds in the VHS world, whereas LDs are more about quality over quantity. A media nerd can get lost in either rabbit hole, so it's not like I want to say one is better than the other, but the two types of collector communities sure feel like they have different \"flavors\" for lack of a better word.\nPersonally, I think I'll stick to collecting DVDs and Blu-rays, though I am a little envious of my friends who do collect LDs, until I come to my senses. Even collecting DVDs is starting to feel like media archeology, so while going further back than that feels daunting. Whichever you might choose to collect, any preservation is worth it, and as long as you enjoy your hobby there's probably no objectively correct answer as to which is the \"right\" medium to invest in."

      "text": "If last year was the year DVD broke through to the mainstream, this is the year it soared.\nIn the U.S., the Consumer Electronics Association named the DVD player \"the fastest growing consumer electronic product of all time.\"\nThis generation's home entertainment top toy has been around for only five years but it is expected to be in a third of U.S. households shortly, a feat that took the VCR twice as long to achieve.\nMonthly shipments of DVD players surpassed those of VCRs for the first time in September and are expected to reach 12.5 million units this year. In Canada, the Consumer Electronics Marketers says shipments of players were up 156 per cent in the first half of the year to 336,000 and that the industry forecasts 900,000 shipments to Canadian households by year's end.\nSales of DVD players are expected to surpass those of VCRs by 2004.\nOn the software front, elaborate collector's editions continue to sell well, a concept that was of interest only to elite videophiles back in the days of the laser disc. Entertainment Weekly has named The Godfather Collection (Paramount) and Citizen Kane (Warner) jointly as the No. 1 DVD of the year. Best-sellers included Disney's special edition of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, The Mummy Returns, Planet of the Apes, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider and Shrek.\nAnd what about 2002?

      "text": "The 1990s were a special time for creating some weird and downright bizarre films that pushed every boundary imaginable. It was a decade that started seeing a snowball effect in terms of the advancement of technology and techniques of special effects and visuals that helped provide an outlet for the filmmaker's wildest ideas. Before the time of big-budget franchises and endless sequels, studios were more likely to take risks both in terms of films with weird source material and the way the films were shot, which produced some incredible and extremely odd films.\nMany of these movies took weirdness to new heights in almost every aspect of cinema to create some intense, thought-provoking, and mind-bending film experiences. Movies like the shocking Freaked, which presented some grotesque characters and haunting sequences, and Harmony Korine\u2019s Gummo, which provides a unique and mostly horrifying snapshot of small-town America and its inhabitants. Many films throughout the 1990s wanted to confound and push limits with the audience, and even to this day, they can be appreciated for the incredible spectacles that they are.\n10 Arizona Dream (1993)\nStarring Johnny Depp And Jerry Lewis\nArizona Dream\n- Release Date\n- January 6, 1993\n- Runtime\n- 142 minutes\n- Director\n- Emir Kusturica\n- Writers\n- David Atkins\n- Producers\n- Claudie Ossard, Paul R. Gurian\nCast\n-\nFaye DunawayElaine Stalker\n-\nJerry LewisLeo Sweetie\n-\nAxel Blackmar\n-\nLili TaylorGrace Stalker\nArizona Dream follows Axel, a New York naturalist's assistant, as he travels to Arizona for his uncle's wedding and encounters an eccentric family. There, he meets two peculiar women, becomes romantically involved, and is drawn into the whimsical yet troubled dynamics of their lives.\nIn a film where anything seems possible at any given moment, it is almost impossible to get comfortable and settle into watching Emir Kusturica's Arizona Dream. Johnny Depp stars as the leading man, Axel, in this surrealist comedy that sees his character returning to his hometown in Arizona to help his uncle with his Cadillac dealership. That is pretty much where the normalcy ends, as he quickly becomes involved in a bizarre love triangle between a young woman (Lili Taylor) and an eccentric, old widow (Faye Dunaway).\nThe original edit for the film was approximately four hours long, which gives some indication that a lot of scenes were cut, or the film was crammed full of various sequences to hit the new runtime. Depp plays his usual quirky and nuanced self, which helps hold the film's plot together. It features many hallucinations, a woman wishing to kill herself to be reincarnated as a turtle, and a friendly game of Russian Roulette, which produces a film that is a dazzling cocktail of the macabre and the bizarre.\n9 Pi (1998)\nStarring Sean Gullette And Mark Margolis\nA cultured, black-and-white film about a brilliant genius and mathematician who is obsessed with number theory and finding underlying numerical patterns in the real world, on the surface, doesn't sound like one of the weirdest films of the 1990s. Darren Aronofsky\u2019s Pi sees Sean Gullette star as Max, the mathematician, with a plot that seamlessly blends paranoia and psychological horror to create an existential nightmare of a film.\nDirector Darren Aronofsky wong the Directing Award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.\nThe film was well received, earning several awards for both the direction and screenplay, with Aronofsky putting his signature touches all over the production. Pi has a number of disturbing visuals, and Gullette's performance as an intelligent man who is drawn into a paranoid and haunted state is truly gripping to watch. The real weirdness in the film is shown through the unraveling of his mind as he falls further down the rabbit hole due to his mathematical obsession, with claustrophobic and frightening cinematography that places the audience firmly in his mindset.\n8 Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas (1998)\nStarring Johnny Depp And Benicio Del Toro\nYour comment has not been saved\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas\n- Release Date\n- May 22, 1998\n- Runtime\n- 118 minutes\n- Director\n- Terry Gilliam\n- Writers\n- Tony Grisoni, Alex Cox, Terry Gilliam, Tod Davies\nCast\n-\nGary Busey\nFear and Loathing in Las Vegas is a 1998 film directed by Terry Gilliam, based on Hunter S. Thompson's novel. The movie stars Johnny Depp as Raoul Duke and Benicio Del Toro as Dr. Gonzo, who embark on a chaotic and drug-fueled journey through Las Vegas. The film explores themes of excess, hedonism, and the American Dream, showcasing a surreal and psychedelic portrayal of the 1970s counterculture.\n- Main Genre\n- Adventure\nBased on legendary 'gonzo' journalist Hunter S. Thompson\u2019s novel Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, the film stars Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro as the oddball duo of Raoul Duke and Dr. Gonzo. The pair take a drink and drug-fueled trip through Las Vegas, encountering bizarre adventures and crazy situations, abandoning their initial journalistic intentions to instead dive head first into an LSD-laced journey through all that Vegas has to offer. In one of Depp's most acclaimed and celebrated roles, he and del Toro share a palpable camaraderie that only embraces and exacerbates the madness shown on screen.\nFear is a double-edged sword, with some viewers following the pair headfirst into the insanity and depravity, with others holding back and looking at it through sober eyes. Either way, the weirdness of the film is dialed all the way up and elevated by the brilliant, larger-than-life performances of the leading men. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas has stood the test of time, with scenes such as Duke, high on ultra-purified acid, hallucinating that the hotel clerk is a moray eel entering popular culture and making it one of the most iconic, hallucinatory experiences in modern cinema.\n7 Lost Highway (1997)\nStarring Bill Pullman And Patricia Arquette\nYour comment has not been saved\nLost Highway\n- Release Date\n- January 15, 1997\n- Runtime\n- 134 minutes\n- Director\n- David Lynch\n- Writers\n- David Lynch, Barry Gifford\nCast\n-\nBill Pullman\nLost Highway is a psychological thriller directed by David Lynch. Released in 1997, the film stars Bill Pullman as Fred Madison, a jazz saxophonist entangled in a complex mystery involving his wife and a parallel existence. The narrative combines elements of surrealism and noir, weaving a story that challenges perceptions of identity and reality. Patricia Arquette co-stars, and the enigmatic plot unfolds through Lynch's signature atmospheric and stylistic approach.\n- Main Genre\n- Drama\nIn one of David Lynch's most surreal and intriguing films, Lost Highway sees Bill Pullman play jazz musician Fred Madison, who is accused of brutally murdering his wife. In the usual 'Lynchian' style, the film has his signature use of tense atmosphere and eerie performances that leave the audience unsure of who or what to trust. The film is told in a nonlinear fashion, which helps elevate the tension and creates moments where the audience knows more than the characters, which creates many unique moments of weirdness and suspense.\nThe film's plot is incredibly abstract, seeing Bill being convicted of the murder before suddenly vanishing and being replaced by a young mechanic who is now leading a totally different life. It has many layers of complexity through the changing characters, the disjointed narrative, and the intertwining plotlines that make it a bizarre and mind-bending experience. Lost Highway is an explosion of sex, murder, and nightmarish fantasies that defy logical interpretation from the viewer, which adds to the overall madness of the film.\n6 Jacob's Ladder (1990)\nStarring Tim Robbins And Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a\nYour comment has not been saved\nJacob's Ladder\n- Release Date\n- November 2, 1990\n- Runtime\n- 113 minutes\n- Director\n- Adrian Lyne\n- Writers\n- Bruce Joel Rubin\nCast\n-\nDanny Aiello\nJacob's Ladder is a horror mystery centering on a mourning father and scarred Vietnam War vet named Jacob that is dealing with dissociation. After his child dies, Jacob struggles to separate reality from his delusions. Jacob's Ladder stars Tim Robbins alongside Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a, Danny Aiello, Matt Craven, and Jason Alexander.\n- Main Genre\n- Horror\nIn a film that is both haunting and strange, Jacob's Ladder follows the story of Vietnam veteran Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins), a modern-day postal worker who begins to have bizarre and terrifying visions from his old military days. The visions are so lucid and twisted that he begins to question the reality he now lives in, unsure whether to trust his life, his dreams, or his memories. The plot of the film sees Jacob descend into a psychological meltdown of paranoia and confusion as some of his old platoon comrades reveal they are also dealing with the same issues.\nRobbins' performance as a man on the edge who gets abducted, abused, and tortured is incredibly authentic, and he brings a horrifying realism to the hellish sequences. Several scenes, such as when he is taken into hospital, wheeled past deformed and nightmarish characters before being strapped down and injected through the forehead, are incredibly graphic and disturbing. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, with the storyline, pacing, and acting performances all creating a truly weird masterpiece.\n5 Being John Malkovich (1999)\nStarring John Cusack And John Malkovich\nYour comment has not been saved\nBeing John Malkovich\n- Release Date\n- October 29, 1999\n- Runtime\n- 113 minutes\n- Director\n- Spike Jonze\n- Producers\n- Charlie Kaufman, Michael Kuhn, Michael Stipe, Sandy Stern, Steve Golin\nCast\n-\nJohn CusackCraig Schwartz\n-\nJohn MalkovichJohn Horatio Malkovich\nBeing John Malkovich: This film follows the story of an unsuccessful puppeteer named Craig who discovers a portal that leads into the mind of actor John Malkovich. The phenomenon soon entices others to explore the bizarre and controlling world of inhabiting another person's consciousness.\nIn potentially one of the most original and perfectly crafted films of the entire decade, Spike Jonze\u2019s Being John Malkovich is almost the epitome of a bizarre theatrical premise. The film is about struggling puppeteer Craig (John Cusack), who discovers a hidden portal that leads into John Malkovich's mind (and body), giving him the chance to experience the life Malkovich lives as a successful movie star. While the story is bizarre enough, the earnest performances given by the entire cast provide a genuine layer of realism that makes it equal parts admirable and unsettling.\n|\nThe 10 Weirdest Films From The 1990s On This List: |\nIMDb Rating: |\n|---|---|\n|\nArizona Dream (1993) |\n7.2/10 |\n|\nPi (1998) |\n7.3/10 |\n|\nFear & Loathing in Las Vegas (1998) |\n7.5/10 |\n|\nLost Highway (1997) |\n7.6/10 |\n|\nJacob's Ladder (1990) |\n7.4/10 |\n|\nBeing John Malkovich (1999) |\n7.7/10 |\n|\nFreaked (1993) |\n6.4/10 |\n|\nBad Boy Bubby (1993) |\n7.3/10 |\n|\nGummo (1997) |\n6.6/10 |\n|\nNaked Lunch (1991) |\n6.9/10 |\nBeing John Malkovich was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Director, Original Screenplay, and Actress, making it one of the most successful bizarre films produced in the '90s. The critical acclaim it received is a testament to the incredibly unique and strange premise that is full of twists, paradoxes, and sinister undertones. Malkovich gives a one-of-a-kind performance, forced to play himself, and also surreal variations of his own character in an expert depiction of self-parody and loss of identity.\n4 Freaked (1993)\nStarring Alex Winter And Randy Quaid\nYour comment has not been saved\nFreaked is a satirical comedy-horror film directed by Tom Stern and Alex Winter. The story revolves around a former child star, played by Alex Winter, who becomes the unwilling center of a bizarre freak show after being transformed by a toxic chemical. The film features a blend of absurd humor and grotesque imagery, with supporting appearances by Randy Quaid, Brooke Shields, and William Sadler.\n- Studio(s)\n- Tommy, Chiodo Bros. Productions\n- Main Genre\n- Comedy\nTurning into a modern-day cult classic, Freaked sees Alex Winter play former child star Ricky Coogin, who travels to South America to endorse and promote a fertilizer called 'Zygote 24'. Strange from minute one, things descend further into insanity when Ricky and his friends Ernie and Julia attend a local freakshow that sees a mad scientist transform the three into hideous, deformed oddities. Freaked's cast of bizarre mutated characters and comedic scenarios make it one of the strangest black comedies of the decade.\nThe freakshow sees a collection of characters like Ortiz the Dog Boy, a giant arthropod Worm, a literal anthropomorphic cow Cowboy, the Bearded Lady, and Sockhead, all of which sound as disturbing as they appear on screen. In a film that was deemed too weird for previous studio executives after a series of poorly rated screenings, the film failed to gain widespread distribution. It's only in recent years that a true appreciation was gained for the film's offbeat humor and grotesque cast of characters that make it an underrated gem of weird 90s cinema.\n3 Bad Boy Bubby (1993)\nStarring Nicholas Hope And Ralph Cotterill\nYour comment has not been saved\nBad Boy Bubby\n- Release Date\n- September 1, 1993\n- Runtime\n- 114 minutes\n- Director\n- Rolf de Heer\n- Producers\n- Domenico Procacci\nCast\n-\nNicholas HopeBubby\n-\nRalph CotterillPop\n-\nClaire BenitoMum\n-\nSyd BrisbaneYobbo\nBad Boy Bubby follows the life of a man kept isolated by his mother for thirty years, believing the outside world to be toxic. Upon encountering his estranged father, Bubby is thrust into this unfamiliar world, exploring its complexities and unusual aspects as he adapts and navigates his new reality.\nWhile other strange films in the '90s generally had some comedic elements, like Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, or surreal sequences that still felt based in reality, like Arizona Dream, Bad Boy Bubby is a film that takes a different turn. It follows the story of Bubby, a mentally challenged man who has been held captive in his house by a mother who is cruel, vindictive, and abusive. It goes on to reveal his journey after escaping the home and his confusing and disturbing journey of self-discovery.\nThe film's bizarreness is grounded and amplified by its seeming authenticity, a brutal and unflinching look at the underbelly of a horrific world, and one of the most original films that has ever come out of Australian cinema.\nThe film is deeply challenging and unsettling from start to finish, with little pause for breaks in the perversion. Bubby's mother regularly forces the two to engage in incestuous sex, and there are multiple instances of animal abuse, with Bubby killing his pet cat by wrapping it in cling film. The film's bizarreness is grounded and amplified by its seeming authenticity, a brutal and unflinching look at the underbelly of a horrific world, and one of the most original films that has ever come out of Australian cinema.\n2 Gummo (1997)\nStarring Linda Manz And Max Perlich\nYour comment has not been saved\nGummo\n- Release Date\n- October 17, 1997\n- Runtime\n- 89 minutes\n- Director\n- Harmony Korine\n- Producers\n- Cary Woods, Ruth Vitale\nCast\n-\nJacob ReynoldsSol\n-\nLinda ManzSolomon's Mother\nGummo depicts the lives of teenagers Solomon and Tummler in Xenia, Ohio, a town struggling to recover from a devastating tornado in the 1970s. The film explores their aimlessness and the bleakness of their environment, providing a glimpse into the residual impact of disaster on a community.\nSimilar in tone to Bad Boy Bubby, Harmony Korine\u2019s Gummo is a series of incredibly raw and strange vignettes that show the lives of residents in a small Midwestern town that was decimated by a tornado. The narrative is loose and disjointed, shot on a low budget in a documentary-style format, which makes it feel that much more gritty and genuine. It mainly follows a young boy named Solomon, who narrates much of the film, and other strange characters, such as a mute adolescent known as Bunny Boy.\nDirector Harmony Korine approached local people in her hometown of Nashville, Tennessee, to see if they would appear in the film or use their homes for shooting to add a layer of authenticity to the film.\nAs well as the main scenes, which provide a raw and unsettling look at the poverty-stricken American subculture, there are a number of more random shots that are interspersed throughout the film. These sequences include a man offering his disabled sister for sex, Solomon having dinner in a dirty bath, and a drunk man making sexual advances towards a male person of short stature. While other movies may focus on bizarre, paranormal visions and outlandish premises, Gummo takes what is truly weird and strips it to the bare essentials, creating a horrifyingly realistic film that is impossible to look away from.\n1 Naked Lunch (1991)\nStarring Peter Weller And Judy Davis\nYour comment has not been saved\nNaked Lunch\n- Release Date\n- December 27, 1991\n- Runtime\n- 115 Minutes\n- Director\n- David Cronenberg\n- Writers\n- William S. Burroughs, David Cronenberg\nCast\n-\nPeter Weller\n-\nJudy Davis\n- Main Genre\n- Drama\nAn impossibly weird film adapted from William S. Burroughs\u2019 1959 novel, David Cronenberg\u2019s Naked Lunch follows an exterminator, Lee (Peter Weller), whose wife begins taking his insecticides to use as a recreational drug. Lee is then arrested and begins hallucinating due to his own exposure to the chemicals, where he believes he is a secret agent and is tasked to kill his wife by his boss, a giant talking beetle. It is an incredibly strange story, filled with paranoia, drugs, and sexual misadventures.\nWeller performs his role with a master stroke of nuanced charm and subtle madness that helps contrast with the most surreal and fever-dream visuals. The whole plot is wonderfully absurd, with genuinely compelling performances and the perfect balance of nightmarish scenes with bizarre imagery that create a strange, haunting film that never lets up. Naked Lunch has weirdness running through its core and in every aspect of the film, making it not just one of the strangest films of the '90s but one of the weirdest films of all time.\nYour comment has not been saved"
