  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 None Accelerating AI infrastructure spending by hyperscalers and governments is a good indicator that GPU demand will remain high.\n\u2022 None On the surface, Nvidia appears to be the chip company that's best positioned to benefit from rising AI infrastructure spending.\n\u2022 None The growing demand for AI training and inference also bodes well for high bandwidth memory specialists like Micron.\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Micron Technology \u203a\n\nOn Wednesday, semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) will release its second-quarter earnings report.\n\nBetween the advent of DeepSeek, shifting U.S. trade policies anchored by President Donald Trump's tariff agenda, and a fluid situation regarding its business in China, this has been the most challenging year of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution yet for Nvidia. Despite the noise, however, recent developments suggest the AI chip behemoth remains firmly on track.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nWhile Wall Street's attention will be focused on Nvidia's results, savvy investors may want to look elsewhere in the semiconductor space for potentially seismic stock moves next week. In particular, Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) is positioned to benefit handsomely if Nvidia delivers upbeat results, given that its mission-critical solutions are also part of the AI supply chain.\n\nLet's discuss why Micron stock could skyrocket after Nvidia's Q2 report, and assess whether now would be a good time to scoop up shares.\n\nWhy Nvidia is going to crush its Q2 earnings\n\nOver the past month, investors have gotten some previews of what to expect from Nvidia's upcoming earnings report. The hyperscalers -- Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta Platforms -- continue to make record-breaking capital expenditures to build out new data centers and cloud computing infrastructure.\n\nMuch of this spending is directed toward infrastructure that can support AI -- including networking equipment, servers, and, most importantly, graphics processing units (GPUs), which remain Nvidia's core products.\n\nAnother bullish signal came from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. The world's largest third-party chip foundry recently reported a blowout quarter with $30 billion in revenue. Because TSMC is Nvidia's key foundry partner, Taiwan Semi's results can effectively be taken as a proxy for demand for Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nWhen you combine robust AI spending from the hyperscalers with surging order flow at the top AI chip manufacturer, it points to one conclusion: Nvidia's Q2 earnings report is likely to deliver the kind of growth that will please even the most aggressive investors.\n\nMicron is an under-the-radar way to invest in the AI infrastructure boom\n\nWhile much of Nvidia's sales growth is being driven by hyperscalers' insatiable demand for GPUs, those chips don't operate in isolation. High-performance memory chips are also essential to handle the massive data loads generated by AI models -- and this is where Micron plays a pivotal role.\n\nIn addition, large-scale initiatives such as Project Stargate highlight just how expansive those data center buildouts have become. From cloud services providers to sovereign government AI projects, data centers are being designed with next-generation GPUs, advanced networking, and high-performance memory and storage.\n\nAnother important trend is the broadening scope of AI investments. The first wave focused on acquiring GPUs with which to train large language models (LLMs). The next wave is about deploying AI software into enterprise workflows. This shift requires more than just additional training power -- it demands hardware with more robust inference capabilities.\n\nInference workloads are memory-intensive, as they involve the processing of enormous volumes of real-time data. Micron's DRAM and high bandwidth memory (HBM) solutions are both designed to support these protocols, positioning the company as a critical player in the downstream adoption of AI.\n\nTaken together, the surging capex from hyperscalers, megaprojects like Stargate, and the rise of AI inference workloads converge to show that demand for computing power is still rising. While GPUs may be the headline act of the AI infrastructure show, HBM is a key player backstage, ensuring that the show goes on.\n\nFor this reason, Micron will continue to benefit from the world's massive AI infrastructure outlays -- quietly capturing incremental revenue each time money is spent on GPUs, servers, and data center upgrades. As Nvidia's sales scale up further, Micron is positioned to scale up right alongside it -- and its shares could easily witness some pronounced buying on the heels of a positive report from Nvidia next week.\n\nMicron is trading at deep value levels compared to others in the semiconductor landscape\n\nAs the chart below illustrates, chip giants like Nvidia, Broadcom, TSM, and Advanced Micro Devices all trade at far richer valuations than Micron. That's because investors clearly see how surging demand for GPUs and networking equipment drives revenue and profits for these businesses.\n\nWhere I think investors are missing the mark is in how they view Micron. It's true that the high bandwidth memory business is much different from the GPU business. GPUs function as the backbone of generative AI development, and each company's chips have unique value propositions. HBM is more commoditized.\n\nThat said, what investors may be overlooking is that each new dollar spent on AI GPUs designed by Nvidia and AMD and manufactured by TSMC multiplies the need for complementary solutions like high bandwidth memory to keep those accelerators running at maximum efficiency. Moreover, when you consider that Micron's HBM products are already integrated with Nvidia's flagship GPUs, it positions the company as a direct beneficiary of AI infrastructure spending.\n\nNevertheless, the valuation gap is striking. Micron's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio sits well below those of its tangential peers, suggesting the market has yet to fully recognize the importance HBM will play in the next phase of AI growth. That's why I see Micron as an underappreciated opportunity when valued against the most obvious chip beneficiaries at the moment.\n\nWhile the stock could exhibit some volatility in the short term, I don't recommend trying to \"market time\" your entry points. Instead, a more reliable strategy for investors to use is dollar-cost averaging -- gradually building a position in a stock by purchasing set dollar amounts at regular intervals.\n\nUsing this approach with Micron will allow investors to buy the stock at different prices while riding the long-term secular tailwinds of the AI infrastructure narrative.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Micron Technology right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Micron Technology, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Micron Technology wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Netflix made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $649,657!* Or when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $1,090,993!*\n\nNow, it\u2019s worth noting Stock Advisor\u2019s total average return is 1,057% \u2014 a market-crushing outperformance compared to 185% for the S&P 500.

      "text": "DeepSeek burst onto the scene in early 2025. The Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up's open-source large language model (LLM) relies on a technique known as interference-time computing. This approach only activates the most relevant portions of the model to perform each query, which saves time and money.\nThe private Chinese company was formed in July 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, who created it with money from his hedge fund. It released its latest AI model in mid-January 2025; the model reportedly only cost about $6 million to make, a fraction of the roughly $1 trillion leading U.S. AI companies like OpenAI, Alphabet's (GOOG 2.98%) (GOOGL 3.1%) Google, and Meta Platforms (META 2.04%) plan to plow into AI infrastructure in the coming years. If DeepSeek can truly build AI models for such a low investment -- because it requires significantly fewer specialized semiconductors from companies like Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%) -- it could cause a massive disruption to the AI industry in the coming years.\nArtificial Intelligence\nGiven the company's quick rise to fame, many investors wonder how to get in on this potentially game-changing AI company. Here's everything you need to know about how to invest in the AI sector and DeepSeek before its initial public offering (IPO).\nIs DeepSeek publicly traded?\nIs DeepSeek publicly traded?\nDeepSeek was not a publicly traded company as of early 2025. Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, founded and run by DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng, owns DeepSeek and is the sole funder of the AI start-up.\nIPO\nWhen will DeepSeek IPO?\nDeepSeek didn't have an IPO on the calendar as of early 2025. The AI start-up likely won't go public anytime soon. The company is still a very early stage start-up that hasn't yet started to commercialize its latest AI model, so it could be quite some time before the company goes public.\nIPO\nHow to buy\nHow to buy DeepSeek stock\nSince DeepSeek hasn't completed an IPO, you can't buy shares of the AI stock in your brokerage account. As of early 2025, you also couldn't buy pre-IPO shares of the company because it's wholly owned and funded by High-Flyer, a Chinese hedge fund.\nWhile you can't currently invest directly in DeepSeek, you can invest in the AI trends driving its popularity through another leading AI company. Three DeepSeek alternatives to consider investing in are:\nNvidia\nNvidia is a leader in developing the advanced chips required for developing AI training models and applications. DeepSeek uses Nvidia's chips; its founder, Liang Wenfeng, reportedly stockpiled them before the U.S. banned the export of AI chips to China. It reportedly used Nvidia's cheaper H800 chips instead of the more expensive A100 to train its latest model. However, many in the tech sector believe DeepSeek is significantly understating the number of chips it used (and the type) due to the export ban. But even if DeepSeek isn't understating its chip usage, its breakthrough could accelerate the usage of AI, which could still bode well for Nvidia.\nMicrosoft\nMicrosoft (MSFT 0.56%) is a leader in AI. The technology titan was an early investor in OpenAI, the developer of the breakthrough ChatGPT chatbot. The company has been integrating AI into all aspects of its business to help users improve productivity. While DeepSeek is a potential rival to ChatGPT, Microsoft still stands to benefit from its potential breakthrough in cost. It would make AI cheaper to implement, which could enable the technology company to make more money in the future.\nMeta Platforms\nMeta Platforms is investing heavily in AI. It announced plans to invest as much as $65 billion to expand its AI infrastructure in early 2025, days after DeepSeek unveiled its lower-cost breakthrough. That's an eye-popping 50% increase from the prior year. The company expects this massive investment to drive its core products and business in the coming years. Meta would benefit if DeepSeek's lower-cost approach proves to be a breakthrough because it would lower Meta's development costs.\nIt's easy to invest in one of these DeepSeek alternatives or another IPO in 2025. Here's a step-by-step guide to add them to your portfolio:\n- Step 1: Open your brokerage app: Log into your brokerage account where you handle your investments.\n- Step 2: Search for the stock: Enter the ticker or company name into the search bar to bring up the stock's trading page.\n- Step 3: Decide how many shares to buy: Consider your investment goals and how much of your portfolio you want to allocate to this stock.\n- Step 4: Select order type: Choose between a market order to buy at the current price or a limit order to specify the maximum price you're willing to pay.\n- Step 5: Submit your order: Confirm the details and submit your buy order.\n- Step 6: Review your purchase: Check your portfolio to ensure your order was filled as expected and adjust your investment strategy accordingly.\nIs it profitable?\nIs DeepSeek profitable?\nDeepSeek is a privately held AI start-up owned solely by a Chinese hedge fund, so there isn't currently any financial data available on the company.\nShould I invest?\nShould I invest in DeepSeek?\nYou can't currently invest in DeepSeek because it's a privately held company owned by Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer.\nHowever, if the company does complete an IPO, there are several factors you should consider before buying IPO stock in the company. A big one is whether the company is being completely transparent about the number and types of chips it's using to train its AI model. Many in the tech industry believe the company is understating the chips it's using due to an export ban on certain AI chips. It might cost more -- potentially significantly more -- to train its AI model than the $6 million figure initially reported in the media.\nInvestors also need to consider the risks of investing in Chinese companies. These risks include geopolitical issues (such as the export ban on certain AI chips), the potential for the lack of transparency in its finances, the greater possibility of fraud due to less oversight, security and privacy concerns, and other possible factors that could negatively affect an investment in the company.\nETFs\nETFs with exposure to DeepSeek\nYou can't currently use an exchange-traded fund (ETF) to gain passive exposure to DeepSeek because it's not a publicly traded company. However, you can use ETFs to invest broadly in trends like AI, robotics, and Chinese technology stocks. Some top options to consider include:\n- Invesco China Technology ETF (CQQQ 5.96%): This fund invests broadly in Chinese technology stocks. It owned around 150 companies in early 2025, led by top-holding Tencent (TCEHY 1.86%) at 9.7% of its net assets. The fund has a 0.65% ETF expense ratio.\n- Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ 2.86%): This AI ETF aims to invest in companies that should benefit from the increased usage and adoption of AI. The fund held around 45 stocks in early 2025, led by Nvidia (13% of its assets). The ETF had a 0.68% expense ratio.\n- iShares Future AI & Tech ETF (ARTY 1.79%): This fund focuses on AI innovators that are at the forefront of areas like generative AI, AI data and infrastructure, AI services, and AI software. The ETF held about 50 AI stocks in early 2025, including Nvidia as the fourth-largest holding at 4.4% of the fund's assets. It had a 0.47% expense ratio.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line\nThe bottom line on DeepSeek\nDeepSeek has sent shockwaves through the AI sector after unveiling its much cheaper approach to training AI models. While there are some questions about how much its model actually costs, the implications are significant. It could disrupt some AI leaders while potentially enhancing the use of the technology in the future. That makes DeepSeek a very interesting company to watch.\nFAQs\nInvesting in DeepSeek FAQs\nWhat company owns DeepSeek AI?\nChinese hedge fund High-Flyer owns DeepSeek. The hedge fund's founder, Liang Wenfeng, also founded DeepSeek.\nWhat is the best AI company to invest in?\nThere are many great AI technology companies. However, as DeepSeek's breakthrough shows, there's a high risk for disruption in the sector. Investors should consider investing in a basket of the top AI stocks, like industry leaders Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Alphabet, and others, to help protect their portfolio from the potential that an AI start-up could make today's top AI stock tomorrow's laggard.\nWhat is the ticker for DeepSeek?\nThere is no ticker for DeepSeek. The AI start-up is a privately held company owned and funded by Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, an entity founded and run by DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng.\nIs DeepSeek publicly traded?\nDeepSeek isn't a publicly traded company. It's a private AI start-up owned and funded by Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer.\nIs DeepSeek a threat to Nvidia?\nDeepSeek is a potential threat to Nvidia. While it doesn't develop AI chips, the company built its AI model on lower-cost chips. As a result, Nvidia might not be able to sell as many of its premium AI chips in the future if DeepSeek's novel approach becomes the new industry standard."

      "text": "What is dollar-cost averaging?\nBuying stocks can be stressful. Buy too soon and you risk regret if the price drops. But if you wait and the price goes up, you feel like you missed out on a deal. That's where dollar-cost averaging comes into play.\nDollar-cost averaging is a strategy that tries to minimize those risks by building your position over time. When you dollar-cost average, you invest equal dollar amounts in a security at regular intervals. Rather than attempting to time the market, you buy in at a range of different prices.\nLike with most investment strategies, dollar-cost averaging is not for everyone, and there are times it works better than others. But it can be a powerful tool for removing some of the emotional barriers to investing. Here's a look at how dollar-cost averaging works and the best ways to use the strategy.\nWhen you dollar-cost average, you break your investment into pieces and put a portion of your money into the stock market at equal time intervals instead of putting all of it into the market at once.\nFractional Shares\nFor example, say you have identified FoolishCorp. as an attractive investment and want to buy $10,000 worth of its stock. But you've noticed the stock price tends to move up and down a lot, and you are not sure if the price you'd pay now is the best you'll see or if it will drop in the days and weeks to come. Instead of buying $10,000 worth right now, you could instead buy $2,000 per month for five months.\nThe strategy doesn't have to be limited to one security or a fixed amount of time. In fact, those with 401(k) plans and other retirement accounts may already be dollar-cost averaging through those plans by buying a fixed amount of a number of mutual funds and stocks every payday regardless of whether the market is at an all-time high or in the middle of a sell-off.\nWhy it works\nWhy dollar-cost averaging works\nDollar-cost averaging works because it removes some of the emotional stress that comes with investing. By committing to a set schedule, you don't have to worry about whether a stock is about to move higher or lower.\nTo go back to the example of FoolishCorp., let's assume you buy $2,000 worth of its stock for five consecutive months. Let's also say that, on the days you buy, the stock is trading at $50, $40, $20, $40, and $50, respectively. Over the course of those five months, the stock price ended up where it started, but it took a wild ride in the meantime.\nHere's how the purchases would look:\n| Month | Investment Amount | Price per Share | Number of Shares Purchased |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| 1 | $2,000 | $50 | 40 |\n| 2 | $2,000 | $40 | 50 |\n| 3 | $2,000 | $20 | 100 |\n| 4 | $2,000 | $40 | 50 |\n| 5 | $2,000 | $50 | 40 |\n| Total | $10,000 | $35.71 (average) | 280 |\nNote that in this example, if you had bought the entire $10,000 stake on day one, you would have only gotten 200 shares. So, by dollar-cost averaging, you were able to buy more shares with your money. Obviously, that's not always the case. If the stock price goes straight up, you would get fewer shares.\nYou can use this strategy for any investment, whether it's a stock, mutual fund, or exchange-traded fund (ETF). Generally speaking, dollar-cost averaging works best in bear markets and with securities that have dramatic price swings up and down. It is those times, and those types of investments, where reducing investor anxiety and fear of missing out tend to be the most important.\nExchange-Traded Fund (ETF)\nIf you do dollar-cost average, beware of hindsight. It is easy to doubt yourself if you spend too much time looking backward. If a stock goes straight up from your starting point, clearly it would have been better to buy as much as possible on day one. Or, taking the FoolishCorp example, it would have been better to buy the full $10,000 in month three. But the whole point of this strategy is we have no way of knowing how a stock is going to move.\nIf you have a crystal ball, use it. But for the rest of us, dollar-cost averaging is a better strategy than trying to time the market.\nWhen's the best day to do it?\nWhen's the best day to dollar-cost average?\nThere are a lot of so-called investment experts who claim there are certain days to deploy money due to payroll schedules and mutual fund flows. Don't believe it. If there was a magical formula for picking the right day each month to buy stocks, we'd all just buy then and not have to figure out other strategies.\nHowever, when you dollar-cost average is important. Specifically, you must make a consistent plan and stick to it. A lot of the benefit of the strategy is that, by breaking the investment into chunks, you can avoid worrying over when to buy in and avoid trying to time the market. Therefore, it's important that, once you pick a date, you stick to it no matter what happens.\nFor example, say you commit to buy $1,000 worth of an index fund on the first day of every month. But, in month four, you notice that stocks have been up the whole week leading up to the first day of the month. It might be tempting to assume that a sell-off is inevitable any day, so you hold off buying on the first day of the month in the hope of getting a better price in the days that follow. If you do that, you eliminate a lot of the rationale behind trying dollar-cost averaging.\nThe downside\nWhat's the downside of dollar-cost averaging?\nThere are a few things to consider before dollar-cost averaging. For one, it's impossible to predict whether stock prices will go up or down on any particular day, week, or even year. But there is a century's worth of data showing us that markets do rise over time.\nIf you park most of your money out of the market and only buy in a bit at a time, you avoid short-term volatility. But that also means a portion of your cash is on the sidelines and not working to build your net worth.\nThat's a particularly big risk if you are focused on dividend stocks and other income-generating investments. Except in extreme cases, dividend payers continue distributions in good markets and bad. If you use dollar-cost averaging to slowly build a position in a dividend stock, you miss out on getting dividends on the portion of your cash you haven't yet invested.\nFinally, note that any investment strategy is only as good as the stocks you pick. Dollar-cost averaging can help ease apprehension and is better than trying to time the markets, but it is no substitute for finding quality companies to invest in.\nIs it for you?\nIs dollar-cost averaging right for you?\nDollar-cost averaging is beneficial because it can reduce investor anxiety, help avoid trying to time the market, and can provide a predictable, regimented way to continuously grow your nest egg. If that's of interest to you, there are a few simple steps to follow:\n- Decide how much money you want to invest. It could be a one-time windfall you want to put in the market or it could be a set amount you intend to contribute on a regular schedule indefinitely.\n- Decide how often you want to invest. With trading commissions all but gone, it can be daily, weekly, monthly, or any interval you want.\n- Decide how many periods you want to split the investment over. Again, it could be a few times, or it could be the start of a permanent routine.\n- Decide the dollar amount invested at each interval. If it's a lump sum, divide the amount by the number of periods. If it is an indefinite investment plan, budget how much you can reliably afford.\n- Stick with the plan, no matter what markets do on a particular day or week.\nThere is no one right way to invest. But if you're an investor looking to increase your net worth but worried you might be tempted to time the market, or you're dedicated to adding a little bit each month regardless of recent stock returns, dollar-cost averaging can be an effective way to build your portfolio."

      "text": "Over the past several weeks, companies across every industry have released financial earnings and operating results for the second calendar quarter of 2025. For many investors, all eyes were on big tech.\nSpending patterns from these behemoths don't just signal the health of the overall macroeconomic environment -- they also shed light on the most closely watched theme in the market: artificial intelligence (AI).\nWhile most of AI's power players have already reported, the ultimate industry bellwether, Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%), has yet to step up to the plate. The semiconductor giant is scheduled to announce results on Aug. 27, and expectations could not be higher.\nLet's explore how Nvidia stock typically reacts during earnings season, and assess whether now might be the time for investors to seize the opportunity.\nHow does Nvidia stock generally perform after earnings?\nThe chart below illustrates Nvidia's price action over the past three years, with purple \"E\" markers indicating earnings dates.\nWith just one exception, every earnings release has been followed by a surge in buying activity, underscoring the market's unrelenting appetite for Nvidia stock.\nThe lone outlier came earlier this year, when concerns about competition from Chinese models -- namely DeepSeek -- combined with uncertainty over President Donald Trump's new tariff agenda cast doubt on Nvidia's outlook. These worries fueled a narrative of caution that briefly interrupted the company's otherwise robust momentum.\nAs recent trends make clear, however, those fears have largely faded -- replaced by new investor enthusiasm. The broader takeaway is undeniable: Nvidia has been a standout winner over the last few years, with its share price climbing in lockstep with the rise of AI.\nWhat should investors be listening for on Nvidia's earnings call?\nDuring the AI boom, Nvidia's business has primarily been fueled by unprecedented demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) and CUDA software system. Despite rising competition in the GPU landscape from Advanced Micro Devices and the upcoming release of custom ASICs from Broadcom, I still see a number of compelling catalysts that could fuel long-term growth for Nvidia.\nChip demand from hyperscalers\nEarlier this year, investors learned that Meta Platforms and Alphabet plan to significantly expand their AI capital expenditure (capex) budgets. Meta made a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, while also launching a new initiative, dubbed Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL). Meanwhile, Alphabet continues to ramp up spending on servers and data center buildouts -- clear accelerating tailwinds for AI infrastructure. They are not alone, however. Amazon and Microsoft also maintain massive capex commitments, bringing the combined total among the four hyperscalers to an estimated $340 billion on AI infrastructure spending this year alone.\nSovereign AI\nShortly after President Trump's inauguration in January, leaders from Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank gathered in the Oval Office to unveil Project Stargate -- a landmark $500 billion initiative to build out AI infrastructure in the United States. Countries across the Middle East -- such as the United Arab Emirates and Kingdom of Saudi Arabia -- have launched their own Stargate-style projects, each with massive funding commitments. Nvidia's industry-leading chipsets and data center expertise serve as the AI backbone to bring these efforts to life.\nNew life in China\nFor much of 2025, China has been Nvidia's biggest obstacle. A newly structured agreement with the U.S. government now allows Nvidia to reenter this critical market, with the company remitting 15% of its Chinese sales back to Washington. While the arrangement may appear costly upon first glance, Nvidia's superior pricing power in the chip market positions the company to absorb this expense with minimal impact on profit margins. Nvidia's ability to offset these fees ensures that doing business in China remains a net positive for shareholders.\nEmerging applications\nBeyond infrastructure, a new wave of opportunities is emerging as more advanced AI use cases take shape. For example, Tesla's push to scale its robotaxi business -- and its decision to replace the in-house Dojo system with one powered by Nvidia -- underscores the company's critical role in more sophisticated applications such as autonomous vehicles. Meanwhile, Tesla and other developers are racing to commercialize AI-powered robotics applications -- a market that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thinks could be worth multiple trillions in the long run. Looking even further ahead, the rising momentum around quantum computing points to the need for next-generation hardware and software -- inspiring Nvidia to continue innovating in order to remain at the forefront of the next chapter of the AI story.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy before Aug. 27?\nThe chart below tracks Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple throughout the AI revolution. While the company's valuation has expanded recently, shares still trade at a discount compared to prior forward earnings peaks.\nThis suggests that much of the growth from the catalysts discussed above is not yet fully priced into Nvidia's stock price. In other words, there could be meaningful valuation upside ahead as these opportunities scale and contribute to Nvidia's growth.\nWhile Nvidia's surge over the last three years has been generational, the company's long-term tailwinds give reason to believe that the rally is far from over.\nFor investors, the focus should not be on trying to time the perfect entry point. Instead, buying the stock at different price points over time -- a strategy known as dollar-cost averaging (DCA) -- remains an effective approach to building a position in one of the defining winners of the AI era."

      "text": "Along with training, AI inference is one of the primary functions that generative artificial intelligence models perform.\nLarge language models like ChatGPT and image generator tools work by making inferences from user prompts, based on information they already have.\nWhat is AI inference?\nWhat is AI inference?\nAI inference describes the process of a machine learning model making deductions based on information it's been trained on.\nInference follows the training stage to make an AI model work. It happens when you give an AI model like ChatGPT a prompt and get a response. The response is based both on the data that the AI model has been trained on, and on its ability to infer answers.\nWhy is AI inference important?\nWhy is AI inference important?\nThe two components that differentiate AI models from one another are training and inference. The two work closely together. Training, consisting of a set of billions or even trillions of parameters, directly influences a model's ability to infer. The better trained it is, the better its inferences will be.\nTraining is key in determining a model's strength, but inference ultimately determines its accuracy. Although the strength of the training dataset influences inference, a model is not worth much without the model to infer.\nInference enables self-driving cars to drive safely on roads they've never been on before, and allows large language models to answer questions they haven't seen before. Without inference, AI models wouldn't be able to do new things.\nMost of an AI model's life is spent in inferencing since training takes place before a model is ready to be used.\nGenerative AI\nHow to evaluate\nHow to evaluate AI inference\nRunning AI models is typically expensive, as it requires a lot of power to perform the millions of computations necessary for large language models like ChatGPT to work.\nAs much as 90% of a model's time can be spent on inference, which continues after the model is deployed; training is a one-time cost. So, in active models, training tends to be less important than inference.\nThere are several ways to evaluate the inferential abilities of large language models. Speed is a key differentiator between models, and models with better inferencing capabilities will result in faster response times.\nCost is another area worth evaluating, especially if you're paying to run the model, and there are tools and techniques that can help reduce the cost of running expensive AI models. Arm's (ARM 3.55%) CPU architecture, used in almost every smartphone, is being adopted for AI because of its efficiency.\nAccuracy is also a valuable way of judging inference capabilities, and inference and training both determine the accuracy of a model. Accuracy can be easily tested by posing the same questions to different models and seeing which ones give the best answers and make the fewest mistakes.\nRelated investing topics\nHow AI inference works\nHow it works\nOne example of AI inference is a self-driving car that can recognize signage on the road -- even if it hasn't been on that road.\nInference also gives AI predictive abilities, so it can predict what you're about to type or make forecasts from a given set of information.\nAs inference enables humans to make decisions and judgments, inference does the same thing for artificial intelligence.\nAs models get more powerful, the inference is likely to become even better, making progress toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). AGI will only be reached when inference capabilities that can match those of humans."

      "text": "Motivated to ensure that the United States remains a global leader in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), OpenAI and SoftBank have created a new company, the Stargate Project, which will develop infrastructure to support AI growth.\nOverview\nOverview of the project\nAnnounced in January 2025, Stargate seeks to invest $500 billion through 2029 in the development of data centers and other infrastructure in the United States that will support OpenAI. In addition to OpenAI and SoftBank, software and cloud computing specialist Oracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) and MGX, a technology fund located in the United Arab Emirates, will provide the initial round of equity funding.\nIn response to other nations' inquiries about developing similar programs, OpenAI announced OpenAI for Countries in May 2025. From helping governments build data center capacity to providing a customized ChatGPT to citizens, OpenAI for Countries will collaborate with the U.S. government to support AI growth abroad. For the first phase of this initiative, OpenAI aims to help 10 countries or regions with their projects.\nWhy it's important\nThe importance of Stargate\nJust as people who flip kitchen lights on don't often think of the power plants where the electricity is produced, people using ChatGPT aren't likely to consider what happens between making their requests of the AI tool and then receiving their responses. In short, there's a significant amount of computing taking place -- computing that requires copious amounts of electricity.\nOf course, it's not only OpenAI that's cognizant of the high power demands that AI is placing on the electrical grid. Leading AI providers like Meta Platforms (META 2.04%), Microsoft (MSFT 0.56%), Amazon (AMZN 3.12%), and Alphabet (GOOG 2.98%) are investing billions of dollars in developing data centers to meet the computing demands of AI.\nFurther insights\nFurther insights into Stargate\nIn addition to SoftBank and Oracle, there are some other well-known AI names that are helping to develop Stargate with OpenAI: Arm Holdings (ARM 3.55%) and Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%). Providing essential technology for the first data center from the project that will be located in Texas, Arm will supply central processing units (CPUs) along with Nvidia, which will also contribute its Spectrum-X, a networking platform uniquely suited for the intense computing workloads that AI demands.\nMicrosoft is yet another partner helping OpenAI with Stargate. The collaboration is hardly a surprise since the two companies first began working together in 2019, and they have a contract that extends to 2030. While OpenAI operates on Microsoft's Azure platform, Microsoft is also a major investor in OpenAI.\nRelated investing topics\nStargate in action\nStargate in action\nPlanning on deploying $500 billion to develop data centers, OpenAI certainly has lofty ambitions with Stargate. Smart -- and experienced -- investors know full well, however, that a company's articulation of lofty goals doesn't guarantee that they will come to fruition. While OpenAI announced Stargate in early 2025, it ran into a snag just a few months later when SoftBank, which planned on investing $100 billion in the project, encountered some difficulties courting investors due to questions about tariffs and other concerns.\nTime will tell if OpenAI succeeds in growing its data center infrastructure, but one thing that seems fairly certain is that data center growth among the AI industry writ large is poised to grow considerably -- a boon for companies like Nvidia that provide the hardware necessary for the development of data centers."

      "text": "Secular trends are changes in the economy or business climate that develop over long periods of time. Trends that are secular transcend business cycles to reflect the overall success or decline of an industry, or, in some instances, several related industries. Secular growth trends create new dominant companies, while secular declines cause once-dominant companies to lose significant value or even cease to exist altogether.\nUnderstanding secular trends\nUnderstanding secular trends\nSecular trends are driven by fundamental changes in the economy such as evolving consumer behavior, demographic changes, or development of new technology. As a new area of growth picks up steam, investment (from individuals, companies, and even government entities) tends to flow into the industries benefiting from the secular trend, which adds further momentum.\nA secular trend is not a cyclical business trend (like manufacturing activity, for example). However, economic recessions may cause a temporary pause in the advance of stocks that participate in a secular trend's development. The stocks often recover losses quickly and continue growing far sooner than stocks in other sectors of the economy.\nFor instance, cloud computing was an emerging secular trend of the 2010s and is expected to rapidly expand throughout the 2020s. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a brief crash in many cloud stocks, but cloud computing adoption and development actually accelerated, even during the pandemic-fueled recession that ensued.\nIn contrast, secular decline is when an industry's support slowly dwindles away. This can play out over many decades. The U.S. tobacco industry is a prime example of an industry in secular decline since cigarette smoking in the U.S. has become much less popular over the past few decades.\nSecular market explained\nSecular market explained\nThe best companies for investors are helped by secular growth trends. Even with the cyclical nature of many businesses, companies in secularly growing industries are well-positioned to thrive over the long term. Secular trends occur over many years or even decades, while economic cycles are generally shorter.\nCompanies that benefit from secular growth trends are best able to retain value regardless of the current state of the economy. Secular growth trends enable the stocks of those companies to quickly continue gaining value following periods of market uncertainty (known as a secular bull market). As the saying goes, ultra-long-term winning stocks continue to make higher highs as well as higher lows during market downturns.\nIndustries in secular decline will often feature stocks focused on returning cash to shareholders as revenue growth tapers off and then starts to slowly decrease. Eventually, these stocks may start to slowly decline in value over time -- a secular bear market.\nSecular growth stock examples\nSecular growth stock examples\nThe growth of computer technology is an example of a secular trend that has lasted for a couple of decades already and is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. E-commerce is another newer trend that looks like it could continue for many years.\nHere are two examples of companies that are benefiting from secular growth:\nApple\nFollowing the multi-decade secular growth of computing technology, mobile devices in the 2000s emerged as a product of the latest technology advances. Apple (AAPL 1.21%) has significantly benefited from this secular growth trend, starting with sales of the iPod music player in 2003. Apple dominates the technology industry as one of the world's most valuable companies and now has a suite of mobile devices, including the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch.\nAlthough sales of mobile devices have slowed in recent years, Apple is still benefiting from the secular growth trend by steadily increasing the number of its devices in service around the globe. With more than 1.65 billion Apple products in use at the beginning of 2021, the company is leveraging this massive installed user base to foster adoption of software-based services within its ecosystem. Apple is using the secular trend of rising digital mobility to expand its music streaming service, video game offerings, and digital payments processing, among other services.\nCloud Computing\nAmazon\nThe rise of Amazon (AMZN 3.12%) has occurred in tandem with the rise of e-commerce, and the company itself has accelerated the growth of the e-commerce secular trend. Amazon began as a dot-com company in the 1990s and today connects millions of shoppers to almost every product imaginable.\nAs Amazon benefited from the secular growth trend of e-commerce, it also developed expertise in data centers, which are enabled by cloud computing and required for the company's online shopping experience. Cloud computing is an extension of the computer technology secular growth trend, and, with Amazon leveraging its cloud computing expertise to form Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company is benefiting from two secular trends at the same time. AWS, not retail sales, is responsible for the vast majority of Amazon's profitability -- a development that is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.\nRelated investing topics\nUsing secular growth trends to your advantage\nAll secular growth trends eventually end, and, along the way, they can slow down or accelerate depending on the state of the economy. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the secular growth of e-commerce and cloud computing. Investors who want to buy and hold quality companies should pay attention to secular growth trends and make their stock purchases accordingly."

      "text": "Earnings season is upon us! Last week, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM 2.58%) reported financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2024. Let's explore the Q2 report from TSMC (as the company is known for short).\nFrom there, I'll dive into some broader industry trends to help explain why the company's latest quarterly result was so impressive, and more importantly, how it is set up for even further growth in the long run.\nTSMC just posted a monster quarter all around, and...\nTSMC is a major supplier for leading chip companies such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom. Moreover, the company's reach extends beyond traditional semiconductor businesses since it has also forged strong relationships with tech giants Apple and Amazon.\nDuring the second quarter, the company generated more than $30 billion in sales, thanks in large part to continued robust demand for the company's 5nm and 3nm chip nodes.\nWhile the company's revenue grew 44% year over year, steadily improving gross margins and a disciplined cost structure fueled even more acceleration for its bottom line. During the second quarter, earnings per share (EPS) were roughly $2.50 -- representing nearly 61% growth year over year.\n... forecasts suggest much more growth is in store\nIn 2025 alone, cloud hyperscalers Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, in combination with social media empire Meta Platforms, are expected to collectively have up to $330 billion in capital expenditures (capex). Taking this one step further, management consulting firm McKinsey & Company forecasts that investments in AI infrastructure -- which include data center buildouts and chips -- are expected to reach $6.7 trillion by next decade.\nWith TSMC producing more than 40% revenue growth with an estimated 60% of the global chip foundry market, it appears well-positioned to capitalize on these secular tailwinds and acquire even more market share over the next several years.\nWhat does TSMC's earnings report tell us about AI demand?\nTo me, the simplest explanation of the blowout earnings report is that AI demand is not only strong, but it's also accelerating. While growth will fluctuate from quarter to quarter, I don't really see TSMC as a cyclical semiconductor stock at this point.\nRather, the capex and infrastructure trends referenced above underscore how crucial AI growth is to the global economy at this point. The chipmaker's leading foundry services across edge devices, high-performance computing (HPC), and AI accelerators are at the center of this secular evolution.\nIs Taiwan Semiconductor stock a buy right now?\nDespite the company's jaw-dropping growth and robust outlook, TSMC trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of just 24. Not only is this much lower than historical levels, but it is also a meaningful discount to many other leading chip stocks, too.\nWhile skeptics may cite the cyclicality of the chip market or potential geopolitical tensions with China as part of the bear narrative, I think TSMC's current financial profile and its future trajectory speak for themselves regardless of these risks.\nIn my eyes, the disconnect between the company's valuation and its underlying business fundamentals could suggest that investors may not fully understand or appreciate the importance of its role in the broader chip ecosystem.\nI see TSMC stock as a no-brainer right now, and I think the company's price action suggests it is undervalued. Investors with a long-run time horizon might want to consider scooping up shares and holding on tight as the infrastructure chapter of the AI story continues to be written. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is uniquely positioned to ride these tailwinds and sustain high levels of revenue and profit growth for years to come."

      "text": "Although it's only August, 2025 has already played out like a modern-day Greek tragedy for semiconductor powerhouse Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%). Its year has been marked by a litany of setbacks, comebacks, and everything in between.\nEarlier this year, more than $1 trillion of Nvidia's market value was wiped out. Yet today, the company boasts a market cap of $4.4 trillion -- reclaiming the crown as the most valuable company in the world.\nAt the center of Nvidia's headaches in 2025 is China -- and no, not because of DeepSeek. The real culprit has been a wave of sweeping tariff policies and export controls that have curtailed Nvidia's influence in the Chinese AI market.\nNow, after months of negotiations with regulators in Washington, it appears that the tide may be turning. Nvidia could be on the precipice of reestablishing its presence in one of its most crucial Asian markets.\nLet's unpack the details of Nvidia's new deal structure in China and examine why it should be celebrated as a massive win for investors.\nHow big an opportunity is China for Nvidia?\nAccording to accounting and consulting firm Deloitte, the global total addressable market (TAM) for semiconductors, as measured by sales, reached $627 billion in 2024. Deloitte projects that the market will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% over the coming decades -- ultimately reaching $2 trillion by 2040.\nOutside of the U.S., China remains one of the most important markets fueling demand for high-performance chipsets, particularly graphics processing units (GPUs). Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has estimated that the AI opportunity in China alone could be worth as much as $50 billion.\nIn 2024, Nvidia generated $130 billion in revenue, with China capturing roughly 13% of this sum. During the first quarter of 2025, Nvidia's $5.5 billion of China sales accounted for roughly 12.5% of total revenue.\nThis leveling trend underscores how the current administration's policies toward China have started to constrain Nvidia's growth potential in the region.\nWhy is Nvidia's new China deal so important?\nAccording to multiple news outlets, Nvidia has reached an agreement with Washington regarding its operation in China. Under the terms, Nvidia will pay 15% of its China-based sales to the U.S. government. In effect, the arrangement provides Nvidia with a pathway to penetrate this critical market through its tailored H20 chips.\nWhile this might initially resemble a tax, investors should avoid viewing it through that lens. First, the agreement applies to sales of Nvidia's AI chips rather than to profits, unlike traditional forms of taxation. Moreover, the 15% rate does not appear to be variable in structure like a royalty, which is typically tied to intellectual property (IP) and subject to fluctuate.\nWhile this deal might appear unusual at first glance, these structures are not without precedent in global business practices. For example, energy companies that extract natural resources or commodities in foreign countries often operate under similar revenue-sharing agreements with host nations in exchange for distribution rights.\nIn my view, dedicating a modest share of sales to secure access to China represents a strategic trade-off. In the long run, it allows Nvidia to preserve its dominant position in one of the world's most important AI markets and prevents domestic rivals such as Huawei from eroding its competitive moat.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy?\nWhile Nvidia's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been expanding recently, levels remain muted compared to peaks reached previously during the AI revolution. In my view, part of this multiple compression reflects concerns surrounding China -- perhaps overly so.\nNvidia's new agreement in Washington offers the company renewed momentum, securing revenue in a critical market without forfeiting much in the way of profits -- even with the 15% remittance to the U.S. government.\nOver the long term, I see this arrangement as a strategic mechanism for Nvidia to strengthen its position overseas and deliver durable growth across the global AI infrastructure market.\nAs these fundamentals take hold, I think the company's valuation multiples could expand further, potentially driving the stock to new highs sooner than many investors may be expecting. For that reason, I see Nvidia stock as a no-brainer opportunity to buy hand over fist right now and hold for years to come."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

      "text": "Forward P/E is a valuation metric that uses earnings forecasts to calculate the ratio of the share price to projected earnings per share. The \"P\" in forward P/E stands for price, or share price. The \"E\" stands for future earnings per share.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is forward P/E?\nForward P/E is a variation of the price-to-earnings ratio that uses an estimate of earnings over the next 12 months to calculate the metric. Unlike the trailing P/E, which uses actual earnings results from the previous 12 months, the forward P/E is based on estimates, and is therefore subject to errors in forecasting.\nTo combat the potential to get the estimated earnings wrong, the forward P/E is typically calculated using a consensus estimate from all analysts who have published their expectations. This wisdom of the crowd approach typically leads to more accurate estimates.\nHow to calculate it\nHow to calculate forward P/E\nThe formula for calculating a forward P/E ratio is very straightforward.\nForward P/E = Current share price / Estimated future earnings per share\nThe hard part is determining the estimated earnings per share. Several resources provide consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts for big companies. Some companies, however, only have a few analysts (and sometimes none) publishing estimates. In those cases it may be worthwhile to dig into the company financials, management\u2019s commentary, and build your own estimate to aggregate with the professionals.\nAs an example, let\u2019s say a stock currently trades for around $150 per share. Analysts expect it\u2019ll produce earnings per share of $6 over the next year. That stock has a forward P/E ratio of 25.\nHow to use it\nHow to use forward P/E\nCalculating the forward P/E of a stock isn\u2019t very useful in and of itself. To get something out of it, you need to calculate the forward P/E of other comparable stocks.\nComparing the forward P/E of two or more companies within the same industry can give you an idea of whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. If one stock has a P/E far greater than its peers, the stock might not be a very good deal.\nBut there are good reasons why a stock may have a high forward P/E. If analysts expect that company\u2019s earnings per share to grow significantly faster than its peers, it\u2019ll value the next 12 months of earnings far higher than a slow-growing company. That\u2019s because a stock price reflects all the future cash flows of a business, not just the next 12 months.\nIt\u2019s important to consider that a forward P/E uses earnings per share, or EPS, in the denominator. EPS is itself a ratio, which is affected by the number of shares outstanding. So, if a company has plans to buy back a large percentage of its shares outstanding through a share repurchase program, investors may be willing to pay more for its earnings today.\nRelated investing topics\nLimitations\nLimitations of forward P/E\nTo calculate a price-to-earnings ratio, a company needs to have earnings. But not every company produces positive earnings for its shareholders.\nEarly-stage growth companies often produce losses, but their operations show strong potential for earnings at some point in the future. While they invest to grow the business, leverage their fixed operating expenses, and move toward profitability, their stocks technically trade for a negative P/E ratio.\nProfit\nEven when those companies start to make a profit, their relatively minuscule profits relative to the number of shares outstanding can lead to P/E ratios with triple or even quadruple digits. Those valuations aren\u2019t useful for an investing thesis, and forward P/E falls flat in those cases.\nInvestors will be better off finding a different valuation metric to compare growth stocks that are still generating losses for investors. Just because they have extremely high or non-existent forward P/E ratios doesn\u2019t make them bad investments."

      "text": "Generative AI, the seemingly magical technology behind apps like ChatGPT, is made up of two primary functions: AI training and AI inference. Both complement each other and work together to provide users with the best results for chat questions, image requests, and other common generative AI functions.\nWhat is AI training\nWhat is AI training, exactly?\nAI training is the first step in the process of building a generative AI application. Training in generative AI refers to the process of giving curated data to algorithms to teach it how to operate.\nIn a large language model, for example, the model is trained on billions of parameters of text that can include newspapers, websites, online chats, and social media.\nWhy AI training important\nWhy is AI training important?\nTo understand why AI training is so important, it might help to look at the evolution of OpenAI's GPT (generative pre-trained transformer), the technology that forms the basis of ChatGPT.\nWhen OpenAI launched, it had 117 million parameters, and its capabilities were much more limited than it is now. GPT-1 was trained on the Common Crawl, a data set of websites across the internet, and the BookCorpus dataset, a collection of 11,000 books. At the time, the technology was groundbreaking, and it was able to produce fluent language based on a prompt (but only in relatively short passages).\nBy comparison, the latest version of GPT-4 is believed to be trained on trillions of parameters and includes a broader range of data than earlier versions.\nConsequently, GPT-4 is much more capable than previous versions, and light years ahead of GPT-1. GPT-4 can interpret images. It can respond to complex prompts and can match human-like abilities in professional tests such as bar exams and grad school entrance tests like the MCAT.\nInference does play a role in the advancement of generative AI tools like ChatGPT, but any model will only be as good as the data it's trained on. The more data that's used in training, the more capable it will be.\nHow to evaluate AI training\nHow to evaluate AI training\nIf you're trying to choose between different AI models, such as chatbots or image generators, you'll need a way to evaluate them, and you'll want to evaluate them on how well they're trained.\nThere are several different ways you can evaluate AI training models. First, you can see how many parameters they were trained on and the data sources, which should give clues to the model's behavior.\nYou can also test the different models for accuracy. For example, you can ask them various questions pertaining to history, science, and other subjects to see if the model can answer them correctly. If you are using an image generator, you can use image prompts of increasing detail to test how well a model has been trained and can accurately interpret your prompt.\nOther factors you can use to evaluate AI training include precision -- or how specific an answer is -- and recall, which means the model's ability to remember the questions that have already been asked and to respond contextually.\nRelated investing topics\nExample\nAn example of how AI training works\nOne relatively simple example of how AI training works is with online recommendations.\nFor example, sites like Amazon (AMZN 3.12%), Netflix (NFLX -0.2%), and YouTube will recommend products, shows, or videos based on previous patterns from other users or based on your personal preferences.\nThis is a form of machine learning, but it's also another way that AI is trained since the model will adapt based on your choices and those of future users. Those choices become relevant data for the model.\nAI models are typically trained with a small dataset to start, expanding the data over time as the model grows more sophisticated.\nIn other words, training AI models isn't all that different from teaching humans, using increasing amounts of information so they can make inferences as they progress.\nAs training techniques become more sophisticated and datasets become even larger, generative AI models should continue to get better, and training will remain a key component to building these transformative models."

      "text": "Government bodies can use tariffs to bolster domestic industries and achieve foreign trade and policy objectives. Read on to learn more about tariffs, the different ways these taxes can be applied, and the roles they can play in international economics and diplomatic relations.\nWhat are tariffs?\nWhat are tariffs?\nTariffs are a form of tax imposed by national or supranational government bodies on the import or export of goods. Tariffs are also sometimes referred to as duties.\nWhy are tariffs important?\nWhy are tariffs important?\nBeyond just being a source of tax revenue, tariffs are a way that governments can modify trade incentives. In particular, tariffs can be important in protecting domestic industries and economic interests.\nTariffs can be a form of economic protectionism, but the costs typically wind up being passed on to domestic shoppers through price hikes on consumer goods. Higher prices on imported goods may give domestically produced goods a competitive advantage, but governments try to strike a balanced approach to tariff policy that works for the good of the broader economy.\nHow do tariffs work?\nHow do tariffs work?\nTariffs are collected when goods exit the domestic area and cross into foreign borders. Import tariffs are far more common than export tariffs. When pursuing growth opportunities in international markets, businesses must be mindful of how tariffs could affect the market for their products and their pricing strategies.\nDifferent categories of products typically have different levels of tariffs applied. For example, vegetables, auto parts, and dairy products have relatively high import tariffs in the U.S., and tariffs on sneakers and tobacco are even higher. On the other hand, not all goods are subject to import duties.\nGovernments will also set tariff levels on a country-by-country basis. In general, countries with less-developed economies tend to have higher tariffs.\nAcademic views on tariffs\nAcademic views on tariffs\nRyan Monarch, PhD\nThe Motley Fool: What are the short and long-term economic effects of tariffs that matter most to investors?\nRyan Monarch: \u201cIn the short-run, tariffs are seen as inflationary, and all else equal, the more widespread the tariffs, the tighter Federal Reserve policy will likely be in order to tamp down upward price pressure. The exchange rate is also likely to appreciate \u2013 as U.S. interest rate policy remains tight relative that of other countries, the dollar is likely to strengthen. The short run is also characterized by significant uncertainty about what trade policy will look like, leading to the pulling back of investment and production for many companies.\nIn the long-run, inflation expectations may become less stable, and as consumers come to expect inflation, this itself can lead the Federal Reserve to take stronger tightening actions. If a global trade war truly breaks out, in which countries continue to escalate tariffs and other actions against each other, the economic consequences for all sides would be dire, and could lead to a major downturn in global growth.\u201d\nThe Motley Fool: How do tariffs impact the economy?\nRyan Monarch: \u201cA tariff is a tax on an imported good paid by an importer in order to obtain their purchase after passing through customs. The basic purpose of a tariff is to increase the price of imported goods from a particular country in order to protect domestic producers of that good.\nSince tariffs increase the price of imported goods, tariffs impact the economy in a number of ways. First, average import prices increase as the scope of imported products facing tariffs expands. Second, tariffs tend to lead the imports of the affected goods to decrease. In some cases, affected businesses may substitute to purchasing products from other source countries or domestic alternatives, though the availability of such alternatives varies greatly depending on the imported product. Third, increase in import prices lead to higher costs for businesses using tariffed products as inputs, and affected firms tend to reduce employment, investment, and production in response. In fact, research on the 2018-2019 trade war has shown that job losses at U.S. firms using tariffed inputs well-exceeded job gains in protected sectors, and U.S. exports weakened as a result of higher import tariffs. Finally, government revenue increases as a result of the tax being applied to importers, though tariff revenue is a small fraction of overall government revenue in the United States.\u201d\nThe Motley Fool: Do tariffs cause inflation?\nRyan Monarch: \u201cTariffs cause the price of affected goods to rise. In fact, research into the 2018-2019 trade war has shown that the prices of U.S. imported goods affected by tariffs rose by nearly the entire amount of tariffs imposed, meaning that U.S. importers bore the brunt of the increase in costs. Additionally, if importers substitute toward alternatives that are more expensive than their original suppliers, this can also cause prices to rise.\nThe extent to which this causes inflation depends on many factors. One consideration is the scope of the tariffs: The more widespread tariffs are, the greater the inflationary pressures will be. It also depends on how importers respond to higher costs: In 2018-2019, many U.S. importers did not pass on the full amount of their cost increase to their consumers, and increases in consumer prices are the traditional metric of inflation. In addition, movements in exchange rates can counteract direct increases in import prices. For example, the dollar typically strengthens after tariffs are imposed, making imports cheaper. Central banks might also respond to widespread tariffs with tighter interest rate policies, also tamping down inflationary pressures. The exact measure of inflation along with the path of tariff increases also matters, as a one-off increase in prices due to tariffs would disappear quickly from short-run measures of inflation. All told, tariffs lead to higher prices, but there are numerous possibilities for how exactly these higher prices may be reflected in overall consumer price inflation.\u201d\nJason Miller, PhD\nThe Motley Fool: Who pays for tariffs imposed on U.S. imports?\nJason Miller, PhD: \u201cThe importing entity pays the tariffs.\u201d\nThe Motley Fool: Does the U.S. benefit from tariffs on Mexico and Canada?\nJason Miller, PhD: \u201cThe U.S. certainly does not economically benefit from tariffs, as tariffs will increase costs (thus contributing to inflation) and disrupt production networks. Prior research documents that U.S. manufacturers that export who saw larger increases in tariffs for the goods they imported from China saw reduced exports in 2019; we would expect the same mechanism to work regarding Canada and Mexico.\u201d\nThe Motley Fool: Do tariffs have any impact on prices of domestically produced goods?\nJason Miller, PhD: \u201cYes, especially in the case of metals such as steel and aluminum, domestic producers will increase their prices when foreign goods are subject to more tariffs. We saw this play out in 2018, as steel prices rose sharply that year, roughly 20%.\u201d\nDavid Ortega, PhD\nThe Motley Fool: How will tariffs impact the U.S. economy?\nDavid Ortega, PhD: \u201cTariffs function as taxes on imported goods, leading to increased costs for U.S. importers. These heightened costs often translate to higher prices for consumers and businesses relying on these imports to produce goods domestically.\"\nThe Motley Fool: Who pays for tariffs imposed on U.S. imports?\nDavid Ortega, PhD: \u201cImporters pay the tariff, which raises their costs, and this gets passed down in the form of higher prices.\u201d\nThe Motley Fool: Which products are going to cost more due to tariffs?\nDavid Ortega, PhD: \"Tariffs will increase the price of food, especially for items that we rely on our trading partners like produce. At the grocery store, the impact will be felt more immediately on perishable products that we import. Food products like avocados, tomatoes, peppers, berries, cucumbers, etc. \u2014 these are products that have a relatively short shelf-life and for which we can\u2019t hold inventory for a prolonged period. Other food and beverage products like imported Mexican beer, tequila, Canadian maple syrup to name a few are likely to see prices increase when tariffs are imposed.\u201d\nRelated investing topics\nExample\nAn example of tariffs in action\nDepending on their scope and application, tariffs can be a source of tension between governments. If one country implements or raises tariffs on another country's goods, there's a risk that the second country will respond in kind.\nIn recent years, the U.S. and China have increased tariffs imposed on each other's products. The U.S. began raising tariffs in 2018 under President Donald Trump, notably implementing a 25% tariff on steel imported from China and raising duties on other materials and products. In turn, China implemented its own tariff hikes on a wide range of goods. The trade squabble between the two countries escalated quickly.\nAlthough a subsequent trade deal helped reduce tensions to an extent, many of the tariffs implemented at the beginning of the trade dispute remain in place. Despite increasingly adversarial relations, trade between the U.S. and China has continued to reach new highs."

      "text": "Understanding financial terms is essential to being a successful investor, and that includes understanding the three financial statements: the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement.\nOn the cash flow statement, one of the most important components is capital expenditures.\nWhat does capital expenditures mean?\nWhat does capital expenditures mean?\nCapital expenditures, often called capex, are often listed on the cash flow statement as payments for property and equipment under cash flows from investing activities.\nAs the name implies, this is spending on capital goods and projects, as opposed to operating expenses.\nWhat qualifies as a capital expenditure?\nWhat qualifies as a capital expenditure?\nCapital expenditures often refers to spending on buildings and maintenance that are essential parts of most businesses. For example, a retailer like Walmart (WMT -1.15%) spends billions on capex to ensure that its stores are clean and up to date. A tech company like Meta Platforms (META 2.04%) or Amazon (AMZN 3.12%) might spend billions on capex, building out new data centers or filling existing ones.\nA capital expenditure is typically depreciated or amortized, as opposed to an operating expense, which is expensed.\nThat's an important distinction that you should be aware of when evaluating a business. Operating expenses typically refer to the direct spending needed to run a business. For example, at a restaurant, operating expenses would refer to labor costs, food costs, and occupancy costs like rent and utilities, as well as things like marketing expenses and even research and development. Capex would refer to spending on items such as building maintenance, new store buildouts, and other infrastructure.\nCapital expenditures don't affect the income statement directly, but they affect the cash flow statement -- the free cash flow statement, in particular, which is operating cash flow minus capital expenditures.\nFree Cash Flow (FCF)\nHow to use capital expenditures\nHow to use capital expenditures\nBecause capital spending isn't \"required\" in the way that operating expenses are, businesses have more flexibility on the timing of capex, so it's worth paying attention to see if businesses are cutting back on spending to conserve cash.\nCapital expenditures also give a sense of how aggressively a business is investing in growth. Comparing capital spending between companies can offer information on which one is spending more on growth. It's worth looking at the percentage of revenue going to capital expenditures, for example. A company that's spending more than its competitors could be preparing to outgrow them, although it could also be spending on capital inefficiently. Still, it's worth investigating why a company is increasing capex since it could be paving the way to a growth opportunity for the company.\nWall Street often punishes stocks for increasing spending on capex since they see it as eating into profits. As long as the money is spent wisely, however, it generally pays off in long-term profits and growth. It's a good idea to look for unloved stocks that are raising capital expenditures.\nRelated investing topics\nWhat's an example of a capital expenditure?\nWhat's an example of a capital expenditure?\nTo explore what capital expenditures look like in a real business, let's take a look at capital expenditures for Walmart in its most recent fiscal year.\nIn fiscal 2023, which ended on Jan. 31, 2023, Walmart spent $16.9 billion on capital expenditures. The company allocated $9.2 billion to the supply chain, including customer-facing initiatives and technology, with another $5 billion for store and club remodels and $2.6 billion for Walmart International. Only $33 million was allocated to new stores; Walmart has essentially stopped opening new stores.\nWalmart said its capex strategy includes improving customer-facing initiatives, creating a seamless omnichannel experience, and improving the supply chain.\nThe retailer has stepped up capex from $10.2 billion in fiscal 2021 to $13.1 billion in fiscal 2022 and $16.9 billion in fiscal 2023 as a result of company goals to become more competitive with Amazon on the e-commerce front and improve its tech capabilities.\nWalmart is able to fund that capex out of its operating cash flow with $28.8 billion in operating cash flow in fiscal 2023, giving it almost $12 billion in free cash flow last year. Walmart spent the remainder on dividends and share buybacks.\nUnderstanding the cash flow statement can give you key insights into a business, and capital expenditures are one of the most important components of the cash flow. It's essential to follow if you want to know how a business is spending its cash."

      "text": "OpenAI's commercial launch of ChatGPT on Nov. 30, 2022, ignited a seismic structural shift in the technology landscape. In particular, demand for enterprise productivity software and collaborative chat tools took a back seat to an intense focus on hardware -- notably, graphics processing units (GPUs) and networking equipment for data centers.\nSurging infrastructure demand propelled chip stocks such as Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom to record highs over the last few years. Since ChatGPT's release, each of these semiconductor stocks has handily outperformed the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.\nOne stock that has performed respectably but has underperformed its peers in the chip space is Micron Technology (MU 1.82%). In my view, Micron's role in the artificial intelligence (AI) realm is misunderstood and largely overlooked. Hence, the stock trades at a notable discount relative to its semiconductor cohorts.\nTo understand Micron's strategic positioning, investors must look beyond the GPU narrative and begin focusing on the quiet, albeit enormously important, pocket of memory and storage in AI.\nMicron plays an important role in the AI infrastructure stack\nOver the last few years, chances are you've been inundated with references to a host of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, Anthropic, Perplexity, DeepSeek, Alphabet's Google Gemini, Mistral AI, and Meta Platforms' LLaMa. This family of models has spurred generational demand for GPUs and custom ASIC chips -- an obvious tailwind for the likes of Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom.\nWhat often goes unnoticed is that as each generation of AI model becomes more sophisticated, hyperscalers such as Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet won't just be spending more on GPUs to process their workloads. Another crucial allocation for AI capital expenditure (capex) budgets is memory and storage. As model training and inference are pushed to the limit, additional high-performance computing (HPC) memory and storage solutions are required to satisfy rising capacity and bandwidth thresholds.\nThis fits squarely into Micron's wheelhouse. The company's high-bandwidth memory (HBM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), and NAND flash memory systems offer developers a vertically integrated AI memory stack. HBM provides the bandwidth layer GPUs need for training, while DRAM and NAND support processing and storage requirements for growing data workloads.\nHere is what the market is missing about Micron\nIn general, the semiconductor industry tends to exhibit cyclicality. Investors dislike uncertainty, so when demand trends are hard to forecast or financial guidance appears lumpy, investors view the company as high risk and apply lower valuation multiples to the business. At its core, I think this sentiment is holding Micron stock back at the moment.\nIn the past, Micron relied heavily on PC and smartphone upgrade cycles to drive demand. The association with unpredictable, consumer-centric retail cycles has fueled a belief that Micron lacks the same secular tailwinds enjoyed by its GPU-focused peers. I think this logic is misguided and no longer holds true, though.\nA new chapter in the AI narrative is swiftly being written -- one featuring sustained, rising infrastructure and capex spend from the largest generative AI developers. As AI training and inferencing continue to scale, big tech will map out detailed, multi-year buildout plans for data centers and GPU clusters. These demand spikes will not be transitory but rather structural commitments that unfold over the next several years.\nThis bodes well for Micron, as more robust memory platforms are becoming mission-critical necessities as opposed to a \"nice to have\" enhancement. In the long run, this should smooth out some of the volatility in Micron's financial profile and help transform its memory and storage business into a foundational layer on which AI infrastructure applications are built.\nIs Micron stock a buy right now?\nThe comparable company analysis below includes a number of established businesses playing critical roles across the chip landscape. Based on the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, Micron is by far the cheapest stock in this peer group. I find this valuation disparity a tad ironic, as Micron is positioned to benefit from the same hyperscaler infrastructure spend that also drives meaningful growth among its peers.\nIn my eyes, the disparity in valuation trends could suggest that the market underappreciates Micron's role in the chip realm and may see its memory services as a commoditized infrastructure solution. To me, the theme here is that as the hyperscalers boost their capex budgets to include more memory and storage solutions, Micron is well positioned for meaningful revenue acceleration and widening profit margins.\nIn the AI landscape, I see Micron as a rare example that carries compelling growth prospects but is trading more akin to a value stock. For this reason, I consider Micron a no-brainer opportunity that should not be ignored by growth investors with a long-term time horizon."

      "text": "About three years ago, a little-known start-up called OpenAI sparked a generational shift across the technology ecosystem after it released ChatGPT.\nAt its core, ChatGPT is a large language model (LLM) that allows users to input queries and test features including image generation, writing software code from scratch, or scraping the internet to answer basic questions on just about any topic.\nIn early August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman took center stage to showcase the latest version of ChatGPT called GPT-5. While GPT-5 is great for OpenAI's early backers, I see its creation as a massive -- albeit overlooked -- win for Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%) investors.\nLet's explore why GPT-5 is a big deal as the artificial intelligence (AI) narrative continues to unfold, and assess why Nvidia stock is positioned to benefit from the rise of more sophisticated LLMs.\nGPT-5 is more than just a new chatbot; it's rewriting the playbook for enterprise AI\nGPT-5 does not represent a routine upgrade compared to prior models released by OpenAI. Rather, large corporate enterprises are demanding more advanced functionality across a host of use cases and applications from LLMs.\nNew models such as GPT-5 doesn't simply mean \"smarter\" chatbots. Rather, GPT-5 and the competition that it spurs will open the door to a host of new applications in agentic AI, healthcare, and even adjacent models that lead to breakthroughs in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and wearable tech.\nConsidering OpenAI reportedly already has millions of paying customers and is on track to generate $20 billion in annual recurring revenue this year, I suspect the release of GPT-5 will serve as a bellwether for even more accelerated AI adoption.\nHow is GPT-5 bullish for Nvidia?\nIn a recent article by my fellow Fool Danny Vena, he made an astute point that AI adoption is moving downstream -- an idea that I don't think most investors fully grasp yet.\nEach new generation of an AI software model such as GPT innately leads to more demand for training and inferencing hardware. These developments require significant computational power in the form of GPU clusters, which plays right into Nvidia's rolodex of industry-leading AI accelerators, networking equipment, and CUDA software stack.\nTaking this one step further, the release of GPT-5 now raises the stakes for rival LLM platforms like Anthropic, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity -- ultimately creating an intensified arms race for complex GPU architectures, such as Nvidia Blackwell.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy right now?\nThe chart below illustrates trends in Nvidia's forward price to earnings (P/E) multiple over the last three years. Although Nvidia's forward P/E ratio is both higher than the three-year average and clearly experiencing an expansion phase at the moment, the valuation multiple does remain at a steep discount to prior levels seen during the AI revolution.\nI think Nvidia's premium forward earnings multiple suggests that investors are generally bullish on the company's prospects.\nHowever, the discount to historical levels could suggest that investors may not fully appreciate how rising AI infrastructure investment will translate into meaningful and accretive gains across Nvidia's ecosystem.\nMore advanced applications will continue to drive demand for Nvidia's full stack as the company plays a critical dual role in powering the creation and ongoing development of AI models across hardware and software. For this reason, I think Nvidia is positioned for further valuation expansion and see the stock as a no-brainer opportunity for long-term investors to buy and hold for years to come."

      "text": "The world seems to have been taken by storm by artificial intelligence tools that can write emails, create art, and perform other complex tasks. One type of tool, large language models, learns how to create sentences that can be used in myriad ways.\nWhat are large language models?\nWhat are large language models?\nLarge language models (LLMs) are a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that's trained to create sentences and paragraphs out of its training dataset. Unlike other AI tools that might predict word choice based on what you've already written, LLMs can create whole sentences, paragraphs, and essays by using their training data alone.\nAlthough LLMs were designed as language-predicting models, they are also being trained to be used in a wide range of applications, from customer service chatbots to friends to the lonely and even as personal assistants that can generate simple letters and emails.\nHow they work\nHow do large language models work?\nLarge language models, as well as other forms of artificial intelligence, are clever computer programs, but they're just that -- computer programs. They have to be taught how to do their jobs from the ground up. Here's how that works:\n- Training. During the training phase, LLMs analyze trillions of words in order to understand how language works. The better the datasets, the better the results, as in other machine learning models. With an LLM, language data is fed into the system without specific instructions, allowing the system to learn about context, word meanings, and the relationship between words in a given language.\n- Fine-tuning. Depending on the task the LLM is meant to perform, it will have to undergo some fine-tuning to ensure it's doing the job properly. For example, if it's meant to do translation, a human translator will work with it to ensure it's translating correctly, correct it when it makes a mistake, and help shape the information used by the LLM.\n- Prompt-tuning. Prompt-tuning is a lot like fine-tuning; it helps guide the LLM along its way to full development. Unlike fine-tuning, which optimizes specific tasks, prompt-tuning helps the system to learn to anticipate when specific types of data are needed by learning \"prompts,\" such as \"Answer the question\" or \"Can you help me.\" Much like how humans infer there's a question coming by tone of voice, prompt-tuning can help a general-purpose LLM understand what is expected of it.\nMachine Learning\nTypes of LLMs\nTypes of large language models\nAlthough it might seem like all large language models are essentially the same, there are huge differences in how they can be used and trained. The main models include:\n- Zero-shot models. These are LLMs that are for general purposes and are trained using enormous and wide-ranging datasets. They're not meant to do any one thing and are instead expected to be able to do a lot of different things based on what the user is requesting.\n- Domain-specific models. If you take a zero-shot model and give it extra training, you can make a domain-specific model. This model knows a lot about something much more specific. For example, you might build a LLM that can listen to users' problems and give supportive feedback, similar to a counselor.\n- Edge models. Edge model LLMs do one job and do it very well. These tools are already in use all over the place, doing small tasks that require immediate feedback, like translating signs or helping users by suggesting words that should fit together with their sentences when composing a letter.\nConcerns about LLMs\nConcerns about large language models\nLarge language models are very interesting computer programs, but they've also managed to churn a good deal of controversy since they were widely introduced. A couple of common concerns involve copyrighted information and LLM hallucinations. Both may have long-ranging implications for the commercial viability of LLMs in general.\nCopyright infringement\nBecause LLMs must be trained on enormous datasets, many LLM developers have pulled information from sources that may or may not actually be open for use in this way. For example, some are alleged to be training LLMs on social media data, while others may be using whole books or websites written by someone who has not given their permission for use in training these models.\nThis creates a problem when it comes to ownership. Since LLMs are software that can't legally own anything, the end result isn't treated the same as a person who is simply influenced by a particular writer, for example. When the data used to train the LLM wasn't used with permission, the information generated by the LLM may be infringing on the copyright of those influencers.\nSo, right now, the question has become ownership of the LLM's output. Is it the software designer who trained the software on essentially pirated content? Is it the owners of the content that was pirated? Is it a different third party?\nRelated investment topics\nHallucinations\nAnother huge concern for users and owners of LLMs is hallucinations. A hallucination occurs when an LLM gives a wrong answer to a user but with extreme confidence. Instead of simply saying it doesn't know, an LLM will give an answer it believes is statistically likely to be correct, even if it makes absolutely no sense.\nThis doesn't happen all the time, of course, but it happens often enough that there is a great deal of concern with trust in LLMs and their outputs. Many people have also noticed that they're terrible with numbers, often being unable to even count the words in their own output.\nOf course, accuracy, hallucinations, and mathematical ability will vary between LLMs. Some models do much better than others, but they're all prone to problems of this nature since they weren't trained to fully understand what they're outputting, only what is statistically likely to make sense as a sentence in the context given."

      "text": "Over the next several weeks, companies will report financial and operating results for the second quarter of 2025. As usual, technology investors will be focused on one thing: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\"Magnificent Seven\" member Alphabet kicked things off earlier this week, reporting robust results across its search, advertising, and cloud computing divisions.\nWhile Alphabet shareholders should be encouraged by the internet giant's strong performance, I saw Nvidia (NVDA 1.65%) as the real winner from the company's second-quarter performance.\nLet's dig into some of the important moves Alphabet is making and assess how Nvidia is benefiting from them.\nAlphabet is picking up the pace on AI infrastructure construction\nDuring the Q2 earnings call, Alphabet's management updated some details of its financial guidance. Alphabet now plans to spend around $85 billion on capital expenditures (capex) in 2025. Of note, this is a $10 billion increase over the company's prior guidance.\nAnd there's more. \"Looking out to 2026, we expect a further increase in capex due to the demand we're seeing from customers as well as growth opportunities across the company,\" said Chief Financial Officer Anat Ashkenazi.\nDespite its increasingly aggressive spending on AI infrastructure over the last few years, Alphabet has stated that it doesn't plan on slowing down anytime soon. This should be music to Nvidia's ears.\nWhy is this good for Nvidia?\nManagement consulting juggernaut McKinsey & Company is forecasting that AI infrastructure spending could reach $6.7 trillion by 2030. And its research suggests that almost half of that money will be allocated toward AI hardware for further data center construction.\nIn addition, research from Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan indicates that generative AI could add between $7 trillion and $10 trillion to global gross domestic product in the long run.\nFrom a macroeconomic perspective, these secular trends bode well for Nvidia's compute and networking empire. Moreover, I think that Alphabet's decision to bump up its AI infrastructure spending again adds some credibility to those industry forecasts.\nAlphabet's management specified that it is raising its planned capex in order to accelerate the construction of data centers and position itself to fill the rising demand for capacity on the Google Cloud Platform.\nIncreased spending on network equipment, servers, and cloud infrastructure should lead to rising demand for graphics processing units (GPUs). I see this as a major positive development as Nvidia is still scaling up production of chips made using its latest Blackwell architecture.\nConsidering Nvidia holds an estimated 90% share of the data center GPU market, I see Alphabet's investments in AI infrastructure as a major tailwind for the chip king and further propels the company's momentum over competition in the chip space.\nIs Nvidia stock a buy right now?\nWith a market cap north of $4.2 trillion, Nvidia is currently the most valuable company in the world. While this might lead one to assume that the stock is expensive, its underlying valuation trends tell a different story.\nNvidia currently trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 40. While this isn't \"cheap\" by traditional benchmarks, it is notably lower than the peak levels Nvidia has witnessed during the AI revolution.\nWhat makes these dynamics interesting is that Nvidia's growth trajectory is arguably far stronger today than it was 18 months ago when its forward P/E valuation peaked. The company remains at the center of the AI revolution, providing massive amounts of fast parallel-processing power to hyperscalers and accelerating AI workloads.\nTo me, buying Nvidia stock at its current price is a no-brainer, and I see Alphabet's rising AI infrastructure spending as a long-term catalyst that should not be overlooked by growth investors."
