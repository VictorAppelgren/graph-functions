  "title": "Metlen CEO: Move to LSE Reflects Metlen\u2019s International Operations",
  "description": "Metlen\u2019s move from Athens to a larger stock exchange such as the LSE reflects the international operations of the company that is now present in 42 countries, Chairman and CEO Evangelos Mytilineos says in a Bloomberg TV interview (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "The international footprint of the company has grown steadily. We are now present in 42 countries and we have decided that time was right to move to a bigger change and for us determined to stay in Europe. We thought London was the best option and we are happy that London is going to make a comeback and we are going to be part of it. But we know that Euronext has been looking to consolidate and grow bigger and bigger. They just looked at buying the Athens stock exchange as one example as well. I'm curious, why not pursue a European capital or a continental European capital like Paris or Frankfurt? That's a very interesting question. If you if you look back a little bit, the city has been through rough times after Brexit, no doubt. And Frankfurt, Milan, Paris, Amsterdam, they have tried to take a big chunk out of the city business. But in the end, City never lost the primacy in the financial markets. Therefore, although it was the most difficult stock exchange to get in the first place, a decision was put on them. You you've said in previous comments that MATTLIN plans to take advantage of rules that might allow euro denominated stocks to join the Footsie 100. If that change weren't in the works, would you have still picked this part of the world? That's a very interesting part of the whole scheme. When we decided to enter the Troika the Elysee, we didn't know that there will be changes in the laws and regulations and you would trade in, you could trade in euro or dollars. Now that is the case the last four or five months, and we are the first company to trade in euros. At the same time, we have seen a rapprochement between the UK and the European Union the most after Brexit. We are this is ongoing now. We can see it and I'm happy that a European company, European Union company is listing in the UK and is listing in euros. So it is a step in that direction and that makes me very happy. A Certainly a positive one I think makes a lot of people who are excited about London. Very, very happy as well. Let's talk a little bit about your business specifically, if we can. We're talking a lot about geopolitical volatility today. We're talking about trade deals. We're talking about tariffs as well. We know the US has raised tariffs on aluminum to the tune of about 50%. Are you seeing an impact on your business? Look, we're a big exporter of aluminum, but we have to consider that the US is a big importer of aluminum. Therefore, for us, that makes no change because the Americans will have to buy the same amount of aluminum that they used to buy before the tariff increase. The ones who will have to pay would be the American consumers. And you're able to pass on those costs. You don't you don't feel margin pressure for yourself. No, we don't. How talk to us a little bit then about how you're operating in the rest of the world then if there is this idea of the US has this massive consumption of aluminum or is trying to import them, would you look to broaden your exposure to other places in the world? Well, there's no doubt the trade flows are going to be seriously affected by the decisions of President Trump for the tariffs. But the how the end game is going to be we have to wait and see. I am I'm far from certain that we are going to have a nice endgame, and especially for Europe, where the chance to have a good agreement was lost. We made a bad agreement in Europe, and especially I want to underline the fact that we have it according to the agreements to invest $600 million in the next three or five years, whatever, and by energy, $700 million. Even if Europe could absorb this amount of energy, the US does not have $700 billion worth of energy to sell to you. So probably this is an initial agreement and we may see significant changes to the final text. You say it's not a very good agreement. Talk to us about that 15% number. The criticism of that is that at least it provides clarity to European businesses. Do you feel like it provides clarity? It does provide clarity because it's five 15%. But I remind you that before that it was 0%. So Donald Trump, who is a great negotiator, said the high rises up to 30%. And then he said 415 and European say, well, great, good 15. No, no, no. It was zero and it's 15. And the Europeans, they are not they cannot retaliate. It's part of the agreement. Talk to us a little bit about another place that Europeans are spending quite a bit of money on right now, and that is the defense ramp up in this continent. How is Mettler looking to get more involved in the defense sector, in metallurgy sector? We have been in the defense business for more than 25 years. We have a long experience. We have very close connections with all big German and US primary manufacturers, and we intend to expand this business. We have already three plants in Greece. We are building another two as we speak. So this is part of our goals going forward.",
