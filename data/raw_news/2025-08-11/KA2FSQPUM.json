  "content": "The White House in June. President Trump unveiled plans for one of the largest renovations to the historic building in decades. Eric Lee for The New York Times Experts on historic preservation are raising concerns over the feasibility of President Trump\u2019s plans to complete large-scale renovations to the White House by the end of his term, and whether the project can be done while respecting the historic nature of the building. Mr. Trump unveiled plans on Thursday to construct a $200 million, 90,000-square-foot state ballroom off the East Wing to be completed \u201clong before\u201d the end of his term in 2029. The project would be one of the largest renovations to the iconic building in decades. Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, shows photos of the proposed ballroom at a news briefing last week. Mr. Trump has been on a winning streak this summer, emerging victorious in a series of Supreme Court rulings, signing a massive bill to carry out his domestic policy agenda and winning concessions from some of America\u2019s top trading partners. Now, by checking off a long-sought item on his list of pet projects, Mr. Trump is showing that he apparently feels emboldened to continue flexing his presidential power. The White House, the Supreme Court building, the Capitol and all their \u201crelated buildings and grounds\u201d are exempt from the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, which requires federal agencies to assess and mitigate adverse effects to historic properties and seek consultation through a formal review process. Instead, the White House has its own committee that provides advice on the \u201cpreservation and the interpretation of the museum character\u201d of the building. The Committee for the Preservation of the White House \u2014 chaired by the director of the National Park Service \u2014 is made up of several federal officials and a number of members appointed by the president. Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff, said on Thursday in a news release that the administration was \u201cfully committed to working with the appropriate organizations to preserving the special history of the White House.\u201d Still, the committee\u2019s recommendations are not binding, giving the president significant leeway to do as he wishes. \u201cIn most cases, you\u2019re not going to have a lot of binding obligations to historic buildings,\u201d said Michael Spencer, a professor of historic preservation at the University of Mary Washington. The sheer scale of the project \u2014 a giant ballroom attached to the East Wing \u2014 worries preservationists. \u201cIt could do some harm to the property over all,\u201d said Richard Longstreth, a former professor of American studies at George Washington University. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any checks and balances here, unfortunately.\u201d Mr. Spencer said his expectations on preservation were \u201cpretty low.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re oftentimes viewed as getting in the way of progress, and I would say in this particular instance, you\u2019ve got a lot of strong personalities and they\u2019re under no obligation to really follow best practices as preservation puts forth,\u201d he said. Jonathan Jarvis, former director of the National Park Service, which is responsible for the upkeep of the White House and its grounds, said any additions made to the White House must follow the architectural design of the building. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t put something on the side of the building that doesn\u2019t match it historically in terms of its architecture, coloration and style,\u201d he said. He cast doubt on the timeline the Trump administration proposed, calling its plans to finish a project of this scale by the end of Mr. Trump\u2019s term \u201coptimistic.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t see one of those projects go that fast,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be a rush to get it done.\u201d Mr. Jarvis, who was the director of the National Park Service from 2009 to 2017, said construction at the White House is a \u201ccomplicated process\u201d because it is \u201cnot just normal construction.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the White House \u2014 it has to survive a terrorist attack,\u201d he said. He added that every step of the process would need to be evaluated to ensure that nothing \u201cis being compromised architecturally or from a security standpoint.\u201d President Trump began paving over the White House Rose Garden in June. Stewart D. McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association, said the White House has gone through numerous changes to its interior and exterior since the cornerstone was laid in 1792, and many of them faced resistance. He said many of those changes made the White House what it is today. \u201cThe South Portico, the North Portico, the East Wing, the West Wing and the Truman Balcony all raised concerns at the time \u2014 but today, we can\u2019t imagine the White House without these iconic elements,\u201d he said. President Franklin D. Roosevelt speaks from the South Portico of the White House in 1940. The second floor \u201cTruman Balcony\u201d was constructed during White House renovations from 1948-1952. It remains unclear whether the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, which works in tandem with the White House Historical Association, has provided recommendations or raised concerns about Mr. Trump\u2019s ballroom. A spokeswoman for the historical association, Jessica Fredericks, did not respond to questions about the committee\u2019s position on the project. In addition to the director of the National Park Service, the committee is composed of representatives from the White House, the Smithsonian Institution, the Commission of Fine Arts, the National Gallery of Art and a handful of presidential appointees. Mr. Trump has not nominated a park service director, a position that requires Senate confirmation, or announced the appointments of individuals to serve on the committee. The terms of 13 individuals that former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. appointed to the committee in 2023 expired when Mr. Trump began his second term, according to a government database. Jessica Bowron, the comptroller of the National Park Service, is currently serving as its acting director. President Trump watches as the American Flag is raised on his new flagpole on the South Lawn of the White House in June. The president tapped McCrery Architects as the lead architect of the project. James McCrery, the company\u2019s founding principal architect, was appointed by Mr. Trump in 2019 to serve a four-year term on the Commission of Fine Arts. He called the ballroom a necessary addition to the White House, where presidents have \u201cfaced challenges hosting major events.\u201d Mr. McCrery said he would preserve \u201cthe elegance of its classical design and historical importance\u201d of the White House. Questions about who is funding the project are also still largely unanswered. White House officials said the president and \u201cother patriot donors\u201d would pay for the renovations but declined to give details. When asked on Friday if he would block foreign donations, Mr. Trump said he had not thought about it: \u201cI\u2019m not looking for that. You have very strong restrictions. And we go by the restrictions.\u201d Still, Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in government ethics, called the lack of transparency \u201ccompletely outrageous.\u201d She questioned whether the donors were seeking \u201cways to get in good with Trump.\u201d \u201cHe feels emboldened,\u201d she said. \u201cHe feels like he can do anything.\u201d\n\nSome Chinese immigrants weigh a painful question: stay or flee under Trump? Han Lihua says fear has eclipsed his fragile new life, forcing difficult questions about whether the United States can offer a better situation. Ever since immigration raids swept Los Angeles in June, Han Lihua, 46, has spent much of his time hiding in his apartment, skipping his Amazon delivery shifts and scrolling on social media to look for nearby sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. In 2022, he fled China, where he ran an independent student newspaper and taught high school literature. He crossed the treacherous Dari\u00e9n Gap on the border of Colombia and Panama before crossing the Southern border of the United States illegally in early 2023. Now, with the Trump administration carrying out a sweeping immigration crackdown, he is among the Chinese immigrants who say fear has eclipsed their fragile new lives, forcing difficult questions about whether the United States can offer them a better situation after they fled an authoritarian government. \u201cEveryone is so afraid,\u201d Mr. Han said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect this would happen in the United States.\u201d Since China reopened its borders in January 2023 after Covid lockdowns, more than 63,000 Chinese nationals like Mr. Han have fled and crossed the U.S. southern border without authorization, according to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, making them the fourth-largest group by nationality after migrants from Venezuela, Haiti, and Ecuador. Under Trump\u2019s policies, however, illegal crossings along the southern border have dropped dramatically, reaching 6,000 arrests in June, a low not seen in decades. Most Chinese immigrants fled strict censorship, growing political repression or Beijing\u2019s zero-Covid policies, which often shut down entire cities for weeks, if not months, trapping people in their homes with little access to food, medical care or work. Those who spoke out against the policies could face harassment or detention. But with the Trump administration\u2019s escalating immigration enforcement, many Chinese immigrants like Mr. Han now confront a question they never imagined they would face: Should they stay or leave? Huang Xiaosheng, a Los-Angeles-based Chinese immigration lawyer, described the situation as \u201cmuch harsher\u201d since May, when the Trump administration set a goal of a minimum of 3,000 arrests a day. Securing bail has become nearly impossible, he said. And dozens of videos of ICE arrests have circulated on Chinese social media, fueling fear among the community, he said. Some Chinese immigrants \u201care thinking about their Plan B,\u201d Mr. Huang said. \u201cThey\u2019re considering Canada or other countries, or even going back to China.\u201d Chinese immigrants are far from alone in their heightened fears during the Trump administration. ICE has stepped up arrests across the country of all nationalities, conducting raids in major cities such as San Francisco, New York and Los Angeles. Arrests and detentions have swept through restaurants, courthouses, and other public spaces. In the past six months, the administration has also deported migrants to third countries that agreed to take them, including Panama, Costa Rica and El Salvador. Immigration lawyers said Chinese immigrants could face criminal prosecution by the Chinese government if they are deported by the U.S., but those who return voluntarily likely would only be fined. A little over a year ago, former President Joseph R. Biden arranged the first deportation flight back to China since 2018. China doesn\u2019t usually accept deportation flights, but it again allowed the Trump administration to deport a group of 122 Chinese nationals in June. \u201cThe Chinese government firmly opposes any form of illegal migration,\u201d Mao Ning, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in January. The ministry said it has cooperated with the United States on repatriation. Recently, discussions on Chinese social media have centered around questions including \u201cShould I go back?\u201d or \u201cWho has been back?\u201d Users who have left the country often debate the pros and cons of their decisions. They once discussed \u201crunology\u201d \u2014 figuring out how to leave China during the lockdowns. Now, they discuss \u201creverse runology,\u201d or mapping a way back to China. Experts noted that, despite the online chatter, the number of voluntary returns appeared to be small. They predicted it would likely stay that way, given China\u2019s faltering economy, soaring youth unemployment and stifling censorship that has continue to drive people out \u2014 plus any legal consequences of returning. The immigration law office of Chuangchuang Chen in Monterey Park, Calif. Xu Feng, who arrived in 2023, said two of his friends returned to China, but he hoped to remain. Since his arrival, he has toiled in massage parlors, restaurants and now a supermarket in Flushing, a bustling hub for Chinese immigrants in New York City. After work, the 33-year-old regularly attended nine hours of English classes each week. Mr. Xu added that he worked hard, obeyed the law and paid taxes while waiting for his asylum. \u201cI believe the United States needs human resources like us,\u201d he said. But if arrests continue to target individuals like him, he said, \u201cI\u2019d rather go to other countries or go back to China.\u201d Mr. Xu\u2019s two friends confirmed their return to The New York Times but declined to be interviewed. Both paid a fine of 1,000 Chinese yuan (about $140), and one of them had their passport confiscated. \u201cVery few clients have actually gone back to China,\u201d said Chen Chuangchuang, an L.A.-based immigration lawyer. \u201cAnd they often regretted it after doing so.\u201d Mr. Chen, whose office in the Fatman Ding Plaza in California, serves as a first stop for some Chinese undocumented immigrants who cross the U.S.-Mexico border. He added that China has a broad definition of illegal border crossing, so entering the United States without authorization can be prosecuted as a crime. One of his client\u2019s family members, deported back to China late last year, was later convicted. The Trump administration continues to urge their return, saying that illegal immigrants have been sent back home \u201cnearly every day.\u201d Despite the threats, some are trying to stay hopeful. \u201cI can\u2019t control the country\u2019s policies,\u201d said Shen Weihao, a 28-year-old who said he fled China after being arrested during a protest in Shanghai. \u201cI can only focus on what I can control.\u201d Now living in New York, Mr. Shen has enrolled in flight training and hopes to become a pilot. Ever since he converted to Christianity in 2016, he said his church faced harassment, surveillance and government orders to terminate activities. Even after he left, the authorities continued questioning his parents and brother back home. \u201cI can\u2019t go back,\u201d Mr. Han said. \u201cIf I do, I\u2019ll probably be thrown in jail.\u201d\n\nSenate confirms Jeanine Pirro, the former Fox News host, as U.S. attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro was sworn in as interim U.S. attorney in May. The former Fox News host Jeanine Pirro, whose false statements about the 2020 election were part of a lawsuit against the network, was confirmed as the U.S. attorney for Washington, D.C., on Saturday. Ms. Pirro has been serving as interim U.S. attorney, and the Senate voted 50 to 45 on Saturday to formalize her role, with all Democrats present opposed. President Trump picked Ms. Pirro after he was forced to pull his first choice, the interim U.S. attorney Ed Martin, under pressure from Senate Republicans who were uncomfortable with Mr. Martin\u2019s willingness to investigate Democrats, academic institutions and critics of Elon Musk while seeking to dismantle and delegitimize the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot inquiry. Yet Ms. Pirro, the former Republican district attorney of Westchester County, N.Y., who became known as \u201cJudge Jeanine\u201d on the CW Network and Fox, is known for sharing many of Mr. Martin\u2019s beliefs and policies. She has supported Mr. Trump\u2019s efforts to exact vengeance on his political enemies and backed his challenges to federal judges who have questioned the legality of his immigration policies. And she was vocal in raising doubts about the legitimacy of Joseph R. Biden Jr.\u2019s election to the presidency in 2020. Ms. Pirro was among the Fox hosts named in a lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems for questioning the validity of ballot tabulations on Fox\u2019s broadcasts. Fox settled the case and was forced to acknowledge that claims about Dominion advanced by Ms. Pirro and others were false. The president has also proved to be a reliable ally of Ms. Pirro. In 2021, in the final hours of his first term, Mr. Trump pardoned Ms. Pirro\u2019s former husband \u2014 and Mr. Trump\u2019s onetime lawyer \u2014 Albert J. Pirro Jr., who was convicted of conspiracy and tax evasion charges in 2000. In announcing Ms. Pirro\u2019s selection as U.S. attorney in May, Mr. Trump listed her law enforcement credentials and said she was \u201cin a class by herself.\u201d Her confirmation, however, drew strong criticism from Democrats. Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said Ms. Pirro\u2019s record was \u201cdeeply troubling.\u201d \u201cPresident Trump has been using the Justice Department to protect his allies and go after his enemies, and Ms. Pirro has proven to be a willing accomplice in weaponizing the justice system,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cShe is not fit to be the U.S. attorney for our nation\u2019s capital, and I believe it\u2019s a grave mistake my Republican colleagues voted to confirm her.\u201d Republicans defended her. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, called her a trailblazer, in part for her work against domestic abuse and crimes against children. \u201cYou may hear my Democrat colleagues criticize Ms. Pirro for some of her colorful remarks during her time as a TV personality,\u201d he said, acknowledging that \u201cyes, she has a larger-than-life personality.\u201d But he added: \u201cD.C. is fortunate that the president nominated her to serve as its U.S. attorney. Her job in the interim role, where she is stationed now, has been heralded.\u201d Senators also voted, 52 to 44, to confirm Miami-Dade County Judge Jason Reding Qui\u00f1ones as the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida.\n\nTrump\u2019s tariffs are making money. That may make them hard to quit. Shipping containers at the Port of Baltimore. Even before the latest tariffs set in, revenue from taxes collected on imported goods grew drastically this year. Alyssa Schukar for The New York Times President Trump\u2019s extensive tariffs have already started to generate a significant amount of money for the federal government, a new source of revenue for a heavily indebted nation that American policymakers may start to rely on. As part of his quest to reorder the global trading system, Mr. Trump has imposed steep tariffs on America\u2019s trading partners, with the bulk of those set to go into effect on Aug. 7. Even before the latest tariffs kick in, revenue from taxes collected on imported goods has grown dramatically so far this year. Customs duties, along with some excise taxes, generated $152 billion through July, roughly double the $78 billion netted over the same time period last fiscal year, according to Treasury data. Monthly government revenue from customs duties and certain excise taxes Indeed, Mr. Trump has routinely cited the tariff revenue as evidence that his trade approach, which has sowed uncertainty and begun to increase prices for consumers, is a win for the United States. Members of his administration have argued that the money from the tariffs would help plug the hole created by the broad tax cuts Congress passed last month, which are expected to cost the government at least $3.4 trillion. \u201cThe good news is that Tariffs are bringing Billions of Dollars into the USA!\u201d Mr. Trump said on social media shortly after a weak jobs report showed signs of strain in the labor market. Over time, analysts expect that the tariffs, if left in place, could be worth more than $2 trillion in additional revenue over the next decade. Economists overwhelmingly hope that doesn\u2019t happen and the United States abandons the new trade barriers. But some acknowledge that such a substantial stream of revenue could end up being hard to quit. \u201cI think this is addictive,\u201d said Joao Gomes, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School. \u201cI think a source of revenue is very hard to turn away from when the debt and deficit are what they are.\u201d Mr. Trump has long fantasized about replacing taxes on income with tariffs. He often refers fondly to American fiscal policy in the late 19th century, when there was no income tax and the government relied on tariffs, citing that as a model for the future. And while income and payroll taxes remain by far the most important sources of government revenue, the combination of Mr. Trump\u2019s tariffs and the latest Republican tax cut does, on the margin, move the United States away from taxing earnings and toward taxing goods. President Trump and members of his administration have repeatedly said that a key goal of the tariffs is to bring in more government revenue. Such a shift is expected to be regressive, meaning that rich Americans will fare better than poorer Americans under the change. That\u2019s because cutting taxes on income does, in general, provide the biggest benefit to richer Americans who earn the most income. The recent Republican cut to income taxes and the social safety net is perhaps the most regressive piece of major legislation in decades. Placing new taxes on imported products, however, is expected to raise the cost of everyday goods. Lower-income Americans spend more of their earnings on those more expensive goods, meaning the tariffs amount to larger tax increase for them compared to richer Americans. Tariffs have begun to bleed into consumer prices, with many companies saying they will have to start raising prices as a result of added costs. And analysts expect the tariffs to weigh on the performance of the economy overall, which in turn could reduce the amount of traditional income tax revenue the government collects every year. \u201cIs there a better way to raise that amount of revenue? The economic answer is: Yes, there is a better way, there are more efficient ways,\u201d said Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Yale Budget Lab and a former Biden administration official. \u201cBut it\u2019s really a political question.\u201d Mr. Tedeschi said that future leaders in Washington, whether Republican or Democrat, may be hesitant to roll back the tariffs if that would mean a further addition to the federal debt load, which is already raising alarms on Wall Street. And replacing the tariff revenue with another type of tax increase would require Congress to act, while the tariffs would be a legacy decision made by a previous president. \u201cCongress may not be excited about taking such a politically risky vote when they didn\u2019t have to vote on tariffs in the first place,\u201d Mr. Tedeschi said. Some in Washington are already starting to think about how they could spend the tariff revenue. Mr. Trump recently floated the possibility of sending Americans a cash rebate for the tariffs, and Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, recently introduced legislation to send $600 to many Americans. \u201cWe have so much money coming in, we\u2019re thinking about a little rebate, but the big thing we want to do is pay down debt,\u201d Mr. Trump said last month of the tariffs. Democrats, once they return to power, may face a similar temptation to use the tariff revenue to fund a new social program, especially if raising taxes in Congress proves as challenging as it has in the past. As it is, Democrats have been divided over tariffs. Maintaining the status quo may be an easier political option than changing trade policy. \u201cThat\u2019s a hefty chunk of change,\u201d Tyson Brody, a Democratic strategist, said of the tariffs. \u201cThe way that Democrats are starting to think about it is not that \u2018these will be impossible to withdraw.\u2019 It\u2019s: \u2018Oh look, there\u2019s now going to be a large pot of money to use and reprogram.\u2019\u201d Of course, the tariffs could prove unpopular, and future elected officials may want to take steps that could lower consumer prices. At the same time, the amount of revenue the tariffs generate could decline over time if companies do, in fact, end up bringing back more of their operations to the United States, reducing the number of goods that face the import tax. \u201cThis is clearly not an efficient way to gather revenue,\u201d said Alex Jacquez, a former Biden official and the chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal group. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think it would be a long-term progressive priority as a way to simply collect revenue.\u201d\n\nShe was an economist with bipartisan support. Then Trump fired her. Erika McEntarfer was appointed as the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics by President Biden in 2023 and confirmed in January 2024. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, via Reuters Nearly the entire Senate supported Erika McEntarfer in 2024 to lead the agency that produces key data on jobs and inflation. The widely respected economist was confirmed on a bipartisan 86-8 Senate vote, with support from Vice President JD Vance, who was then an Ohio senator, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, then a Florida senator. But Dr. McEntarfer was suddenly caught in the political crossfire on Friday when President Trump lashed out over the agency\u2019s most recent jobs report and fired her for releasing monthly jobs data showing surprisingly weak hiring. He called the data \u201crigged\u201d without offering any evidence, and he accused Dr. McEntarfer of manipulating the job numbers \u201cfor political purposes.\u201d Dr. McEntarfer was nominated to her most recent post by President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Before that, she earned her stripes at the Census Bureau, where she worked for over two decades under both Republican and Democratic presidents. She graduated from Bard College with a bachelor\u2019s degree in social sciences, and she obtained a Ph.D. in economics at Virginia Tech. She began her career as an economist at the Census Bureau, where she worked for six years, according to her LinkedIn profile. In 2008, she joined the Treasury Department, where she analyzed the president\u2019s budget as well as the effect of tax policy proposals on revenue. Dr. McEntarfer returned to the Census Bureau in 2010, assuming more of a leadership role. She became the head of research for the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics program, which is responsible for developing new statistics on postsecondary employment outcomes and quarterly work force indicators. She also served on the White House Council of Economic Advisers under the Biden administration, advising senior White House officials on labor market data. Her time on the council came as the labor market was recovering from the pandemic. Dr. McEntarfer hasn\u2019t commented on her firing publicly, and it wasn\u2019t clear what she would do next. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, the Labor secretary, said Friday that William Wiatrowski, the deputy commissioner, would serve as acting commissioner until a replacement was found. In a statement on Friday, a group called the Friends of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, made up of former commissioners who served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, denounced Mr. Trump\u2019s move to fire her. It accused the president of wanting someone to blame for the unwelcome economic news. \u201cThe commissioner does not determine what the numbers are but simply reports on what the data show,\u201d the group said. \u201cThe process of obtaining the numbers is decentralized by design to avoid opportunities for interference.\u201d Dr. McEntarfer\u2019s role as commissioner was largely about managing and overseeing the agency of more than 2,000 nonpartisan staff members. Her predecessor, William Beach, is a member of the Friends group and was appointed by Mr. Trump during the president\u2019s first term. \u201cThe totally groundless firing of Dr. Erika McEntarfer, my successor as commissioner of labor statistics at B.L.S., sets a dangerous precedent and undermines the statistical mission of the bureau,\u201d he said on Friday.",

  "summary": "President Trump has proposed plans to build a $200 million, 90,000-square-foot state ballroom off the East Wing of the White House, one of the largest renovations to the historic building in decades. Experts on historic preservation are raising concerns over the feasibility of the project, which is expected to be completed before the end of his term in 2029. The White House is exempt from the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, which requires federal agencies to assess and mitigate adverse effects to historic properties and consult through a formal review process. However, experts believe that the project could harm the property over all due to its scale and lack of checks and balances on preservation. Despite these concerns, the administration insists it is committed to preserving the special history of the building.",

      "text": "The Republican megabill now before the Senate cuts taxes for high earners and reduces benefits for the poor. If it\u2019s enacted, that combination would make it more regressive than any major tax or entitlement law in decades.\nThe bill as passed by the House in May would raise after-tax incomes for the highest-earning 10 percent of American households on average by 2.3 percent a year over the next decade, while lowering incomes for the poorest tenth by 3.9 percent, according to new estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.\nThe shape of that distribution is rare: Tax cut packages have seldom left the poor significantly worse off. And bills that cut the safety net usually haven\u2019t also included benefits for the rich. By inverting those precedents, congressional Republicans have created a bill unlike anything Washington has produced since deficit fears began to loom large in the 1990s.\n\u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything that simultaneously really goes after poor people and then really helps rich people,\u201d said Chuck Marr, the vice president for federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\nTo the extent that some prior bills have also been regressive, they still haven\u2019t looked quite like this.\nRegressive bills | Bottom 20% | Top 20% | |\n|---|---|---|---|\n2025 | Current G.O.P. bill | Lose | Gain |\n2017 | Obamacare repeal* | Lose | Gain |\n1997 | Tax and budget acts | Unclear | Gain |\n1996 | Welfare act | Lose | No change |\nProgressive bills | Bottom 20% | Top 20% | |\n2022 | Inflation Reduction Act | Gain | Lose |\n2021 | Build Back Better* | Gain | Lose |\n2010 | Affordable Care Act | Gain | Lose |\n1993 | Clinton budget act | Gain | Lose |\n1990 | H.W.

Bush tax cuts | Gain | Gain most |\nThe calculations the C.B.O. published are what\u2019s known as a distributional analysis. This type of study estimates how legislation will affect people across the income distribution, taking into account the taxes they pay and the government benefits they receive. Lawmakers often think about legislation in terms of its overall effects: Does it raise or lower the deficit? Does it grow or stifle the economy? But this kind of analysis helps illustrate who benefits and who is hurt by a bill.\n\u201cUltimately, people care about who are the winners and who are the losers,\u201d said Alan Auerbach, a professor of economics and law at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied fiscal policy for decades.\nStephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, dismissed the C.B.O.\u2019s analysis as missing who those winners are in the bigger picture.\n\u201cThe best way to help workers across the income distribution, including all the folks in the bottom, is to create an environment in which firms want to hire them,\u201d he said, pointing to rising wages and low unemployment after the passage of the major tax cut package during the first Trump administration. He disputed that low-wage workers would now be hurt in this bill by changes to Medicaid and food assistance.\nTo put the current bill in context, we have assembled similar analyses of major tax and social welfare bills from the last four decades.\nThe analyses below aren\u2019t all exactly the same. Most were originally published around the time each bill was debated in Congress. They were produced by a few different analysts, because no one group has routinely published distributional tables. They don\u2019t always cover every provision in every bill, which means some charts may be missing a few relevant effects. They evaluated slightly different time windows after enactment. In cases where we lacked complete data, we have not shown a complete chart, but instead characterized a bill\u2019s effects on the highest- and lowest-income households.\nCompared with other legislation, this bill is notable because it\u2019s so regressive \u2014 while neither reducing the deficit nor supercharging growth, according to analysts across the political spectrum.\n\u201cThis bill definitely compromises too much on growth, and it doesn\u2019t make smart use of tax cuts either,\u201d said Erica York, vice president for federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, a research group that generally favors lower taxes. \u201cIf you look at the revenue cost, it\u2019s really large. If you look at the economic impact, it\u2019s not that meaningful.\u201d\nRegressive bills\nSince 1990, there have been a couple of other major bills that leave the poor worse off, but they differ from the current proposal in key ways.\nThe current bill cuts health care spending, food assistance and other programs that benefit the poor, in addition to extending tax cuts for individuals that passed in 2017. Those 2017 tax changes, on average, benefited all income groups, but were skewed toward higher earners. New tax policies in the current bill would shift those benefits up the income scale even more. And some new tax provisions that would help lower-income households \u2014 like no tax on tips and no tax on overtime \u2014 would expire after a few years, while many benefits for high earners would be made lasting.\n\u201cThat makes this specific episode kind of exceptional,\u201d said Owen Zidar, a Princeton economist. \u201cWe just don\u2019t usually have big tax cuts running in different directions from the bottom than at the top.\u201d\nMr. Zidar noted that one tax provision that mostly benefits the rich \u2014 an expansion of the tax deduction for certain types of business income \u2014 is estimated to cost about as much as the bill\u2019s major reductions in Medicaid spending would save.\nThe legislation that looks the most like the current bill is the Republican effort to repeal and replace Obamacare in 2017. A bill that passed the House would have reduced spending on Medicaid for the poor and would have redistributed tax credits for health insurance up the income scale. It also would have reduced the federal deficit, whereas the 2025 House-passed bill is projected to add about $3 trillion to it over the next decade, when interest is included. The 2017 repeal bill, which was unpopular with the public, did not become law.\nLike the repeal effort, the current bill includes big cuts to Medicaid and changes to Obamacare marketplaces that would disadvantage lower-income workers.\nA pair of bipartisan bills enacted together in 1997, the Balanced Budget Act and the Taxpayer Relief Act, were designed to balance the federal budget. The legislation aimed to limit growth in Medicare expenses and created the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program and the Child Tax Credit. The tax package also included other tax cuts that helped higher-income families. Hard-to-measure changes to health programs, such as reduced payments to hospitals that treat Medicaid patients, left its full effect on the poor less clear.\nThe welfare reform reconciliation bill passed in 1996 did appear at the time to reduce after-tax incomes for poor Americans.\n\u201cPeople are likening this to welfare reform,\u201d said Diane Whitmore Schanzenbach, a professor of human development and social policy at Northwestern University. But she added that they\u2019re quite different, for one major reason: \u201cThat \u201996 bill was not tied to big tax cuts for anybody else.\u201d\nProgressive bills\nBudget bills with the opposite shape \u2014 larger gains at the bottom and tax increases at the top \u2014 have tended to come during Democratic presidencies.\nThe Biden administration oversaw several such bills. The Inflation Reduction Act, passed in 2022, expanded clean energy subsidies and health insurance subsidies for the middle class, and paid for the changes partly with reductions on prescription drug prices. Our chart shows the distributional effects in the first year after passage. By the end of the decade, the bill\u2019s effects were projected to become less progressive, since the insurance subsidies are scheduled to expire at the end of this year.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act was a scaled-back version of \u201cBuild Back Better,\u201d President Biden\u2019s signature domestic policy priority that never became law. It would have expanded social spending, benefiting lower-income Americans, and paid for much of it through higher taxes on corporations and high earners. Many of the proposed benefits for low-income Americans \u2014 including for child care, paid family leave and home health care \u2014 are not reflected in the chart, suggesting that this group may have gained even more than what\u2019s shown.\nThe 2010 Affordable Care Act passed under President Barack Obama vastly expanded spending on health care for poor and middle-class Americans, and paid for it through higher payroll taxes on high earners, taxes on expensive employer health insurance and cuts to Medicare spending on hospitals and private insurance. While no one published a formal distributional analysis of the bill around the time it passed, several subsequent studies have measured its effects. Ultimately, several of the taxes that were originally projected to help reduce the deficit were repealed, mostly during the first Trump administration.\nA 1993 budget bill under Bill Clinton combined spending cuts with additional tax increases, particularly for the wealthy. It also increased the earned-income tax credit.\nThe bill George H.W. Bush signed into law in 1990 raised taxes across the board, but boosted the earned-income tax credit for low-income workers.\nRegressive bills that would benefit all groups\nSeveral presidents have signed major tax cut bills that benefited Americans across the income spectrum while vastly increasing the deficit.\n\u201cOn average, that\u2019s been the pattern: that big tax cut bills help everyone,\u201d said Benjamin Page, a senior fellow with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, which produced many of the analyses shown here.\nThe bill before Congress today, which breaks that pattern, extends many provisions of major tax legislation passed during President Trump\u2019s first term, which are set to expire at the end of the year. The benefits of that bill also skewed toward the wealthy, although to a lesser degree than the current bill.\nIn 2013, President Obama extended most of the tax cuts that had passed under George W. Bush and were due to expire. But the bipartisan tax bill he oversaw eliminated a tax cut for top earners.\nThe original major tax cut bills from the George W. Bush administration delivered an even greater share of benefits to the highest earners than the current bill would. But unlike the Trump bill, the Bush tax cut did not cut benefits to the poor. That made the laws regressive, but no group looked worse off.\nThe cases of emergency stimulus\nOne other major category of bills has come during times of acute economic stress, when the government temporarily increases spending, often disproportionately aimed at providing assistance to the poor. This happened during the Great Recession in the late 2000s and the Covid pandemic. Those major stimulus bills had no losing group.\nDistributional data is limited in showing the full effects of the 2009 Obama stimulus and the 2021 American Rescue Plan, the largest of several pandemic relief bills. Both increased funding for unemployed workers, expanded spending on health care and made investments in infrastructure.\nThose bills made an explicit trade-off that it was worth adding to the deficit during a time of crisis. But no such trade-off exists today: The 2025 bill, in addition to its regressivity, adds to the deficit amid a much healthier economy."

      "text": "Press Release\nPublic Affairs Section, U.S. Embassy Beijing\nAnjialou Road 55, Chaoyang District, Beijing, China 100600\nTel: 8531-3000 / Fax: 8531-4848\nApril 2, 2025\nDon\u2019t Risk Your Future: The United States Cracks Down on Illegal Immigration\nTo make America safe, strong, and prosperous, President Trump is ensuring that U.S. immigration laws are followed. If you try to enter the United States illegally, lie to get a visa, work without legal permission, or stay in the United States after your visa or visa waiver period expires, you will face serious penalties. These include jail time, deportation, and a permanent ban on obtaining a U.S. visa in the future.\nThe U.S. is working closely with many other countries, including China, to enforce our immigration laws and counter dangerous snakeheads and human smuggling networks. Since President Trump came back into office, illegal immigrants from all over the globe, including China have been sent back home nearly every day. Breaking the law and putting your life at risk is not worth it.\nIf you have family or friends who are in the United States illegally, now is the time to tell them to come home.\nTrying to Enter or Remain Illegally Will Get You Caught\nSome people believe they can sneak into the United States and avoid being caught. This is not true. The Trump Administration has strengthened border security and greatly increased the number of illegal aliens being arrested and deported.\nIn February 2025, illegal border crossings dropped 94% compared to February 2024, while arrests of illegal border crossers inside the United States increased by 627%. If you try to cross a U.S. border or remain in the United States illegally, you will be caught, detained, and sent back. You may also be banned from ever returning or face fines and criminal charges.\nU.S. Visa Fraud Has Serious Consequences\nThe U.S. visa process is the most secure in the world. Yet, some people unwisely still try to cheat the system by using fake documents, lying on applications, or staying after their visa expires. These are examples of visa fraud, and it is a serious crime. If you break the law in this way, you will be punished, and you may never be allowed to enter the United States again.\nThe Journey to the U.S. Border is Dangerous\nFor those considering making the dangerous journey to illegally cross into the United States, understand that your safety \u2013 and even your life \u2013 are at risk. Criminal groups, cartels, and human traffickers target illegal migrants, subjecting them to violence, extortion, and assault. Many who attempt the journey never make it to their destination.\nThe United States is working with other countries in the Western Hemisphere to stop and return people trying to enter illegally before they even reach the U.S. border. By securing our borders, we are not only protecting American citizens but also preventing the suffering caused by illegal immigration.\nPresident Trump is Holding Everyone Accountable\nThe United States government is also taking action against those who help others enter the country illegally. This includes smugglers, human traffickers and even foreign government officials who allow illegal immigration to continue.\nRecently, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a new visa restriction policy for foreign officials \u2013 including immigration, customs, and port authority staff \u2013 who fail to help stop illegal immigration. This builds on similar existing restrictions for those in the transportation and tourism industries. Those who threaten U.S. security by facilitating illegal immigration are not welcome in our country.\nThe Choice is Clear \u2013 Follow the Law\nThe risks of trying to illegally immigrate to the United States far outweigh any potential benefits. You could lose your life, become a victim of criminals, or end up with a record that damages your future and your family\u2019s future.\nIllegal entry not only breaks U.S. laws, it is also puts your safety and wellbeing in jeopardy. The penalties are serious: jail time, separation from your family, and permanent bans from re-entering the United States.\nIf you know someone who is in the United States illegally, the best thing you can do for them is encourage them to leave now before they are caught.\nFor everyone, the message is simple: Make the right choice, follow the law, and do not risk your safety, your family, or your future."

      "text": "The White House Announces White House Ballroom Construction to Begin\nWashington, D.C. \u2014 For 150 years, Presidents, Administrations, and White House Staff have longed for a large event space on the White House complex that can hold substantially more guests than currently allowed. President Donald J. Trump has expressed his commitment to solving this problem on behalf of future Administrations and the American people.\nThe White House is one of the most beautiful and historic buildings in the world, yet the White House is currently unable to host major functions honoring world leaders and other countries without having to install a large and unsightly tent approximately 100 yards away from the main building entrance. The White House State Ballroom will be a much-needed and exquisite addition of approximately 90,000 total square feet of ornately designed and carefully crafted space, with a seated capacity of 650 people \u2014 a significant increase from the 200-person seated capacity in the East Room of the White House.\nIn recent weeks, President Trump has held several meetings with members of the White House Staff, the National Park Service, the White House Military Office, and the United States Secret Service to discuss design features and planning.\nPresident Trump has chosen McCrery Architects as lead architect, which is well-known for their classical architectural design and based in our nation\u2019s capital. CEO Jim McCrery said: \u201cPresidents in the modern era have faced challenges hosting major events at the White House because it has been untouched since President Harry Truman. I am honored that President Trump has entrusted me to help bring this beautiful and necessary renovation to The People\u2019s House, while preserving the elegance of its classical design and historical importance.\u201d\nThe construction team will be headed by Clark Construction, and the engineering team will be led by AECOM.\nThe project will begin in September 2025, and it is expected to be completed long before the end of President Trump\u2019s term.\nPresident Trump, and other patriot donors, have generously committed to donating the funds necessary to build this approximately $200 million dollar structure. The United States Secret Service will provide the necessary security enhancements and modifications.\nThe White House Ballroom will be substantially separated from the main building of the White House, but at the same time, it\u2019s theme and architectural heritage will be almost identical. The site of the new ballroom will be where the small, heavily changed, and reconstructed East Wing currently sits. The East Wing was constructed in 1902 and has been renovated and changed many times, with a second story added in 1942.\nThe White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles said the following: \u201cPresident Trump is a builder at heart and has an extraordinary eye for detail. The President and the Trump White House are fully committed to working with the appropriate organizations to preserving the special history of the White House while building a beautiful ballroom that can be enjoyed by future Administrations and generations of Americans to come.\u201d\nThe White House will continue to provide the American public with updates on this project at whitehouse.gov/visit."

However, experts in historic preservation have raised concerns about the feasibility of such a large-scale project while maintaining the building's historical integrity. The project has sparked debate over the potential impact on the White House's character and the lack of binding recommendations from the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, which advises on preservation matters.",
