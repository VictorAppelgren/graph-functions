  "description": "A High Court ruling in the UK has quashed Wikipedia\u2019s attempt to overturn part of the country\u2019s divisive Online Safety Act. Judges dismissed the Wikimedia Foundation\u2019s challenge to rules that could place the online encyclopaedia under the law\u2019s strictest category of regulation.View on euronews",
  "content": "The UK High Court of London has dismissed a legal challenge brought by the Wikimedia Foundation \u2013 the non-profit organization which operates online encyclopaedia Wikipedia - to the country\u2019s Online Safety Act.\n\nThe UK\u2019s Online Safety Act, which was rolled out this year, imposes strict new requirements on online platforms and has been criticised for its potential to restrict freedom of expression.\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation had filed a lawsuit in the High Court of London against regulations under the Act, arguing that they could impose the strictest obligations on Wikipedia. They brought the challenge under the assumption that it would be labeled as a \u201cCategory 1\u201d platform, which it argues \u201cwould undermine the privacy and safety of Wikipedia\u2019s volunteer contributors, expose the encyclopedia to manipulation and vandalism, and divert essential resources from protecting people and improving Wikipedia.\u201d\n\nAccording to the foundation, if Wikipedia were subject to the so-called \u2018Category 1\u2019 obligations, it could threaten the rights, privacy and safety of its volunteer editors. The foundation argues that their model, in which anyone can contribute without registering personal details, is key to the platform\u2019s breadth of coverage.\n\nIndeed, user verification - one of requirements for Category 1 platforms - \u201ccould expose contributors to data breaches, stalking, lawsuits, or even imprisonment by authoritarian regimes,\u201d Wikimedia Foundation said in a statement.\n\nJudge Jeremy Johnson rejected the Wikimedia Foundation's request on Monday, while specifying that the foundation could bring another legal challenge if the regulator Ofcom \u201cwrongly concluded that Wikipedia falls under Category 1.\u201d\n\nYou can read the ruling here.\n\nJudge Johnson added that despite the rejection, the ruling \"does not give Ofcom and the Secretary of State a green light to implement a regime that would significantly impede Wikipedia\u2019s operations.\u201d\n\nStill, the government told the BBC it welcomed the High Court's judgment, \"which will help us continue our work implementing the Online Safety Act to create a safer online world for everyone\".\n\nFree speech advocates and content creators have denounced the overly broad application of the Online Safety Act, while the British government claims that the law aims to protect children and remove illegal content.",

      "text": "Online encyclopedia Wikipedia will argue this week that the UK\u2019s Online Services Act could impact the safety and privacy of its volunteers.\nThe foundation behind the crowdsourced information site Wikipedia will argue in British court this week that new legislation threatens its operations.\nThe Wikimedia Foundation will tell London\u2019s Royal Courts of Justice on July 22nd that the regulations under the UK\u2019s Online Safety Act (OSA) put it at \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d of being subject to Category 1 duties as a \u201chigh-risk site\u201d.\nWebsites with this designation have many more responsibilities under the OSA than their peers, including the need to verify their contributors.\nThat would mean Wikipedia would have to identify the \u201cthousands\u201d of Wikipedia volunteers in the UK that edit and contribute to its pages, something which would \u201cundermine the[ir] privacy and safety\u201d.\nIt could also expose the website\u2019s contributors to \u201cdata breaches, stalking, lawsuits or even imprisonment by authoritarian regimes,\u201d the Wikimedia Foundation wrote in a statement.\nStephen LaPorte, general counsel at the Wikimedia Foundation, said in a press release that the court could set \u201ca global precedent for protecting public interest projects online,\u201d if it rules favourably in this case.\nWikimedia says the lawsuit is the last step after several years of engagement with British lawmakers in an attempt to fix the scope of the regulations.\nWhat is the case arguing?\nThe case is not being launched against the OSA in general, just a small set of additional regulations called the Categorisation Regulations.\n\u201cWe do not dispute the need for sensible online regulation \u2026 but for services like Wikipedia to thrive, it is essential that new laws do not endanger charities and public interest projects,\u201d Phil Bradley-Schmieg, Wikimedia\u2019s lead counsel, wrote in a blog post.\nAs a \u201cCategory 1\u201d site under the regulations, Wikipedia is then subjected to many \u201cburdensome\u201d requirements that it argues will affect the quality of its site, Bradley-Schmieg added.\nHe argued that the regulations, along with a sister piece of legislation, could force \u201cpotentially malicious\u201d users to block any unverified users from fixing or removing content they post.\nThis could result in \u201csignificant amounts of vandalism, disinformation or abuse going unchecked on Wikipedia,\u201d the blog post added.\nWikipedia also relies on a \u201ccontent recommender system\u201d or algorithm to suggest what sites a user could be interested in, which Bradley-Schmieg believes is enough to land them \u201cCategory 1\u201d status.\nWhat that means is some of their tools that use algorithms to fight \u201charmful content,\u201d like the New Pages Feed that keeps track of pages that are ready to be reviewed or Translation Recommendations, which help their volunteers translate text, could be at risk.\nThe regulations also designate Category 1 sites as those that receive more than 34 million monthly views. Wikipedia gets 11 billion global views a month (Wikipedia puts this number at 15 billion) with 844 million of them coming from the UK, according to web analytics website Analyzify.\nThe OSA regulations \u201cseemingly do not differentiate between users who visit the site just once a month \u2026 versus those who spend hours each day \u2018doomscrolling\u2019 potentially harmful content on social media,\u201d Bradley-Schmieg argued."

      "text": "Wikipedia loses challenge against Online Safety Act verification rules\nWikipedia has lost a legal challenge to new Online Safety Act rules which it says could threaten the human rights and safety of its volunteer editors.\nThe Wikimedia Foundation - the non-profit which supports the online encyclopaedia - wanted a judicial review of regulations which could mean Wikipedia has to verify the identities of its users.\nBut it said despite the loss, the judgement \"emphasized the responsibility of Ofcom and the UK government to ensure Wikipedia is protected\".\nThe government told the BBC it welcomed the High Court's judgment, \"which will help us continue our work implementing the Online Safety Act to create a safer online world for everyone\".\nJudicial reviews challenge the lawfulness of the way in which a decision has been made by a public body.\nIn this case the Wikimedia Foundation and a Wikipedia editor tried to challenge the way in which the government decided to make regulations covering which sites should be classed \"Category 1\" under the Online Safety Act - the strictest rules sites must follow.\nIt argued the rules were logically flawed and too broad, meaning a policy intended to impose extra rules on large social media companies would instead apply to Wikipedia.\nIn particular the foundation is concerned the extra duties required - if Wikipedia was classed as Category 1 - would mean it would have to verify the identity of its contributors, undermining their privacy and safety.\nThe only way it could avoid being classed as Category 1 would be to cut the number of people in the UK who could access the online encyclopaedia by about three-quarters, or disable key functions on the site.\nThe government's lawyers argued that ministers had considered whether Wikipedia should be exempt from the regulations but had reasonably rejected the idea.\n'Left the door open'\nIn the end, the court rejected Wikimedia's arguments.\nBut Phil Bradley-Schmieg, Lead Counsel at the Wikimedia Foundation, said the judgment did not give Ofcom and the Secretary of State, in Mr Justice Johnson's words, \"a green light to implement a regime that would significantly impede Wikipedia's operations\".\nAnd the judgement makes it clear other legal challenges could be possible.\nWikimedia could potentially challenge Ofcom's decision making if the regulator did ultimately decide to classify the site as Category 1.\nAnd if the effect of making Wikipedia Category 1 meant it could not continue to operate, then other legal challenges could follow.\n\"Wikipedia has been caught in the stricter regulations due to its size and user created content even though it argues (convincingly) that it differs significantly from other user-to-user platforms,\" said Mona Schroedel, data protection litigation specialist at law firm Freeths.\n\"The court's decision has left the door open for Wikipedia to be exempt from the stricter rules upon review.\"\nThe communications regulator Ofcom, which will enforce the act, told the BBC: \"We note the court's judgment and will continue to progress our work in relation to categorised services and the associated extra online safety rules for those companies.\""

  "argos_summary": "The UK High Court has dismissed a legal challenge by the Wikimedia Foundation against the Online Safety Act, which could classify Wikipedia as a 'Category 1' platform, imposing strict verification requirements on its contributors. The Wikimedia Foundation argued that such regulations would threaten the privacy and safety of its volunteer editors, potentially exposing them to risks like data breaches and legal repercussions. Despite the court's ruling, it noted that the Wikimedia Foundation could pursue further legal action if Ofcom incorrectly categorizes Wikipedia, leaving open the possibility for future challenges regarding the Act's application.",
