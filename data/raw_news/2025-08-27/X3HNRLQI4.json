  "content": "Webull Corporation BULL aims to highlight recent wins in cryptocurrency and its evolution since going public, as the company reports second-quarter financial results on Thursday after the market close.\n\nWebull went public in April after completing a SPAC merger. Shares soared after their debut with the company, among the top trending names among retail traders for weeks after the market debut.\n\nSince going public, shares have pulled back and investors and analysts now look to company announcements and financial results to show the investment case for the company moving forward.\n\nThere are no current analyst estimates for the company's second-quarter financial results.\n\nIn the first quarter, Webull reported revenue of $117.37 million, up 32% year-over-year. The company also reported a loss of 6 cents per share, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\n\nWebull said the revenue growth came from account growth and higher trading volumes. In the first quarter, total customer assets were up 45% year-over-year, with registered users hitting 24.1 million, up 17% year-over-year.\n\nRead Also: Retail Investors\u2019 Top Stocks With Q2 Earnings This Week: NVIDIA, Webull, IREN And More\n\nWhat to Watch in Q2 Results\n\nInvestors and analysts will be looking for updates on revenue and earnings per share, while other key metrics like assets on the platform and registered users could show healthy growth going forward.\n\n\"We will remain focused on broadening our product portfolio, introducing new asset classes, and expanding access to customers globally,\" Webull U.S. CEO Anthony Denier said after first quarter results.\n\nCryptocurrency will be a major topic for the company in its results and management commentary. After previously pausing its cryptocurrency trading, Webull re-launched in Brazil in June and recently re-launched in the U.S. this week.\n\nWebull offers cryptocurrency trading in the U.S., featuring more than 50 different cryptocurrencies. The list includes the big names like Bitcoin BTC/USD and Ethereum ETH/USD and also popular smaller cryptos like Dogecoin DOGE/USD, Pudgy Penguin Coin PENGU/USD, Official Trump Coin TRUMP/USD and Pepe Coin PEPE/USD.\n\nThe U.S. trading platform also allows users to buy and sell stocks, options, and cryptocurrency on the same platform, whereas previously, crypto was a separate app.\n\nThe reintroduction of cryptocurrency trading comes with improved regulatory clarity, according to the company. The company said previously that it expects to launch cryptocurrency trading in more markets later this year. Investors and analysts could get an update on that front on Thursday.\n\nBULL Price Action: Webull shares were down 2.83% at $14.57 at the time of publication on Wednesday, pulling back 7.28% this month but still up 10.00% since the start of the year.

      "text": "Supercharge Your Trading With Benzinga Tools\nRecent Earning News\nEarnings rank as one of the most important fundamental elements that determine a company\u2019s stock price. The earnings of a company refers to its after-tax net income, which can give you a good indication of the company\u2019s future profitability.\nA company\u2019s earnings numbers depict its profitability over a certain period of time, typically a year or a quarterly 3-month period. Most analysts use quarterly earnings as a benchmark to assess a company\u2019s performance.\nThe deviation of earnings from the analyst consensus, also known as the \u201cearnings call\u201d or \u201cconference call\u201d, can have a notable impact on a company\u2019s stock price. The release of better-than-expected earnings numbers should prompt a rally in a stock\u2019s price but the price can sometimes decline as market participants take profits. Remember, too, that an earnings report is paired with other figures and news items to help investors make wise decisions.\nWhat is an Earnings Calendar?\nAn earnings calendar shows the date and time of upcoming financial results of public companies. Analysts, traders and investors keep track of earnings releases by using an earnings calendar. Earnings calendars help traders and investors track the financial performance of the companies and make investment decisions.\nEvery earnings announcement will have different implications for the stock market, and taking note of all the earnings dates for your assets helps you remain abreast of changes in your portfolio. For example, if you have invested in Tesla and the firm plans to increase vehicle production, you need to know. If the share price is lagging and the firm plans a buyback, you need to know that.\nIf an asset in which you invest is correlated with the price of crude oil, you need to hear what the executive team thinks about the oil market.\nThe earnings calendar typically also gives market consensus estimates. Analysts, traders and investors can use this data to make or compare their own projections. It also helps market participants plan their strategies for the earnings release date in advance.\nHow Are Earnings Calculated?\nNet earnings refer to the earnings of a company relevant to its stock price. Net earnings consist of the amount of income earned after mandatory deductions and withholding like federal income tax and money withheld from employees through the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA).\nNet earnings equal the sales or revenue of the company minus the cost of sales, expenses, deductions and taxes and get computed over a specific period of time, such as a quarter or year.\nAn example: Consider a company with gross sales of $1,000,000 over a 1-year period. Subtract from that number the cost of goods sold: $600,000, the company\u2019s operating expenses: $160,000, and its tax payments: $40,000 \u2014 a total of $800,000 for that same period.\nThis leaves the company with a net income, profit or earnings amount of $200,000 for the year.\nEarnings reflect the overall financial performance of the company and factor into computing the key earnings per share (EPS) metric that provides an indicator of a company\u2019s profitability. Earnings per share means the company\u2019s profit/loss attributes to each shareholder of the company.\n- General accepted account principles (GAAP) EPS: Calculated by dividing the net income by the number of shares outstanding.\n- Adjusted EPS: Calculated by excluding nonrecurring items from net income and dividing by the number of shares outstanding.\nTwo other types of earnings that are generally reported on a company\u2019s financial statement:\n- Accumulated earnings: Net profits made by a corporation not disbursed to shareholders as dividends but retained and reinvested in the company instead.\n- Retained earnings: Listed as ownership or equity in the company. Retained earnings consist of the total net income of the company over the company\u2019s life that has not been distributed to shareholders. Shareholders can get these funds via a dividend.\nWhy Are Earnings Important?\nEarnings are one of the most important metrics for the valuation of a company\u2019s stock. They can strongly impact a publicly traded company\u2019s stock price because investors base their investment decisions on the company\u2019s recent earnings and their expectations for its future earnings.\nEarnings are often a key factor in investment decisions like whether to hold, buy or sell shares in the company. They also help investors estimate the short and long term performance of the company and identify whether a company is suitable for the portfolio based on investment objectives.\nNew companies and those that report negative earnings may appear at first glance to be high-risk investments. Keep in mind, however, that some highly successful companies like Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) started out with years of negative earnings before turning profitable.\nCompanies that have recently gone public (and have a new and engaging product or service) also typically go through a period of negative earnings before they become profitable. Insightful investors often buy up these promising stocks despite the fact that the associated companies show negative earnings. If a company eventually begins to make money, the associated rise in share price will generally justify their initial investment with increased capital gains on their stock.\nOther important metrics:\n- Earnings per share (EPS): A metric that provides a key indicator of a company\u2019s profitability. Earnings per share means the company\u2019s profit/loss attributable to each shareholder of the company.\n- Total revenue: Total revenue reveals the amount of money the company takes in from its sales of either goods or services. Depending on the company\u2019s expenses and other outlays, a rise in total revenue can lead to increased earnings.\n- EBIT: Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) is one of the most important metrics stock analysts consider because it takes into account the company\u2019s net income before deducted interest and taxes. Many analysts consider the EBIT growth as more important than total revenue growth since it provides a broader picture of the company\u2019s profitability.\n- Price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio or PER): This important metric gives you an idea of whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued in relation to its earnings. A high P/E ratio could mean that a company\u2019s stock is currently overvalued or that expectations of higher earnings are already included in the stock\u2019s current price. A low PER could indicate either that the stock is undervalued or that the company\u2019s business model cannot sustain higher earnings, so its share price has fallen although earnings have not been affected yet.\nDepending on the type of stock, the PER could be extremely high but is considered justified by the market due to the company\u2019s future prospects and/or high rate of growth. For example, tech and biotech stocks typically carry a high PER due to investor expectations of substantial future profitability.\nIs it Better to Buy Stocks Before or After Earnings?\nDeciding whether to buy stock before or after an earnings release depends on your investment objectives. For example, if you are a short term trader and want to make a quick profit, then you might buy before the earnings release to speculate on significant stock movement occurring on earnings day.\nOn the other hand, if you are a long-term investor, then you might wait for the earnings to include the latest earnings into your investment model so that you can better estimate the company\u2019s long-term performance.\nMany stocks go through a period of low activity ahead of announcing earnings. This makes sense since institutional investors typically prefer to wait for a positive earnings release before committing more capital.\nAs a rule of thumb, many investors avoid buying shares ahead of an earnings release because of the uncertainty and extra risk involved. An exception could involve using an option strategy to establish a limited risk position in a stock that could also benefit from increased market volatility.\nCompanies generally release earnings before or after the market closes. If released before the opening, the earnings result typically increases the volatility of the stock during the day of its release. If earnings are released after the market closes, the stock price may show increased volatility in the after market, but this usually normalizes by the time the market opens the next day.\nWhen a Company Beats Expected Earnings\nAccording to general market theory, a favorable earnings release that beats the analyst consensus should have a positive impact on the company\u2019s stock price, while an unfavorable release should have a negative impact.\nFor example, if a company announces better quarterly earnings than the analyst consensus expected, then the company\u2019s stock price generally increases. Conversely, if the company announces earnings that fall short of analyst expectations, then the company\u2019s stock comes under selling pressure.\nWhile this makes perfect sense to most people, this generality does not always occur for a number of reasons. Sometimes the price can go down even though a company beats the expected earnings.\n- For example, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) might beat analysts\u2019 EPS estimation but miss their number of iPhone sales estimation. In another instance, Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) might beat the market\u2019s consensus EPS estimation but miss its subscriber growth expectation. In both cases, the stock price might decline despite an unexpected rise in earnings.\n- Another reason for a diverging stock price from a positive or negative earnings release are the rumors spread among savvy market participants ahead of the release. Such rumors can prompt traders and investors to take positions in advance of the official earnings announcement.\n- For example, a company\u2019s stock might rally significantly before a better than expected earnings release but subsequently sells off after the release. You can attribute this to the market having responded to the favorable news spread as a rumor by already discounting it by the time the earnings actually become known to the general public. This is the reasoning behind the old Wall Street adage of \u201cbuy the rumor, sell the fact.\u201d\nFurthermore, the hype generated by public expectations leading up to the day of the better than expected earnings release can also spark technical buying in the stock ahead of the release. Once the earnings have been made public, shareholders take profits by selling the stock they had previously purchased ahead of the earnings release date, thereby causing the stock price to perhaps surprisingly decline on the good news.\nThis common scenario can also arise when a company releases lower than expected earnings. In the case of a lower-than-expected earnings call, the stock can subsequently rally as short sellers take profits and investors interpret the negative news as a buying opportunity.\nHow to Make Money Trading the Earnings Calendar\nThe earnings calendar shows when each company is due to release their quarterly earnings press releases. The stock price ideally goes up when a company beats earnings estimates and goes down when it misses estimates, although exceptions do exist.\n- As the earnings date approaches, traders and investors can focus on how closely the analyst consensus for the reported earnings matches the actual number by looking at the earnings beat or miss on the earnings day.\n- Many stock operators also examine a company\u2019s history of earnings releases. If the company has consistently beaten analyst estimates over several quarters and the stock has rallied on each of the earnings releases and a positive release is expected, then the trader or investor can feel confident in a decision to buy the stock before the earnings release.\n- Other ways to profit from an earnings release with limited risk is to purchase options. A straddle or strangle involving the purchase of both a put and a call could be profitable if the volatility increases as the earnings date approaches.\nThe upside of this type of bidirectional option strategy is that the buyer of the straddle stands to make money regardless of the direction the stock may take after the earnings are released, as long as the move is significant and implied volatility does not collapse before they can trade out of the position.\nWhen is Earnings Season?\nEarnings season means the time when many large publicly traded companies report their financial results. Federal securities laws require companies to disclose information and file financial statements within 45 days of the end of a financial quarter or year.\nThe time period that corresponds to earnings season therefore comes around every quarter. It typically begins 1 or 2 weeks after the end of the last month of each quarter in March, June, September and December."

      "text": "- Shares of Webull are trading lower Monday afternoon.\n- The company detailed a new committed equity financing agreement in an SEC filing on Friday.\n- See the seasonal trading strategy that's beating the S&P 500 by 6X this year. Details here \u2192\nShares of Webull Corp BULL are trading lower Monday afternoon after the company detailed a new committed equity financing agreement in an SEC filing on Friday. While the deal provides significant potential capital, it also raises concerns about shareholder dilution.\nWhat To Know: The filing outlines a standby equity purchase agreement with an affiliate of Yorkville Advisors. Under the agreement, Webull has the right, but not the obligation, to sell up to $1 billion of its Class A ordinary shares to the investor over a 36-month period. The shares would be sold at a 2.5% discount to the market price.\nWebull is registering the potential resale of over 75 million shares by the investor, which the filing notes represents approximately 15.5% of Webull\u2019s total ordinary shares currently outstanding.\nThe prospectus warns that the sale of these shares, or the perception that sales could occur, \u201ccould result in a significant decline in the public trading price of our securities\u201d.\nThis news followed a more positive announcement last Thursday, when Webull detailed its plan to reintroduce cryptocurrency trading for its global customers. The company is reintegrating its Webull Pay subsidiary and intends to launch crypto trading services in the United States in the third quarter.\nPrice Action: According to data from Benzinga Pro, BULL shares are trading lower by 7.4% to $15.64 Monday afternoon. The stock has a 52-week high of $79.56 and a 52-week low of $10.18.\nRead Also: Ethereum Is At The Forefront Of The Financial Services Revolution, Bernstein Says\nHow To Buy BULL Stock\nBy now you're likely curious about how to participate in the market for Webull \u2013 be it to purchase shares, or even attempt to bet against the company.\nBuying shares is typically done through a brokerage account. You can find a list of possible trading platforms here. Many will allow you to buy \u201cfractional shares,\u201d which allows you to own portions of stock without buying an entire share.\nIn the case of Webull, which is trading at $16.02 as of publishing time, $100 would buy you 6.24 shares of stock.\nIf you're looking to bet against a company, the process is more complex. You'll need access to an options trading platform, or a broker who will allow you to \u201cgo short\u201d a share of stock by lending you the shares to sell. The process of shorting a stock can be found at this resource. Otherwise, if your broker allows you to trade options, you can either buy a put option, or sell a call option at a strike price above where shares are currently trading \u2013 either way it allows you to profit off of the share price decline.\nImage: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
