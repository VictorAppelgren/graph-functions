  "title": "The Small Business Technology Gap, And How To Bridge It",
  "description": "What must we do to close the technology gap, increase competitiveness, and help small businesses grow in a rapidly changing digital marketplace?",
  "content": "There\u2019s a lot of talk right now about how AI and digital tools are transforming construction and manufacturing, and big firms are already there, deepening an already troubling technology gap for small businesses. Larger firms are using 5D project modeling, AI-based scheduling, and digital control centers to keep complex jobs on track. And it\u2019s paying off. By some estimates, these tools are shaving months off major builds and helping companies manage risk, labor, and materials more effectively.\n\nBut most small businesses don\u2019t have access to these tools. And even if they did, they don\u2019t have the time or training to make them useful. In fact, a from Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices (10ksb Voices), of which I am a member, found that 42% of small businesses do not have access to the resources and expertise necessary to successfully deploy AI.\n\nSmall construction firms, tradespeople, specialty manufacturers, and independent contractors are being locked out of the new digital landscape\u2014not because they lack skill, but because they\u2019re stuck operating in analog while their competitors have moved to digital. This isn\u2019t just a technology gap. It\u2019s an access gap: a very real barrier between having technology available on paper and being able to afford, train for, and apply it.\n\nAs James M. Gordon, Managing Partner, Global CULTIVA, and a fellow member of the 10ksb Voices community, puts it: \u201cOnce small companies are made aware of new technologies, they can adopt and innovate with them very quickly, sometimes even faster than large enterprises. We don\u2019t have the bureaucratic layers that slow bigger firms down. That agility is a key advantage.\u201d If the past is predictive, then the future of infrastructure, manufacturing, and clean energy depends on small business involvement. But if we actually want that to be true, we must make it possible.\n\nBig projects increasingly require digital documentation, scheduling alignment, and full traceability across the entire supply chain. When small businesses serve as suppliers to larger enterprises, they are increasingly required to hold specific quality, compliance, or cybersecurity certifications\u2014such as ISO, AS9100, or NIST standards. Achieving and maintaining these certifications is extremely difficult without digital systems in place. Paper-based or outdated processes make it nearly impossible to demonstrate the level of traceability, documentation control, and operational consistency that certification bodies and enterprise buyers expect.\n\nAs a result, small businesses that still rely on paper timesheets, handwritten specifications, or siloed spreadsheets are unlikely to win those contracts\u2014not due to the quality of their work, but because they aren't integrated into the digital systems larger contractors now demand.\n\nThis is where policy should step in. It shouldn\u2019t just fund innovation at the top\u2014it should open the pipeline at the bottom. That could mean shared access to digital tools through trade associations or local business hubs. It could mean practical grants\u2014not risky innovation grants, but nuts-and-bolts support for upgrading systems, hiring tech-savvy staff, or getting certified to bid on projects that require digital coordination.\n\nClosing this access gap requires more than awareness. It needs deliberate policy action. Earlier this year, Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices and the Bipartisan Policy Center released a playbook of policies to support small business innovation and growth . That playbook includes three recommendations that would directly help close this gap:\n\u2022 Ensure Resource Providers Are Equipped to Offer Training and Guidance on Digitalization and AI\n\n Updating existing and establishing new resources would help small business owners get the support needed to adopt digital tools and integrate AI into their operations.\n\u2022 Promote AI Literacy Skills and Education for Small Businesses\n\n Policymakers, alongside private-sector partners, can promote and expand AI training and reskilling resources through existing bipartisan initiatives to improve and support small business efficiency and growth.\n\u2022 Encourage SBA and Other Agencies to Adopt Digital and AI Tools to Enhance Customer Service\n\n Safe, secure, and responsible adoption of digital and AI technologies would improve the government\u2019s ability to assist small businesses.\n\nLetting Small Businesses in on the Future\n\nMost small business owners aren\u2019t trying to \"digitally transform.\" They\u2019re trying to get the job done, pay their crew, and keep the wheels turning. But the job has changed, and technology increasingly determines who gets to play.\n\nIf we don\u2019t close this technology gap, we\u2019re not just leaving small businesses behind\u2014we\u2019re narrowing the talent pool, weakening our supply chains, and increasing our national risk.\n\nBig business will keep building with or without us. The question is: how will we close the small business technology gap? Are we going to let small businesses in on the future, or not?",

      "text": "Despite uncertainty, 72% say they plan to grow their business in 2025\n(NEW YORK) \u2013 America\u2019s small businesses remain optimistic about their future and growth potential despite uncertainties beyond their control. Small business owners are clear that the lack of access to affordable capital and uncertainties around federal tax and trade policies are creating difficult operating conditions. These are among the key takeaways from the new survey data released today by Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices.\nAmong small business owners who have applied for a business loan or line of credit within the last year, 81% found it difficult to access affordable capital, with 49% having to halt expansions and 41% limited in taking on new business. Fifty-one percent said that with current interest rates they are unable to afford to take out a loan.\nUncertainty around key federal policies \u2013 namely tax and trade \u2013 are leaving small business owners desperate for more predictable operating conditions. Eighty-two percent of small business owners say the current federal tax code creates an unequal playing field between large companies and small businesses, and 70% say the costs they incur related to tax compliance are expensive. Over ninety percent state certainty and predictability in the federal tax code is important to their financial planning success.\nTrade policy is impacting small businesses, with 36% reporting they are currently feeling negative impacts from tariffs and another 38% saying they expect to in the future. Of those feeling or expecting to feel negative impacts, 77% say tariffs will create more uncertainty.\n\u201cOwning and operating a business is a challenge in the best of times, but American small business owners are struggling to navigate the uncertainty around important federal policies and our lack of access to affordable capital to grow,\u201d said Jessica Johnson-Cope, Chair of 10,000 Small Businesses Voices National Leadership Council and President of the Bronx-based Johnson Security Bureau, Inc., a third-generation family-run firm.\nDespite these uncertainties, small business owners maintain a positive outlook. Seventy-five percent are optimistic about the current trajectory of their business, and 72% plan to grow their business in 2025. As small businesses project for the future, artificial intelligence (AI) is a part of their plans: 68% are currently using AI, and 9% plan to begin using it within the next year. Most small businesses state AI is enhancing \u2013 not replacing \u2013 their workforce (65%). Those using AI report increased efficiency and productivity (80%), better data for decision-making (51%), and new capabilities (49%). However, 42% of small businesses do not have access to the resources and expertise necessary to successfully deploy AI.\n\u201cSmall business owners remain remarkably resilient and focused on growth, even as they face significant headwinds,\u201d said Jill McCarthy, national director of Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices. \"This new survey underscores the challenges they face and reinforces the urgent need for their voices to be heard in the policy decisions shaping their future.\u201d\nSmall businesses are feeling like they are an afterthought for Washington. Eighty-six percent do not believe small businesses have enough of a voice in Washington.\nGoldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices conducted this national survey of small business owners who are graduates of the Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses program from May 5-13, 2025. The survey had 1,368 total participants and included small business owners from 47 U.S. states, 2 U.S. territories and the District of Columbia.\n###\nAbout 10,000 Small Businesses Voices\nGoldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Voices, which in April marked its five-year anniversary, builds on Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses and organizes program participants to advocate for policies that matter to them.

      "text": "Bridging the Small Business Technology Access Gap\nTools, Costs, and Skills That Drive Growth\nIf you run a small business, you\u2019ve probably heard more than enough about AI, automation, and \u201cdigital transformation.\u201d What you probably haven\u2019t heard is how to make any of it work for you without derailing your day-to-day operations.\nThe truth is, most small businesses don\u2019t lack the desire to modernize; they lack the access. That access gap shows up in different ways: not enough time to explore new tools, not knowing which tools will actually help, not knowing how to evaluate potential technology partners, concerns about integrating new tools to existing technology, limited budget for technology, and no one on the team who speaks fluent tech.\nClosing that gap doesn\u2019t mean you need to become a technology company. It means making sure you have the right tools, skills, and connections to compete in a marketplace that\u2019s moving quickly. And because technology change is also culture change, it means bringing your people along with you. Even a small technology change can affect how employees feel about their work and how they interact with each other. Involving them in the discussion about what\u2019s needed, how it will be used, and how it will be implemented and trained helps you avoid mistakes that can feel small to you but be deeply disruptive to them.\nKnow the Types of Tools That Move the Needle\nOnce you\u2019ve decided to close the gap, it helps to know which categories of technology can make the biggest difference in your competitiveness and profitability. You don\u2019t have to adopt them all at once, but you should be aware of what\u2019s out there and why it matters.\n- Project Management and Scheduling Tools: Keep work on track, improve coordination between teams, and meet deadlines that bigger clients and contractors demand.\n- Inventory and Supply Chain Management: Reduce carrying costs, improve accuracy, and meet compliance or traceability requirements that can win you more contracts.\n- Customer Relationship Management (CRM): Give your sales and service teams the ability to see the full history with every client, uncover opportunities, and improve retention.\n- Financial and Costing Systems: Help you understand the real costs of delivering products or services, improve pricing decisions, and maintain better cash flow.\n- Collaboration and Communication Platforms: Reduce errors, speed up approvals, and make it easier for remote or hybrid teams to work together effectively.\n- Cybersecurity Tools: Protect your business from costly breaches and qualify you for more contracts by meeting security standards.\n- AI and Automation Solutions: Handle repetitive tasks, improve accuracy, and free your team to focus on work that requires judgment and creativity.\nYour goal is to understand which of these tools will solve your most pressing problems first, and will deliver you a competitive advantage in the process.\nThink in Terms of ROI, Not Just Cost\nA tool that costs $200 a month might feel expensive \u2026 until you realize it saves you 10 hours of labor or closes deals faster. The same is true for a tool that costs $1,400 a month. ROI isn\u2019t just about how much time or money you save. It\u2019s also about the additional revenue you can generate, the customers you can serve better (and keep longer), and the risks you can reduce by doing things more accurately. When you evaluate technology, ask yourself: Will this help me win more business? Will it improve my customer experience? Will it make us faster or more reliable? If the answer is yes, and the numbers pencil out, the price tag becomes much easier to justify.\nDon\u2019t Forget Cost of Ownership\nToo many small businesses focus only on the purchase price or the ease of implementation. But the real question is, what will it cost you to own this system over the long term? That includes subscription or license fees, training, customization, maintenance, and any lost productivity during upgrades or downtime. Sometimes the cheaper option today ends up being the most expensive option over five years. Always factor in the total cost of ownership before making a decision.\nFocus on One Pain Point at a Time\nOnce you\u2019ve looked at ROI and cost of ownership, it\u2019s time to choose your starting point. You don\u2019t have to solve every technology problem at once. Start with the one thing that causes the most delays, errors, or frustration. Maybe that\u2019s project scheduling, customer follow-up, production costing, or inventory tracking. Pick one, and look for tools that fix that specific problem.\nUse What You Already Have\nBefore you buy anything new, explore the full capabilities of the systems you already use. I can\u2019t tell you how often we\u2019re approached by a client who wants to invest in a new technology tool, only to find out they don\u2019t actually need it. We always start by analyzing their current tech stack and looking for opportunities they\u2019ve been missing. Sometimes we even get on the phone with their existing software providers to help them implement more of what they\u2019re already paying for. We\u2019ve lost sales that way, because once the refinements are made, they don\u2019t need to buy new software. But that fits our philosophy, and it creates clients for life. The long view is always more important than the short one.\nBorrow Expertise\nYou don\u2019t need to hire a full-time tech specialist or have an in-house data or IT team to get moving. Lean on trade associations, local business development centers, peer networks \u2026 or us! \u2026 to help you choose and implement tools. Business technology is a specialized area, and the pitfalls are numerous. Getting the help you need to bridge the knowledge gap makes everything go faster, smoother, and ultimately, less costly.\nBuild Digital Skills into Every Job\nTechnology adoption isn\u2019t a one-time event. Rather, think of it as an ongoing practice and skill set. Whether you have two employees or twenty, make sure everyone is learning and practicing basic digital literacy. This makes every future technology change faster, smoother, and less disruptive.\nBridging the technology access gap isn\u2019t about chasing the latest trend. It\u2019s about making sure your business can keep up with, and take advantage of, the way work gets done today. Start small. Build confidence. Include your team in the process. Over time, you\u2019ll turn that \u201cgap\u201d into a competitive advantage.\nAre You Ready to Do Better Growth Management?\nStrategyWerx is all about growth strategy and management.
