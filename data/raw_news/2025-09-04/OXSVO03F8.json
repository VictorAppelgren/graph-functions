  "description": "Apple's next best iPhone will go toe-to-toe with Samsung's Ultra",
  "content": "Apple's next product showcase is set for September 9, and we'll surely see a new iPhone lineup, likely including the iPhone 17 Pro Max, announced on that date.\n\nBut how might Apple's biggest and best iPhone of 2025 line up against the top-of-the-line Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, which is considered by many to be the best Android phone money can buy?\n\nBased on rumors, the two phones appear similar in some ways, but quite different in others. So, in this guide, we've compared the predicted specs of the iPhone 17 Pro Max to what we already know about the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\n\nCameras have always been an important feature of flagship smartphones made by Apple and Samsung, and the latest rumors tell us that the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max could have a 48MP telephoto lens.\n\nThe current iPhone 16 Pro already has a 48MP main and ultra-wide lens, but a 48MP telephoto sensor would mark a step up from the current 12MP telephoto lens.\n\nWe've also been hearing about a possible 24MP front-facing camera for the iPhone 17 Pro, up from the current 12MP lens on the iPhone 16 Pro/Pro Max. Plus, there's a slight possibility that the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max might have a mechanical aperture, which would allow you to change the aperture and depth of field. We also may see support for 8K video recording, as opposed to 4K on the 16 Pro lineup.\n\nOf course, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is no slouch on the camera front. It boasts a 200MP f/1.7 main camera, a 50MP f/3.4 periscope camera (with 5x optical zoom), a 10MP f/2.4 telephoto camera (with 3x optical zoom), a 50MP f/1.9 ultra-wide camera (with a 120-degree field of view), and a 100x Space Zoom lens. The phone's front camera has 12MP and video recording clocks in at UHD 8K (7680 x 4320) at 30fps.\n\nThere's no denying that Samsung is the king of zoom, and is likely to remain so even after the iPhone 17 Pro hits shelves. If you're looking for a powerful distance camera, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the obvious choice.\n\nHowever, iPhones generally tend to balance colors in a more natural way, and that's likely to be true of the iPhone 17 Pro. Plus, you can usually get impressive results when you just point and shoot with an iPhone; with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, there's more of a learning curve.\n\nNumerous leaks indicate that the iPhone 17 Pro Max will sport an A19 Pro chipset, which will allow it to run even smoother and faster than its A18-equipped predecessor. Additionally, the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max might also have 12GB of RAM, up from 8GB in the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Both of these upgrades will likely facilitate a cleaner Apple Intelligence experience on the iPhone 17 Pro Max.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, meanwhile, uses the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, 12GB RAM, and an Octa-Core CPU with speeds up to 3.5GHz. Samsung's well-regarded and powerful Galaxy AI is also baked into this handset.\n\nGoing by previous Apple chipsets, the A19 Pro will match or potentially even surpass the raw power of the Snapdragon 8 Elite, but you'll absolutely get flagship-grade performance from whichever model you choose.\n\nComparing software between iOS and Android is like comparing, well, apples and oranges. Without knowing much about the specific handsets, you probably already know which operating system you prefer. Apple famously keeps you within its walled garden, which can feel either comforting or suffocating, depending on your preferences. Samsung's One UI may not feel as cohesive as iOS, but you will generally have more control over your experience.\n\nIt's worth pointing out that Android is currently ahead of Apple in the AI sphere. Features like Circle to Search, Gemini, and AI image manipulation are more advanced than anything happening in Apple Intelligence at this time, and while Apple will undoubtedly improve the AI experience on the iPhone 17 Pro, we do know that .\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to have a different look from previous iPhone models, with a camera module running across the entire width of the back of the phone. We expect to see at least the same 6.9-inch OLED 1320 x 2868 display (with ProMotion) as on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Storage options will be at least the current 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB.\n\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra has a 6.9-inch 3120 x 1440 (Quad HD+) OLED display, a peak brightness of 2,600 nits, and a 120Hz refresh rate. Storage options are 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB.\n\nOne very different design feature that the Galaxy S25 Ultra has is support for the S Pen, Samsung's built-in stylus. It's a fairly niche accessory, but for those who enjoy drawing or taking notes on their smartphone, it's an attractive option.\n\nApple is reportedly testing the iPhone 17 Pro with reverse wireless charging, which would allow you to charge your AirPods, Apple Watch, and perhaps other smartphones via the phone's rear panel. That doesn't necessarily mean this feature will show up on the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max, but it's possible. The Galaxy S25 Ultra already supports reverse wireless charging up to 4.5W.\n\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max could also have a vapor chamber, which would keep the phones cooler during demanding tasks. Again, this is already a feature of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, allowing the phone to work at peak speeds for longer and deliver impressive battery life.\n\nAs for charging accessory compatibility, the iPhone 17 Pro will almost certainly have true Qi2 magnetic wireless charging support, whereas the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is only \"Qi2-ready\" and requires a special case to work as expected.\n\nPricewise, the two phones are likely to be pretty similar. The 256GB variant of the Galaxy S25 Ultra retails for $1,299 / \u00a31,249 / AU$2,149, the 512GB model for $1,419 / \u00a31,349 / AU$2,349, and the 1TB model for $1,659 / \u00a31,549 / AU$2,749.\n\nAssuming Apple maintains its iPhone 16 Pro Max price structure with this year's model, the iPhone 17 Pro Max will run at $1,199 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,149 for 256GB of storage, $1,399 / \u00a31,399 / AU$2,499 for 512GB, and $1,599 / \u00a31,599 / AU$2,849 for 1TB.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 iPhone 17: latest news and rumors for every expected model\n\u2022 iPhone 17 Pro Max: latest news, rumors, and everything we\u2019ve heard so far",

      "text": "The iPhone 17 Air might come in these 4 colors \u2013 and there's an interesting claim about its chipset too\n- The iPhone 17 Air could be sold in black, silver, light gold, and light blue shades\n- It may also have an A19 Pro chipset, rather than the base A19\n- However, previous leaks disagree with that chipset claim\nIf you\u2019ve got your sights set on the iPhone 17 Air, you can also now start thinking about what color you'd like your slimline iPhone to be, as a new leak has revealed the four shades that Apple will apparently sell the device in.\nAccording to leaker Majin Bu \u2013 citing a previous leak from Fixed Focus Digital which they claim to have now \u201cconfirmed\u201d \u2013 the iPhone 17 Air will be available in black, silver, light gold, and light blue shades.\nThe black shade is apparently a \u201cdark and understated tone\u201d, the silver model is said to be \u201cbright and clear\u201d, the light gold is described as being \u201cwarm and soft\u201d, and the light blue as \u201cvery light\u201d and \u201cevoking a clear sky\u201d.\nYou can see how these colors might look in the image Majin Bu provided above, though it sounds like the shades shown are probably guesses based on how their sources described the colors.\nIn any case, we\u2019d take this information with a pinch of salt \u2013 although the use of mostly quite pale, delicate shades seems fitting for phone that\u2019s likely to be billed as slim and elegant.\nSome surprising chipset news\nIn other iPhone 17 Air news, leaker Fixed Focus Digital (via Phone Arena) has claimed that the handset will have an A19 Pro chipset. That\u2019s at odds with previous leaks, which suggested only the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max would have this chipset, while the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air would have an A19.\nHowever, they added that the iPhone 17 Air will get a version of the A19 Pro with a five-core GPU while the iPhone 17 Pro models will get a six-core version, in which case the Pro models would still have the most powerful chipset.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThey also mention RAM, saying that the standard iPhone 17 will have 8GB, while the other three models will have 12GB. So if this is all correct then the upcoming iPhones could have three different power tiers rather than the usual two.\nWe\u2019re a bit skeptical of this since it would be a change of form for Apple, and since other leaks point to the iPhone 17 Air having the base A19 chipset, but if Apple does boost the power that could help to make up for the Air only having one rear camera lens, which is something that\u2019s widely rumored to be the case.\nWe should find out exactly how powerful the iPhone 17 Air is \u2013 and what colors it\u2019s available in \u2013 sometime in September, as that\u2019s when it will likely launch, alongside the rest of the iPhone 17 series.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

Detail is the whole point of 4K \u2013 most of the time, you won\u2019t be able to see the pixels in a 4K display, so everything looks natural and sharp. It\u2019s great for photos, videos and gaming for this reason, but actually it\u2019s superior for just about everything \u2013 it\u2019s nicer when text looks smoother on a computer, for example.\nThe vast majority of the time, 4K refers to a specific resolution of 3840 x 2160 (which is also known as \u2018Ultra HD\u2019) \u2013 this is the resolution of all 4K TVs and 4K video streams from the likes of Netflix or YouTube. Some cameras record in what\u2019s often known as \u2018Cinema 4K\u2019, which is a resolution of 4096 x 2160. You may find that some computer monitors refer to themselves as 4K, and will have a horizontal resolution around 4,000 pixels, but have a different height to the resolutions mentioned above, such as ultra-wide monitors.

But a new iPhone 17 Pro dummy unit might change some minds.\nLeaker Majin Bu has shared photos of what's purported to be an iPhone 17 Pro dummy unit, and while the design looks broadly the same as in previous leaks, it looks much more like a finished phone than in most earlier glimpses.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro is shown in a black color, with a glossy camera panel and a more matte finish on the rest of the rear, and that contrast certainly looks appealing to our eyes. The camera block also doesn\u2019t look like it sticks out quite as much here as in some earlier leaks, though it\u2019s undeniably large.\nIPhone 17 Pro Black, Absolutely beautiful pic.twitter.com/tQZAGa6TGlJune 24, 2025\nA likely leak\nNow, as with any leak, we\u2019d take this with a pinch of salt, especially as Majin Bu has a mixed track record. But the phone here looks to us much more like something Apple would actually release than the uglier interpretations of this design we\u2019ve seen in the past.\nSo, we\u2019d say there\u2019s a high chance this is somewhat accurate. Certainly, it seems very likely that Apple will equip the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max with a large camera block in broadly this shape, since most leaks are in agreement on that front.\nWe should find out exactly how these phones will look in September, as that\u2019s the month Apple typically uses to unveil new iPhones.

      "text": "Google's Circle to Search on my Galaxy S24 helped me save a friendship and get the joke\nI know what a Pokemon is, and I even saw the movie, the one that had Deadpool. I\u2019ve never played a Pokemon game, though, even though my kiddo was a fan back in the day. Thanks to Google\u2019s new Circle to Search feature, I now know about Lance, a trainer of Dragon type Pokemon, and one of the Elite Four, before he became Champion of the Pokemon League. I don\u2019t know what any of that means, but Google does, and it helped me save a friendship.\nWhen I say friendship, I mean with Christian Guyton, our Computing Editor and Energy Drink Connoisseur, whom I\u2019ve never met because he lives in the UK. But he seems lovely! I see him on our team video chats and he comes across like a cool and knowledgeable person, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll have fun and be friends if I come to the UK or he comes to the US and we hang out.\nBut then, on a work Slack channel, Christian threw down the following challenge. He posted an anime character, without context, and said in the next message \u201cimage provided without context, if you don't understand it you are no longer my friend.\u201d\nWhat can I do!? This seems like such a capricious end to our burgeoning friendship. Then I remembered my Galaxy S24 Ultra. I grabbed the phone and opened Slack. I pressed on the bar at the bottom of the screen, and the whole display turned a shade of pink. I almost forgot what to do next because I wasn\u2019t expecting the pink. I kind of forgot about Circle to Search after I wrote the review for this phone.\nCircle to Search saves the day and makes me feel smart\nI circled the image Christian had posted and learned it was Lance from Pokemon! This was in response to messages from our editor-in-chief, also named Lance. British humor is very much based on your name, I have learned, and I benefit from having a last name that is also a sick verb.\nGoogle returned the results for the image, and I read up quickly on Lance, realizing that he is indeed an important character. If you\u2019ve played any of the major Pokemon games over the last few years, you know who this is. Now I know, and knowing is half the battle \u2013 a reference that shows you how old I am and why I did not know who Lance from Pokemon is.\nThen I looked at Christian\u2019s Slack profile. Without my glasses, I thought he was using Darth Maul as his avatar, but on closer inspection, it\u2019s another character. At first I thought it might be Garrus from Mass Effect, but not quite. I played the first and third Mass Effect games, but only once each, and that was a long time ago.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nOnce again, Google\u2019s Circle to Search on my Galaxy phone saved me. I enlarged Christian\u2019s image, held down on the bar at the bottom of the screen, and circled on the avi. Christian is using Thane Krios, another Mass Effect character. I was close! I asked Christian to confirm and he did indeed say he is Thane Krios on Slack.\nI knew this is how I would end up using Google\u2019s Circle to Search \u2013 to keep myself up to date with the youngs. I\u2019m terrible at recognizing fads and faces, especially newer celebrities and characters. Now I can just Circle to Search, and Google will give me all the backstory I need to stay up to date.\nThis is great for understanding memes that people send your way. If you see something that everybody else gets, but not you, try Google\u2019s Circle to Search. It works on the Galaxy S24 family, including the Galaxy S24 Plus and Ultra.\nThe phones that have Circle to Search and how to use it\nGoogle just added the feature to the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro in the latest Pixel feature drop. The Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro have been able to use Circle to Search since it launched with the Galaxy S24.\nTo use the feature, you just hold your finger on the bottom of the display. On most Google Pixel 8 or Galaxy S24 family phones, there will be a bar at the bottom of the screen, the one you grab to move between app windows. Or you\u2019ll have a set of onscreen buttons, like the home and back button. Press on the bar or the middle button, or just press on the bottom of the screen near the middle of the phone, and hold your finger down.\nAfter a moment or so, the screen will be covered in a light haze, and a Google search bar will appear. You can simply type in the bar, and Google will search related to everything on screen. Or, you can use your finger (or the S Pen) to draw a circle around what\u2019s important.\nGoogle will search in a robust way when you Circle to Search. When I drew a circle around Pokemon Lance\u2019s head, I got web sites, video clips, social posts on X and Tumblr among many others, and a list of related searches that included \u201cLance Pokemon Character.\u201d All of that just from drawing a circle around an anime head.\nThe hardest thing about using Google\u2019s Circle to Search was remembering that it exists, but now that I have my killer use case, I\u2019m going to circle every in-joke and reference I don\u2019t understand, and Google is going to keep me up to date. Circle to Search is keeping me from being a square.\nYou might also like...\nPhil Berne is a preeminent voice in consumer electronics reviews, starting more than 20 years ago at eTown.com.

      "text": "The iPhone 17 Pro might be able to wirelessly charge your AirPods\nReverse wireless charging could finally be coming to iPhone\n- The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max could support reverse wireless charging\n- This would let you use them to wirelessly charge the likes of your AirPods or Apple Watch\n- However, there are questions over whether Apple would be able to achieve this while still offering MagSafe\nThe iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max might have a feature that Android phones have offered for years, as a leaker claims they could support reverse wireless charging.\nThis tip comes from Fixed Focus Digital \u2013 a source with a reasonable track record \u2013 via BGR, and if it pans out, then you\u2019d be able to place your AirPods or Apple Watch on the back of your iPhone and use it as a wireless charging mat, draining the iPhone\u2019s battery a little to charge these smaller devices.\nThis feature would also likely work with other iPhones, though it would almost certainly take a long time to juice one up, and significantly drain the iPhone 17 Pro you\u2019re using as a charger in the process. Still, based on other implementations of reverse wireless charging, you'd probably be able to charge up non-Apple devices, too.\nReverse wireless charging is arguably a niche feature, but it\u2019s one that many high-profile Android handsets \u2013 such as the Samsung Galaxy S25 series \u2013 offer already.\nThe MagSafe problem\nInterestingly, though, the Google Pixel 10 series has actually ditched this feature in favor of MagSafe-like magnetic wireless charging. The company claimed the design of the magnets meant it wasn\u2019t possible to offer both magnetic wireless charging and reverse wireless charging, so it will be interesting to see whether Apple can achieve both on the iPhone 17 Pro series.\nThe fact that Google couldn\u2019t manage this makes us a little skeptical of this rumor, but this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard of reverse wireless charging possibly coming to the iPhone 17 Pro, with a previous leak suggesting it could offer a charging power of 7.5W \u2013 which wouldn\u2019t charge a phone up very fast, but is still almost double what some Android phones can manage.\nHowever, both of these leaks simply say that Apple has tested reverse wireless charging on the iPhone 17 Pro series, so even if they\u2019re accurate, it\u2019s possible Apple will choose not to equip the phones with this feature.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWe should find out soon, though, as the iPhone 17 series is expected to be unveiled in September, with one source pointing to September 9.\nYou might also like\n- The iPhone's Camera Control could be the new MacBook Touch Bar, according to sketchy rumor that says iPhone 18 will drop it\n- The iPhone 17e could get these 3 upgrades, according to new leak \u2013 including the super-useful Dynamic Island\n- The iPhone 17 Air almost makes the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge look thick in new dummy unit photos\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "iPhone 17 news live \u2013 all the latest specs, colors and price rumors ahead of the big event\nWe're getting closer to Apple's big event on September 9\nSeptember 9 is right around the corner and that's when we'll see the next big Apple event, and almost without doubt the reveal of the iPhone 17 family.\nThe smart money this year suggests we'll get a standard iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Plus, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max \u2013 though we could also see an iPhone 17 Air instead of one of those models.\nAnd if the rumors are to be believed, the Pro models at least should offer notable upgrades compared to the past few generations of iPhone launches, where Apple's smartphones have become somewhat iterative. That said, additions such as the Dynamic Island, Action Button, and Camera Control have still combined to make for some of the most consistent entries in our best phones list.\nI've been covering Apple events and iPhones for years, so I'll be your guide over the next few days as we count down to the big day. Below, you'll find a rundown of the tipped specs and features for the upcoming iPhones and live reporting of all the last-minute leaks and rumors, in addition to analysis from TechRadar's many phones experts.\nSo, let's get into it\u2026\niPhone 17: cut to the chase\n- On September 9 at the Apple event, expect to see the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Plus, iPhone 17 Pro, and iPhone 17 Pro Max.\n- These could be joined by an iPhone 17 Air, which is tipped to be a super-slim phone with a 6.7-inch display; it could replace the iPhone 17 Plus.\n- The standard iPhone will likely get a new chip, probably the A19, and may finally get a 120Hz display. Expect new colors, but not a radically different design.\n- The iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max could have more significant upgrades, from the A19 Bionic and a vapor chamber cooling system, to a new telephoto camera, and a new rear camera design, as well as a new display.\n- Expect new Apple Intelligence features to launch with the phones.\n- Prices will likely start at $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399 for the standard iPhones, and $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,849 for the Pro models.\n- Expect pre-orders to open on Friday, September 12, and a full release on September 19.\n- Here's how to watch Apple's 'Awe dropping' event on September 9.\niPhone 17: what you need to know\nHere's a rundown of the key iPhone 17 features we expect to see from the family of phones on September 9, based on the latest rumors and claimed leaks.\niPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro: design and display\nGoing by the rumors and tips so far, you can expect the iPhone 17 and 17 Plus to look a lot like their iPhone 16 predecessors.\nThere are rumors of an aluminum frame for all four next-gen iPhones, but I'm not buying that; it would mean a departure from the titanium chassis found on the Pro iPhones.\nOne big change could come in the form of a vertical rear-camera module for the iPhone 17, much like that on the Samsung Galaxy S25. This could reduce the rear footprint of the module, but would be a departure from a style Apple has used for years.\nDummy units that also touted this design have a slim horizontal pill-shaped camera module for the so-called iPhone 17 Air, which is expected to have the same screen size as the iPhone 16 Plus but to be a lot slimmer.\nIn direct contrast, the rear-camera module for the iPhone 17 Pro models is tipped to be rectangular and to span the width of the phones' bodies, with the idea that such a module could hold an upgraded camera system. A suite of other dummy units, renders, and rumors have lent weight to this, so I'm inclined to believe it's got some legitimacy.\nOn the display side, the tipsters have claimed all four phones will have 120Hz displays, which I'd welcome \u2013 a 60Hz display feels ludicrous in 2025, even on the standard iPhones.\nFor the Pro phones, one rumor claims the screens will use a new technology that \"improves battery efficiency, maximizes display durability, and enhances overall performance compared to existing display technologies.\u201d\niPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro: Cameras\nA credible and repeated rumor that there'll be a new 24MP front-facing camera for every iPhone 17 model has been doing the rounds, but wider camera upgrades for the standard iPhone 17 don't look likely.\nMeanwhile, the iPhone 17 Air might just have one rear camera, although there's some debate here, with another tipster claiming the iPhone 17 Air will have a 48MP main camera and a 12MP front-facing one.\nIt's likely to be business as usual for iPhone 17 on the camera side, though Apple may have improved the sensor a little and will likely improve image signal processing to get more out of a main and ultra-wide camera combo.\nOn the iPhone 17 Pro side, things look a little more interesting, with both models tipped to get a 48-megapixel telephoto camera. One tipster also claims that the iPhone 17 Pro Max could have a mechanical aperture, allowing you to adjust the depth of field of your photos on the fly; that might explain the expected camera module design change.\nOne left-field rumor has Apple testing a 200MP sensor, though there's no indication that this would be included on the iPhone 17 Pro range.\niPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro: price and release date\nI'll keep this simple based on rumors and my own experience of covering iPhones.\nThe standard iPhone 17 is expected to start at $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399.\nThe iPhone 17 Plus / iPhone 17 Air could start at $899 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,599.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro will likely start at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,849.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max will likely start at $1,199 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,149.\nThere's a rumor that due to tariffs, all the new iPhones could be some $50 more expensive than their respective predecessors. I'm of two minds as to whether Apple will mess with an established price cadence this year.\nExpect pre-orders for all the iPhones to open on Friday, September 12, and a full release on September 19.\nAnd be prepared for a range of storage options from 128GB to 1TB, and a mix of colors, including a punchy orange for the Pro phones.\niPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro rumored specs\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | iPhone 17 | iPhone 17 Air | iPhone 17 Pro | iPhone 17 Pro Max |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\nDisplay: | 6.1-inch OLED | 6.7-inch OLED | 6.3-inch OLED | 6.9-inch OLED |\nResolution: | 1179 x 2556 | 1290 x 2796 | 1206 x 2622 | 1320 x 2868 |\nRefresh rate: | 120Hz | 120Hz | 120Hz | 120Hz |\nChipset: | A19 | A19 Pro | A19 Pro | A19 Pro |\nRear cameras: | 48MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide | 48MP wide | 48MP wide, 48MP ultra-wide, 48MP telephoto (5x zoom) | 48MP wide, 48MP ultra-wide, 48MP telephoto (5x zoom) |\nFront camera: | 24MP | 24MP | 24MP | 24MP |\nRAM: | 8GB | 8GB | 12GB | 12GB |\nStorage: | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 256GB, 512GB, 1TB |\nBattery: | 3,561mAh+ | Under 3,000mAh | 3,582mAh+ | ~5,000mAh |\nYou can expect the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max to have similar key specifications to the iPhone 16 specs.\nThe iPhone 17 Air could mix things up and have a thickness measuring between 5.0mm and 6.0mm, but so far there haven't been a lot of leaks to tease out the dimensions of the rumored slim phone.\nOther key specs of the new iPhones will likely include an A19 chip for the standard and Plus/Air models, bringing in improved performance and efficiency, and likely snappier responses from AI tools, along with improved image signal processing.\nOn the Pro phone side, that chip is tipped to be the A19 Pro, which will surely bring in the same upgrades but with more clout on the gaming side. The latter point is given more weight by the fact that vapor chamber cooling is expected for the iPhone 17 Pro models, which could enable the chipset to deliver peak performance for extended times; this would be ideal for some of the more demanding iOS games.\nThere's also a rumor that the iPhone 17 Pro will get 12GB of RAM, which would be an upgrade on the 8GB that the current Pro phones have, and which could enable faster responses from Apple Intelligence tools.\nLive updates\nIf Apple has any surprises in the hopper, I reckon they could come more on the Apple Intelligence and software side. But I\u2019m prepared to be proven wrong.\nHowever, the rumors and tips so far all point towards 2026 being the year of a folding iPhone. And my gut tells me Apple will hold a dedicated event to bring in such a new form factor to its phone line-up.\nUsually, Apple waits until new technology is suitably mature before it adopts the tech. That\u2019s likely why we\u2019ve not had a foldable iPhone yet.\nBut folding display tech now feels at a place where it\u2019s ripe for use on an iOS-based device.\nOf course, there\u2019s always scope for Apple to pull the classic \u2018one more thing\u2019\u2026\nDon't hold out for an iPhone Fold\nWhile a new rumor has surfaced about the so-called iPhone Fold, don't expect to see it on September 9.\nIn fact, I'd suggest there's no chance of even a tease that Apple is working on a folding iPhone. This is Apple after all, not Samsung...\nHowever, an aluminium chassis on the iPhone 17 Air, if it's legit, would make sense for a thin-and-light phone...\nThere have been a few rumors discussing an aluminium frame for the iPhone 17 models, but I'm not buying that.\nI think it would be a backwards step for the Pro iPhones, since I've already touted how good titnaium is on phones. And I just don't see Apple giving up on stainless steel for the standard iPhone.\nI\u2019m now just chewing over other specs upgrades we might see from the iPhone 17 family.\nMore RAM for the Pro models, likely a boost from 8GB to 12GB could make for a snappier iOS 26 experience, but then I\u2019ve never felt than any version of iOS has ever felt unresponsive. I could say the same for more recent iterations of Android.\nRumors of improved battery life is potentially a given for the iPhone 17 series, with new chips often bringing with them improved energy efficiency.\nThis could be mitigated by a boost in performance, so the energy efficiency evens that out; more power but the same expected battery life.\nHowever, my prediction is Apple will favor a longer battery life this year over pure performance boosts, as the iPhone 16 models already have buckets of power.\nAll of the lights\nDing! Ding! We have a new rumor: the latest iPhone 17 Pro leak points to a brighter screen and better battery life.\nOver to freelancer David Nield:\n\"According to regular tipster Instant Digital (via AppleInsider), we can expect the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max \u2013 the most expensive of the four anticipated models \u2013 to maintain higher levels of screen brightness for longer periods of time.\n\"What's more, the phones are said to be better at handling the higher internal temperatures that are typical when playing demanding games. The phones will be more stable in these scenarios, the tipster says, with fewer frame drops.\"\nThat's not to say I think the telephoto camera on the iPhone 16 Pro Max isn't good; in fact I think it's great.\nBut more megapixels combined with smart image processing and some AI tools, could make for a more flexible telephoto camera with more options to crop into shots and so on.\nFor more, read Jamie Richard's article: The iPhone 17 Pro could get a 48MP telephoto camera, which is way more exciting than it sounds \u2013 let me explain.\nAnd as I've said before, the tipped 48-megapixel 5x optical zoom telephoto camera on the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max, also has my attention.\nAs mentioned previously and by Axel Metz, the tipped 120Hz display on the standard iPhone 17 is worthy of our attention.\nApple's iPhones have never really been about the specs per se. Rather it's about what certain specifications enable the iPhone to do, such as gaming or more advanced AI features.\nSo while these tipped iPhone 17 specs don't exactly get one phone-nerd synapse tingling, it's very likely that all four next-generation iPhone will have plenty of power to be super-slick and offer snappy smart tools.\nSpying specs\nStraight off the bat, I'm looking at our new deep-dive into the iPhone 17 specs.\nAs you'll see in the static section above, I've added a new specs table for all four predicted iPhone 17 models so check that out.\nGood morning form the UK. Roland Moore-Colyer back again to bring you the latest iPhone 17 rumors and analysis from today, and some wider thoughts on the looming Apple event.\nThis event desperately needs one more thing\nIn the runups to these big tech launches, I like to imagine the whole sequence of events, a sort of mental pregame that starts with all the activities before, say, Apple CEO Tim Cook takes the stage, through the cascade of product unveilings to the end, where, sometimes, Cook reemerges on stage before releasing us to the pell-mell demo room.\nWhen I do that, I often ponder the big question: Will there be \"one more thing\"? That signature Apple move that started with Steve Jobs and continues to this day with Cook has a pretty storied history.\nFor those who've never seen it, this is the 'extra\" announcement that happens after you think all the Apple product reveals are done. It's been everything from Windows compatibility for iPod to, most recently, Vision Pro in 2023.\nIt makes sense not to do them every year, since that would make the \"one more thing\" just another thing that we all expect. However, I think we can agree that Apple needs one more thing this year more than ever. It's not been a super year, what with tariff worries, a President pressing Cook on building the iPhone in the US, and Apple Intelligence disappointments.\nI don't know exactly what \"one more thing\" could be, but I am convinced that Apple needs the electricity such an announcement invariably brings.\nBeware the fakery\nWhat you see below is not the new iPhone 17 lineup. Sure, there appears to be an iPhone 17 Air and a Pro model with the wider camera array, but watch closely and you'll see the cameras move around the backs of these phones.\nThese are most like AI-generated fakes (even X's Grok confirmed as much) designed to fool you into believing they're the real thing. Sure, they could be based on real prototypes, but we doubt it.\nIn this age of AI it is worth remembering that anyone with a AI image generator and a decent prompt can create a fake \"iPhone 17\" image and even a video.\nTrust nothing until the big reveal on September 9 at 1PM ET.\niPhone 17 \ud83d\udd10\ud83c\udf1f\ud83d\udd25\ud83e\udd2f pic.twitter.com/XoA9ZGTmyGSeptember 3, 2025\nHow to talk AI without talking about Apple Intelligence\nBy now, we all know that Apple plans to deliver the best bits of Apple Intelligence \u2013 like a Siri worth caring about \u2013 \"in the coming year\", which sounds like next year. If that's the case, there won't be any truly exciting Apple Intelligence bits to discuss during the Apple iPhone 17 launch event. On the other hand, how does Apple not talk about artificial intelligence in the Age of AI.\nThe reality is that Apple did add some Apple Intelligence tweaks in iOS 26 that it could again highlight, like Live Translations and the tweaks to Visual Intelligence, but these are not exciting updates, and none puts Apple on a level playing field with generative AI leaders like OpenAI (a partner) and Google (a partner).\nPerhaps this is the moment when Apple unveils a new AI partnership with, for instance, Anthropic. There are rumors that it could integrate Claude AI intelligence into Siri. There's no way that's ready by next week, but a smaller partnership in which you can choose to use Claude AI instead of ChatGPT would be interesting, and this is how you talk about AI without really talking about Apple intelligence.\nTrade in? Trade up? What's the right timing?\nThe most common question I get this time of year is, \"Do I upgrade or wait until next year?\" It's a funny question, but it implies that people think something even bigger is just around the corner (12 months from now), and they could soon be kicking themselves for upgrading too quickly.\nPerhaps there's a more rational approach.\nThere is no good school of thought on when you should trade in your aging iPhone, but a good rule of thumb might be when OS updates are running dry. Apple products do become vintage (roughly 7 years or older) and then obsolete, with no more platform updates. This year, that list includes all the iPhone X phones.\nMy point is, if you own one of those, or maybe even one a year away from vintage status, like the iPhone 11, you might consider an upgrade.\nRight, it's getting late in the evening for me in the UK, so I'll leave you for a bit with some thoughts from Editor-at-Large Lance Ulanoff, who isn't short on what he'd like to see from the next-generation iPhones and the Apple event.\nOver to Ulanoff:\nApple's iPhone 17 Air could be the star, but may not be the highlight\nRumors have been swirling around an ultra-thin iPhone (the iPhone 17 Air) for almost a year, but in that time, Samsung released the 5.8mm thick Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge and then the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, which, unfolded, is just 4.2mm thick!\nOf these two phones, the Z Fold is unquestionably thinner but also a much more interesting phone. The S25 Edge is just a thin Galaxy that is otherwise, well, a bit boring (read our review for evidence).\nWhich brings me to the iPhone 17 Air, which should be the star of Apple's big iPhone 17 launch event, but I worry it could be underwhelming. That is, unless Apple makes it thinner than 4.2mm and adds some extra, unexpected feature. But what could Apple do? You can't fit a decent-sized battery, so battery life won't match the iPhone 17 Pro. It won't have a big telephoto camera because you can't fit that periscope in the itsybitsy space.\nWhat the iPhone 17 Air will have going for it is a super thin and light body and a very big (Plus-sized) screen. Oh, and did I mention that it'll probably be as expensive (if not more so) than the iPhone 17 Pro?\nOn the subject of price drops, I have an analysis based on my time writing about iPhones on whether the iPhone 16's price drop when the iPhone 17 launches.\nI should add that I 100% don't think you should buy an iPhone until Apple has announced its new phones.\nHolding fire until then means you could either pick up the new iPhone if they appeal to you, or get an older iPhone at a discount price. So even if you're due an upgrade, patience will likely do you wonders.\nTime for an upgrade?\nWhile I spoke earlier about upgrading from an iPhone 16 Pro Max, the iPhone 17 family will more likely appeal to people looking to upgrade from older Apple phones.\nSo here's freelancer Paul Hatton with why 3 rumored features could see him upgrade to the iPhone 17 from an iPhone 12.\nBuilding off the back of that thought, I'd be keen for the powerd-up iPhones to further acts as device that can better interact with other devices one uses in daily life.\nOf course, that'll likely need Apple to let more things into its walled garden, but I do think that's a distinct possibility.\nSpeeding up\nBit of a left-field tidbit, but it looks like Apple CarPlay Ultra will come to more affordable cars in the near-future.\nCarPlay Ultra better stitches together car infotainment unit with Apple's car-meets-phone interface. So I'd be curious to see if CarPlay Ultra could benefit from a boost in power the iPhone 17 family could bring to the table.\nJust want to flag this rumor for a little color to the blog: New iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max leaks show off internals, a camera upgrade \u2013 and a SIM slot.\nI'd be curious to see how the standard iphone will evolve over Apple's tipped three-year plan.\n\"Fresh rumors suggest Apple has committed to a new three-year plan for the iPhone, with three radical new designs set to join or replace parts of the current flagship lineup,\" Jamie Richards reportes.\n\"This comes from Mark Gurman, Bloomberg\u2019s resident Apple correspondent and the tech industry\u2019s most trusted Apple tipster, who shared some details of the rumored changes to the iPhone line-up.\"\nStill, Staff Writer Jamie Richards has 4 ways the iPhone 17 can improve on the iPhone 16, which based on some rumors means the iPhone 17 could be a bigger upgrade than first meets the eye.\nIterative upgrades\nPutting aside the 120Hz display, it's not looking like the iPhone 17 will bring a huge clutch of upgrades to the table.\nA new rear-camera desing could streamline the phone a little. And a new A19 chip could offer a decent boost in power, but I'm not convinced it'll be a big upgrade over the iPhone 16 series.\nMr Metz's opinion is one I can get behind. I think the standard iPhones is great but the 60Hz display feels almost heinous in 2025.\nIf Apple ditches it for a 60Hz to 120Hz display then I could see myself not needing to go Pro.\nHz so good\nMoving on from the iPhone 17 Pro, and there's a rumor or two that the iPhone 17 will have a 120Hz display.\nThat's got Phones Editor Axel Metz a little intrigued. Over to him:\n\"Back in February 2024, I wrote that 120Hz refresh rates make Apple\u2019s best iPhones worth the money. But if the base iPhone 17 is due to get this formerly Pro-exclusive feature, I may well recommend this cheaper model over the pricier Pro models this year.\n\"To be clear: the iPhone 17 isn\u2019t tipped to get ProMotion specifically, which allows iPhone screens to dial all the way down to 1Hz (enabling features like the Always-On display). But it is tipped to get a static 120Hz display, which is by far the more important feature of the two.\"\nThough I should say there's plenty of great, and less-demanding games on Apple Arcade, which I do rather enjoy taking for a spin.\nGassed up\nLet me ponder that vapor chamber tidbit a little more... I think it might low-key be a heck of an upgrade for the iPhone 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max.\nNot only can my iPhone 16 Pro Max get a little hot under the collar when gaming or using 5G, so a vapor chamber cooling system could help alleviate that, I think it could also extract more performance out of an A-series chipset.\nBetter cooling means less had that can hamper the performance of a chip's CPU and GPU over time, say extended gaming sessions. And so being able to push a chip harder and for longer could see Apple extract more power for more advanced games.\nCupertino's crew has already seen the porting of Sniper Elite 4, Death Stranding and Hitman World of Assassination on to iOS, so I think unlocking more power could further open up the path for more console-grade games on iPhone.\nAs is the tipped vapor chamber upgrade for the iPhone 17 Pro Max and iPhone 17 Pro. This should keep a high-performing iPhone cooler than ever before, which is handy for mobile gamers and people who rely on sustained 5G connectivity.\nMore power and a more efficient battery management, likely facilitated by the rumored A19 Pro chip would also be appreciated.\nThat being said, the idea of a 48-megapixel improved telephoto camera and a form of adjustable aperture for the cameras system, definitely has my attention I'm a big fan of telephoto cameras as I do like a nicely zoomed shot.\nMax attack\nSpeaking of my iPhone 16 Pro Max, it's become a phone i've really enjoyed using, so it's hard for me to see myself upgrading from it other than for work purposes. While I do prefer a slightly smaller phone, this iPhone has been a wonderful device to use for the past year-ish.\nI've loved the cameras, performance, desing, toughness and more. So it's hard to see what Apple can bring to the table to tempt me over.\nGet set for iOS 26\nWith the iPhone 17 family, we should see the full debut of iOS 26, with its new Liquid Glass material design.\nIn preparation for this, Apple has released what's sure to be the final iOS 26 beta to developer testers ahead of its event on September 9. So from that I can glean we could get the full rollout of iOS 26 rather soon after the next-generation iPhones get shown off. I'm looking forward to trying it on my iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nAmong the rumors, there's also a hit that the iPhone 17 Air could be the only model to lack a SIM card slot in the EU.\nWhile eschewing physical SIM cards maybe common in the US, it's not the done thing in Europe yet. But perhaps Apple could forge the path for an eSIM future on both sides of the Atlantic.\nFrom that rumor report there's more stuff to chew over.\nSeen by 9to5Mac, a research note from JPMorgan has the firm expecting the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro Max to have the same prices as their predecessors.\nSo that would mean a starting price of $799 / \u00a3799 / AU$1,399 for the iPhone 17, and of $1,199 / \u00a31,199 / AU$2,149 for the iPhone 17 Pro Max. These are only US prices however but we hope other nations will follow such a cadence and not come with a price hike over the previous generation of iPhones.\niPhone 17 Pro Max papped already?\nSo let's kick things off with a nice and fresh rumor: the iPhone 17 Pro Max has seemingly been caught on camera \u2013 and it could cost less than expected.\nA short video reportedly showed an iPhone 17 Pro Max retail unit and it's look like the new rectangular rear-camera module will be a new design feature of the next-generation Pro iPhones. Hopefully, this'll means the phones will also hold upgraded cameras.\nBut this was from a post on Weibo and it's hard to verify the veracity of such stuff, Yet, this does back-up the desing touted in other rumors and dummy units. So I reckon there's some weight to this.\nGood morning or afternoon, or evening, wherever you are. I'm Roland Moore-Colyer, Managing Editor of Mobile Computing at TechRadar, and I'll be your host for the next few days as we count down the days to the big Apple event.\nHello and welcome to our iPhone 17 rumors live blog."

      "text": "iPhone 17 launch date official as Apple sends out invites for \u2019Awe dropping\u2019 event \u2013 here are 5 things to expect\nExpect iPhones, Apple Watches, AirPods, and Liquid Glass\nWe\u2019ve all been expecting an Apple Event in September, and the Cupertino-based technology giant has just made it official by sending out invites for a special event on September 9, with the tagline, \u201cAwe dropping\u201d.\nThere\u2019s certainly a lot we\u2019re expecting, and the special event will kick off at the fairly standard time for Apple events. It\u2019ll start at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BST on September 9, 2025 (3am September 10 AEST) at Apple Park, but have no fear if you didn\u2019t score an invite. The event itself will be livestreamed, and TechRadar will be on the ground to break down all the big announcements as they happen.\nJudging by the rumors and what Apple has shown off at previous September special events, we\u2019re expecting the iPhone 17 lineup \u2013 including the all-new, super-thin iPhone 17 Air \u2013 new Apple Watches, and AirPods, as well as a tremendous amount of software.\nYou might recall that Apple showed off its new Liquid Glass interface and ethos for its iOS, iPadOS, macOS Tahoe, watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS platforms, and all of those, or at least a majority, should get release dates as Apple has promised a \u201cfall\u201d launch (that\u2019s a September to November timeframe).\nBelow, we\u2019ll break down what the invite tells us, and a bit more about what to expect at the September 9 'Awe dropping' event.\nWhat does the 'Awe dropping' invite tell us?\nNow that Apple's September 9 event is official, all eyes are on the invite itself. The 'Awe-dropping' take on the Apple logo is an interesting one, seemingly turning it into a thermal imaging-like, heat-sensing view. There's a strong shade of a vibrant orange, a dark blue, as well as an aqua blue, green, and even some yellow here.\nCould this be hinting at a new cooling system for the rumored iPhone 17s, or perhaps a thermal camera joining the setup? The former seems the most likely. It could also be pointing at colors for the new iPhones, which makes sense, given some rumors are suggesting a shade of orange for the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nTim Cook, Apple's CEO, also shared a video of the invite \u2013 well, mainly of the Apple logo with a heat map of colors moving around it. You can see that below.\nGet ready for an awe dropping #AppleEvent on Tuesday, September 9! pic.twitter.com/uAcYp2RLMMAugust 26, 2025\nWhat can we expect at the event?\nThe likely star of 'Awe dropping' will be the iPhone 17 lineup. We expect four models again, but this time the iPhone 17 Air may replace the Plus alongside the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max.\nWith the iPhone 17 Air Apple will be looking to narrow the gap with Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Edge. The 17 Air is expected to be super-thin \u2013 somewhere around 5.5 millimeters \u2013 with a powerful chip inside.\nIt\u2019ll be interesting to see if the standard iPhone 17 gets the same chip as the Pros \u2013 likely the A18 \u2013 or if it stands alone. A redesigned single-lens camera is rumored, and Apple will need to address battery life, especially if the 17 Air replaces the long-lasting Plus model.\nFor the iPhone 17, 17 Pro, and 17 Pro Max, we expect performance upgrades from new Apple-made silicon inside, and there could be some changes to how Camera Control works, according to recent rumors. Another new report suggests that the volume rocker and Action Button might be combined into one\nNow, if you\u2019re after the best cameras Apple has to offer, the 17 Pro and 17 Pro Max are still expected to offer three lenses, but in a new design. We\u2019ve all grown accustomed to a square camera bump, but according to reports, Apple might be raising the bar in the same way that we\u2019ve seen with the Google Pixel family. You\u2019ll still find a wide, ultra-wide, and telephoto lenses here, but the latter is expected to get a serious upgrade.\nThe iPhone 17 will likely look pretty similar to the iPhone 16, though I'm hoping Apple sticks with some vibrant colors here. As I noted in the iPhone 16 review, an upgrade to 120Hz screens for the entry-level iPhone would be a much-appreciated addition, and it\u2019s always a possibility, judging by rumors that the iPhone 17 lineup could usher this in across the board. There\u2019s also reporting that the selfie camera on every new iPhone will kick things into a high gear of 24 megapixels.\nAll of the new iPhones are expected to run iOS 26 out of the box with the new look and many new features, like major upgrades to Messages, and Apple will most certainly tout some new Apple Intelligence features here.\nWhat can we expect from an Apple Watch Series 11? Well, it should stick with a similar build and look to the Series 10. Still, under the hood, the processor should be upgraded for faster performance on the device, and hopefully, more efficient running for battery life. The Series 11 should be able to track blood oxygen out of the box around the globe, and even in the United States, as Apple has reintroduced that feature to the Series 9, Series 10, and Ultra 2.\nIt will still take the reading with sensors on your wrist, but you view the results on your iPhone \u2013 a smart workaround. That health tracking capability should be here alongside heart rate, ECG, a skin temperature sensor, and sleep tracking, though recent reports also note that blood pressure monitoring might be introduced this year as well. You\u2019ll also get Workout Buddy when tracking workouts as part of watchOS 26 and a new gesture.\nAs for the Apple Watch Ultra 3, we\u2019d expect it to keep a similar look available in two colors \u2013 silver or black \u2013 and mostly the same size. Though, as we\u2019ve seen with other Apple Watches, the design team could slim down bezels to offer an even larger display that gets considerably brighter. After all, it\u2019s designed as an adventure, ultra-rugged Apple Watch. It also gets several new features as part of watchOS 26, and if new health features are on the horizon, it\u2019s likely the Ultra will have feature parity with the Series 11.\nGiven that it\u2019s been two years since AirPods Pro 2 with USB-C, and that Apple rolled out new features for those buds alongside the AirPods 4 and AirPods Max with USB-C in 2024, there\u2019s a good chance we\u2019ll see the AirPods Pro 3 at the September event.\nThese will likely offer some upgrades over the current design, but a reinvention isn\u2019t likely needed, given the current look's popularity. Still, the charging case here could be slimmed down a bit, and it might adopt a similar LED and button structure as the AirPods 4, which would mean a switch to a capacitive button rather than a physical one.\nThe Powerbeats Pro 2 already feature in-ear heart rate tracking, so there is an excellent chance these arrive on the new AirPods Pro alongside a performance boost from a new processor. You may not need the heart-rate tracing functionality here if you have an Apple Watch, though.\nThere\u2019s also the rumored live translation feature, which would take on the likes of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Buds and Google\u2019s Pixel Buds 2 Pro. Don\u2019t expect AirPods Pro with cameras this year, though.\nApple can only fit so much into just one event, but rumors point to the rest of 2025 being jam-packed for the tech giant. We can also expect new iPads \u2013 including an 11-inch and 13-inch iPad Pro with the M5 chip \u2013 and new Mac desktops and MacBooks with the M5 as well as upgrades to the HomePod mini and Apple TV 4K.\nAs for when those arrive, it could be that Apple saves those for October or November. There\u2019s also talk of an upgraded Apple Vision Pro with a faster processor over the M2, but it likely won\u2019t bring the price down considerably.\nAs with all Apple rumors, it\u2019s important to remember that nothing is officially official until it\u2019s announced by the tech giant. So you\u2019ll want to stick with TechRadar on September 9 to follow along with our live reporting on Apple\u2019s Special Event.\nYou might also like\nJacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

      "text": "What specs will the iPhone 17 series have? Here are my expert predictions\nThe iPhone 17 series is almost here, with Apple set to unveil the iPhone 17 itself along with the iPhone 17 Pro, the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and likely the iPhone 17 Air on September 9. But you don\u2019t have to wait until then to get a good idea of what to expect.\nBetween leaks, rumors, past form, and my own expert analysis, I\u2019ve pulled together a likely specs list for all four of these phones.\nSo read on to see which aspects will probably be improved, which won\u2019t, and whether these phones are likely to be worth upgrading to.\niPhone 17 series specs comparison\nBelow you\u2019ll find a closer look at all the specs I predict these phones will offer, but first, here\u2019s a brief comparison of the key specs you might find with each of these handsets.\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | iPhone 17 | iPhone 17 Air | iPhone 17 Pro | iPhone 17 Pro Max |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\nDisplay: | 6.1-inch OLED | 6.7-inch OLED | 6.3-inch OLED | 6.9-inch OLED |\nResolution: | 1179 x 2556 | 1290 x 2796 | 1206 x 2622 | 1320 x 2868 |\nRefresh rate: | 120Hz | 120Hz | 120Hz | 120Hz |\nChipset: | A19 | A19 Pro | A19 Pro | A19 Pro |\nRear cameras: | 48MP wide, 12MP ultra-wide | 48MP wide | 48MP wide, 48MP ultra-wide, 48MP telephoto (5x zoom) | 48MP wide, 48MP ultra-wide, 48MP telephoto (5x zoom) |\nFront camera: | 24MP | 24MP | 24MP | 24MP |\nRAM: | 8GB | 8GB | 12GB | 12GB |\nStorage: | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 128GB, 256GB, 512GB | 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 256GB, 512GB, 1TB |\nBattery: | 3,561mAh+ | Under 3,000mAh | 3,582mAh+ | ~5,000mAh |\niPhone 17 specs predictions\nAs you can see in the specs list above, the iPhone 17 might have a lot in common with the iPhone 16, with leaks pointing to a screen that\u2019s once again 6.1 inches. And if it is the same size I\u2019d expect it would also be the same resolution \u2013 meaning 1179 x 2556. However, one widely rumored upgrade the display could get is a 120Hz refresh rate, up from 60Hz on the current model.\nWe haven\u2019t heard much about the rear cameras, which suggests they will probably be largely unchanged \u2013 so expect a 48MP wide and 12MP ultra-wide camera again. However, the front-facing camera has been rumored multiple times to be getting boosted from 12MP to 24MP, so that seems likely.\nThe chipset should also be improved, with leaks and common sense pointing to an A19 \u2013 up from the A18 in the iPhone 16. However, most sources reckon the iPhone 17's RAM will once again come in at 8GB.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nWe haven\u2019t heard much about the iPhone 17\u2019s storage, so that\u2019s likely unchanged from the 128GB / 256GB / 512GB capacities of its predecessor, and there\u2019s little news on the battery capacity either, so I\u2019d expect it will be at least 3,561mAh like last year.\nHowever, based on past form there\u2019s a fair chance it could have a bigger battery, especially as Apple might be using a lighter and thinner motherboard, which would leave more space for extra battery capacity.\niPhone 17 Air specs predictions\nThe iPhone 17 Air would be a completely new model for Apple, so we can\u2019t look at it in terms of upgrades from its predecessor, but its screen at least might be similar to the iPhone 16 Plus\u2019s, with leaks putting it at 6.7 inches. That said, some reports suggest it could instead be 6.6 inches, or somewhere in the middle.\nI\u2019m going to guess 6.7 inches though, since that\u2019s what the iPhone 16 Plus has and the iPhone 17 Air is reportedly taking the Plus\u2019s place in the line.\nIn which case, it would probably also have the same resolution as the iPhone 16 Plus, meaning 1290 x 2796. However, as with the base model it could be boosted to a higher 120Hz refresh rate, going by numerous leaks.\nThe iPhone 17 Air\u2019s cameras though could be a downgrade, with leaks consistently pointing to the presence of just a single 48MP snapper on the back \u2013 this presumably being a compromise necessary to make the phone thin. That could be joined by a 24MP camera on the front, though some leaks suggest it will instead have a 12MP one.\nThere are conflicting reports over whether the iPhone 17 Air will have an A19 chipset or an A19 Pro \u2013 with one less GPU core than the Pro phones. We\u2019ve heard the latter more recently though, so that\u2019s my best guess for now.\nThere\u2019s also no real agreement on whether the iPhone 17 Air will have 8GB of RAM or 12GB, but given that reports put the price similar to that of the iPhone 16 Plus, I\u2019d guess it will just have 8GB.\nThat reportedly similar pricing also makes me think storage could be the same as the iPhone 16 Plus, meaning 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB configurations. However the battery will almost certainly be smaller, given that this is set to be a slim phone. In fact, we\u2019ve heard that it could be under 3,000mAh, which seems believable.\niPhone 17 Pro specs predictions\nNow we come to the iPhone 17 Pro, and as with the base model there might not be many screen upgrades. In fact, it\u2019s possible that this will have exactly the same display as the iPhone 16 Pro.\nSpecifically, leaks suggest it has a 6.3-inch 120Hz screen (with that refresh rate not being an upgrade here), and if the size is the same, the resolution probably will be too \u2013 so I\u2019m predicting a resolution of 1206 x 2622.\nHowever, the cameras could be in for some upgrades, because along with the same 48MP wide and 48MP ultra-wide cameras as last year, we\u2019ve heard from numerous sources that the telephoto camera could also be 48MP \u2013 up from 12MP on the iPhone 16 Pro.\nWhether it will still offer 5x optical zoom is less clear, with one source saying it will instead be a 3.5x zoom camera, and another going in the opposite direction and saying it could reach 8x zoom. But as there\u2019s a lack of consensus I\u2019m going to guess it\u2019s still 5x for now.\nAs with the other phones in the iPhone 17 series, the front camera here is widely rumored to also be getting an upgrade, from 12MP to 24MP.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro\u2019s chipset will of course also almost certainly be better, with an A19 Pro probably set to replace the current model\u2019s A18 Pro, and several sources also claim that it will have 12GB of RAM \u2013 up from 8GB in the iPhone 16 Pro. That said, one source says it will still have 8GB, so it could go either way.\nWe\u2019ve also heard from numerous sources that the iPhone 17 Pro might start with 256GB of storage, rather than the 128GB of its predecessor. But it\u2019s unlikely to go beyond the current 1TB at the top end.\nAnd finally, the iPhone 17 Pro will presumably have a battery that\u2019s at least as high capacity as the 3,582mAh one in the iPhone 16 Pro. But if anything, it will probably be higher capacity, as Apple often increases the capacity on new models.\niPhone 17 Pro Max specs predictions\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to be the flagship model in the iPhone 17 series. But as with the other phones its screen might not be a major focus, with leaks suggesting that \u2013 like the iPhone 16 Pro Max \u2013 it will have a 6.9-inch 120Hz display.\nWe haven\u2019t heard much talk about the resolution, but as with the other models I\u2019d assume it would be the same again if the size remains the same, meaning 1320 x 2868.\nIts cameras could be in for the same upgrades as the iPhone 17 Pro\u2019s will reportedly have \u2013 meaning a new 48MP telephoto camera in place of its 12MP predecessor, and a new 24MP camera on the front, with the wide and ultra-wide lenses probably remaining at 48MP, like last year.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro Max\u2019s chipset will also almost certainly be improved, with the consensus being that it will have an A19 Pro chipset, likely paired with 12GB of RAM (up from 8GB in the iPhone 16 Pro Max).\nWe haven\u2019t heard much about its storage though, so that will likely remain unchanged \u2013 with 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB options.\nAnd the battery is an interesting element because we haven\u2019t heard many rumors about that either, but one suggests that it could reach 5,000mAh, which would be a fairly sizable jump over the 4,685mAh of the iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nThat\u2019s a bigger increase than Apple usually goes for, but an increase of some amount is likely, and reaching around 5,000mAh certainly doesn\u2019t sound impossible.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "The best iPhone for you will depend on what you value most in a smartphone. We've reviewed every iPhone released since 2007 (that's 46 models and counting), so we can confidently say that you don't necessarily need to buy the most expensive model to get the best experience with Apple's ubiquitous smartphones.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is, of course, the obvious choice for power users, but the standard iPhone 16 is a better option for those who prefer smaller phones. The iPhone 15, meanwhile, continues to rank as the best-value iPhone, while the newly announced iPhone 16e is the outright cheapest model.\nThe iPhone 17 series is tipped to land on September 9, so if you're in the market for a new iPhone, we'd suggest waiting until next month (if you can) before making a decision on which model to buy. Even if you're not fussed about owning the latest iPhone, the new line's arrival will likely drive the price of existing models down.\nBelow, we've selected the best iPhones for every use case, comparing key factors such as price, performance, cameras, and battery life to help you find a model that meets your needs. We've tested over 1,000 phones since 2005, so you can be confident that our recommendations are based on expert knowledge, in-depth analysis, and intelligent comparisons between devices.\nOnce you're set on a model, check out our best iPhone deals and Apple coupon codes pages for a roundup of the latest discounts. And for a look into the future, head to our iPhone 17 rumors hub.\nQuick list\nBest overall\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is the best Apple phone you can buy today. Its combination of an A18 Pro chipset, a great camera suite, and Apple Intelligence compatibility make it a potent flagship handset, though the smaller iPhone 16 Pro is equally impressive.\nRead more below\nBest for most people\nAll things considered, the iPhone 16 is the best all-round iPhone on the market right now thanks to its compact size, A18 chipset, excellent cameras, and future-proof software compatibility.\nRead more below\nBest value\nApple's base 2023 model may lack the bells and whistles of its newer stablemates, but the iPhone 15 is still fast, compact, and photographer-friendly. With USB-C connectivity and the Dynamic Island, it's a very complete iPhone for a compelling price.\nRead more below\nBest budget\nIf you're happy to forgo some niceties like the Dynamic Island and MagSafe, the iPhone 16e is an excellent iPhone entry-point thanks to its top-tier screen and powerful performance.\nRead more below\nBest battery life\nThe iPhone 16 Plus is the model to go for if battery life is your number one priority. The 16 Pro Max offers comparable endurance, but as a value proposition, the 16 Plus has it beat.\nRead more below\nI'm TechRadar's Phones Editor, and have been reviewing and writing about the best mobile devices (iPhones included) for several years. Based in the UK, I handle news and feature coverage for the phones section of the site, and regularly edit TechRadar's phones-related reviews and buying guides. You'll find my byline on over 1,500 TechRadar articles.\nThe best iPhone in 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best iPhone overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you want the very best iPhone money can buy right now, the iPhone 16 Pro Max is the model to go for. The iPhone 15 Pro Max was already (and still is) an exceptional handset, but Apple's latest flagship comes with a bigger screen, a more powerful chipset, a superior telephoto camera, a new Camera Control button, and Apple Intelligence compatibility.\nApple is pitching the latter of those features as the biggest selling point of the iPhone 16 Pro Max, and while Apple Intelligence endured a rocky start to life, it's beginning to take shape, with more Apple Intelligence features on the way, too.\nThe iPhone 16 Pro Max is powered by the A18 Pro chipset, which, according to our benchmark tests, is the most powerful chipset Apple has ever produced. In fact, the A18 Pro bested the results of all of the Android phone chipsets we tested in 2024, so the 16 Pro Max is a truly market-leading handset.\nAll that power makes scrolling, streaming, gaming, and productivity tasks a breeze on the iPhone 16 Pro Max, while the phone's gorgeous 6.8-inch Super XDR OLED display (with ProMotion) is the biggest and best iPhone screen, well, ever.\nOn the camera front, the iPhone 16 Pro Max boasts a 48MP quad-pixel main lens, a 48MP ultra-wide lens (the first on an iPhone), and a 12MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom (even more zoom would've been nice, but perhaps that's being greedy). Apple's new flagship also achieved a record-setting 16 hours of battery life in our testing, which is a figure rivaled only by the iPhone 16 Plus.\nIt's worth noting that the 6.3-inch iPhone 16 Pro is exactly the same phone as the iPhone 16 Pro Max, but smaller and cheaper. So, if you're not fussed about owning the biggest iPhone, we'd advise going for that model instead.\nRead our full iPhone 16 Pro Max review\nThe best iPhone for most people\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you're not fussed about the larger size, faster refresh rate, and telephoto camera capabilities of Apple's more expensive Pro models, the standard iPhone 16 is an excellent all-round iPhone that we consider to be the best iPhone for most people.\nThe iPhone 15 (below) is still our pick as the best-value iPhone given its cheaper price, but the iPhone 16's compatibility with Apple Intelligence means that it won't become outmoded as quickly as Apple's 2023 base model.\nOf course, the iPhone 16 brings more than just software upgrades. In addition to the Action button inherited from the iPhone 15 Pro, the iPhone 16 gets an all-new Camera Control button, which can be used as a traditional shutter button or as a capacitive button that lets you zoom and adjust exposure, as well as a superfast A18 chipset, a larger battery and a faster 45W charging speed than the iPhone 15.\nThe iPhone 16's 48MP wide and 12MP ultra-wide cameras are impressive, but if you want truly exceptional zoom capabilities, you're better off going for the iPhone 16 Pro (or indeed the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra or Pixel 9 Pro).\nAs for the iPhone 16's display, you'll get a stunning 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR OLED screen that we found offers punchy colors and stark contrast points, though as alluded to above, you'll have to go for the pricier iPhone 16 Pro to benefit from Apple's ProMotion (i.e. 120Hz refresh rate) technology. For a spec-by-spec comparison of the two models, check out our iPhone 16 vs iPhone 16 Pro explainer.\nRead our full iPhone 16 review\nThe best value iPhone\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nDespite the arrival of the iPhone 16 series, we still consider the standard iPhone 15 to be the best-value iPhone in 2025. What it lacks in titanium sides, 120Hz scrolling, or high-spec zoom photography, the standard iPhone 15 more than makes up for in performance and portability.\nFor just $699 / \u00a3699 / AU$1,249 from Apple directly, you get a 6.1-inch Super XDR OLED display, a fast A16 Bionic chipset, a USB-C port, a supremely capable 48MP main camera, and Apple\u2019s smart digital screen cut-out, the Dynamic Island, all delivered in a sleek and eye-catching design package.\nYou do lose out on Apple Intelligence compatibility with the iPhone 15, so if you're ready to embrace smartphone AI and want a future-proof pocket companion, the iPhone 16 is the better buy. However, if you're simply looking for a speedy, long-lasting, and eye-catching iPhone to see you through the next three or four years, the iPhone 15 is an excellent choice.\nFor a spec-by-spec comparison of the two models, check out our iPhone 16 vs iPhone 15 explainer.\nRead our full iPhone 15 review\nThe best budget iPhone\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFollowing the launch of the iPhone 16e in February 2025, Apple discontinued both the iPhone SE (2022) and the iPhone 14, meaning the company's new entry-level iPhone 16 model is now the cheapest iPhone available as new.\nThe iPhone 16e brings several key upgrades over the iPhone SE (2022), including a 48MP main camera, a more powerful chipset, a longer-lasting battery, and Apple Intelligence compatibility. You'll have to make do with a physical notch instead of the Dynamic Island, and there's no MagSafe compatibility to speak of here, but the iPhone 16e is, after all, intended to be a no-frills model.\nIf you're looking for more bells and whistles, go for an iPhone 15 or an iPhone 16 (to see how the iPhone 16e stacks up against those more expensive models, check out our iPhone 16e vs iPhone 15 and iPhone 16e vs iPhone 16 comparisons), but put simply, this is the best budget iPhone available in 2025.\nRead our full iPhone 16e review\nThe best iPhone for battery life\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe iPhone 16 Plus takes everything great about the standard iPhone 16 and supersizes it, meaning this is the handset to go for if you prefer a larger iPhone but don't want to spend big on the iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nThis year's model gets all the same benefits as the standard iPhone 16 \u2013 the Action button, the Camera Control button, Apple Intelligence compatibility, and so on \u2013 but the Plus also benefits from battery life that pretty much wipes the floor with its comparatively priced competition.\nIn our testing, the iPhone 16 Plus lasted a whopping 16 hours and 29 minutes; that's endurance to rival the iPhone 16 Pro Max. So, if battery life is your number one priority, we'd recommend going for this phone over the iPhone 16 Pro Max and saving yourself $300 / \u00a3300 / AU$550 (if you don't care about ProMotion, that is).\nRead our full iPhone 16 Plus review\nFAQs\nWhat is the best iPhone?\nThe best iPhone is usually one of the latest numbered models, but the value of each will depend on your specific needs. If you want a big screen, go for a Pro Max (the latest and greatest is the iPhone 16 Pro Max). For top specs in a smaller size, pick a Pro, and if you want to save some money, then get a standard model or the iPhone 16e.\nWhich iPhone is the best value for money?\nRight now, the iPhone that offers the best value for money is the iPhone 15, although the iPhone 16 is the more money-savvy choice if you're keen to use Apple Intelligence features. The iPhone 16e, meanwhile, is the outright cheapest iPhone, so go for that if you're simply looking for the most inexpensive option.\nHow to choose the best iPhone?\nA lot of iPhones are quite similar to one another, so choosing which model to buy mostly just means seeing what's different between them and finding the right fit for you.\nAll iPhones are powerful, and Apple supports them for a long time, so age and chipset needn't be a big deal, but if you don't plan on upgrading for a long time, then a newer model with a faster chipset is ideal.\nBigger factors, though, include the screen size \u2013 and bigger isn't always better. If you want something compact that you can easily slip into a small pocket, then consider Apple's 6.1-inch models. But if you plan on doing a lot of gaming or video-watching, something larger would be better.\nResolution and refresh rate are also worth paying attention to for the optimal visual experience \u2013 the higher the better in both cases, so ideal options will have things like a 120Hz refresh rate and a resolution above 1080p.\nCamera quality and battery life are important considerations, too, and you can't get a full picture of these just from a specs list, so read our full entries above (or click through to our detailed reviews) for insights into how each iPhone fares in those departments.\nHow we test\nWe've reviewed every iPhone on this list, meaning for each, we've passed our expert judgment on them after extensive testing. These reviews saw us use each phone as our main handset for at least a week, and often longer.\nIn the process, we would explore various use cases, including calls, texts, social media, video streaming, gaming, taking photos, and more, with some heavy use days and other lighter ones.\nIn short, we use our iPhones just like you would \u2013 but we make sure to test every key feature, as well as run benchmark tests, checking how long they take to charge, and more.\nUsing that data, we've then ranked each handset, factoring in price, value, and how they compare to one another, with a particular focus on their screens, designs, battery life, performance, and cameras.\n- You've reached the end of the page.

      "text": "This is what really happened with Siri and Apple Intelligence, according to Apple\nThere's no denying that Apple's Siri digital chatbot didn't exactly hold a place of honor at this year's WWDC 2025 keynote. Apple mentioned it, and reiterated that it was taking longer than it had anticipated to bring everyone the Siri it promised a year ago, saying the full Apple Integration would arrive \"in the coming year.\"\nApple has since confirmed this means 2026. That means we won't be seeing the kind of deep integration that would have let Siri use what it knew about you and your iOS-running iPhone to become a better digital companion in 2025. It won't, as part of the just-announced iOS 26, use app intents to understand what's happening on the screen and take action on your behalf based on that.\nI have my theories about the reason for the delay, most of which revolve around the tension between delivering a rich AI experience and Apple's core principles regarding privacy. They often seem at cross purposes. This, though, is guesswork. Only Apple can tell us exactly what's going on \u2013 and now they have.\nI, along with Tom's Guide Global Editor-in-Chief Mark Spoonauer, sat down shortly after the keynote with Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi and Apple Global VP of Marketing Greg Joswiak for a wide-ranging podcast discussion about virtually everything Apple unveiled during its 90-minute keynote.\nWe started by asking Federighi about what Apple delivered regarding Apple Intelligence, as well as the status of Siri, and what iPhone users might expect this year or next. Federighi was surprisingly transparent, offering a window into Apple's strategic thinking when it comes to Apple Intelligence, Siri, and AI.\nFar from nothing\nFederighi started by walking us through all that Apple has delivered with Apple Intelligence thus far, and, to be fair, it's a considerable amount\n\"We were very focused on creating a broad platform for really integrated personal experiences into the OS.\" recalled Federighi, referring to the original Apple Intelligence announcement at WWDC 2024.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAt the time, Apple demonstrated Writing Tools, summarizations, notifications, movie memories, semantic search of the Photos library, and Clean Up for photos. It delivered on all those features, but even as Apple was building those tools, it recognized, Federighi told us, that \"we could, on that foundation of large language models on device, private cloud compute as a foundation for even more intelligence, [and] semantic indexing on device to retrieve keep knowledge, build a better Siri.\"\nOver-confidence?\nA year ago, Apple's confidence in its ability to build such a Siri led it to demonstrate a platform that could handle more conversational context, mispeaking, Type to Siri, and a significantly redesigned UI. Again, all things Apple delivered.\n\"We also talked about [...] things like being able to invoke a broader range of actions across your device by app intents being orchestrated by Siri to let it do more things,\" added Federighi. \"We also talked about the ability to use personal knowledge from that semantic index so if you ask for things like, \"What's that podcast, that 'Joz' sent me?' that we could find it, whether it was in your messages or in your email, and call it out, and then maybe even act on it using those app intents. That piece is the piece that we have not delivered, yet.\"\nThis is known history. Apple overpromised and underdelivered, failing to deliver a vaguely promised end-of-year Apple Intelligence Siri update in 2024 and admitting by spring 2025 that it would not be ready any time soon. As to why it happened, it's been, up to now, a bit of a mystery. Apple is not in the habit of demonstrating technology or products that it does not know for certain that it will be able to deliver on schedule.\nFederighi, however, explained in some detail where things went awry, and how Apple progresses from here.\n\"We found that when we were developing this feature that we had, really, two phases, two versions of the ultimate architecture that we were going to create,\" he explained. \"Version one we had working here at the time that we were getting close to the conference, and had, at the time, high confidence that we could deliver it. We thought by December, and if not, we figured by spring, until we announced it as part of WWDC. Because we knew the world wanted a really complete picture of, 'What's Apple thinking about the implications of Apple intelligence and where is it going?'\"\nA tale of two architectures\nAs Apple was working on a V1 of the Siri architecture, it was also working on what Federighi called V2, \"a deeper end-to-end architecture that we knew was ultimately what we wanted to create, to get to a full set of capabilities that we wanted for Siri.\"\nWhat everyone saw during WWDC 2024 were videos of that V1 architecture, and that was the foundation for work that began in earnest after the WWDC 2024 reveal, in preparation for the full Apple Intelligence Siri launch.\n\"We set about for months, making it work better and better across more app intents, better and better for doing search,\" Federighi added. \"But fundamentally, we found that the limitations of the V1 architecture weren't getting us to the quality level that we knew our customers needed and expected. We realized that V1 architecture, you know, we could push and push and push and put in more time, but if we tried to push that out in the state it was going to be in, it would not meet our customer expectations or Apple standards, and that we had to move to the V2 architecture.\n\"As soon as we realized that, and that was during the spring, we let the world know that we weren't going to be able to put that out, and we were going to keep working on really shifting to the new architecture and releasing something.\"\nThat switch, though, and what Apple learned along the way, meant that Apple would not make the same mistake again, and promise a new Siri for a date that it could not guarantee to hit. Instead. Apple won't \"precommunicate a date,\" explained Federighi, \"until we have in-house, the V2 architecture delivering not just in a form that we can demonstrate for you all\u2026\"\nHe then joked that, while, actually, he \"could\" demonstrate a working V2 model, he was not going to do it. Then he added, more seriously, \"We have, you know, the V2 architecture, of course, working in-house, but we're not yet to the point where it's delivering at the quality level that I think makes it a great Apple feature, and so we're not announcing the date for when that's happening. We will announce the date when we're ready to seed it, and you're all ready to be able to experience it.\"\nI asked Federighi if, by V2 architecture, he was talking about a wholesale rebuilding of Siri, but Federighi disabused me of that notion.\n\"I should say the V2 architecture is not, it wasn't a star-over. The V1 architecture was sort of half of the V2 architecture, and now we extend it across, sort of make it a pure architecture that extends across the entire Siri experience. So we've been very much building up upon what we have been building for V1, but now extending it more completely, and that more homogeneous end-to-end architecture gives us much higher quality and much better capability. And so that's what we're building now.\"\nA different AI strategy\nSome might view Apple's failure to deliver the full Siri on its original schedule as a strategic stumble. But Apple's approach to AI and product is also utterly different than that of OpenAI or Google Gemini. It does not revolve around a singular product or a powerful chatbot. Siri is not necessarily the centerpiece we all imagined.\nFederighi doesn't dispute that \"AI is this transformational technology [\u2026] All that's growing out of this architecture is going to have decades-long impact across the industry and the economy, and much like the internet, much like mobility, and it's going to touch Apple's products and it's going to touch experiences that are well outside of Apple products.\"\nApple clearly wants to be part of this revolution, but on its terms and in ways that most benefit its users while, of course, protecting their privacy. Siri, though, was never the end game, as Federighi explained.\n\"When we started with Apple Intelligence, we were very clear: this wasn't about just building a chatbot. So, seemingly, when some of these Siri capabilities I mentioned didn't show up, people were like, 'What happened, Apple? I thought you were going to give us your chatbot. That was never the goal, and it remains not our primary goal.\"\nSo what is the goal? I think it may be fairly obvious from the WWDC 2025 keynote. Apple is intent on integrating Apple Intelligence across all its platforms. Instead of heading over to a singular app like ChatGPT for your AI needs, Apple's putting it, in a way, everywhere. It's done, Federighi explains, \"in a way that meets you where you are, not that you're going off to some chat experience in order to get things done.\"\nApple understands the allure of conversational bots. \"I know a lot of people find it to be a really powerful way to gather their thoughts, brainstorm [...] So, sure, these are great things,\" Federighi says. \"Are they the most important thing for Apple to develop? Well, time will tell where we go there, but that's not the main thing we set out to do at this time.\"\nSee below for the full interview with Federighi and Joswiak.\nYou might also like\nA 38-year industry veteran and award-winning journalist, Lance has covered technology since PCs were the size of suitcases and \u201con line\u201d meant \u201cwaiting.\u201d He\u2019s a former Lifewire Editor-in-Chief, Mashable Editor-in-Chief, and, before that, Editor in Chief of PCMag.com and Senior Vice President of Content for Ziff Davis, Inc.

      "text": "New iPhone 17 report lends weight to rumors of major display and camera upgrades, and a pricey Apple foldable\nDetails we've heard before, but from a reputable source\n- The iPhone 17 has again been rumored to have a 120Hz ProMotion display\n- The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will reportedly have three 48MP cameras\n- The foldable iPhone could inherit some iPhone 17 Air tech and cost $2,000\nThis could be a big year for iPhone upgrades, because along with a reportedly new design for most iPhone 17 models and talk of a completely new phone in the form of the iPhone 17 Air, we\u2019re also hearing about numerous potential spec upgrades.\nBloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman \u2013 who has proven generally reliable for Apple information in the past \u2013 has (via PhoneArena) detailed several upgrades that he expects from the iPhone 17 series, including the presence of a ProMotion display on the base iPhone 17.\nThat would mean its refresh rate could reach 120Hz, which is double the 60Hz of the iPhone 16, and is in line with what the iPhone 16 Pro series \u2013 along with most Android phones \u2013 offer.\nA higher refresh rate can make animations and scrolling appear smoother. But with ProMotion the refresh rate would also be able to drop far lower than the 60Hz that the iPhone 16 always runs at, which could help conserve battery life when a high refresh rate isn\u2019t needed, and would allow for Apple\u2019s always-on display and StandBy features to work on the phone.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve heard talk of a 120Hz display for the base iPhone 17, but hearing this from Gurman adds credence to the claim.\nGurman has also echoed another claim \u2013 namely that the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will have three 48MP rear cameras, which would mean an upgrade for the currently 12MP telephoto camera. Again, we\u2019ve heard this elsewhere already, but hearing it again \u2013 and from such a reputable sources \u2013 makes it seem all the more likely.\nA foldable success\nFinally, Gurman has shed some light on the long-rumored foldable iPhone, claiming that this will launch next year, with a similar design to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 and many of the same technologies as the iPhone 17 Air.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nExactly what technologies he's referring to isn\u2019t clear, but we\u2019d imagine it might be similarly slim, and may have some similar compromises, like just one rear camera.\nApparently, the foldable iPhone will retail for around $2,000 (roughly \u00a31,540 / AU$3,170), but Gurman believes that despite a likely high price this phone could be a success for Apple.\nAll that said, we\u2019d remain more skeptical of these foldable iPhone claims than the information about the iPhone 17 series, as this phone is probably further out, and we haven\u2019t heard as much about it.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "iPhone 17 Pro again tipped to get a vapor chamber \u2013 here's why that'd be a big deal\n- The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max are again rumored to have a vapor chamber\n- However, the base iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air might not have one\n- A vapor chamber could prevent overheating, allowing for better sustained performance and improved battery life\nA few months ago, we heard that the iPhone 17 series could gain a vapor chamber to help prevent overheating, and now another source has echoed these claims \u2013 and even provided some evidence.\nLeaker Majin Bu (via MacRumors) claims to have learned from an \u201cinternal source\u201d that both the iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max will have a vapor chamber. This will supposedly be a Pro-exclusive upgrade, which is at odds with that earlier leak, which pointed to all four models getting a vapor chamber.\nIn any case, we\u2019d take this latest tip with a pinch of salt, as Bu has a mixed track record, but they\u2019ve supplied an image of what they claim is part of a vapor chamber intended for these upcoming phones (below).\nThat supposedly leaked image \u2013 coupled with the fact that multiple sources have now mentioned a vapor chamber \u2013 suggests that at least some iPhone 17 models may well be getting this upgrade.\nKeeping it cool\nIn layman's terms, a vapor chamber should be able to cool these phones more effectively than the graphite sheets used for heat dissipation in current iPhones.\nA vapor chamber is a small metal chamber full of liquid, and that liquid turns to vapor when it heats up, allowing the heat to dissipate across the chamber\u2019s surface area. It works as a way of pulling heat away from internal components, which has several advantages.\nFor one thing, this prevents damage to components from overheating, but it should also reduce the need for thermal throttling \u2013 that is, performance reductions to cool the phone down. So, even if you\u2019re pushing the iPhone 17 Pro hard with gaming or other demanding applications, it should be able to stay relatively cool and maintain its performance better.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThis should also make the phone more energy efficient, so battery life could be improved too.\nClearly, there are a lot of potential advantages to a vapor chamber, so we hope this leak proves accurate. We should find out in September, as that\u2019s when the iPhone 17 series is likely to launch.\nYou might also like\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "Google Gemini explained: Everything you need to know about Google\u2019s next-gen AI\nAlong with OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot and Apple Intelligence, Google Gemini is one of the dominant forces in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) and chatbots. Gemini is both the name for Google chatbot and the LLM that powers it, and it's free to use via a web browser, or on your mobile, but there's a paid-for version called Gemini Advanced that has some juicy features, like AI video generation with Veo 2.\nGoogle Gemini burst onto the scene in February 2024 and immediately made some big waves in the AI world, but it was the release of Gemini Live at the Made for Google event in August 2024 that really put it on the map. Gemini Live is a version of Gemini that runs on mobile phones, even the iPhone, and enables you to have free flowing conversations about complex topics using your voice instead of having to type on the keyboard.\nBut is Gemini Live enough to defeat Apple's AI-enhanced Siri (if and when it finally arrives) or ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode? What can it do right now, and what about in the future? And if you want to use Gemini, how exactly do you do that? We\u2019ve taken a deep dive into the world of Gemini to find the answers to all these questions and more. If you\u2019re curious about Google\u2019s latest AI efforts, this is the place to be.\nWhat is Google Gemini?\nGemini is Google\u2019s large language model (LLM), which is currently up to version 2.5 Pro. What\u2019s an LLM? It\u2019s the system that underpins the types of AI tools you\u2019ve probably seen and interacted with on the internet. For example, GPT-4 powers ChatGPT-4o, OpenAI\u2019s chatbot.\nGemini is more than an AI model, though, as it\u2019s also the name and identity for it's chatbot, previously known as Bard. Essentially, Google has simplified things by calling both the underlying model and chatbot itself Gemini.\nFurthermore, there\u2019s a free Gemini app for both Android and iOS now, and Gemini can replace Google Assistant on your Android phone if you wish. There's also a free version of Google Gemini that is accessible via any internet browser.\nOn top of all this, Google has rebranded its Duet AI service, aimed at businesses, as Gemini for Workspace, with a whole bunch of productivity-related chops on offer.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThe final twist is that as well as the basic (free) version of Gemini for consumers, there is also premium offering for the AI known as Gemini Advanced, which is available through a subscription called Google One AI Premium. Gemini Advanced gives you more access to Gemini's more capable LLMs, and more access to the Gemini Deep Research feature.\nTo sum up, all Google\u2019s AI properties are now under the Gemini umbrella to simplify things, whether that\u2019s AI for consumers or businesses, and whether accessing Gemini via the web, or the assistant or app on your smartphone.\nWhat can Gemini do?\nThe short answer to this question is: a lot. But you probably want us to elaborate a bit more than that.\nAs we\u2019ve just discussed, Gemini is an expansive umbrella for a whole lot of AI features and functionality delivered via different avenues. It has the same generative capabilities as other chatbots, like ChatGPT, so if you tell Gemini where you are going on your next trip, it will be able to help you pack. Or ask it to explain who Socrates was and sit back for a history lesson. It can answer questions, summarize text, write code and translate.\nGemini is a multimodal LLM. In other words, it can deal with various forms of input and output, including text, code, audio, images and videos. That gives it a lot of flexibility to perform a wide range of tasks.\nFor instance, you can upload an image (or take one with your smartphone) and Gemini can analyze the image and tell you things about it. Paste some code into the Gemini prompt box and ask it to rewrite it and Gemini can do that.\nRecently the ability to edit images has also been added to Gemini, so you can upload an image, and ask it to change it in some way.\nThere are four separate LLMs that Google has implemented with its AI. They are Gemini Ultra, Pro, Flash and Nano. If you go to the Gemini website and ask the chatbot a question you'll be using Gemini 2.0 or 2.5 Flash, which is Google's lightweight model, optimized for speed and efficiency.\nIf you are a member of the paid tier via Gemini Advanced then you get access to Gemini 2.5 Pro, which is the largest model, and good for highly complex tasks.\nFinally, there's the Deep Research with 2.5 Pro model, which is a research agent, capable of performing in-depth research on a subject for you, while you're free to go off and do something else.\nYou can also talk to Gemini with your voice and have it talk back by selecting the \"Go Live\" option when chatting to the LLM. This works best on the new Pixel 9 phones, which have the ability to share their screen and camera with Gemini, so it can 'see' what you're looking at and you can ask it questions about it.\nGoogle has developing its own answer to Midjourney in Imagen 3, which is integrated into Gemini, too. You can use Imagen 3 through Gemini, by asking it to simply create an image of a scene or person. Google is also developing native image generation for Gemini, which we'd expect to be added very soon.\nRecently AI video generation has also been added using Veo 2. For this to work you need to be a Gemini Advanced subscriber.\nIf you're a Gemini Advanced subscriber then you'll also find that Gemini is hooked into the likes of Gmail, Google Maps, and YouTube. So, if you ask it for sightseeing recommendations, for example, it will flag them up in Google Maps.\nThese are some nifty abilities for sure, and those with Android smartphones get even more mileage for free with the Gemini app. As already mentioned, this can replace Google Assistant on an Android device, if you wish, running queries and working its AI magic via other Google services (Maps, search, even Assistant itself, which isn\u2019t actually chucked off your phone as such, and still lurks underneath).\nThat choice may lead you to wonder: is Gemini a good replacement for Google Assistant? Well, we covered this extensively in our hands-on with Gemini on Android, and there are certainly drawbacks with the AI. Gemini is noticeably slower than Google Assistant, and the AI still has bugs.\nThat said, the initial Gemini on Android experience was a lot wonkier than it is now. An example that springs to mind is that Gemini was supposed to deal with smart home gadgets, but failed in that task when we tried it initially - but more recently, this feature has come good and now works.\nIt seems that Google is ironing out the problems with Gemini on mobile pretty swiftly, which is heartening to see, and the results with the Gemini app can be impressive. There are still wrinkles to smooth over in terms of replacing Google Assistant on Android, but that should come in time.\nOverall, then, the freebie version does give you a lot to get on with, especially for Pixel 9 users. However, the paid take on Gemini is actually far more in-depth.\nFor those who use Google\u2019s productivity apps and have a Google Workspace account, Gemini is available in Google Docs, Gmail, and more.\nWhen was Gemini released?\nGoogle Gemini was released on February 8 2024, with Google confirming that it replaced Bard which was put out to pasture. Gemini was available immediately, in both its free form, and the paid version, Gemini Advanced. Google also began the rollout of the Android app in the US straight away.\nThe Gemini app is also available for Samsung phones, read our Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 review, and for iPhone and iPad.\nIs Google Gemini free?\nThe standard version of Google Gemini is free, but it\u2019s more limited than the paid spin on the AI. Those who pay a subscription for Gemini Advanced get a lot more depth in terms of access to Gemini's more advanced capabilities as well as AI video creation.\nHow much is Gemini Advanced? Google charges $19.99 (\u00a318.99 / AU$32.99) per month, but you can try it out for a limited time for free, as a one-month trial is currently available. The subscription comes with other benefits, though, as Gemini Advanced is actually part of the Google One AI Premium Plan, which also provides 2TB of cloud storage among other extras.\nGiven that Google One with 2TB of storage already costs $9.99 / \u00a37.99 / AU$12.49 per month, if you need a cloud storage locker, Gemini Advanced looks a more tempting value proposition.\nHow do I use Google Gemini?\nThe way you use Google Gemini depends on device you're using.\nOn a PC or laptop, you can head to the Gemini website and use the AI there for free in the typical way you interact with an online chatbot. If you subscribe to Gemini Advanced, you get the full AI experience including AI video generation, sharper responses, more access to advanced LLMs for dealing with complex tasks and demanding creative needs, and the other benefits we\u2019ve outlined above.\nOn mobile you can use the Gemini app on your Android phone (or replace Google Assistant with Gemini, as noted) or on iOS where you get all the same features you'll find in the browser, but with the addition of Gemini Live for conversing to Gemini using your voice.\nIf you are on a smartphone like the Google Pixel 9, then you can use Gemini Live with enhanced screen sharing and camera control features.\nGemini vs GPT-4: what\u2019s the difference?\nHow does Gemini stack up against GPT-4 in the battle of the large language models?\nFor one thing, when Gemini was first revealed, Google claimed it\u2019s more advanced than GPT-4. In a blog post, Google showed results from eight text-based benchmarks, with Gemini winning in seven of those tests. Across 10 multimodal benchmarks, Gemini came out on top in every one, according to Google at least.\nThat would seem to imply that Gemini is the superior system, but it\u2019s not quite so straightforward, of course. GPT-4 came out in March 2023, and Gemini 1.5 Pro came out in February and Gemini 1.5 Flash came out in May 2024. ChatGPT now has many more advanced models like 4o and o3, not to mention the new ChatGPT-4.5. Gemini is now up to 2.5 Flash and 2.5 Pro models.\nOn the whole, features are roughly comparable between ChatGPT Plus and Gemini Advanced, and both have a free tier. It may simply come down to personal choice and finding the chatbot that fits your person style best.\nYou might also like\nAlex Blake has been fooling around with computers since the early 1990s, and since that time he's learned a thing or two about tech.

      "text": "The iPhone 17 could get a mirrorless camera feature to improve your portrait shots\nThe iPhone 16 is not yet upon us, but that hasn\u2019t stopped rumors flying about what the iPhone 17 could be packing when it arrives in 2025. The latest report suggests that Apple\u2019s future phone could boast an almighty upgrade to its camera tech that would specifically benefit Apple\u2019s already impressive Portrait mode.\nThat idea comes from The Information (via MacRumors), with a new report claiming that Apple is planning a camera with a mechanical aperture for at least one device in the iPhone 17 roster. That would be a major departure from the lens system used in every iPhone so far.\nWith the new mechanical system, you\u2019d be able to adjust the size of your iPhone\u2019s aperture, thereby tweaking how much light reaches the sensor when you take a picture. This in turn can affect an image\u2019s depth of field \u2013 that is, which parts of the image are in focus and which are blurred \u2013 which is what helps give Portrait mode shots their unique quality.\nThis would presumably give you far more control over how your Portrait mode shots look, and it might also result in more natural-looking images. Right now, Portrait mode uses software to create its depth of field effects, but with a mechanical aperture these effects would be created optically, as they are by camera lenses, perhaps giving more true-to-life results, and potentially eliminating issues where the iPhone struggles to separate the subject from the background.\nMechanical mastery\nIf this rumor comes to fruition, Apple wouldn't be the first company to experiment with putting mechanical apertures in mobile cameras. Some the best Android phones have included the feature in the past, including those made by Samsung, although the Korean company has since dropped the feature.\nWhile Samsung didn't offer an official reason for the change, it might have come down to manufacturing complexities or advances in its own software capabilities. But if The Information\u2019s report is accurate, it suggests that Apple feels a mechanical aperture is still worth pursuing, despite potential issues.\nThe feature could well be limited to the flagship iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone 17 Pro Max models, given its complexity and likely high cost, and if Apple is indeed looking at this we\u2019ll likely hear more about it before the iPhone 17 range launches in 2025.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nYou might also like\nAlex Blake has been fooling around with computers since the early 1990s, and since that time he's learned a thing or two about tech.

      "text": "iPhone 17 vs iPhone 17 Pro \u2013 what are the rumored differences?\nThere's less than a week to go until the much-anticipated Apple event, where we expect to see full reveals for the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max, and potentially even an iPhone 17 Air.\nI've previously written about the three features Apple needs to include in the iPhone 17 to make me upgrade this year. And in this guide, I'm turning my attention to the key rumored differences between the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro.\nLeaks and rumors about both phones began swirling a number of months ago, and they've only increased in intensity in recent weeks. They hint at significant differences between the Pro and non-Pro models this year, so read on for a roundup of the biggest rumors.\n1. Power, power, power\nThe iPhone 17 will almost definitely ship with an A19 chipset, while the iPhone 17 Pro will likely include the A19 Pro chip. The Pro version will supposedly be built on a newer and more powerful 3nm process, which will be ideally suited to running the advanced AI features found in iOS 26. It'll also be faster across the board, which is impressive given that the iPhone 16 Pro is still one of the most powerful phones you can buy.\nThe iPhone 17 Pro is also rumored to have 12GB of RAM rather than the 8GB/12GB that's expected to ship in the standard model. This will further enhance multitasking and AI performance, and extend the power gap between the Pro and standard models.\nIt's worth noting that many users won't need the superior power of the iPhone 17 Pro (the iPhone 17 will still be fast!), but if you're a keen mobile gamer or are ready to embrace Apple's AI features, it'll be the better option.\n2. Better cameras\nIf you're not too concerned about AI performance but do get excited about camera technology, then this rumor will really get your mouth watering.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nNumerous reports suggest that both phones will receive a new and improved 24MP front-facing camera, but it's the rear camera system where we'll likely see a significant divergence.\nThe iPhone 17 will likely have a dual-camera setup with a wide and ultra-wide lens, while the iPhone 17 Pro could have a triple-lens system including an upgraded 48MP telephoto lens with up to 8x optical zoom. So, if phone photography is your gig, then this would be one of the main reasons to opt for the Pro version over the standard model.\nAlso rumored, although less likely, is 8K video recording for the Pro model, as well as a mechanical aperture system for better depth of field control.\n3. Top-end display features\nThe iPhone 16 Pro featured a gorgeous ProMotion display with a superior 120Hz refresh rate. If the rumors are true, then we're expecting to see a static 120Hz display included on the standard iPhone 17.\nIf that's the case, you'd be right to ask what will set the Pro version apart.\nWell, some of the key distinctions could be an Always-On display (Apple's ProMotion feature allows for an adaptive 1-120Hz refresh rate), a smaller Dynamic Island, and a display with even thinner bezels. All in all, this would result in a more immersive viewing experience for Pro users.\n4. A new-look design\nI doubt that design, on its own, would cause anyone to make the jump from standard to Pro, but it's still worth mentioning because there are a lot of rumors that both phones will be getting a new look this year.\nThe standard iPhone 17 may feature a new design with a mix of aluminum and glass, with a glass area around the MagSafe charger. The iPhone 17 Pro, meanwhile, is said to feature an updated camera bump that could look similar to the one found on the Google Pixel 10.\nThis sleek horizontal \"camera bar\" design would ensure that both phones look markedly different from one another this year, with the Pro model arguably looking the more interesting of the two.\n5. An innovative vapor chamber\nLast but not least, there are a number of rumors that the iPhone 17 Pro will feature new vapor chamber cooling technology. This tipped iPhone 17 Pro upgrade is one of our mobile computing editor's favorite rumored features, and I can understand why.\nThe inclusion of a new chamber is likely required to handle the additional heat that the A19 Pro will generate while performing more demanding tasks. This chamber would allow for greater heat dissipation and prevent performance throttling, which will also help the iPhone 17 Pro become one of the best gaming phones.\nIt works by \"using a liquid-filled metal chamber that lets said liquid change to a gas when it absorbs heat. This vapor then spreads across the metal surface to dissipate heat away from sensitive components like the chipset.\" A similar feature is already found on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and will be a fantastic addition to the iPhone 17 Pro.\nCrucially, though, the base iPhone 17 isn't expected to get this vapor chamber cooling technology, so again, power users and committed mobile gamers will likely want to go Pro this year.\nYou might also like\nPaul is a digital expert.

      "text": "Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra cameras versus iPhone 16 Pro Max cameras \u2013 12 hours with two of the best, and I am spoiled for choices\nUnpacked was quite a day with a total of four new Samsung Galaxy S25 phones (including the surprise Edge), and if you step back and look at the Unpacked event, you'd be right to think of it as an AI event. The lion's share of big updates revolves around artificial intelligence and agentic actions. But the reality is that such capabilities don't arrive on a new device fully baked or at least prepared to do your bidding. Samsung's AI system needs to learn about you.\nAs I let the new Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and Galaxy AI get a hold of me, I turned my attention to the most obvious features, and probably the one people care most about: photography.\nGranted, the S25 Ultra didn't completely remake the camera system. Of the five lenses, only one got a major update over the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. So now we have:\n- 200MP Main lens\n- 50MP 5X zoom\n- 50MP UW (New!)\n- 10MP 3X zoom\n- 12MP selfie camera\nThe expectation is that just one of these cameras would provide better photography than what I got with any previous Ultra model. I also, though, had to consider that Samsung's updated ProVisual engine might improve photography across all lenses.\nAs soon as I got through the lengthy smartphone setup, I started taking photos with all of these cameras. But what fun is doing analysis without comparison? I had my Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max in my pocket, and it has lots of great lenses, too:\n- 48MP main\n- 48MP ultrawide\n- 12MP 5x optical zoom\n- 12MP FaceTime camera\nMy simple goal was to take the same picture with each phone; I chose the lenses mostly at random, but tried to steer clear of any adjustments on exposure and focus.\nAs for what to photograph, I was in luck. I'd situated myself in the middle of the lush Plaza Del Ceasar Chavez, a green space in the middle of San Jose filled with towering trees, birds, and green grass (real and astroturf).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThere'd be ample opportunity to grab a wide variety of photos in the park and, I found, over the ensuing hours and as the sun set and the exposure conditions changed.\nWhat I learned\nWe have an excellent collection of cameras here, broadly speaking. Left untouched, with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra shooting all photos in default settings (the main camera shooting in 12MP mode and the new 50MP UW also shooting in 12MP and the iPhone 16 Pro Max main camera in 24MP mode) I found that the Samsung Galaxy Ultra generally had more detail and the iPhone 16 Pro Max still did a better job with color truth.\nThese differences are not visually significant. At a glance, the photography from the new S25 Ultra is excellent. It's clear that Samsung's work on its ProVisual engine is paying off, though. Apple has always leaned away from over-saturated colors and more visual truth, and those efforts are not always clear until you see them in contrast.\nThe park features a mix of green palm trees and deciduous trees, all rising into what, on that day, was a perfectly blue sky. As is often the case, the blue sky in photos taken with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is a crystal-clear blue that might not fully exist in nature.\nThe S25 Ultra's efforts to maintain the sharp blues against a verdant green and with sunlight peaking through the leaves produced one odd effect: just the tiniest bit of color blooming around some of the palm fronds.\nIt's faint and hard to see on computer screens, but it is evident on the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra screen. It's a small aberration and only visible if you zoom into the photo, but I think Samsung might want to adjust its ProVisual algorithm just a tiny bit.\nCan't escape AI that easily\nDuring my photography excursion, I heard the distinct \"rat-tat-tat\" of a woodpecker and then spotted the acorn variety soon after.\nI'm an avid birder, but I lacked my DSLR and 300mm lens at that moment. I quietly snuck closer to the busy bird and used both smartphones to take some photos.\nThis was the one instance where I granted myself permission to use digital zoom, just a little bit.\nThe 50MP telephoto on the Galaxy S25 Ultra and the 12MP telephoto on the iPhone 16 Pro Max proved insufficient to get me as close as I wanted to the birds, so I switched to 10X zoom on the S25 Ultra, which is basically a 12MP crop of its 50MP sensor.\nI was surprised at just how good the S25 Ultra photos look and noted that the iPhone 16 Pro Max's zoom (even with a digital push) didn't look nearly as good.\nAfter assessing the differences and deeming the S25 Ultra's nature shots superior, I decided to have a little fun.\nI took my favorite Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra acorn woodpecker picture, one where it's clinging to the tree trunk and glancing to its left, and popped it into Galaxy AI's Sketch to Image feature.\nI used my finger to sketch a rudimentary rodent climbing the tree next to the bird. A moment later, Galaxy AI produced a shockingly realistic white mouse climbing the tree. It even included a subtle shadow under the mouse.\nIn the final image, it really looks like the bird is staring at the rodent. I showed it to others, and they were fooled and wondered how I captured the shot. I had to admit that I only captured part of it.\nAt night\nNight photography looks great on both phones, with each displaying its tendencies to either punch up its colors or keep it more muted and real.\nEvery night shot from the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is brighter than their counterparts from the iPhone 16 Pro Max. This effect is especially evident in the new and more powerful S25 Ultra's 50MP UW.\nI suspect most people would prefer Samsung's approach to Apple's. However, I know that Samsung's version of reality is, well, a bit unrealistic. Essentially, your camera preferences may come down to taste.\nI also did a quick Portrait mode selfie with both front-facing cameras and found that while both images looked great, Samsung's default made me look a bit younger and less ruddy than I do on the all-about-truth iPhone 16 Pro Max.\nWith just a day of use under my belt, it's too soon to tell if Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's cameras are the best S-series cameras I've ever used (they may well be) or if they beat the iPhone 16 Pro Max, but I can draw some preliminary conclusions.\nThe 50MP UW upgrade is well-spent. It adds more visual clarity and brightness to most ultra-wide-angle shots. The macro, which also uses the 50MP UW, also got better and seems at least as good as what I find in the iPhone's 16 Pro Max's 48MP UW.\nIn general, I think Samsung and Apple are on slightly different imagery paths, and I appreciate both of them. As for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, I think I will greatly enjoy using this camera array.\nYou might also like\n- Check out our hands-on Samsung Galaxy S25 review\n- And read our hands-on Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus review\n- Best Samsung phone: top Galaxy handsets ranked\nA 38-year industry veteran and award-winning journalist, Lance has covered technology since PCs were the size of suitcases and \u201con line\u201d meant \u201cwaiting.\u201d He\u2019s a former Lifewire Editor-in-Chief, Mashable Editor-in-Chief, and, before that, Editor in Chief of PCMag.com and Senior Vice President of Content for Ziff Davis, Inc.

      "text": "The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra could have the iPhone 17 Pro Max beat in at least one key way\n- The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra could be far slimmer than the iPhone 17 Pro Max\n- However, not all sources agree on how thick Samsung's phone will be\n- Samsung's upcoming flagship might also have more RAM than its predecessor, among other spec changes\nThe Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra and the iPhone 17 Pro Max are arguably two of the most highly anticipated upcoming phone releases, but while they\u2019re both sure to excel in most areas, the Galaxy S26 Ultra may have the edge in at least one way.\nAccording to @UniverseIce \u2013 a leaker with a good track record \u2013 the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra will be under 8mm thick, while the iPhone 17 Pro Max will be 8.76mm thick.\nWe\u2019ve heard roughly that thickness for the iPhone 17 Pro Max before, with another source saying it will be 8.75mm thick, but this is the first we\u2019re hearing of the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra\u2019s thickness.\nThe designs of iPhone16 Pro max and Galaxy S25 Ultra are the closest at the moment, and their length, width and thickness are basically the same.However, iPhone17 Pro Max and Galaxy S26 Ultra will be the beginning of two completely different designs. The thickness of iPhone 17\u2026July 6, 2025\nIf this latest leak is correct then the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra will be significantly slimmer than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, and \u2013 as the source points out \u2013 this could also be a sign of diverging design philosophies for these two brands, as while the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and iPhone 16 Pro Max are almost identically thick, at 8.2mm and 8.3mm respectively. This change would see Samsung slimming down its flagship, while Apple goes in the opposite direction.\nThis source also claims that the weight difference between these phones will be even greater, though they don't specify how much each handset will weigh.\nHowever, while the source of this leak has a good track record, we would take it with a pinch of salt, especially as another Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra specs leak suggests the phone will instead be 8.1mm thick.\nThis comes from leaker @PandaFlashPro (via NotebookCheck), and while they don\u2019t have quite as much of a track record to go on as @UniverseIce, they have correctly leaked Samsung information in the past.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nA new chipset and more RAM\nThis isn\u2019t the only Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra detail @PandaFlashPro leaked, as they also claim it will have a Snapdragon 8 Elite 2 chipset, and a similar 6.9-inch screen to the current model, just with different (presumably smaller) bezels.\nAdditionally, they state that the number and layout of camera lenses will remain the same, just without the large camera rings found on the S25 Ultra, and that there will once again be a 200MP main camera, but that this will be packing a new lens.\nThere will also apparently once again be a 50MP ultra-wide camera, a 50MP 5x telephoto, and a 3x telephoto lens that may or may not have a new sensor.\nIn the case of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra the 3x telephoto has a 10MP sensor, but supposedly the company hasn\u2019t decided whether to replace this or not. The front-facing camera though will apparently be improved, with new features like 4K 120fps slow-motion video recording.\n@PandaFlashPro also claims that storage will remain unchanged, with 256GB, 512GB, and 1TB configurations set to be offered, and all of these are said to come with 16GB of RAM, while in the case of the Galaxy S25 Ultra they come with 12GB.\nOther listed specs include a 20% larger vapor chamber, and the return of a 5,000mAh battery with 45W wired charging. As with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra it\u2019s also said to support Qi2 magnetic wireless charging \u2013 but only with the addition of a magnetic case.\nBut with the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra not likely to land until early next year, we\u2019d take all of this with a pinch of salt, as it\u2019s still very early for leaks and rumors.

And if you want one of the best folding phones, you'll be using Android.\nFor those who want something a bit more familiar, the Samsung Galaxy S25 series gets two mentions with the Galaxy S25 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Plus. The Google Pixel 9 series holds down several spots, for now \u2013 the Google 10 series has been released, but we're still in the process of testing the newest Google phones for our in-depth reviews.\nSome people still have an idea of Android phones as slower than iPhones, with worse cameras and a lack of access to key apps \u2013 but this just isn't true. The phones on this list are equipped with cutting-edge chipsets, fantastic camera systems, and often come with more features than an equivalently priced iPhone.\nAnd for those on a budget, Android phones are the way to go. Our list of the best cheap phones is full of Android handsets, and you'll find the Pixel 9a representing for the budget-ized flagships on this list. Keep reading for our picks for the best Android phones.\nQuick List\nBest overall\nThe OnePlus 13 simply blew me away with amazing performance, superlative battery life, and the most durable and lasting design OnePlus has created. The software is the best Android interface design, and I could simply go on and on about how much I enjoyed this phone.\nRead more below\nBest AI\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL bring an all-new look to the Pixel family, with premium materials and cool color options. They also have fun AI features, with more on the way, and the best cameras I've used on a Pixel phone. If you want the latest AI features from Google, you need to have the Pixel 9 Pro (or its follow up, the Pixel 10 Pro \u2013 watch out for our review soon)\nRead more below\nBest camera\nA titanium design, a new 50MP ultra-wide camera, rounded corners and a whole lot of AI make the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra one of the very best Android phones money can buy right now.\nRead more below\nBest premium\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus is the best premium Android phone, with great features stolen from the S25 Ultra, and nothing extraneous.

You don't get the free year of premium AI, but the color options are brighter, and maybe AI isn't your thing.\nRead more below\nBest budget\nThe Pixel 9a is the latest mid-range Pixel, and even though it's priced to move off the shelves, it still gets seven years of Android updates. It may not be a looker, but it still takes great photos, like you expect from Pixel.\nRead more below\nBest folding\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is our pick for the best folding phone, and as every folding phone on the market runs Android it's here on our list of the best Android phones to represent for its class. With the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and Android 16 pre-installed, this is the best folding phone for Android fans.\nThe best Android phone in 2025\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBelow, you'll find full write-ups for each of the best Android phones in our list. We've tested each model extensively, so you can be sure that our recommendations can be trusted.\nThe best Android phone\n1. OnePlus 13\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe OnePlus 13 is a phone that can do almost nothing wrong. It tops our charts in performance with its Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor. It's also the best phone for battery life, thanks to the gigantic 6,000 mAh battery inside. It helps that you can charge it faster than almost any other phone, even if you're charging wirelessly. It's simply an astonishing phone all around, and it's easily our favorite Android phone.\nIn my review, I noted that every complaint I've had about OnePlus has magically become one of the great strengths of the OnePlus 13. I used to complain that OnePlus phones weren't water resistant, and now the OnePlus 13 is IP69 rated. I watched OnePlus reps wash the phone in a dishwashing machine, including the heat cycle. It's a very durable phone.\nI complain about a lack of wireless charging, and now OnePlus offers 50W wireless AirVOOC charging. A OnePlus 13 can charge wirelessly faster than a wired iPhone. But that doesn't matter, because the battery can easily last for two days.\nI like everything about this phone. I even like the cases that OnePlus sells, because they have magnets that line up my OnePlus 13 perfectly with all my MagSafe accessories. If you're considering a switch from the iPhone, or have friends who might need a push, this is the phone to push them.\nRead our full OnePlus 13 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Don\u2019t let sticker shock scare you away, OnePlus offers discounts and trade-in bonuses to help. You just can\u2019t get one at the Verizon store (try Best Buy). | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | A more professional look and an incredible feel with the new vegan microfiber. Every color is unique and outstanding, but the blue is the one to get, and definitely get a OnePlus case. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | The best display on any smartphone in terms of color, and it also looks great with the curving edges sloping down to the frame. It could be brighter, but it\u2019s a winner. | 5 / 5 |\nSoftware | The best Android interface software, but I wish there was more to take advantage of all that power. Eventually AI may come along, but for now OnePlus isn\u2019t pushing AI tools too hard. This phone is refreshing to use all around. | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | The best cameras for action photos, even at night, and great pics all around. It does more with 3x zoom than some phones managed with 10x zoom. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | You won\u2019t find a faster phone, according to our benchmarks. In the real world, it was harder to find the fast lane, but the interface was incredibly snappy and responsive. | 5 / 5 |\nBattery | The longest battery life, thanks to a larger battery and the efficient Snapdragon processor, though OnePlus has managed to fit more battery inside without making the phone thicker. Oh, and it charges stupidly fast. | 5 / 5 |\nThe best Android AI\n2. Google Pixel 9 Pro & Pixel 9 Pro XL\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Google Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro Xl introduced a fresh design to the Pixel, with a sleek camera pill that replaces the bar. Despite this makeover, I still enjoyed using these phones with their signature Pixel strengths: innovative AI, impressive cameras, and a vibrant display that outshines the competition in brightness and color.\nGoogle continues its display reign with the Pixel 9 Pro's Super Actua screen, which I found to be exceptionally bright, and I appreciated the adaptive 1-120Hz refresh rate. This display is truly great, even in bright sunlight, making it ideal for outdoor photography.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro delivers fantastic photos and AI-enhanced video with Video Boost, though I found the camera controls to be a bit fidgety. It produced some of the best photos among all of the best camera phones I've tested, and it's probably my second-favorite camera after the iPhone 16 Pro family. Google Photos AI editing beats the current state of iPhone Photos editing by a wide margin.\nIf you want the most advanced smartphone AI, you need to get the Pixel 9 Pro or Pixel 9 Pro XL, because Google keeps some of its best features exclusive to these phones. You can Circle to Search on any new Android, but if you want an AI to screen your spam calls, you need a Pixel.\nEven features that are on most Android phones, like the recording app that transcribes for you, worked much better on the Pixel 9 Pro in my tests than on competing phones. For everything AI now and into the future, the Pixel 9 Pro is my top choice for Android phones.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9 Pro review and our Google Pixel 9 Pro XL review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | It\u2019s a great phone all around, but performance lags significantly versus other phones in this price range, so maybe wait for a discount or a bundle deal. | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Excellent new design; the biggest change to Pixel phones in four years. Fantastic materials and a more modern look. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | Google offers the best smartphone screens around on the Pixel 9 Pro, and it\u2019s surprising the company doesn\u2019t crow louder. Super-bright \u2013 be careful to not overheat. | 5 / 5 |\nSoftware | With a grain of salt and a sense of humor, the AI stuff is A-Okay. Google avoids bad AI stereotypes, and gives us a nice glimpse of the future for mobile AI. | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | Fantastic cameras rival the best camera phones you can buy. Great new features, including Add Me for AI group photos. Camera settings are too difficult to manage. | 5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Performance lags significantly, both in benchmark testing and the real world. This phone lags if you push too hard, and Google wants you to push too hard. Seven years ahead? We\u2019ll see. | 3 / 5 |\nBattery | Solid battery life beats the iPhone, and the phone has no trouble lasting all day. You\u2019ll want to use the cameras, so pack an extra charger, but if you\u2019re careful this phone lasts no problem. I wish the charging was as fast as Google makes it seem. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best Android camera\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nYou won't find a phone that does more than the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but where this phone really pulls away from the pack is in its camera capabilities. If it only had the big 200MP sensor and maybe a single zoom lens, that would be a great camera phone, but the Ultra does more. So. Much. More.\nIn addition to the big sensor, the S25 Ultra offers a 5X optical zoom, as well as a new and improved 50MP sensor for the ultra-wide camera, which should make for great detail on macro shots. Whether you're shooting for the moon or just taking shots of your kids on the field, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is up to the task.\nIn fact, it's up to every task, because it has such an extensive array of lenses. The 5X zoom uses a 50MP sensor, but there is also a 3X zoom lens that uses its own 10MP sensor. Then there's that 50MP sensor for ultra wide shots and super steady videos.\nSamsung isn't letting Google have all the fun with AI editing features, but Samsung also builds AI directly into the camera app. The camera will try to recognize the scene and optimize accordingly. It isn't just the moon that looks better, you'll notice that food shots, monuments, portraits, and tons of other scenes look great when you shoot them with the Galaxy S25 Ultra.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review\nValue | Samsung held fast on the Galaxy S25 Ultra price. it's not a cheap phone, but design updates, integrated AI and inclusion of the S Pen make it good value. | 4.5/5 |\nDesign | The Galaxy S25 Ultra is now fully part of the Galaxy S-series design family and that generally improves it. We have a bigger screen, thinner and lighter body, and we still have all the things that make an Ultra special, including the titanium, the S-Pen and a big-enough battery. | 4/5 |\nDisplay | The biggest Ultra screen ever. It doesn't break any new ground on technology, but is still an excellent screen for all kinds of content and uses. | 5/5 |\nCameras | There are a lot of lenses here and they're backed by high-pixel counts that will result in extremely detailed photos. Samsung only updated one lens since the last Ultra, but choosing the ultra-wide was the right move, as it improves both ultra-wide and macro images. | 4.5 |\nSoftware and AI | Samsung's and its partners' commitment to deep AI integration is laudable, and it makes for the most frictionless AI experience I've found on any smartphone. It's also backed by a solid and even more useful One UI update. And the AI experience will likely get richer over time | 4.5/5 |\nPerformance | The S25 Ultra's Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 8 Elite for Galaxy is one impressive chip. It's a near-perfect mix of performance and efficiency. | 5/5 |\nBattery | Best battery life I've seen on a smartphone. Days of use is within reach. | 5/5 |\nThe best premium Android\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Galaxy S25 Plus is the upstart middle child of the Galaxy S family. It's a big step up from the Galaxy S25 in all the right ways. Plus, it has all the top performance of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, without all the features you don't need. It's the top Samsung phone for battery life, and one of the longest-lasting phones I've every tested.\nDo you really need a pen with your phone? The Galaxy S25 Ultra is undoubtedly feature-packed, but most people don't need that much. The Ultra is a bigger, heavier, and more expensive phone than the Galaxy S25 Plus, without much added benefit.\nThe Galaxy S25 Plus has the same sharp display resolution as the S25 Ultra, and the screen is only a hair smaller. It has the same processor and RAM, and it starts with 256GB, twice the storage of the Galaxy S25.\nThe camera specs come close to matching the iPhone 16 Pro, but fall a bit short of the Ultra. That's fine, because it's Samsung's shooting modes and Galaxy AI software that make its camera great, not the specs. The Galaxy S25 Plus is a winner any way you look at it, and if you really need more, the Ultra is next on the list.\nLooking to save money on a Samsung product? Check out our Samsung coupon codes for the latest deals on top-rated tech and gadgets.\nValue | Worth the premium over the Galaxy S25, with a display and battery life that beat the more expensive Ultra. Still expensive, but worth the high price. | 4/5 |\nDesign | A solid, refined look that hasn\u2019t changed much over the years, and strongly resembles its biggest rival. I\u2019m ready for something new, but this design is a classic, with good color options this year. | 3/5 |\nDisplay | A fantastic display that\u2019s bright and colorful, making it easy to use in any situation, even taking photos in bright sunshine. I only wish the fingerprint scanner were more responsive, but it\u2019s still a great screen with minimal bezels. | 5/5 |\nSoftware | Samsung has improved One UI with a refreshed look and brighter colors. The bloatware problem is growing, though, and many of the Galaxy AI features mentioned at launch don\u2019t show up on the phone. | 3/5 |\nCameras | Takes good photos, but you can find much better cameras on competing phones, with bigger sensors and more pixels. It\u2019s time for an Ultra-fied camera upgrade for the rest of the Galaxy S25 lineup. | 4/5 |\nPerformance | You won\u2019t find a faster phone than the Galaxy S25 Plus, but what will you do with all that power? This Snapdragon wins benchmark tests, but in real-world performance it\u2019s less apparent. Still, it\u2019s the fastest phone around, even if you can\u2019t see it. | 5/5 |\nBattery | Excellent battery life, topping even the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but the OnePlus 13 is far more impressive, with longer battery life and much faster charging. It\u2019s time for Samsung to catch up if it wants to remain at the top. | 4/5 |\nThe best Android for everybody\n5. Google Pixel 9\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Google Pixel 9 is a delightful phone and the easiest Android phone for me to recommend to everybody, especially folks who say 'I just want a phone that works.' The Pixel 9 arrives in Google's striking new Pixel look, with even better color options than the Pro model (hey, Peony!). It takes photos that could be mistaken for Pro, and it has the same Google Tensor G4 processor inside.\nThe biggest difference between the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro isn't the zoom camera on the Pro. The Pixel 9 takes great photos that are even better for sharing, since the phone keeps things to a scant 12MP. Videos also look great. The color quality on the photos I took with the Pixel 9 was excellent, and nearly identical to my Pixel 9 Pro shots.\nThe big difference is the year of premium AI that you'll get with the Pixel 9 Pro. That originally meant no Gemini Live for the Pixel 9 (unless you pay up), but Google has made its conversational AI available on every Pixel 9 device for free, so that's not a problem any more.\nGoogle also updated this phone with Android 15, making it one of the first Android phones to get the new system, as it should be. This phone has seven years of updates ahead, presumably taking us to Android 21, so it could get even better with time.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | Not a bad price considering all the Pixel 9 Pro features you get, but with its free year of advanced AI, maybe you should just get the Pro instead. Hopefully discounts will come soon. | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | The biggest Pixel redesign in years gives us cool new colors, a sleek and modern camera bar, and the most durable Pixel yet. It\u2019s twice as durable as the Pixel 8, but still looks fancy. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | An excellent display is a standout feature on every Pixel, this one is super bright and colorful. The Pro is more versatile, but you can\u2019t tell \u2026 can you? | 4 / 5 |\nSoftware | New AI features take some getting used to, and some need to prove their worth, like the fascinating Screenshots app. But if you want the most advanced AI, get a Pixel 9 Pro with its year of free Gemini Advanced and Gemini Live. | 4 / 5 |\nCamera | Great camera performance looks almost exactly like the Pixel 9 Pro, without the high-resolution files and stuffy Pro controls. You won\u2019t get telephoto zoom, but you will get some of the best pics any smartphone can take, plus the new AI Add Me feature. | 4 / 5 |\nPerformance | The Tensor G4 chipset has fallen far behind rivals and performance is lagging. It\u2019s enough that you\u2019ll notice the drag if you try to run a lot of apps at once and then ask the AI a question. Or do anything with the AI. The AI is slow, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. | 3 / 5 |\nBattery | Great battery life, especially on a smaller phone. I wish it charged faster (or as fast as Google made it seem), but the Pixel 9 battery beats the iPhone 15 by hours and had no trouble lasting all day in the real world. | 4 / 5 |\nThe best budget Android\n6. Pixel 9a\nOur expert review:\nSpecifications\nThe Pixel 9a is the clear value leader among Android phones. It's an easy recommendation if you want a dependable, uncomplicated Android phone that handles the basics very well. If you need an affordable device that will last for years and, the Pixel 9a is a strong contender.\nI wasn't the biggest fan of the new Pixel 9a design, but there's no denying this is a new Pixel phone, through and through. Helpful features such as AI call screening and superior voice recording transcription proved extremely convenient during my in-depth review time with the Pixel 9a.\nGoogle commits to providing seven full years of significant Android OS and security updates. This offers exceptional software support and ensures longevity rarely seen at this price level. Apple and Samsung won't match that commitment with phones this cheap.\nThe Pixel 9a camera performs particularly well. Colors are accurate. Its most impressive aspect is the highly capable new macro photography feature. The resulting close-up detail truly rivals more expensive phone cameras, and maybe even DSLR cameras.\nUltimately, if you want excellent value, a great camera (with standout macro), useful AI, and lengthy software support, and you can accept owning what might be the least visually appealing Pixel design to date, the Pixel 9a stands out as the best budget choice for Android phones.\nRead our full Google Pixel 9a review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | A great phone at this price, with incredible longevity thanks to seven years of updates. The cameras are among the best in this price range, even if the look isn\u2019t so premium. | 5 / 5 |\nDesign | It\u2019s durable, and the colors are real nice. Otherwise, it\u2019s ugly as sin. Seriously, Google had a winning A-series formula that it ruined when it created this phone. But the design doesn\u2019t get in the way, at least. | 3 / 5 |\nDisplay | Excellent display that's bright and colorful, better than most phones at this price. Some trouble with Adaptive mode was easily fixed. If only the phone\u2019s performance could keep up with the fast screen. | 4 / 5 |\nSoftware | A polished version of Android that's easier to use, with plenty of features. Some useful AI tools, but also some AI imagery slop that resorts to bigotry and should be removed from this phone. | 2 / 5 |\nCamera | Solid cameras take photos that look like they could have come from the Pro model, if you don\u2019t look too close. Astonishing macro capabilities rival my DSLR camera and make this phone a winner. Too bad about the low resolution and lack of detail, and some zoom would have been nice. | 3 / 5 |\nPerformance | Performance is adequate for Pixel fans, though it won\u2019t win any races. No problems with my favorite apps and games, but things slowed down when I engaged the AI as it sent requests to and from the cloud. | 3 / 5 |\nBattery | A larger battery somehow doesn\u2019t equal more battery life, but the Pixel 9a still lasts a full day with no trouble, and has wireless charging, a rarity at this price. | 3 / 5 |\nThe best Android folding phone\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 is one of the best folding phones, which means it's also the best Android folding phone. In fact, every folding phone you can buy is also an Android phone, and all of them make use of Google's mobile operating system in unique ways. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 comes loaded with One UI 8, based on Android 16, which means its a great choice for those who want access to the latest and greatest software features.\nOf course, the headline feature isn't the operating system, it's that 8-inch folding display. Samsung has made the folding display on the Galaxy Z Fold 7 larger than ever, and with nearly as much screen real estate as an iPad mini there's plenty of room for browsing, productivity, gaming, and whatever else you need to get done. Samsung has jammed the Galaxy Z Fold 7 full of AI tools and software settings, making this a phone that can adapt to the way you do things.\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 7 has the powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chipset and either 12GB and 16GB of RAM depending on configuration, giving the phone plenty of power. Our testing found the phone to be an adaptable daily companion with enough battery life to get through a full day's use, which with a battery capacity of just 4,400mAh is pretty impressive.\nAnd when it comes to camera quality, no other folding phone comes close. The Galaxy Z Fold 7 sports a 200MP main camera, 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom, and a 12MP ultra-wide. It's the best camera system on any folding phone, and in some situations can hold its own against the dedicated camera phones on this list.\nThe only real downside to the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is its price. At a starting price of $1,999 / \u00a31,899 / AU$2,899, it's the most expensive phone on the market, period. Whether it's worth such a high price is up to you.\nRead our full Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 review\nAttributes | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nValue | The most expensive foldable out there, but it might also be worth it | 4 / 5 |\nDesign | Excellent, slim and light design that still feels elegant and solid. | 5 / 5 |\nDisplay | Two fantastic and now larger screens. The crease is almost gone, but so is support for an S Pen. | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | Better than the best Qualcomm chip on other Androids, and the performance knocked our socks off. | 5 / 5 |\nSoftware | Android 16! One UI 8! So much AI. It may sound like a lot, but it's a winning combination. | 4.5 / 5 |\nCameras | The 200MP sensor is a major upgrade, and overall photography is excellent. We would have liked a 5x optical zoom. | 4.5 / 5 |\nBattery | Really good battery life | 4.5 / 5 |\nFAQs\nWhat is the best Android phone?\nOur pick for the best Android phone for most people is the Pixel 9, because it's an affordable way to get all of Google's best new AI features and Google's refined Pixel interface and software. However, this could soon change as the Pixel 10 is now available, and we're currently testing it for review.\nThe best premium Android phone is the OnePlus 13, because it offers the best battery life, the most refined interface, and the most durable design with IP69 certification.\nWhich Android phone is the best value for money?\nThe best Android phone for people on a budget is the Pixel 9a, which costs $499 / \u00a3499 / AU$849. The Pixel A-series phones are a popular discount item when Amazon puts smartphones on sale, so keep an eye on TechRadar for the latest deals.\nIf you want to spend less than that, Samsung's Galaxy A devices are great value. They gives you a great display and Samsung's feature-packed Android software, plus fast networking and good performance for the price.\nIs Android or iOS better?\nAndroid and Apple's iOS each have their fans, and there is very little that iOS can do that Android cannot. There are many more options, features, and oddities available on Android devices than iOS has ever seen, so Android has a reputation for being more complicated and experimental, while also allowing for more customization and more powerful overall features.\nHow we test\nI've only included phones on this list that have been thoroughly tested in Future Labs and in the real world by our expert review editors. I test every feature on a phone, then we dive deeper to discover all of the hidden goodies.\nI test phones rigorously for battery life and charging times, processor speed and performance, and especially for camera and video recording capabilities. I make sure that phones deliver on the promises and claims they make. If Samsung says a phone charges in 30 minutes, I time it to make sure.\nI've seen every phone you can buy, so I know how each model stacks up against one another. I use both iPhone and Android phones all the time, so I know what I'm saying about the phones you buy, no matter what you pay. I make sure the phones deliver what I'd expect for the price.\nOnce I'm done, I never stop. I update our reviews as the phones are updated. Our reviews are always fresh, so check again before you buy to make sure you're getting the latest review on the best phones you'll find.\n- You've reached the end of the page.

      "text": "A huge iPhone 17 leak just gave you 5 potential reasons to skip the iPhone 16\nAs we ready ourselves for the launch of the iPhone 16 in September, the first iPhone 17 rumors are starting to emerge \u2013 and the latest leak may be enough to persuade you to wait until 2025 for your next iPhone upgrade.\nThe leak comes from the usually reliable Ice Universe on Chinese social media site Weibo (via MacRumors), and covers the four handsets we're expecting next year.\nOne of the rumors we've heard is that the Plus model is set to be replaced by a new Slim flagship, and that's the first reason you might want to skip the iPhone 16 \u2013 the arrival of a new, supercharged top-end iPhone 17 model that will apparently have a 6.65-inch screen and a starting price of $1,299 (about \u00a31,000 / AU$1,950).\nHowever, there's some confusion around the Slim model in this new leak: it's said to be the most expensive of the four, but has the same specs as the standard iPhone 17. It's possible that some of those specs have been mistakenly copied from the iPhone 16 Plus.\nAlways on\nA second reason to hang on for the iPhone 17: all four models are apparently getting Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide (LTPO) displays, which means ProMotion (variable refresh rate) support, and quite possibly always-on display modes too (both currently exclusive to the Pro and Pro Max handsets).\nReasons three, four and five to wait are specific to the Pro and Pro Max (and maybe the Slim) models: 12GB of RAM, three 48MP rear cameras, and an A19 Pro chip based on a new 3-nanometer manufacturing process. That would all likely mean a significant step up in terms of performance and photo and video capture.\nObviously we're still not sure what the iPhone 16 series is going to bring with it, let alone the iPhone 17 range; but based on the rumors we've seen so far, this year's upgrades are set to be more minor than what's rumored to be in the pipeline for 2025.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThere's little doubt that the iPhone 16 handsets will be the best iPhones that Apple has ever put out \u2013 but if you find them somewhat underwhelming when they're unveiled in a couple of months time, you can always start saving up for 2025.\nYou might also like\nDave is a freelance tech journalist who has been writing about gadgets, apps and the web for more than two decades.

      "text": "Tempted by an iPhone 16 upgrade? You might want to check out these rumored iPhone 17 specs first\nThe iPhone 16 series is likely almost here, with all signs pointing to a September launch. But whether you\u2019ll want to buy one of these phones is another matter entirely, especially given that much bigger upgrades could be coming to the iPhone 17 series next year.\nIn a note to investors seen by 9to5Mac, analyst Jeff Pu has argued that the iPhone 17 line could prove far more popular than the iPhone 16 series, thanks to numerous upgrades.\nPu claims the iPhone 17 line will include a refreshed design, a new 24MP front-facing camera for every iPhone 17 model \u2013 up from 12MP on the current phones \u2013 and a new 48MP telephoto camera on the iPhone 17 Pro models, in place of the current 12MP one.\nPu also says the iPhone 17 Pro Max will have a narrower Dynamic Island, and that the Pro models will have 12GB of RAM, up from 8GB currently, which should help to power their AI capabilities.\nOn top of which, Pu echoes reports that we\u2019ll see a new model in the form of an iPhone 17 Slim or an iPhone 17 Air, which could slot in between the standard and Pro models, and have a much slimmer design than the other iPhone 17 models.\nAll this, coupled with the fact that, according to Pu, those Apple loyalists who are still using the iPhone 12 will likely be looking to upgrade their phones next year, could lead to a massive sales boost for Apple.\nA limited upgrade\nAs for the iPhone 16 series, Pu echoes Mark Gurman in suggesting that these phones probably won\u2019t excite many people, saying that the iPhone 16 line will have \u201climited spec upgrades.\u201d\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAs a reminder, the key rumored upgrades include larger screens for the Pro models, a new camera control button \u2013 likely called the Capture button \u2013 for the Pro models, the Action button making its way to the standard iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, a new 48MP ultra-wide camera for the Pro models, a 5x zoom for the iPhone 16 Pro, and a new A18 chipset.\nThese upgrades aren\u2019t insignificant, clearly, but nor are they likely to be game-changing, and while Pu believes that Apple Intelligence could also tempt some buyers, it apparently won\u2019t be enough to drive strong sales growth. Perhaps Apple should consider features like Realme's new 320W SuperSonic Charge tech.\nSo this might not be a big year for Apple, and if you\u2019re not desperate for a new phone just yet then it could be worth holding out for the possibly more exciting iPhone 17 line next year.\nThat said, the iPhone 17 series is still over a year away, so there\u2019s a long time to wait, and with those phones still a long way off we\u2019d take any leaks about them with a serious helping of salt.\nYou might also like\n- iPhone 16: release date speculation, latest leaks, price predictions and more\n- iPhone 16 Pro Max: latest news, rumors and everything we know so far\n- iPhone 16 rumored features: the key upgrades we're expecting\nJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

      "text": "iPhone 17 Pro tipped to get 8K video recording \u2013 but I want these 3 video features instead\n8K is a nice headline spec, but these would be more useful\n- The iPhone 17 Pro is again rumored to be getting 8K video recording\n- A number of Android phones already offer the feature\n- It's likely to have niche appeal compared to other video upgrades\nWith the iPhone 17 Pro launch now likely about six months away, the rumor mill is in overdrive. But while recent speculation has focused on an unsubtle redesign for the flagship phone, the more interesting rumors are predicting camera upgrades \u2013 including 8K video recording.\nAs spotted by BGR, the Chinese leaker Fixed Focus Digital \u2013 who has a reasonably strong track record of Apple leaks on Weibo \u2013 has predicted that the next Pro iPhones will get the ability to shoot 8K video.\nThat isn't exactly an outlandish or unrealistic prediction. A number of Android phones, from the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra to the Xiaomi 15 Ultra, can already shoot in 8K/30fps. The ability to shoot in 8K also landed on Samsung Galaxy S20 way back in 2020.\nThe rumor also aligns with the latest iPhone 17 Pro camera rumors, which predict a new 48MP sensor for its telephoto camera. That would mean all three of its cameras would have the resolution needed to shoot 8K (which typically means 7680 x 4320 frames).\nBut even if the iPhone 17 Pro did get an 8K video upgrade, it would likely be a very niche feature. While that resolution may occasionally prove useful if you need to crop in on a scene during editing, other factors like bit-rate and lens quality (always a limitation on smartphones) will throttle the overall image quality \u2013 and likely make shooting in 4K modes the more sensible option.\nStill, while iPhone are already impressive video cameras, there are a few new features that I think would be more useful than 8K on the iPhone 17 Pro.\niPhone 17 Pro: 3 video features I want to see\n1. Open gate video recording\nWhile iPhones have historically had sensors with 4:3 aspect ratios, they've typically used a 16:9 crop for video recording. So-called 'open gate' video recording means being able to use the full width and height of the sensor, so you're not throwing away any detail \u2013and it'd be great to see this as an option on the iPhone 17 Pro.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nThis would let you choose different aspect ratios \u2013 for example, shooting square video \u2013 while using the whole sensor. It would be more processor-intensive, but I'm sure an A19 Pro could handle it. Even relatively affordable cameras like the Fujifilm X-M5 are now offering open gate recording as an option for social content creators.\nThis is already possible on some iPhones with apps like Pearla, but it'd be nice to see it come to the default camera app or Final Cut Camera without a subscription.\n2. A larger telephoto sensor\nMost iPhone video shooters stick to the main 24mm lens, because it's the only one with that's good enough for anything beyond cat or family videos. That's mostly due to its relatively large 1/1.29-inch sensor, so I hope the 17 Pro gets a much bigger telephoto sensor than its current (and aging) 1/3-inch offering.\nRight now, the latest rumors are predicting that the 17 Pro's telephoto camera will get a boosted 48MP resolution, but the sensor size is less clear. It wouldn't need to match the main camera, but the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's 50MP telephoto has a 1/2.52-inch sensor \u2013 so something in that ballpark would make a big difference for both video and stills. It could even make the telephoto a handy kind of b-cam for cut scenes.\n3. A nano-texture screen option\nOkay, this one's not strictly a video feature, but it would be a nice option for video shooters. Apple now gives you a nano-texture screen option on everything from the iPad Pro M4 to the MacBook Pro M4 to help reduce glare and reflections \u2013 so why not offer a similar option for its Pro iPhones?\nGiven the iPhone's only viewfinder is its screen, and video is often shot outside in the glare of the sun, it would offer benefits for both recording and playback. Granted, you can already get halfway there with a matte screen protector, but Apple could go far beyond that with a new kind of display tech.\nWe've seen patents and rumors suggesting Apple's been working on display tech with an \u201cambient light rejection element\u201d before, so perhaps it could be ready in time for the iPhone 17 Pro. If Apple wants to tout it as the ultimate phone for video creators, that would be a more useful quality-of-life upgrade than 8K resolution.\nYou might also like\nMark is TechRadar's Senior news editor.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Samsung S25 Ultra deftly manages to meld the consistent Galaxy S series aesthetic with all that made previous Ultras notable, including the S Pen. But this phone is also distinctly different to all previous Ultras, thanks to deep and richly baked-in generative AI capabilities. It's a fantastic mix that will please the most ardent Android, Samsung, and Google Gemini fans.\nPros\n- +\nUnified design that doesn't skimp on Ultra appeal\n- +\nBiggest screen of the lineup\n- +\nPowerful AI\n- +\nExcellent battery life\nCons\n- -\nGenerative AI doesn't always deliver\n- -\nSamsung still shies away from total photo-reality\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Two-minute review\nIs there such a thing as 'ultimate phone design'? That was my first thought as I held the new Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and turned it over in my hand. Surely, it\u2019s lost a bit of identity as it shed the last vestiges of Galaxy Note design and adopted the more familiar and blockier look of its Galaxy S brethren. The Galaxy S25 Ultra looks not only more like all the other S25 phones in the lineup, but more like an iPhone than ever before.\nI don\u2019t consider this mimicry. Instead, as I noted above, there may in fact be an ultimate smartphone design \u2013 and for the Ultra line this shift was inevitable. A moment of sadness, though, for the once-iconic Galaxy Note that owned the 'flagship' designation in both looks and functionality \u2013 it was the only smartphone virtually industry-wide that included an integrated stylus. Somehow, Samsung has managed this slimmer, lighter, and squarer makeover without losing space for the S Pen, which alone is an achievement worth celebrating.\nWhen, however, people are done talking about the new design \u2013 including a slightly larger screen than the S24 Ultra \u2013 they\u2019ll likely become obsessed with the deeply integrated AI experience.\nWith the S25 line, Samsung has effectively blurred the lines between Galaxy AI, Bixby system-level AI actions, and Google\u2019s Gemini\u2019s generative AI capabilities. And Samsung isn\u2019t shy about presenting its partner's capabilities. They\u2019re accessible through a long press of the power button (or a press of the virtual home button), and while the connections between Gemini, Google\u2019s apps, and Samsung\u2019s apps isn\u2019t always seamless and automatic, when it works, it\u2019s smooth and quite useful.\nThere are promises in here of a deeper understanding of you by watching not just what you do on the phone but how Samsung-connected wearables like Galaxy Ring, Samsung Galaxy Watch, and SmartThings accessories gather data and understanding of your physical and smart home-based activities. Ultimately, that information is presented as part of Now Brief home screen widgets that give you, among other things, morning and evening briefs.\nThat tracking might sound scary if Samsung hadn\u2019t worked closely with silicon partner Qualcomm to ensure that the Snapdragon Gen 8 Elite for Galaxy has a silicon core that's devoted to your Personal Data Engine, and if it weren't for Samsung\u2019s liberal use of its Knox security both on the phone and across its ecosystem of devices.\nIn my time reviewing the S25 Ultra I saw some personal insights in my briefs, but not enough for them to be meaningful. I think this is the kind of feature that will bear fruit after weeks of using the phone and essentially training the AI to understand you.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAI can be found sprinkled throughout the system, including in photography, which is a good thing since Samsung has done little to upgrade the physical camera array. Of the five cameras (four on the back and one on the front) only one got an upgrade: the ultrawide, which is now a 50MP camera.\nOn the other hand, Samsung has upgraded its Pro Visual engine and, as a result, photography is generally even better than on the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. And if your photographic skills aren\u2019t up to snuff, you can now ask Gemini to suggest changes based on the quality of your own photos.\nThere are more powerful tools for generating AI images and making AI alterations to existing photographs. Sketch to Image is more powerful than ever, and I found that using the S Pen with Sketch to Image generated incredibly realistic AI additions.\nSamsung\u2019s AI integration also extends to sound. It can recognize music playing in a video or hummed by you, and it\u2019s also adept at cleaning up messy audio in videos you shoot.\nThis is a better-looking, faster, smarter, and longer-lasting Ultra than any that\u2019s come before it, and it still costs the same $1,299.99 / \u00a31,249 in the US and UK, and even slightly less in Australia at AU$2,149. That\u2019s a triumph right there. For existing Samsung Galaxy S Ultra fans, this is the ultimate Android.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review: Price and availability\n- Price holds firm, slight reduction in Australia\n- More screen for the same price\n- Deals could save you a bundle\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra was unveiled at Samsung's Galaxy Unpacked event on January 22 and began shipping on February 7.\nIt's available in a choice of four colors wherever you buy: Titanium Silverblue, Titanium Whitesilver, Titanium Grey, and Titanium Black; and three more that are exclusive to the Samsung store: Titanium Jadegreen, Titanium Pinkgold, and Titanium Jetblack.\nThe phone ships in either 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB storage configurations, and every variant comes with 12GB RAM. Pricing is as follows:\n| Storage | US price | UK price | AU price |\n| 256GB | $1,299 | \u00a31,249 | AU$2,149 |\n| 512GB | $1,419 | \u00a31,349 | AU$2,349 |\n| 1TB | $1,659 | \u00a31,549 | AU$2,749 |\nSo, yes, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is a mightily expensive phone, but since most carriers (and indeed Samsung itself) offer regular promotions throughout the year, it's unlikely that you'll need to pay full price.\nFor the latest Galaxy S25 Ultra deals in your region, check out our dedicated Samsung Galaxy S25 deals page.\n- Value score: 4.5/5\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review: Specs\nHere's a look at the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's key specs:\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra |\n|---|---|\n| Dimensions | 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm |\n| Weight | 218g |\n| OS | One UI 7, based on Android 15 |\n| Display | 6.9-inch AMOLED, 120Hz |\n| Chipset | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy |\n| RAM | 12GB |\n| Storage | 256GB / 512GB / 1TB |\n| Battery | 5,000mAh |\n| Rear cameras | 200MP main, 50MP ultra-wide, 10MP telephoto, 50MP telephoto |\n| Front camera | 12MP |\n| Charging | 45W wired, 15W wireless |\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review: design\n- Looks more like the rest of the Galaxy S-series crew\n- Lighter and thinner\n- Still accommodates the S Pen and 5000mAh battery\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra drops the Galaxy Note-esque look completely, replacing it with a look that reflects the Galaxy S aesthetic found across the S25 line, although it\u2019s not an exact replica of those phones. Yes, it has a flat titanium band wrapping around the body, but the corners are slightly squarer than those of the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25 Plus.\nCompared to the S24 Ultra, this phone is, at 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2mm, slightly taller but also narrower, and thinner. It\u2019s also considerably lighter, at 218 grams compared to the S24 Ultra\u2019s 232 grams. That\u2019s a difference I noticed when I held the phone in my hand \u2013 and, yes, that\u2019s lighter than Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 Pro Max, which weighs in at 227 grams.\nI give Samsung credit here for making a lighter phone that somehow still has room for the 5,000mAh battery and to stow the S Pen.\nDespite the significant chassis alteration, there aren\u2019t a lot of other design changes. The volume rocker and power/sleep/Gemini button are in the same relative positions, while Samsung has shifted the antenna cutout from that side to the top of the opposite edge.\nOn the bottom is the same USB-C charging and data port, a wide slot for the base speaker (the other half of the loud and clear stereo speaker system is in a well-hidden channel at the top of the screen), the S Pen slot, and a SIM slot. That last slot is notable because while Apple\u2019s iPhone line in the US only offers eSIM support, the S25 Ultra offers standard SIM and eSIM, and includes Dual-SIM support.\nWhile the S25 Ultra's body is titanium (and rated IP68 for water and dust protection), the front and back are swaddled in Gorilla Glass Armor 2, which includes the extra protection of ceramic. However, while this material might protect the phone from drops, it\u2019s still not scratch-proof, and even though I\u2019ve taken extreme care with my review unit I\u2019m still noticing some long scratches on the display. They\u2019re not deep, and they're only noticeable when the screen is off; still, I await the day when a smartphone manufacturer can deliver a truly scratch-proof display.\nOverall, I like the new look and feel of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and I don\u2019t mind that it\u2019s lost a bit of its distinctive Note aesthetic. This is a big-screen handset that I enjoy holding and using.\n- Design score: 5/5\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Display\n- Biggest Galaxy Ultra screen yet\n- Responsive, bright and color-rich\n- ProScaler technology\n- No other display technology changes\nIf you\u2019ve just read through the design section and assumed that a lighter, thinner smartphone might feature a smaller screen, you should be pleasantly surprised. Samsung has managed to make the Galaxy S25 Ultra screen 6.9 inches (diagonally); that\u2019s 0.1 inches larger than the S24 Ultra's screen, and it's all thanks to a 15% smaller bezel surrounding the display.\nThis change to the screen size is almost the full extent of changes between the S24 Ultra and the S25 Ultra. It\u2019s still a Quad HD+ display that's capable of running at 3120 x 1440 pixels, which is higher-res than the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s 2868 x 1320 Super Retina XDR display. You won\u2019t see the S25\u2019s Quad HD+ resolution, though, unless you dig into settings and switch from the default FHD+ resolution (2340 x 1080) \u2013 and there\u2019s good reason to leave well enough alone, as the FHD+ resolution looks excellent in most situations, and you\u2019ll get better battery life by sticking with the lower resolution.\nThis is still an adaptive display, auto-switching from 1Hz to 120Hz on an as-needed basis. Again, you can save a bit of battery life by switching to 60Hz, but the butter-smooth motion is, in my opinion, worth the tradeoff.\nThere is one notable update that's not to the display itself, but the display is where you'll see it. ProScaler is an image upscaling technology adopted from Samsung's TV tech. The ability to upscale any lower-resolution content is powered by silicon, and might come in handy if, say, you're playing an old game or watching an old video on the Quad HD+ screen\nIt's a beautiful, perfectly flat screen, and unlike on the iPhone 16 Pro Max there\u2019s no large island cutout for cameras, sensors, and information. Instead, there\u2019s just a small circular cutout for the 12MP front-facing camera, and it's not something you notice while watching movies, playing games, browsing the web, or engaging with Gemini.\nUnderneath the screen is an ultrasonic fingerprint reader. I initially only registered my thumb, but found that the scanner sometimes struggled to read my print. My skin is incredibly dry right now, so that might have contributed to the flakiness; later I registered multiple digits, and found better luck with an index finger. I also used a PIN and my face to unlock the phone.\n- Display score: 5/5\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: S Pen\n- S Pen still included\n- Small but highly effective\n- No more BLE support\nThe integrated S Pen looks, feels, and essentially works the same as the S Pen in the S24 Ultra but with one notable difference: it no longer has Bluetooth Low Energy support. This means that some of the long-distance remote-control features no longer work \u2013 you can\u2019t use the button on the pen to, for instance, advance slides. Samsung told me they removed BLE support because so few people were using the related features, and I can say that I didn\u2019t miss it in my tests.\nIn general, I\u2019m a big fan of the S Pen. It's thin and small, but a worthy drawing implement. I used it in Notes, Sketchbook, and Sketch to Image, and it\u2019s also good for note taking \u2013 I was impressed by how effortlessly Samsung Notes could convert my scrawl to accurate text.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review: cameras\n- Lots of lens choices\n- Overall excellent photography capabilities\n- Samsung still favors over-saturated images\n- High megapixel counts result in exquisitely detailed imagery\nAt a glance, the Galaxy S25 Ultra camera array looks unchanged from the S24 Ultra's, but Samsung has given the array a visual upgrade. All the lenses now appear to almost float above the chassis. It\u2019s a neat effect, but for the most part it's a skin-deep alteration, and Samsung has left almost all the camera specs unchanged.\nHere\u2019s what you\u2019ll find on the S25 Ultra.\n- Main camera: 200MP\n- 5x telephoto: 50MP (also provides the 10x zoom through a sensor crop)\n- 3x optical: 10MP\n- Ultra-wide: 50MP\n- Front-facing camera: 12MP\nThe only new camera of the bunch is the 50MP ultra-wide. More pixels here mean better low-light performance for ultra-wide shots and more detailed macro shots, as evidenced in my tests. This is mostly because the camera defaults to binned shooting, which means it\u2019s combining roughly four pixels for each one in the final image. Similarly, you\u2019ll do most of your 200MP main-camera shooting in a pixel-binned 12MP mode.\nI shot a wide variety of photos with all the cameras, and broadly these are excellent lenses and sensors, able to capture a lot of detail and rich, vibrant colors. As is Samsung\u2019s way, though, many of the images are over-saturated; a blue sky is too blue, and green leaves are deeply green. Portrait shots default to some beautification.\nIf you like absolute truth in your photography, this might bother you. I didn\u2019t mind it, and I appreciated how some of the photos I took with the 200MP main camera had more detail in them than what I get with the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s 50MP main camera.\nI was especially impressed with the 50MP ultra-wide\u2019s nighttime performance. Colors and details in challenging situations looked especially good, and the detail in macro shots more or less matched what I can get with the iPhone 16 Pro Max\u2019s macro mode.\nThe Samsung Galaxy 25 Ultra\u2019s zoom capabilities are strong even without a dedicated 10x optical zoom. It\u2019s been two Ultra generations since the Ultra line featured 10x optical zoom and I\u2019m officially over it. I find the 5x zoom backed by a 50MP sensor sufficient, and the 10x zoom based on a sensor crop more useful. These days I tend to avoid the 30x and 100x Space Zooms because I just don\u2019t know how much AI image guesswork they\u2019ll introduce.\nI was especially impressed with the job the 5x and 10x zoom did when photographing a busy woodpecker in a San Jose, California, park.\nIf I have one criticism of the Samsung Galaxy S 25 Ultra camera system it's that there is some faint color bleeding between objects. It\u2019s not in every image or widespread, but in one case I noticed that the green of a leaf was bleeding into the blue sky around it. I attribute this to the algorithmic Pro Visual engine, and I assume a tiny tweak could fix it.\nMost of Samsung\u2019s efforts to improve photography revolve around software, and some of them can be found in Export RAW, a standalone pro-photography app that now offers virtual aperture settings. You\u2019ll need to download Expert RAW and then enable the Lab features to try it.\nWith it, you can virtually adjust the aperture from f/1.4 to f /16. Lower aperture settings provide more of a bokeh effect, while higher f-stop values push the focus out past your subject so that the background is in focus as well.\nSince smartphone cameras don\u2019t have moveable apertures, this is a digital effect, and the quality of the bokeh might not be as dramatic or good as what you\u2019d get from a pro-level camera with a physical aperture. In my experience, I found the effect somewhat lacking; it just didn\u2019t appear to show the real range of a physical aperture.\n- Cameras score: 4.5/5\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: camera samples\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: software and AI\n- Samsung is full steam ahead with deep AI integration\n- It's blurring the lines between Galaxy AI, Google Gemini, and Bixby\n- Now Brief is a smart idea that starts with limited utility\n- The full power of the onboard AI may take time to reveal itself\nSamsung\u2019s long and enduring partnership with Google and Qualcomm pays off in a rich and virtually unmatched system-level AI experience.\nOne of the hallmarks of this system is that it\u2019s less about which AI is doing what than it is about execution and availability. You might be using Galaxy AI for one task, Google Gemini for a different prompt, and Bixby for a system-level query. The lines between these systems are blurred, as are those between apps built by Google, Samsung, and third-party companies.\nSamsung likes to talk about AI agents, though I wouldn\u2019t yet call this 'Agentic AI,' as most of the AI inside the S25 Ultra is not acting on your behalf without your intervention. But it doesn\u2019t take much to launch relatively complex queries beyond a long-press of the power button (Gemini button) and speaking to the phone.\nInteractions with Gemini and other AI can be as simple as pressing the button and asking a question about the weather, or as complex as \u201cfind me chilli recipes on YouTube and then collect them in a Note.\u201d The prompt results in Gemini perusing YouTube, finding the recipes, and then collecting them in a Samsung Note.\nThis cross-app prompt functionality works with a small collection of non-Google and non-Samsung apps, including Spotify and WhatsApp. I asked Gemini to find science-related podcasts on Spotify and then make a list of them in Notes. Unfortunately, Gemini collected a list of links, and when I asked Gemini to please give me a list of names, it could not comply.\nMy other complaint with these cross-app connections is that nothing works unless you link apps like Spotify to your Google account.\nMultimodal capabilities mean that the AI can react to everything from photos and videos to audio. Samsung, though, has some work to do on making these processes simple and seamless.\nWhen I wanted to get a calorie count from my burger, fries, and soda lunch, I started by holding down the Gemini button and then selecting the plus sign in the prompt field. Then I selected the camera, took a photo of my meal, and selected 'Attach'. Then I pressed the microphone button and asked Gemini about the calorie count. The result was a detailed report on the caloric intake for my lunch (it was over 1,200 calories \ud83e\udd26\u2642\ufe0f). Gemini is a bit of a chatterbox; its answers are often so long that I lose interest and hit stop, although to be fair, the useful information is always within the first two or three sentences.\nSimilarly, I took photos of some of the unfinished ingredients at the burger shop and asked Gemini what I could make with them. It smartly figured that I could use all this to make cheeseburgers. Sure, that was the obvious conclusion for me, a human being, but it is impressive that an AI can figure that out with little additional context.\nI also used the feature to identify various plants, and followed up with questions about how to care for each of them. In each case, Gemini maintained the context of our conversation.\nOne of the more exciting aspects of the S25 Ultra\u2019s AI capabilities is its potential to learn about you and offer helpful daily guidance. This shows up as the new Now Brief widget on the home screen. At a glance, this might appear like a simple, albeit personalized widget with some information about your day. But it\u2019s more than that, and may become more useful the more you use the phone, and the more Samsung devices you own.\nNow Brief is tied to the new Personal Data Engine, a local bit of learning AI that\u2019s housed in a special core on the Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 8 Elite chip. The S25 Ultra uses that processing space to gather and analyze useful, and of course, encrypted, data and insights about you and then present it in Morning, Midday, Evening, and Late Night briefs. These include basic info like calendars, weather, and reminders. But they can also give you insights such as your energy score and, if you wear a Samsung Galaxy Watch or Galaxy Ring to bed, your sleep quality. Eventually, it\u2019ll start offering suggestions on how you can improve these metrics.\nSamsung\u2019s mix of local encrypted data and occasional cloud-based AI (usually for the larger generative models Galaxy AI and Gemini sometimes need) mirrors what Apple is doing with Apple Intelligence; most of its AI is local, but it will sometimes send the data to its encrypted cloud or even, with your permission, pass it off to third parties like ChatGPT.\nSamsung\u2019s unfettered use of Gemini and easy blending of Bixby system features and third-party apps make Samsung\u2019s AI offering feel more complete and comprehensive.\nAnd while Apple is only comfortable letting people create cartoonish images of themselves and new genmojis. Samsung is pushing the boundaries of AI image generation. Since the introduction of Galaxy AI last summer, I\u2019ve been adding uncanny, lifelike AI elements to original photos using Sketch to Image, and the S25 series proves even more adept at fictional creations.\nI used Sketch to Image to add a white mouse to a series of images. Using the S Pen, I sketched a simple line drawing of a mouse, doing my best to accurately position it on each surface. Then I let Samsung Galaxy AI do its work (a network connection is necessary for this function, which means the generation is likely happening in the cloud). The results were jaw-dropping \u2013 the only way you\u2019d be able to know that the white mouse had not coincidentally appeared in each photo is the 'AI generated content' watermark on each image.\nDrawing Assist lets me sketch anything poorly and generate watercolors, cartoons, pop art, 3D cartoons, oil paintings, and sketches based on it. I can also generate images from text and original photos. The sketch features do a nice job of turning photos into line drawings. The system can be a bit unpredictable, though. I entered the prompt \u201cA bird flying over the Empire State Building\u201d and the S25 Ultra\u2019s Image Assist refused to generate an image because the \u201cprompt might contain inappropriate content.\u201d\nMore practically, Samsung's Galaxy AI was effective at helping me clean up images using Generative Edit. It was effective at removing a man who chose to step into frame just as I was trying to run some nightography tests.\nAI has helped Samsung add it own Shazam feature. If I\u2019m watching a video with a song in it, I can identify it by pressing the virtual home button and choosing the note icon. This worked every time when I tried it with YouTube and Instagram Reels, and it was also able to identify any song I tunefully hummed.\nA more useful audio feature, in my opinion, is the new Audio Eraser. This is very similar to Apple\u2019s Audio Mix tool. Both can identify, separate, and remove background noise in videos. Samsung\u2019s version did an excellent job of removing all noise from a video I shot on busy street. Yes, if you remove all background noise the final audio can sound a bit unnatural, but I\u2019m still impressed.\nAs a system, One UI 7 is cleaner and smarter than ever. Even Gallery has been given an AI upgrade, so it\u2019s better at returning useful photo results. I can now select the search icon and then speak my query, with typically accurate results. I asked for photos of plants, and the S25 Ultra instantly returned all my photos that included plants.\nI still prefer using Google Photos, which of course is preloaded on the system and can back up all your Galaxy S25 photos. If you let it do that, you\u2019ll find no better image search engine.\n- Software AI score: 4.5/5\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Performance\n- Fastest Ultra chip ever\n- Personal Data Engine for core-deep AI support\n- Super-efficient\nThroughout my tests, I marveled at the Samsung Galaxy S 25 Ultra\u2019s combination of power and efficiency. There was no task it couldn\u2019t handle, and I found its AI capabilities speedy and effective. Much of this is down to the new Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 8 Elite for Galaxy, which is backed by 12GM of RAM.\nThis isn\u2019t just the fastest chip Qualcomm\u2019s ever produced; it\u2019s a custom version for Samsung. Geekbench 6.3 benchmarks show that the Gen 8 Elite for Galaxy has significantly closed the gap between Galaxy phone performance and iPhones running the latest Apple Silicon (Apple\u2019s A18 Pro). In my anecdotal tests, Apple\u2019s still in the lead, but our Future Labs results put the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra just ahead of the iPhone 16 Pro Max on multi-core tests.\nGraphics scores are comparable to Apple\u2019s, and real-world performance on games, productivity, and general use tasks do not belie those numbers.\nPerhaps more notable is that despite intensive use I\u2019m seeing amazing battery life. Thanks is due in part to the Gen 8 Elite\u2019s 3-nanometer process and the new 40%-larger vapor chamber that manages heat. It\u2019s been paired with a new Thermal Interface material (TIM) which covers the CPU and is then covered by the vapor chamber.\nAs I mentioned above, this 5G phone supports dual SIM, and still gives you the option of using a physical SIM card. It also supports ultra-wideband (UWB), which could be useful for using the phone to locate those new Samsung SmartTags, and Wi-Fi 7, which should help future-proof your connectivity experience.\n- Performance score: 5/5\nSasmung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Battery\n- Days of battery life\n- Cool operation\nSamsung rates the Galaxy S25 Ultra at 31 hours of video playback, and on mixed tasks I got well over 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. With a 65W charger, I fully charged the 5000mAh battery in one hour.\nIn our Future Labs test, the rundown ran 18 hours and 35 minutes when using the phone screen at the standard 60Hz refresh rate, and dropped to 17 hours and 15 minutes when using the more resource-intensive adaptive refresh rate. To put this in perspective, the iPhone 16 Pro Max managed 17 hours and 35 minutes in the same tests.\nThe phone supports 5W Qi-based wireless charging, and will work with Qi2-based chargers, though I don't think it supports the latter's 15W, faster charge times.\n- Battery score: 5/5\n| Value | Samsung held fast on the Galaxy S25 Ultra price. it's not a cheap phone, but design updates, integrated AI and inclusion of the S Pen make it good value. | 4.5/5 |\n| Design | The Galaxy S25 Ultra is now fully part of the Galaxy S-series design family and that generally improves it. We have a bigger screen, thinner and lighter body, and we still have all the things that make an Ultra special, including the titanium, the S-Pen and a big-enough battery. | 4/5 |\n| Display | The biggest Ultra screen ever.

Samsung only updated one lens since the last Ultra, but choosing the ultra-wide was the right move, as it improves both ultra-wide and macro images. | 4.5 |\n| Software and AI | Samsung's and its partners' commitment to deep AI integration is laudable, and it makes for the most frictionless AI experience I've found on any smartphone. It's also backed by a solid and even more useful One UI update. And the AI experience will likely get richer over time | 4.5/5 |\n| Performance | The S25 Ultra's Qualcomm Snapdragon Gen 8 Elite for Galaxy is one impressive chip. It's a near-perfect mix of performance and efficiency. | 5/5 |\n| Battery | Best battery life I've seen on a smartphone. Days of use is within reach. | 5/5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want the biggest-screen Galaxy without the bulk\nSamsung has pulled off a neat trick with the S25 Ultra update, extending the screen without making the phone any larger or heavier. It's also the same price as last year.\nYou own other Samsung products\nSamsung doesn't always get credit for having an ecosystem in the way Apple does, but it's putting real effort into making all of its products, from its smartphones to its smart tags to its refrigerators, work together. This phone is potentially an AI-powered hub for Samsung's AI ecosystem experience.\nYou want industry-leading battery life and top-notch performance\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra shows its prowess in benchmarks and real-world performance, and it does so while surprising us with the best battery life yet.\nDon't buy it if...\nAn integrated S Pen doesn't interest you\nGet the Galaxy S25 Plus, which nearly matches the S25 Ultra in screen size and only lacks the S Pen, the 5x optical zoom and the 50MP ultra-wide camera, and save yourself a decent chunk of cash.\nYou're not interested in AI\nIt's fair to call the Galaxy S25 Ultra an AI phone, and if AI isn't something you want or need, look elsewhere.\nGalaxy S25 Ultra review: Also consider\nApple iPhone 16 Pro Max\nApple's newest Pro Max is bigger and more powerful than ever. It has a beautiful screen, an excellent camera array, and the new Camera Control, which could change how you approach iPhone photography. It's probably the most direct competitor to the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, and a clear pick for Apple fans.\nRead our full Apple iPhone 16 Pro Max review\nSamsung Galaxy Z Fold 6\nThe Galaxy Z Fold 6 is a bold reimagining of Samsung\u2019s flagship foldable smartphone.
