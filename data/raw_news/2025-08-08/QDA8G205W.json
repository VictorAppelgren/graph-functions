Webster, the former FBI and CIA director, has died at the age of 101, his family announced Friday.Webster led the FBI from 1978 to 1987 and the CIA from 1987 to 1991, making him the only person to head the nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency and its main intelligence agency.\"We are proud of the extraordinary man we had in our lives who spent a lifetime fighting to protect his country and its precious rule of law,\" his family said in a statement.Before his time leading agencies in Washington, he served as federal prosecutor and later spent about eight years as a federal judge.FBI OUSTS FORMER ACTING DIRECTOR, AGENT INVOLVED IN J6 PROSECUTIONS, WITH MORE EXCPECTEDFormer President Jimmy Carter tapped Webster, a Republican, for a 10-year term as head of the FBI as the agency attempted to boost a reputation that had been tarnished by revelations of domestic spying, internal corruption and other abuses of power.Webster was later selected by President Ronald Reagan to lead the CIA, replacing director William J. Casey, who had been criticized for being too political, ignoring Congress and contributing to the arms-for-hostages scandal known as Iran-Contra.\"Every director of the CIA or the FBI should be prepared to resign in the event that he is asked to do something that he knows is wrong,\" Webster once said.In 2002, the Securities and Exchange Commission chose Webster to lead a board created by Congress to oversee the accounting profession in response to scandals involving Enron and other corporations.Former FBI Director Christopher Wray, who departed the agency earlier this year, said he was \"deeply saddened\" by Webster's death.\"My heart goes out to his family in this time of loss. His legacy will endure \u2014 not only in the institutions he guided, but in the generations of public servants he inspired to carry the torch forward,\" Wray said in a statement.FBI AGENTS GROUP TELLS CONGRESS TO TAKE URGENT ACTION TO PROTECT AGAINST POLITICIZATIONWebster is survived by his second wife, Lynda Clugston Webster, and three children from his first marriage and their spouses, seven grandchildren and spouses and 12 great-grandchildren.

      "text": "The FBI on Thursday is ousting at least three officials, including the former acting director and an officer involved in the January 6 investigations, Fox News has learned.\nFormer FBI acting director, Brian Driscoll, is among those being forced out of the bureau, sources familiar with the matter told Fox News, along with Walter Giardina, a special agent at the bureau who played a role in the investigation of Trump trade advisor, Peter Navarro, and Steven Jensen, the acting director in charge of the Washington Field Office.\nDriscoll, for his part, served as acting director of the FBI prior to the confirmation of FBI Director Kash Patel, and Jensen played a key role in the January 6 investigations.\nSenior FBI officials told the agents in question that they needed to leave by Friday, with no specific reason given to them individually.\nFBI AGENTS GROUP TELLS CONGRESS TO TAKE URGENT ACTION TO PROTECT AGAINST POLITICIZATION\nOne individual with knowledge of the removals described it as \"retribution.\"\nIndividuals familiar with the matter told Fox News that more ousters are expected at the bureau by the end of the week, though the exact number of personnel included, or their roles at the bureau, are unclear.\nU.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro refused to answer several questions from Fox News about the FBI ousters during a press conference Thursday morning.\nStill, news of their removals comes months after thousands of FBI personnel in February were forced to fill out a sprawling questionnaire asking employees detailed questions about any role they may have played in the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riots \u2014 ranging from whether they had testified in any criminal trials to when they last participated in investigation-related activity.\nThe questionnaire, first reported by Fox News Digital, sparked urgent fears about politicization within the bureau, and concern that it could be used to retaliate against agents involved in the January 6 investigations.\nThose concerns reached a fever pitch later that month, after then-Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove ordered the bureau to compile a list of all current and former personnel who worked on investigations related to January 6, 2021, riots case.\nThat information included details on \"thousands\" of employees, including their unique identifying number, their current title and their role and title at the time of the investigation.\nA group of nine current FBI agents and employees in U.S. District Court later filed a lawsuit over the list, citing fears that it could threaten their careers and risks disrupting the bureau's essential work.\nFormer Justice Department officials have cited concerns that the probe or any retaliatory measures carried out as a result could have a chilling effect on the work of the FBI, including its more than 52 separate field offices.\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation Agents Association (FBIAA), a voluntary professional association that represents more than 14,000 active and retired FBI special agents, told Fox News in a statement on Thursday that they are \"deeply concerned\" about the reported oustings and said they are \"actively reviewing all legal options\" to defend FBI agents who were summarily fired from the bureau without cause or process.\n'CORRUPT' FBI MUST BECOME 'PRISTINE,' TRUMP SAYS, ASSERTING PATEL WILL 'STRAIGHTEN IT OUT'\nThe FBIAA is \"deeply concerned by reports that FBI Special Agents\u2014case agents and senior leaders alike\u2014are going to be summarily fired without due process for doing their jobs investigating potential federal crimes,\" the group said in a statement.\n\"Agents are not given the option to pick and choose their cases, and these agents carried out their assignments with professionalism and integrity. Most importantly, they followed the law,\" the FBIAA said.\nFormer FBI and Department of Justice officials previously warned in interviews with Fox News Digital that such firings, while within Trump's authority, could have a chilling effect on the rest of the bureau should the administration move to get rid of the personnel involved in the Jan. 6 investigations.\nThe Trump administration has not yet said whether it will move to take action against the individuals involved.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nIn February, President Donald Trump declined to answer questions over whether his administration would remove FBI employees involved in the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, telling reporters only that he believes the bureau is \"corrupt\" and that then-FBI director nominee, Kash Patel, would \"straighten it out.\"\nThe FBI did not respond to Fox News' request for comment."

      "text": "FIRST ON FOX\u2014 The Federal Bureau of Investigation Agent\u2019s Association (FBIAA) sent a letter to House and Senate leaders Monday raising \"urgent concerns\" over recent actions taken by acting DOJ and FBI personnel, which they say could threaten the careers of thousands of employees and risks disrupting the bureau's essential work.\nThe FBIAA, a voluntary professional association representing more than 14,000 active and retired FBI special agents, cited in particular the order from acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove to terminate the entire FBI senior leadership team, and the assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office, as well as the order for bureau employees to compile lists of all current and former personnel who worked on investigations related to January 6, 2021, and a Hamas-related case.\nThe FBIAA said the lists \"will be used to determine whether those individuals should face additional personnel actions,\" though the Trump administration has not yet said it will move to take action against individuals involved.\nStill, the group said, the recent actions taken by the Trump administration have given them reason for concern.\n\"Put simply, Special Agents who risk their lives protecting this country from criminals and terrorists are now being placed on lists and having their careers jeopardized for carrying out the orders they were given by their superiors in the FBI,\" the group said, saying the actions both lack \"transparency and due process,\" and \"are creating dangerous distractions, imperiling ongoing investigations, and undermining the Bureau\u2019s ability to work with state, local, and international partners to make America safe again.\"\nPresident Donald Trump declined to answer questions on Monday over whether his administration would remove FBI employees involved in the investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot, telling reporters only that he believes the bureau is \"corrupt\" and that his nominee for FBI director, Kash Patel, will \"straighten it out.\"\nTRUMP'S ULTIMATUM TO FEDERAL WORKERS: RETURN TO OFFICE 'OR BE TERMINATED'\n\"I think the FBI was a very corrupt institution, and I'm a victim of it in the true sense,\" Trump told Fox News, adding that he believes the bureau's reputation has been \"damaged badly, as has the DOJ's.\"\n\"But you know what, we have to have pristine, beautiful, perfect law enforcement,\" Trump said.\nFormer Justice Department officials have cited concerns that the actions could have an incredibly chilling effect on the work of the FBI, including its more than 52 separate field offices, whose agents have decades of experience in detecting and responding to counterterrorism threats, organized and violent crime, drug trafficking, and more.\nOne retired FBI agent urged calm, noting to Fox News that the acting director and deputy director of the FBI still remain in place. This person also stressed that the Jan. 6 investigation and the FBI personnel involved in investigating each case \"fully followed Bureau and DOJ guidelines,\" and that violations of federal statutes were \"proven beyond a reasonable doubt in federal courts of law.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"While convictions may be overturned or pardoned, nothing changes the original nexus of a federal investigation,\" this person said.\nThis is a breaking news story.
