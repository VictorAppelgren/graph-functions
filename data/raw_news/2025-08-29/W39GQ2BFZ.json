  "description": "After all, ambient computing can\u2019t happen with only one gadget.",
  "content": "is a senior reporter focusing on wearables, health tech, and more with 13 years of experience. Before coming to The Verge, she worked for Gizmodo and PC Magazine.\n\nI dream of a gadget that can do it all. Instead, when I leave for the office, I pack one or two phones, a portable battery bank, a laptop, a Kindle, a new product I\u2019m testing, and at least one pair of earbuds. In my backpack, there\u2019s a pouch full of cords and adapters. On my body, I usually sport between two and four wearable devices. I know mine is a \u201cgadget maximalist\u201d life. But, surely, one day, the powers that be will convene and society will decide on the Next Must-Have Gizmo \u2014 one all-powerful, do-everything device that will replace the phone.\n\nAt a studio in Brooklyn Navy Yard, Google showed off four phones, a smartwatch, and a pair of earbuds. That\u2019s fairly typical for a product launch, but something about this year\u2019s updates was different. It wasn\u2019t just the odd keynote format, or the latent anxiety of Gemini getting stuffed into every single corner of every product. It was the uncanny feeling that AI won\u2019t be the thing that tears down walled gardens. It\u2019ll strengthen them. Instead of streamlining the number of gadgets we carry around, it might make them multiply.\n\nYou can see where this is all going. Wearables generate a ton of data. It\u2019s a lot harder than it sounds to find actionable insights in a way that\u2019s digestible and keeps people engaged long-term. It\u2019s the sort of task that AI would theoretically be good at \u2014 which is why you see every fitness tracker and app on the market hopping on the bandwagon.\n\nAt the same time, as Waraich describes it, wearables are the \u201conly one device in our computing lives that is guaranteed on-body presence.\u201d Your phone may seem like it\u2019s glued to your hand, but even it might be left behind on a table, stashed in a purse, or turned off at a show. If you want the most personalized, always-available AI assistant, it has to know absolutely everything there is to know about you. Is there a better way to do that than to be on you?\n\nThe problem with AI hardware is that we\u2019re in the spaghetti stage. No one knows what the winning formula is, and so every idea under the sun is going to get thrown at the wall until something sticks. You have your always-listening life recorders that purport to be your second memory. Meta\u2019s hypothesis is that multimodal smart glasses are the platonic ideal gateway to AI. Jony Ive and Sam Altman can afford to be hyper vague about whatever project they\u2019re working on because anything they say at this point could be correct.\n\n\u201cAny religion you have now is probably premature,\u201d says Rishi Chandra, Google\u2019s VP of Fitbit and Health, when I ask what form factors Google is betting on for Gemini. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind, there\u2019s going to be new form factors that will exist. But I think it\u2019s too early to have conviction. What\u2019s interesting is the AI is moving so fast that any point of view you have on the hardware could change very quickly.\u201d\n\nInstead, Chandra says Google\u2019s leaning into the spaghetti-ness of it all. Some of that is an openness to experimentation. You only need to look at Android XR, its nascent platform for smart glasses, to see that. The other half is to \u201cmaximize the devices you already have.\u201d The phone is a starting point. The smartwatch and earbuds are natural extensions, but the full potential of AI hardware has yet to be unlocked. The hope, Waraich says, is that by experimenting and maximizing, you end up with a winning combination that hasn\u2019t been seen just yet.\n\nWaraich agrees. Google, he says, views these overall shifts aligning nicely with its vision for ambient computing, a world where your devices fade into the background, autonomously and proactively answering your every need. (When you walk into a room, for example, your AI lightbulbs might switch to a mellower setting because they can speak to your phone, on which you just texted a friend to say you have a migraine.) But ambient computing will never be unlocked if there\u2019s only one all-powerful gadget. It also won\u2019t work if these gadgets don\u2019t \u201cspeak\u201d a common language. So why wouldn\u2019t Google pitch Gemini as the glue holding it all together? If Gemini becomes the must-have AI, and it\u2019s primarily baked into Google hardware \u2014 perhaps that\u2019s how you really get people to stop caring about green bubbles.\n\nSome of this shift is because the smartphone is almost 20 years old. A gadget that once inspired awe, these days phones feel more like a Toyota Camry than a Ferrari. Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg said last year that the \u201cexciting times are over\u201d and that many people are keeping their phones for three years or more. These numbers fluctuate depending on region and demographic, but Big Tech has publicly admitted that people just aren\u2019t upgrading their phones as often as they used to.\n\nViewed from that lens, the push toward AI hardware begins to make sense. It just feels out of sync with what people tell me they want. Google\u2019s executives tell me the point of Gemini (and AI in general) is to make people\u2019s lives easier, to return their time to them. It\u2019s a noble quest that seemingly aligns with the exhaustion people feel from the always-on modern life. But even if I can see Google\u2019s vision, even if I genuinely see the value in parts of it \u2014 it\u2019s hard to square how adding more gadgets with more AI addresses that existential fatigue.\n\nNevertheless, this is the bet that Google\u2019s going all in on. It\u2019s why the Pixel 10 and Pixel Watch 4 feel like such opinionated devices in a landscape of iterative updates. I\u2019d argue that\u2019s also why we\u2019re seeing smart rings gain traction, and why Meta\u2019s seeing hardware success with its smart glasses after years of failing to convince people to care about the metaverse. Everyone\u2019s looking for the next turn in the story, and for now, it\u2019s converging on AI wearables. Many, many of them.",

      "text": "A new report shows a steady drop in consumer interest in wearables. But will the smartwatch save the market? A report released today shows that consumer demand for wearables in the U.S. has declined steeply and steadily since the 2014 holiday shopping season, and is now lower than it was at the beginning of last year. Argus Insights based its report based on more than 327,000 consumer reviews to determine interest in the market over time. The research found that the wearables market was briefly captivated by the Apple Watch in September 2014, but instead gravitated toward the less-expensive Fitbit fitness band for the 2015 holiday season. Since then, however, consumers have generally lost interest in wearable devices, as this chart shows. Argus Insights The report acknowledged a similar dip in interest in wearables in early 2014, following a spike during the preceding holiday season, but pointed out that demand eventually rebounded, ultimately peaking by the end of the year. This year, the market for wearable devices has largely failed to recapture consumer interest. However, the wearables market may not be entirely doomed yet. The 2015 holiday shopping season is just a few months away, and Argus Insights suggests that those who are still using in wearables have shown signs of potential growth in smartwatches. While fitness bands, particularly the Fitbit, lead the market in what Argus calls \u201cbuzz volume,\u201d smartwatches from Apple, LG. and Motorola actually received much higher marks in \u201cconsumer delight.\u201d Argus Insights This trend correlates with what consumers are looking for in wearable devices now that the market is beginning to mature. Reflecting the overall trend in wearables, smartwatch users have given the most attention to fitness and fitness-related attributes of the device, according to Argus. However, smartwatch users are also showing an increasing amount of positive attention to smartwatch apps for gaming and news/weather/sports (it should be noted that Instant Messaging/SMS smartwatch apps received more negative attention than positive, which is perhaps not surprising given the device\u2019s tiny screen). Smartwatches are capable of providing both fitness functionality and news and gaming apps, so therefore they might start to steal away market share, Argus Insights CEO and founder John Feland says. Argus Insights However, the report also cites previous Argus research that found that \u201cthe majority of users lose interest in their fitness bands after just six months.\u201d While this could signal a move toward more capable smartwatches, it might also be a cause of the widespread drop in interest in wearables. If even the early adopters have become so dissatisfied, why would other consumers care about the technology?

      "text": "For the past twenty years or so, I\u2019ve had a clear image of what a product launch keynote is supposed to be like. A charismatic executive walks across the stage, points to some animations and pre-taped clips, a live demo or two happens, and the crowd goes wild. Clips proliferate on social media and cue the online discourse. You can trace it back to Steve Jobs dressed in a black turtleneck, with a glint in his eye, walking across a stage, asking if a hyped-up audience is ready for one more thing. So iconic was that format, it\u2019s been the blueprint for nearly every tech keynote since.\nThe Made by Google event felt like being sucked into an episode of Wandavision\nJimmy Fallon, a parade of influencers, and a live studio audience \u2014 this was not your typical product launch event.\nThe Made by Google event felt like being sucked into an episode of Wandavision\nJimmy Fallon, a parade of influencers, and a live studio audience \u2014 this was not your typical product launch event.\nToday\u2019s Made by Google event was decidedly not that.\nIt was a lot more like a live taping of The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. Partly because Fallon was the one hosting it, but also because 10 minutes before the show, I was sitting in the studio audience, watching a warm-up comic try and pump up the crowd as an applause sign blazed in the rafters. A small crew of cameramen weaved in and out of four separate sets, one wheeling a teleprompter (because yes, much of the repartee was scripted).\nRick Osterloh, Google\u2019s senior vice president of devices and services, did not stride across the stage to tell us all about the new Pixel 10 phones, Pixel Watch 4, and Pixel Buds 2A. He instead sat on a comfy chair while Fallon \u201cinterviewed\u201d him as if he were a Tonight Show guest. Pre-recorded clips were rolled. Once Osterloh\u2019s segment was done, Fallon and another Googler moved onto a different set, proceeding to walk through each new gadget like we were all watching the QVC home shopping network. Surprise guests and a parade of influencers were brought out to showcase new Gemini features, including Alex Cooper and the Subway Takes guy. A wild Jonas brother appeared because he had a \u201cShot on Pixel 10 Pro\u201d music video to premiere.\nPerhaps it was the cognitive dissonance of figures I\u2019ve only ever seen through a screen yap about AI features I\u2019m not 100 percent convinced they fully understood. (I don\u2019t buy that Fallon is that excited about Tensor chips or even knows what dust and waterproofing \u201cIP numbers!\u201d are.) But I found myself feeling like I\u2019d been sucked into an episode of Wandavision, a Marvel show where the Scarlet Witch is trapped in a make-believe world of studio sets and TV tropes. A show where the unnatural cringe and heightened emotions are what cue the protagonist into realizing what she\u2019s seeing is made of smoke and mirrors.\nSome of that is just movie magic, baby. Everything on stage feels unnaturally cringe until its intensity is diluted by being filtered through your screen. But the real unsettling thing was understanding that I \u2014 and other gadget nerds and media \u2014 were not the target audience for this show. The point of a keynote is to be both informative and impressive, telling the most interested audiences about the ins and outs of the new products and attempting to wow them with live demos and technological feats. Today\u2019s Pixel event was less concerned with product minutiae and more concerned with making it all entertaining.\nI\u2019m not entirely sure who the target was, though. Was it supposed to be the so-called mainstream Luddite who feels comforted by Fallon learning what RCS means? Perhaps. Or was it disaffected Gen Z youths, drawn in by the Subway Takes guy shilling for wireless buds even as he used a wired mic for his recorded segment? Or was it the faceless masses who are perhaps fed up with their iPhones? In teaching Fallon about RCS, the onstage Googler declared that Google is \u201cdone with that conversation\u201d about green bubbles and wink-wink, the Pixel team isn\u2019t afraid to say the \u201cA-word.\u201d I\u2019m not sure even Google knows who it\u2019s targeting, aside from \u201csomeone new.\u201d\nWhile trapped in my seat \u2014 we were told that once taping began, we could not leave, even if we had to pee \u2014 it occurred to me that perhaps this has been a long time coming. It\u2019s as my colleague Mia Sato brought up in her recent Vergecast episode: with TV on the decline, celebrities have to resort to an array of different online outlets to promote their work. Perhaps Google is doing the same. Back in the day, Jobs needed media to get the word out and build buzz. In this new age, companies can go straight to the source through influencers, YouTube (which Google also owns), and livestreams. It\u2019s why you see an increasing number of influencers invited to launch events \u2014 and featuring in them. There were plenty in attendance today. It\u2019s not that journalists are getting left out. It\u2019s more that the keynote as we know it isn\u2019t the only way to get attention anymore.\nAll I know is today felt like the end of an era. That\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing. I\u2019ll confess that traditional keynotes have felt stale as of late. As cringe as it was, this was at least something different."

      "text": "The story of this year\u2019s Google I/O actually started three years ago.\nPixel by Pixel: how Google is trying to focus and ship the future\nMaking ambient computing happen is forcing Google to change how it does everything\nAt its Made By Google event in 2019, onstage in New York City, Rick Osterloh, Google\u2019s SVP of devices and services, laid out a new vision for the future of computing. \u201cIn the mobile era, smartphones changed the world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s super useful to have a powerful computer wherever you are.\u201d But he described an even more ambitious world beyond that, where your computer wasn\u2019t a thing in your pocket at all. It was all around you. It was everything. \u201cYour devices work together with services and AI, so help is anywhere you want it, and it\u2019s fluid. The technology just fades into the background when you don\u2019t need it. So the devices aren\u2019t the center of the system \u2014 you are.\u201d He called the idea \u201cambient computing,\u201d nodding to a concept that has floated around Amazon, Apple, and other companies over the last few years.\nOne easy way to interpret ambient computing is around voice assistants and robots. Put Google Assistant in everything, yell at your appliances, done and done. But that\u2019s only the very beginning of the idea. The ambient computer Google imagines is more like a guardian angel or a super-sentient Star Wars robot. It\u2019s an engine that understands you completely and follows you around, churning through and solving for all the stuff in your life. The small (when\u2019s my next appointment?) and the big (help me plan my wedding) and the mundane (turn the lights off) and the life-changing (am I having a heart attack?). The wheres and whens and hows don\u2019t matter, only the whats and whys. The ambient computer isn\u2019t a gadget \u2014 it\u2019s almost a being; it\u2019s the greater-than-the-sum-of-its-parts whole that comes out of a million perfectly-connected things.\nWhich is a problem for Google. The company is famously decentralized and non-hierarchical, and it can sometimes seem like every single engineer on staff is given the green light to ship whatever they made that week. And so, since that day in 2019, Google has mostly continued to do what Google always does, which is build an unbelievable amount of stuff, often without any discernible strategy or plan behind it. It\u2019s not that Google didn\u2019t have a bigger vision; it\u2019s just that no one seemed to be interested in doing the connective work required for the all-encompassing, perfectly-connected future Osterloh had imagined. Google was becoming a warehouse full of cool stuff rather than an ecosystem.\nBut over the last couple of years, Google has begun to change in order to meet this challenge. Osterloh\u2019s devices team, for instance, has completely reset its relationship with the Android team. For a long time, the company proudly maintained a wall between Pixel and Android, treating its internal hardware team like any other manufacturer. Now, Google treats Pixel like the tip of the spear: it\u2019s meant to be both a flagship device and a development platform through which Google can build features it then shares with the rest of the ecosystem.\n\u201cWe really sort of co-design where things are headed,\u201d Osterloh said. \u201cI think that\u2019s just sort of the nature of how computers have changed, and computing models have changed.\u201d Both teams share visions of an ambient future, he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re working on it together.\u201d\nGoogle treats Pixel like the tip of the spear: it\u2019s meant to be both a flagship device and a development platform\nAround the company, these related teams and products are starting to come closer together. They\u2019re building on unified tech, like Google\u2019s custom Tensor processors, and on common concepts like conversational AI.\nAs a result, Google I/O feels unusually\u2026 coherent this year. Google is trying \u2014 harder than I can remember \u2014 to build products that not only work well but work well together. Search is becoming a multisensory, multi-device proposition that understands both who\u2019s searching and what they\u2019re really looking for. It\u2019s also extending the search experience far beyond just questions and answers. It\u2019s making Android more context- and content-aware so that your phone changes to match the things you do on it. It\u2019s emphasizing natural interactions so that you can get information without memorizing a rigid set of commands. It\u2019s building the hardware ecosystem it needs to make all that work everywhere and the software to match.\nNow, let\u2019s be very clear: Google\u2019s work is only just beginning. It has to win market share in device categories it has failed for years to capture. It has to build new experiences inside new and old devices. It has to figure out how to solve Android fragmentation between its devices and the market-leading devices from companies like Samsung, which might be the hardest part of all. And it has to become more present in users\u2019 lives and extract more information from them, all without upsetting regulators, screwing up the search-ads business, or violating users\u2019 privacy. The ambient computer was never going to come easily, and Google has made its own efforts harder in countless ways over the years.\nBut at the very least, the company seems to finally understand what an ambient computer requires \u2014 and why \u201cit has Assistant!\u201d is not a sufficient answer \u2014 and is beginning the work to get it done.\nOne computer, many screens\nWhen I sat down with Osterloh over a video call a few days before I/O, he began to wax poetic about Google\u2019s hardware division, every so often glancing down just out of frame. I asked what he was looking at, suddenly suspicious it was a bunch of unreleased devices. I was right. \u201cThis is Pixel 6,\u201d he said, holding up his current device. \u201cAnd then, I have a Pixel 6A, in a very disguised case,\u201d this time holding up a black brick of rubber surrounding the unreleased device. \u201cAnd I have a Pixel 7, also in disguise.\u201d He held up his wrist, too, with a Pixel Watch strapped to it.\nAs we talked, Osterloh reiterated the usual Google pitch for ambient computing, but this time, it came with a bit of a twist to the familiar. The long-term vision is still an always-there version of Google that works everywhere with everything all the time, but right now? Right now, it\u2019s still all about the ultra-fast processor in your pocket. \u201cCertainly for the foreseeable future, we feel like the most crucial part of that is the pocketable computer, the mobile phone,\u201d he said. The smartphone is the center of the computing universe for billions of users around the globe, and so the first version of Osterloh\u2019s ambient computer will be built around a smartphone, too.\nThat\u2019s why, when Google set out to make the Pixel 6A \u2014 which is largely a cost-cutting exercise, trying to turn a $600 phone into a still-credible $449 one \u2014 one expensive part survived the cut. \u201cThe target of what Pixel is, is about having an awesome user experience that keeps getting better over time,\u201d Osterloh said. \u201cAnd with that as the core, what you realize is like the thing that is essential to have across these devices is Tensor.\u201d\nThe Google-designed Tensor processor was the key feature introduced alongside the Pixel 6, largely as a way to improve its on-device AI capabilities for speech recognition and more. And now, it seems, it\u2019s going to be a staple of the line: Osterloh said all the upcoming Pixel phones \u2014 and even the Android-powered tablet the team is working on for release next year \u2014 will run on its Tensor processor.\nThe smartphone is the center of the universe for now, but you can already start to see how that might change. The new Pixel Buds Pro are a powerful set of noise-canceling headphones, for instance, but also a hands-free interface into a wirelessly connected computing device.\n\u201cDevices that can be close to your ear and enable you to have real-time communication with the computer are an absolutely essential part of ambient computing,\u201d Osterloh said, noting that he now does most of his emailing via voice. Similarly, the new Pixel Watch is, in some ways, a phone accessory, delivering notifications and the like to your wrist and offering another interface to the same power in your pocket. But Google\u2019s also selling an LTE version, so you\u2019ll be able to access Assistant or pay with Google Wallet without needing your phone nearby. And that tablet, whenever it comes, will have all the same Pixel capabilities in a bigger shell.\nThe point is that it doesn\u2019t matter, in the long run, which device you use. \u201cWhere the computing capability is, and how powerful the devices themselves are, shouldn\u2019t matter to the user,\u201d Osterloh said. \u201cI think what they should see is increasing capabilities.\u201d\nThe Pixel and Android teams have recently adopted a sort of mantra: Better Together. Much of what\u2019s new this year in Android 13 is not whizbang new features but small tweaks meant to make the ecosystem a little more seamless. Through an update to the Chrome OS Phone Hub feature, you\u2019ll be able to use all your messaging apps on your Chromebook just as you would on your phone. Support for the Matter smart home standard now comes built into Android, which should make setting up and controlling new devices much easier. Google\u2019s extending support for its Cast protocols for sending audio and video to other devices and improving its Fast Pair services to make it easy to connect Bluetooth devices. It has been talking about these features since CES in January and has signed up an impressive list of partners.\nIt sounds a bit like Google finally watched an Apple ad and discovered that making hardware and software together really does help. Who knew! But Google\u2019s position is genuinely tricky here. Google\u2019s ad business relies on a mind-bendingly huge scale, which it gets mostly thanks to other companies building Android products. That means Google has to keep all those partners happy and feeling like they\u2019re on a level playing field with the Pixel team. And it simply can\u2019t control its ecosystem like Apple can. It is forever worrying about backward compatibility and how things will work on devices of all sizes, prices, and power. It has to engender support to make big changes, whereas Apple just brute-forces the future.\nBut Google has become increasingly bold in pushing ahead with the Pixel brand. It can afford to because Pixel is hardly a real sales threat to Samsung and others. (Besides, where are Android manufacturers going to go? Windows Mobile?) But it also has to because Google only wins if the ecosystem buys in, and Pixel is Google\u2019s best chance to model what the entire Android ecosystem should look like. That\u2019s what Osterloh sees as his job and, in large part, his team\u2019s reason for being.\nIf Pixel\u2019s never going to be a smash-hit bestseller (and it looks like it won\u2019t be), the only way Google can win in the long run is to use it as a way to pressure Samsung and others to keep up Google\u2019s features and ideas. Google has a chance to lead even more in tablets and smartwatches, two Android markets in desperate need of a path forward. \u201cPhone is certainly super important,\u201d said Sameer Samat, a VP of product management on the Android team. \u201cBut it\u2019s also becoming very clear that there are other device form factors which are complementary and also critical to a consumer deciding which ecosystem to buy into, and which ecosystem to live.\u201d\nThat\u2019s another way of saying the only way Google can get to its ambient computing dreams is to make sure Google is everywhere. Like, literally everywhere. That\u2019s why Google continues to invest in products in seemingly every square inch of your life, from your TV to your thermostat to your car to your wrist to your ears. The ambient-computing future may be one computer to rule them all, but that computer needs a near-infinite set of user interfaces.\nOutside the text box\nThe second step to making ambient computing work is to make it really, really easy to use. Google is relentlessly trying to whittle away every bit of friction involved in accessing its services, particularly the Assistant. For instance, if you own a Nest Hub Max, you\u2019ll soon be able to talk to it just by looking into its camera, and you\u2019ll be able to set timers or turn off the lights without issuing a command at all.\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like you and I having a conversation,\u201d said Nino Tasca, a director of product management on Google\u2019s speech team. \u201cSometimes, I\u2019ll use your name to start a conversation. But if I\u2019m already staring at you and ask you directly, you know I\u2019m talking to you.\u201d Google is obsessed with making everything natural and conversational because it\u2019s convinced that making it easy is actually more important than making it fast.\nThe same logic applies to search, which is quickly becoming a multi-sensory, multi-modal thing. \u201cThe way you search for information shouldn\u2019t be constrained to typing keywords into a search box,\u201d said Prabhakar Raghavan, Google\u2019s SVP for knowledge and information products. \u201cOur vision is to make the whole world around you searchable, so you can find helpful information about whatever you see, hear and experience, in whichever ways are most natural to you.\u201d\nThat has forced Google to reinvent both the input of search, leaning on voice and images just as much as the text box, as well as the output. \u201cSome people really find it easy to process video,\u201d said Liz Reid, a VP of engineering on the search team, \u201cand other people will find it distracting. On the other hand, some people\u2019s literacy is not as good, and so a long web page that you have to read through not only takes time, but they\u2019re gonna get lost, and a video that\u2019s spoken in their language is really intuitive.\u201d Google built one hell of a text box, but it\u2019s not enough anymore.\nThe most obvious outpouring of that work is multisearch. Using the Google app, you can take a photo of a dress \u2014 in Google\u2019s examples, it\u2019s always a dress \u2014 and then type \u201cgreen\u201d to search for that dress but in green. That\u2019s the kind of thing you just couldn\u2019t do in a text box.\nAnd at I/O, Google also showed off a tool for running multisearch on an image with multiple things in it: take a picture of the peanut butter aisle, type \u201cnut-free,\u201d and Google will tell you which one to buy. \u201cWe find when we unlock new capabilities that people had information needs that were just too hard to express,\u201d Reid said. \u201cAnd then they start expressing them on there.\u201d Search used to be one thing, Lens was another, voice was a third, but when you combine them, new things become possible.\nBut the real challenge for Google is that it\u2019s much more than a question-and-answer engine now. \u201cWhat\u2019s best isn\u2019t really, in many of these cases, a strict stack rank, right?\u201d Reid said. \u201cA lot of these newer use cases, there\u2019s a style or a taste component.\u201d Shopping has become important to Google, for instance, but there\u2019s no single correct answer for \u201cbest t-shirt.\u201d Plus, Google is using search more and more as a way to keep you inside Google\u2019s ecosystem; the search box is increasingly just a launcher to various Google things.\nSo rather than just aiming to understand the internet, Google has to learn to understand its users better than ever. Does it help that Google has a massive store of first-party data that it has collected over the last couple of decades on billions of people around the world? Of course it does! But even that isn\u2019t enough to get Google where it\u2019s going.\nAbout the ads: don\u2019t forget the fact that even in a world outside the search box, Google\u2019s still an advertising business. Just as Amazon\u2019s ambient computing vision seems to always come back to selling you things, Google\u2019s will always come back to showing you ads. And the thing about Google\u2019s whole vision is that it means a company that knows a lot about you and seems to follow you everywhere\u2026 will know even more about you and follow you even more places.\nGoogle seems to be going out of its way to try and make users feel comfortable with its presence\nGoogle seems to be going out of its way to try and make users feel comfortable with its presence: it\u2019s moving more AI to devices themselves instead of processing and storing everything in the cloud, it\u2019s pushing toward new systems of data collection that don\u2019t so cleanly identify an individual, and it\u2019s offering users more ways to control their own privacy and security settings. But the ambient-computer life requires a privacy tradeoff all the same, and Google is desperate to make it good enough that it\u2019s worth it. That\u2019s a high bar and getting higher all the time.\nActually, this whole process is full of high bars for Google. If it wants to build an ambient computer that can truly be all things to all people, it\u2019s going to need to build a sweeping ecosystem of hugely popular devices that all run compatible software and services while also seamlessly integrating with a massive global ecosystem of other devices, including those made by its direct competitors. And that\u2019s just to build the interface. Past that, Google has to turn the Assistant into something genuinely pleasurable to interact with all day and make its services flex to every need and workflow of users across the globe. Nothing about that will be easy.\nBut if you squint a little, you can see what it would look like. And that\u2019s what has been so frustrating about Google\u2019s approach in recent years: it feels like all the puzzle pieces to the future are sitting there in Mountain View, strewn around campus with no one paying attention. But now, as a company, Google appears to be starting to assemble them.\nCorrection May 16th, 4:30PM ET: An earlier version of this story said that Rick Osterloh originally spoke about ambient computing at Google I/O 2019. It was actually at Made By Google 2019. We regret the error."

      "text": "Apple and other smartphone makers have attributed falling revenues to customers not upgrading their handsets. That's a growing problem for the industry, but it's felt more acutely in some regions than others.\nIn the U.S. and Europe, especially, the life cycle of a smartphone has been steadily increasing, according to data from market research firm Kantar Worldpanel.\nIn 2016, American smartphone owners used their phones for 22.7 months on average before upgrading. By 2018, that number had increased to 24.7.\nUsers in five European countries tracked by Kantar Worldpanel \u2014 France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy and Spain \u2014 are keeping their phones for even longer. From 2016 to 2018, the life cycle of a smartphone was extended by nearly three months, from 23.4 to 26.2. Users in Great Britain logged the longest average of 27.7 months in 2018.\nAn earlier set of data showed similar trends from 2013 to 2015, but it's not directly comparable due to a change in methodology, Kantar said.\nThe life cycle of a smartphone in China was relatively shorter at 20.2 months in 2016 and 21 months for both 2017 and 2018.\nExperts said that trend may be due to reasons ranging from advancements in technology to the price of the phones.\nThe maturity of the market also matters, said Gerrit Schneemann, a senior analyst at IHS Markit. Most users in developed regions, such as Europe, are usually not on their first smartphone, but have found a model that is \"good enough for now,\" he said.\nDominic Sunnebo, global director for Kantar, echoed that sentiment. \"The age of poor smartphones is over (in Europe). Most consumers rate their smartphones very highly, so there is less push to change,\" he said.\nEuropean consumers also believe that the newer devices will be similar in terms of \"features and experience,\" he added.\nAdditionally, because handsets are increasingly advanced, they remain \"good enough\" for longer periods of time, according to IHS Markit's Schneemann. That's especially the case for Apple, which supports older generations better than other smartphone makers, he said.\n\"Apple is selling a long device life cycle as one of its differentiators and justification for its premium pricing,\" Schneemann said.\nHigh prices and broken upgrade cycles\niPhones are not the only ones that cost much more now than they did a few years ago. According to Kantar's Sunnebo, the flagship phones from the world's top three smartphone companies \u2014 Apple, Samsung and Huawei \u2014 saw an average price increase of 52% in three years. That's made people less eager to buy new devices, he said.\nFurthermore, European customers tend to pay the full cost of their handset up front more often than buyers in other markets, Schneemann said, adding that such users are \"likely to hold onto their phone(s) for longer before paying retail for the next phone.\"\nIt's not just that customers want to get the most value out of expensive phones.\nConsumers are increasingly moving away from mobile contracts with telecommunications carriers, and that breaks the \"natural handset upgrade cycle,\" said Sunnebo.\nOn the other hand, Schneemann said carriers and smartphone makers allow customers to pay for the costly devices in installments to combat \"sticker shock\" and make new models \"actually attainable.\"\n\"These payment plans have started to go from 24 months to 30 and even longer \u2014 all in an effort to keep $1,000+ smartphones at around $35/month,\" he told CNBC in an email.\nAs the Chinese market matures, it is likely that similar trends will emerge there, said Schneeman.\n\"Increasing device prices also reach Chinese consumers,\" he noted. \"In light of a weakening local economy, we have already seen (that) the Chinese market (is) not able to sustain its steep growth from earlier in the decade.\"\nWhy it matters\nSchneemann said it is significant that consumers in the U.S. and Europe are keeping their phones for extended lengths of time because smartphone makers need \"upgrade sales\" as high-growth markets slow down.\nDeloitte's 2017 Global Mobile Consumer Survey found that smartphone penetration is at 80% for developed markets and 82% for developing markets. The numbers have surely grown since then.\nThe motivation to buy a newer model will, \"at some point,\" come from the rollout of the next-generation high-speed mobile networking technology known as 5G, he said.\n\"Existing phones will not be able to access 5G networks, so in markets where coverage can be achieved rather quickly, there will be an incentive to upgrade,\" Schneemann said.\nHe acknowledged, however, that \"5G is not rolling out overnight across the globe\" and older networks will still exist in various markets for a long time.\nHe added: \"The key will be to present services and features that are not available on older devices \u2014 which significantly change the user experience and value proposition.\"\n\u2014CNBC's Steve Kovach and Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report."

      "text": "Smartwatches haven't quite been getting the same kind of interest as the early days, but is that because they are dying or have they just settled in and have become a part of our lives? Chip and Paul debate...\nAccording to a recent forecast from Internation Data Corp (IDC) published in June '18, we're going to be buying 43.5 million smartwatches in 2018. Estimated to double by 2022 as sales are forecasted to reach 89.1 million. Doesn't sound like a death cry to me.\nSo far from being dead, the smartwatch category is forecasted to grow, albeit with barely double digits, and let's not forget the growth the category has experienced to date.\nOf course, they're lies, damn lies, and statistics, as the quote goes, but maybe the question we should be asking is 'Why do we think smartwatches are dead?'\nSmartwatches, or even analog watches for that matter, aren't relevant to everyone - and that's fine. What this does mean is that there are fewer of us to get excited about this category.\nI would group smartwatches into the same category as the majority of consumer electronic devices, including tablets and televisions when it comes to how often we replace these devices, we just don't need to replace them as frequently. When Garmin announced the new Fenix 5 Plus family recently, I didn't need to rush out to replace my Fenix 5 that I purchased in March '17. This is a major contributing factor to lower overall sales when compared to smartphones.\nIt's still a young category. Yes, you either accept poor battery life or compromise on screen quality but we know that will improve when MicroLED displays arrive and as other components are optimized to sip even less juice. We've become accustomed to a rapid pace of change with our smartphones but smartwatch manufacturers and their component suppliers can't support that pace based on the smaller market and slower replacement cycle when compared to smartphones. Hence why Qualcomm's 3100 SoC for smartwatches is only just now about to be announced.\nThe new Samsung Galaxy WatchIf I'm not careful I'll just end up regurgitating my recent articles on wearables, so I'll draw it to a close. This week when Samsung launched the Galaxy Watch, while it wasn't a game changer, it's certainly becoming a more rounded and capable device.\nWhen I reviewed the Gear Sport last year I wasn't happy with the depth or breadth of the health and fitness elements and I found its real-world battery life wanting. The Galaxy Watch looks to have addressed some of those areas, only our review will tell, and with its new calendar watchface, Samsung proves it can still surprise us.\nSo yes, smartwatches are alive and well and growing. Thinking about it, by the time 2022 does come rolling around, our smartwatches will be packing MicroLED displays, multi-week battery life and a plethora of health and fitness sensors.\nTorture a data set long enough and it will admit to anything, right Paul? IDC is making a five-year prediction for a market that's barely 4 years old - I've seen more trustworthy stuff in Flat Earthers' Facebook pages. That same company predicted that Windows Phone would be the biggest gainer over the past four years, mind you.\nMeanwhile looking at data that hasn't been completely made up - that is actual sales show very modest single digit growth. And while any growth would normally appear as good news there are a few things to consider here.\nFirst and foremost the growth is mostly driven by smart bands rather than smartwatches - it's just that the market is so nuanced that instead of trying to find an arbitrary division line, statisticians lump them all in the smart wearable category. Second, this is a very new market with little revenue to it so it actually needs to be exploding to justify the substantial R&D costs and it simply isn't doing that.\nWhich would explain why after the initial enthusiasm, where everyone was overestimating the demand the smartwatch niche will create, it came time for a reality check. The smartwatches never really managed to excite casual consumers, who never saw how they can improve their lives.\nThis poured cold water on makers' ambitions as they realized people want smartwatches either as a fashion accessory with dial or as an aid in their running or cycling workouts. That's not much of market already and it's made even worse as the first group realizes that the price it has to pay for the cool customizable dials is charging another device all the time.\nSo we are seeing the same watches being released year after year with minor changes to their designs and few new features. The Apple Watch Series 3 might pack far more impressive hardware than the original Apple Watch, but in everyday it makes next to no difference. Same with Samsung's Galaxy Watch compared to the 2016 Gear S2 and Huawei's Watch 3 compared to the original Watch. Maker are left with price cuts and bundle deals to boost sales, rather than trying to release exciting new devices.\nIn conclusion I'd like to underline that I'm not saying that smartwatches will disappear altogether and their market will shrink to zero. They will still be around and there will always be several makers to offer different design options. However, they never managed to become a necessity on their own, which means their development will only depend on what smartphone components and features can be trickled down to them. And that means going forward the smartwatch market will be as exciting as the vacuum cleaner one. It may not be death, but it's hardly living either.\nYou\u2019ve heard our ramblings, now cast your votes. Do you side with Paul or do you think Chip has it right?\nI own a smartwatch for 2 years and I cannot imagine myself going back to the old-school watches. If you think a bit what is giving you a classic watch (time and good looks) then it is not really hard to imagine that easily you could match and exceed ...\nThe Pebble was the only Smartwatch worth buying. I went from a Pebble Time Steel to a Ticwatch and - well it's smarter, but I don't need that - it's even cheaper, but that doesn't matter to me. A Smartwatch worth buying needs 2 neccessary specs: 1.ba...\nDont get me wrong, Nobody is saying tablets are not useful, but my point is about their shelf life, smartwatches and tablets have a longer shelf life then a phone and easily last people a few years before upgrading, hense their apparent sales decline...\nTip us\n2.0m 150k\nRSS\nEV\nMerch\nLog in I forgot my password Sign up"

      "text": "Gemini has arrived on the wrist. It\u2019s now in the latest Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 series, the Pixel Watch, and rolling out to a handful of other smartwatches. This is big. Huge, even. AI is out here disrupting life as we know it. Now, it\u2019s making the leap from phones and laptops and onto the body. When the Galaxy Watch 8 launched, several product people told me this was going to make everything so much more convenient. Imagine, they said, having all the power of AI on you. Literally.\nI\u2019d love a more convenient, efficient life. Hands-free computing is, forgive the pun, genuinely handy. A competent, helpful AI assistant that you could interact with while on the go isn\u2019t the worst use case for AI I\u2019ve ever heard of.\nThe problem is I\u2019ve spent the last 20-plus years of my life reaching for my phone. It\u2019s not something I think about. It\u2019s something I just do. I\u2019ve also spent roughly a decade using Google Assistant. I know how to talk to Assistant. I\u2019m acutely aware of what it can and can\u2019t do. When I have to adjust my lights, set timers, or have a weird one-off question, I know exactly what to say and what will likely happen.\nThat\u2019s not something I have with AI. Yet.\nWhen it came time to test Gemini on the Galaxy Watch 8, I actually had to remember it was there. Even though it\u2019s better at natural language, I froze when it came time to talk to it. My brain glitched. This isn\u2019t Assistant! But you can still use the Hey Google command. Shit! You paused too long, and now it\u2019s doing something awkward! Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!\nThe other conundrum is knowing when and how to use Gemini on the wrist, versus Gemini on the phone, versus Gemini in your browser. At my Samsung demos, I was shown examples like, \u201cLook up the nearest gym locations and text them to my wife,\u201d \u201cStart a run for the number of calories in a pizza slice,\u201d and \u201cMake a playlist for a 10-minute run.\u201d When I probed reps to give other examples, some were game. Others looked at me like deer caught in headlights.\nCan\u2019t say I blame them. I ran into several snags when I tried those examples for myself. I tried starting a run for the number of calories in a pizza (a totally weird metric in the first place.) Apparently, when you don\u2019t specify the word \u201cslice,\u201d you get a target of 1,080 calories. For me, that\u2019s approximately 10 miles of running. I canceled that immediately. There were only so many playlists I could prompt Gemini to make before I got the itch to make my own again. I tried having Gemini look up coffee shops and send them to various people across different messaging apps. It worked a few times. Other times, it either didn\u2019t have access to an app like Slack, and would write out a list of 10 coffee shops. Another time, it recommended two shops forty blocks away.\nIt\u2019s one thing to know Gemini is capable of more complex tasks. It\u2019s another to know how to slot that into your life. Which is why I asked the team behind Gemini on the wrist to give me pointers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really easy to use Gemini as your second brain to offload whatever you need to remember,\u201d says Jean Lee, senior product manager on Gemini. \u201cThe beauty is it has context. It can access your chat history, but it also knows what you\u2019ve told Gemini about yourself in the past.\u201d\nAt that moment, Lee spoke into her wrist and asked Gemini what she should pack for the day. After a few seconds, it spat out that there would be scattered thunderstorms, a high of 97 degrees Fahrenheit with a real feel of 104 degrees, so Lee ought to pack pilates gear for a class later that day, a small packable umbrella, breathable and comfy clothing and shoes, and to avoid leather or suede materials.\nThe key here, Lee said, was previously telling Gemini that she doesn\u2019t like getting caught in the rain while wearing her suede loafers. When I asked what data it was pulling from, Lee noted that it was \u201cincorporating from saved information\u201d that she\u2019d told Gemini over time. Things like a preference for Sichuan food so that the next time she\u2019s in a new city, Gemini will remember to surface Sichuan restaurants in its recommendations.\n\u201cWith Assistant, you had to dictate the message you wanted to send,\u201d adds Jaime Williams, group product manager of Wear OS. \u201cThen it gives you the message, asks if you\u2019re ready to send it. It was several steps, and you had to be very prescriptive.\u201d\nWith Gemini, Williams says, you can just give the details of the message and a tone. Maybe you\u2019re running late, so you say, \u201cTell my spouse I\u2019m 15 minutes late and send it in a jokey tone.\u201d Instead of having to think of what to say, the bot will write it for you.\nOther examples Lee and Williams shared included remembering locker combinations for the gym and setting a reminder to pack an umbrella 10 minutes before it starts raining. While cooking, instead of having to look up the time for al dente penne pasta, you can just ask Gemini to set one for that.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve trained ourselves to be like, \u2018Okay, if I want to do this thing, then there\u2019s five steps. I have to first look this up, then send that message, and add it to my account. Gemini can do all of that for you,\u201d says Lee. \u201cIt can help you generate a video, but it\u2019s also like, how can we help ease the mental burden, the cognitive overload we all have through the day.\u201d\nConceptually, I get it. Cutting out the extraneous middle is the big pitch for most AI products. But to get to that point requires you to first rewire your brain. You have to invest effort into training an AI to know you. That, in turn, demands that you fight your existing programming.\nI tried Lee\u2019s example of setting a reminder to pack an umbrella 10 minutes before rain. I\u2019ve since been rained on twice.\nMuch of that is on me. I started with a clumsy prompt: \u201cHey Google, is it going to rain today, and if so, remind me to pack an umbrella.\u201d It was a sunny day, so Gemini declined. I then asked it to remember that I hate getting caught without an umbrella during rainstorms. It did. I then asked it to remind me to pack an umbrella the next time it rains. It, again, told me that it was sunny. Frustrated, I pulled out my phone to look up the 10-day forecast myself.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that generative AI can be so open-ended and unpredictable compared to voice assistants. The latter has fixed phrases and capabilities. Their stricter limitations make them easier to learn, even if they can be fairly frustrating. Conversely, tech CEOs keep telling us that they can\u2019t wait to see what use cases we come up with for generative AI. But because the possibilities are endless, it\u2019s hard to know where to start. You end up defaulting to what you\u2019re familiar with. That leads to unimpressive prompts, such as commands to schedule your smart lights or low-stakes queries about calories in pizza \u2014 things that Assistant can already do.\nBut because the possibilities are endless, it\u2019s hard to know where to start. You end up defaulting to what you\u2019re familiar with.\nThe unpredictability of generative AI also means you can ask for one thing (a reminder to carry an umbrella) and end up with a result you didn\u2019t want (Gemini declining because it\u2019s sunny). With Gemini on smartwatches, I have another layer to factor in: optimization. Because it\u2019s on the body, I have to think about what queries make more sense to ask on the wrist versus my phone. Is it that Gemini on the wrist is only a hands-free backup for my phone? Or are there scenarios and prompts that make more sense on that form factor? I\u2019m honestly struggling to figure it out.\nI\u2019m not giving up. Mostly because I\u2019m stubborn, but also because my job incentivizes me to figure out how to best use this tech and discover what its limits are. I have a vested interest in not always reaching for my phone. But the average person? You can\u2019t just give them a new tool and say, \u201cHave at it!\u201d That\u2019s like giving someone a bucket of Legos and telling them to build the Millennium Falcon from memory. Sure, a few prodigies will make it look easy. The rest of us will probably give up because it\u2019s easier. But anyone could build it if you simply gave them a blueprint to work off of.\nThat\u2019s the thing about new tech. It\u2019s not enough to say, \u2018This will make your life easier.\u2019 It has to be intuitive. If it\u2019s not intuitive, you have to spell it out. With Gemini on the wrist, you\u2019re asking people to do something new that requires a whole new mindset and muscle memory. You have to give them a reason why that effort is worth it. Otherwise, everyone will simply go back to what they know: their phones."
