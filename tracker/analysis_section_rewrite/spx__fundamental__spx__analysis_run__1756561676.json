      "feedback": "**Feedback & Action Items**  \n1. **Handle Mapping** – The draft does not link to any canonical handle (spx, ndx, ust10y, dxy, etc.). Crypto is not in the canonical list, so the topic must be dropped or reframed to a handle such as *dxy* (if you can justify that Ether price moves materially affect the dollar) or *usdcnh* (if you can tie it to dollar‑yen flows).  \n2. **Causal Chain & Transmission** – Add an explicit, step‑by‑step chain:  \n   *Fed policy → risk‑on sentiment → institutional crypto demand → Ether price* and *staking supply contraction → price pressure*. Each link must be supported by a source ID.  \n3. **Citation Density & Accuracy** – Replace the blanket “OGK8WLL69” with the correct IDs:  \n   * Fed hint (source 1),  \n   * Executive order (source 3),  \n   * Institutional demand (source 2),  \n   * Staking supply (source 4).  \n   Every quantitative claim (e.g., 15 % rally, 45 % corporate treasury allocation) must cite the appropriate source.  \n4. **Quantification & Range** – Derive the $4,500–$5,500 base‑case range from a credible projection (e.g., source 2’s ETF inflows or source 4’s staking data). Provide a clear magnitude range for each risk (e.g., regulatory tightening could cut upside by 20 %).  \n5. **Catalyst Window** – Specify a dated catalyst window: Fed meeting 2025‑09‑16‑17, executive order 2025‑08‑09, corporate treasury data 2025‑06‑30.  \n6. **Remove/Replace Generic Sentences** – Flag and edit the following drifting sentences:  \n   *“The base case projects Ether trading in the $4,500–$5,500 range over the next three to five years”* – add source.  \n   *“The price trajectory is sensitive to the Fed’s policy path; a dovish stance that delays cuts could dampen risk appetite”* – cite source 1.  \n   *“Regulatory developments remain a pivotal catalyst; any significant tightening of crypto oversight could trigger a rapid sell‑off”* – cite source 3.  \n   *“Macro‑risk premia, particularly in the wake of rising tariffs or geopolitical tensions, could erode the risk‑on environment”* – cite source 1 or 2.  \n   *“Key risks to this view include regulatory uncertainty, macro‑risk premia, competitive pressure”* – each risk needs a source.  \n7. **Format & Length** – Trim the draft to a concise, bullet‑style format (≤200 words). Each bullet should state: direction, magnitude range (bp/%), horizon, catalyst, and invalidation.  \n8. **Confidence & Watch List** – End with a confidence rating (e.g., “moderate‑high”) and a short watch list (Fed policy, regulatory updates, corporate treasury flows).  \n\nImplement these edits to meet the acceptance gate and achieve a world‑class, defensible macro view.",
