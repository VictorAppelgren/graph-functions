      "text": "Rams' Matthew Stafford 'didn't feel good enough to practice' Monday, per Sean McVay\nMatthew Stafford's training camp debut ended up being a false start.\nThe Los Angeles Rams quarterback has been sidelined for the entirety of training camp thus far with a back injury. Stafford received an epidural to relieve the pain from an aggravated disc in his back, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport on Aug. 6.\nStafford went through a workout on Saturday, throwing 60 passes without limitations. Head coach Sean McVay was optimistic about the 37-year-old quarterback, revealing the team planned to have him in training camp practice on Monday.\nThat was short-lived, however, as Stafford appeared at practice in street clothes.\nMcVay said, via the team's website, that Stafford \"didn't feel good enough\" to participate, adding that they would take a cautious approach.\nThe Rams coach said that Stafford \"had a great workout\" and \"felt good\" on Saturday, \"but then you come into today (Monday), it doesn't feel great, and so didn't think it was the right decision to be able to push him.\"\nWith the Rams' season opener less than a month away, the clock is ticking on Stafford's ability to be ready in time for Week 1 \u2013 even if the veteran figures to require less practice at this stage of his career.\nMcVay continued to emphasize the importance of being smart in their approach to the injury, stating that they'll continue to take it one day at a time.\n\"More than anything, I feel for a guy that I really care about that wants to be out there more than anything else,\" McVay said. \"We're going to be smart. But he didn't feel good enough, and we didn't think it was the right thing to do based on how he woke up feeling today.\"\nAs for the possibility of surgery, McVay said that wasn't a conversation they've had, adding that it hasn't come up. He was also non-committal about Stafford's status if there was a regular season game this week, saying he didn't know if the quarterback could play, but added, \"I think he still probably would be able to play just based on how he feels.\"\nThere are still a few weeks to sort everything out, but for now, it's Jimmy Garoppolo who continues to get the first-team reps in practice.\nStetson Bennett has slid up into the backup role as a result.\nAs for the Rams, they'll want Stafford atop the depth chart when they battle the Houston Texans in Week 1. Based on McVay's comments, however, don't expect L.A. to rush him back."

      "text": "Matthew Stafford's back injury isn't a concern, but Rams using caution with quarterback\nMatthew Stafford will be back (pun intended). It\u2019s not time to be concerned\u2026yet.\n\u201cI think the fair answer is, I'm going to take it a day at a time as well,\u201d Los Angeles Rams coach Sean McVay answered on Monday, Aug. 11 when asked if he was concerned about Stafford\u2019s back ailment. \u201cI can't be 27 days from now in Houston.\u201d\nIt\u2019s fair to raise an eyebrow about Stafford\u2019s aggravated disk in his back that\u2019s caused him to miss training camp. The veteran quarterback was supposed to practice in some capacity on Monday after a throwing session on Saturday, but he didn\u2019t \u201cfeel great\u201d following the workout.\n\u201cI feel for Matthew because of how much he wants to be out there and feel good. Ultimately what ended up happening, had a great workout, felt good, but then come in (Monday), it doesn't feel great. (I) didn't think that was the right decision to be able to push him,\u201d McVay said. \u201cWe're going to be smart, but he didn't feel good enough and we didn't think it was the right thing to do based on how he woke up feeling today.\u201d\nThe Rams are \u201csmart\u201d to be cautious with Stafford. He\u2019s a 37-year-old quarterback entering NFL season No. 17. He\u2019s in the fifth year of McVay\u2019s offense and knows the scheme. The Rams have more than three weeks until their 2025 season opener at SoFi Stadium against the Houston Texans.\nTwenty-plus days out, it\u2019s not time to be overly concerned. However, the concern meter rises incrementally each passing day Stafford is out of practice. Stafford is missing valuable practice reps with new addition wideout Davante Adams. Plus, there\u2019s natural rust the veteran quarterback will have to work through when he does return.\nHow many practice reps will Stafford have before Sept. 7? Will Stafford be able to shake off any rust from his absence before it\u2019s time for the real action? Two of the Rams\u2019 first three games are against playoff teams from a season ago, including the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles.\nThe positive news is the Rams have shown the capability to rebound from a shaky start. They began the 2024 season 1-4 before rallying to win the NFC West title. The bad news is Stafford\u2019s a 37-year-old quarterback with back issues. Stafford was sacked 28 times last year. He was hit 63 times, the most in his four seasons in Los Angeles. What happens when Stafford takes hits this season? Back issues tend to occasionally flare up for an athlete Stafford\u2019s age.\nThe Rams are right to exercise caution. It\u2019s not time to be concerned. But the situation can change quickly, especially with a veteran quarterback\u2019s back.\n\u201cHe looked damn good throwing the other day. Nobody's tougher than him,\u201d McVay said. \u201cWe also want to see if we can have him feeling as good as possible. That's super important.\u201d\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon on X @TheTylerDragon."
