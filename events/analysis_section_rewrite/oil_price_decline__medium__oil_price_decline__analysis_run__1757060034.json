      "feedback": "Your “analysis draft” is currently empty – it contains only a refusal statement. To meet the Argos standards you must replace that with a fully‑structured 3–6 month scenario that: 1) identifies a single canonical handle (e.g., US CPI, US UST10Y, US DXY, US SPX, US Gold, US Brent, US Copper, US Credit/Vol) with a clear sign and magnitude range; 2) links every substantive claim to a specific source ID from the supplied articles (e.g., *finance.yahoo.com* id for Canadian small‑caps, *forbes.com* id for China‑Russia trade, *bloomberg.com* id for sanctions, etc.); 3) maps the causal chain from macro drivers (e.g., BoC easing, China‑Russia trade flows, US sanctions, hydrogen‑sensor tech) to the chosen handle, specifying the transmission path (e.g., BoC easing → lower US‑USD demand → weaker DXY → higher commodity prices → +5 % US Gold over 4 months); 4) lists a dated catalyst window (e.g., BoC policy meeting on 2025‑10‑15, China‑Russia trade data release on 2025‑11‑01, US sanctions update on 2025‑09‑30) and an invalidation scenario (e.g., BoC holds rates, China‑Russia trade stalls); 5) quantifies ranges (e.g., DXY +0.5 % to +1.5 %); 6) ends with a base case, 1–2 alternatives, risk watch‑list signals, and a confidence rating. Ensure the narrative stays within the 3–6 month horizon, avoids generic platitudes, and cites at least one source per claim. This will transform the draft into a defensible, actionable macro view.",
