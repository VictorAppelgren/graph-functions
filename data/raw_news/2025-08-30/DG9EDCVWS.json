  "title": "This Final Fantasy Tactics-inspired indie strategy RPG with anime fish and lizard people was fully funded on Kickstarter in less than a week, and after that banger of an elevator pitch, are we even surprised?",
  "description": "Beaten Path looks like Final Fantasy Tactics but just extremely anime",
  "content": "Apparently, when you're a competent indie developer and you tell people you're making a strategy RPG inspired by two of the all-time greats, Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblem, people just throw their wallets at you. And that's exactly what happened when indie developer Peacebreak Studio brought Beaten Path to Kickstarter.\n\nThe solo developer set an initial goal of $20,000, and in an update shared to the game's Kickstarter page, confirmed that the goal was reached in less than a week.\n\nA quick but notable aside: it seems Beaten Path was first revealed back in September 2023, but it looked like a completely different game visually and narratively. With a new \"announce trailer\" seemingly relaunching the project just a week ago, it seems what we're seeing now is a rebooted version with a whole new vision.\n\nAnyway, with that mildly confusing situation out of the way, Beaten Path is billed as \"a turn-based tactical RPG set in a world ruled by fallen gods and ancient machines,\" explicitly inspired by Fire Emblem and Final Fantasy Tactics and \"combining the turn-based tactical gameplay with a high level of customization and exciting abilities.\"\n\nYou play as Panna, who, surprise surprise, suffers from amnesia and has to retrace her steps and uncover clues to her forgotten past as well as her role in a world-changing war that seems to have happened.\n\n\"The truth is hidden in ruined machines, old allies, and looping memories \u2014 waiting to be pieced together.\"\n\nAlong the way, she'll meet up to 20 recruitable allies as well as 30 different enemy types, \"from the fish-folk of Osmer to the lizard-folk of Woodfir.\" Duh, it wouldn't be an anime game if it didn't have fish and lizard people.\n\nLike any good strategy RPG, there's a good variety of landscapes to explore, including deserts, snowy landscapes, swamps, and castles, as well as a central hub town where you'll find all of your shops and allies hanging out.\n\nCuriously, Peacebreak says Beaten Path battles have \"a focus on varying victory conditions and moving away from the typical 'defeat all enemies' condition seen in many tactics games.\" So, it sounds like victory and failure exist on a spectrum in this game, where you can fail to complete every objective and still notch a win based on other variables.\n\nBeaten Path seems like it has a lot of potential. I'm particularly encouraged by the developer's emphasis on immersion and worldbuilding in addition to the combat, which is something they feel is missing from other strategy RPGs.\n\n\"With this game, I get to experiment and flesh out the features I enjoy the most and make them my own,\" reads the description. \"Something like a fully explorable, 3D overworld is rarely done and the focus is instead on the battles.\n\n\"To me, that has always seemed like a missed opportunity to grow the world and let the player live in it for longer. This extends even further to the story: while I love the fantasy worlds these games tend to be set in, I rarely felt like the worlds were built with enough detail and immersion to feel like some of my favorite fantasy book series and instead they focused on moving through the plot at a brisk pace.\"\n\nIt seems like Peacebreaker is targeting a June 2026 release for Beaten Path, and while it's only confirmed for PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store at the moment, one of the stretch goals is a console launch, so there's no ruling out a Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox Series X release.\n\nHere are some more upcoming indie games you should have on your radar.",

Coming from Untitled Goose Game and Thank Goodness You're Here publisher, Panic, it looks set to be a sort of FMV, text-based \"television experience\" that draws inspiration from '80s and '90s on a channel known as Blippo+. It certainly seems wonderfully weird, and we're here for it.\nBall x Pit\nRelease date: October 15, 2025\nPlatform(s): PC, Xbox Series X/S, PS5, Switch, Switch 2\nBall x Pit is a fast-paced fusion of bullet hell meets roguelite with base-building elements that sees you batter down pits of monsters with magically-infused projectiles.

Eventually, I earned an MA in magazine journalism at Cardiff University, and soon after got my first official role in the industry as a content editor for Stuff magazine. After writing about all things tech and games-related, I then did a brief stint as a freelancer before I landed my role as a staff writer here at GamesRadar+. Now I get to write features, previews, and reviews, and when I'm not doing that, you can usually find me lost in any one of the Dragon Age or Mass Effect games, tucking into another delightful indie, or drinking far too much tea for my own good.\n- Emma-Jane BettsManaging Editor, Evergreens\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "Square Enix team behind JRPG gems like Octopath Traveler is trading turn-based combat for Zelda-like action with The Adventures of Elliot in hopes of reaching \"a new audience\"\n\"As the HD-2D series has expanded and evolved, we\u2019ve gradually shifted genres\"\nThe head behind Square Enix's Team Asano says its new HD-2D JRPG being more The Legend of Zelda than vintage Final Fantasy is a \"good direction\" for the team that he hopes will \"reach out to a new audience of gamers.\"\nAt last week's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase, Square Enix unveiled The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales \u2013 you know, the game we thought was the rumoured Octopath Traveler game before we got the actual new Octopath Traveler game. It's an HD-2D RPG from the internal Square Enix studio behind the likes of Octopath Traveler, Triangle Strategy, and more \u2013 if the signature art style didn't give it away.\nWhat sets this one apart, though, is that it's an action RPG that ditches the turn-based stylings of Octopath Traveler and Triangle Strategy. While that may seem quite the leap, Tomoya Asano \u2013 in charge of concept and planning \u2013 says the move is quite natural.\n\"As the HD-2D series has expanded and evolved, we\u2019ve gradually shifted genres,\" he says. \"We started with a classic RPG with Octopath Traveler and went on to do a strategy game with Triangle Strategy. When we thought about where to go next, we felt that challenging ourselves to an action RPG would be a good direction.\n\"It goes without saying that we want to deliver this game to all the people who enjoyed the games that we have made previously (Bravely Default, Octopath Traveler, Triangle Strategy, etc.), but I would be delighted if it could reach out to a new audience of gamers as well!\"\nInitially hearing that the developer behind some of my favorite turn-based JRPGs was going the action route with its new game did get an initial 'oh no' from me, but in fairness to The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales, it's just as enamoured with the past as the rest of Team Asano's work.\nI'd nudge you towards the demo currently available on the OG Switch and Switch 2, but it very much hits the vibe of older Mana and Zelda games. There's no turn-based combat, of course, but you can run around swinging a good ol' sword and firing off some arrows. In fact, if you really want to get your Link on, you can lay waste to the pots of the world as if your life depends on it.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nThe Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales launches next year for Nintendo Switch 2, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC through Steam and Microsoft Store.\nI joined GamesRadar+ in May 2022 following stints at PCGamesN and PocketGamer.Biz, with some freelance for Kotaku UK, RockPaperShotgun, and VG24/7 thrown in for good measure. When I'm not running the news team on the games side, you'll find me putting News Editor duties to one side to play the hottest JRPG of 20 years ago or pillaging the depths of Final Fantasy 14 for a swanky new cloak \u2013 the more colourful, the better.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."

      "text": "Presented by Retrovibe sp. z o.o.\nSacriFire is an HD-2D ode to 90s JRPGs you can wishlist on Steam now\nSci-fi and fantasy collide in this throwback RPG\nIt's a good time to be a JRPG fan. Past the recent success of RPG throwback with modern polish Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, we've built up a solid offering of HD-2D JRPGs that freshen up classics like Dragon Quest and Live-A-Live, while other 16-bit inspired games like Sea of Stars give newer developers the chance to emulate the games of their childhood. If you're looking for more of the latter, you need not look further than the sci-fi and fantasy blend of SacriFire.\nAs seen in a new trailer shown at the Future Games Show Summer Showcase, the JRPG inspirations are easy to see. You've got the HD-2D graphics, dynamic scraps that merge real-time and turn-based, and a battle between two sides where faith is questioned.\nAs per developer PixelatedMilk, the goal is both to respect and subvert the standard RPG tropes from all the games they've played since the 90s. Here's the story blurb:\n\"SacriFire tells the story of Ezekiel Ridan, a young soldier training to join an elite sect of the Church of Sheol. Ezekiel longs to do his part keeping the underground city of Antioch safe from the demons which roam the surface above, but little suspects the role he is soon to play in a more profound struggle \u2013 a struggle thousands of years in the making, waged between entities far beyond his understanding.\"\nNaturally, Ezekiel's adventure will lead him to places he's never imagined and he uncovers secrets that cause him to question everything he believes. On that journey, you'll travel between the sprawling city of Antich and the \"idyllic spirit paradise\" of Erebus, where neon-soaked sci-fi inspirations clash with the classic fantasy trappings of the JRPG genre.\nIt's not all about the views, though, as you'll adopt combat disciplines and craft weapons while traveling to mix up your fighting style between solving puzzles to get through dungeons.\nSacriFire is currently set for a Q1 2026 release on PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nIf you\u2019re looking for more excellent games from today's Future Games Show, have a look at our official Steam page.\nI joined GamesRadar+ in May 2022 following stints at PCGamesN and PocketGamer.Biz, with some freelance for Kotaku UK, RockPaperShotgun, and VG24/7 thrown in for good measure.

      "text": "Square Enix hasn't abandoned turn-based JRPGs, but the creators of Octopath Traveler and Bravely Default have followed Final Fantasy with a new action RPG \u2013 still in the gorgeous HD-2D style\nThe Adventures of Elliott: The Millennium Tales has a demo out today\nWhen Square Enix showed up at today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase with an unannounced action RPG packing HD-2D graphics, fairy friends, magic crystal customization, familiar sprites and character portraits, and a distinct emphasis on traveling, I was fully prepared for a Bravely Default or Octopath Traveler spinoff or installment that had ditched turn-based combat, echoing the recent trajectory of the mainline Final Fantasy games and the FF7 remake trilogy.\nInstead, it turns out we actually live in the best timeline for once: this action RPG is all-new, every bit as gorgeous as Bravely Default and Octopath, and the proudly turn-based Octopath Traveler 0 was announced immediately afterward. Plus, it turns out the reason it looks so familiar is that it's from \"the creators of Octopath Traveler and Bravely Default,\" per its announcement trailer.\nSquare's new HD-2D action RPG is The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales, and it really does look like a punchy, dungeon-crawler version of Octopath, just with one playable character. It's coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026, an eShop exclusive demo is out today, and it genuinely looks great.\nIt's unclear if the game will come to other platforms, though it does currently sound like only the demo is a Nintendo exclusive. Octopath Traveler 2 notably came to all platforms, and Bravely Default 2 was eventually released on both Switch and PC. (Update: Square Enix has confirmed that The Adventures of Elliot is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC in 2026 as well.)\nThis will sound far-fetched: you play as Elliot, an adventurer joined by a fairy named Faie on \"a top-down journey in a wide-open world woven across time and space,\" Square Enix says. \"Open new paths as you explore an untamed continent and reveal its mysterious history. Navigate battles with strategic support abilities provided by a helpful fairy.\"\nWe've only got one Elliot, but he's got seven weapon types, filling out the game's combat system with ranged and melee options. Weapons can be improved via equipable \"Magicite\" crystals, and Faie will also fight in combat or assist with puzzles (with optional co-op where player two takes control of Faie). It's a nice little surprise from Square Enix, which says it has a survey coming to gather player feedback from the demo.\nWeekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more\nAustin has been a game journalist for 12 years, having freelanced for the likes of PC Gamer, Eurogamer, IGN, Sports Illustrated, and more while finishing his journalism degree. He's been with GamesRadar+ since 2019. They've yet to realize his position is a cover for his career-spanning Destiny column, and he's kept the ruse going with a lot of news and the occasional feature, all while playing as many roguelikes as possible.\nYou must confirm your public display name before commenting\nPlease logout and then login again, you will then be prompted to enter your display name."
