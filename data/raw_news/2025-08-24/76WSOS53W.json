  "description": "Pauline Hanson is calling for an urgent change to the law in Australia.",
  "content": "One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has demanded that burning the national flag be made a criminal offence and launched a petition to push for the change.\n\n'Burning or desecrating our flag is not a harmless act. It is a threatening act of aggression, a symbolic attack, and a call for violence against our country, its institutions, and its people,' she said.\n\n'Australians are sick of seeing these threats, the aggression, and the attacks on our nation and its people go unpunished. No more excuses. Enough is enough.'\n\nUnlike some countries, there are no federal or state laws that prohibit burning or desecrating the Australian flag, explained Dr Nigel Stobbs, a law academic at QUT.\n\n'Many politicians, lawyers, and academics claim, in fact, that it is a legitimate act of political protest,' Dr Stobbs said.\n\n'If the flag in question is the property of the person doing the burning, then the law generally recognises the right of a person to dispose of their property in any way they see fit, including burning it.'\n\nWhile flag burning in Australia is not illegal in itself, you can still be charged if it breaks other laws.\n\nFor example, if the flag belongs to someone else, burning it could be treated as wilful damage.\n\nIf it happens in public and is considered offensive, disorderly, or threatening, it may fall under public order laws.\n\nIf the act creates a fire hazard, you could be charged under fire safety regulations.\n\nAnd if the burning is done in a way that incites violence or racial hatred, it may breach hate speech or incitement laws.\n\nSenator Hanson's comments come after a group of masked pro-Palestine demonstrators burned the Australian flag during a rally in Melbourne and spray-painted the words 'Abolish Australia' on the road.",
