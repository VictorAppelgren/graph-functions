  "content": "The FBI raided the home of John Bolton , President Trump 's former national security adviser, on Friday morning, multiple  outlets  reported .\n\nWhy it matters: Bolton was vocal in his criticism of the president after working in the first Trump administration. Trump has aggressively used the power of the presidency to punish political foes.\n\nThe FBI and White House did not immediately respond to Axios' request for comment.\n\nDriving the news: The raid is part of a high-profile national security probe involving classified documents, according to the New York Post, which first reported the news.\n\nWhat we're watching: \"NO ONE is above the law,\" FBI Director Kash Patel wrote on X Friday morning, without reference to a specific situation. \"FBI agents on mission.\"\n\nZoom out: In January, Trump stripped Bolton's security protections along with those of other political adversaries.\n\nIn a foreword to his memoir that published last year Bolton wrote that \"a mountain of facts demonstrates that Trump is unfit to be President.\"\n\nPublication of Bolton's memoir was delayed in 2020 as the White House reviewed its content.\n\nContext: Bolton has faced death threats from Iran after being a fierce critic of the regime.\n\nIn 2022, an Iranian national was charged in connection with a plot to assassinate Bolton.\n\nGo deeper: First look: John Bolton's predictions for a second Trump term",
