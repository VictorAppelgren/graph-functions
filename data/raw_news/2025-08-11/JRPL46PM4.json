  "title": "New WWE PLE Coming in September: Report",
  "description": "WWE is expected to announce a significant event.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nThe competition between WWE and AEW is reportedly about to escalate, as WWE is planning a brand-new premium live event that will go head-to-head with one of AEW's biggest shows of the year. The move would mark a significant new front in the ongoing wrestling wars.\n\nAccording to a new report from POST Wrestling, the unnamed WWE event is scheduled for Saturday, September 20th, in Indianapolis, Indiana. This is the same night that All Elite Wrestling will present its All Out pay-per-view from Toronto, Ontario.\n\nA New Front In The Wrestling Wars\n\nThis planned event marks a major escalation in the competition between the two top wrestling promotions in North America. While WWE has previously scheduled its developmental brand, NXT, to run premium live events on the same day as AEW pay-per-views, this would be the first time a main roster WWE PLE has gone in direct competition with a major AEW show.\n\nA main roster event would feature WWE's top stars, such as the Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes and World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins. This would force wrestling fans to choose which major event to watch live, a scenario reminiscent of the famous Monday Night Wars of the 1990s.\n\nSince AEW's inception in 2019, the two companies have been in a constant battle for viewership and fan loyalty. This was most prominent during the \"Wednesday Night War\" from 2019 to 2021, when AEW's flagship show, Dynamite, went head-to-head with WWE NXT. AEW largely won that ratings battle, which eventually led to NXT moving to Tuesday nights.\n\nThis new move by WWE is a far more aggressive tactic. AEW's All Out is one of its \"big four\" annual pay-per-views and is the spiritual successor to the \"All In\" event that launched the company. By scheduling a main roster PLE against it, WWE is taking direct aim at one of its competitor's cornerstone events.\n\nWhile the new WWE premium live event has not yet been named, the company recently filed a trademark for the classic WCW pay-per-view name, \"SuperBrawl.\" It is possible that this iconic name from the Monday Night Wars could be revived for this new, competitive showdown.\n\nFor more on WWE, head to Newsweek Sports.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\nKacy Catanzaro, known to WWE fans as Katana Chance, has opened up about her nearly eight-year tenure with the company following her release in May 2025. The former multi-time tag team champion shared her story on the Lightweights podcast.\nShe noted that she often felt creatively stifled and unable to fully explore her own character. Catanzaro believed that from the moment talent reaches WWE television, they are often guided in a specific direction.\n\"I don't know if I ever fully was able to really find myself in it,\" Catanzaro stated. \"Because when you're in there and then you're getting on TV, you're put in these spots and you're needed to be a specific thing right away.\"\nWhile acknowledging that WWE talent can pitch different character ideas to management, she noted that the company ultimately has the final say on a performer's on-screen persona. This dynamic was a challenge for her.\n\"That was an ongoing struggle of mine throughout my journey, which is\u2014I don't know that I actually ever got to do that,\" she reflected. \"And fully find if I was myself or whatever I wanted to be with no restrictions, what it would have been.\"\nMore news: WWE News: Steve Austin Reveals Real-Life Vince McMahon Confrontation\nCatanzaro first gained public attention as a standout competitor on \"American Ninja Warrior\" before signing with WWE in 2017. She joined the NXT brand, where her incredible athleticism quickly made her a fan favorite.\nIn NXT, she formed a highly successful and popular tag team with Kayden Carter. Together, they achieved significant milestones, including a record-setting 186-day reign as NXT Women's Tag Team Champions.\nTheir chemistry and success led to a main roster call-up to RAW. Chance and Carter continued their tag team run, eventually capturing the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship, solidifying their status as champions on both brands.\nIt will be interesting to see what she does with her career going forward, whether that is choosing a new career path or staying in wrestling.\nIf she stays in wrestling, perhaps TNA is a destination she can land at and sign with. TNA has a working relationship with WWE and could be used as a way to get back to WWE if she wants to do that.\nMore WWE News:\n- WWE Superstar Reveals He Was Asked To Change Physical Appearance\n- WWE Has Big Plans for Alexa Bliss: Report\n- WWE Hall Of Famer Returns In Backstage Role\nFor more on WWE, head to Newsweek Sports.\nAbout the writer\nAndrew Ravens is a Newsweek reporter.

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nThe recent wave of WWE releases that impacted both main roster and NXT talents last week has prompted one competitor to announce the conclusion of her wrestling career. NXT performer Dani Palmer confirmed she was among those let go by the company and subsequently revealed her retirement from athletic competition due to injury setbacks.\nPalmer was part of a large group of releases that included main roster names like Braun Strowman, Shayna Baszler, and Dakota Kai, as well as fellow NXT talents such as Gigi Dolin, Cora Jade, Gallus, and others. Following the news, Palmer took to social media to address her departure and future.\nIn an emotional statement, she expressed gratitude for her time and confirmed her decision to retire: \"Thank you WWE for bringing me to the love of my life\ud83e\udd0d the past 3 years have been amazing! It's a bittersweet feeling to be officially closing out my athletic career, but I can truly say I went til the wheels fell off..literally lol.

Gods been giving me some big dreams with bringing my business back and I couldn't be more stoked about it! Thank you all for the support\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\"\nA subsequent report from Fightful Select corroborated her retirement intentions, noting that industry sources they spoke with \"don't believe that Dani Palmer will continue in wrestling.\"\nMore news: WWE News: Steve Austin Reveals Real-Life Vince McMahon Confrontation\nDani Palmer (real name Alexis Amrhein), a highly decorated former collegiate acrobat and tumbler who secured three NCAA National Championships, joined WWE through its Next In Line (NIL) program in 2022. After training at the Performance Center, she primarily competed on the NXT Level Up show and had a brief tag team run with Tatum Paxley on NXT television.\nUnfortunately, her progress was significantly hampered by a serious hip injury that required surgery in 2024, keeping her sidelined prior to her release. Her retirement marks an unfortunate end to a promising athletic career cut short by injury. It's unclear what she will be doing with herself going forward as a career, but it won't be as a pro wrestler.\nMore WWE News:\n- WWE Superstar Reveals He Was Asked To Change Physical Appearance\n- WWE Has Big Plans for Alexa Bliss: Report\n- WWE Hall Of Famer Returns In Backstage Role\nFor more on WWE, head to Newsweek Sports.\nAbout the writer\nAndrew Ravens is a Newsweek reporter.

Inconsistencies may occur.\nFormer WWE star Nixon Newell, previously known as Tegan Nox, recently expressed a strong desire to join All Elite Wrestling but revealed she does not believe the company is currently interested in signing her.\nAfter being released from her WWE contract in November 2024, Newell has been navigating free agency. During an interview on the Wrestling in the Middle podcast (H/T to WrestlingNews.co), she was direct about her interest in working for AEW.\n\"I would love to go there. There's so many people there that I want to wrestle,\" Newell stated. She specifically mentioned wanting to renew her old rivalry with a top AEW star.\n\"I really want to tangle with Toni Storm again. I wrestled Toni, yes, many years on the Indies. So I'd like to, you know, revisit that,\" she said.\nDespite her enthusiasm for potential dream matches, Newell was candid about her perception of AEW's interest in her as a free agent.\nMore news: WWE News: Steve Austin Reveals Real-Life Vince McMahon Confrontation\n\"So I am more than willing, AEW, to talk about some stuff,\" she said, before adding a dose of reality. \"As far as I know, I don't think there's an interest from them, which is a shame. But I would love to go there.\"\nNewell signed with WWE in 2017, having runs in both NXT UK and NXT before being called up to the main roster in July 2021 as Shotzi's tag team partner. Plagued by significant injuries early in her WWE tenure, her career never reached the heights many had predicted.\nNow a free agent, Newell says her main goal is to get back in the ring consistently and prove what she can do. She also named ROH and TNA as other promotions on her \"bucket list.\"\n\"I want to wrestle everywhere and anywhere at this point,\" she affirmed. \"I gotta show people that I can do what I do best, and I just need the opportunity to be able to show people.\"\nNox is a talented wrestler who huch to offer to other promotions. Hopefully, she can find work soon.

      "text": "By: John Pollock & Brandon Thurston\nWWE will be adding a premium live event in September on the same day as AEW\u2019s All Out pay-per-view.\nPOST Wrestling spoke with multiple sources with knowledge of the WWE event schedule, who confirmed that a yet-to-be-announced PLE (premium live event) will take place on Saturday, September 20, in Indianapolis, Indiana.\nThe date coincides with AEW\u2019s All Out pay-per-view scheduled for the Scotiabank Arena in Toronto and represents the first time a WWE main roster PLE will air the same day as an AEW pay-per-view. We\u2019ve yet to confirm the start time of the WWE event. All Out is scheduled to begin its pay-per-view broadcast at 8 pm Eastern.\nWWE did not immediately respond to our request for comment.\nThroughout this year, NXT premium live events have been scheduled on the same day as AEW\u2019s Double or Nothing, All In Texas, and Forbidden Door shows.\nLast week, WWE announced two shows that weekend, with Friday Night SmackDown on September 19 in Toledo, Ohio, and Raw on September 22 in Evansville, Indiana.\nWe haven\u2019t confirmed the venue for the September 20 WWE event, but some recent main roster events in Indianapolis have been staged at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, which seems like a likely candidate.\nPaul Levesque is scheduled to speak next month at TEDSports Indianapolis, on September 9, 10 & 11 at the Old National Centre.\nIn June 2024, WWE announced a partnership with the Indiana Sports Corp, which began with this year\u2019s Royal Rumble event at Lucas Oil Stadium. The deal calls for a future two-night WrestleMania and SummerSlam at the stadium, as well as Raw, SmackDown, NXT, and WWE live events across the state."

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nA longtime WWE Superstar who has influenced countless wrestlers behind the scenes is retiring and calling it a career.\nAfter a remarkable 25-year career in professional wrestling, former NXT UK Women's Champion Meiko Satomura is preparing for her official retirement match, scheduled for April 29th in Tokyo, Japan, under the banner of her co-founded promotion, Sendai Girls' Pro Wrestling. The announced bout will be a tag team encounter.\nIt will see Satomura alongside her trainee, the 20-year-old Manami, against the duo of Aja Kong and Sendai Girls Champion Chihiro Hashimoto. This final match has a background as Satomura shares a storied history with both Kong, a rivalry spanning decades, and Hashimoto, against whom she has clashed in previous years.\nDespite this impending farewell match in Japan, Satomura remains listed on WWE's active roster and appears to still be involved in a coaching capacity for NXT. She maintained an in-ring presence for WWE in 2024 during the company's tour of Japan, with her last WWE match being a singles contest for the WWE Women's Championship against Bayley.\nMore news: WWE News: Steve Austin Reveals Real-Life Vince McMahon Confrontation\nHer final televised match under the WWE banner was against Roxanne Perez at NXT Roadblock in March 2023. Satomura's extensive career began in the mid-1990s, when she competed in WCW during its attempt to establish a women's division. She also won numerous championship victories across various promotions in Japan.\nShe participated in WWE's Mae Young Classic tournament in 2018, reaching the semifinals, and in mid-2019, she served as a guest coach at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando. That same year, Satomura also had the opportunity to train with then-SmackDown Women's Champion Sasha Banks at the Sendai Girls' dojo in Japan.\nWhile she has been officially signed with WWE since 2020, her in-ring appearances have become less frequent. She has since focused on her role with NXT and occasional appearances in Japan, including events like Fortune Dream 9 and DDT Pro Wrestling's unique Toden Train Match, before this final, career-culminating bout in her home promotion.\nMore WWE News:\n- WWE Superstar Reveals He Was Asked To Change Physical Appearance\n- WWE Has Big Plans for Alexa Bliss: Report\n- WWE Hall Of Famer Returns In Backstage Role\nFor more on WWE, head to Newsweek Sports.\nAbout the writer\nAndrew Ravens is a Newsweek reporter.
