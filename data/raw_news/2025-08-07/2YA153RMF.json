  "content": "Kremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov says a Trump-Putin meeting could happen as soon as next week.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are preparing to meet \u201cin the coming days\u201d, a Kremlin official has said, as a United States deadline for Russia to agree to a ceasefire in its war on Ukraine or face economic penalties approaches.\n\nKremlin adviser Yuri Ushakov said on Thursday that a Trump-Putin meeting could happen as early as next week. A location has been chosen, he added, though it would be revealed at a later stage.\n\n\u201cAt the request of the American side, both parties have effectively agreed to hold a high-level bilateral meeting in the coming days,\u201d Ushakov told reporters.\n\nThe announcement follows Trump\u2019s remarks on Wednesday that he was hopeful of holding a joint meeting with both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy \u201cvery soon\u201d. Trump has warned Moscow that unless a ceasefire is reached by Friday, it will face broader sanctions.\n\nUshakov said the prospect of a three-way summit came up during talks in Moscow with Trump\u2019s envoy, Steve Witkoff, who met Putin for the fifth time earlier this week. Russia offered no official comment on the potential trilateral meeting.\n\nZelenskyy signalled support for such a summit, writing on X that \u201cUkraine is not afraid of meetings and expects the same brave approach from the Russian side\u201d. He added that discussions had included \u201ctwo bilateral and one trilateral\u201d format, insisting Europe must be involved in efforts to end the war.\n\nDespite multiple visits to Moscow by Witkoff since Trump entered office in January after promising to end the war, no breakthrough has materialised. Trump acknowledged the lack of progress, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t call it a breakthrough \u2026 we have been working at this for a long time. There are thousands of young people dying \u2026 I\u2019m here to get the thing over with.\u201d\n\nThe Kremlin described Witkoff\u2019s latest discussions as \u201cconstructive\u201d and said both sides had exchanged \u201csignals\u201d, though it provided few specifics. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy confirmed he had spoken with Trump about the meeting, alongside European leaders.\n\nExpectations remain low that a peace deal will be reached before Trump\u2019s deadline. Russia continues to launch air strikes across Ukraine, and Moscow\u2019s conditions for ending the war, such as Kyiv\u2019s demilitarisation, neutrality and renunciation of NATO membership, remain non-starters for Ukraine and its Western allies.\n\nPutin also demands Ukrainian withdrawal from Russian-occupied regions, the formal recognition of Crimea, and the lifting of international sanctions. Kyiv has consistently rejected those terms.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House has approved an additional $200m military aid package for Ukraine, including support for drone manufacturing. And in a separate move, Trump signed an executive order on Wednesday imposing 25 percent tariffs on Indian imports over its ongoing purchases of Russian oil.",

      "text": "Why Trump\u2019s secondary tariffs on Russia could bite the US, its allies too\nChina and India would be hit hardest. But Europe would be affected, and the US would face risks as well.\nTop United States diplomatic negotiator Steve Witkoff visited Moscow on Wednesday in a last-ditch push to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to agree to a ceasefire with Ukraine before an August 8 deadline set by President Donald Trump.\nAfter Witkoff\u2019s meeting with Putin, the White House said that Russia had sought a meeting with Trump. The US president, the White House said, was open to meeting both Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nTrump, who during his re-election campaign had promised he would be able to end the Russia-Ukraine war in 24 hours if he came to power, has so far failed to mediate a truce despite months of hectic diplomacy, direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv, and phone calls with Putin.\nIncreasingly frustrated by Putin\u2019s unwillingness to agree to a pause in fighting without imposing conditions unacceptable to Ukraine or the West, Trump has threatened a new wave of economic measures punishing Russia if it does not accept a ceasefire.\nSince Russia\u2019s full-fledged invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US and its allies, including the United Kingdom and the European Union, have imposed more than 21,000 sanctions on Russia\u2019s economy.\nThe new tariffs Trump has threatened are unlike any of those earlier sanctions, however. They target Russia by hitting out against its trading partners, in the hope that they will stop buying from or selling to Moscow.\nBut these secondary tariffs also carry risks for the US and its allies.\nWhat are the secondary tariffs Trump is threatening?\nIn mid-July, as peace talks stalled despite Trump\u2019s efforts, the US president threatened Russia with 100 percent secondary tariffs if it did not work towards a ceasefire. He gave the Kremlin a 50-day deadline to cooperate.\nAfter Moscow suggested that it wouldn\u2019t bow to US pressure, Trump moved up the deadline, which now expires on August 8. It is unclear if Trump\u2019s openness to talks with Putin and Zelenskyy following Witkoff\u2019s Moscow visit has changed that deadline.\nOn Wednesday, Trump doubled the tariff rate on Indian imports from 25 percent \u2013 which he had announced in late July \u2013 to 50 percent, as punishment for New Delhi\u2019s refusal to stop buying Russian oil. That makes India the country facing the highest US tariffs at present \u2013 along with Brazil.\nIf Trump\u2019s secondary tariffs go into effect, goods that the US imports from countries still trading with Russia would face duties of 100 percent on top of the tariffs Trump has already imposed on those nations.\nThat would at least double the price of those products, making them less competitive in the US market.\nThe idea behind these tariffs is to persuade Russia\u2019s trading partners to stop buying and selling with the country, isolating its economy and depriving it of revenue it earns from exports, especially from energy.\nDespite the sanctions it already faces, Russia has consistently earned more than 500 million euros ($580m) a day from energy exports since 2022. That will be disrupted if countries stop buying all oil and gas from Russia.\nWhich countries could Trump\u2019s secondary tariffs hit?\nThe countries most affected by such secondary tariffs would be:\n- China: Russia\u2019s most important ally, China is by far the largest consumer of its northern neighbour\u2019s exports. In 2023, China bought almost a third of all Russian exports. It also bought almost half of Russia\u2019s oil exports.\n- India: An old friend, India has been buying up large volumes of Russian crude since 2022, including almost 40 percent of Russia\u2019s total oil exports in 2023. That year, 17 percent of Russia\u2019s overall exports went to India. Trump had already imposed a 25 percent tariff on Indian goods. On Wednesday, he doubled that rate as punishment for India\u2019s continued oil purchases from Russia.\n- Turkiye: The third-largest buyer of Russian energy, 8 percent of Russia\u2019s exports in 2023 went to Turkiye. It is a NATO ally of the US.\nTurkiye isn\u2019t the only ally that could be hit if Trump truly targets all those who trade with Russia.\nCould US allies be hit?\nPushing back against Western threats over its ties with Russia, India has pointed to the EU\u2019s own trade with Moscow. And while that trade has plummeted since 2022, it is still substantial.\nAccording to the EU, its total trade with Russia was worth 67.5 billion euros ($77.9bn) in 2024. India\u2019s total trade with Russia in 2024-25, by contrast, was worth $68.7bn.\nThe bloc still relies heavily on Russia for its liquefied natural gas (LNG) supplies. In fact, its import of Russian LNG has been rising: In 2024, EU imports of Russian LNG were 9 percent higher than the year before.\nEurope has already been hit with a 15 percent tariff from Trump. Will Trump punish his closest supporters to pressure Russia to end the war?\nCould the US face risks, too?\nIt is not just allies \u2013 secondary tariffs on those who trade with Russia carry risks for the US itself, too.\nTrump\u2019s team is currently working on a trade deal with China, and those talks have led to a pause in a tariff war between the world\u2019s two largest economies.\nThat detente would break down if Trump imposes 100 percent tariffs on Chinese goods simply because Beijing also trades with Russia.\nChina, Europe and India are all major suppliers of goods to the US: If the cost of those products \u2013 from clothes to lamps to iPhones \u2013 doubles, American consumers will feel the pinch.\nThe US also buys chemicals, including uranium hexafluoride \u2013 used in uranium enrichment \u2013 from Russia.\nWill India and China stop buying Russian energy?\nThat looks unlikely. China continues to buy oil from Iran, despite US sanctions \u2013 and Russia is arguably its closest strategic partner.\nIndia has also shown no sign of loosening its ties with Russia. Witkoff isn\u2019t the only foreign envoy visiting Moscow at the moment. India\u2019s national security adviser, Ajit Doval, is also in the Russian capital. India\u2019s foreign minister, S Jaishankar, is expected to visit Russia later this month, and India has announced that it intends to host Putin later this year.\nOn Wednesday, India described Trump\u2019s 50 percent tariff as \u201cunfair, unjustified and unreasonable\u201d, adding that its purchase of Russian oil was rooted in its desire for energy security for its 1.4 billion people."

Trump answered vaguely but favourably.\n\u201cWell, there\u2019s a very good prospect that they will, and we haven\u2019t determined where, but we had some very good talks with President Putin today. And there\u2019s a very good chance that we could be ending the round, ending the end of that road,\u201d Trump said in somewhat rambling remarks.\n\u201c There\u2019s a good chance that there will be a meeting very soon.\u201d\nHowever, when pressed whether a ceasefire deal was on the horizon, Trump expressed less optimism.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been disappointed before with this one,\u201d he replied.\nThe US president has previously said that he is committed to helping bring the war in Ukraine to an end. He initially promised to stop the conflict on \u201cday one\u201d of his presidency, but has struggled to make progress. The statement comes after US envoy Steve Witkoff visited Moscow to speak with Russian officials earlier today.\nIn a social media post, Trump said Witkoff held a \u201chighly productive\u201d meeting with Putin and that \u201cgreat progress was made!\u201d\n\u201cAfterwards, I updated some of our European Allies. Everyone agrees this War must come to a close, and we will work towards that in the days and weeks to come,\u201d he added.\nThe New York Times reported that Trump intends to meet first with Putin before later setting up a meeting that would also include Zelenskyy.\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said in a TV interview that the US now has a better understanding of what conditions would be required for Russia to end the war.\n\u201cFor the first time perhaps since this administration began, we have some concrete examples of the kinds of things that Russia would ask for in order to end the war,\u201d Rubio said in an interview with Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cKudlow,\u201d adding that questions of territory would be a key part of any deal.\nThe news agency AFP reported that Trump also discussed the possibility of such a meeting during a phone call with Zelenskyy, citing an anonymous Ukrainian source. That call is also said to have included NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and the leaders of Britain, Germany and Finland.\nTrump has recently mulled steps to further increase pressure on Russia, which he has accused of not being sincerely interested in ending the war. Such steps could include heightened US sanctions."

But the official also said the US is still expected to impose secondary sanctions against Russia on Friday, after a 10-day deadline imposed by Trump expires.\nShortly after the meeting, Trump released an executive order imposing an additional 25 percent tariff on goods from India, for importing Russian oil. The announcement stated that the \u201cactions and policies of the Government of the Russian Federation continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States\u201d.\nUkraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he discussed Witkoff\u2019s visit with Trump Wednesday. \u201cUkraine will definitely defend its independence. We all need a lasting and reliable peace. Russia must end the war that it itself started,\u201d Zelenskyy said on X, confirming that European leaders had also joined the call with Trump.\n\u201cIt seems that Russia is now more inclined to a ceasefire. The pressure on them works. But the main thing is that they do not deceive us in the details \u2013 neither us nor the US,\u201d Zelenskyy added in his nightly address.\nWhen reporters asked Trump on Monday what Witkoff\u2019s message would be to Moscow, and if there was anything Russia could do to avoid the sanctions, Trump replied, \u201cYeah, get a deal where people stop getting killed.\u201d\nWitkoff, a real estate billionaire, has had several long meetings with Putin. He had no diplomatic experience before joining Trump\u2019s team in January, and critics have portrayed him as ill-equipped for such tasks.\nThree previous rounds of peace talks in Turkiye\u2019s Istanbul in an attempt to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine have failed to make headway.\nPutin, who has consistently rejected calls for a ceasefire, said on Friday that he wants peace but that his demands for ending the nearly three-and-a-half-year offensive were unchanged. Moscow has demanded that Ukraine cede more territory and renounce Western support, including seeking NATO membership.\nKyiv is calling for an immediate ceasefire, and Zelenskyy last week urged his allies to push for \u201cregime change\u201d in Moscow.\nRussia continues attacks\nIn Ukraine overnight, Russian forces hit a recreational centre in Ukraine\u2019s southern Zaporizhia region, killing two people and injuring 12, including two children, regional Governor Ivan Fedorov said on Wednesday.\nRussian forces launched at least four strikes on the area and initially attacked with powerful glide bombs.\n\u201cThere is zero military sense in this strike. Only cruelty to intimidate,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram.\nRussia also struck the Ukrainian power grid and heating gas facilities in Ukraine\u2019s southern Odesa region, which are used in a scheme to import liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the US and Azerbaijan, undermining preparations for winter, Ukrainian officials said.\n\u201cThis was a deliberate blow to our preparations for the heating season, absolutely cynical, like every Russian blow to the energy sector,\u201d Zelenskyy said on Telegram."
