A team of certified security staff flew in from Denmark to take charge.\"We know that Wednesday's closure of Security in Nuuk has been a major inconvenience for both airlines and the affected travelers,\" the airport operator said. \"We deeply regret this, and we are working intensively to ensure a good experience at our airport.\"Meanwhile, United Flight 81, from Nuuk to Newark, was canceled on Wednesday. It was scheduled to use the same 737 Max that turned around, per Flightradar24.United only operates the route twice a week, limiting options for passengers in Nuuk to make it to the US.The airline told The Points Guy that it was planning to operate Saturday's flight to Nuuk as planned.It's also waiving change fees for flights to or from Nuuk between Tuesday and Sunday.
