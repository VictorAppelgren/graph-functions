It\u2019s like a franchise: different companies with different approaches, but using common editorial standards and all publishing into the same system.\n- The core purpose of the LDRS is to provide impartial coverage of the regular business and workings of local authorities in the UK, and other relevant democratic institutions such as mayoralties, combined authority areas, P&CCs, quangos, etc.\n- The Local Democracy Reporters' (LDRs) brief is to report on the decision-making process: what decisions are made in the public's name and how they are arrived at, what evidence is presented to the council, etc.\n- The expectation is that LDRs shall endeavour to attend all meetings in person.\n- In two-tier council areas the LDRs should cover district council affairs sufficiently to ensure that significant decisions (eg planning) are reported.\n- LDRs may provide other stories which are focused on local democracy and which are in the public interest so long as that does not detract from the core purpose of the service.\n- All their work must be available to all qualifying partners.\n- National politics is out of scope, but election campaigns and constituency work of MPs, AMs, MSPs and MLAs that specifically relates to relevant local audiences may be covered so long as it does not detract from the core purpose of the LDRS.\nLDRs report to the contract holder, not to the BBC or any other partner.\nWith the guidance and support of the contract holder, LDRs work to the brief covering the stories of greatest public interest and they should not undertake commissions for any partner.\nDirect questions and clarifications relating to content are acceptable, but any suggestions or comments relating to the service should go through a LDR's manager.\nThe only difference between the BBC and others is that it has a right to request interviews or 2-ways for BBC Local Radio. Depending on workload and commitments it is up to each LDR to decide whether or not to agree.\nNo. While meeting the highest standards of accuracy and impartiality, written content may conform to an employer's normal style. BBC training will help create a common standard for media content production.\n- All content must be created for all qualifying partners.\n- Content should be published as soon as possible after a meeting or event.\n- All content must be published using the LDRS Authoring Tool so all partners see it simultaneously.\n- All content must be titled COUNCIL NAME: Story Name.\n- It must be tagged with at least one top-tier local authority, but can have as many tags as are relevant.\n- Images and media must have a descriptive label.\n- Images and media must be rights-free (LDRs should not use their employer\u2019s picture library, or images supplied by agencies or freelance contributors).\n- LDRs should, where possible, assign a \"Feature Image\" to a story.\n- LDRs must provide an Advisory note in the publishing system before the end of every week indicating their diary for the next seven days (or longer).\n- LDRs should source their content. An explanatory Note to Editors at the end of a story regarding the source will reduce queries from partners, especially around whether qualified privilege applies to all or part of a story.\n- LDRs should not file a story based on a press release already in the public domain unless it has been significantly developed with new quotes or information.\n- Embargoed content must explain why publication should be delayed.\n- Posts should be via LDRs' personal accounts rather than contractors' branded accounts.\n- LDRs are encouraged to post an Advisory in the LDRS Authoring Tool to let partners know if they intend live-Tweeting from a meeting, for example.\n- Tagging #LDReporter will help the partnership collate relevant tweets.\n- LDRs should be credited as \"First Name, Last Name, Local Democracy Reporter\".\n- By-lines or references within copy are acceptable.\n- Broadcasters should acknowledge LDRs when they appear on air or when the format allows.\n- Shared credit with other reporters is acceptable if LDRs' content is copied, edited or incorporated into new pieces of work.\n- The LDRS logo can also be used in print, online or on TV, but is not compulsory.\n- LDRs should refer to themselves as \"Local Democracy Reporters\", not \"BBC Local Democracy Reporters\" in all forms of communication, including social media profiles.\n- Corrections and clarifications relating to previously published stories must be clearly highlighted and issued immediately.\n- The headline style should be as follows: 'COUNCIL NAME: Story Name - CORRECTION'.\n- The first paragraph of the body copy should be as follows: 'CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that\u2026'."

      "text": "Padel: 'I want to play the sport but I can't afford it'\n- Published\nA shorter racket, a smaller court and an underarm serve.\nPadel tennis is one of the fastest-growing sports in the world, thanks to its basic skill level and social nature.\nAs demand grows, the number of venues isn't going up, but the cost of playing is.\nAccording to the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), there are currently around 800 padel courts in Britain, but over 400,000 players.\nResearch by Ray Algar, an expert on the economics of sport and exercise, shows that the average off-peak court hire in the UK is about \u00a330, but peak time prices can reach \u00a380 at some venues.\n'I sometimes take a month off'\nRosie Hepworth got into padel about a year ago after seeing the sport on social media.\nThe rise of the racquet sport - usually played in doubles on an enclosed court where balls can be played off the walls - has been helped by influencers and celebrity players such as Stormzy.\nBut that popularity has driven up the price for players such as Rosie.\n\"I can't afford to play regularly,\" she tells BBC Newsbeat. \"It definitely slows down how much I can improve.\"\nThe trainee accountant only gets on the courts every few weeks and says her budget means she spends an average of \u00a330 a month on padel, but has spent up to \u00a370 before.\n\"If I have other financial commitments, then I might take a month off,\" she says.\nWhen Rosie's friends could no longer afford the high cost, she started playing in a league with strangers as a third or fourth player.\nShe says these open matches work out cheaper, and increase the number of available games.\n\"In central London, it's hard to find a court that is free,\" she says.\n\"They are so booked up that you have to book at least a week in advance.\"\nRosie cycles up to 50 minutes away from her home to courts that are almost half the price and quieter at peak times.\n\"I find it frustrating to have to travel so far for affordable courts,\" the 24-year-old says.\n\"But it's just about worth it because it's become a hobby I really enjoy.\"\nStudent Barnaby Stephenson took up the sport about two years ago and helped to found the University of Edinburgh's first padel club.\nThe 21-year-old says the city has fewer courts than others and getting to and from practices means a two-hour round-trip, which he describes as a \"struggle\".\nBarnaby's club had provided free balls and rackets to new members and charged just \u00a32 per session, but the society had to stop offering social memberships due to \"unprecedented demand\".\nBarnaby wants to see more grassroots investment in state schools and public parks to make the sport more accessible.\n\"There needs to be more pressure and focus on developing padel in every community, rather than concentrating on middle-class areas,\" he says.\nWhere are the courts?\nThe BBC asked all of the local councils in the UK if they had put money into providing padel facilities.\nOf the 330 that responded, only three said that they had.\nWhile the LTA has spent more than \u00a36m on the sport, this only accounts for 10% of all padel courts nationwide.\nMany of the rest are independently owned, driving up booking costs and increasing the number of private members' clubs.\nWe also tracked where courts were located across Britain using data from The Padel Directory, and found that most were in the wealthiest areas, with the highest numbers in the south of England.\nIn other countries it's a very different picture.\n\"We're one of the last nations in Europe to catch this padel wave,\" says Tom Murray, the LTA's head of padel.\nAs the organisation that looks after padel in the UK, the LTA has launched a new five-year strategy that aims to work with local authorities to build more courts.\nIt hopes to increase accessibility as other countries have done.\n\"In Spain it started as that premium elitist sport, but now it's far from it - it's second to football in terms of participation.\"\nMadrid will host this year's Euro Padel Cup in July - with a record 40 nations taking part.\nIt's an event Team GB players Catherine Rose and Nikhil Mohindra are training for.\nBritish number two Catherine began playing three years ago and recalls \"driving around the country\" to find opponents.\nIt was a different story for Nikhil, who says he was lucky enough to have a friend nearby he could practise with.\n\"I don't know how I would've played otherwise,\" the 22-year-old says.\nBoth want to boost participation. Catherine says there are fewer female players in the UK, and Nikhil thinks efforts could be made to improve diversity.\nHe says he's seen how diverse the sport can be during his visits to India as a padel ambassador.\n\"When I go there, I see courts being used 24 hours a day by everyone,\" he says.\n\"Anyone from any background can play - it's about opening up more courts in ethnic minority areas.\"\nTanaya Lai, who began playing tennis at four years old, says she's used to being \"surrounded by white people\".\nIt's something she's noticed since joining the University of Plymouth's padel team, but doesn't see it as a barrier.\n\"I am happy to be an Asian woman in sport,\" she says.\n\"Asian women need to know that they aren't excluded from these spaces and they can join if they want to.\"\nHowever, the 22-year-old does think that there are other obstacles.\n\"It's viewed as a posh, more upper-class sport because of how expensive courts are,\" she says. \"There need to be more public and cheaper courts.\"\nLike Rosie and Barnaby, Tanaya cannot afford to play padel as regularly as she would like and feels it has hindered her progress.\n\"I only really play league matches because it is expensive to just book a court and play for an hour or two,\" she explains.\n\"Otherwise I'd be able to play more.\"\nAdditional reporting by Lauren Woodhead"

Eight parking bays would be equipped with electric vehicle charging points.\nIt would operate from 7am to 10pm on weekdays and 8am to 9pm at weekends.\nThe application is currently under consideration by Rotherham Council's planning department.\nGet in touch\nTell us which stories we should cover in Yorkshire\nListen to highlights from South Yorkshire on BBC Sounds, catch up with the latest episode of Look North\nRelated topics\nRelated stories\n- Published14 July\n- Published24 July"
