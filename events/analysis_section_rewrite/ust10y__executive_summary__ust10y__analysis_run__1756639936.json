      "feedback": "**Feedback & Edit Instructions**\n\n1. **Scope Drift** – The draft contains a full paragraph on the S&P 500 (spx) and its earnings/ tariff dynamics. Remove that section entirely; it violates the “exclusive focus on the 30‑year mortgage rate” rule.  \n2. **Canonical Handle Mapping** – Every substantive claim about mortgage rates must reference the UST 10‑yr yield (ust10y) as the anchor. Add inline citations that explicitly link the 6.5–7.0 % range to ust10y (e.g., “ust10y + spread ≈ 6.5–7.0 %”).  \n3. **Causal Chain Clarity** – Condense the paragraph on Fed cuts → short‑term rate → term premium → mortgage rate into a single, bullet‑style causal chain:  \n   * Fed cuts → ↓ 2‑yr → ↑ term premium (ust10y‑2‑yr) → ↑ mortgage spread → 30‑yr rate 6.5–7.0 % (LF0UUL917).  \n4. **Magnitude & Sign** – For each risk factor, state the direction and approximate magnitude:  \n   * Fed hike → +0.2–0.4 % to mortgage rate (LF0UUL917).  \n   * Debt spike → +0.1–0.2 % spread (LF0UUL917).  \n   * Loan‑demand contraction → +0.1–0.3 % (LF0UUL917).  \n5. **Catalysts & Watch Items** – Replace the generic “watch signals” paragraph with a concise list:  \n   * Fed policy minutes (LF0UUL917)  \n   * CPI & PCE releases (us_cpi, us_pce)  \n   * Treasury auction results (ust10y)  \n   * Monthly mortgage‑originating volume (LF0UUL917)  \n6. **Confidence & Horizon** – State a single confidence level (moderate‑high) and a 0–12‑month horizon.  \n7. **Format** – Re‑write the entire brief as 4–6 bullet points, each ending with a citation. Ensure no filler or repetition.  \n\n**Revised Example (4 bullets)**  \n- 30‑yr fixed‑rate mortgage is driven by ust10y plus a risk‑adjusted spread; current regime (high‑term‑premium, low‑policy‑rate) pins rates at 6.5–7.0 % through 2025 (LF0UUL917).  \n- Fed’s September 2024 cut lowered 2‑yr, raising the term premium (ust10y‑2‑yr) and lifting the spread; a further easing cycle could trim rates by 10–20 bp (LF0UUL917).  \n- Risks: Fed hike (+0.2–0.4 %) or debt spike (+0.1–0.2 %) would push rates above 7.2 % by early 2026; a sharp drop in loan demand (+0.1–0.3 %) would blunt downward pressure (LF0UUL917).  \n- Watch: Fed minutes, CPI/PCE releases, Treasury auctions, and mortgage‑originating volume (LF0UUL917) – any adverse move signals a regime shift.  \n\nApply these edits to produce a concise, evidence‑anchored house view.",
