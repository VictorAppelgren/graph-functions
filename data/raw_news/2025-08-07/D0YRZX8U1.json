  "description": "Fight over Trump's order to deny birthright citizenship heads toward Supreme Court, with 14th Amendment protections at stake",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice has released an update confirming that it plans to ask the Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of President Donald Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship.\n\nThe announcement was disclosed in a joint status report filed Wednesday, August 6, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.\n\nThe Justice Department's plan to seek a Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of President Donald Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship\u2014entitled \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship\"\u2014marks a critical juncture in the national debate over immigration and constitutional rights.\n\nSigned on January 20, 2025, it directs the federal government to deny citizenship documents to children born in the U.S. to undocumented or temporary immigrant parents.\n\nAt stake is the interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which has long been understood to guarantee citizenship to nearly all individuals born on U.S. soil. A ruling in favor of the order could reshape federal authority over citizenship, impact millions of U.S.-born children, and redefine the limits of executive power\u2014making this one of the most consequential legal battles in recent memory.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nOn February 6, 2025, the district court in Seattle issued a nationwide preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of President Trump's executive order.\n\nThe case under review, State of Washington v. Trump, was just one of several ongoing legal challenges in which lower courts have largely rejected the administration's legal theory. District courts in Maryland (February 5), New Hampshire (February 10), and Massachusetts (February 13), have each upheld that the order conflicted with constitutional protections and halted its enforcement in their respective jurisdictions.\n\nOne of those judges, U.S. District Judge Leo Sorokin, an appointee of former President Barack Obama who sits on the federal bench in Boston, granted a nationwide preliminary injunction, affirming that the constitutional guarantee of citizenship applies broadly, and finding the policy to be, \"unconstitutional and contrary to a federal statute.\"\n\nThe government appealed the ruling and sought partial stays from the district court, the Ninth Circuit, and the Supreme Court. After the Supreme Court denied a partial stay, the Ninth Circuit requested further briefing and, on July 23, upheld the injunction.\n\nThe new update came in a joint status report filed August 6, 2025, in which the DOJ stated that Solicitor General D. John Sauer intends to file a petition \"expeditiously\" for certiorari\u2014a legal term that refers to the process by which a higher court (most commonly the U.S. Supreme Court), agrees to review a lower court's decision\u2014in order to place the case before the Court during its next term, which begins in October.\n\nThis means the Justice Department has now formally indicated it will seek a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of President Trump's executive order; though it has not yet chosen which specific case\u2014or combination of ongoing cases\u2014it will use as the basis for its appeal.\n\nThe parties plan to update the court further once those appellate steps are finalized.\n\nSince the adoption of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution on July 9, 1868, the citizenship of persons born in the United States has been controlled by its Citizenship Clause, which states: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" Courts have consistently upheld this principle for more than a century, most notably in the 1898 Supreme Court case United States v. Wong Kim Ark.\n\nHowever, the Trump administration argues that the amendment should not apply to children of parents who lack permanent legal status, a position that has been repeatedly rejected by lower courts.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nPresident Trump, during an interview with NBC's Meet the Press, December 8, 2024, said: \"Do you know if somebody sets a foot\u2014just a foot, one foot, you don't need two\u2014on our land, 'Congratulations you are now a citizen of the United States of America,' \u2026 Yes, we're going to end that, because it's ridiculous.\" Adding: \"...we're going to have to get it changed. We'll maybe have to go back to the people, but we have to end it. \u2026 We're the only country that has it, you know.\"\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi told reporters in June 2025: \"Birthright citizenship will be decided in October, in the next session by the Supreme Court.\"\n\nDOJ attorneys wrote in the filing: \"In light of the Ninth Circuit's decision, Defendants represent that the Solicitor General plans to seek certiorari expeditiously to enable the Supreme Court to settle the lawfulness of the Citizenship Order next Term.\"\n\nJessica Levinson, constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School, said: \"You can't 'executive order' your way out of the Constitution. If you want to end birthright citizenship, you need to amend the Constitution, not issue an executive order.\"\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe Justice Department must decide which case or combination of cases it will use to challenge lower court rulings and bring the birthright citizenship issue before the Supreme Court. Once it makes that decision, the DOJ will file a petition for certiorari.\n\nThe Court is not required to accept every petition, but because this involves a major constitutional question, it is likely to grant review. If that happens, the Court could hear arguments in 2026 and issue a ruling by June of that year.\n\nFor now, the Justice Department and attorneys representing plaintiff states\u2014including Washington, Arizona, Illinois, and Oregon\u2014have agreed to submit another update once the appellate process is clarified or if further proceedings in the district court are required. Until then, the order remains unenforceable, lower court rulings blocking Trump's executive order remain in effect, and current birthright citizenship protections continue to apply.",

  "argos_summary": "The U.S. Department of Justice plans to seek a Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of President Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, which has faced legal challenges and injunctions from lower courts. The order, signed in January 2025, seeks to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented or temporary immigrant parents, raising significant constitutional questions regarding the 14th Amendment. The DOJ intends to file a petition for certiorari to expedite the case's review, with potential arguments to be heard in 2026.",
