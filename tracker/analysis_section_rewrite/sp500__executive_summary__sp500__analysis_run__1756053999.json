      "feedback": "Actionable edit plan: compress the Ford portion into a 4–6 sentence, executive house view centered on a first‑principles causal chain (macro demand → unit volumes → fixed cost/EV capex → EV profitability → ROIC vs WACC → valuation), removing or relegating broader AI/consumer/snippet sections to a brief “watchlist” to avoid dilution; tighten the balance by anchoring every assertion to the cited numbers (Q2 EV losses ~$1.3B; adj. EBIT ~4.3%; ROIC ~10%; up to $50B EV capex through 2026 with a pause of up to $12B; forward P/E ~10x; dividend yield ~5%), and present a base case of 2–3 years of continued EV losses with a 3–5+ year path to meaningful FCF uplift; define an explicit regime framework with a two‑quarters EV EBIT breakeven condition and disciplined capex pacing as the trigger for re‑rating, plus a clear invalidation set (sustained EV losses widening beyond threshold or ROIC failing vs WACC with cash‑flow headroom eroded); articulate 3–5 watch items that are Ford‑specific (EV profitability readouts, cadence of EV capex, dividend coverage, ROIC vs WACC, and macro tariff/policy signals) and present them as tight bullets; ensure consistency of horizon/style across the piece by adopting one base‑case horizon (2–3 years) and a separate longer‑horizon uplift narrative, reconcile any conflicts by privileging the Ford‑specific profitability/FCF framework over ancillary cross‑asset macro lists, and place all Ford assertions with the relevant source IDs (22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW, 65UUBU0OR, 22PL3Q360, I2SJU04DF, NBX9RA9WX, U3ZK13ZQI, STBVARD8F, 2YP1X9B4T, YX2J8NHZ1) to maintain citation density and coherence.",
