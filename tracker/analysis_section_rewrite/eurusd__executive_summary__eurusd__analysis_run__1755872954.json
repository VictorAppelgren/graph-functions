      "feedback": "The analysis draft demonstrates a solid understanding of the macroeconomic landscape but could benefit from enhanced clarity and conciseness. To elevate it to world-class quality, streamline the content to focus on the most critical insights, ensuring each sentence adds unique value without redundancy. Strengthen the causal chains by explicitly linking inflation to specific consumer behaviors and corporate impacts, avoiding overly general statements. Integrate more precise quantitative forecasts and specific catalysts, such as anticipated Federal Reserve actions or key economic indicators, to ground the analysis in actionable insights. Ensure that the geopolitical context is succinctly tied to market implications, particularly regarding energy prices and investor sentiment. Lastly, maintain a high citation density, ensuring all claims are backed by relevant sources while reconciling any conflicting information. Aim for a tighter structure that aligns with the professional investor brief format, limiting the analysis to 4–6 bullet points or sentences that encapsulate the key takeaways.",
