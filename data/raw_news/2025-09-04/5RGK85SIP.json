  "description": "Fownes Hotel in Worcester has been the centre of protests this summer after locals became concerned about migrants living there.",
  "content": "A Labour-run council is under fire for allowing a historic hotel to house more than 100 asylum seekers unlawfully. Fownes Hotel in Worcester has been the centre of protests this summer after locals became concerned about migrants living there. It has emerged the hotel, a former 19th century glove factory, was never granted planning permission to house asylum seekers. Planning permission is required for a \u201cmaterial change of use\u201d from a hotel to a hostel. However, no application has been made by the hotel's owners - Border Equity Investments Limited - for such a change of use. Despite breaking planning law, Worcester City Council has not enforced the breach, instead saying it was \"considering where public interest lies.\"\n\nThere are also questions over the legality of the hotel adding 20 extra rooms last year. The council approved it on the basis the hotel, which used to charged guests \u00a3155-a-night, was expanding. It has now emerged the council\u2019s Communities Committee discussed plans to house 143 asylum seekers at The Fownes in November 2022. It means the council should not have approved plans for a hotel expansion when it was known the Fownes was being used as a hostel. Seven people were arrested after anti-immigration protesters clashed with anti-racism campaigners during a demonstration outside the hotel last month. The Home Office has remained tight-lipped about how many asylum seekers are living at The Fownes. Worcester City Council said it would not comment on how many people were at the hotel.\n\nResponding to why the council has never enforced the planning breach, a council spokesman said: \"Over a period of time we have been keeping a watching brief on the activities at the Fownes Hotel and have given due consideration to where public interest lies and whether there has been any adverse impact on the amenity of the site or the surrounding area. \"We will always act in a proportionate manner and have due regard to the potential impact of those affected by any proposed action.\" The council also confirmed the planning application for the additional rooms was made on the basis of the building being used as a hotel. A council spokesman said: \"The planning application and the supporting documentation submitted in December 2023 clearly stated that the existing use of the building was as a hotel and that the proposed extra rooms were for the same use.\u201d More than a dozen councils in the UK are planning legal action to shut asylum seeker hotels. Reform-run West Northamptonshire Council (WNC) is serving Planning Contravention Notices to the owners of three asylum hotels. The move comes despite Epping Forest District Council losing a legal bid to force migrants to leave The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex.",
