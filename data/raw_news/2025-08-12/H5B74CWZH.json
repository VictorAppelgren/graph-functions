  "title": "$34.5B Google Chrome Purchase Offer Shocker From AI Startup",
  "description": "Many see Perplexity\u2019s bid to buy Google\u2019s Chrome browser as a strategic statement rather than a likely transaction.",
  "content": "AI-powered search startup Perplexity has made an audacious $34.5 billion offer to buy Google\u2019s Chrome browser, a bid that far exceeds the company\u2019s own $18 billion valuation.\n\nThe unsolicited proposal comes as Google faces mounting pressure from US regulators to loosen its grip on the search market. Last year, a federal judge ruled that Google illegally monopolized online search, and the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has suggested that selling Chrome could help level the playing field.\n\nPerplexity confirmed to The Wall Street Journal that multiple large venture capital funds have agreed to finance the deal in full. The startup said the proposal is \u201cdesigned to satisfy an antitrust remedy in highest public interest by placing Chrome with a capable, independent operator,\u201d per The Journal\u2019s report.\n\nEstimates of Chrome\u2019s market value range between $20 billion and $50 billion, making Perplexity\u2019s $34.5 billion bid a competitive, though still ambitious, offer.\n\nThe offer lands at a delicate time for Google. US District Judge Amit Mehta is reviewing potential remedies after ruling last year that the search giant illegally monopolized the online search market. One option under consideration is forcing Google to divest Chrome.\n\nIn a filing, the DOJ said divesting Chrome would \u201cpermanently stop Google\u2019s control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet.\u201d\n\nChrome is no small asset; the browser has roughly 3.5 billion users and dominates more than 60% of the global market, according to industry estimates. Judge Mehta is expected to announce his decision this month.\n\nBrowsers have become key battlegrounds in the AI era; they not only control access to search traffic but also generate valuable user data for advertising and personalization. Both OpenAI and Yahoo have reportedly expressed interest in Chrome should it hit the market.\n\nGoogle has given no indication it\u2019s willing to sell Chrome. In earlier testimony, Google CEO Sundar Pichai argued that being forced to divest the browser or share data with rivals would \u201charm Google\u2019s business\u201d and pose \u201csecurity risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that [Judge Mehta] would hold off on requiring a sale until the appeals process is worked out,\u201d Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, told Reuters.\n\nMany see Perplexity\u2019s bid as a strategic statement rather than a likely transaction, aimed at signaling to the court and the public that a motivated buyer exists if regulators demand a sale. Such a public offer also keeps Perplexity in the spotlight at a time when AI firms are vying for influence, partnerships, and market share.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Perplexity has made a high-profile acquisition attempt. Earlier this year, the startup reportedly explored a merger with TikTok amid concerns over the app\u2019s Chinese ownership.\n\nPerplexity has also been expanding its own products, recently launching an AI-powered browser called Comet. But acquiring Chrome would instantly give it access to billions of users, something that could supercharge its competition with AI rivals like OpenAI.\n\nDuring Google\u2019s antitrust trial, ChatGPT product lead Nick Turley stated OpenAI would be interested in buying Chrome and creating an \u201cAI-first\u201d browsing experience.",
