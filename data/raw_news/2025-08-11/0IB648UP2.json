  "description": "The Senate has approved President Trump's nomination of Terrance Cole as DEA administrator as the agency weighs a proposal to reclassify cannabis under federal drug laws.",
  "content": "The U.S. Senate this week confirmed President Donald Trump\u2019s nomination of Terrance Cole as administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration. Senators confirmed the nomination on Tuesday by a vote of 50-47 as a proposal to reclassify cannabis under federal drug laws awaits action from the DEA.\n\nCole served as the Virginia Secretary of Public Safety from 2023 to 2025 after serving in the DEA for more than two decades. In March, Trump nominated Cole as DEA administrator, pending confirmation in the Senate.\n\nCole\u2019s confirmation as DEA administrator comes as the agency is weighing a bid began by the Biden administration to reclassify cannabis under federal drug laws. Under the , marijuana would be removed from Schedule I of the federal Controlled Substances Act and placed in Schedule III, a move that would ease research into cannabis. Rescheduling would also likely benefit cannabis companies that are barred from taking advantage of most tax deductions for business expenses.\n\nCole has said that reviewing the proposal to reschedule cannabis \u201cone of my first priorities\u201d if confirmed as DEA administrator, according to a from online cannabis news source Marijuana Moment. He declined, however, to indicate his views on the proposal.\n\nFollowing Cole\u2019s confirmation, cannabis industry organizations and executives were quick to call on the new DEA head to approve the proposal to reschedule cannabis, which has been since January because of procedural delays. Aaron Smith of the National Cannabis Industry Association sent a letter to Cole following his Senate confirmation, calling on the new DEA administrator to approve the pending proposal to reclassify cannabis under federal drug laws.\n\n\u201cThe rescheduling process under the previous administration was unnecessarily protracted and fraught by allegations of malfeasance within DEA and we look forward to your renewed leadership to expedite this process and fulfill President Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u2018unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule III drug\u2019 and ultimately \u2018implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults, to safe, tested product,\u2019\u201d Smith wrote in the cited by Marijuana Moment.\n\n\u201cAs such, we strongly encourage your office to continue advancing the cannabis rescheduling process in a timely and transparent manner,\u201d Smith continued. \u201cRescheduling would help eliminate unnecessary barriers to research, reduce burdens on legitimate businesses operating under state law, and bring federal policy more in line with overwhelming public opinion and decades of state-level reform.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs DEA considers next steps, we respectfully urge your administration to recognize the importance of collaboration with stakeholders who can offer real-world insights into the public health, enforcement, and operational impacts of federal cannabis policy,\u201d the letter adds. \u201cNCIA and our members welcome any opportunity to be constructive partners in that effort.\u201d\n\nTerry Mendez, CEO of Safe Harbor Financial, a firm that provides banking services to cannabis businesses, said that with \u201cthe rescheduling of cannabis under federal law stalled, the incoming DEA leadership will play a defining role in whether that reform moves forward\u2014or remains mired in uncertainty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we welcome Terry Cole\u2019s stated commitment to reviewing the rescheduling proposal, the industry needs more than vague assurances,\u201d Mendez wrote in an emailed statement. \u201cWe need regulatory clarity, fairness and above all, urgency. The decisions ahead will directly impact the viability of thousands of licensed cannabis operators and the broader financial infrastructure supporting them.\u201d",

      "text": "A Drug Enforcement Administration judge has cancelled a hearing to consider the Biden administration\u2019s proposal to reclassify marijuana under federal drug laws amid allegations that officials at the agency have conferred with witnesses opposed to the plan. Administrative Law Judge John Mulrooney canceled the hearing that was set for January 21, extending the process to ease restrictions on cannabis for at least three months, online weed news source Marijuana Moment reported on Monday afternoon.\nThe DEA hearing was scheduled to evaluate a proposal from the Department of Health and Human Services to change the classification of marijuana under the CSA from Schedule I, the strictest category, to Schedule III. Such a move would be significant for the state-legal cannabis industry, which would no longer be denied standard business tax deductions and would gain easier access to banking services.\nOn Monday, Mulrooney ruled on a motion from cannabis policy reform advocates who were scheduled to testify as witnesses at the now-canceled hearing. In the motion, the witnesses alleged that the DEA had made improper communications with groups opposed to proposed rule change to reschedule cannabis and that DEA Administrator Anne Milgram had improperly selected witnesses for the hearing. Although he denied a request to remove the agency from the proceedings, Mulrooney granted a request for leave to file an interlocutory appeal, canceling next week\u2019s hearing and staying the process for at least three months.\nJudge Cites \u2018Disturbing And Embarrassing Revelations\u2019\nIn his ruling on Monday, Mulrooney noted a \u201cdisturbing and embarrassing revelation\u201d about claims of communications between DEA officials and groups opposed to marijuana policy reform. However, he said that even if the allegations are true, they do not amount to an \u201cirrevocable taint\u201d that would affect the outcome of the rescheduling process. As a result, the administrative law judge ruled that he did not have the authority to remove the DEA from the hearings as a proponent of the proposed rule change.\n\u201cI can no more remove or re-designate the Administrator than I can hold parties in contempt and fine them,\u201d Mulrooney said. \u201cThe strangeness of this unsupported approach is amplified by the fact that the appointment of a new DEA Administrator by a different political party is imminent.\u201d\nMulrooney also criticized the DEA for its actions, writing that \u201cthe specter of officials at the highest level of Agency management selectively assisting and granting access to individuals and groups standing in opposition to the [Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, or NPRM] it purportedly supports as the proponent, carries no small measure of discomfiture,\u201d he said. \u201cIf true, viewed in the best light, these allegations demonstrate a puzzling and grotesque lack of understanding and poor judgment from high-level officials at a major federal agency with a wealth of prior experience with the [Administrative Procedures Act].\u201d\nMulrooney ordered the DEA or the movants to submit an update on the interlocutory appeal in 90 days. He also ordered additional updates on the appeal process be submitted every 90 days until the appeal is settled.\nJudge Slams DEA For Failure To Follow Directions\nPrior to cancelling next week\u2019s hearing, Mulrooney admonished the DEA for its \u201cunprecedented and astonishing\u201d failure to follow his instructions on submitting evidence for the proceedings. On several occasions, he had informed both the agency and potential witnesses that they should submit hard copies of all evidence they wanted considered in the hearing by January 3. He also rejected a DEA request for an exception to the rule.\nDespite the judge\u2019s directions, the DEA moved to submit thousands of public comments on the proposal to reschedule marijuana digitally via compact discs. Mulrooney rejected the motion in a ruling on Monday, citing his \u201cclear (and repeated) directives.\u201d\n\u201cThe Government has not supplied the tribunal with a hard copy of the lengthy proposed exhibit\u2026 which it represents as containing the Comments,\u201d Mulrooney said, according to a report from Marijuana Moment. \u201cIn view of the fact that Government\u2019s request for leave for an exception to the rules applicable to the rest of the Designated Participants was specifically denied, this action is clearly not a mistake borne of misunderstanding or inadvertence, but an action taken in deliberate defiance of specific direction.\u201d\n\u201cEven among the numerous extraordinary and puzzling actions taken thus far by the Government during the course of this litigation, this disobedience of an unequivocal directive from the tribunal is unprecedented and astonishing,\u201d the judge added."

      "text": "Politics\nAs Senate Approves Trump\u2019s DEA Pick, Marijuana Industry Urges Rescheduling In \u2018Timely And Transparent Manner\u2019\nThe Senate has given final approval to President Donald Trump\u2019s pick to run the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)\u2014and a major marijuana industry association is already pushing him to get the job done on the long-stalled federal cannabis rescheduling process.\nTerrance Cole was selected to serve as administrator of DEA, but the agency during Trump\u2019s second term has so far been run by interim leaders. Following a procedural vote on Monday to advance consideration of the nomination, the chamber made it official on Tuesday in a 50-47 confirmation vote.\nNotably, while Cole has said that examining the rescheduling proposal would be \u201cone of my first priorities\u201d if he was confirmed for the role, he has refused to say what he wants the result to be and has in the past made comments expressing concerns about the health effects of cannabis.\nThe National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA) wasted no time putting pressure on Cole to see through the rescheduling process, which was initiated under the Biden administration.\n\u201cThe rescheduling process under the previous administration was unnecessarily protracted and fraught by allegations of malfeasance within DEA and we look forward to your renewed leadership to expedite this process and fulfill President Trump\u2019s campaign promise to \u2018unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule III drug\u2019 and ultimately \u2018implement smart regulations, while providing access for adults, to safe, tested product,'\u201d NCIA\u2019s Aaron Smith said in a letter sent to Cole following the confirmation vote on Tuesday.\n\u201cAs such, we strongly encourage your office to continue advancing the cannabis rescheduling process in a timely and transparent manner,\u201d he said. \u201cRescheduling would help eliminate unnecessary barriers to research, reduce burdens on legitimate businesses operating under state law, and bring federal policy more in line with overwhelming public opinion and decades of state-level reform.\u201d\n\u201cAs DEA considers next steps, we respectfully urge your administration to recognize the importance of collaboration with stakeholders who can offer real-world insights into the public health, enforcement, and operational impacts of federal cannabis policy,\u201d the letter says. \u201cNCIA and our members welcome any opportunity to be constructive partners in that effort.\u201d\n\u201cWe are eager and ready to work with the DEA and Trump Administration to, as you said during your confirmation hearing, \u2018listen to the experts\u2019 and \u2018follow the science,\u2019 which we are confident will lead to a change in marijuana\u2019s status federally.\u201d\nIn May, a Senate committee advanced the nomination of Cole to become DEA administrator amid the ongoing review of the marijuana rescheduling proposal that he has so far refused to commit to enacting.\nCole\u2014who has previously voiced concerns about the dangers of marijuana and linked its use to higher suicide risk among youth\u2014said in response to senators\u2019 written questions that he would \u201cgive the matter careful consideration after consulting with appropriate personnel within the Drug Enforcement Administration, familiarizing myself with the current status of the regulatory process, and reviewing all relevant information.\u201d\nMeanwhile, earlier this month, DEA again notified an agency judge that the marijuana rescheduling process remains stalled under the Trump administration.\nIt\u2019s been six months since DEA Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) John Mulrooney temporarily paused hearings on a proposal to move cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) that was initiated under the Biden administration. And in a joint report to the judge submitted on Monday, DEA attorneys and rescheduling proponents said they\u2019re still at an impasse.\nFor the time being, any action on the proposed rule to reschedule marijuana is evidently contingent on DEA Acting Administrator Robert Murphy. More likely, according to some, is that it will not move forward until a permanent DEA administration is confirmed.\nMurphy\u2019s appointment as acting administrator wasn\u2019t widely publicized, but he\u2019s replaced Derek Maltz\u2014who subscribes to the \u201cgateway drug\u201d theory for marijuana\u2014in the role.\nDEA Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) John Mulrooney initially agreed to delay the rescheduling proceedings after several pro-reform parties requested a leave to file an interlocutory appeal amid allegations that certain DEA officials conspired with anti-rescheduling witnesses who were selected for the hearing.\nOriginally, hearings on the proposed rescheduling rule were set to commence on January 21, but those were cancelled when Mulrooney granted the appeal motion.\nThe appeal came after the judge denied a motion that sought DEA\u2019s removal from the rescheduling proceedings altogether, arguing that it is improperly designated as the chief \u201cproponent\u201d of the proposed rule given the allegations of ex parte communications with anti-rescheduling witnesses that \u201cresulted in an irrevocable taint\u201d to the process.\nMeanwhile, the Justice Department told a federal court in January that it should pause a lawsuit challenging DEA\u2019s marijuana rescheduling process after Mulrooney canceled the hearings.\nAlso in January, Mulrooney condemned DEA over its \u201cunprecedented and astonishing\u201d defiance of a key directive related to evidence it is seeking to use in the marijuana rescheduling proposal.\nAt issue was DEA\u2019s insistence on digitally submitting tens of thousands of public comments it received in response to the proposed rule to move cannabis to Schedule III.\nMulrooney hasn\u2019t been shy about calling out DEA over various procedural missteps throughout this rescheduling process.\nFor example, in December he criticized the agency for making a critical \u201cblunder\u201d in its effort to issue subpoenas to force Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials to testify in hearings\u2014but he allowed the agency to fix the error and ultimately granted the request.\nRelatedly, a federal judge also dismissed a lawsuit seeking to compel DEA to turn over its communications with the anti-cannabis organization.\nMulrooney had separately denied a cannabis research company\u2019s request to allow it to add a young medical marijuana patient and advocate as a witness in the upcoming rescheduling hearing.\nAlso, one of the nation\u2019s leading marijuana industry associations asked the judge to clarify whether it will be afforded the opportunity to cross-examine DEA during the upcoming hearings on the cannabis rescheduling proposal.\nFurther, a coalition of health professionals that advocates for cannabis reform recently asked that the DEA judge halt future marijuana rescheduling hearings until a federal court is able to address a series of allegations they\u2019re raising about the agency\u2019s witness selection process.\nSeparately, the House Appropriations Committee on Tuesday approved a spending bill that contains provisions to block the Justice Department from rescheduling marijuana.\nThe rescheduling proceedings have generated significant public interest. While moving marijuana to Schedule III wouldn\u2019t federally legalize it, the reform would free up licensed cannabis businesses to take federal tax deductions and remove certain research barriers.\n\u2014\nMarijuana Moment is tracking hundreds of cannabis, psychedelics and drug policy bills in state legislatures and Congress this year. Patreon supporters pledging at least $25/month get access to our interactive maps, charts and hearing calendar so they don\u2019t miss any developments.\nLearn more about our marijuana bill tracker and become a supporter on Patreon to get access.\n\u2014\nMeanwhile, two GOP senators introduced a bill in February that would continue to block marijuana businesses from taking federal tax deductions under Internal Revenue Service (IRS) code 280E\u2014even if it\u2019s ultimately rescheduled.\nBeyond the hearing delays, another complicating factor is the change in leadership at DEA under the Trump administration.\nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was previously vocal about his support for legalizing cannabis, as well as psychedelics therapy. But during his Senate confirmation process in February, he said that he would defer to DEA on marijuana rescheduling in his new role.\nSeparately, former Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) was reportedly photographed reviewing a document that appears to be a draft contract to provide services\u2014including \u201cadministration-related guidance\u201d\u2014to a firm affiliated with the major marijuana company Trulieve. The visible portion of the document describes a lucrative bonus if a certain \u201cmatter resolves,\u201d with an \u201cadditional \u2018Super Success Fee\u2019\u201d for other \u201cexclusive policy remedies.\u201d\nLast month, the former congressman reiterated his own support for rescheduling cannabis\u2014suggesting in an interview with a Florida Republican lawmaker that the GOP could win more of the youth vote by embracing marijuana reform.\nGaetz also said last month that Trump\u2019s endorsement of a Schedule III reclassification was essentially an attempt to shore up support among young voters rather than a sincere reflection of his personal views about cannabis.\nA survey conducted by a GOP pollster affiliated with Trump that was released in April found that a majority of Republicans back a variety of cannabis reforms, including rescheduling. And, notably, they\u2019re even more supportive of allowing states to legalize marijuana without federal interference compared to the average voter.\nMeanwhile, Trump picked former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi (R) to run DOJ, and the Senate confirmed that choice. During her confirmation hearings, Bondi declined to say how she planned to navigate key marijuana policy issues. And as state attorney general, she opposed efforts to legalize medical cannabis.\nAmid the stalled marijuana rescheduling process that\u2019s carried over from the last presidential administration, congressional researchers recently reiterated that lawmakers could enact the reform themselves with \u201cgreater speed and flexibility\u201d if they so choose, while potentially avoiding judicial challenges.\nMeanwhile, a newly formed coalition of professional athletes and entertainers, led by retired boxer Mike Tyson, sent a letter to Trump on Friday\u2014thanking him for past clemency actions while emphasizing the opportunity he has to best former President Joe Biden by rescheduling marijuana, expanding pardons and freeing up banking services for licensed cannabis businesses.\nPhoto courtesy of Chris Wallis // Side Pocket Images."

      "text": "The Associated Press reported on Tuesday that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has agreed to reclassify marijuana under a federal law, capping the Biden administration\u2019s efforts to reform the nation\u2019s cannabis regulatory policy. Under the change, the DEA will reschedule marijuana under the federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to Schedule III instead of its current Schedule I status, a classification reserved for drugs with no medical value and a high potential for abuse, according to the AP report.\n\u201cThis is a positive step forward for federal cannabis policy, however it is a rather modest step given the strong support among American voters for comprehensive cannabis reform,\u201d Matthew Schweich, executive director of the cannabis policy reform group Marijuana Policy Project, said in a statement after news of the DEA\u2019s decision broke on Tuesday. \u201cIt is important to acknowledge that this rescheduling would not affect the criminalization of medical cannabis patients and cannabis consumers under state laws \u2013 so we must continue the work of enacting sensible and fair cannabis legalization and medical cannabis laws through state legislatures and ballot initiatives.\u201d\nAP reports that the DEA\u2019s decision to reschedule cannabis was confirmed \u201cby five people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive regulatory review.\u201d The decision has not been formally announced and is subject to approval by the White House Office of Management and Budget.\nIn August 2023, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services formally recommended that cannabis be rescheduled under the CSA. The recommendation was based on a review of the science behind the medicinal use of cannabis that supported the change to Schedule III, a less strict classification that includes drugs such as Tylenol with codeine and testosterone.\n\u201cI\u2019m underwhelmed by the progress made during President Biden\u2019s administration, I think it was fair to expect more,\u201d added Schweich. \u201cIt was absurd to consider cannabis to be more dangerous than heroin, as is the case today. It will remain absurd to consider cannabis to be more dangerous than alcohol, Xanax, and Valium, which will still be the case after this rescheduling takes effect.\u201d\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nBiden Administration Scores Cannabis Policy Reform Victory\nThe decision to change the status of marijuana under federal law comes after months of cannabis policy reform from the executive branch. In 2022, President Joseph Biden issued an executive order pardoning thousands of low-lever marijuana convictions and directed his administration to review the federal prohibition of cannabis.\nIn January, a federal review of cannabis research by HHS determined that marijuana is eligible for less strict classification under federal drug laws, according to agency documents. In the review, researchers with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) determined that credible evidence shows that marijuana has legitimate medical uses and fits the criteria for rescheduling under the Controlled Substances Act.\n\u201cFDAs acknowledgment of the medical efficacy of cannabis and relatively low potential for abuse is of the most significant shifts in drug policy in this century,\u201d Shawn Hauser, a partner at the cannabis law firm Vicente LLP, said in an emailed statement. \u201cThat the federal government considered the widespread medical use in state medical marijuana programs underscores the impact of state reforms that have helped millions of patients. This is a very positive step towards the end of prohibition and for public health , and signals that the Biden administration is poised to complete its expeditious review to reclassify cannabis.\u201d\nThe DEA\u2019s decision is receiving a warm welcome from the regulated cannabis industry. Recreational marijuana is now legal in 24 states and 38 have legalized cannabis for medical use. Matt Darin, CEO of multistate cannabis operator Curaleaf, praised the federal drug law enforcement agency for changing its stance on marijuana.\n\u201cToday\u2019s decision by the DEA to reschedule cannabis to Schedule III is one of the most monumental developments that cannabis has seen in years and is a crucial step in undoing the harms caused by the failed and discriminatory War on Drugs,\u201d Darin said in a statement from the company. \u201cWe are thankful to President Biden and his Administration for helping to push this process forward. This ruling reflects evolving attitudes towards the plant, recognizing its well-documented therapeutic value and medicinal applications. It's very clear that the country is ready for this step, given that 92% of Americans are now in support of legalization in some form.\u201d\nGeorge Archos, founder and CEO of Verano Holdings, said that \u201cthe DEA\u2019s rumored decision to reschedule cannabis to Schedule III clearly affirms what our Verano team has always known: cannabis is an incredible plant that provides numerous health and wellness benefits to millions of Americans, contributes billions of dollars to local economies, and supports over 400,000 careers across a growing number of states. With more than 70% of Americans in support of legalization on a bipartisan basis, cannabis is more accepted and popular than ever, and as detailed in the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 recommendation letter, holds scientifically proven medicinal value.\u201d\nGeorge Sadler, the CEO and co-founder of San Diego-based Gelato Cannabis, notes that the DEA decision will have an impact on the profitability of regulated marijuana companies, explaining that \u201ctaxes will go down considerably across the board, and we'll be treated as any other company.\u201d With cannabis reclassified under Schedule III, an IRS rule that denies standard business tax deductions to companies involved in sales of Schedule I substances will no longer apply.\n\u201cThe cost of doing business cannot be deducted and it\u2019s crazy,\u201d Sadler writes in an email."
