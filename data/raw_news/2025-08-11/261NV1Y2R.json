  "content": "Plus, more tips on how to keep your house secure\n\nLOCKED IN I\u2019m an ex-burglar, the obvious signs that show us we can easily rob you and knowing you have a dog helps us out\n\nA FORMER burglar has revealed the obvious signs homeowners leave that make it easy for them to rob you.\n\nWith many of us going on holiday this summer, you'll want to make sure your home is secure while you're away.\n\nAnd ex-burglar Michael Fraser has revealed just how easy it can be.\n\nThe former young offender now spends his time testing security systems for large companies and advising police forces.\n\nHe says that at least half a dozen burglaries he is aware of have taken place after homes were put up for sale and video tours were put up on sites such as Rightmove and Zoopla.\n\n\u201cI call it internet shopping,\" he told The Times. \"How many times when you look online at houses, you get a virtual tour of that property, so you know it inside out?\"\n\n\u201cThe estate agent website gives you all the details of the property, exactly where it is. And then it will give you a virtual 360-degree tour inside.\"\n\nMichael adds that property websites should enforce users to create passwords and upload personal details which should help deter burglars from using the site to gain information on the property.\n\nHe adds that homeowners are making themselves easy targets by failing to secure their properties properly.\n\n\u201cJust imagine losing your keys to your property. How would you get in? The opportunist will find their way in very quickly, just as you would,\u201d he says.\n\nMichael recommends closing all blinds and curtains when leaving the house.\n\nHe says this signals you're serious about security and will deter a thief from trying to get inside if they can't see what is up for grabs.\n\nYou also need to think about what they can see from the back of the house.\n\nMany people leave keys inside their back door making it easy for thieves to enter.\n\nKitchen calendars are usually visible to so they know exactly when you're away for the summer.\n\nA letterbox cage is also a good idea as it prevents them from being able to reach for keys or the door handle with a metal pole.\n\nLast but not least, having a dog might not be the deterrent you think it is.\n\nSigns warning about having a dog in the property only let thieves know that you don\u2019t have motion detectors and they will be able to move around freely inside the property \u2014 as your cats and dogs do \u2014 if they break in.",
