      "summary": "Wall Street fell sharply as Nvidia and other tech names slid, dragging the S&P 500 lower amid rising Treasury yields and uncertainty over Trump’s tariff policy and potential Fed independence attacks. The 10‑year UST yield rose to 4.27%, adding pressure on equities, while a court ruling upheld the legality of Trump’s tariffs, leaving the policy in place. Gold rallied 2% to a record, reflecting safe‑haven demand, and market participants eye upcoming jobs data and Fed policy for possible rate cuts. The day also saw corporate earnings news, with Constellation Brands and Kraft Heinz cutting forecasts, and PepsiCo gaining after activist pressure.",
