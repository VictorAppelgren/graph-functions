      "feedback": "**Actionable edit checklist (to bring the draft to world‑class, Argos‑style quality)**  \n\n1. **Canonical mapping & magnitude** – Every claim about the dollar must explicitly reference a canonical handle (e.g., `dxy`, `ust10y`, `cpi`) and give a signed, numeric range (e.g., “dxy down 1–1.5 %”). Add inline citations (e.g., `(Z7O1DCHS7)`).  \n2. **Catalyst windows** – Clearly state the 3–6 month horizon and the two key windows:  \n   - Fed September 16‑17 meeting (cut probability 88 % – cite `(Z7O1DCHS7)`).  \n   - CPI release 13‑17 Aug (inflation ≥2 % vs <2 % – cite `(XTQIQRP5K)`).  \n   Ensure each scenario links the outcome to one of these windows.  \n3. **Scenario structure** – Re‑frame the base case and two alternatives as bullet‑style “If‑then” blocks with explicit magnitude ranges and dates.  \n4. **Watch signals & invalidations** – Add a concise “Watch signals” list (Fed minutes, CPI, 2y‑10y spread, political developments) and an “Invalidation” list (Fed holds/raises rates, CPI <2 %, Cook lawsuit resolved).  \n5. **First‑principles grounding** – Replace generic “dollar may weaken” with causal chain: Fed cuts → short‑term yields fall → yield curve flattens → dollar supply ↑ → dxy ↓. Cite the source for each link.  \n6. **Remove drift** – Delete any mention of gold, silver, or other non‑dollar assets. Keep focus on `dxy`, `ust10y`, `cpi`, and Fed policy.  \n7. **Conciseness & decisiveness** – Trim redundant phrasing (“the same day”, “on Monday”) and use a single sentence per key point.  \n8. **Citation density** – Every substantive claim (e.g., “Fed’s forward guidance remains dovish”) must have an inline ID.  \n9. **Alignment with Section Focus** – Verify that the final paragraph contains only the asset `dxy` and its transmission path; no other handles should appear.  \n\nImplement these edits to meet the Argos criteria: clear causal chain, explicit magnitude, catalyst windows, and defensible, concise output.",
