      "summary": "Organizations often mistake performative alignment for genuine cultural unity, leading to superficial fixes rather than authentic engagement. True culture is messy and complex, resembling a tapestry woven from diverse experiences and contradictions. Leaders should embrace this complexity by inviting individuals to interpret shared values personally, fostering a culture that adapts and evolves rather than enforcing uniformity. The concept of 'Exile's Clarity' suggests that stepping back can provide valuable insights into organizational culture and purpose, allowing leaders to see beyond their assumptions and create a more inclusive environment.",
