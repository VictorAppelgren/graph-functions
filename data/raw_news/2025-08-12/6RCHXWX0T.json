  "title": "'We are going to take back MacArthur Park': Labor groups protest renewed immigration raids in Los Angeles",
  "description": "SEIU 721 and other labor groups rallied in MacArthur Park and elsewhere in Los Angeles throughout the day on Tuesday.",
  "content": "Several hundred workers, organizers and immigrant advocates gathered in palm-tree-dotted MacArthur Park on Tuesday to denounce the Trump administration and immigration raids it has carried out in the city and in other parts of California.\n\nRows of parked cars clogged a stretch of Park View Street in the morning, blocking traffic. Scrawled on windshields and bumpers in chalky white and printed on taped signs were slogans \u201cICE out of LA\u201d and \u201cStop the Trump terror.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur fight is for working people. ... It\u2019s a fight against authoritarianism. It\u2019s a fight to restore democracy in this country,\u201d said Huerta, who was injured and detained by law enforcement in early June while documenting the first major immigration enforcement raids in Los Angeles this summer. \u201cEverybody wants to know, how is Los Angeles? And I tell them Los Angeles is ready to fight.\u201d\n\nRaids since early June in Los Angeles have swept up hundreds. The ongoing threat to the many immigrant workers that local labor groups count among their members, as well as criminal charges of conspiracy to impede an officer brought against Huerta, have ignited protests in recent months.\n\nLabor groups said they are pushing for an end to the raids and to the presence of federal agents in Los Angeles, as well as the release of immigrants detained and a stop to the expansion of private detention centers.\n\nOn Tuesday, speakers urged people not to purchase from major companies including Home Depot, Walmart, Target and fast-food restaurants that they contend are not doing enough to protect their employees.\n\nA spokesperson for Home Depot previously told The Times the company had not been notified of any of the raids at its locations ahead of time and that the company was not involved in any of the operations.\n\n\u201cWe are going to take back MacArthur Park,\u201d said Felipe Caceres, an organizer with SEIU 721. \u201cFor 24 hours we are reclaiming our power to stop the Trump terror. For 24 hours we are going to boycott companies.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe park, which is nestled in the heart of a dense immigrant community, has become a symbol ever since July 7, when federal agents descended on it with horses and armored vehicles, carrying rifles and in tactical gear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to reclaim this space, where ICE staged a show of force. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re here to do,\u201d said Marissa Nuncio, executive director of the Garment Worker Center.\n\nLocal unions and labor groups have rallied to support their members in recent months.\n\nThe Garment Worker Center has worked to deliver food to garment manufacturers sheltering at home and held \u201cKnow Your Rights\u201d trainings. As car wash workers across the region have been snapped up in raids, the CLEAN Carwash Worker Center has scrambled to track deportations and connect families with legal services.\n\nThe union representing Southern California hotel workers, Unite Here Local 11, has pressed hotel owners to push back on the Trump administration\u2019s rhetoric and provide additional protections for the many in its workforce who are asylum seekers, immigrants with Temporary Protected Status and recipients of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA.\n\nCooks and cashiers with the California Fast Food Workers Union this week penned a letter to fast-food businesses urging them to commit to protecting workers by barring federal agents from entering spaces that they do not have proper warrants to enter.\n\n\u201cFast-food worker bosses, whose side are you guys on? Are you going to sit here and just let [the federal government] run all over us? We\u2019re asking you today to stand up with us and protect us,\u201d said Anneisha Williams, a member of the state\u2019s Fast Food Council, at the Tuesday rally.\n\nLizzet, a McDonald\u2019s employee in Los Angeles who walked off the job at midnight Tuesday along with some co-workers, said in an interview that she joined the protest because she and co-workers have feared going to work.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening right now is unjust,\u201d said Lizzet, who asked not to be identified by her last name for fear of reprisals.",

The family drove from Los Angeles to Tijuana on June 7 while demonstrators were taking to the streets in downtown L.A. to protest the Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown and ongoing raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n- Share via\nFriends ID woman hit by SUV at \u2018No Kings\u2019 protest: \u2018She was so proud to be out there\u2019\nThe Riverside Police Department is seeking help from the public two days after the driver of a black SUV rammed through a group of demonstrators in downtown Riverside, running over a young woman who remains in critical condition but is stable.\nThe department is asking for help in identifying and locating the suspect in the incident that occurred around 9:10 p.m. on University Avenue between Main and Orange streets, according to Officer Ryan J. Railsback, a spokesperson for the department.\n- Share via\nL.A. immigration protest costs reach nearly $20 million for police and city repairs\nThe city of Los Angeles has racked up nearly $20 million in police costs and other expenses in response to protests that have erupted over federal immigration raids, the city\u2019s top budget analyst said Monday.\nCity Administrative Officer Matt Szabo said in a memo to the City Council that the city has incurred at least $19.7 million in costs through June 16.

Opera lovers attend shows in downtown L.A. despite protests\nHours before downtown Los Angeles headed into its sixth night under curfew orders imposed by L.A. Mayor Karen Bass, dozens of opera and theater fans funneled into the Music Center on Sunday afternoon to catch matinee performances of L.A. Opera\u2019s \u201cRigoletto\u201d and Center Theatre Group\u2019s \u201cHamlet.\u201d\nThe shows took place just one day after thousands of \u201cNo Kings\u201d demonstrators flooded the streets to protest immigration raids across the city. Center Theatre Group had canceled its Wednesday night performance of director Robert O\u2019Hara\u2019s world-premiere adaptation of \u201cHamlet\u201d before officials announced a curfew exemption on Thursday for ticket holders of indoor events and performing arts venues downtown such as the Music Center. Saturday\u2019s matinee and evening performances of \u201cHamlet\u201d were also canceled in anticipation of the protests. No performances of \u201cRigoletto\u201d were canceled and L.A. Opera\u2019s \u201cRenee Fleming and Friends\u201d event took place on Saturday night.\n- Share via\nTrump directs ICE to expand deportations in Democratic-run cities\nPresident Donald Trump on Sunday directed federal immigration officials to prioritize deportations from Democratic-run cities, a move that comes after large protests erupted in Los Angeles and other major cities against the Trump administration\u2019s immigration policies.\nTrump in a social media posting called on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials \u201cto do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.\u201d\nHe added that to reach the goal officials \u201dmust expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America\u2019s largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside.\u201d\nTrump\u2019s declaration comes after weeks of increased enforcement, and after Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and main architect of Trump\u2019s immigration policies, said ICE officers would target at least 3,000 arrests a day, up from about 650 a day during the first five months of Trump\u2019s second term.\n- Share via\nSkelton: Padilla was right to challenge Noem\u2019s right-wing lunacy\nSACRAMENTO \u2014 Sen. Alex Padilla had heard all he could stand from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. For good reason. She was sounding like a military dictator and brushing off California voters.\nSo the California senator interrupted her. He tried to ask a question \u2014 and wound up being shoved out of the room by federal bodyguards, strong-armed to the floor and handcuffed.\n- Share via\nVideo shows military-style vehicle in what witnesses say was a Compton immigration raid\nA typical Monday afternoon in Compton was shattered for several neighbors who saw, to their surprise, a drab green military-style vehicle roll up. A person stood in the open hatch wearing fatigues, a helmet and what they said appeared to be body armor. Residents who spoke to The Times said it was an immigration enforcement team using an armored vehicle for a raid in which a family including children was detained.\n- Share via\n- Share via\nDriver remains at large after woman injured in hit-and-run at Riverside protest\nA woman who had been taking part in a protest in Riverside on Saturday sustained serious injuries in a hit-and-run incident in Riverside. The driver remained at large Sunday night.\nAround 9:10 p.m. Saturday following a \u201cNo Kings\u201d rally and a protest against immigration raids, a large group of demonstrators was marching in the street along University Avenue between Main and Orange streets, said Officer Ryan J. Railsback, the Riverside Police Department public information officer.\nRailsback said a \u201cspeeding SUV drove around the march and struck a female pedestrian before fleeing the scene.\u201d\nPolice have not released the name of the woman who was hit, but KCAL interviewed friends of the victim who identified her as a 21-year-old who recently celebrated her birthday. They told the news outlet that she suffered severe skull injuries as well as a cracked rib, punctured lung and broken leg. As of Sunday afternoon, they said, she was in a medically induced coma and was set to undergo a second surgery.\nRailsback said paramedics \u201ctreated the victim at the scene. Then she was transported to a local hospital with significant injuries in stable condition.\u201d\nAt the time of the collision, there were two protests in the area \u2014 one was part of the \u201cNo Kings\u201d rallies taking place across the country. Another was a demonstration against raids by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\u201cThe groups merged early on,\u201d Railsback said. \u201cAnd we have no reason to believe the driver was part of this protest.\u201d\nInvestigators are not only seeking the driver but also trying to determine if the incident was intentional or politically linked.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know if it was accidental or not, but we are investigating it as an assault with a deadly weapon at this time,\u201d Railsback said.\nThe KCAL report said video from the scene showed protesters approaching the black SUV. One of the demonstrators bumped into the car\u2019s left taillight, and another smashed it with an object. The driver then quickly turned into the crowd and ran over the woman. The car sped away as people chased after it, according to this description.\n\u201cWe are aware of the various social media videos that are being circulated and are using those to help us identify the driver,\u201d Railsback said.\n- Share via\nPeace outside City Hall in downtown L.A. as curfew arrives\nProtesters made one last march to the complex of federal buildings in downtown L.A. on Sunday evening, stopping in front of a line of Homeland Security agents, police officers and U.S. Marines \u2014 but the vibe remained upbeat. Some demonstrators played music; cars passing by handed out water bottles; and several protesters wished the law enforcement and stationed military a happy Father\u2019s Day.\nAs curfew approached, the crowd made it back to City Hall, but numbers dwindled. Daniel Fuentes, who\u2019d been translating chants and updates for Spanish-speaking members of the crowd, reminded everyone to get home safe.\n\u201cGod bless and good night,\u201d he said into a megaphone before walking off. A few thanked the LAPD officers posted outside City Hall; others cheered before heading out.\nJust before 8 p.m., there were only three people left on the City Hall steps, and nearby L.A. police officers didn\u2019t seem concerned. Sunday appeared to be the first night in days that curfew arrived without a violent standoff or arrests.\nBryan Sagastume, for one, was glad to be going home without the sting of tear gas Sunday; he said he was gassed several times Saturday night. This evening, though, he stood calmly in front of the quiet City Hall, holding up a Mexican flag, where his mother is from. He wanted to stay out as long as possible.\n\u201cBoth my parents are immigrants,\u201d the 25-year-old said. \u201cThey grew up here, working hard \u2026 no criminals, nothing like that. And I just feel like what Trump is doing is wrong.\u201d\nHe was born in the U.S., so he feels safe to come out and protest \u2014 and wants to do so for those who can\u2019t. Still, it\u2019s stressful.\n\u201cMy mom\u2019s been, like, not going outside the house, staying home,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s scared right now to go outside.\u201d\nAs he started to go \u2014 leaving behind only two protesters \u2014 a helicopter could be heard overhead, and a coyote darted across North Spring Street.\n- Share via\nSmaller but determined crowds march downtown as heat rises: \u2018L.A.\u2019s too hot for ICE\u2019\nDowntown Los Angeles was much quieter Sunday afternoon than it was during Saturday\u2019s heavily attended \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests. But \u2014 amid summer-like heat \u2014 around 200 activists were determined to keep the anti-ICE and anti-Trump protests going.\nChristopher Lee carried a sign that said \u201cL.A.\u2019s too hot for ICE\u201d as the temperature climbed to near 90.\n\u201cToday\u2019s been modest,\u201d the 39-year-old Venice resident said, \u201cbut it\u2019s good to see so many people willing to keep up the momentum.\u201d\n\u201cICE out of LA!\u201d a group chanted as they marched between City Hall and the Metropolitan Detention Center to a chorus of supportive honks from motorists passing by. \u201cWhose streets? Our streets!\u201d\nSean Patterson wasn\u2019t able to make it to Saturday\u2019s massive protests against the Trump administration and immigration raids, so he and a friend decided to camp out in front of City Hall on Sunday.\n\u201cI can\u2019t sit by ... when this is all going on,\u201d said Patterson, a 23-year-old Hollywood resident. \u201cIt just feels like we\u2019re slowly inching closer and closer to \u2026 anything people in power want to happen can happen.\u201d\nNeither Lee nor Patterson had seen clashes between protesters and law enforcement or military on Sunday. They said they planned to leave before the 8 p.m. curfew went into effect.\nAfter an afternoon that hit a high of 89 degrees in downtown LA, according to the National Weather Service, Ed Ramirez was starting to run low on cold drinks in his cooler. He\u2019d been giving out free waters \u2014 and selling other cold drinks \u2014 to protesters on the march. The Ventura County resident said he had been at protests in downtown L.A. for most of the last week with his speaker and his cooler.\n\u201cI did really good yesterday,\u201d the 50-year-old said. \u201cWhat goes around comes around.\u201d\nHe said Sunday\u2019s crowd was youthful overall, so he was less worried about their health in the heat, but he was happy he was able to dole out waters.\nRamirez said he\u2019d been able to become a citizen through President Reagan\u2019s immigration reforms in the 1980s after coming to the U.S. from Mexico. Now, though, \u201cthere\u2019s no talk about a pathway to legalization for millions of folks that we have here undocumented.\u201d\nHe said it was an \u201cinjustice\u201d that people were being forcibly removed from their communities.\n\u201cI come from a family of immigrants. \u2026 Love your country, but never trust its government,\u201d he said, as he reminded a young protester he could take water for free, but $5 for beer or Gatorade.\n- Share via\n35 taken into custody downtown during \u2018No Kings\u2019 protests, 561 total arrested in last week\nDuring Saturday\u2019s \u201cNo Kings\u201d protests downtown, Los Angeles police used forceful tactics to disperse and redirect demonstrators but made relatively few arrests \u2014 most of them for curfew violations, the department said.\nBut hundreds have been arrested by the LAPD since June 7 related to immigration-raid protest activity. Police on Sunday announced 561 total arrests.\nOver the day and evening hours Saturday, officers arrested 35 people for curfew violations, one for failure to disperse, one for resisting, obstructing or delaying an officer and one for resisting arrest.\nThe department also reported that three officers were injured; the LAPD said 12 had been injured over the last week\u2019s protests but did not describe the nature of the injuries.\nSaturday\u2019s protests, which were meant to express opposition to the Trump administration, attracted tens of thousands of participants across Southern California.

The man, who is Latino, said agents took his ID. \u201cThe way this is being carried out is inhumane and cruel.\u201d\n- Share via\nImmigration \u2018notario\u2019 scams coming back under Trump\u2019s crackdown, authorities warn\nAfter she was assaulted by her romantic partner in 2000 while living in Los Angeles County, Maria Gutierrez Aragon turned to a family friend who said he could help her secure immigration papers.\nBecause she had been the victim of a crime, the friend said, he could help her obtain authorization to stay in the U.S.\n- Share via\nThousands of protesters flood downtown L.A. to demonstrate against Trump\n- Share via\nThousands of people streamed into downtown L.A. on Saturday morning to protest President Trump and his policies.\nAlong Hill Street, crowds of demonstrators carrying signs and waving flags made their way to Grand Park \u2014 a central gathering place before the march kicked off \u2014 and passed National Guard troops protecting a federal building.\nRichard Ramsey wore a shirt that showed a crossed-out crown and the words \u201cNo Kings.\u201d\nHe said he came from Tustin in Orange County to join the protest because he wanted to be around like minded-people, and expressed concern about the \u201coverreach\u201d of the Trump administration.

      "text": "Federal agents use Penske rental truck as \u2018Trojan Horse\u2019 to raid Los Angeles Home Depot\n- Share via\nA man driving a Penske truck pulled up to day laborers at the Home Depot and told them he was looking for workers, recalled one day laborer.\nThe workers gathered around, just as more than half a dozen Border Patrol agents jumped out the back. Many of the people scattered, but 16 were arrested in the operation.\nAfter weeks of relative quiet, the immigration raid on a Home Depot in Westlake early Wednesday morning revived fears of widespread sweeps in Los Angeles as U.S. Border Patrol Sector Chief Greg Bovino warned, \u201cWe\u2019re not leaving.\u201d\nBovino, who has led operations since they began in June, referred to the raid as \u201cOperation Trojan Horse.\u201d\nImmigrant advocates and city leaders had hoped such sweeps had stopped with a federal judge\u2019s order, affirmed by a U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel, that immigration officials cannot racially profile people or use roving patrols to target immigrants.\n\u201cWe are all trying to look into ... exactly what happened,\u201d said Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. \u201cBut from the video and from the stills, it looks like the exact same thing that we were seeing before.\u201d\nIn her temporary restraining order, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong had ruled that using a person\u2019s race, language, job or location as a probable cause to detain them violated the 4th Amendment.\n- Share via\nFederal agents use Penske rental truck as \u2018Trojan Horse\u2019 to raid Los Angeles Home Depot.\n\u201cFor those who thought Immigration enforcement had stopped in Southern California, think again,\u201d acting U.S. Atty. Bill Essayli posted on X shortly after the raid. \u201cThe enforcement of federal law is not negotiable and there are no sanctuaries from the reach of the federal government.\u201d\nDepartment of Homeland Security officials released a short statement saying the operation led to \u201cthe arrest of 16 illegal aliens from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras, and Nicaragua,\u201d and did not answer questions. They told a Fox News reporter that \u201cMS-13 has a chokehold on this area.\u201d However, agents appeared to arrest only day laborers and street vendors, who are often extorted by the gangs.\nWhen a reporter told Bass at a news conference that Border Patrol said it was targeting gang members, she replied sarcastically. \u201cYeah, and you can see that when somebody is sitting at a Home Depot.\u201d\nBass said later she wants City Atty. Hydee Feldstein Soto\u2019s office to determine whether the tactics used by federal agents during the Home Depot operation violated the restraining order.\n\u201cJust being a Home Depot day laborer, to me, is not probable cause,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the question I would have is, what were they possibly observing at Home Depot? They were observing people looking for a job for one day.\u201d\nThe Border Patrol changed one aspect of its approach. Instead of arriving in unmarked Ford and Chevy SUVs, agents showed up in vans that could be easily mistaken for those driven by workers, and the Penske truck, often used by people moving who need extra help. At least one van had a straw hat and orange construction vest sitting on the dashboard.\nThe 9th Circuit Court of Appeals dealt a stinging blow to the Trump administration\u2019s mass deportation project Friday night, upholding a lower court\u2019s block on \u201croving patrols\u201d across much of Southern California.\nA day laborer, who identified himself as Cesar, said around 6:45 a.m. the Penske truck pulled up to laborers who had gathered in the parking lot. The driver told them in Spanish he was looking for workers.\nSeveral of the men gathered around the truck and then someone, it was unclear who, rolled up the back of the truck, Cesar recounted. Masked agents, one wearing a cowboy hat, jumped out and started chasing people. People scattered.\n\u201cThis is the worst feeling ever,\u201d said Cesar, who has been going to the home improvement store to pick up work for several years.\nVideo on social media captured the moment the back of the rental truck opened. When Penske Truck Rental was asked about it, the company said it was looking into it.\n\u201cThe company was not made aware that its trucks would be used in today\u2019s operation and did not authorize this,\u201d said Penske spokesman Randolph P. Ryerson. \u201cPenske will reach out to DHS and reinforce its policy to avoid improper use of its vehicles in the future.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cPenske strictly prohibits the transportation of people in the cargo area of its vehicles under any circumstances.\u201d\nThe majority of people held in the June immigration raids in Southern California were not criminals. Nearly half of them were Mexicans and most were men.\nAnna Cho, a member of the advocacy group LA Tenants Union, was setting up a booth at the Home Depot for renters in the dense, low-income Latino neighborhood to get information about their legal rights. Lately, she said, the group has become a de facto recorder of enforcement activity.\n\u201cIt was really chaotic,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a lot of yelling. There was running, and when I went outside, the immigration officers were grabbing people. It was very indiscriminate. Some were resisting.\u201d\nIn a video shown to The Times, two white sprinter vans and the yellow Penske truck arrive at the parking lot. One of the vans can be seen blocking the Home Depot driveway on Union Avenue, in a move to apparently stop vehicles from driving out of the lot. The other van parks near a sidewalk where street vendors sell food.\nIn another video, masked men in Border Patrol uniforms can be seen leading a woman in an apron away from the folding table where she sold food and drinks. She was handcuffed and loaded into the van.\nA member of Tenants Union can be heard asking, \u201cDo you have a warrant?\u201d None of the agents responded.\n\u201cIt was so fast. It happened in a matter of 10 minutes,\u201d said Xochilt Soza, a mover who picks up work at the Home Depot. She saw several white vans drive into the lot, along with the Penske truck, and about 20 to 30 agents fan out of the vehicles. Agents arrested Angel, a man whom she knew for years and who was also looking for work.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so sad,\u201d she said, shaking her head in disbelief.\n\u201cI am not well,\u201d said another worker, who did not want to give his name. He said he was devastated by the raids but that he wasn\u2019t going to leave the parking lot, because he still needed the work.\nOne worker who escaped was still shaken by the experience an hour later. He identified himself as Raul and said he saw at least eight people get arrested.\n\u201cThat\u2019s one of their cars,\u201d he said pointing to a silver Toyota sedan.\nThe Home Depot had been one of the scenes of the first raids in June that kicked off more than a month of operations in Southern California in which civil rights lawyers say federal agents indiscriminately arrested immigrants. The raids gutted businesses, spread fear and tore apart families.\nOn July 11, Judge Frimpong temporarily blocked federal agents from using racial profiling to carry out indiscriminate arrests after the ACLU, Public Counsel, other groups and private attorneys sued over the practices, saying the region had been \u201cunder siege.\u201d\nDepartment of Justice attorneys argued the order hindered them from carrying out federal immigration enforcement, but the 9th Circuit upheld the order.\nCity Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez, who represents the area, called Wednesday\u2019s operation \u201cyet another attack on our judicial system by the Trump Administration\u201d and said it was a \u201cclear violation of the temporary restraining order.\u201d\n\u201cUsing a rental truck to round up people like cargo is a disgusting reflection of this administration\u2019s total disregard for human life and the rule of law,\u201d Hernandez said in a statement. \u201cIt is clear that Angelenos \u2014 my constituents \u2014 are being racially profiled and hunted for political points.\u201d\nACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar said the organization is reviewing reports of recent raids.\n\u201cThe evidence available so far raises serious concerns that the federal government may be in violation of the federal judge\u2019s July temporary restraining order,\u201d he said. \u201cWe encourage community members to reach out if they have any specific information about these incidents and we will continue to evaluate the evidence and alert the court at the appropriate juncture of any further unlawful actions.\u201d\nThis week, a federal judge approved a court settlement barring Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers from identifying as state or local law enforcement and from engaging in ruses misrepresenting their governmental identity or purpose, according to the ACLU. That settlement applies specifically to ICE.\nFor the last weeks since the restraining order kicked in, Bovino has shared photos of arrests of undocumented immigrants, stating that some had active arrest warrants. With others, he referenced a lengthy criminal history, marking the arrests as more targeted than they had been prior.\nBut organizers say similar operations to the Wednesday raid have unfolded in recent days and have sparked concerns about violations of the restraining order. On social media, people shared a video from Saturday of Border Patrol agents seemingly raiding a Lakewood Car Wash and taking at least two people into custody.\nAnother operation unfolded Monday at a Home Depot in Hollywood that was the site of a massive raid in June.\nMaegan Ortiz, the executive director of the nonprofit group Instituto de Educaci\u00f3n Popular del Sur de California, known as IDEPSCA, said it began receiving word about an immigration operation at the Home Depot in Hollywood around 6:50 a.m. She said at least two people were arrested.\nOrtiz said Border Patrol agents \u201cseem to be making the same rounds again.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re hitting the same places they hit Round 1, if you will, and they\u2019re trying new tactics,\u201d she said. She said they\u2019re pretending to be employers and luring people \u201cas if they\u2019re street vendors themselves.\u201d\n\u201cWhat does this mean for the TRO [temporary restraining order]? There\u2019s a lot of anxiety both from workers and from organizational staff,\u201d she said."

What really happened?\nDay laborers have been crucial to rebuilding efforts after Los Angeles County\u2019s devastating January firestorms.\nOn Saturday, a Home Depot in the predominantly Latino suburb of Paramount, which is south of Los Angeles, also became the site of clashes between protesters and authorities.\nAfter a weekend of protests, officials also carried out raids at Home Depot locations in Whittier and Huntington Park on Monday morning, and reports of additional raids at other Southern California Home Depot locations spread across social media.\nA spokesperson for Home Depot confirmed Monday that the company had not been notified of any of the raids at its locations ahead of time and that the company was not involved in any of the operations.\nThe Atlanta-based chain now faces a difficult situation, with its locations serving as a frequent site of raids, potentially turning away customers.\nFor the record:\n8:18 a.m. June 10, 2025An earlier version of this post incorrectly described Home Depot\u2019s closing stock price on Monday.\nHome Depot shares closed at $365.20, down 0.6%, on Monday. The company reported revenue of nearly $40 billion in its fiscal first quarter this year, up 9% from a year earlier. Net earnings for the quarter were $3.4 billion, down from $3.6 billion during the same period last year.\nIt\u2019s not the first time the company has made headlines as the subject of controversy.\nHome Depot\u2019s co-founder Bernie Marcus donated at least $14 million to support Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency and pledged to support his reelection bid. Marcus, who died in 2024, had a reputation as a Republican megadonor.\nProtesters called for a boycott of the company in 2019 over his donations. The chain has tried to distance itself from its founder, stressing that he left the company in 2002 and that his donations and statements were not on behalf of Home Depot.\nHome Depot locations have been for decades convenient spots for contractors and those embarking on home improvement projects to hire skilled laborers.\nThe construction industry in Southern California depends heavily on immigrants and day laborers, a reliance that has been highlighted by recent fire recovery efforts in the region.\nJorge Nicol\u00e1s, a senior organizer at a day labor center run by the Central American Resource Center, or CARECEN, said day laborers often take on undesirable jobs or jobs with tough conditions, making them crucial to many construction jobs.\n\u201cThe majority of immigrant workers usually are used to help developers control construction costs and stay within the timelines that they have projected,\u201d he said. \u201cThose are the extra hands that are needed.\u201d\nNicol\u00e1s was in Westlake on Friday when immigration officials carried out a sweep outside of the Home Depot there. CARECEN\u2019s day labor center is just minutes away from the store. He described the scene as chaotic, and even workers who he knows have legal status were fleeing in fear, he said.\n\u201cWe felt powerless,\u201d Nicol\u00e1s said. \u201cThey\u2019re not arresting motorcycle gang members. They\u2019re not arresting international drug dealers. They\u2019re arresting grandpas. They\u2019re just arresting people that are very humble and looking for an opportunity, just trying to get a decent living.\u201d\nBy Monday afternoon, the parking lot of the Home Depot in Huntington Park was busy, with nearly 100 cars and pickup trucks filling the lot.\nThere were few signs that a raid had taken place just hours earlier, but Bradley Cortez and his friends stood in the lot, keeping their eyes peeled. They came shortly after they got word of the raid, but Cortez said they were too late.\nHe drove from Bellflower, roughly 10 miles south of Huntington Park, in hopes of helping the \u201chardworking men\u201d who were being targeted by immigration officials.\n\u201cI\u2019ll put my life at risk because I\u2019ve got papers. I was born here, so if I\u2019m able to help somebody, of course I\u2019ll help them,\u201d said the 23-year-old, who works in construction and frequents Home Depot locations himself to find jobs.\n\u201cIt is a little scary being out here, but that\u2019s what being brave\u2018s about,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing brave is when you\u2019re scared. And I\u2019m being brave for my people.\u201d\nTimes staff writer Ruben Vives contributed to this report."

      "text": "RFK Jr.\u2019s cancellation of mRNA vaccine research is even worse than it first seemed\n- Share via\nOn first glance, the data that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. cited to justify canceling some $500 million in federal grants for mRNA vaccine research looked impressive.\nThe data, according to the agency, were embodied in some 400 research papers listed in a compilation that ran to 181 pages. The document was headlined \u201cCOVID-19 mRNA \u2018vaccine\u2019 harms research collection.\u201d\n\u201cAfter reviewing the science and consulting top experts at NIH and FDA,\u201d Kennedy said on a video posted on X, referring to the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration, \u201cHHS has determined that mRNA technology poses more risk than benefits\u201d for respiratory viruses such as COVID-19 and flu. \u201cWe reviewed the science, listened to the experts, and acted,\u201d he wrote in an accompanying post.\nI can say unequivocally that this was the most dangerous public health decision I have ever seen made by a government body.\n\u2014 Michael Osterholm, University of Minnesota\nIs that so? A close look at the so-called data reveals that the vast majority of the cited papers \u2014 all but about 40 \u2014 have little or nothing to do with the vaccines. They concern the consequences of COVID-19 infection, not the shots.\nMany of the papers that do reference the vaccines are studies not of human subjects, but laboratory mice; in some of these studies the mice received the vaccines via injections directly into the brain or intravenously, which is not how people receive the vaccines.\nWhat\u2019s also important is the lack of evidence supporting the agency\u2019s claims. The data packet fails to include well-researched studies attesting to the safety and efficacy of the mRNA vaccines, including some published very recently. Among those is an exhaustive study by Danish researchers of more than 1 million recipients of the latest mRNA COVID booster, published July 28.\nThat study investigated the incidence of 29 potential adverse side effects from the vaccine, including heart, liver and kidney failure; neurological conditions; diabetes; and arthritis. It found \u201cno statistically significant risk\u201d of any of them from the vaccine.\nThat includes myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle that is often cited by anti-vaccine agitators as a dangerous side effect of the mRNA vaccines. That condition was most commonly seen among young men, particularly if they had received two shots within a short time span. But for the most part it was mild and short-term; once the booster was reformulated after 2022, the effect appeared to disappear.\nRFK Jr. turned the CDC\u2019s vaccine committee into an anti-vaccine panel, but it still heard evidence that his campaign against vaccinating pregnant women was a huge mistake.\nNo deaths from the condition were known to have occurred, and myocarditis effects were more common and serious among unvaccinated people infected with COVID.\nNor did the agency\u2019s data packet include an estimate of lives saved by the COVID vaccines, led by Stanford epidemiologist John P.A. Ioannidis and published July 25. That study calculated that from the beginning of the global vaccination campaign in 2020 through September 2024 as many as 4 million lives were saved by the vaccines.\nIoannidis acknowledged that his estimate is \u201cconservative.\u201d Indeed, in 2022 the Commonwealth Fund estimated that in just the first two years the vaccines were available, the shots prevented more than 18 million hospitalizations and more than 3 million COVID-related deaths in the U.S. alone. A 2022 study in The Lancet, a British medical journal, estimated as many as 20 million COVID-related lives saved around the world in just the first year of vaccination.\nWeigh those figures against Kennedy\u2019s assertion that the mRNA vaccines pose \u201cmore risks than benefits,\u201d and it becomes evident that decision-making has gone seriously awry at the Department of Health and Human Services under Kennedy\u2019s leadership.\nTo Jake Scott, an infectious disease expert at Stanford Medical School who painstakingly examined the agency\u2019s data citations, they point to \u201ctextbook confirmation bias\u201d\u2014the quest for information that confirms someone\u2019s preexisting beliefs. In this case, that someone is Kennedy, whose record of anti-vaccine advocacy is indisputable.\nThe mismatch between the data packet cited by Kennedy and the established facts of the vaccines\u2019 safety and efficacy explain why Kennedy\u2019s cancellation of 22 contracts supporting mRNA vaccine research has been greeted by experts as a senseless and devastating blow against science and public health.\n\u201cI have have been in this business for over 50 years on the front lines of public health,...and I can say unequivocally that this was the most dangerous public health decision I have ever seen made by a government body,\u201d Michael Osterholm, an expert in infectious diseases at the University of Minnesota, told PBS.\nHHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. places anti-vaxxers in control of U.S. vaccine policy, slandering an actual expert along the way.\nAt the very least, if Kennedy is so convinced that the effects mRNA vaccines are not sufficiently well-understood, the solution is more research, not less. I asked Kennedy\u2019s department to respond to criticism of his decision, but received no response.\nA few words about the mRNA technology.\nUsing messenger RNA as an intermediary in their actions, the vaccines instruct the body how to manufacture parts of a pathogen that its immune system can recognize and fight. For immunologists, the virtues of the new technology are manifest. Vaccines to combat new pathogens or new versions of existing pathogens can be engineered quickly, allowing them to be rolled out to stifle pandemics before they even emerge.\nThe potential utility of mRNA vaccines is unprecedentedly broad. The possible targets under study today \u2014 including in some of the research contracts Kennedy cancelled \u2014 include flu, HIV, hepatitis C, malaria, tuberculosis, and cancer, Drew Weissman of the University of Pennsylvania and other scientists told Nature in 2021. Weissman shared the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine with Katalin Karik\u00f3 in 2023 for their work on mRNA vaccines.\nIn the U.S., the development of the mRNA COVID vaccine was sponsored by $2.5 billion in grants and purchase guarantees from the federal government to Moderna, one of the two drugmakers that brought out the COVID vaccines, partially through Operation Warp Speed, an R&D effort under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA.\nPutting enemies of science in charge of science policy is a formula for mass injury and death, history reminds us.\nThat\u2019s the agency that Kennedy has ordered to cancel the mRNA contracts. President Trump bragged about the achievement during his first term, but reversed course after the vaccines became the target of fearmongering from the right-wing and the anti-vaccine camp.\nKennedy\u2019s video on X explaining his decision was replete with fundamental misconceptions about the vaccines, according to scientists and real-world data.\n\u201cAs the pandemic showed us, mRNA vaccines don\u2019t perform well against viruses that infect the upper respiratory tract,\u201d he said. But that\u2019s plainly contradicted by the record of lives saved and hospitalizations averted. Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which falls under Kennedy\u2019s jurisdiction, show that the average weekly COVID case rate in late 2020 was 347.8 per 100,000 population among the unvaccinated, but 25 per 100,000 among the fully vaccinated and boosted population. The weekly average death rate in the same period was 7.8 among the unvaccinated and 0.1 among the vaccinated.\nHe claimed that the vaccines promote the mutation of COVID; \u201cone mutation, and the vaccine becomes ineffective,\u201d Kennedy said. Neither of those statements is supported by science.\n\u201cMRNA vaccines do not cause the virus to mutate \u2014 they do that all on their own,\u201d writes Steven Novella, a neurologist and veteran misinformation debunker. \u201cWhat causes new variants to arise more quickly is allowing a virus to spread uninhibited throughout a population \u2014 the more it replicates, the more opportunities there are for new mutations. Widespread vaccination therefore decreases new mutations and variants.\u201d\nMoreover, no \u201cone mutation\u201d causes the vaccines to become ineffective; as vaccinologist Peter Hotez observes, in no known case has a single mutation rendered the vaccine ineffective. Boosters developed for COVID variants have remained relatively effective even as new variants become dominant. Anyway, the virtue of mRNA technology is that the vaccine can be rapidly retooled to meet the challenge of new variants.\nFlorida Surgeon Gen. Dr. Joseph A. Ladapo is advising people to avoid the most effective COVID vaccines, just as a surge in disease cases gets worse.\nThat brings us to the data package Kennedy\u2019s agency offered to defend his decision.\nIt\u2019s not the product of U.S. government scientists, although one of its developers, Steven Hatfill, is currently on the HHS staff. Its other chief compilers are identified as Martin Wucher, a dentist ; Byram Bridle, a faculty member at a Canadian veterinary college; and Erik Sass, a nonfiction author.\nI reached out to all three for comment but received no reply. The compilation originated as material for a book titled \u201cTOXIC SHOT: Facing the Dangers of the COVID \u2018Vaccines\u2019,\u201d an anthology of essays by prominent anti-vaxxers.\nThe compilation doesn\u2019t make the case for canceling the research. A paper listed as support for the myocarditis threat, for example, states, \u201cno causality can be assumed or established\u201d linking the condition to the vaccine because of the lack of a control group for comparison. \u201cThere is no direct evidence of a vaccine-induced inflammatory response\u201d to the vaccine.\nKennedy\u2019s action is almost certain to hamstring American science for years, possibly decades, to come. It\u2019s the antithesis of Trump\u2019s claim to put \u201cAmerica First,\u201d for it cedes the development of a life-saving medical technology to Europe and China. And it\u2019s not limited to the development of vaccines for respiratory diseases.\nDuring a recent appearance on a podcast hosted by the right-wing influencer Steve Bannon, the newly-appointed commissioner of the National Institutes of Health, Jay Bhattacharya, declared, \u201cAs far as public health goes for vaccines, the mRNA platform is no longer viable.\u201d\nBhattacharya justified this statement by noting a rise in public skepticism about mRNA technology. What he didn\u2019t say was that the skepticism was promoted by Kennedy and other anti-vaxxers denigrating the technology; a competent and responsible NIH chief would be defending a technological innovation, not magnifying disinformation about it.\nThe truth is that the mRNA platform is likely to be seen in retrospect as a historic advance in healthcare ... everywhere but in the United States.\nMore to Read\nInsights\nL.A. Times Insights delivers AI-generated analysis on Voices content to offer all points of view. Insights does not appear on any news articles.\nPerspectives\nThe following AI-generated content is powered by Perplexity. The Los Angeles Times editorial staff does not create or edit the content.\nIdeas expressed in the piece\nThe author argues that Kennedy\u2019s justification for canceling mRNA vaccine research is fundamentally flawed, asserting that the vast majority of the 400 research papers cited in the agency\u2019s 181-page compilation have little or nothing to do with vaccines themselves but instead concern the consequences of COVID-19 infection[1]. Furthermore, the author contends that many studies that do reference vaccines involved laboratory mice that received injections directly into the brain or intravenously, which differs significantly from how humans receive the vaccines.\nThe author emphasizes that Kennedy\u2019s data package fails to include well-researched studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of mRNA vaccines, including recent research such as a Danish study of over 1 million booster recipients that found no statistically significant risk of 29 potential adverse effects. Additionally, the author cites estimates showing the vaccines saved as many as 4 million lives globally and prevented over 18 million hospitalizations and 3 million deaths in the U.S. alone during their first two years of availability.\nThe author characterizes Kennedy\u2019s approach as exhibiting \u201ctextbook confirmation bias\u201d and describes the decision as \u201cthe most dangerous public health decision\u201d ever made by a government body, according to infectious disease expert Michael Osterholm[1]. Moreover, the author argues that if Kennedy has concerns about mRNA vaccine effects, the appropriate response would be more research rather than less.\nThe author contends that Kennedy\u2019s claims about mRNA vaccines are scientifically inaccurate, particularly his assertions that the vaccines don\u2019t perform well against upper respiratory tract infections and that they promote viral mutation. The author provides CDC statistics showing dramatically lower case and death rates among vaccinated populations compared to unvaccinated individuals, and explains that widespread vaccination actually decreases mutations by limiting viral replication opportunities.\nDifferent views on the topic\nKennedy justified the termination of 22 mRNA vaccine development investments by stating that \u201cthe data show these vaccines fail to protect effectively against upper respiratory infections like COVID and flu,\u201d and announced plans to shift funding \u201ctoward safer, broader vaccine platforms that remain effective even as viruses mutate\u201d[1]. The HHS secretary claimed the decision came after reviewing the science and consulting with experts at NIH and FDA, concluding that mRNA technology poses more risks than benefits for respiratory viruses.\nThe official HHS position, as outlined in their press release, frames the decision as part of \u201ca coordinated wind-down of its mRNA vaccine development activities under the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority\u201d[3]. This represents the agency\u2019s formal stance on redirecting resources away from mRNA technology toward what they characterize as more effective alternatives.\nNewly-appointed NIH commissioner Jay Bhattacharya has declared that \u201cthe mRNA platform is no longer viable\u201d from a public health perspective, citing rising public skepticism about the technology[1]. This administrative perspective suggests that public acceptance concerns are factoring into policy decisions regarding vaccine development priorities.\nThe cancellation affects substantial federal investments, with BARDA having previously terminated $766 million in funding to Moderna for mRNA vaccines against bird flu in May, followed by the broader $500 million cuts to various mRNA vaccine projects[1][2]. This reflects a systematic shift away from mRNA technology across multiple disease targets and represents a significant reallocation of federal biomedical research resources."

      "text": "California\u2019s economy is already getting hit by immigration raids\n- Share via\n- Even as mass street arrests appear to have slowed, economists warn that continued disruptions could hobble many businesses that rely on immigrant labor.\n- After the immigration raids started, the number of people reporting to work in the private sector in California decreased by 3.1% \u2014 a downturn only recently matched by the period when people stayed home from work during the COVID-19 lockdown.\nAs the crackdown on undocumented workers in California approaches a third month, researchers say the effects on the state\u2019s economy are already showing.\nSince early June, Los Angeles has been roiled by the Trump administration\u2019s immigration sweeps. The raids rendered some L.A. neighborhoods ghost towns, with businesses shuttered and customers few and far between, as people stayed home out of fear of being targeted.\nEven as mass street arrests appear to have slowed, economists warn that continued disruptions could hobble many businesses that rely on immigrant labor. Even those not reliant could see ripple effects, as a lack of such labor disrupts productivity and delays projects, weighing on California\u2019s gross domestic product and causing increases in food prices for the rest of the United States.\n\u201cIf it\u2019s true that we are going into a phase in which a lot of these workers are either deported, or scared enough that they won\u2019t go to work, this will be a massive impact,\u201d said Giovanni Peri, an international economics professor at UC Davis.\nHardware store chain Home Depot has become the site of several immigration raids across the L.A. area., with officials targeting day laborers in the latest crackdown.\nOf course, the state\u2019s economy is massive \u2014 the equivalent to the fourth largest in the world if it were a country \u2014 so it would take a lot to derail it. But the Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids are targeting a crucial motor to the Golden State\u2019s success. Economists and business leaders are starting to gather indicators of the actual effects.\n\u201cMy gut check is, this is bad,\u201d said Todd Sorensen, a professor in the economics department at UC Riverside. \u201cWe will need to see how these trends continue over the rest of the summer.\u201d\nOne of the first bits of macroeconomic evidence to come in suggests an unusually large number of people didn\u2019t go to work when the raids began.\nAn analysis of U.S. census data from late May and early June by researchers with UC Merced\u2019s Community and Labor Center found that the number of people reporting to work in the private sector in California decreased by 3.1% \u2014 a downturn so significant it is only recently matched by the period when people stayed home from work during the COVID-19 lockdown.\nIn the rest of the country, the number reporting to work in the private sector increased.\nCalifornia\u2019s rate of decline in work was highest among noncitizen women, with a loss of about 8.6%, or 1 in 12 women not reporting to work. But, notably, citizens also showed a marked decline.\n\u201cIf people are afraid to leave their house, they aren\u2019t spending money, which generates less business,\u201d said Edward Flores, associate professor of sociology and faculty director of the UC Merced labor center. \u201cThere should be a lot of concern for the downstream effects.\u201d\nThe flurry of immigration raids across Los Angeles in recent days has cast a pall over the historical Fashion District in downtown.\nEconomists say the work that undocumented immigrants do has a multiplier effect. Their work output generates other jobs. Take a construction site, for example. If immigrant workers are hired as brick layers, their work supports hiring supervisors, engineers, electricians, plumbers and others.\nIf the undocumented workforce shrinks, job opportunities for U.S.-born workers could dry up as well, and wages could deflate, if past studies of the effect of targeted mass raids are any indication.\n\u201cImmigrant workers are the backbone of the economy,\u201d said Michael Clemens, an economist with the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\nA June report from the Bay Area Council Economic Institute found that, based on their wage contributions to the economy alone, undocumented workers generate nearly 5% of California\u2019s gross domestic product. That proportion rises to 9% when ripple effects of their labor are added.\nWith 2.28 million undocumented immigrants living in California, they represent 8% of workers in the state. And the population has deep roots, with nearly two-thirds having lived in the state for over a decade. Their total contribution in local, state and federal taxes is $23 billion annually, according to the Bay Area Council Economic Institute.\nIf California\u2019s undocumented workers were erased from the economy, researchers calculated the state\u2019s agricultural industry would contract by 14% and the construction industry would shrink by nearly 16%. The study projects a loss of $278 billion to California\u2019s economy as the upper figure of the financial damage.\nThese numbers represent the most drastic scenario. It\u2019s difficult to know what the actual toll will be, said Abby Raisz, of the Bay Area Council Economic Institute: \u201cThat\u2019s the million-dollar question.\u201d\nHow long the raids persist matters, said economist Christopher Thornberg of Beacon Economics. Take the example of a power outage, Thornberg said. If there\u2019s a power outage for two days, that\u2019s not a loss of two days of economic activity, since people just catch up on missed shopping and other activities.\n\u201cIt is business delayed, not business canceled,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cIf the blackout goes for two months \u2014 well, now we can assume some of it will end up being business lost, and that\u2019s when the real economic impacts start to creep in,\u201d Thornberg said.\nThere are some industries in which the effects are clear, Thornberg said, citing car washes, which have been raided repeatedly.\nTwo dozen car washes have reportedly been the sites of immigration sweeps since early June. Some businesses have closed, others remain open, but are fearful.\nEarly reports from farmers are also not optimistic, with groups reporting severe labor shortages during peak harvesting season for many crops.\nBryan Little of the California Farm Bureau described how a strawberry producer in Ventura County lost most of his crop after workers stayed home. Little said these labor shortages are becoming more frequent and could drive up prices sharply on the produce California ships to the rest of the country.\n\u201cPeople were terribly upset over the price of eggs in the fall and winter,\u201d Little said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be interesting to see when you start getting prices like that on virtually every item.\u201d\nLocal hotels and other businesses that rely on tourism are bracing for adverse effects. Their customers are getting scared away by the raids. These businesses are also exposed to potential labor shortages because they are heavily reliant on the immigrant workforce.\nVisit California, the state\u2019s marketing agency, in May projected international visits would decline by 9.2% in 2025, due to negative sentiment toward the Trump administration\u2019s trade policies.\nAssemblymember Sharon Quirk-Silva (D-Fullerton), whose district covers swaths of northern Orange County, said there has been low turnout at summer concerts, area car shows and other events. She described deserted city centers in downtown Santa Ana and low foot traffic in Little India in Artesia.\nArtesia\u2019s mayor, Ali Taj, said the impact on the city\u2019s sales tax revenue is going to be \u201chorrific.\u201d\n\u201cThe message here is please stop, stop, stop,\u201d he told a news conference at Buena Park City Hall, where local officials and business leaders discussed the effects of the raids. \u201cEnough is enough.\u201d\nAmid news of visa cancellations and deportations, state and local tourism officials are increasingly worried about the potential adverse effects on travel to Los Angeles and California.\nDowntown L.A. business groups have said the Fashion District has seen a 30% drop in traffic.\n\u201cIt will help tremendously when there are reduced ICE operations,\u201d said Nella McOsker, president and chief executive of the Central City Assn., which represents the interests of more than 300 businesses, trade associations and nonprofits. \u201cThat will help at least all of us who care about downtown to be in a position [where] we can change perception and really call for people to come back.\u201d\nLos Angeles-area hotel workers urge employers to protect them from Trump deportation threats.\nThe Hispanic Construction Council estimates the country was already dealing with a nationwide construction workforce shortage of 500,000 workers. George Carrillo, chief executive of the council, said that construction projects were 14% behind schedule when Trump took office, but that lag has grown to 22% under the Trump administration, as deportation threats have weakened the workforce.\nFurther labor shortages in the construction industry, in which the workforce is 61% immigrant and 26% undocumented, will hinder wildfire recovery in Los Angeles and work on other critical infrastructure across the U.S., including levies, bridges and dams, Carrillo said. In California, major airport expansion projects are planned in Sacramento and Los Angeles, as well as new soccer stadiums and medical centers.\nUndocumented workers do not have political representatives, so the business leaders that depend on their hard work need to stand up and let the White House know the economic cost, Carrillo said.\n\u201cWhen it came to tariffs and it was affecting the auto industry, guess what, the Big Three [automakers] called the president and said \u2018You need to stop this.\u2019 And he did, and he backed off of the tariffs,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing here, but for some reason, we feel like we can\u2019t stand up.\u201d"

      "text": "As California\u2019s behavioral health workforce buckles, help is years away\n- Share via\nREDDING, Calif. \u2014 This spring, the Good News Rescue Mission, which runs the only emergency homeless shelter in Shasta County, received a game-changing, $17.8-million state grant to build a 75-bed residential treatment facility in a region where thousands struggle with drug and alcohol addiction.\nNow comes the hard part \u2014 recruiting and hiring 10 certified substance use counselors and about a dozen other staff members to work at the new site, about 170 miles north of the state capital.\n\u201cAsk anyone trying to get staff and it\u2019s difficult,\u201d said Justin Wandro, the mission\u2019s head of development. \u201cTry to get people who are willing to work in very intense, very difficult environments. It\u2019s hard.\u201d\nCalifornia has long struggled to revitalize its behavioral health system and expand its workforce to meet the needs of its residents, particularly in rural parts of the state like the far north.\nSix years ago, the California Future Health Workforce Commission warned of a \u201csevere and growing\u201d shortage across the behavioral health field, including psychiatrists, therapists, social workers and substance use counselors, and noted that two-thirds of Californians with a mental illness go without treatment. Since then, Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers have set out to transform the behavioral health system, with the Legislature dedicating more than $1 billion to train and recruit providers.\nYet, the shortage has only worsened since the pandemic, which exacerbated mental health and addiction issues for many. In April, state health officials revealed that California was short roughly a third of the 8,100 psychiatrists and 117,000 licensed therapists it needed based on 2022 data. And the state\u2019s limited training capacity is making it hard to replace the number of retiring practitioners. As a result, existing workers are buckling under the workload while patients without quick access to help during a crisis are turning to costly emergency care.\n\u201cIt feels helpless, because there is more than you can fix,\u201d said Nick Zepponi, a social worker at the Hill Country Community Clinic CARE Center in Redding. The mental health urgent care clinic is one of the last lines of defense in the fraying behavioral health system in Shasta County, where the suicide rate is more than double the state average and overdose deaths increased more than threefold during the pandemic. \u201cThere\u2019s more people than you can help that need it,\u201d Zepponi said.\nPlaying catch-up\nUnder Newsom, the state has increased funding for youth preventive care, revised conservatorship laws, and set up a court-based program to compel treatment for some of the state\u2019s most severely mentally ill residents.\nThe Democrat also championed the passage of Proposition 1, a cornerstone of his response to the state\u2019s homelessness and drug crises, saying it would add 10,000 treatment beds and housing units and increase access.\nOne of the biggest remaining bottlenecks is the acute shortage of psychiatrists \u2014 licensed medical doctors who can prescribe medications such as antidepressants as well as antianxiety and antipsychotic drugs. While the state has opened more slots for training in recent years, it can cost as much as $250,000 a year and requires 12 years of postsecondary education.\nIn 2025, 239 first-year residents enrolled in California psychiatry programs, an all-time high and up from 152 seven years ago. Yet it was far below the 527 first-year psychiatry residents the workforce commission estimated are needed annually from 2025 to 2029.\n\u201cThe investments have lagged, and because they\u2019ve been more recent, we\u2019re not really seeing as much of the fruit of those investments yet,\u201d said Janet Coffman, a University of California-San Francisco associate professor who specializes in health care workforce issues. \u201cSome of these psychiatry programs that the state has funded haven\u2019t graduated their first class yet.\u201d\nThe state has also expanded the role of other providers, such as nurse practitioners trained to prescribe behavioral health drugs and certified peer counselors who might be able to meet with patients more frequently.\nMark Ghaly, former secretary of the state Health and Human Services Agency and one of the architects of Newsom\u2019s behavioral health overhaul, said it\u2019s better to spread responsibilities among various providers, including some with shorter training timelines, to expand capacity faster.\n\u201cYou\u2019re building workforce plans around models that, frankly, aren\u2019t meeting people\u2019s needs,\u201d Ghaly said. \u201cIf we try to chase the current models today with the demand that has grown, I don\u2019t think you catch up.\u201d\nIn addition to the state\u2019s own investments, California is tapping $1.9 billion in Medicaid funds to train, recruit, and retain behavioral health workers, enticing them with scholarships and loan repayments, and helping schools fund new residencies and fellowships. But the program took effect only recently, in January, and there is the looming threat that the Trump administration could rescind the funds at any time.\nIn a statement, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson Emily Hilliard said the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has made clear that approved waivers remain in effect.\n\u201cThat said, states should not rely on temporary demonstration funding as a substitute for sustained, direct investment in their healthcare workforce,\u201d Hilliard added, saying the agency would continue to evaluate the outcomes of California\u2019s experiment, which sunsets at the end of 2029.\nHealth advocates warn that California is so behind that any slowdown in behavioral health workforce funding would be detrimental. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s move to fold the nation\u2019s mental health agency into a new department focused on chronic care and disease prevention, national advocates say, could spell trouble for program funding generally.\nUber to the ER\nKelly Monck, who lives in a pool house behind her mother\u2019s middle-class suburban home in Redding, struggles with depression. Despite having health coverage and knowing her way around the healthcare system, she often can\u2019t get an appointment with her psychiatrist when thoughts of suicide creep in.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been fighting this demon since I was 15 years old,\u201d said Monck, 38, who is deaf and has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, a connective tissue disorder that has collapsed her airway and left her reliant on a ventilator and feeding tube.\nIn April, Monck overdosed on her heart medication. Seeking help, she called her therapist, who eventually persuaded her to go to the emergency room. She took an Uber and waited in the ER for hours, she said, but there was no open treatment bed and she was released.\nRather than go to the ER a second time, Monck called Hill Country when suicidal thoughts returned the following week. She had hoped that providers there could expedite an appointment with her county psychiatrist or adjust her medications. But clinic counselors aren\u2019t licensed to prescribe medication and could do little more than ensure she wasn\u2019t an immediate danger to herself.\nIt wasn\u2019t until her mother drove her 250 miles to Stanford Medicine\u2019s psychiatry unit that she was able to get her medications adjusted. She didn\u2019t see her regular psychiatrist for two more weeks.\nMonck isn\u2019t alone. In some regions of the state, it can take patients months to see a psychiatrist, and those who urgently need help are increasingly turning to costly ER care.\nIn 2022, patients with mental health or substance use disorders accounted for 1 in 3 inpatient hospitalizations and 1 in 6 emergency room visits, state data show. In ERs, doctors can often do little more than temporarily stabilize these patients, since long-term treatment beds are nearly impossible to find.\nShasta Regional Medical Center, one of Shasta County\u2019s two major hospitals, has created a temporary holding area in the ER for mental health patients, in addition to 18 existing inpatient beds, said Brenten Fillmore, the hospital\u2019s director of behavioral health.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not how the system is designed to work,\u201d Fillmore said. \u201cThere just are not enough beds to service the need, particularly when it comes to difficult cases.\u201d\nHealthcare providers say most patients are better served in office and outpatient settings where regular appointments with clinicians could help them avert a crisis.\nThe state estimates Shasta County has about a third of the psychiatrists and little more than half the licensed therapists it needs, significantly below the state average.\nMore than once, clinicians at Hill Country have made the three-hour journey to take a client to the nearest medication-assisted detox facility, in Eureka, or farther south to San Francisco, said Brandy Gemmill, a substance use counselor. But once patients are sober, it\u2019s rare to find an opening in a longer-term residential program.\n\u201cWhat I struggle with is the lack of resources,\u201d Gemmill said. \u201cWhere do we send them? So then, they\u2019re back on the street and it\u2019s happening all over again.\u201d\nWhen patients repeatedly fall through the cracks, Zepponi said, workers like him are at high risk of burnout, something that has hit behavioral health clinicians particularly hard.\nEvery six months or so, when a slight twinge of dread starts to creep in at work, Zepponi knows he needs to schedule a week off if he wants to keep doing the job he loves.\n\u201cThat\u2019s when I know I really need time off, and I have to act quickly.\u201d\nTurning to GoFundMe\nIn 2018, the Camp fire tore through the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in Butte County, killing 85, destroying about 14,000 homes, and displacing more than 50,000 people. Within weeks, patients with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety flooded into local hospitals and doctors\u2019 offices, but few providers were equipped to help them. An estimated 40 to 60 physicians left the region after the fire, deepening the shortage.\nA group of local doctors set out to reverse the trend, and last year the nonprofit Healthy Rural California launched the state\u2019s first psychiatric residency program north of Sacramento. Rachel Mitchell, director of the program, said even with a $1.5-million grant from the state for planning, the organization had to cobble together roughly $75,000 via private donations and a GoFundMe campaign to welcome its first class of four psychiatry residents. The federal grant money they rely on for operations, administered by the Health Resources and Services Administration, has been a volatile funding source.\n\u201cWe\u2019d love to get six students per class, but at this point we can\u2019t afford to,\u201d Mitchell said. Program administrators want to tap into a more stable funding stream through CMS but must first wait for its partner, Enloe Medical Center in Chico, to recruit psychiatrists to teach and supervise residents.\nIts first class will graduate in 2028.\nMai-Duc writes for KFF Health News, which publishes California Healthline, an editorially independent service of the California Health Care Foundation."

      "text": "New 51-story apartment tower in downtown L.A. gets city nod\n- Share via\nA residential skyscraper has been approved in the South Park neighborhood of downtown Los Angeles, though it\u2019s unclear how soon construction will begin.\nThe City Council last week signed off on a proposed 51-story apartment tower at 11th and Olive streets, a few blocks east of Crypto.com Arena and the L.A. Live entertainment district.\nNew York developer Mack Real Estate Development declined to talk about the planned tower, but documents filed with the city show a tall tower with 536 rental units and ground floor spaces for bars, restaurants and other retail uses. It would have parking for 581 vehicles both underground and above ground.\nThe site at 1105 S. Olive St. is now a surface parking lot.\nWhen asked when construction of the project might begin, a representative for Mack Real Estate said the company had no comment.\nEven though demand for housing is high in Los Angeles, it\u2019s challenging to construct ground-up multi-unit housing in the current financial climate, urban development consultant Hamid Behdad said.\nWith downtown\u2019s office rental market mired in high vacancies and falling values, stakeholders are clamoring for more city support to convert high-rises to housing that would help address the city\u2019s persistent housing shortage.\nCosts have risen and grown more unpredictable on multiple fronts, Behdad said, raising uncertainty for developers about whether they will be able to rent or sell new units profitably after completing them.\nTop hurdles include high interest rates for borrowing money to finance construction. New tariffs are driving up the cost of imported construction materials while raising uncertainty about how long the tariffs may last or what new ones may arise.\nLabor costs have also been increasing in recent years, Behdad said, and the recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids have added a destabilizing effect on the construction labor pool.\nSome developers who have downtown projects approved but not built are trying to sell them to other developers or investors, he said.\nDespite myriad challenges \u2014 including a sprawling homeless population and its reputation as a sometimes dodgy place to live and work \u2014 downtown L.A. continues to defy the odds by attracting a steady stream of new residents.\n\u201cNothing is easy,\u201d Behdad said.\nSouth Park, though, is one of downtown\u2019s most vibrant neighborhoods where thousands of new residences have been built in recent years, said Nick Griffin, executive director of the privately funded Downtown Center Business Improvement District, a nonprofit coalition of more than 2,000 property owners.\nThere is \u201ca demonstrable underlying demand for housing more across the city and region, but specifically in downtown with the occupancy rate at a pretty steady 90% or so,\u201d he said.\nThe location of Mack Real Estate\u2019s planned project has already proved desirable to developers, Griffin said.\n\u201cThere have already been several significant projects built along that stretch and there are another four large-scale projects within a couple of blocks, so you\u2019re you\u2019re talking about a significant residential hub\u201d that stands to attract new residents and more development, he said.\nGriffin said he hopes developers like Mack Real Estate are getting their projects ready for market conditions to change in the next six months to two years.\n\u201cFinancial conditions are going to align themselves at some point in the not too distant future,\u201d he said, \u201cand they want to have their projects teed up and ready to go.\u201d"
