      "feedback": "Your draft is already concise and cites the source, but it needs tighter canonical‑handle mapping, clearer causal links, and a sharper watch‑list. 1) Add explicit handle tags to every claim: e.g., “a 0.5 % hike in **ust10y** (HHKTQ3JYH) cuts discretionary spending 1–2 %, compresses transaction volume and earnings 0.5–1 %, and shrinks the current P/E multiple 10–12 %.” 2) Replace the generic “Fed policy meetings” with the **fed_policy** handle and date the window as Q4 2025–Q2 2026. 3) For regulatory risk, tag the DOJ/FTC filings with **policy** and note the Q1 2026 window. 4) For crypto‑payment diffusion, tag the adoption report with **crypto** and Q2 2026. 5) Condense the paragraph into 4–5 sentences or bullet points, each ending with a citation, and eliminate any redundant phrasing (“Fed rate hike” and “Fed policy” can be merged). 6) Explicitly state the quantitative view: base‑case revenue growth 5 % and valuation upside 10 %; upside 10 % revenue, 15 % valuation if Fed slows; downside 2 % revenue, 5 % valuation if rates accelerate or crypto adoption spikes. 7) End with a confidence qualifier (“moderate”) and a watch list that lists **fed_policy**, **policy**, **crypto**, and **earnings_release**.  This will satisfy the 4–6 sentence rule, ensure every claim is evidence‑driven, and provide a clear, actionable house view.",
