  "content": "PARIS, Aug. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Renowned European third-party technical consultancy IPVF recently conducted a comprehensive value assessment of two 50MW ground-mounted PV projects in France and Denmark. The study provides an in-depth comparison of the power generation performance between LONGi's BC module Hi-MO 9 (2382*1134mm) and mainstream TOPCon products (2382*1134mm).\n\nData reveals that LONGi's Hi-MO 9 BC modules demonstrate significant advantages over TOPCon products in per-watt power yield, system costs, and particularly levelized cost of electricity (LCOE), delivering higher lifetime returns for large-scale centralized power plants. Multiple globally authoritative institutions including Enertis Applus+ have previously analyzed the field performance of BC versus TOPCon technologies, with all test results consistently favoring BC products. LONGi's BC technology is now driving a new wave of technological transformation and large-scale adoption worldwide through its superior return-on-investment value.\n\nIPVF's analysis shows Hi-MO 9's exceptional low-light performance resulted in 1,210 and 1,639 hours of first-year generation in the French projects, surpassing TOPCon modules (1,187 and 1,611 hours). Similarly, in the Danish project, Hi-MO 9 outperformed TOPCon by 21 and 20 equivalent generation hours respectively, demonstrating robust power yield advantages.\n\nSince its launch last year, Hi-MO 9 has gained industry recognition through multiple outdoor demonstration projects. Integrating LONGi's proprietary HPBC 2.0 technology featuring grid lines-free front side, the module significantly enhances power output and conversion efficiency\u2014particularly maintaining high performance under low-light conditions. Combined with its high-temperature and humidity resistance in complex environments, Hi-MO 9 has become a globally sought-after BC product.\n\nIPVF's consolidated data confirms that across all four power plants analyzed, Hi-MO 9 delivers 1.84% higher per-watt generation than TOPCon modules on average. This translates to greater lifetime energy output and higher commercial returns for BC-equipped power plants.\n\nLCOE remains the critical metric for power plant economics, where module selection directly impacts project viability. IPVF's analysis confirms that Hi-MO 9 not only increases energy yield but also optimizes project cost structures, establishing a solid foundation for maximizing lifetime plant returns. Crucially, Hi-MO 9 achieves an average 3.32% lower LCOE than TOPCon modules across the evaluated projects.",
