      "feedback": "Your draft fails the format and mapping rules: each line must be a single sentence, start with “Up” or “Down”, and contain exactly five pipe‑separated fields: “Time window”, “Driver/Mechanism”, “What to watch”, “Probability %”. Replace the current four lines with two Up and two Down items that map to canonical handles (e.g., spx, ust10y, dxy, us_core_cpi, fed_policy) and include explicit sign/magnitude ranges (e.g., “spx +3–5%”, “dxy –2%”). Cite only when asserting a specific number or fact (use IDs like Z7O1DCHS7, FAN5RYW6T, 97MD1FHW8). For the Up scenario, use “Fed cuts + robust payrolls → 2‑yr/10‑yr spread steepens by ~10 bp → dxy falls 2% → spx rises 3–5%” with a 30% probability. For the Down scenario, use “Fed holds + sticky core PCE + tariff pressure → 2‑yr/10‑yr spread flattens → dxy rises 1–2% → spx falls 2–4%” with a 60% probability. Ensure each line ends with a single probability figure and that the catalyst window (Fed meeting 16‑17 Sep 2025, core CPI 15 Sep 2025, September payrolls) is clearly listed in the “What to watch” field. Remove duplicate or vague drivers, add magnitude ranges, and correct the citation placement to meet the acceptance gate.",
