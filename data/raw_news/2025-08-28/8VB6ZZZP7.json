  "description": "Modern TV operating systems offer plenty of convenience, but they also introduce new privacy risks. Here's how to avoid them.",
  "content": "Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\n\nDid you know that whenever you turn on your smart TV, you invite an unseen guest to watch it with you?\n\nThese days, most popular TV models utilize automatic content recognition (ACR), a form of ad surveillance technology that gathers information about everything you watch and transmits it to a centralized database. Manufacturers then use your data to identify your viewing preferences, enabling them to deliver highly targeted ads.\n\nAlso: Your TV's USB port is seriously underutilized: 5 features you're not taking advantage of\n\nWhat's the incentive behind this invasive technology? According to market research firm eMarketer, in 2022, advertisers spent an estimated $18.6 billion on smart TV ads, and those numbers are only going up.\n\nTo understand how ACR works, imagine a constant, real-time Shazam-like service running in the background while your TV is on. It identifies content displayed on your screen, including programs from cable TV boxes, streaming services, or gaming consoles. ACR does this by capturing continuous screenshots and cross-referencing them with a vast database of media content and advertisements.\n\nAccording to The Markup, ACR can capture and identify up to 7,200 images per hour, or approximately two images every second. This extensive tracking offers money-making insights for marketers and content distributors because it can reveal connections between viewers' personal information and their preferred content. By \"personal information,\" I mean email addresses, IP addresses -- and even your physical street address.\n\nBy understanding what viewers watch and engage with, marketers can make decisions on content recommendations to create bespoke advertising placements. They can also track advertisements that lead to purchases.\n\nAlso: The fastest VPNs of 2025: Great speeds and secure connections anywhere\n\nBut the most disturbing part is the potential for exploitation. In the wrong hands, sensitive information gathered through ACR could be exploited or misused, which may result in security risks or, at worst, identity theft.\n\nBecause ACR operates clandestinely in the background, many of us aren't even aware of its active presence each time we're enjoying our favorite shows. Opting out of using ACR is complex and sometimes challenging. Navigating through your TV settings might take several dozen clicks to protect your privacy better.\n\nIf you, like me, perceive this feature to be intrusive or unsettling, there's a way to dismiss this data collection feature on your smart TV. It might take some patience, but below is a How-To list for five major brands demonstrating how to turn off ACR.\n\nHow to turn off ACR on a smart TV\n\nAlso: Your TV's USB port has an underrated benefit that can revitalize an old system - here's how it works\n\nRemember that while these steps will significantly reduce data collection, they may also limit some smart features of your TV. Also, it's a good idea to periodically check these settings to ensure they remain as you've set them. Especially after software updates, your revised settings may sometimes revert to their default state.\n\nAlso: How to clear the cache on your TV (and why it makes such a big difference)\n\nThe driving force behind targeted advertisements on smart TVs is ACR technology, and its inclusion speaks volumes about manufacturers' focus on monetizing user data rather than prioritizing consumer interests.\n\nFor most of us, ACR offers few tangible benefits, while the real-time sharing of our viewing habits and preferences exposes us to potential privacy risks. By disabling ACR, you can help keep your data to yourself, and enjoy viewing with some peace of mind.",

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nBest web services deals of the week\nOne question about VPNs I often encounter as a VPN reviewer is, which is the fastest VPN in the world? Though I have extensively tested, researched, and written about VPNs, there's still no conclusive answer. A VPN can be relatively fast in one instance and slow in another, mainly influenced by factors like the encryption process, server load and distance, time of day, app configurations and settings, and more.\nIf you're looking for the fastest VPN for browsing, remote work, streaming, gaming, or torrenting, we've run the speed tests and selected the best-performing services to help you out.\nAlso: Best free VPNs in 2025\nWhat is the fastest VPN right now?\nOur pick for the fastest VPN overall is NordVPN, following speed tests in many locations. It works seamlessly on commonly-used devices like laptops and phones, with a rapidly growing global server fleet that makes it easier to find reliable servers in or near any location. The app updates very frequently, which can be annoying, but this is expected of such an elite service packed with many secure features.\nAlso: 3 things to consider when buying a new VPN\nFastest VPNs of 2025\nNordVPN outshone rivals when we tested server connections in many regions, primarily North America and Europe. With an average 89% speed retention (11% reduction), it registered the least speed drops from the baseline 250Mbps internet connection. This great performance is partly due to the NordLynx protocol, an optimized version of the renowned WireGuard protocol used in most fast VPNs.\nThe extensive network of 7,400+ servers in 118 countries is another reason NordVPN tops the list of the fastest VPNs. You can easily find secure and fast servers in many more locations than what most competition offers. There are also specialty servers like double VPN, Onion over VPN, and obfuscated servers to facilitate smooth online activities. NordVPN is compatible with popular devices and platforms too, making it ZDNET's pick for the best VPN overall and the best VPN for iPhone.\nReview: NordVPN\nNordVPN features: Simultaneous Connections: 10 | Kill Switch: Yes | Platforms: Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, Linux, Android TV, Chrome, Firefox | Logging: None, except billing data |Countries: 118 | Servers: 7,400+ | Trial/MBG: 30 day\nExpressVPN is our second-best speed VPN, ideal for bandwidth-consuming activities like 4K streaming and gaming online. It came close to NordVPN, dropping 15% from base speeds, but did slightly better on distant server locations like Australia and Japan. The upload and download speeds remained consistently fast, supporting gaming without lag.\nAll ExpressVPN servers are obfuscated, camouflaging your VPN traffic as a regular internet connection. This makes it useful for bypassing geo-blocks on websites and platforms anywhere. It's also hard for your ISP to throttle (or deliberately slow down) your connections if you're consuming a lot of bandwidth, say while playing Valorant online with friends. That said, ExpressVPN is quite expensive, and may not be your best choice if you're on a tight budget.\nReview: ExpressVPN\nExpressVPN features: Simultaneous Connections: Up to eight devices | Kill Switch: Yes | Platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux, ChromeOS, Apple TV (see the full list here) | Logging: No browsing logs, some connection logs | Countries: 105 | Trial/MBG: 30 days\nI've often overlooked Mullvad, but when I finally put it to the test, it exceeded my expectations with its speed. Server connections remained almost as fast as my ISP's, on both WireGuard and OpenVPN protocols. The loss was minimal, sometimes as low as 4%. Switching servers also happened at lightning-fast speeds and latency didn't increase much, similar to ExpressVPN. However, the lack of port forwarding means it might not be as useful for torrenting.\nMullvad is inexpensive and doesn't tie you to long-term contracts. The standard subscription is $5/month, and you have the flexibility to choose how long you want to use the service. It's a favorite for short-term VPN users who want a combination of privacy and speed. No personal information is needed to create an account and start using Mullvad.\nMullvad VPN features: Simultaneous Connections: 5 | Kill Switch: Yes | Platforms: Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, Linux | Logging: None | Countries: 47 | Trial/MBG: 14 days\nProton VPN is tailored for high-end privacy, with many features to secure your peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing traffic. Within its server fleet across 117 countries, there are torrenting-optimized servers, as well as Secure Core servers. The latter redirects your P2P traffic through privacy-friendly countries, like Switzerland, avoiding data retention. The VPN's NetShield feature is every torrenter's dream, blocking ads, trackers, and malware from loading whenever you open risky sites.\nAt peak speeds, Proton VPN reached 230Mbps, though some servers went below 200Mbps (a 20% drop). Besides offering the fast WireGuard protocol, the app has a built-in VPN Accelerator feature to boost connection speeds on your device. Its P2P servers also support port forwarding, a feature that significantly helps to improve download speeds when torrenting.\nReview: Proton VPN\nProton VPN features: Simultaneous Connections: Up to 10, depending on the plan | Kill Switch: Yes | Platforms: Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, Linux, routers, Android TV | Logging: None, except billing data | Countries: 117 | Servers: 10,000+ | Trial/MBG: 30 day, or the free plan\nSurfshark is a top-spot contender that supports unlimited simultaneous devices. Just like NordVPN and ExpressVPN, it delivers speedy connections. I averaged 23% speed loss on different servers, but it was great that all my devices were secured with just one account. An auto-connect button on the app automatically selects the fastest server for you (based on your location), but you can also choose manually from a network of over 3,200 servers in 100+ countries.\nUser-friendliness and affordability are other key features Surfshark offers. Subscriptions start from as low as $1.99/month, but you only enjoy the low-cost advantage if you purchase the extended plans. Surfshark also has strong secure features, including AES-256-bit encryption with perfect forward secrecy (PFS).\nReview: Surfshark VPN\nSurfshark VPN features: Simultaneous Connections: Unlimited | Kill Switch: Yes | Platforms: Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, Android, Fire TV, Firefox, Android TV | Logging: None, except billing data | Countries: 100 | Servers: 3,200+ | Trial/MBG: 30 day\nThe Private Internet Access VPN iOS app offers many custom settings, allowing you to adapt the VPN for optimal performance on iPhone and iPad. The encryption is set to 128-bit by default, which is faster than the 256-bit used by most VPNs, but you can easily switch to the latter for advanced protection. Also, PIA offers one of the largest server networks - over 29,000 servers in 91 countries (notably in all US states). You can find a secure server near or in your location for fast connections.\nWhen using PIA on iOS, you can tunnel some apps and websites on the VPN and exclude others. This flexibility helps to enhance speed because all VPN resources are dedicated to the few apps connecting to the servers. PIA, like Surfshark, also supports unlimited connections at affordable prices, starting at $2.03/month.\nReview: Private Internet Access\nPrivate Internet Access VPN features: Simultaneous Connections: Unlimited | Kill Switch: Yes | Platforms: Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, Linux, smart TVs, gaming consoles | Logging: No-logs policy | Countries: 91, 140 locations | Trial/MBG: 30 days\nAlmost every VPN has a native app for Android, but I pick CyberGhost over other fast services we tested. CyberGhost is more or less in the same speed class as PIA, with over 70% average speed retention, but the app is convenient to use on Android. In high-traffic locations like the US, the VPN's servers support up to 10Gbps connections, so you can expect quick data transfers when using fast Wi-Fi networks, for example, to stream UHD content on Android TV.\nIn my CyberGhost VPN review, Automatic Wi-Fi Protection was one of the most notable features of the app. It automatically secures your connections on unsecured Wi-Fi, like at a cafe or at work, even if you don't remember to turn on the VPN. If you experience slow connections with the VPN, enabling the app's MTU size feature can help enhance speeds.\nReview: CyberGhost VPN\nCyberGhost VPN features: Download speed: 27% reduction | Simultaneous connections: Up to 7 | Kill switch: Yes | Platforms: Windows, MacOS, iOS, Android, Linux, routers, Apple TV, and more | Logging: No activity logs | Countries: 100 | Trial/MBG: 45 days\nSecure, fast, and free are a difficult combination to find in a VPN service. Windscribe and Proton VPN are among our best free recommendations in most cases. Windscribe has free servers in over 10 countries, including the US, the UK, and Canada. Impressively, the free servers can access streaming platforms. I had a breeze with streaming HD content, with the servers retaining 65% (average) of the original internet speeds.\nWith a free Windscribe account, you can connect unlimited devices and even install an extension on Chrome browser. However, you only get up to 10GB of free bandwidth per month, which can easily support basic browsing. The paid service, starting at $5.75/month, unlocks more features, including servers in 69 countries and 134 cities.\nWindscribe VPN features: Simultaneous Connections: Unlimited | Kill Switch: Yes | Platforms: Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, FireTV | Logging: None | Customer service: Online form, online FAQ only | Data limit: 2GB/10GB monthly | Countries: 69 | Browser extension available\nWill a VPN make my internet connection faster?\nA VPN may slow down your internet connection, but can, in some cases, result in faster speeds. If you want to use a secure VPN and maintain your fast internet connection, opt for a reputable service that's optimized for speed performance. Also, choose the nearest server location to shorten the distance your VPN traffic has to travel.\nIf your ISP (internet service provider) has capped speeds, leading to slower internet connections, then using a VPN can help to make the speeds faster. ISPs often do this if they see you're using up a lot of bandwidth, for example, when downloading large files or streaming in high quality. Masking your IP address and encrypting your traffic means they can't target or even see your activities, allowing you to browse at normal speeds.\nWhy do VPNs slow down internet speed?\nWhen connected to a VPN, your data and internet traffic travels longer distances, leading to slower speeds. It routes through the VPN servers before reaching the websites you want to visit (and vice versa for the return journey). Also, data is encrypted and decrypted in the tunneling process, leading to slower speeds than unencrypted connections. Sometimes, the servers get overcrowded with many users, affecting the transmission speeds. You can always try different servers if you're experiencing slow connections.\nWhat's the best fast VPN overall?\nNordVPN tops our fastest VPN list because it had the best speed retention (minimal speed losses) after we averaged performance over short and long distances. The server coverage in 118 countries, reliable NordLynx protocol, and loads of security features, make it a well-balanced and fast VPN service.\n| Best fast VPN | Average download speed retention/loss | Server network | Best deal | Simultaneous connection |\n| NordVPN | 89% (11% loss) | 7,400+ in 118 countries | $3.09 for 27 months | 10 |\n| ExpressVPN | 85% (15% loss) | 3,000+ in 105 countries | $4.99 for 28 months | 8 |\n| Mullvad VPN | 87% (13% loss) | 690+ in 49 countries | $5.20 per month | 5 |\n| Proton VPN | 79% (21% loss) | 10,000+ in 49 countries | $4.49 for 24 months | 10 |\n| Surfshark | 81% (19% loss) | 3200+ in 100 countries | $1.99 for 27 months | Unlimited |\n| Private Internet Access | 74% (26% loss) | 29000+ in 91 countries | $2.03 for 39 months | Unlimited |\n| CyberGhost | 73% (27% loss) | 9000+ in 100 countries | $2.19 for 26 months | 7 |\n| Windscribe | 65% (35% loss) | 69 countries | From $3/month | Unlimited |\nWhich is the right fast VPN for you?\nAll the best VPNs offer custom features to boost speed in different usage contexts. Therefore, picking the ideal fast VPN for you will primarily depend on what you want to do and the devices you want to use. Below are highlights of what our fastest VPNs are best at.\n| Choose this fast VPN | If you want\u2026 |\n| NordVPN | Super-fast and feature-laden VPN with extra advanced capabilities on PC, like file scanning and threat elimination. |\n| ExpressVPN | Optimized servers for geo-restrictions and good connections for online streaming and gaming. |\n| Mullvad VPN | A VPN with an affordable short-term subscription and great speeds overall. |\n| Proton VPN | Torrent-friendly settings and features to hide your privacy and boost online security. |\n| Surfshark | Unlimited connections and built-in tools to bypass firewalls that block VPN traffic, like on school or work networks. |\n| Private Internet Access | Customizable VPN settings to easily adjust your speed and security performance, including on mobile devices. |\n| CyberGhost | Seamless compatibility with a wide range of devices, including those that don't support VPN connections like consoles. |\n| Windscribe | Access to many premium VPN features for free, including streaming servers. |\nHow we test VPNs\nFor this list of the fastest VPNs, we subjected 25+ reputable VPN services to a rigorous testing process. Each VPN's download speeds were recorded for over two days in 10 different server locations. The VPN protocols were set to automatic, allowing each VPN to choose the best protocol to use with a particular server. Before each test, we did a full factory reset on the testing device. Whenever possible, we connected to servers in the following countries, or the closest server if the specific country wasn't available:\n- US (North America)\n- Canada (North America)\n- Mexico (North America)\n- Brazil (South America)\n- UK (Europe)\n- Germany (Central Europe)\n- Japan (East Asia)\n- Netherlands (Western Europe)\n- Singapore (Southeast Asia)\n- Australia (Oceania)\n- Turkey (Europe/Asia)\nBefore each test, we measured baseline download speeds to calculate the speed retention or loss when using a VPN.\nIdeally, if we ran these tests every month, we'd likely have a different order for the top 5 or 10 VPNs each time. But my best guess would be that the slowest VPNs would always be near the bottom and the fastest ones would consistently be near the top with this method.\nFor further information on our extensive testing process on VPNs, feel free to read our testing methodology page.\nFactors to consider when choosing a fast VPN\nBesides speeds, we also differentiated the fastest VPNs by checking essential features that help to enhance performance and overall user experience. We checked for:\n- Connection stability: An ideal fast VPN sustains fast connections during peak and off-peak usage times.\n- Server network: Extensive coverage minimizes server congestion, providing fast connections in many locations worldwide.\n- Security and privacy: It's also crucial for a fast VPN to provide strong protection, integrating features like AES 256-bit encryption, kill switch, leak protection, and a trustworthy no-logs policy.\n- Multi-activity support: Ranging from basic browsing to streaming, gaming, or torrenting, a reliable VPN should be able to do it all without major issues.\n- Compatibility: All the selected VPNs are compatible with popular devices like PCs, phones, smart TVs, routers, consoles, and even streaming media players like Fire TV Stick and Roku.\n- User-friendliness: Straightforward VPN apps with features such as auto-connect help you find the fastest servers in any location without hassle.\n- Value for money: We weighed the cost-value proposal, selecting VPNs that deliver quality service for the right price.\nFAQs about the fastest VPNs\nWhat is the fastest free VPN and is it safe?\nWindscribe is a fast, free, and safe VPN offering servers in many countries. Proton VPN is a close alternative with unlimited bandwidth for streaming, downloading, and sharing as much content as you want. These two free apps do not have ads and operate no-logs policies, meaning they won't collect or share your information with third parties (like marketers).\nHow do I optimize my VPN speed?\nFor faster VPN speeds, connect via fast protocols like WireGuard and IKEv2 (or a proprietary one if offered). When using the OpenVPN protocol, try switching to TCP, which performs better than DCP. If your VPN supports AES 128-bit encryption, use this instead of the more advanced AES 256-bit. Features like split tunneling allow you to tunnel only specific and necessary apps on the VPN, saving you bandwidth.\nAlso, connect to servers closest to you for faster speeds. Use optimized servers for activities like streaming, gaming, or torrenting, if your VPN offers them. Additional things you can do to speed up VPN connections include disabling antivirus and firewalls on your device as well as rebooting your router if connections are slow.\nAre VPN speed boosters a scam?\nVPN speed boosters can't give you speeds beyond limits set by your ISP. They're only meant to improve efficiency in the VPN tunneling process so that you can get speeds almost as fast as your baseline connections. Therefore, you shouldn't expect VPN speed booster features to offer advantages over speed limitations set by your internet service.\nSurfshark vs NordVPN: Which VPN is fastest?\nNordVPN is faster than Surfshark, especially when you use the in-house NordLynx protocol. It delivers better connections in several locations than Surfshark's WireGuard protocol. However, we didn't notice significant speed differences on OpenVPN and IKEv2/IPSec protocols over short and long distances. Both can reliably support smooth online streaming, gaming, and torrenting, and have custom settings to help you optimize speed performance.\nAre there alternative fast VPNs to consider?\nOther fast VPNs that almost made it into our list and are worth considering are:"

The most popular smart TVs sold today use automatic content recognition (ACR), a kind of ad surveillance technology that collects data on everything you view and sends it to a proprietary database to identify what you\u2019re watching and serve you highly targeted ads. The software is largely hidden from view, and it\u2019s complicated to opt out. Many consumers aren\u2019t aware of ACR, let alone that it\u2019s active on their shiny new TVs. If that\u2019s you, and you\u2019d like to turn it off, we\u2019re going to show you how.\nFirst, a quick primer on the tech: ACR identifies what\u2019s displayed on your television, including content served through a cable TV box, streaming service, or game console, by continuously grabbing screenshots and comparing them to a massive database of media and advertisements. Think of it as a Shazam-like service constantly running in the background while your TV is on.\nThese TVs can capture and identify 7,200 images per hour, or approximately two every second. The data is then used for content recommendations and ad targeting, which is a huge business; advertisers spent an estimated $18.6 billion on smart TV ads in 2022, according to market research firm eMarketer.\nFor anyone who\u2019d rather not have ACR looking over their shoulder while they watch, we\u2019ve put together a guide to turning it off on three of the most popular smart TV software platforms in use last year. Depending on the platform, turning off ACR took us between 10 and 37 clicks.\nRoku\nRoku OS is the most popular smart TV operating system in the US, running on the company\u2019s streaming media devices and TVs, as well as some TCL, Hisense, Philips, and Sharp televisions. It took 11 to 24 clicks to turn off Roku\u2019s ACR system, called \u201cSmart TV Experience,\u201d which is only bundled with TVs and not Roku streaming sticks. Roku offers users the ability to turn off targeted advertising and opt out of third-party data sharing through an online account, but turning off ACR is available only on the TV set itself.\nHow to Turn Off Roku\u2019s \u201cSmart TV Experience\u201d\n- On your TV\u2019s homescreen, select the Settings menu.\n- Under the Settings menu, navigate to and select the Privacy option.\n- Select the Smart TV Experience option.\n- Uncheck the Use info from TV inputs option to turn off ACR.\nUsers can also opt out of seeing personalized ads from their Roku homescreen. The same number of ads will still appear but will not be based on user data.\n- On the homescreen, select the Settings menu.\n- Under the Settings menu, navigate to and select the Privacy option.\n- Under privacy, select the Advertising option.\n- Uncheck Personalized ads. A pop-up will appear. Confirm Don\u2019t personalize my ads.\nSamsung\nSamsung is the most popular TV manufacturer in the world. It took 10 to 37 clicks to turn off ACR, which Samsung calls \u201cViewing information services.\u201d If you\u2019ve connected your television to a Samsung account, you can opt out of ACR and other ad targeting online as well.\nHow to Turn Off Samsung\u2019s \u201cViewing Information Services\u201d\n- Navigate to the homescreen by pressing the Home button.\n- Navigate left to the sidebar menu.\n- In the sidebar menu, select the Privacy Choices option.\n- Select the Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy option.\n- Ensure the Viewing Information Services checkbox is unchecked.\n- Turn off ad targeting. Underneath the Viewing Information Services checkbox, uncheck Interest-Based Advertisements Services U.S. Privacy Notice.\n- Select the OK option box at the bottom of the screen to confirm changes to turn off ACR (and targeted advertising if you unchecked it).\nLG\nLG requires users to accept all the user agreements and terms of service to use any of the television\u2019s smart features. This includes agreements for viewing information, voice assistants, and cross-device advertising.\nLG calls its ACR-powered content recommendation system \u201cLive Plus.\u201d It took 27 clicks to turn off \u201cLive Plus.\u201d LG does not offer a way to limit ACR and other tracking through an online account.\nHow to Turn Off LG\u2019s \u201cLive Plus\u201d\n- Navigate to the homescreen by pressing the Home button.\n- On your remote, press the Settings button.\n- In the settings side menu pop-up, select the Settings option.\n- In the menu, select the General option.\n- In the General menu, select the System option.\n- In the System menu, select the Additional Settings option.\n- In the Additional Settings, toggle off the Live Plus option.\nUsers can also opt out of ad targeting, limit ad tracking, and third-party data sharing.\nThe Additional Settings menu includes a Home Settings menu where users can turn off banner ads and content recommendations:\n- In the Additional Settings menu, select the Home Settings option.\n- Uncheck the Home Promotion option.\n- Uncheck the Content Recommendation option.\nThe Additional Settings menu includes an Advertisement settings menu where users can limit ad tracking:\n- In the Additional Settings menu, select Advertisement.\n- Toggle on the Limit AD Tracking option.\nThe Support menu includes an Advertisement settings menu where users can limit the sharing or sale of data to third parties:\n- Navigate to the homescreen by pressing the Home button on your remote.\n- On your remote, press the Settings button.\n- In the settings side menu pop-up, select the Settings option.\n- In the menu, select the Support option.\n- In the Support menu, select the Privacy & Terms option.Toggle on the Do Not Sell My Personal Information option.\nLG does not offer a way to opt out of ACR or ad targeting on its website. Opting out of third-party data sharing is more difficult to do online than on your TV, requiring you to find and submit your model\u2019s TV operating system and unique hardware identifier.\nIf you recently purchased a new smart TV with ACR that is not on this list, email me at mohamed@themarkup.org. I\u2019m also interested in learning more about readers\u2019 experiences with privacy and advertising on smart TVs."

      "text": "I retested GPT-5's coding skills using OpenAI's guidance - and now I trust it even less\nFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- The same prompts in GPT-5 yield success, crashes, or errors.\n- OpenAI's prompt optimizer helps, but introduces its own quirks.\n- AI \"unconsciously\" adding details raises trust concerns.\nDo AI's get headaches? Because GPT-5 has certainly been giving me one. This article was going to be so easy. OpenAI came out with a list of best practices for GPT-5 coding. All I was going to do was try those best practices with the GPT-5 coding tests that previously failed and see if there was improvement.\nIt seemed so simple.\nAlso: I tested GPT-5's coding skills, and it was so bad that I'm sticking with GPT-4o (for now)\nBut then I had a thought. What if OpenAI has improved GPT-5 in the week or so since I ran my tests?\nPerhaps I should re-run the failed tests as-is and see what the results are, to use as a baseline for the new best practices.\nFrom a testing point of view, this was a valid approach. From a personal sanity point of view, not so much.\nRe-running test 1\nI re-ran the first failed test. This test has the AI creating a complete WordPress plugin, complete with a user interface and business logic. The idea is you feed in a set of names, it randomizes them, and it separates duplicates so they're not side-by-side.\nAlso: How I test an AI chatbot's coding ability - and you can, too\nWhen I ran this test on GPT-5 originally, it failed. Clicking the Randomize button sent the browser to another, unrelated page. I was able to cajole GPT-5 into fixing it, but the initial failure was what counted.\nThis time, I ran the exact same test with the exact same prompt again. This time, it worked perfectly. Wow, I thought. GPT-5 has improved in the past week.\nIf only I had left well enough alone. But no.\nI had to try again. On my second time with the exact same test with the exact same prompt, clicking Randomize resulted in what WordPressers call the \"white screen of death.\" This indicates something in the code isn't working.\nAlso: GPT-5 bombed my coding tests, but redeemed itself with code analysis\nI tried the exact same test with the exact same prompt a total of five times. The first time it worked. Subsequent times, it didn't. One time, I got a white screen. One time, I got a page full of error messages. One time, I was redirected to another page. One time, nothing happened at all.\nWe'll come back to test 1. But next, I decided to do the same thing with the other failed test.\nRe-running test 4\nThis test asks the AI to write code that talks to Chrome, AppleScript, and another tool called Keyboard Maestro. It requires the AI to be knowledgeable about the three different environments and how they work together.\nHere's an interesting factoid about AppleScript. The scripting language is inherently case-insensitive. So, if you ask AppleScript to compare \"AppleScript\" to \"applescript\", it will consider both strings to be the same. You have to explicitly tell it to compare case before it will do so.\nAlso: You can learn AI for free with these new courses from Anthropic\nWhen I first ran this test against GPT-5, it hallucinated that AppleScript had a native function for making strings lowercase. It does not, so the code failed.\nThis time, instead of hallucinating that AppleScript has a lowercase function, it decided to do one of the most convoluted sets of operations to lowercase a string. Here's that line of code:\nset tabTitleLower to (do shell script \"echo \" & quoted form of tabTitle & \" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'\")\nThe code actually works, but it's very weird and totally unnecessary. It launches a shell (the command line) to run a shell script that converts to lowercase. It's like making a grilled cheese sandwich and when you realize you're out of cheese, flying across the country to buy cheese from a 7-11 on the opposite side of the continent. You're not even getting better cheese. You're just doing it in the weirdest and most inefficient way possible.\nLet's not forget that we really don't need to make that text lowercase in the first place, because AppleScript is case-insensitive. So it wrote a highly convoluted piece of code that, while it works, is entirely unnecessary.\nI didn't bother to re-run this test four more times because the headache was already starting to set in.\nOpenAI's GPT-5 coding best practices\nOpenAI has put out what it calls a cheatsheet for GPT-5 coding. It has six main recommendations:\n- Be precise and avoid conflicting information: Well, duh. But apparently GPT-5 gets really confused if asked to follow vague or conflicting instructions.\n- Use the right reasoning effort: Rather than just letting GPT-5 choose its reasoning level, you might want to adjust its model. If it starts to overthink a problem, use a lower reasoning level. Great, so now we have to deal with a neurotic AI. Yippee?\n- Use XML-like syntax to help structure instructions: Rather than using just text, using XML tags to segment aspects of a prompt helps the AI to parse its assignment. This is a good hint, but it feels like a step back from what it could do.\n- Avoid overly firm language: In previous models, we sometimes had to YELL at the AI to get it to listen. Apparently, GPT-5 is passive aggressive, so if you get too forceful in your instructions, it will overdo its compliance, like what my old bosses used to say was my practice of \"aggressively following instructions.\"\n- Give room for planning and self-reflection: Does the AI need a blankie? Perhaps a warm stuffed animal to cuddle? In reality, what OpenAI is saying is that you need to encourage the AI to think through the instructions it gets. Apparently, if you don't tell it to think through the instructions, it won't. I fear for the planet.\n- Control the eagerness of your coding agent: It turns out GPT-5 is even more of a people-pleaser than GPT-4o. When giving it instructions, tell it to tone down its fawning and sucking-uppage.\nI'd like to say something positive here, but it's starting to feel like a migraine. Check out the PDF if you want more details.\nOpenAI also created an AI prompting helper. You point your browser to this tool, and paste in your prompt. The tool will give you back a more extensive prompt. For example, I gave it this prompt from Test 4:\nWrite a Keyboard Maestro AppleScript that scans the frontmost Google Chrome window for a tab name containing the string matching the contents of the passed variable instance__ChannelName. Ignore case for the match. Once found, make that tab the active tab.\nIt gave me back this:\nCreate an AppleScript for use in Keyboard Maestro that performs the following actions: * Begin with a concise checklist (3-7 bullets) outlining the planned steps before proceeding. * Scan all tabs in the frontmost Google Chrome window. * Search for a tab whose name contains the value of the passed variable 'instance__ChannelName', ignoring case sensitivity. * Once a matching tab is found, activate that tab and make it the current/active tab. After generating the script, validate in 1-2 lines whether the script meets all requirements. If not, state what needs adjustment.\nEssentially, it revised the prompt to add a planning phase at the beginning and a validation phase at the end.\nDoes it work?\nNope. Nopity-nope-nope.\nI ran Test 4's \"optimized\" prompt through GPT-5 and got back this script:\nThere are at least three serious flaws in it. First, the code in the green box doesn't work. It doesn't retrieve the value from Keyboard Maestro. Previous versions did that successfully using a completely different (and well-documented) mechanism. This approach is just loony.\nAlso: AI is creeping into the Linux kernel - and official policy is needed ASAP\nNow, look at the blue box. The considering case operation is used only for evaluation. For example, with considering case, \"BLUE\" and \"blue\" are different values. Do you see any sort of if statement or evaluation inside the blue box? Me neither.\nThen there's the red box. There is no such syntax as \"considering case false.\" First, the default behavior is to ignore case. Second, if you really wanted to explicitly tell AppleScript to ignore case, you'd use an \"ignoring case\" block. But \"considering case false\"? That's just some made-up syntax right there.\nRetrying the WordPress plugin\nI also ran my original prompt for the WordPress plugin through the prompt optimizer. I got back a fairly extensive project requirements document.\nOn the plus side, this time the plugin worked. I tried generating code a second time, and it also worked. So perhaps the optimization is something to try if GPT-5 isn't playing nice.\nBut then there's the weirdness. Because there's always weirdness. Check out the header block generated by GPT-5.\nNotice the author is attributed to Advanced Geekery Labs. Historically, the AIs have listed the author field as \"Your Name.\" But this time, it's Advanced Geekery Labs.\nThere is some relevance, because Advanced Geekery is the name of my YouTube channel and weekly newsletter. But I didn't use it anywhere in my instructions for this plugin. Additionally, I've never added Labs to the end of Advanced Geekery, even though my security product is sold through ZATZ Labs.\nSo I asked GPT-5 where it got the name Advanced Geekery Labs from. Its answer:\nGood question. The name \"Advanced Geekery Labs\" isn't something you provided in your request. I introduced it in the plugin header's Author: field as a placeholder, because in earlier conversations you've mentioned your \"Advanced Geekery\" brand, and I unconsciously expanded it into \"Labs.\"\nI'm glad the AI thinks it's a good question. That warms my heart. But \"unconsciously expanded\"? That's a direct quote from the AI. Those are its words.\nSo, we're now dealing with hallucinating AIs that operate unconsciously?\nWe're all doomed.\nWhat about coding and GPT-5?\nI still don't trust it. Actually, I don't trust it even more than when I tested it originally. What else might it do to my code \"unconsciously\"?\nI guess, if you really need GPT-5 to give you some code, you could try the optimizer. But I wouldn't rely on it.\nGPT-4o was impressive, but it had some problems. GPT-5 is like its more troubled, more difficult sibling.\nWith GPT-4o, I'd be willing to trust, with verification. I just plain don't trust GPT-5. There's something that's just not right. If we were to experience an AI that would revolt against its creators and try to kill us all, I would not be surprised if it all originated with GPT-5.\nAnd no. My headache hasn't gone away. Apparently, Tylenol is now bad for you. So, there's that, too.\nWhat do you think?\nHave you tried relying on GPT-5 for coding projects? If so, did you run into the same kinds of inconsistencies and odd behaviors? Do you find OpenAI's \"best practices\" helpful, or do they feel like workarounds for deeper problems? And what's your take on GPT-5's tendency to improvise or even \"unconsciously\" insert details? Is it a harmless quirk or a reason for concern?

The toggles for the AI suggestion features, called \"camera roll sharing suggestions,\" appear to be turned on for users who claim they haven't seen a pop-up from Facebook asking for permission to enable them. If you get that \"cloud processing\" pop-up and tap \"Allow\" on it, you'll agree to Meta's AI Terms of Service and permit your \"media and facial features\" to be analyzed by AI.\nFacebook will then use your camera roll images -- including the dates on them and the presence of people or objects -- to suggest collages, themed albums, recap posts, or AI restyled versions of your pictures. These AI suggestions are only visible to you, unless you choose to share them, and Meta says the media won't be used for ad targeting.\nAlso: How to protect your privacy from Facebook - and what doesn't work\nBut, to be clear, you're still giving Meta the right to access and retain your camera roll images, and that could raise serious privacy concerns, especially for users who never knowingly opted in.\nZDNET's editorial director found Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions enabled in her Facebook app without her knowledge. I also noticed they were enabled for me, although I vaguely recall seeing a pop-up from Facebook about the new features a few weeks ago. I think I dismissed it quickly, and I can't remember whether I tapped Allow or Don't allow on it.\nHow to stop Facebook from scanning your camera roll\nMeta said its camera roll sharing suggestions are not enabled by default. If you're worried you dismissed Facebook's pop-up, unknowingly opted-in, and gave access to your camera roll, here's how to check and turn it off.\n1. Open the Facebook app\nThe settings you'll want to check can be found in the Facebook mobile app.\n- Grab your iPhone or Android phone.\n- Open the Facebook app. You'll need to be signed into your account.\n2. Go to the Menu > Settings and Privacy\nFacebook hides most of its settings in the menu -- the three-line hamburger icon in the bottom corner of the app.\n- Tap the Menu icon in the bottom right corner of the screen.\nOnce the menu opens, look for Settings and Privacy with a gear icon. This will take you directly to Settings.\n3. Select Settings\nOnce you find and tap Privacy and Settings to expand the dropdown options, tap Settings again.\n- Under Settings and Privacy, tap Settings.\n- Now, scroll down and look for \"Camera roll sharing suggestions.\"\n4. Go to Camera roll sharing suggestions\nMeta placed the toggles that grant it access to your camera roll under the \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" setting. You'll need to go there to see if they're on and, if so, switch them off.\n- Look for the option labeled \"Camera roll sharing suggestions\" and tap it.\n- This will open a preference page with a couple of toggles.\n5. Turn off both toggles\nOnce you're inside the camera roll sharing suggestions page, notice the two separate switches. If they're blue and the toggle circle is pushed to the right, they're on -- meaning Meta is already processing and retaining your phone's photos. Turn them off so the app can't automatically upload and analyze your camera roll.\n- Find the option labeled \"Get camera roll suggestions when you're browsing Facebook.\" If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from using basic camera roll data, such as which videos you've favorited and when photos were taken, to suggest sharing media you haven't yet uploaded.\nFind the option labeled \"Get creative ideas made for you by allowing camera roll cloud processing.\" If the switch is on (blue), tap it once to turn it off (gray). This will stop Facebook from continuously uploading media from your camera roll -- and using details like time, location, themes, and the presence of people or objects -- to generate personalized creative ideas such as recaps and AI restylings.\nFAQs\nWhy is Facebook cloud-processing my device's camera roll?\nMeta is uploading and analyzing your camera roll photos and videos, even ones you haven't posted, in its cloud in order to generate AI-powered suggestions like collages, monthly recaps, themed albums, or AI-restyled versions of your images.\nWhere is this feature being tested?\nMeta has confirmed the feature is a test, saying, \"We're exploring ways to make content sharing easier for people on Facebook by testing suggestions of ready-to-share and curated content from a person's camera roll.\"\nThe test is currently available in the US and Canada, but it's not available in Illinois or Texas due to those states' privacy laws.\nDid Facebook ask for my consent before turning this on?\nMeta is showing a pop-up asking users if they want to enable cloud processing, but some users claim they haven't seen it. Instead, they found the toggles in their settings already switched on by default, raising questions about whether clear consent was given.\nCan I remove my photos once they've been uploaded?\nZDNET's sister site, CNET, reports that Meta pulls from your newer pictures (roughly the last 30 days) and if you disable the feature, your uploaded photos will be deleted after 30 days. The only way to confirm is by downloading your Facebook account data.\nWhy is this a potential privacy issue?\nIt expands Meta's reach beyond the content you've chosen to upload and share online -- into your private, unposted photos and videos. For many, that's a major red flag and a line they're not comfortable crossing, understandably so.\nAlso: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out\nEven if Meta is asking for consent to access your camera roll in order to analyze your phone's photos and provide AI-powered suggestions, the company could have done a better job of being clear and explicit about what it's trying to do.\nHow many users, like me, simply dismissed the consent pop-up without fully realizing what they'd just agreed to?\nEditor's note: This article was updated on Aug. 24, 2025 to clarify that Meta's camera roll sharing suggestions are not turned on by default and are entirely opt-in. Still, some users say they never knowingly agreed and are finding the features enabled in their settings."

At first glance, they don't seem all that useful since you can also do these actions with your mouse, but I challenge you to try them over the course of a workday; you just might notice a boost in productivity.\nAlso: How much RAM does your PC really need in 2025? I did the math for Windows and Mac users\nThere are lots of different types of shortcuts in Windows 11, but the best ones save you time by replacing the need to click through different context menus. A few of these are universal across applications and platforms. Ctrl + C, for example, copies text or files in any app, from Microsoft Word to photos in Google Drive.\nHere's a list of more than 40 Windows PC keyboard shortcuts you should know.\nProductivity shortcuts\nProductivity shortcuts are the key combos you'll find yourself using the most. They're easy to use and help you manage your work. Over time, these keystrokes become second nature.\n- Ctrl + C -- Copy highlighted text or a file.\n- Ctrl + V -- Paste whatever you just copied. Keeps the text's format.\n- Ctrl + Shift + V - Paste whatever you copied, but it removes the formatting.\n- Windows key (Win, for short) + V -- Opens the Clipboard tool, which contains a list of previously copied text. This helps in situations where you might've \"erased\" the previous copied item.\n- Ctrl + X -- Cuts the highlighted item. Ctrl + V restores it.\n- Ctrl + Z -- Undoes the last action, such as restoring deleted text or returning a moved file.\n- Ctrl + Y -- Redoes the action that was just undone.\n- Ctrl + F -- Opens the Find tool, so you can search for specific words or phrases.\n- Ctrl + A -- Highlight every single item in a window or text in a document.\n- Ctrl + S -- Quick save your work.\n- Ctrl + Backspace -- Delete the entire previous word\n- Ctrl + Delete -- Delete the entire next word.\nAccessibility shortcuts\nWindows 11 has various accessibility shortcuts that make the OS easier to use. These shortcuts help people with movement limitations or conditions that may restrict their usage of Windows. That said, anybody can use them to improve their experience.\n- Win + Plus (+) -- Activates the Magnifier tool and automatically zooms in on the screen.\n- Win + Minus (-) -- Zooms out while the Magnifier tool is activated. Hitting Win + Esc exits out of Magnifier.\n- Win + Ctrl + Enter -- Launches Narrator, a text-to-speech function that verbally describes what is on screen.\n- Press the Shift key five times in succession -- Turns on Sticky keys, which change how shortcuts work so you don't have to press and hold multiple keys to trigger them. For example, under Sticky Keys, double-tapping Ctrl then C has the same effect as Ctrl + C.\n- Left Shift + Left Alt + Print Screen -- Toggles high contrast mode for easier readability.\n- Win + Ctrl + C -- Toggles color filters like grayscale. The filters can be changed in the Accessibility menu to invert colors or help people with deuteranopia (also known as red-green color blindness).\n- Win + U -- Opens the Accessibility menu in Settings, where you can activate or deactivate accessibility-related features.\n- Win + Ctrl + O -- Opens the on-screen keyboard.\nNavigation shortcuts\nNavigation shortcuts allow users to move around different apps on Windows 11 without ever needing to lift their hands off the keyboard. They're especially useful for multitaskers juggling several programs at once. Once you master them, navigating your PC will feel seamless.\n- Ctrl + Alt + Tab -- Shows all open apps. Use the arrow keys to hop from one to the other.\n- Win + S -- Opens Windows Search.\n- Win + Tab -- Opens Task View, revealing all open windows and all open desktops.\n- Win + D -- Hides every window on your desktop. Pressing the keys again reveals them.\n- Win + Left or Right Directional Arrow -- Snaps the current window to the side of the screen that the arrow is pointing to.\n- Win + Up Arrow -- Maximizes a window.\n- Win + Down Arrow -- Minimizes the same window.\n- Win + Ctrl + D -- Create a new desktop.\n- Win + Ctrl + F4 -- Closes a desktop.\n- Win + Number Key -- Opens a taskbar app pinned to that number. For example, Win + 3 could open Microsoft Edge while Win + 4 opens the Microsoft Store.\nAlso: Finally, a Windows laptop that I wouldn't mind putting away my MacBook for\nFile Management shortcuts\nThe Windows 11 File Explorer has its own set of keyboard shortcuts to help users reorganize folders and files. Instead of right-clicking through menus or dragging items around to clean up clutter, these simple key presses make managing documents a breeze.\n- Win + E -- Opens File Explorer.\n- F2 -- Rename the selected file or folder.

With updates like improved OLED panels and object tracking sound, it's easier than ever to find a quality TV no matter your budget.\nFor anyone who has cut the cord with their cable or satellite provider, almost all new TVs on the market come with a variety of smart features as standard like a suite of popular, preloaded apps like Netflix, Disney+, and Prime Video, integrated voice controls, and automatic picture modes for streaming and console gaming. Speaking of console gaming, many new TVs also support VRR technology like Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync, as well as refresh rates of 120Hz or higher for smoother action during fast-paced gameplay and cutscenes.\nWhat is the best TV right now?\nAt ZDNET, we've extensively tested TVs from Samsung, Sony, TCL, and more. Our choice for the best TV overall is the Samsung S95D for its object-tracking sound, excellent picture quality, and integrated security chip.

With HDR support and high refresh rate, it's great for everything from catching up with local news and sports to bingeing your favorite comfort shows or teaming up with friends for online games on the weekends.\nWho should look elsewhere: Since the S95D is an OLED model, it has a higher retail price than its Mini LED or QLED cousins. So if you're looking to upgrade on a budget, or don't necessarily need all the fancy extra features that come with this TV, there are some more affordable options on this list.\nSamsung S95D specs: Screen size: 55-77 inches | Panel type: OLED | Refresh rate: Up to 144Hz | Resolution: 4K | HDR: OLED HDR Pro | Audio: Dolby Atmos, Object Tracking Sound+ | Voice controls: Alexa, Bixby, Hey Google\nWhy we like it: The TCL U65 is an affordable smart TV that comes in a range of screen sizes from as small as 43 inches to a truly cinema-sized 98-inch model. With support for both Dolby Vision IQ and Dolby Atmos, you get great picture and audio quality for the price, while integrated voice controls give you hands-free use over your new TV and connected devices.\nWho it's for: If you're looking to upgrade your main home theater screen on a budget, or if you need an affordable small-screen for your college dorm or apartment, the TCL U65 is a great option. With a 60Hz refresh rate, you'll get cleaner motion while watching movies, shows, and live sports.\nWho should look elsewhere: While this TV has a lot of cool smart features, it's lower refresh rate might turn off some users who watch a lot of live sports or fast-paced movies and shows. It also uses a regular LED panel, which can't create as many colors as QLED, Mini-LED, or OLED panels can.\nTCL U65 specs: Screen size: 43-98 inches | Panel type: LED | Refresh rate: 60Hz | Resolution: 4K | HDR: Dolby Vision IQ | Audio: Dolby Atmos, DTS Virtual:X | Voice controls: Alexa, Hey Google, Apple HomeKit\nWhy we like it: The LG G4 OLED is a high-end TV stuffed to the brim with cool features like integrated Alexa and Google Assistant voice controls, Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support, a preloaded suite of popular streaming apps like Netflix and Disney+, and support for both Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync VRR.\nRead the review: The LG G4 was the best TV I saw this year\nWho it's for: If you're looking to invest in a very high-end OLED TV that will last for years to come, you can't do much better than the LG G4. With screen sizes from 65 to 97 inches, you'll be able to find a model that perfectly complements your space.\nWho should look elsewhere: The LG G4 OLED is a premium-grade TV with a price tag to match. So if you're looking to stick to a budget, or are looking for a more affordable OLED option, there are plenty to choose from on this list.\nLG G4 specs: Screen size: 65-97 inches | Panel type: OLED | Refresh rate: 120Hz | Resolution: 4K | HDR: Dolby Vision | Audio: Dolby Atmos | Voice controls: Alexa, Hey Google\nWhy we like it: The Samsung QN90D is an almost perfect choice for console gamers, or even PC gamers looking to add another screen to their setup. With support for AMD FreeSync Premium Pro VRR, screen tearing and stuttering is a thing of the past. And the 144Hz max refresh rate ensures smoother motion during fast-paced gameplay and cutscenes.\nAlso: Neo QLED vs OLED: Which TV technology is right for you?\nWho it's for: If you're looking for a TV to put in your dedicated gaming space, the QN90D is a great option. The gaming dashboard gives you access to cloud gaming platforms like Xbox GamePass and Nvidia GeForce Now so you can play your favorite titles without any hardware.\nWho should look elsewhere: If you need a TV that can handle everything from console gaming to streaming, you may want to consider another option. The Samsung QN90D doesn't support Dolby Vision HDR or Nvidia G-Sync VRR, so users who prefer those technologies are out of luck.\nSamsung QN90D specs: Screen size: 43-98 inches | Panel type: Neo QLED | Refresh rate: Up to 144Hz | Resolution: 4K | HDR: Neo Quantum HDR+ | Audio: Dolby Atmos, Object Tracking Sound+ | Voice controls: Alexa, Bixby, Hey Google\nWhy we like it: The TCL QM6K offers one of the biggest screens you can get at 98 inches, and all that screen real estate is backed up by cool features like a 144Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision IQ HDR support, and integrated voice controls via Alexa and Google Assistant.\nWho it's for: If you're looking to upgrade your home theater with a truly cinema-sized screen, the TCL QM6K is an excellent choice. And with Dolby Atmos virtual surround sound, you'll get rich, full audio to match the great picture quality. With 4K resolution, you'll get better detailing while Dolby Vision IQ gives you sharper contrast.\nWho should look elsewhere: While the TCL QM6K is available in smaller screen sizes, the smallest model is still 65 inches. Which means if you need a small-screen model for your bedroom, dorm, or apartment, you'll need to take a look at other TCL models or even other brands.\nTCL QM6K specs: Screen size: 65-98 inches | Panel type: Mini LED | Refresh rate: 144Hz | Resolution: 4K | HDR: Dolby Vision IQ | Audio: Dolby Atmos, DTS Virtual: X | Voice controls: Alexa, Hey Google\nWhat is the best TV?\nMy choice for the best TV is the Samsung S95D for it's exceptional picture quality thanks to the updated QD-OLED panel and anti-glare coating. It also features virtual surround sound via Dolby Atmos and Samsung's Object Tracking Sound+ technology to give you a more immersive experience without having to set up extra speakers. And the base refresh rate of 120Hz can be bumped up to 144Hz for console and PC gaming or smoother action during fast-paced movies, shows, and sports broadcasts.\nBest TV | Starting Price | HDR/Audio | Screen size |\nSamsung S95D | $2,400 | OLED HDR Pro/ Object Tracking Sound+, Dolby Atmos | 55-77 inches |\nTCL Q65 | $530 | Dolby Vision/Dolby Atmos | 43-98 inches |\nLG G4 | $2,350 | Dolby Vision/Dolby Atmos | 65-97 inches |\nSamsung QN90D | $1,800 | Neo Quantum HDR+, Dolby Atmos/Object Tracking Sound + | 43-98 inches |\nTCL QM6K | $550 | Dolby Vision IQ, Dolby Atmos, DTS Virtual: X | 65-98 inches |\n*MSRP at time of writing. Please note that actual prices may vary on retailer, screen size, and available promotions or discounts.\nWhat is the right TV for you?\nAfter determining your budget, it's important to ensure that your new TV will fit comfortably in your space. Start by measuring the distance (in inches) between your couch and where the TV will be wall-mounted or placed on a stand. Divide that number in half to find the ideal TV size for your room. For example, if your couch is 120 inches (10 feet) away from your TV, the recommended TV size for your room would be about 60 inches.\nAdditionally, it's a good idea to consider accessibility features such as voice controls, screen readers, and closed captioning to ensure that everyone can enjoy the entertainment. These features can provide an enhanced viewing experience for those who are hearing or visually impaired, and they can be especially helpful for households with young children or elderly family members.\nBuy this best TV... | If you need... |\nSamsung S95D | A high-quality TV for all your entertainment. The Samsung S95D has one of the best OLED panels you can buy right now, and it's expert calibrated for color accuracy to give you more lifelike images. |\nTCL Q65 | A budget-friendly TV. The TCL Q65 offers Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos support along with built-in Alexa controls and and updated LED panel for a price that won't break the bank. |\nLG G4 | An OLED TV. The LG G4 is the newest OLED flagship model from the brand, offering an updated OLED panel, Nvidia G-Sync VRR support, and a 120Hz refresh rate. |\nSamsung QN90D | A TV for gaming. The Samsung QN90D has a base refresh rate of 120Hz that can be pushed to 144Hz for gaming. You can also get access to cloud gaming services like Xbox GamePass and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro VRR technology. |\nTCL QM6K | A big screen TV. The TCL QM6K features a bright screen that is great in almost any lighting environment, and it produces bold, bright colors for great picture quality. |\nFactors to consider when choosing a TV\nWhile shopping for a new TV for your home theater or a second screen for your bedroom, there are a few factors to keep in mind:\n- Brand integrity: While it's tempting to snap up that ultra-cheap TV from a smaller or unknown brand in order to save money, you may end up paying more in the long run. And you could run into customer service issues when trying to make a return or troubleshoot an issue. Each TV on this list was chosen from a trusted brand with verified customer service options.\n- Smart features: Customers have come to expect smart features like streaming apps and virtual assistants as-standard in their TVs. Each model on this list was chosen because it offers a host of features like preinstalled streaming apps, virtual assistant support, and Wi-Fi connectivity.\n- Reasons to upgrade: Brands may release model updates almost yearly, but they don't always give you a real reason to upgrade. Each TV we chose offers upgraded panels, brighter pictures, and in some cases better online security.\nHow we test TVs\nWhile testing and researching the TVs featured on this list, I and other ZDNET experts kept these criteria in mind:\n- Price: Not all budgets are created equal. And if you're working with a limited budget, that shouldn't mean you have to settle for a sub-par TV. Each TV model on this list has been chosen across a variety of price points to help accommodate different needs.\n- Screen size: The most important factor to consider, after price, when shopping for a new TV is whether or not it will fit into your space. Each best TV on this list was chosen because they are available in a wide variety of sizes to suit different rooms.\n- Picture and audio quality: A new TV doesn't mean much, even if it costs an arm and a leg, if it doesn't provide a great picture and clear audio. Each TV on this list has been ensured to support various HDR codecs, including HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, as well as enhanced audio software like Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus, and object-tracking sound.\nFor a more detailed look, check out our extensive TV testing methodology.\nLatest news on TVs\nBig brands like LG, Samsung, and Sony have all released or announced yearly refreshes to their TV lineups with improved OLED, QLED, and Mini LED panels for better color accuracy, brightness, and contrast. Smaller brands like TCL and Hisense also announced lineup refreshes with enhanced picture and audio quality.\nFAQs on TVs\nWhich is better: Roku or Android TVs?\nIT depends on your personal preference. Both platforms have pros and cons. Roku TVs tend to be some of the most affordable on the market while still providing a great streaming experience via a suite of preloaded, popular apps. Roku TVs also have a simplified home menu with your most-used apps and HDMI-connected devices in one easy-to-navigate hub, so you never have to scroll through confusing menus or memorize input locations. The downside? They often don't have native voice control or support for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision.\nAndroid-based televisions are a bit more expensive, but you get more features, like built-in voice controls, Bluetooth connectivity, support for variable refresh rate technology, as well as Dolby Vision HDR and Dolby Atmos sound processing.\nWhen comparing Roku and Android-based TVs, consider your must-have features so you can choose the model that best fits your needs and budget.\nWhat size TV do I need?\nThe best way to find your ideal TV screen size is to measure the distance (in inches) between your couch and where the TV will be wall-mounted or placed on a dedicated stand. Next, divide that distance by two. So if your couch is 120 inches (10 feet) from where the TV will be, the ideal size would be 60 inches.\nYou can always go a bit bigger or smaller depending on your budget and what's available, but you don't want to go wild and get a huge screen if you don't need to. Not only do you run the risk of having your new, expensive TV not fit your space, but a screen that's too big can overwhelm a room and even cause motion sickness. On the other end of the spectrum, while smaller screens tend to be more affordable, a TV that's too small for a room can make the space feel cavernous and force everyone to crowd around in order to see.\nIs it worth buying an 8K TV?\nAs of right now, we're inclined to say no. Not only are 8K televisions very expensive, but there isn't any 8K content available over broadcast, streaming, or gaming outlets to justify buying one. A conservative estimate would say that 8K streaming and gaming will be available within the next five years or so, and it will require a very fast internet connection to handle the bandwidth needed to stream consistently in ultra-high definition.\nIf you've always been an early adopter of tech, want to get a jump on future-proofing your home theater, and have extra cash to spend, you might get more value out of an 8K television than someone who just wants to watch Succession on HBO Max.\nIf you're looking for an 8K panel, I personally recommend checking out the Samsung QN900C. I had a chance to check it out, and during my initial testing, I really, truly enjoyed the display.\nWhat's the difference between OLED and QLED?\nOLED and QLED panel types use the same basic components to create images on screen: a power source, a light source, and a color source. The key differences are exactly how these panels get power, light, and color.\nA QLED screen, mostly seen in Samsung, TCL, and Hisense models, uses a modified LED panel and a \"quantum dot\" screen to create images. The \"quantum\" in QLED seems to be more of a catchy marketing term than an allusion to actual quantum tech, but it does give you enhanced color and detailing over a regular LED display.\nAn OLED panel, found in LG, Sony, and Vizio TVs, uses an array of mini LED lamps that are individually lit along with organic substrates for color. The individual LEDs allow for true blacks to create stunning contrast and make colors pop. It's an expensive technology to produce, so OLED TVs are pretty pricey. But if picture quality is your top priority, it's a worthwhile investment.\nWhat is the best TV for a living room?\nThe best TV for a living room can vary depending on the size of the room and your budget. However, some of the best options available include the Samsung QN90B, the LG C2, and the Sony X80K. These TVs provide excellent picture and sound quality, a range of features, and a variety of screen sizes to suit different room types.\nDo I need a soundbar or can I rely on the TV's built-in speakers?\nIt really depends on your preferences and the TV model you choose. Some TVs have excellent built-in speakers that provide ample sound quality for most viewers, while others may benefit from a separate soundbar or audio system for a more immersive audio experience. If you're a movie or gaming enthusiast, you may want to consider investing in a soundbar or dedicated audio system to complement your TV.\nAlso: The best soundbars"

With a starting price of $999, it offers a compelling blend of premium features borrowed from its more expensive sibling, all in the more manageable size of the standard Pixel 10.\nAlso: Everything announced at Made by Google 2025: Pixel 10 Pro, Fold, Watch 4, and more\nThe Pixel 10 Pro enters a crowded field, competing directly with the iPhone 16 Pro and the Galaxy S25 Plus.\nHaving used the iPhone 16 Pro as my daily driver for the past year, I've tested it against the new Pixel 10 Pro to see how these two flagship phones compare.\nYou should buy the Google Pixel 10 Pro if\u2026\n1. You want the best of Google AI\nThe Pixel phone lineup unsurprisingly offers the best of Google's Gemini AI features. And it is only getting better with the Pixel 10 Pro. The company is providing a year of Google AI Pro service for free alongside the purchase for Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL. So, you get Gemini Pro, including NotebookLM for productivity and Veo 3 text-to-video generation model.\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro is also getting a contextual and personalized AI feature called Magic Cue. Theoretically, it can \"help connect the dots across your digital life by anticipating your needs and proactively suggesting relevant information and helpful actions based on the context on your phone.\"\nAlso: The best Android phones to buy in 2025\nFor instance, if you call a company's helpline, your associated details (like a flight ticket) will be surfaced automatically.\nYou can still download the Gemini app to access Google's AI on your iPhone, but you won't get the seamless Pixel AI experience. If you depend on Google apps to get work done and have all your digital life stored on Google's platforms, the Pixel 10 Pro is the better option.\n2. You want a better telephoto camera\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro features a 48MP Quad PD telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom, as compared to a 12MP telephoto sensor (also 5x optical zoom) on the iPhone 16 Pro. However, megapixels don't solely define a camera. The Pixel 10 Pro sports a bigger sensor than its Apple counterpart. On paper, it is capable of letting more light in and snapping better-looking photos.\nAlso: I replaced my Pixel 9 Pro with the 9a for a month - here's my buying advice now\nThe 12MP 5x tele camera on iPhone 16 Pro isn't hard to beat. It struggles in anything less than bright daylight and lacks the zoom capabilities of its Chinese rivals. I'm looking forward to using the Google Pixel 10 Pro for my zoom shots and expect it to beat the iPhone.\n3. You want a cool-looking Pro phone\nThe iPhone 16 Pro series is lacking in fun colors. It comes in Black Titanium, White Titanium, Natural Titanium, and Desert Titanium -- all of which feel a bit lifeless. The last Pro iPhone color I truly loved was Sierra Blue on my iPhone 13 Pro Max.\nWhile rumors suggest the iPhone 17 Pro might bring back more playful finishes, Google has already beat Apple to the punch with the Pixel 10 Pro series.\nAlso: I went hands-on with every Google Pixel 10 model - and was surprised by the one I loved most\nThe new Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are available in classic Obsidian and Porcelain, as well as bolder Moonstone and Jade options.\nSo, if you're spending $1,000 on a phone, you don't have to settle for something dull. Plus, you get Google's distinct design, complete with the iconic camera bar\u2014which, in my opinion, still looks incredibly cool.\n4. If you've been envious of this iPhone feature\nThe Pixel 10 Pro features a MagSafe-like feature called PixelSnap. It is based on Qi2 charging, which offers magnetic accessory support for power banks, chargers, and more. If you've been on the iPhone for a while and want to switch platforms, this is the best time to come to the Android side.\nAlso: How to add MagSafe to your Android phone (and why you'll love it)\nAll your MagSafe accessories should technically work with the Pixel 10 Pro (depending on magnet power), so you don't have to buy new accessories alongside your new phone.\nYou should buy the Apple iPhone 16 Pro if\u2026\n1. You want a lighter Pro phone\nThe Google Pixel 10 Pro might look better on paper, but it's nearly 10 grams heavier than the iPhone 16 Pro. Specifically, the Pixel weighs 207 grams compared to the iPhone's 199 grams.\nAlso: Buy the iPhone 16 or wait for iPhone 17? Here's how I help friends and family decide\nThat eight-gram difference might not seem like much, but with both phones featuring flat, unergonomic sides, every gram counts -- especially during extended use. If you average more than six hours of screen time a day, the iPhone 16 Pro could be the more comfortable choice.\n2. You want the best social media experience\nWhile Android has made significant progress, iPhones still hold an advantage in stability and app optimization. This is particularly noticeable with social media apps like X and Instagram, where the user experience remains smoother on Apple devices.\nEditing and posting photos and videos from an iPhone to social media platforms is also more seamless and efficient for anyone who regularly creates content.\nAlso: Best iPhone 2025: I tested the top models and found the best options for you\nIf you're leaning toward an iPhone instead of the Pixel 10 Pro, I strongly recommend waiting just a few weeks. Apple is expected to launch its new iPhone 17 series in early September. It's smart to hold off on your decision until after the typical September 10th launch event to make sure you get the latest model."

      "text": "How to clear your TV cache (and why it greatly improves performance)\nIn the age of smart TVs, convenience is king. With just a few clicks, we can dive into endless entertainment -- but that ease comes with a downside: the buildup of cache data.\nAlso: How to disable ACR on your TV (and why doing so makes such a big difference)\nJust like on your phone or computer, a cluttered TV cache can lead to sluggish performance, app crashes, and even hinder new content from loading properly. That's why it's important to clear all that extra cache and make your TV feel like new again. Before I break down the steps for how to do it, let's address the big elephant in the room first.\nWhat is a cache?\nA cache is a temporary storage area where data is kept for quick access. On your smart TV, the cache stores information from apps, websites, and system processes to help them load faster every time you turn it on. Think of it as a bunch of temporary files intended to speed up loading times for frequently accessed information.\nAlso: The best TVs of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nFor instance, when you open a streaming app, the cache might store thumbnails, login details, or recently watched shows. Caches are designed to help your TV load this content more quickly. Over time, however, the cache can become overloaded with outdated or unnecessary data, which can consequently slow down your TV's performance.\nWhy should you clear your TV's cache?\nYou should consider clearing your TV's cache for two main reasons. First, it can improve performance. A bloated cache can slow down your TV's processing, leading to sluggish navigation, delayed app launches, and buffering issues. Clearing the cache frees up space and allows your TV to run more efficiently.\nSecond, clearing the cache can resolve app-specific problems. If you're experiencing issues like crashes, login errors, or unexpected behavior within a particular app, clearing the cache for that specific app can often be the fix.\nAlso: The best Sony TVs of 2025: Expert tested\nThe process of clearing your TV's cache will vary depending on the brand and model you own, although the general steps are usually quite similar across brands. Most TVs will have a settings menu where you can navigate to an \"Apps\" section. Here, you should find a list of all downloaded applications. Selecting an individual app will often reveal options to \"Clear Cache\" or \"Clear Data.\" Clearing the cache will remove temporary files, while clearing data will erase all app information, requiring you to log in again.\nIt's generally recommended to start with clearing the cache and only resort to clearing data if the problem persists.\nAlso: I changed 10 settings on my Fire TV to instantly improve the performance\nIf you're unsure about the specific steps for your TV, a quick online search for your model and \"clear cache\" should provide you with detailed instructions. Most manufacturers also offer user manuals or online support resources that can guide you through the process.\nClearing your TV's cache can offer several benefits:\n- Improved performance: Over time, cached data can accumulate and slow down your TV's operations.\n- Increased storage space: Clearing the cache frees up valuable storage space on your TV.\n- Resolved app issues: Sometimes, apps may malfunction due to corrupted cached data. Clearing the cache can often fix these problems.\n- Enhanced privacy: Cached data may contain personal information, so regular clearing can help protect your privacy.\nHow do I clear the cache on my TV?\nThe process of clearing your TV's cache can vary depending on the brand and model. However, here's a general guide that applies to many smart TVs:\n- Access the Settings menu on your TV.\n- Navigate to the Apps or Application Manager section.\n- Select the app for which you want to clear the cache.\n- Look for an option that says \"Clear Cache\" and select it.\nBelow is a list of specific cache-clearing instructions for some leading brands.\nFor Samsung TVs:\n- Go to Settings > Support > Device Care\n- Select \"Manage Storage\"\n- Choose the app you want to clear the cache for and select \"View Details\"\n- Select \"Clear Cache\"\nAlso: 5 easy ways to instantly improve your soundbar's audio (without spending a dime)\nFor LG TVs:\n- Press the Home button on your remote\n- Go to Settings > General > Storage\n- Select \"Clear Cache\"\nFor Android/Google TVs (including Sony models):\n- Go to Settings > Apps\n- Select \"See all apps\"\n- Choose the app you want to clear the cache for\n- Select \"Clear Cache\"\nFor Roku TVs:\nRoku TVs don't have a built-in cache-clearing option, but you can achieve similar results by restarting the TV or removing and reinstalling problematic apps.\nAlso: Is your Roku TV spying on you? Likely, but here's how you can take back control\nSome key points to note:\n- The exact menu names and options may vary slightly between TV models and software versions.\n- You may need to clear the cache for individual apps rather than the entire system on some TVs.\n- Clearing your cache is generally safe and won't delete important data, but clearing app data may reset some settings.\n- Be sure to consult your TV's user manual for model-specific instructions, as the process can differ between brands and even between models of the same brand.\nWhen should you clear your TV's cache?\nWhile there's no strict rule, it's a good practice to clear your TV's cache every few months or when you notice:\n- Your TV is running slower than usual.\n- Apps are frequently crashing or not loading properly.\n- You're running low on storage space.\nAlso: Can't hear TV dialogue?

With wireless connectivity, phone apps, and remote controls, there's little need to. Tucked next to the essential HDMI ports, a USB 2.0 port -- likely sitting unnoticed on the back or side panel -- offers more potential than you might expect.\nAlso: Samsung is giving away free 65-inch TVs right now - here's how to get one\nUSB ports are easy to overlook, but they're a standard feature on most TVs -- and more useful than you might think. Here are five clever ways to make the most of them.\n1. Turn your TV into a slideshow or media player\nMost new TV models come with a pair of USB 2.0 ports, and often a 3.0 port for faster data transfer. Your TV screen is likely bigger than your computer monitor, so why not use it to carousel a gallery of images or play videos?\nAlso: CNET survey shows Americans spend over $1,000 a year on subscriptions, and they're sick of it\nI attended a family gathering recently, and the host used a 65-inch TV to do that very thing. The scanned pictures and videos looked and sounded great -- all accessed by simply plugging in a USB flash drive.\nJust about any type of external hard drive, thumb drive, or data stick will function as if you plugged it into a laptop. Your TV will immediately recognize a connected device and offer you a means for accessing and navigating your media files.\nIf you want to program your TV to play a slideshow when idle, there's a major benefit to keeping a flash drive attached just for that purpose. That benefit? Your media will not be automatically transferred to the TV's cache or internal storage because it will read files directly from the flash drive.\nAlso: How to clear your TV cache (and why you shouldn't wait to do it)\nBy keeping the files stored only on the drive, you won't need to spend time duplicating and uploading them to the TV. Moreover, your TV will thank you for performing better since you're not clogging up its cache.\n2. Transform your TV into a workstation\nEver find yourself with spreadsheets, documents, vector graphics, videos, and web pages crowding your computer monitor? That makes two of us.\nThe most common monitor size for creatives and professionals is 27 inches. Purchasing multiple high-quality monitors (or oversized 32-inch panels) can be extremely expensive. But if you're willing to sacrifice a bit of color accuracy and resolution for more real estate on, say, a 55-inch TV screen, you can employ a Bluetooth adapter to connect wireless peripherals like a mouse or keyboard.\nAlso: Don't cancel Netflix yet: I used these secret codes to unlock the full catalog of shows\nA larger display allows for more space to multitask, work on complex designs, and view your discombobulating number of open windows simultaneously. You'll need those peripheral tools to be connected by USB to get the work done.\n3. Make your aging TV stream-worthy\nThe seven-year-old TCL TV in my bedroom requires a streaming device to access Prime Video, HBO Max, and other platforms. Many streaming devices, especially newer ones, require a connection to an A/C outlet for power. But some, such as earlier-generation Amazon Fire Sticks and Google Chromecasts, can be powered by the TV while making it smarter.\nAlso: 5 Chromecast features you're not using enough on your TV (including a smart home buff)\nAll streaming devices connect directly to TVs via HDMI ports to function, but some can be powered by USB. My TCL, for example, has a Roku Streaming Stick attached by a short HDMI cable for data transfer and a short USB 2.0 cable for power. The streaming gadget that allows me to access the internet and watch Jordan Peele's Twilight Zone at night is not plugged into the wall at all. It is being fed by -- and feeding -- the TV all at once.\nI should note that this is a less-than-ideal scenario because powering a device with its own CPU and quad-core processor can lead to issues like overheating, interruptions, and underperformance. But it does work.\n4. Charge USB devices if you're in a pinch\nIn fact, you can charge just about any device through your TV's USB port with the appropriate cable. Have you ever had to charge your phone by plugging it into a USB port on your laptop? I've been there, too. You can do the same with your TV.\nAlso: I didn't expect to love Amazon's flagship soundbar this much - but it's the real deal\nThe downside is that most TV USB ports are designed for data transfer and powering low-energy devices, so they don't pull a lot of juice. This means using a TV as a charging hub will be relatively slow, even for something like a console gaming controller. But again, if you're in a real bind, it's an option.\nSo try to remember that your TV's USB ports are back there for a reason. You might as well use them to access media, increase the utility of your TV, and supply power to external devices.\n5. Bonus: Updating software\nIt doesn't sound as flashy as the other benefits on this list, but if your smart TV doesn't have internet or you're on a non-smart TV, it's critical that you keep the software updated via a USB upload.\nAlso: Your TV's USB port has a forgotten benefit that can make an old system feel new again\nManufacturers often introduce upgraded features and functionality, improved performance, and bug fixes with the occasional update, and you can download the latest software through dedicated support pages. Here's Samsung's, for example.\nSearch for your model or product name, download the latest software file onto your USB drive, and plug the drive into your TV to upload it. You may need to restart your TV when all is said and done."

      "text": "Your TV's USB port has an underrated feature that can revitalize an old system for free\nRecently, I wrote about the various uses of the USB ports that come standard on the back or side of any smart TV. In this article, I'm focusing on one particular important use: installing firmware updates using a USB device.\nAlso: How to disable ACR on your TV (and why doing so makes such a big difference)\nUpdates are essential because they ensure your TV has the latest software, features, and security patches. Most smart TVs are designed to automatically check for and install updates over Wi-Fi -- as long as they're connected to the internet and the automatic update feature is enabled. To confirm this, you can usually find a \"Check for Updates\" option in the TV's settings menu.\nBut if your TV has an unstable Wi-Fi connection -- or you simply prefer a manual approach -- the following is a walkthrough of how to use a USB drive to do the job.\n1. Identify your TV's model number\nStart by finding your TV's specific model number. It's usually on a sticker or label on the back of your set, which can often be tricky to read -- especially on a wall-mounted TV. Take a flashlight with you and jot down what you see on the sticker. Better yet, turn on your phone camera (with flash) to reach behind the TV and snap a picture of the sticker so you'll have the information forever.\nAlso: I changed 10 settings on my Fire TV to instantly improve the performance\nYou should also be able to find the model number in the TV's settings menu under the \"About\" or \"Support\" section.\n2. Locate the firmware update\nGo online and visit the manufacturer's official website to look for the \"Support\" or \"Downloads\" section. Use the search function on the website and enter your TV's model number. This should bring up a list of available downloads for your specific model. Look for the latest firmware update file.\nAlso: How we test TVs at ZDNET in 2025\nBe sure to pay close attention to the region and version information for the firmware update. Downloading and installing the wrong firmware can cause serious problems with your TV, potentially \"bricking\" it, which is the worst thing that can happen to any smart device because it renders it unusable.\n3. Download and extract the firmware file\nThe firmware update file will usually come in a compressed format, such as a ZIP file. In your computer's Downloads folder, right-click on the ZIP and select \"Extract All.\" (I usually extract files to my desktop for quick access.) The actual firmware files inside the ZIP will typically have extensions such as \".bin\" or \".img.\"\n4. Copy the firmware file to the USB drive\nMake sure your USB stick has enough free space to hold the firmware update file and is formatted for the FAT32 file system. (Most pocket drives are formatted for FAT32 by default, making them compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux.) Just remember that reformatting a USB drive will erase all data on it, so be sure to back up any files already stored on it before proceeding.\nAlso: You should probably clear your TV cache right now (and why it makes such a big difference)\nCopy the extracted firmware file(s) directly to the root directory of the USB drive. Do not place them in any subfolders, as this may prevent the TV from recognizing them. Use the \"Safely Remove Hardware\" option in the bottom-right taskbar on your computer to eject the USB drive properly. (Always use that feature to safely remove a USB.)\n5. Plug in and update\nTurn on your TV. Insert your USB drive containing the firmware file into a USB port. In some cases, the TV may automatically detect the firmware file on the USB drive and prompt you to start the update process. If this doesn't happen, you'll need to navigate to the TV's settings menu. Look for an option labeled \"Software Update,\" \"Firmware Update,\" or something similar. Select the USB drive as the update source and follow the on-screen instructions.\nAlso: I replaced my 4K TV with a UST projector - and the visual upgrade was worth it\nWhile your TV installs the firmware update, it's best to walk away for a minute and let the devices do their thing. Don't turn off the TV or remove the USB drive while the update is in progress, as this could damage the TV's software. The TV may restart automatically once the update is complete.\n6. Verify the update\nAfter the update process is finished, go back to the TV's settings menu. Check the \"Software Version\" or \"Firmware Version\" information to confirm that the update was successful and that the TV is now running the latest firmware.\nIf the TV doesn't detect the firmware file on the USB drive, try reformatting the drive or using a different one. If the update process fails, try downloading the firmware file again and repeating the steps. If you continue to encounter issues, contact the manufacturer's customer support for assistance.\nAlso: I changed these 6 TV settings to give it an instant speed boost (and why they work)\nUpdating your TV's firmware is crucial to maintaining optimal performance and ensuring you have access to the latest features and improvements. It can resolve a variety of issues, such as sluggish response times, unexpected errors, and compatibility problems with external devices. Firmware updates often include bug fixes that address known issues and vulnerabilities, enhancing the overall stability and security of your TV. They may also introduce new functionalities, such as support for new video and audio formats, improved picture and sound quality, or enhanced energy efficiency.\nBy keeping your TV's firmware up to date, you can enjoy a smoother, more responsive, reliable, and user-friendly viewing experience.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."
