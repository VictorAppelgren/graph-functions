With the integration, you can call upon Copilot and ask for movie suggestions, spoiler-free episode recaps, and other general questions.\n\nOn TV, Copilot takes on a \u201cfriendly, animated presence\u201d that resembles the opalescent Copilot Appearance Microsoft showed off last month, though in a color that makes it look more like a personified chickpea. The beige blob will float and bounce around your screen, while its mouth moves in line with its responses.\n\nCopilot will automatically appear on supported Samsung TVs, where you\u2019ll find it within the Samsung Tizen OS homescreen, Samsung Daily Plus, and Click to Search. You can access Copilot by using a voice command or selecting it with your remote. From there, hit the mic button on your remote, and you can start speaking to Copilot.\n\nMicrosoft notes that you can sign into the app for a more \u201cpersonal\u201d Copilot experience that allows the AI assistant to reference your previous conversations and preferences. Copilot is rolling out now on Samsung\u2019s 2025 TVs, including Micro RGB, Neo QLED, OLED, The Frame Pro, and The Frame models, as well as the M7, M8, and M9 smart monitors.

      "text": "Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft\u2019s AI CEO, has a vision of Copilot that involves it being so highly personalized that \u201cit will age.\u201d Microsoft has been increasingly pushing Copilot to be a personalized AI assistant, with a big redesign last year that included a conversational voice mode. Now, Suleyman\u2019s Microsoft AI team is launching a new Copilot virtual character that will interact in real-time with you.\nMicrosoft\u2019s AI CEO thinks Copilot will age and \u2018have a room that it lives in\u2019\nMicrosoft has a new Copilot Appearance virtual character that responds with real-time expressions.\nMicrosoft has a new Copilot Appearance virtual character that responds with real-time expressions.\n\u201cCopilot will certainly have a kind of permanent identity, a presence, and it will have a room that it lives in, and it will age,\u201d says Suleyman on an episode of The Colin & Samir Show this week. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in this idea of digital patina. The things I love in my world are the things that are a little bit worn or rubbed down, and have scuff marks. Unfortunately in the digital world we don\u2019t have a sense of age.\u201c\nPart of this idea of a permanent identity for Copilot is a new Appearance feature that Microsoft has started previewing this week. \u201cCopilot Appearance is an experiment that gives you a new, visual way to chat with Copilot, powered by real-time expressions, voice, and conversational memory,\u201d says Microsoft.\nSuleyman gave us an early glimpse at Copilot Appearance during Microsoft\u2019s 50th anniversary event a few months ago. It\u2019s essentially a virtual character for Copilot, to respond to queries you have \u2014 a little like how Cortana used to animate in China. Copilot Appearance will smile, nod, and even act surprised depending on the conversation. Early access for Copilot Appearance is live now in Microsoft\u2019s Copilot Labs, but it will only work for a subset of users in the US, UK, and Canada.\nCopilot Appearance is the next step in Microsoft\u2019s mission to personalize its AI assistant. Suleyman, who helped co-found Google DeepMind, joined Microsoft more than a year ago to lead a new team that handles the company\u2019s consumer-facing AI products, like Copilot, Bing, and Edge. Suleyman has quickly turned Copilot into something that closely resembles Pi, the personalized AI chatbot he was working on at Inflection AI. Most of the Inflection AI team joined Microsoft, and Copilot was overhauled months later with its voice and vision redesign.\nMicrosoft is moving slowly with the rollout of Copilot Appearance, likely because similar conversational chatbots have allegedly sent harmful messages to teens. Character.AI was even sued after a chatbot-obsessed teen\u2019s death, with the platform being described as \u201cunreasonably dangerous.\u201d AI chatbots are also being used as partners, parents, and even for dealing with the grief of losing a loved one.\nBeyond the personalized aspects of Copilot, Suleyman has also hinted that the Windows desktop might be where Microsoft turns its AI attention next. \u201cI hate my desktop,\u201d said Suleyman on the podcast episode. \u201cI look at my screen and I\u2019m like \u2018shit man I have a billboard in front of me.\u2019 It\u2019s just so noisy, so neon, and it\u2019s all competing for my attention. It just looks ugly.\u201d\nWhile Microsoft AI is improving voice and video, Suleyman says he wants a \u201cquieter, simpler, optimized working environment\u201d and that he\u2019s thinking about improving his \u201cworkshop\u201d in the future. That might be a hint at potential changes to the Copilot app on Windows in the future, or even bigger changes with Microsoft\u2019s Copilot Plus PCs.\nSuleyman said he has customized his phone UI so much to avoid distractions that it\u2019s basically a black and white theme designed to hide things. \u201cI use a little rose tint so everything else is noised out, most of the apps are moved to the left and right, and my home screen is really just two or three primary apps,\u201d he said.\nMost Popular\n- Microsoft hosts emergency press conference after protesters \u2018storm a building\u2019\n- Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 launch event is set for September 9th\n- Nothing busted using professional photos as Phone 3 samples\n- Dish gives up on becoming the fourth major wireless carrier\n- Microsoft locks down a building after protesters get inside president\u2019s office"

      "text": "LG and Samsung have both announced their 2025 smart TVs at CES this weekend, and some of them will include access to Microsoft\u2019s Copilot AI assistant. Both TV manufacturers are chasing the artificial intelligence hype train with dedicated AI sections on their smart TVs that include a shortcut to a Copilot web app.\nLG and Samsung are adding Microsoft\u2019s Copilot AI assistant to their TVs\nCopilot on TVs seems to be nothing more than a web app that links to Microsoft\u2019s AI assistant.\nCopilot on TVs seems to be nothing more than a web app that links to Microsoft\u2019s AI assistant.\nLG is adding an entire AI section to its TVs and rebranding its remote to \u201cAI Remote\u201d in an effort to sell consumers on the promise of large language models. While it\u2019s not clear exactly how Copilot works on LG\u2019s latest TVs, the company describes access to Copilot as a way to allow users to \u201cefficiently find and organize complex information using contextual cues.\u201d\nLG hasn\u2019t demonstrated its Copilot integration just yet, but it has shown off its own AI chatbot that\u2019s part of its TVs. It appears Copilot will be surfaced when LG TV users want to search for more information on a particular subject.\nSamsung also has its own Vision AI brand for its AI-powered TV features this year, which include AI upscaling, Auto HDR Remastering, and Adaptive Sound Pro. There\u2019s also a new AI button on the remote to access AI features like recognizing food on a screen or AI home security features that analyze video feeds from smart cameras.\nMicrosoft\u2019s Copilot will be part of this Vision AI section. \u201cIn collaboration with Microsoft, Samsung announced the new Smart TVs and Smart Monitors featuring Microsoft Copilot,\u201d says Samsung in a press release. \u201cThis partnership will enable users to explore a wide range of Copilot services, including personalized content recommendations.\u201d\nI asked Samsung for more information or images of Copilot in action, but the company doesn\u2019t have anything more to share right now. I\u2019ve also asked LG and Microsoft for more information about Copilot on TVs, and neither company has responded in time for publication. Without any indication of exactly how Copilot works on these TVs, I\u2019m going to chalk this one up as a gimmicky feature that LG, Samsung, and Microsoft clearly aren\u2019t ready to demo yet.\nMost Popular\n- Microsoft hosts emergency press conference after protesters \u2018storm a building\u2019\n- Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 launch event is set for September 9th\n- Nothing busted using professional photos as Phone 3 samples\n- Dish gives up on becoming the fourth major wireless carrier\n- Microsoft locks down a building after protesters get inside president\u2019s office"
