      "summary": "Stocks gained as expectations of a Fed rate cut rise, driven by falling 10‑year yields and weaker labor market data. Energy shares fell after a 2% dip in WTI, while megacap tech names like Alphabet and Apple rallied on favorable antitrust rulings. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 posted modest gains of 0.5% and 0.8% respectively, supported by lower T‑note yields and market optimism about September rate cuts. Fed officials signaled a single cut this year, and tariff disputes add uncertainty, but overall sentiment remains positive.",
