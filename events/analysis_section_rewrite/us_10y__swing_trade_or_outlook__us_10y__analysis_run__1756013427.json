      "feedback": "The draft mixes a “movers & scenarios” table with a “Long” line that looks like a swing‑trade but is not in the required format.  \n1. **Structure** – Keep exactly four scenario lines (2 up, 2 down) and a separate swing‑trade line. Remove the “Long” line and replace it with a proper swing‑trade entry/stop/target.  \n2. **Causal clarity** – Each scenario line must state a single driver, the mechanism, what to watch, and a probability that is justified by a source. For example:  \n   *Up | 1–3 mo | Q3 earnings > upper revenue guidance (SK994CBWR) | N2 adoption rate > 80 % (SK994CBWR) | 60 %*  \n   *Down | 1–3 mo | Fed rate hike or export‑control tightening (C3ODMIQKZ)(SK994CBWR) | Fed meeting outcome or export‑control announcement (C3ODMIQKZ) | 45 %*  \n   *Up | 3–6 mo | China self‑sufficiency boost + high N2 adoption (FOM34PUWA)(SK994CBWR) | China policy change + N2 adoption > 90 % (FOM34PUWA) | 55 %*  \n   *Down | 3–6 mo | CPI rebound + oil price spike (V7GV8YBQU)(J99EM2TPZ) | CPI release + IEA supply outlook (V7GV8YBQU)(J99EM2TPZ) | 40 %*  \n   Ensure each probability is tied to a specific data point or trend cited.  \n3. **Swing‑trade line** – Provide a concise trade plan:  \n   *Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100*  \n   Example: *Buy | 1–3 mo | $32.00 | $30.00 | $34.50 | 1.75 | Earnings miss or Fed hike | Q3 earnings > upper guidance (SK994CBWR) | 60 % | 70*  \n   Use actual price levels from the source (e.g., current price $31.50, consensus target $34.76).  \n4. **Citation policy** – Only attach a citation when stating a fact or number. Do not cite for generic statements.  \n5. **Quantification** – Replace vague “30.00” with the real current price and consensus target from the source.  \n6. **Confidence** – Provide a single confidence score for the trade, not separate for each scenario.  \n7. **Formatting** – Each line must be a single line with no line breaks inside.  \n8. **Remove extraneous text** – Delete the “Long | …” block and any narrative that is not part of the required output.  \n\nImplement these edits to produce a clean, evidence‑based swing‑trade or outlook that meets the section focus and formatting constraints.",
