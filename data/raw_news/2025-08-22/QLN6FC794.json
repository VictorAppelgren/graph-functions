But they were not ready for 90 minutes against Wolves, but they will be ready now.\u201d\n\nGuardiola added that Savinho, Mateo Kovacic, Josko Gvardiol, and Marcus Bettinelli were all ruled out of the game for City.\n\nThe fixture at home to Spurs was City\u2019s heaviest defeat last season as they lost by four goals.",

He has trained better in the last few days, hopefully after the international break is when he will be really fit,\u201d Guardiola told a press conference on Friday, in quotes carried by The Manchester Evening News.\n\u201cHopefully in these (opening) games he can play some minutes but what is important is he doesn\u2019t have pain because we don\u2019t want this Rodri coming back injured.\n\u201cWe try desperately to avoid that. He has been training the last two sessions with us and that\u2019s good.\u201d\nRodri suffered an ACL injury in City\u2019s 2-2 draw with Arsenal in September 2024 and did not return to action until their penultimate league game of last season, against Bournemouth in May.\nCity were top of last season\u2019s fledging Premier League table when Rodri was injured but, without him, the defending champions won just once in 13 games between October 30 and Boxing Day, eventually finishing third \u2013 13 points behind title-winners Liverpool.\n(Photo: Michael Regan/Getty Images)"
