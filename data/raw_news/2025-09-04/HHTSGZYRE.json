  "description": "Rory McIlroy reacted to Sergio Garcia's Ryder Cup withdrawal, expressing disappointment and support during Irish Open media rounds.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nWith just three weeks to go until the Ryder Cup tees off at Bethpage Black, the excitement is in the air, especially after both teams declared their squads of 12.\n\nBut one name that won't be there is Sergio Garcia, and his absence is stirring emotions far beyond the leaderboard.\n\nPONTE VEDRA BEACH, FLORIDA - MARCH 11: Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland talks to Sergio Garcia of Spain during the first round of THE PLAYERS Championship on THE PLAYERS Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass on... PONTE VEDRA BEACH, FLORIDA - MARCH 11: Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland talks to Sergio Garcia of Spain during the first round of THE PLAYERS Championship on THE PLAYERS Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass on March 11, 2021 in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. (Photo by Sam Greenwood/Getty Images)\n\nGarcia, the Ryder Cup's all-time leading scorer, withdrew from this week's Amgen Irish Open at The K Club after being left off Luke Donald's final 12-man roster.\n\nThe Spaniard quietly stepped away from competition and instead made a surprise appearance at the US Open tennis quarterfinals in New York.\n\nBack in Ireland, McIlroy, who automatically qualified for Team Europe and will make his eighth Ryder Cup appearance, shared his thoughts on Garcia's absence.\n\n\"He was supposed to be here,\" McIlroy told reporters, as quoted by Golf Magic, reflecting on their long-standing friendship. \"It would have been great for the tournament if Sergio played.\"\n\nThe green jacket winner, who served as a groomsman at Garcia's wedding in 2017, acknowledged the disappointment but stood by Donald's decision.\n\n\"Luke has assembled a very strong 12 players, and I think it's the right 12 players,\" McIlroy expressed during the same conversation. \"I'm sure Sergio (Garcia) is disappointed, but at the same time, I'm sure he wishes Europe well.\"\n\nDonald himself addressed the situation, noting that Garcia's form and scheduling choices played a role in the decision.\n\n\"I think Sergio's disappointed like all of the others that felt like they might have a chance to make the team,\" Donald expressed further. \"I don't tell people what to do with their schedules unless it's really close.\n\n\"He fully understands that the Irish were after the qualification finish, after the team was picked. Unfortunately, I just felt like his form wasn't quite good enough to make the team that was full of so many people playing well.\"\n\nAs of now, in Thursday's opening round at the Irish Open, McIlroy carded a 1-under 71. He started strong with four birdies on his first nine holes but faded late, bogeying two of his final three.\n\n\"Felt like I played better than what the score reflects,\" McIlroy stated on Thursday at the Irish Open. \"Just a matter of being more efficient with the scoring.\"\n\nMore Golf: Tiger Woods Gets Bold Callout From Ernie Els: 'Beat Us ...

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nFew rivalries in golf have endured with the same intensity and respect over time. The rivalry between Ernie Els and Tiger Woods is among them. From playoff duels to major championship showdowns, their careers have been intertwined since the late 1990s.\nWhether it was Woods draining a 40-foot birdie to beat Els at the 2000 Mercedes Championships or their unforgettable playoff at the 2003 Presidents Cup, the two legends have shared some of the sport's most iconic moments.\nNow, as Woods approaches his 50th birthday on December 30th, Els has reignited the competitive spark for their senior stage.\n\"Beat us again ... if you can,\" Els told the Palm Beach Post while unveiling his autism-friendly recreation complex.\nThe message was aimed squarely at Big Cat, who will become eligible for the PGA Tour Champions in 2026.\nEls, now 55, has already made the transition with notable success. He's finished inside the top 10 of the season-long standings for three consecutive years and currently ranks No. 5.\n\"It doesn't help him to finish 70th on the regular tour, not really getting proper reps,\" Els added during the same conversation with the Palm Beach Post. \"He can shoot 66 (on the senior tour). Get your confidence up, make those birdie putts under the gun.\"\nThe 15-time major champion has avoided playing in recent years due to a series of injuries. Most recently, he ruptured his left Achilles tendon in the spring, sidelining him for the year.\nBut with the PGA Tour Champions offering the advantage of using carts, Woods gains an edge.\n\"I've got three more years, where I get the little buggy and be out there with Fred (Couples),\" Woods told reporters at the 2023 Masters.\nEls believes the senior tour could be exactly what Woods needs, not just to compete, but to rebuild his rhythm and confidence.\n\"I hope so,\" Els expressed as quoted. \"I've said, 'Please come play.' And I think it can only be beneficial to (Woods). He will get himself in golf shape. You can ride a cart without any shame and if there was one guy that should be able to drive a cart, it's him. And he can get his ass back in shape.\"\nThe sentiment is echoed by others in the golf world\nPaul Azinger, a 12-time PGA Tour winner and NBC's lead analyst for the Champions Tour, believes Woods' arrival would be a seismic moment for the over-50 circuit.\n\"I believe there's a lot of anticipation (for Woods),\" Azinger expressed in February as quoted by Sports Illustrated. \"A lot of guys are going to be in shape and ready and try to beat Tiger if they can. I think Tiger might even feel an obligation to play the (PGA Tour Champions). The Tour has given Tiger a lot of money the last few years with that Player Impact Program. I'm sure he's going to give back, and it's going to be to all the benefit of these guys out here that are over 50\".\nFor now, Woods remains focused on recovery. But with his eligibility just months away, the stage is quietly being set for a new chapter.\nMore Golf: Charlie Woods Nears Dad Tiger Woods' Hole-In-One Record at Junior Players\nAbout the writer\nDevlina Sarkar is a Newsweek contributor based in New Delhi, India.

Inconsistencies may occur.\nSergio Garcia, the all-time leading scorer in Ryder Cup history, will not be teeing it up at Bethpage Black this September, and the emotional fallout has been immediate.\nThe 45-year-old Spaniard, who accumulated 28.5 points across 10 Ryder Cup appearances, was left off Luke Donald's final European team on Monday.\nDonald had warned Garcia weeks earlier at the British Masters that his spot was far from guaranteed. He had also confessed to GolfMagic that Garcia would need a standout showing at LIV Golf's season-ending Team Championship to be considered as the captain's pick.\nBut Garcia's Fireballs GC finished eighth, falling short of the impact needed to sway Donald's decision.\n\"The call with Luke (Donald) was fine but not the call I wanted, obviously,\" Garcia told GolfMagic's Andy Roberts on Monday. \"Now, the only thing I can do is support the team from home. It's as simple as that. I'll be watching and cheering on the European team.\"\nThe snub hit Garcia hard. Just hours after the picks were revealed, he withdrew from the Amgen Irish Open at The K Club in Kildare, citing emotional fatigue.\n\"I felt like I was so looking forward to being a part of that team,\" he expressed during the same conversation with Golf Magic. He added, \"And so I felt like mentally, you know, mentally it was kind of tough.\n\"I didn't want to go there and not be fully engaged in the tournament and stuff, so I just decided to take a little bit of time off and spend it with the family and do a couple of things, you know, some things outside of golf and just kind of reboot a little bit, recharge the batteries.\"\nGarcia's season has been a mix of flashes and frustration. He claimed his second career LIV Golf title in Hong Kong this March, finishing ninth in the LIV Individual Championship standings. That followed a third-place finish in the same race last year.\nYet despite those wins, Garcia's world ranking has fallen to No. 411, mainly due to LIV Golf events not earning ranking points.\nThe Masters winner's withdrawal underscores the emotional weight of missing out on what would have been his 11th Ryder Cup appearance, tying legends like Sir Nick Faldo and Lee Westwood.\nHis passion for the event has never wavered, and his leadership has often been a force for younger players under pressure.\nAccording to GolfMagic, the Spaniard still plans to compete at the Spanish Open at Club de Campo Villa de Madrid next month.\nBut he'll need a top-tier finish to crack the top 70 in the DP World Tour Rankings and qualify for the season-ending playoffs in Abu Dhabi. Currently, he sits at No. 188.\nMore Golf: Baltimore Driving Range Damaged by Two-Alarm Fire Raises Safety Concerns\nAbout the writer\nDevlina Sarkar is a Newsweek contributor based in New Delhi, India.

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nWith the FedEx Cup playoffs wrapped and the six automatic qualifiers locked in, all eyes turned to Keegan Bradley for the final piece of Team USA's Ryder Cup roster. On Wednesday morning, the suspense ended.\nBradley announced his six captain's picks for the Bethpage Black battle and confirmed he would not be one of them.\n\"I'm glad it's over,\" Bradley stated at the press conference in Frisco, Texas. \"It was a very tough decision. I trust these six guys completely.\"\nBradley's six picks include Justin Thomas, Collin Morikawa, Ben Griffin, Cameron Young, Patrick Cantlay, and Sam Burns, whose selection had already been reported earlier this week.\nBut the biggest surprise wasn't who made the team. It was who didn't.\nDespite finishing 11th in the Ryder Cup standings and winning the Travelers Championship in June, Bradley chose to stay in the captain's role.\nMany, including President Donald Trump, had publicly urged him to pick himself, citing his form and Northeastern roots. Bradley, however, opted for leadership over legacy.\nHis decision means the record still stands, Arnold Palmer remains the last American to serve as a playing captain, doing so in 1963 at East Lake.\nBreaking down Bradley's six picks\n- Justin Thomas: Thomas, ranked No. 7 in the Ryder Cup standings, leads the captain's picks with experience. A three-time Ryder Cup veteran, he boasts a formidable 6\u20132\u20131 record in the event and returned to form this season with a win at the RBC Heritage in April. Thomas also posted eight top-10 finishes.\n- Collin Morikawa: Next up is Collin Morikawa, sitting at No. 8. The two-time major champion has become a Ryder Cup regular, with a 4\u20132\u20131 record across two appearances. Morikawa was on full display this season, highlighted by a runner-up finish at the Arnold Palmer Invitational and a top-10 showing at The Players Championship.\n- Ben Griffin: Griffin, ranked No. 9, earns his first Ryder Cup nod after a breakout season. He captured wins at the Zurich Classic and the Charles Schwab Challenge at Colonial, and added nine top-10 finishes to his resume. Griffin also impressed with a T9 at the PGA Championship, showcasing his ability to perform on big stages.\n- Cameron Young: Young, ranked No. 14, finally broke through with his maiden PGA Tour win at the Wyndham Championship in August.
