  "content": "COLOGNE, Germany, Aug. 22, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Following a highly successful Closed Beta Test that drew in over hundreds of thousands of players shortly after launch, Saroasis Studios officially announced the Early Access release date for its flagship title, Fate Trigger, set for 2026 Q1.\n\nIn a highly saturated and competitive market for battle royale and first-person shooter (FPS) games, Fate Trigger's PC Closed Beta proved there's still plenty of room to innovate. Combining anime-inspired style with strategic depth and a low barrier to entry, it delivers an experience for gamers of all skill levels. Riding that wave of interest, Saorasis Studios confirms that Fate Trigger will eventually support cross-platform play, and launch first-person point-of-view for select game modes, which will arrive as a future update.\n\nWhere Gameplay Meets Anime Fandom: Fate Trigger's Expansion Beyond the Screen\n\nAs ongoing interest in battle royale games collides with the global rise of anime culture, today's players want more than just matches. They're chasing deep lore, iconic characters, and worlds they can dive into and explore with friends.\n\nIt's this hunger for immersive universes that Saroasis Studios aims to satisfy. Today, the studio revealed that Fate Trigger won't simply be a cross-platform game. It's set to evolve into a living universe, complete with esports and community competitions, ongoing world-building, and even offline media releases.\n\nShowcasing the Best of Fate Trigger at gamescom 2025\n\nWith esports and a thriving fan community at the heart of Fate Trigger's long-term vision, Saroasis Studios' gamescom 2025 booth offered the first a glimpse into what the game's expanding ecosystem could become. Not only did Saroasis Studios host Fate Trigger cosplay performance, but also high-stakes, head-to-head showdowns in live competition between esports teams formed and captained by some of the world's most popular streamers including Tuonto, Kariyu, BTMC, Keeoh+, Locklear, Skyrroz, Dhalucard, Rpr, Schrodinger and Arii.\n\nThat competitive energy set the stage to spotlight Fate Trigger's latest content introduced in the Closed Beta. From new characters like Bloodprowler Ryoin, the wolf-animoid assassin, to Crystalscar Cynric and Lootracer Mindy, to new weapons and vehicles like a high-speed flanking motorcycle and a rugged armored SUV, Fate Trigger's latest release raised the stakes, ensuring every match is as unpredictable as it is thrilling.\n\nDesigned for fairness and fun across all platforms, the Closed Beta's massive turnout proved its instant accessibility. You can jump in and have fun within minutes or tune your skills without overly committing by jumping into the newly introduced Rapid Trials and 8v8 Team Deathmatch modes, first rolled out in the Closed Beta. These modes prepare players for the intensity of Fate Trigger's Ranked Matches, delivering a finely tuned mix of speed and tactical depth that lets both newcomers and veterans refine their skills, master tactics, and define their playstyle.\n\nAdd Fate Trigger to your Wish List HERE.\n\nSaroasis Studios is a subsidiary of Tencent, with over 15 years of expertise in the shooter games genre. The studio has a passionate team consisting of more than 600 anime and shooter game enthusiasts, who are dedicated to crafting high-quality games and collaborating with players to co-create captivating gaming experiences.
