      "summary": "The Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, which may require Congressional approval due to the power of the purse. Additionally, the government plans to receive a portion of revenues from Chinese chip sales by Nvidia and AMD, indicating a shift in U.S. government interaction with American companies. Meanwhile, there are discussions about an IPO for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, though significant regulatory hurdles remain. The appointment of a new Fed chair could also impact monetary policy, but any nominee will need Senate confirmation.",
