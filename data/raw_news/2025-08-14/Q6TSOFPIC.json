  "content": "\u2022 Age, driving history, vehicle type and where you live are the primary factors that influence insurance premiums.\n\u2022 Variables such as your credit history and marital status can also affect your rate.\n\u2022 Understanding these factors can help you find ways to lower insurance costs. Some factors that affect the cost of car insurance, like your age, are out of your control, but you can control many of the other factors insurers consider. Understanding what makes car insurance cost more can help you make a strategy to lower your rates. Though each insurer creates its own unique formula for assessing risk and determining rates, the factors below typically play a primary role.\n\nGetting older has distinct benefits when it comes to car insurance, at least to a point. Age reflects maturity and experience behind the wheel, with fewer claims often a product of both. Young drivers, especially those aged 18 or younger, have some of the most expensive auto insurance rates. When all other factors are equal, rates generally decrease with age. For example:\n\u2022 Between ages 18 and 55, there's an average rate decrease of 68%.\n\u2022 Between ages 25 and 55, there's an average decrease of 25% in car insurance rates. Rates start to increase again in your 60s, when claims for that age group start to rise, even if you're an excellent driver. Hawaii, Massachusetts and North Carolina don't allow age as a factor in car insurance rates, according to the American Property Casualty Insurance Association (APCIA).\n\nWhile you can't control freak accidents on the road, you can reduce your risk of accidents and tickets with good driving habits. Staying vigilant and obeying the law while driving can help you avoid costly rate increases that come with at-fault accidents and moving violations, like speeding tickets. For example, our analysis shows that premiums increase an average 32% at the time of renewal if you get a speeding ticket. Rates go up by an average of 59% if you cause an accident. Expect your rates to double after a DUI conviction.\n\nYour garaging address\u2014generally the home where you park your car\u2014is an important component of a car insurance rate calculation. Insurers look at the frequency of a variety of claims, such as car theft and weather-related damages. Only Michigan bans the use of location in car insurance cost calculations, according to the APCIA. Poor credit costs you in many ways, such as higher loan interest rates, lack of access to the best credit cards and even higher auto insurance rates. Car insurance companies see a connection between poor credit and an increased chance that you'll make more claims. To offset that risk, insurers charge more (in most states) as your credit tier goes down. For instance, our analysis of rates indicates that drivers with poor credit pay an average of 189% more for coverage than drivers with very good or excellent credit. California, Hawaii and Massachusetts don't allow insurers to use credit in setting car insurance rates. If you've improved your credit score since purchasing your policy, ask your insurance company to rerun your rate calculation. Insurers might not do this automatically when your policy renews, iquiring may result in a better right.\n\nYou might not be thinking much about auto insurance costs when you choose a new vehicle. However, the car you're insuring can influence rates, especially when you're buying collision and comprehensive insurance. Sports cars\u2014which tend to have more claims\u2014and vehicles with expensive repair and replacement costs are pricier to insure. For example, insurance for a Tesla Model S is more than twice the cost of insurance for a Subaru Forester.\n\nBuying higher levels of coverage will cost more, but how much more? Compare car insurance quotes and you might find that buying higher coverage limits is cost-effective. We found that the cost of increasing liability insurance from 50/100/50 to 100/300/100 was minimal, at about only 1% more. Also, ask your insurance agent to run quotes for various levels of deductible, so that you can compare cost differences by increasing your deductible. Car insurance costs for different levels of coverage\n\nWhat the numbers mean Car insurance coverage levels are frequently expressed as three numbers, such as 100/300/100. In this example, the most your insurance company will pay is:\n\u2022 $100,000 per person for injuries in one accident\n\u2022 $300,000 total for injuries in one accident\n\u2022 $100,000 for property damage in one accident Getting all the car insurance discounts you're entitled to is a no-brainer for lowering car insurance costs. Most are applied automatically when you buy a policy. For instance, most insurance offer a discount for bundling auto and homeowners insurance or based on your vehicle's safety equipment, such as air bags. It doesn't hurt to ask your agent to go over the possible discounts in case you're missing any. Common, insurers offer discounts for:\n\u2022 Insuring a full-time high school or college student who gets good grades\n\u2022 Insuring a college student who lives away from home without a car\n\u2022 Completing an approved defensive driving class if you're age 50 or older (depending on the state and insurer)\n\u2022 Maintaining lower annual mileage if your commute has reduced A variety of other cost factors are used by some car insurance companies, with varying degrees of significance within the rate. For example, some insurers use education and occupation when determining rates, so policyholders with advanced degrees or careers in law or engineering may see better rates. Massachusetts, Michigan and New York don't allow the use of education or occupation in auto insurance rates. Some insurers give married people a much better rate than single drivers. For example, our analysis found that State Farm has no cost difference between married and single customers, but Farmers average rates are 16% less for married people. Hawaii, Massachusetts, Michigan and Texas ban the use of marital status in setting car insurance rates, according to the APCIA. Personal vs. business use of the vehicle also affects rates, with business use costing more. Rates are from Quadrant Information Services, an analytics company, and are based on publicly available insurance company rate filings. Unless otherwise noted, cost estimates are based on liability coverage of 50/100/50 with collision and comprehensive coverage with $500 deductibles. Rates are based on a 35-year-old single female with a good credit score and a clean driving record, insuring a 2023 Toyota RAV4 LE. Rates do not include potential discounts. Your own rates will be different.\n\nBundling is a common discount that reduces rates when you buy two types of coverage, such as auto and homeowners insurance, from the same company. If you're not a homeowner, you can still generally take advantage of a bundling discount when you buy auto insurance along with renters, boat or some other type of qualifying coverage. Gender does not typically play a role in auto insurance rates. When it does, the differences are minimal. No, car color plays no role in auto insurance costs. Other vehicle details, such as past claims for your vehicle model, help determine rates. How does annual mileage affect my insurance premium? Auto insurance companies usually give a price break for annual mileage that's under a certain threshold, such as 7,500 miles a year. That threshold can vary by company, but if you've recently changed your commute or retired, you might qualify for lower rates. Do safety features in my car reduce insurance costs? Common safety features such as air bags and antilock brakes typically warrant discounts. These discounts will be automatically applied to your policy. Sophisticated safety features like lane-departure warning systems do not necessarily lead to discounts because the equipment and sensors are expensive to repair if the car is damaged. Will taking a defensive driving course lower my premium? Defensive driving discounts are usually reserved for mature drivers. States often mandate that drivers age 55 and older get a discount for taking an approved defensive driving class. These state laws typically say that the discount applies for three years, and then you can retake the class to maintain the discount. How often should I shop around for better insurance rates? It's smart to shop around every few years or sooner if your situation has changed. For example, if you've gotten a speeding ticket that has substantially increased your rate, it might pay off to compare quotes right away for a better deal. Or, if you've added a teen driver or moved, it's a good time to shop around for better rates.",
