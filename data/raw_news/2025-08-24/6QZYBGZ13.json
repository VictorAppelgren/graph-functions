  "content": "A crew of California firefighters managed to free a mischievous dog that became trapped underneath a shipping container while scampering after a rabbit Saturday night.\n\nFinn, a fluffy young goldendoodle, was out for a walk with his owners around 7 p.m. when a small rabbit crossed their path, according to the Ventura County Fire Department.\n\nThe young pup took off in a flash, zigzagging left and right as he gained on the rabbit \u2014 while his owners frantically chased him.\n\nThe puppy parents weren\u2019t able to reach him before Finn dove right underneath a shipping container after the bunny.\n\nThe rabbit had apparently absconded unscathed, but Finn found himself in a precarious situation: alone, in the dark, stuck in a gap between the bottom of the container and the cold dirt.\n\nHis frantic owners called the firefighters, who documented the mind-boggling rescue as Finn watched on from the opening he slid through.\n\n\u201cWe tried everything. We\u2019ve been at this for almost an hour and a half,\u201d one of Finn\u2019s humans lamented to officials, according to The Sacramento Bee.\n\nFirefighters had to use special rescue tools to lift the shipping container up so Finn could shimmy his way out and back into his owners\u2019 loving arms.\n\nThe curly-haired pooch was safe and sound with every patch of fur in place, looking as if nothing ever happened save for the apparent exhaustion behind his beady eyes.\n\nIn early 2024, members of the US Coast Guard helped rescue another dog trapped in a shipping container in Texas. The dog, affectionately nicknamed Connie the container dog, somehow survived inside the container for a whopping eight days.\n\nConnie came with an extra surprise: she was pregnant. She later gave birth to a small litter of healthy puppies and was adopted in the DC area, according to the Forever Changed Animal Rescue.\n\nLast week, a dog was rescued in Pennsylvania with a plastic cheese ball tub stuck on her head. She was found in a cornfield after a days-long search and swiftly freed from the bucket.\n\nThe dog was named Dallas Cheddar after her rescuer and captor, respectively.",

      "text": "Dog named \u2018Dallas Cheddar\u2019 rescued after spending days with head stuck in cheese ball bucket: video\nA stray dog in Pennsylvania spotted with a cheese ball bucket stuck on her head was rescued with assistance from a volunteer drone operator, whom she was later named after.\nThe mangy mutt managed to evade the Canine Rescue of Central PA and multiple thermal drones for days, all the while navigating the world through the cramped lens of the plastic snack container.\nThe rescue worked with Find Toby, a nonprofit organization that helps recover lost dogs, and Nighthawk Drone Services, a licensed drone company that assists with anything from herd analyses to missing persons cases.\nAfter days of scouring York County for the frazzled pup, she was captured on the drone\u2019s camera in a cornfield around 3 a.m. Wednesday, according to a video shared by the rescue shelter.\nThe pooch was relatively calm as a rescuer clipped a leash on her, though she was clearly dazed as she kept turning her head to try and get a good look at the strangers through the jar stuck on her head.\nThe exhausted dog was taken to an emergency veterinarian clinic for evaluation and finally freed from the confines of the junk food jar.\nThe veterinarian concluded that the \u201cseverely emaciated\u201d and tick-infested pup hadn\u2019t eaten or drank water for at least three days because of the jug. They ordered additional bloodwork just to make sure she had no other underlying issues, according to the rescue.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll continue to share updates as she recovers. But for now, we celebrate a life saved and the power of people coming together for one dog who matters!\u201d the rescue group wrote on Facebook.\nThe group decided to name her after her rescuer, drone operator Dallas Fuhrman. They tacked on a middle name in honor of the thing that got her into the predicament in the first place \u2014 Cheddar.\nDallas Cheddar isn\u2019t available for adoption yet, the rescue said, but could be soon once she is cleared and rehabilitated.\nIn 2023, a dog in Michigan was also discovered by an animal shelter with his head stuck in a cheese ball jar. A good Samaritan turned the sickly dog over to the shelter, which named him \u201cCheeto\u201d \u2014 though a worker at the shelter tried hard to convince his coworkers to name the pup \u201cJughead.\u201d"

      "text": "It was just another routine day of inspecting shipping containers at the Port of Houston for US Coast Guard officer Ryan McMahon when he and his team thought they heard barking coming from inside one of the thousands of containers that surrounded them.\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s scratching, dude,\u201d one of the inspectors said in video they recorded Wednesday morning as the team looked up at the container, stacked about 25 feet in the air.\nA crane was used to bring it to the ground, and out popped a very sweet and friendly dog.\n\u201cAs soon as we opened it, we could see the little dog\u2019s face poking out. She was right there, like she knew we were going to be there to open it for her. And she just, she wasn\u2019t scared or anything. She just seemed happy more than anything, to be out of that dark space and in the arms of people that were going to take care of her,\u201d McMahon, a petty officer 2nd class, told The Associated Press on Friday.\nCoast Guard officials would later determine that the canine \u2014 since nicknamed Connie the container dog \u2014 had been trapped inside for at least eight days, with no food or water.\nShe was a little dirty and \u201cdefinitely pretty skinny,\u201d McMahon said.\nMcMahon and the three other inspectors drove Connie to an animal shelter in the Houston suburb of Pasadena, where she was checked out.\nA rescue group, Forever Changed Animal Rescue, has taken her in and is working to get her healthy and ready for adoption.\nCoast Guard officials are not sure where the container came from, but inside were junked vehicles that were likely being shipped overseas to be sold for parts.\n\u201cSo based on that, they think that the dog most likely was in a junkyard, in a car. And that\u2019s how she accidentally got put in the container,\u201d Guard spokeswoman Chief Petty Officer Corinne Zilnicki said.\nMcMahon said he\u2019s grateful he and his team were at the right place and at the right time to hear Connie barking and prevent the container from being put on a cargo ship.\nThey usually conduct inspections once a week throughout the Port of Houston, and on Wednesday they were at the port\u2019s Bayport Container Terminal which likely has over 10,000 containers, he said.\n\u201cIt would take at least another week to get to where she was going (on a cargo ship) and two weeks without food or water. I don\u2019t think she would have made it,\u201d McMahon said.\nForever Changed Animal Rescue thanked \u201call of the amazing people involved in this rescue and saving Connie\u2019s life.\u201d\nThe rescue group said in a Facebook post that Connie was a bit underweight, tested positive for heartworm and would be getting treatment for it.\n\u201cWe will also be doing a full workup on her to ensure that she receives all the care she needs and deserves,\u201d the group said.\nThe inspectors had thought about adopting Connie, but it wasn\u2019t the right time for any of them.\n\u201cWe know with all this, she\u2019s going to go to a good home where they love her and take care of her,\u201d McMahon said."

      "text": "My small-town beer buddy vented about his creepy teaching assistant all semester \u2014 it turned out to be Bryan Kohberger\nJohn Snyder is a kindly older man who lives in my small town. He\u2019s what you\u2019d consider a normal person \u2014 a married homeowner who teaches at the local university.\nHe\u2019d been a public defender for almost 30 years when he took the opportunity to teach students about the legal system instead of defend them in it, feeling he was nearing burnout in a demanding profession.\nI\u2019ve come to know John pretty well over the years, not just because we live in the same town \u2014 my wife, Alexis, is his favorite bartender, and he likes going out for dinner with his wife or having a beer after work as much as the next guy.\nBut there was a marked theme to John\u2019s happy-hour conversation in fall 2022: His teaching assistant in Washington State University\u2019s Criminal Justice and Criminology Department was \u201can a\u2013hole\u201d who was driving him crazy.\nNormal after-work grumbling, one might think, even if in a high quantity. Then bucolic life in our peaceful region was interrupted in November 2022 when four University of Idaho students were brutally murdered just 20 minutes away.\nAfter the new year, John came into the bar carrying a newspaper and looking bad enough that my wife said, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? You look like shit.\u201d\nJohn held up the paper and confirmed what we suspected after the arrest: His teaching assistant was Bryan Kohberger.\nJohn Snyder has avoided the media since Kohberger\u2019s arrest, but due to our friendship he agreed to meet me at the Palouse Caboose Bar & Grill, where my wife is a bartender, for some pitchers of beer and his first, and probably only, in-depth interview about supervising Bryan Kohberger.\nJohn graduated from the University of Idaho Law School in 1988 and began working as a public defender, his specialization throughout his legal career, saying, \u201cCriminals are more honest and easier to work with than people going through a divorce.\u201d\nHe was also attracted to the field by his sense of justice and desire to see people who may have disadvantages within society treated fairly by the legal system.\nAnd something of a troublemaker himself \u2014 his skill at pool paid his bar tabs all through law school \u2014 he could imagine being caught making some of the same mistakes as his clients.\nHe occasionally dealt with homicides or other serious crimes, but in a college town it\u2019s mostly young people screwing up.\nJohn doesn\u2019t feel this career has given him any greater ability to sense evil than the average person.\nAs a professor, John had a high volume of students and couldn\u2019t get to know many of them well. Teaching assistants are different, and in normal circumstances one works with them extensively.\nIt used to be that professors chose preferred potential TAs from a list, but for reasons he never discovered, the school abandoned this system and randomized the process, which is how he was assigned Kohberger.\nWhen the graduate student came to introduce himself early in summer 2022, John didn\u2019t think much of him: \u201cHe was a little odd, but a lot of people in academia are odd.\u201d\nDespite the TA-assignment system being designed to prevent this exact problem, Kohberger had a scheduling conflict and thus limited attendance in class, though he also often didn\u2019t show up when available.\nThe infrequency of his class appearances didn\u2019t stop one female student from emailing a friend near the semester\u2019s start, \u201cMy class\u2019s TA looks like a murderer.\u201d\nJohn says he tries to look at TAs\u2019 individual attributes and put them to work where they will be the most useful while training them on their weaker points.\nIn this instance, however, \u201cBryan quickly disabused me of the idea that I would get a sufficient amount of work out of him, and I quickly figured out he was a bit of a douche. And within a few weeks I realized this was going to be an exceptionally long semester.\u201d\nDespite Kohberger missing class, the prof saw him plenty.\nHere\u2019s the latest coverage on Bryan Kohberger:\n- Bryan Kohberger\u2019s classmates made 13 formal complaints about the killer for \u2018being a d\u2013k,\u2019 making offensive comments: report\n- Bryan Kohberger\u2019s creepy remark on night of Idaho murders revealed by surviving roommate\n- Eerie leaked videos of Bryan Kohberger with red hands inside cell being probed by Idaho prison\n- Bryan Kohberger\u2019s phone records unveil similarities to Norman Bates: \u2018Just super eerie\u2019\n\u201cHe rapidly developed the habit of coming in at the end of the day, when I clearly wanted to go home,\u201d he says. \u201cHe would start talking about inane, stupid and immature things. . . . I quickly realized this was a technique where he felt like he was in control as long as he was wasting my time.\u201d\nKohberger once tried to tell John how he was going to get out of a parking ticket, even managing to get him to examine the \u201cscene.\u201d It turned out the TA had parked next to a yellow curb in a lot where he didn\u2019t have a permit anyway.\nAdmonitions that in his experience as a defense attorney, people who believe they know the law better than the courts are always wrong fell on deaf ears.\nJohn says over time Kohberger \u201cwould follow me down the hall yapping, and I started calling it his \u2018terrier routine.\u2019\u201d\nWhen John\u2019s wife was waiting for him in the car once, she saw Kohberger following him and recoiled nearly to the other side, a reaction he\u2019d never seen from her in many years of marriage.\nSnyder had grown to hate Kohberger over the course of the semester but never thought he was dangerous \u2014 he actually considered him a wimp.\nHe learned of Kohberger\u2019s arrest along with everyone else. He was in his office Dec. 30 in a nearly empty building when the custodian told him the police had the basement sealed off.\nThey ended up walking to a picture board of department members, and the custodian started pointing at photos speculating whose office the police might be searching.\nWhen the custodian got to Kohberger, it hit him: His teaching assistant was the murderer.\nThen his phone rang; his brother-in-law told him Kohberger had been arrested. That call was interrupted by his son calling, which was interrupted by the Moscow, Idaho, police calling to set up an immediate interview; he drove to Moscow instead of waiting around for them to show up.\nFrom the police he learned Kohberger had a list of women\u2019s names of unknown purpose \u2014 though surely not anything good \u2014 and one of them was a woman he knew from the department. But overall he wasn\u2019t able to greatly help them besides describing Kohberger\u2019s character.\nHaving worked with a mass murderer was a system shock for John, even if he always disliked the guy.\nThe university\u2019s standard trauma-assistance programs proved unhelpful; the support \u201chotline\u201d he called listed every imaginable identity group besides his own \u2014 old white men \u2014 and then said it could set an appointment in two weeks.\nBut he says the stream of graduate students and undergrads coming into his office to offer support \u201cwas one of the coolest things I\u2019ve ever experienced.\u201d\nThe department chair also transferred his own excellent teaching assistant to John for the next semester to ease his workload \u2014 and so there would be no more surprises.\nJohn says the reality of the crime isn\u2019t what bothers him \u2014 it is instead someone studying criminology to become a better criminal instead of to pursue justice.\n\u201cIt was the assault on why I do what I do: promote justice and fairness, to find honor where there isn\u2019t any, to teach people to be decent human beings, and to realize that life goes on, and to let people who had not experienced respect from the system know that the power to move past their troubles is inside them.\u201d\nMost of the people he worked with throughout his career were in bad circumstances and needed help out of the abyss, while Kohberger chose to dive into it.\nThough this may be over for the public, for those affected it will never go away, and a feeling of safety is slow to return when you learn you have been in close contact with a monster.\nThis coming year is likely to be Snyder\u2019s last spent teaching, not just because of Kohberger \u2014 he has been working to make a more just society since 1988 and is tired.\nLet\u2019s hope some of the students he\u2019s taught over the last 10 years can pick up the torch and none of them turns out to be the next Bryan Kohberger.\nAs for his former TA, it is John\u2019s belief that being both extremely irritating and physically weak he won\u2019t survive to the end of his natural life in prison.\nBrad Pearce writes The Wayward Rabbler on Substack."

      "text": "Cracker Barrel board member under fire for DEI background after restaurant ditches traditional logo: \u2018What qualified him?\u2019\nOne member of Cracker Barrel\u2019s board of directors is catching heat over his DEI-heavy background following negative reaction to the company\u2019s new logo and redesigned interior and revelations about its embrace of far-Left values.\nGilbert Davila, 61, joined the restaurant chain\u2019s board in July 2020 and is also among its top individual shareholders. Conservative activist Robby Starbuck called out Davila in a video criticizing the company\u2019s leadership, calling the recent changes the culmination of a years-long campaign to cater to the far Left and abandon the values of its middle-America customer base.\n\u201cWhat qualified him for this board seat?\u201d Starbuck asks in the video. \u201cWell, you see, he\u2019s owned a DEI consulting and strategy firm for 15 years that focuses on pushing DEI and DEI advertising.\u201d\nStarbuck was referring to DMI Consulting, a firm where Davila has served as president and CEO since 2010. Davila\u2019s biography page on Cracker Barrel\u2019s website describes the firm as \u201ca leading multicultural marketing, diversity & inclusion and strategy firm in the United States.\u201d\nFOX Business reached out to Cracker Barrel and Davila\u2019s company for comment but did not hear back at the time of publication.\nConsumers have criticized Cracker Barrel after it unveiled a new logo that replaced the image of a man leaning on a barrel with just the restaurant\u2019s name in black text over a yellow barrel-shaped backdrop. The chain also redesigned the interior of its restaurants, ditching the kitschy American aesthetic and replacing it with a slick modernist motif.\nBut Starbuck said those cosmetic changes are just part of a lurch away from American values. In his 15-minute video, he notes the company has been active in LGBTQ pride events, and aggressively employed diversity, equity and inclusion policies in hiring.\nDavila\u2019s LinkedIn page states that he \u201cis widely recognized\u2026 for his multicultural market knowledge and his proven track record on how to best embed a multicultural perspective into a corporation\u2019s entire operation.\u201d\n\u201cPeople like him are behind the woke advertising push that we\u2019ve seen in recent years,\u201d Starbuck said of Davila in the video. \u201cAnd he was also one of the people responsible for DEI at Disney.\u201d\nPrior to his work at DMI, Davila worked at The Walt Disney Company, where he served as the vice president of global diversity and multicultural market development from 2003 to 2010.\nDavila earlier held the role of vice president of multicultural management for Sears & Roebuck Company and was a marketing director for Coca-Cola USA.\nDavila\u2019s biography page also notes that he is a member of the Association of National Advertisers, co-founding and serving as a director of the group\u2019s Alliance for Inclusive and Multicultural Marketing.\nStarbuck said he believes the controversy around Cracker Barrel\u2019s logo change is about more than the removal of a man in his chair leaning on a barrel.\n\u201cThe American people are sick of having our culture and heritage stripped from us,\u201d Starbuck told Fox News Digital last week."

The parallels one could draw from this are endless.

She was right there, like she knew we were going to be there to open it for her,\u201d McMahon, a petty officer 2nd class, told the Associated Press.\n\u201cAnd she just, she wasn\u2019t scared or anything. She just seemed happy more than anything to be out of that dark space and in the arms of people that were going to take care of her,\u201d said McMahon.\nShe was a little dirty and \u201cdefinitely pretty skinny,\u201d McMahon said.\nConnie also tested positive for heartworm and will be treated for the disease after her pregnancy is over.\nThe Coast Guard is unsure how the dog got inside the container with a bunch of junked vehicles, but believe she may have been in a junkyard and accidentally got into the container.\nMcMahon said he was grateful to have noticed the dog\u2019s barks before she was loaded up on a cargo ship.\nAfter her pregnancy, Connie is hoping to find a forever home in the DC-area."
