      "feedback": "The Movers & Scenarios section mostly respects the required 4-line, 2-Up/2-Down format and anchors drivers to a first-principles, regime-based logic, but several gaps keep it from world-class quality. First, the Outlook and Swing-Trade framing doesn’t strictly conform to the specified format: convert the single Outlook line into the mandated 1-line structure (Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence %), and push a separate Swing Trade line (or two) only if the asset is tradable, with explicit Entry/Stop/Target/R/R/Invalidation/Trigger fields. Second, probabilities currently appear as hand-wavy 60/65/35/32% without transparent grounding; attach each percentage to a concrete, source-backed rationale (e.g., regime A anchor, ETF/inflow signals, or policy credibility cues) or present a defensible range and cite the underlying evidence next to it. Third, the “What to watch” bullets should be sharpened to concrete, monitorable metrics drawn from the material (e.g., Ether price plateaus near 4,955, BTC band 110k–125k, ETF inflows, GENIUS Act momentum, Treasury issuance pace) and each metric should carry an inline source tag. Fourth, trim scope creep: many lines drift into broad macro-finance stories (Pacaso, Ford, private-label margins) that are not essential to a crypto/risk-asset swing view; prune to crypto/risk-asset transmission channels and clearly reconcile any cross-source conflicts (e.g., Regime A uplift versus tariff/geopolitical risks) within the risk narrative, not as separate, incoherent threads. Fifth, strengthen the first-principles causal chain in the text: explicitly spell out (1) policy stance and discount-rate expectations, (2) risk premia adjustment, (3) capital reallocation into crypto via ETH ETFs, staking yields, and treasury demand, (4) observable price/flow signals, with each link traced to the cited IDs. Sixth, ensure every factual price anchor (ETH near 4,955; BTC 110k–125k) and the regime-weights and triggers have precise citations and are not implied without support. Seventh, ensure complete coverage of critical sources by cross-checking for any material contradictions (e.g., AI-capex vs. tariff shock) and explicitly flagging where a source implies a stronger or weaker read, then harmonize the narrative around the dominant regime assumption (Regime A) with explicit invalidation rules. Eighth, tighten formatting consistency (consistent dash notation for time windows, uniform capitalization, and parentheses for IDs) and remove extraneous lines that exceed the prescribed length, ensuring the final swing plan, if included, adheres to the 1–2-line Swing Trade constraint with a clear Direction, Horizon, Entry/Stop/Target, R/R, Invalidation, Trigger, Probability, and Confidence. Implementing these edits will yield a concise, fully compliant, numbers-driven, and source-reconciled world-class Swing Trade outline.",
