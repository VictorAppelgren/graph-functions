      "text": "No matter your lifestyle or budget, Samsung offers a range of phones to fit what you're looking for. The Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus tout solid performance, good cameras and long-lasting batteries. If you want a more versatile camera setup, consider the top-of-the-line Galaxy S25 Ultra. For a novel design, you can opt for Samsung's pricier foldable phones, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 and Z Fold 7 -- or even its super slim Galaxy S25 Edge. If you need a cheaper option, Samsung's $200 Galaxy A15 5G or Galaxy A26, A36 and A56, which range from $300 to $500, might be a good fit. Check out our roundup to find the phone that best fits your needs.\nOur Picks\nMOBILE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $449 (save $50)\n- $550 (save $50)\n- $300 (save $100)\nWhat is the best Samsung phone?\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra -- priced at $1,300 -- comes packed with maximum features which, for most people, is more than necessary. For the rest of us, the $800 Galaxy S25 is a standout among its Galaxy counterparts. It has the same Snapdragon customized chip and RAM as the S25 Ultra, runs the same version of Android and costs $500 less.\nThe Galaxy S25 has a very capable triple rear camera setup that is versatile in capturing both bright outdoor scenes and candid moments inside under mixed lighting. Overall, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is ideal for Android fans who prioritize fast performance, versatile cameras and a spacious, bright screen.\nHow to pick the right Samsung phone for you\nDeciding which Samsung phone is right for you comes down to what you want in a phone and how much you're willing to spend. If you want the largest screen available on a standard Samsung phone, enjoy note-taking with a stylus and need a camera with a significantly closer zoom, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is the right choice. You'll also have to spend $1,300 unless you score a trade-in deal.\nThose who don't need the stylus, prefer more compact phone and still want a good camera should consider the Galaxy S25 or Galaxy S25 Plus. If you just want the basics, like a spacious screen, 5G and a decent camera, consider the Galaxy S24 FE. Those looking for the flashiest tech around -- and who also have deep pockets -- should consider the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Z Flip 7 or even the slightly cheaper Z Fold 7 FE.\nFinding the best Samsung phone will ultimately come down to preference. Choosing among so many options can get complicated, so here's how to decide which Samsung phone is best for you. Refer to our phone buying guide for more tips on how to choose the right device.\nBest Samsung phones in 2025\nPros\n- Best screen on any phone\n- Versatile cameras\n- Most powerful phone I've tested\n- Good battery life\nCons\n- $1,300 price\n- Design is almost too minimal\n- AI features are hit-or-miss\n- S25/S25 Plus have similar features and cost less\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra which has a lot of AI features, the best of which are interesting and the worst of which unreliable. Luckily, Samsung gets a lot of other things right on the S25 Ultra, which has a new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, high-resolution ultrawide camera, and some sweet pro video tools that rival the iPhone 16 Pro. Samsung wisely kept all the best parts of last year's Galaxy S24 Ultra (basically the entire phone including that antireflective display) but some of its worst parts, too, like the $1,300 price tag.\nIf you want the best screen you can find on any phone, get the S25 Ultra. If you want the most versatile phone cameras, get the S25 Ultra. If you want a stylus, get the S25 Ultra. But if your needs scale back on any of those fronts, the more affordable S25 options, or even last year's S24 Ultra, may be worth considering. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review.\nWhy we like it\nThe reason to get the Ultra over its S25 siblings is its screen, which is truly the best I've seen on any phone, and the cameras, which are a step above what the S25 and S25 Plus have. Added video features like ability to record in Log format gets the Ultra as close as it's ever been to the iPhone in terms of professional video capture.\nWho it's best for\nIf you have a Galaxy S22 Ultra or older, the S25 Ultra will seem like a significant upgrade. It's harder to make that case for S23 Ultra owners, who, unless their phone's battery is ailing or they can score an incredible discount, should otherwise sit this one out. And for you S24 Ultra owners, you don't need this phone. Save your money and treat yourself to a nice steak dinner and a movie.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra's appeal is muddied by its $1,300 price. The regular Galaxy S25 has the same functionality, power and longevity, and it costs $500 less. Want a bigger screen? Consider the Galaxy S25 Plus. For the majority of people, the regular Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will be a better fit.\nPros\n- Camera consistently delivers good images\n- Impressive battery life\n- More AI features feel practical\nCons\n- Several gimmicky AI features\n- Not many changes over the S24\nThe Galaxy S25's biggest flex that I noticed while testing is it shares many of the same attributes as its pricier counterparts, the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra \u2013 but it does so for several hundred dollars less. You'll find features like the AI Select tool, Audio Eraser and deeper Gemini integration across all of Samsung's S25 devices, as well as a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12GB RAM \u2013 making the smaller phone of the bunch still seem pretty mighty.\nAnd while the Galaxy S25 might look incredibly similar to the S24 and share many of the same specs, consistency isn't so bad when it means there's a consistently good camera and great battery life. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 review.\nWhy we like it\nHaving a baseline phone, like the Galaxy S25, that delivers many of the same perks as more expensive models, is a huge plus in my book. And given the remarkable processing power, standout camera and seamless AI integration in the Galaxy S25 lineup, it's great that I can get all those premium features for $800.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're someone who insists on buying a flagship device, the Galaxy S25 won't let you down. but if you have a device that's two years old or more, you might be enticed to tap into all the latest Galaxy AI and integrated Gemini features. Now, $800 isn't pocket change, and there are definitely other options for those who want to be more budget conscious, but if you're willing to spend a bit more, the baseline S25 can be a great all-around choice.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nYou probably don't need to upgrade if you're using last year's S24.\nPros\n- Thin 4.2mm design\n- 200-megapixel main camera\n- Powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor\n- Durable build\nCons\n- Steep $2,000 price tag\n- Same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's Fold\n- 25-watt wired charging\nWith the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung has finally addressed some of the key issues with its previous book-style foldables. The impressively thin build and wider, 6.5-inch cover screen makes this feel like a standard phone when closed, and that wider 8-inch inside display is great for multitasking, with the ability to run up to three apps simultaneously. Perhaps most notably, the camera gets a major upgrade with the addition of a 200-megapixel main camera, which takes shots on par with the top-of-the-line S25 Ultra.\nAltogether, it\u2019s a great choice if you want a bigger, tablet-like display without the bulk or a compromise on camera quality.\nWhy we like it\nThe Z Fold 7 does a solid job combining what's great about standard slate phones and what's great about foldables. It feels wonderfully normal to hold when closed, thanks to its sleek design and lightweight build. It also packs great cameras and has an expansive main display that's 11 percent bigger than last year's Z Fold 6.\nThankfully, a slimmer build doesn't force the battery to take a hit; the Z Fold 7 maintains that same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's foldable. That pales in comparison to batteries from Chinese competitors, but at least it's not a downgrade. The Z Fold 7 also packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor to power the many AI features you'll get onboard, from Galaxy AI photo and audio editing tools to Google's Gemini Live and Circle to Search. The phone also supports seven years of software and security updates.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're bored of standard slate phones and want something that feels a little more exciting, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a great choice. The slim design and wider cover screen helps it to feel as normal as possible when closed, with the added perk of an expansive main display that's great for multitasking and watching videos. The cameras are also impressive for a foldable that's so thin.\nWho shouldn't get it\nThe Z Fold 7's $2,000 price tag is perhaps its biggest caveat. Also, if you don't need a bigger display, it may not be worth the splurge. Ironically, the cover screen is so practical that you\u2019ll rarely need to open the phone -- unless you\u2019re watching movies or multitasking, in which case a phone like the Galaxy S25 Ultra might be a better fit.\nPros\n- The 6.9-inch screen is immersive, with lovely colors and contrast\n- The 4.1-inch screen looks incredible\n- It's durable and survived a drop onto concrete\n- One UI 8 (Android 16) runs wonderfully\n- $1,100 is still a lot, but Samsung gives the phone more value than the Flip 6\nCons\n- Gets warm when recording videos and playing games\n- Battery life is the same as the Flip 6 despite a bigger battery\n- Cover screen software has room to grow\nWhen I first got my hands on Samsung's new Galaxy Z Flip 7, I was delighted to discover that it has a smaller crease, larger cover screen, thinner design and bigger battery compared to last year's Galaxy Z Flip 6. But as I tested the new clamshell phone, I became enthralled by its inner screen. At 6.9 inches, this is the biggest screen on any Samsung phone aside from the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which has an 8-inch foldable display.\nThe Z Flip 7's large screen size makes content feel more immersive and colors look lovely and vivid. This led to epic TikTok and Instagram sessions, watching widescreen films such as A Working Man and Back to the Future, as well as jumping back and forth between two apps stacked vertically on the screen thanks to One UI 8's 90:10 split tool.\nEvery time I open the Flip 7, I'm consistently dumbfounded by how such a large display can unfurl from something about the size of a makeup compact. And when it's closed, there's a 4.1-inch cover screen that's fantastic in its own ways, with new clever animations for when you're recording a video, charging the phone or taking a selfie, all efficiently using the extra display real estate. In terms of functionality, though, the cover screen's software is about the same as the 3.4-inch one on the Flip 6.\nThe Flip 7 impressed me in nearly every way but one: its battery life. It has a larger battery than the Flip 6, but it doesn't last any longer in daily use. It did consistently get me through a day on a single charge, often having 15 to 20% left, but there were also a few days where it needed an early evening top-off.\nWhy we like it\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 is the most fully realized version of Samsung's ideal of a flip phone since the launch of the original Galaxy Z Flip in 2020. The Flip 7's appeal is simple: It's a thin phone with a big, bold screen that folds in half into a coaster-sized square. The larger cover screen and inner screen make content more immersive. It's design is thin (for a clamshell foldable) and comfortable to hold. Plus you get twice the storage this year compared to last.\nWho is it best for\nIf you've been tempted by a clamshell-style foldable, you should definitely consider the Flip 7. If you have a Galaxy Z Flip 4 or older, the Flip 7 will be an upgrade in every way. It's harder to make that same recommendation for Flip 5 owners unless your phone is showing its age. And if you have a Galaxy Z Flip 6, you can sit this one out unless you really want those larger screens.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nIf you spend a ton of time around dirt or sand, this phone isn't for you.\nPros\n- Excellent software and security support\n- 25-watt wired charging\n- Eye-catching Light Blue color option\nCons\n- Slow performance\n- Single audio speaker\n- Mediocre photography\nEditor's Note: Samsung has also released the Galaxy A16.\nSamsung\u2019s $200 Galaxy A15 5G is an easy choice for someone looking to buy a phone that will last for years. Samsung provides it with four years of software updates and five years of security support, which in this price range is unparalleled. Plus the phone supports 25W wired charging that in my testing was able to charge half of its big 5,000-mAh battery from empty in 30 minutes. I also like the eye-catching light blue option.\nA $200 phone has to have some compromises. The Galaxy A15 5G feels sluggish compared to competing phones like Motorola\u2019s $200 Moto G 5G, and as an entertainment machine falls short with its single audio speaker that is blocked by accident when you hold the phone sideways for games and video. Photography, which is typically a weak point on phones in this price range, is similarly mixed with decent photography in outdoor environments while struggling to photograph lowlight spaces. This makes the Galaxy A15 5G an easy choice for when you just need a phone that can handle the basics, but you may want to consider other options if you are looking for the best pocket YouTube player in this price range.\nPros\n- Lightning fast charging\n- Nice big screen\n- 7 years of OS and security upgrades\n- Great performance with games, movies and animations\nCons\n- Battery life is a day, similar to baseline S25\n- Similar specs as the S25 at a higher price\n- Rival phones at the same price have better cameras\nIf the baseline Galaxy S25 appeals to you but you'd rather have a bigger screen and higher battery capacity \u2013 without upgrading all the way to the Ultra \u2013 the S25 Plus may be the phone for you. The entire S25 lineup shares many features, from AI capabilities to processing power to memory, so the Plus may be a viable choice if you're looking for something right in the middle.\nThat said, the Plus' minimal upgrades over the baseline S25 may not justify the $200 price difference. But if a bigger phone just feels better to hold and you'd rather have a 4,900 mAh battery (over the S25's 4,000mAh one), then that $1,000 starting price might ultimately be worth every penny. Read CNET's full Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus review.\nWhy we like it\nWhile the baseline S25 checks all the key boxes, the S25 Plus can simply feel like a more comfortable device to use, especially if you're a fellow member of the bigger hands club. In addition to sharing many of the same features as the pricier S25 Ultra, the S25 Plus has a higher battery capacity than the baseline model -- though in CNET's tests, there weren't any major discrepancies in how the two batteries actually performed. Still, sometimes you just want to live a little larger, and this phone can be the perfect fit.\nWho it's best for\nIf you like having a larger screen to watch movies or play games on, the S25 Plus can be a great choice. While the S25 Ultra might be a top pick for someone who wants both a bigger phone and the most premium features, the S25 Plus can be that goldilocks device that meets you right in the middle -- without you having to spend $1,300 on the Ultra.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nIf you want the absolute best in terms of cameras, don't get the S25 Plus. For $1,000 phones like the Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro have better cameras. Or if you can afford to buy a $1,300 phone, check out the Galaxy S25 Ultra which has an amazing set of lenses\nPros\n- Lightweight design\n- 200-megapixel main camera\n- Durable titanium frame and Gorilla Glass front and back\n- Powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor\n- 12GB of RAM\nCons\n- Mediocre battery life\n- Only 25-watt wired charging\n- Steep price tag\n- Just two rear cameras\nThe Galaxy S25 Edge is a unique offering -- one that doesn't necessarily cater to most people's top priorities like longer battery life and an affordable price tag, and yet it still presents an alluring option with its slim frame and lightweight body. Thankfully, it doesn't scale back too much in the way of features and capabilities; it's got a powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and the same 200-megapixel main camera you'll find on the top-of-the-line S25 Ultra (though there's no telephoto lens).\nThe main sacrifice is battery life, as the S25 Edge has a 3,900-mAh battery, the lowest amount across the S25 series. It also only supports 25-watt wired charging. But it still offers enough juice to get you through the day, even if you're a notoriously heavy phone user. Plus, using something so remarkably feather-light feels like such a breath of fresh air, you may not mind making some compromises. Read our full Galaxy S25 Edge review.\nWhy we like it\nThe S25 Edge is surprisingly enjoyable to use and hold, given its lightweight design (it weighs 163 grams) and generous 6.7-inch screen. And despite its thinner frame, it feels surprisingly sturdy, thanks to its Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 display and Victus 2 backing. That means it doesn't feel like it's going to snap in your pocket -- and you'll hardly even feel it in there.\nWho it's best for\nIf you want a phone that feels light and can slip easily into your pocket, without compromising too much on functionality, the S25 Edge is a great option. Plus, if you're looking for a fresh form factor but aren't interested in venturing into foldables territory, this unique phone is a solid -- and more familiar-feeling -- choice.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you're looking for something more budget-friendly, the S25 Edge might not appeal to you. Also, if battery life is your top priority, the S25 Edge leaves something to be desired, since it only lasts about 24 hours before needing a recharge.\nBest Samsung phones compared\n| Samsung Galaxy S25 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge | Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 | Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7 | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.2-inch AMOLED;

The Galaxy S24 FE packs a good camera and costs only $650 before discounts or trade-in offers.\nTest your phone: It's worth going to a store and trying out a phone before you shell out hundreds of dollars for it.\nFind peace of mind with a case: You spent all this time picking a phone, now protect it from damage with a case.\nBe ready for Cyber Monday sales: The holidays usually bring big discounts and sales, even on phones.\nHow we test phones\nWe test every phone in real-world scenarios focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new software updates or to compare against new phones from competitors like Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus.\nPhotography\nPhotography is a major focus for most phones these days, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting levels. We try out any new camera modes such as 4K 120fps slow motion video that debuted with the iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max or AI reframe and focus on the Motorola Razr Plus (2024).\nBattery life\nBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long a phone lasts during a typical day of use, and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test, which isn't always included in the initial review and is added later in an update.\nPerformance\nWe perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of a particular phone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models.\nWe use benchmarking apps to measure the performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Of particular note are how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Or do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo.\nRead more: How We Test Phones\nOther Samsung phones we tested\nSamsung's $650 Galaxy S24 FE is such a comfort to use that at moments our reviewer, Mike Sorrentino, felt like he was testing a scaled-back version of the $1,000 Galaxy S24 Plus. The S24 FE's large 6.7-inch 120Hz refresh-rate display made it easy for me to enjoy streaming shows, playing games and taking video calls throughout the day. And it includes nearly every software perk from the more expensive Galaxy S24 line. Read our full review of the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE."

Also reads to/from USB sticks with USB-C\n4) Stylus works super good without screen protector, but may vary with screen protector. That is a function of screen protector so may need to experiment with different screen protectors (thickness, material).\n5) Stylus is not that needed for me. However I have used it to write notes, but you can whatsapp yourself for notes too.\n6) 5G. 5G depends on networks around and many times 5G sucks so far. But if the bandwidth is there, it is nice.\n7) Weight is no problem. feels normal to me even though battery life lasts without having to charge all day even with heavy use.\n8) wireless charging. works well. has turbo charging with the right capacity charger (15W to 30W)\n9) The case material is nice and durable. With acrylic cover looks gold. Charges through a normal cover but if you use heavy duty thick cases will not charge wirelessly then. Function of case thickness.\n10) Display is nice. durable.\n11) Without case may have to watch so you do not loose stylus. It locks, but without case is easy to unlock and drop/lose stylus. Just be aware of it.\n12) price/value is outstanding.\nbad:\nnothing really, there will always be a complainer. but for the money one cannot ask for more.\n- Reviewed in the United States on March 27, 2025Color: Caramel LatteVerified PurchaseThe Motorola moto G Stylus 5G 2024, Unlocked, Made for US, 8/256GB, 50MP Camera, Caramel Latte is a fantastic device.\nThis was purchased for my mother, to replace a previous device that was beginning to have serious problems.\nAfter getting everything transferred from her old failing device and setting it up with all of the current updates, it looks exactly like what she is used to seeing.\nWith HUGE differences:\n1. It is incredibly quick.\n2. Everything is functional.\n3. Screen inputs are precise, and touch sensitive.\nThe value is superb.

No it does not.\nHowever, at a cost of less than 25% of those devices, it provides a majority of the same features and functions.

      "text": "Pros\n- Camera consistently delivers good images\n- Impressive battery life\n- More AI features feel practical\nCons\n- Still some stray gimmicky AI features\n- Not many changes over the S24\nPros\n- Lightning fast charging\n- Nice big screen\n- 7 years of OS and security upgrades\n- Great performance\nCons\n- Battery life is similar to the baseline S25\n- Similar specs as the S25, at a higher price\n- Better cameras on other phones at the same price\nSamsung's mantra when debuting the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus appears to have been, \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it,\" as this year's phones share a striking resemblance to last year's S24 and S24 Plus. But what the new phones lack in innovation, they make up for in consistency and practicality.\nWhile I found myself warming up to (most of) the AI upgrades separating the S25 and S25 Plus from their predecessors, there are other time-tested attributes that remain more important to me \u2013 namely, cameras and battery life. Still, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I grew to like certain AI-powered features after using the phones for a week.\nFor instance, there's a new tool called AI Select that looks at your phone's screen and suggests actions like summarizing or translating text. Also, the Gallery app can find a picture you're looking for with more conversational search terms, and Audio Eraser can clean up distracting background noises in your videos.\nGoogle's Gemini has been further baked into the Galaxy's interface and can be summoned with a long press of the side power button to answer questions and carry out tasks as your assistant.\nAt a time when major phone releases are as high-stakes as ever, Samsung tries to set the $800 Galaxy S25 and $1,000 Galaxy S25 Plus apart by leaning into what's new (AI), as well as the familiar (good cameras and battery life). And I am definitely impressed.\nGalaxy S25 and S25 Plus: Look and feel\nSo what's the difference between the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus? Not much. Other than the Plus being, well, bigger than the baseline model.\nThe phones both have AMOLED displays with 120Hz adaptive refresh rates, with the S25's measuring 6.2 inches and the S25 Plus clocking in at 6.7 inches. At 162 and 190 grams respectively, the S25 and S25 Plus feel light in hand, thanks to their aluminum frames. The screens are covered in Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2, and the matte glass backs offer an elegant touch and premium feel.\nI (hesitantly) dunked the S25 Plus into a shallow pool at Filoli Historic House & Garden near San Francisco during testing and am happy to report it survived unscathed. This shouldn't come as a surprise, since both the S25 and S25 Plus have an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, meaning they can survive being submerged for 30 minutes under 1.5 meters of water (or about 5 feet).\nThe phones come in navy, icy blue, mint and silver shadow, as well as the online-exclusive colors blue black, coral red and pink gold. I absolutely adore the icy blue color of the S25 I've been using, and the Plus I have in navy also looks nice and rich.\nThe S25 and S25 Plus arrive with Android 15 and Samsung's One UI 7. And similar to the Pixel 9 series, you'll get seven years of OS and security updates, helping you get the most bang for your buck (and there's certainly a lot of buck involved here). The phones are powered by a custom-built Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, helping to bring those many, many AI features to life.\nThe best thing about AI is that I hardly notice it\nI'm not alone in feeling severe AI fatigue. As someone who tends to be AI-averse (do I really need it to write my emails, brainstorm ideas or summarize a PDF?), I tend to be wary of AI-heavy announcements like the one Samsung had at its Galaxy Unpacked event in January.\nOnce I got my hands on the devices, I put my skepticism aside and was surprised.\nAfter a few days, I found myself leaning on Gemini for help with everything from tweaking email settings (this was faster than Googling and reading), caring for my wood cutting board, and finding events and sending corresponding texts via a single voice command.\nUltimately, it's the AI features that operate discreetly that won me over, like Circle to Search. This is a Google-powered feature that came out last year and lets you circle anything on your screen to quickly see product information and links. Now, Circle to Search can recognize a song playing in the background of a video or even a tune you hum or sing, and I had a lot of fun testing this out. When I hummed niche Taylor Swift songs like I Hate It Here and Foolish One, it nailed both. (Step aside, Shazam.) To be fair, I'm not sure how often I'll use this particular aspect of Circle to Search, but the tool as a whole remains impressive.\nThe AI Select tool also served me well, but primarily for translating text. My Spanish vocab has (sadly) gotten rusty since high school. So when I came across an email in Spanish, I tapped the tool on the right-hand side of the screen, circled the text I wanted to translate and within a couple taps, it was quickly transformed into English (and hopefully, accurately).\nNot all AI features are a home run, though. Portrait Studio, which uses AI to create stylized portraits (kind of like caricatures an artist might sketch of you at the beach or on a boardwalk), is fun to play with but feels like a novelty. It did an admittedly great job replicating details like my hijab, eye shape and smile. But I'm not sure how useful a tool like this is in the long run. Similarly, Drawing Assist, which turns your sketches into different stylized illustrations, is impressive at transforming my crappy drawings into pleasing images. I don't have any real use for this tool, as I'm not going to be framing these random images of cats and flowers.\nThe biggest disappointment, so far, has been the Now Brief. This is designed to learn your habits \u2013 like if you usually check the weather, read the news and consult your calendar each morning \u2013 then surface any relevant suggestions to simplify those routines. In the week I used these phones, the only time I was even slightly impressed with this feature was when it showed a highlight of the images I'd taken that day. But otherwise, Now Brief simply lists the weather, my events that day and articles that are irrelevant 90% of the time. That's not to say it won't eventually learn more about me and get better, but it hasn't proven its value just yet.\nPhotos and videos are even better with AI\nThe Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus share the same camera specs as last year's series: a 50-megapixel wide camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and 10-megapixel 3x telephoto camera. They also both share a 12-megapixel front-facing camera. So you'll get the same kinds of images on both the S25 and S25 Plus.\nI've always admired the punchy colors in Galaxy S photos, and the S25 and S25 Plus were no exception. Here are a few of my favorite shots.\nThis is one of the best examples of how each shade of color, from pale pinks to vibrant reds, pop. There's so much texture in this image below, from the ripples on the water to the droplets on the petals, and the background maintains just enough detail and color without robbing the spotlight.\nPortrait mode on the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus is perhaps the most impressive I've seen, as it does the best job of knowing what to keep in sharp focus and what to blur. Even in this picture below of my (dying) tulips, each leaf and petal remains clearly in the foreground and isn't lost to background blur.\nPortrait mode isn't perfect, of course, as some of the many branches in this shot do get the undesired blur effect. But it's such a minor detail that hopefully all you'll notice is how well the flowers on the table pop.\nThe improvements over previous Galaxy S devices come in the form of \u2013 yes, AI. Generative Edit debuted on the S24 series, but is now processed on device, allowing you to quickly and easily remove photobombers or objects cluttering your image. I tried this out with both people and objects and was blown away each time. Generative Edit did a seamless job filling in backgrounds (sometimes even generating new graffiti patterns, as seen below when I removed a railing).\nOne downside, though an upside for transparency, is that there's a label on images that have benefitted from Generative Edit disclosing that this is \"AI-generated content.\" I understand the importance of this, especially as AI gets better at fooling people, but object removal features are nothing new to photography.\nSamsung introduced a Virtual Aperture tool that mimics a standalone camera's f-stops, using the separate Expert RAW app. If you're a pro photographer, I can see this being a cool feature to have. But as someone who likes things plain and simple, I'm going to stick with the camera's built-in Portrait mode so that factors like background blur and lighting are sorted out for me.\nAnother AI-related boost comes in the form of nighttime videos. I was impressed with how rich the dark sky looks in videos I recorded and with how smooth the motion appears as I panned the camera. Daytime videos also looked solid.\nPhotos at night were splendid, with rich contrast and saturation.\nNight mode also did a great job of brightening up this image to almost make it look as if it were taken in the daytime, and not at 7 p.m.\nSelfies maintain the smoothing effect I so love on Galaxy S phones, while maintaining vibrancy and crispness in the foreground and background.\nBattery life and performance\nBattery capacity is one of the few factors separating the phones, with the S25 sporting a 4,000-mAh battery and the Plus packing a 4,900-mAh battery.\nBoth phones lasted about a day and a half with regular use. In CNET's 45-minute endurance test, which involves a combination of streaming, scrolling through social media, joining a video call and playing games, the S25's battery dropped from full to 93% (the same as last year's S24), while the battery on the S25 Plus dropped to 94%.\nIn a longer, 3-hour streaming test over Wi-Fi, in which I watched a YouTube video in full-screen mode at full brightness, the S25 dropped from 100% to 85%, while the S25 Plus dropped to 86%.\nYouTube streaming battery test\n| Phone | After 1 hour | After 2 hours | After 3 hours |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Galaxy S25 | 96% | 90% | 85% |\n| Galaxy S25 Plus | 96% | 91% | 86% |\n| Galaxy S24 FE | 96% | 90% | 83% |\n| Galaxy S24 | 97% | 91% | 86% |\n| Galaxy S24 Plus | 97% | 91% | 87% |\nHigher percentages are better.\nThe S25 supports 25-watt charging, while the S25 Plus supports 45-watt charging. In a 30-minute test using a 30-watt charger, the S25 went from 0% to 47%, and reached 100% in 80 minutes. In the same test using a 45-watt charger, the S25 Plus went from 0% to 63% in 30 minutes, and reached a full charge in 70 minutes. For comparison, in last year's test, the S24 went from 0% to 51% in 30 minutes, and the S24 Plus went from 0% to 50%.\nThe Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus also support 15-watt wireless charging, which is the same as what you'll get with Qi2. You can use Samsung's own case with the Qi2 magnetic profile or a compatible third-party case to tap into those wireless capabilities.\nBenchmark tests for the CPU in Geekbench 6 place the S25 and S25 Plus well above the entire Galaxy S24 lineup. In a graphics test using 3D Mark's Wild Life Extreme, the S25 and S25 Plus exceeded the performance of the iPhone 16 Pro, Galaxy S24 and S24 Ultra.\nCheck out the graphs below for more specifics.\nFinal thoughts: Which phone to buy, the S25 or S25 Plus?\nPerhaps the highest praise I can give to a phone in 2025 is that there was just enough AI to not make me go crazy. The S25 and S25 Plus have their fair share of AI-powered features, but for the most part, there are only several that I can see myself willingly using. Others like Portrait Studio and Drawing Assist may be fun for keynote demos, but don't seem to serve a real purpose beyond that. (But it wouldn't be a Galaxy phone without a flashy feature no one uses, right??)\nThankfully, the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus continue to deliver on what, to me, makes the Galaxy S series notable: good cameras, solid battery life and a seamless interface.\nBecause there are so many similarities between the S25 and S25 Plus, and the higher battery capacity on the Plus didn't result in any startling differences (although superfast charging is great), I'd personally save some money and just go with the baseline S25. If you want a bigger phone, it might be worth going a full step up with the S25 Ultra, so you could take advantage of added perks like that 50-megapixel ultrawide lens, but that costs $500 more than the regular S25. Still, the S25 and S25 Plus share many similarities with the Ultra, including Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, 12GB RAM and AI features, so you'll be getting a relatively good value from that baseline model.\nIf you have a Galaxy S22 or older, switching to the S25 or S25 Plus could be a significant upgrade. If you have an S23, you can benefit from improved battery life and dip your toes into Samsung's newer AI waters. But if you're rocking an S24, there's no reason to pay for relatively modest upgrades.\nUltimately, the S25 and S25 are much the same as what we've seen before. But that isn't such a bad thing, when \"the same\" largely still does the trick.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 specs vs. Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus, Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24 Plus\n| Samsung Galaxy S25 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus | Samsung Galaxy S24 | Samsung Galaxy S24 Plus | |\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.2-inch AMOLED; 2,340x1,080 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.7-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.2-inch AMOLED; 2,340x1,080 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.7-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 416 ppi | 509 ppi | 416 ppi | 509 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 5.78 x 2.78 x 0.28 in. | 6.24 x 2.98 x 0.29 in. | 5.79 x 2.78 x 0.3 in. | 6.24 x 3 x 0.3 in. |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm | 158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm | 147 x 71 x 7.6 mm | 158 x 76 x 7.6 mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 162 g (5.71 oz.) | 190 g (6.70 oz.) | 168g (5.93 oz.) | 197g (6.95 oz.) |\n| Mobile software | Android 15 | Android 15 | Android 14 | Android 14 |\n| Camera | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) |\n| Front-facing camera | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 8K | 8K | 8K | 8K |\n| Processor | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 |\n| RAM + storage | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB | 8GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB |\n| Expandable storage | None | None | None | None |\n| Battery | 4,000 mAh | 4,900 mAh | 4,000 mAh | 4,900 mAh |\n| Fingerprint sensor | Under display | Under display | Under display | Under display |\n| Connector | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C |\n| Headphone jack | None | None | None | None |\n| Special features | 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; 25W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 7 | 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; 25W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 7; ultrawideband | 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; 25W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 6E | 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; 45W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 6E |\n| US price starts at | $800 (128GB) | $1,000 (256GB) | $800 (128GB) | $1,000 (256GB) |\nHow we test phones\nEvery phone tested by CNET's reviews team was actually used in the real world. We test a phone's features, play games and take photos. We examine the display to see if it's bright, sharp and vibrant. We analyze the design and build to see how it is to hold and whether it has an IP-rating for water resistance. We push the processor's performance to the extremes using standardized benchmark tools like GeekBench and 3DMark, along with our own anecdotal observations navigating the interface, recording high-resolution videos and playing graphically intense games at high refresh rates.\nAll the cameras are tested in a variety of conditions from bright sunlight to dark indoor scenes. We try out special features like night mode and portrait mode and compare our findings against similarly priced competing phones. We also check out the battery life by using it daily as well as running a series of battery drain tests.\nWe take into account additional features like support for 5G, satellite connectivity, fingerprint and face sensors, stylus support, fast charging speeds and foldable displays, among others that can be useful. We balance all of this against the price to give you the verdict on whether that phone, whatever price it is, actually represents good value. While these tests may not always be reflected in CNET's initial review, we conduct follow-up and long-term testing in most circumstances."

The screen is too big and very unresponsive at the center of the screen while the edges are extremely responsive at slight touch of the palm of my small hand. It's also lagging compared to my S10+ and the powerful camera is uselessly blurry because it takes too long to AI which is supposed to help-focus. I also find the phone battery to drain faster than my S10+ and the Wifi, Bluetooth connection cut off from time to time. The S23 ultra brightness bar is also badly designed compared to the S10+(you can't slowly increase or decrease the brightness on the S23 Ultra like it is on the S10+. A slight slide of the S23 Ultra brightness bar increases or decrease the brightness too much making you waste time trying to find the right middle.

I expected the way around because the S23 Ultra has a bigger battery(it might be because I have too many apps on the S23 Ultra which drains battery faster but it doesn't make any sense to me that the S23 Ultra that drains battery faster is also charging faster).\nI also dislike that Samsung is forcing us to use the new 6-PIN lock on new phones in order to get the option of unlocking your phone by typing your 6 digit PIN without pressing the OK button. On my S23 Utra, when I type my PIN code 1234(example of pin), it unlocks. On S24 Fe, I have to typing 123456 to unlock it. If you use a pin code like 1234 on S24 Fe, you must also press OK to unlock. A small detail but very annoying if you're using your phone as an Uber/Lyft driver where you need to keep your eyes on a busy road while typing a longer PIN code.

This is a little (tiny) bit larger and heavier than the S22 I was previously carrying - and that was a concern. Part of me likes to be able to manipulate my phone with one hand at times - but the extra screen real-estate is well worth having to grab it with both hands sometime. And the tad extra weight - well that's all about solid construction and a slightly larger battery - that has wiped all 'battery anxiety' away through out the day. I use my phone for trading (the stock market) all through out the day - handling it hundreds of times a day during market hours sometimes - and it powers right through. So great battery life! I did put a great case on it. I suggest a good case on any phone that's got this weight - otherwise - if it slips and hits the ground, it won't be a great day. My general experience w samsung phones is that it will last as long as I need it to, if I take care of it. Certainly well into the need for my next phone. And by the way, moving from Samsung to Samsung is made very easy by the 'sync' software which walks you through getting your new phone set up, in the image of your old phone. So great job there to Samsung.

However, I've found that this phone doesn't disappoint. It's on the more affordable side, so if you need to get a few for a family plan, it's a great deal when it's on sale. With that being said, it doesn't lack in performance: fast, charges fast, really good battery life, nice display and pretty good camera. Pretty good for playing games on it too. It's a much bigger phone than the previous models. Put an Otterbox and screen protector on it, dropped it a ton of times and it's totally fine. Also, so easy to transfer all my stuff from my old phone to this one.

      "url": "https://www.cnet.com/tech/mobile/my-hands-on-with-the-samsung-galaxy-s25-edge-has-me-reconsidering-a-thin-phone/",
      "text": "I've used plenty of different phones in several form factors: large ones, small ones, phones that fold in ways that seem too fragile to work. But as I hold Samsung's super-thin and light -- yet surprisingly sturdy -- Galaxy S25 Edge, the first word that comes to mind is \"airy.\" My next thought is: If I were the S25 Plus, I'd be worried.\nIn my early hands-on with the S25 Edge at a preview event in New York, I was struck by how much the new phone carries over from its S25 counterparts. It maintains the 200-megapixel wide camera from the S25 Ultra, the 6.7-inch display from the S25 Plus and the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor you'll find across the other three S25 devices. But it does so within a sleek, 5.8mm titanium frame, clocking in at 163 grams. It feels like something I can throw in my bag or pocket and hardly notice.\nIn fact, the S25 Edge strikes me as exactly what a middle-of-the-line flagship phone should be: a fresh, elevated take on the baseline model, which pulls in premium features to justify its $1,100 price. The exciting design, Ultra-level wide camera and spacious display actually make this an enticing option for anyone who wants something a little out of the ordinary.\nBut that's not to say there aren't any compromises in store, the most notable being the battery; more on that later.\nPreorders for the Galaxy S25 Edge are open now, and the phone will arrive on May 30. It comes in three colors: silver, jet black and icy blue.\nWhat makes the S25 Edge stand out\nThe biggest question leading up to the release of the S25 Edge has been: Why would someone want a thinner phone anyway? After spending a little time with the device, I began to see the appeal.\nWhile the S25 Edge's thickness may not be visually striking at first glance, getting your hands on the phone is a different story. Comparing how the S25 Edge's 5.8mm, 163g frame feels to the S25 and S25 Plus, I registered just how much thinner and lighter it really is. For reference, the baseline S25 is 7.2mm thick and weighs 162g, but has a smaller 6.2-inch screen. The S25 Plus has the same 6.7-inch display as the Edge, but is 7.3mm thick and weighs 190g. It's a noticeable difference.\nThe moment of truth was applying some force to the phone to see if it gave at all. Impressively, it felt quite sturdy. (If not, I'd probably have gotten myself into some trouble with Samsung.) It touts a Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 display, along with a Gorilla Glass Victus 2 backing. My initial impression is that you shouldn't have to worry about accidentally turning the S25 Edge into a foldable by keeping it in your back pocket, but that's certainly something I'll have to test in my review. The S25 Edge also maintains the same IP68 rating for dust and water resistance you'll find on the other S25 series phones.\nThe biggest trade-off, at least on paper, appears to be battery capacity. The Galaxy S25 Edge's 3,900 mAh battery pales in comparison to what you'll get on the baseline S25 (4,000 mAh) and the S25 Plus (4,900 mAh). Samsung isn't sharing how many hours you'll get out of the S25 Edge's battery, other than stating it'll last you all day. That's something else I look forward to testing. The S25 Edge supports 25-watt wired charging and 15-watt wireless charging.\nWith thinner phones, camera hardware can also be scaled back. But the S25 Edge boasts three cameras: a 200-megapixel wide, a 12-megapixel ultrawide and a 12-megapixel selfie camera. Megapixels aren't everything, so I'm eager to see how that all translates into real-world photography. Samsung points to Galaxy AI for helping to boost camera quality and for powering photo editing features like Generative Edit.\nLike the S25 Plus, the S25 Edge has 12GB of RAM and 256GB and 512GB storage options. It'll cost a little more than the S25 Plus, though: $1,100 for 256GB and $1,220 for 512GB. But it's still priced lower than the top-of-the-line $1,300 S25 Ultra.\nYou'll find the same Galaxy AI features Samsung has been touting on the rest of its S25 phones, like Sketch to Image and Audio Eraser. Gemini features are also onboard, like Gemini Live and Circle to Search.\nOn the edge of a new trend\nThe launch of the Galaxy S25 Edge comes amid a thin-phone phenomenon. Earlier this year, Oppo released its super-thin Find N5 foldable, which it calls the \"world's thinnest book-style foldable,\" measuring just 8.93mm thick when closed and 4.21mm thick when opened. Apple is also rumored to be developing a thinner \"Air\" version of the iPhone 17. And at MWC 2025, phone maker Tecno showed off its Spark Slim phone concept, which measures 5.75mm thick and weighs just 146 grams, according to the company.\nDepending on how consumers respond, the S25 Edge could be the phone to help kickstart the thin phone craze. If people don't have to compromise too much when it comes to camera, storage and battery -- three of the biggest considerations when buying a phone, according to a CNET survey -- they could be inclined to pay up for a fresh form factor. After all, phones have become rather boring and predictable, apart from a handful of foldable options. The S25 Edge could be a breath of fresh air.\nI look forward to seeing how the S25 Edge holds up in the real world and whether it truly can maintain its edge (I had to do it).\nGalaxy S25 Edge vs. Galaxy S25 vs. Galaxy S25 Plus vs. Galaxy S25 Ultra\n| Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge | Samsung Galaxy S25 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.7-inch AMOLED; 3,200x1,800 pixels; 120Hz refresh rate | 6.2-inch AMOLED; 2,340x1,080 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.7-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate | 6.8-inch AMOLED; 3,120x1,440 pixels; 1-120Hz adaptive refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 548 ppi | 416 ppi | 509 ppi | 501 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 2.98 x 6.23 x 0.23 inches | 5.78 x 2.78 x 0.28 in. | 6.24 x 2.98 x 0.29 in. | 6.41 x 3.06 x 0.32 in. |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 75.6 X 158.2 X 5.8mm | 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm | 158.4 x 75.8 x 7.3 mm | 162.8 x 77.6 x 8.2 mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 163g (5.75 oz) | 162g (5.71 oz) | 190g (6.70 oz) | 218g (7.69 oz) |\n| Mobile software | Android 15 | Android 15 | Android 15 | Android 15 |\n| Camera | 200-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) | 200-megapixel (wide), 50-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto), 50-megapixel (5x telephoto) |\n| Front-facing camera | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel | 12-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 8K | 8K | 8K | 8K |\n| Processor | Snapdragon 8 Elite | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy |\n| RAM + storage | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB | 12GB RAM + 256GB, 512GB, 1TB |\n| Expandable storage | No | None | None | None |\n| Battery | 3,900 mAh | 4,000 mAh | 4,900 mAh | 5,000 mAh |\n| Fingerprint sensor | Under display | Under display | Under display | Under display |\n| Connector | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C |\n| Headphone jack | None | None | None | None |\n| Special features | IP88 rating, 5G, One UI 7, 25-watt wired charging, 15-watt wireless charging, Galaxy AI, Gemini, Circle to Search, Wi-Fi 7. | 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; 25W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 7 | 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; 25W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 7; ultrawideband | Titanium frame, 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; integrated S Pen; UWB for finding other devices; 45W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 7; Gorilla Glass Armor cover glass; ultrawideband |\n| US price starts at | $1,100 | $800 (128GB) | $1,000 (256GB) | $1,300 (256GB) |\n| UK price starts at | TBA | \u00a3799 (128GB) | \u00a3999 (256GB) | \u00a31,249 (256GB) |\n| Australia price starts at | TBA | AU$1,399 (256GB) | AU$1,699 (256GB) | AU$2,149 (256GB) |"

      "text": "Pros\n- Lightweight and comfortable\n- Very good sound quality\n- Decent noise canceling\n- Excellent voice-calling performance\n- Lights in buds are kind of cool\n- Built-in voice controls (no wake word required)\nCons\n- A little pricey\n- Design looks a tad generic\n- Noise canceling could be slightly better\nSamsung's Galaxy Buds 3 and Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are the company's first earbuds to feature stems in their designs, and some folks are mocking Samsung for creating another Apple AirPods clone in a sea of AirPods clones. There's some truth to that, but ultimately, what matters is how well these earbuds fit, sound and perform. They get high marks in those departments, though I did have a few small gripes.\nThe two buds are similar in many ways -- they share a lot of the same features -- but also have some key differences. The Galaxy Buds 3 ($180) are open buds like the AirPods 3 and are designed for people who don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears. The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro ($250), on the other hand, are noise-isolating earbuds like the AirPods Pro 2.\nRead more: Best wireless earbuds of 2024\nBoth are available in silver or white, and their prices are very similar to those of corresponding AirPods models, which puts them in premium earbuds territory. They also have similar battery life ratings to the AirPods. The Buds 3 have up to 6 hours of battery life with noise canceling off and 5 hours with it on, while the Buds 3 Pro last up to 6 hours with ANC off and 5 hours with it on.\nBoth sets are equipped with Bluetooth 5.4, are IP57 water- and dust-resistant and support LE audio along with the new Auracast feature (Samsung's 360 audio feature is also on board). An IP57 rating means the buds aren't fully waterproof, but they can withstand a sustained spray of water.\nGalaxy Buds 3 Pro design\nAll earbuds with stems look pretty similar, so it's easy to complain that the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro's design looks a little generic and is short on wow factor. Some have said they're a little cheap-looking, and that may be so, but the case does have a solid feel to it, and the buds themselves don't look any cheaper than the AirPods.\nSamsung has tried to distinguish its stems -- it calls them blades -- from the AirPods' rounded pipes by giving them an angular design with a bit of a Tesla Cybertruck vibe, especially in the silver ones.\nFrom what Samsung has told me, it simply found through its testing that the blade design worked the best for most people. A lot of folks had fit issues with Galaxy Buds Live and the Galaxy Buds Pro 2 (I had to use my own larger ear tips with them), and from my wear tests, the new design will be a better fit for more people. I found them lightweight and comfortable to wear, and so did fellow CNET editor Lisa Eadicicco, who reviewed Samsung's latest foldable phones, the Z Flip 6 and Z Fold 6.\nGetting a tight seal is crucial for optimal sound quality and noise-canceling performance. The Galaxy Wear app tests the seal quality, and I passed using the largest ear tips, though a slightly larger tip option would've been nice, especially since the ear tips are custom-designed for the buds, making it tricky to find other tips that work. The same is true for the AirPods Pro 2. Ironically, I was able to get some third-party foam tips made for the AirPods Pro 2 to click onto the Buds 3 Pro's posts, but the tips didn't give me a tight seal, according to the seal test.\nThe Buds 3 Pro have lights in their blades while the Buds 3 don't. I like them, though it'd be cool if they changed colors (they only glow white). They let you know when the buds are in pairing mode, and they flash when you use the Find My feature, while the buds make a chirping noise, making the buds easier to find in a dark room. You can also just activate the lights by pinching and holding each bud for a few seconds and wear the buds around with the lights on if that's your thing. They can remain fully lit or fade in and out.\nThese earbuds have pinch controls similar to the AirPods and swipe controls for volume adjustment. You just run your finger up the side of either bud to raise or lower the volume. The buds' pinch and swipe controls work well.\nGalaxy Buds 3 Pro features\nThe Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro share many features, including active noise canceling. They also have identical cases that offer wireless and USB-C charging, along with a dedicated Bluetooth button that makes it easier to pair any Bluetooth audio device. However, the Buds 3 Pro do have a couple of extra features and a more robust feature set overall.\nThey have ear-detection sensors (your music automatically pauses when you remove a bud from your ear) and support LE audio along with the new Auracast feature that allows you to hear Bluetooth broadcasts in public places like gyms. Samsung's 360 audio feature is also on board with head-tracking, similar to the AirPods 3 and AirPods Pro 2's spatial audio feature.\nI used the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro with an iPhone 14 Pro as well as Samsung's Galaxy Flip 5. The audio wouldn't automatically switch between my iPhone and Flip 5, but Samsung users get automatic pairing and switching between their Galaxy devices, including laptops, so I was able to pair the buds with my Galaxy Tab 8 Plus and Flip 5 and have the audio automatically switch back and forth between them.\nThe Buds 3 Pro's ambient mode, which lets sound into the buds, also seems very good. You can adjust the levels, but I thought it sounded quite natural in the middle setting with no audible hiss.\nAdditionally, the Buds 3 Pro have something similar to the AirPods Pro 2's Adaptive Audio features. Samsung says the buds \"constantly collect and identify surrounding sound and automatically adjust the optimal level of noise and sound without manual adjustment through Adaptive Noise Control, Siren Detect and Voice Detect.\"\nBuds 3 Pro's Voice Detect feature (it can be toggled on or off in the Galaxy Wear app) is similar to Apple's Conversation Awareness mode that lowers the volume of the music or any audio your listening to and activates the buds' ambient mode when you start talking to someone. Instead of pausing your music, it just reduces the volume to a low level. It's a useful feature.\nOn the voice front, the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have a pretty cool feature that Samsung probably doesn't hype enough: Built-in voice controls that allow you to raise and lower volume, pause and play your music, skip tracks forward and back, and answer and end calls. No wake word is required (you can set up the buds to use Samsung's Bixby voice assistant if you want, but I didn't). For example, you simply say, \"play music,\" \"next song\" or \"volume down.\" There are a limited number of voice commands, and you do have to have an Android device to activate the feature in the Galaxy Wear app. But once you toggle it on, it worked just fine while I was using my Galaxy devices as well as my iPhone.\nSamsung highlights that the Buds 3 Pro work with its Galaxy-exclusive Interpreter feature that's part of Galaxy AI. But the feature would presumably work with any buds. \"If you're attending a class in a foreign language, you can turn on Interpreterin Listening mode on the Galaxy Z Fold 6 or Flip 6 with Buds 3 series plugged into your ears,\" Samsung says, citing one example of how to use the feature. That allows you to hear the lecture translated directly through your Buds.\nGalaxy Buds 3 Pro noise-canceling performance\nThe Buds 3 Pro's active noise canceling is good, at least on par with the noise canceling you get with the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro and maybe slightly better. That said, it appears to be slightly behind the ANC on AirPods Pro 2, Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds and Sony WF-1000XM5 buds.\nAside from using them in various environments, including the New York City subway, I tested the noise-canceling with an HVAC unit running in my apartment. Those competing models were able to muffle just a tad more noise from the unit. Of course, how good a seal you get from the ear tips you're using is crucial to noise-canceling performance, so make sure you have a tight seal.\nFor those of you wondering how the Galaxy Buds 3's active noise canceling compares to the Buds 3 Pro's, there really isn't a comparison. Like Samsung's earlier Galaxy Buds Live (aka The Beans), the Buds 3 have some active noise canceling, but it just doesn't do much because ANC typically doesn't work well with open buds. I couldn't really tell a difference when I turned it on with the Buds 3, though I did notice the sound changed a bit when I engaged ANC. Maybe there's a bit of ambient sound filtration, but if you're looking for real noise canceling, you want the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro.\nGalaxy Buds 3 Pro sound quality\nSamsung owns Harman, which has brands like JBL and AKG under its umbrella. But there's no longer \"Sound by AKG\" stamped on these Galaxy Buds cases, so Samsung seems to have moved away from that little branding tie-in.\nWhile the Galaxy Buds 3 have a single 11mm driver, the Buds 3 Pro feature dual drivers -- a 10mm dynamic driver paired with a Planar tweeter that enhances treble performance. Samsung also says the Buds 3 Pro have dual amps, which helps reduce wireless hiccups.\nCompared to the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, the Buds 3 Pro do sound better. I like the sound of the Buds 2 Pro, but the Buds 3 Pro's treble clarity and bass definition are superior, and they sound cleaner and more accurate overall.\nIn fact, I thought the Buds 3 Pro even sounded a little better than the AirPods Pro 2. They're a touch more dynamic and sound slightly punchier overall, with more sparkle to their treble. They are pretty well-balanced at their default setting with good stereo separation and decent openness. Android users can tweak the sound using the Galaxy Wear app's equalizer, but there's no app for iPhone users. (I don't advise that iPhone users buy these buds unless they have an Android device to pair them with because all updates and settings are only available via the Galaxy Wear app.)\nSome of my test tracks include Spoon's Knock Knock Knock, Athletes of God's Don't Wanna Be Normal, The Doors' Touch Me - Take 3, Orbital's Dirty Rat, Taylor Swift's Vigilante Shit, Prince's Condition of the Heart, Jvke's Golden Hour and Bjork's Hollow.\nBoth new Galaxy Buds models support the Samsung Seamless Codec that Samsung says is now capable of delivering 24-bit/96kHz high-resolution streams with an HD music streaming service like Qobuz or Tidal. That codec is only available with certain Galaxy devices, but the buds' default audio codec is AAC, which tends to sound just fine.\nI listened to tracks on my Galaxy Flip 5 using Qobuz and, frankly, only heard a very subtle difference in sound quality from listening to the same tracks on my iPhone using Qobuz and Spotify. You have to be a pretty sophisticated listener to hear any differences.\nGalaxy Buds 3 Pro voice-calling performance\nI was really impressed with the voice-calling performance. Samsung has for the most part done a good job with voice-calling performance in its previous Galaxy Buds models, but these new Series 3 models deliver even better voice-calling performance with top-notch noise reduction.\nEach bud has three microphones and a voice pickup unit. Earbuds with a stem design bring the microphones a little closer to your mouth, which helps with voice calling. In my calls using the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro in the noisy streets of New York (with some wind), callers said they could barely hear any background noise and that my voice was mostly clear with limited warbling. Check out my companion video review for a sample call I recorded with a CNET colleague.\nGalaxy Buds 3 Pro final thoughts\nIf you're able to get a tight seal with one of the three sizes of included ear tips, there's little to complain about with the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro. Yes, the noise-canceling might be a touch better, but the earbuds' sound quality is clearly improved from the Buds 2 Pro. Plus, they have a robust feature set, and their voice-calling performance is truly top-notch. (Hopefully, Samsung will add some features with future firmware updates as Apple has with the AirPods Pro 2).\nThe $250 list price is a little high. But Samsung often runs trade-in deals or has discounts on accessories like earbuds when you buy a new Galaxy phone, so most people won't pay anywhere near full price for these -- and you shouldn't either. It's hard to say what they're really worth, but probably about 30% less.\nAs I said in my first take of the buds, some of you might be a little disappointed that Samsung gave in and followed Apple's earbuds approach after determining the stem design worked best for most people. For what it's worth, I did like the fit of these better than that of the Galaxy Buds 2 and Buds 2 Pro, as well as the more recent Galaxy Buds FE. And they will fit a wider range of ears.\nFor those of you debating whether to get these or the Galaxy Buds 3, at the right price, I have no problem recommending the Buds 3 to Samsung Galaxy owners and other Android users who don't like having ear tips jammed in their ears. But the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro are more special and compete well against other premium noise-canceling buds in their price range, particularly when it comes to sound quality and voice-calling performance.\nIf you're contemplating upgrading from the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro, the Buds 3 Pro are better. However, there's not a massive difference from a performance standpoint, so I think it really comes down to what kind of deal you can get on the Buds 3 Pro. Some of the trade-in deals are pretty tempting, but I'm sure some of you may still prefer the Buds 2 Pro's stemless design, so that makes it a harder choice."

      "text": "The best Android phones have years of software and security updates, great cameras, a powerful processor and a battery life that lasts a day or more. Samsung's new Galaxy Z Fold 7 makes the cut, as does Google's Pixel 9 and the 9 Pro XL. We've tested dozens of Android phones and have found the best smartphones you can buy. You should have no trouble getting one that suits your needs. Whilethere's a general uncertainty around the economy that has caused people to consider upgrading their phone, companies like Samsung and Google have not raised the prices on their current offerings, specifically because of tariffs.\nOur Picks\nMOBILE DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $449 (save $50)\n- $550 (save $50)\n- $300 (save $100)\nWhat's the best Android phone?\nThe $800 Samsung Galaxy S25's battery life is amazing. That's not the only reason it's our pick for best Android phone. It gets seven years of major Android updates, and the cameras are good (there's even a 3x telephoto lens for zooming). Then there are all the AI features: Most are just OK, but Circle to Search is outstanding. Samsung tries to set the Galaxy S25 apart by leaning into what's new (AI), as well as embracing the familiar (good cameras and battery life). And we're definitely impressed. There are plenty of other excellent choices, with the Pixel 8A being another current favorite.\nBest Android phones of 2025\nPros\n- Camera consistently delivers good images\n- Impressive battery life that last a day or more\n- More AI features that actually feel practical\nCons\n- Several gimmicky AI tools\n- Not many changes over the S24\nThe Galaxy S25's biggest flex that I noticed while testing is it shares many of the same attributes as its pricier counterparts, the S25 Plus and S25 Ultra \u2013 but it does so for several hundred dollars less. You'll find features like the AI Select tool, Audio Eraser and deeper Gemini integration across all of Samsung's S25 devices, as well as a custom Snapdragon 8 Elite processor and 12GB RAM \u2013 making the smaller phone of the bunch still seem pretty mighty.\nAnd while the Galaxy S25 might look incredibly similar to the S24 and share many of the same specs, consistency isn't so bad when it means there's a consistently good camera and great battery life. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 review.\nWhy we like it\nHaving a baseline phone, like the Galaxy S25, that delivers many of the same perks as more expensive models, is a huge plus in my book. And given the remarkable processing power, standout camera and seamless AI integration in the Galaxy S25 lineup, it's great that I can get all those premium features for $800.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're someone who insists on buying a flagship device, the Galaxy S25 won't let you down. but if you have a device that's two years old or more, you might be enticed to tap into all the latest Galaxy AI and integrated Gemini features. Now, $800 isn't pocket change, and there are definitely other options for those who want to be more budget conscious, but if you're willing to spend a bit more, the baseline S25 can be a great all-around choice.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nYou probably don't need to upgrade if you're using last year's S24.\nPros\n- The screen is delightfully bright\n- Cameras are good for $499\n- Gemini Live Video AI has potential to be useful\n- Solid build\n- The under-$500 price\nCons\n- Battery life is just OK, will get through a day\n- Processor is serviceable (curious about longevity)\n- Lacks emergency SOS satellite texting\nFor $499, Google's Pixel 9A truly feels like you're getting more bang for your buck. It comes with several significant upgrades from last year's Pixel 8A: a fresh design, new display, larger battery, slightly more powerful chip, increased durability and upgraded software features.\nBut don't get me wrong -- it's not a perfect phone. There are places where Google had to compromise to keep the price under $500, like the lack of satellite connectivity for emergencies available on the $799 Pixel 9. Overall, though, I think the compromises Google made were smart and that the Pixel 9A is worth every penny. Read our Google Pixel 9A review.\nWhy we like it\nThe Pixel 9A is proof that you don't need to spend more than $500 to get a great phone. It can handle all you daily tasks from scrolling social media and news feeds and swiping through TikTok videos to taking a beautiful photo and lasting a day on a single charge.\nWho's it best for?\nIn theory: anybody. The Pixel 9A is for anyone who wants 95% of what a $1,000 phone can do at half the price.\nWho shouldn't get it\nAnyone who wants the absolute fastest processor or the most cutting edge cameras.\nPros\n- Beautiful design that feels durable\n- Fun and somewhat useful AI features\n- New ultrawide camera takes good photos\n- 7 years of software updates for longevity\nCons\n- More expensive that previous Pixels and competitors\n- Doesn't feel that different from Pixel 8\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about the Pixel 9, from its respectable camera to its classy new design and lengthy 7-year timeline for software updates. But Google\u2019s phones have always shined for their clean, slick software, and that once again applies to the Pixel 9 series. Pixels are also among the first to get new software updates, making them an ideal choice for those who want to get their hands on the latest version of Android first. Aside from Android updates, Google also brings new features to Pixel phones throughout the year through updates it calls Feature Drops.\nThe Pixel 9 comes with a few new AI tricks that you may find useful, like the ability to search for content in screenshots, generate images from scratch in the Pixel Studio app and add new objects in photos. These features aren\u2019t must-haves, and they\u2019re not without flaws. Plus, at a starting price of $799, the Pixel 9 has a higher bar to live up to. But the Pixel 9 feels like it belongs in that class of device. Read our full review for the Google Pixel 9.\nWhy we like it\nThe Pixel 9 and Google's Gemini assistant still feel like a first step toward what the company is hoping to achieve: Making phone software more intelligent so that we can spend less time swiping, tapping, scrolling and digging. In the meantime, the Pixel 9 shines for its great camera, elegant design and clean software, just like the less AI-centric Pixels of years past.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're a Pixel fan upgrading from an older phone, like the Pixel 6 or earlier, you'll find a lot to love about the Pixel 9. But keep in mind that for the same price, Samsung's Galaxy S25 has a brighter screen and a dedicated telephoto lens for taking zoomed photos.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you want the absolute best cameras that Google makes, including having a dedicated telephoto lens, I'd recommend the Pixel 9 Pro.\nPros\n- Best screen on any phone\n- Versatile cameras\n- Most powerful phone I've tested\n- Good battery life\nCons\n- $1,300 price\n- Design is almost too minimal\n- AI features are hit-or-miss\n- S25/S25 Plus have similar features and cost less\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra which has a lot of AI features, the best of which are interesting and the worst of which unreliable. Luckily, Samsung gets a lot of other things right on the S25 Ultra, which has a new Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, high-resolution ultrawide camera, and some sweet pro video tools that rival the iPhone 16 Pro. Samsung wisely kept all the best parts of last year's Galaxy S24 Ultra (basically the entire phone including that antireflective display) but some of its worst parts, too, like the $1,300 price tag.\nIf you want the best screen you can find on any phone, get the S25 Ultra. If you want the most versatile phone cameras, get the S25 Ultra. If you want a stylus, get the S25 Ultra. But if your needs scale back on any of those fronts, the more affordable S25 options, or even last year's S24 Ultra, may be worth considering. Read our full Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review.\nWhy we like it\nThe reason to get the Ultra over its S25 siblings is its screen, which is truly the best I've seen on any phone, and the cameras, which are a step above what the S25 and S25 Plus have. Added video features like ability to record in Log format gets the Ultra as close as it's ever been to the iPhone in terms of professional video capture.\nWho it's best for\nIf you have a Galaxy S22 Ultra or older, the S25 Ultra will seem like a significant upgrade. It's harder to make that case for S23 Ultra owners, who, unless their phone's battery is ailing or they can score an incredible discount, should otherwise sit this one out. And for you S24 Ultra owners, you don't need this phone. Save your money and treat yourself to a nice steak dinner and a movie.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra's appeal is muddied by its $1,300 price. The regular Galaxy S25 has the same functionality, power and longevity, and it costs $500 less. Want a bigger screen? Consider the Galaxy S25 Plus. For the majority of people, the regular Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus will be a better fit.\nPros\n- Thin 4.2mm design\n- 200-megapixel main camera\n- Powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite processor\n- Durable build\nCons\n- Steep $2,000 price tag\n- Same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's Fold\n- 25-watt wired charging\nWith the Galaxy Z Fold 7, Samsung has finally addressed some of the key issues with its previous book-style foldables. The impressively thin build and wider, 6.5-inch cover screen makes this feel like a standard phone when closed, and that wider 8-inch inside display is great for multitasking, with the ability to run up to three apps simultaneously. Perhaps most notably, the camera gets a major upgrade with the addition of a 200-megapixel main camera, which takes shots on par with the top-of-the-line S25 Ultra.\nAltogether, it\u2019s a great choice if you want a bigger, tablet-like display without the bulk or a compromise on camera quality.\nWhy we like it\nThe Z Fold 7 does a solid job combining what's great about standard slate phones and what's great about foldables. It feels wonderfully normal to hold when closed, thanks to its sleek design and lightweight build. It also packs great cameras and has an expansive main display that's 11 percent bigger than last year's Z Fold 6.\nThankfully, a slimmer build doesn't force the battery to take a hit; the Z Fold 7 maintains that same 4,400-mAh battery as last year's foldable. That pales in comparison to batteries from Chinese competitors, but at least it's not a downgrade. The Z Fold 7 also packs a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor to power the many AI features you'll get onboard, from Galaxy AI photo and audio editing tools to Google's Gemini Live and Circle to Search. The phone also supports seven years of software and security updates.\nWho it's best for\nIf you're bored of standard slate phones and want something that feels a little more exciting, the Galaxy Z Fold 7 is a great choice. The slim design and wider cover screen helps it to feel as normal as possible when closed, with the added perk of an expansive main display that's great for multitasking and watching videos. The cameras are also impressive for a foldable that's so thin.\nWho shouldn't get it\nThe Z Fold 7's $2,000 price tag is perhaps its biggest caveat. Also, if you don't need a bigger display, it may not be worth the splurge. Ironically, the cover screen is so practical that you\u2019ll rarely need to open the phone -- unless you\u2019re watching movies or multitasking, in which case a phone like the Galaxy S25 Ultra might be a better fit.\nPros\n- Lightning fast charging\n- Nice big screen\n- 7 years of OS and security upgrades\n- Great performance with games, movies and animations\nCons\n- Battery life is a day, similar to baseline S25\n- Similar specs as the S25 at a higher price\n- Rival phones at the same price have better cameras\nIf the baseline Galaxy S25 appeals to you but you'd rather have a bigger screen and higher battery capacity \u2013 without upgrading all the way to the Ultra \u2013 the S25 Plus may be the phone for you. The entire S25 lineup shares many features, from AI capabilities to processing power to memory, so the Plus may be a viable choice if you're looking for something right in the middle.\nThat said, the Plus' minimal upgrades over the baseline S25 may not justify the $200 price difference. But if a bigger phone just feels better to hold and you'd rather have a 4,900 mAh battery (over the S25's 4,000mAh one), then that $1,000 starting price might ultimately be worth every penny. Read CNET's full Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus review.\nWhy we like it\nWhile the baseline S25 checks all the key boxes, the S25 Plus can simply feel like a more comfortable device to use, especially if you're a fellow member of the bigger hands club. In addition to sharing many of the same features as the pricier S25 Ultra, the S25 Plus has a higher battery capacity than the baseline model -- though in CNET's tests, there weren't any major discrepancies in how the two batteries actually performed. Still, sometimes you just want to live a little larger, and this phone can be the perfect fit.\nWho it's best for\nIf you like having a larger screen to watch movies or play games on, the S25 Plus can be a great choice. While the S25 Ultra might be a top pick for someone who wants both a bigger phone and the most premium features, the S25 Plus can be that goldilocks device that meets you right in the middle -- without you having to spend $1,300 on the Ultra.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nIf you want the absolute best in terms of cameras, don't get the S25 Plus. For $1,000 phones like the Pixel 9 Pro or iPhone 16 Pro have better cameras. Or if you can afford to buy a $1,300 phone, check out the Galaxy S25 Ultra which has an amazing set of lenses\nPros\n- Genuinely fun new AI skills\n- Sleek new design\n- Seven years of software updates\n- Cameras can take great daytime shots\nCons\n- Camera hardware hasn't improved much over Pixel 8 Pro\n- Gemini AI will eventually require a paid subscription\nThe Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL have a lot going for them, from their shiny new designs and long software support period. But it's the AI skills that really stand out, from the deep integration of the conversational Gemini Live, to the new Pixel Studio that creates weird and wonderful images from your text prompts.\nThe phones aren't perfect. While the cameras are good and can take excellent photos in bright light, they're just okay in low-light and in night mode. The best AI features will require a monthly subscription (though you get the first year for free) But if you're keen to experiment with AI on your phone then the new Pixel 9 Pro range is a superb way to experience it. Read our Google Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL review.\nWhy we like it\nGoogle's Pixel line of phones has gone from strength to strength and its latest model is unquestionably the best phone the company has ever made. It's not just the slick-looking design; the Pixel 9 Pro offers a superb camera system, a generous support period and a host of new AI skills making it one of the most accomplished Android phones around. The 9 Pro XL takes that further by accommodating a bright and vibrant 6.8-inch display.\nWho it's best for\nIt's a great phone for those of you looking for an elegant everyday Android phone. The interface is easy to navigate and the camera takes great photos with almost no effort on your part. If you feel overwhelmed by the plethora of settings and menus on other Android flagships, Google's Pixel 9 Pro is the way to go. If playing mobile games or watching videos on the go is a priority, opt for the larger Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you don't need the best cameras Google makes, consider the regular Pixel 9. I do like the fit and finish better on the 9 Pro, but it starts at $999.\nPros\n- Robust design\n- Bright high resolution inner screen\n- Battery life should last you a day or more\n- It's so damn fun to use\nCons\n- Cameras take decent photos but suffer from motion blur\n- Only three years of major OS updates\n- Gets warm playing games and using the camera frequently\nThe Motorola Razr Ultra is a beefed-up version of last year's Razr Plus, which won a CNET Editor's Choice Award. It's as if the Razr Plus hired a trainer and nutritionist and then got absolutely ripped -- warranting its name: Ultra. After testing, I've come to adore the Razr Ultra. It does all the \"normal\" non-folding phone things I want, and offers me a truly unique experience thanks to its cover screen. I feel like the coolest kid in the coffee shop when Google Pay-ing for my cortado with my Razr Ultra closed. Read our Motorola Razr Ultra review.\nBut in taking nearly every aspect of the phone to the extreme, Motorola lost one of the most important parts of recent Razrs: the amazing value. The catch for all this ultra-ness: the Motorola Razr Ultra costs $1,300.\nWhy we like it\nThis is the best built foldable flip phone I've ever used. Motorola took the best parts of the Razr Plus and improved nearly everything else. The battery life is outstanding and easily lasts a day on a single charge and can get you mostly through a second day even. The displays are brighter. The main 7-inch foldable display is larger and has more resolution than the Razr Plus and the cameras are improved. The fabric backing is delightful.\nWho's it best for\nSomeone who wants a fun, unique an robust foldable phone. You're willing to pay top-dollar to get the best processor, battery, design and cameras Motorola has ever made.\nWho shouldn't get it\nIf you're unsure of foldables, this might not be the best fit. If you find yourself in places with sand, dirt and other fine particles, the Razr Ultra (like all foldable phones) isn't worth the risk. The Razr Ultra has the same class-leading IP-rating for dust and water resistance, but the dust resistance is only for particles 1-mm or larger.\nPros\n- The 6.9-inch screen is immersive, with lovely colors and contrast\n- The 4.1-inch screen looks incredible\n- It's durable and survived a drop onto concrete\n- One UI 8 (Android 16) runs wonderfully\n- $1,100 is still a lot, but Samsung gives the phone more value than the Flip 6\nCons\n- Gets warm when recording videos and playing games\n- Battery life is the same as the Flip 6 despite a bigger battery\n- Cover screen software has room to grow\nWhen I first got my hands on Samsung's new Galaxy Z Flip 7, I was delighted to discover that it has a smaller crease, larger cover screen, thinner design and bigger battery compared to last year's Galaxy Z Flip 6. But as I tested the new clamshell phone, I became enthralled by its inner screen. At 6.9 inches, this is the biggest screen on any Samsung phone aside from the Galaxy Z Fold 7, which has an 8-inch foldable display.\nThe Z Flip 7's large screen size makes content feel more immersive and colors look lovely and vivid. This led to epic TikTok and Instagram sessions, watching widescreen films such as A Working Man and Back to the Future, as well as jumping back and forth between two apps stacked vertically on the screen thanks to One UI 8's 90:10 split tool.\nEvery time I open the Flip 7, I'm consistently dumbfounded by how such a large display can unfurl from something about the size of a makeup compact. And when it's closed, there's a 4.1-inch cover screen that's fantastic in its own ways, with new clever animations for when you're recording a video, charging the phone or taking a selfie, all efficiently using the extra display real estate. In terms of functionality, though, the cover screen's software is about the same as the 3.4-inch one on the Flip 6.\nThe Flip 7 impressed me in nearly every way but one: its battery life. It has a larger battery than the Flip 6, but it doesn't last any longer in daily use. It did consistently get me through a day on a single charge, often having 15 to 20% left, but there were also a few days where it needed an early evening top-off.\nWhy we like it\nThe Galaxy Z Flip 7 is the most fully realized version of Samsung's ideal of a flip phone since the launch of the original Galaxy Z Flip in 2020. The Flip 7's appeal is simple: It's a thin phone with a big, bold screen that folds in half into a coaster-sized square. The larger cover screen and inner screen make content more immersive. It's design is thin (for a clamshell foldable) and comfortable to hold. Plus you get twice the storage this year compared to last.\nWho is it best for\nIf you've been tempted by a clamshell-style foldable, you should definitely consider the Flip 7. If you have a Galaxy Z Flip 4 or older, the Flip 7 will be an upgrade in every way. It's harder to make that same recommendation for Flip 5 owners unless your phone is showing its age. And if you have a Galaxy Z Flip 6, you can sit this one out unless you really want those larger screens.\nWho shouldn\u2019t get it\nIf you spend a ton of time around dirt or sand, this phone isn't for you.\nBest Android phones compared\n| Product | Samsung Galaxy S25 | Samsung Galaxy S25 Plus | Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra | Google Pixel 9 | Google Pixel 9 Pro | Google Pixel 9 Pro XL | Moto G Power 5G (2024) | Motorola Razr Plus (2024) | Samsung Galaxy Flip 6 | Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.2-inch AMOLED;

The Fold 7 replaces last year's Fold 6 and comes with a completely new design that makes it thinner, lighter and feel more like a \"regular phone.\" The Flip 7 is the best-built foldable flip phone we tested from Samsung. The thinner design and bigger displays are the headline features.\nFactors to consider when buying an Android phone\nLook at last year's phones: Companies typically keep previous models around at a discounted price. For example, while you can buy the $699 Pixel 8 or $999 Pixel 8 Pro for less than the current Pixel 9 equivalents.\nGet more for less with cheap phones: For a fraction of the cost, you can get a solid phone that does almost everything a pricier flagship phone can do. The Google Pixel 8A packs a good camera and is frequently discounted to under $400.\nCheck your Android type: Some phones, like Google's Pixel series, run a stock version of Android. Others, like Samsung's Galaxy phones, have their own software (OneUI) on top of Android. Each type has its own appeal and drawbacks. If you've been rocking a Samsung phone for years, you'll likely still be more at home on a new Galaxy phone.\nBe ready for Cyber Monday sales: The holidays usually bring big discounts and sales, even on phones.\nTest your phone: It's definitely worth going to a store and trying out a phone before you shell out hundreds of dollars for it.\nFind peace of mind with a case: You spent all this time choosing a phone, now protect it from damage with a case.\nHow we test phones\nWe test every phone in real-world scenarios focusing on its features, design, performance, cameras, battery life and overall value. We document our findings in an initial review that is periodically updated when there are new software updates or to compare against new phones from phones from competitors like Apple, Samsung, Google and OnePlus.\nPhotography\nPhotography is a major focus for most phones these days, so we take pictures and videos of various subjects in a variety of settings and lighting scenarios. We try out any new camera modes such as the 4K 120fps slow motion mode that debuted on the iPhone 16 Pro or the Add Me photo tool that launched with the Google Pixel 9 series.\nBattery life\nBattery testing is conducted in a variety of ways. We assess how long a phone lasts during a typical day of use, and note how it performs during more focused sessions of video calls, media streaming and gaming. We also conduct a video playback test, which isn't always included in the initial review and is added later in an update.\nPerformance\nWe use benchmarking apps to measure the performance, alongside our own anecdotal experiences using the phone for our review. Of particular note are how graphics and animations look. Are they smooth? Or do they lag or stutter? We also look at how quickly the phone switches between horizontal and vertical orientations and how fast the camera app opens and is ready to take a photo.\nWe perform processor-heavy tasks like editing photos, exporting videos and playing games. We evaluate whether a newer version of a particular phone includes enough features to make it worth upgrading from older models.\nRead more: How We Test Phones\nOther phones we tested\nSamsung's $650 Galaxy S24 FE is such a comfort to use that at moments our reviewer, Mike Sorrentino, felt like he was testing a scaled-back version of the $1,000 Galaxy S24 Plus. The S24 FE's large 6.7-inch 120Hz refresh-rate display made it easy for me to enjoy streaming shows, playing games and taking video calls throughout the day. And it includes nearly every software perk from the more expensive Galaxy S24 line. Read our full review of the Samsung Galaxy S24 FE.\nThe OnePlus 13 is the first true flagship phone of 2025 and there's plenty to like. From its powerful performance to its fast charging and vibrant display, it has much of what we expect from a top-end phone right now. It looks good too, has great waterproofing, a scattering of new AI skills and a reasonable six years of security support. But while accomplished in some respects, the OnePlus 13 feels more like a \"pretty good\" 2024 phone, rather than kicking off a new year of tech with any kind of fanfare. Read our OnePlus 13 review.\nAndroid phone FAQ\nWhich Android phone has the best camera?\nWhat are the best brands for Android phones?\nHow reliable is an Android phone?\nHow long does an Android phone last?\nWhat to look forward to in 2025\nSamsung teased the Galaxy S25 Edge at its January Galaxy Unpacked event.
