      "summary": "Apple is expected to raise prices on its iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max models despite being exempt from Trump tariffs. TrendForce and analysts project a $50–$100 price bump for the Pro series, with the Pro Max potentially seeing a $100 increase. The price hike is driven by higher component costs and a shift to more premium features, while the base iPhone 17 is likely to stay flat. The launch is slated for September 9, with the event expected to reveal the new lineup and pricing.",
