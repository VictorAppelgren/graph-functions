  "title": "\u2018Move Out, Immediately:' Trump's vision for ridding DC streets of homeless",
  "description": "The president has vowed to use \"involuntary commitment\" to detain people sleeping on the streets of DC.",
  "content": "As President Donald Trump prepares to send 800 National Guard troops to the nation\u2019s capital to crack down on crime and homelessness, social workers and local officials are worried the president's proposal will only worsen the problem.\n\nTrump plans to seize control of Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department, sweep homeless people off the city\u2019s streets, and end \u201ccrime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\u201d he said at an Aug. 11 press conference.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be removing homeless encampments from beautiful parks, which now, a lot of people can\u2019t walk on,\u201d Trump told reporters, adding that his administration is getting \u201crid of the people from underpasses and public spaces from all over the city.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s unclear exactly how the president\u2019s order for people sleeping outdoors to \"move out, immediately\" would actually work. In the Aug. 11 order, the president offered few specific details on the logistics of the effort. He told reporters there were \u201cmany places\u201d people could go and his administration planned to \u201chelp them as much as you can help.\u201d\n\nAccording to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, there were about 5,600 homeless people in Washington, DC down from about 8,300 in 2016. Of those homeless people counted in January 2025, about 1,000 were sleeping on the streets any given night. The majority of the rest were either staying with friends, in hotels or in one of the city's shelters.\n\nThere are about 3,200 emergency shelter beds in the city, and about another 1,000 beds in shelters for people transitioning into more permanent housing, according to the DC-based Community Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness.\n\nDonald Whitehead, executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless said all of those shelters are currently at capacity, creating more uncertainty over where Trump would move people on the streets. Whitehead questioned whether the president would consider jailing the homeless, sending them to an unknown location or moving them outside of the city.\n\nIn an Aug. 10 social media post, Trump suggested he would move people sleeping outside \u201cFAR from the Capital.\u201d\n\nBut Washington Legal Clinic for the Homeless, a nonprofit providing legal aid to people experiencing homelessness, argued the president does not have the power to move people outside the city's borders.\n\n\"No one can be banished from a jurisdiction. We will not stand by if the federal government attempts to abuse its power against our community in this way,\" the group said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nThe president has also promised in recent weeks to use more \"involuntary commitment\" to detain people sleeping in public \u2012 the process in which mental health workers can forcibly detain and medicate people against their will. His order comes after a landmark 2024 Supreme Court ruling said cities could punish people for sleeping and camping on public property.\n\nDC Attorney General Brian Schwalb warned area hospitals to expect more patients as a result of the involuntary commitment,Washingtonian magazine reported.\n\n\"There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia,\" Schwalb said in an Aug. 11 social media post. \"Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year, and is down another 26% so far this year. We are considering all of our options and will do what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents.\"\n\nAdvocates for homeless communities have said Trump's plan is dehumanizing and more expensive than other methods of decreasing homelessness, namely providing permanent housing with support services. Low wages and the high cost of housing and are major causes of homelessness in DC.\n\nInsha Rahman, vice president of advocacy at the Vera Institue of Justice, a nonprofit organization focused on criminal justice, said homelessness is an economic and public health issue, rather than a criminal one.\n\n\"Tent encampment sweeps and threats of criminalization will not solve the problem,\" she said. \"Proven interventions like sustained outreach to connect people to service and supportive housing, interim housing or permanent housing, as well as other stabilizing benefits like cash assistance, will.\"\n\nResearchers at the University of Southern California attributed a drop in homelessness in Los Angeles to increased outreach efforts over the last few years, for example. The unsheltered population dropped by 14% in LA County in the past two years, as programs moving people into temporary housing expanded.\n\nJesse Rabinowitz, communications director for the National Homelessness Law Center, pointed to statistics that show homeless people are more likely to be the victims of crime, rather than the perpetrators.\n\nA 2022 report published by the National Coalition for Homelessness found nearly 2,000 incidents of violence against homeless people since the start of the century. It suggested there was a link between policies prohibiting homelessness and a rise in violence against those without shelter.\n\n\u201cWe know that housing plus support solves homelessness, there just isn\u2019t enough housing to go around,\u201d Rabinowitz said. \u201cThe truth is we\u2019ve tried institutionalization as a country \u2026 It never works.\u201d",

      "text": "President, mayor, police chief, social worker. Trump is a man of many hats\nAlongside his Washington, D.C. takeover of local law enforcement, President Trump also vows to clear away the homeless and pave the potholes.\nDonald Trump's expansive view of his powers is no longer limited to those traditionally exercised by a president.\nWith his decision to take control of Washington's Metropolitan Police Department and deploy national guardsmen and FBI agents on the city's streets \u2212 citing a spree of lawlessness that isn't supported by federal crime data \u2212 the president took charge of tasks typically in the domain of the mayor and the police chief.\nThere was more. He also vowed to clear out the homeless from encampments (though short on details about where they would go, exactly) as well as pave the streets and fill the potholes. He is a hands-on leader, he boasted, even when it comes to White House decor and his plans to build a huge ballroom and install new marble floors.\n\"I'm announcing a historic action to rescue our nation's capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse,\" he said at the beginning of a freewheeling news conference that stretched for more than an hour. \"This is Liberation Day in DC, and we're going to take our capital back.\"\nWhy now?\nThat wasn't entirely clear, especially at a time when crime in Washington is on a significant slide.\nIn January, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced that violent crime in Washington in 2024 was at a 30-year low, down 35% from 2023. So far this year, DC's police department said that as of Aug. 10, violent crime has dropped another 26%.\nExcept for a spike during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2022 and 2023, violent crime in the District of Columbia has been steadily declining since 2012.\nTrump was clearly unconvinced, depicting a dystopian landscape outside the White House gates. \"Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people,\" he said.\nHe mentioned, in particular, the beating of a former staffer from the Department of Governmental Efficiency during an attempted carjacking. He suggested the reporters in the room, many of whom live in Washington, should be grateful that he was moving to protect them.\nCan Trump do that? Yes. Should he?\nTrump declared a public safety emergency in Washington \u2212 seizing control of the police department and sending 800 national guardsmen on the streets and another 120 FBI agents on night patrols. While critics argued that it wasn't necessary or wise to take these steps, they generally didn't argue that he lacked the power to do them.\n\"He's doing this because he can,\" city councilman Charles Allen said.\nTo be clear, standing on the side of law and order doesn't usually require a profile in courage. It has been a Republican trope since Richard Nixon and before. In recent years, it has been stoked by demands by Democrats and others for social justice reforms in the wake of notorious cases of police brutality.\nTrump depicted crime as a failure of Democratic leaders and a consequence of their policies. He warned other Democratic enclaves \u2212 New York, Chicago, Los Angeles \u2212 that he just might consider taking similar steps to impose order on their streets.\nWhat particularly irked his fiercest critics was the contrast with Trump's action, or his lack of it, during what was undeniably a law-enforcement crisis in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021. Thousands of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, disrupting the ceremonial count of Electoral College ballots and sending senators and representatives scrambling for safety.\nThen, Trump didn't deploy the National Guard. Afterward, more than 1,575 people were charged with crimes. At least 600 were charged with the felony of assaulting or impeding law enforcement. Trump himself was also indicted on criminal charges for trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election that he lost \u2013 a prosecution he managed to avoid facing trial on by winning the presidency again.\nOn the first day of his second term, Trump granted a blanket clemency to the Jan. 6 defendants.\nDurbin: 'Political theater' to draw attention from Jeffrey Epstein\nThis time, Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin called Trump's actions \"political theater\" and \"a typical move by this president to create chaos and uncertainty, and to draw the attention from other issues like Jeffrey Epstein.\" Trump was \"trying to change the subject,\" said Durbin, one of the top Democrats who oversees the Department of Justice.\nTrump did answer questions from reporters about the traditional business of the presidency. He discussed his vision of a \"land swap\" he might negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their scheduled meeting on Aug. 15 in Alaska to end the war in Ukraine. He said he would soon decide whether to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug, and he teased the ongoing trade negotiations with China.\nThen, yes, there was Epstein, the deceased financier and convicted child sex offender whose case had broken back into the headlines just before Trump walked out into the White House briefing room. A federal judge denied the Trump administration's request to release testimony in the grand jury that indicted Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's former partner, who is serving her own 20-year prison sentence on sex trafficking charges.\nThe request was part of the administration's effort to tamp down a swirling controversy among Trump's MAGA base about whether there was a conspiracy to protect powerful people from disclosure.\nAs he left the briefing room, the president ignored shouted questions about the case \u2212 though like the new crackdown on crime, that topic isn't likely to go away anytime soon."

      "text": "Pentagon pulls 2,000 National Guard members from Los Angeles in immigration rollback\nWASHINGTON \u2015 The Trump administration is pulling half of the California National Guard members it deployed to Los Angeles in a major rollback of President Donald Trump's militarized response to protests in Southern California over immigration arrests and raids.\n\u201cThanks to our troops who stepped up to answer the call, the lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding,\" Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a July 15 statement. \"As such, the Secretary has ordered the release of 2,000 California National Guardsmen (79th IBCT) from the federal protection mission.\"\nTrump deployed 4,000 California National Guardsmen on June 7 to respond to protests that racked the southern part of the state after he stepped up immigration raids and arrests, targeting farms, restaurants, and hardware stores across the Los Angeles area. He also ordered 700 Marines to the city that were tasked with guarding federal property.\nThe deployment was decried by the state's Democratic lawmakers, who have called an overreach of presidential authority and accused Trump of inciting violence. Trump has claimed that the \"Los Angeles would be burning right now\" if not for the military presence.\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who sued the Trump administration over the guard's deployment, called for Trump to release the remaining National Guard members from Los Angeles now that half have been pulled.\n\u201cWhile nearly 2,000 of them are starting to demobilize, the remaining guards members continue without a mission, without direction and without any hopes of returning to help their communities,\u201d Newsom said in a statement Tuesday. We call on Trump and the Department of Defense to end this theater and send everyone home now.\u201d\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass claimed victory after Trump's withdrawal of guardsmen.\n\u201cThis happened because the people of Los Angeles stood united and stood strong,\" Bass said in a statement. \"We organized peaceful protests, we came together at rallies, we took the Trump administration to court \u2012 all of this led to today\u2019s retreat.\"\nBass added: \"We will not stop making our voices heard until this ends, not just here in LA, but throughout our country.\u201d\nOne National Guard brigade is being withdrawn from Los Angeles, according to a Defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly. About one brigade, with several thousand soldiers, remains.\nAn appeals court ruled in June that Trump could keep control over the National Guard troops.\nTrump, upon his return Tuesday night to the White House after traveling to Pittsburgh, did not respond to a shouted question from a reporter about his decision to pull the guardsmen from Los Angeles."

Trump cited the law in an executive order declaring he was using emergency powers to seize control of the city\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department.\n\u201cThe Home Rule charter requires the mayor to provide the services of MPD during special conditions of an emergency, and we will follow the law,\u201d Bowser.\n-Zac Anderson\nDOJ earlier said DC violent crime was at a 30-year low\nDespite claims of rising crime and violence in Washington by President Trump and his attorney general and FBI chief, the Justice Department itself announced in January that total violent crime for 2024 was down 35% from the year before.\nIn fact, crime in the capital \u201cis the lowest it has been in over 30 years,\u201d according to data collected by the Metropolitan Police Department included in a Jan. 3 statement by the Washington, D.C., U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.\nThen-U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, credited the declines to a \"focus on the drivers of violence \u2212 those gangs or crews of people who are dealing drugs, protecting turf, committing carjackings and other robberies, all while armed.\u201d\nDuring an August 11 press conference, DC was described as one of the most unsafe and violent cities in the world by Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Graves\u2019 recently confirmed replacement, former television personality Jeanine Pirro.\nBut the Justice Department in January said that in addition to the overall violent crime reduction, homicides were down 32%; robberies were down 39%; armed carjackings were down 53% and assaults with a dangerous weapon were down 27% when compared with 2023 levels. DOJ also said the District was reporting \u201cthe fewest assaults with dangerous weapons and burglaries in over 30 years.\u201d\nIn 2024, Washington, DC,had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit.\n\u2212Josh Meyer\nTrump says on police response to protesters: \u2018You spit and we hit\u2019\nPresident Trump issued a stern warning to protesters in Washington, DC, and beyond during his Aug. 11 press briefing where he announced plans to federalize the city's police force and deploy National Guard troops: \u201cYou spit and we hit.\u201d\nIn making the remark, Trump said that he was aware of a recent incident in Navy Yard, a neighborhood located in southeast DC. Police arrested a minor on Aug. 9 who discharged a firearm at a group of teens, according to ABC 7 News.\nNavy Yard has seen other incidents of violence in the past, including fights breaking out among teens and a 25-year-old arrested and charged with assault on a police officer.\n\u201cThey're not going to be fighting back long,\u201d Trump said,\nApparently recalling previous street protests were officers showed restraint against demonstrators, Trump called on officers to use force.\n\u201cThey love to spit in the face of the police as the police are standing up there in uniform, they're standing and they're screaming at them an inch away from their face, and then they start spitting in their face.

Mayor Muriel Bowser as a criticism of crime and alleged corruption.\nLee cited an ongoing scandal, for example, involving a D.C. police commander who in July was suspended for allegedly changing crime stats in his district. He also noted how in some news reports local residents said they were afraid to speak out about crime for fear of reprisal.\n\u2212Phillip M. Bailey, Deborah Berry\nWhite House says DC\u2019s murder rate leads other national capitals\nAhead of Trump\u2019s press conference, White House officials handed a chart to reporters in the press briefing room detailing how Washington D.C.\u2019s homicide rate is greater than those of several foreign capitals.\nWith about 27 murders per every 100,000 residents, Washington, D.C., has a higher homicide rate than Bogota, Colombia; Mexico City; Islamabad, Pakistan; Lima, Peru; and Ottawa, Canada, among others, according to the chart.\nEven so, violent crime in Washington D.C. is down 26% in 2025 compared to this time last year. In 2024, Washington, D.C., had the fourth-highest homicide rate among U.S. cities, after St. Louis, New Orleans and Detroit, at 27.3 per 100,000 residents, a decline of 30.7% from 2023.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump's expected troop deployment recalls 2020 protest crackdown\nPresident Trump's expected announcement that he will send the military onto the streets of the nation's capital recalls his deployment of National Guard troops during his first term to suppress protests sparked by the police murder of George Floyd.\nTrump has threatened a massive crackdown on crime in Washington.\nNational Guard troops mobilized by the president in a \"federalized\" capacity are typically barred from carrying out the functions of law enforcement, but not if they're under state control. In the summer of 2020, Trump brought troops into Washington from other states under the permission of 11 governors \u2212 an unprecedented mobilization of state troops.\nTrump's authority to direct National Guard troops was challenged earlier this year after he tapped the California National Guard to quell protests over widespread deportations in the Los Angeles area. After Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Trump's control over the troops, a judge ruled in favor of Trump.\n\u2212Cybele Mayes-Osterman\nDemocrats ask: What about Jan. 6?\nAhead of Trump's press conference, Democrats criticized Trump for failing to call in the National Guard during the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol, while preparing to call in the military now to suppress street crime.\nMore than 1,575 people were charged in connection with the Jan. 6 insurrection. At least 600 were charged with the felony of assaulting or impeding law enforcement, according to the Police Executive Research Forum.\n\u201cRemember January 6, 2021: Why did Trump fail to call out to DC National Guard? Don\u2019t believe Trump\u2019s lies,\u201d Donna Brazile, former acting chair of the Democratic National Committee, wrote on X.\nWashington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024.

And I just think that\u2019s not the most efficient use of our guard,\u201d Bowser said. \u201cBut that\u2019s the president\u2019s call about how to deploy the guard.\u201d\nBowser, who is in her third mayoral term, has refrained from responding with hostility to Trump\u2019s threats about taking over Washington.\n\u2212Joey Garrison\n450 federal officers deployed on DC streets\nTrump's announcement comes as 450 officers from multiple federal agencies were deployed in high-traffic D.C. areas and other hotspots over the weekend on Aug. 9 and 10.\nThe officers are from 18 agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Drug Enforcement Administration, and the Secret Service.\nTrump ordered an increased law enforcement presence in D.C. on Aug. 8 after complaining about crime in the city, even as violent crime trended down.\nViolent crime is down 26% in DC in 2025\nThe White House pointed to several examples of violent crime in Washington this year including the May 21 fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a downtown museum (The suspect is from Chicago.) as well as the recent assault on Coristine.\nYet Washington's crime rate is down this year compared to 2024. Violent crimes are 26% lower than last year. Homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department. Violent crime declined by 35% in Washington from 2023 ro 2024, including homicides from 274 to 187.\n-Joey Garrison\nTrump threatens to take over DC\nTrump has long denigrated Washington, D.C, which leans heavily Democratic. Last week, Trump threatened to take over governance of the district if the crime situation isn't improved \u2012 something he floated previously in February.\n\"If D.C. doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they\u2019re not going to get away with it anymore,\" Trump said in an Aug. 5 post on Truth Social.\nSuch action would require approval by Congress.\nThe District of Columbia is a federal enclave under jurisdiction of the U.S. government. The District of Columbia Home Rule Act of 1973 gave the city local governance, including an elected mayor and city council. Two congressional Republicans, Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, this month introduced legislation to repeal the Home Rule Act.\n-Joey Garrison\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

      "text": "Drastic changes coming to homeless services, new Trump order promises\nTrump wants to lock up people with drug or mental health challenges. Advocates say lack of housing is the real problem.\nThe United States is taking a sharp turn in how it addresses homelessness after President Donald Trump ordered a tough new approach that rejects the longstanding \"housing first\" template.\nTrump, angered by messy encampments of homeless people near the White House and on the nation's streets and parks, declared that organizations receiving federal funding must focus first on locking up people with drug or mental health challenges. Trump has long criticized how the United States manages homelessness, and argues public streets aren't safe for either the homeless or residents.\n\"Surrendering our cities and citizens to disorder and fear is neither compassionate to the homeless nor other citizens,\" Trump said in his July 24 order. \"The federal government and the states have spent tens of billions of dollars on failed programs that address homelessness but not its root causes, leaving other citizens vulnerable to public safety threats.\"\nLongtime social workers, medical experts and mental health service providers say the new approach will likely worsen homelessness across the country, particularly because Trump's order contains no new funding for mental health or drug treatment.\nAdditionally, they say the president appears to misunderstand the fundamental driver of homelessness: People can't afford housing.\nThe president's order calls for more \"involuntary commitment,\" which is a process in which mental health workers can forcibly detain and medicate people against their will. Studies have shown that the housing first model is significantly cheaper and more effective than involuntary detention.\n\"Nobody wants people sleeping outside. But if you are someone who doesn't want people sleeping outside, you should vigorously oppose this effort,\" said Dr. Margot Kushel, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco and physician at the Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center, who studies unhoused people. \"Americans want there to be no homelessness. And this is literally a formula to worsen homelessness.\"\n'There's tents outside the White House. You can't have that.'\nSupporters of Trump's approach, which was bolstered by a recent Supreme Court ruling, say it's about time police officers were given the go-ahead to vigorously arrest people for drug possession while reducing the risk of human waste and fire hazards posed by the encampments and \"chronic vagancy\" cited by the president.\nLast year, the annual nationwide assessment found that about 770,000 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January. That number includes people living in hotels or shelters, as well as 5,200 individuals still displaced by the 2023 Maui wildfires.\nTrump issued the order a day before flying to Scotland to visit his golf club, and appeared particularly concerned about an encampment near the White House. But it reflects his longstanding frustration with homelessness in the United States.\nDuring his first administration, Trump urged police to \"get tough\" on encampments, and his new executive order goes even further by ordering authorities to expand involuntary detentions and withdraw funding from communities that don't comply with his approach.\n\"When leaders come to see me to make a trade deal for billions and billions and even trillions of dollars and they come and there's tents outside the White House. You can't have that,\" Trump said.\nNationally, many housing and homeless service providers have moved away from routine involuntary commitments, not just because they're expensive but because the practice is widely considered dehumanizing.\n\"The intention here in New York is not to and never should be to warehouse anybody,\" said Patrick Wildes, the director of Albany Law School\u2019s Government Law Center and the former state assistant secretary for human services and mental hygiene. \"The goal is to help them to get well and, in almost every case, help them return to living among their brothers and sisters in society.\"\nLike other experts, Wildes said the housing first model being targeted by Trump, while not perfect, represents the best, most effective way to stabilize people.\n\"When it comes to supporting people who are struggling with serious mental health or substance use disorders, it's been proven time and time again that having a roof over your head gives you a substantially better chance of getting back on your feet,\u201d he said.\n'No funding or mechanisms in place to make this executive order happen.'\nJesse Rabinowitz, a spokesman and social worker for the National Homelessness Law Center, said Trump's focus on encampments reflects the president's own background as a wealthy developer who doesn't support government-supplied affordable housing.\n\"All this does is treat it like a crime to be sick and poor,\" Rabinowitz said.\nThe executive order also mandates significant new data collection about people who receive services, allowing the government to track who has gotten help and where.\nWhile Trump has criticized the amount of money spent on providing shelter for homeless people, advocates say taxpayers have never provided nearly enough to solve the problems caused by the high costs of rent, stagnant salaries for low-wage workers, and a lack of affordable counseling and drug treatment for people without jobs.\nIn Colorado, a study of people served by community-based mental health provider WellPower, the state's largest, found that getting homeless people into supportive housing saved taxpayers more than $3,700 per person annually in costs such as jail and police time. The study found that 77% of people who were given housing first remained in that housing three years later.\nHeidi Eastman, WellPower's vice president of housing and resources, said that while advocates are still trying to understand the full ramifications of Trump's order, it's not clear how fast change will come and where.\n\"There's no funding or mechanisms in place to make this executive order happen,\" said Eastman, a longtime clinical social worker. \"It's going to put a bigger strain on the providers, it's going to overload the system, and it will require more expensive services for people who may not need inpatient hospitalization.\""

      "text": "In major decision, Supreme Court allows cities to ban homeless camps\nThe decision is the most significant ruling from the court on homelessness in decades. Last year, 40% of homeless people slept under bridges, on sidewalks, in parks, cars, and abandoned buildings.\nWASHINGTON \u2212 The Supreme Court ruled Friday that people without homes can be arrested and fined for sleeping in public spaces, overturning a lower court\u2019s ruling that enforcing camping bans when shelter is lacking is cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe 6-3 decision was the most significant ruling on the issue from the high court in decades.\nIt comes as record numbers of Americans lack permanent housing and as both Democratic and Republican leaders have complained a 2018 decision by a lower court has hamstrung their ability to address homeless encampments that threaten health and public safety.\n\u201cThe Court cannot say that the punishments Grants Pass imposes here qualify as cruel and unusual,\u201d Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority, referring to the small Oregon municipality at the center of the case.\n\u201cThe city imposes only limited fines for first-time offenders, an order temporarily barring an individual from camping in a public park for repeat offenders, and a maximum sentence of 30 days in jail for those who later violate an order.\u201d\nCruel and unusual punishment?\nBut Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the court's liberal minority, said the laws essentially criminalized the act of sleeping.\n\u201cSleep is a biological necessity, not a crime,\u201d Sotomayor wrote in dissent, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. \u201cFor some people, sleeping outside is their only option.\u201d\nSotomayor noted that Grants Pass jails and fines people who sleep in public, such as in a car, or for using as little as a blanket to keep warm or a rolled-up shirt as a pillow. \u201cFor people with no access to shelter, that punishes them for being homeless,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat is unconscionable and unconstitutional.\u201d\nAnn Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said the decision gives \u201cfree reign to local officials who prefer pointless and expensive arrests and imprisonment, rather than real solutions.\u201d\n\u201cThis tactic has consistently failed to reduce homelessness in the past,\u201d Oliva said, \u201cand it will assuredly fail to reduce homelessness in the future.\u201d\n`Urgent relief' to communities\nTheane Evangelis, who represented Grants Pass, said the decision brought \u201curgent relief to the many communities that have struggled to address the growing problem of dangerous encampments.\u201d\n\u201cFor the past six years, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decisions have tied the hands of local governments,\u201d Evangelis said. \u201cThe Court has now restored the ability of cities on the frontlines of this crisis to develop lasting solutions that meet the needs of the most vulnerable members of their communities, while also keeping our public spaces safe and clean.\u201d\nThe San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which oversees nine Western states, ruled in 2018 that banning camping in areas lacking sufficient shelter beds amounts to cruel and unusual punishment under the 8th Amendment.\nThe Supreme Court declined to weigh in at the time on that case from Boise, Idaho, but took up the issue this term after that precedent was used to challenge anti-camping rules in Grants Pass.\nHomeless residents of the southern Oregon city of 38,000 had faced fines starting at $250 and leading to jail time for repeat offenses.\nCriminalizing homelessness in a city without a homeless shelter\nAdvocates for homeless people said the rules amounted to criminalizing someone for having nowhere to live. The city lacks sufficient affordable housing. The one shelter for adults requires attending daily Christian services and other rules. Hundreds of residents are unhoused.\n\"We don't want to be in the parks,\" said Helen Cruz, a Grants Pass resident who lacks permanent shelter. \"We want a place to live.\"\nCity officials said without the Supreme Court\u2019s intervention, they would be forced to surrender their public spaces.\nThe Department of Justice had mostly backed the challengers while also arguing that the appeals court ruling was too broad and didn\u2019t take into account individual circumstances such as whether someone had access to a shelter and refused it.\nOn any given night in the United States, more than 600,000 people are likely to be homeless, according to the federal government. Last year, 40% of homeless individuals slept under bridges, on sidewalks, in parks, cars, abandoned buildings and other public locations.\nThe case, which is the City of Grants Pass v. Johnson, attracted an unusually large number of briefs filed by outside interests.\nAdvocates for the homeless hoped that even if the decision didn't go their way, the case would spur elected officials at all levels of government to do more to address homelessness."

      "text": "The Office of the DC Attorney General sent an email to area hospitals on Thursday afternoon warning them to prepare for an influx of involuntary hospitalizations as the White House ordered an increase of law enforcement in Washington, DC.\nLast weekend, former DOGE operative Edward \u201cBig Balls\u201d Coristine was carjacked near 14th Street. Since that incident, President Trump has ramped up his criticism of DC, saying he plans to crack down on crime and homelessness in the District. He\u2019s increased federal law enforcement presence in the District and deployed off-duty FBI agents to fight street crime in DC.\nThe email sent by Attorney General Brian Schwalb\u2019s office on Thursday warned area hospitals to expect a \u201csurge of arrests and FD-12s by local law enforcement and federal partners.\u201d FD-12 is the legal process by which local law enforcement in DC can involuntarily hospitalize someone if they are experiencing mental illness and are a danger to themselves or others. The email went on to read that the OAG expects an: \u201canticipated and concerted effort to clear out homeless tents/encampments and parks. This may result in a high volume of involuntary hospitalizations.\u201d\nThe White House has touted civil commitment as a solution to homelessness, encouraging states and cities to expand the process in a recent executive order aimed at homelessness. But experts say that civil commitment and institutionalization does not address the root causes of homelessness. The order also ends federal support for \u201chousing first,\u201d a longstanding federal policy that was used to cut veteran homelessness in half.\nTrump has also stated he plans to clear homeless encampments in DC. \u201cThe Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,\u201d he wrote in a Truth Social Post on Sunday. \u201cWe will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.\u201d The post used a couple of photos, apparently taken en route to his golf course, to illustrate Trump\u2019s comments, including one of tents along a highway ramp near the National Mall. Homelessness is down in DC this year with the recent 2025 Point-in-Time count showing a 9% decrease.\nCamping is already banned on all city land in DC, and the city regularly conducts encampment clearings and closures. On federal land in DC, camping is also an arrestable offense. In recent months the National Park Service has ramped up encampment closures following a March executive order by Trump that established the \u201cD.C. Safe and Beautiful Task Force.\u201d According to an NPS spokesperson, the agency closed 66 encampments from March through July 31. Though earlier data is less complete, past reporting shows that in 2024 NPS closed only nine encampments in a similar length period between May and September.\nIn March, Trump also demanded that DC Mayor Muriel Bowser clear an encampment along the E Street Expressway. The city cleared the encampment with short notice following his demand, leaving residents scrambling with nowhere to go."

Last year, 40% of homeless people slept under bridges, on sidewalks, in parks, cars, and abandoned buildings.\nWASHINGTON \u2212 The Supreme Court ruled Friday that people without homes can be arrested and fined for sleeping in public spaces, overturning a lower court\u2019s ruling that enforcing camping bans when shelter is lacking is cruel and unusual punishment.\nThe 6-3 decision was the most significant ruling on the issue from the high court in decades.\nIt comes as record numbers of Americans lack permanent housing and as both Democratic and Republican leaders have complained a 2018 decision by a lower court has hamstrung their ability to address homeless encampments that threaten health and public safety.\n\u201cThe Court cannot say that the punishments Grants Pass imposes here qualify as cruel and unusual,\u201d Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority, referring to the small Oregon municipality at the center of the case.\n\u201cThe city imposes only limited fines for first-time offenders, an order temporarily barring an individual from camping in a public park for repeat offenders, and a maximum sentence of 30 days in jail for those who later violate an order.\u201d\nCruel and unusual punishment?\nBut Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the court's liberal minority, said the laws essentially criminalized the act of sleeping.\n\u201cSleep is a biological necessity, not a crime,\u201d Sotomayor wrote in dissent, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. \u201cFor some people, sleeping outside is their only option.\u201d\nSotomayor noted that Grants Pass jails and fines people who sleep in public, such as in a car, or for using as little as a blanket to keep warm or a rolled-up shirt as a pillow. \u201cFor people with no access to shelter, that punishes them for being homeless,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThat is unconscionable and unconstitutional.\u201d\nAnn Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said the decision gives \u201cfree reign to local officials who prefer pointless and expensive arrests and imprisonment, rather than real solutions.\u201d\n\u201cThis tactic has consistently failed to reduce homelessness in the past,\u201d Oliva said, \u201cand it will assuredly fail to reduce homelessness in the future.\u201d\n`Urgent relief' to communities\nTheane Evangelis, who represented Grants Pass, said the decision brought \u201curgent relief to the many communities that have struggled to address the growing problem of dangerous encampments.\u201d\n\u201cFor the past six years, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decisions have tied the hands of local governments,\u201d Evangelis said. \u201cThe Court has now restored the ability of cities on the frontlines of this crisis to develop lasting solutions that meet the needs of the most vulnerable members of their communities, while also keeping our public spaces safe and clean.\u201d\nThe San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which oversees nine Western states, ruled in 2018 that banning camping in areas lacking sufficient shelter beds amounts to cruel and unusual punishment under the 8th Amendment.\nThe Supreme Court declined to weigh in at the time on that case from Boise, Idaho, but took up the issue this term after that precedent was used to challenge anti-camping rules in Grants Pass.\nHomeless residents of the southern Oregon city of 38,000 had faced fines starting at $250 and leading to jail time for repeat offenses.\nCriminalizing homelessness in a city without a homeless shelter\nAdvocates for homeless people said the rules amounted to criminalizing someone for having nowhere to live. The city lacks sufficient affordable housing. The one shelter for adults requires attending daily Christian services and other rules. Hundreds of residents are unhoused.\n\"We don't want to be in the parks,\" said Helen Cruz, a Grants Pass resident who lacks permanent shelter. \"We want a place to live.\"\nCity officials said without the Supreme Court\u2019s intervention, they would be forced to surrender their public spaces.\nThe Department of Justice had mostly backed the challengers while also arguing that the appeals court ruling was too broad and didn\u2019t take into account individual circumstances such as whether someone had access to a shelter and refused it.\nOn any given night in the United States, more than 600,000 people are likely to be homeless, according to the federal government. Last year, 40% of homeless individuals slept under bridges, on sidewalks, in parks, cars, abandoned buildings and other public locations.\nThe case, which is the City of Grants Pass v. Johnson, attracted an unusually large number of briefs filed by outside interests.\nAdvocates for the homeless hoped that even if the decision didn't go their way, the case would spur elected officials at all levels of government to do more to address homelessness."

      "text": "President Trump says other US cities could be next as he deploys National Guard to DC\n\"We're not going to lose our cities over this,\" Trump said as he mentioned plans to potentially expand his crackdown on crime to New York, Chicago, Baltimore and other cities. \"This will go further.\"\nWASHINGTON \u2015 President Donald Trump said he might expand his crackdown on crime in the nation's capital to other major U.S. cities as he announced plans to send 800 National Guard troops into Washington, D.C.\nTrump singled out New York City, Los Angeles, Baltimore, Chicago and Oakland, California during a Monday, Aug. 11, news conference as potential future targets in what would be a drastic escalation of federal presence on the streets of American cities.\n\"We're not going to lose our cities over this. This will go further. We're starting very strongly with D.C., and we're going to clean it up real quick,\" Trump said.\nTrump did not elaborate on his plans for other cities. But one of the two executive actions he signed Aug. 11 directed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to coordinate with governors of states and \"authorize the orders of any additional members of the National Guard to active service, as he deems necessary and appropriate, to augment this mission.\"\n\"We're going to take back our capital,\" Trump said. \"And then we'll look at other cities also. But other cities are studying what we're doing.\"\nTrump warns cities to 'learn their lesson'\nEach of the cities that Trump mentioned are led by Democratic mayors in states with Democratic governors, who could be less likely to request the Trump administration's intervention than Republican governors who are political allies of the president.\n\"Other cities are hopefully watching this.... And maybe they\u2019ll self-clean up,\" Trump said, adding they could be targeted if \"they don't learn their lesson\" and study his administration's moves in Washington. He said he plans to look at New York City next \"and if we need to, we're going to do the same thing in Chicago.\"\nIn a separate executive order, Trump invoked authority under Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to take control of Washington\u2019s police department. The move, authorized by federal law as part of the District of Columbia's unique status as a federal enclave, is not an option for Trump elsewhere.\nSecretary of Army Daniel Driscoll is set to lead the National Guard\u2019s operation in Washington.\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth said the Pentagon is also prepared to bring in additional National Guard units and other specialized units if needed. \"They will be strong. They will be tough. And they will stand with their law enforcement partners,\" Hegseth said.\n\"This is nothing new for DOD,\" he added, pointing to Trump\u2019s deployment of military troops at the United States-Mexico border to crack down on illegal immigration.\nTrump's authority to direct National Guard troops was challenged earlier this year after he tapped the California National Guard to quell protests over widespread deportations from increased immigration enforcement in the Los Angeles area. After Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom challenged Trump's control over the troops, a judge ruled in favor of Trump.\nTrump reeled off a list of recent violent crimes in Washington, D.C. to justify his actions. Yet, volent crimes so far in 2025 are down 26% compared to last year, and homicides are down 12%, according to statistics compiled by the Metropolitian Police Department. Similarly, homicides in New York City are down in 2025 compared to the same time last year.\nMayors push back at Trump's threat\nAn FBI report released Aug. 5 found violent crime in 2024 dropped by 4.5% in the United States compared to 2023, with murder and non-negligent manslaughter decreasing by nearly 15%.\nThe U.S. Conference of Mayors, which represents about 1,400 mayors, responded to Trump's actions and threats by touting a \"nationwide success story\" of plummeting crime rates.\n\"Ultimately, the best public safety outcomes are delivered by local police departments and local officials, who know the communities,\" Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt, president of the mayors' conference, said in a statement. \"America\u2019s mayors never see takeovers by other levels of government as a tactic that has any track record of producing results.\"\nBaltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, in response to Trump singling out his city, said \"Baltimore is the safest it's been in over 50 years,\" adding that homicides are down about 28% in 2025.\n\"We still have real work to do to build on this progress,\" Scott said in a statement, \"but that work starts and ends here in Baltimore, with the local, state, and federal partners who have gotten us this far.\"\nContributing: Cybele Mayes-Osterman of USA TODAY\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

      "text": "'This is an emergency': 5 takeaways after Trump deploys troops in DC, takes over police\nPresident Donald Trump laid out an aggressive plan for the federal government to take over law enforcement in Washington and teased that the same force might be coming to other cities across the country.\nJoined by top administration officials, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, the president announced the National Guard will be deployed in the nation's capital and that the local police will be placed under federal control.\n\"This is an emergency,\" Trump said. \"This is a tragic emergency.\"\nThe president painted a dark portrait of the city throughout an Aug. 11 press conference, describing it as overrun by homeless people, drug addicts and other \"bloodthirsty criminals\" that his administration will no longer tolerate.\nMany residents and activists have long resisted those characterizations as false and racially motivated attacks against the city, which has lobbied for statehood in recent years.\nMayor Muriel Bowser pushed back at the president's claims of rising crime over the weekend, saying residents \"are not experiencing a crime spike.\" She underscored the need for D.C. statehood during a separate press conference on Aug. 11 hours after Trump's comments.\n\"We are American citizens. Our families go to war, we pay taxes and we uphold the responsibilities of citizenship,\" Bowser said. \"And while this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can't say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we're totally surprised.\"\nBut Trump and his allies have been keen on spotlighting individual violent crimes against reporters, White House aides and congressional staffers that often seize headlines and startle tourists.\nDemocrats and other critics pointed out that Washington's homicide rate is down 32% year-to-date, according to the Metropolitan Police Department. They called Trump's move another abuse of his executive authority.\nHere are key takeaways from Trump's press conference.\nTrump administration taking over DC police\nTrump signed two executive orders, the first invoking the 1973 Home Rule Act, which allows the president to assume control of Washington police for 48 hours if they determine \"that special conditions of an emergency nature exist...\"\nSuch a takeover can be extended with congressional approval but any request of more than 30 days must be passed into law.\nIn a separate order, Trump ordered Hegseth to deploy National Guard troops in Washington, which also authorized him to work with governors of other states to utilize their guard as well.\nKey officials within the administration are now being tasked with overseeing DC's law enforcement agencies, including Bondi, who will take command of the local Metropolitan Police Department. Drug Enforcement Agency Administrator Terry Cole, who was sworn in last month, will serve as interim federal commissioner of the police department.\nWhite House spotlights DOGE staffer and other crime victims\nDuring the press conference, Trump sprinkled in many individual cases of violent crime that he argued justified his takeover, such as the May 21 fatal shooting of two Israeli embassy staffers outside a downtown museum.\nOne at the top of mind was the assault of Edward Coristine, who worked as a staffer with the Department of Government Efficiency. An Aug. 3 police report, obtained by USA TODAY, said officers observed a group of about 10 juveniles surrounding Coristine's car and assaulting him around 3 a.m.\n\"He was left dripping in blood,\" Trump said. \"He thought he was dead, with a broken nose and concussion. Can't believe that he's alive. He can't believe it.\"\nThe president also evoked Phillip Todd, a former aide to Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, who was stabbed in 2023. Trump described the attacker, identified by police as Glynn Neal, as a \"demented lunatic.\"\nIn an August profile by The Washington Post, Todd, a son of Christian missionaries, said that he had forgiven Neal and was rethinking his views on crime and punishment.\nChicago, other cities could see federal oversight, Trump warns\nWhile ticking off individual cases, Trump noted that his Washington takeover might be brought to cities including Chicago; Baltimore; Los Angeles and Oakland, California.\nThose Democratic-controlled cities and states, Trump said, have adopted left-leaning policies, such \"no cash bail\" rules, that he blamed for violent crime.\n\"This issue directly impacts the functioning of the federal government, and is a threat to America, really,\" he said. \"It's a threat to our country. We have other cities also that are bad, very bad.\"\nChicago was in the news earlier this summer for a historic drop in crime that Mayor Brandon Johnson, who Trump called out during the press conference, has touted.\n\"This reduction in hate crimes and of violence generally is a testament to what\u2019s possible when we invest in people and community safety in a holistic way,\" Johnson said in a July 18 statement that credited \"strategic, constitutional policing\" and \"jobs for young people, access to mental health care, and housing people can afford.\"\nSimilar trends have occurred in Baltimore, which has seen a 24% decrease in homicides and an 18% decline in nonfatal shootings, according to Mayor Brandon Scott.\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, the Democratic Mayor's Association said federal intervention isn't needed and argued the president is looking to create a \"political charade\" to distract voters.\n\"Let's be clear: Crime is down in most major cities \u2212 including Washington, DC \u2212 in spite of Donald Trump, not because of him,\" the group said. \"If Trump actually cared about reducing crime, he wouldn't have made unprecedented cuts to public safety programs that actually work.\"\nCongress' takeover of Washington could come next\nTrump's crackdown in Washington could be followed by further changes, specifically to its home rule status, which is often a favorite punching bag for congressional Republicans.\nAhead of the president's press conference, Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, declared that now is the time for lawmakers to take control of the city.\n\"We should pass the BOWSER Act in September and return full control of Washington to Congress,\u201d Lee said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\nThe bill, dubbed \u201cBringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident\u201d was introduced earlier this year, and was named after Bowser as a criticism of crime and alleged corruption in the city.\nLee co-sponsored the measure with Rep. Andy Ogles, R-Tennessee, and cited an ongoing scandal involving a Washington police commander who in July was suspended for allegedly changing crime stats. He also noted how in some news reports local residents said they were afraid to speak out about crime.\nTrump appeared to allude to the Ogles-Lee proposal to rescind home rule. \"We're going to change the statue, and I'm going to have to get the Republicans to vote, because the Democrats are weak on crime,\" he said.\nDemocrats point fingers on DC statehood while others focus on Trump\nNational Democrats took a few swings at Trump's declaration, casting it as a political ploy more than a fight to improve public safety.\n\"The most violent cities are in Republican states \u2212 and there's no takeover happening there,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, a rumored 2028 presidential contender, said in a post on X. \"This is just another attempt to distract from Trump's corruption and suppress dissent.\"\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a former Democratic vice presidential nominee, described Trump's announcement in stark terms, saying on X: \"The road to authoritarianism is littered with people telling you you\u2019re overreacting.\"\nBut some Democrats said the party failed to protect Washington when it had the chance four years ago when Joe Biden was still president and they ran Congress.\n\"Trump is going to federalize D.C.,\" Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-California, said in an Aug. 11 post on X.\n\"Senate Dems could have stopped this when we had power,\" he added \"In 2021, the House voted to make D.C. a state, but a few Senate Dems flinched and genuflected to the filibuster. Now, DC will be under an aspiring dictator\u2019s control.\""

Critics, including local officials and social workers, argue that Trump's approach may exacerbate the issues rather than solve them, as crime rates in D.C. have been declining. Advocates for the homeless warn that his focus on involuntary commitments and clearing encampments ignores the root causes of homelessness, such as lack of affordable housing.",
