      "feedback": "Overall strengths: you anchor the narrative in a tangible policy backdrop (the big, beautiful bill) and couple it to near‑term sector signals (UAS, AI/fintech platforms, health tech). Gaps: the piece lacks a formal 3–6 month catalyst map, explicit path‑dependency and invalidation hooks, and tightly quantified, source‑backed near‑term bets. Actionable edits below.\n\n- Build a formal 3–6 month catalyst map: specify four to six triggers (policy cadence around the big, beautiful bill and its tax/Medicaid provisions; evolving debt‑to‑GDP expectations and yields; tariff/regulatory shifts; UAS hiring/data in Grand Forks; private‑market funding/valuations for Pacaso, mogul, Range; AI/health‑tech regulatory milestones). For each trigger, specify timing window (e.g., 0–2 weeks, 1–3 months, 3–6 months), the expected market transmission (which assets or sectors would move and why), and a clear invalidation scenario (e.g., growth surprises, meaningful deficit narrowing, or policy reversals). Tie each trigger to a source ID and a concrete data point (EPJYXB7DX for the policy bill, FOM34PUWA for UAS jobs, UPV3X2MQ6 for Range/Pacaso/mogul themes, ILYC1M41F for HeartSciences).\n\n- Strengthen the causal chain with first‑principles grounding: map deficits/debt dynamics to rate/yield channels, then to sectoral flows (AI/tech platforms, specialized real assets, health‑tech diagnostics). Explicitly explain why a higher deficit path might sustain growth via fiscal multipliers or, conversely, pressure yields and tighten financial conditions. Concretize with the cited figures: the bill’s tax relief of about $4.4 trillion over a decade and roughly a $4 trillion debt impact (cite EPJYXB7DX; corroborate with Fox Business style figures if you keep them, but anchor to the ID you cite in your draft), the Medicaid work‑requirement change (80 hours/month) and other changes (cite UPV3X2MQ6 or FOM34PUWA as appropriate), and the UAS/tech productivity anecdotes (cite FOM34PUWA and ILYC1M41F).\n\n- Make the numbers explicit and currency‑bounded: for each pillar, present a compact data line (e.g., UAS jobs rose 97% over a decade to 1,400 in 2025 with average pay about $105,912; Pacaso expansion to 10 international destinations and a $1.8T vacation‑home market; Range/Mogul metrics like >$6B assets under management and 18.8% implied long‑term returns), and HeartSciences’ $32B ECG market opportunity with Medicare reimbursement starting 2025 (cite FOM34PUWA; UPV3X2MQ6; ILYC1M41F). Do not rely on qualitative summaries alone; attach the numeric anchors to their IDs.\n\n- Clarify base case vs 1–2 plausible alts with explicit triggers: base case should be a debt‑heavy but growth‑driven arc; alt A could be a “policy‑tightening shock” (quicker deficit containment or regulatory headwinds) and alt B a “AI/health‑tech productivity upside” scenario that accelerates growth and disinflation. For each, spell out the trigger set, the timing window, expected market signals, and the invalidation point (e.g., data prints that beat/melow current growth and inflation forecasts; policy pivots). Present these in tight bullets with citation IDs.\n\n- sharpen watch‑list signals and timing windows: add 5–7 signals tied to concrete data releases or events (policy cadence on the bill, debt/yield prints, UAS employment data, private‑market fundraising/valuation cycles for Pacaso/mogul/Range, AI productivity news, Medicare/Medicaid regulatory milestones, HeartSciences FDA/clinical milestones). Map each signal to a source ID and to a probable directional read on 3–6 month prices or valuations.\n\n- ensure citation discipline and reconcile conflicts: after every factual claim, append the corresponding source ID (EPJYXB7DX for the policy bill; FOM34PUWA for UAS; UPV3X2MQ6 for FIRE/Range/Mogul; ILYC1M41F for HeartSciences; others as used). Where sources disagree (e.g., bill size vs debt impact), present a concise reconciliation note (which figure you’re anchoring on, why, and the range across sources).\n\n- tighten prose and structure for world‑class clarity: replace long, hedged sentences with a linear causal chain (policy → deficits → rates → sectoral transmission → near‑term asset signals), and present the four to six catalysts in a single, scannable map. Conclude with a precise “Base case; 1–2 alts; key risks; watch‑list signals; confidence” section, each with explicit numeric anchors and timing windows.\n\n- avoid overreliance on non‑ID sources: if you keep references to material outside the given IDs, either map them to the closest ID or drop them; ensure every quantitative claim has a linked ID (EPJYXB7DX, FOM34PUWA, UPV3X2MQ6, ILYC1M41F, etc.) and that you cover critical data points from those sources.\n\nIf you implement these edits, you’ll produce a 3–6 month scenario with a precise catalyst map, explicit timing, rigorous first‑principles framing, quantified signals, and a clean, source‑matched, testable narrative. Base case, 1–2 well‑justified alts, clear risks, watch‑list signals, and a defined confidence level will be explicit and testable, anchored to the IDs you have.",
