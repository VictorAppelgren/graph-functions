  "content": "Sony, raising the price of its PlayStation 5 consoles by $50 each in the US. Joining me now is someone who is all plugged into this. That would be Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley. Dan!\n\nMy goodness. Uh yeah, you just saw that. The PlayStation 5 Pro 749 for a starting price. Uh these are steep prices, right? 4.99 for the no disc version, 549 for the disc version. I'm just going to go go out there, just get the disc version. There's only so much memory on the no disc and then you got to delete and everything like that. But this is a big deal. This, they say, is a result of quote unquote economic conditions. They don't specifically say tariffs, but you can read between those lines pretty well that it's probably tariffs. These are uh machines that are built overseas, some in China, some in Vietnam. Um you know, and it's something that's happened to a bunch of companies already. Microsoft's Xbox, they raised prices. Nintendo, oddly enough, raised the price on the original Switch, but not the new one, the Switch 2. They did, however, raise the price uh the initial announced price on accessories, and I noticed when I bought my switch, it came from Vietnam, rather than China. The tariffs on Vietnam at that point were lower than the ones on China. So all these companies are dealing with this at the same time. And you know, it it hits at an odd point because I look at the console that's in my, you know, on my uh entertainment center at home, and now it's worth more than it was when I originally bought it. $50 more, right? But the Xbox worth, I forget how much they raised it, but I think it was around $50. Also worth more. A switch that I had forever ago is is now more expensive. So it's it's something that's going to impact the the game industry as far as the hardware goes for for a while. I I guess we'll just have to see if they eventually lower the prices again. Obviously that happens over the course of a console uh uh life cycle. At this point we'd usually be starting to see prices drop, not increase by 50 bones. So it's it's a lot.\n\nHow, if at all, my friend, do you think this price hike we're talking about here, how could it impact demand in in the broader gaming industry?\n\nIt's going to impact demand. Uh you know, it's it's look, you would look at something like, I mean, 749 is like, you know, I mean, I wasn't going to buy the Pro to begin with. No, you know, I want to. It's just a a big amount of money to drop on a console, right? That the the $500 is is is a lot. People are going to look at that and the folks who were on the bubble who say, oh, you know, it's a good entertainment center and I can use it for, you know, a game like Grand Theft Auto or something when that comes out. I mean, that's going to help move systems for sure, but in the interim, I think people would look that look at that and say, I don't necessarily need this now just because it's that extra money. And you know, we're starting to see game prices increase. Nintendo raised the prices of some of their games. Uh I believe the new Mario Kart World, 80 bucks. We were talking off air though. Everyone chill out. I know that 80 bucks is a lot of money, but games in like the 90s were also 80 bucks. We've skated pretty well on game prices for a long time. The price to develop them is getting higher, so that's just, you know, the way the the the world. Uh I think though that if you combine those two factors, it's going to be an issue for for game companies, except for the likes of Epic. They have free to play games. They have Fortnite, uh Call of Duty is free to play, but they they make a lot of that uh scratch on those, you know, get the new skins, look like Seth Rogan or something in you know, Call of Duty, whatever. The Squid Game folks, Fortnite, you know, you have eight billion people in there, you're fighting an Oreo and a banana or whatever. That ends up making them a ton of cash. So free to play is going to be making a lot of money. These these, you know, don't expect people to be going out buying a console and then, you know, two games along with it and a controller. Don't even get me started on the price of controller. 80 bucks for a controller? Whoa! That's that's nuts. I mean, like I said, it's the price of doing business at this point, but I do think it's going to impact how much people want to get out there and actually buy.\n\nAll right, Dan Howley, thank you, my friend. For sure.",
