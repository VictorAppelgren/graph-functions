  "title": "RNLI makes waves to rescue Sheringham lifeboat station",
  "description": "The site has been shut since January due to safety concerns with the building and cliffs behind it.",
  "content": "The RNLI said steps were being put in place to save one of its lifeboat stations after it was closed due to serious safety concerns. Sheringham's station in Norfolk was shut in January after a survey indicated the building was at the end of its lifespan and the cliff behind it unstable. The charity said it planned to \"continue a lifesaving service from the current Sheringham lifeboat station by completing the remedial works required to make the building safe for its volunteers to operate\". It said it would press ahead with scoping out the works, while working with North Norfolk District Council in terms of planning matters and extension of its lease.\n\nA full cost or start date for the works has yet to be finalised. In the meantime, the lifeboat crew will continue operating its boat from nearby Cromer following a successful trial. Peter Sampson, Sheringham RNLI lifeboat management chair, said: \"We are pleased a decision has been reached and there is a commitment to repairing the lifeboat station at Sheringham. \"It's been a frustrating time for us, but this is positive news. We are looking forward to resuming operations from Sheringham and getting back to what we do best - saving lives at sea.\"\n\nAt the time of the closure, Anna Heslop, RNLI regional operations lead for North and East, said the decision to close was made due to the building backing on to steep land which \"may be at risk of sliding forward\". She said the risk to safety \"was deemed too high to mitigate and manage by the monitoring system alone\" and that further work would need to be done to fully understand the condition of the building.\n\nGeorge Pickford, RNLI interim head of region, said: \"We are grateful for the patience shown by our volunteers and the community as we reviewed the different options for the future of Sheringham RNLI and came to this decision. \"As a charity we must carefully consider how we use our donors' money. \"This decision will ensure the RNLI provides a sustainable lifesaving service across this stretch of coastline and will support our volunteers' desire to save lives at sea.\"",

      "text": "Lifeboat rescues suspended over landslide risk\n- Published\nA lifeboat service has suspended all rescues with immediate effect after a structural survey of its station found serious safety concerns.\nRNLI Sheringham in Norfolk said the decision followed an independent structural engineer inspection of its lifeboat building just before Christmas.\nIts position against a cliff indicated the station building may be at the end of its lifespan and, combined with what was already known about the land behind it, caused increased safety concerns.\nA spokeswoman for the RNLI said the decision to suspend operations was taken in the interests of safety, as the cliff face was in danger of sliding forwards.\nSearch and rescue cover will be instead provided by Wells and Cromer lifeboat services, Sheringham's flanking stations.\nAnna Heslop, RNLI regional operations lead, North and East, said: \"We have taken the incredibly difficult decision to suspend all activity, including lifesaving operations, at Sheringham RNLI immediately.\n\"The station backs onto steep land that may be at risk of sliding forward.\n\"We had an inspection on our lifeboat station building and we've responded swiftly to initial findings about its condition.\n\"Keeping our people safe is our number one priority, it takes courage to speak up about what could go wrong, and that's what happened here \u2013 but we don't underestimate just how hard this is for our Sheringham volunteers who are, rightly, proud of their part in the RNLI's purpose of saving lives at sea.\"\nMs Heslop also confirmed that a monitoring system had been in place, but further analysis on 30 January with a wider group of estates experts found the risk to safety \"was deemed too high to mitigate and manage by the monitoring system alone\".\nShe added: \"The expertise offered on 30 January tells us that we must keep our people out of the station for now and have further work done to fully understand the condition of the building.\"\nGet in touch\nDo you have a story suggestion for Norfolk?\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, external, Instagram, external and X, external.\nRelated topics\nMore local stories\n- Published16 July 2017\n- Published7 August 2024\n- Published11 February\n- Published11 February\n- Published10 February"

      "text": "Lifeboat move postponed due to slipway issues\n- Published\nPlans to remove a lifeboat from an RNLI station in Norfolk have been postponed due to slipway problems.\nThe Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) shut the Sheringham Lifeboat Station with immediate effect on 30 January because the cliff behind the building is unstable.\nA spokesperson for the charity said its move to Wells could not take place after \"operational colleagues identified that the slipway could not be made ready for the launch to go ahead.\"\nThe charity had intended to move the boat on Tuesday, but owing to issues with the slipway it will move the boat at a date yet to be fixed.\nThe RNLI said: \"It is understandable that something like this prevented the launch because the slipway hasn't been receiving its usual maintenance since activities were temporarily suspended when the safety concerns emerged.\"\nThe charity said it would move all of the station's operational equipment to a storage unit in Wells, while it assesses its options for the Sheringham site and service.\nThe spokesperson added: \"The RNLI is now taking action to ensure the safety of kit and equipment, which has been funded by the generous donations of our supporters and members of the public.\"\nThe RNLI said there was no current plan for remediation work at the station, and that an assessment was ongoing to understand \"what, if anything, can be done\" with the building.\nVolunteers at Wells, Cromer and Hunstanton Lifeboat Stations will cover the area until a solution is found at Sheringham.\nThe spokesperson added: \"Removing the lifeboat from the station and relocating it locally allows technicians to gain access to the lifeboat and complete any work or repairs, such as planned maintenance, and prepare it for continued service when a new location nearby is found to launch from.\n\"The RNLI is actively investigating options for alternative launch and recovery sites for both the short and medium term, while options for the future of the building at Sheringham are assessed, decided on and planned for.\"\nGet in touch\nDo you have a story suggestion for Norfolk?\nFollow Norfolk news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, external, Instagram, external and X, external.\n- Published11 February\n- Published16 July 2017"

  "argos_summary": "The RNLI is taking steps to address safety concerns at the Sheringham Lifeboat Station in Norfolk, which was closed in January due to the building's deteriorating condition and unstable cliffs. Plans to relocate the lifeboat to Wells have been postponed due to slipway issues, and the RNLI is currently assessing options for the Sheringham site while ensuring the safety of its equipment. In the meantime, nearby lifeboat stations will cover the area until a solution is found.",
