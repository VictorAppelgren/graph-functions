  "content": "Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears is fighting to define former Rep. Abigail Spanberger in the Virginia gubernatorial race as a far-left liberal by highlighting stances she has taken on trans issues that have hurt Democrats at the ballot box.\n\nMs. Earle-Sears unveiled a TV ad Tuesday \u2014 weeks out from the start of early voting \u2014 that kicks off with a female narrator asking viewers: \u201cHow liberal is Abigail Spanberger?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe voted to allow men in girls\u2019 sports, bathrooms and locker rooms,\u201d the narrator says, citing a 2021 House vote. \u201cAnd if a child secretly identifies as transgender at school, she says that parents shouldn\u2019t be told.\u201d\n\nThe narrator adds: \u201cThat is insane. Spanberger is for they, them, not for us.\u201d\n\nDemocrat Spanberger has consistently led Republican Earle-Sears in the polls ahead of November\u2019s election. However, a recent survey showed the race has tightened as the candidates shift into the post-Labor Day sprint.\n\nWith early voting starting Sept. 19 and their only scheduled debate penciled in for three weeks later, the candidates are scrambling to define each other before their rival does it for them.\n\nA former intelligence officer who served in the House from 2019 to 2025, Ms. Spanbeger is running as a pragmatic problem-solver.\n\nThe married mother of three has focused on making life more affordable for Virginians and has been critical of President Trump\u2019s efforts to downsize the federal workforce.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s continued attacks on Virginia\u2019s federal workforce are hurting Virginians and their families, undermining nonpartisan public service and threatening the strength of Virginia\u2019s economy,\u201d Ms. Spanberger said over the weekend after he issued a new executive order targeting federal collective bargaining agreements.\n\nMs. Earle-Sears has recently turned to trans issues as she tries to challenge the centrist image Ms. Spanberger has projected on the campaign trail.\n\nThe strategy has helped Republicans in recent elections.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s campaign rallies featured clips from the movie \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d to mock transgenders in the military.\n\nMs. Earl-Sears, who served as an electrician in the U.S. Marines, is wrapping her attacks against Ms. Spanberger\u2019s record on transgender issues into a broader pro-parent message \u2014 the likes of which helped her boss, Glenn Youngkin, win the governor\u2019s mansion four years ago.\n\n\u201cAbigail Spanberger supports nude men in girls\u2019 locker rooms and schools transitioning our children,\u201d the lieutenant governor said in a recent post on X. \u201cWhen I\u2019m Governor, girls will be safe, parents will be respected, and ideology won\u2019t trump common sense.\u201d",
