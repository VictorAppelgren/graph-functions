Both analysts highlight the data‑center segment and upcoming GB300 product line as growth catalysts, while noting that China sales could add $2‑$3 billion if license approvals are secured. Institutional investors are also increasing holdings, reflecting confidence in Nvidia’s continued expansion and profitability.",
