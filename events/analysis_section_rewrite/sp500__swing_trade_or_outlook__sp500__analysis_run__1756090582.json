      "feedback": "The draft is strong on data points but two major fixes are needed to reach world-class quality: (a) strictly separate Movers & Scenarios from the Trade/Outlook, ensuring exactly four mover lines (2 Up, 2 Down) with a tight first-principles mapping to the regime framework, and move the Netflix-based Swing Trade entirely into a dedicated Outlook line; (b) ground every number and probability in the source material, attach in-text IDs to asserted facts, and avoid ad hoc 28–28%/25% style probabilities that aren’t evidenced; reweight to evidence-backed probabilities (or High/Med/Low) with explicit citations. Specifically, rewrite each mover to: Up 1–3 months anchored driver (e.g., overseas AUM growth/Cross-border fee pools); Up 1–3 months anchored driver (e.g., ad-tier monetization and ARPU with intl subs progress); Down 1–3 months anchored driver (e.g., reforms stall and slower cross-border monetization); Down 1–3 months anchored driver (e.g., Ford-like cyclical risk and EV margin pressure); for each, include 1–2 watch metrics (ARPU intl subs, overseas AUM expansion, Ford EV trajectory, etc.) and an explicit invalidation trigger tied to the material (e.g., policy signal shift, regime transition indicators, monetization milestones). Then provide a dedicated Swing Trade/Outlook line for Netflix: Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability | Confidence, with Entry at market, Stop 6%, Target 12%, R/R ≈ 2.0, Invalidation on a 4‑week trend break, Trigger via 4–8 week monetization readouts (ARPU and intl subs), and a sourced Probability (e.g., 40–60%) and Confidence (65–70) tied to 61SVFUKBY and related notes. Ensure every numeric claim cites the correct IDs (PA57YBYVQ, 61SVFUKBY, W2622L6WW, 22PL3Q360, RAV2UWRTT, Y4QWID79M, OGK8WLL69, etc.), reconcile any conflicts (e.g., ROIC/WACC implications, regime timing), and tether the whole analysis to the overarching first-principles regime map (inflation/real rates, BoP/cross-border flows, and policy reaction functions) with concise 1–2 sentence linkage in each line.",
