  "description": "Wi-Fi extenders and boosters both improve signal coverage, but differ in how they connect and enhance your network\u2019s range.",
  "content": "What's The Difference Between A Wi-Fi Extender And A Booster?\n\nWi-Fi has become an integral part of modern-day living. It allows us to work from home, play online games, and more \u2014 all without being tied to fixed locations or cables. But let's face it, even if you've a strong router, you'll occasionally suffer from Wi-Fi connectivity issues. Think of problems like weak Wi-Fi signal and dropped connections. That said, if you're like most LAN party attendees, you'll probably hook up your Ethernet cable when your Wi-Fi speed drops. Of course, this might remedy the issue. But it's worth noting that there are other simple yet effective ways in which you can maximize your Wi-Fi, without worrying about cable management. If you want to eliminate these connectivity woes, a Wi-Fi extender or a Wi-Fi booster could be the fix to your Wi-Fi issues. At a glance, these two might look pretty similar and even deliver the same results. And while both allow you to extend your Wi-Fi range to rooms with a weaker signal, the only difference is that they go about it in slightly different ways. A Wi-Fi extender, for instance, grabs your existing signal and stretches it to other areas where the connection is weak. Conversely, a Wi-Fi Booster amplifies the existing signal strength without creating a second network. The results? Fewer interruptions, especially in mid-sized and small homes.\n\nIf you're dealing with a spotty internet connection, the first thing you'll want to check is the router. While there are several reasons why your Wi-Fi is down, the position of your router is usually the most common culprit. Of course, relocating your router to a central location will maximize its effectiveness. But if that doesn't (even after putting the router in an elevated and open position), investing in a Wi-Fi extender is a potential fix. A Wi-Fi extender is a device that acts like a bridge between your router and devices that are outside the range of your router's signal. Its beauty is that it's super easy to install \u2014 just plug in the extender into an outdoor outlet, and it'll create a second access point for the extended signal to connect to devices that are not within your router's reach. Plus, compared to other options for extending your Wi-Fi range (say mesh network), Wi-Fi extenders are much more affordable. Despite these benefits, though, Wi-Fi extenders have their own set of limitations. For instance, they will slow down your Wi-Fi speeds and will only work perfectly in small spaces. You'll also have to switch between networks manually, unless you're using updated models that support seamless roaming. The reason is that most Wi-Fi extenders work by creating a separate network (sometimes with a network name that's slightly different from your original network). For example, if your main router's name is \"MYWiFi,\" the extender will create a new, separate network with a modified name like \"MYWiFi_EXT.\" This implies that you'll have to switch manually between networks when you move from one room to the next, which can be quite frustrating \u2014 especially if you are on a video call.\n\nIf you don't want the hassle of switching between networks, you may want to invest in a Wi-Fi booster. Unlike a Wi-Fi extender that rebroadcasts the signal it receives, a Wi-Fi booster works by strengthening and amplifying your existing signal. This is without creating a secondary network. As such, you'll have a more powerful signal that will penetrate obstacles more effectively and extend to rooms with weak signals smoothly. That means smoother connectivity and fewer network interruptions across your house. Still, just like any other tech gadgets, Wi-Fi boosters have their drawbacks. For instance, if the router itself is limiting your speeds (maybe because it's old or placed behind a couch), a Wi-Fi booster will not fix the issue. Instead, it will amplify whatever speed it receives. That's why if you want to maximize your Wi-Fi performance with this setup, you'll want to check the condition of your router and its location. If possible, mount the booster midway between your dead zone and the main router. You'll also want to avoid the temptation of placing the booster in your basement or an out-of-the-way location.",

      "text": "How To Help Your Home Wi-Fi Network Work At Top Performance\nIf we had to make a list of all the annoying things on the planet, slow Wi-Fi would easily take the cake. In a world where almost everything relies on a swift internet connection, sluggish load times quickly become a major obstacle to everything from entertainment to productivity. But the good news is that you can improve your home Wi-Fi speed with a few simple tweaks, barring the possibility that the issue is from your internet provider.\nBefore we get started, it's important to run a speed test so you have a benchmark that you can use for comparison as you troubleshoot. This way, you'll know if the suggested fixes actually improve your network speed. It also helps to know the maximum speed your internet plan promises, so that you can get a good idea of what speed is obtainable.\nKeep in mind, however, that many Internet Service Providers only guarantee top speeds over a wired connection. This means it might not be possible to get the maximum advertised speed over a Wi-Fi connection, but that doesn't mean you cannot have a smoother browsing experience. Now, without further ado, let's get into the tips and tricks that should help you improve the quality of your Wi-Fi connection at home.\nMove it, move it\nYour Wi-Fi connection is a wireless signal, but it can still be hindered by physical factors. Cupboards, closets, bookshelves, and even walls can potentially obstruct good Wi-Fi signals.\nYou can make a major difference to signal strength and speed by moving your router to an optimal location. What counts as \"better\" placement depends on your home and its layout, but make sure you're choosing a central, prominent position. You want to place the router in a spot that's free from obstructions, and close enough to all your high\u2013priority devices, especially those you might not move around much \u2014 desktop computers, gaming consoles, and televisions, for example. It's also important to choose a spot away from other devices that emit electromagnetic waves: these include microwave ovens, baby monitors, electric heaters, and even TV remotes.\nIf the position you find optimal is a long distance from an outlet, you might need to add cabling to set up your router. It's best to place the router on a flat surface, but if you can't find one near an ideal location, you can mount your router on a wall. This is one of the reasons why it's crucial to take aesthetics into account when buying a router \u2014 you're more likely to stash a router if it's too cumbersome or distracting. If you don't like how the router looks in your space, there are some ways to hide it without killing the signal.\nGo wired\nAs previously mentioned, there's a high chance your router can only deliver its maximum advertised speed over a wired connection. Granted, it's less convenient than a wireless connection. If you need fast internet urgently, connecting your computer to the router via an ethernet cable is one way to go. Not only is the connection more stable than Wi-Fi, but it also can't be affected by physical obstructions or signal overcrowding.\nRouters typically have a number of Ethernet ports, so all you really need is a cable and you'll be good to go. SlashGear has a guide that should help you choose a solid Ethernet cable, but if you're staying wired long-term, you might need to purchase extra gear like repeaters, hubs, and switches to extend your coverage distance. You might also need to do some cable management, since you might be dealing with a entangling wires trailing across your home.\nCut off some connections, update the firmware\nYour network will inevitably slow down if there are too many devices connected to the Wi-Fi. To keep things running at optimal speed, you'll want to review and remove unnecessary or unwanted devices.\nYour router's administrative portal should contain info about what devices are using your data and allow you to remove any unwanted connections \u2014 known or unknown. You can also use your Activity Monitor or Task Manager to check which apps or programs are hogging data and possibly slowing down your Wi-Fi, and then you can quit or close them.\nIf you discover that someone unexpected is using your Wi-Fi without permission, the most straightforward fix is changing your password, according to Asus. After weeding out intruders from your network, it's important to secure it with a solid password so that hackers or piggybackers cannot compromise your connection moving forward. Make sure you use a WPA2 password \u2014 it uses AES encryption, which is both the safest and the fastest security option.\nRouter manufacturers also routinely release software and firmware updates for their products. These are mostly security patches and bug fixes, so they might not take your connection from sluggish to swift in an instant, but it's worth a try. Manufacturers bake the process right into the admin interface. SlashGear has a guide to updating firmware on some popular routers. Older router models might require users to visit the manufacturer's website and download an update, which would then need to be uploaded to the router's management interface. But you might get a significant speed boost if you haven't updated your device in a while.\nChange the channel\nWi-Fi signal is divided into channels, and routers send to and receive data from other devices via a specific Wi-Fi channel which is usually automatically selected. But channels can get crowded or congested, especially if there are other routers in the vicinity using the same default frequency. You might not be able to kick devices off a crowded channel, so the next best thing is to manually change to a different one.\nThe process will be different per router, so you'll need to check your manual or the manufacturer's website for instructions. On most routers, you'll find the option under Wireless Settings > Channel in your admin panel. The current channel would most likely be \"Auto\" but you can click the dropdown menu to select a specific one.\nMost modern routers use dual-band technology, broadcasting at both 2.4-GHz and 5-GHz frequencies. On the former you'd typically find 14 channels. You might need to use a Wi-Fi analyzer like NetSpot to find the least-populated channels, and then switch to one.\nExtend the signal\nIf changing your router's placement and settings still doesn't help your connection speed, consider investing in a Wi-Fi extender or repeater. As their names imply, these devices connect to your Wi-Fi signal and extend it to areas of your home that get little to no coverage.\nYou can use Wi-Fi extenders or mesh network access points, and you should be up and running in no time since they're usually simple to set up and use. You'll have to plug the device in an outlet that's somewhere between the router and the dead zone, and the same rules for router placement apply. That is, choose a prominent, central position, and make sure there are no physical obstructions.\nKeep in mind that the wireless signal you'll get from extenders or repeaters won't be as strong as a direct connection to your router, so it might only be useful for connecting gadgets that don't require a lot of bandwidth.\nIf all these fixes don't help speed up your home network, you might need to reach out to your router's manufacturer for support or an upgrade, or check in with your internet service provider."

      "text": "The Most Common Reasons Your Wi-Fi Is Down (And How To Fix Them)\nWhether you're a student, professional, or just a general consumer, Wi-Fi has become essential to everyone's daily lives. It allows you to connect to the internet, stream your favorite shows, and communicate with people across the globe wirelessly. However, there's nothing more frustrating than when your Wi-Fi connection suddenly drops, leaving you disconnected and seemingly helpless.\nThere can be several reasons why your Wi-Fi is down, and it's essential to know what's causing the problem so you can fix it. First and foremost, ensuring your Wi-Fi router is working is crucial, and a faulty router can cause your internet connection to drop frequently. It's also possible that your Wi-Fi router may be missing an essential firmware update.\nAnother common culprit for Wi-Fi issues is interference from other devices. Various standard home appliances that you use every day can interfere with your Wi-Fi signal and cause slowness or drops, which all depends on the position of your router.\nIf your Wi-Fi issues persist, it may be due to signal congestion. This phenomenon happens when multiple electronic devices in your home use your network simultaneously, causing a bottleneck in the network. Here's how you can diagnose what's causing your Wi-Fi issues, and what you can do to fix them.\nHow to ensure your Wi-Fi router is working properly\nYour Wi-Fi router is the hub of your internet connection. If you're having connection issues, the first thing to check is whether your Wi-Fi router is receiving sufficient power. If you suspect a power outage or have faulty equipment, check if other appliances work correctly. If everything is fine, you can move on to other potential solutions.\nMost Wi-Fi routers have several lights on them that indicate their status. Typically, you'll find a power light, a Wi-Fi light, and other lights that indicate your internet connection. Un-illuminated lights could indicate a problem with your router. Restarting your Wi-Fi router is a simple but effective solution to many connectivity issues. Unplug it for at least 30 seconds, and then plug it back in. After restarting your router, check if your Wi-Fi connection has improved.\nYour Wi-Fi router has software that controls its functionality, known as firmware. Like other software, firmware may have bugs that can cause connectivity issues. Sometimes, manufacturers release firmware updates to address these bugs and improve performance, so it's worth checking if your router needs any firmware updates that could potentially help fix connection issues.\nIf you've tried the other troubleshooting tips and are still experiencing problems, resetting it to the factory settings is another solution. This process erases all customizations and settings you've made. To reset your router, locate the reset button on the back and press and hold it for at least 10 seconds.\nHow to eliminate interference from other devices\nInterference received from other devices is also a contributing factor to Wi-Fi network problems. Appliances like microwaves, cordless phones, and baby monitors can interfere with your signal, disrupting the internet connection.\nThe position of your Wi-Fi router can significantly affect its performance. If you have placed your router in a location close to other home devices, it can lead to interference. Try to relocate your router to a different area in your home, preferably away from objects that may cause interference. Also, ensure you have positioned it at a higher elevation and not hidden behind furniture or walls.\nIf you're experiencing persistent Wi-Fi issues due to interference, upgrading to a mesh Wi-Fi system is a potential fix. This system uses multiple devices or nodes to provide seamless signal coverage throughout your home. The nodes communicate with each other, ensuring that you have a solid and reliable Wi-Fi connection everywhere in your home.\nThe beauty of a mesh Wi-Fi system is that it allows you to add nodes in areas where your Wi-Fi signal may be weak, ensuring consistent coverage throughout your home \u2014 think upstairs bedrooms and offices. The nodes also communicate with each other to optimize your Wi-Fi network, reducing interference and ensuring that your network is running at optimal speed.\nHow to eliminate signal congestion from your Wi-Fi network\nSignal congestion can occur when too many devices are connected to your Wi-Fi network simultaneously. This problem can cause your network to slow down or frequently drop.\nThe first step in identifying which devices to remove is determining which devices you have connected to the network. You can access this information through your router's settings. Most routers allow you to view a list of connected devices, including their IP and MAC addresses.\nNot all devices on your network require a strong Wi-Fi signal to function. Devices like smart bulbs or smart plugs do not require a fast internet connection, while devices like laptops or gaming consoles do. Prioritize disconnecting devices that do not require a fast internet connection to improve the performance of your other devices.\nAnother way to eliminate signal congestion is to disconnect devices not currently in use. Laptops and tablets not in use can still consume bandwidth, leading to slower Wi-Fi speeds for other devices. Ask your family members or roommates to disconnect their devices to improve your Wi-Fi network's performance when not in use.\nHow to prevent unauthorized users to boost network performance\nSecuring your Wi-Fi network is crucial to prevent unauthorized users from accessing and affecting your network's performance. When you purchase a new router, it comes with a default username and password that's easy to guess. To prevent neighbors and others from using your network, you should change your router's default password. Network experts recommend using a strong and unique password that uninvited guests won't guess.\nEnabling Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 encryption on your Wi-Fi network can help protect your network from unauthorized users. WPA2 is the most secure encryption method available for Wi-Fi networks. To enable WPA2 encryption, log in to your router's settings and look for security options. Some routers will have different methods of finding security settings, so make sure to consult any user manual material that came with your equipment.\nWhile all of these can help keep your network safe and ultimately boost performance, it's important to note that securing your Wi-Fi network is an ongoing process, and you need to stay up to date with the latest security patches and updates to protect your network from new threats. With these tips, you can ensure your Wi-Fi network is secure and enjoy seamless connectivity."

      "text": "5 Tips You Need To Know To Maximize Your Wi-Fi Signal\nWi-Fi can be extremely convenient \u2014 it allows you to work, communicate, play games, or stream from anywhere in (or even outside) your home. But it can also be incredibly frustrating when it's not working or giving you the signal you need. Even if you're paying your internet service provider for top speeds, sometimes you just can't get four full bars.\nWireless internet is a complicated technology, and there could be any number of reasons you're not getting the signal you should. Fortunately, there are also several things you can do to get the most out of your Wi-Fi and get the strongest connection you can while in your home.\nSome popular do-it-yourself remedies, like building a metal cage around your antenna, can actually be counterproductive and weaken your Wi-Fi. But there are other, simpler solutions, that are more effective \u2014 many concerning the internet router directly connecting your home to your ISP. Here are some tips you need to know to maximize your Wi-Fi signal.\nUse a Wi-Fi extender or mesh network\nOne main reason your Wi-Fi may be weak is you're simply too far away from your router. If you live in a large home, for example, you likely are using a single router to connect you to outside cable internet, and there could be rooms that are pretty far from where that connection is. Or, if you're trying to get a signal out in your yard or garage, you're probably nowhere near your router.\nIf this is the case, you should invest in a Wi-Fi extender or a mesh system. A Wi-Fi extender is exactly what it sounds like \u2014 a small device that extends the range of your Wi-Fi signal by acting as a relay point. It will receive the Wi-Fi from your router, then broadcast it out from its own antenna. Since it's piggybacking off that original signal, it's not like having a second router, so you'll likely notice some lag, but it's better than the signal not reaching or barely reaching you at all.\nA mesh network, like Eero, will likely cost more money than a Wi-Fi extender, but it will generally provide a stronger signal. By placing each unit of a mesh network around your home, you'll create several Wi-Fi points. The mesh should cover your entire house so that no matter where you are, your device will be close enough to at least one of the mesh units to receive strong Wi-Fi. If you really want to maximize your signal, you can use an app to measure how strong your Wi-Fi is in each area of your home and place the mesh units (or Wi-Fi extenders) in locations that will best reach those dead zones.\nReboot or replace your router\nSometimes, the easiest solution is also the best one. If you're having Wi-Fi trouble, especially if you're close and in line of sight of your router, you may need to just reboot it. Unplug the router from the wall, as well as the cable connected directly to the router, if applicable. You should also remove any ethernet cords plugged in. Once everything's disconnected, wait 10 seconds to a full minute before plugging everything back in, to power cycle and reboot your router. (Restoring a router to its factory settings with a hard reset is also an option, though it's more work.)\nIf that doesn't improve your Wi-Fi, your router may be outdated. Like most technological devices these days, your router will grow less efficient with age. Both the firmware it runs on and its hardware will need to be updated from time to time. If your router was provided to you by your ISP, you can often request a replacement at no extra charge. If it's been more than a couple of years, it's a good time to replace your router. However, you don't have to toss out your old one, because even older, slower routers have other use cases you may want to take advantage of.\nRemember: location, location, location\nIf your router is new and you're still receiving a slow signal, it may have to do with where it's located in your home. While extenders and mesh networks can help with distance, there are other factors to take into account when placing your router in an optimal position. If you can, you should keep it centrally located, especially if your home is too small to really need a mesh network. Don't be afraid to use an extension cord to move your router further from where it connects to your outside ISP cable.\nYou should place your router in an elevated position, like atop a tall bookshelf. Or, if it's located on the second story of your home, you should keep it near the floor. Picture the Wi-Fi signal that emits from your router as coming out in the shape of a sphere or bubble. If it's on the ground of your first floor, half the signal is going into the ground or basement. If it's high up on your top floor, half the signal is going into the roof. Place the router where that full sphere of Wi-Fi can emanate from as much of your home as possible.\nYou should also try to keep your router away from walls and other obstacles that can physically block the Wi-Fi signal, as it will lose strength when it passes through these objects. You can use an app to map the Wi-Fi strength coming from your router and adjust accordingly, but you can even use your eyes. If line-of-sight to your router is blocked by something, the signal will likely be slowed down as well.\nReposition your router's antennas\nMany routers come with attached antennas to help send out the Wi-Fi straight from the source. Often, these antennas will be adjustable. If your home is a single story, 45 degrees is the perfect angle for your antenna, as it will emit the Wi-Fi signal the most evenly.\nIf the router is on the second floor of a two-story home, the antennas should be parallel to the ground. That way, it emits a sphere of signal evenly toward both floors of the house. If the router has the edge of a wall or something else partially obstructing it, position the antennas so they can stick out beyond that obstruction.\nIf the router's antenna is internal, you obviously won't be able to adjust it. However, you should make sure the router is oriented as instructed \u2014 upright or flat \u2014 even if it looks out of place. Routers typically aren't the best-looking appliances, but you shouldn't hide them behind a plant or deep in a bookshelf because you'll obstruct the Wi-Fi signal.\nKeep your router away from electronic interference\nElectronic interference from other devices in your home may be negatively impacting your Wi-Fi signal. Even appliances that aren't connected to the internet, like your refrigerator or an older TV, can create an electromagnetic field that can obstruct or weaken the radio wave frequencies your Wi-Fi is traveling on. But devices that give off their own signals are especially troublesome for Wi-Fi. That includes Internet of Things products like smart lights and smart speakers, as well as baby monitors, cordless phones, garage door openers, and Bluetooth-connected devices.\nWhile most microwaves aren't connected to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, they give off their own interference. Microwaves, as in the actual waves of electromagnetic radiation, have more strength than standard radio waves. While not harmful to humans, the microwaves emitting from your microwave can dominate the Wi-Fi waves trying to pass by between your router and your device. To ensure the strongest Wi-Fi signal possible, you should keep your router 4\u20136 feet away from devices that may cause electrical interference and at least six feet away from your microwave."
