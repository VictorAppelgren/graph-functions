  "content": "Texas lawmakers on Wednesday approved letting private citizens sue abortion pill manufacturers, doctors and anyone who mails the medication, setting the state up to be the first to try to crack down on the most common abortion method.\n\nThe law would be the first of its kind in the US and add another layer of abortion restrictions in Texas, which has some of the toughest in the country and already bans nearly all abortions.\n\nThe bill now goes to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, an abortion opponent who is expected to sign it into law. It would take effect in December, though it is nearly certain to spark legal challenges from abortion rights supporters.\n\nSupporters of the proposal, which passed a final vote in the GOP-controlled Texas Senate, call it a key tool to enforce the state\u2019s ban and protect women and fetuses. Opponents see it as not only another way to rein in abortion but intimidate providers outside Texas who are complying with the laws in their states. They also say it would encourage a form of vigilantism.\n\nThe measure would empower citizens to provide enforcement\n\nUnder the measure, Texas residents could sue those who manufacture, transport or provide abortion-inducing drugs to anyone in Texas for up to $100,000. Women who receive the pills for their own use would not be liable.\n\nUnder the bill, providers could be ordered to pay $100,000. But only the pregnant woman, the man who impregnated her or other close relatives could collect the entire amount. Anyone else who sues could receive only $10,000, with the remaining $90,000 going to charity.\n\nLawmakers also added language to address worries that women would be turned in for seeking to end pregnancies by men who raped them or abusive partners. For instance, a man who impregnated a woman through sexual assault would not be eligible.\n\nThe measure has provisions that bar making public the identity or medical details about a woman who receives the pills.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until those provisions were added, along with the limit of a $10,000 payment for people who aren\u2019t themselves injured by the abortion, that several major Texas anti-abortion groups backed the bill.\n\nTexas Right to Life, one of the state\u2019s most prominent anti-abortion groups, called it the \u201cstrongest pro-life law\u201d in the country.\n\n\u201cThis trend is killing tens of thousands of babies a year and harming their mothers, but today, our law became a blueprint for the rest of the country,\u201d said John Seago, the group\u2019s president.\n\nThe idea of using citizens rather than government officials to enforce abortion bans is not new in Texas. It was at the heart of 2021 law that curtailed abortion there months before the US Supreme Court cleared the way for other state bans to take effect.\n\nIn the earlier law, citizens could collect $10,000 for bringing a successful lawsuit against a provider or anyone who helps someone obtain an abortion. But that measure didn\u2019t explicitly seek to go after out-of-state providers.\n\n\u201cIt is an attempt to turn a Texas abortion ban into a nationwide abortion ban,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Carol Alvarado said before the bill cleared a final vote. \u201cIf California or New York tried to impose their gun laws or climate policies on Texas, this legislature would be outraged.\u201d\n\nAbortion pills have proliferated, even where they\u2019re banned\n\nPills are a tricky topic for abortion opponents. They were the most common abortion method in the US even before the 2022 US Supreme Court ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to enforce abortion bans.\n\nThey\u2019ve become even more widely used since then. Their availability is a key reason that the number of abortions has risen nationally, even though Texas and 11 other states are enforcing bans on abortion in all stages of pregnancy.\n\nThe pills have continued to flow partly because at least eight Democratic-led states have enacted laws that seek to protect medical providers from legal consequences when they use telehealth to prescribe the pills to women who are in states where abortion is illegal.\n\nTexas is already in legal fights over shield laws and abortion pills\n\nEarlier this year a Texas judge ordered a New York doctor to pay more than $100,000 in penalties for providing abortion pills to a Dallas-area woman.\n\nThe same provider, Dr. Maggie Carpenter, faces criminal charges from a Louisiana prosecutor for similar allegations.\n\nNew York officials are invoking their states\u2019 shield laws to block extradition of Carpenter and to refuse to file the civil judgment.\n\nIf higher courts side with Louisiana or Texas officials, it could damage the shield laws.\n\nMeanwhile the attorneys general of Texas and Florida are seeking to join Idaho, Kansas and Missouri in an effort to get courts to roll back US Food and Drug Administration approvals for mifepristone, one of the drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions, contending that there are safety concerns. They say it needs tighter controls because of those concerns.\n\nIf the states are successful, it\u2019s possible the drug could be distributed only in-person and not by telehealth.\n\nMajor medical organizations including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists say the drug is safe.",

      "text": "The Supreme Court\u2019s decision this week rebuffing an effort to restrict access to mifepristone is unlikely to be the final word on the abortion pill \u2013 and the next person to speak will almost certainly be a Trump-appointed judge in Texas at the center of the controversy.\nUS District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk will have to decide later this summer if three conservative states that want to continue the fight against the drug can do so in his court. The decision is one of several in coming weeks that will determine whether \u2013 and if so, how quickly \u2013 the case against mifepristone makes it back to the Supreme Court.\nKacsmaryk, a Donald Trump appointee who previously worked for a Christian legal advocacy group, drew national attention last year by invalidating the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s two-decade-old approval of mifepristone, a sweeping decision that would have removed the drug from the market entirely. Now, both sides in the abortion debate are gearing up for the case to return to his Amarillo courtroom.\n\u201cThis fight isn\u2019t over,\u201d said Carrie Flaxman, a senior legal advisor at Democracy Forward who has long represented reproductive rights groups. \u201cAccess to this medication very much remains at risk.\u201d\nA unanimous Supreme Court on Thursday swatted away the current challenge to mifepristone access without reaching the merits of the case. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, a member of the court\u2019s conservative wing, wrote that the anti-abortion doctors and groups that sued over the drug didn\u2019t have standing because they were not injured by its use.\nBut the court\u2019s decision left open the possibility that some other entity might be positioned to challenge the steps the Food and Drug Administration took in 2016 and 2021 to loosen certain limits on the drug. Those actions included allowing mifepristone to be mailed to patients without a doctor\u2019s visit and allowing it to be used longer in a pregnancy.\n\u201cIt is not clear that no one else would have standing to challenge FDA\u2019s relaxed regulation of mifepristone,\u201d Kavanaugh wrote.\nBy spiking the claims on procedural grounds, the high court avoided weighing in on the merits of the anti-abortion advocates\u2019 arguments about how the pill has been regulated. If opponents of the abortion pill can overcome the procedural hurdles to get the justices to consider the substance of their case, they may find some sympathy with the conservative majority that just two years ago overturned Roe v. Wade.\nWhere Biden\u2019s policies go to die\nEven before the Supreme Court decided the case, three conservative states \u2013 Missouri, Idaho and Kansas \u2013 had sought to intervene to challenge the drug alongside the doctors and anti-abortion groups.\nMissouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, said he is \u201cmoving forward undeterred\u201d with his effort to pursue the case in Texas.\nAn immediate question for Kacsmaryk is whether the states can continue to do so in his court. Generally, parties must be able to justify filing lawsuits in a specific federal court. The doctors and anti-abortion groups who sued over mifepristone incorporated a group called the Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine in Amarillo months before their lawsuit.\nThe groups\u2019 move to bring the case in Amarillo, a far-flung court division in Texas\u2019 panhandle, was among the most controversial aspects of the lawsuit. Kacsmaryk is virtually guaranteed to hear every case that is filed there, and his courthouse has become a favorite option for conservative litigants and states seeking to halt the Biden administration\u2019s agenda.\nOn the bench, Kacsmaryk has handed down a series of rulings killing policies from President Joe Biden\u2019s administration. He has ruled against the administration\u2019s attempt to end the so-called \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d program, for instance, and rejected its effort to use a provision of Obamacare to protect gay and transgender healthcare workers from discrimination.\nEarlier this month, Kacsmaryk blocked the Biden administration from enforcing in four states a federal rule that requires people who sell firearms online and at gun shows to conduct background checks on their potential customers.\nIn the mifepristone case, Kacsmaryk\u2019s initial ruling was notable not just for its sweeping nature but in how he embraced the anti-abortion movement\u2019s sensational rhetoric about the procedure. Kacsmaryk\u2019s decision on mifepristone was later narrowed by a federal appeals court to deal only with the subsequent steps the FDA took to make mifepristone easier to obtain.\nAs the administration\u2019s appeal of Kacsmaryk\u2019s abortion ruling played out at the Supreme Court, the trial judge granted the three states\u2019 bid to intervene in the legal challenge in his court. With the Supreme Court now ruling that the underlying litigation must be tossed because the doctors and groups don\u2019t have standing to sue, it\u2019s not clear that Missouri would be able to continue its lawsuit in Kacsmaryk\u2019s court in Texas.\n\u201cThis lawsuit should not be permitted to continue in Amarillo, because now that the Supreme Court has found that the original plaintiffs lacked standing, that means the case was defective from the start,\u201d Julia Kaye, senior staff attorney for the ACLU, said.\nThe groups fighting mifepristone argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision shouldn\u2019t affect the states\u2019 ability to sue.\nThe \u201cruling does not impact the states below,\u201d said Erin Hawley, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, the conservative group that represented the doctors at the Supreme Court. \u201cI would expect the litigation to continue with those states raising different standing arguments than made by our doctors.\u201d\nAides to the attorneys general in Missouri, Idaho and Kansas did not respond to a request for comment.\nIf Kacsmaryk decides that those states cannot continue their lawsuit in his courthouse in Texas, those attorneys general \u2013 and perhaps Republican leaders of other states \u2013 may look for a friendly courthouse elsewhere to file a similar challenge. However, in most federal courthouses in other states, their lawsuit would be randomly assigned to one of multiple judges \u2013 not all of whom would be stalwart conservatives.\nStates may also lose on standing\nIn the mifepristone case, the anti-abortion doctors who sued claimed that they faced the risk of being forced to treat patients dealing with complications from the drug, such as heavier-than-expected bleeding. Triaging those women, they said, had a substantial impact on their practices. Both the FDA and several medical groups, including the American Medical Association, told the Supreme Court that mifepristone is safe.\nSome said they had been called on to perform post-medication abortion procedures they said violated their beliefs. But the Supreme Court knocked that argument aside, noting that federal law already allows doctors to avoid performing procedures that violate their conscience.\nThe states make a different argument on standing: That state-run hospitals and insurance programs have to pay the cost for adverse effects from the drug.\nThose kind of claims are heavily debated but even bank shot efforts by states to challenge federal action have sometimes found a receptive audience at the Supreme Court. Last term, a 6-3 majority shot down Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness program. To do so, the court determined that Missouri could establish standing because a quasi-government loan servicing entity would lose out on an estimated $44 million in fees from loans that would have been forgiven under the plan.\nAdam Unikowsky, a veteran Supreme Court litigator who has closely followed the mifepristone case, predicted it will be hard for the states to get the issue back before the Supreme Court. Even if they can keep the current case going in Kacsmaryk\u2019s court \u2013 a tall order \u2013 states will have to convince lower courts that they were injured by the expanded access to mifepristone.\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision this week doesn\u2019t explicitly foreclose that possibility, Unikowsky said, but it also did not make the path any easier.\n\u201cThey\u2019re leaving the door barely ajar for someone else to give it a shot,\u201d he said. But Unikowsky said he believes the states\u2019 claim \u201cis still weak on standing.\u201d\nJaime Santos, co-chair of the appellate and Supreme Court litigation practice at the law firm Goodwin, predicted that the states are \u201cgoing to have a very hard time \u2013 and probably an impossible time\u201d continuing the case against the FDA\u2019s actions.\nIf the states try to argue that they\u2019ll have to pay for women who wind up in the emergency room after taking mifepristone, she said, \u201cthat\u2019s just the kind of speculative injury that Justice Kavanaugh said isn\u2019t enough.\u201d"

      "text": "A Texas judge on Thursday ordered a New York doctor to pay more than $100,000 in penalties for prescribing abortion pills to a woman near Dallas, a ruling that could test \u201cshield laws\u201d in Democratic-controlled states where abortion is legal.\nThe ruling was handed down on the same day New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected a request from Louisiana to extradite the same doctor, Dr. Maggie Carpenter, who was charged in that state with prescribing abortion pills to a pregnant minor.\nUnlike Louisiana, Texas did not file criminal charges against Carpenter but accused her in a December lawsuit of violating state law by prescribing abortion medication via telemedicine. Texas has one of the most restrictive abortion bans in the nation.\nState District Judge Bryan Gantt issued the fine against Carpenter and ordered her to pay attorney\u2019s fees. He also issued an injunction barring Carpenter from prescribing abortion medication to Texas residents. Gantt noted in his order that despite being notified, Carpenter failed to appear in court.\nEarlier Hochul, a Democrat, said she would not honor Louisiana\u2019s request to arrest and send the doctor to Louisiana after she was charged with violating the southern state\u2019s strict anti-abortion law.\n\u201cI will not be signing an extradition order that came from the governor of Louisiana,\u201d Hochul said at a news conference in Manhattan. \u201cNot now, not ever.\u201d\nShe also said she sent out a notice to law enforcement in New York that instructed them to not cooperate with out-of-state warrants for such charges.\nCarpenter is co-medical director and founder of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine. Julie Kay, the group\u2019s executive director, said the Texas ruling does not change shield laws and that \u201cpatients can access medication abortion from licensed providers no matter where they live.\u201d\nThe group also criticized Louisiana\u2019s efforts to extradite Carpenter.\nThe case against Carpenter in Louisiana appears to be the first instance of criminal charges against a doctor accused of prescribing abortion pills to another state.\nPills have become the most common method of abortion in the U.S. and are at the epicenter of political and legal fights over abortion access following the US Supreme Court\u2019s overturning of Roe v. Wade.\nBoth the Texas and Louisiana cases will test New York\u2019s so-called shield law, which gives legal protections to doctors who prescribe abortion medication to conservative states where abortions are banned or otherwise limited. Other Democratic-controlled states have similar \u201cshield laws.\u201d\nProsecutors in West Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, indicted Carpenter on charges that she violated the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban, which allows physicians convicted of performing abortions, including one with pills, to be sentenced up to 15 years in prison.\nLouisiana authorities said the girl who received the pills experienced a medical emergency and had to be transported to the hospital. The girl\u2019s mother was also charged and has turned herself in to police.\nIn a videotaped statement Thursday, Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry said, \u201cthere is only one right answer in this situation, and it is that that doctor must face extradition to Louisiana where she can stand trial and justice will be served.\u201d\nLandry\u2019s office did not immediately return an emailed request for comment sent after Hochul refused the extradition request.\nIn the Texas case, the state\u2019s Republican Attorney General Ken Paxton has said that the 20-year-old woman who received the pills ended up in a hospital with complications. It was only after that, the state said in its filing, that the man described as \u201cthe biological father of the unborn child\u201d learned of the pregnancy and the abortion."

      "text": "Texas has sued a New York doctor for prescribing abortion pills to a woman near Dallas, launching one of the first challenges in the US to shield laws that Democrat-controlled states passed to protect physicians after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed the lawsuit on Thursday in Collin County, and it was announced Friday.\nSuch prescriptions, made online and over the phone, are a key reason that the number of abortions has increased across the US even since state bans started taking effect. Most abortions in the US involve pills rather than procedures.\nMary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis, School of Law, said a challenge to shield laws, which blue states started adopting in 2023, has been anticipated.\nAnd it could have a chilling effect on prescriptions.\n\u201cWill doctors be more afraid to mail pills into Texas, even if they might be protected by shield laws because they don\u2019t know if they\u2019re protected by shield laws?\u201d she said in an interview Friday.\nThe lawsuit accuses New York Dr. Margaret Daley Carpenter of violating Texas law by providing the drugs to a Texas patient and seeks up to $250,000. No criminal charges are involved.\nTexas bars abortion at all stages of pregnancy and has been one of the most aggressive states at pushing back against abortion rights. It began enforcing a state law in 2021 \u2014 even before the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to state bans \u2014 that barred nearly all abortions by allowing citizens to sue anyone who provides an abortion or assists someone in obtaining one.\nPaxton said that the 20-year-old woman who received the pills \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol, which are typically used in medication abortions \u2014 ended up in a hospital with complications. It was only after that, the state said in its filing, that the man described as \u201cthe biological father of the unborn child\u201d learned of the pregnancy and the abortion.\n\u201cIn Texas, we treasure the health and lives of mothers and babies, and this is why out-of-state doctors may not illegally and dangerously prescribe abortion-inducing drugs to Texas residents,\u201d Paxton said in a statement.\nA phone message left for Carpenter was not immediately returned, nor was an email to the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, where she\u2019s co-medical director and founder.\nAnti-abortion advocates, who legally challenged the Biden administration\u2019s prescribing rules around mifepristone, have been readying provocative and unusual ways to further limit abortion pill access when President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year. They feel emboldened to challenge the pills\u2019 use and seek ways to restrict it under a conservative US Supreme Court buttressed by a Republican-controlled Congress and White House.\nEarlier this year, the US Supreme Court ruled that a group of anti-abortion doctors and their organizations lacked the legal standing to sue to try to have the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of mifepristone rescinded. But since then, the Republican state attorneys general from Idaho, Kansas and Missouri have sought to have some of the rules around the pills tightened \u2014 including to bar telemedicine prescriptions.\nAlso this year, Louisiana became the first state to reclassify the drugs as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d They can still be prescribed, but there are extra steps required to access them.\nLawmakers in at least three states have introduced bills for next year aimed at barring or restricting use of the pills.\n\u201cI began to think about how we might be able to both provide an additional deterrent to companies violating the criminal law and provide a remedy for the family of the unborn children,\u201d said Tennessee state Rep. Gino Bulso, who is sponsoring the legislation there that includes a provision barring use of the medications for abortion."

  "argos_summary": "Texas lawmakers approved a bill that lets private citizens sue abortion pill manufacturers, doctors, and anyone who mails the medication, with damages up to $100,000. The measure, set to take effect in December, is intended to enforce Texas\u2019s strict abortion ban and could serve as a model for other states. It is expected to trigger legal challenges from abortion\u2011rights advocates and may intensify the national debate over abortion\u2011pill access and shield laws.",
