  "title": "Nvidia Has Two New RTX Pro GPUs Ready to Go and They Could Be Great For Lower Power Systems",
  "description": "The compact Blackwell cards are small-form-factor friendly.",
  "content": "Nvidia isn\u2019t quite done with its RTX Pro Blackwell workstation line. The company has two low-power GPUs waiting in the wings, and although there isn\u2019t an official launch date yet, Nvidia indicated that they\u2019ll be out before the end of the year. Both GPUs have a Thermal Design Power (TDP) max of 70W, making them easily the most low-power RTX Pros in the series. For comparison, the next step up, which is the RTX Pro 4000, has a 140W TDP rating.\n\nThe two upcoming GPUs are the Nvidia RTX Pro 4000 SFF and the RTX Pro 2000, both of which have compact card designs. They are just 2.7\u201d high and 6.6\u201d long, though the RTX Pro 2000 has a full height bracket. Neither of these GPUs should go in a gaming PC, but as Videocardz points out, they could end up in a home theater PC or a home SFF workstation. They\u2019ll certainly find spots in workstations for business settings, as well.\n\nThe RTX Pro 4000 SFF GPU sports 20GB of GDDR6 memory with error correction code (ECC). That's 4GB less memory than on the full-sized RTX Pro 4000, and 12 GB less than the RTX 5090 (The Pro 4000 also has GDDR7 memory). But the SFF and full-sized versions both have the Nvidia Blackwell GB203 die and 8960 CUDA cores. At this point, the RTX Pro 4000 SFF is the only GPU in the series to run GDDR6 memory; the rest all run GDDR7.\n\nAs for the RTX Pro 2000, it has just 16GB of GDDR7 memory with ECC, at a 128-bit memory interface (to the RTX Pro 4000 SFF\u2019s 160-bit). It\u2019s understandably underpowered compared to its SFF cousin, at 545 AI TOPS to the SFF\u2019s 770 AI TOPS.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the compactness of the cards is only in their height; each of them eats up two bracket slots at the back of your workstation. Each card has a PCIe 5.0 x8 interface and neither have external power connectors, thanks to their low power requirements.\n\nPricing is still a question mark for both GPUs, but expect them to be pricier than consumer cards. At the top of the RTX Pro series sits the RTX Pro 6000 Workstation, which debuted above $8,000 and has stayed in that range. It\u2019s more powerful than Nvidia\u2019s consumer flagship, the RTX 5090, but it\u2019s not meant for gaming. Of course, that didn\u2019t stop an overclocker from putting one in his PC and pulling some eye-popping performance from it.\n\nBut with the RTX 5090 going for $2,400-$3,000, the RTX 5090 is a far better deal for gamers \u2013 and that might be the only time soon that we refer to the 5090\u2019s price as a deal.",
