  "content": "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued multiple recalls last week, including multiple notices for Ford and Lincoln vehicles.\n\nAre you looking to see if recalls were issued on your vehicle? Owners can check USA TODAY's automotive recall database or search NHTSA's database for new recalls. The NHTSA website also allows you to search for recalls based on your vehicle identification number, or VIN.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the vehicle recalls published by NHTSA from Aug. 25 to Aug. 31:\n\nFord Motor recalled certain 2016 to 2018 Lincoln MKX and 2015 to 2018 Ford Edge vehicles as they may have a rear brake hose that can rupture and leak fluid.\n\nThe cause of the rupture and leak has yet to be determined, according to the recall report. Drivers may notice a change in the feeling of the brake and see the brake fluid warning indicator light illuminate as a result of the leak.\n\nA remedy for the recall is under development. Letters notifying owners of affected vehicles about the safety risk are expected to be mailed Sept. 8, with a letter notifying owners of a remedy anticipated in April 2026.\n\nFord recalled certain trucks as they may have an instrument panel cluster that fails when the car starts.\n\nThe vehicles included in the recall are:\n\nThe failure of the panel is caused by a software issue while in sleep mode, according to the recall report. The instrument panel cluster software can be updated by a dealer or over-the-air, free of charge.\n\nOwner notification letters are to be sent Sept. 2.\n\nStellantis recalled certain 2019 to 2021 Ram ProMaster and 2019 to 2020 Dodge Journey vehicles as they could have a faulty rearview camera.\n\nCracks in the microprocessor of the camera could cause the vehicle's rearview camera image not to display properly, according to the NHTSA.\n\nDealers are to replace the rearview camera, free of charge. Letters notifying owners are expected to be sent Sept. 30.\n\nFord also recalled certain 2025 Explorer and Aviator vehicles, as the tail lights on towed trailers may not illuminate.\n\nThe affected vehicles have a body control module that may have improperly soldered components, according to the recall report. Cars covered under the recall that may have the affected module may experience inoperative power window or mirror switches, or the vehicle's air conditioning system blowing warm air.\n\nThe report suggests there could also be other operating issues with the vehicle's DC/AC inverter, glove box light, vanity lights, dome lamps, alarm portion of the horn, rear defrost, or the USB charger.\n\nDealers are to replace the body control module on vehicles with less than 9,000 miles driven. For vehicles with more than 9,000 miles, dealers are to perform a functional check on the body control module and replace it if necessary.\n\nAll repairs are to be made free of charge.\n\nLetters notifying owners of the safety risk are expected to be mailed Oct. 13, with a follow-up anticipated when a remedy is implemented.\n\nFord recalled certain 2024 to 2025 Mustang vehicles as exterior lights in affected vehicles may not illuminate.\n\nWater may enter the body control module of the affected Mustangs, causing a loss of communication with the exterior lighting, including the license plate light, side marker, and tail lights. The water intrusion may be caused by improperly sealed body seams, according to the recall report.\n\nDealers are to inspect and seal the body seams as well as inspect the body control module for corrosion and replace it, if necessary. Repairs are to be made free of charge.\n\nLetters notifying owners are to be sent Sept. 1 and followed by a notice that a remedy is available. The remedy is anticipated to be available in the first quarter of 2026.\n\nFord recalls Rangers for side airbags that could tear\n\nFord recalled certain 2024 to 2026 Ranger vehicles as the side curtain airbags in the affected vehicles may tear when deployed.\n\nThe airbags may contact the vehicle's B-Pillar inner reinforcements during deployment, causing them to tear. Dealers are to install protective shields for the airbags free of charge.\n\nOwner notification letters are to be sent on Sept. 8, with notices for a final remedy anticipated to be sent in December.\n\nGeneral Motors recalled certain 2023 to 2026 Chevrolet Corvettes due to a fire risk when refueling.\n\nThe affected vehicles are equipped with a left-side radiator/fan combination where excess fuel may spill into the vehicle fuel-filler pocket and leak onto an ignition source, according to the NHTSA.\n\nDealers will install a shield to divert spilled fuel for free, with owners expected to receive a letter when a final remedy is available. Letters notifying owners of the safety risk are to be sent Oct. 6.",

      "text": "Over 800,000 Ford and Lincoln vehicles recalled. See impacted models.\nFord has recalled over 800,000 vehicles due to issues with rear brakes, tail lights and air bag issues that could increase the risk of a crash.\nThe wave of recalls, which also include certain Lincoln vehicles, are part of three separate notices that Ford issued on Aug. 22 to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and were posted by the agency this week.\nThe recalls include vehicles such as the 2015 to 2018 Ford Edge, the 2016 to 2018 Lincoln MKX, the 2025 Ford Explorer, the 2025 Lincoln Aviator and the 2024 to 2026 Ford Ranger.\nOver 400,000 of the impacted vehicles are 2015 to 2018 Ford Edge SUVs, per the recall reports. Those vehicles have a rear brake hose that may rupture and leak brake fluid, and a brake fluid leak could increase the distance drivers need to stop their vehicles, increasing the risk of a crash, Ford said.\nFord said there have not been any reports of accidents or injuries due to any of these issues.\nHere\u2019s a breakdown of what\u2019s included in each recall, and what Ford and Lincoln are doing to fix the issues.\nFord Edge and Lincoln MKX recalled due to brake fluid issue, Ford says\nThe biggest recall is NHTSA recall no. 25V544000 or Ford recall no. 25S87, which impacts 499,129 vehicles. The brake fluid recall includes certain vehicles in the following models and years:\n- 2015 to 2018 Ford Edge \u2013 414,717 vehicles\n- 2016 to 2018 Lincoln MKX \u2013 84,412 vehicles\nThe recalled vehicles, which were manufactured between June 2014 and December 2017, were made with rear brake hoses that can cause a brake fluid leak. Ford added that drivers may need more time or distance to stop their vehicles, increasing the chances of them crashing.\nFord said the company does not know the cause of the brake hose leak, but staff haven\u2019t had to fix as many of them since changing the material used to make the hoses in December 2017.\nThe company is working on its remedy for the issue, and will let owners know by mail when they can take their vehicles to a Ford or Lincoln dealer to have the issue fixed for free. Ford began notifying dealers on Aug. 25, and will notify drivers via mail between Sept. 8 and Sept. 12. Customers should get word of a fix for the issue between April 1, 2026 and April 3, 2026.\nTail lights on Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator may stop working when towing trailers, increasing crash risk, Ford says\nA total of 213,121 vehicles are impacted by NHTSA recall no. 25V543000 or Ford recall no. 25C42. The tail light recall includes certain vehicles in the following models and years:\n- 2025 Ford Explorer \u2013 189,879 vehicles\n- 2025 Lincoln Aviator \u2013 23,242 vehicles\nThe vehicles were manufactured between November 2023 and June 2025, Ford said. According to Ford, when drivers are connected to trailers and towing them, the tail lights don\u2019t light up as they should. This makes it harder for other drivers to see the vehicles, increasing the likelihood of a crash.\nThe vehicles were made with a faulty body control module, so dealers will repair the vehicles for free in two groups.\nFor vehicles with less than 9,000 miles, dealers will replace the body control module. For vehicles with over 9,000 miles, dealers conduct a functional check on the body control module and replace it if needed.\nFord plans to mail owners letters of notification by Oct. 13. The company expects to mail more letters letting drivers know when the final fix is available, likely in April 2026.\nFord Ranger airbags may not deploy, car manufacturer says\nAnother recall includes 100,900 Ford Ranger pickup trucks in model years 2024 to 2026 (NHTSA recall no. 25V541000 or Ford recall no. 25C41).\nThe side curtain air bags in the trucks may not deploy properly during a crash, increasing the risk of drivers getting injured, the company said.\nOnce the fix is available, owners can take their vehicles for free to a Ford or Lincoln dealer, where staff will install a protective shield between the side curtain air bag and the inner sheet metal for the right and left side air curtains.\nFord began letting dealers know about the issue on Aug. 25, and should be done by Aug. 29. Owners will be notified between Sept. 8 and Sept. 12. The company expects to mail letters to owners about the remedy between Dec. 19 and Dec. 27.\nOwners can contact Ford customer service at 1-866-436-7332.\nSaleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

In a similar vein, the K5\u2019s recall is from a fault in the car's left and right rear window trim pieces that could become loose and fall off.\nOwners of impacted vehicles are expected to be mailed by Sept. 26, according to the recalls.

Kia changed the procedures for the inspection on May 7, 2025, the notice says.\nThe purpose of this audit, the agency said, is to \"evaluate the effectiveness of Kia\u2019s remedy program and to understand Kia\u2019s response to vehicle owners\u2019 complaints of difficulties experienced due to changes to the procedures used to remedy vehicles.\"\nWhich Kia models were impacted by the recall?\nTwo Kia models affected by the recall, which involved 137,256 vehicles:\n- 2021-2023 Kia Seltos (53,635)\n- 2021-2023 Kia Soul (83,621)\n\"Kia carefully monitors the quality and safety performance of its vehicles, including the effectiveness of its recall remedies which is the subject of the (audit),\" Kia said in a statement provided to USA TODAY.\nThis story has been updated with new information.\nMike Snider is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.
