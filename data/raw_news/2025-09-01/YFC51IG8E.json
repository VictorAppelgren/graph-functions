  "title": "5 Disney+ Movies You Should Stream This Week (September 1 - 7)",
  "description": "Disney's streaming service has some great movies waiting for you.",
  "content": "Are you looking to watch some interesting movies in your free time this week? If so, I highly recommend these five Disney+ movies.\n\nWhether you favor superheroes, animation, or live-action drama, Disney's streaming service has plenty to keep you entertained.\n\nI'm really a fan of Wes Anderson movies, particularly Fantastic Mr. Fox, which was released back in 2009. If you're the same, I highly recommend giving Isle of Dogs a try, especially if you are a dog lover like me. The story revolves around Atari Kobayashi and his struggle to find his dog, Spots Kobayashi, on an island called the Isle of Dogs.\n\nSpots, along with all the other dogs of the fictional Japanese city Megasaki, were banished to the island after an outbreak of canine flu in the city. You will find a lot of dry humor throughout the movie. There were plenty of scenes where Anderson could have made us cry, but instead of doing that, he uses humor to make us think about our choices. There are plenty of scenes, like in the beginning, where two groups of dogs have a conversation about food, when I was confused about whether I should be laughing or crying.\n\nI also really liked the story of Chief, the stray dog in the movie. My eyes filled with tears when I saw him eat dog food for the first time. Above all, the most interesting aspect of the movie is that all the Japanese characters speak in Japanese. You won\u2019t find subtitles for what they are saying. Instead, there is a third character in the movie who translates everything. This is a very bold choice by the director, and it works really well.\n\nIf you are someone who decides whether to watch a movie by looking at its IMDb rating or the number of awards it has won, then Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is not going to disappoint you. The movie has an IMDb rating of 8.1 and was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning two of them in the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actor categories.\n\nThe story is about Mildred Hayes, played by Frances McDormand, who is frustrated with the police department\u2019s inability to catch the culprit responsible for the death of her daughter. In frustration, she puts up three billboards near her home containing messages that directly question the police department. Contrary to what Mildred expected, most of the town\u2019s residents, even those who initially supported her, began to hate her. You need to watch the movie to find out why.\n\nAt first, you will find the movie to be a simple story about a victim's family trying to get justice. But you will slowly realize that the movie is completely different from what you expected, and Mildred's story is just a part of what the director wants to convey.\n\nThere are plenty of emotional scenes as well. For instance, the one where Red gives orange juice to Police Officer Dixon in the hospital, which I found very moving. Overall, it's a great movie to watch with your friends and family, and I bet you will be surprised by the ending.\n\nThe year 2017 saw the release of some of the best Hollywood movies of all time, including films like Dunkirk, Baby Driver, and many more. However, if I had to pick one of my favorite movies released that year, it would definitely be Logan. The movie is a must-watch for everyone who loves action sequences and graphic violence in films.\n\nThe movie's story is set in 2029, where only a handful of X-Men members are alive, including Logan and X-Men founder Charles Xavier. In the movie, Logan fights against a biotechnology corporation, Alkali-Transigen, to save a young girl named Laura. While each actor gave an excellent performance, I was especially impressed by Hugh Jackman.\n\nJust before watching Logan, I watched The Greatest Showman, which came out in the same year and has Hugh Jackman portraying a young man. Watching him in Logan as an older character was really mind-blowing. His acting is so good that it makes both characters entirely believable.\n\nAlso, if you are wondering whether you need to know about X-Men history before watching Logan, the answer is no, but you will probably be inspired to watch some X-Men movies when you're finished.\n\nAfter watching Logan, if you wish to see more of Hugh Jackman using his Wolverine claws, then I would highly recommend watching Deadpool & Wolverine. Similar to most Marvel movies, Deadpool & Wolverine is full of action sequences and comedy.\n\nI remember watching the movie for the first time in the theater, and everyone laughing their hearts out after watching the different ways the different versions of Deadpool were getting killed in the movie. Also, if you are a fan of Marvel movies, you're bound to get a kick out of all the references.\n\nCan you watch Deadpool & Wolverine without having prior knowledge of the title characters? The answer is mixed, unfortunately. The movie gives a brief summary of Wolverine\u2019s past, but the same can't be said about Deadpool. So, I would at least recommend going through a Deadpool series explanation video on YouTube before watching Deadpool & Wolverine if you want to better understand the movie.\n\nIf you are looking to watch a lighthearted comedy movie this week, then Zootopia is a great choice. The movie revolves around the first rabbit police officer of Zootopia, Judy Hopps. She is a hard-working police officer who just wants to prove herself in her department. To do so, she decides to solve a mysterious case and works alongside Nick Wilde, who is a red fox.\n\nThe banter between Nick and Judy is really fun, and there are plenty of hilarious scenes\u2014my favorite being one between Flash the sloth and Judy (I'm sure you'll agree with me after watching the movie).\n\nThe animation is great and the colors are vibrant. You will also find references to different movies and series like Breaking Bad. Overall, it's a fun watch and surprisingly suspenseful. I'm eagerly awaiting the sequel due later this year.\n\nThese are some of the best movies to watch on Disney+ this week. There are also lots of great shows on Disney+, so there's plenty to keep you entertained.",

      "text": "If you want to see original shows in the worlds of Star Wars, Marvel, and Pixar, then Disney+ is the streaming service for you\u2014though that's not to say Disney+ doesn't go beyond those big-name brands.\nIf you're trying to decide what you should watch next, consider one of these great shows that are only available to stream on Disney+.\nIn the United States, many of the original shows available on Disney+ internationally stream on Hulu instead. This list excludes those and only covers shows available worldwide on Disney+.\n10 The Muppets Mayhem\n|\nRelease Year |\n2023 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n1 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n10 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nThe Muppets are iconic, but they haven't always had the easiest ride on TV. That also applies to The Muppets Mayhem, which was canceled after one season, but it's still worth watching if you're a fan of the colorful puppets.\nThe funny show revolves around Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem (no Kermit or Miss Piggy here) as they record their first studio album, battling the chaos of the music industry and themselves. There are, of course, celebrity cameos aplenty!\n9 Win or Lose\n|\nRelease Year |\n2025 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n1 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n8 |\n|\nStatus |\nUnconfirmed |\nWin or Lose is a Pixar-created show about a middle school softball team with a championship game on the horizon. Each episode follows a different character (like umpire Frank, coach Dan, and pitcher Yuwen) in the build-up, told with stylish animation and trademark Pixar emotion.\nIf you finish this and want more animated goodness, you will likely also enjoy Cars on the Road and Monsters at Work, both featuring recognizable Pixar characters.\nThe 10 Best Animated Movies on Disney+\nDisney+ is full of animated classics, including these 10 great movies you can watch right now.\n8 Loki\n|\nRelease Year |\n2021 - 2023 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n2 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n12 |\n|\nStatus |\nUnconfirmed |\nIf you've managed to keep up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you'll know that Loki is a fan-favorite character despite his evil deeds, in no small part thanks to Tom Hiddleston's excellent portrayal. It makes sense, then, that the God of Mischief has his own show.\nLoki does well to evolve the titular star\u2014or a variant of him, at least. The show explores the idea of multiple timelines overseen by a group called the Time Variance Authority, who give Loki a mission to hunt down a dangerous version of himself.\n7 The Beatles: Get Back\n|\nRelease Year |\n2021 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n1 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n3 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded (limited series) |\nThere has been so much said about The Beatles, one of the world's most influential bands, that it's hard to imagine there's anything left to say. Enter The Beatles: Get Back, a three-party documentary from director Peter Jackson, that uses never-before-seen archive footage to pull back the curtain on the group.\nWhile it certainly helps if you like The Beatles' music, it's not a requirement to appreciate this documentary, which is an interesting insight into the dynamics of a band and the creation of their songs.\n6 Renegade Nell\n|\nRelease Year |\n2024 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n1 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n8 |\n|\nStatus |\nEnded |\nRenegade Nell is a fun and underappreciated Disney+ show that only lasted one season. Set in 1705's England, it stars Louisa Harland as Nell Jackson, a highwaywoman with magical super strength.\nThe show is a neat blend of fantasy, action, and adventure, and while it's not afraid to tug at your heartstrings, it also doesn't take itself too seriously.\n7 Ways to Get Your Money's Worth Out of Disney+\nMake the most of your subscription to the House of Mouse.\n5 Skeleton Crew\n|\nRelease Year |\n2024 - 2025 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n1 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n8 |\n|\nStatus |\nUnconfirmed |\nSkeleton Crew is a coming-of-age tale in the Star Wars universe, about four children from a mysterious planet who find themselves caught up in a pirate's hunt for treasure. It's every bit as swashbuckling and delightful as it sounds.\nSkeleton Crew is inspired by Amblin movies like The Goonies, so although the lead cast are kids (alongside Jude Law), it can be enjoyed by all ages.\n4 Hawkeye\n|\nRelease Year |\n2021 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n1 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n6 |\n|\nStatus |\nUnconfirmed |\nHawkeye (Jeremy Renner) isn't the most interesting character in the Marvel movies, since he's really just a man with a bow and arrow, which is why it makes the success of the Hawkeye TV show even more impressive.\nThe show smartly pairs him with the young and feisty Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), as the two work together to battle against a criminal conspiracy. Plus, it's charmingly set at Christmas!\n3 The Mandalorian\n|\nRelease Year |\n2019 - 2023 |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n3 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n24 |\n|\nStatus |\nUnconfirmed |\nIf you appreciate the Western influences in Star Wars, you're sure to love how heavily spin-off The Mandalorian leans into the genre. The show charts the journey of a bounty hunter tasked with looking after a creature called Grogu\u2014or, as he famously became known, Baby Yoda.\nThe Mandalorian is thrilling and stylish (especially the costumes and music), making use of Star Wars lore while forging its own path.\n2 X-Men '97\n|\nRelease Year |\n2024 - present |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n1 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n10 |\n|\nStatus |\nOngoing |\nX-Men: The Animated Series originally broadcast from 1992 to 1997 and was a hit, so the news the show was being revived for Disney+ caused trepidation among fans. There was no need to worry, though, as X-Men '97 is every bit as good as the original.\nIt's hard to pick a specific standout element. The voice acting, storytelling, and animation all work together to create a thoroughly fantastic show about superpowered mutants.\n1 Andor\n|\nRelease Year |\n2022 - present |\n|---|---|\n|\nSeasons |\n1 |\n|\nEpisodes |\n12 |\n|\nStatus |\nOngoing |\nIt's another Star Wars show, and a prequel to the film Rogue One, but you don't need to be a fan of the series to appreciate the mature and gripping storytelling of Andor. It mixes politics, drama, and good old-fashioned sci-fi in its story of a rebellion.\nThe first season was stupendous, so fingers crossed that the upcoming second and final season sticks the landing.\nWhile there are changes I'd like Disney+ to make, there's no denying that there are plenty of great shows to keep you entertained. If you're not already signed up, consider a month's subscription and see how many you can watch.\nAll of these shows are available to stream on Disney+, along with a plentiful back catalogue of shows and movies from the Disney vault."

      "text": "Read update\n- We've reviewed our guide and updated some dead links.\nQuick Links\nBeginning with 2008's Iron Man, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has expanded to become the dominant force in modern blockbuster filmmaking and the definitive comic-book movie franchise. If you're looking for superhero action, here are the best MCU movies to stream.\nUPDATE: 5/30/23\nWe've reviewed our guide and updated some dead links.\nAnt-Man\nDirector Peyton Reed helms an appealingly scaled back---both literally and cinematically---MCU adventure in Ant-Man. Small-time crook Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) steals an experimental piece of technology that allows him to shrink in size.\nHe teams up with the suit's inventor (Michael Douglas) to take down a rival scientist (Corey Stoll) with criminal intentions. Reed combines the excitement of a heist movie with Rudd's self-deprecating humor, and some delightfully creative takes on tiny things appearing massive.\nAnt-Man is streaming on Disney+ ($7.99 per month with ads and $10.99 per month or $109.99 per year without ads).\nThe Avengers\nIt may be hard to believe now, but when Marvel released The Avengers in 2012, the idea of a major movie crossover like this was pretty unheard-of. It's still thrilling to see Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, and the Hulk come together following their respective movie debuts, teaming up with Hawkeye, Black Widow, and the Scarlet Witch to save Earth from an alien invasion.\nCrossovers are now commonplace in MCU movies and elsewhere, but the movie that kicked off the trend remains a blockbuster milestone.\nThe Avengers is streaming on Disney+ ($7.99 per month with ads and $10.99 per month or $109.99 per year without ads).\nBlack Panther\nThe late Chadwick Boseman brings a regal presence to the title character in Black Panther. That's appropriate, since he's playing T'Challa, king of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. Imbued with powers passed down from his ancestors, T'Challa must protect his homeland from outside forces while also battling the terrorist known as Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan).\nDirector and co-writer Ryan Coogler creates a vibrant world in Wakanda, and Jordan plays one of the MCU's most nuanced and sympathetic villains.\nBlack Panther is streaming on Disney+ ($7.99 per month with ads and $10.99 per month or $109.99 per year without ads).\nBlack Widow\nAfter appearing in supporting roles in various MCU movies for a decade, Scarlett Johansson's super-spy Natasha Romanoff finally gets a solo spotlight in Black Widow. Set between two of her major team-up adventures, the movie follows Natasha as she reunites with her surrogate family of Russian secret agents and brings down the cruel government program that trained her to be a killer.\nIt's a globe-trotting espionage thriller with superhero elements, providing a worthy send-off for an underappreciated MCU character.\nBlack Widow is streaming on Disney+ ($7.99 per month with ads and $10.99 per month or $109.99 per year without ads).\nCaptain America: The First Avenger\nCaptain America: The First Avenger effectively sets itself apart from the rest of the MCU thanks to its 1940s time period. Chris Evans debuts as the patriotic superhero, who transforms from a scrawny kid into a super-strong soldier thanks to a secret government experiment.\nDirector Joe Johnston evokes wartime culture via kitschy ads and stage performances, while also delivering plenty of superhero action, plus a love story for the title character and British agent Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell).\nCaptain America: The First Avenger is streaming on Disney+ ($7.99 per month with ads and $10.99 per month or $109.99 per year without ads).\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier\nIn his second movie, Captain America is firmly established in the present day, a member of the Avengers and the world's most admired and prominent superhero. Future Marvel mainstays the Russo brothers make their MCU debut directing this suspenseful, twist-filled action movie that borrows from vintage conspiracy thrillers.\nCaptain America faces the resurgence of the terrorist organization Hydra and a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier, who has ties to his past.\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier is streaming on Disney+ ($7.99 per month with ads and $10.99 per month or $109.99 per year without ads) and Starz ($8.99 per month).\nWatch on Disney+Watch on Starz\nDoctor Strange\nMarvel's Master of the Mystic Arts opens the door for some horror-movie elements in Doctor Strange. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the title character, an arrogant surgeon who studies the ancient ways of magic after being injured in a car accident.\nHe uses his newfound skills to defend Earth from the demon Dormammu, cleverly channeling some of that arrogance into a creative strategy. Director Scott Derrickson delves into the realms of the supernatural without deviating too far from the superhero template.\nDoctor Strange is streaming on Disney+ ($7.99 per month with ads and $10.99 per month or $109.99 per year without ads).\nGuardians of the Galaxy\nFilmmaker James Gunn brings his off-kilter sensibility to the MCU with Guardians of the Galaxy. Gunn takes a set of obscure Marvel characters and turns them into superstars with this hilarious, fast-paced, music-filled outer-space adventure.\nChris Pratt leads the cast as intergalactic rogue Peter Quill, who gathers a team of outlaws to help him protect a mysterious orb from the villainous Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace). By sticking to his personal vision, Gunn expands the MCU both cosmically and stylistically.\nGuardians of the Galaxy is streaming on Disney+ ($7.99 per month with ads and $10.99 per month or $109.99 per year without ads) and Starz ($8.99 per month).\nWatch on Disney+Watch on Starz\nSpider-Man: Homecoming\nPrevious Spider-Man movies had not been part of the MCU, but with Spider-Man: Homecoming, the web-slinger joins his fellow Marvel heroes. Tom Holland takes over the role of awkward teenager Peter Parker, who gains spider-like powers and patrols his New York City neighborhood.\nAlthough he's already fought alongside the Avengers, here Peter takes on a foe closer to home, the villainous Vulture (Michael Keaton). The movie smartly integrates Spider-Man into the MCU while keeping his grounded, street-level appeal.\nSpider-Man: Homecoming is streaming on Disney+ ($7.99 per month with ads and $10.99 per month or $109.99 per year without ads).\nThor: Ragnarok\nThe first two movies featuring Norse thunder god Thor (Chris Hemsworth) were weak spots in the MCU, but director Taika Waititi successfully switches gears for the character with Thor: Ragnarok. Waititi plays up the humor, taking Thor out of his element in the realm of Asgard and stranding him on a planet where he's forced into gladiatorial combat.\nCate Blanchett plays the villain threatening Asgard, but the real excitement comes from Thor's goofy, colorful interactions with the aliens he fights alongside.\nThor: Ragnarok is streaming on Disney+ ($7.99 per month with ads and $10.99 per month or $109.99 per year without ads)."
