According to the research firm, the financial results were inconsequential as the IPO had generated significant investor interest.\n\nSimilarly, Bernstein SocGen Group expects third-quarter results to have a significant impact on the stock\u2019s sentiment, given that significant Ethereum price movements and USDC stablecoin growth during Q3 will be key metrics to watch. The firm has also echoed Circle Internet Group\u2019s push to win big in the digital asset space, as it addresses near-term challenges.\n\nCircle Internet Group (NYSE:CRCL) is a financial technology firm that focuses on enabling businesses to utilize digital currencies and public blockchain\u2019s for payments, commerce, and financial applications.

      "text": "In this article, we will look at the 12 Best Consumer Goods Stocks Billionaires Are Quietly Buying.\nUS stocks are doing exceedingly well, shrugging off threats from tariffs and tax policies. That\u2019s the sentiment echoed by analysts at Barclays, who insist the markets are poised to stop constantly responding to President Trump\u2019s tariff policy and the \u201cOne Big Beautiful\u201d tax bill.\nInstead, Barclays analysts expect investor\u2019s sentiments in the equity market to shift to macro-economic data and the role of artificial intelligence in driving growth.\n\u201cIn our view, financial markets will increasingly tune out tariff and tax headlines coming from Washington, DC,\u201d said Ajay Rajadhyaksha, the bank\u2019s global chairman of research. \u201cThe focus should turn instead to macro data and the extent to which the AI dividend will boost corporate earnings, especially for large tech firms.\u201d\nThe remarks come as the labor market has remained resilient and inflationary pressures subsided, consequently offering support to consumer\u2019s purchasing power. Similarly, the outlook for consumer goods companies has improved, as Barclays analysts expect the US to avoid a recession.\nAmidst concerns over tariffs and interest rates, Rajadhyaksha expects the world economy to weather the current uncertainty triggered by the trade war unscathed. Sharing similar sentiments is HSBC strategist Max Kettner, who insists that investors are not bullish enough, even though the overall US market is expected to bounce back significantly.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s look at the 12 Best Consumer Goods Stocks Billionaires Are Quietly Buying.\nOur Methodology\nTo create the list of the 12 Best Consumer Goods Stocks Billionaires Are Quietly Buying, we analyzed the U.S. equity markets with a focus on consumer goods companies. From this pool, we shortlisted stocks that had positive returns over the past year and were held by the billionaire investors, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s proprietary database. Finally, we ranked the selected stocks in ascending order by the number of billionaire holders.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nBest Consumer Goods Stocks Billionaires Are Quietly Buying\n12. Kenvue Inc. (NYSE:KVUE)\nOne-year Return as of July 3: 14.96%\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 7\nKenvue Inc. (NYSE:KVUE) is one of the 12 best consumer goods stocks billionaires are quietly buying. On June 24, the company confirmed the departure of Asia Pacific president Ellie Bing Xie, effective July 14. However, he will remain with the company through August 8, 2025, to assist in the transition.\nThe company has already appointed Anindya (Andy) Dasgupta to take over as the Group President of Asia Pacific, effective July 14, 2025. He joins the company as a 30-year global consumer products industry veteran. The Asia Pacific Group contributed about $3 billion in net sales for Kenvue in 2024.\nDasgupta joins the company with vast experience in health, nutrition, and food and beverage sectors across emerging and developed markets. He also brings extensive experience in commercial strategy, sales, marketing, and business development.\nKenvue Inc.

(NASDAQ:MAT)\nOne-year Return as of July 3: 25.82%\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 10\nMattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT) is one of the 12 best consumer goods stocks billionaires are quietly buying. On June 16, UBS maintained its Buy rating and $29 price target for Mattel Inc. following a meeting with the company\u2019s new CFO, Paul Ruh. The firm praised Ruh\u2019s strong background in consumer packaged goods, especially in areas like cost control and financial discipline. However, it noted his limited exposure to intellectual property-driven businesses like toys.\nUBS expressed confidence in Mattel\u2019s continued strategic direction, citing Ruh\u2019s steady approach to capital allocation and cost management. The company\u2019s guidance practices will remain unchanged, sticking to annual forecasts. Ruh\u2019s prior experience with IPOs and corporate turnarounds was highlighted as a valuable asset for navigating Mattel\u2019s evolving landscape.\nMattel, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAT) is a leading consumer goods company operating globally, known for designing, manufacturing, and marketing iconic toys and entertainment products under brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, Fisher-Price, American Girl, and more.

(NASDAQ:KDP) is one of the 12 best consumer goods stocks billionaires are quietly buying. On June 30, Piper Sandler reiterated an \u2018Overweight\u2019 rating and $40 price target.

It anticipates growth contribution from Ghost in Q2 as it completes full distribution through the KDP network.\nPiper Sandler also expects the company to deliver earnings per share of $2.06 in 2025 and $2.17 in 2026, driven by strong demand for coffee pods. In addition, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to launch a new product dubbed Bloom Pop in the modern soda segment as part of its expansion strategy.\nKeurig Dr Pepper Inc. (NASDAQ:KDP) is a leading beverage company in North America, with a diverse portfolio of over 125 owned, licensed, and partner brands. It produces and sells a wide variety of beverages, including coffee, tea, juice, water, and carbonated soft drinks."

      "text": "There\u2019s a once-in-a-generation convergence happening right now. Three unstoppable megatrends are reshaping the global economy\u2014and one under-the-radar stock is perfectly positioned to profit from all of them.\nThis isn\u2019t a flashy AI stock or a speculative play. It\u2019s the infrastructure backbone of the future\u2014and it\u2019s trading at a bargain.\nLet me explain.\nTrend #1: The AI Arms Race\nArtificial intelligence is the most transformational force since the steam engine\u2014and it\u2019s just getting started.\nBut behind every ChatGPT prompt and robotic breakthrough is something few investors are thinking about:\nPower. Lots of it.\nWall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence\u2014training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there\u2019s one urgent question few are asking:\nWhere will all of that energy come from?\nEven Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning: \u201cAI depends on an energy breakthrough.\u201d\nElon Musk was even more blunt:\n\u201cAI will run out of electricity by next year.\u201d\nAs the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.\nAnd that\u2019s where the real opportunity lies\u2026\nOne little-known company\u2014almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors\u2014could be the ultimate backdoor play. It\u2019s not a chipmaker. It\u2019s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US.\nAs demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.\nThe \u201cToll Booth\u201d Operator of the AI Energy Boom\n- It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America\u2019s next-generation power strategy.\n- It\u2019s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.\n- It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation\u2014a sector about to explode under President Trump\u2019s renewed \u201cAmerica First\u201d energy doctrine.\nWhile investors pile into chip stocks with sky-high valuations, this company is quietly supplying the electricity that makes AI possible. No matter who wins the AI race\u2014Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta\u2014this company gets paid.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #2: Trump\u2019s Tariff Strategy Could Trigger a U.S. LNG Export Boom\nDonald Trump has made one thing clear: he\u2019s coming back to renegotiate global trade\u2014on America\u2019s terms.\nHis top priority? Narrowing the U.S. trade deficit. And this time, he\u2019s not just targeting Chinese imports\u2014he\u2019s taking aim at every trade partner who\u2019s been running a surplus at America\u2019s expense.\nTrump\u2019s team is already working behind the scenes to revise trade deals with Japan, Europe, and South Korea. And while the media focuses on tariffs and quotas, savvy investors are watching where the real money will flow:\nInto American LNG.\nHere\u2019s why: The U.S. is sitting on a massive glut of natural gas\u2014thanks to the shale boom. Domestic prices are near historic lows, while Europe and parts of Asia are paying 3\u20135x more for the same fuel. It\u2019s the perfect imbalance.\nAnd Trump knows it.\nThat\u2019s why he\u2019s pressuring our trading partners to buy American energy as part of future trade agreements. It\u2019s a simple way to cut the trade deficit without slapping tariffs on U.S. consumers.\nThat sets the stage for a massive wave of U.S. LNG exports, backed by political momentum and international demand.\nNow here\u2019s where our stock comes in\u2026\nOur stock is a tollbooth operator in this booming sector. This company builds the infrastructure that makes LNG exports possible\u2014the pipelines, terminals, and systems that physically move U.S. gas to global buyers.\nIf Trump succeeds in tying LNG purchases to trade deals\u2014and all signs suggest he will\u2014this company will be printing money on every contract signed. The more the world buys American gas, the more this company earns.\nAnd this isn\u2019t some hypothetical \u201cif.\u201d The groundwork is already being laid:\n- Europe is scrambling to replace Russian gas permanently.\n- Japan is actively sourcing non-Chinese, non-Russian LNG.\n- India and South Korea are deepening energy ties with the U.S.\n- New terminals are being planned and permitted in anticipation of the coming surge.\nTrump\u2019s tariff threats may dominate the headlines\u2014but his behind-the-scenes LNG diplomacy could be the real financial windfall for U.S. energy companies.\nAnd our pick is sitting in the perfect spot to benefit.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nTrend #3: The Great Onshoring Boom\u2014And the $9 Billion Clue in Indiana\nFor decades, America offshored its industrial base. Now, that trend is reversing\u2014and fast.\nFrom semiconductors to pharmaceuticals, manufacturing is coming back to U.S. soil. Rising geopolitical tensions, Trump-era tariffs, and global supply chain shocks have forced companies to rethink their entire operating models. The result? A tidal wave of onshoring\u2014and our stock is riding it like a pro.\nJust look at what\u2019s happening in Lebanon, Indiana.\nPharma giant Eli Lilly is investing $9 billion into two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities at the LEAP Lebanon Innovation and Research District. This is one of the largest life sciences manufacturing investments in U.S. history\u2014and it\u2019s not a one-off.\nOur company\u2014a global leader in engineering, procurement, and construction management (EPCM)\u2014has already been awarded a $3.2 billion contract for this project. That\u2019s not a preliminary deal. This is full notice to proceed. Shovels are in the ground. Steel is going up. Money is already flowing.\nAnd this is just the beginning.\nThe Lilly project is a bellwether for what\u2019s coming: dozens of similar large-scale facilities across the country, spanning sectors from biotech to clean energy to advanced manufacturing. Each one will require complex infrastructure, deep engineering know-how, and flawless execution.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our company delivers.\nThis isn\u2019t speculative future revenue. This is high-margin, long-duration, politically supported work\u2014backed by blue-chip clients and megatrends. And as more companies race to bring operations home, our stock is in the pole position to win contract after contract.\nn fact, you can think of it this way:\nWherever America rebuilds its industrial backbone, this company gets paid.\nIt\u2019s not just an AI play. It\u2019s not just an energy play. It\u2019s also the ultimate onshoring pick-and-shovel stock\u2014a contractor to the next American manufacturing supercycle.\nAnd while Wall Street focuses on headlines, smart investors are loading up on the company quietly collecting billion-dollar checks behind the scenes.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nBuilt for the Future: Zero Debt, Cash to Deploy, and AI in Its Sights\nWhile most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders\u2026\nThis company is completely debt-free.\nIn fact, it\u2019s sitting on a war chest of cash\u2014equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.\nIt also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.\nAnd here\u2019s what the smart money has started whispering\u2026\nThe Hedge Fund Secret That\u2019s Starting to Leak Out\nThis stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.\nThey\u2019re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.\nWhy? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.\nAnd that\u2019s for a business tied to:\n- The AI infrastructure supercycle\n- The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs\n- A surge in U.S. LNG exports\n- And a unique footprint in nuclear energy\u2014the future of clean, reliable power\nYou simply won\u2019t find another AI and energy stock this cheap\u2026 with this much upside.\nThis isn\u2019t a hype stock. It\u2019s not riding on hope.\nIt\u2019s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.\nThis is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!\nThe Reveal: Our Top Short-Term Stock Pick for 2025\nThis is the moment when most newsletters put up a paywall and ask you to spend $99.99 to find out the name of the stock.\nBut we\u2019re not doing that today.\n>>>> SEE ALSO MY #1 AI STOCK PICK with 10,000% UPSIDE POTENTIAL <<<<<<\nAt Insider Monkey, we believe in earning your trust first\u2014by delivering real value, upfront.

      "text": "In this article, we will look at the Goldman Sachs Penny Stocks: Top 12 Stock Picks.\nIn a June 24, 2025, podcast, Goldman Sachs\u2019 Christian Mueller-Glissmann and Alexandra Wilson-Elizondo examined the dynamics driving markets. They also discussed the investment strategies that could work in the second half of 2025. There were many insightful takeaways, but one stood out: they noted that diversification paid off in the first half of 2025, especially away from mega-cap stocks.\nA few days later, Goldman Sachs released a report that highlighted a surge in penny stock activity. A particular day stands out in the report\u2019s analysis. It says that on June 12, penny stocks priced under $1 accounted for 47% of total U.S. equity trading volume. Overall, daily volume in this category of equities has increased threefold since 2021.\nHowever, some market analysts caution that this heightened activity is a warning sign. Cetera Investment Management\u2019s Gene Goldman, for instance, warns that elevated penny stock activity is a \u201csign of a market top when investors are buying first and asking questions later.\u201d\nOthers insist that penny stocks have been vilified over the years, but this time is different. For example, a Bespoke Investment Group analysis found that penny stocks are outperforming well-established companies. Their data shows that of the 14 stocks in the Russell 3000 that surged more than 200% since the S&P 500\u2019s April 8 low, 10 were penny stocks. In other words, big names may rule the headlines, but many of the market\u2019s future stars begin as under-the-radar underdogs.\nOur Methodology\nTo identify Goldman Sachs\u2019 top 12 penny stock picks, we analyzed the investment bank\u2019s equity holdings as of the first quarter of 2025. We focused on companies trading under $5 per share and also examined the popularity of these stocks among hedge funds. The list is presented in ascending order of Goldman\u2019s stake in the companies.\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 373.4% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 218 percentage points (see more details here).\nGoldman Sachs Penny Stocks: Top Stock Picks\n12. VinFast Auto Ltd. (NASDAQ:VFS)\nGoldman Sachs\u2019s Q1 2025 Stake: $428,158\nShare Price as of July 3: $3.64\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2025: 8\nVinFast Auto Ltd. (NASDAQ:VFS) is one of Goldman Sachs\u2019 top penny stock picks. On June 29, VinFast began production at its second factory in Ha Tinh, Vietnam, aiming to boost the output of its mini EVs. The new plant has an annual capacity of 200,000 units and complements its main Haiphong factory, which aims to reach 950,000 units by 2026.\nDespite ambitious plans to expand globally with new factories in the U.S., India, and Indonesia, VinFast has faced challenges such as lower demand and intense competition. Its U.S. plant has been delayed until 2028, while the India facility is set to begin operations next month.\nVinFast aims to deliver 200,000 vehicles in 2025 and sold 56,000 units in the first five months of this year. In Q1, it reported a net loss of $712.4 million\u2014an improvement from the prior quarter\u2014but still 20% higher than last year. Revenue surged 150% year-over-year to $656.5 million.\nVinFast Auto Ltd. (NASDAQ:VFS), a subsidiary of Vingroup, designs and manufactures electric vehicles, e-scooters, and e-buses across Vietnam, Canada, and the U.S. It operates through three main segments: Cars, E-scooters, and E-buses, offering a wide range of EVs including SUVs, compact EVs, pickup trucks, MPVs, e-bikes, and related battery services. The company is headquartered in Hai Phong City, Vietnam.\n11. Altimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT)\nGoldman Sachs\u2019s Q1 2025 Stake: $1,952,000\nShare Price as of July 3: $4.90\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2025: 13\nAltimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) is one of Goldman Sachs\u2019 top penny stock picks. On June 26, the company reported positive topline results from its Phase 2b IMPACT trial evaluating Pemvidutide, a treatment candidate for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The results mark a key milestone in advancing potential therapies for this chronic liver condition.\nAccording to the company, the trial\u2019s findings indicate that Pemvidutide is the first product candidate to demonstrate significant MASH effects and weight loss within 24 weeks. The trial achieved its primary endpoint, showing \u201cstatistically significant MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis.\u201d This was observed in up to 59.1% of participants in an intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis. In the ITT analysis, MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis was achieved in 59.1% of participants treated with 1.2 mg of Pemvidutide and in 52.1% with 1.8 mg, compared to 19.1% in the placebo group (p < 0.0001 for both doses).\nThe trial met several secondary endpoints, including reductions in liver fat content and liver enzyme levels. As such, the company concluded that Pemvidutide has additional therapeutic benefits for MASH patients.\nThese positive results are expected to pave the way for Altimmune to engage with the FDA in an End-of-Phase 2 meeting. The objective will be to define the path forward, including the design and scope of a Phase 3 trial. A final readout from the 48-week treatment period is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2025.\nAltimmune, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALT) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. It develops peptide-based treatments for obesity, liver diseases, and metabolic disorders.

Medical Properties Trust, Inc. (NYSE:MPW)\nGoldman Sachs\u2019s Q1 2025 Stake: $3,821,000\nShare Price as of July 3: $4.46\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2025: 19\nMedical Properties Trust, Inc. (NYSE:MPW) is one of Goldman Sachs\u2019 top penny stock picks. On June 30, RBC Capital reiterated its \u201cSector Perform\u201d rating on the company\u2019s stock. RBC lowered its price target for the stock from $5.00 to $4.50 and appended a \u201cSpeculative Risk\u201d qualifier to the rating.\nAccording to RBC, the adjustment is explained by two factors: the recent joint venture debt refinancing and higher operating expense leakage due to vacant assets. That said, RBC analysts anticipate that Medical Properties Trust\u2019s stock will likely remain volatile in the coming period due to several ongoing uncertainties. These include several tenant situations (referring to challenges related to tenants like Steward Health Care); the company\u2019s ability to monetize non-revenue-generating assets; and elevated leverage metrics.\nDespite the lowered price target, RBC emphasized that its stance on Medical Properties Trust\u2019s stock performance relative to the overall sector remains neutral. This explains the \u201cSector Perform\u201d rating.\nMedical Properties Trust, Inc. (NYSE:MPW) is a real estate investment trust (REIT). It owns and leases hospital facilities, including acute care, rehabilitation, and behavioral health hospitals. The company operates across nine countries, including the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Spain."
