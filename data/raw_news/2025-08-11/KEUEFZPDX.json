  "content": "BEIJING (Reuters) -U.S. President Donald Trump has targeted top economic rival China with a cascade of tariff orders on billions of dollars of imported goods aimed at narrowing a wide trade deficit, bringing back lost manufacturing and crippling the fentanyl trade.\n\nThe timeline below shows the development of the U.S.-China trade war this year:\n\nJanuary 21 - A day after taking office, Trump threatens 10% punitive duty on Chinese imports, citing fentanyl flowing from China.\n\nFebruary 1 - Trump imposes 10% on goods from China along with 25% on Mexico and Canada, demanding they curb the flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants into the U.S.\n\nFebruary 4 - China responds with a wide range of measures targeting U.S. businesses including Google, farm equipment makers and the owner of fashion brand Calvin Klein.\n\nBeijing also slaps levies of 15% on imports of U.S. coal and LNG and 10% for crude oil and some autos, beginning February 10. It also restricted exports of five metals used in defence, clean energy and other industries.\n\nMarch 3 - The U.S. doubles fentanyl-related tariffs on all Chinese imports, increasing levies to 20%, effective March 4.\n\nMarch 4 - China hits back with 10-15% retaliatory levies on U.S. agriculture exports, affecting about $21 billion in U.S. exports. Beijing also imposed export and investment curbs on 25 U.S. firms, on grounds of national security and banned imports of genetic sequencers from U.S. medical equipment maker Illumina.\n\nApril 2 - Trump escalates global trade friction with sweeping \"liberation day\" tariffs, announcing a baseline 10% across all imports and significantly higher duties on some countries. Trump levies 34% on all Chinese goods, to take effect on April 9.\n\nThe Trump administration also decides to end duty-free access for low-value shipments from China and Hong Kong, known as \"de minimis\" exemptions, from May 2.\n\nApril 4 - China announces retaliatory tariffs of 34% on all U.S. imports from April 10 and export curbs on some rare earths. It imposed restrictions on about 30 U.S. organisations, mostly in defence-related industries.\n\nBeijing also suspends sorghum, poultry and bone meal shipments from some U.S. firms.\n\nApril 8 - The U.S. raises tariff on all Chinese imports to 84% from 34%.\n\nApril 9 - China raises its levies on U.S. imports to 84% too, and added 12 U.S. companies to a control list that prohibits exports of dual-use items and another six to its \"unreliable entities\" list, which allows Beijing to take punitive actions against foreign entities.",
