      "text": "As K-pop stands on the brink of a global comeback, scandals and legal troubles shake its biggest agencies from within\nAs K-pop braces for what could be a golden time of global resurgence \u2014 fueled by the highly anticipated return of BTS and Blackpink \u2014 its biggest threat may not be foreign competition, but the moguls within. All heads of the so-called \u201cbig four\u201d K-pop agencies, aside from JYP Entertainment\u2019s Park Jin-young are currently embroiled in a legal case.\nBang under IPO probe\nThe most headline-grabbing figure is Hybe Chairman Bang Si-hyuk.\nDespite his limited public appearances, Bang continues to attract outsized public attention. A video of him walking with a young female streamer in Beverly Hills last July went viral \u2014 but that was just the beginning.\nBang is currently under investigation by South Korea\u2019s Financial Supervisory Service over allegations of pre-initial public offering misconduct. He is suspected of misleading early investors by claiming Hybe (then Big Hit Entertainment) had no plans to go public, while secretly arranging share sales to a private equity fund linked to an associate.\nThe deal reportedly generated massive profits, a portion of which may have gone to Bang, raising concerns of securities fraud.\nHybe has denied wrongdoing, stating that it never concealed its IPO plans and that both listing and investment options were openly discussed with investors. The company claimed that former shareholders sold their stakes based on their own judgment, fully aware of the company\u2019s strategic direction.\nSeparately, Bang has been summoned as a witness in a stock manipulation trial involving Kakao\u2019s 2023 takeover battle for SM Entertainment. While not a suspect in the case, he is expected to testify about his role in behind-the-scenes negotiations during the high-stakes acquisition. However, Bang declined to appear in court Tuesday \u2014 a move that has raised questions about transparency and his actual involvement.\nYang faces customs charges\nOn June 4, YG Entertainment Executive Producer Yang Hyun-suk appeared in a Seoul court to face charges of violating the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Crimes related to customs evasion.\nHe is accused of bringing two luxury Swiss watches, worth approximately 241 million won ($176,000), into Korea without declaring them after allegedly receiving the items as gifts in Singapore in 2014.\nYang has argued that celebrity sponsorships are an industry norm. But this claim was challenged by a representative of the watch brand, who testified that all official endorsements must be approved by the brand\u2019s Swiss headquarters and that gifting to celebrities is not permitted.\nYang\u2019s legal team countered that it remains unclear when and where the watches were received, citing inconsistent statements from the brand\u2019s regional executive.\nEXO members sue SM executives\nAt SM Entertainment, co-CEO Tak Young-jun and Chief A&R Officer Lee Sung-soo have been sued for fraud under the Act on the Aggravated Punishment of Specific Economic Crimes by three members of EXO \u2014 Chen, Baekhyun and Xiumin, also known as CBX.\nThe trio accused the two leaders of withholding transparent payment records and enforcing excessively long-term contracts, prompting them to seek termination of their exclusive agreements in mid-2023.\nAlthough the dispute appeared to be resolved temporarily when the members agreed to continue EXO-related group activities under SM Entertainment, tensions resurfaced months later over the distribution of revenue from their solo promotions.\nThe conflict escalated after Baekhyun\u2019s independent label INB100 \u2014 which also manages Chen and Xiumin \u2014 became affiliated with One Hundred Label. SM Entertainment responded by accusing the artists of tampering, alleging they had engaged in unauthorized outside negotiations.\nIn retaliation, CBX filed a criminal complaint against Tak and Lee, accusing them of manipulating royalty payments. SM Entertainment then launched a civil lawsuit demanding that the artists honor their original contracts. Both cases remain ongoing in court.\njaaykim@heraldcorp.com"

      "text": "South Korean police raided the headquarters of K-pop entertainment agency HYBE on Thursday, July 24, following ongoing inquiries and allegations of unfair share trading involving the company founder and chairman Bang Si-Hyuk, Reuters reports.\nVarious Korean media outlets report that the raid took place around 9:00 a.m. local time at HYBE\u2019s headquarters in the Yongsan district, near downtown Seoul, carried out by the financial crime unit of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.\nThe investigation follows allegations that Bang and other executives misled early investors in HYBE, then known as Big Hit Entertainment. The Korea JoongAng reported that Bang persuaded shareholders to sell their stakes to a private equity fund allegedly set up by associates. In a follow-up response, a representative for HYBE clarifies that \u201cthe private equity fund was not set up by associates of HYBE.\u201d\nBang is alleged to have profited nearly 400 billion Korean won (approximately $291.3 million today) through illicit gains ahead of the company\u2019s eventual rebranding and initial public offering on the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) in October 2020. As of July 24, 2025, Forbes cites Bang\u2019s real-time net worth at $2.4 billion (currently making him the 1,614th richest person in the world today) with the company\u2019s IPO pushing him into billionaire status.\nReuters adds that the Seoul Metropolitan Police declined to share further comment on the raid. HYBE shared the following statement: \u201cWe regret any concern caused by the recent reports related to our IPO process. HYBE is fully cooperating with the local authorities, including the financial regulators and the police, by submitting relevant materials and providing detailed explanations as part of the fact-finding efforts. We will take the necessary time to thoroughly demonstrate that the IPO was carried out in full compliance with laws and regulations.\u201d\nThe Korea Herald reports the Seoul Southern District Court issued the search and seizure warrant on Wednesday, July 23, marking the first time authorities have actually executed a warrant in connection with the case.\nLast week, Seoul\u2019s Metropolitan Police Agency requested that the prosecution transfer the case to them, citing months of investigative work, as well as their hope to avoid overlapping investigations from a South Korean financial regulator.\nHYBE\u2019s Business Today\nHYBE not only houses BTS, but a range of different labels that with various K-pop artists including BTS\u2019 label with BIGHIT MUSIC (which also houses Tomorrow X Together and Lee Hyun), PLEDIS Entertainment (home to SEVENTEEN and TWS), KOZ ENTERTAINMENT (ZICO, BOYNEXTDOOR), BELIFT LAB (ENHYPEN, ILLIT), ADOR (NewJeans), SOURCE MUSIC (LE SSERAFIM) and more. The company also has offices in Los Angeles, Tokyo, Beijing, and Mexico City, with plans to expand to India, focusing on local acts for the market such as KATSEYE, &TEAM, and aoen.\nThe company also boasts HYBE Solutions (focused on video, game and education content) as well as HYBE Platforms (a tech division that includes its superfan platform Weverse).\nBang is HYBE\u2019s largest shareholder.\nExperts have commented that the probe should have limited impact on the artists or the company overall given\nHYBE\u2019s stock fell slightly on the KOSPI for Thursday, down two percent at 262,000 Korean won (nearly $191), from 267,500 Korean won the day before. The stock is up 33% year-to-date."
