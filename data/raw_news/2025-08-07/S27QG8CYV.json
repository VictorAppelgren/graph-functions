  "content": "\u2022 None I have over 20 food allergies, so people are often surprised to hear I love traveling the world.\n\u2022 None I've picked up on a few tips that help me visit new countries without triggering a reaction.\n\u2022 None Before traveling, I pre-translate my allergens and find staple dishes that I'll be able to eat.\n\nI had my first anaphylactic reaction to cashews as a toddler, and severe food allergies have been a part of my life ever since.\n\nCashews aren't the only thing on my do-not-eat list, either: I have 24 allergens in total, from seeds to seafood to certain fruits.\n\nWith such a long allergen list, I was raised to play it safe when it comes to food and travel \u2014 after all, even eating out locally feels nearly impossible sometimes. So, whenever I tell someone that I love to travel the world, they have a lot of questions.\n\nStill, I've managed to visit nearly 35 countries to date, usually without major reactions.\n\nI've found that some places are surprisingly accommodating for people with allergies \u2014 and I've also picked up a few tricks to help myself safely explore new areas and cuisines.\n\nFortunately, I've had amazing allergy-friendly experiences in a few countries\n\nThanks to allergen-safe staple ingredients and my basic understanding of Spanish, I've always had a great experience communicating about my allergies and finding food in Mexico. I've also had luck in countries across Central America, like Nicaragua.\n\nEurope can be a trickier continent to visit, especially since many of my allergens aren't among the main 14 recognized in the UK and EU.\n\nStill, I noticed that many menus in Spain and Italy clearly flagged dishes that contained those 14 allergens. This made me feel all the more comfortable speaking up about my own allergies.\n\nI've also visited places where I've struggled to find dishes to eat\n\nMy other severe allergens include chickpeas and lentils, which made growing up in an Indian household and missing out on traditional meals with family hard.\n\nIt became even more difficult to navigate when I visited India for the first time.\n\nEven when I could find something free of chickpeas or daal (lentils), those dishes were typically garnished with nuts. After some close calls, my month in India mainly consisted of bowls of plain basmati rice.\n\nI also had a difficult time in Paris, where I encountered a few language-related mix-ups in some of the more crowded caf\u00e9s. I later learned this was due to multiple meanings and translations of the French words for \"nuts.\"\n\nIn order to stay safe when traveling, I do a lot of research and prep ahead of time\n\nDespite having almost as many allergens as I do items on my packing list, I try to see my condition as a challenge to overcome instead of a total impediment to new experiences.\n\nWhen planning a trip, I'll set aside a chunk of time to research nearby restaurants and study their online menus. Although I stay open to checking out hidden gems, I always visit a new country armed with restaurants and caf\u00e9s \u2014 with allergy-friendly offerings \u2014 that I've saved on Google Maps.\n\nAlong with specific restaurants, I'll also research a region or country's cuisine. Learning about any traditional dishes that don't include my allergens helps me feel more comfortable exploring and stumbling into unexpected local spots.\n\nFinally, I always translate my allergens ahead of time so I can share the list with servers at restaurants and caf\u00e9s. (I've seen some people on TikTok even make business cards with their allergies printed in several languages.)\n\nI also cut myself some slack if I need to eat more 'comfortable' foods\n\nAlthough preparing ahead helps me stay safe in new places, problems still crop up.\n\nI've made reservations reliant on one or two menu items during my European travels in the past, only to find they were sold out by the time I arrived.\n\nSo, I pivot and rely on meals I'm more comfortable with, even if they're not local specialties.\n\nI've found myself ordering just a basic plate of fries at chic seaside restaurants more times than I'd care to admit or visiting a familiar fast-food chain while on the other side of the world.\n\nEven the most thought-out plans don't always work, and hey, at least many chains also have fun country-specific menu variations to try.",

      "text": "- Anaphylaxis can cause severe itching, difficulty breathing, fainting, and abdominal pain.\n- These symptoms usually begin about 30 minutes after coming into contact with an allergy trigger.\n- First, call 911 \u2014 then, use an epinephrine injector, help them lie down, and perform CPR if needed.\nIf you have allergies, you might be very familiar with all those annoying \u2014 but usually manageable \u2014 symptoms, like itchy, sore eyes and a runny nose.\nIn some cases, though, allergies can cause anaphylaxis, an extreme, life-threatening reaction.\nUp to 5% of people in the US will experience anaphylaxis at some point in life. It most often happens after exposure to a handful of common allergy triggers, including certain foods, medications, insect stings, and latex. But any allergen can cause this reaction.\nEven though anaphylaxis can lead to dangerous symptoms like swelling in your throat or low blood pressure, most people will recover \u2014 just 0.3% of hospitalized cases are fatal.\nHowever, anaphylaxis is always an emergency and requires prompt medical attention.\nThat's why it's essential to know the signs so you can act quickly to find emergency treatment if you, or someone close to you, experiences anaphylaxis.\nSymptoms\nAnaphylaxis symptoms usually start within 5 to 30 minutes of exposure, says Dr. Sandra Bonat, pediatric advisor at VIP Star Network.\nSymptoms can range from mild to severe and often begin with severe itching in the eyes or face, Bonat says.\nYou may also experience:\n- Swelling in your throat or airways, which can make it hard to breathe or swallow\n- Hives\n- Shortness of breath\n- Wheezing\n- Abdominal pain\n- Feeling of dread\n- Diarrhea\n- Vomiting\n- A drop in blood pressure\n- Weak pulse\n- Loss of consciousness\n- Shock\nWhat to do: 8 life-saving steps\nWhen anaphylaxis occurs, you need to treat it with epinephrine, aka adrenaline. Epinephrine quickly works to stop severe, life-threatening symptoms, like swelling in your throat or low blood pressure.\nPeople who have a high risk of anaphylaxis often carry an automatic epinephrine injector, like an EpiPen or Auvi-Q.\nIf you notice someone experiencing symptoms of anaphylaxis, take action right away \u2014 do not wait for their symptoms to improve.\n\"The quicker they receive treatment, the better the outcome,\" says Dr. Duyen Nguyen, an allergist at Memorial Hermann.\nIf someone near you shows signs of an anaphylactic reaction, you can help them by following these eight steps:\n1. First, call 911.\n2. Ask the person if they carry an epinephrine auto injector.\n3. Help them use their auto injector if they can't do it themselves. Usually, you'll press the injector against their thigh and then inject the medication. You can give the injection through clothes or directly into their skin, but don't inject into a vein.\n4. Help the person lie down with their face up. They should stay still.\n5. Loosen any tight clothing and cover them with a blanket or jacket, if you have one.\n6. Avoid giving them anything to drink.\n7. If they are vomiting or bleeding from the mouth, turn them to their side to prevent choking.\n8. If they don't seem to be breathing, start CPR: Press down firmly into the middle of their chest about 100 times per minute \u2014 If this feels difficult to track in the moment, the American Heart Association suggests doing chest compressions to the beat of the song \"Stayin' Alive.\"\nIf you start to experience symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction:\n1. Call 911 immediately or find someone to call for you.\n2. Tell people around you that you're having an emergency allergic reaction and ask if anyone carries epinephrine.\n3. Inject epinephrine into your thigh, if it's available.\n4. Sit or lie down and wait for emergency help to arrive.\nEmergency responders will give you epinephrine if you haven't already injected it.\nIf you still can't breathe, they may use other emergency treatments to give you oxygen. For example, they might place a tube through your mouth or nose, or directly into your windpipe by making an incision in your neck.\nOnce you're stabilized, a doctor or other healthcare professional may:\n- Give you medicine to reduce your symptoms, including antihistamines, like Benadryl, and steroids, like prednisone.\n- Recommend skin or blood allergy tests to confirm what substance or allergen triggered the reaction.\n- Prescribe an epinephrine auto injector for you to use in the case of any future anaphylactic reactions and recommend you carry it with you at all times.\nWhy does it happen?\nNormally, allergies give you mild symptoms like a runny nose or itchy eyes.\nBut with anaphylaxis, your immune system overreacts when you come into contact with something you're allergic to. Chemicals released by your immune system, such as histamine and prostaglandin D, can cause severe symptoms like difficulty breathing and a rapid heart rate.\nFoods are the most frequent cause of anaphylaxis. The most common culprits include:\n- Shellfish\n- Cow's milk\n- Eggs\n- Soy\n- Fish\n- Tree nuts, like walnuts and hazelnuts\n- Wheat\nOther allergens known to trigger anaphylaxis include:\n- Venom from insect stings \u2014 most commonly bees and wasps\n- Latex in gloves, adhesives, and other products\n- Some medications, like antibiotics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), and dye used in computerized tomography (CT) scans\nA few factors may increase your risk of anaphylaxis, such as:\n- A previous anaphylactic reaction\n- A history of allergies or asthma\n- Underlying health conditions, like heart disease or mastocytosis \u2014 an irregular accumulation of a type of white blood cell.\nPreventing anaphylaxis\nThe most important thing you can do to prevent anaphylaxis involves strictly avoiding things you're allergic to, Nguyen says.\nSo, depending on your known allergy triggers, you may want to:\n- Carefully read ingredient labels on foods. Ask restaurants what ingredients they use and how they prepare their dishes.\n- Wear long sleeves, long pants, and shoes that completely cover your feet when you go outside. You may also want to avoid wearing bright clothes as well as lotions, perfumes, or other products that may attract insects.\n- Avoid drinking out of open beverage containers when outdoors, since these can attract stinging insects.\n- Tell your doctor and other healthcare professionals about any known medication allergies.\nYou can stay prepared for anaphylaxis by:\n- Always carrying your epinephrine injector.\n- Wearing a medical alert bracelet or necklace or carrying a card that notes your allergy.\n- Explaining your allergy to friends, family, co-workers, and anyone else you spend a lot of time around. It's always a good idea to make sure they know the signs of anaphylaxis and how to use your epinephrine injector, in case you're unable to inject yourself.\nInsider's takeaway\nAnaphylaxis can be a life-threatening emergency, but with quick epinephrine treatment you can usually make a full recovery.\nYou can reduce your risk of anaphylaxis by staying away from known allergy triggers, like certain foods, medications, or insect stings.\nIt's always wise to tell people close to you that you've experienced anaphylaxis before. Explain how to use your epinephrine auto injector in case you have an anaphylactic reaction and need help.\nIf you or someone near you has symptoms of anaphylaxis, like difficulty breathing and swollen lips or face, immediately use an epinephrine auto injector, if available, and call 911."

      "text": "- Food allergies aren't always obvious but they're worth taking seriously \u2014 especially since some of them can be life-threatening.\n- Hives, coughing, and itching of the throat are all signs of an allergy.\n- You could have a food allergy if you're experiencing pain swallowing certain foods.\n- Visit INSIDER's homepage for more stories.\nFood allergies can be tricky to detect. In many cases, they are severe enough that you'll know the hard way if you have one, but some allergies may not be as clear.\nDr. David Cutler, a family medicine physician at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California, explained that although not all allergies are severe, it's important to keep a watchful eye on any warning signs that suggest that you may be dealing with food allergies of any kind.\nFrom hives to swelling of the throat, below are some signs that you may have a food allergy.\nIt's worth noting that this is just a general outline of symptoms and that you should always speak with your healthcare provider to get a proper diagnosis.\nYou may experience hives\nItchy rashes and hives are some of the biggest signs of a food allergy, according to Dr. Clare Morrison, a medical advisor at Medexpress.\nIf you do experience hives, asking your doctor about an elimination diet can help you find out what food or food group is triggering you.\n\"Let's say you're not eating any of the hives foods and then you add back shellfish and you get the hives again. Then you can pretty much figure it out,\" Dr. Debra Jaliman, a New York City-based dermatologist and the author of \"Skin Rules,\" told Health.\nYou may have itching and swelling in the mouth and throat\n\"Itching and swelling in the mouth and throat is particularly worrying,\" Morrison told INSIDER. This is caused by the immune system reacting to proteins that are similar to those found in pollen such as fruits and nuts, she said.\nAccording to Harvard Medical School, this is typically classified as an oral food allergy and is considered mild. Of course, if this turns severe or is coupled with other symptoms, seek help right away.\nWheezing, coughing, and experiencing shortness of breath are other symptoms to look out for\nAs VeryWell Health noted, being slightly short of breath when eating can have many different causes, one of which is a food allergy. But this can also be one of the first signs of anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction that can be life-threatening. If you're feeling short of breath, especially when you're eating certain foods, it's best to speak with a doctor about it.\nYou're experiencing unusual reactions after taking just one bite of something\nFood allergies can be trigger by even a small amount of the food you're allergic to, said registered dietitian Staci Gulbin. If you're experiencing symptoms after simply taking a bite, that's a pretty good sign that what you're experiencing is a food allergy rather than simply an intolerance.\nYou are experiencing pain when you swallow\n\"Less obvious symptoms include difficulty swallowing, painful swallowing, or sensation of food sticking in the chest,\" said Dr. Omid Mehdizadeh, an otolaryngologist (ENT) and laryngologist at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California.\nThis is due to the allergic response within the esophagus or swallowing tube, he explained. He said that this type of food allergy is called eosinophilic esophagitis and it usually develops in childhood though it can present later on in life.\nYou have gastrointestinal distress\nDr. Sujan Patel, assistant professor of infectious disease and immunology and pediatrics at NYU Langone Medical Center, told Prevention magazine that like food intolerances, food allergies can cause gastrointestinal issues like nausea and vomiting. Unlike an intolerance, though, these symptoms may be more severe and accompanied by others on this list when you have an allergy.\nYou suddenly experience these symptoms, even as an adult\nThough most food allergies develop while you're a child, adult allergies are possible, so if you're suddenly experiencing these symptoms, it could be a sign of an allergy.\n\"It's possible to develop an adult-onset allergy,\" said Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, who specializes in family and emergency medicine. \"This means you may not have had allergies to something in the past (like shellfish), but it can happen later in life and the exact reason is unclear.\"\nIt's worth noting that many people may think they have an allergy though they actually have an intolerance\nAll of this in mind, food allergies are classified by a reaction by your immune system and allergies are generally life-threatening. Intolerances, which are often mistaken for allergies and are much more common, may simply cause gastrointestinal distress, per Cleveland Clinic.\nAs always, it's best to speak with your doctor for an individual diagnosis especially if you are uncertain if you are dealing with an intolerance or allergy."

      "text": "- At the end of January, I packed nothing but a carry-on and a purse for a two month trip across half a dozen countries in Asia.\n- One month into the trip, my luggage has provided everything I need as I've traveled from cities to beaches and experienced temperatures ranging from 19 degrees to 90 degrees.\n- Read on for my packing list.\n- Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.\nPacking for a two-month trip is a challenge at the best of times. When the temperature will span from 90 degrees down to 19 degrees, it can feel almost impossible.\nStarting my trip in Seoul, South Korea in late January, before heading to the steamy cities of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, following by Thailand's balmy beaches, I knew I needed to pack an array of options. And, I didn't have much room.\nBecause I was booking a bunch of flights and constantly on the lookout for deals, I wanted to be able to only fly with a carry-on. So, I needed to fit two months' worth of clothing, plus various tech and other travel gear, in a roller suitcase and a purse.\nA month in and reporting from the Phi Phi Islands in Thailand, I can say I did a pretty good job. I made a few mistakes and had to buy a few things on the road, but overall my plan has worked out pretty well.\nIf you're heading for a trip that lasts a month or longer in a variety of climates, read on for my packing list. Hopefully, it will help you build your own.\nI packed a lot of pieces that I could mix-and-match. For my winter-focused packing list, that meant a lot of layers.\nMy goal when packing was to focus on clothing I could layer to wear in the cold. I ended up wearing some mix of jeans, a long or short sleeve shirt, and every sweater/coat I had when it got down to 19 degrees in Seoul.\nBasically everything I packed was black, white, grey, or blue. Here is my cold-weather clothes packing list:\n- 1 chambray shirt\n- 1 long-sleeve white shirt\n- 1 running pullover sweater\n- 1 thermal underwear shirt\n- 1 pair of black jeans\n- 1 pair of blue jeans\n- 1 pair black leggings\nI packed two coats \u2014 one rain coat and one puffer jacket that could be rolled into a tiny ball.\nTo stay warm, I tried to pack things I wouldn't completely ditch when I left South Korea for warmer weather. So, I brought:\n- A lightweight puffy jacket\n- A long Athleta rain jacket\n- 1 pair of running gloves\n- 1 beanie\n- A wrap, which is large enough to double as a blanket on the plane or a particularly chilly budget hotel\nWhen it came to warmer weather, I packed things that I thought I could potentially wear in the cold if I layered, as well as things I could wear over and over again.\nI found that I wore a lot of the short-sleeve shirts in Seoul, thanks to my layering technique. But, I have been wearing a ton of dresses and skirts since I left South Korea. Here's the general rundown:\n- 2 dresses (one horrible Everlane one and one great Outdoor Voices one)\n- 1 green cotton midi skirt\n- 1 pair of black jean shorts\n- 7 short-sleeve shirts (a mix of t-shirts and nicer tops)\n- 1 camisole\n- 2 pairs of workout shorts\n- 1 pair of workout capri leggings\n- 1 baseball cap\n- 1 pair of sunglasses\nMy Outdoor Voices workout dress has seen a ton of use, as it is sweatproof and impossible to get wrinkled. An Everlane dress that was supposed to be wrinkle-free has been the bane of my existence, as it both wrinkles and shows pit stains with shocking clarity. Make sure to wrinkle test before you pack!\nI ended up buying another dress in Kuala Lumpur \u2014 a lightweight, flowing outfit. I spent less than $10 and I've been wearing constantly on the beach. I'll probably buy another dress that doubles as a swimsuit cover-up before the trip is over.\nMy swimsuits were also multi-purpose.\nI decided to pack two swimsuits, since I was going to spend a good portion of my trip at or near the beach. I wanted to make the most of my room, so I picked suits that could be worn either as sports bras or crop tops. Both suits have black bottoms, so I can mix and match between the two.\nTo sum that up:\n- 1 bikini that can double as a sports bra\n- 1 tankini that can double as a tank top\nI only packed three pairs of shoes.\nThe shoes in question:\n- Tevas, which I have worn almost every day in Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand and have the tan lines to prove it\n- Black sneakers, which I wear while running and traveling\n- Black Blundstone boots, which I wore constantly in South Korea and to visit factories in Ho Chi Minh City\nAnd, no, I did not forget the basics.\nI planned to travel for two months, and figured I could do laundry every two weeks or so. So, for basics, I packed:\n- 16 pairs of underwear\n- 7 pairs of socks (both workout and wool hiking socks)\n- 3 bras\n- 1 sports bra (in addition to my swimsuits)\n- 1 black belt\nI managed to store all of my tech stuff in my camera bag, which helped cut down on clutter. Traveling for work, some items were necessary that I would not typically bring on a vacation.\nIn my camera bag, I pack:\n- Camera and camera gear\n- Laptop charger\n- Phone charger\n- Universal travel adapter\n- iPhone USB wall charger adapter \u2014 I purchased this in South Korea because I was already sick of swapping between charging my laptop and phone when I slept, and it was one of the best purchases I made on the trip.\nMy laptop does not go in the camera bag, but it also travels everywhere with me!\nI tried to cut back on how many toiletries I needed, but ended up packing three full bags \u2014 one for makeup and general toiletries, one for contacts and tampons, and one for medicine and other medical related junk.\nIn my makeup bag, I packed:\n- Burt's Bees' tinted lip balm\n- Glossier lip balm\n- Dr. Jart's BB Cream, plus some a second tube with a higher SPF that I bought in Seoul\n- Fenty Beauty Match Stix\n- Brow kit\n- Eyeliner\n- Tiny sample mascara I took from a friend\n- Mini shampoo (refilled and stole free mini bottles on the go)\n- Mini conditioner (also refilled this)\n- Body wash\n- Mini body lotion\n- Toothpaste\n- Face wash\nIn the second bag I packed:\n- Two months worth of daily contacts (recommended by my eye doctor, and took up a ton of room)\n- Deodorant\n- Tampons\n- Condoms\n- Sunscreen\n- Tissues\n- Folding hairbrush\nI was very thorough, and packed the medicine bag with:\n- Surgical masks\n- Back-up hand sanitizer\n- Mini packs of sanitizing wipes\n- Neosporin (useful when I was stung by a sea urchin)\n- Pepto-Bismol and various antidiarrheals\n- Cold medicine, including Nyquil\n- Cough drops\n- Advil\n- Soolantra (my anti-rosacea medicine that is also prescribed to President Trump)\n- Bandages\n- Eye drops\n- Plan B\n- Stain remover stick\n- A list of medicines my parents, a doctor and a nurse, recommended in case of emergencies\nThere are a few things I need to have handy any time I am traveling internationally.\nThese are the things I stick in my purse for easy access while flying:\n- Passport\n- Passport holder, aka a Betsey Johnson clutch I got at a secret Santa years ago. It's fantastic as a passport holder because it is sequined, so you can always feel it when rummaging around in your bag in a moment of panic that you've lost your passport.\n- Wallet\n- 2 pairs of earphones, both for my iPhone and for planes/my laptop\n- iPhone XR (it's still too big)\n- Tissues\n- More hand sanitizer\n- Lysol wipes\n- Travel notebooks\n- Glasses and glasses case\nI packed and unpacked while writing this post, so I don't think I forgot anything. But, as with every time I pack my bag, I am incredibly anxious I forgot something extremely obvious.\nDespite only boarding some of my flights with a carry-on and a purse, I ended up packing four bags total.\nIn addition to my roller bag and my easily-foldable Everlane purse, I also brought a small Osprey day-pack. Plus, I brought a small over the shoulder bag that I use frequently when all I need is some cash, my phone, and my room key.\nThe backpack and tiny bag were packed in the roller backpack when I needed to carry-on all my baggage. Then, my camera bag was placed in my purse, where it took up basically all the possible room.\nFor budget airlines with a baggage weight limit of under 7 kg (a little over 15 lbs), I pay a bit extra to check my carry-on and board with my backpack and purse. And, if I have a free checked bag, I'll always take advantage of it.\nI haven't had to buy much while traveling.\nMost of my purchases have been things I ran out of, such as sunscreen and deodorant. My only major purchases that I could have bought in the US have been a new dress and a plug converter for my iPhone USB charging cord.\nI do have a few things that I would not have packed. My nice Everlane dress gets wrinkled way too quickly, and I did not need to pack two pairs of jeans. Plus, while my Blundstone boots were crucial in Seoul, they are now seriously weighing down my suitcase.\nStill, I think I did an overall solid job packing. My Outdoor Voices dress has stood the test of time, holding up through almost daily use. And, Burt's Bees' tinted lip balm and Dr. Jart's BB cream have permanently earned their place as my top travel cosmetics for any trip."

      "text": "- I'm a travel writer from Mexico City who has eaten at some of the city's best restaurants.\n- The food scene in CDMX is incredibly authentic, and has great late-night eats and street food.\n- From Mexican-style seafood to juicy tacos al pastor, these are my favorite spots in the city.\nAs a travel writer from Mexico City who loves food, I\u2019ve learned there\u2019s always something to discover when it comes to restaurants in my hometown.\nI have places I never get tired of as my go-tos, but I also like to stay up to date with new openings, some of which become favorites, too.\nThe food scene in CDMX, which is what we locals call our city, never wants for options, in my experience. Between the street food and late-night eats, classic spots serving authentic cuisine from different regions in Mexico, and the new venues with one-of-a-kind dishes, there are choices looming on every corner.\nExpect some street food, classic tacos, seafood dishes with a Mexican twist, and some international cuisine in the mix. These are the places I wouldn't hesitate to recommend to any friend visiting the city, and where I return to for some of my favorite dishes and experiences time and time again.\nI dream of the pastor especial from El Huequito.\nI never realized how much I loved tacos al pastor until I started spending long spells away from CDMX. Even though I have found taco shops abroad, I've never found authentic tacos al pastor outside of Mexico.\nOnce I finally gave El Huequito a try, my appreciation for pastor reached new heights. Besides the signature tacos, the restaurant serves a variety of alambres, burritos, and tortas. I recommend ordering the \"pastor especial,\" which is a stack of pork meat smothered in salsa next to a pile of tortillas. It's meant to be shared and the menu says it serves up to eight tacos, but in the past, I've devoured one on my own.\nEl Huequito started as a hole-in-the-wall on the sidewalk in 1959, according to its website, and has since expanded into a local chain with 10 locations around the city. This makes it a reliable place to stop for an affordable and delicious meal, in my experience. True to the name, which means little hole in English, each location has a casual, lunch counter feel.\nEl Turix's only meat on the menu is cochinita pibil, it's that good.\nCochinita pibil, or Mexican-style pulled pork, is the only meat on the menu at El Turix. I personally don't mind, because it's the best I've had in the city.\nI almost always get back in line for a second helping while eating here, whether I order a torta, tacos, or panuchos, which is a tortilla stuffed with refried black beans and topped with cochinita and pickled red onion.\nLocated in the ritzy Polanco neighborhood, I think El Turix's casual atmosphere adds to its charm. It's grab-and-go, with no seating. Guests order at a bare-bones window, and can watch the server dip tortillas in the meat sauce and scoop up the juicy pulled pork. I usually eat my meal standing up on the sidewalk, and the sauce can get messy, so I make sure to grab napkins. As a fan of spice, I also like adding a few drops of habanero sauce to the tacos to make the flavors pop.\nFor fresh seafood in shareable servings, I head to Mi Compa Chava.\nMi Compa Chava is a recent addition to the Mexico City food scene that opened in April 2021. It immediately got local buzz, and to this day, my friends and people I know in CDMX are still talking about it. When I first visited last December and again this January, I could see why.\nThe restaurant serves Mexican-style seafood, and the menu is brimming with fresh oysters, blood clams, and aguachiles, which is a spicy, ceviche-like dish. There are two locations in Roma and Coyoac\u00e1n, and I recommend making a reservation in advance, as it can be booked two to three weeks ahead. They accept walk-ins, but I've heard friends say waiting times can be up to two hours.\nI ordered \"La Se\u00f1ora Torres,\" on my last visit, which was a tower of layered shrimp, tuna, scallops, octopus, avocado, red onion, and cucumber, topped with a house-made hot sauce. I was glad I went with friends to help me finish it because the portion was massive. We followed with the pescado zarandeado, a large grilled fish in chili paste. I was too full to fit in the scallop tostadas, so I'm saving that dish for my next visit.\nP\u00e1ramo serves my favorite tacos de jamaica in a trendy, dimly-lit eatery.\nI love P\u00e1ramo's vast selection of gourmet tacos, but I return time and time again for their Jamaic\u00f3n taco, made with jamaica, or hibiscus flowers, fresh cheese, avocado, and onion.\nAnother quirk of this restaurant is that the tacos are available in different sizes \u2014 taquito, taco, and cazuela, which means saucepan in English and is the largest size. I recommend starting by ordering three varieties of the smallest tacos and then more of your favorite to round off the meal. Wash it all down with one of their delicious mezcal cocktails.\nThe dining room can get a bit loud, so I prefer booking a table in one of the venue's adjoining rooms that are smaller and beautifully decorated. P\u00e1ramo is also located above two sister restaurants that I think are worth checking out. El Parnita is a buzzy spot with cocktails and live music, and Expendio de Ma\u00edz is a tiny, omakase-style Mexican eatery with inventive corn-based dishes made from scratch.\nPujol is my choice for a splurge occasion with out-of-town friends.\nI've eaten at Pujol more times than any other fine-dining restaurant. Ever since head chef Enrique Olvera was featured on Netflix's \"Chef's Table\" in 2016, different friends urged me to book a table at his venue in affluent Polanco. Over the years, I've seen it evolve from the cozy original location to its current, larger and breezier venue with a filling tasting menu and an omakase option.\nThe seven-course tasting menu changes seasonally, although some dishes are consistent. The times I've been, I've always been served a dish of smoked baby corn and a dish of two different mole sauces, one freshly made and the other aged for 2,500 days, according to my server. There's an option to add a wine pairing, but as it's already a pricey meal, I prefer ordering a few cocktails instead.\nI think Pujol is a great choice for those looking for a luxury, celebrity-worthy experience. Once when I was here, I saw actor Diego Luna of \"Narcos\" and \"Star Wars\" fame.\nBella Aurora serves up Mexican-Italian fusion in a plant-filled patio.\nBella Aurora is a restaurant in the Roma Norte neighborhood that fuses Mexican and Italian cuisine, and is open daily for brunch and dinner. When I eat here, I love dining on the covered terrace. It's filled with plants and feels like being in a garden, which I think is fun for a date night or an outing with friends.\nYou won't go wrong with any of the pastas, in my opinion, and there are also pizzas, seafood, and steak dishes. A favorite item I've tried was the casarecce with beef tail ragu.\nThe restaurant is run by local chef Elena Reygadas, who also owns the nearby Rosetta and Panader\u00eda Rosetta, a bakery I love to stop by for fresh guava rolls and delicious conchas.\nMigrante serves beautifully presented courses from an open-plan kitchen.\nOne of the things I appreciate most about a visit to Migrante is the chance to meet the chef, which in my experience doesn't happen often at fancy restaurants.\nThis is a restaurant I'd choose for a special occasion or night out as I think it's a memorable dining experience. Tables are grouped in front of an open-plan kitchen, so from my seat I could watch chef Fernando Mart\u00ednez lead his staff in the open-plan kitchen. I also thought the decor was striking \u2014 there were origami birds hanging from the ceiling, and a world map carved in cement on one of the walls.\nGuests have the option of ordering a la carte or choosing the five or nine-course menu. When I visited, I went big for the nine-course menu and was glad I did. Foams, puffed up quinoa, edible flowers, and savory churro batter are some of the surprising ingredients I tasted, and each course was beautifully presented.\nI also appreciated that the friendly staff explained how each of the dishes were made using cooking techniques from around the world, as they said Migrante's aim is to use food to represent the migrant experience and transcend borders.\nFor a refreshing and filling dinner with friends, I go to Izakaya Kura for its large menu of authentic Japanese dishes.\nIf you find yourself in need of a break from tacos and carb-centric Mexican fare, I recommend Izakaya Kura, a Japanese tavern with authentic flavors and enough variety to refresh your palate.\nUnlike most Japanese restaurants I've been to in Mexico City, Izakaya Kura serves mainly small bites and shareable plates, including dishes like karaage chicken, butter scallops, and pan-fried oysters.\nThere are more options like rice bowls, ramen, and sushi, as well as wagyu beef sold by the gram, and a large selection of sake and shochu. There's a lot to choose from, but I recommend going for the yakitori, which are grilled skewers of various meats and vegetables. I like ordering a mix of meat and veggie skewers for a satisfying meal.\nThe pad thai at Galanga Thai House is one of the few I've tried in CDMX that I've loved.\nFinding Southeast Asian cuisine in Mexico City is not as common as in large American cities, in my experience. Galanga Thai House was a standout in my eyes when it first opened in 2015, and soon the restaurant became so successful it expanded to a much larger location. Saying that it has the best pad thai in the city is an understatement \u2014 it's one of the few I've tried in CDMX that I've really loved.\nIts current location has a palatial atmosphere, tastefully blending a decor like plants and rattan ceiling lamps with mid-century touches of velvet chairs and ornate wall moldings. I like to come here for lunch to break up the work day with a lychee or passion fruit mimosa, and catch up with a friend while sharing the soft shell crab pad thai and green chicken curry. I'm also a big fan of their tom yum soup."

      "text": "We're all familiar with allergies \u2014 in the US, approximately 30% of adults and 40% of children suffer from them, and they are unfortunately getting worse for many.\nThese reactions are triggered by immune system responses to substances that are generally considered harmless. Symptoms range from itchy eyes and runny noses to skin hives to life-threatening, throat-closing anaphylaxis.\nMost people are aware of common allergens like pollen, peanuts, dogs, and cats. But allergy and immunology specialists sometimes encounter more mysterious allergies.\nHere are some of the strangest and rarest allergies doctors encounter \u2014 and how patients with these conditions try to cope.\nRed meat: People bitten by infected Lone Star ticks can develop an allergy that makes them unable to consume mammalian meat like beef, pork, or lamb.\nSomething in the ticks' bite can make people allergic to a sugar compound called alpha-galactose that exists in meat.\nThis allergy is becoming more common as the tick that delivers the infected bite expands its range. Some people become more allergic to meat than others do, but reactions can be quite severe. Unlike most other allergies, symptoms often take hours to kick in.\nNo one knows whether the allergy goes away with time or if it can be treated, but scientists think that both additional tick bites and meat consumption might worsen the condition.\nWater: People who suffer from aquagenic urticaria, also known as 'water allergy,' develop hives and itchiness shortly after their skin is exposed to water.\nThis condition, considered a rare disease, mostly affects women and can develop during puberty. The underlying cause is unknown, and experts think it could be caused either by allergens dissolved in water (in which case water wouldn't really be the cause) or by interactions between a person's skin and water that create a substance that triggers hives.\nThere is limited data on successful treatments, but for some patients, antihistamines \u2014 which are often used to counteract allergic reactions \u2014 help. Some other medications, light therapy, and sodium bicarbonate have been found to be helpful as well.\nSemen: Certain unlucky individuals have experienced an allergic reaction to semen \u2014 even their own.\nSemen allergies are rare, but they're actually one of the more common on this list. People with this condition experience burning, itching, and swelling after coming into contact with seminal fluid. This condition more frequently affects women but can be found in men. Doctors have even found men who are allergic to their own semen.\nThere are various treatment options, but most often people are simply advised to avoid the substance \u2014 either completely or with protective barriers like condoms. Some also try gradual exposure to build up a tolerance. Women with this condition who want to become pregnant may need to undergo in vitro fertilization, or may need to be provided with sperm that has certain proteins washed off. Severe cases may require an EpiPen.\nThe sun: Rare sufferers of solar urticaria develop a sore, itchy rash after their skin is exposed to sunlight.\nAnother rare condition that can make life difficult is solar urticaria, which can develop at any point in a person's life. Reactions frequently occur after even a short amount of sun exposure, and are more likely to happen on parts of the body that are less frequently exposed to the sun.\nWhile this condition is poorly understood, researchers have found that it can be triggered by UVA or UVB (components of ultraviolet light found in the sun), as well as visible light.\nTreatment options include antihistamines, avoidance, and gradual exposure to sunlight to build up a tolerance.\nHidden parasites in fish: Certain parasites that are becoming more common can start to trigger allergy symptoms in people who consume them.\nAn allergic reaction after a fish dinner may make someone think they're allergic to fish, but sometimes the culprit is an organism hidden inside the food. The Anisakis simplex parasite, found in temperate waters around the globe, can infect a number of kinds of fish or squid, and has also been found in chicken meat.\nAn Anisakiasis infection alone can be severe, causing abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and symptoms that mimic Crohn's disease. But people can also develop immune reactions to these parasites that manifest as asthma or severe allergies (with symptoms like hives or anaphylaxis). It's even possible to develop these allergies if fish is well cooked or even via regular contact with fish, as has happened with factory workers.\nTreatment options are limited but include antihistamines or emergency adrenaline.\nCold: Sudden drops in temperature can trigger reactions with potentially life-threatening throat swelling in some rare cases.\nSudden drops in temperature are rarely pleasant, but for certain people they can be deadly. Sufferers of cold urticaria are most frequently young adults. A sudden change in temperature is usually responsible, especially in situations where it affects the whole body, like jumping into water.\nThe condition is not well understood, but it can go away naturally in a few months or years. Patients are told to be careful before engaging in activities like swimming. Antihistamines can help block certain severe reactions.\nExercise: In a small number of people, physical exercise can trigger hives or even life-threatening anaphylaxis.\nThis condition has been described in medical literature since at least the 1970s. Researchers think the reaction could be triggered by consuming certain foods or medications before exercise. Potential triggers include seafood, celery, wheat, or cheese; medical drugs that may lead to this reaction include NSAIDs and Aspirin.\nFor treatment, doctors tell patients to avoid exercise after consuming certain substances and to work out with a partner who can administer life support if needed."

      "text": "- I went to India for the first time on a group tour with my kids.\n- Our trip was great, but I wish I'd packed more hand sanitizer and medications from home.\n- I also wish I'd tried the delicious street food sooner and extended my trip.\nIndia has been on my list of must-see destinations for years.\nI have always longed to see the Taj Mahal and the Bengal tigers that roam the country's vast forests. Yet, I put off visiting because I found the idea of navigating a country populated by more than a billion people intimidating.\nNevertheless, I recently took the plunge and booked a group tour of India with Intrepid Travel with my kids.\nThankfully, most things went well, and we had a great trip. But our trip could've been even better if I'd avoided these four mistakes.\nNot trying street food earlier and more often\nWhen I was planning my trip to India, multiple friends and my doctor warned me repeatedly about \"Delhi Belly,\" also called traveler's diarrhea.\nThey advised me to be extremely careful about what I ate and drank lest my stomach revolt. I worried that if I slipped up, even once, I might spend several days of my trip in the bathroom.\nI knew the risks were real, but I went overboard with my precautions, which caused me to miss out on some of the country's great street food.\nAt first, I only watched as others in my group enjoyed samosas and lassis from street vendors.\nEventually, I decided that Indian street food was an important part of local culture I didn't want to miss out on. So, I started indulging in the delicious offerings.\nI followed common-sense safety rules, including making sure my food was served hot off the grill and that the stalls I was buying from looked clean.\nI didn't get sick, and I wish I'd taken the plunge sooner.\nFailing to pack enough medication and hand sanitizer\nIndia has some of the most polluted cities in the world, so I knew to expect some air quality or sanitation issues during my trip. Still, I felt underprepared.\nThroughout our trip, we encountered many public bathrooms without soap, hot water, or toilet paper. I packed a ton of hand sanitizer, but it wasn't enough, and I couldn't find more to purchase anywhere I looked.\nPartway through my trip, I had to ration my use of hand sanitizer, which made me nervous.\nMoreover, even though I brought far more medication than I usually do when I travel, I wish I'd brought more. I packed everything my travel clinic recommended for tummy troubles but nothing for coughs or colds.\nThis was an issue in Delhi, our first stop in India, where my son started coughing almost immediately, which we attributed to the pollution. He also developed a runny nose, which can be caused by pollution.\nWe managed, but medication to ease these symptoms would have helped. I also wish I'd packed more masks that we could've worn to help filter out some of the pollutants.\nNot staying long enough\nThough I often travel independently, I went to India on a group tour.\nI figured this would make our trip easier since India can be a challenging country for Americans to navigate because of cultural differences, language barriers, and the sheer number of people who live there. I think was the right move, especially with children.\nBy the end of the tour, however, I felt fairly well-acclimated. Though I initially found the prospect of being in India alone overwhelming, on the last day of the tour, I took the Delhi metro with ease and navigated the city confidently without a guide.\nI even hailed a tuk-tuk like a pro \u2014 I was a far cry from the nervous traveler I was when I first boarded a crowded train in Delhi.\nI wish I hadn't been afraid to tack a couple of extra days onto my trip to explore more on my own and see more of the country.\nNot learning more about India's culture and history ahead of time\nThough I'd loaded my Kindle with books about or set in India, I didn't get to read many of them before my trip. This left me scrambling to catch up.\nFor example, while I knew the Taj Mahal was perhaps the world's most profound symbol of love, I wasn't aware I could go inside before I arrived.\nThroughout the trip, I found myself asking basic questions on tours more often than I would have liked instead of using them as an opportunity to dig deeper.\nI think I would've understood more about the places I saw and the people I met if I'd gone into the trip with a better understanding of India's complexities, history, and people."
