  "title": "Parallels Desktop 26 for Mac review: macOS Tahoe ready 2025 update",
  "description": "Parallels Desktop is the best option for users who need to run Windows on a Mac and Parallels has already released a Tahoe ready update. Here's our full review.",
  "content": "The Mac is no longer dismissed as an insignificant niche market that struggles to compete with Microsoft Windows. But, even so, there are still times when many Mac users need to run apps and software that are only available for Windows PCs. Perhaps your employer uses particular business software that\u2019s only available for Windows, or you may need to use a website that relies on some Windows-only technologies. Many developers need to test their apps and services on both Macs and PCs and, of course, there are all those A-List games that only run on Windows as well.\n\nIt used to be easy to install Windows on Macs, thanks to Apple\u2019s Boot Camp software and the fact that from 2006 to 2020 all Macs used the same Intel processors as Windows PCs. However, with the advent of M-series Macs, Boot Camp is no more, so if you want to run Windows on a Mac you need to consider one of the various virtualization options that we feature in our round-up of the Best Virtual Machine software for Mac.\n\nThe advent of Apple\u2019s own chips, aka Apple Silicon, also means that the standard version of Windows, designed for X-86 chips, won\u2019t run on Arm-based chips like Apple\u2019s M-series. If you want to run Windows on an M-series Mac you need the Arm version of Windows.\n\nOur top solution for running Windows on a Mac is Parallels Desktop. Read on to find out why in our full review of Parallels Desktop for Mac. Skip to the section about the latest version of Parallels Desktop if you are already familiar with the software and want to know what\u2019s new.\n\nWhat is Parallels Desktop for Mac\n\nParallels Desktop is referred to as a virtualization program, because it allows you to create a virtual machine on your Mac \u2013 sometimes known as a VM \u2013 which is essentially a piece of software that simulates the physical hardware of a Windows PC (process also known as emulation) and lets you run Windows on your Mac.\n\nOne of the benefits of a solution like Parallels Desktop is it allows you to run Mac and Windows apps side by side, without having to reboot your Mac to switch between the macOS and Windows (which you had to do with Boot Camp).\n\nParallels gives you a lot of control over how you integrate Windows on your Mac. You could choose to keep Windows and macOS completely separate, with a full Windows desktop window floating on the Mac desktop, or the Windows VM can be expanded to full-screen size to hide the Mac desktop. But you can also use Coherence mode to run your Windows apps on your Mac so that they integrate fully with your Mac apps\u2013you can even add them to your Dock.\n\nYou can run more than Windows as a VM on your Mac with Parallels Desktop. You can create a VM that runs Linux, or even a VM that runs a different version of macOS itself. This can be useful for developers who need to test a website or an app on different versions of the macOS, although it\u2019s currently only possible to create VMs that run Monterey (macOS 12.0) or later on Macs with Apple Silicon. However, Intel-based Macs can go right back to Mac OS X 10.7 Lion\u2013we have the details of how to find old versions of macOS here.\n\nAnother useful feature of Parallels is Rollback mode, which lets you run Windows (or Linux, or macOS) like a kiosk. What this means is that nothing is saved and after you have finished working and restart the computer the VM will return return to it\u2019s original state, this is perfect for developers who can experiment and then return to a clean slate.\n\nParallels makes installing Windows really easy. Since Parallels Desktop version 18 it has been possible to download and buy the ARM version of Windows 11 directly within Parallels. You do need to buy a license for the ARM version of Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise in order to create a Windows VM on Macs with Apple Silicon processors \u2013 unfortunately, the less expensive Home edition isn\u2019t supported \u2013 although it\u2019s also possible to use an existing license if you have one available. Microsoft doesn\u2019t differentiate between Windows On Intel and Windows On Arm, so a Windows 11 license can be used for either version.\n\nThis is a big deal because the Arm version of Windows isn\u2019t normally licensed to individual users. Fortunately, Parallels has worked closely with Microsoft to simplify the process of creating VMs that use the ARM version of Windows. Just select the File/New command to create a new VM (or press the \u2018+\u2019 button in the program\u2019s main Control Centre window) and it will present you with a big button labeled: Get Windows 11 From Microsoft.\n\nWindows 11 On ARM allows you to run most older software and apps that were originally written for the Intel version of Windows, so you shouldn\u2019t have any compatibility problems when running virtual machines that use Windows On ARM.\n\nParallels Desktop 20.2.0 added the ability for Macs with Apple Silicon to run the original Intel version of Windows. That will be useful for developers who want to work on both ARM and Intel platforms. The feature is available in the Pro, Business and Enterprise editions.\n\nOlder Intel-based Macs can still run Windows 10 via Parallels, although older versions of Windows are no longer supported.\n\nRead our guide to How to use Parallels Desktop to run Windows on a Mac for more information.\n\nSince your Mac is effectively running two operating systems at the same time\u2013the macOS and Windows\u2013so you\u2019ll need a reasonably fast Mac with plenty of memory, disk space and \u2013 above all \u2013 processor power in order to run your virtual machines efficiently.\n\nFortunately, modern multi-core processors like Apple\u2019s M-series of chips can run routine apps such as the Windows versions of Microsoft Word or Excel using virtualization with no trouble at all, and faster Mac models can do a pretty good job running 3D games or high-end tools for design and graphics work.\n\nYou do need plenty of memory to run the macOS and Windows alongside each other though. Parallels Desktop generally recommends a minimum of 1-2GB for each VM, but that really is the absolute minimum, and it\u2019s in addition to the memory that your Mac needs just to run the macOS, so if you\u2019ve got a Mac with just 8GB of memory then you\u2019re not going to get the best possible performance when running Windows in a VM.\n\nJuggling memory and processor cores can be confusing for less experienced users, but Parallels Desktop can help by recommending settings that will be suitable for running different types of Windows apps and software. On high-end Macs, such as the Mac Studio, you can configure your virtual machines to use up to 62GB of memory and 18 CPU cores for improved performance. Unfortunately, Parallels informed us that the multiple GPU cores on Apple Silicon chips are controlled solely by the macOS itself, so Parallels doesn\u2019t currently allow you to also specify the number of GPU cores used by your virtual machines.\n\nNew versions of Parallels Desktop are always released to coincide with the latest updates to the macOS every year (with occasional mid-year updates, such as the recent v20.2, also thrown in for good measure). This year\u2019s release arrives just ahead of the new macOS 26 \u2013 aka Tahoe \u2013 and it also adopts Apple\u2019s new version numbers, which means that the latest version is now called Parallels Desktop 26. And, along with the existing Standard, Pro and Business Editions, there\u2019s also a new Enterprise Edition for larger organisations.\n\nAs you\u2019d expect, Parallels Desktop 26 is fully compatible with macOS 26 Tahoe, and includes technical updates that allow it to run smoothly with the new system for handling background processes that has been introduced with macOS 26. And, when creating a Windows virtual machine (VM), it\u2019s also compatible with the latest Windows 11 25H2 as well. Windows virtual machines can also display the storage space that is available on the host Mac, making it easier to avoid slow-downs due to lack of storage on the VM.\n\nUsers of the Business Edition now have more detailed control over virtual machines deployed throughout their organisation, ensuring that settings such as shared folders, access to USB devices, and network usage can be enforced for all users. There\u2019s more help for IT managers who want to use Parallels\u2019 Single Application Mode, which allows them to install a single Windows app on their virtual machines, which then appears to run on the Mac desktop like a native Mac app, without exposing the full complexity of the Parallels Desktop interface. It\u2019s also possible to manage Windows updates within virtual machines by using the Jamf Pro management system, and the Business Edition has been audited for compliance with the latest SOC 2 Type II security standards.\n\nWhat was new in Parallels Desktop 20 for Mac?\n\nParallels Desktop 20 arrived in September 2024, bringing support for macOS Sequoia and new features in that version of macOS.\n\nParallels 20 included a number of new features that are only available to Mac\u2019s running Sequoia. With Sequoia as your Mac\u2019s main operating system \u2013 rather than just a guest running in a virtual machine \u2013 you have the ability to sign into a Mac virtual machine (VM) using your Apple ID, which will allow you to use your Apple email and other Apple services. And it is possible to use the Apple Intelligence-powered Writing Tools feature within Windows apps that arrived on Macs with an macOS 16 update.\n\nThere were performance improvements when using Parallels\u2019 file-sharing features to exchange files between your main Mac and your virtual machines. Macs with Apple Silicon also gained the ability to quickly save and restore snapshots of VMs (although the snapshots feature was already available when running Parallels on Macs with Intel processors in the past).\n\nParallels Desktop 20 was compatible with the 24H2 Windows 11 On Arm update which featured an improved Prism emulator to provide as much as 80% performance improvement when running some older Windows apps that were written for Intel processors. Prism is similar to Apple\u2019s Rosetta, which allows old Mac apps that were written for Intel processors to run on modern Macs with Apple Silicon \u2013 and, strictly speaking, this is an improvement provided by Microsoft within Windows 11 24H2, but it still benefited Parallels users by speeding up older Windows apps running within a virtual machines.\n\nAs mentioned above, Parallels Desktop 20.2.0 added the ability for Macs with Apple Silicon to run the original Intel version of Windows.\n\nWhat was new in Parallels Desktop 19 for Mac?\n\nParallels Desktop 19 arrived in August 2023 and introduced a redesigned interface with windows and dialogue boxes that adopted the curved lines and candy colors of macOS. More serious eye candy also arrived with support for 3D graphics in Windows using OpenGL 4.1, improving compatibility and performance for some important graphics and design programs, such as ArcGIS Pro, VectorWorks and VariCAD. The 2023 update also brought Touch ID to Windows virtual machines, allowing users to sign in to a Windows VM using both Touch ID and a personal Microsoft account.\n\nApple changed the printing system used in Sonoma, so Parallels Desktop 19 also introduced a new Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) to allow users to print documents from a virtual machine using their normal printer.\n\nParallels Desktop 19.2 brought a faster option for cloning VMs. That\u2019s useful for developers and professional users who may need to create multiple VMs based on an existing template. It also improved the ability to use Sign In With Apple to sign in to a Parallels account using hardware security keys that users may have created on their Mac. The introduction of Sonoma changed the way the macOS handles Windows disk formats, causing some VMs to become unstable when running from an external hard drive or SSD, so version 19.2 also fixed this problem to improve the stability of VMs on external drives.\n\nAnd, in March 2024, the program was updated to version 19.3. This fixed graphics problems that had affected a number of well-known Windows games, such as Dark Souls II and Genshin Impact. Gamers should be aware, though, that (at the time of writing) Parallels is still working on support for Microsoft\u2019s DirectX 12 graphics software, and Parallels Desktop is still limited to games that use DirectX 11.\n\nParallels Desktop has traditionally been available in three separate versions, with the Standard Edition designed for home users and education, the Pro Edition for developers, and the Business Edition for corporate users. However, 2024 sees the arrival of a new Enterprise Edition, which is due for release \u2018later this fall\u2019 (with pricing available on request).\n\nParallels states that it is seeing more and more Mac users running the macOS as a guest operating system on a VM, especially developers who need to test their apps with different versions of the macOS.\n\nParallels therefore supplies configuration options when creating VMs that run the macOS, providing greater freedom to configure the number of processors and the amount of memory used. Developers get a command-line interface to speed up testing, advanced networking features, and the ability to share folders and volumes between different versions of the macOS. There\u2019s even some TLC for Linux users, with improved handling of Mac trackpads, and faster installation for the popular Ubuntu version of Linux.\n\nThe version 20 update to Parallels Desktop Pro brings an assortment of new features for developers including the Parallels AI Package (available in all editions, apart from Standard). This will allow developers to create a ready-made virtual machine that includes 14 different sets of AI tools, along with code samples and instructions. It\u2019s even possible to use ordinary language commands \u2013 such as \u201cParallels, start my Windows 11 VM\u201d. These tools are designed to help all developers, including students and smaller teams, so that they can start experimenting with AI quickly and easily. There is also improved support for Microsoft\u2019s Visual Studio development tools, which now includes the use of Microsoft\u2019s CoPilot AI features within Windows. (www.parallels.com/products/desktop/ai/)\n\nVersion 19 brought several new features specifically aimed at developers including an extension for using Visual Studio code that makes it easier to organize and use multiple VMs, and improved support for creating VMs that run different versions of macOS.\n\nAs we mentioned above, Parallels has confirmed it is working on a feature that will also allow Macs with Apple Silicon to run the original Intel version of Windows. This will be a breakthrough for developers who want to work on both ARM and Intel platforms.\n\nThe Business Edition of Parallels Desktop includes several features to help IT departments in large organizations quickly roll out Parallels virtual machines to multiple users. There are improved security features, and, since version 19, those with the Business edition of Parallels Desktop can use their VMs with corporate management systems such as Hashicorp Packer and Microsoft\u2019s InTune.\n\nThe Enterprise Edition, coming later in 2024, will include a Management Portal that makes it easier to install and manage virtual machines for large numbers of users within an organisation. This Edition will also provide SOC Type 2 reports, which are used to maintain security standards within large organisations.\n\nGamers who want to run Windows games on a Mac can do so via Parallels Desktop, and are able to use game controllers with those games.\n\nThere has been support for DirectX 11 since Parallels Desktop 15. There is no DirectX 12 support yet.\n\nVersion 4.1 of OpenGL is also supposed.\n\nParallels Desktop is available in three different editions: Standard, Pro and Business.\n\nThe Standard edition is mainly aimed at home and educational users and costs $99.99/\u00a389.99 per year, with additional discounts also available for students and education users. That annual subscription fee includes any new versions and updates that may be released in the future. It\u2019s also possible to buy the standard edition with a perpetual license for a one-time fee \u2013 unfortunately this has increased from $129.99/\u00a3104.99 to $219.99/\u00a3154.99 with the 2025 edition. That price is a one-time fee that allows you to use the Standard Edition forever \u2013 with no recurring subscriptions \u2013 although you will need to pay an additional fee for any upgrades that are released in the future.\n\nThe Pro Edition and Business Edition are only available with a subscription, with the annual pricing remaining unchanged. The Pro Edition aimed at developers costs $119.99/\u00a399.99 while the Business Edition is $149.99/\u00a3119.99. Pricing for the new Enterprise Edition is available on request (parallels.com).\n\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that there\u2019s also a version of Parallels Desktop that is sold on the Mac App Store\u2013however, Apple imposes some serious technical limitations on this version so it\u2019s probably best to buy Parallels Desktop directly from Parallels itself.\n\nCan you use Parallels for Mac for free?\n\nThe Parallels website offers a 14-day free trial so that you can see how Parallels Desktop works before buying the full version. Just remember that you do still need to buy a license for Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise, which starts at a rather hefty $199.99/\u00a3219.99.\n\nCan you use Parallels Desktop on more than one Mac?\n\nTo use Parallels desktop on two or more Macs you will need to buy additional licenses. If you are just moving to a new Mac you can uninstall the software on the first Mac and install it on the new Mac.\n\nParallels isn\u2019t the only option available for running Windows on a Mac, but its constant cycle of regular updates has ensured that it continues to outpace rival virtualization programs, such as VMWare Fusion. It\u2019s also more straightforward to use than alternative technologies, such as CrossOver from Codeweavers.\n\nParallels keeps up with the latest developments on Macs with Apple Silicon to ensure that it remains one of the best options currently available for running Windows and Windows software on a Mac.\n\nIf you have an existing subscription to Parallels Desktop then, of course, you automatically get all the new features included in version 26 as part of your subscription. It\u2019s a shame, though, that the perpetual license option for the Standard Edition has increased in price, as there are many people who only need Parallels Desktop for occasional use and don\u2019t want to pay for a recurring annual subscription.\n\nGamers who want to play Windows games may also want to look at alternative options, such as the popular CrossOver from Codeweavers. However, Parallels Desktop 26 remains the best option for business and education users who need access to a wider range of Windows productivity software \u2013 especially as rivals, such as VMWare\u2019s Fusion, are falling behind with fewer regular updates.",

But it lacks the polish and ease of use of Parallels Desktop.\nPrice When Reviewed\nThis value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined\nBest Pricing Today\nFor many years Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion fought a long battle to produce the best virtualization software for Mac users who needed to run Windows software on their Macs. Every time Apple released a new version of the macOS we would see Parallels and VMware release their own updates, and this competition was great for Mac users because it meant that both programs continued to offer new features and performance improvements every year.\nIn recent years, though, VMware has seemed to focus more on its high-end corporate products and, since the introduction of Apple Silicon in 2020, Fusion no longer really competes with the annual updates to Parallels Desktop anymore. And, at the end of 2023, VMware was taken over by chip manufacturer Broadcom, which raised some questions about the future of Fusion on the Mac. Now that the take-over is complete, it does seem that Broadcom is still committed to the future development of Fusion \u2013 although its emphasis on corporate and enterprise users may deter some of the home users and students that have used the app in the past.\nFusion Pro price: How much does Fusion Pro cost and how to buy it?\nFor several years, Fusion was available with three different options, which depended on how you wanted to use the program. There was a basic version called Fusion Player that was free for non-commercial use, such as home users or students, although business users who needed additional technical support were also able to buy the Fusion Player with a commercial license for $149/\u00a3127.49. There was also a version called Fusion Pro that provided additional features for IT managers in larger organizations, which cost $199/\u00a3169.16.\nFollowing the take-over of VMware by Broadcom, the basic Fusion Player has now been discontinued, while Fusion Pro is now available with two different types of license. There is a free personal license for everyday users such as students and home users, and a paid Commercial license for business users, which costs $120 per year. The commercial model is available here and bundles VMware Desktop Hypervisor apps, Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro.\nUnfortunately, downloading Fusion Pro is a complicated and confusing process. You have to register for a free account on the Broadcom website, and then wade through a maze of support pages to find the actual download file \u2013 and matters aren\u2019t helped by the fact that Broadcom sometimes refers to Fusion Pro as Desktop Hypervisor instead. Broadcom is clearly more at home dealing with large corporate customers and IT managers, so it needs to simplify the download and installation process if it really does want to continue to attract everyday users.\nWhat is VMware Fusion Pro?\nLike Parallels Desktop, Fusion Pro is a virtualization program that allows you to create a virtual machine (VM) that runs on your Mac just like any other Mac application. This virtual machine uses software to simulate the hardware of a Windows PC, allowing you to install a full copy of Windows on the virtual machine and then run any Windows software or games that you need to use. And, crucially, you can run your Windows apps right alongside your existing Mac apps \u2013 rather than having to switch back and forth between Mac and Windows as you have to do when using Boot Camp on Intel Macs (and, of course, Boot Camp is no longer available on Macs with Apple Silicon at all). Both programs also allow you to create virtual machines that run other operating systems too, including several versions of Linux, which is a useful feature for many developers and students.\nVMware Fusion Pro: System Requirements\nFoundry\nThe only disadvantage of running Windows in a virtual machine on your Mac is that you\u2019re effectively running two operating systems on your Mac at the same time \u2013 the macOS and Windows side-by-side. You\u2019ll need a fairly fast Mac with plenty of memory and storage to get good performance for your Windows virtual machine. But, like Parallels Desktop, Fusion Pro does allow you to specify the amount of memory, and even the number of processor cores that you use to run the virtual machine so that you can fine-tune the performance of your virtual machine. There are also some differences between running Fusion Pro on Intel processors and Apple Silicon, but there\u2019s a comparison table that you can look at on the Broadcom website.\nHow to install Windows using Fusion Pro\nThis is where things get a bit complicated. If you\u2019re using an older Mac that has an Intel processor then you can use Fusion Pro to create a virtual machine on your Mac and then install the standard Intel version of Windows on the virtual machine. However, Apple\u2019s M-series of processors \u2013 also known as Apple Silicon \u2013 are completely different from Intel\u2019s processors, and are sometimes referred to as Arm processors as they\u2019re based on designs from a British company called Arm Holdings.\nMicrosoft has developed a separate version of Windows \u2013 called Windows On Arm \u2013 that will run on computers that use Arm processors, so Macs that have Apple Silicon processors need to install Windows On Arm instead. The problem here is that it\u2019s actually quite difficult to get hold of Windows On Arm, as Microsoft generally only sells it directly to large PC manufacturers or corporate customers that have volume licenses.\nFoundry\nParallels Desktop got around this problem a couple of years ago by providing the option to directly download Windows on Arm at the same time as creating a new virtual machine. VMware took longer to deal with this problem, and Fusion Pro only introduced the ability to download Windows On Arm with its version 13.5 update at the end of 2023.\nUnfortunately, we found that we received several error messages while trying to download Windows On Arm when using the most recent Fusion Pro 13.6 (and, on one occasion, Fusion Pro actually crashed while we were trying to download Windows). Even after creating a new virtual machine, you\u2019re faced with quite a lot of technical details, such as side channel mitigations and encryption and other settings that might seem quite daunting to less technical users. Parallels Desktop provides much greater ease of use here \u2013 although, of course, the option of using Fusion Pro with a Free Personal license will still appeal to many users.\nFusion Pro features\nOnce you\u2019ve created a virtual machine running Windows on your Mac, you\u2019ll see that the Windows desktop appears in its own window on your Mac screen, just like any other Mac app. Fusion used to include a feature called Unity that was able to hide the Windows desktop, just leaving individual Windows apps \u2013 such as the Edge browser \u2013 floating on your Mac desktop and looking just like ordinary Mac apps (similar to the Coherence feature found in Parallels Desktop). Unfortunately, the latest version of Fusion Pro no longer supports Unity, although it does provide the ability to quickly change the size and resolution of the virtual machine window. You can also expand it to full-screen size so that the Mac desktop is hidden and it looks as though your Mac is just running Windows (although you can still switch to any other Mac app whenever you want to, simply by using the standard Cmd-Tab keyboard shortcut).\nOther features available for your Windows virtual machine include the ability to drag and drop files between Mac and Windows, and to copy and paste information between files. There\u2019s also an option called Snapshots, which allows you to freeze the state of a Windows virtual machine \u2013 perhaps with several Windows apps still running \u2013 without fully shutting down Windows. This allows you to quit Fusion Pro if you need to, and then return to your Windows virtual machine later with your apps and files still running as they were before.\nAnd, since version 13.5, Fusion Pro also supports 3D graphics that use Microsoft\u2019s DX11 technology, which allows you to run a number of Windows games and graphics apps for professional design work (as long as you\u2019ve got a fast enough Mac). However, the newer DX12 \u2013 which is used in many recent games \u2013 is proving a tough nut to crack, both for Fusion Pro and Parallels Desktop, so neither program has a clear edge when it comes to running Windows games.\nShould you buy VMware Fusion Pro?\nOf course, the good news is that you can use Fusion Pro with a Free Personal license, making it a less expensive option than rival virtualization programs such as Parallels Desktop. However, it lacks the polish and ease of use of Parallels Desktop, and its increased emphasis on corporate users means that Fusion Pro may not appeal to everyday users as much as it has done in the past."

      "text": "Mac users who want to run Windows on their Macs have been able to do so since the arrival of the Intel processors in Macs back in 2006. Back then it was easy to use Apple\u2019s own Boot Camp software to boot a Mac up into Windows, at which point your Mac could run Windows apps as if it was a PC (more or less). Additionally, solutions like Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion allowed Macs to run Windows and Windows apps side-by-side with the macOS and Mac apps.\nHowever, in 2020 Apple started to transition from Intel processors to its own Apple Silicon processors. Now every Mac Apple sells uses one of its own M-series processors, which provide much better performance than the old Intel processors. Apple\u2019s new processors are based on ARM technology, rather than Intel\u2019s X-86 architecture though, and, as a result, these new Macs can\u2019t use Boot Camp to run Windows. They can still install Windows using virtualization technology, however.\nWhile Apple no longer offers its own solution for those wanting to run Windows on a Mac, Parallels Desktop, VMware Fusion and other third-party solutions do allow Windows to be installed on a Mac. Most of these solutions use virtualization technology to create a virtual machine \u2013 or VM \u2013 that can run Windows and Windows software on a Mac. A virtual machine is an ordinary Mac app, but it mimics \u2013 or emulates \u2013 the way that a Windows PC works, allowing you to run your Windows apps on the Mac desktop just like any other Mac app. We have tested a number of such options in our round-up of the Best Virtual Machine Software for Mac.\nBoot Camp is still an option if you have a Mac with an Intel processor. Read article on How To Install Windows On A Mac With An Intel Processor for help.\nWhat you need to run Windows on an M-series Mac\nIf you want to run Windows within a virtual machine on your Mac you need a fairly powerful Mac, with plenty of memory and storage space available. This is because you need to allocate some of your Mac\u2019s memory, storage space, and processor power to the virtual machine in order to install Windows and run your Windows apps properly. You probably won\u2019t be able to play the latest 3D games on your Mac using a Windows virtual machine, but you should be able to run many productivity apps, such as Microsoft Office, as well as quite a few design and graphics apps that may not be available on the Mac.\nThere is, however, one other complicating factor that you may have to face when trying to create a Windows virtual machine on an Apple Silicon-powered Mac. You can\u2019t install the standard version of Windows on a virtual machine if your Mac has an Apple Silicon processor* because that version of Windows is written for Intel processors. You need an ARM version of Windows. (*Strictly speaking, this is technically possible, but it\u2019s very difficult and you won\u2019t get very good performance).\nHow to get Windows for Apple Silicon Macs\nApple\u2019s M-series of processors are known as Arm processors because they are based on designs licensed from a U.K. company called Arm Ltd. There are other companies that make Arm processors as well, such as Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon chips, which are starting to appear in some of the latest Windows laptops. In order to make Windows work on these Arm processors, Microsoft has developed an alternative version of Windows known as Windows On Arm.\nIf your Mac has an Apple Silicon processor then you won\u2019t be able to create a virtual machine using the Intel version of Windows, but you can use Windows on Arm instead. The only problem here is that it\u2019s actually a little tricky to get hold of Windows on Arm, as Microsoft doesn\u2019t sell it direct to consumers and generally only licenses it to PC manufacturers such as HP, Lenovo or Dell. Fortunately, the team behind Parallels Desktop has been working closely with Microsoft, and has been approved by Microsoft as an official solution for running Windows on Macs with Apple Silicon.\nParallels Desktop, which was recently updated to version 20, allows you to download and install Windows 11 On Arm directly from Microsoft when you create a new virtual machine. You can then purchase a license for your copy of Windows from the Microsoft Store running within your virtual machine. That option isn\u2019t currently available with rivals such as VMware Fusion, so we\u2019ll focus on Parallels Desktop to show how this is done.\nRead our review of Parallels Fusion.\nHow to run Windows on a Mac (M-series and later)\nFoundry\nDownload Windows on Arm\nFoundry\nAs soon as you launch Parallels Desktop on a Mac that has Apple Silicon, the app provides some useful information about running Windows on Apple Silicon in order to help you get started.\nIt then asks if you want to download and install a copy of Windows 11 On Arm (as the Intel version of Windows won\u2019t run on Macs with Apple Silicon). Unfortunately, this option to download Windows On Arm isn\u2019t currently available within rival virtualization programs, such as VMWare Fusion.\nWhen you run your new virtual machine for the first time it will give you the option of purchasing Windows 11 On Arm from the Microsoft Store. If you\u2019ve already got a license for Windows 11 then you may be able to use that here, or you can buy a new license from within Parallels Desktop.\nConfigure your Virtual Machine\nFoundry\nOnce you\u2019ve downloaded Windows, you can create and configure your new virtual machine. You can choose how many of your Mac\u2019s processor cores to devote to running the VM \u2013 which is a key factor that will determine how fast the VM runs. You can also specify how much memory and storage space are allocated to the VM too.\nThere are lots of other settings, such as the ability to control the way Windows apps appear on the Mac desktop, or how Windows and Mac apps can share files. Fortunately, Parallels provides standard settings that generally work well, and you can then experiment and fine-tune your VM as you get used to working with it.\nRun Windows on your Mac\nFoundry\nHere\u2019s our Windows VM running on an iMac with a modest M1 processor. As you can see here, the VM starts off running in its own window, showing the standard Windows desktop. However, Parallels Desktop also provides a Coherence mode that hides this window and just shows your Windows apps floating on the main Mac desktop, just like ordinary Mac apps. You can adjust the viewing mode and other settings using the Parallels pulldown menu in the main Menu bar."

      "text": "There are a few reasons why you might want to download and install an old version of macOS or Mac OS X. Perhaps you\u2019re relying on software you have discovered doesn\u2019t work properly in the latest version. Perhaps your Mac has run slowly ever since you updated. Or maybe you just don\u2019t like the new version of macOS that you have installed. Either way, you have questions and we have answers.\nIn this article, we will cover how to get old versions of macOS, including Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, Catalina, Mojave, El Capitan, Sierra, Yosemite, and even old versions of Mac OS X. We explain how to get hold of the relevant installer files so that you can install the software on your Mac.\nJust note: if you were hoping to run Catalina, Mojave, or a version of macOS older than Big Sur on an M1 or later Mac, that\u2019s not possible.\nIf you are looking for a way to go back to the previous version of macOS, we have an article about reverting a macOS update.\nYou also might want to get the installer for a version of macOS to make a bootable installer for installing macOS on multiple Macs. We have a separate article that explains how to downgrade macOS when you get to that stage of the process.\nWhere to get older versions of macOS\nBefore you can install an older version of macOS or Mac OS X you will need to get hold of the installer for the version of macOS you want to install. Luckily it is possible to get ahold of these files, as long as you know where to go on the Mac App Store. If you\u2019re unsure of your Mac\u2019s compatibility, check out our list of which Macs run which versions of macOS & Mac OS X.\nIt is possible to download older versions of macOS from the Mac App Store. Click on the links to download the installers for the following macOS versions:\n*Note that we have discovered that the links we give below will only work if you are using Safari, so we suggest you switch to Apple\u2019s browser before moving on. You should also close the Mac App Store app if you have that open or the link may not work*\n- macOS Sonoma\n- macOS Ventura\n- macOS Monterey\n- macOS Big Sur\n- macOS Catalina\n- macOS Mojave\n- macOS High Siera\nFoundry\nOlder versions of macOS aren\u2019t available on the Mac App Store, but Apple does provide dmg files of them. You need to download them in Safari. A disk image named InstallOS.dmg will download and once it does you need to locate the pkg installer inside the disk image.\nWe discuss this process in more detail below.\nHow to download an older version of macOS for an M-Series Mac\nApple began transitioning away from Apple silicon with the release of macOS Big Sur in 2020, so any version of macOS before that won\u2019t run on an M1 Mac or later.\nIf you have a M1 or later Mac you will see a message that your Mac is not compatible with versions of macOS that predate Apple\u2019s move to its own silicon. All versions of macOS prior to Big Sur require an Intel Mac.\nHow to download macOS Sonoma, Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, Catalina, Mojave and High Sierra\nFoundry\nYou can download the installers for many versions of macOS from the Mac App Store. Follow these steps to download the version of macOS that you want from the Mac App Store. Use Safari and close the Mac App Store app if you have that open before you begin.\n- Follow the Mac App Store link above to the software you require. Use Safari and the Mac App Store will open on the page for the macOS version you require.\n- Click on Get.\n- Software Update will open with the words \u201cFinding Update\u201d. Eventually a message \u201cAre you sure you want to download macOS [name]\u201d will appear. It might look like an update rather than the full version, but you\u2019ll see from the size of the download (around 6GB) that this is the complete installer for macOS.\n- Once the installer has downloaded do not click \u201cInstall\u201d. If you do, the installer will automatically be deleted (plus it won\u2019t install if you are already running something newer).\n- You should be able to find the \u201cInstall macOS [name]\u201d app in your Applications folder, which you can use to downgrade macOS to an older version (see our separate tutorial).\nHow to download Sierra, El Capitan, Yosemite, Mountain Lion and Lion\nApple provides dmg files of these older macOS versions, but you need to download them using Safari. A disk image named InstallOS.dmg will download and once it does you need to locate the pkg installer inside the disk image.\nPrior to June 2021, you could purchase OS X 10.7 Lion or Mountain Lion from Apple for $19.99/\u00a319.99 each \u2013 Apple would send you a download code. Now Apple has stopped charging for the aging operating system versions. Instead, you can download the operating systems directly from the company along with these other versions.\nWe saw a warning about the connection not being private when trying to download these, this message is appearing because it\u2019s not an https connection, probably because these files predate that standard, but do exercise caution here. The links come from this Apple page so should be secure.\nHow to get Mac OS X Server\nApple discontinued macOS Server in April 2022. The last version was macOS Server 12 Monterey (version 5.12). Apple has published a support document in which is explains that despite being discontinued \u201cExisting macOS Server customers can continue to download and use the app with macOS Monterey.\u201d\nmacOS Server 12, 5.12 was available on the Mac App Store here, but Apple removed it. If you have previously downloaded it you may be able to get it again.\nMac OS X server 3.2.2 is listed on the Mac App Store here. It costs $19.99/\u00a319.99.\nWhat to do if the Mac App Store links above aren\u2019t working\nWe\u2019ve said above that in our experience usually the reason the above links don\u2019t work is if you are browsing in something other than Safari, or if you have already got the Mac App Store open. However, if you are still finding that the link isn\u2019t working you could try the alternative methods below.\nAnother issue is if the link takes you to the correct page in the Mac App Store, but you see an Update not found error message when you try to download it. This is an issue we are aware of that others have encountered, although we haven\u2019t. In that case, we suggest you try to download the installer via that link using an older Mac.\nYou may also encounter issues if you are trying to download an older version of macOS that your Mac cannot support. Usually, when Apple introduces a new Mac it will not be able to run the version of macOS that shipped before the one installed on that Mac. The older macOS might not support certain components in that Mac, for example.\nOther ways to get older macOS versions\nIf you are running an older version of macOS \u2013 or someone you know is \u2013 you should be able to easily find older versions of macOS and even Mac OS X in the Mac App Store. How easy they are to find will be determined by the version of macOS running on that Mac.\nPrior to macOS Mojave\u2019s arrival in 2018, the installers for the older macOS versions could be searched for or found via the Purchased tab (not that anyone has had to pay for a Mac OS X update for years).\nHowever, when Apple introduced Mojave the Mac App Store changed, and these installers can no longer be searched for or found in the purchased section of the store. (Although we do have redirect links in the section above to each of the relevant pages on the Mac App Store.)\nIf you happen to have access to a Mac that\u2019s running an older version of macOS, log into the Mac App Store with your password and download the Mojave installer on that Mac. Alternatively, ask a friend to download a copy of the installer from the Mac App Store for you. Once the installer has downloaded don\u2019t install it! If you do the installer will be deleted. You\u2019ll find the installer in your Applications folder from which you can copy it onto your Mac or create a bootable installer.\nYou may also find updates to an older version of macOS on Apple\u2019s website. However these are just point updates, rather than the full version, so it won\u2019t be much help if you are trying to get the full download.\nThe one thing you really mustn\u2019t do is go to a torrent site and download a copy of the macOS you want. Just because Apple gives away its software for free, don\u2019t think it\u2019s fine to just pick up a copy. Pirated copies of Apple software could have been adjusted to allow hackers access to the software and your Mac.\nHow to get OS X Snow Leopard\nIf your Mac has a version of macOS installed that is older than Snow Leopard you won\u2019t have access to the Mac App Store. For a number of years after Snow Leopard arrived all versions of Mac OS X arrived via the Mac App Store, those who never installed Snow Leopard had a problem: without Snow Leopard, they couldn\u2019t update.\nUntil 2021 Apple still sold a boxed version of Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard for $19.99/\u00a319.99 (at its launch in 2009 it cost $25/\u00a325). If you purchased Snow Leopard this way you were sent a physical box containing an optical disc \u2013 so you will need a CD/DVD drive to install it (which you will probably have if the Mac is that old).\nApple has now removed the ability to buy Snow Leopard. However, this isn\u2019t a big problem because those people who were previously locked out of updates can now download the Lion or Mountain Lion update via the links provided above.\nHow to get OS X Leopard or earlier\nIf the old version of the OS you are after predates Snow Leopard and you have a developer account you might be able to get it from developer.apple.com/downloads. If you search within the OS X category you should see downloads for all versions of OS X, at least from version 10.3 to 10.6.\nYou may be able to access the Developer section of the website, but you will only be able to access certain software downloads if your Apple ID is associated with a paid Apple Developer Program. It costs $99/\u00a379 a year to join the Apple Developer Program and you have to sign a nondisclosure agreement.\nYou could also try looking on Amazon or eBay to see if anyone is selling old versions of the Mac operating system or perhaps a Mac running one."

But, even so, there are still times when many Mac users need to run apps and software that are only available for Windows PCs. Perhaps your employer uses particular business software that\u2019s only available for Windows, or you may need to use a website that relies on some Windows-only technologies. Many developers need to test their apps and services on both Macs and PCs and, of course, there are all those A-List games that only run on Windows as well.\nIt used to be easy to install Windows on Macs, thanks to Apple\u2019s Boot Camp software and the fact that from 2006 to 2020 all Macs used the same Intel processors as Windows PCs. However, with the advent of M-series Macs, Boot Camp is no more, so if you want to run Windows on a Mac you need to consider one of the various virtualization options that we feature in our round-up of the Best Virtual Machine software for Mac.\nThe advent of Apple\u2019s own chips, aka Apple Silicon, also means that the standard version of Windows, designed for X-86 chips, won\u2019t run on Arm-based chips like Apple\u2019s M-series. If you want to run Windows on an M-series Mac you need the Arm version of Windows.\nOur top solution for running Windows on a Mac is Parallels Desktop. Read on to find out why in our full review of Parallels Desktop for Mac. Skip to the section about the latest version of Parallels Desktop if you are already familiar with the software and want to know what\u2019s new.\nWhat is Parallels Desktop for Mac\nParallels Desktop is referred to as a virtualization program, because it allows you to create a virtual machine on your Mac \u2013 sometimes known as a VM \u2013 which is essentially a piece of software that simulates the physical hardware of a Windows PC (process also known as emulation) and lets you run Windows on your Mac.\nOne of the benefits of a solution like Parallels Desktop is it allows you to run Mac and Windows apps side by side, without having to reboot your Mac to switch between the macOS and Windows (which you had to do with Boot Camp).\nFoundry\nParallels gives you a lot of control over how you integrate Windows on your Mac. You could choose to keep Windows and macOS completely separate, with a full Windows desktop window floating on the Mac desktop, or the Windows VM can be expanded to full-screen size to hide the Mac desktop. But you can also use Coherence mode to run your Windows apps on your Mac so that they integrate fully with your Mac apps\u2013you can even add them to your Dock.\nYou can run more than Windows as a VM on your Mac with Parallels Desktop. You can create a VM that runs Linux, or even a VM that runs a different version of macOS itself. This can be useful for developers who need to test a website or an app on different versions of the macOS, although it\u2019s currently only possible to create VMs that run Monterey (macOS 12.0) or later on Macs with Apple Silicon. However, Intel-based Macs can go right back to Mac OS X 10.7 Lion\u2013we have the details of how to find old versions of macOS here.\nAnother useful feature of Parallels is Rollback mode, which lets you run Windows (or Linux, or macOS) like a kiosk. What this means is that nothing is saved and after you have finished working and restart the computer the VM will return return to it\u2019s original state, this is perfect for developers who can experiment and then return to a clean slate.\nInstalling Windows using Parallels Desktop\nParallels makes installing Windows really easy. Since Parallels Desktop version 18 it has been possible to download and buy the ARM version of Windows 11 directly within Parallels. You do need to buy a license for the ARM version of Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise in order to create a Windows VM on Macs with Apple Silicon processors \u2013 unfortunately, the less expensive Home edition isn\u2019t supported \u2013 although it\u2019s also possible to use an existing license if you have one available. Microsoft doesn\u2019t differentiate between Windows On Intel and Windows On Arm, so a Windows 11 license can be used for either version.\nThis is a big deal because the Arm version of Windows isn\u2019t normally licensed to individual users. Fortunately, Parallels has worked closely with Microsoft to simplify the process of creating VMs that use the ARM version of Windows. Just select the File/New command to create a new VM (or press the \u2018+\u2019 button in the program\u2019s main Control Centre window) and it will present you with a big button labeled: Get Windows 11 From Microsoft.\nWindows 11 On ARM allows you to run most older software and apps that were originally written for the Intel version of Windows, so you shouldn\u2019t have any compatibility problems when running virtual machines that use Windows On ARM.\nParallels Desktop 20.2.0 added the ability for Macs with Apple Silicon to run the original Intel version of Windows. That will be useful for developers who want to work on both ARM and Intel platforms. The feature is available in the Pro, Business and Enterprise editions.\nOlder Intel-based Macs can still run Windows 10 via Parallels, although older versions of Windows are no longer supported.\nRead our guide to How to use Parallels Desktop to run Windows on a Mac for more information.\nParallels Desktop system requirements\nSince your Mac is effectively running two operating systems at the same time\u2013the macOS and Windows\u2013so you\u2019ll need a reasonably fast Mac with plenty of memory, disk space and \u2013 above all \u2013 processor power in order to run your virtual machines efficiently.\nFortunately, modern multi-core processors like Apple\u2019s M-series of chips can run routine apps such as the Windows versions of Microsoft Word or Excel using virtualization with no trouble at all, and faster Mac models can do a pretty good job running 3D games or high-end tools for design and graphics work.\nYou do need plenty of memory to run the macOS and Windows alongside each other though. Parallels Desktop generally recommends a minimum of 1-2GB for each VM, but that really is the absolute minimum, and it\u2019s in addition to the memory that your Mac needs just to run the macOS, so if you\u2019ve got a Mac with just 8GB of memory then you\u2019re not going to get the best possible performance when running Windows in a VM.\nJuggling memory and processor cores can be confusing for less experienced users, but Parallels Desktop can help by recommending settings that will be suitable for running different types of Windows apps and software. On high-end Macs, such as the Mac Studio, you can configure your virtual machines to use up to 62GB of memory and 18 CPU cores for improved performance. Unfortunately, Parallels informed us that the multiple GPU cores on Apple Silicon chips are controlled solely by the macOS itself, so Parallels doesn\u2019t currently allow you to also specify the number of GPU cores used by your virtual machines.\nParallels Desktop update: What\u2019s in Parallels Desktop 26 for Mac?\nNew versions of Parallels Desktop are always released to coincide with the latest updates to the macOS every year (with occasional mid-year updates, such as the recent v20.2, also thrown in for good measure). This year\u2019s release arrives just ahead of the new macOS 26 \u2013 aka Tahoe \u2013 and it also adopts Apple\u2019s new version numbers, which means that the latest version is now called Parallels Desktop 26. And, along with the existing Standard, Pro and Business Editions, there\u2019s also a new Enterprise Edition for larger organisations.\nAs you\u2019d expect, Parallels Desktop 26 is fully compatible with macOS 26 Tahoe, and includes technical updates that allow it to run smoothly with the new system for handling background processes that has been introduced with macOS 26. And, when creating a Windows virtual machine (VM), it\u2019s also compatible with the latest Windows 11 25H2 as well. Windows virtual machines can also display the storage space that is available on the host Mac, making it easier to avoid slow-downs due to lack of storage on the VM.\nUsers of the Business Edition now have more detailed control over virtual machines deployed throughout their organisation, ensuring that settings such as shared folders, access to USB devices, and network usage can be enforced for all users. There\u2019s more help for IT managers who want to use Parallels\u2019 Single Application Mode, which allows them to install a single Windows app on their virtual machines, which then appears to run on the Mac desktop like a native Mac app, without exposing the full complexity of the Parallels Desktop interface. It\u2019s also possible to manage Windows updates within virtual machines by using the Jamf Pro management system, and the Business Edition has been audited for compliance with the latest SOC 2 Type II security standards.\nWhat was new in Parallels Desktop 20 for Mac?\nParallels Desktop 20 arrived in September 2024, bringing support for macOS Sequoia and new features in that version of macOS.\nParallels 20 included a number of new features that are only available to Mac\u2019s running Sequoia. With Sequoia as your Mac\u2019s main operating system \u2013 rather than just a guest running in a virtual machine \u2013 you have the ability to sign into a Mac virtual machine (VM) using your Apple ID, which will allow you to use your Apple email and other Apple services. And it is possible to use the Apple Intelligence-powered Writing Tools feature within Windows apps that arrived on Macs with an macOS 16 update.\nFoundry\nThere were performance improvements when using Parallels\u2019 file-sharing features to exchange files between your main Mac and your virtual machines. Macs with Apple Silicon also gained the ability to quickly save and restore snapshots of VMs (although the snapshots feature was already available when running Parallels on Macs with Intel processors in the past).\nParallels Desktop 20 was compatible with the 24H2 Windows 11 On Arm update which featured an improved Prism emulator to provide as much as 80% performance improvement when running some older Windows apps that were written for Intel processors. Prism is similar to Apple\u2019s Rosetta, which allows old Mac apps that were written for Intel processors to run on modern Macs with Apple Silicon \u2013 and, strictly speaking, this is an improvement provided by Microsoft within Windows 11 24H2, but it still benefited Parallels users by speeding up older Windows apps running within a virtual machines.\nAs mentioned above, Parallels Desktop 20.2.0 added the ability for Macs with Apple Silicon to run the original Intel version of Windows.\nWhat was new in Parallels Desktop 19 for Mac?\nParallels Desktop 19 arrived in August 2023 and introduced a redesigned interface with windows and dialogue boxes that adopted the curved lines and candy colors of macOS. More serious eye candy also arrived with support for 3D graphics in Windows using OpenGL 4.1, improving compatibility and performance for some important graphics and design programs, such as ArcGIS Pro, VectorWorks and VariCAD. The 2023 update also brought Touch ID to Windows virtual machines, allowing users to sign in to a Windows VM using both Touch ID and a personal Microsoft account.\nApple changed the printing system used in Sonoma, so Parallels Desktop 19 also introduced a new Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) to allow users to print documents from a virtual machine using their normal printer.\nParallels Desktop 19.2 brought a faster option for cloning VMs. That\u2019s useful for developers and professional users who may need to create multiple VMs based on an existing template. It also improved the ability to use Sign In With Apple to sign in to a Parallels account using hardware security keys that users may have created on their Mac. The introduction of Sonoma changed the way the macOS handles Windows disk formats, causing some VMs to become unstable when running from an external hard drive or SSD, so version 19.2 also fixed this problem to improve the stability of VMs on external drives.\nAnd, in March 2024, the program was updated to version 19.3. This fixed graphics problems that had affected a number of well-known Windows games, such as Dark Souls II and Genshin Impact. Gamers should be aware, though, that (at the time of writing) Parallels is still working on support for Microsoft\u2019s DirectX 12 graphics software, and Parallels Desktop is still limited to games that use DirectX 11.\nParallels Desktop Pro vs Standard, Business vs Enterprise\nParallels Desktop has traditionally been available in three separate versions, with the Standard Edition designed for home users and education, the Pro Edition for developers, and the Business Edition for corporate users. However, 2024 sees the arrival of a new Enterprise Edition, which is due for release \u2018later this fall\u2019 (with pricing available on request).\nFeatures for developers\nParallels states that it is seeing more and more Mac users running the macOS as a guest operating system on a VM, especially developers who need to test their apps with different versions of the macOS.\nParallels therefore supplies configuration options when creating VMs that run the macOS, providing greater freedom to configure the number of processors and the amount of memory used. Developers get a command-line interface to speed up testing, advanced networking features, and the ability to share folders and volumes between different versions of the macOS. There\u2019s even some TLC for Linux users, with improved handling of Mac trackpads, and faster installation for the popular Ubuntu version of Linux.\nThe version 20 update to Parallels Desktop Pro brings an assortment of new features for developers including the Parallels AI Package (available in all editions, apart from Standard). This will allow developers to create a ready-made virtual machine that includes 14 different sets of AI tools, along with code samples and instructions. It\u2019s even possible to use ordinary language commands \u2013 such as \u201cParallels, start my Windows 11 VM\u201d. These tools are designed to help all developers, including students and smaller teams, so that they can start experimenting with AI quickly and easily. There is also improved support for Microsoft\u2019s Visual Studio development tools, which now includes the use of Microsoft\u2019s CoPilot AI features within Windows. (www.parallels.com/products/desktop/ai/)\nVersion 19 brought several new features specifically aimed at developers including an extension for using Visual Studio code that makes it easier to organize and use multiple VMs, and improved support for creating VMs that run different versions of macOS.\nAs we mentioned above, Parallels has confirmed it is working on a feature that will also allow Macs with Apple Silicon to run the original Intel version of Windows. This will be a breakthrough for developers who want to work on both ARM and Intel platforms.\nFeatures for businesses\nFoundry\nThe Business Edition of Parallels Desktop includes several features to help IT departments in large organizations quickly roll out Parallels virtual machines to multiple users. There are improved security features, and, since version 19, those with the Business edition of Parallels Desktop can use their VMs with corporate management systems such as Hashicorp Packer and Microsoft\u2019s InTune.\nThe Enterprise Edition, coming later in 2024, will include a Management Portal that makes it easier to install and manage virtual machines for large numbers of users within an organisation. This Edition will also provide SOC Type 2 reports, which are used to maintain security standards within large organisations.\nFeatures for gamers\nFoundry\nGamers who want to run Windows games on a Mac can do so via Parallels Desktop, and are able to use game controllers with those games.\nThere has been support for DirectX 11 since Parallels Desktop 15. There is no DirectX 12 support yet.\nVersion 4.1 of OpenGL is also supposed.\nParallels Desktop for Mac pricing\nParallels Desktop is available in three different editions: Standard, Pro and Business.\nThe Standard edition is mainly aimed at home and educational users and costs $99.99/\u00a389.99 per year, with additional discounts also available for students and education users. That annual subscription fee includes any new versions and updates that may be released in the future. It\u2019s also possible to buy the standard edition with a perpetual license for a one-time fee \u2013 unfortunately this has increased from $129.99/\u00a3104.99 to $219.99/\u00a3154.99 with the 2025 edition. That price is a one-time fee that allows you to use the Standard Edition forever \u2013 with no recurring subscriptions \u2013 although you will need to pay an additional fee for any upgrades that are released in the future.\nThe Pro Edition and Business Edition are only available with a subscription, with the annual pricing remaining unchanged. The Pro Edition aimed at developers costs $119.99/\u00a399.99 while the Business Edition is $149.99/\u00a3119.99. Pricing for the new Enterprise Edition is available on request (parallels.com).\nIt\u2019s worth mentioning that there\u2019s also a version of Parallels Desktop that is sold on the Mac App Store\u2013however, Apple imposes some serious technical limitations on this version so it\u2019s probably best to buy Parallels Desktop directly from Parallels itself.\nCan you use Parallels for Mac for free?\nThe Parallels website offers a 14-day free trial so that you can see how Parallels Desktop works before buying the full version. Just remember that you do still need to buy a license for Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise, which starts at a rather hefty $199.99/\u00a3219.99.\nCan you use Parallels Desktop on more than one Mac?\nTo use Parallels desktop on two or more Macs you will need to buy additional licenses. If you are just moving to a new Mac you can uninstall the software on the first Mac and install it on the new Mac.\nShould You Buy Parallels Desktop?\nParallels isn\u2019t the only option available for running Windows on a Mac, but its constant cycle of regular updates has ensured that it continues to outpace rival virtualization programs, such as VMWare Fusion. It\u2019s also more straightforward to use than alternative technologies, such as CrossOver from Codeweavers.\nParallels keeps up with the latest developments on Macs with Apple Silicon to ensure that it remains one of the best options currently available for running Windows and Windows software on a Mac.\nShould you update to Parallels Desktop 26?\nIf you have an existing subscription to Parallels Desktop then, of course, you automatically get all the new features included in version 26 as part of your subscription. It\u2019s a shame, though, that the perpetual license option for the Standard Edition has increased in price, as there are many people who only need Parallels Desktop for occasional use and don\u2019t want to pay for a recurring annual subscription.\nGamers who want to play Windows games may also want to look at alternative options, such as the popular CrossOver from Codeweavers. However, Parallels Desktop 26 remains the best option for business and education users who need access to a wider range of Windows productivity software \u2013 especially as rivals, such as VMWare\u2019s Fusion, are falling behind with fewer regular updates."

Learn more: https://kb.parallels.com/en/123796.\nWhat\u2019s New\nVersion 1.20.4\nParallels Desktop for Mac App Store Edition 1.20.4 (23908) update addresses the overall stability and security issues and includes the following additions and improvements:\n## Windows\n- Introduces support for using Dragon Medical One macros (step-by-step commands) in Mac apps (e.g., Epic Hyperspace).\n- Fixes the issue that produced black screens when waking a Windows 11 virtual machine from sleep mode on Intel Macs.\n- Fixes the issue that prevented the \u201cSend with Windows Email App\u201d feature from working correctly with Microsoft Outlook when attempting to send a file from your Mac using the Windows virtual machine email client.\n## Linux\n- Fixes the issue that prevented Ubuntu 25.04 virtual machines with Parallels Tools for Linux installed from accessing files in the host Mac\u2019s shared folders.\n- Fixes the issue that caused black screens when moving app windows in Ubuntu 24.04.\n## What will be deprecated or removed from Parallels Desktop soon\nAccording to statistics from users who participate in the Parallels Customer Experience program, some product features are rarely used or not at all. We have decided to either stop supporting them or altogether remove them from Parallels Desktop and focus on frequently used features and further enhancements.\nBelow is the list of features that are no longer supported and will be removed \u2013 **not in version 1.20.4**, but in **the next major version** of Parallels Desktop for Mac App Store Edition:\n- Installing Parallels Desktop on Macs running macOS Monterey 12.\n- Travel mode.\n- **Free Up Disk Space** menu option. You will still be able to save space using other options.\n- Synchronization of virtual machine color tags between the Parallels Desktop Control Center and macOS Finder.\n- The option to install Parallels Toolbox for Windows in a Windows virtual machine using the Parallels Desktop menu.\nRatings and Reviews\nAwesome Software\nEasy installation, awesome integration with the host Mac. Having Windows 11 in the PD VM has its challenges - the most difficult of all is trying to share home folders such as downloads and documents etc from the host Mac system with Windows 11. The prompt to Allow the home folders as shared would beep at me every time I clicked on the Allow button. I eventually found that it would allow me to share the folders if I had the actual Virtual Machine .pvm archive inside the Host MacOS user\u2019s home folder. There is nothing on the internet about such a solution so I don\u2019t know if what I did was correct, but it works and it doesn\u2019t seem too hacky. Another issue is using shortcuts in the virtual machine such as CTRL+<- (CTRL and Left Arrow) to move the caret a whole word left in a document editor, because that combination seems to be reserved to move the desktop view from the Virtual Machine to MacOS desktop. I have tried all sorts of shortcut forwarding in the preferences, but it doesn\u2019t work. Probably just me being a noob. Either way, the Windows 11 setup on a MacOS is a fantastic experience and WELL worth the money! Mac Mini M4 Silicon running Sequoia.\nWithout Parallel\nExcellent easy to use product and saves carrying my old windows laptop around as I can run everything just as well on my Macbook Pro.\nWished I had discovered this earlier.\nBasic VM software let down by image library\nMostly this tool does what a virtual machine manger should.\nHowever the library of pre-configured machines is flawed. For example the instructions to access your newly created Ubuntu 22 VM via the Grub menu are not complatible with the version of image that they have provided. I suspect that their testing of the VMs in their library is limited and the result is that a job which should take no more than the time to download the image actually takes an hour because you end up trawling the internet for \"how to fix\" posts. Very poor, these images should just work out of the box.\nApp Privacy\nThe developer, Parallels International GmbH, indicated that the app\u2019s privacy practices may include handling of data as described below.

      "text": "At a glance\nExpert's Rating\nPros\n- 14-day free trial\n- Doesn\u2019t require a full version of Windows\n- Improved interface and ease of use\n- Regular updates, good technical support\nCons\n- Some Windows apps aren\u2019t compatible\n- Can be complicated to use\n- Requires Rosetta on Apple Silicon\nOur Verdict\nCodeweavers is one of the simplest ways to run Windows apps on a Mac, and you don\u2019t even need Windows.\nPrice When Reviewed\nThis value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined\nBest Pricing Today\nCrossOver is based on WINE, which is one of the best options for running Windows software on your Mac. And, like WINE, it uses a compatibility layer that allows Windows apps to run on the Mac without actually requiring a full version of Windows to be installed as well. That can save you a lot of money, as you do need to buy a copy of Windows for use with virtualisation programs such as Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion. But although WINE is a free, open-source program, it\u2019s too complicated for most non-technical users, so the team at Codeweavers developed CrossOver as a more straightforward and user-friendly alternative. They also provide good technical support to help with installing a wide variety of Windows games and software.\nSee how CrossOver compares to other Mac Virtual Machines we have tested in: Best Virtual Machine for Mac.\nOur review is updated for 2025 to take account of the new version: CrossOver 25.\nCrossOver Price\nThat technical support means that CrossOver isn\u2019t free, costing $74/\u00a360 for a license that provides 12 months of technical support and updates, or you can pay $494/\u00a3414 for lifetime support. However, there\u2019s a 14-day free trial available, so that you can see if it works with the Windows software that you want to run before buying (and there\u2019s also a version of CrossOver available for Linux as well).\nCrossOver Performance\nAt the moment, CrossOver is based on code that was originally written for Intel processors, so it relies on Apple\u2019s Rosetta to run on Macs with Apple Silicon, but performance still seems to be pretty good, and Codeweavers states that it is working on native support for Apple Silicon for the future.\nCrossOver works with a wide range of Windows software and apps, but many CrossOver users are dedicated Mac gamers, so much of Codeweavers\u2019 work is focused on getting it to work with popular Windows games. And, in fact, the Game Porting Kit that Apple provides to help games developers produce Mac versions of their games is based on open-source code from Codeweavers \u2013 so these guys really know what they\u2019re doing. There\u2019s also a database on their web site that provides compatibility information and advice for running hundreds of Windows apps and games.\nCrossOver Usability\nCrossOver has always aimed to be more user-friendly than WINE, by allowing you to install Windows apps into \u2018bottles\u2019 \u2013 which are self-contained files that can be launched and run on your Mac without requiring a full copy of Windows. You can create lots of different bottles for different apps, and bottles can even be configured to provide compatibility with different versions of Windows. This is useful as it allows you to create bottles that are suitable for older games and software that might require a particular version of Windows in order to run properly.\nEven so, CrossOver can still be quite complicated at times, so version 22 introduced a new interface that was redesigned to be more Mac-like, and also to provide more help when installing many Windows apps and games. When you launch CrossOver you see the main Install window, which lists some popular Windows apps and games, such as The Witcher 3 and Diablo IV, and even productivity tools such as the Quicken accounting software for business users.\nThere\u2019s also a search tool that provides information on hundreds of other Windows apps, and an indication of how well they run with CrossOver. But, as we discovered, there are degrees of compatibility here, with some apps that run well, while others may run with problems \u2013 and some may simply not work with CrossOver at all. But, somewhat to my surprise, I was able to install and run a 20-year old copy of Microsoft Publisher from an old DVD with no trouble at all, and also Icewind Dale II, an old favourite of mine that doesn\u2019t seem to be widely available these days.\nLatest CrossOver updates\nCrossOver continues to receive regular updates, many of which focus on improving support for specific Windows games. Version 22.1 fixed problems that were affecting games such as BioShock Infinite and Grand Theft Auto V, and version 23.0 introduced limited support for some games, such as Diablo IV, that use Microsoft\u2019s DirectX 12 graphics software (something that even Parallels Desktop is still working on). Diablo IV got a further performance boost with version 23.7, along with Counter Strike 2 and a number of other games, while version 24.0 provided compatibility with the latest version of WINE, as well as a number of additional interface improvements.\nHowever, the March 2025 launch of CrossOver 25 is one of the biggest updates of recent years, with CrossOver promising to bring \u201cnext level gaming to the Mac\u201d. Some of the new features in v25 are under-the-bonnet changes, such as adopting the latest version of the underlying WINE technology, which Codeweavers claims includes thousands of programming updates to improve performance and compatibility. This update also introduces a new graphics technology, called DXMT that, according to Codeweavers, provides better performance for less powerful Mac models when running Windows games that use DX11 graphics.\nThere\u2019s improved compatibility with lots of big-name Windows games, allowing you to play games such as Path Of Exile 2, Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2, and Fallout 76 for the first time. And, along with Steam, CrossOver 25 now supports the Windows versions of the GoG and Epic game stores so that you can download games that you own from those stores.\nCodeweavers also continues to further streamline the installation process for Windows games and apps for new users who may not have a lot of technical experience. As well as providing a list of popular games and other apps that work well with CrossOver, this new version now has the ability to connect to the compatibility database stored on the Codeweavers website, and can automatically apply the best graphics and audio settings for a variety of different games.\nShould you buy Codeweavers CrossOver?\nThe sheer effort that the Codeweavers team puts into providing regular updates for CrossOver is impressive, and we\u2019ve had good experiences using their tech support to get help running the Windows version of Steam on our ageing office iMac. Even so, CrossOver can still be rather complicated for new users, so it\u2019s definitely worth downloading the trial version to see how well it works with your favourite Windows games and other Windows software."

      "text": "Even the most loyal Mac users recognize that Windows still rules the roost in the world of desktop and laptop computers, and there are many important apps that only run on Windows. For example, the Windows version of Microsoft Office includes the Access database that has never been available for the Mac, and there are many professional graphics and video tools that are Windows-only. And, of course, there are all those A-List games that have never even glanced in the direction of us poor, forgotten Mac gamers.\nIf you need to run Windows software or games on your Macs then this article will reveal the best way to do so. We\u2019ll run through the best virtual machines for Mac, including Parallels and VMware, as well as looking at alternative options, from emulators that let you run Windows apps on a Mac without even installing Windows to Microsoft\u2019s Windows 365 service.\nCheck out our Best Virtual Machine for Mac: Parallels Desktop for Mac which is currently 25% off!\nRead on to discover the best options for running Windows, and Windows apps, on your Mac. You may also like to read our guide to How to install Windows and run Windows apps on a Mac (M-series models). We also cover how to run Windows on an Intel Mac separately.\nCan I run Windows on my Mac?\nIf you are one of the millions of people still using an Intel-based Mac you can use Apple\u2019s Boot Camp to run Windows. However, in 2020 Apple started using its own processors that are based on Arm architecture rather than the x86 architecture used by Intel. Now every Mac Apple sells has an Apple-made M-series processor. Boot Camp is not available on M-series Macs.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that M-series Macs can no longer run Windows, it just means they can\u2019t use Boot Camp and they need the Arm version of Windows. Although the latter is changing: Parallels Desktop version 20.2.0 introduced the limited ability to create virtual machines that run certain versions of Windows that were written for Intel processors. It\u2019s important to note, though, that Parallels currently refers to this ability as an \u2018early technology preview\u2019, and that it still has some major limitations.\nIf you want to run Windows on an M-series Mac. You can choose from virtualization options like Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion, or emulation solutions like CrossOver and Wine, and even Microsoft\u2019s Windows 365 service. You can read about all of these choices in our group test below as well as our individual reviews.\nOur top choice is Parallels Desktop, but all the others have some benefits that may suit you. For example, CrossOver doesn\u2019t actually need a copy of Windows to run Windows apps, and there are even free options like Whisky and Wine.\nWhat is a Virtual Machine?\nVirtualization programs such as Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion run on the macOS, but allow you to create a Virtual Machine (or VM) that mimics the hardware of a Windows PC. This makes it possible to create a VM on your Mac and then install Windows \u2013 or another operating system, such as Linux \u2013 on the VM. This is a great solution as it allows you to run the Windows apps that you need right alongside your main Mac apps as well. The only disadvantage is that you need a pretty fast Mac with plenty of memory and storage to run Windows as a VM, since it means that your Mac is effectively running two operating systems at the same time.\nWhat is emulation?\nEmulation is a process that allows individual Windows applications to run on a Mac without the need for the Windows operating system to be installed. This is achieved through emulation tools, such as Wine and CrossOver, which are typically used by technically proficient users.\nDo I need a Windows license?\nIt depends on which of those two methods you are using. If you are running Windows in a VM then you need a license in order to create a Windows VM on Macs with Apple Silicon processors, and, unfortunately, the less expensive Home edition isn\u2019t supported. However, it is possible to use an existing Windows license if you have one and Microsoft doesn\u2019t differentiate between Windows On Intel and Windows On Arm, see Parallel\u2019s website here.\nIf you are using emulation you won\u2019t need a copy of Windows.\nHow to get the Arm version of Windows\nIf you want to run Windows on a Mac with a M-series chip you will need the Arm version of Windows. (Although, as mentioned above, Parallels Desktop version 20.2 can run some versions of Windows that were written for Intel processors, albeit with some limitations (one being that it runs really slow).\nThe good news is that an Arm version of Windows does exist. Windows On Aar, aka WoA, is Microsoft\u2019s version of Windows is designed to run on ARM chips.\nThe Arm version of Windows isn\u2019t normally licensed to individual users. Fortunately, Parallels has worked closely with Microsoft to simplify the process of creating VMs that use the ARM version of Windows. With the arrival of Parallels Desktop 18 in 2022 Parallels gained the ability to download and buy the ARM version of Windows 11 directly within Parallels itself. Microsoft even endorsed Parallels for Windows on M1 and M2 Macs, effectively authorizing Parallels Desktop 18 users to run Arm versions of Windows 11 Pro and Windows 11 Enterprise. Read our full review of Parallels Desktop for more information.\nTo download and buy the ARM version of Windows 11 directly within Parallels itself. All you need to do is:\n- Press the button that says Get Windows 11 From Microsoft.\n- Parallels will download the relevant version of Windows 11 for your Mac (if your Mac has an ARM processor then it will download the ARM version of Windows 11).\n- You can then use the Microsoft Store app within your Windows VM to purchase a license or use an existing Windows 11 license if you have one.\nYou can also buy a license through the Download option from the Microsoft store.\nHow to run the X86 version of Windows on a Mac\nOne option, if your Mac has an M-series chip is Parallels Desktop \u2013 version 20.2.0 \u2013 but it will run slowly.\nIf you are looking to run Windows on a Mac that isn\u2019t powered by an Apple M-series chip, then you can download Windows 11 for free (as long as your Mac has the necessary specs, such as the Trusted Platform Module, to qualify for the free upgrade).\n- Download Windows 11 from Microsoft, free upgrade as long as you qualify.\nYou could take advantage of various deals for Windows 11 Pro including:\n- Windows 11 Professional, $79.99 (usually $199.99).\nBest Virtual Machine for Mac 2025: Best VMs to run Windows on a Mac\n1. Parallels Desktop\nPros\n- Frequent updates and new features.\n- Good performance on multi-core Apple chips.\n- Slick, easy-to-use interface.\n- Ability to run x86 Windows on M-series Macs.\nCons\n- Most editions require a subscription.\n- Virtual machines require a lot of memory and processor power.\n- Windows On ARM is expensive.\nParallels Desktop allows you to create a virtual machine on your Mac. The software simulates the physical hardware of a Windows PC and lets you run Windows on your Mac.\nOne of the benefits is Parallels Desktop allows you to run Mac and Windows apps side by side, without having to reboot to switch between the operating systems (which is necessary with Boot Camp).\nWith Parallels you can keep Windows and macOS completely separate or you can use Coherence mode to fully integrate your Windows apps on your Mac\u2013you can even add them to your Dock.\nParallels also offers a Rollback mode, which is useful for experimenting developers. Nothing is saved, so when you restart the computer the VM will return to it\u2019s original state.\nParallels makes installing Windows really easy. Since Parallels Desktop version 18 it has been possible to download and buy the ARM version of Windows 11 within Parallels. You do need to buy a license for the ARM version of Windows 11 Pro or Enterprise (unfortunately, the cheaper Home edition isn\u2019t supported).\nIf it\u2019s the old x86 version of Windows you want then Parallels has been working to support this on M-series Macs. The 20.2.0 update in January 2025 introduced the limited ability to create virtual machines (VMs) that run certain versions of Windows that were written for Intel processors (sometimes known as \u2018x86_64\u2019, referring to 64-bit software written for Intel\u2019s x86 processors). It\u2019s important to note, though, that this is an \u2018early technology preview\u2019, and that there are some major limitations such as a lack of sound and assigning a maximum of 8GB memory to each VM. It\u2019s also slow. But that\u2019s only going to apply to you if you are running an Intel version on an M-series Mac.\nParallels Desktop has a regular update cycle that tends to coincide with Apple\u2019s big macOS updates. Parallels Desktop 20 arrived in September 2024, bringing support for macOS Sequoia and it\u2019s new features, including the AI-powered Apple Intelligence features including Writing Tools feature within Windows apps.\nA number of new AI-specific features aimed at developers were introduced with the September 2024 update. A \u2018Parallels AI Package\u2019 allows developers to create a new virtual machine with a pre-installed set of AI tools and features, including the ability to control Parallels Desktop using plain language commands (more info here).\nA new Enterprise Edition provides security features for businesses that need to install and manage multiple virtual machines and users within their organization.\nRead our full Parallels Desktop for Mac review\n2. VMware Fusion\nPros\n- Fusion allows you to use it for free if it\u2019s for personal, home and student use.\nCons\n- VMware doesn\u2019t update Fusion as regularly as Parallels is updated.\nFor many years, VMware Fusion was in lock-step with Parallels Desktop, with the two rivals releasing regular updates and competing for the top spot in the Mac virtualization market. In recent years, though, VMware seems to have taken its foot off the pedal and has allowed Fusion to fall behind a bit (in fact, you actually have to dig around quite a bit simply to find Fusion on the VMware website these days).\nWhen Fusion version 13 arrived in November 2022, it brought support for ARM virtualization on Apple\u2019s M1 and M2-series chips. As is the case with Parallels Desktop, you can only run the Arm version of Windows on M-series Macs. Unfortunately, installing the Arm version of Windows via VMware isn\u2019t as simple as it is with Parallels, VMware told us that it\u2019s up to the user to buy a license from Microsoft (which is a challenge due to it not being available to individual users).\nVersion 13.5 arrived in October 2023 and with it much needed support for DirectX 11 3D graphics and an easier way to install Windows 11 on Arm via a \u201cGet Windows\u201d button. A year later and there is still no release date for VMware Fusion 14 though.\nAt the same time as launching Fusion 12, VMware also announced that it would release a free version of the program \u2013 called Fusion Player \u2013 for personal use only, for home users and students. It\u2019s now changed this strategy and is offering the Fusion Pro for free as long as it is for personal use. You\u2019ll need to register for a VMware account, but Fusion Pro is free to download here.\nWhile Fusion hasn\u2019t kept up to date with the latest developments in Mac hardware and software, the availability of the free version of Fusion Pro still makes it a great option for home users and students who occasionally need to run Windows apps or games on their Intel Macs.\nRead our full VMware Fusion review\n3. Codeweavers CrossOver\nPros\n- 14-day trial.\n- Doesn\u2019t require a full version of Windows.\n- Improved interface and ease of use.\n- Regular updates, good technical support.\nCons\n- Some Windows apps aren\u2019t compatible.\n- Can be complicated to use.\n- Requires Rosetta on Apple Silicon.\nCrossOver is based on WINE (see below), and uses a similar compatibility layer to allow Windows apps to run on the Mac without requiring a full version of Windows to be installed as well (you need to buy a copy of Windows for use with virtualization programs such as Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion).\nAlthough WINE is a free, open-source program, it\u2019s complicated to use. In contrast, Codeweavers have developed CrossOver as a user-friendly alternative. A copy of CrossOver with a year of technical support is $74/\u00a360, or you can pay $494/\u00a3414 for lifetime support. There is a 14-day free trial available.\nWith CrossOver you install Windows apps in Bottles, which are self-contained files that can be launched and run on your Mac without requiring a full copy of Windows. You can create lots of different bottles for different apps, and bottles can even be configured to provide compatibility with different versions of Windows. This is useful as it allows you to create bottles that are suitable for older games and software that might require a particular version of Windows in order to run properly.\nSimplifying things further, CrossOver has a Mac-like interface and offers assistance for installing Windows apps and games. For example, when you launch CrossOver you see the main Install window, which lists popular Windows apps and games, such as Grand Theft Auto V and the Quicken accounting software for business users. You can even search for information on hundreds of Windows apps, and get an indication of how well they run with CrossOver.\nCrossOver 25 (March 2025) was one of the biggest updates of recent years, promising to bring \u201cnext level gaming to the Mac\u201d. Some of the new features in v25 are under-the-bonnet changes, such as adopting the latest version of the underlying WINE technology, which Codeweavers claims includes thousands of programming updates to improve performance and compatibility. This update also introduces a new graphics technology, called DXMT that, according to Codeweavers, provides better performance for less powerful Mac models when running Windows games that use DX11 graphics.\nThere\u2019s improved compatibility with lots of big-name Windows games, allowing you to play games such as Path Of Exile 2, Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2, and Fallout 76 for the first time. And, along with Steam, CrossOver 25 now supports the Windows versions of the GoG and Epic game stores so that you can download games that you own from those stores.\nCrossOver is based on code written for Intel processors, so it relies on Apple\u2019s Rosetta to run on Macs with Apple Silicon, but we found that performance was pretty good regardless. Codeweavers says that it is working on native support for Apple Silicon.\nThe Codeweavers team puts a lot of effort into regular updates for CrossOver and the tech support is impressive. Even so, CrossOver can still be a little daunting at times, so it\u2019s worth downloading the trial version to see how well it works with your favorite Windows games and other Windows software.\nRead our full CrossOver for Mac review\n4. Whisky\nPros\n- Free, open-source app\n- Works with Apple\u2019s Game Porting Toolkit\n- Supports DX12\nCons\n- Supports fewer games than CrossOver\n- No technical support\n- Requires macOS 14 (Sonoma)\nIt the main reason you want to run Windows on your Mac is so you can play Windows games on your Mac this is the solution for you.\nWhisky emerged following Apple\u2019s launch of the Game Porting Toolkit in 2023 and is based on GPTK and is focused on running Windows games rather than more serious business software that the other VM solutions focus on.\nWhisky isn\u2019t an emulator or virtualization program, like Parallels Desktop or UTM. Rather than letting you run Windows on a virtual machine, it\u2019s more like CrossOver in that it allows you to run a variety of Windows apps and software on your Mac without needing to install Windows. CrossOver and Whisky \u2013 and even Apple\u2019s Game Porting Toolkit \u2013 are all based on the open-source WINE (see below for our review of WINE), which acts as a translation layer that converts the programming code in Windows apps and software into the Mac equivalent (a bit like Apple\u2019s own Rosetta software, which translates software written for older Intel Macs to run on Macs with Apple Silicon processors).\nWhisky is a free, open-source alternative to CrossOver (CrossOver is also open-source, but has a $64 annual \u2018license fee\u2019 for technical support).\nWhisky allows you to create bottles, which are files that act as a container for the Windows apps you want to run. The bottles provide compatibility with various versions of Windows (right back to Windows 7 and XP for 32-bit era games). Once a bottle is created press Run to launch the installer program for the Windows game and that game then becomes part of that bottle. Whisky also allows you to install the Windows version of Steam within a bottle and install Windows games that you own on Steam in that bottle.\nIn comparison to CrossOver, Whisky isn\u2019t quite as easy to use, lacks the step-by-step help, and doesn\u2019t work with the same wide range of games, but Whisky still does an impressive job for a free open-source app that was developed by just one person (and a 17 year old one at that).\nIn our tests Whisky had no trouble at all with Call Of Cthulhu from 2018 and Guild Wars 2, providing very good performance on my MacBook Pro with M2 processor. Whisky supports a number of Windows games that use Microsoft\u2019s DX12 graphics software. However, it doesn\u2019t currently work with games such as Diablo IV and Fortnite. There\u2019s a list of compatible games on the Whisky website.\nRead our full Whisky review\n5. UTM Virtual Machines\nPros\n- Affordable/free option for running Windows on Mac\n- Runs on Intel and Apple Silicon\n- Runs older versions of Windows and Linux\nCons\n- More complex than its rivals\n- No tech-support\nUTM Virtual Machines from Turing Software is currently sitting at no.1 on the Business section of the Mac App Store. It costs $9.99/\u00a39.99 on the Mac App Store, but, because UTM is an open-source project, there\u2019s also a free version\u2013simply called UTM\u2013available on the Turing website.\nUTM can run on Macs with either Intel or Apple Silicon processors (running macOS Big Sur 11.3 or later). It provides two different options depending on the type of Mac you\u2019re using\u2013virtualization and emulation.\nSo, if you have an Intel Mac, UTM can use virtualization to create a virtual machine that runs the Intel version of Windows. And, if you have a Mac with Apple Silicon you can use virtualization to create a virtual machine that runs Windows On Arm. But, if you want to run the older Intel version of Windows on a Mac with Apple Silicon, then UTM will use emulation in order to run Window since that version isn\u2019t designed for the Mac processors. Virtualization provides better performance, but emulation is useful if you need to run Windows apps or software that require a specific version of Windows.\nHaving those two options available within UTM makes it a more versatile than Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion, which focus on virtualization rather than emulation. However, this adds complexity to UTM, and the app lacks the polished interface and ease of use of Parallels and VMware. You\u2019ll need a basic understanding of Windows disk image files, such as ISO and VHDX, in order to download and install your copy of Windows. Don\u2019t expect the level of step-by-step help available in Parallels Desktop.\nPerformance is good, though. The one weakness is that UTM doesn\u2019t currently support 3D graphics acceleration on its Windows virtual machines, which means that you won\u2019t be able to play most Windows games that have 3D graphics. But if you just want to run business apps or check out the new AI features in Windows, then UTM is a good, low-cost option that will appeal to developers and technical users.\nRead our full UTM Virtual Machines review\n6. Windows 365 Cloud PC\nPros\n- Can run Windows on your Mac and also your iPad or iPhone.\nCons\n- Needs a fast \u2013 and always on \u2013 Internet connection.\n- Expensive.\nWindows 365 (which launched in July 2021) has the potential to really challenge traditional virtualization programs such as Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion. However, at the moment, Windows 365 is still pretty expensive and is very much aimed at large corporate users, rather than the individuals and smaller businesses that tend to use Parallels and Fusion.\nMicrosoft describes Windows 365 as a Cloud PC, but its technical notes make it clear that Windows 365 is a form of virtual machine. The difference is that Parallels and Fusion create virtual machines that are stored locally on your Mac itself, and these virtual machines rely on your Mac\u2019s own processor power, memory and storage to run Windows and Windows apps.\nIn contrast, Windows 365 creates a virtual machine that is stored up in the cloud, and runs on Microsoft\u2019s own servers. The video image for the Windows desktop on your cloud PC is then streamed to your Mac \u2013 or any other device, such as an iPad or even another Windows PC \u2013 via your broadband connection.\nThis form of virtual machine can work well, as long as you have a fast enough \u2013 and always-on \u2013 Internet connection. But, as mentioned, Windows 365 is quite expensive, with prices ranging from $31/\u00a326.40 to $66/\u00a356.20 per month. That\u2019s compared to $99.99/\u00a389.99 for a full year for the home user version of Parallels Desktop, while Fusion even has a completely free version for home users and students.\nWindows 365 certainly has appeal to larger businesses that want to provide a standardized cloud PC that their staff can connect to from any location that has an Internet connection \u2013 it\u2019s ideal for hybrid working and the \u2018new normal\u2019. However, it\u2019s too expensive for ordinary home users, students and smaller businesses, so existing users of Parallels and Fusion will probably want to stick with those apps for the time being.\nRead more here: How to use Windows 365 on Mac, iPad and iPhone.\n7. Wine\nPros\n- Free.\nCons\n- Not really for beginners.\nAs we mentioned above, the third technology option \u2013 after Boot Camp and virtualization \u2013 is Wine, which allows you to run Windows apps without Windows itself.\nVersion 8 of Wine arrived at the end of January 2023, like version 7.5 of Wine, which arrived in March 2022, Wine still runs on M1 and M2 Macs via Rosetta 2. Wine 8 includes support for the latest versions of the Vulkan graphics engine and Microsoft Direct3D. It also adds support for the OCSP networking protocol.\nIf you don\u2019t mind rolling up your sleeves and getting your hands a bit dirty, then Wine is an unusual but feasible option for running Windows software on your Mac.\nLike VirtualBox, Wine is an open-source program that you can download for free. However, it doesn\u2019t use conventional virtualization technology to create a virtual machine for installing Windows \u2013 in fact, Wine is the only program in this group that doesn\u2019t even require a copy of Windows at all.\nInstead, Wine acts as a kind of software middleman that translates the programming routines \u2013 called APIs \u2013 in Windows apps so that they can talk directly to macOS, without needing a full copy of Windows itself. And as you don\u2019t need a lot of extra memory or processor power in order to run Windows, you may find that Wine can actually provide better performance than using a virtual machine (especially for games and graphics apps).\nWine also gets very regular updates from a team of dedicated developers who provide the software for free.\nThe downside is that Wine can be spectacularly confusing for beginners \u2013 to the point where we can only really recommend it to hobbyists who like a bit of a challenge.\nCodeWeavers CrossOver for Mac is a little easier to use than Wine, despite being closely related to the software. But of course Wine is free, which is a big bonus.\n8. VirtualBox 7\nPros\n- Free for personal/educational use.\nCons\n- Won\u2019t run on M-series Macs.\n- VirtualBox hasn\u2019t officially been updated to run on macOS Monterey.\nThis open-source virtualization program is free for personal use \u2013 but more at home in a corporate environment.\nVirtualBox, in version 7.0.6 since January 2023, is a bit of a mixed bag. Like Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion, it allows you to create a virtual machine that can run Windows and Windows apps from within macOS itself.\nIf you want it for personal or educational use then VirtualBox is free \u2013 it\u2019s actually been made available as an open-source program by Oracle (Oracle also makes Wine available as an open-source program). You might think of Oracle as a big database company, but they basically own the core code for these solutions.\nThere are Linux and Windows versions of VirtualBox too, which allows you to use your virtual machines on many different types of computers (although you\u2019ll still need to pay for your own Windows license to get started).\nThe disadvantage of open-source software is that VirtualBox isn\u2019t as polished or easy to use as Parallels or Fusion. To be fair, the version 6.0 update tidied up its interface to make the initial setup of your virtual machines a little easier. It has also improved its support for audio and 3D graphics in Windows games and apps.\nVirtualBox is now in version 7. It doesn\u2019t yet support M1 or M2 Macs \u2013 unlike Parallels and VMware, Oracle has made no commitment as yet to getting the software running on an M-series Mac. But this version of VirtualBox does offer support for Windows 11, macOS Big Sur and Monterey \u2013 there isn\u2019t support for macOS Ventura yet though, which appears to be due to changes Apple made to kernel extensions.\nVirtualBox throws a lot of jargon at you and if you don\u2019t know the difference between a virtual hard disk and a virtual machine disk then you might find it a bit tricky to get started.\nAnd, as the program is free, you don\u2019t get any technical support \u2013 although there is a busy user forum where you can ask a few questions when you need to.\nTo be honest, Oracle is really aiming VirtualBox at large corporations that have a proper IT department to help them out. However, business users do need to pay \u00a340/$50 for the VirtualBox Enterprise edition, and you may need to commit to buying 100 licenses at a time, which pretty much rules it out for all but the largest businesses, or educational users who are prepared to tackle the free version.\n9. Apple Boot Camp\nPros\n- Windows can run at full speed because its not being run at the same time as macOS.\nCons\n- Intel only. Absent from M-series Macs.\n- You can\u2019t run Windows and macOS at the same time.\n- You can\u2019t run Windows 11.\nUsing dual-boot rather than virtualization technology, Boot Camp provides the best performance for Intel-based Macs that need to run Windows. (As we explained above, M1 or later Macs do not offer Boot Camp).\nIt\u2019s important to make a distinction between Boot Camp and the virtualization programs that we look at here, such as Parallels Desktop, VMware Fusion and VirtualBox. Instead of creating a virtual machine that allows you to run Mac and Windows apps together at the same time, Boot Camp is a dual-boot system that simply allows you to boot (start) your Mac using either the native macOS or Windows (but not both at the same time).\nThanks to Boot Camp your Mac can act as a straightforward Windows PC, and devote all its processor power and memory to running Windows and your Windows apps. And, crucially, if your Mac has a decent graphics card, it can use the full power of the graphics card to help run your Windows software. That\u2019s definitely the best option for people who need to run high-end graphics software or 3D games, as you get much better performance than when running Windows in a virtual machine.\nThe disadvantage of using Boot Camp is that you lose access to all your Mac apps while you\u2019re running Windows. If you use Apple Mail for your emails then you\u2019ll need to shut down Windows and Boot Camp, and switch back to macOS every time you want to send or receive an email. And, if truth be told, the current version of BootCamp 6.1 isn\u2019t quite as straightforward to set up as it used to be.\nPrevious versions of Boot Camp did all the work for you \u2013 they would partition your hard drive, install Windows from a normal installer disk, and also install any driver software that you needed so that components such as your graphics card, keyboard and mouse all worked properly within Windows.\nBoot Camp 6.1.19 (as of August 2022) can only be used to install Windows 7, Windows 8.1 or Windows 10. Windows 11 requires the host computer to have a TPM (trusted platform module) which Macs don\u2019t have (some VM solutions, such as Parallels, can allow Macs with a T2 chip to run Windows 11). Since not all Macs will work with all versions of Windows, so before you even start to run the Boot Camp Assistant you\u2019ll need to check the compatibility tables on Apple\u2019s website to see which version of Windows will work on your Mac.\nYou can\u2019t install Windows from an old installer disk anymore either, so you\u2019ll either have to download a disk image file for Windows \u2013 called an ISO file \u2013 from Microsoft\u2019s own website, or use your Windows disk to create one. Boot Camp includes driver software for setting up Windows 8 and Windows 10, but if you\u2019re a fan of Windows 7 (which some people prefer for gaming) then you\u2019ll have to hunt around on Apple\u2019s website for the drivers you need and make sure you follow the correct procedure when copying them on to your Boot Camp partition.\nStill, if you persevere with all that, you will eventually have Windows running at full speed on your Mac, giving you access to a wide range of Windows software and games that require more power and speed than you can get from using virtual machine technology. Just as long as you don\u2019t have an M1 Mac\u2026\nFor more advice about accessories and software for your Mac, iPad or iPhone see all our Best Picks."

      "text": "Like its counterparts on the other Apple devices, macOS is getting a brand new look for 2025-2026 along with a new name. Because Apple is aligning the names of all the operating systems this year, the new version of macOS be called macOS 26 rather than macOS 16. It will also take the name Tahoe, inspired by the lake, beaches and the ski resorts of that area of California.\nAlong with a big redesign, macOS 26 brings new Continuity features to bring your iPad, iPhone and Mac even closer together, a brand new Phone app and more. Spotlight also gets its biggest ever update with the ability to action things like sending emails directly from Spotlight.\nWe expect that it will be possible to install these new features on your Mac before the end of September 2025, but if you would like to try them out now you can. A developer and public beta are out now. We have more information about joining the beta and the release date of the public beta below.\nYou will find all the things you need to know about the new macOS Tahoe below, including which Macs are compatible with macOS 26 and the new features you can expect. So, stay tuned to this superguide for everything you need to know about macOS 26 Tahoe, the latest version of the beta and all the new features that are coming.\nmacOS 26 Tahoe release date\n- Date TBD: 15 September 2025 predicted\nApple\u2019s official release of macOS 26 Tahoe will be in the fall, as is usually the case. We don\u2019t know the release date for sure, but we can estimate that it will coincide with the release of the new iOS update, which will probably happen a few days after the iPhone event in September 2025. We anticipate the September iPhone event and the launch of the launch of the iPhone 17 will take place on September 9, so the software could be out around September 15 or 16.\nHowever, Apple has previously scheduled the update to macOS after iOS, sometimes as short as a week, sometimes as long as a month, so there could be a longer wait with an October release possible.\nYouTube / Apple\nmacOS 26 Tahoe Beta release date\n- Latest Developer beta version: Beta 8, August 25\n- Latest Public beta version: Beta 5, August 25\nYou don\u2019t have to wait until the full release to try the new software out. Apple runs a developer beta as well as a public beta, so if you want to try out the new features before they are released to the general public, you will be able to do so. Both betas are free, though the developer beta requires a free registration as a developer.\nApple issues updates to the betas fairly regularly, for the first few months updates were every two weeks, but as we get closer to release date they are now once a week. The public beta updates tend to come a day or two after the updated developer beta.\nIf you are interested in trying out the beta, you can join Apple\u2019s beta program. For help installing the macOS beta see our guide to installing the macOS beta.\nmacOS 26 Tahoe supported devices: Which Macs get macOS Tahoe\n- Requires Apple Silicon or Intel-based Mac computers with a T2 Security Chip\n- Apple Intelligence features require M1 or later\nWhen Apple updates the operating system for its devices, it sometimes means that certain models are no longer supported. The good news is that Macs that ran macOS Sonoma will be able to run the new macOS. Apple states that the requirement is: Macs with Apple silicon and Intel-based Mac computers with a T2 Security Chip.\nHere are Macs with Apple Silicon that will be able to run macOS Tahoe:\n- MacBook Air (M1/2020 and later)\n- MacBook Pro (M1/2020 and later)\n- iMac (M1/2021 and later)\n- Mac mini (M1/2020 and later)\n- Mac Studio (M1/2022 and later)\n- Mac Pro (M2/2023 and later)\nThere are the four Intel-powered Macs able to run macOS Tahoe. These models won\u2019t support Apple Intelligence features:\n- MacBook Pro (16\u2011inch, Intel/2019)\n- MacBook Pro (13\u2011inch, Intel/2020, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports)\n- iMac (Intel/mid 2020)\n- Mac Pro (Intel/2019)\nApple has confirmed that this is the last version of macOS that will run on Intel Macs.\nmacOS 26 Tahoe design: Liquid Glass and other interface changes\nApple\nAt WWDC in June, Apple showed off some enticing new features for macOS that will be coming later in 2025. A number of new features and interface enhancements were promised, but one of the biggest changes is coming to all of Apple\u2019s products: a new design based on a graphical user interface that Apple is calling Liquid Glass.\nApple showed off the brand new look for macOS in the WWDC keynote. As with Apple\u2019s other operating systems, macOS Tahoe uses Apple\u2019s new Liquid Glass effect to create reflective, glossy elements around the interface. The Liquid Glass elements will change color to reflect the content beneath as you scroll and will dynamically react. Buttons appear more curved and less flat.\nYou\u2019ll see the effect in the Dock, sidebars, toolbars and elsewhere. The menu bar is fully transparent, and you can adjust the transparency of icons in the Dock, for example. If you don\u2019t like the new transparent look or if it affects how well you can see items, there is a way to reduce it, and in some instances, turn it in off altogether. Read: How to reduce transparency in macOS Tahoe.\nThis is the first time in years that Apple has made significant changes to the visual style of macOS, and it certainly makes the OS appear more modern.\nInterface changes\nApple\nApple says the design overhaul will elevate the key elements of macOS and enhance the macOS experience. The cleaner design is intended to help the user to focus on their content rather than other distractions, while elements like the translucent menu bar will make the screen feel larger.\nUsers will be able to choose to add third-party apps to the menu bar and even drag widgets and buttons from the Control Centre into the menu bar, thanks to a customizable layout, similar to iOS 18. Users will also be able to add controls for their favorite apps to the Control Centre. We have a guide to how to use Control Centre in macOS Tahoe where you can read about how to add controls, remove the ones you don\u2019t want, and arrange them in a way that makes sense for you.\nApple is taking advantage of the Liquid Glass introduction to bring some new icon designs to the Mac as well to help give macOS a fresh look. Some of the icons look drastically different, for others the changes are more subtle. The \u2018hard drive\u2019 icon will now be replaced with one that looks more like an SSD, for example.\nThe new icons tend to take the form of \u2018squircles\u2019. The changes may make some third party icons less recognisable. Take a look at: 21 of the new macOS Tahoe icons with new designs for the Finder, Automator, Calendar and Contacts icons among others.\nApple\nmacOS will also gain a feature that arrived on the iPhone and iPad with iOS 18: tinted and dark app icons.\nUsers will be able to personalize their Mac in other ways, too, such as changing the color of folders and adding emoji or symbols to help them identify folders. Users can also pick personalised wallpapers and choose theme colors.\nNew dynamic screensavers will be included. One, based on the default macOS Tahoe wallpaper, depicts the landscapes of South Lake Tahoe in a stylized artistic manner, is available in both light and dark versions. See how it looks in Tahoe\u2019s gorgeous new screen saver.\nThere are up to 15 other new screensavers with images of Tahoe at various time of the day, Himalayas, Goa, The Ganges and more.\nSpotlight overhaul\nApple\nSpotlight has always been much more than a search tool built into macOS, helping users find anything on their Macs, make calculations and conversions, and more. In macOS Tahoe, Spotlight will be able to do even more.\nSpotlight\u2019s design and functionality have been completely rethought for macOS 26, with changes that will help Mac users get things done faster.\nRather than being a single bar, on the right-hand side of the new Spotlight search box, you will find icons for things like apps, files, Shortcuts, Actions, and clipboard. Select one of these buttons, and Spotlight\u2019s box expands to house relevant items in an easy-to-browse view. When you search for something, you\u2019ll see relevant filters under your search terms \u2013 click one to quickly apply it.\nNot only will Spotlight be the easiest way to find anything on your Mac, but in macOS 26, Spotlight will be contextually aware so it can make suggestions based on what you are doing. Search results will be listed based on their relevance to you, and it will be possible to use new filtering options for more specific search results.\nSpotlight will also have the ability to perform actions that normally require you to be inside an app. For example, you will be able to create a calendar event, begin an audio recording, or play a podcast from within Spotlight. It will even let you fill out parameters for actions, such as typing out an email message and filling in the recipient and subject. You can essentially compose an email from inside Spotlight, without opening your email app.\nThis will be simplified further with Quick Keys, with which you will be able to type a short string of letters to launch an action, such as typing \u201csm\u201d to start sending a message to a friend. An App Intents API will make it possible for third-party developers to add Spotlight shortcuts for their applications.\nOne of the most exciting new arrivals in Spotlight is Clipboard History, something we have wanted for years. Instead of being limited to pasting the last copied item, you will be able to view previous text and photos you\u2019ve copied and re-insert them as needed. Why did it take Apple so long to offer this?\nApple\nTied to the new Spotlight is the new Apps app, which replaces Launchpad, which has been a feature of Macs for more than a decade and provides users with a Home page like view of all their apps. Instead Spotlight will be the means of finding apps. This will take some adjustment, especially if you were a Launchpad user. Learn more about Apps replacing Launchpad, and if you want to get Launchpad back we have a tutorial to show you how.\nmacOS 26 Tahoe: New and updated apps\nThere are also lots of updates coming to Apple apps that are included with iPads, iPhones, and Macs. Many of the changes are shared across all the new apps, but there are a number of Mac-specific updates coming.\nPhone app\nA Phone app on the Mac is the latest Continuity feature to come to macOS. Continuity is Apple\u2019s name for the features that work seamlessly between Macs, iPad and iPhones, these include Handoff (which enables you to start a task on one device and switch to another to finish it), Universal Clipboard (which allows you to copy something on one device and paste it on another), and Universal Control (where you can use one mouse and keyboard to interface with more than one Mac), among other features.\nWith the new Phone app, users will be able to receive their calls and voicemail on the Mac. The Phone app is getting some new features of its own, including Call Screening, which is designed to help you avoid spam calls, and Hold Assist, which means you will never have to listen to hold music again.\nWith Call Screening, before a call is put through, an unknown caller will have to share their name and reason for calling, and you will then be provided with that information. With Hold Assist, when you join a queue to wait for a call operator and the hold music starts, you can choose to be called back.\nYouTube / Apple\nLive Activities\nAnother feature that demonstrates the interoperability between the iPhone and Mac is Live Activities.\nIn iOS 18, you can see a live update on your Lock Screen relating to things like a takeaway order. Live Activities show the process of a food delivery driver, for example. Now, that functionality is coming to the Mac.\nIt will be powered by the iPhone Mirroring function, and will take the form of an iPhone-style widget that you will see on the screen of your Mac.\nGames app\nThe Games app is another one that is available across all three main operating system updates: iOS, iPadOS, and macOS. As with the iOS Games app, the Games app on the Mac will bring together all the games you have on your Mac (bought from the App Store, Apple Arcade and elsewhere), as well as your friends list, achievements, and leaderboards. Tabs will make it easy to find the games you and your friends are playing.\nA new Game Overlay will make it easy to adjust settings for a particular game. You\u2019ll also be able to chat with friends and ask them to play.\nThere is also a new Low Power Mode coming, which gamers will be able to turn on to maximise battery life when playing games.\nAnd in related news, Metal 4 is coming, which will enable next-gen features for Mac game developers, such as MetalFX Frame Interpolation and MetalFX De-noising.\nApple\nShortcuts\nApple\nThe Shortcuts app is getting an overhaul in macOS Tahoe.\nShortcuts is a tool for automating tasks and repetitive actions. For those with more specific needs, there is also Automator on the Mac, but Shortcuts is simple to use and available on iPhone and iPad as well.\nIn Tahoe, Shortcuts will be able to run workflows based on factors like time of day, or in response to an email from a specific person arriving. This functionality was previously limited to the iPhone and iPad versions.\nThere are new intelligent actions available that can be used to create Smart Shortcuts. Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT can be used to enhance these Shortcuts. Apple says that \u201cUsers will see dedicated actions for features like summarizing text with Writing Tools or creating images with Image Playground.\u201d\nLive Translation\nOne of the most useful new features announced at WWDC is Live Translation. With Live Translation, you can text a friend who speaks a different language and have the translations appear in real time, or get instant translations during a phone call or FaceTime conference. Everyone gets their own translator.\nYou\u2019ll be able to take advantage of Live Translation in the Phone app, Messages, and FaceTime on your Mac.\nApple\nJournal\nThe Journal app, which arrived on iOS in 2023, is coming to the Mac (and iPad).\nTerminal\nTerminal is getting a colorful redesign and the Liquid Glass treatment, with support for 24-bit color and the ability to use Powerline fonts.\nReminders\nReminders is getting some help from Apple Intelligence. Reminders will scan a website, note, email or other content, then decide the most relevant action items for you based on its findings. You\u2019ll be able to use Apple Intelligence to automatically categorize your reminders into sections, making them easier to find\nThere are also changes coming to Safari, Messages, Photos, FaceTime, and Notes."

      "text": "Mac users who want to run Windows on their Macs have been able to do so since the arrival of the Intel processors in Macs back in 2006. Back then it was easy to use Apple\u2019s own Boot Camp software to boot a Mac up into Windows, at which point your Mac could run Windows apps as if it was a PC (more or less). Additionally, solutions like Parallels Desktop and VMware Fusion allowed Macs to run Windows and Windows apps side-by-side with the macOS and Mac apps.\nHowever, in 2020 Apple started to transition from Intel processors to its own Apple Silicon processors. Now every Mac Apple sells uses one of its own M-series processors, which provide much better performance than the old Intel processors. Apple\u2019s new processors are based on ARM technology, rather than Intel\u2019s X-86 architecture though, and, as a result, these new Macs can\u2019t use Boot Camp to run Windows. They can still install Windows using virtualization technology, however.\nWhile Apple no longer offers its own solution for those wanting to run Windows on a Mac, Parallels Desktop, VMware Fusion and other third-party solutions do allow Windows to be installed on a Mac. Most of these solutions use virtualization technology to create a virtual machine \u2013 or VM \u2013 that can run Windows and Windows software on a Mac. A virtual machine is an ordinary Mac app, but it mimics \u2013 or emulates \u2013 the way that a Windows PC works, allowing you to run your Windows apps on the Mac desktop just like any other Mac app. We have tested a number of such options in our round-up of the Best Virtual Machine Software for Mac.\nBoot Camp is still an option if you have a Mac with an Intel processor. Read article on How To Install Windows On A Mac With An Intel Processor for help.\nWhat you need to run Windows on an M-series Mac\nIf you want to run Windows within a virtual machine on your Mac you need a fairly powerful Mac, with plenty of memory and storage space available. This is because you need to allocate some of your Mac\u2019s memory, storage space, and processor power to the virtual machine in order to install Windows and run your Windows apps properly. You probably won\u2019t be able to play the latest 3D games on your Mac using a Windows virtual machine, but you should be able to run many productivity apps, such as Microsoft Office, as well as quite a few design and graphics apps that may not be available on the Mac.\nThere is, however, one other complicating factor that you may have to face when trying to create a Windows virtual machine on an Apple Silicon-powered Mac. You can\u2019t install the standard version of Windows on a virtual machine if your Mac has an Apple Silicon processor* because that version of Windows is written for Intel processors. You need an ARM version of Windows. (*Strictly speaking, this is technically possible, but it\u2019s very difficult and you won\u2019t get very good performance).\nHow to get Windows for Apple Silicon Macs\nApple\u2019s M-series of processors are known as Arm processors because they are based on designs licensed from a U.K. company called Arm Ltd. There are other companies that make Arm processors as well, such as Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon chips, which are starting to appear in some of the latest Windows laptops. In order to make Windows work on these Arm processors, Microsoft has developed an alternative version of Windows known as Windows On Arm.\nIf your Mac has an Apple Silicon processor then you won\u2019t be able to create a virtual machine using the Intel version of Windows, but you can use Windows on Arm instead. The only problem here is that it\u2019s actually a little tricky to get hold of Windows on Arm, as Microsoft doesn\u2019t sell it direct to consumers and generally only licenses it to PC manufacturers such as HP, Lenovo or Dell. Fortunately, the team behind Parallels Desktop has been working closely with Microsoft, and has been approved by Microsoft as an official solution for running Windows on Macs with Apple Silicon.\nParallels Desktop, which was recently updated to version 20, allows you to download and install Windows 11 On Arm directly from Microsoft when you create a new virtual machine. You can then purchase a license for your copy of Windows from the Microsoft Store running within your virtual machine. That option isn\u2019t currently available with rivals such as VMware Fusion, so we\u2019ll focus on Parallels Desktop to show how this is done.\nRead our review of Parallels Fusion.\nHow to run Windows on a Mac (M-series and later)\nFoundry\nDownload Windows on Arm\nFoundry\nAs soon as you launch Parallels Desktop on a Mac that has Apple Silicon, the app provides some useful information about running Windows on Apple Silicon in order to help you get started.\nIt then asks if you want to download and install a copy of Windows 11 On Arm (as the Intel version of Windows won\u2019t run on Macs with Apple Silicon). Unfortunately, this option to download Windows On Arm isn\u2019t currently available within rival virtualization programs, such as VMWare Fusion.\nWhen you run your new virtual machine for the first time it will give you the option of purchasing Windows 11 On Arm from the Microsoft Store. If you\u2019ve already got a license for Windows 11 then you may be able to use that here, or you can buy a new license from within Parallels Desktop.\nConfigure your Virtual Machine\nFoundry\nOnce you\u2019ve downloaded Windows, you can create and configure your new virtual machine. You can choose how many of your Mac\u2019s processor cores to devote to running the VM \u2013 which is a key factor that will determine how fast the VM runs. You can also specify how much memory and storage space are allocated to the VM too.\nThere are lots of other settings, such as the ability to control the way Windows apps appear on the Mac desktop, or how Windows and Mac apps can share files. Fortunately, Parallels provides standard settings that generally work well, and you can then experiment and fine-tune your VM as you get used to working with it.\nRun Windows on your Mac\nFoundry\nHere\u2019s our Windows VM running on an iMac with a modest M1 processor. As you can see here, the VM starts off running in its own window, showing the standard Windows desktop. However, Parallels Desktop also provides a Coherence mode that hides this window and just shows your Windows apps floating on the main Mac desktop, just like ordinary Mac apps. You can adjust the viewing mode and other settings using the Parallels pulldown menu in the main Menu bar."
