  "title": "'There will be no invasion.' Sheinbaum confident Washington won't strike cartels in Mexico",
  "description": "Says new Trump directive won't result in U.S. strike on Mexico",
  "content": "President Trump has authorized U.S. military action against drug cartels. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Friday that Mexico would not accept U.S. troops on Mexican soil\n\nU.S. military forces will not strike Mexico, President Claudia Sheinbaum vowed Friday in response to reports that President Trump has secretly directed the Pentagon to take action against Latin American drug cartels.\n\n\u201cThere will be no invasion: That is rejected, absolutely rejected,\u201d an emphatic Sheinbaum told reporters at her regular morning news conference. \u201cThe United States is not going to come to Mexico with troops.\u201d\n\nThe media accounts, originating in the New York Times, revived nationalist fears in a nation that has suffered historic U.S. invasions and land grabs \u2014though none in more than a century.\n\nPresident Sheinbaum said that Mexico had been informed that Trump was issuing such an order, but that \u201cit has nothing to do with Mexican territory.\u201d\n\nThe Mexican leader repeated her oft-stated mantra that Mexico \u201ccooperates and collaborates\u201d with its northern neighbor on drug-trafficking and other bilateral issues, but rejects any U.S. military presence or strikes on Mexican soil.\n\nIn May, Sheinbaum said she had rebuffed Trump\u2019s offer\u2014made in one of many telephone calls between the two leaders \u2014 of direct U.S. military assistance.\n\n\u201cWe can share information, but we will never accept the presence of the United States Army on our territory,\u201d Sheinbaum said she informed Trump in May. \u201cOur territory is inalienable, sovereignty is inalienable.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what countries might be a target for a U.S. operation, but in an interview Thursday with on the Eternal Word Television Network, Secretary of State Marco Rubio noted that, aside from Mexico, there are cartels in Venezuela, Guatemala and Ecuador.\n\nRubio said cartels were no longer just a law enforcement issue, but a national security issue. \u201cWe cannot continue to just treat these guys as local street gangs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have weaponry that looks like what terrorists, in some cases armies, have.\u201d\n\nIn Mexico, fears that U.S. forces may strike Mexican territory have been growing since the Trump administration formally labeled six Mexican cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Many in Mexico view the designation as a prelude to unilateral Pentagon attacks on purported cartel targets.\n\nTrump has been complimentary of Sheinbaum, but has denounced what he labels an \u201cintolerable alliance\u201d between Mexico\u2019s government and organized crime.\n\nSheinbaum has rejected U.S. allegations that organized crime permeates Mexico\u2019s government and controls vast swaths of Mexican territory.\n\nTrump has already imposed 25% tariffs on many imports from Mexico \u2014 Washington\u2019s leading trading partner \u2014 in a bid to force authorities here to do more to curb the trafficking of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid blamed for tens of thousands of deaths in the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration has also ramped up U.S. surveillance flights over and near Mexican territory and has massed U.S. troops on the Southwest border in an effort to crack down on drug smuggling and unauthorized immigration.\n\nBut Mexico is not the only nation where the Pentagon might consider striking drug cartels. Venezuela could also find itself in U.S. military cross-hairs as Washington amps up its saber-rattling against the South American nation.\n\nOn Thursday the Trump administratation said it was doubling its existing reward\u2014to $50 million\u2014for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, a long-time adversary who faces drug-trafficking charges in the United States.\n\nThe State Department calls Maduro a \u201cleader\u201d of the Venezuelan-based Cartel de los Soles, which the Trump administration has labeled a terrorist group.\n\nWashington also accused Maduro of links to Mexico\u2019s Sinaloa cartel, which is among the crime syndicates that the Trump administration has labeled a foreign terrorist organization.\n\nOn Friday, Sheinbaum told reporters that Mexican authorities had seen no evidence connecting Maduro to the Sinaloa mob.\n\nVenezuelan authorities dismissed the U.S. charges against Maduro as \u201cpolitical propaganda.\u201d\n\nMaduro returned to office in January after declaring victory in a 2024 election that critics called rigged and was widely rejected by the international community. Washington does not recognize Maduro as Venezuela\u2019s president.",

      "text": "New Trump tariffs on Mexico delayed 90 days as trade talks continue\n- Share via\n- President Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said their two nations would continue negotiations on the contentious levies.\n- The postponement comes as nations across the globe scramble to make deals with the Trump administration.\n- Trump had said new tariffs would take effect Friday and that there would be no exceptions.\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 The presidents of Mexico and the United States said Thursday that punishing new tariffs on Mexican exports would be put off for 90 days as the two nations continue negotiations on the contentious levies.\nWord of the reprieve came a day after South Korea announced a trade pact with the U.S. and as countries worldwide scrambled to hammer out trade deals by Friday, the day President Trump said new tariffs would take effect.\nIt was the sole exception to a deadline that Trump said would bring hefty rate hikes to other, major U.S. trading partners, including Brazil, Canada and India, among dozens of nations that have thus far declined to enter framework trade agreements on strict terms set by the president.\nThis week, Trump wrote on social media: \u201cTHE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE IS THE AUGUST FIRST DEADLINE \u2014 IT STANDS STRONG, AND WILL NOT BE EXTENDED.\u201d\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News the same on Sunday: \u201cNo extensions, no more grace periods. Aug. 1, the tariffs are set, they\u2019ll go into place.\u201d\nBut that didn\u2019t happen, at least not in Mexico. The long-awaited announcement of a delay came after Trump and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum had a morning conversation, the latest in a series of phone calls in which the Mexican leader has urged her U.S. counterpart to not impose more tariffs on her nation \u2014 the United States\u2019 largest trading partner.\nTrump called the phone conversation \u201cvery successful\u201d in a post on his social media platform, adding: \u201cMore and more, we are getting to know and understand each other.\u201d The two North American leaders have yet to meet in person.\nUnder the deal, South Korea will invest $350 billion in key U.S. industries and purchase $100 billion worth of its liquified natural gas.\nIn her morning news conference, a clearly relieved Sheinbaum cast the postponement as a major victory for Mexico. \u201cWe have 90 days to keep on talking with President Trump,\u201d declared a smiling Sheinbaum. \u201cIt was a very good agreement. We remain where we are.\u201d\nIn his comments, Trump said that many imports from Mexico would continue to face a 25% tariff that he has said is needed to force the neighboring nation to cut down on the smuggling of fentanyl, the synthetic opioid linked to tens of thousands of deaths in the United States.\nAlthough Trump held off on a planned 30% tariff on some Mexican products, he declined to revise his existing tariff regimen, which Mexican officials view as egregious and harmful to the economy. Trump was firm that Washington would continue to charge the levies that he had already imposed \u2014 including the 25% \u201cfentanyl tariff.\u201d Mexican officials say their enforcement actions have resulted in a drastic drop in fentanyl trafficking.\nAlso to be retained, Trump said, would be a 25% tariff on auto imports and a 50% tax on imports from Mexico of steel, aluminum and copper. Mexico, Trump said, had agreed to \u201cimmediately terminate\u201d its nontariff trade barriers. It was not immediately clear what policies he was referring to.\nMembers of the 11-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington appeared unconvinced by the Trump administration\u2019s insistence that the president could impose tariffs without congressional approval.\nMexican officials are seeking to reduce or eliminate Trump tariffs on a wide array of goods. Those include a 17% tariff imposed in mid-July on about $3 billion in annual tomato exports to the United States.\nSheinbaum said that her country\u2019s \u201ccoolheaded\u201d approach to negotiating with the U.S. had succeeded in holding off more crippling tariffs while also defending \u201cour principles with firmness.\u201d\nMexico had managed to negotiate a privileged position in the \u201cnew global commercial order\u201d launched by the Trump administration and her U.S. counterpart\u2019s protectionist trade dictates, she said.\n\u201cWe have the best possible agreement, including when compared to other nations,\u201d Sheinbaum said.\nThis week Trump has continued to make tariffs a centerpiece of his foreign policy, using them to express his displeasure with allies as well as adversaries. On Wednesday, he said the U.S. would impose 25% tariffs on goods from India. That same day he signed an executive order to place 50% tariffs on Brazil, starting next week.\nWhen President Trump rocked the economy with an unprecedented attack on global trade in April, the plan was dismissed as swaggering, capricious and unsustainable.\nOn Thursday, Trump said that Canada\u2019s decision to recognize a Palestinian state would make it harder to reach a deal with America\u2019s northern neighbor.\n\u201cWow! Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine,\u201d Trump wrote on his social media site. \u201cThat will make it very hard for us to make a Trade Deal with them. Oh\u2019 Canada!!!\u201d\nThe Trump administration and Canadian government have remained at loggerheads over Trump\u2019s threats of new tariffs.\nThis year\u2019s protracted U.S.-Mexico trade drama has seen the on-again, off-again tariff threats from Trump sounding recurrent alarms of a Mexican economic collapse. Throughout, Sheinbaum has stressed the value of negotiation over confrontation, refusing to strike back rhetorically at Trump\u2019s verbal provocations.\n\u201cPresident Trump has his own way of communicating,\u201d Sheinbaum has said on several occasions.\nOn Thursday, Sheinbaum emphasized that Mexico had managed to preserve, for now, the 2020 North American free-trade deal \u2014 the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2014 signed into law by Trump during his first term. The pact allows duty-free entry of most Mexican goods into the United States and Canada.\nThe agreement is a linchpin of the Mexican economy. Mexico has become an export-dependent nation in recent decades, and the United States accounts for more than 80% of the country\u2019s exports. U.S. total goods traded with Mexico topped $839 billion in 2024, according to U.S. figures.\n\u201cT-MEC has been safeguarded,\u201d Sheinbaum said, using the Spanish acronym for the trade accord, known as USMCA in English. \u201cThat is very important.\u201d\nMcDonnell reported from Mexico City and Padilla from Los Angeles. Special correspondent Cecilia S\u00e1nchez Vidal contributed to this report."

      "text": "Mexico disputes U.S. money-laundering charges against banks allegedly linked to fentanyl trafficking\n- Share via\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 President Trump\u2019s vow to \u201cwage war\u201d on drug cartels has resulted in bombshell accusations of money laundering against three Mexican financial institutions \u2014 allegations that produced a defiant pushback from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no proof, just words,\u201d a clearly agitated Sheinbaum told reporters on Thursday. \u201cThere has to be proof to know if there was money laundering or not. Therefore, we don\u2019t deny it or accept it.\u201d\nA day earlier, the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued what it called \u201chistoric\u201d sanctions against CiBanco, Intercam Banco and Vector Casa de Bolsa. The department accused the three of laundering millions of dollars in narco-cash to facilitate the trafficking of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids into the United States.\nThe orders \u201caffirm Treasury\u2019s commitment to using all tools at our disposal to counter the threat posed by criminal and terrorist organizations,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news release.\nThe Treasury Department move would largely prohibit U.S. financial institutions from dealing with the three sanctioned entities, in effect shutting them out from access to the world\u2019s largest market.\nThe Treasury accused the three firms of laundering funds for various Mexican drug cartels and \u201cfacilitating payments for the procurement of precursor chemicals needed to produce fentanyl.\u201d\nU.S. authorities say Mexican cartels use chemicals imported from China to produce fentanyl in clandestine laboratories and then smuggle the potent opioid into the United States. Black-market fentanyl has led to tens of thousands of overdose deaths in the United States, officials say.\nSheinbaum has been widely lauded for her non-confrontational, \u201ccool-headed\u201d approach with the Trump administration, despite many disagreements \u2014 including on Trump\u2019s imposition of 25% tariffs on some Mexican imports, a levy meant to prompt Mexico to crack down further on fentanyl smuggling.\nBut Sheinbaum signaled her clear displeasure with Treasury\u2019s punitive actions.\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t anyone\u2019s pi\u00f1ata,\u201d Sheinbaum said, adding, \u201cWe coordinate, collaborate \u2014 we have said this many times \u2014 but we will not subordinate ourselves.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has imposed economic sanctions on three Mexican nationals involved in a drug trafficking and fuel theft network linked to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel.\nIn Mexico, some analysts have called the Treasury moves a broadside against Mexico\u2019s economic well-being. U.S. authorities have frequently sanctioned Mexican companies and individuals for alleged links to drug smuggling, but experts say the targeting of banks is much less frequent.\n\u201cThe accusation is the gravest news for the Mexican financial system in decades and represents a point of no return for these three firms,\u201d wrote columnist Carlos Mota of the El Heraldo de M\u00e9xico newspaper. \u201cThe entire Mexican financial system entered into shock.\u201d\nBut the Treasury said that \u201cany burden and disruption should be relatively minimal,\u201d since none of the three firms is a dominant player in Mexico.\nAll institutions \u2014 two banks and a brokerage house, all medium-sized firms \u2014 denied any wrongdoing.\nVector Casa de Bolsa said it \u201ccategorically rejected any imputation that compromises its institutional integrity.\u201d Vector manages about $11 billion in total assets, according to U.S. officials.\nThe case against Vector has drawn special scrutiny in Mexico because of the firm\u2019s ties to Alfonso Romo, a businessman who served for two years as chief of staff for former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, Sheinbaum\u2019s predecessor, mentor and the founder of Mexico\u2019s dominant Morena political bloc.\nNews coverage of the immigration raids and protests in Southern California has transfixed Mexico, where reports have heavily sided with the immigrants against U.S. efforts to detain and deport them.\nAfter leaving the chief of staff position, Romo remained a top economic advisor to L\u00f3pez Obrador.\nMexican media accounts have described Romo as the honorary president and co-founder of Vector. Romo has not commented publicly. According to Mexican media reports, Mexico\u2019s current finance minister, Edgar Amador, is a former analyst with Vector.\nAmong other allegations against Vector, the Treasury said that from 2013 to 2016 \u201ca suspected Sinaloa cartel money mule\u201d transferred more than $1.5 million to the brokerage firm. Vector was also accused of links to millions of dollars in Sinaloa cartel payouts to Genaro Garc\u00eda Luna, Mexico\u2019s former top federal security official.\nGarc\u00eda Luna was convicted in 2023 in U.S. district court of colluding with the Sinaloa mob and receiving millions of dollars in graft. He is serving a 38-year prison sentence.\nThe U.S. order against the three Mexican financial institutions is to take effect in 21 days. It is a civil action and does not involve criminal charges.\nSpecial correspondent Cecilia S\u00e1nchez Vidal contributed to this report."

August 7, 2025 QUESTION: This is your 200th day, by the way, of the administration. SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah. QUESTION: Which we\u2019ll talk about more. SECRETARY RUBIO: But my first interview on this mezzanine; I\u2019ve never done it before. I\u2019ve \u2014 QUESTION: You\u2019ve never done it \u2014 SECRETARY RUBIO: No. I\u2019ve seen people do media reports for years from here, with the background. QUESTION: Yes. But you \u2013 SECRETARY RUBIO: And now I get to do one myself. QUESTION: You\u2019ve never done an interview here? SECRETARY RUBIO: No. Not in this place. QUESTION: Wow. I love that \u2013 well, it\u2019s the perfect backdrop, and fitting for a day of celebration. Mr. Secretary, you are the Secretary of State, the acting secretary of USAID, the acting secretary of the Archives, and you\u2019re the National Security Advisor. My first question is: (a) How do you balance all that? And secondly, have you seen your wife in person in six months? SECRETARY RUBIO: I have. I saw her in person today, actually. QUESTION: Oh, you see that? SECRETARY RUBIO: So not bad at all, yeah. Well, USAID is largely folded now \u2013 the foreign aid part of it is under the State Department now. So, it assumes that responsibility. That really is where it always should have been. The National Security Advisor and the Secretary of State roles are very intertwined. In many cases, it\u2019s the same issue. Of course, it\u2019s always funny to read a memo from the Secretary of State to the National Security Advisor \u2013 and so consider him informed. QUESTION: (Laughter.) That\u2019s right. You have an insight into \u2014 SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah, exactly. QUESTION: In a deep, personal way. SECRETARY RUBIO: And then on the Archives, of the ones, it probably takes the least amount of time. But the good news is we haven\u2019t lost any historic documents, so \u2013 they\u2019re all in place. They\u2019re all there. (Laughter.) QUESTION: This is always a good thing. Well, the other piece of this is \u2013 describe to people very briefly \u2013 the national security advisor, in times past, that individual and the secretary of state often were at loggerheads. And it become a drag at times on the policy being advanced. SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah, sure. QUESTION: Was that part of the thinking here, let\u2019s consolidate this to \u2014 SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I\u2019m not sure that was the thinking per se. The President had made a decision about making a change, and he wanted the National Security Council restructured and tasked me to do it, and then that\u2019s what we\u2019ve done. And so, what \u2013 look, the way to think about it is our agencies, our cabinet \u2013 Senate-confirmed cabinet members in Treasury, at the Department of Defense, at State, et cetera \u2013 that\u2019s our orchestra. And the job of the National Security Advisor is to be the conductor of the orchestra, to make sure that everyone \u2013 the President picks the music, the instruments play off the same sheet, and it\u2019s the job of the conductor to make sure everyone\u2019s playing \u2013 that every instrument\u2019s playing correctly and playing together. So, it\u2019s sort of a coordinating role. QUESTION: Big news this week: Steve Witkoff, your ambassador, goes \u2013 special envoy \u2013 met with Vladimir Putin. There\u2019s now going to be a meeting between the President and Vladimir Putin. What do you expect from that meeting? What are you hearing, and what\u2019s been your contact with Zelenskyy? SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, yeah. So hopefully there\u2019s a meeting. And I think the President\u2019s willing to have one; I think Putin indicated a willingness to have one. Obviously, the meeting has to be about something. We\u2019re going to have to make some progress here before a meeting like that would be fruitful and worth doing. And so, for the first \u2014 QUESTION: Did Putin offer anything to Witkoff? SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, let me just say that, obviously, I\u2019m not going to get into the details of everything that was discussed there. But for the first time in this process there\u2019s at least some understanding of what the Russians would need in order to settle, to stop this war, from a diplomatic standpoint. Now, I\u2019m not claiming that what the Russians would need and what Ukraine would need are the same. QUESTION: Right. SECRETARY RUBIO: There\u2019s a difference, and there\u2019s a gap there. And the question for us now is can \u2013 and we\u2019ll be working on that even today, like, as soon as I leave here \u2013 can we bridge the gap between the Ukrainian side and the Russian side on this close enough so the President can come in as part of any sort of meeting and maybe be the closer on this deal. QUESTION: Has any \u2013 I mean, did they talk about a ceasefire? Is that in the \u2014 SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re specific about \u2013 obviously, the goal here is to end the war completely. Now, you could talk about the notion that it\u2019s very difficult to negotiate details of a peace if you\u2019re still shooting at each other. You \u2013 we\u2019ve always found, like, for example, very recently now with Thailand and Cambodia, the talks in Malaysia were about a ceasefire so they could then negotiate sort of a more permanent deal. But as long as you\u2019re shooting at each other, it\u2019s hard to negotiate peace permanently. QUESTION: So that\u2019s going to have to be a precursor to any \u2014 SECRETARY RUBIO: We\u2019ve always felt it is. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: Like, look, if we can arrive at a final deal and it\u2019s over completely, that would be great. We\u2019d prefer that \u2013 a permanent ceasefire. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: But sometimes you need an interim ceasefire simply to get everybody to the table and to talk. Because I\u2019ve seen in the past you have talks going on, something blows up somewhere, and people just walk away from the table. QUESTION: Yeah, yeah. Let\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t happen this time. The president of Switzerland was here yesterday. She flies in, emergency meeting, to meet with you, trying to head off these 39 percent tariffs that are coming her way. It looks like she didn\u2019t get a reprieve from those. SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I certainly don\u2019t do the trade negotiations, although I\u2019ve been in many of them, but I\u2019m not the person in charge of that. That\u2019s our team of Howard Lutnick and Jamieson Greer and Scott Bessent that have been doing that, and ultimately the President. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: So, they came in to make a counteroffer, or a new offer, to our trade negotiators. And as part of that, they\u2019re in town, we definitely want to talk about \u2013 they\u2019re a very \u2013 they\u2019re a good ally. They\u2019re a good partner to the United States. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: From a bilateral, diplomatic, geopolitical standpoint. But obviously, the issue of trade came up, and I encouraged them to make the best offer possible. In the end, every successful trade deal so far has been the President coming in to close it. So, you can get a deal close enough, but then you\u2019ve got to sit in front of him \u2013 whether it\u2019s their president, their prime minister, or their chief trade negotiator \u2013 and close it out with the President. QUESTION: There was something you did early on, in February, I think. Your State Department designated six cartels \u2014 SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah. QUESTION: \u2014 in Latin America as terrorist organizations. How did that change the way, the interaction between these cartels and the United States, and who made that decision? How did the President come to that? SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, the President makes the decision \u2013 yeah \u2013 on our recommendation. Here\u2019s the thing: We cannot continue to just treat these guys as local street gangs. They have weaponry that looks like what terrorists, in some cases armies, have. They control territory in many cases. Those cartels extend from the Maduro regime in Venezuela \u2013 which is not a legitimate government; we don\u2019t recognize the Maduro regime as legitimate. QUESTION: Right. SECRETARY RUBIO: It is a criminal enterprise \u2013 all the way to the various different cartels that operate in Mexico, and in between. You find them in Ecuador. You find them in Guatemala. You find TDA \u2013 what people would call street gangs, but actually are operating as criminal enterprises, but very well-organized ones. So what it changes is it gives us legal authorities to target them in ways you can\u2019t do if they\u2019re just a bunch of criminals. It\u2019s no longer a law enforcement issue. It becomes a national security issue. QUESTION: Has it changed their behavior at all? SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s changed their behavior yet, but their behavior is going to have to change one way or another. But it allows us to now target what they\u2019re operating and to use other elements of American power, intelligence agencies, the Department of Defense, whatever \u2014 QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2014 to target these groups if we have an opportunity to do it. We have to start treating them as armed terrorist organizations, not simply drug dealing organizations. Drug dealing is the kind of terrorism they\u2019re doing, and it\u2019s not the only. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: They\u2019re also into human trafficking. They smuggle anything. And there\u2019s been nascent cooperation between them and some international terrorist organizations in the past which pose an ongoing danger to the United States. QUESTION: Let\u2019s talk for a moment about the Israeli-Gaza-Hamas conflict. SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah. QUESTION: It looks like Benjamin Netanyahu is \u2013 wants to occupy Gaza, and Hamas is saying there\u2019ll be no ceasefire \u2013 we need a ceasefire, and we\u2019re not giving you these hostages until our terms are met. Where is the United States on this? Is occupation of Gaza the right way to go right now? And what about the humanitarian crisis? SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, let me say ultimately what Israel needs to do for Israel\u2019s security will be determined by Israel. I can tell you the way to break this out is there are three problems there at the same time. Number one is the one that\u2019s getting almost all the media coverage, and this is the humanitarian problems that we\u2019re seeing there. And there \u2013 no one wants to see that, and the United States stands prepared to contribute toward any real effort that will actually get food and medicine and life-sustaining aid to people on the ground in Gaza. That\u2019s number one. The second is that there are 20 innocent people being held hostage and starved inside of tunnels. Unfortunately, there aren\u2019t daily cameras down there covering that, and so you don\u2019t see the mainstream media covering it \u2013 but there are 20 people that have nothing wrong that are being held as hostage, and we saw the conditions that they\u2019re living in the other day. And the third is that as long as Hamas exists \u2013 as long as Hamas exists, particularly exists as an armed organization \u2013 there will never be peace in Gaza. Because that \u2013 Hamas is not going to suddenly change and go into another line of work. Their line of work, their reason for existing, is they want to destroy Israel. They want to drive every Jew out of the Middle East. That\u2019s their goal. And as long as a group like that has weapons and the ability to fight, they\u2019re a threat to peace. So, we have to deal with all three of those elements, not just the humanitarian. That\u2019s important, but the other two have to be dealt with as well. Not enough time is being \u2013 not enough attention is being paid to those two. And it\u2019s not easy, because Hamas thinks they\u2019re winning the global PR war. They\u2019re not willing to make any concessions. QUESTION: Well, clearly they\u2019re winning something. Your allies \u2013 Canada, France, the UK \u2014 SECRETARY RUBIO: Right. QUESTION: \u2014 are prepared to recognize the Palestinian state there. SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, if you noticed, the talks with Hamas fell apart on the day Macron made the unilateral decision that he\u2019s going to recognize the Palestinian state. And then you have other people come forward, other countries say, well, if there\u2019s not a ceasefire by September, we\u2019re going to recognize a Palestinian state. Well, if I\u2019m Hamas, I\u2019ve basically concluded let\u2019s not do a ceasefire. QUESTION: Right. SECRETARY RUBIO: Because we can be rewarded and we can claim it as a victory. So those messages, while largely symbolic in their minds, actually have made it harder to get peace and harder to achieve a deal with Hamas. They feel emboldened. QUESTION: Well, the Arab League isn\u2019t in favor of this. I mean, clearly the Arab League says you\u2019ve got to get Hamas out of there. They need to drop arms and move on. SECRETARY RUBIO: Correct. QUESTION: But do you agree with Netanyahu that this would be a reward for Hamas? SECRETARY RUBIO: Statehood? QUESTION: By giving them statehood? SECRETARY RUBIO: Recognition \u2013 absolutely. Look, statehood is a \u2013 it\u2019s not a real \u2013 what these people talk about isn\u2019t real. They can\u2019t define the borders or who\u2019s going to run it. I mean, you can\u2019t have a state or even an autonomous region unless you can identify who\u2019s going to run it. And if it\u2019s going to be run by Hamas, you\u2019re going to be right back into war. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: So, I think what\u2019s important to remember here is that \u2013 by the way, they had opportunities to do this. Israel turned over Gaza, turned it over completely with greenhouses and all kinds of things. And they elected Hamas. Hamas destroyed it, destroyed it all, took it, built tunnels instead of hospitals. That\u2019s what they do. So, at the end of the day my problem with it is that I believe that these unilateral steps that have been taken by these governments, I believe \u2013 I know \u2013 has emboldened Hamas and made it harder to achieve peace. QUESTION: Your department recently made headlines. You are instituting a pilot plan where people who are coming to the country to visit \u2013 when they file for their visa, they have to leave a bond of $10,000, $5,000 for children. Why are you instituting this? And is this going to help people actually go back to their country? I know that\u2019s \u2014 SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah, a couple \u2013 it\u2019s not for every country. It\u2019s for countries that have high rates of visa overstays. What generally happens is people will get a visa, they come to the U.S., it expires in six months, and they don\u2019t leave. Now they\u2019re here illegally. Very common; it happened a lot. In fact, I would say at one point \u2013 I don\u2019t know what the latest numbers are \u2013 but more than half the people in this country illegally were visa overstays. So, for countries that have high rates of visa overstay, you post a bond, and the bond gets collected against. And obviously the \u2013 and so obviously now some third party is going to try to verify whether this person is truly going to come back or not. But it \u2013 I\u2019m not saying it solves all the problem, but it\u2019s an innovative way to sort of cut down on visa overstays. QUESTION: There\u2019s been a huge challenge in the issuance of visas to foreign-born Catholic priests and religious. SECRETARY RUBIO: Correct, yeah. QUESTION: I know it\u2019s bollocksed up in fraud in unaccompanied minor visas. Now, I don\u2019t know how those two became conflated. I think the Biden administration attached them or threw them into the same category. What can be done? SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, first is to separate the one from the other. And in many cases, what you were finding is you had X number of people you were going to allow a year. You prioritized people that were coming here from a different migration and it came at the price of some of these others. QUESTION: I see. SECRETARY RUBIO: So, we\u2019re trying to separate the two from it and create its own standalone process. And I\u2019ve been in touch, for example, with a number of our cardinals here in the United States and bishops about that as well. QUESTION: I\u2019ll bet. SECRETARY RUBIO: And it\u2019s not only the Catholic Church. I mean, there are other places that are being impacted by \u2013 but we\u2019re trying to streamline that process. We clearly view that entry point as very different than some of these others. And \u2013 but when you basically say there\u2019s a hundred available \u2013 I\u2019m just using that number. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: And you\u2019re \u2013 the pot is that big, someone\u2019s going to lose out. I mean, you start losing slots, and that includes religious. QUESTION: Would you be in favor of extending those special visas that some of the religious and priests have now? SECRETARY RUBIO: Potentially. I mean, we\u2019re going to look at it. We\u2019re looking at every option. Look, we don\u2019t want to read headlines that some Catholic church had to close because \u2014 QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2014 it couldn\u2019t get their priests here or they couldn\u2019t get \u2013 some order closed because some nun couldn\u2019t get here. So we\u2019re not interested in that. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: And that\u2019s really not the aim here. It\u2019s more caught up in the structure of it. We\u2019ll have a plan to fix it. We\u2019re working on it. We know it\u2019s an issue, and we\u2019re committed to fixing it. QUESTION: The Immigration and Nationality Act allows you as Secretary of State to revoke student visas if they\u2019re engaged in \u2013 I\u2019m going to quote \u2013 speech that \u201ccompromises a compelling foreign policy interest,\u201d and you can revoke a visa from a student for any reason. SECRETARY RUBIO: Correct. And we have. QUESTION: And you can because of the antisemitism being expressed and other toxic speech that undermines foreign policy objectives of the United States. Now you\u2019re being sued by Stanford newspaper and a free speech activist group. Where do you stand on this now? SECRETARY RUBIO: They\u2019re wrong. I mean, anybody can sue. QUESTION: They say it\u2019s a First Amendment violation. SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, it has nothing to do with what their opinion is. It has to do what the impact of it has on the United States. Let\u2019s remember again \u2013 student visas, okay, are not a right. There is no constitutional right to a student visa. A student visa is something we decide to give you. And by the way, visas of every kind are denied every day all over the world. As I speak to you now, someone\u2019s visa application to the U.S. is being denied. So, if I would have denied you a visa had I known something about you, and I find out afterwards that I gave you a visa and I found this out about you, why wouldn\u2019t I be able to revoke your visa? If I wouldn\u2019t have let you in had I known this \u2013 like if this guy, Khalil \u2013 whatever his last name is. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: If that guy had been saying and doing abroad what he\u2019s now doing in the United States, we never would have given him a visa. He was on TV, I think it was yesterday or the day before \u2014 QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2014 arguing that October 7th had to happen \u2013 that it had happen \u2013 that it was a necessary evil that \u2013 he didn\u2019t call it an evil. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: He said it\u2019s a necessary thing; it had to happen. Why is a guy like that allowed into the United States on a visa? He\u2019s not entitled to a visa. So, it has nothing to do with what they\u2019re saying. It has to do with what they\u2019re doing and its implications on the U.S. Student visas are a privilege. They are not a right. QUESTION: I want to talk about this day. We \u2013 as we sit here, it\u2019s the 200th day of the administration. Major and, for the most part, unrecognized peace deals that you all have worked out in the \u2014 SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah. QUESTION: I mean, the Cambodia deal, the Congo deal. I want you to talk briefly about those. Forty-nine Christians were killed by Islamic extremists. More Christians are killed in Nigeria than anyplace on Earth. SECRETARY RUBIO: Correct. QUESTION: What else can we and should we be doing to stop that? SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, unfortunately in those places, you have these Islamist jihadist elements operating inside the country that deliberately target Christian communities and others, but they target Christians, especially in Nigeria, as you pointed out. And so, I think what we want to do is work closely with Nigerian authorities to prevent that. They have to make it a priority to prevent it. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: On the broader issue of peace, the President is committed to peace and committed to being the President of peace. And so, we saw when India and Pakistan went to war, we got involved directly, and the President was able to deliver on that peace. Cambodia and Thailand more recently; Azerbaijan and Armenia, hopefully \u2013 we\u2019re taping this here today, but on Friday of this week, we\u2019ll be here to sign an agreement and the beginning of a peace deal there. DRC-Rwanda \u2013 a 30-year war, 7 million people killed \u2013 we were able to bring them here to sign it. Obviously, work needs to \u2013 peace is not permanent. It always has to be worked and maintained. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: But we\u2019re very proud of those initiatives, and we\u2019re looking for more \u2013 obviously, the big one being in Ukraine and Russia. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: We want to see that as well. But we dedicate a significant amount of time to stopping and ending wars. QUESTION: And what\u2019s the difference between what you all are doing \u2013 what you\u2019re doing at this State Department and the President\u2019s leadership \u2013 as opposed to these conflicts that dragged on during the last administration (inaudible)? SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I think the biggest is the President\u2019s direct involvement. One thing is \u2013 we get involved. We help with the technical aspects of it, the mechanics, and we do a lot. I mean, it\u2019s a team effort. The Vice President has been involved in some \u2013 Steve Witkoff, obviously. It\u2019s another when the President is calling directly and saying in some cases to countries: we have this trade thing we\u2019re working on with you, but we can\u2019t do it if you guys are going to be fighting a war with each other. So that personal engagement by the President that I\u2019ve witnessed, particularly just very recently with Cambodia and Thailand \u2014 QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2014 that, I think, made all the difference in the world \u2013 certainly expedited. Understand that \u2013 from the time he made the first call to the time they stopped firing at each other was about 36 hours. Usually, these things take six weeks \u2013 not with President Trump. QUESTION: Give me a sense. You were there in the room when he was launching those attacks on Iran. You were there, I imagine. Describe to me how the President walks through these moment-by-moment decisions when the national security and the national prestige is on the line. SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I think you make a determination that we have a target identified. The first thing to understand about that operation it was very \u2013 it was very defined. In essence \u2014 QUESTION: Targeted. Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: It was targeted. It wasn\u2019t about starting a broader war. It was actually an effort to escalate in order to de-escalate. It had a very clear objective. He established the objective. His military planners offered him a timeline, and then there were checkpoints along that timeline where we had to go back and check with the President: Are you okay? Are you okay? QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: All of those thresholds were crossed. It happened very calmly. Now, he was President before, so he\u2019s been through this in the past. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: But it was executed on, and then we were done. He wasn\u2019t tempted to say let\u2019s go back and do it again or let\u2019s do more or let\u2019s find some other place. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: He had a very clear objective in mind, and he achieved it. And we immediately pivoted now to our goal was: okay, we achieved this objective, now how do we end this war \u2014 QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: \u2014 on the 12th day and not let it become a regional war after 21? QUESTION: Yeah. You were in Rome during the Pope\u2019s installation \u2013 the new Pope \u2013 Pope Leo\u2019s installation. Give me a sense of how now, as Secretary of State, what\u2019s \u2013 has the relationship at all changed or shifted from Pope Francis\u2019s reign to that of Pope Leo? What did you see in person from the man himself? SECRETARY RUBIO: Well \u2013 well, it was \u2013 when I interact with leaders in the Catholic Church, they\u2019re almost invariably from some other country, especially at that level. So, it was almost surreal to sort of interact with an American that\u2019s sitting across the table, because you\u2019re not used to that when it comes to \u2013 at that level, obviously. QUESTION: Right. And they get the nuance and the speech and the things \u2014 SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah, and they understand our history, our politics, our culture, what\u2019s going on here, things of this nature. They know \u2013 in many cases maybe they don\u2019t know too much about you. When it\u2019s an American, I think they know a lot more about you because they follow it (inaudible). QUESTION: Right. SECRETARY RUBIO: So, all that was unique, obviously. But I would say that right now, the \u2013 it\u2019s been new, and the papacy has only been there for less than a hundred days. QUESTION: Yeah. Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: So, I think that\u2019s still establishing itself, and he\u2019ll have to make decisions about \u2013 so right now I don\u2019t \u2013 I think it\u2019s good and we have good communication. We\u2019ve talked to the church, for example, extensively about Gaza. When a church was attacked there, we were able to facilitate visits there. There\u2019s a cardinal now that\u2019s in Gaza at that church permanently, I think \u2013 and kind of \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t say trapped, but he\u2019s certainly there. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: We\u2019ve been in communication with them on that. So, it\u2019s a good relationship, but it\u2019s new. It\u2019s a new papacy. It\u2019s a new direction. And I think \u2013 again, I\u2019m speculating, because I\u2019m not in the conclave, but I think one of the things that the cardinals probably chose is someone that sort of could provide a period of stability and consistency as the church faces a myriad of challenges around the world and \u2013 can both reach out to areas where the church is growing, but also sort of reinvigorate the church in some places where perhaps it\u2019s struggling. QUESTION: I remember in 2019 you gave a speech at CUA, just up the street here, Catholic University of America. And it was on the first \u2013 the last Pope Leo and \u2014 SECRETARY RUBIO: Leo \u2013 yeah. Common-good capitalism. QUESTION: Common-good capitalism. SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah. QUESTION: This seems to really resonate with this new Pope. SECRETARY RUBIO: I think so. We didn\u2019t get into depth on it, obviously, but \u2014 QUESTION: Did you talk about it all? SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I mentioned it and I made sure they had a copy of it, because the speech was back in 2019. But I do think that Catholic social doctrine, which is highly intellectual, has a lot to offer even non-Catholics in terms of forming \u2013 at the core of it, right, is the belief that \u2013 is the market the tool or the purpose? I don\u2019t think the market is the purpose. I think the market is a tool. The purpose is providing people meaningful work, an economy that grows but grows by creating jobs. We have an expectation that people work, but we also should have an expectation that the economy is creating good work. And from work, flows everything. We are made to work, and from work flows everything \u2013 stability in families, stability in communities. So, I think the simplest way to describe it is we are \u2013 we believe in capitalism, a capitalism that generates economic growth, an economic growth that creates wealth but doesn\u2019t only create wealth. It also creates opportunity. It also creates jobs, it also benefits the common good. QUESTION: Now \u2013 well, you have a unique \u2013 there are articles; I\u2019m not the first to say this. But I thought when you became Secretary of State, you have a unique opportunity to interface with the Vatican on a level that, frankly, other secretaries have not had in the past because of that experience. SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah, look, I think the Vatican could play a very key role in many parts of the world. They\u2019re actually very skilled diplomatic \u2013 diplomatically. In the end, their number one goal has to be that \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t want to call it the national interest of the Vatican, but the church and its presence in different places. I know they\u2019re deeply concerned, for example, that the church is being heavily persecuted in Nicaragua, as an example. So, they\u2019re always concerned about the church in China, which has been a point of friction with the U.S. Government in the past. But I mean, they\u2019re important, and they\u2019ve offered to get involved in any way they can on bringing about peace as a forum or as a facilitator. So, these are things maybe we\u2019ll be able to work on. QUESTION: Yeah. Very quickly, a couple of cultural things. Howard Stern looks like he\u2019s losing his show. Stephen Colbert has lost his show. What\u2019s happening culturally, and how is this President a part of it? SECRETARY RUBIO: I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just culturally. I think ultimately these are businesses, and the landscape, the media landscape, the way people are getting news, information, and entertainment is rapidly changing across the board. It\u2019s rapidly changing. And so, I think we are living in an era in which sort of what we describe or consider traditional media is going to erode in favor of some \u2013 I think everyone\u2019s trying to reinvent themselves. We saw newspapers go through this, we saw other media formats go through this; and I think it\u2019s now finally reaching broadcasters. And I think that both on radio and television, it\u2019s just a rapidly changing landscape. The overwhelming \u2013 increasingly \u2013 majority of people are not getting their news sitting live in front of a program. They\u2019re getting a clip on social media or they\u2019re getting it from an alternative site that\u2019s providing news and information. The good news is we have more providers than ever of news and information and entertainment. The bad news is we have more sources and they\u2019re all over the place. (Laughter.) So, I think as much as anything else, the bottom line is that Colbert and Stern \u2013 I don\u2019t know the details of it \u2013 are being fired because they don\u2019t \u2013 their audiences don\u2019t like what they\u2019re offering, and they don\u2019t have a long-term future. QUESTION: Final question. You saw Cynthia Erivo, the Wicked actress, played Jesus in Jesus Christ Superstar at the Hollywood Bowl just this past weekend. You are an ex officio member of the Kennedy Center. My question is: Would you ever put that show with Cynthia Erivo at the Kennedy Center? SECRETARY RUBIO: Yeah, I didn\u2019t know it \u2013 I\u2019m so busy I don\u2019t follow any of this stuff. (Laughter.) But just how you\u2019ve described it to me, no. I mean, obviously, look, that stuff\u2019s done to be provocative and to \u2013 but I think for people of faith, none of this should be new. QUESTION: Yeah. SECRETARY RUBIO: It\u2019s been true from the beginning of Christianity. It\u2019s been \u2013 Christianity has been mocked. Christianity has been attacked from its very inception. In fact, the church has traditionally been at its strongest when it\u2019s the persecuted church. QUESTION: Yes, it is. SECRETARY RUBIO: It\u2019s been at its weakest when it sort of gets consumed by the culture and \u2013 so by definition, Christianity has always been countercultural. It was from its earliest days, and it\u2019s been at its strongest and most vibrant. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean we seek persecution or that we don\u2019t take it on, it \u2013 but I think we should understand that in Christ\u2019s own command he \u2013 in Christ\u2019s own words he tells us: They\u2019re going to hate you because of me. They hated me before they hate you. And \u2014 QUESTION: What will you do when you leave this interview? What does the rest of your day look like? SECRETARY RUBIO: I\u2019m going over to the White House. We have meetings with the President this morning. We have a visitor from overseas coming into the White House as well to meet with me, not with the President. We have to get ready for the peace signing tomorrow, and I\u2019m sure they have other surprises awaiting. QUESTION: Oh, I\u2019ll bet. SECRETARY RUBIO: And I\u2019m \u2013 I actually have to finish here first. I\u2019ve got to go through some documents here, then run over there, and then I think may have to come back this afternoon again. So \u2014 QUESTION: Wow. Well, I hope you see your family very soon. SECRETARY RUBIO: (Laughter.) I\u2019ll see them, yeah. QUESTION: Thank you so much.

She said that on some private calls with the American leader in recent months, Trump said: \u201cHow can we help you fight drug trafficking? I propose that the United States Army enter to help you.\u201d\nSheinbaum said she rebuffed his proposal, saying: \u201cNo, President Trump, our territory is inalienable, sovereignty is inalienable. ... We can collaborate, we can work together, but with you in your territory and us in ours. We can share information, but we will never accept the presence of the United States Army on our territory.\u201d\nThis remains an extremely sensitive topic for Mexicans, given previous military occupations by the U.S. and the strong sense of nationalism that resulted\n\u2014 Gustavo A. Flores-Mac\u00edas, Cornell University professor\nA statement released by the White House on Saturday said that Sheinbaum and Trump had worked closely \u201cto achieve the most secure southwest border in history,\u201d but it did not directly address her comments on U.S. forces in Mexico.\n\u201cThe President has been crystal clear that Mexico must do more do combat these gangs and cartels and the United States stands ready to assist and expand the already close cooperation between our two countries,\u201d the statement said.\nSince Trump returned to the White House in January, his administration has ramped up CIA surveillance drone flights over Mexico, formally designated drug cartels as \u201cforeign terrorist\u201d groups and has repeatedly floated the possibility of deploying troops there to fight organized crime. He has massed U.S. troops on the northern side of the U.S. border with Mexico to crack down on unauthorized immigration and drug smuggling.\nMexico is \u201cessentially run by the cartels,\u201d Trump said earlier this year, insisting that the United States should \u201cwage war\u201d against them.\nSheinbaum has rejected Trump\u2019s characterization that Mexico is under cartel domination, and has vowed to defend her nation\u2019s sovereignty against violations \u201cby land, sea or air.\u201d\nThe Trump administration wants to use the military to fight Mexican drug cartels.\nBut the Mexican president\u2019s latest comments confirm that Mexico remains under intense pressure from Washington to accept greater U.S. involvement in the anti-drug fight, noted Gustavo A. Flores-Mac\u00edas, professor of government at Cornell University.\n\u201cThis remains an extremely sensitive topic for Mexicans, given previous military occupations by the U.S. and the strong sense of nationalism that resulted,\u201d Flores-Mac\u00edas wrote via email.\nThat gives Sheinbaum \u201clittle room to maneuver\u201d as Trump continues to insist on dispatching U.S. troops south of the border. \u201cThe Mexican government would be wise to take the threat of unilateral U.S. strikes against the cartels very seriously, while making it clear to the White House that the costs in terms of the economy, security and migration would be steep,\u201d Flores-Macias wrote.\nUnilateral U.S. strikes, experts say, could result in Mexico being obliged to take retaliatory measures, such as cutting back on bilateral cooperation on key issues such as security and immigration. U.S. attacks that result in civilian casualties could even force Mexico to cut diplomatic ties with its major trading partner.\nSince Trump took office in January, hurling insults and threatening devastating tariffs and U.S. drone strikes, Mexico has been seized by a nationalistic fervor.\nNo administration in modern times has taken such a militaristic approach to Mexico, a U.S. ally that Trump blames for producing the fentanyl that has killed hundreds of thousands of Americans.\nTrump\u2019s stance upends recent U.S. policy, which emphasized beefing up the rule of law in Mexico, and stands at odds with Mexico\u2019s security strategy, which has veered away from the sort of fierce cartel confrontations that drove record levels of bloodshed.\nTrump\u2019s fixation on organized crime in Mexico has put Sheinbaum in a difficult position. She has tried to appease him to try to avert the potentially catastrophic tariffs that he has threatened unless Mexico cracks down on fentanyl trafficking. She sent thousands of National Guard troops to fortify the northern border and is transferring dozens of suspected cartel members to the U.S.\nBut she has also had to show fellow Mexicans that she is defending national sovereignty. Since Trump took office in January, nationalism has surged here.\nOn TikTok, users have demanded a boycott of American products, filming themselves pouring Coca Cola down the drain. Companies have embraced the red, green and white of the Mexican flag in ad campaigns.\nA U.S. unilateral attack, some fear, could return Mexican politics to the gringo-bashing tendency that was once prevalent among Mexican politicians. But official dumping on the United States has generally diminished in recent years as economic, cultural and other U.S.-Mexico ties have strengthened and millions of Mexicans have emigrated to the United States.\nRemittances to Mexico from people of Mexican ancestry in the United States now top more than $60 billion annually, comprising a key pillar of the Mexican economy.\nCecilia S\u00e1nchez Vidal in Mexico City and Michael Wilner in Washington contributed to this report."

      "text": "Immigrant protests, unrest in L.A. reverberate in Mexico\n- Share via\n- Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has defended the right of immigrants to protest, but has denounced violence and called on Mexicans in Los Angeles to act peacefully.\n- Sheinbaum is expected to meet President Trump for the first time this week. She plans to raise the recent treatment of Mexicans in the U.S.\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 The action may be on the streets of Los Angeles, but fallout from the immigrant protests is roiling politics in Mexico at a delicate moment \u2014 days before Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum is expected to meet President Trump in their much-anticipated inaugural face-to-face encounter.\nSheinbaum has been on the defensive since Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem \u2014 at an Oval Office event in Trump\u2019s presence \u2014 accused the Mexican president on Tuesday of \u201cencouraging violent protests.\u201d\nWhile Sheinbaum has assailed the U.S. immigration raids and backed immigrants\u2019 rights to protest, there is no public record of her ever having backed violence. A day before Noem\u2019s accusation, she said the exact opposite and called on Mexicans in Southern California to act peacefully.\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum encouraged violent protests in Los Angeles. Sheinbaum called the accusation \u201cabsolutely false.\u201d\nNonetheless, Mexican opposition figures have embraced Noem\u2019s charges and enthusiastically sought to amplify them. Critics also have seized upon Sheinbaum\u2019s comments last month \u2014 weeks before the L.A. protests \u2014 calling on Mexicans in the United States to \u201cmobilize\u201d against a planned U.S. tax on cash transfers to Mexico.\nAn opposition senator, Lily T\u00e9llez, posted a video on X last week accusing Sheinbaum of emboldening compatriots in the U.S. to \u201cviolate the law without consequences, as if it were Mexico,\u201d an assertion echoed by other critics.\nThe barrage of accusations has put Sheinbaum in a delicate position: She is obliged to defend immigrants in the United States, as Mexican leaders have always done, but cannot be seen as inflaming bilateral tensions. Still, she has lashed out at her domestic critics as \u201canti-patriotic.\u201d\n\u201cHow is it that Mexicans dare to say I promoted violence in the United States? With what objective?\u201d the president asked Friday. \u201cSo that there\u2019s not a good relationship between Mexico and the United States? Or, worse, that the United States does something to Mexico? They are willing to have something bad happen to the country just to indulge their hypocrisy or hate.\u201d\nNews coverage of the protests has transfixed Mexico, where reports have heavily sided with the immigrants against U.S. efforts to detain and deport them. Commentators have largely condemned the Trump administration actions, while the airwaves and social media are filled with mostly sympathetic accounts and video from immigrants and advocates on the ground in Southern California.\nSheinbaum, elected to a six-year term a year ago in a landslide vote, has a 70% public approval rating, polls indicated. Her ruling Morena bloc dominates state legislatures and the Mexican Congress. She has little to fear politically from the ire of reeling opposition parties.\nBut, in the era of social media, the Sheinbaum-as-agitator narrative has gained traction among some U.S. conservative commentators. They have depicted her as a kind of master manipulator scheming violent resistance from her perch in Mexico City.\n\u201cThis woman, the president of Mexico, is talking about leading an uprising in the interior of America,\u201d Charlie Kirk, a far-right talk-show host, declared June 9 in a video posted on X, where he has more than 5 million followers. \u201cAnd she has a lot to work with because she has a lot of sleeper cells here.\u201d\nIn comments last week, Sheinbaum has embraced nonviolence as a daily mantra, citing the legacies of Mahatma Gandhi, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Nelson Mandela and Cesar Chavez.\n\u201cAny demonstration has to be peaceful,\u201d she told reporters Friday. \u201cWe are always seeking, diplomatically, the defense of Mexicans outside the country.\u201d\nThe Supreme Court tossed Mexico\u2019s $10-billion lawsuit against U.S. gun makers, but the case forced U.S. officials to acknowledge that thousands of guns are smuggled into Mexico from the United States.\nAnd, while Sheinbaum is a regular on X \u2014 where she has 4.3 million followers \u2014 she urged people not to \u201cmake politics\u201d on the social media forum, where much of the polemics about her purported role in the immigrant protests has played out.\nHelping to fuel the controversy are the proliferation of Mexican flags at the Los Angeles protests. Sheinbaum has neither endorsed nor criticized the flag-waving, but she has expressed dismay at one widely distributed image \u2014 of a shirtless L.A. protester brandishing a Mexican flag as he stands atop a burned-out car. She has called the photo a \u201cprovocation,\u201d hinting of dark motives, but has failed to clarify her suspicions.\nThe image, Sheinbaum said Friday, \u201cdoesn\u2019t fit with the millions of Mexicans who contribute to the economy of the United States and are the best of people.\u201d\nIn their broadsides against Sheinbaum, her opponents also have cited the president\u2019s animated calls for Mexicans in the United States to \u201cmobilize\u201d against a completely separate issue \u2014 the Trump administration\u2019s plans to impose a 3.5% tax on foreign remittances, part of the massive White House spending bill pending in Congress.\nThat proposed levy has met universal condemnation in Mexico, where the cash transfers support tens of thousands of poor families and are a $64-billion-a-year economic linchpin.\nIn an address last month in the northeastern state of San Luis Potos\u00ed, Sheinbaum called on U.S. residents of Mexican ancestry \u2014 both immigrants and those born in the United States \u2014 to send letters, emails and social media messages to Congress urging lawmakers to vote against the remittance tax.\n\u201cIf necessary, we are going to mobilize,\u201d declared an animated Sheinbaum, raising her right fist, the image recalling her youthful days as a left-wing student demonstrator.\nSheinbaum never called for street protests, much less violence. But she also never clarified whether \u201cmobilize\u201d referred to organizing rallies, bolstering diplomatic pressure or some other strategy to help thwart the remittance tax.\nThe clip of Sheinbaum urging people to \u201cmobilize\u201d has bounded across the internet. It\u2019s Exhibit A for those accusing her of fomenting violent protests. Some online versions have been dubbed so that Sheinbaum speaks in a heavily accented English.\nColombian mercenaries are being lured to Mexico to fight for powerful drug trafficking groups such as the Jalisco New Generation cartel.\nSince Trump took office, Sheinbaum has won wide acclaim for deftly handling sensitive bilateral issues such as tariffs and drug trafficking. As the immigrant protests spread across the United States, the Mexican president will be again walking a fine line with her U.S. counterpart in their first meeting at the Group of Seven summit, which started Sunday in Canada.\nSheinbaum confirmed Saturday that she planned to meet with Trump in coming days and would raise the recent treatment of Mexicans in the U.S.\n\u201cWe are going to defend Mexicans with dignity,\u201d she told a crowd outside Mexico City.\nThe Mexican leader has made it clear that she disputes the administration\u2019s view of immigrants as \u201cinvaders\u201d and of L.A. demonstrators as insurrectionists.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t agree with the treatment of honest Mexicans who work every day for the good of the United States and pay their taxes,\u201d Sheinbaum said on Friday. \u201cEighty percent of their earnings remain in the United States, in consumption, in taxes. And they are people who are integrated into life there.\u201d\nAnd Sheinbaum, who did doctoral studies for four years at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, added: \u201cCalifornia would not be what it is without Mexicans.\u201d\nTimes staff writer Kate Linthicum and special correspondent Cecilia S\u00e1nchez Vidal contributed to this report."

      "text": "- Share via\n- Americans barely remember the Mexican-American War, but in Mexico memories of the war and other military quarrels with the United States remain deeply felt.\n- Mexico lost half its territory, including California, in the war that broke out this week in 1846.\n- President Claudia Sheinbaum, who often speaks of Mexico\u2019s sovereignty, said, \u201cWe are neither a protectorate nor a colony of any foreign nation.\u201d\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 At the entrance to Mexico City\u2019s largest park lies a towering marble monument to six young military cadets killed in battle.\nThe Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes \u2014 \u201cboy heroes\u201d \u2014 died while defending Mexico\u2019s capital during the Mexican-American War, which broke out 179 years ago this week.\nThat conflict may not loom large in the minds of most Americans. But in Mexico, which in defeat was forced to cede more than half of its territory to the U.S., memories of the war and other military quarrels with the nation\u2019s powerful northern neighbor remain deeply felt.\nAs Mexicans, we have to unite for this new battle \u2014 which is a trade war\n\u2014 Felix de la Rosa, chemical engineer\nToday, Mexico is once again locked in battle with the United States, this time facing an American president who is hurling insults, tariffs and threatening U.S. drone strikes here. Many see it as just the latest chapter in an age-old tale of U.S. aggression.\n\u201cIn Mexico there\u2019s a perception that the United States is the villain of our story,\u201d said historian Alejandro Rosas. \u201cThat\u2019s the narrative you grow up with, it\u2019s what they teach you in school. We\u2019ve been victims of the United States forever.\u201d\nThe Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes are often viewed as the embodiment of courage, teenagers who fought like men against a northern invader. Their faces have appeared on currency, Streets bear their names, children learn about them in school.\nAt the white marble monument in Chapultepec Park, which this week was crowded with families enjoying spring break, many stopped to take pictures in front of the monument where the remains of the Ni\u00f1os Heroes are entombed.\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfair,\u201d said Monserrat Mart\u00ednez Hern\u00e1ndez, 20, a college student who snapped selfies alongside her mother, sister and two cousins.\n\u201cThey already took away half our territory,\u201d she said of the United States. \u201cNow they want to abuse their power again, this time from an economic perspective.\u201d\nSince Trump took office in January, Mexico has been seized by a wave of nationalistic zeal.\nOn TikTok, users have demanded a boycott of American products, filming themselves pouring Coca Cola down the drain. Companies have embraced the red, green and white of the Mexican flag in ad campaigns.\nAfter the government announced a relaunch of the \u201cHecho en Mexico,\u201d or \u201cMade in Mexico,\u201d seal on locally produced products, Grupo Modelo said it would print the slogan on its beer bottle caps.\nLeading the way is Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has both stoked \u2014 and benefited from \u2014 the surge in national pride.\nIn the face of Trump\u2019s repeated attacks, Sheinbaum has had to walk a thin line, appeasing him enough to try to avert potentially catastrophic tariffs while also showing fellow Mexicans that she is defending national sovereignty.\nShe has cooperated with Trump on several key measures, sending thousands of National Guard troops to fortify the northern border and transferring dozens of suspected cartel members wanted by the U.S.\nMexico\u2019s president said her government asked TV stations to pull a Trump administration advertisement warning against undocumented migration to the U.S.\nBut she has pushed back when possible, suggesting Mexico would retaliate if the Trump administration carried out drone strikes in its territory, pushing a constitutional measure that effectively bans the planting of U.S. GMO corn and recently asking television stations to pull what she called \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d ads produced by the Trump administration warning against undocumented migration. Her approval ratings \u2014 which hover around 80% \u2014 are among the highest in the world for a head of state.\nShe seems to work the word for sovereignty \u2014 soberano \u2014 into almost every speech.\nTellingly, she has often invoked history in her effort to rally support.\nThis month she marked the anniversary of the sixth-month long U.S. occupation of the port city of Veracruz in 1914.\n\u201cMexico is and always will be a great country,\u201d Sheinbaum told a stadium filled with smartly dressed naval officers. \u201cWe are neither a protectorate nor a colony of any foreign nation.\u201d\nRecently, Sheinbaum used the word \u201ctraitor\u201d to describe an opposition party member who voiced support for a U.S. effort to designate drug cartels as \u201cterrorist\u201d groups. She compared him with the conservative Mexicans who, in the 1850s, invited the French to help overthrow the liberal government of President Benito Juarez. The French ended up occupying Mexico for several years, briefly installing Ferdinand Maximilian Joseph, an Austrian duke, as emperor.\nBut it is the history of U.S. antagonism, with its roots in manifest destiny and President Polk\u2019s obsession with territorial expansion, that Mexicans best remember. In 1845, the U.S. annexed Texas, a move Mexico rejected. After Mexican troops attacked U.S. soldiers in Texas on April 25, 1846, the U.S. formally declared war. The 1847 battle over Mexico City is recalled on the U.S. side in the opening line of the Marines\u2019 Hymn: \u201cFrom the Halls of Montezuma ...\u201d\nThe U.S. and Mexico share a 2,000-mile long border and deep cultural, economic and family ties. Americans are largely welcomed with open arms and warm hospitality when they visit Mexico\u2019s vibrant cities, archaeological ruins and vast beaches.\nBut if an undercurrent of hostility is at times detectable, Rosas says it is related to how Mexicans are educated about their history. While neighboring countries often have territorial disputes, he said Mexican governments, particularly those associated with the Institutional Revolutionary Party, made the U.S. the boogeyman in order to drum up domestic support, he said.\n\u201cThey needed a shared enemy,\u201d Rosas said. \u201cSo they embraced very defensive, nationalistic and anti-interventionist politics.\u201d It\u2019s no mistake, he said, that the war between the U.S. and Mexico is often referred to as \u201cthe United States intervention.\u201d\nAt the Ni\u00f1os H\u00e9roes monument, Mexicans reflected on that past and possible conflicts \u2014 economic ones \u2014 looming in the future.\nFelix de la Rosa, 64, a chemical engineer from the state of Coahuila, which borders Texas, says he visits the monument every time he\u2019s in Mexico City.\n\u201cAs Mexicans, we have to unite for this new battle \u2014 which is a trade war,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we shouldn\u2019t bow our heads without fighting. I think the boy heroes are a great example, and that is how we should act, with great courage and dignity in the face of this new battle.\u201d\nBut for some, the lesson of history is that Mexico may again suffer the fate of being neighbor to one of the most powerful countries in the world.\n\u201cThe truth is, our country doesn\u2019t have the economic strength they have,\u201d said Gerardo Santos, a 33-year-old businessman. \u201cOur country is weaker, and President Trump knows this and takes advantage of it.\u201d\n\u201cIn the end, the gringos will win again,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about a man like Trump. The guy is crazy.\u201d"

      "text": "Case of \u2018El Chapo\u2019 son cooperating with U.S. prosecutors roils Mexico\n- Share via\nMEXICO CITY \u2014 A bitter public dispute between Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and the New York lawyer representing a son of drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n has raised speculation here that the deal-seeking scion of the onetime Sinaloa cartel leader may expose corrupt Mexican officials.\nOn Tuesday, Sheinbaum said she had filed a defamation complaint in Mexico against Jeffrey Lichtman, the high-profile attorney representing Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, who last week pleaded guilty in federal court in Chicago to fentanyl trafficking and other crimes. He has agreed to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors in a bid to reduce a potential life sentence.\nIn comments after the court hearing, Lichtman labeled as \u201cabsurd\u201d Sheinbaum\u2019s repeated contentions that Washington should coordinate with Mexico on the case \u2014 especially if, as is widely expected, Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez spills the beans on alleged ties between Mexican officials and cartels.\nIn an incendiary post on X, Litchman assailed the Mexican leader\u2019s \u201ccorrupt office and government\u201d and charged that Sheinbaum \u201cacts more as the public relations arm of a drug trafficking organization than as the honest leader that the Mexican people deserve.\u201d\nBy his own admission, Edgar Veytia ordered killings and torture and facilitated drug smuggling while he was governor of a Mexican state.\nThat sparked a flurry of denunciations from allies in Sheinbaum\u2019s ruling Morena bloc, which dominates Mexican politics.\nErnestina Godoy Ramos, Sheinbaum\u2019s official counsel, labeled Lichtman\u2019s comments \u201cgrotesque and unforgivable, breaking the ethical and legal limits of the profession.\u201d\nDeclared Sheinbaum: \u201cI\u2019m not going to establish a dialogue with a lawyer for [a] narco-trafficker.\u201d\nLichtman also represented El Chapo \u2014 now serving a life sentence in a U.S. prison in Colorado \u2014 and is the attorney for Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, another son of the drug lord. Like his brother, he is in U.S. custody and faces drug smuggling and other charges.\nMexico\u2019s transfer of 29 cartel figures \u2014 including Rafael Caro Quintero and accused Zeta members \u2014 has led to jockeying by attorneys willing to defend them.\nEl Chapo\u2019s sons, known as Los Chapitos, or the \u201cLittle Chapos,\u201d assumed responsibility for cartel dealings after their father\u2019s arrest in 2016, prosecutors say. Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez was extradited to the United States in 2023 after being nabbed following a shootout outside Culiac\u00e1n, the Sinaloa state capital, that left almost two dozen people dead, including 10 Mexican soldiers. Two other sons of El Chapo remain in Mexico directing cartel operations, according to U.S. officials.\nBehind the nasty contretemps between the New York barrister and la presidenta is a widespread sense here that Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez is poised to dish a mound of dirt about Mexican politicians on the payroll of the Sinaloa cartel. He may have already done so.\nWhat else, political observers ask, could explain the special treatment that members of El Chapo\u2019s family received in the spring?\nIn May, U.S. authorities escorted 17 members of El Chapo\u2019s extended family \u2014 including his ex-wife, the mother of Ovidio and Joaqu\u00edn \u2014 into San Diego from Tijuana. Although the U.S. Justice Department declined to comment, Mexico\u2019s top law enforcement official said the move was probably part of a cooperation deal between Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez and Washington.\n\u201cHe [Ovidio] must be singing,\u201d said Guillermo Vald\u00e9s Castellanos, a former intelligence chief in the administration of former President Felipe Calder\u00f3n, a political adversary of Sheinbaum. \u201cI think it\u2019s part of a very clear strategy by the government of Donald Trump to pressure Mexico \u2026 to take action against the profound links between organized crime and and Mexican politics.\u201d\nWhile frequently praising Sheinbaum, Trump has denounced the \u201cintolerable alliance\u201d between Mexico\u2019s government and organized crime. Trump has imposed punishing tariffs on Mexico in what he calls an effort to shut down fentanyl trafficking.\nThough critics have called Trump\u2019s characterizations overblown, the narco-government collaboration in Mexico goes back decades.\nCalder\u00f3n\u2019s top security official, Genaro Garc\u00eda Luna, was convicted of taking millions of dollars in bribes from Sinaloa cartel traffickers and is serving a 38-year U.S. prison sentence.\nSheinbaum and her political mentor, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, hailed the U.S. prosecution of Garc\u00eda Luna \u2014 a case that exposed deep corruption among their political rivals. But the tables may now be turning.\nThere have been no public disclosures about what Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez may be secretly revealing to U.S. prosecutors. But speculation in Mexico has focused on the suspected crookedness of so-called narco-governors serving under the banner of Sheinbaum\u2019s dominant Morena political bloc. None have been charged.\nMexican news reports suggest the U.S. recently orchestrated the secret, cross-border move of at least 17 relatives of Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n to California.\nBut even more explosive, experts say, would be any fresh allegations against L\u00f3pez Obrador, Sheinbaum\u2019s predecessor and the founder of Morena. During his six-year term, L\u00f3pez Obrador repeatedly denied unconfirmed reports of having received political donations from people tied to organized crime.\nBy all accounts, any public airing of new accusations against L\u00f3pez Obrador from U.S. authorities could trigger a political earthquake in Mexico.\n\u201cThere is total uncertainty and fear in the presidency,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Luis Montenegro, a Mexican journalist who wrote a book on Los Chapitos. \u201cThe politicians of Morena must be trembling.\u201d\nSheinbaum has won widespread acclaim for her \u201ccoolheaded\u201d approach to Trump provocations on issues such as tariffs, immigration and drug smuggling. But the Mexican president has sharply rebuked U.S. prosecutors\u2019 apparent deal-making intentions with El Chapo\u2019s son. She has accused U.S. authorities of hypocrisy \u2014 seeking cooperation from Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez at a time when the Trump administration has designated the Sinaloa cartel and other Mexican crime groups as terrorist organizations.\n\u201cSo where is their position of \u2018not to negotiate with terrorist groups\u2019?\u201d Sheinbaum asked this month.\nMexican leaders are still outraged about what they call the U.S.-orchestrated kidnapping almost a year ago of Ismael \u201cEl Mayo\u201d Zambada \u2014 co-founder of El Chapo\u2019s Sinaloa cartel \u2014 who is now also in custody in the United States.\nMexican officials suspect that U.S. authorities recruited Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez to abduct El Mayo, bundle him into a private plane and fly him to an airfield outside El Paso, where U.S. agents arrested both El Mayo and Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez.\nWashington has never clarified its role in the sensational case. The apparent betrayal of El Mayo set off a civil war in the cartel \u2014 pitting El Mayo loyalists against Los Chapitos \u2014 that has cost hundreds of lives in Sinaloa state.\nNow, three top accused Sinaloa cartel capos sit in U.S. custody, and at least one, Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, appears keen to make a deal that could expose a web of official corruption, roiling Mexican politics.\nSpecial correspodent Cecilia S\u00e1nchez Vidal contributed to this report."

  "argos_summary": "President Trump has authorized U.S. military action against drug cartels, but Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum firmly rejected the idea of U.S. troops on Mexican soil, emphasizing Mexico's sovereignty. Sheinbaum stated that while Mexico cooperates with the U.S. on drug trafficking issues, it will not accept military presence or strikes. The situation has heightened nationalist sentiments in Mexico, with fears that U.S. actions could lead to a return of historical grievances against American intervention. Additionally, the U.S. has imposed sanctions on Mexican banks linked to drug trafficking, further straining relations.",
