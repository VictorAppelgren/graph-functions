At launch we\u2019re offering contracts for the first two weeks of the pro and college seasons, and we plan to add weekly matchups as the season progresses (for example, week 3 games will launch after week 1 concludes).\nUnlike sports betting, where the firm sets a line, event contracts leverage the power and rigor of financial market structure and are offered in a marketplace where buyers and sellers interact to set the price. Customers can access the contracts in real time and manage risk by adjusting\u2013or exiting\u2013their positions up to and throughout a game before a contract expires.\nWe believe in the power of prediction markets and think they play an important role at the intersection of trading, news, information, economics, politics, culture, and sports. We currently offer contracts across crypto, economics, financials, sports, culture, and more, with others being added regularly. Ultimately, our goal is to enable anyone, anywhere, to trade, invest or hold any financial asset and conduct any financial transaction through Robinhood.\nPrediction markets are offered by Robinhood Derivatives and are currently available across the US through a CFTC regulated exchange.\nFor more information you can visit our Help Center or read our recent policy paper on our position and support for this emerging asset class.\nDisclosures:\nRestrictions and eligibility requirements apply. Futures, options on futures and cleared swaps trading involves significant risk and is not appropriate for everyone. Please carefully consider if it\u2019s appropriate for you in light of your personal financial circumstances.\nWe expect pro and college football prediction markets on Robinhood to be tradeable daily from 8:00am ET until 3:00am ET.\nTo be eligible, customers must apply and be approved for a Robinhood Derivatives account (or already have an existing Robinhood Derivatives account). Additional trading prohibitions apply for these contracts. For pro and college football prediction markets, please see Appendix B of the trading prohibitions for these contracts).\nRead the Event Contracts Risk Disclosure for more information about the risks associated with event contracts.\nPro and college football event contracts are offered by Robinhood Derivatives, LLC through KalshiEX LLC. Robinhood Derivatives, LLC is a registered futures commission merchant with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and Member of National Futures Association (NFA) (NFA ID 0424278). As a registered futures commission merchant, Robinhood Derivatives, LLC, does not make markets in any futures or event contracts.\nPro and college football prediction markets are not endorsed by any professional or collegiate athletic association, or professional or collegiate football team that is part of any professional or collegiate football league, or any other company, agency, or government entity.
