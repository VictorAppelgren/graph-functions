      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\nYour draft captures the headline drivers but falls short on the depth, precision, and structure required for a world‑class short‑term analysis.  Below are concrete edits to tighten reasoning, align with the 0–3‑week horizon, and meet the source‑citation and quantification standards you’re expected to deliver.\n\n1. **Causal Chain & Market Transmission**  \n   - Explicitly map how each catalyst feeds into specific market segments.  E.g., *Fed rate‑cut hint → risk‑seeking sentiment → Hang Seng Tech + CSI 300 + Nasdaq + S&P 500*; *Nintendo Switch 2 sales → hardware spending + gaming‑hardware stocks*; *Santos LNG results → energy‑sector sentiment + LNG‑focused ETFs*.  Use arrows or a concise bullet list.  \n   - Quantify the expected impact: “If Switch 2 sales stay above 2 M units, hardware spending should stay ≥ $380 M, supporting a 2–3 % rise in the *Nikkei 225* and a 1–2 % lift in *NASDAQ* over the next 2 weeks.”  Cite the exact source IDs (e.g., K2JWRPXRV for Switch 2 data, S1OY7ISLY for Santos).\n\n2. **Depth & First‑Principles Grounding**  \n   - For Nintendo: include unit price ($399 launch price) → revenue estimate ($798 M) and margin assumptions.  Explain why supply constraints were avoided (e.g., “Nintendo’s supply‑chain flexibility and pre‑manufacturing inventory of 1.5 M units” – cite Circana/Sensor Tower data).  \n   - For Santos: link LNG price ($11.57/mmbtu) to EBITDAX ($1.8 B) and explain the cost‑structure advantage (e.g., “$7.28/boe production cost vs. $9.5/boe industry average”).  Cite S1OY7ISLY.\n\n3. **Alignment with Section Focus (0–3 weeks)**  \n   - State the *key levels/thresholds* clearly: Hang Seng at 25,642.70; CSI 300 at 5,000+; Nintendo Switch 2 sales > 2 M units; Santos LNG price > $11/mmbtu.  \n   - Define *invalidation points*: If Switch 2 sales fall below 1.8 M units, hardware spending growth may dip below 15 %; if Fed minutes show no rate‑cut signal, risk‑seeking sentiment may reverse; if tariffs rise > 10 %, AI‑driven growth could stall.  \n   - Identify *next‑step catalysts*: upcoming Switch 2 sales data (Aug 5), Fed minutes (Aug 7), AI investment announcements (e.g., Nvidia’s $500 B AI push – source 4), and Santos Q2 results (Aug 12).\n\n4. **Quantification & Numbers**  \n   - Replace vague “3–5 % rally” with a range backed by data: “Based on current momentum, tech indices could rise 1.5–2.5 % and energy indices 1–2 % over the next 10–14 days.”  \n   - Include a simple chart or table (if format allows) summarizing the drivers, expected impact, source ID, and risk level.\n\n5. **Citation Density & Correctness**  \n   - Every numeric claim must reference a source ID: e.g., “Nintendo sold 2 M units in the U.S. (K2JWRPXRV)”; “Hardware spending rose 21 % to $384 M (K2JWRPXRV)”; “Santos free cash flow $1.1 B (S1OY7ISLY)”.  \n   - Ensure all critical sources are covered: Nintendo (K2JWRPXRV), Hong Kong market (T7HLAX8QN), Santos (S1OY7ISLY), Krugman/Trump (218AGGUXB), Intel stake (scraped source 4).  \n   - Reconcile conflicts: note that while Nintendo’s Switch 2 drove hardware growth, accessory spending fell 8 % (K2JWRPXRV), which tempers overall hardware sentiment.\n\n6. **Structure & Clarity**  \n   - Start with a one‑sentence thesis: “In the next 0–3 weeks, a Fed rate‑cut signal, Nintendo’s Switch 2 momentum, and Santos’ LNG performance are poised to lift tech, gaming‑hardware, and energy sectors, while tariff uncertainty and AI‑investment volatility remain tail risks.”  \n   - Follow with a concise bullet list of catalysts, expected moves, thresholds, and watch‑list items.  \n   - End with a clear “Actionable Takeaway”: e.g., “Short‑term traders should consider a bullish bias on *NASDAQ* and *Santos* shares, but monitor the August Switch 2 sales report and Fed minutes for potential reversal.”\n\nBy tightening the causal chain, grounding assumptions in first‑principles, quantifying expected moves, and rigorously citing every data point, the analysis will meet the high‑signal, world‑class standard required for a 0–3‑week market outlook.",
