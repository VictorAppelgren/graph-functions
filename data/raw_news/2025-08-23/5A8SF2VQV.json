(Photo by John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)\n\nThe Trump administration intends to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he rejected a last-minute deal to remain in jail, plead guilty to human smuggling charges and be deported to Costa Rica, a legal notice filed Saturday by his attorneys said.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes ultimatum bolsters defense claims that Abrego is the target of \u201cselective and vindictive prosecution\u201d by the government for contesting his wrongful deportation to the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador in March, Abrego\u2019s lawyers wrote.\n\nThe revelations come one day after Abrego was released from a Tennessee jail where he was awaiting a January trial on human smuggling charges. The sheet-metal apprentice was on his way back to Maryland, where he lives in Prince George\u2019s County with his wife and children, when his attorneys received an emailed notice at 4:01 p.m. Friday from Immigration and Customs Enforcement saying it may send him to Uganda.\n\nAbrego, an undocumented immigrant who was arrested in March, was swiftly and erroneously deported to a prison in El Salvador, even though a previous court order prohibited his deportation there because of possible threats from Salvadoran gangs. The Trump administration acknowledged his deportation was a mistake, and since then his case has focused unwelcome public scrutiny on the administration\u2019s immigration crackdown tactics.\n\nOn return to the U.S., Abrego was taken to Tennessee to face charges that an unremarkable 2022 traffic stop there with several immigrants in his car was really part of a human smuggling ring. Abrego has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him.\n\nIn a deal offered by the government late Thursday, it promised to deport Abrego to Costa Rica where he could live freely if he remained jailed until Monday, pleaded guilty to the Tennessee human smuggling charges and served the sentence imposed by the court, his attorneys wrote. The government of Costa Rica had agreed to take him, the filing said.\n\nAbrego\u2019s attorneys informed the Acting U.S. Attorney Rob McGuire, who is prosecuting the Tennessee case, they would \u201cof course, communicate the government\u2019s proposal to Mr. Abrego\u201d but declined to agree to a demand that he remain incarcerated until Monday.\n\nAbrego was released shortly after 2 p.m. Friday from a detention facility in Putnam County, Tennessee. Within minutes of Abrego\u2019s release, a representative of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, informed his attorneys they intended to deport him to Uganda and ordered him to report to the agency\u2019s field office in Baltimore, his attorneys wrote.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that happened between Thursday \u2014 Costa Rica \u2014 and Friday \u2014 Uganda \u2014 was Mr. Abrego\u2019s exercise of his legal entitlement to release under the Bail Reform Act and the Fifth Amendment,\u201d his attorneys wrote.\n\nGovernment officials again, late Friday evening, informed Abrego he has until first thing Monday morning to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica \u201cor else that offer will be off the table forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere can be only one interpretation of these events: the (Department of Justice) and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,\u201d Abrego\u2019s attorneys wrote.\n\nAttorneys for Abrego on Wednesday filed a motion to dismiss the criminal charges against him, calling the case a clear example of \u201cselective and vindictive prosecution\u201d by the Trump administration in legal filings last week.\n\nThe ultimatums offered by the Trump administration serve to underscore Abrego\u2019s allegations that it is acting with vindictiveness towards him, their latest legal filing said.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security \u201care obviously working in lockstep to coerce Mr. Abrego into accepting a guilty plea in his criminal case, holding over his head the prospect of possible indefinite detention \u2014 or worse \u2014 in a country halfway across the world,\u201d the attorneys wrote. \u201cIt is difficult to imagine a path the government could have taken that would have better emphasized its vindictiveness.\u201d\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\n\nAs part of the campaign against him, Abrego\u2019s motion to dismiss said, Trump administration officials early on mounted a public campaign to distract from the erroneous deportation by smearing him. It started with Vice President JD Vance falsely claiming Abrego was an MS-13 gang member, and \u201cother Executive Branch officials soon joined the Vice President\u2019s effort to discredit Mr. Abrego, claiming publicly that he was violent, a gang member, and a terrorist,\u201d the motion said.\n\nThose attacks continued Friday when Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem complained in a social media post about \u201cthis publicity hungry Maryland judge mandating this illegal alien who is a MS-13 gang member, human trafficker, serial domestic abuser, and child predator be allowed free.\u201d\n\nAbrego has never faced any of those charges in the U.S. Even though Noem also blasted a Maryland judge, Abrego\u2019s release Friday was ordered by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes in Tennessee, not U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland, who is overseeing his original deportation case.\n\nAbrego is scheduled to appear at ICE office in Baltimore on Monday. According to the email from the agency, the 72-hour clock on his threatened deportation was paused over the weekend.\n\n\u2013 This story first appeared in Tennessee Lookout, which is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.
