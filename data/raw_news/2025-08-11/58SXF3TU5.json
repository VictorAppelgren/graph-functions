It also included provisions permitting leagues to restrict certain broadcasts \u2014 commonly referred to as blackouts \u2014 in local markets when a home team is playing at the same time. Per Yahoo Sports, the committee now believes the broadcasting landscape has evolved so much since the 1960s that the current rules may no longer fit today\u2019s media environment.\n\nIn a statement, the committee noted that most sports viewership now occurs outside traditional television, with streaming platforms increasingly central to how games are consumed. This shift has created what they describe as \u201clegal uncertainty\u201d in the marketplace, as some distribution deals remain shielded from antitrust scrutiny while others do not. According to Yahoo Sports, the letters to the commissioners specifically referenced recent antitrust cases that have raised questions about whether the SBA should be revised or repealed.\n\nRead more: NFL-Disney Deal Expected to Face DOJ Scrutiny Over Antitrust Concerns\n\nThe request for briefings was signed by both Republican and Democratic leaders on the committee.

The commissioners have been asked to arrange meetings before August 25 to address their leagues\u2019 role in the broadcasting market and blackout policies.\n\nThe outcome of these discussions could have significant implications for how fans access live sports in the future.

      "text": "House Judiciary Committee requests briefings from NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB commissioners on broadcast blackouts\nAfter decades of the four biggest professional leagues in the United States receiving a broadcasting antitrust exemption, the House Judiciary Committee may be looking to alter that law. The committee has formally requested briefings with the commissioners of four of the U.S.'s main professional leagues with the intention of discussing broadcasting markets and blackout exemptions.\nIn a statement released Monday, the Judiciary Committee included the letters sent out to each of the four commissioners: Adam Silver (NBA), Roger Goodell (NFL), Gary Bettman (NHL) and Rob Manfred (MLB). Per the statement, the committee plans to meet with the commissioners to discuss the Sports Broadcasting Act (SBA), a law that gives sports leagues an antitrust exemption for broadcasting games on network television.\nThe SBA, which was passed in 1961, was originally passed in order to help the NFL organize its broadcast rights as a collective, streamlining the process. The act also includes a \"blackout\" exemption, which allows leagues to prevent broadcasting certain games within certain areas of the country when that area's team is playing a home game at the same time.\n[Join or create a Yahoo Fantasy Football league for the 2025 NFL season]\nBut now, per the statement, the House is looking into \"the sufficiency of existing law\" in terms of the current broadcast landscape.\n\"The current state of the sports broadcasting market has changed considerably since the 1960s. The majority of sports viewership now occurs outside of traditional network broadcasting,\" the committee writes in the statement. \"As a result, most of the distribution agreements that a sports league enters into are subject to antitrust challenges, while a narrow subset are not, creating legal uncertainty, distorting the market, and effectively expanding the blind spot for potential antitrust violations.\"\nIn the commissioners' letters, the committee is more clear about the potential future of the law: \"Recent antitrust cases have raised important questions about whether the SBA should be modified or repealed as a result.\"\nThe request was made by two Republican representatives: Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), the House Judiciary Committee Chairman, and Scott Fitzgerald (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Administrative State, Regulatory Reform, and Antitrust. Two Democratic representatives, Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) and Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) were also named in the letters; both are ranking members of the Judiciary Committee.\nIn the letters, the committee requests that the commissioners speak on their individual league's \"participation in the sports broadcasting market and related matters.\" Silver, Goodell, Bettman and Manfred are asked to arrange for the briefing before Aug. 25.\nWhat's the current state of the sports broadcast landscape in the U.S.?\nWith the committee hinting that the SBA could be changed, it raises questions about where the future of the sports broadcasting landscape will go. But, as the committee points out in the letters: \"In the 64 years since the SBA was first enacted, the sports broadcasting market has changed considerably.\"\nAll four of the leagues involved operate with similar models when it comes to broadcasting, where specific markets and channels negotiate rights to individual teams. Streaming services are also in play, whether on services directly connected to broadcast giants (Peacock, Paramount+, etc.) or standalone, like Netflix's recent push into the live sports market.\nOutside of that, the leagues have internal streaming services where fans can pay to watch all of the league\u2019s games, outside of blackouts \u2014 NFL+, NBA League Pass, MLB.TV. (NHL does not have that same equivalent, but out-of-market games are available to ESPN+ subscribers.)\nBut the NFL put shockwaves through that landscape last week, following reports of a deal that would send the NFL\u2019s media assets, including RedZone, to ESPN. The deal, which will potentially give the league as much as 10% equity in ESPN, erases some of the lines that used to hold between the leagues and their broadcast partners.\nThe fact that the committee is calling to these commissioners 10 days after that deal was reported does not feel like coincidence, though much of the House\u2019s concerns seem to be focused on the rise of streaming and the excess of options for consumers.\nSports broadcasting rules are something that Congress has been focused on in the past: In a Senate hearing in May on the transition from broadcast television to streaming, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said that the NFL has \"tiptoed up to\" the limits of the SBA.\nNotably, the committee did not call on the commissioners of MLS, the WNBA or the NWSL, three of the other major U.S. sports leagues. It is unclear why the House did not involve those leagues, though they do have smaller viewership than the other four."

      "text": "The National Football League\u2019s newly announced agreement with Walt Disney Co. \u2014 which grants the league a 10% equity stake in ESPN in exchange for key media properties \u2014 is poised to draw close attention from U.S. antitrust regulators, according to industry insiders and legal experts cited by Reuters.\nRevealed on Tuesday, the deal would see Disney\u2019s ESPN acquire the NFL Network and other affiliated assets, further expanding the network\u2019s already substantial grip on televised sports content. In return, the NFL would gain an ownership foothold in one of the most influential sports broadcasters in the country.\nLegal analysts have flagged potential regulatory hurdles. Andre P. Barlow, an antitrust attorney with Doyle, Barlow & Mazard, noted to Reuters that the deal \u201csurely raises competition concerns,\u201d warning that it could limit consumer options and inflate prices for sports fans by strengthening Disney\u2019s position in the streaming and sports media markets.\n\u201cThe deal could potentially result in higher costs for consumers,\u201d Barlow said, referencing the growing dominance of Disney in the sports broadcasting sector.\nAccording to Reuters, the U.S. Department of Justice is expected to conduct a thorough antitrust review of the transaction. One anonymous source indicated that the approval process could stretch for up to a year. This review comes amid a broader examination by the DOJ into another Disney deal \u2014 the company\u2019s attempt to acquire a controlling stake in Fubo TV, a sports streaming platform. In that case, the Justice Department requested additional information earlier this year, a sign that regulators are increasingly focused on consolidation in the digital sports market.\nThe rise of streaming as a dominant platform for sports has not gone unnoticed in Washington. Lawmakers have been probing the impact of such deals on consumers, particularly as fans face rising subscription costs and fragmented access to games. During a Senate Commerce Committee hearing in May, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas lamented the growing complexity and expense of simply watching a game. \u201cWhy does it seem to be getting harder \u2014 and more expensive \u2014 to just watch the game?\u201d he asked.\nRead more: Hulu-Disney Plus Merger Moves Forward\nPublic interest groups share similar concerns. John Bergmayer, legal director at Public Knowledge, testified that viewers are feeling the effects of content spread across multiple platforms. \u201cSome viewers feel like they finally broke free of the cable bundle only to watch it re-forming before their eyes,\u201d he said, per Reuters.\nDespite the scrutiny, the NFL has proactively briefed lawmakers. According to one source, the league has approached around 30 congressional offices to discuss the deal, portraying it as a move that would expand consumer choice. Under the proposed arrangement, ESPN would integrate the NFL Network into its programming slate, including its streaming service. ESPN also plans to consolidate its fantasy football platform with that of the NFL and distribute the NFL\u2019s RedZone channel alongside its existing broadcast offerings. However, the league will retain streaming rights to RedZone via platforms like YouTube TV.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Disney has faced intense regulatory review. Its $71 billion purchase of 21st Century Fox\u2019s entertainment assets in 2018 swiftly cleared antitrust hurdles under the Trump administration, though Disney was required to divest regional sports networks to address competition concerns. Barlow told Reuters that this time around, the process might not be so smooth. \u201cI expect the Justice Department to take a close look before approving the deal,\u201d he said.\nPolitical entanglements could also complicate matters. Reuters reports that former President Donald Trump previously intervened in sports-related business dealings, including publicly opposing a proposed NFL stadium project unless the Washington Commanders reverted to their former team name \u2014 a moniker retired amid racial sensitivity debates.\nIf the Disney-NFL transaction secures approval, ESPN\u2019s ownership structure would shift. Disney\u2019s ABC Inc., currently holding 80% of ESPN, would see its stake reduced to 72%. Hearst, which owns 20%, would drop to 18%, making room for the NFL\u2019s 10% share."
