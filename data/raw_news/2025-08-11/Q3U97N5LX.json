  "description": "The five-time Emmy nominee died, age 54, in 2023 from 'the acute effects' of ketamine with drowning as a contributing factor",
  "content": "Jennifer Aniston confessed she mourned her Friends co-star Matthew Perry for a 'long time' before he died, age 54, in 2023 from 'the acute effects' of ketamine with drowning as a contributing factor.\n\n'We did everything we could when we could,' the 56-year-old Emmy winner - who played fashion exec Rachel Green - said in her Vanity Fair cover story Monday.\n\n'But it almost felt like we'd been mourning Matthew for a long time because his battle with that disease was a really hard one for him to fight.\n\n'As hard as it was for all of us and for the fans, there's a part of me that thinks this is better. I'm glad he's out of that pain.'\n\nMatthew earned an eye-popping $24M to portray the 'executive in statistical analysis and data reconfiguration' Chandler Bing between 2002-2003 on the NBC sitcom, which ran for 10 seasons spanning 1994-2004.\n\nPerry made headlines in 2021 for bringing a 'palpable unease' to HBO Max's Friends: The Reunion special as he interacted with Jennifer, Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox, Matt LeBlanc, and David Schwimmer.\n\n'The special ultimately declines to discuss any of his troubled experience explicitly, but it nonetheless lingers around the margins with palpable unease,' Variety critic Caroline Framke wrote in her review.\n\n'When his castmates talk about staying in touch with each other, he cracks a joke about how he doesn't hear \"from anyone\" so dryly that it's impossible to tell if it's actually a joke.'\n\nThe five-time Emmy nominee had admitted he was on alcohol when he was overweight, pills like Vicodin when he was very thin, and even worse when he sported a goatee on the hit show.\n\nMatthew - whose colon burst from opioids in 2018 - also confessed on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show in 2016 that he couldn't remember three years 'somewhere between season three and six' of his time on Friends.\n\nJasveen Sangha, the 'Ketamine Queen' who sold Perry the dose that killed him, has pled not guilty and her federal trial is scheduled to begin September 23 in Los Angeles.\n\nFour other defendants - doctors Salvador Plasencia, Mark Chavez, and Erik Fleming as well as the twice-rehabbed star's ex-assistant Kenneth Iwamasa - have already reached plea agreements with federal prosecutors.\n\nMatthew - who publicly claimed he was sober - had been receiving ketamine infusion therapy as treatment for his depression.\n\nIn 2013, Perry received a Champion of Recovery award for opening sober living home Perry House, which has since closed.\n\nMeanwhile, Jennifer reportedly earned $2M per episode executive producing and reprising her role as UBA co-host Alex Levy in Charlotte Stoudt's 10-episode fourth season of The Morning Show, which premieres September 17 on Apple TV+.\n\nAniston based her character off the trailblazing broadcast journalist, Diane Sawyer.\n\nThe hit newsroom drama is a loose adaptation of Brian Stelter's 2013 book Top of the Morning, and season four is set two years after the UBA-NBN merger.\n\nThe Out of My Mind actress will next produce and star in the Apple TV+ adaptation of former child star Jennette McCurdy's 2022 memoir I'm Glad My Mom Died, and she'll produce the Gen Z reboot of 9 to 5 penned by Diablo Cody.\n\nJennifer also keeps busy running her haircare company LolaVie, which she founded in 2021.",

      "text": "The most shocking revelation of the \u201cFriends\u201d reunion might be that the actors \u2014 now six of the most famous in the world \u2014 never met until their first table read. From their very first moments swapping jokes and stories around the squashy chairs of Central Perk in 1993, the chemistry between Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry and David Schwimmer was so immediate and so natural that it became very easy for audiences to imagine not just that they were friends, but their friends, too. Recapturing that spark in a reunion special 17 years after the series finale without the smokescreens of their characters, though, would be another challenge entirely.\nThe special acknowledges this approximately one second in with a title card \u2014 scrawled in the \u201cFriends\u201d credits font, naturally \u2014 to inform us that, since the series finale, \u201cthe six cast members have been in a room all together only once \u2026 until today.\u201d\nPopular on Variety\nThe stakes thus set, the Friends walk onto the show\u2019s meticulously recreated set one by one, starting with a wide-eyed David Schwimmer and ending with a skittish Matthew Perry. Aniston, Cox and Kudrow still have an easy familiarity with each other that makes it clear that spending the Emmys together at Aniston\u2019s home last year wasn\u2019t completely unusual for them. LeBlanc, who demonstrated a canny self-awareness when playing a hyperbolic version of himself on Showtime\u2019s \u201cEpisodes,\u201d brings the most boisterous energy to the table from the moment he walks in to when he gleefully points at the message he left on the set wall after the finale (\u201cI shit here \u2014 Matt LeBlanc\u201d).\nThe special, directed by \u201cLate Late Show With James Corden\u201d producer Ben Winston, then boomerangs between these quieter moments of just the core cast, a few cutesy bits featuring guest stars I can\u2019t mention (but you can probably guess), and a splashy live interview moderated by professional fanboy James Corden in front of a masked audience roaring its approval. The live-audience component is ostensibly why HBO Max held off on producing the special earlier, and yet throughout the reunion\u2019s impressive run time of over an hour and a half, it also proves to be the least essential.\n\u201cFriends: The Reunion\u201d was, of course, originally supposed to supplement the launch of HBO Max as a streaming service. More specifically, it was meant to celebrate HBO Max exclusively acquiring the entire series from Netflix, the streaming equivalent of putting its enemy\u2019s head on a spike outside the castle. Instead, the pandemic put the special into infinite limbo \u2014 even as dozens of other shows like \u201cFrasier,\u201d \u201cThe Nanny\u201d and \u201cHappy Endings\u201d staged virtual reunions for fun, charity, and just the hell of it. And yet HBO Max held out on \u201cFriends,\u201d determined to make it a bonafide in-person event that wouldn\u2019t give producers panic attacks with every Zoom glitch.\nThen again: HBO Max did manage to stage a smart, fun, surprisingly moving in-person reunion last November, which now makes for a fascinating counterpart to the overwhelmingly shiny, happy people of the \u201cFriends\u201d special.\nWhen \u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air\u201d cast reunited last November for the show\u2019s 30th anniversary, it was fair to assume that it would follow in other reunions\u2019 footsteps as a relatively harmless jaunt down memory lane. But in his role as host, Will Smith took a few cues from his wife Jada Pinkett-Smith by bringing the cast to a metaphorical \u201cRed Table Talk\u201d that made room for catharsis amidst all the fond remembrances.\nThey mourned the loss of James Avery, the actor who grounded so much of the show with such gravitas. They recalled the legacy of \u201cFresh Prince\u201d as a successful Black sitcom that addressed racism and class issues in between its slapstick. Most impactful of all, though, the \u201cFresh Prince\u201d reunion welcomed back Janet Hubert, the actor who originated the role of Aunt Viv and was recast with a noticeably lighter-skinned actor (Daphne Reid) after Smith and producers decided Hubert was too \u201cdifficult on set.\u201d Now a movie star and father, Smith took the time to sit down with Hubert and ask her to share her side of the story, which Hubert did with admirable candor.\nSmith and Hubert\u2019s conversation is powerful, complex and, maybe most surprisingly of all, genuinely awkward. Here were two people serving up extratextual context for why the show looked like it did by confronting their pasts and each other\u2019s role in them, with real willingness to speak and hear difficult truths.\n\u201cFriends: The Reunion\u201d doesn\u2019t have any interest in going down that kind of road \u2014 though for a moment, it almost seems possible it might. Perry has mentioned in the past about how his addiction struggles impacted his time on the show to the point that he had to enter rehab. The special ultimately declines to discuss any his troubled experience explicitly, but it nonetheless lingers around the margins with palpable unease. When his castmates talk about staying in touch with each other, he cracks a joke about how he doesn\u2019t hear \u201cfrom anyone\u201d so dryly that it\u2019s impossible to tell if it\u2019s actually a joke. Later, as the rest of the cast laughs about the takes they messed up and how the audience reacted, Perry remembers how he felt every night \u201clike I was going to die if they didn\u2019t laugh,\u201d and acknowledges that \u201cit wasn\u2019t healthy, for sure.\u201d The segment lingers just long enough on this moment for Kudrow to respond with concern that they never knew that, at which point it cuts to the next nostalgia trip.\nMostly, the special opts for a vibe that echoes Aniston\u2019s as she smiles through her perpetual happy tears. They wander around the set marveling at how small it feels now, give each other gentle grief for their inability to remember lines, and reveal the trinkets they swiped (a mug for Aniston, a cookie jar for Kudrow). They do a few intimate table reads of pivotal moments from episodes like \u201cThe One Where Everybody Finds Out\u201d and \u201cThe One Where Ross Finds Out [That Rachel Likes Him].\u201d Even in these short scenes, the actors manage to snap right back into their old rhythm with an almost spooky recall. (Aniston, it seems, can still recite most of her old lines off-book.)\nIn between these segments come insights from producer Kevin Bright and creators David Crane and Marta Kauffman, as well as the aforementioned Corden weirdness that eventually devolves into a fashion show I can only describe as \u201cunhinged.\u201d More interesting and impressive is a montage dedicated to the international influence of \u201cFriends\u201d as it was translated and regurgitated around the world to the point that many fans \u2014 including the Korean boy-band sensation BTS, interviewed briefly here \u2014 used it to learn American English.\nAs per the special, the outsized influence of \u201cFriends\u201d was nothing but a good thing. People felt a kinship with these friends who treated each other like family. Women admired Monica\u2019s willingness to propose to Chandler and Rachel\u2019s decision to raise her and Ross\u2019 baby without marrying him. A special guest star known for embracing her quirks thanks Kudrow for the character of Phoebe, who taught her that being \u201ca little different\u201d was okay.\nThe reunion is so insistent on the show being nothing but a benign joy, in fact, that it only made me think harder about all the ways it wasn\u2019t. \u201cFriends\u201d famously included so few non-white characters in its version of New York City that most every subsequent sitcom trying to capture its appeal feels obligated to include a joke about it. The series featured a surprisingly progressive storyline about Ross\u2019 lesbian ex-wife and new partner raising his son (neither of which factor into the reunion), but also included so many homophobic and transphobic jokes that it quickly became a cornerstone of Chandler\u2019s personality and family history. These shortcomings have also been viewed billions of times around the world, and it would have been revealing to see the cast and crew reckon with its less sterling reputation now, too.\nBut \u201cFriends: The Reunion\u201d isn\u2019t trying to be revealing, at least not about anything that thorny or unpleasant. It\u2019s here to entertain, and to remind fans why they love the show (and that it\u2019s now available to stream only on HBO Max). Digging in to its shortcomings would have made for a more interesting special, but it also wouldn\u2019t have reflected the show itself, which largely left unpleasantries outside of its comically enormous apartments. \u201cFriends\u201d only ever tried to address a small slice of life; it\u2019s not especially shocking that its long-awaited reunion special would do the same.\n\u201cFriends: The Reunion\u201d premieres Thursday, May 27 on HBO Max."

      "text": "To get to Jennifer Aniston\u2019s sanctuary, you climb up, up, up, into the hills of Los Angeles. Past mansions shielded by millions of dollars in manicured privacy hedges. Past the gate an alleged stalker crashed into in May, which is now being surveilled by a police cruiser and a private 24/7 detail. Past the security guard handing out NDAs to visitors, aside from this journalist. And through the towering front doors of her $21 million home.\nThe world is a burning hellscape, a fact explored through fictional reporters trying to chase it down in Aniston\u2019s Apple TV+ series, The Morning Show. But the actor has learned in her many years of stardom, and all its attendant bumps, how to block out the noise and calm the nervous system. Or how to try, at least.\nThis midcentury home, designed by A. Quincy Jones and Frederick Emmons, is an oasis. There are soft cream couches, white peonies, and white taper candles accenting the living room. One wall is nothing but a panoramic window overlooking Los Angeles, with a view stretching from Downtown to the Pacific. There are no screens or ambient sound. Whether it is this blanket of silence or the accoutrements on her coffee table\u2014a raw amethyst (known for spiritual growth or inner peace), a white crystal (purity, clarity), an incense holder decorated with crows (knowledge, transformation) amid design books\u2014her home has the anxiety-suppressing effect of a spa.\nAnd Aniston looks like she lives in one. The exquisitely maintained 56-year-old is a monument to self-care. Her long hair is down and her eyes are bright blue. She wears a version of the outfit she\u2019s been wearing for years in the millions of paparazzi photos we\u2019ve all seen: a slim-fitting long-sleeve black shirt, low-slung Rag & Bone blue jeans, black flip-flops, and jade bracelets (good fortune). When I say how calm I feel a few minutes into my visit, she reacts with warmth: \u201cGood! That\u2019s the whole point.\u201d She gestures outside: \u201cOut there, it causes nerves. In here,\u201d she says, motioning around her, \u201cthere should be no nerves.\u201d\nThirty-one years ago Aniston first endeared herself to us as runaway bride\u2013slash\u2013coffeehouse server Rachel Green in Friends. Her easy charm and comedic delivery were just as magnetic on movie screens\u2014Bruce Almighty (2003) and Along Came Polly (2004). And she proved her dramatic depth in The Good Girl (2002) and Cake (2014). But it is The Morning Show, which she executive-produces and stars in, alongside her Friends sister (and real friend) Reese Witherspoon, that is her most fascinating showcase.\nOn it, Aniston channels Alex Levy, a morning news anchor making the boldest leaps and power grabs of her career in her 50s. This woman is so famous that her personal life makes headlines and her private heartbreak is plastered across multiple mediums for strangers\u2019 entertainment.\nAfter one public humiliation too many in The Morning Show\u2019s second season, Levy says, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize\u2026that the thing people would find most entertaining is not even the thing that\u2026I have risen to the highest levels of. I didn\u2019t realize that the most entertaining thing about me would be just batting me around like a freaking pi\u00f1ata while digging around asking questions about my sex life.\u201d\nLevy and Aniston alike have emerged from the era of Hollywood when there could be only one female star in the room: The Morning Show depicts how Levy embraces her younger coanchor; Witherspoon and Aniston are, as stars, coequals. Diane Sawyer, who inspired Aniston\u2019s performance, loves that the women have shared center stage, onscreen and off. \u201cAn alliance of women who have great energy and resilience is a wonderful thing,\u201d Sawyer tells me.\nIn 2004, Sawyer was the TV host asking Aniston hard-hitting questions about some of the most vulnerable areas of her life. About how her soap opera actor father, John, left her mother, Nancy, an actor and model, so suddenly that her mom broke the news to Aniston when she got home from a birthday party. \u201cIt was pretty quick,\u201d Aniston laughs to Sawyer on ABC\u2019s Primetime Thursday broadcast, making light of the heartbreak. About her mother\u2019s criticisms of Aniston as a child\u2014that her nose was too big and her eyes too close together. Aniston explains from her perspective: \u201chelpful beauty tips.\u201d About how many kids she and her then husband, Brad Pitt, wanted to have. \u201cWe\u2019d definitely love to have two, at least,\u201d Aniston answers.\nWhile Levy has developed a self-protective steeliness after her decades in the public eye, Aniston hasn\u2019t\u2014not even after nearly four decades, two divorces, approximately two thousand tabloid covers, and years of overly personal questions from strangers.\n\u201cI think her superpower is that she could very easily be hard, but she\u2019s incredibly open,\u201d says Sandra Bullock, a close friend. \u201cPeople want to know about her and understand where she is in life and want her to be happy.\u201d\nFame was never Aniston\u2019s goal\u2014and it still knocks her sideways sometimes. (She views paparazzi when she\u2019s working as \u201calmost an embarrassment, to be honest.\u201d) Growing up, she recalls, people looked to actors like Shirley MacLaine and Mary Tyler Moore not because they were gorgeous and on magazine covers, but because they had made movies and television that moved them. Aniston\u2019s celebrity, as gravity-pulling as it can be, has never defined her: \u201cI\u2019ve always been more into metaphysical things and \u2018What if there\u2019s something bigger out there than all of us?\u2019 \u201d She\u2019s learned not to put everything at the altar of fame. \u201cIt\u2019s not real,\u201d she tells me. \u201cMy interests are other than that.\u201d During her 20s, she began joining women\u2019s circles with her female friends. She says, \u201cThat opened me up to the importance of women in each other\u2019s lives and how important it is to support and hold each other up when so many want to tear each other down.\u201d\nAbout 15 years ago, Aniston and Bullock were attending a mutual friend\u2019s wedding when they locked eyes across the aisle. (Bullock doesn\u2019t know why they were sitting on separate sides, given they were both friends of the groom, but it is her memory and a better visual.) They spent the night trading shots and notes. \u201cWe were just like, \u2018Oh my God, we need to meet and cut loose,\u2019 \u201d says Bullock. \u201cAnd we did.\u201d The hangover, Bullock notes, was epic. Aniston recalls, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was sending her, but it was definitely stronger than what she was sending me.\u201d\nTheir rapport was so easy that they wondered why they hadn\u2019t spent time together before. They both love interior design, dated the actor Tate Donovan, and appreciate a practical joke: Bullock later crashed a junket interview to surprise her with tequila and limes. They shared something else too: \u201cWe were from that time in the business where no one wanted the ladies to be friends\u2014it was about pitting everyone against each other,\u201d Bullock says. \u201cWe were told we weren\u2019t supposed to do that\u2014meaning like and respect and honor each other.\u201d\nAniston has brought Bullock into her inner circle\u2014inviting her to holiday get-togethers, on spring break trips, to numerology readings. \u201cYou write down your birth date and, whether you believe in it or not, we\u2019re all scribbling down our thoughts and in it together,\u201d says Bullock. \u201cNothing is for her alone ever. Everything she does is for everyone else included.\u201d\nGwyneth Paltrow is another close friend, whom Aniston met decades ago when her Friends costar David Schwimmer was filming The Pallbearer. Their love interests overlapped off-screen as well as on. While discussing the genesis of her and Paltrow\u2019s relationship, Aniston says, \u201cIronically, I went to her and Brad\u2019s engagement party,\u201d meaning Pitt, the man who proposed to them both. Aniston and Paltrow\u2019s friendship outlasted both women\u2019s Pitt chapters, but I can\u2019t help but ask, do they ever talk about Pitt?\n\u201cOh, of course,\u201d Aniston says, waving her hand and sounding everything like Rachel Green. \u201cHow can we not? We\u2019re girls.\u201d But they trade wellness intel more than gossip. \u201cWe\u2019re always swapping advice\u2014\u2018What are you doing for this? What are you doing for that? Do you have a new doctor for that?\u2019 \u201d\nJason Bateman, whom Aniston met when he was starring with her friend on a \u201990s sitcom, is also an Aniston intimate. He\u2019s part of the chosen family, Aniston says. \u201cSometimes you look back at the person you were in your 20s, and you don\u2019t recognize that person or those people around you\u2026. But we\u2019ve grown up together.\u201d Adam Sandler is another \u201clifer\u201d whom Aniston met in her early 20s, through a mutual friend. \u201cAnything that happens in my life that he hears about, he\u2019s one of the first people that I hear from. He would lay down on the tracks for me.\u201d Aniston has gravitated back to both men onscreen\u2014with Bateman on five films, including Horrible Bosses, and with Sandler on both Murder Mystery movies for Netflix. \u201cAs we\u2019re getting older, I think we\u2019re realizing that quality of time spent is probably at the top of the what\u2019s-important list for us.\u201d\nEvery Sunday, Aniston gathers 10 to 15 people for dinner, often including Bateman; his wife, Amanda Anka (who is also close to Aniston); their daughters; and Jimmy Kimmel and his wife, Molly McNearney. Everyone sits at the same seat, with Aniston at the head. Bateman said that the group had to gently coax Aniston, a lover of Mexican cuisine, to broaden her menus. \u201cShe stumbled upon a burger that is almost identical to the In-N-Out burger,\u201d says Bateman, referring to the California chain. \u201cShe actually found some company to print up a bunch of the papers that are wrapped around the burgers with \u2018Jen-N-Out\u2019 on it. It looks exactly like the logo. You can either have the beef or chicken, the lettuce or a bun around it. Then usually one of us will bring dessert.\u201d\nAniston\u2019s in tune with her friends\u2019 kids too. \u201cShe almost makes us parents look bad because she\u2019s so incredibly attentive and consistent with her curiosity and warmth,\u201d says Bateman, referring to Aniston\u2019s relationship with Francesca, 18, and Maple, 13. \u201cShe\u2019s the first one to call or text about big dates in the girls\u2019 lives. She has questions about boyfriends.\u201d Asked if she\u2019d qualify as an aunt, Bateman says, \u201cAunts you might not see all the time. She\u2019s almost closer to a co-mom with Amanda. She\u2019s been a part of their lives from the moment they were born.\u201d He adds, \u201cIt is odd for them to even understand the public Jennifer Aniston.\u201d\nFrancesca has also been the lucky recipient of some of Aniston\u2019s wardrobe: Now when the families go on vacation, she says she\u2019ll realize Francesca is in one of her hand-me-downs. \u201cWell, there\u2019s my bikini. Your child is now wearing my bikinis. Whoa. We\u2019ve come a long way.\u201d\nThis is not the first time Aniston has allowed Vanity Fair into her inner sanctum. Twenty years ago, ahead of the release of her sexy Clive Owen collaboration, Derailed, she invited Leslie Bennetts into her Malibu beach house. It happened to be for Aniston\u2019s first interview following her split from Pitt. The 2005 story, \u201cThe Unsinkable Jennifer Aniston,\u201d featured an eat-your-heart-out photo shoot: She reclined in a white men\u2019s button-down, black panties, and thigh-highs.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t looked at that article in forever. I just remember the experience of doing it\u2014which was kind of jarring. It was also such a vulnerable time. But yeah, that was one for the memoirs.\u201d (She\u2019ll write a memoir, she says, \u201cwhen I have more to memoir.\u201d) \u201cJournalism back then felt more like a form of a sport,\u201d she continues. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously some PTSD we all have, which is why these scare me\u201d\u2014she means interviews\u2014\u201cHow are they going to misinterpret my words or take something out of context? And one line nowadays\u2026\u201d\nThough Aniston\u2019s positivity and resilience are threaded through the old Vanity Fair piece, her candid statements about her breakup\u2014and Pitt\u2019s relationship with Angelina Jolie\u2014made tabloid tidal waves and arguably launched the celebrity-gossip corner of the internet. Snarky blogs like Dlisted and Perez Hilton made a meal out of it all. Aniston calls that era of her tabloid life \u201cthe love triangle\u201d and details her survival approach: \u201cJust pick yourself up by the bootstraps and keep on walking, girl.\u201d\n\u201cIt was such juicy reading for people. If they didn\u2019t have their soap operas, they had their tabloids.\u201d Of the media frenzy, Aniston says, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame that it had to happen, but it happened. And boy did I take it personally.\u201d\n\u201cThey were sort of building us up and then tearing you down,\u201d she says before comparing herself to a pi\u00f1ata. Almost immediately she recognizes the line as one of her own\u2014Alex Levy deriding an invasion of privacy. Aniston puts her hands over her eyes monkey-emoji-style and asks, \u201cOh God, did I just quote The Morning Show?\u201d And then gets back on track: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a strong enough constitution to not get affected by it. We\u2019re human beings, even though some people don\u2019t want to believe we are,\u201d she says. \u201cThey think, You signed up for it, so you take it. But we really didn\u2019t sign up for that.\u201d\nSince the media crucible of her 2005 divorce, Aniston has developed an extrasensory awareness of any conversation subject that is adjacent to SEO clickbait territory. Alex Levy makes a power grab in season four, so I ask Aniston to tell me about a business negotiation that was a turning point for her. She tries to describe a professional moment without giving away any identifying intel. \u201cSorry to be cagey,\u201d she says. \u201cWe asked for something that was very reasonable based on what we would be bringing to the table. It allowed me to really understand the power of no. That was also in the day when [pay] equality was still a struggle.\u201d There are two women in the entertainment realm whose names she asks me to keep out of this piece after they come up. Considering The Morning Show\u2019s coverage of recent real-life political news, I ask about Donald Trump\u2013related storylines. Witherspoon\u2019s journalist character reports on the storming of the Capitol in season three, and season four begins in 2024, as Trump mounts his return to office. As such, he plays a role in the new episodes. \u201cMaking a TV show about political coverage in a deeply divisive time can be tricky,\u201d Aniston says diplomatically. \u201cYou want to appeal to all audiences.\u201d When I note that her character\u2019s love interest, a billionaire played by Jon Hamm, seems reminiscent of Elon Musk\u2014they\u2019re both daredevil rocket builders\u2014she swats away the comparison, in part because \u201cI don\u2019t find him desirable in any way or shape.\u201d\nThere are points in our conversation when Aniston seems to be less cautious about choosing her words. Like when I begin speaking her love language\u2014interior design\u2014and ask about the pair of men\u2019s hands sculpted in bronze on either side of her fireplace. \u201cWhen people are like, \u2018Are you an ass man? Are you a leg girl?\u2019 I like hands,\u201d she says, noting that she found the andirons in one of her favorite design stores, Blackman Cruz. \u201cHands are everything. My father had the most beautiful hands.\u201d These pieces were the first big purchase for the first home she decorated by herself, for herself.\nThe \u201990s are having a bit of a revival, but Aniston is surprised to hear that her Rachel Green wardrobe has been christened a nostalgic fashion ideal by Vogue, WWD, and many a Gen Z\u2019er. In 2019, Ralph Lauren released a tribute Friends collection inspired by Rachel, who worked for the designer according to canon. Hailey Bieber even seems to have emerged from Rachel\u2019s closet most days\u2014wearing plaid skirts, denim overalls, and loafers\u2014and even channeled the style of the Friends character for Halloween in 2023.\n\u201cI celebrate the \u201990s coming back. Except for those narrow sunglasses and the really thin eyebrows,\u201d says Aniston. \u201cI love vintage clothes from the decade. They fit me so well.\u201d\nRachel Green is reverberating through the culture for another reason: She, along with Carrie Bradshaw, is an obvious influence on the \u201cWest Village Girl,\u201d the archetype that Brock Colyar took viral in New York magazine: a young woman enjoying life in Manhattan\u2019s gougingly expensive, maximally Instagrammable neighborhood.\nRachel was from a rich family. But Aniston makes a point of noting in our conversation that she was not. Her father did not find steady onscreen success until the \u201980s. At times he couldn\u2019t pay the mortgage without help, according to the 1999 memoir by Aniston\u2019s mother. While discussing her good fortune, Aniston says, \u201cListen, I am so grateful. I came from nothing. We were broke. There\u2019s no nepo baby here.\u201d\nGrowing up in New York, Aniston lived with her mom in a modest Upper West Side apartment\u2014and eventually attended the LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, the public school of Fame fame. Her escape hatch from the household\u2019s postdivorce gloom were Laverne & Shirley, Happy Days, and One Day at a Time. Because she didn\u2019t have a VCR, Aniston recorded audio from her beloved shows and listened to episodes again and again on her Radio Shack tape player, learning the shows by heart. \u201cI was going to be Laverne or Shirley,\u201d she says. She partly manifested her future as a sitcom star\u2014Bullock refers to her as \u201cthe manifester\u201d\u2014and to some degree hoped her acting success would impress her father. \u201cAlways wanting to get Pop\u2019s approval\u2014it was the thing that drove me and was also my biggest heartbreak: trying to impress and prove your value to a man who\u2019s only capable of so much,\u201d Aniston says. She felt that if she made it as an actor, \u201cthen he will love me as much as I love him.\u201d Before he died in 2022, Aniston says that her dad expressed his pride in her: \u201cWe had a few of those moments.\u201d\nWith Friends, she did for others what Penny Marshall and Cindy Williams had done for her. While Aniston always knew Friends was a miracle of casting and cosmic kismet, she didn\u2019t realize the personal impact the show had until 2021\u2019s Friends reunion. During one segment, international fans relayed how they learned English by watching the show or found relief from dark personal times with it. Of acting, Aniston says, \u201cWhat helped raise me is something I got to put into the world and help other people. If [Friends] was the only thing on my r\u00e9sum\u00e9, I would be very happy and blessed.\u201d\nThe reunion was also a final curtain call for the cast of six. In 2023 Aniston\u2019s costar Matthew Perry was found dead from \u201cthe acute effects\u201d of ketamine, with drowning a contributing factor. \u201cWe did everything we could when we could,\u201d Aniston says of trying to help the actor during his long struggle with addiction\u2014Perry described his friends\u2019 efforts in his memoir, Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing. \u201cBut it almost felt like we\u2019d been mourning Matthew for a long time because his battle with that disease was a really hard one for him to fight. As hard as it was for all of us and for the fans, there\u2019s a part of me that thinks this is better,\u201d Aniston says, looking solemn and out toward the ocean. \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s out of that pain.\u201d\nSince Aniston\u2019s amicable split from actor Justin Theroux in 2018, she has not been publicly linked to any legitimate love interests. When I ask Bateman if he\u2019s ever set Aniston up on a date\u2014he can\u2019t recall that he has\u2014he says, \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising to me that she\u2019s not some serial dater, not because she\u2019s overly picky or snobby. You don\u2019t need to be some superhero to grab her attention. If you are comfortable in your skin, she gravitates to you. The challenge is for a guy to see past her fame and charisma and presence and beauty\u2014to not be distracted by that\u2014and tune into the stuff at the deep core.\u201d\nTabloid fanfic has recently linked her to Pedro Pascal after he and Aniston were photographed outside a West Hollywood restaurant, and to Barack Obama, after\u2026no one is quite sure. Some version of the rumor\u2014that the Friends star was dating the former president\u2014spread so prolifically that Aniston appeared on Kimmel\u2019s late-night show to formally shut it down. \u201cOf all the calls you get from your publicist\u2026and then it\u2019s that,\u201d Aniston said as Kimmel showed the cover of In Touch with the line \u201cThe Truth About Jen & Barack!\u201d (The magazine stopped short of claiming a romance.) Aniston says she knows Michelle Obama better than she does the former president and even saw her somewhat recently. \u201cI was lucky enough to have dinner with Michelle a month ago,\u201d she says, declining to share any additional detail aside from the fact that the rumor \u201cwasn\u2019t even brought up\u201d during their time together. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone really pays attention to reports like that if you\u2019re the subject of them.\u201d\nBullock says she and Aniston have hypothesized about some of the crazier reports. \u201cWe try to figure out the genesis of where some of these stories come from\u2026but 75 percent of the time, we just cannot. They\u2019re literally pulled out of the ether.\u201d Bullock understands the world\u2019s perpetual interest in Aniston\u2019s love life, though: \u201cShe\u2019s so beloved that you go, \u2018I want that person to have their person\u2019 even if that person doesn\u2019t want a person.\u201d\nSeveral weeks after we\u2019d last spoken, Aniston is linked in the tabloids to a new love interest\u2014this time, it\u2019s a handsome wellness guru and hypnotherapist named Jim Curtis. The two vacationed over the summer on Mallorca and in Big Sur, according to the reports\u2014in April, Aniston told Travel + Leisure that she had tried hypnosis to help overcome her fear of flying. Aniston\u2019s rep declined to comment on the rumor to VF, but the Morning Show star follows Curtis on social media and has liked his posts. In May, Aniston posted a picture of his book Shift: Quantum Manifestation Guide: A Workbook for Coding a New Consciousness. During our first conversation Aniston had told me, \u201cI have a real struggle, truthfully, about what to and not to share\u2026and also, social media is a constant struggle for me.\u201d It isn\u2019t that surprising she wouldn\u2019t want to go there: Within days after the first paparazzi photos are published (the Mallorca trip included Bateman and Anka), Curtis\u2019s name is linked with Aniston\u2019s in thousands of web stories.\nThis May, while Aniston was home, a 48-year-old man from Mississippi allegedly rammed his car into her gate. The accused stalker, whom prosecutors say had been flooding Aniston with emails, voicemails, and social media messages, was reportedly apprehended by Aniston\u2019s security until police arrived. (He has pleaded not guilty to felony stalking and felony vandalism but at press time was not standing trial; a judge found him mentally incompetent.) This is another subject that Aniston doesn\u2019t really want to discuss: \u201cPeople are out of their minds. Who wants to put that energy out there.\u201d Her security team, says Aniston, is \u201cnot glamorous in any way. It\u2019s a necessity.\u201d\nBullock says she and Aniston have talked about these concerns; Bullock had her own frightening experience in 2014 when a mentally ill stalker broke into her home while she was there.\nSometimes, Bullock says, \u201cIt makes me think, Do I really have to go outside and navigate the world? There\u2019s the cases where they got into the house, the cases where they\u2019re outside the house, the cases where you\u2019re on a film set and they figured out where you are, and the cases that no one hears about. It\u2019s ongoing. It\u2019s not a one-off. And it does create a mindset where your home also unfortunately becomes your fortress.\u201d\nBullock says she and Aniston push each other out of their houses: \u201cThere\u2019s a motivation of going, \u2018Okay, we need to go somewhere. Where are we going?\u2019 \u201d Says Aniston, \u201cI\u2019m desperately trying not to Howard Hughes myself.\u201d\nFor a while Bullock and Aniston shared a fear of flying. \u201cThe two of us on a plane\u2014it\u2019s the most pathetic thing to look at,\u201d Bullock says. \u201cUsually it\u2019s us grabbing each other\u2019s arms from across the table with our heads down.\u201d\nBut two spring breaks ago, when Bullock was \u201cnot in a great place,\u201d Aniston summoned strength for her friend. \u201cShe just held onto my hand and goes, \u2018This is just a bump\u2019 \u201d\u2014and talked her through the flight. \u201cI was like, \u2018Who the fuck are you right now?\u2019 \u201d\nAniston says she can still feel afraid of flying\u2014the hypnotherapy was to help curb it, as were the calm apps she tried. But sometimes when her friends are really scared, \u201cAll of a sudden, my fear falls away and I get to take care of them. When there\u2019s someone in need of being calmed, I have such empathy for it that all of a sudden my fear goes out the window.\u201d\nAt 56, Aniston has elegantly navigated all kinds of turbulence. She is now trying to slow down her fast-paced work schedule to live more life. Aside from The Morning Show, Aniston is producing a 9 to 5 remake scripted by Oscar-winning screenwriter Diablo Cody that will explore generational issues. (Aniston was slated to join the cast at one point but currently won\u2019t be; offers are out to other actors.) She will also costar as the narcissistic mother in a series inspired by Jennette McCurdy\u2019s best-selling book, I\u2019m Glad My Mom Died, which chronicles McCurdy\u2019s journey as a child star and her complicated relationship with her mother, and which resonated with Aniston. And she still fosters a dream of appearing on Broadway: \u201cGrowing up in New York City and seeing Annie, you just get swept into a fantasy world. I want to do that.\u201d\nShe approaches her career much differently now. \u201cAs a young actor, you can forget that you are the one who\u2019s earning income for the people around you,\u201d she says, crediting her manager Aleen Keshishian with helping her assert herself. \u201cShe would say, \u2018You\u2019re the boss. You pay us. Don\u2019t lose sight of your power in that. Don\u2019t become an asshole or bitch, but don\u2019t lose your voice.\u2019 \u201d Aniston adds, \u201cIf there\u2019s an area in my life where I have no fear, it\u2019s in my career\u2014of speaking up for what I want. I don\u2019t do it in a scary or mean way. I just know my value.\u201d\nThough Alex Levy thrives on adrenaline in the newsroom, Aniston has had to take a step back from the 24/7 panic cycles of real-world news. \u201cI could feel my anxiety and cortisol levels reaching a height that was not working. We weren\u2019t designed as human beings to digest this much information from all over the world in the split second when it happens. I\u2019d rather keep a somewhat naive perspective than be in fear and negativity and rage and anger.\u201d She tries to block out cynicism and ego. Even though she\u2019s been a public figure for at least 35 years, the awareness of who she is \u201cstill hits me sideways sometimes.\u201d Aniston prefers to look at that discomfort with fame as a good thing, presumably because it means she isn\u2019t grounded in it. \u201cYou have to manage it and put it in its proper place and into its proper size. Because otherwise, if you don\u2019t\u2026I\u2019ve gone through many\u2026.\u201d She takes a split-second pause before deciding to keep the specifics to herself. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to figure it out.\u201d\nA follow-up phone call with Aniston ends when her Pvolve trainer knocks on the door for another workout session. As we say goodbye, I tell the actor that I\u2019m not a crystal person but I\u2019m going to try amethyst to see if it has the same calming effect on me.\n\u201cIf my home can bring your nervous system into the parasympathetic nervous system, then I should open up a business. Because God knows we need that at this time.\u201d For now, though, the familiar star offers a recommendation with warmth and well-wishes.\n\u201cI think you should get some rose quartz\u201d\u2014unconditional love\u2014\u201cand amethyst. And also for this year, the year of the snake\u2014now this is where I start to sound like a crazy person\u2014white jade.\u201d For grounding.\nThen she tosses off one more self-deprecatory line in wry, easy, Aniston fashion: \u201cI\u2019ve basically incorporated all of the healing modalities in order to create a calm environment in the chaos of the wonderful industry and the world at large.\u201d\nMore Great Stories From Vanity Fair\nWeapons Ending Explained\nCan And Just Like That\u2026 Actually Stick the Landing This Time?\nThe Real Problem With Sydney Sweeney\u2019s American Eagle Ad\nThe Heartbreaking Love Story of Liam Neeson and Natasha Richardson\nInside the Celebrity Boat Trip That Was All Over Your Feeds\nInside King Charles\u2019s Lesser-Known Castle\nThe Hidden Case of the Transgender Baronet\nFrom the Archive: Dating Jeffrey Epstein"

      "text": "Doctor who gave Matthew Perry ketamine and called him 'a moron' pleads guilty to role in his death\nThe doctor who gave actor Matthew Perry doses of ketamine before he overdosed and drowned in the hot tub of his LA home has pleaded guilty to playing a role in his death.\nDr. Salvador Plasencia appeared in federal court on Wednesday and was mostly quiet as the judge went over the plea agreement for nearly an hour.\nPlasencia, who was often called 'Dr. P', was facing a potential 40-year prison sentence had he not taken the plea deal.\nHe is expected to return to court on December 3 for sentencing and will face up to 10 years in federal prison.\nDr. Salvador Plasencia leaves federal court on July 23 after pleading guilty to four counts of distributing ketamine to actor Matthew Perry before his death in October 2023\nThe Friends actor struggled with depression and drug abuse for years\nWhen asked by the judge if he and his lawyers had considered all the possibilities of pleas and sentencing in the case, the 43-year-old physician replied, 'They've considered everything.'\nHe had previously pleaded not guilty, but in exchange for the guilty pleas prosecutors have agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.\nThe Santa Monica physician is the fourth person who was indicted on criminal charges in connection to the Friends' star's death on Oct. 28, 2023.\nJasveen Sangha, was known to her customers as the 'Ketamine Queen', is the only defendant who has not decided to take a plea deal in connection to the actor\u2019s death. She is slated to return to court August 19.\nJasveen Sangha, aka the 'Ketamine Queen', is the only defendant left who has yet to plead guilty\nDr. Mark Chavez also plead guilty to charges in connection to Matthew Perry's death\nSangha remains in custody in Los Angeles awaiting trial.\nOthers who have plead guilty include Perry's assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, who discovered the actor's lifeless body in his hot tub.\nThe LA County Medical Examiner's Office determined that the actor \u2014 who had battled substance abuse issues throughout his life \u2014 died of 'acute effects of ketamine.'\nPerry had been receiving ketamine infusion therapy as treatment for his depression, but the last session was a week and a half before he died, the medical examiner determined.\nKetamine is only in your system for three to four hours, which means it did not lead directly to his death.\n'At the high levels of ketamine found in his postmortem blood specimens, the main lethal effects would be from both cardiovascular overstimulation and respiratory depression,' the medical examiner, Raffi Djabourian, concluded.\nTwo others \u2014 physician Mark Chavez, of San Diego and Erik Fleming, 54, of Hawthorne \u2014 also plead guilty to conspiracy to distribute ketamine causing death.\nIn his plea agreement, Plasencia admitted he met Perry through another patient connected him with Perry.\nHe admitted supplying Perry with 20 vials of ketamine totaling 100 mg of the drug, along with ketamine lozenges and syringes about a month before the actor's death.\nHe also admitted enlisting Dr. Chavez, who supplied the drugs. In court documents, Plasencia texted Chavez: 'I wonder how much this moron will pay,' referring to Perry.\nMatthew Perry's longtime assistant, Kenny Iwamasa, pleaded guilty in connection to his former boss's death. Prosecutors allege the assistant injected Perry with ketamine on the day the actor died\nFederal prosecutors said Plasencia sold the drugs to the actor for $4,500. He also told Chavez to keep the supplies coming so they could become the actor's 'go-to'.\nPerry - who had long struggled with addiction and staying sober - told Iwamasa to procure illegal drugs for him in late September 2023.\nIwamasa allegedly obtained the ketamine he gave to Perry from Plasencia and Fleming. The assistant reportedly met with Plasencia at least seven times between September 30 and October 28, 2023.\nOn the day of his death, Perry reportedly told Iwamasa to 'shoot me up with a big one,' and was injected with ketamine by the assistant three times, according to his plea agreement.\nProsecutors allege Iwamasa also began obtaining ketamine for Perry from Fleming and Sangha beginning in mid-October 2023.\nAfter discussing prices with Iwamasa, Fleming allegedly coordinated the drug sales with Sangha, and brought cash from Iwamasa to Sangha\u2019s stash house in North Hollywood.\nIn October 24, 2023, Fleming allegedly told Iwamasa that the ketamine was 'on its way to our girl,' referring to Sangha.\nProsecutors allege Sangha distributed ketamine and other illegal drugs from her stash house in North Hollywood since 2019."

New Year\u2019s resolutions abound and I envy those who are able race back into the gym, jump headlong into a 7-day detox juice cleanse and schedule some time to reboot.\nOn the other hand, I\u2019m still trying to clear the backlog e-mails that should have been answered in December. Perhaps I need to search out some supernatural intervention like the \u201cLucky Man\u201d in James\u2019s new show.\nAs my son and I stepped out to do the groceries the other night, the chilly evening gust reminded me of another January night 25 years ago.\nI was 15 years old and it was an astonishingly cold Canadian evening just after New Year\u2019s. Having grown up in Canada, Matthew would know exactly the kind of night I mean. My family were huddled around the fireplace when the doorbell rang.\nThe man standing at the door was probably my height, but much older. Gray hair peaked out from underneath a threadbare, snow-covered cap. His coat was at least a few seasons past it\u2019s best before date and he wore running shoes when the icy footpath called for boots.\nHe was selling coupons for a local garage. An oil, transmission and engine check for $20. Judging by the wad of coupon books in his shivering hands, it didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d sold very many.\nMy first instinct was to buy one. I even had a $20 bill in my pocket. I should have at least invited him in for a cup of tea. Instead, perhaps annoyed at having my warmth disturbed, I said a firm \u201cno thank you\u201d and closed the door. As I turned around, I felt immediate regret.\nI quickly opened the door to call to him but he was gone. I even pulled on my jacket and ran out into the night. It was as if he\u2019d vanished.\nThere\u2019s no dramatic ending to this story, but it\u2019s stayed with me all this time, because 25 years later I still wish I\u2019d acted differently.\n\u201cThis being human\u201d, counselled the mystic Rumi, \u201cis a guest house. A joy, a depression, some momentary awareness comes as an unexpected visitor. Welcome and entertain them all! Be grateful for whoever comes, because each has been sent as a guide from beyond.\u201d\nThe possibilities for blessing are all around us. My resolution is to pay closer attention to when they pop up and try to capture them, whether it\u2019s with smile, a hand up or a warm cup of tea. Juice cleanses, thankfully, are not required.\nBroadcast\n- Fri 22 Jan 2016 06:30BBC Radio 2"

      "text": "- Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com\nJennifer Aniston offered a rare, unguarded look into her private life while reflecting on everything a frightening stalking incident and bizarre dating rumors to the grief of losing longtime friend Matthew Perry.\nDuring her vulnerable interview with Vanity Fair, the Friends star, 56, confessed she often wrestles with 'what to and not to share.'\nThis includes finally breaking her silence about the 48-year-old man from Mississippi, who allegedly crashed his car into the gate of her $21 Bel Air mansion.\nProsecutors say he had been sending her emails, voicemails, and social media messages for some time prior to her security detaining him until police arrived.\nCarwyle, 48, has been charged with felony stalking, vandalism and threatening bodily harm and faces up to three years in jail after what one of Aniston's lawyers called 'a two-year campaign of harassment and stalking'.\nHe has since plead not guilty to felony stalking and felony vandalism, and at press time was deemed mentally incompetent to stand trial.\nJennifer Aniston offered a rare, unguarded look into her private life while reflecting on everything from bizarre dating rumors to the grief of losing longtime friend Matthew Perry\n'People are out of their minds,' the actress said. 'Who wants to put that energy out there.'\nShe proceeded to stress her security detail, outside her home, is simply 'necessity' and 'not glamorous in any way.'\nHer longtime pal Sandra Bullock, who endured her own terrifying stalker incident in 2014, stressed those experiences create a fortress mentality.\n'It makes me think, \"Do I really have to go outside and navigate the world?\" \u2026 It's ongoing. It's not a one-off.'\nFor both actresses, fears once extended to flying.\n'The two of us on a plane, it's the most pathetic thing to look at,' Bullock joked.\nBut during one difficult spring break trip, Aniston put her own fear aside to comfort Bullock.\n'She just held onto my hand and goes, \"This is just a bump\" \u2026 I was like, \"Who the fuck are you right now?\"' she recalled.\nThe Friends star, 56, broke her silence about the 48-year-old man from Mississippi , who allegedly crashed his car into the gate of her Bel Air mansion (Jimmy Wayne Carwyle pictured shirtless and behind glass in court in May)\nCarwyle, from Mississippi , was arrested on May 5 after allegedly ramming his car into the gates of Aniston's home (pictured) that sits behind 15-feet high privacy hedges\nAniston says hypnotherapy and calming apps have helped her in the air, but her empathy for others can override her own fear.\n'When there's someone in need of being calmed, I have such empathy for it that all of a sudden my fear goes out the window,' the star noted.\nSince her split from ex-husband Justin Theroux in 2018, Aniston hasn't been publicly linked to any confirmed love interests and rarely talks about her love life to the media.\nHer friend Jason Bateman, when asked if he's ever played matchmaker for her, admitted to the outlet that he hasn't.\n'It's not surprising to me that she's not some serial dater, not because she's overly picky or snobby,' he said. 'You don't need to be some superhero to grab her attention. If you are comfortable in your skin, she gravitates to you. The challenge is for a guy to see past her fame and charisma and presence and beauty\u2014to not be distracted by that\u2014and tune into the stuff at the deep core.'\n'People are out of their minds,' the actress said.
