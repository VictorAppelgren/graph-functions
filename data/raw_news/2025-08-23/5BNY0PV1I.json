  "title": "My Kitchen Feels Cleaner and Safer After This One Change",
  "description": "Cleanliness isn\u2019t always about scrubbing harder.",
  "content": "Sometimes, the smallest adjustments make the biggest difference. For me, it was an almost laughably simple addition. Adding plastic liners to the bottom of every shelf made my drawers cleaner and changed how I feel about my entire space.\n\nThe bottoms of drawers and shelves are among the most overlooked and neglected spots in any home. They rarely catch the eye until that moment you reach for a jar of peanut butter, and your hand comes away sticky, or you notice an unexplained crust beneath the olive oil bottle.\n\nIn these hidden corners, grime accumulates silently over time. Dust settles, crumbs spill, sauces leak, and containers slowly ooze residue. The buildup is gradual and insidious because these areas don\u2019t attract regular cleaning attention. When you finally do get around to tidying up, it often requires a deep, time-consuming scrub to restore the surfaces to a minimally hygienic state.\n\nI vividly remember scraping at an old sticky patch beneath a spice rack. The frustration of having to empty an entire drawer just to clean one small spot felt frustrating and overwhelming. This happened more than once and felt like trying to tame a persistent, unseen mess.\n\nThis experience made me rethink: what if the shelves and drawers never got dirty in the first place?\n\nPlastic shelf liners are exactly as they sound\u2014protective barriers that sit on the bases of drawers, cupboards, and pantry shelves. They come in various materials, including flexible plastic or rubber, and in different styles, including clear, textured, patterned, grippy, or smooth.\n\nSome liners have adhesive backs to stick firmly in place; others rely on their weight and surface texture to stay put without damaging the shelf underneath. The ones I selected were clear, non-adhesive liners from Costco with a lightly textured grip on one side. This texture prevents sliding, while the non-adhesive backing allows for easy removal and cleaning.\n\nThe crucial benefit is that these liners absorb all the abuse that would otherwise stain, warp, or rot the shelf surfaces themselves\n\nThe shift became apparent the very next time I spilled dry rice while restocking the pantry. Before using liners, spilled grains would scatter into every crevice and roll under containers. Cleaning this mess was a tedious, multi-step process. Unloading the entire shelf, sweeping by hand, then hunting down every last grain.\n\nNow, I simply lift the liner, funnel the rice into the trash, give the liner a quick shake outdoors, and set it back down. The whole process takes less than a minute. Once you eliminate the underlying cause of the mess, you begin to realize how much time goes into \u201cmaintenance cleaning.\"\n\nThis ease applies to everything: spice dust, leaky honey, flour, cooking oil, and syrup rings. Rather than cleaning the shelves, I simply clean the liners. This subtle difference has saved me hours and alleviated the mental burden of worrying about sticky residue hiding beneath dishes. You don't need useful smart kitchen devices to improve the quality of your home; simple objects like this can have a noticeable impact.\n\nBeyond convenience, shelf liners protect your stored items in unexpected ways. Glass bottles don\u2019t clink as loudly. Plates remain more stable and don\u2019t slide around. Even my mixing bowls have fewer scratches on their undersides. Liners cushion objects and reduce the risk of damage.\n\nThe effect is even more pronounced in drawers. My utensil organizer used to rattle with every movement, now it stays put. Knives no longer scrape against the wood base, and metal measuring cups are quieter when dropped in.\n\nPlastic liners create a quiet, grounded feeling that makes the space feel more stable. It\u2019s a small detail, but it makes the entire kitchen feel more composed and intentional.\n\nSimilar to other simple DIY kitchen projects, installing the liners is as straightforward and quick as you can imagine.\n\nAfter emptying and wiping down each drawer and shelf, I simply made my measurements with a tape measure, drew my marks on the liner itself, and cut straight lines along the studded pattern. Each piece fit into its respective place like a glove.\n\nIf you\u2019re not good with measurements, you can also opt to lay the liner over the surface, eyeball the dimensions, then trim it along the edges until it fits perfectly. No glue, no screws, no complex measurements\u2014just unroll, cut, and place. The entire process is as simple as a few straight cuts.\n\nSince adding liners, I open cabinets with confidence, reaching into back corners without hesitation. I no longer question whether the surface is sanitary or worry about what I might touch.\n\nThere\u2019s a low-level tension we carry when unsure about a space\u2019s cleanliness. It\u2019s rarely conscious, but it lingers. Removing that anxiety has made cooking, cleaning, and snacking more enjoyable. A kitchen doesn\u2019t need to be spotless to feel safe, it just needs to be manageable. Liners gave me that sense of control.\n\nThe psychological impact goes beyond simple convenience. There\u2019s a calming effect in knowing the surfaces beneath your belongings are protected and easy to maintain. It fosters a sense of order in the space, which in turn influences how comfortable you feel there.\n\nYou could deep-clean shelves weekly, buy expensive custom inserts, or invest in over-engineered organizers. But liners offer the simplest, most cost-effective upgrade I\u2019ve made.\n\nReusable paper liners tend to bunch and become soggy. Adhesive pads can tear your shelves when removed. Foam liners absorb liquids, leading to unpleasant odors and damage.\n\nPlastic shelf liners are waterproof, durable, and easy to clean. They last a long time\u2014even with daily use, I haven\u2019t replaced a single piece since installation. They're also safe to store just about anywhere, unlike many other household items you shouldn't store under your sink.\n\nCost was another pleasant surprise. The two rolls I purchased as a bundle cost $26. An hour of my time yielded a lasting improvement that feels like something out of a newly remodeled kitchen.\n\nMost kitchen upgrades fall into two categories: purely aesthetic (like backsplash) or painfully expensive (like new cabinetry). This simple upgrade is a practical, affordable change that makes you ask, \u201cWhat else have I overlooked?\u201d\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve extended liners to bathroom drawers and under-sink cabinets, resulting in a cleaner, safer, and easier to maintain home.\n\nAt first glance, spending $26 on plastic shelf liners might seem trivial, but the value quickly becomes apparent when you consider the time and effort saved.\n\nTraditional deep-cleaning sessions can be lengthy and unpleasant, often requiring harsh chemicals that may degrade shelves over time. In contrast, liners simplify maintenance, turning what used to be a chore into a quick wipe-down. Beyond cleaning, they protect your cabinetry from stains, scratches, and moisture damage, potentially extending the life of your kitchen fixtures.\n\nWhen you factor in the mental relief of a consistently tidy space, the modest upfront cost offers ongoing returns that far outweigh pricier renovations or cleaning products. Sometimes, a small, inexpensive change creates the biggest impact.\n\nIf you\u2019re considering liners, here are a few recommendations:\n\u2022 Measure first: Shelves typically range from 16 to 18 inches deep, but drawer sizes vary widely. Accurate measurements prevent waste.\n\u2022 Avoid adhesive liners: Non-stick liners are easier to remove, replace, and clean.\n\u2022 Choose textured or grippy liners: Smooth liners tend to slide around.\n\u2022 Skip scented liners: They can develop unpleasant odors over time, and may clash with spices, cleaning products, or other scented objects you keep in your drawers.\n\u2022 Buy extra: You\u2019ll find more applications than you expect, such as toolboxes, closet shelves, under coffee machines\u2014the possibilities are endless.\n\nIn just one afternoon, and for less than $30, I made my kitchen feel cleaner, safer, and more organized. It\u2019s rare that such a small change offers such a meaningful payoff, but this one truly does. If you\u2019ve been struggling with crumbs, stickiness, or the subtle dread of mystery stains, I highly recommend giving this a try. You\u2019ll notice the difference immediately.",

      "text": "Many people treat the space underneath their kitchen sink like a larger junk drawer. But you might be surprised to know that many items in your home shouldn't be kept under the sink.\n5 Cleaning Rags, Sponges, and Paper Products\nFor the sake of accessibility and convenience, many people throw rags for cleaning the kitchen, grocery bags, and similar goods under the sink. Sponges are another common item of this type, since they're used all the time for washing dishes. While these three items sound like they'd be ideally suited for storage under the sink, doing so is a mistake.\nAlthough rare, you could have plumbing problems in your kitchen, where even a small leak could cause significant damage. That water getting where it's not intended could destroy many items placed underneath, including paper products and those mentioned above. Additionally, the cabinets below a sink are prone to being a breeding ground for mold and mildew, which you don\u2019t want to spread to other areas of your home.\nInstead of storing cleaning rags, sponges, and paper products under the sink, place them in an adjacent drawer or a utility closet. They\u2019ll still be in the kitchen, but better protected.\n4 Food and Perishable Goods\nFor many of the same reasons, food and perishable goods have no business being stored underneath the kitchen sink. The potential for mold and bacteria to accumulate under the sink is obviously bad news for any food you\u2019re planning to eat.\nThere\u2019s also the possibility of pest infestation. It's easier to miss the signs of rodents and other pests getting into your food when it's hidden under the sink, compared to in plain sight.\nThis limited accessibility and visibility are other reasons to put your fresh fruit elsewhere. Forgetting where food is only to find it spoiled or rotten later is a mess, and not enjoyable.\nKeep anything perishable in the fridge, where it's still easily accessible (though that might require some rearranging for best results). For items that don\u2019t require a cooler temperature, such as canned goods, flour, cereal, and pasta, a kitchen pantry is best. At a minimum, place these items in a dedicated kitchen cabinet that\u2019s easily accessible.\nWhile this comes as no surprise, it won't help you keep indoor plants alive to put them under the sink, either. They need their light!\n3 Household Chemicals and Pesticides\nWhile the various sprays in your home have plenty of uses, all those chemicals mean they can also be dangerous. By placing them below the sink, these items become easily accessible to children and pets. And because the area under the kitchen sink typically lacks adequate ventilation, those chemicals can leak and accumulate dangerous fumes.\nMany household chemicals are also highly flammable. So, storing them in an enclosed space near a potential heat source (like hot water pipes) is a significant fire risk.\nIn my home, I store all household chemicals in a locked, but ventilated, cabinet in my basement. It\u2019s out of the reach of young children and nowhere near food. And inside the cabinet, the chemicals are stored on a non-absorbent surface.\n2 Extra Trash Bags\nThe under-sink area is also a poor choice for storing extra trash bags or plastic bags from stores. Biodegradable or compostable bags also have no place in the kitchen under the sink. While you don't want them to get wet or grow mold, there\u2019s another reason not to store bags here: child and pet safety. A young child or your dog could face a suffocation risk by playing with a bag.\nIdeally, you should store bags in a utility closet or a cabinet located above the sink, out of the reach of children. If you have no place to store your many trash bags, consider replacing them with a smaller number of reusable ones and placing them in the same area as you would the others.\n1 Small Appliances and Electronics\nAbout a year ago, I found myself swept up in the personal blender craze. My short-term obsession became so bad that I bought two, as the first one didn\u2019t perform that well. Alas, I soon found both small appliances sitting idle under my kitchen sink.\nWhen the time came to use one, I realized one of its batteries had started to leak. While I don\u2019t know what happened for sure, I imagine a water leak a few months before probably caused it.\nThis illustrates why you shouldn\u2019t store small appliances, handy smart kitchen devices, or electronics under your sink. Besides the potential for water damage, pest infestation, and chemical exposure, the appliance itself can cause problems, especially if it\u2019s battery-operated.\nInstead of storing these small appliances under the sink, place them on your kitchen tabletop where they are easier to see and access. If that\u2019s not possible, put them in a basement or dedicated pantry.\nLiving under the kitchen isn't the right condition for all home items. Some could get damaged by being stored in an area that\u2019s closed and prone to water leaks. Others shouldn\u2019t be there because you might forget about them, while still others are dangerous items that shouldn\u2019t be stored in confined areas."

      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\n- You can use smart kitchen devices for several purposes, such as brewing coffee and cooking food.\n- Automating your daily tasks will save significant time and may ease the clean-up process.\n- Use smart kitchen devices if you already have the non-smart versions or know you'll use them.\nSome smart kitchen appliances are less useful than others, but that doesn\u2019t mean you should ditch them altogether. Keep reading to discover six of the best you should consider getting for your own home, with real-life use cases.\n1 Air Fryer\nI like cooking my food for the health benefits of knowing exactly what\u2019s going into my body and I also find it quite theraputic. However, that does not mean I want to actively be in the kitchen all the time. And while I eat the same base ingredients most of the time, I sometimes struggle for inspiration and ideas. In both instances, a smart air fryer can play a key role.\nIn my opinion, getting recipes with a smart air fryer is one of its biggest advantages. While I\u2019ve been cooking my own food for over a decade, I still like trying new things. And for someone new to healthy eating, I can imagine\u2014based on my experiences as a beginner\u2014that not having to search online makes a big difference.\nAnother benefit of using smart air fryers is that you can pre-set them if you eat your meals at a certain time. When I meal prep, for example, I used to dislike eating cold food (but I disliked the labor of reheating even more). In my opinion, a smart air fryer is a viable alternative in these instances.\n2 Coffee Maker\nI\u2019m very sensitive to caffeine and try to limit my consumption to days when I don\u2019t exercise in the morning. However, I enjoy having coffee as a treat\u2014meaning that a good coffee maker would add value to my life. Smart coffee machines can be a viable alternative to an ordinary coffee maker, and they\u2019re often not as expensive as you might think.\nSmart coffee makers give you more options for creating the exact drink you want, saving you the time required to visit a caf\u00e9. You can also set your coffee to brew while you\u2019re getting ready for the day rather than manually going to the kitchen and adjusting your settings. Just make sure you put the mug where it should be the night before!\nAnother advantage of a smart coffee maker is that you can turn it off when you leave the house without needing to press any buttons on the machine. If you aren\u2019t sure where to start, consider checking out these great smart coffee machines.\n3 Pressure Cooker\nI\u2019ve always loved pressure cookers, especially if I want to prepare my meals beforehand. Recipes like meatballs, pulled chicken or pork, and various soups taste so much better when left to cook on a lower heat for hours. Smart pressure cookers can make everything much easier and they have many of the same benefits as a smart air fryer.\nOne of my biggest annoyances with an ordinary pressure cooker was that I sometimes found it harder to release the pressure after my meal was ready. This problem is eliminated with a smart pressure cooker because your device will do it automatically.\nWhile you can find recipes online, you\u2019ll sometimes need to scale things up or down depending on the specific number of ingredients that you\u2019re using. I do not like math in any way, shape, or form; one particularly great thing about smart pressure cookers is that you can use presets to automatically scale your cooking requirements.\nAnother limitation I found with ordinary pressure cookers was that you had to regularly walk into the kitchen and see how your food was doing. This wasn\u2019t a problem when I worked from home, but it naturally became an issue when I realized how much I disliked working from home and rented a coworking space. With a smart pressure cooker, you can check how your meal is doing via an app instead.\n4 Kettle With Adjustable Temperature\nSince I was born in the UK, I have a natural inclination towards a good cup of tea when it\u2019s cold outside. Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014an ordinary kettle usually works well without a problem. However, the majority of kettles don\u2019t let you control the temperature. So, if you\u2019re not happy with the result, you normally have to wait for your drink to cool down.\nThis isn\u2019t a problem for me (luckily, I\u2019m also part Italian, and we have a special skill for drinking beverages while they\u2019re still piping hot). But wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could literally just choose the temperature and avoid all problems? Well, a smart kettle can allow you to do precisely that.\nMany smart kettles let you choose the preferred temperature for your water, and you can often pick how long you want the liquid to be warm. So, if you\u2019re fed up with manually turning on your kettle (or the temperature not being right for you), you should strongly consider getting one.\nI\u2019d recommend getting a smart kettle instead of a coffee maker if you like pressing your coffee instead of having a machine making it for you.\n5 Smart Water Purifier\nOne thing I\u2019ve learned when taking my health more seriously is that \u201csafe\u201d drinking water doesn\u2019t always mean \u201coptimal\u201d. While purifiers won\u2019t necessarily get rid of everything, I have found getting one to be quite beneficial; the same goes for my LARQ water bottle (which self-cleans every few hours, and yes, I really did spend $100+ on a water bottle).\nWith a smart water purification system, you can always have clean water available for hot and cold drinks.\nIf you don\u2019t want to buy a kettle or coffee maker but still enjoy warm beverages, some smart water purifiers will also let you adjust the temperature. However, I would keep in mind that you may need to be more physically present than you would with a smart coffee maker. So, if you want your coffee ready after your morning shower or run, it\u2019s a good idea to get a smart coffee maker instead.\n6 Smart Blender\nI never realized how much I needed a blender until I moved into a new house and didn\u2019t have one available. Smoothies are one of my favorite post-workout \u201csnacks\u201d, and they\u2019re also a great weekend treat. While they\u2019re easy to manually clean (and also make the smoothies themselves), it is nice if you can free up some of that work.\nSince I typically like to take a shower when back from the gym and prepare for my day, I would prefer to focus more on my time doing that. With a smart blender, you can use an app to blend your ingredients and have everything ready when needed.
