      "summary": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom and lawmakers have reached a deal with Uber and Lyft that lets rideshare drivers unionize while remaining independent contractors, and will cut insurance costs for underinsured drivers. The agreement includes a collective bargaining bill backed by SEIU and a measure that lowers insurance requirements from $1 million to $60,000 per individual and $300,000 per accident. The deal aims to improve driver wages and benefits, reduce rider fares, and address issues like deactivation and lack of benefits. The legislation must still pass the Senate and Assembly before becoming law.",
