  "title": "Trump Says He May Allow Lawsuit Against Powell Over Fed Renovation",
  "description": "Trump in a social media post on Tuesday resumed his criticism of the Fed chair over the central bank\u2019s decision to hold interest rates steady and again hammered Powell over the renovation work.  \u201cI am, though, considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed because of the horrible, and grossly incompetent, job he has done in managing the construction of the Fed Buildings.\u201d",
  "content": "President Donald Trump said he is weighing a lawsuit against Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell over the renovation of the central bank\u2019s headquarters, a project whose cost overruns have drawn scrutiny.\n\nTrump in a social media post on Tuesday resumed his criticism of the Fed chair over the central bank\u2019s decision to hold interest rates steady and again hammered Powell over the renovation work.\n\u2022 New York Warns of $34 Billion Budget Hole, Biggest Since 2009 Crisis\n\u2022 To Head Off Severe Storm Surges, Nova Scotia Invests in \u2018Living Shorelines\u2019\n\u2022 For Homeless Cyclists, Bikes Bring an Escape From the Streets\n\n\u201cThe damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable. Fortunately, the economy is sooo good that we\u2019ve blown through Powell and the complacent Board,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI am, though, considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed because of the horrible, and grossly incompetent, job he has done in managing the construction of the Fed Buildings.\u201d\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, when asked if the administration was considering suing the Fed chair over the renovation, responded \u201cthat\u2019s what the president is saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s considering a lawsuit,\u201d she told reporters at a briefing later Tuesday, adding that she would not speak on the matter further. \u201cI will allow the president to do that himself.\u201d\n\nAsked if a lawsuit would fix problems with the project, Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro in an interview Tuesday responded \u201check, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, look, it gets your attention. It\u2019s like, what is he doing there?,\u201d Navarro said on Bloomberg Television\u2019s , accusing Powell of not paying attention to the cost of the work.\n\nThe yield curve steepened after Trump\u2019s comments, with 10-year yields rebounding from the aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s consumer price index numbers and hitting a session high.\n\nData released earlier Tuesday showed underlying inflation picked up in July, though prices of goods rose at a more muted pace, tempering concerns about tariff-driven price pressures and raising expectations for a Fed rate cut in September.\n\nThe renovation work has become a flashpoint in Trump\u2019s pressure campaign against Powell and the central bank for not lowering borrowing costs and saw him tour the construction site last month in a rare presidential visit to the Fed\u2019s headquarters. That visit saw a brief detente between Trump and Powell and the president appearing to downplay some of his concerns over the work there.",
