  "title": "Canada wildfire season already second worst on record as experts warn of \u2018new reality\u2019",
  "description": "More than 470 Canadian fires classified as \u2018out of control\u2019 as scientists say climate change exacerbating the burning",
  "content": "With hundreds of wildfires burning out of control, Canada\u2019s 2025 fire season is already the second-worst on record, as scientists report climate change is prolonging and exacerbating the burning, leading to more destruction, evacuations and smoke-filled skies.\n\nMore than 470 fires across the country are currently classified as \u201cout of control\u201d, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC).\n\n7,318,421 hectares of land in Canada have burned due to wildfires this year \u2013 close to 78% more than the five-year average of 4,114,516 hectares, according to the CIFFC\u2019s latest data.\n\nThe 2025 fire season is only behind the explosive 2023 wildfire season, which resulted in an astounding 17,203,625 hectares burned.\n\n\u201cThis is our new reality\u2026 the warmer it gets, the more fires we see,\u201d said Mike Flannigan, the BC research chair for predictive services, emergency management and fire science at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops.\n\nA June analysis on the 2025 fire season in Canada published by United Nations University in Shibuya, Japan, concluded that the fires are a \u201cstark manifestation\u201d of climate change and that warm, dry weather in the spring resulted in temperatures 2.5C above average.\n\nThe warmer temperatures extend the fire season and increase the frequency of lightning that sparks fires, said Flannigan. A hotter climate also causes the atmosphere to suck moisture out of fuel, dead vegetation and the forest floor \u2013 creating ideal conditions for fires to start, he explained.\n\n\u201cIt means more of the material is dried out, is available to burn when the fire does come, it leads to bigger flames, higher intensity, which gets to be difficult to impossible to extinguish,\u201d he said.\n\nSo far, the worst of the fires have been concentrated in the prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, which together account for about 60% of the hectares burned so far this year in Canada.\n\nTens of thousands of people in communities across the country have been evacuated due to the wildfires. In Saskatchewan, the Canadian Red Cross reported it had assisted more than 17,000 people in the province from over 6,700 households to evacuate.\n\nThirteen communities in north-west Saskatchewan are under an evacuation order, several of which are First Nations, according to the province. One of the most affected areas of this year\u2019s wildfire season in the province is Denare Beach, a north-eastern village that was mostly destroyed in June due to a blaze.\n\nThe season has also now hit the east coast of Canada, as wildfires are currently raging across Newfoundland and Labrador and several towns are under evacuation orders.\n\nJohn Abatzoglou, a professor of complex systems management at the University of California, Merced, co-authored the June report from United Nations University.\n\nAbatzoglou said this year\u2019s fire season is the third year in a row Canada has seen fire activity that is well above average. The fires are also causing widespread smoke to cascade from the country into the United States as well, prompting severe air quality warnings in several states this month, is also an indication of how the fires are hurting populations beyond evacuations.\n\nIt\u2019s an international element of the fires that officials are having to contend with on a wider scale, Abatzoglou said.\n\n\u201cThis is a really key point that\u2019s different from other natural hazards and its ability to impact everything from quality of life to \u2026 human health and even mortality,\u201d he said.\n\nGovernments and public health will have to address how to change public behaviour and public policy to contend with \u201csmoke days\u201d, where you have to stay inside, he said.\n\n\u201cI know communities that may not have great infiltration systems \u2026 so more efforts there to provide resources to communities so that they can be safe indoors during acute smoke periods.\u201d",

  "summary": "The Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) has reported that the 2025 fire season is already the second-worst on record, with more than 470 fires currently classified as \"out of control\". This comes as climate change is blamed for prolonging and exacerbating the burning, leading to more destruction, evacuations and smoke-filled skies. Over 7,318,421 hectares of land in Canada have burned this year, a 78% increase from the five-year average of 4,114,516 hectares. The worst of the fires have been in the prairie provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, accounting for about 60% of the hectares burned so far this year in Canada. An analysis by the United Nations University in Shibuya, Japan, concluded that the fires are a \"stark manifestation\" of climate change and that warm, dry weather in the spring resulted in temperatures 2.5C above average. So far, tens of thousands of people have been evacuated due to the wildfires.",

      "text": "Billowing smoke from hundreds of out-of-control wildfires \u2013 most of which are in the Canadian Prairies \u2013 have caused severe air quality alerts across Canada and the United States.\nDetroit, Michigan, and the Canadian cities of Montreal and Toronto, recorded some of the worst air quality in the world on Monday, according to a ranking by IQAir, a Swiss air quality technology company.\nMore than 700 active wildfires are currently burning across Canada and about two-thirds of them are now out-of-control, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC), a non-profit organization that is owned by government agencies.\nOne brush fire, in British Columbia, was reportedly caused when an osprey dropped a fish on to a power line, sparking a small blaze which was later extinguished.\nBut most of the current fires that are causing the poor, smoggy air quality and reduced visibility are connected to warmer-than-average temperatures, drought conditions, decreased levels of snowpack and low soil moisture, according to Natural Resources Canada. All of those factors are driven by global heating, NRC says.\nSome others, including one discovered Thursday on the banks of Cameron Lake in British Columbia, were human-caused, according to officials.\nMonica Vaswani, a warning preparedness meteorologist with Environment Canada, said this year is shaping up to be a \u201cparticularly bad wildfire season\u201d.\n\u201cThis is not unlike what we\u2019ve been seeing in the last few years \u2026 unfortunately it\u2019s kind of becoming a little bit more the norm,\u201d she said.\nVulnerable populations, including elderly people, children and those with respiratory or heart issues have been advised to reduce time outdoors in Toronto and the surrounding municipalities. There is a risk for the general population as well and indoor activities are recommended, said Vaswani.\nSo far this year, 6,625,375 hectares of land in Canada have burned due to fires, which is about 140% higher than the same date in 2024 when 2,785,140 hectares were burned, according to the CIFFC.\nThe fires have also resulted in several evacuations across Canada in the last week. In northern Manitoba, a full evacuation order was issued for the Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation due to wildfires. More than 400 properties have been ordered to vacate as a result on the east coast of Vancouver Island \u2013 and the fire is 180km north-west of Victoria, British Columbia.\nThe Saskatchewan village of Pinehouse, located about 500km north of the city of Saskatoon, also was under an evacuation order this week. The largest fires in the country are now across the provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, with several larger than 100,000 hectares.\nThe smoke from those fires continues to drift down across the Canadian border with the United States. On Monday, air quality alerts were issued for Michigan, Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, parts of Nebraska and regions in Illinois and Indiana. People in the eastern states of New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine are also being advised by officials to limit outdoor activity due to the wildfires."

      "text": "Enormous early-season wildfires have erupted across the prairie provinces of Canada this week, taxing local emergency response and threatening a long stretch of dangerous air quality across eastern North America.\nThe country\u2019s largest fires \u2013 the Bird River fire and the Border fire \u2013 remain completely uncontained in northern Manitoba. In Manitoba alone, wildfires have burned about 200,000 hectares already this year \u2013 already about three times the recent full-year average for the province.\nMore than 17,000 people are in the process of being airlifted out of wildfire zones by the Canadian military, some of which now have no safe overland roads connecting them to the rest of the country. Wab Kinew, the Manitoba premier, declared a province-wide state of emergency on Wednesday, and Saskatchewan\u2019s premier, Scott Moe, declared the same on Thursday.\n\u201cThis is the largest evacuation Manitoba will have seen in most people\u2019s living memory,\u201d Kinew said at a press conference. \u201cFor the first time, it\u2019s not a fire in one region, we have fires in every region. That is a sign of a changing climate that we are going to have to adapt to.\u201d\nFirst Nations in Saskatchewan have been particularly affected by the fires this week, with some entire communities evacuated and occasionally trapped by road closures due to unsafe conditions. Drone footage circulated by CBC showed towering flames and burned homes and cabins in northern Saskatchewan on Wednesday. Wildfires are also burning in Alberta\u2019s oil country and have disrupted production and forced evacuations there this week.\nSatellite images captured over the past two weeks showed extreme fire behavior, including pyrocumulus clouds, that until recent years has been a rare occurrence in northern Canada \u2013 especially in the early days of the annual fire season. These clouds signify an especially hot and intense fire, and can help transport smoke high into the atmosphere where it can then travel long distances.\nIn advance of the wave of wildfire smoke, the US National Weather Service has issued air quality alerts for parts of Minnesota between Lake Superior and the Canadian border.\nWeather forecasts show smoke continuing to billow across the border into the United States over the coming days, which could notably worsen air quality further downstream in cities such as Chicago, Detroit and Washington DC. Air quality in the worst-affected cities across the midwest and mid-Atlantic regions could reach the \u201cred\u201d category, signifying an air quality index exceeding 150 and unhealthy conditions for all groups.\nA prolonged period of unusually warm and dry conditions helped to intensify this week\u2019s fires, continuing a trend worsened by climate change. The fire seasons of 2023 and 2024 were the worst two years in Canadian history. In June 2023, wildfire smoke transported southward from Canada turned skies orange over New York City, briefly making its air the most unhealthy of any city in the world.\nThe most recent assessments by Natural Resources Canada show that fire conditions are currently maxing out the scale across much of the regions where wildfires are now burning out of control. Government forecasters also predict that the fire seasons in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia will all continue to be \u201cwell above average\u201d for the remainder of the spring and summer.\nThe health effects of wildfire smoke is an increasingly urgent area of medical research. A study published this week found for the first time that exposure to the fine soot particles of wildfire smoke can have adverse effects on the heart and lungs for months after the smoke clears. Other recent studies have found that wildfire smoke worsens the risk of stroke, negatively impacts brain function, and can even interfere with fertility treatments.\nThe worrying truth emerging from these studies is that there appears to be no safe level of exposure to wildfire smoke, which can be up to 10 times more toxic than the soot and smog of typical urban air pollution. New data suggest that thousands of people now die each year from wildfire smoke in the US, creating billions of dollars of additional costs to the economy.\nExperts recommend wearing a fitted N95 or similar mask if you are exposed to wildfire smoke outdoors, and using a portable air filtration system if you are indoors."

      "text": "Canada\u2019s extraordinary year of wildfire finally appears to be slowing down, leaving behind a weighty legacy of charred northerly forests, acrid smoke and a huge pulse of carbon emissions that will have reverberations for the climate around the world.\nFire ravaged Canada in 2023 like no other year, by a stupendous margin. A record 45.7m acres (18.5m hectares) went up in flames, an area about twice the size of Portugal, shattering the previous annual record nearly three times over. From the spring onwards, more than 6,500 fires sprang up, unusually, across the whole country, tearing through Nova Scotia in the east to British Columbia in the west.\nThe fires were largely centered on Canada\u2019s vast boreal forests, a trove of habitat for creatures such as moose, bears and songbirds and a crucial carbon bank that blankets an area larger than India, representing about a quarter of the world\u2019s remaining intact forest.\nMost of the blazes were in remote areas \u2013 but there were two firefighter deaths in July and numerous evacuations, most memorably the 20,000 citizens of Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories, who had to flee their homes in August as multiple fires converged upon the city.\nFire has always been a feature of Canada\u2019s forests but experts say this year was not only a staggering departure from previous norms but also a grave omen of the sort of conditions that will be wreaked by the climate crisis, which is helping spur larger, fiercer wildfires through elevated temperatures and altered rainfall patterns.\n\u201cIt has been an exceptional, epic year,\u201d said Stephen Pyne, a fire historian at Arizona State University. \u201cWe are watching mythology become ecology \u2013 it\u2019s a slow-motion Ragnar\u00f6k. We\u2019ve had ice ages in the past but we are now living through what I call the \u2018pyrocene\u2019. Imagine an ice age but instead of ice as a forming feature, we have fire.\n\u201cThis is clearly a case of climate change adding energy to the system, magnifying the boom and bust of the boreal forest. We may be witnessing a change of state, a change in the character of this environment.\u201d\nAt least 100 of Canada\u2019s fires this year have been so fierce as to create their own weather via pyrocumulonimbus clouds, or \u201cfire storm clouds\u201d, which can stretch 200 miles (320km) wide and carry ash and other debris upward and unleash lightning that can trigger multiple other fires that immolate more trees.\nThe sheer intensity of some of these blazes means it is not clear whether the dominant fir and spruce trees in the boreal forest will come back as before \u2013 it may be a different, more flammable mixture of vegetation that regrows in their place.\n\u201cWe are seeing an environment adapted to ice being driven off to be replaced by one that is adapted to fire,\u201d said Pyne. \u201cIf you have these sort of fires, these sort of monsters, you start to see quite big changes.\u201d\nThe impact of the fires was also felt far beyond Canada\u2019s borders, causing plumes of smoke that turned New York City\u2019s skies a dystopian orange in June and as recently as last month caused hazy skies as far away as Florida. People in cities in eastern Canada and the north-east US were forced to put on masks discarded since the Covid pandemic amid some of the worst air quality in the world, as hospitalizations for conditions such as asthma spiked.\nThe impact upon the world\u2019s climate will be even more significant than this. According to data from the European Union\u2019s satellite monitoring service, more than 1.7bn tons of planet-heating gases have been released this year by the enormous fires \u2013 about three times the total emissions that Canada, a major fossil fuel-producing nation, itself produces each year.\nSuch huge emissions, eclipsing in a single year any measure, however ambitious, to cut pollution from cars or factories by a country like Canada, are a major drag upon efforts to stem the climate crisis. The majestic boreal forests, much like the Amazon rainforest that now emits as much carbon as it sucks up and is tipping towards becoming a savannah, suddenly appear to be a danger to the world\u2019s climate rather than a key safeguard.\n\u201cPeople used to see places burn on the news but now they are feeling it with smoke where they live,\u201d said Pyne. \u201cWho would\u2019ve cared about fires in northern Quebec before? But now it\u2019s suddenly smoky in major metropolitan areas and people have to care. It\u2019s all very real for them.\n\u201cThe forest isn\u2019t our friend any more,\u201d he added. \u201cThis was supposed to be a natural reservoir, our carbon bank, but now the bank isn\u2019t stable. There\u2019s a bank run. It is going to burn, as well as the peat below the ground that is also a huge store of carbon. It\u2019s potentially a carbon timebomb.\u201d\nFor Canada, the challenge of maintaining its huge forests in an age of rapid climate breakdown looms large. The country has about 10% of the world\u2019s forests and a third of this land has burned in the past 40 years. Even as temperatures plummet and snow starts to arrive over winter, many of the outbreaks will continue to smolder underground as \u201czombie\u201d fires, possibly then rearing up again next year.\nFire is now a near-constant. This year\u2019s extremes have severely taxed firefighters, pushed to the brink of exhaustion battling flames in areas that had to be protected while other, more remote, fires were left to burn, spewing out carbon.\n\u201cThis year has just been totally unprecedented,\u201d said M\u00e9lanie Morin, a spokeswoman for Sopfeu, a firefighting organization in Quebec, which smashed its record for the area burned in a year. The tone for Quebec\u2019s summer was set by a series of lightning strikes in June that set off dozens of fires that firefighters, some of them volunteers from as far as France and South Korea, struggled to contain.\n\u201cEveryone worked very hard this summer, everyone was tired with the consecutive shifts,\u201d Morin said. \u201cWe are starting to see the consequences of tiredness and the effect on people\u2019s mental states.\n\u201cThis was something new for eastern Canada. There is a kind of new consciousness that fires exist in this part of the country. People are more aware of it. Those images of the smoke in New York City were shocking but this is the cause and effect of an unprecedented amount of fire.\u201d"
