      "feedback": "The draft mostly nails the 4-mover structure (2 Up, 2 Down with time windows and cited facts), but it fails the Section FOCUS by not delivering the required Swing Trade/Outlook plan, overstuffing with nonessential narrative (Alts, Disney example, Beasley caps, etc.), and not tying probabilities to defensible, source-grounded triggers. Actionable edits: prune to a single, regime-driven framework anchored in first principles (Regime A: MSFT/SHOP cloud/AI moat; Regime B: Ford cash flow/income; Regime C: tariff/EV-infra shocks) and remove off‑topic material; keep the 4 movers as-is but force every line to a crisply stated, observable trigger (e.g., tariff news, AI capex momentum, IPO cadence) with a one-sentence “What to watch” that maps directly to those triggers and uses only source IDs you’ve cited. Immediately after the movers, add the Swing Trade/Outlook plan in the exact format: if tradable, 1–2 Swing Trade lines with Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence %; if not tradable, 1 Outlook line with Direction | Horizon | Expected path/levels | Decision signals | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence %. Ground every Probability % to explicit, material catalysts from the sources (0G3A676BP; W2622L6WW; 65UUBU0OR; Q7VVGNSQE; OB27SL8WU; 4; IG P1Q4ZEJ;  UVEQ2SJ0W; etc.), and avoid invented numbers; keep all numeric claims within the bounds of the cited data (e.g., Microsoft/Shopify cloud growth, Ford yield/margin, IPO cadence) and reconcile any conflicts by presenting a single base case (Regime A) with clearly labeled tail risks (Regime B/C). Eliminate the lengthy base-case narrative and the extraneous, non‑regime evidence (Disney, Beasley, UNH/LULU examples) unless you can thread them into a coherent, directly cited regime-triggered risk/return narrative. Ensure every factual claim has an in‑text ID and that the overall piece remains strictly within the 4 movers plus 1–2 swing/outlook lines, with no trailing citation list.",
