  "description": "Wowed by the 25-carat engagement ring Cristiano Ronaldo bought his longtime partner, Georgina Rodriguez? Shop similar diamond ring options here.",
  "content": "\u2022 Cristiano Ronaldo and Georgina Rodriguez are engaged after nine years of dating.\n\u2022 Rodriguez's engagement ring is estimated to be worth up to $5 million and features a large oval-cut diamond, possibly between 20-25 carats.\n\u2022 While some speculated the ring's image was AI-generated, a gemologist confirmed the design is realistic for high-profile clients.\n\nInternational soccer superstar Cristiano Ronaldo and longtime girlfriend Georgina Rodriguez are engaged! Nine years is a long time to wait for an engagement ring, but when it looks like Georgina's ring from Ronaldo, you can't be mad. That rock is unreal.\n\nIt looks so unreal, that even our USA Today Shopping team had questions about whether the Instagram announcement was AI-generated.\n\nLuckily, Lorraine Bratner, GIA-certified gemologist and Director of Sales and Service at James Allen, weighed in to help set the record straight.\n\n\"While many are quick to speculate that Cristiano Ronaldo's engagement ring may be AI-generated, I can say that the design details, particularly the carat weight, shape and setting, are entirely within the realm of what's possible in high-end jewelry today,\" Bratner said. \"As someone who\u2019s seen many large-carat diamonds up close, I can say that this style is absolutely in line with what high-profile clients and celebrities gravitate toward.\"\n\nThe diamond is reportedly valued at up to $5 million. He is, afterall, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nBratner weighed in on the look of the stone.\n\n\"Based on the images circulating, the center stone appears to be an oval cut diamond, likely ranging between 20-25 carats, possibly even more depending on finger size,\" says Bratner. \"In an era where AI can generate hyper-realistic renderings, skepticism is natural, but this ring's proportions, clarity, and craftsmanship reflect the kind of piece created for elite clients.\"\n\nBelow, check out a few dazzling lookalikes, albeit smaller than the absolute rock on Rodriguez's finger:\n\nSave up to 40% on jewelry during Blue Nile's Anniversary Sale\n\nBlue Nile is celebrating 26 years of craftsmanship by offering up to 40% off select jewelry styles and up to 25% off engagement ring settings during their Anniversary Sale. The sale kicked off on Tuesday, August 12 and runs until Monday, September 15. Here's a look at top styles to shop during the Blue Nile Anniversary Sale:",
