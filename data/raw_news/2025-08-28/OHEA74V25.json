  "title": "The states and the presidency: Trump is exceeding his authority",
  "description": "Trump has been on a campaign to use federal force to enhance public safety. Where is his constitutional authority to do so? In a word: NOWHERE.",
  "content": "\u201cIt is (my) intention to ... demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States created the Federal Government.\u201d \u2014 President Ronald Reagan, First Inaugural Address, Jan. 20, 1981\n\nWhen I heard President Ronald Reagan utter the words above, my heart leapt with joy. I couldn\u2019t imagine a modern-day president recognizing the sovereignty of the states and understanding their role in the creation of the American republic. If I had been the scrivener of that address, I\u2019d have added \u201cand the powers that the states gave away to the feds they can take back!\u201d\n\nOh, how the presidential attitude has changed.\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump purported to order the states to reform their policies on bail so as to incorporate a variant of pre-conviction incarceration. He also ordered them to prosecute people for burning their own flags. His own observations have apparently caused him to conclude that bad people \u2014 including flag burners \u2014 should be picked up off the streets, incarcerated and kept there until trial. In another breath, he referred to the states as \u201cagents\u201d of the federal government.\n\nTrump has been on a campaign to use federal force to enhance public safety. He may be right that many Americans would like to see him do this, but where is his constitutional authority to do so? In a word: NOWHERE.\n\nHere is the back story.\n\nThe drafters of the Constitution wove into its fabric the concept of subsidiarity. This means that problems for government to solve should be addressed by the government closest to the problem and the people affected by it. As well, government should employ the least assets needed, not the most available.\n\nThis is reflected in the Constitution by the reservation of powers to the states. When the first 13 states formed the federal government and when the succeeding 37 joined \u2014 some voluntarily and some literally with guns aimed at the heads of state officials \u2014 they did so embracing subsidiarity. Among the powers they knew they were not giving away to the federal government was the police power.\n\nJames Madison, the chief draftsman of the Constitution and the author of the Bill of Rights, insisted that the 10th Amendment declare that the powers not given away to the federal government are retained by the people and the states. Foremost among them is the police power \u2014 the power to regulate and enforce laws for the health, safety, welfare and morality of all persons in the states.\n\nThe federal government is one of limited powers. The Congress \u2014 unlike the British Parliament and American state legislatures \u2014 is not a general legislature. It cannot right any wrong or tax any event or insinuate the feds into any relationship or regulate any behavior it chooses. Congress may only legislate in the 16 discrete areas of governance articulated in Article I of the Constitution. And the president may only enforce the laws that Congress has enacted.\n\nTrump is probably correct that most major American cities are poorly managed, over taxed, unsafe and often unpleasant. But these problems are for the people in those cities and the legislatures of those states.\n\nMadison made it clear, just because a problem is national in its scope does not make it federal in its nature. A national problem is one common to vast areas across America. A federal problem is one the governance of which is articulated and delegated to Congress in the Constitution.\n\nIf national problems can be transubstantiated into federal problems just because they are ubiquitous, then the Constitution is meaningless.\n\nThis system was crafted to prevent the accumulation of power in Washington. It was also crafted, a la Reagan, so you can vote with your feet. If you don\u2019t like the taxes and regulations in Massachusetts, you can move to New Hampshire.\n\nCan the states criminalize burning your own flag, as Trump has demanded? They can ban dangerous fires, but only because of the smoke and flames not because of the ideas represented by the fuel. Justice Antonin Scalia \u2014 whom Trump has praised as his favorite Supreme Court justice and who voted with the majority in both Supreme Court cases invalidating flag burning statutes \u2014 opined that the flag stands for the idea that it may legally and constitutionally be destroyed; no matter who is offended thereby.\n\nIn my career as a trial judge in New Jersey, I set bail for a few thousand persons. At that time, judges had the discretion and obligation to address the presumption of innocence, the seriousness of the alleged crime, the nature of the evidence against the accused, and the history and community ties of the accused, and then make an informed judgment about bail. Bail is not a privilege; it is a right guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment.\n\nToday, a few state legislatures have removed judicial discretion in setting bail. State-mandated cashless bail \u2014 effectively pre-trial freedom with no posted bail \u2014 is demonstrably ruinous of justice and public safety, but it is a state issue and a national problem, not a federal one.\n\nWhen the feds offer funds to the states, there are always strings attached. But those strings, the Supreme Court has ruled, must be related to the purpose of the funds and attached when the funds are offered; they cannot be added unilaterally afterward. Can the president hold back funds from a state because he dislikes its bail laws \u2014 funds promised and premised on strings not mentioning bail? In a word: NO.\n\nChanneling Justice George Sutherland: If the provisions of the Constitution are not upheld when they pinch as well as when they comfort, they may as well be abandoned.\n\nAndrew P. Napolitano, a former New Jersey Superior Court Judge, has published nine books on the U.S. Constitution. To learn more, visit JudgeNap.com.",

      "text": "Public safety and the presidency: Is Trump's D.C. takeover constitutional? | Opinion\n4-minute read\nPresident Donald Trump argued last week that as a result of the federal enhancement of police work in Washington, D.C., the city has gone in four days from being the most dangerous in America to being the safest. He cited no evidence but relied apparently on his own observations and anecdotal references from friends. He opined that everyone wants him to keep their cities and towns safe.\nTrump couldn\u2019t resist taking credit for an increase in the number of arrests. These included such crimes as vagrancy, running away from federal agents and striking the bulletproof vest of a federal agent with a sandwich. It remains to be seen if arrests for quality-of-life crimes or non-crimes (vagrancy laws are unconstitutional, and running from federal agents is not a crime unless they have a lawful purpose to pursue you) can be translated into convictions and palpable safety.\nThomas Jefferson and James Madison understood that everyone wants to be safe, but they recognized that some prices are too high to pay for safety. Those prices include the loss of personal liberty, an expansion of already bloated presidential powers, the loss of local control of police and the violation of the constitutional principle of subsidiarity.\nHere is the backstory.\nDuring the colonial period of American history, there were no police. Towns and cities had jailers who mainly carried out orders from judges, which included jailing the guilty and occasionally executing them. Written laws were few. The common law followed the natural law. When enforcement was needed, a militia was assembled by a sheriff. The members of the militias were farmers and tradesmen.\nThe king\u2019s policies were enforced by his colonial governors and their troops and by British agents who could arrest anyone, as they all carried general warrants. General warrants were issued by a secret court in London, and they authorized the bearer to search wherever he wished and seize whatever and whomever he found.\nOne of Jefferson\u2019s bitterest complaints in the Declaration of Independence was the king\u2019s repeated violations of the doctrine of subsidiarity. Subsidiarity was crafted by the Romans, gained popularity after it was codified by St. Thomas Aquinas and generally adopted in the West.\nSubsidiarity teaches that when the government seeks to accomplish a task \u2014 be it the prosecution of a jaywalker or waging war against another country \u2014 because it is using force and assets given to it by the governed (no government produces wealth, thus everything government possesses it has taken), government must use the least force and fewest assets necessary, and this can only be done efficiently by the government closest to the problem at hand.\nMadison understood this when he crafted the Constitution. In it, he delineated precisely the powers of the new central government. Public safety \u2014 as desirable as that may be \u2014 is not among them. He also sought to compel subsidiarity. Thus, by omitting health, safety, welfare and morality as areas of governance delegated to the federal government, he reserved those areas to the states. And he crafted the 10th Amendment to codify those reservations.\nMadison was also cognizant of what his friend had written in the Declaration \u2014 namely that the king had arrested colonists in America and transported them to London for trial. Hence the provisions in the Constitution mandating that federal criminal trials take place in the judicial district in which the crime is alleged to have occurred.\nNow back to public safety and the American presidency.\nI have often argued that the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security are unconstitutional. They are not articulated or even hinted at in the Constitution, and their tasks \u2014 public safety \u2014 are reserved to the states. Until the presidencies of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the feds never cared to be involved in crime fighting. These were state concerns, and their needs were vastly different throughout the country.\nThen Wilson crafted the precursor to the FBI and persuaded Congress that since we now had a federal police force, they needed federal crimes to enforce. This was magnified greatly under FDR \u2014 and all living Americans have grown up with the concept of the FBI as enforcers of federal law.\nAfter it slept on 9/11, the George W. Bush administration, unhappy with one federal police department, created another \u2014 10 times the size of the FBI \u2014 and called it DHS. These are the folks who wear black shirts and masks when they arrest, often without arrest warrants.\nWhen President Trump decided to federalize the DC Metro Police Department for the 32 days permitted by the 1973 home rule statute, he attempted to supplant its lawful police chief with a federal bureaucrat, which a federal court stopped. Now, he is apparently trying to find ways to take over the police departments of New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles. Can he legally do so? In a word: NO.\nIn two landmark cases from the mid-1990s, U.S. v. Lopez and Printz v. U.S., the Supreme Court reaffirmed the sovereignty of the states and their primacy in matters of public safety. The Court made it clear that the feds cannot tell the states how to keep their streets safe or commandeer their assets or supplant them in matters of public safety. This is Madison\u2019s subsidiarity principle brought up to date.\nWhile the District of Columbia is actually owned by Congress, which gave the president his 32-day window to commandeer D.C. police to assist federal functions, since public safety is not a federal function, Trump\u2019s efforts to clean up the streets and arrest the folks he says are thugs and brawlers are without a constitutional basis.\nHuman freedom comes about by limiting government, not expanding it. And freedom prospers when established processes are followed. If the government can do as it wishes in the name of public safety, who will protect us from the government?\nAndrew P.
