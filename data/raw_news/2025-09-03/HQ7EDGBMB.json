  "content": "The board of C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) has announced that it will pay a dividend on the 2nd of October, with investors receiving $0.62 per share. This payment means the dividend yield will be 1.9%, which is below the average for the industry.\n\nWhile the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Investors will be pleased to see that C.H. Robinson Worldwide's stock price has increased by 34% in the last 3 months, which is good for shareholders and can also explain a decrease in the dividend yield.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nC.H. Robinson Worldwide's Future Dividend Projections Appear Well Covered By Earnings\n\nEven a low dividend yield can be attractive if it is sustained for years on end. Based on the last payment, C.H. Robinson Worldwide was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that quite a large proportion of earnings is being invested back into the business.\n\nLooking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 31.2% over the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 44% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.\n\nSee our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide\n\nThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.52 in 2015, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.48. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 5.0% over that duration. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.\n\nInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. C.H. Robinson Worldwide has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 5.6% per annum. Since earnings per share is growing at an acceptable rate, and the payout policy is balanced, we think the company is positioning itself well to grow earnings and dividends in the future.\n\nWe Really Like C.H. Robinson Worldwide's Dividend\n\nOverall, we think that this is a great income investment, and we think that maintaining the dividend this year may have been a conservative choice. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.",
