  "description": "The new FanDuel welcome offer gives users a shot at earning $300 in bonus bets.",
  "content": "Philadelphia Phillies' Kyle Schwarber hits a three-run home run during the eighth inning of a baseball game against the San Francisco Giants in San Francisco, Wednesday, July 9, 2025. AP Photo/Jeff Chiu\n\nYou don\u2019t need a FanDuel promo code to claim a new welcome offer from the nation\u2019s most popular sportsbook. If you bet $5 on any MLB game and win, FanDuel loads your account with $300 in bonus bets.\n\nContinue reading to learn more about one of the best NJ sportsbook promos.\n\nFanDuel promo code: How to claim a $300 bonus for MLB betting tonight\n\nYour initial $5 wager with FanDuel Sportsbook must win to receive the $300 bonus. This is a bit of a hurdle, but there are no odds limits on your bet, meaning you can back a market with extremely short odds for a better shot at victory.\n\nHere\u2019s how to sign up:\n\u2022 None Select your state and provide the necessary information; no promo code is required.\n\u2022 None Choose a payment method and deposit at least $5.\n\u2022 None Bet $5 on MLB or any other market available at FanDuel.\n\u2022 None Get $300 in bonuses if your bet settles as a winner.\n\nIf your qualifying wager wins, the $300 bonus arrives within 72 hours of bet settlement. Bonuses are non-withdrawable and expire seven days after receipt.\n\nThe $300 bonus can be split into any increment you prefer. For example, you could place three $100 bonus bets or 30 $10 bonus bets.\n\nRELATED: Review the latest 2025 World Series odds for the Phillies, Yankees and Mets.\n\nThe $300 bonus expires after a week, but you can always check the FanDuel app to find more top-notch existing user promos. These are a few of the offers you can claim today:\n\u2022 None Parlay Profit Boost: Place a 3+ leg parlay or same-game parlay and increase the potential winnings by 25%. This promo can be used on any sport.\n\u2022 None Refer-A-Friend: If a friend joins FanDuel using your unique referral link, you\u2019ll score two 100% profit boosts that double your payout.\n\nHow to use the FanDuel promo code for Phillies vs. Reds & Twins vs. Yankees\n\nBest bet: Will Warren to record 3+ strikeouts (-2000 odds at FanDuel)\n\nThere\u2019s no consolation prize if your initial $5 bet loses, so your main focus should be finding a wager with safe odds. The payout won\u2019t be much to brag about, but you can chase higher payouts after the $300 bonus is secured.\n\nMy best bet is Yankees\u2019 starter Will Warren to notch at least three strikeouts. The odds are -2000, and the implied probability is 95.24%.\n\nWarren averages roughly 5.5 strikeouts per game and has tallied 3+ strikeouts in 21 of 24 appearances this season. If he meets his average tonight against the Twins, you\u2019ll enjoy a $300 bonus.\n\nIf you\u2019re more interested in betting on Phillies vs. Reds, consider taking Philadelphia\u2019s alternate run total of 1.5 (-1100 odds) or Cincinnati starter Andrew Abbott to record 3+ strikeouts (-1600 odds).\n\nThose who aren\u2019t into sports betting can also get in on the action with FanDuel. No FanDuel Casino promo code is required to claim a beginner-friendly sign-up bonus.\n\nStart by registering a new account and submitting a deposit of $10 or more. Once the deposit processes, you\u2019ll receive 500 bonus spins and a $40 bonus. It\u2019s not the flashiest online casino welcome offer, but it serves as a great way to test FanDuel Casino\u2019s game catalog without risking real money.",

      "text": "It\u2019s the start of a new era for the New York Jets with Aaron Glenn leading his first training camp as head coach. It gets underway Saturday night at Lambeau Field when the Jets visit Green Bay. Sports bettors can add to the action by registering with today\u2019s bet365 bonus code NJCOM365 and claiming $150 in bonus bets guaranteed or a $1,000 first-bet safety net.\nNew Jets quarterback Justin Fields and the rest of the starters are expected to play at least a few snaps. It\u2019s a great time to sign up with bet365 Sportsbook and claim one of the best NJ sportsbook promos.\nbet365 bonus code NJCOM365 at a glance\n| bet365 bonus code | NJCOM365 |\n|---|---|\n| bet365 new user offer | Bet $5 and get $150 in bonus bets win or lose OR claim a $1,000 first-bet safety net. |\n| Min. deposit | $10 |\n| Bonus expiration | 7 days after receipt |\n| Wagering requirement | Bonus bets are non-withdrawable |\n| Last verified | Aug. 9, 2025 |\nbet365 bonus code NJCOM365: How to claim the offer\nNew users at bet365 have the option of two high-value sign-up promotions. Register using the bonus code NJCOM365 and choose between:\n- Bet $5, receive $150 in bonus bets\n- Get up to $1,000 back in bonus bets if your first wager loses\nThe $5 to win $150 bonus bet offer is a low-cost, beginner-friendly option to get your account started quickly. On the other hand, more experienced and serious bettors may prefer the extra security of the first bet safety net, especially for larger wagers.\nEither way, bet365 Sportsbook stands out by letting you choose for yourself. Here\u2019s how to claim your preferred offer:\n- Click on any bet365 bonus code link or banner featured on this page to head to the registration page.\n- Complete the sign-up form, including bonus code NJCOM365. The code will auto-fill if you use our registration link.\n- Add at least $10 to your account using your preferred deposit method.\n- Select between the two offers.\nBonus bets expire seven days after being added to your account. The bonus bet stake is not included in your payout, and bonus bets must be wagered at least once before they are eligible for withdrawal.\nbet365 Sportsbook existing user promos\nHere\u2019s a look at some of the promotions available for existing users right now:\n- MLB Up 5 Early Payout: When betting on the MLB, your wager will be graded as a winner if the team you backed takes a five-run lead at any point, even if it goes on to lose the game.\n- NFL Preseason 30% SGP Boost: Add a 30% profit boost to your NFL preseason same game parlay. SGPs must have at least three legs and odds of +100 or better before being boosted.\nHow to use bet365 bonus code NJCOM365 for NFL Preseason Week 1\nNew users can select between two offers when using bet365 bonus code NJCOM365. When betting on preseason football, I believe the value of the first bet insurance promotion diminishes due to the unpredictable nature of the preseason. Therefore, it makes more sense to choose the \u201cBet 5, Get 150 in bonus bets\u201d offer.\nThankfully, users do not need to win their qualifying wager to earn bonus bets. Those bonus bets are earned whether the first bet wins or loses, allowing you to take a chance and have fun with your first bet.\nGreen Bay coach Matt LaFleur and Jets coach Aaron Glenn said they plan to play starters in Saturday\u2019s NFL preseason opener, but neither was specific as to which starters would be given what kind of leash.\nAt the very least, expect to see starting quarterbacks Justin Fields and Jordan Love. With the NY Jets being the road team, they are 3-point underdogs with +140 moneyline odds.\nIf you\u2019re a Jets fan, there\u2019s nothing wrong with taking the +140 price and enjoying your Saturday night while rooting for your team. Either way, you\u2019ll soon be unlocking $150 worth of bonus bets at bet365.\nMore Sports Betting\n- Upgraded FanDuel promo code: Get a $300 bonus for Yankees, Phillies, more MLB betting\n- Upgraded FanDuel promo code: Claim $300 in bonuses with huge new offer for football season\n- Best NJ sportsbook promos for Jets vs. Packers, NFL preseason Week 1 | Over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket\n- New DraftKings promo: Get a $200 bonus + $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket for Jets vs. Packers\n- New DraftKings promo code for Giants vs. Bills and NFL preseason Week 1: Get your $200 in bonuses"

To secure this offer, you must create a subscription that auto-renews next season at the regular price.\nHow to use DraftKings bonus code for Jets vs. Packers for NFL preseason Week 1\nBest bet: Packers moneyline (-175 odds at DraftKings Sportsbook)\nThe oddsmakers favor Green Bay ahead of kickoff as the Packers are 3-point favorites with a -175 moneyline. The NFL preseason game will be hosted at Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin.\nTo best utilize this welcome bonus from DraftKings Sportsbook, remember that the $200 is already in your account. So, the best way to wager for this game is to bet as you normally would.\nI like the Packers moneyline. Green Bay has plenty of experience under center, with backups Malik Willis and Sean Clifford. They will likely see plenty of time with great depth throughout their offense. I expect them to pull off the victory at home.\nMore Sports Betting\n- Upgraded FanDuel promo code: Get a $300 bonus for Yankees, Phillies, more MLB betting\n- Upgraded FanDuel promo code: Claim $300 in bonuses with huge new offer for football season\n- bet365 bonus code NJCOM365: Claim $150 in bonus bets for Jets vs. Packers NFL Preseason\n- Best NJ sportsbook promos for Jets vs. Packers, NFL preseason Week 1 | Over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket\n- New DraftKings promo code for Giants vs. Bills and NFL preseason Week 1: Get your $200 in bonuses"

      "text": "FanDuel was among the first companies to launch a legal US online sportsbook after PASPA was removed in 2018.\nThe esteemed sportsbook has grown exponentially since its inception and will continue to do so as online sports betting becomes legal in more states.\nFor now, sports betting fans in 23 states have access to FanDuel Sportsbook. That includes some of the country\u2019s true sports hubs, such as Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey.\nIn this FanDuel Sportsbook review, I thoroughly examine what this platform has to offer. This includes information on its various bonuses, betting markets, banking options, and more.\nSee why FanDuel is widely considered one of the top NJ sportsbooks.\nPros and cons\n| Pros | Cons |\n|---|---|\n| User-friendly interface | No phone number for customer service |\n| Excellent live betting options | Somewhat limited promotions for existing users |\n| Secure banking transactions |\nBonuses and promotions\nFanDuel\u2019s bonuses are among the best in the industry. New and existing players have access to fantastic offers, all of which can be claimed in just a few minutes.\nThe FanDuel Sportsbook promo code (no promo code needed) offer allows players to earn $150 in bonus bets when their first bet wins. It\u2019s not necessarily the largest welcome bonus available to claim today, yet it\u2019s certainly one of the easiest to earn.\nHere are the steps to claim this bonus today:\n- Locate and click on any FanDuel banner with the words \u201cGet Bonus\u201d that are on this page. You will be redirected to FanDuel\u2019s homepage. No promo code is required, so you won\u2019t need to copy anything before leaving this page.\n- Register for a FanDuel account by clicking the \u201cJoin Now\u201d button and inputting required personal information.\n- Deposit at least $5 into the new account, using any approved banking option, to trigger the next step of the promotion.\n- Bet $5 on any FanDuel market, including football, basketball, baseball, hockey, soccer, rugby, and more.\n- If that initial, promotion-qualifying $5 wager wins, FanDuel will credit the account with $150 in bonus bets within 72 hours of settlement.\nThere are a variety of bonuses for existing players, too. Some of these bonuses include:\n- Profit boosts: Earn profit boosts for various sporting events taking place throughout the year.\n- Odds boosts: For specific bets during marquee events, FanDuel will roll out odds boosts.\n- Refer-a-friend bonus: FanDuel Sportsbook provides its players with $50 in bonus bets for each friend they refer.\n- No sweat bets: Get your stake back as a bonus bet if you lose a wager when FanDuel advertises a no-sweat bet promotion.\nFanDuel Sportsbook constantly updates its list of promotions. Many of these focus on specific seasons of major sports leagues (NFL, NBA, MLB).\nLike many other experts, I feel that FanDuel\u2019s promotions are some of the best provided by any US online sportsbook. They are always easy to claim and come with fair terms and conditions.\nAdditionally, the frequency in which these promotions are offered is appealing, as existing users can undoubtedly find some promo or bonus daily.\nUser experience and interface\nFanDuel\u2019s design and UX are widely considered to be among the best in the market. It has a sleek blue-and-white theme that looks fantastic using both a desktop computer and a smartphone.\nThe odds are categorized extremely efficiently, too. On a desktop, the list of sports odds can be found on the left side of the home screen. Using the FanDuel mobile app, sports odds are located horizontally near the top of the homepage. Click any of these sports to find sub-categories of individual sports leagues.\nI also love some of the unique features that FanDuel incorporates into its design. For example, on the homepage, players will find a list of Popular Same-Game Parlays that allow users to quickly create potentially lucrative parlays on upcoming sporting events.\nMobile bettors can access FanDuel Sportsbook using their phone\u2019s web browser and the dedicated mobile app. This app can be easily downloaded via the Apple Store and Google Play Store.\nBetting markets and options\nFanDuel Sportsbook\u2019s list of betting markets is extensive. As one would expect, it provides odds on all major US sports leagues, including the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and MLS. Members will also find odds on sports more popular internationally, such as cricket, Jai Alai, and rugby.\nThe full list of sports that FanDuel Sportsbook provides odds on includes:\n- Aussie Rules\n- Baseball\n- Basketball\n- Boxing\n- Cricket\n- Cycling\n- Darts\n- Football\n- Golf\n- Handball\n- Ice Hockey\n- Jai Alai\n- Lacrosse\n- MMA\n- Motorsport\n- Entertainment\n- Rugby League\n- Rugby Union\n- Snooker\n- Soccer\n- Table Tennis\n- Tennis\n- Volleyball\nI found that nearly every type of bet imaginable can be made at FanDuel Sportsbook. With a click of a button, players can make moneyline, totals, point spreads, and parlay bets.\nIt\u2019s also incredible to see how many different prop wagers are offered here. Some of the prop options for standard NBA games, for example, include the First Basket scorer, Total Rebounds, and individual Total Quarter Points.\nThe live wagering options at FanDuel are world-class. Members can access live odds on sports leagues around the world 24/7.\nWith FanDuel TV+, players can also watch a variety of live sporting events, unique sports coverage, and live horse racing.\nAnother fantastic feature here is the ability to claim early cash-outs on your wagers. If players appear to be winning their wagers, FanDuel offers its members the option to claim winnings before the bet has even been settled.\nI cannot recall an online sportsbook that provides as many unique wagering options as FanDuel Sportsbook. There is no doubt this is a key reason why this platform is one of the most popular betting platforms in the country.\nBanking options at FanDuel Sportsbook\nThe banking system set in place at FanDuel Sportsbook is superb. Players have access to a great selection of ways to make deposits and withdrawals.\nDeposit options\nDepositing at FanDuel is simple. Members have access to 11 deposit options, each with instant processing times and zero fees.\nHere are the current deposit options available:\n- Online banking via Trustly\n- Debit Cards: Visa, MasterCard\n- Apple Pay\n- Venmo\n- PayPal\n- Credit Cards: Visa, MasterCard\n- Cash at Counter\n- PayNearMe\n- Wire Transfer\n- FanDuel Prepaid Play+ Card\n- Gift Card\nWithdrawal options\nMaking withdrawals at FanDuel is also simple. Payouts are processed very quickly and have zero fees.\nThe current withdrawal options at FanDuel Sportsbook include:\n- Online banking with Trustly - 3 to 5 business days\n- Debit Cards: Visa, MasterCard - Up to 24 hours\n- Venmo - Up to 24 hours\n- PayPal - Up to 24 hours\n- FanDuel Prepaid Play+ Card - Up to 24 hours\n- Check - 7 to 10 business days\n- Cash at Counter - 1 hour to 48 hours\nFanDuel takes its security extremely seriously. This platform has taken several steps to ensure that its players\u2019 privacy and funds are always protected.\nThe FanDuel Sportsbook platform is completely SSL encrypted. It also offers two-factor authentication for players to better protect their accounts.\nVarious other security measures are set in place, including KYC verifications, fraud monitoring, and ensuring that all government regulations are being followed.\nFanDuel Sportsbook customer support\nPlayers at FanDuel Sportsbook are given access to several forms of customer support. This includes:\n- Live chat\n- Email support\n- Social media support (X and Facebook)\n- FAQ page\nUnfortunately, FanDuel Sportsbook does not currently provide phone line support.\nHowever, I did not find this to be a major disadvantage, as the live chat feature allows players to speak directly with company representatives.\nThe support system that is set in place works well. I tested the live chat system and found it to be helpful. Before being connected with a human agent, members will need to explain their questions to an AI chatbot. Once the AI system has a better idea of your issue, it will connect you with the best possible agent.\nEmail support is said to take between 1-2 days for replies. Some players have claimed to receive a response in just a few hours. Others have stated that it took several days to receive a response.\nThis likely depends on how busy FanDuel is and what exactly your question is about.\nThe majority of members have praised the support system at FanDuel Sportsbook. Some, however, have understandably complained about the lack of phone support.\nFanDuel tends to listen to its users, and it\u2019s reasonable to assume that phone line support will become available in the future.\nLegal and regulatory compliance\nThe US sports betting industry is closely monitored. For online sportsbooks to operate legally, they must undergo a detailed process to ensure they abide by all legal state and federal regulations.\nFanDuel is one of the industry\u2019s biggest and most established online gambling brands. It should come as no surprise that this online sportsbook holds valid gaming licenses in each of the states in which it operates.\nResponsible gambling measures\nAnother key component of legal online sportsbooks is providing players with a variety of responsible gaming measures. Some of the responsible gambling measures set in place include:\n- Self-limiting services: FanDuel Sportsbook makes it easy for all members to set limits on their deposits, wagering amounts, and playing time. This tool helps bettors better regulate their gambling activities.\n- My Spend feature: Not long ago, FanDuel Sportsbook launched a \u201cMy Spend\u201d feature. This state-of-the-art tool allows players to track exactly how much they are wagering over time. It can help players better manage their budgets and set clear limits in the future.\n- Self-Exclusion: Players can also choose to completely self-exclude from betting. Anyone who feels that their betting habit is getting out of control can activate this feature and remove themselves from the FanDuel betting market completely.\n- Betting education: FanDuel Sportsbook also provides various educational information on sports betting and its potential drawbacks. This includes hotlines and contact information for services that can help players with sports betting addiction issues.\nConclusion\nFanDuel Sportsbook certainly deserves its status as one of the country\u2019s best, most respected online sportsbooks. It does nearly everything right, with a world-class design, a massive selection of betting markets, and a comprehensive banking system that caters to almost everyone.\nI am truly impressed with the sheer variety of betting markets. Few other online sportsbooks offer as many bet types as FanDuel. I also love some of the more unique features available, such as the ability to create same-game parlays and claim early winnings on wagers that have not been settled.\nFanDuel\u2019s design is also worth highlighting. Perhaps no other online sportsbook has as smooth and user-friendly a design as this platform. Navigating the betting platform is simple, using all types of devices, and customer support is always available to ensure players can find help when they need it.\nWith that being said, FanDuel could improve its support by offering a phone line system. Not everyone has the time to sit on their devices and respond to messages. Giving players phone support could certainly be beneficial to help certain players.\nOverall, FanDuel is one of the country\u2019s best online sportsbooks. It\u2019s constantly evolving, too, meaning players will likely gain access to new and exciting features over the next few years."

      "text": "Bonus bets and an NFL Sunday Ticket discount can be grabbed with the best NJ sportsbook promos, which can be claimed ahead of Jets vs. Packers on Saturday.\nWeek 1 of the NFL preseason is here, and the New York Jets will open their slate against the Green Bay Packers. Right now, first-time bettors have the opportunity to take advantage of some new-user offers.\nBest NJ sportsbook promos for Jets vs. Packers\nBelow, I am going to reveal the best New Jersey sportsbook promos for Jets vs. Packers and the full NFL preseason Week 1 schedule:\nDraftKings promo code: Bet $5, get $200 + over $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket\nThe new DraftKings promo code is easily the best sportsbook promo on the market at the moment. This is because signees can register, deposit $5 or more, bet that same amount and instantly receive the following rewards:\n- $150 in bonus bets credited as eight (8) $25 bonus bet tokens\n- Over $200 off of your NFL Sunday Ticket purchase\nThe $150 in bonus bets are available for seven days before they expire, and they cannot be withdrawn. The NFL Sunday Ticket discount, meanwhile, will come in the form of a promo code that\u2019ll be sent to your email.\nIf you haven\u2019t bought an NFL Sunday Ticket subscription for the 2025-26 season, you can use this code to get the product for just $176/year, instead of the standard $378 yearly price.\nbet365 promo code NJCOM365: Bet $5, get $150 win or lose\nRegistering with bet365 promo code NJCOM365 will grant you access to our exclusive offer. This new-user promo dishes out $150 in bonus bets to new users who bet just $5 or more. Win or lose, you get the bonus bets.\nYou need to manually claim this offer within 30 days of registering for your new account. Then, a $10 minimum deposit is required within the following seven days. Your $5+ real-money wager, notably, must settle within 30 days from the date on which you claimed the offer.\nYou will receive $150 in bonus bets with the placement of this wager. These bonus bets will be available for seven days before they expire.\nFanDuel promo code: Bet $5, get $150 if you win\nYou probably noticed that the FanDuel promo code is very similar to the one available at bet365, but there\u2019s a caveat with this offer. Your qualifying $5+ wager needs to win in order for you to earn $150 in bonus bets.\nIf your initial wager settles as a loss, you will not receive any bonus from this offer, which is disappointing. Know that your qualifying wager can have any odds, so I recommend placing a bet on a heavy favorite to give yourself the best chances.\nIf received, you will have seven days to use your $150 in bonus bets. Like all of the best NJ sportsbook promos on this page, your bonus bets from FanDuel are non-withdrawable.\nBetMGM bonus code NJCOM1500: Bet $10, get $150 if you win\nIf you register using BetMGM bonus code NJCOM1500, you can participate in the sportsbook\u2019s welcome offer, which dishes out $150 in bonus bets to those who win their first $10+ wager.\nThis offer is eerily similar to the one offered by FanDuel, but BetMGM requires an initial deposit and a coinciding wager of $10 or more instead of $5. Again, your qualifying wager just needs to be at standard odds, with no minimum odds requirement.\nI recommend placing your qualifying $10+ wager on a heavy betting favorite to have a good shot at earning the $150 in bonus bets.\nMore Sports Betting\n- Upgraded FanDuel promo code: Get a $300 bonus for Yankees, Phillies, more MLB betting\n- Upgraded FanDuel promo code: Claim $300 in bonuses with huge new offer for football season\n- bet365 bonus code NJCOM365: Claim $150 in bonus bets for Jets vs. Packers NFL Preseason\n- New DraftKings promo: Get a $200 bonus + $200 off NFL Sunday Ticket for Jets vs. Packers\n- New DraftKings promo code for Giants vs. Bills and NFL preseason Week 1: Get your $200 in bonuses"

Let\u2019s take a closer look at the specifics.\nFanDuel Casino promo code: How to claim $40 casino bonus and 500 spins\nFanDuel Casino is giving new users a chance to get a $40 casino bonus and 500 bonus spins.

The FanDuel Casino new user promo via Mohegan Sun is a 100% deposit match up to $500.\nTo claim this offer, deposit at least $10 within seven days of registering. You\u2019ll get your deposit match 72 business hours after you deposit of at least $10.\nThe best part of this deal is there is only a 1x wagering requirement, which means you can withdraw winnings after you wager the bonus just one time. The casino credits have no cash value and expire in seven days.\nFanDuel Casino new user promo\n500 bonus spins to play on Huff N\u2019 Even More Puff\nNew users (if you have a FanDuel Casino or FanDuel Sportsbook account you won\u2019t qualify for this promo) can get 500 bonus spins when they open an account and deposit at least $10.\nHere\u2019s how it works:\n- Bonus spins will be added in increments of 50 every day of your first 10 days\n- Bonus spins can be played only on Huff N\u2019 Even More Puff\n- There is a 1x playthrough on all bonus spins\n- Bonus spins expire in seven days\nFanDuel Casino existing user promos\nFanDuel Daily Jackpot Slots\nFanDuel Casino features Daily Jackpots on a rotating list of slot games, with at least one guaranteed winner every day by 11 p.m. ET. Participating titles include Vault Cracker, Joe Exotic, Doggy Riches Megaways, 777 Strike and a dozen other games, with more added weekly. Be sure to check the promotions page for the most-recent list.\nEach spin on a qualifying slot contributes a small percentage to the jackpot. The total prize pool grows throughout the day and can be triggered at random, regardless of the size of your stake (though higher bets increase your odds).\nOnce the jackpot hits, it resets and starts building again for the next day. You don\u2019t need to activate anything. Just log in and start spinning any eligible game to participate.\nRefer a Friend\nInvite your friends to join FanDuel Casino and earn a $175 casino bonus when they sign up, deposit and wager $10 or more within 30 days.\nTo get started, share your exclusive referral link found under the Earn $$$ icon on the mobile app homepage. Once your friend completes the steps, you\u2019ll receive your bonus, and they\u2019ll enjoy a $25 casino bonus, 500 bonus spins (distributed as 50 per day for 10 days) and up to $1,000 back on any net losses from their first day of play.\nPlease note, the $175 casino bonus may take up to 72 hours to be issued after your friend\u2019s qualifying wager. All casino bonuses are non-withdrawable and must be used within 14 days of being received.\nReward Machine\nFanDuel Casino\u2019s Reward Machine is basically a free shot at daily wins, and all you have to do is show up. Once you sign up and log into the app, you\u2019ll get three free spins daily, with chances to match symbols for instant prizes, stack symbols throughout the week for extra rewards or hit the jackpot by collecting three trophies. That jackpot? Could be worth up to $3,000 in casino bonus.\nAnd just when you thought it couldn\u2019t get better, FanDuel added a Bonus Draw. Every spin you play during the week earns you a ticket for Sunday night\u2019s draw, where you could win up to $1,000 in extra casino bonus.\nSpins reset daily at 6 p.m. ET and expire in 24 hours, so don\u2019t sleep on your freebies. Whether you\u2019re chasing spins, stacking symbols or eyeing the Mega Jackpot, Reward Machine keeps the wins coming all week long.\nHot Seat Challenge\nTake your shot at a share of $500,000 in FanDuel\u2019s Hot Seat Challenge, running through Aug. 24. Opt in and wager at least $25 per day on select table games such as blackjack and roulette, to earn entries.\nFanDuel Casino promo vs. the competition\nThe FanDuel Casino promo code (no actual FanDuel Casino promo code is needed) stacks up well against most other online casino bonuses for a few reasons. First, the minimum deposit of $10 is in line with that offered by the Caesars Palace Casino promo code NJCOM2500 or the BetMGM bonus code NJCOM, which are $10.\nSure, the bonus is lower than Caesars (100% deposit match up to $2,500) and BetMGM (100% deposit match up to $1,000). However, it has a lower entry point ($10) and a very low playthrough requirement.\nConversely, the wagering requirement at BetMGM Casino and Caesars Palace Online Casino is 15x, which is more aligned with the rest of the online casino industry. Take a look below at the specifics of each of the new user promos offered by the best online gambling sites:\n| \ud83c\udf81 FanDuel Casino promo code (N/A) | \ud83c\udf81 DraftKings Casino promo code (N/A) | \ud83c\udf81 BetMGM Casino bonus code NJCOM | \ud83c\udf81 Caesars Palace Online Casino promo code NJCOM2500 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| \ud83d\udcb0 Deposit $10, get 500 bonus spins + $40 in casino bonus | \ud83d\udcb0Play $5, get 500 spins and up to $1,000 back in casino bonus | \ud83d\udcb0100% deposit match up to $1,000 + $25 no deposit bonus | \ud83d\udcb0 100% deposit match up to $2,500 + 2,500 Reward Credits |\n| \ud83d\udcb8 Min.

I have access to two online casinos: FanDuel and DraftKings.\n*FanDuel Casino isn\u2019t available in these states because they\u2019re monopolies.\nUser experience\nFanDuel Casino doesn\u2019t have the biggest library compared to online casinos like Caesars Palace Online Casino or BetMGM Casino, but it has perfected the mobile experience and gives you a world-class online casino experience overall.\nThe top navigation bar has a search box that you can\u2019t miss, and all you need to do is swipe left or right to find the game type you\u2019re looking for. The loading times are lighting quick, and so is the depositing process.\nI noticed a little glitch when I tried to open Roulette from the home screen, but I\u2019ve been playing at FanDuel Casino for four years and that is the first time I\u2019ve had an issue, so I\u2019ll let that slide.\nSimilar to the FanDuel Sportsbook, payout times at FanDuel Casino are also extremely fast. It says it takes three-five business days, but I\u2019ve often received my winnings into my bank account within 24 hours.\nOf course, you might have a different opinion about FanDuel Casino depending on what you\u2019re looking for. If you\u2019re a slots lover, you\u2019re better off playing at Caesars Palace Online Casino (FanDuel only has roughly 300 slots available).\nBut I have to say, honestly, at what point are there too many slot options? I was not disappointed with FanDuel\u2019s slots offerings. They were sufficient.\nLive dealer experience\nNow, if looking for table games and a great live dealer experience, FanDuel Casino is the place to play. I\u2019m a big Three-Card Poker player, and I loved the FanDuel Casino live dealer experience, powered by Evolution Gaming.\nThe video quality is outstanding, and most dealers are personable and interact with you more than the dealers at brick-and-mortar casinos. In fact, if you\u2019re like me, you likely will prefer the live dealers at FanDuel Casino to the land-based casino dealers, most of whom are what I like to call \u201csticks in the mud.\u201d The live dealer options include:\n- Blackjack\n- Roulette\n- Buffalo Blitz Live\n- Baccarat\n- Crazy Coin Flip\n- Craps\n- Three-Card Poker\n- Ultimate Texas Hold \u2018em\n- Super Sic Bo\n- Lightning Dice\nThe live dealer craps experience was a bit disjointed when I played, but that\u2019s to be expected. Some games are just better to play in person, and craps is one of those games. It\u2019s the life of the casino due to its social nature.\nThink about it the next time you\u2019re out and roaming the casino floor: the loudest roars are coming from the craps table because someone is on a heater. Some things even the best online casinos can\u2019t replicate, and that\u2019s OK.\nFanDuel\u2019s live dealer casino is advertised as available 24/7, which is partially true. However, certain games aren\u2019t available all the time.\nExclusive games\nThe other thing to like about FanDuel Casino is exclusive slot games, such as the new Willy Wonka Cash Falls Add \u2018Em Up.\nWilly Wonka Cash Falls Add \u2018Em Up is a candy-themed slot exclusive to FanDuel Casino and packed with sweet features.\nAdd \u2018Em Up Candies collect the values of all other candies on their reel, while landing three, four or five Golden Egg bonus symbols awards 1x your total bet and triggers free games. Players also can collect Jackpot Candies for a chance at various jackpot prizes. It\u2019s a colorful, whimsical slot with fun ways to win big.\nSome of the best FanDuel exclusives currently on the menu:\n- FanDuel Stars and Stripes Blackjack\n- Wolf Strike Hold N\u2019 Win Extra\n- Vegas Matt Blackjack\n- Baseball Blackjack\n- FlyX Party\n- Fu Shen Zhu Fu\n- Samurai 888 Spin Sakura\n- FanDuel Golf Blackjack\nBest new games at FanDuel for August 2025\nFanDuel Baseball Blackjack\nFanDuel Baseball Blackjack is a classic game of blackjack with a fun, baseball-themed makeover. The draw is all in the presentation: the game is skinned with baseball visuals, stadium vibes and custom animations, making it feel like blackjack stepped onto the diamond.\nFanDuel Baseball Blackjack supports a wide range of bets (from $0.10 to $10,000 per hand), so it works whether you\u2019re a casual player or a high roller. The return to player (RTP) rate is around 99.5%, assuming you\u2019re playing with basic strategy, which puts it right up there with the best blackjack variants in terms of payout potential.\nHypercharged Pyramids of Ra\nFanDuel\u2019s top new slot for August is Hypercharged Pyramids of Ra from Light & Wonder \u2013 a jackpot-chasing, feature-packed adventure set in the heart of ancient Egypt.\nWith 40 paylines and bets ranging from $0.20 to $100, this five-reel game delivers classic Egyptian-themed visuals alongside high-energy bonus mechanics.\nThe highlight is the Hypercharged Hold & Spin and Super Hypercharged Hold & Spin features, in which landing six or more Pyramid symbols unlocks a bonus round with cash prizes, modifiers and the chance to hit fixed jackpots.\nUse a $2-plus bet to activate the game\u2019s Grand Jackpot, which starts at $10,000.\nWhile the base game leans on familiar symbols such as Cleopatra, Horus and Bastet, the slot\u2019s real appeal is in its dynamic bonus rounds.\nFree Spins and stacked wilds (reels two\u2013five) add extra win potential. Landing a pyramid in the center position during bonus play can instantly award the Grand Jackpot.\nDespite average graphics, the layered jackpot features and fast-paced gameplay make Hypercharged Pyramids of Ra one of the most engaging new titles on FanDuel this month.\nWhere our experts think FanDuel Casino can improve\nFanDuel Casino has a lot going for it, but there are a few areas where our experts think it could level up:\n- Smaller slot library compared to competitors (about 300 slots vs. 1,000+ at Caesars Palace Online Casino).\n- Live dealer streams can feel inconsistent depending on the dealer; less interactive than at DraftKings.\n- Not ideal for high rollers, with fewer high-stakes games and minimal VIP-focused perks.\n- Rewards program only targets big spenders, leaving everyday players without much incentive.\n- Limited game variety overall, with fewer niche table games and exclusive titles.\nFanDuel Casino deposit and withdrawal options\nDeposits\nDepositing with FanDuel Casino is extremely quick and easy. The first thing you need to know is your account information is tightly protected. When you sign up, you\u2019ll be prompted to confirm your bank account (or other financial institution) via a two-factor authentication text.\nHere\u2019s a look at the accepted payment forms at FanDuel Casino:\n| Deposit method | More information |\n|---|---|\n| Online banking (ACH) | Fast and secure via linked account |\n| PayPal | Must deposit with PayPal to withdraw with it |\n| Debit/Credit Card | Visa, AmEx, Discover accepted outside CT |\n| Venmo | Only available if also used for deposit |\n| Apple Pay | Deposit only, not supported for cashouts |\n| FanDuel Prepaid+ Card | Must enroll first; works for deposits and withdrawals |\n| Wire transfer | May have higher limits; longer processing time |\n| Cash at the counter | Available at select retail locations |\nFanDuel\u2019s depositing options are sufficient and don\u2019t differ from other online casinos much, aside from in CT where Venmo and PayPal aren\u2019t offered, and where credit cards are banned. One other thing to know is you can only withdraw with Venmo and PayPal if you deposited via one of those two methods.\nWithdrawals\nAnyone who has used FanDuel Sportsbook knows that FanDuel\u2019s biggest selling point is its lightning quick payouts. Unsurprisingly, FanDuel Casino is also one of the fastest payout casinos.\nAs I mentioned earlier, FanDuel\u2019s site says online banking withdrawals are processed within three-to-five business days, but I\u2019ve almost always received my winnings within 24 hours.\nHere\u2019s a quick look at each withdrawal method and how long it typically takes:\n| Withdrawal method | How long it takes |\n|---|---|\n| Online banking (ACH) | 3-5 business days (usually faster) |\n| PayPal | Up to 24 hours |\n| Venmo | Up to 24 hours |\n| Debit card | Up to 24 hours |\n| FanDuel Prepaid+ Card | Up to 24 hours |\n| Cash at casino counter | Within 1 hour (may take up to 48 hrs for larger payouts) |\n| Check by mail | 7\u201310 business days |\nHeads-up: First-time withdrawals may take up to 48 hours for a review, so don\u2019t panic if your initial cash out takes a little longer.\nFanDuel Casino customer service\n- Live Chat: Daily from 8 a.m.-midnight EST\n- Email: Support@fanduel.com (response in 12-24 hours)\n- Social: @FanDuel_Support (on X) | Facebook.com/Fanduel/\nFanDuel Casino customer service offers a live chat function, which I prefer and isn\u2019t something to be taken for granted. DraftKings, for instance, doesn\u2019t have live chat and tells you someone will get back to you via email within four hours (it has been hit or miss for me).\nFanDuel live chat is available daily from 8 a.m.-midnight EST. There also is email support, which FanDuel says will take 12-24 hours for a response (I found it to be on the quicker side of that timeframe). The other option is you can DM @FanDuel_Support on X (formerly Twitter) or message on Facebook.\nTo start the live chat, you\u2019ll enter your name and email address, plus the product you have questions about. You\u2019ll then reach a chat bot, who will have automated answers, or you can ask for an agent. I prefer an agent.\nOnce you ask for an agent, you\u2019ll be sent an email confirmation number that you\u2019ll need to relay before you can continue. The agent quickly entered the chat and answered my question about payment options immediately, letting me know that Apple Pay and Venmo are available in NJ, MI, PA and WV and not in CT.\nThis was a much smoother process than when I tried the Caesars Palace Online Casino live chat, which resulted in frustrating interaction with a chat bot. Caesars Palace Online Casino also doesn\u2019t offer email support.\nIs FanDuel Casino legit?\nYes, FanDuel Casino is 100% legit. It\u2019s licensed and regulated by gaming control boards in each state where it operates, such as NJ, PA, MI and WV. These licenses aren\u2019t handed out easily. FanDuel has to pass strict reviews of its security, identity verification (KYC) and banking protocols.\nThat is why you\u2019re asked to upload a valid ID, enable location tracking and verify your bank account with two-factor authentication. Even logins are protected with a six-digit code sent via text.\nThis is done by eCogra, which certifies that all slots and table games have a valid random number generator (RNG). Essentially, RNGs make sure that online casino games have enough randomness to ensure they payout fairly.\nWhere is FanDuel Casino Legal?\nFanDuel Casino is legal for players age 21+ in the following states and jurisdictions:\n- Connecticut (Mohegan Sun)\n- Michigan\n- New Jersey\n- Ontario\n- Pennsylvania\n- West Virginia\nFanDuel Casino responsible gaming\nFanDuel Casino supports responsible gambling with a dedicated page that offers tips and tools, as well as 24/7 support.\nAmong the responsible gaming tools at FanDuel Casino:\n| Tool | Description |\n|---|---|\n| Deposit limits | Lets you cap how much money you can deposit daily, weekly or monthly. |\n| Wager limits | Sets a ceiling on how much you\u2019re allowed to bet over a set time period. |\n| Maximum wager size | Restricts the amount you can wager on a single bet or spin. |\n| Time limits | Controls how long you can stay logged in or play each day. |\n| Timeouts | Temporarily pauses your account for a short break \u2013 typically 72 hours or less. |\n| Self-exclusion | Blocks access to your account for an extended period (months or even years). |\nThe page also tells users they can reach out via FanDuel.com/playwell or via their customer support team.

      "text": "The locals may have loaded up at the 2025 MLB trade deadline, but the reigning-champion Los Angeles Dodgers are still the favorite to repeat as World Series champions at DraftKings.\nBut even though the Mets and Yankees have fallen off substantially, the Phillies are still hot on LA\u2019s heels as the dog days of summer are running out.\nAt +550 Philadelphia has the second-shortest World Series odds behind LA, which is +350 ($100 bet returns $350 in profit)\nIt\u2018s no surprise Los Angeles is the favorite yet again. Aside from a loaded roster -- that was bolstered even further during the offseason -- the Dodgers started hot and lead the National League West.\nBut the Dodgers have cooled off, and between that and the Phillies\u2019 upgrades, the NL is very much up for grabs.\nHere\u2019s the top five World Series favorites at DraftKings as of Aug. 11:\n- Los Angeles Dodgers: +350\n- Philadelphia Phillies: +550\n- Seattle Mariners +800\n- Houston Astros +900\n- Milwaukee Brewers +900\nThe Mets and Yankees were in the top-5, but their World Series odds have lengthened substantially via DraftKings Sportsbook. Both teams have hit the skids of late and no longer lead its respective division.\nUpdated 2025 World Series odds\n*all odds courtesy of DraftKings as of 8/11/2025\n- Los Angeles Dodgers: +350\n- Philadelphia Phillies: +550\n- Seattle Mariners +800\n- Houston Astros: +900\n- Milwaukee Brewers: +900\n- Detroit Tigers +950\n- Toronto Blue Jays: +1000\n- New York Yankees: +1100\n- San Diego Padres: +1200\n- Chicago Cubs: +1400\n- New York Mets: +1400\n- Boston Red Sox: +2200\n- Texas Rangers: +6000\n- Cleveland Guardians: +10000\n- Cincinnati Reds: +12000\n- San Francisco Giants +15000\n- Kansas City Royals: +20000\n- St. Louis Cardinals: +20000\n- Tampa Bay Rays: +35000\n- Arizona Diamondbacks: +80000\n- Los Angeles Angels: +80000\n- Minnesota Twins: +80000\n- Athletics: +100000\n- Atlanta Braves +100000\n- Baltimore Orioles: +10000\n- Chicago White Sox: +100000\n- Colorado Rockies: +100000\n- Miami Marlins: +100000\n- Pittsburgh Pirates: +100000\n- Washington Nationals +100000\nTop World Series odds favorites on betting apps\nLos Angeles Dodgers (+350)\nThe Dodgers are the clear favorites, since they have overcome a whole season\u2019s worth of turmoil and injuries yet still sit atop the NL West ahead of the rival Padres.\nBut LA has looked much less invincible over the past month, and it did not load up at the trade deadline, which is surprising given its bullpen struggles.\nStill, Shohei Ohtani is again an MVP favorite for his bat, but also building back to becoming the Dodgers\u2019 ace on the mound. Tyler Glasnow is back, and Blake Snell is close to returning from an early-season shoulder injury.\nPlus, Yoshinobu Yamamoto has been a staff ace in their absences. There truly is no weakness to this roster, though between the bullpen and Mookie Betts\u2019 oddly awful year, the Dodgers may be susceptible in a short series.\nStill, FanGraphs gives the Dodgers a 19.7% chance to win the World Series \u2014 but it\u2019s the first time their odds of winning it all have dipped below 20 percent all year.\nThat is lower than the 22.2% implied probability DraftKings is offering. If the Dodgers turn things around, those odds will dip substantially.\nPhiladelphia Phillies (+550)\nThe Phillies, two seasons removed from the World Series, are looking dangerous after the moves Dave Dombrowski made at the deadline.\nPhilly added to its scuffling bullpen by acquiring hard-throwing righty Jhoan Duran from the Twins and adding veteran bullpen mainstay David Robertson.\nBetween those two, and Jose Alvarado\u2019s return from PED suspension, the Phils bullpen is much improved \u2014 even if Alvarado will not be eligible to pitch in the playoffs.\nPhiladelphia\u2019s starting pitching has been phenomenal, keyed by ace Zack Wheeler, who is having another Cy Young-caliber year. Plus, Ranger Suarez and Cristopher Sanchez have each also been dominant, with sub-3 ERAs.\nPhiladelphia is likely to go as far as its pitching will take it, since its lineup can score runs with any team in baseball \u2014 keyed by All-Star Game MVP Kyle Schwarber.\nHow World Series betting odds work\nWorld Series odds are futures bets, which means you can make them at any point either before or after the season has started. The odds are going to fluctuate based on what each team is doing on the field.\nFor instance, last season the Yankees odds to win the 2024 World Series were at +900 at BetMGM at the start of the season and moved to +650 on May 1 after a hot start.\nWhen the Yankees were slumping last May and June their odds were +650, then fell to +400 as the postseason began. In the example above, a $100 bet would have returned $400 if the New York Yankees had won the 2024 World Series.\nThese bets have good return on investment because there is a lot of volatility involved (along with the fact you are tying up money for at least six months). The downside of World Series odds betting is you are stuck at one price.\nYou could put $20 on a team at +500 odds, only for their odds to be +800 a few months later. It\u2019s a long season. You might like them still at +800, but if you cash out your previous future you\u2019re not going to get your entire stake.\nThe sportsbooks offer cash-outs as percentages of your potential payout in order to limit their liability in the event your future bet actually does cash.\nYou\u2019ll mostly always see \u201cplus odds\u201d offered by sportsbooks when it comes to World Series betting odds. There\u2019s too much variability for any sane bettor to wager hard-earned money on a -300 World Series odds favorite ($300 bet returns $100) in April, and bookmakers know this.\nWorld Series futures betting explained\nFutures betting isn\u2019t for everyone. That\u2019s the first thing to know if you\u2019re new to sports betting. The odds look appealing because as I mentioned earlier, you\u2019re always going to get \u201cplus odds\u201d in the World Series odds betting market.\nIt\u2019s easy to see +900 and think, $100 to win $900 would be great. But a +900 underdog has 10% implied probability, which means it has a 10% chance of cashing.\nI suggest always plugging your odds into an implied probability calculator to get a better understanding of the reality attached to those odds.\nI bet futures quite a bit because they\u2019re fun. Plus, it gives you something to follow for an entire season. It\u2019s also an investment, in a way.\nYou may not have believed the Mets would win the 2024 World Series. But if you grabbed them at +1500 at the start of the postseason and they won it all, you would have been looking at a nice return-on-investment.\nThe tricky part with World Series odds betting is that it\u2019s at the sportsbooks discretion as to if, and when, a cash-out is available.\nThe other part of wagering on World Series betting odds is timing. You\u2019re always going to get the greatest odds on favorites before the season starts. That\u2019s the risk you inherit if you instead make a MLB futures wager in June.\nThe Dodgers were at +800 when the 2024 World Series betting lines opened at BetMGM on November 1, 2023. They were at -425 before they closed out the series against the Yankees.\nI like to make MLB World Series futures wagers at the start of the season, and then around the quarter-pole mark. Memorial Day is always a benchmark in terms of the baseball season.\nMake a note of the odds you like before Opening Day, then compare them to the World Series odds on Memorial Day. That\u2019s a good way to power rate and find value in favorites that get off to a slow start, or dark horses you think have staying power.\nWorld Series odds FAQs\nWho is the World Series odds betting favorite?\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers are favored to win the 2025 World Series, with odds of +350 at DraftKings. A $100 bet on the Dodgers to win the World Series would win $350 in profit. The total payout would be $450 ($350 plus the original $100 wagered).\nWhen does the World Series start?\nGame 1 of the 2025 World Series will start at the end of October. The date and place is TBD.\nWho won the World Series last year?\nThe Los Angeles Dodgers won the 2024 World Series 4-1 over the New York Yankees."

Up to $2,500 can be won from each boost, and savvy bettors will have the best shot at maximizing this opportunity.\nWhy we recommend this promo\nBonus offers are standard at every other NJ sportsbook, but bonuses can\u2019t be withdrawn for cash and must be used within a specified timeframe.\nIf you apply the profit boosts to markets with reasonable odds, you\u2019ll likely hit a few wagers and secure hefty payouts. Once the cash winnings are in hand, you can pull the money from your account or roll it into your next bets.\nTypes of NJ Sportsbook promos\nBet-and-get offers are the most common welcome promo at New Jersey betting sites because they\u2019re an ideal option for first-time bettors.\nYou must only meet the minimum wagering requirement (typically $5), and a bonus will hit your account. Some sportsbooks only send the bonus if your bet wins, so it\u2019s important to know the terms and conditions before claiming a bet-and-get offer.\nNo-sweat bets, also known as first-bet insurance or a first-bet safety net, are another great choice for new bettors. If your opening wager loses, you\u2019ll get a bonus equal to the stake.\nSportsbooks will only refund your losses up to a certain amount, and some also enforce odds restrictions that must be satisfied to remain eligible. You won\u2019t receive a bonus if your first bet wins because you\u2019ll instead get a cash payout, which is much more valuable.\nUnlike other popular NJ sportsbook promos, deposit match offers don\u2019t rely on the outcome of your initial wager. Instead, these promos allow you to earn a bonus equal to your first deposit.\nFor example, a $150 deposit would land you $150 in bonuses. Sportsbooks occasionally match your deposit up to a certain percentage, meaning the bonus won\u2019t be equal to the amount you deposit.\nHow to maximize NJ Sportsbook promos\nBefore you rush to make your first bet and secure a bonus, it\u2019s wise to take some time and consider how you can get the most out of a sign-up offer.\nBet-and-get promos that don\u2019t require a winning wager can be maximized by betting on a market with long-shot odds or a multi-leg parlay with a big payout. The bonus is coming no matter the result of your bet, so why not swing for the fences?\nHowever, some sportsbooks only send a bonus if your bet wins, and those offers should be handled more carefully by backing a market with extremely short odds. You won\u2019t get a flashy cash payout if you win, but it\u2019s best to play it as safe as possible.\nFirst-bet insurance also provides an opportunity to bet an underdog or parlay and score a hefty payout.\nThe welcome offer only kicks in if your bet loses, so you can feel a sense of security knowing you won\u2019t be left empty-handed if the wager doesn\u2019t hit.\nWhat you can and can\u2019t bet on in NJ\nGarden State residents will be happy to know that New Jersey betting sites offer wagering on a wide variety of sports leagues and events.\nThese include daily matchups in each of the four major pro sports, prop betting, and futures markets like World Series odds or Super Bowl odds. Sportsbooks also accept action on niche markets, like cricket, darts, World Series odds, Super Bowl odds, and lacrosse.\nBetting on college sports is another option but with one major caveat. New Jersey betting sites don\u2019t accept wagers on collegiate sporting events that take place within state lines, or games that involve in-state schools.\nNJ Sportsbook promos FAQs\nHow old do you need to be to bet on sports in NJ?\nYou must be 21 or older to create an account and bet on sports with New Jersey sportsbooks.\nWhat is the best NJ sportsbook promo?\nOur experts recommend bet365\u2019s bet $5, get $150 in bonus bets deal because unlike DraftKings and FanDuel, you don\u2019t need to win your first wager.\nWhat is the best NJ sportsbook promo for beginners?\nThe bet365 bet $5, get $150 in bonus bets new user promo is now the only one that you don\u2019t have to win your first wager."
