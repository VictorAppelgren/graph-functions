      "feedback": "The analysis uses solid anchors (2.4T cloud spend by 2030, Azure +39% YoY, 21.2% cloud-spend CAGR to 2030; Shopify cash generation; Just Capital premium and its drivers; observed MSFT/cloud momentum) but it needs a world-class upgrade in structure, rigor, and explicit tests. Actionable edits: recast into a crisp base/bull/bear framework with a explicit causal chain from macro AI/digital infrastructure and cloud-moat economics to durable cash flows and multiple re-rating, then define clear invalidation triggers (e.g., cloud-capex deceleration below a defined threshold, a sustained rise in discount rates that compress multiples, or policy/regulatory shifts that materially dampen AI productivity gains); strengthen first-principles grounding by tying ROI and operating leverage to cloud-capex intensity and cost of capital, instead of labeling effects as “upcycle” without sensitivity; map every claim to a source ID (0G3A676BP, TN66GHPAT, 4LQD15CFU, J99EM2TPZ) and explicitly reconcile conflicts (e.g., oil oversupply vs capex-driven AI upcycle) in a dedicated tensions section; add a quantified sensitivity framework (scenarios with cloud spend growth ±X%, Azure growth ±Y%, discount-rate shifts ±Δbp) and translate them into implied cash-flow/earnings/multiple changes; expand the watch-list to decisive triggers with thresholds (upcoming MSFT Q4 FY2025 results; 21.2% CAGR realization sanity-check; Just Capital premium persistence; IBM hiring pause signal; oil/energy-inflation trajectory; policy shifts on tariffs/CHIPS) and attach the corresponding IDs after each item; tighten coverage of all critical sources (noting any gaps where sources such as Intel management or US Tariffs are referenced but not yet integrated); present the forecast in a tight, one-page form with a succinct causal map and a short table of drivers, catalysts, and invalidation signals to shore up reader confidence.",
