      "feedback": "Your draft is a pure mortgage‑rate narrative and does not satisfy the Argos criteria. Mortgage rates are not a canonical handle (the list includes UST 2y/10y, DXY, gold, etc., but not “mortgage rates”), so the piece fails the *handle‑mapping* gate. Moreover, it contains no explicit catalyst window tied to a causal transmission path, and it is a micro‑level story that cannot be scaled to a cross‑asset view. To make it acceptable, rewrite the analysis to focus on a canonical handle such as **ust10y** (or **ust2y** if you want a short‑term view). Anchor the narrative to Fed policy and balance‑sheet actions, and include a clear catalyst window (e.g., the Fed’s next FOMC meeting on 2025‑09‑16‑17, the release of the Fed’s balance‑sheet trajectory, and quarterly CPI/PCE data). Quantify the impact (e.g., a 25‑bp Fed hike → +20‑25 bp on the 10‑year curve). Remove all mortgage‑rate specific language, replace it with the UST curve discussion, and ensure every claim is linked to a source ID (e.g., LF0UUL917 for Fed policy, or a new ID for the Fed meeting). This will satisfy the handle‑mapping and catalyst requirements and bring the piece into the macro‑breadth you need.",
