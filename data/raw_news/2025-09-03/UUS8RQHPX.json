  "description": "An executive coach offers introverts five tips for sounding more confident.",
  "content": "If you\u2019re a quiet professional, especially an introvert, you know this feeling well. You\u2019re respected, but not remembered. You stay heads-down, hoping the work will speak for itself. But it doesn\u2019t. The truth? Many high-performing introverts struggle to be heard, not because they lack confidence or ability, but because they rely on their work to speak for itself. In today\u2019s fast-paced, visibility-driven workplace, that\u2019s no longer enough. If you want to be seen as a leader, you have to be heard. I recently coached a senior scientist at a global biotech company. Exceptionally skilled and deeply respected, she quietly disappeared in high-stakes meetings, and it was costing her. Colleagues overlooked her contributions. Leaders began excluding her from key decisions, and she was repeatedly passed over for leadership roles, not because of her ability, but because she wasn\u2019t seen as a strong presence in the room.\n\nHer insights were compelling, but she hesitated to assert them. Some leaders began to misread her silence as a lack of confidence or conviction. What she experienced is common, especially for introverts. Research from Harvard Business Review shows that introverts are often overlooked for leadership roles, not because they\u2019re less effective, but because they don\u2019t actively show up. When they stay under the radar, they risk being underestimated, no matter how valuable their contributions. Great work isn\u2019t enough if no one sees it. You have to make it visible. And that means speaking up.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be the loudest voice in the room. But you do need to be the one people remember when the meeting ends. That\u2019s what shifts perception. That\u2019s what gets you noticed. The good news? You don\u2019t have to change who you are. You just need a strategy to speak up with clarity, confidence, and impact.\n\n5 WAYS TO SPEAK UP WITHOUT BEING LOUD These five strategies are designed specifically for quiet professionals like you, who want to be heard by adding value, not volume. As an introvert, preparation is your superpower, but don\u2019t overdo it. When preparing for meetings, you don\u2019t need to know everything; you just need to know what matters. Don\u2019t just bring data; bring perspective. Before the meeting ask yourself: What\u2019s the one thing I want leadership to know? What decision are they facing, and how can I help move it forward?\n\nIntroverts often over-qualify their ideas to sound polite or careful, but it comes across as uncertainty. Skip phrases like \u201cThis might be silly . . .\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m not sure this makes sense . . .\u201d and say, \u201cHere\u2019s what I see\u201d or \u201cOne idea we haven\u2019t explored yet.\u201d If you catch yourself starting with a qualifier, pause. Say it silently, then switch to a more confident version before speaking. Skip the long preambles. Don\u2019t ease in with, \u201cLet me walk you through my thinking . . .\u201d Go straight to the value: \u201cHere\u2019s a risk I see\u201d or \u201cOne angle that haven\u2019t been mentioned . . .\u201d The faster you get to your point, the more likely people are to listen and remember it.\n\n5. FOLLOW UP TO EXTEND YOUR INFLUENCE Many introverts find that writing helps them organize and express their thoughts clearly, so use that strength. After the meeting, send a follow-up email summarizing key points or outlining next steps. This reinforces your ideas, keeps your contributions visible, and positions you as someone who drives clarity and action. YOU\u2019RE IN THE ROOM FOR A REASON If you\u2019ve ever stared at a table of senior leaders, or a Zoom screen full of them, and thought, What am I doing here? you\u2019re not alone.",

      "text": "Take a look at the following statements. I\u2019d rather email my comments to my boss than say them aloud. Being in a crowd exhausts me. I prefer curling up on the couch to unwind. I gain energy from quiet reflection as opposed to brainstorming with my team. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like being around people. I just enjoy working in solitude more. If you\u2019re an introvert, you can probably relate to some or all of these statements, and less to job posts looking for \u201cdynamic, outgoing candidates with exceptional communication skills.\u201d When applying for roles, you might even feel like the business world was not built for you, and in some industries, this may be true. One study found that more extroverted people \u2014 those who were more confident, sociable or assertive \u2014 had a 25% higher chance of being in a high-earning job. Fields like consulting and investment banking, for example, are fields in which extroverts may thrive. That said, many introverts work, and rise, in all kinds of environments. Like extroverts, introverts have a natural ability to build meaningful connections and communicate gracefully. As a professor and professional coach, I have been studying personality and leadership for over six years. I\u2019ve learned that the central difference between introverts and extroverts is not how well they communicate, but how they respond to stimuli. Extrovert brains are energized by stimulation and seek it out in social situations. Introverts, on the other hand, may equally enjoy being social, but prefer taking breaks to recharge. When it comes to actually communicating and building relationships, however, introverts may have the advantage. Contrary to popular belief, you don\u2019t need a big, loud presence to impress powerful people. A recent study that assessed the performance of more than 900 CEOs found that people with introverted personalities exceeded the expectations of their investors more often than extroverted ones. Further studies show that while highly extroverted people are 25% more likely to land top jobs, introverts often make better leaders. To better understand how introverts have learned to thrive in careers that seem more suited for their opposites, my coauthor and I interviewed 15 recent university graduates and a handful of seasoned industry veterans \u2014 all self-identified introverts \u2014 who work at some of the most prominent consulting firms and investment banks in North America. Through their stories, we identified a few behavioral patterns that have helped lead to their success. Introverts entering the workforce can use our learnings to your advantage. Knowing what you\u2019re naturally good at, as well as what you\u2019re capable of, and how to leverage those skills, is the first step towards growing in any industry. Introverts are great listeners. Brooke Callaghan, a first-year investment banking analyst at BMO Toronto, told us that, in her experience, introverts bring unique perspectives to the table. As avid listeners, they can capture information that some extroverts might overlook. Unlike extroverts, introverts aren\u2019t known to jump to conclusions, and as a result, they garner more attention and appreciation from an audience when they do speak. Pro tip: If you\u2019re in a meeting know that it\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not the first one to speak. Listen keenly, focus on what the presenter is saying, and take in all the information. Then, process it, integrate it, and make a valuable contribution. The point is not to make a point, but to contribute something that is useful and insightful \u2014 a skill many introverts will find easy to master. That said, if you are nervous that you may be asked to speak up before you are ready, study the meeting agenda beforehand and write down your ideas in advance. Documenting your thoughts in this way will help you remember them later on and ease some of the anxiety you may be feeling. Remember that an idea that\u2019s 90% baked is better than one that is never spoken at all. Introverts build deep relationships. Brooke also told us that, as an introvert, her natural tendency to read a room, empathize with others, and think before she speaks helps her gain a deep understanding of the people or situation she is engaging with. As a result, it\u2019s easier for her than most to foster meaningful relationships with her clients and peers. Jeffrey Hayzlett, host of the primetime television show Executive Perspectives, added that introverts tend to rely on their gut feeling rather than seek out external affirmation. They are often autonomous, an attribute that helps them gain the respect of their seniors. Pro tip: If meeting new people makes you feel uncomfortable, start with setting small goals for yourself. Don\u2019t hide in the corner during a networking event or turn off your video during a virtual happy hour. Make an effort to introduce yourself. The first few times may require an extra push, but slowly you\u2019ll gain more courage and feel more comfortable striking up conversations. Use your natural tendency to empathize with others to guide you and help you gain an understanding of your audience. If you don\u2019t want to speak up during events, you can also take time after to write an email to someone you\u2019d like to form a relationship with. Tell them what you thought of a point they made during a meeting or share a report or an article that you think they could benefit from. Introverts are adaptable. Throughout our interviews, we observed that many of the introverts with careers in extroverted industries were able to adapt to their work environments over time. Unlike listening and empathy, this skill wasn\u2019t something that came naturally to them. It was something they had to work towards. Our interviewees were driven by one of two things: a desire to become more extroverted or a desire for success that outweighed their natural personality traits. Both motivations resonated with Daniel Sun, an associate at the Boston Consulting Group\u2019s Toronto office. \u201cHumans are social creatures, and introverts desire social interaction, albeit to a lesser degree than extroverts. Since effective communication is fundamental to success in consulting, us introverts are up for the challenge, and over time, with practice, it becomes second nature,\u201d he said. Daniel is not alone in his sentiments. Brooke, a self-described \u201cnot shy but reserved\u201d introvert who enjoys the company of others, decided to go into banking because she was attracted by the dynamic environment. She knew taking on a people-centric role would push her outside of her comfort zone and help her develop the confidence to \u201cspeak up\u201d more often. And she was right. To be successful in an industry that favors extroverts, like banking, people who are more introverted need to use both the analytical strengths that come second nature to them and develop the social skills that may not. Robert Chen, a Bachelor of Commerce grad with two years under his belt as an investment banking analyst explained, \u201cUsually, your first five to seven years at the bank as a junior analyst or associate draw heavily on your analytical skills. However, you are generally expected to develop more client-facing communication skills as you progress. This is most distinct as you go from the associate to VP level, where the client-facing and relationship-building aspects of your work really rely on strong communication.\u201d Through our research, we found that the willingness and effort to adapt was a key skill of the most successful introverts. In fact, we found that by the time many introverts reach the C-Suite level, they are more likely to perceive themselves as having a mix of introverted and extroverted tendencies. Pro tip: Take a note from Brooke, who, not only sought the advice from leaders in her industry, but also invested in improving her skills on her own time, outside of work. Brooke studied how introverts can use their strengths to thrive in extroverted fields. Two of the works she found particularly helpful are Professor Francesca Gino\u2019s article, \u201cIntroverts, Extroverts, and the Complexities of Team Dynamics,\u201d and author Susan Cain\u2019s Quiet. \u201cAll of these leaders will tell you they\u2019ve had to make adjustments,\u201d Cain told the Washington Post in an interview, referring to introverts like Google founder Larry Page and Yahoo CEO Marissa Meyer, among others. \u201cMany have told me that they\u2019ve had to grow more comfortable with public speaking, that\u2019s a very common one. All of it is pushing yourself a bit outside of your comfort zone.\u201d If personality is measured along an introvert-extrovert spectrum, it is evident that the kind of introverts who enter extroverted workplaces are not extreme in their tendencies. They inherently trust in their own ability to assimilate, and at the very least, are up for the challenge. The big takeaway? Before you give up on that sales role because \u201ccold calls seem daunting,\u201d or decide a job in investment banking, marketing, public relations, or any other \u201cextroverted\u201d field is not for you, think about your strengths and how they will add value to that position. As an introvert, you may take more time to voice your ideas, and be less outspoken than your extroverted colleagues. But your success is driven by your ability to be flexible, listen, understand, and make deep connections with the people who surround you. Don\u2019t take those skills for granted. Use them to guide you and rise to the top of any field."
