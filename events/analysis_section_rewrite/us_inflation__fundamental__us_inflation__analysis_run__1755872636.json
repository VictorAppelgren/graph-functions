      "feedback": "The analysis draft presents a solid foundation but requires enhancements in several areas to achieve world-class quality. First, deepen the causal chain by explicitly linking how tariffs influence both producer costs and consumer prices, and clarify the mechanisms through which these factors impact inflation and Fed policy. Incorporate specific quantitative data, such as the exact percentage changes in durable goods prices, to strengthen arguments and avoid generalities. Ensure that the scenario structure aligns with a multi-year horizon by discussing potential long-term implications of current trends, such as how persistent inflation could reshape monetary policy and market dynamics. Additionally, enhance citation density by integrating more references from the source material to support claims, particularly regarding the labor market and inflation forecasts. Finally, conclude with a more definitive base case scenario, outlining specific catalysts to watch, such as upcoming economic reports, and articulate key risks with greater specificity, including potential geopolitical developments.",
