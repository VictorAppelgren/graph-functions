      "feedback": "Strong multi‑channel framing, but to reach world‑class you need a tighter, testable 0–3 week thesis anchored to dates, a clean causal chain, disciplined sourcing, and explicit thresholds. Edit as follows: (1) Reframe the core thesis into a three‑part, date‑driven map: immediate price transmission in autos from tariff cuts to 15% (US–Japan) and pass‑through signals in U.S. pricing (S15934PBQ); near‑term catalysts from the EU–US framework (MFN 15% baseline, autos relief contingent on EU legislation) and India’s 50% tariff threat (Aug 27) plus the de minimis expiration (Aug 28) (cite 12, 9, 3,  VCZKKPORO); (2) tighten the causal chain with explicit links and numbers: tariff changes raise input costs (e.g., Ford still says costs >$2B year‑ahead per S15934PBQ), which firms attempt to offset through price or margin adjustments; wholesale price signals have shown outsized moves (June tariff rate 9% actual, 18.6% average tariff rate cited by Citi/Yale context in 12), with apparel prices up about 9% YoY in back‑to‑school data and broader inflation risk embedded in CPI components (26, 12); (3) quantify and map channels to your horizon: autos pass‑through likely within weeks; consumer discretionary/apparel and healthcare inputs show detectable but not uniform pass‑through (26, 23, 23–24); (4) fix sources and credibility: drop less credible outlets (gateway pundit) or clearly flag as sentiment/containment notes, and cite every assertion to IDs in the material (S15934PBQ for autos, DNG58CC09 for MPEDA diversification, VCZKKPORO for de minimis, DGG6HXUFZ for Navarro/India tariff stance, 12 for tariff inflation dynamics, 27 for magnets/rare earths, 26 for consumer pricing signals, 9/8/21 framework items where applicable); (5) present a crisp monitor list and thresholds: MFN/15% baselines around 15% (EU), India 50% (Aug 27), de minimis expiry Aug 28; watch CPI components (apparel up ~9% YoY in Klaviyo data cited in 26; wholesale inflation up and pass‑through shares cited in 12), energy‑commodity flows (Druzhba pipeline disruptions implied via Hungary/ Slovakia commentary in  CWVWSACA7 or related pieces if used), and cross‑border chip/rare earth dynamics (27, 11, 21). (6) articulate invalidation points: if EU auto relief legislation slips beyond early Sep or if tariff revenue overshoots/buckles debt dynamics, or if price pass‑through remains persistently muted despite tariff changes; (7) tighten prose and keep to 0–3 weeks by grouping around: immediate driver (policy/news), near‑term catalysts, and positioning/levels, with a single, testable forecast path and a short list of next data points to verify. This would yield a sharper, more defensible, source‑dense piece with explicit cues for trading/viewing.",
