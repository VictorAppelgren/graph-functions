  "content": "The Taylor Swift effect has reached the Chiefs, according to owner Clark Hunt.\n\nDuring an interview on \u201cThe Pat McAfee Show\u201d on Friday, Hunt discussed the effect Swift\u2019s relationship with Travis Kelce has had on his organization following her appearance on the tight end\u2019s \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast.\n\nHunt was nothing short of positive when discussing Swift \u2014 specifically citing her impact with female Chiefs fans over recent seasons.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a whirlwind, I would say, for the organization over the last two years since Taylor literally stepped into our lives. She\u2019s done an amazing job, unintentionally, of increasing our female fanbase.\n\n\u201cWe used to be about a 50-50 ratio, male-to-female fanbase, and now 57 percent of our fans are female, which I think is probably the highest in the National Football League. So there\u2019s absolutely been a Taylor Swift effect.\u201d\n\nHunt also shared his support of Swift and Kelce\u2019s relationship, saying that the two make an \u201camazing couple.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me just say how happy we are for their relationship,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cThey\u2019re an amazing couple, and watching the two of them together is really special. That podcast, seeing them side by side talking about their relationship, was absolutely amazing.\u201d\n\nDuring her time on the \u201cNew Heights\u201d podcast on Wednesday, the 14-time Grammy winner opened up about her \u201crookie\u201d NFL season during the early stages of her and Kelce\u2019s relationship, revealing the moment that means the most to her from that year.\n\nSwift, who started dating Kelce in 2023, said she cherished the moment when Kelce\u2019s mother invited her down to the field to celebrate the Chiefs\u2019 AFC Championship game win in 2024.\n\n\u201cThe first time I stepped on the field, which would have been when you won the AFC Championship, the first season that I was with you, and it was in Baltimore, and we\u2019re in the suite and you just won the AFC Championship, we\u2019re freaking out and everybody\u2019s screaming, and [Travis\u2019] mom goes, \u2018Alright, let\u2019s go down to the field,\u2019\u201d Swift, 35, said during the podcast.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018What, we\u2019re doing, what do you mean? We\u2019re going where?\u2019 And she\u2019s like, \u2018We\u2019re going down to the field,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Did he say that that\u2019s OK?\u2019 Cause we hadn\u2019t talked about this.\u201d",

He was taught the wrong thing. And he just went downhill,\u201d Player said in a video \u201cThe Golf Supply\u201d YouTube channel posted this week. \u201cIf you had a man like Ben Hogan teaching Jordan Spieth, he would be the best in the world.

I said, \u2018OK\u2019 because I couldn\u2019t say no \u2026 but I don\u2019t know if my heart was really into it.\n\u201c\u2026 My knowledge and wisdom around relationships wasn\u2019t vast.

We don\u2019t,\u201d Berry said.\n\u201cBut I think we will get married just because, out of the people I\u2019ve been married to, this is the person I should have married. And I feel like I should, we should get married, but it\u2019s not because we feel like we have to. I think it\u2019s something that we would like to do just because we want that expression.\u201d\nBerry was married to her second husband, musician Eric Ben\u00e9t, from 2001-05."
