  "description": "A federal grand jury in the District refused to indict a woman accused of threatening President Trump over social media as juries keep cases out of the courtroom amid his crime crackdown in the nation\u2019s capital.",
  "content": "A federal grand jury in the District refused to indict a woman accused of threatening President Trump over social media as juries keep cases out of the courtroom amid his crime crackdown in the nation\u2019s capital.\n\nThe public defender for Nathalie Rose Jones revealed Monday that the grand jury chose not to push through the indictment on threat charges, according to a court filing.\n\n\u201cA grand jury has now found no probable cause to indict Ms. Jones on the charged offenses. Given that finding, the weight of the evidence is weak,\u201d the court document said. \u201cThe government may intend to try again to obtain an indictment, but the evidence has not changed and no indictment is likely.\u201d\n\nGrand jury indictments are held to a low evidentiary burden, making it common for them to make it to trial.\n\nThe spike in refusals lends to the impression this may be an act of protest against Mr. Trump\u2019 declared crime emergency in Washington, which saw National Guard troops and federal authorities flooding the streets.\n\nMs. Jones\u2019 attorneys sought to secure her release from jail as the court weighs next steps in the case.\n\nCourt documents against Ms. Jones include Facebook posts in which she allegedly describes killing Mr. Trump in graphic detail.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s where we are: I literally told FBI in five states that I am willing to sacrificially kill this POTUS by disemboweling him and cutting out his trachea with Liz Cheney and all The Affirmation present and you did not come to my home this way at all,\u201d the defendant wrote, according to prosecutors.\n\nProsecutors said Ms. Jones called Mr. Trump a \u201cterrorist\u201d and a \u201cNazi\u201d and would kill the president if given the opportunity during a voluntary interview with the Secret Service on Aug. 15.\n\nThe prosecutors said that in that same interview, she told the Secret Service she had access to a \u201cbladed object\u201d she would use to \u201ccarry out her mission of killing\u201d Mr. Trump.\n\nShe said she wanted to kill the president to \u201cavenge\u201d the people who died during the COVID-19 pandemic, which she blamed on Mr. Trump\u2019s first administration.\n\nMs. Jones, who is originally from New York, was arrested in the District while in town for a protest Aug. 16. Prosecutors said she admitted to making the threats but said she didn\u2019t have any real desire to harm the president.\n\nMs. Jones is now the sixth case in which D.C. grand juries prevented hefty charges from being brought before a judge \u2014 with each case centered around charges of assaulting federal law enforcement officers.\n\nA grand jury last week declined to indict former Justice Department employee Sean Dunn, whose video showed him chucking a foot-long sandwich at a federal police officer and scurrying away.\n\nAnother grand jury last month passed on indicting Alvin Summers, who was arrested after he allegedly wrestled a U.S. Park Police officer to the ground while he was being handcuffed on the National Mall.\n\nCharging documents said a National Guard soldier saw the ruckus and ran over to detain a fleeing Mr. Summers. The filing said Mr. Summers discarded an object, which was a suspected vial of PCP, during his attempted escape.\n\nAnd three grand juries refused to indict Sidney Lori Reid following her July arrest for tussling with federal authorities standing by to make immigration arrests outside the D.C. Jail.\n\nIn Mr. Dunn and Ms. Reid\u2019s cases, prosecutors said they\u2019re now pursuing misdemeanor charges instead of felony assault. A conviction on felony charges could have meant up to eight years behind bars.",
