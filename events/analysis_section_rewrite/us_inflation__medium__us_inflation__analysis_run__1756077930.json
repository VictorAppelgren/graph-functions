      "feedback": "Strong base, but to reach world‑class you need a clean, explicit 3–6 month scenario map with named catalysts, invalidations, and crisp causal transmission. Edit in one paragraph or a tight outline that: (1) builds a formal base/alt1/alt2 scenario with timing windows and path dependence, e.g., Base: fiscal package passes with debt rise ~$4T over a decade and ~$3.4T tax/spend package; AI productivity adds 1–1.5% annual GDP growth offsetting some inflation; private‑market bets (Pacaso, Range, mogul) crowd in to stabilize consumption; health‑tech monetizes via HeartSciences/AI‑ECG constraints; Walmart private label dynamics hold staples’ pricing power (YQOMV2HAJ; ILYC1M41F; UPV3X2MQ6; EPJYXB7DX; V8TEZOR8R). Alt A: steeper debt impulse lifts real yields and policy risk premia sooner; Alt B: productivity surprises falter and growth decelerates; specify triggers and invalidations. (2) articulate the full causal chain and market transmission: policy → deficits → yields/credit conditions → equity/credit risk premia; AI productivity → productivity growth and tax receipts; private‑market capital inflows supporting consumption/real estate markets; healthcare AI monetization; consumer staples margin dynamics (YQOMV2HAJ; UPV3X2MQ6; ILYC1M41F; V8TEZOR8R). (3) quantify with concrete numbers from sources, not adjectives: debt impact (~$4T), private label/BetterGoods price bands ($2–$15 for BetterGoods; Great Value/bread sourcing by Sara Lee) and its margin/volume implications; Pacaso’s 21% YoY co‑ownership growth and $1.8T vacation‑home market; 32B ECG market; 78M potential AI‑driven jobs; 71–60% ranges in retirement behavior; 50k tire warranties; 11.8M uninsured under OBBA; 80‑hour Medicaid rule; 40% of Americans seeking vacation homes; 78M jobs; 40+ destinations (ILYC1M41F, UPV3X2MQ6, V8TEZOR8R, YQOMV2HAJ). (4) fix source coverage and reconciliation: align every causal claim to a single ID, note where sources diverge (e.g., debt impact vs growth offset views in Fox/Beninga‑range pieces), and reconcile with an explicit note on political bias; (5) sharpen section alignment to horizon/style: end with a base case, 2 alts, defined risks, 3 watch signals, and a concise confidence band; assign probability weights (e.g., base 40–55%, alt A 15–25%, alt B 20–30%) and specify invalidation thresholds (e.g., yields up 50–75bps vs 10bps, policy reversal, AI regulatory delays). (6) present a tighter, readable structure: a one‑page scenario map with a short narrative plus a 3–4 line catalyst/trigger table and a 2–3 line invalidation checklist; ensure every claim ties to IDs (EPJYXB7DX; UPV3X2MQ6; ILYC1M41F; YQOMV2HAJ; V8TEZOR8R). This will stop the conflation of political narratives with macro/sectoral transmission, tighten the causal chain, and deliver a world‑class, testable 3–6 month view.",
