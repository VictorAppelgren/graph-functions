      "summary": "The 2025 tax law temporarily raises the SALT cap to $40,000, but high‑income filers face a 30% phase‑out starting at $500,000 (single $250,000), reverting to the $10,000 cap by $600,000. Pass‑through entity tax (PTET) regimes let business owners pay state taxes at the entity level, fully deductible federally and credited to owners’ state returns, thereby bypassing the individual SALT cap. PTET also reduces AGI, AMT income, and self‑employment tax, and can enable the full standard deduction and new above‑the‑line charitable deductions starting in 2026. High earners should evaluate state‑specific PTET rules and consult advisors to determine if the election remains advantageous for 2025 and beyond.",
