  "description": "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered Trump administration to restore hundreds of frozen National Science Foundation research grants to UCLA.",
  "content": "Royce Hall on the campus of UCLA. A federal judge has ordered the government to restore a portion of the university\u2019s research grants that were frozen.\n\nA federal judge on Tuesday ordered the Trump administration to restore hundreds of suspended UCLA science research grants, affecting more than a third of the $584 million in funds the government abruptly froze late last month.\n\nIn her evening order, issued hours after a San Francisco court hearing, U.S. District Court Judge Rita F. Lin said the government\u2019s slashing of UCLA funds violated her June ruling blocking science research grant terminations.\n\nThe National Science Foundation\u2019s \u201csuspension of the grants at issue here is vacated,\u201d wrote Lin, of the Northern District of California. She ordered the Trump administration to file an update by Aug. 19 detailing whether it had restored the grants or, if not, \u201can explanation of why it was not feasible and a description of the steps that have been taken thus far.\u201d\n\nThe case \u2014 independently filed by a group of UC professors \u2014 is the first legal test of whether massive grant suspensions at UCLA will pass court muster.\n\nThe Trump administration froze $584 million in science, medical and other federal grants, citing the university\u2019s alleged discrimination in admissions and failure to \u201cpromote a research environment free of antisemitism.\u201d\n\nThe totality of UCLA freezes cover research funded by the NSF, the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Energy. They include studies into areas such as cancer, neurobiology and clean energy.\n\nSpokespeople for the NSF, UC and UCLA did not immediately reply to requests for comment late Tuesday.\n\nThe order issued Tuesday is related only to NSF grants, which make up about 300 of the those frozen at UCLA. Hundreds of other suspended grants from the NIH and a DOE are not affected.\n\nThe court challenge did not come in a case filed by the University of California, which has not sued over the cuts. Instead, it came in a 2-month-old class-action lawsuit filed by researchers at UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley.\n\nAt question during the Tuesday hearing was whether cuts to NSF grants were illegal under Lin\u2019s June court order that blocked science funding terminations to many UC researchers throughout the nine-campus system.\n\nUC professors funded by the NSF, Environmental Protection Agency and National Endowment for the Humanities had sued, arguing they faced cuts because their grants appeared in federal keyword searches related to race amid President Trump\u2019s push to rid the government of diversity, equity and inclusion programs.\n\nThey also argued their funding was removed through the use of generic form letters with no explanation. They argued federal law requires that government officials cite the reasons why money already approved through a competitive applications process was taken away.\n\nLin said she was inclined to agree with researcher arguments while the case proceeded. She issued a preliminary injunction June 23.\n\nOn Tuesday, Lin challenged Trump administration lawyers to explain why the new sciencecuts at UCLA did not violate her earlier court order.\n\n\u201cTwo weeks ago, NSF went out and, again, used form letters to cut off findings to researchers at UCLA en masse,\u201d Lin said. She asked DOJ laywers what set apart the most recent cuts from previous ones she enjoined.\n\nGovernment lawyers said the newest UCLA cuts were different for two reasons. First, they said, the funding freezes were \u201csuspensions,\u201d not \u201cterminations,\u201d which were the subject of Lin\u2019s earlier ruling.\n\n\u201cIf it is a suspension, then it is not covered under the court\u2019s injunction,\u201d said DOJ lawyer Jason Altabet.\n\nAnother DOJ lawyer, Michael Velchik, argued that the grants had been cut so recently that they could not be viewed as \u201cterminations.\u201d\n\n\u201cA week is certainly not enough time for this court to adjudicate that a suspension of one week is de facto a termination,\u201d Velchik said.\n\n\u201cNSF\u2019s indefinite suspensions differ from a termination in name only,\u201d she wrote.\n\nLin later added: \u201cFor avoidance of doubt, the court also clarifies that grant \u2018termination,\u2019 as the term is used in the preliminary Injunction, encompasses circumstances where grant funding is cut off on a long-term or indefinite basis, like the suspensions carried out by NSF on July 30\u201d at UCLA.\n\nThe government lawyers also said the Trump administration did not freeze all grants to UCLA but spared some that were \u201ccritical\u201d and \u201cimportant.\u201d\n\nThey did not elaborate on which or how many grants those were. This answer came in response to Lin\u2019s questions about whether the government was indiscriminately cutting grants \u2014 an issue that led her to block terminations in June.\n\nChemerinsky said that the UCLA cuts amounted to \u201cexactly the kind of en mass terminations that the court enjoined previously.\u201d\n\nFor researchers, he said, the terms \u201csuspension\u201d and \u201ctermination\u201d are the same.\n\n\u201cThey can no longer pay rent, no longer pay graduate students, no longer pay postdocs. There is no difference,\u201d Chemerinsky said.\n\nThe Berkeley professor accused the government of \u201cholding hostage all the individual grants to try to coerce UCLA into a settlement.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are legitimate and bona fide concerns that the government has with the conduct that has taken place at UCLA,\u201d he said, saying the university has had \u201cgross and horrific\u201d antisemitism and also mentioning allegations of \u201cracial preferences\u201d at the UCLA medical school.\n\nThe Trump administration has demanded more than $1 billion from the University of California to restore the more than half a billion dollars in UCLA funds. The government is also asking UCLA to agree to sweeping campus changes over protest rules, gender identity, admissions-data sharing and other areas.\n\nUC leaders say they are willing to negotiate but that the current terms are \u201cunacceptable.\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom has called the Trump demands an attempt at \u201cextortion\u201d and \u201cransom,\u201d saying he wants to sue.\n\nThe UC Board of Regents, which held an emergency meeting at UCLA on Monday, has not announced a suit.",

      "text": "\u2018Bring it on, Gavin,\u2019 White House says to Newsom on threat to sue over UCLA cuts\n- Share via\n- The White House indicated it was ready to battle with Newsom over UCLA grant freezes.\n- \u201cBring it on, Gavin,\u201d said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n- On the line are $584 million in frozen UCLA grants. The government has asked for $1 billion and sweeping campus changes to restore the funds.\nWASHINGTON \u2014 As Gov. Gavin Newsom and the University of California consider whether to sue the Trump administration to restore more than half a billion dollars in federal grants to UCLA, the White House on Tuesday had a terse response.\n\u201cBring it on, Gavin,\u201d said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt when asked about Newsom\u2019s opposition to a Trump plan demanding more than $1 billion and sweeping campus changes at UCLA to resolve federal antisemitism findings against the university.\n\u201cThis administration is well within its legal right to do this, and we want to ensure that our colleges and our universities are respecting the 1st Amendment rights and the religious liberties of students on their campuses and UCLA has failed to do that, and I have a whole list of examples that I will forward to Gavin Newsom\u2019s press office, if he hasn\u2019t seen them himself,\u201d Leavitt said.\nThe statement was the first public comment from the White House about the high-stakes conflict between the nation\u2019s premier public university system and the Trump administration, which has accused UCLA of violating the civil rights of Jewish students, illegally considering race in admissions and treating transgender people in sports, healthcare and campus life in ways that the government claims hinder women\u2019s rights.\nUCLA is in conflict with the Trump administration, which has frozen federal grants and demanded a $1-billion fine over a host of allegations. Gov. Gavin Newsom said the state will sue.\nLeavitt spoke after a question from The Times about how Trump would respond to Newsom\u2019s comments late last week that the settlement offer for UCLA was \u201cextortion\u201d and \u201cransom.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019ll sue,\u201d Newsom said Friday.\nResponding to Leavitt\u2019s comments, a Newsom spokesperson pointed The Times to a meme posted on X after the news conference.\n\u201cGlorious leader is entitled to all treasures of the realm, especially from universities,\u201d said the post from Newsom\u2019s press office account. The graphic features an image of what appears to a be a North Korean news anchor with a North Korean flag in the background.\nIn an earlier joint statement with California legislative leaders, Newsom said that the action against UCLA \u201cisn\u2019t about protecting Jewish students \u2014 it\u2019s a billion-dollar political shakedown from the pay-to-play president. Trump has weaponized the Department of Justice to punish California, crush free thinking, and kneecap the greatest public university system in the world.\u201d\nNo lawsuit has been filed and the UC Board of Regents, which held an emergency meeting Monday afternoon over the grant cuts, has not announced how it will proceed aside from calling Trump\u2019s current terms \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\nNewsom sits as a voting member on the 24-person board, has appointed several of its members and can wield influence on the body, although the final decision on a lawsuit or settlement rests with the regents. Newsom did not attend Monday\u2019s meeting.\nIn a statement after the meeting, a UC spokesperson said the $1-billion price tag would be \u201cdevastating.\u201d\n\u201cUC\u2019s leadership spent recent days evaluating the demand, updating the UC community, and engaging with stakeholders,\u201d said Meredith Turner, UC senior vice president of external relations. \u201cOur focus remains on protecting students\u2019 access to a UC education and promoting the academic freedom, excellence, and innovation that have always been at the heart of UC\u2019s work.\u201d\nThe Trump administration has suspended $584 million in grants at UCLA over what the U.S. Department of Justice has described as the school\u2019s \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 to Jewish students\u2019 civil rights.\nHundreds of grants \u2014 from the National Science Foundation, National Institutes of Health and Department of Energy \u2014 are on hold at UCLA. The money funds research into cancer, math, brain science and other areas, and helps pay for graduate student stipends and tuition as well as lab upkeep. If the freezes stay for the long term, administrators are considering layoffs and other budget reductions.\nCiting the reasons for the freezes, a July 30 NSF letter to UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk alleged UCLA \u201cengages in racism, in the form of illegal affirmative action, UCLA fails to promote a research environment free of antisemitism and bias; UCLA discriminates against and endangers women by allowing men in women\u2019s sports and private women-only spaces.\u201d\nFrenk, in a campuswide message the next day, disputed the funding halt.\n\u201cThis far-reaching penalty of defunding life-saving research does nothing to address any alleged discrimination,\u201d he wrote."

      "text": "Man who overstayed his visa stole food aid from thousands of needy Californians, feds say\n- Share via\nA man believed to have been a part of a Romanian criminal organization was sentenced to 10 years in prison last week after he stole tens of thousands of welfare cards across California and New York.\nCatalin-Marius Graur, 43, was sentenced Aug. 4 after pleading guilty in October to one count of bank fraud. When he was arrested at a New York City Airbnb apartment in June 2024, he had over $37,000 in cash and nearly 1,500 stolen account access numbers in his possession, according to a statement from the Department of Justice.\nIn his scheme, officials said, Graur targeted those receiving Electronic Benefit Transfer funds, which are distributed by social services departments to help low-income communities receive food and cash aid. In California, these are accessed through programs like CalFresh \u2014 previously known as food stamps \u2014 and CalWORKS.\nAccording to DOJ officials, Graur would steal EBT card information by attaching \u201csophisticated skimming devices\u201d to ATMs and other sales machines across Los Angeles and the Inland Empire. Once the victim entered their card, the device captured their information. Fraudulent cards can be made with the stolen information and used to withdraw EBT funds.\nGraur was not living in the United States legally, according to officials. A Romanian citizen, he entered the U.S. in 2020 on a tourist visa but overstayed his visit, the release said. He worked with multiple people internationally in the scheme, with one accomplice receiving more than 36,000 stolen EBT card numbers from Graur over the course of three years, the statement said. Another co-conspirator involved in the scheme, Mihai-Adrian Humoiu, was sentenced to over seven years in prison in May, according to the FBI.\nAccording to the Los Angeles division of the FBI, which investigated Graur\u2019s case, there are multiple instances of Romanian citizens coming to the U.S. to commit bank fraud. The agency has investigated that crime route in particular for many years.\nIn 2023, The Times reported on a string of Romanian citizens who had been arrested for skimming EBT funds through ATMs, including Virgil Negru, a member of the Eforie City Council, who was charged with felony forgery and identity theft.\nBecause the process of skimming is complicated and requires lots of different steps, the crimes are often organized and conducted in groups. It\u2019s a crime of opportunity, they said, and scammers travel anywhere they think they could find success \u2014 it\u2019s not exclusive to California or Romania.\nUnlike modern debit or credit cards, EBT cards traditionally have not had microchips, making them especially easy to clone. But that changed in California in April, when the state rolled out new cards with microchips, said Gerry Bonilla, the division chief for program compliance in the state\u2019s Social Services Department. Customers with the new cards can use the tap function for transaction at all businesses with the feature available on their sales machines.\nSince issuing the new cards, Bonilla said that the department has received fewer reports of EBT scamming. Nowadays, most of the reports his office receives of EBT card scamming come from stores without microchip readers on their point of sale machines.\nThe Times also reported that wait times for EBT fund reimbursement after reporting a scam could take weeks, as agencies became overwhelmed with requests. In California, this process has quickened in recent years, with the process now being nearly \u201cinstantaneous,\u201d Bonilla said. Customers have to file a benefit reimbursement claim within 90 days starting on the day of the theft. The state requires that claim to be processed within 10 days, but Bonilla said it often only takes one or two days, depending on the circumstances of the theft.\nCalFresh has additional requirements for reimbursement. Customers cannot be reimbursed twice in one Federal Fiscal Year and the amount \u201ccannot exceed the equivalent of two months\u2019 worth of their monthly allotment per occurence,\u201d Bonilla said in an email.\nSeparately, another person, also from Romania, pleaded guilty to bank fraud and asylum fraud in San Francisco for the same type of scam with EBT cards, according to another DOJ statement. Marius Marian, 39, illegally accessed over $500,000 in EBT funds through attaching skimming devices to ATMs. Marian is a Romanian citizen who illegally entered the U.S. and then was deported in 2019 after serving eight months in custody for bank fraud. In an application for asylum, submitted to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security around April 2023, he knowingly failed to disclose his previous deportation, the statement said. His sentencing is scheduled for October."

      "text": "UC Berkeley law professors take on a case for colleagues: Fighting Trump research cuts\n- Share via\n- UC researchers fight Trump cuts in federal court and get an early win.\n- They got help from prominent UC Berkeley law school colleagues who pressed their case.\nAmid an avalanche of lawsuits in which universities and states are fighting the Trump administration over slashing research funding, a significant early win this week in California stands out.\nSix individual UC arts, science and medical researchers banded together to fight cancellations to their at times relatively small, but distinct federally funded studies: examining racial equity in education, assessing health risks to racial minorities who face wildfire smoke, evaluating the role of Greek Orthodox Christians in Istanbul in the 19th century.\nLacking the power of big institutional legal backing to pursue their case, they got help from of two of their UC Berkeley colleagues to personally make their case: Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school and an expert in constitutional law, and Claudia Polsky, former California deputy attorney general-turned-UC law professor.\nThe result?\nA federal judge has not only ordered the Trump administration to restore millions of dollars in UC grants, but also said the case could proceed as a class-action suit, opening it to UC researchers statewide.\nThe Trump administration has taken Texas and Kentucky to court over policies that allow undocumented immigrant students to pay in-state tuition.\nNeeta Thakur, a UC San Francisco associate professor and physician whose $1.3-million grant to study how wildfire smoke affected millions of California emergency room patients was canceled in April with $700,000 left to spend, called the judge\u2019s decision \u201cheartening.\u201d Thakur, whose work was funded by the Environmental Protection Agency, said she was \u201ccautiously optimistic, knowing this was one step in the right direction. We will see how the case unfolds as it moves forward.\u201d\nSan Francisco-based Judge Rita F. Lin of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California said in orders late Monday that the federal government engaged in \u201cquintessential viewpoint discrimination\u201d when it rescinded funding this year to the researchers at Thakur\u2019s campus and UC Berkeley.\nLin issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from halting grants to the researchers who sued the Environmental Protection Agency, National Endowment for the Humanities and National Science Foundation.\nAnd because she approved a class-action suit, the judge said the government must restore virtually all grants from the three agencies to researchers at any University of California campus that saw their funding discontinued after Trump\u2019s inauguration if projects were flagged over diversity-related topics or cut off via form letters that did not contain specific reasons for funding halts.\nAmid President Trump\u2019s attack on DEI, California schools and colleges aim to keep diversity efforts intact while skirting clashes with the administration.\nIt is unclear how many grants or the dollar amount the case will cover.\nOverall, UC received more than $4 billion in federal grants last year, with $2.6 billion coming from the National Institutes of Health. The second largest federal source \u2014 at more than $524 million \u2014 was the National Science Foundation. There were millions of dollars in grants from the EPA and National Endowment for the Humanities.\nTrump administration filings in the case and other litigation have shown that a vast swath of cancellations took place this year using keyword searches related to \u201cdiversity,\u201d \u201cequity\u201d and \u201cinclusion\u201d \u2014 or were slashed via generic agency letters.\n\u201cThe record reflects that the challenged grant terminations were likely performed en masse, without individualized analysis, and without providing grantees with reasoned explanation for the terminations,\u201d Lin said in her order.\nThe judge said she was open to expanding the class to include recipients of grants from other federal departments and agencies if more researchers join the suit.\nSurveys show that job prospects and future pay are major parts of college decisions for students. New data reveal which majors make the most money as debates over the value of higher education degrees continue.\nReached Tuesday, a spokesperson for the National Science Foundation declined to comment and an EPA spokesperson said the agency was \u201creviewing the decision.\u201d A request to the National Endowment for the Humanities was not returned.\nChemerinsky, who argued the case at a hearing Friday, said in an email that the judge\u2019s order was \u201ca clear and very detailed explanation of why the arbitrary cutoff of funds to researchers in the University of California was unconstitutional and violated federal law.\u201d\nPolsky, the UC Berkeley Environmental Law Clinic director who spearheaded the suit, said she expected lawyers to make filings addressing grant cuts by other agencies in order to expand the class action to a wider group of UC faculty.\n\u201cIt will not be hard for us to do what will be required of us to expand this to many agencies,\u201d Polsky said. \u201cIt will not be difficult for plaintiffs to produce evidence that numerous agencies terminated UC grants on an unlawful basis.\u201d\nThe judge told federal lawyers to submit a report to the court by June 30 \u201cconfirming that all steps to comply with the preliminary injunction have been completed or, in the event that has not occurred, an explanation of why it was not feasible and a description of the steps that have been taken thus far.\u201d\nThe suit is one of dozens filed against the Trump administration over grant terminations \u2014 but one of the few to come directly from researchers.\nThe Trump administration said in court filings and at the hearing that the case was in the wrong venue and should be at the Court of Federal Claims. A Justice Department lawyer, Jason Altabet, said the professors did not having standing to sue because they received the grants via UC, which he said was a \u201cthird party\u201d that passed the funds on to the professors.\nLin did not buy the arguments.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine who would be more affected by the grant terminations than the researchers who applied for the grants and are conducting the research,\u201d she said.\nChemerinsky, who specializes in the 1st Amendment and constitutional law, also argued against the government\u2019s position.\n\u201cThe Supreme Court has always said that an economic standing is sufficient.... The grants functionally are to the researchers,\u201d he said in court Friday.\nIn addition to Chemerinsky and Polsky, the researchers are represented by the San Francisco law firm Lieff Cabraser Heimann and Bernstein as well as Farella Braun and Martel.\nOther challenges to Trump\u2019s funding cuts \u2014 including a multistate suit from California and other blue states opposing grant reductions from the National Institutes of Health \u2014 are ongoing in federal courts.\nUC has joined or filed in support of several other suits protesting Trump cuts, including those addressing National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation and Education Department reductions, but it was not part of the case Lin is overseeing.\n\u201cBy virtue of our groundbreaking research, everyone has benefited from the positive impacts of the federal government\u2019s strong partnership with American universities,\u201d UC Senior Director of Strategic and Critical Communications Rachel Zaentz said in a statement. \u201cThe University of California was not a party to the suit, and we are evaluating the court\u2019s ruling. Separately, the UC system is engaged in numerous legal and advocacy efforts to restore funding to vital research programs across the humanities, social sciences and STEM fields.\u201d"

      "text": "The next \u2018Big One\u2019 on the San Andreas fault might not be the earthquake we expect, researchers say\n- Share via\n- A new report studied a massive earthquake that ruptured in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar on March 28 \u2014 on a fault known for being eerily similar to California\u2019s notorious San Andreas fault.\n- While the recent quake could hold vital clues for California\u2019s next \u201cBig One,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author notes that, \u201cEarthquakes never come back exactly the same way.\u201d\nWhat could the next mega-earthquake on California\u2019s notorious San Andreas fault look like?\nWould it be a repeat of 1857, when an earthquake estimated at magnitude 7.7 to 7.9 ruptured the fault from Monterey County all the way through Los Angeles County? Would it be more akin to the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake, which began just offshore of the city and ruptured in two directions, toward Humboldt County and Santa Cruz County?\nDon\u2019t bet on an identical sequel.\nThat\u2019s the implication of a study published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The report, coauthored by scientists at Caltech in Pasadena, studied a massive earthquake that ruptured in the southeast Asian country of Myanmar on March 28 \u2014 on a fault known for being eerily similar to the San Andreas.\nThe earthquake ended up rupturing a much longer section of the fault than scientists expected, given the seismology of the region.\nThe implications of this study are that \u201cearthquakes never come back exactly the same way,\u201d Solene L. Antoine, a postdoctoral fellow at Caltech and the study\u2019s lead author, said in an interview.\n\u201cIt came as a surprise that you could get such a long rupture,\u201d said Jean-Philippe Avouac, a coauthor of the study and a professor of geology and mechanical and civil engineering at Caltech.\nMarch\u2019s Mandalay earthquake devastated Myanmar, killing at least 3,791 people and an additional 63 people in Thailand. High-rise buildings were damaged as far away as Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam and homes were damaged in the Ruili area of China. Damage was estimated at $1.9 billion, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\nIt was the most powerful earthquake in Myanmar in at least 79 years.\nThe magnitude 7.7 earthquake ruptured an astonishing 317 miles of the Sagaing fault, a finding based on Antoine\u2019s analysis of satellite data showing earth movement after the quake. That\u2019s the longest seismic rupture ever documented on a continent.\nBy comparison, California\u2019s 1906 earthquake ruptured 296 miles of the San Andreas fault; and the 1857 earthquake, 225 miles. Longer seismic ruptures have been found only on subduction megathrusts deep underneath the ocean.\nWhat\u2019s clear from the study is that while California\u2019s next \u201cBig One\u201d may share some characteristics of previously documented devastating quakes, it\u2019s unlikely to be an exact replay. As the recent experience in Myanmar shows, even well-documented faults can behave in surprising ways.\nThe next step is to develop a model simulating earthquakes over many millennia for the San Andreas fault, which the authors plan to do in the future. But the San Andreas fault \u201cis far more complex,\u201d Avouac said. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to come soon, because it\u2019s quite a heavy calculation.\u201d\nStill, such simulations would provide a model of \u201call possible scenarios so that we have a better view of the range of possible ruptures that could happen.\u201d\nFor instance, maybe the San Andreas fault will rupture in smaller, separate earthquakes, Avouac said.\nOr it could be a much larger earthquake \u2014 rupturing the fault not just from Monterey to Los Angeles counties, but perhaps all the way into San Bernardino, Riverside and Imperial counties, which would possibly exceed magnitude 8. Such a quake would be the largest simultaneous disaster in modern California history, with huge swaths of the state wracked by powerful seismic shaking all at once.\nBy comparison, the 1994 Northridge earthquake\u2019s footprint was relatively constrained, severely affecting only a portion of Los Angeles County, especially the San Fernando Valley \u2014 related to its relatively smaller magnitude of 6.7.\nBut while modeling previous activity on the San Andreas fault will provide a glimpse into the wide range of possible outcomes, it will not pinpoint precisely when the next great quake will strike.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just expect the exact same thing to happen,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cIt is a matter of just showing what scenarios are possible, the diversity of scenarios and seeing what are the consequences of each of those scenarios.\u201d\nSometimes, Avouac said, \u201cit\u2019s quiet for a long time, nothing happens ... stress is building up, the fault is locked for a long time, nothing happens, and then, boom, you have a large earthquake.\u201d\n\u201cAnd then you have other periods during which you have a lot of [seismic] activity, but these earthquakes are all smaller,\u201d Avouac said.\nBut \u201csmaller\u201d earthquakes, in the minds of researchers, are still big to the layperson. In the study\u2019s simulations, there are periods where earthquakes around magnitude 7.7 are common. In other periods, earthquakes max out at magnitude 7.5 or so, but are more frequent.\nThe entire length of the Sagaing fault \u2014 including areas that didn\u2019t rupture in the March earthquake \u2014 is 750 miles, north to south, from the Himalayas to the Andaman Sea, and helps accommodate the northward push of the Indian tectonic plate.\nThe fact that 317 miles of the Sagaing fault ruptured in March was surprising to scientists. Only about 170 miles had been quiet seismically for more than a century, having last ruptured in 1839.\nScientists call these \u201cseismic gaps\u201d \u2014 particular areas of a fault that haven\u2019t recently ruptured.\nGenerally, scientists would\u2019ve expected only this long-dormant 170-mile piece of the Sagaing fault to rupture, Avouac said, but not more recently ruptured sections. That includes a 100-mile stretch that ruptured in large earthquakes in 1929 and 1930, and a 50-mile stretch that went off in a pair of quakes in 1946 and 1956.\nInstead, even those fault segments ruptured in the big March earthquake.\nSo what gives?\nA possible explanation is the Sagaing fault\u2019s extraordinary smoothness. \u201cAnd people have observed that when the fault is very smooth, the rupture ... tends to propagate at a velocity\u201d so fast that it results in an \u201cextremely elongated rupture,\u201d Avouac said.\nThe study also published the results of a computer model simulation looking at how earthquakes might rupture along sections of the entire 750-mile long Sagaing fault. The code, developed by study coauthor Kyungjae Im of Caltech, suggests that over a hypothetical 1,400-year period, there would be no repeatable patterns.\nIn other words, earthquakes didn\u2019t seem to re-occur like clockwork, rupturing the same stretch of fault in a repeatable, predictable pattern.\n\u201cThere is complexity here. And this is because each time you have an earthquake, it redistributes the stress on the fault, which is going to influence the next earthquake,\u201d Avouac said. \u201cThere\u2019s a self-induced complexity in the process, and that leads to a bit of randomness.\u201d\nThere is one certainty, which is bound to disappoint anyone who shares the hope that a \u201cBig One\u201d simply won\u2019t ever strike California again.\n\u201cThere will be an earthquake at some point,\u201d Antoine said. \u201cIf there is stress building up on the fault, the fault won\u2019t hold forever.\u201d\nFurther research and observations are essential to refine models of future possible earthquakes, including from the Sentinel satellites, which are operated by the European Space Agency, the authors said.\nThe other coauthors of the study are Rajani Shrestha and Chris Milliner of Caltech; Chris Rollins of Earth Sciences New Zealand; Kang Wang of the Washington-based EarthScope Consortium; and Kejie Chen of the Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, China."

The ruling, which affects a significant portion of the $584 million in federal funding, stems from a class-action lawsuit filed by UC professors challenging the legality of the grant suspensions. The judge emphasized that the government's actions violated her earlier ruling that blocked terminations of science funding, and she has demanded an update from the administration on the restoration of these grants.",
