  "description": "NEW YORK, August 12, 2025--MEDIACO REPORTS SECOND QUARTER NET REVENUE OF $31.2 MILLION AND FIRST HALF OF 2025 NET REVENUE OF $59.3 MILLION",
  "content": "Albert Rodriguez, MediaCo CEO and President, commented, \"We\u2019re proud to report a 19% year-over-year revenue increase this quarter, clear proof that our business is not only strong but gaining real momentum. Even more compelling is the 345% surge in first half digital revenue, which now accounts for 33.0% of our total ad income. This growth is fueled by our deep connection with multicultural audiences and the cultural relevance we deliver across every platform. It\u2019s a powerful validation of our strategy and indicates that MediaCo is leading the charge in today\u2019s digital-first economy.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the \"Definitions and Disclosures Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Information\" section herein, the reconciliations at the end of this press release and additional information on our website.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA. Year-to-date Adjusted EBITDA was $2.9 million, up $7.4 million from the prior year, driven by higher revenue and improved operational management. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved to 5% from a negative margin in the prior-year period. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the \"Definitions and Disclosures Regarding Non- GAAP Financial Information\" section herein, the reconciliations at the end of this press release and additional information on our website.\n\nNet Loss. Year-to-date Net Loss was $17.4 million, an improvement of $34.6 million from the prior year, primarily due to higher revenue and lower corporate costs related to the April 2024 Estrella Acquisition. These gains were partially offset by higher operating, depreciation, and amortization expenses tied to the Estrella Acquisition, along with a prior-year change in fair value of warrant shares liability. Net Loss margin improved to (29)% from (158)% in the prior-year period.\n\nThis quarter delivered record revenue, with P18\u201349 growth in five of the last seven months. EstrellaTV was the only Spanish-language broadcast network to post year-over-year prime-time growth for the full quarter\u2014proof of our consistent performance and enduring audience connection.\"\n\nDebra DeFelice, CFO and Treasurer, commented, \"MediaCo delivered a record second quarter, reflecting continued strength across our portfolio. Growth was driven by increases in radio and TV advertising revenue, record-breaking digital performance, and disciplined expense management. Our successful integration of Estrella Media assets from the most recent acquisition, combined with the progressive realization of synergies across markets and multiple delivery platforms, is fueling strong, sustainable results.\n\nWe remain focused on delivering strong operating performance, enhancing cash flow, and executing on our long-term growth strategy, while advancing our content offerings and accelerating digital expansion. These initiatives position us to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the second half of the year.\"\n\nMediaCo Holding Inc.

Alternatively, Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Net loss, adjusted to exclude Provision for income taxes, Interest expense, net, Depreciation and amortization, Loss on disposal of assets, Change in fair value of warrant shares liability, Other income, and Other adjustments.

This measure is among the primary measures used by management for the planning and forecasting of future periods, as well as for measuring performance for compensation of executives and other members of management. We believe this measure is an important indicator of our operational strength and performance of our business because it provides a link between operational performance and operating income. It is also a primary measure used by management in evaluating companies as potential acquisition targets. We believe the presentation of this measure is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by management. We believe it helps improve investors\u2019 ability to understand our operating performance and makes it easier to compare our results with other companies that have different capital structures or tax rates. In addition, we believe this measure is also among the primary measures used externally by our investors, analysts and peers in our industry for purposes of valuation and comparing our operating performance to other companies in our industry. Since Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating loss or net loss as an indicator of operating performance and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs. Because it excludes certain financial information compared with operating loss and compared with consolidated net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions which are excluded.\n\nFor a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measurements to the GAAP financial results cited in this news announcement, please see the supplemental tables at the end of this release.\n\nMediaCo Holding Inc.
