  "description": "MSNBC host Jonathan Capehart slammed critics of Cracker Barrel's redesigned logo as snowflakes getting bent out of shape over the restaurant chain's minimalist rebrand",
  "content": "MSNBC host Jonathan Capehart almost lost his cool on Saturday when discussing the backlash against Cracker Barrel\u2019s redesigned logo.\n\nDuring an episode of MSNBC\u2019s \"The Weekend,\" Capehart and co-host Eugene Daniels criticized those outraged over the restaurant\u2019s recent logo redesign, arguing that the backlash is a waste of time and another excuse for MAGA supporters to play the victim.\n\n\"There are real things people are concerned about, and they\u2019re losing their minds over a redesign. What the \u2014 See? I\u2019m trying not to curse,\" Capehart told his co-host.\n\nCRACKER BARREL DISMISSES CRITICS AS 'VOCAL MINORITY' WHILE RIVAL RESTAURANT ADDS TO BACKLASH\n\nThe Tennessee-based restaurant chain angered people on social media last week when it revealed its newly redesigned logo that, for many online critics, removed the charm from the original.\n\nThe new logo does away with the illustration of an old man leaning against a barrel while seated in a chair. Instead, the text-only logo uses a new typeface against the familiar gold background.\n\nIn addition to the new logo and a new menu that includes breakfast, lunch and dinner options, the chain has also remodeled the interior of its restaurants, going for a cleaner, more minimalist theme that has done away with some of the country decor that has become synonymous with the brand.\n\nMany people were furious with the redesign. Conservative commentator Benny Johnson posted that the logo change was \"absolutely horrible,\" and asked, \"When will they learn?\"\n\nRight-wing influencer \"End Wokeness\" commented, \"Cracker Barrel CEO Julie Masino should face charges for this crime against humanity.\"\n\nCRACKER BARREL CUSTOMERS 'HATE' RESTAURANT CHAIN'S NEW LOOK IN VIRAL SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEOS\n\nRival franchise Steak 'n Shake called out Cracker Barrel, stating, \"Sometimes, people want to change things just to put their own personality on things. At CB, their goal is to just delete the personality altogether. Hence, the elimination of the \u2018old-timer\u2019 from the signage. Heritage is what got Cracker Barrel this far, and now the CEO wants to just scrape it all away.\"\n\nCapehart voiced his opinion on the logo redesign, calling it fine and saying he\u2019s \"sick\" of the outrage.\n\n\"The logo is fine. Companies go through rebrands all the time. You know what I\u2019m sick of?\"\n\n\"Yeah, manufactured BS, but I\u2019m so sick of the outrage of these snowflakes. There are so many things that offend them, that get them all upset, they\u2019re shooting beer cans and burning hats and stuff like that,\" the co-host replied, referencing conservative-led boycotts, like the one against Bud Light for making a trans person one of the company's spokespeople.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST MEDIA AND CULTURE NEWS\n\nDaniels linked the outrage to MAGA supporters, stating, \"I think the manufactured outrage is also about them pretending to feel attacked. Because when you think about Cracker Barrel, as someone who\u2019s been a lot as a kid in the South, you think about folks in the south. You think about folks who are probably MAGA voters, right? Those two circles are probably very close together.\"\n\nHowever, Trump voters haven\u2019t been the only ones speaking out against Cracker Barrel\u2019s redesign.\n\nThe official X account for the Democratic Party shared a post Thursday that stated, \"We think the Cracker Barrel rebrand sucks too.\"\n\nA representative for Cracker Barrel previously told Fox News Digital in a statement about the new logo that the company's values had not changed.\n\n\"Our values haven't changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven\u2019t changed,\" the company said. \"And Uncle Herschel remains front and center in our restaurants and on our menu. He is the face of \u2018The Herschel Way,\u2019 the foundation of how our 70,000-plus employees provide the country hospitality for which we are known.\n\n\"Cracker Barrel has been a destination for comfort and community for more than half a century, and this fifth evolution of the brand\u2019s logo, which works across digital platforms as well as billboards and roadside signs, is a call-back to the original and rooted even more in the iconic barrel shape and word mark that started it all back in 1969.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

Instead, the text-only logo uses a new typeface against the familiar gold background.\nCRACKER BARREL UNVEILS NEW SIMPLIFIED LOGO: 'OUR STORY HASN'T CHANGED'\nCracker Barrel also rolled out a new menu that includes breakfast, lunch and dinner options and \"refreshed restaurant remodels\" as part of its \"All the More\" campaign, according to a news release.\nAlthough Sarah Moore, Cracker Barrel's chief marketing officer, touted the changes as \"bringing fresh energy, thoughtful craftsmanship and heartfelt hospitality to our guests,\" many people on social media had a far different perspective.\nBenny Johnson, a YouTube content creator and conservative influencer based in Florida, wrote on X that the new logo is \"absolutely horrible.\"\n\"When will they learn?\" he added.\nThe responses were resoundingly negative.\nCRACKER BARREL CUSTOMERS 'HATE' RESTAURANT CHAIN'S NEW LOOK IN VIRAL SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEOS\n\"Not a cracker or a barrel in sight,\" one person wrote.\n\"It's worse than horrible.

      "text": "Anti-woke crusader Robby Starbuck released a devastating video takedown of Cracker Barrel's leadership, making the case that the restaurant's logo and decor change are the culmination of a years-long campaign to cater to the far Left and abandon the values of its middle-America customer base.\nStarbuck, who has brought major companies including John Deere, Target, and Harley-Davidson to heel by exposing their woke policies, described Cracker Barrel\u2019s logo makeover as going from \"old American nostalgia\" to something \"cold, dead, lifeless and modern\" in a 15-minute video. He said that, while the Cracker Barrel brand is often associated with American tradition, the company is \"infested with left-wing activists who are more interested in safe spaces, pronouns and virtue signaling than they are in their customers.\"\nIn his video, Starbuck highlights Cracker Barrel\u2019s support for LGBTQ+ organizations and events, such as Nashville Pride, River City Pride and the Human Rights Campaign (HRC).\nCRACKER BARREL CEO SERVES UP LEFTOVER CORPORATE BRANDING TO UNHAPPY CUSTOMERS\nHe also noted that the company displayed rocking chairs with rainbow colors and LGBTQ+ insignia. The company even went so far as to place one in its Tennessee corporate office. Rocking chairs are practically synonymous with Cracker Barrel, with the restaurant\u2019s long porches lined with them at locations nationwide.\n\"The fact that it's located there is important to this story because what's happened here is a microcosm of the parasitic operating procedure of left-wing activists,\" Starbuck said. \"They don't just wanna force their soulless, godless, hedonistic vision of the future onto blue hellscapes that their party controls.\n\"No, it's much more important to them that they shove it down into your towns, into your kids' schools and into your way of life. So, sticking a pro-trans rocking chair into their headquarters in a predominantly conservative town is exactly the type of thing they revel in doing.\"\nStarbuck then pointed to the company\u2019s involvement with HRC and participation in the Out and Equal Workplace Summit. For the Out and Equal conference, Cracker Barrel made rocking chairs in every color of the rainbow, representing the LGBTQ+ flag. Out and Equal even gave Cracker Barrel an award for having 2018\u2019s top LGBTQ+ Employee Resource Group (ERG).\nCRACKER BARREL DISMISSES CRITICS AS 'VOCAL MINORITY' WHILE RIVAL RESTAURANT ADDS TO BACKLASH\nThe restaurant chain previously participated in HRC\u2019s Corporate Equality Index, which measures \"corporate policies, practices, and benefits pertinent to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer employees,\" according to the organization\u2019s website. A company\u2019s score on the index is determined by how inclusive HRC judged it to be toward LGBTQ+ employees.\nCracker Barrel told Fox News Digital on Friday that it \"has not participated in the Human Rights Campaign Index or had any affiliation with HRC in several years.\"\nTwo Cracker Barrel employees are called out by name in Starbuck\u2019s video, Steve Smotherman and Rachel CampBell.\nSmotherman was the head of management training and development at Cracker Barrel for 15 years, Starbuck asserted, showing a screenshot that appeared to be from LinkedIn. Smotherman, who eventually left Cracker Barrel for Out and Equal, serves on HRC's Business Advisory Council in Washington, D.C.\nDEMOCRATIC PARTY, GAVIN NEWSOM JOIN ONLINE ROASTING OF NEW CRACKER BARREL LOGO\nStarbuck describes Smotherman as \"the archetype activist employee that fueled the rise of DEI in corporate America.\" He also slammed CampBell, a manager of training and development at Cracker Barrel, for publicly expressing excitement over the company\u2019s rainbow pride rocking chairs.\n\"And it\u2019s important to note all of this because these types of employees play a critical role in turning companies away from the values of their customers and moving the companies toward wokeness,\" Starbuck said.\nCRACKER BARREL EXECUTIVE INSISTS RESTAURANT REMODELS ARE 'WHAT THE GUESTS ASKED FOR'\nGilbert D\u00e1vila, a member of Cracker Barrel\u2019s board of directors, was also referenced in Starbuck\u2019s video. D\u00e1vila, who joined Cracker Barrel\u2019s board in 2020, has worked at several major companies, including Disney, Coca-Cola and Procter & Gamble. He\u2019s also the co-CEO of DMI Consulting, which looks to \"infuse cultural relevance and creativity into every solution.\" Starbuck asserted that D\u00e1vila, and others like him are responsible for the \"woke advertising push\" seen over the last few years.\nIn the end, Starbuck emphasizes that the controversy around Cracker Barrel\u2019s logo change is about more than the removal of a man in his chair leaning on a barrel.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"It's very, very important to understand that the Cracker Barrel story is not about a logo. It's not at all about a logo, it is about a country, it is our heritage, and it is a culture. It's about a power structure built to tell us that we are somehow backwards, embarrassing or bigoted,\" Starbuck said.\n\"A conservative can't give their money to Cracker Barrel. A Christian cannot give their money to Cracker Barrel, and so we won't,\" he added.\nAs Starbuck sees it, the Cracker Barrel debacle is a win-win for conservatives, saying that the company will either have to double down and lose customers or revert back to its 1977 logo to retain its customer base.\nFox News Digital\u2019s Brian Flood and Nikolas Lanum contributed to this report.\nCracker Barrel did not respond Fox News Digital's request for comment in time for publication."

  "argos_summary": "Cracker Barrel\u2019s new text\u2011only logo, which drops the iconic man\u2011on\u2011a\u2011barrel image, has sparked a wave of social\u2011media backlash from conservatives and even some liberals, who accuse the chain of abandoning its heritage. MSNBC host Jonathan Capehart dismissed the outrage as a manufactured \u201csnowflake\u201d reaction and linked it to MAGA voters, while the company insists its values and \u201cUncle Herschel\u201d remain unchanged. Rival chains like Steak \u2019n\u202fShake and political figures\u2014including the Democratic Party and California Governor Gavin Newsom\u2014joined the criticism, whereas Cracker Barrel\u2019s marketing team says the redesign reflects customer\u2011driven updates to its menu and interior. The controversy highlights the tension between brand evolution and nostalgic expectations among the chain\u2019s core Southern\u2011American customer base.",
