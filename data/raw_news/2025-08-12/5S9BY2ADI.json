With so many to choose from online, we've narrowed it down to four of the top-rated picks for you. Below, we've compiled a list of our favorite screen protector options based on our historical testing experience with Samsung and third-party brands. And when a phone costs $2000 we think it's worth the extra few bucks to protect it in every way you can. Among the best Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 screen protectors, our top pick is the Spigen tempered glass screen protector, which features durable tempered glass and comes in a two-pack. Milomdoi's screen protector package is a worthy budget option that includes an installation applicator and comes in a two-pack.While the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 \u2014 like its predecessors \u2014 is known for more durable displays than what was around in the early 2000s, it isn't immune to damage. A screen protector \u2014 paired with one of the best Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 cases \u2014 is your best damage-preventing duo to protect your investment in one of 2025's best Android phones for years to come.After all, it is much less of a hassle and far more convenient to replace a cracked screen protector or damaged case \u2014 no lengthy warranty process involved.When looking for a screen protector for your new Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, there are a couple of factors worth considering. You want to ensure that the display's image resolution is not affected while also making sure that an accidental tumble or encounter with pocketed keys doesn't crack the glass.You also want to ensure that the screen protector is made of durable tempered glass. While plastic screen protectors do exist and were quite popular in the 2000s, they do not provide nearly the same level of protection as tempered glass screen protectors. Using a plastic screen protector in 2025 would arguably be like pairing one of the best phones on the market with only a piece of paper for protection.Another screen protector feature that's increasingly popular for security-conscious users is a darker layer or 'privacy' coating. This makes it much harder for snoopers to see what's on your screen, as you'll need to look at it head-on to see it properly. So, if you're on a busy commute regularly, this might be a helpful feature to protect any sensitive information you might have on-screen for personal or professional reasons.While the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Galaxy Z Fold 7 are among the best Samsung phones released to date, their screen protectors aren't cross-compatible due to the vastly different screen sizes and dimensions of both devices. If you have a Galaxy Z Fold 6, you can refer to our compilation of the best Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 screen protectors for further guidance.Follow our WhatsApp and Instagram for more deals and buying guides.",
