Bloomberg TV is live from Sydney with Paul Allen, getting insight and analysis from newsmakers and industry leaders on the biggest stories shaping global markets. (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "[NO AUDIO] THIS IS THE ASIA TRADE, INVESTORS AWAIT CLUES ON A RATE CUT NEXT MONTH AS AUSTRALIA'S RESERVE BANK WILL DELIVER A 25 BASIS POINT REDUCTION TODAY. TRUMP IS OPEN TO NVIDIA SELLING A SCALED DOWN BLACKWELL CHIP AND CHANGING HIS TUNE ON THE INTEL CD SAYING HE HAS AN AMAZING STORY. U.S. MARKETS CLOSED LOWER WITH THIN VOLUMES AS MARKETS AWAIT THE CPI NUMBERS COMING OUT TOMORROW MORNING AND WE EXPECT TO SEE HEADLINE CPI MOVING UP 2% ON THE YEAR. FUTURES LOOK FLAT AHEAD OF THAT. OIL IS MOVING HIGHER WITH DIESEL IN SHORT SUPPLY IN THE U.S. WITH REFINERIES COMING BACK ON THE EVE OF HURRICANE SEASON. CRUDE PRICES ARE UP AS WELL. ON BONDS, BONDS AND DID A THREE DAY LOSING STREAK. INVESTORS HANG BACK AWAITING THE U.S. CPI DATA AND WE HAVE STICKY INFLATION IN THE U.S. WITH LABOR MARKET WEAKENING AS WELL. A FEW NAMES IN TERMS OF WHO WILL REPLACE JAY POWELL AS FED CHAIR, MORE ON THAT IN A MOMENT. THE USD IS STRONGER AS WELL. THE AUSTRALIA OPEN, WE HAVE A RESERVE BANK DECISION AND EARNINGS SEASON UNDERWAY. TOMORROW, THE LARGEST ASX STOCK WILL REPORT. JAPAN RETURNS AFTER A PUBLIC HOLIDAY AND WE ARE WATCHING A VERY BIG MISS REPORTED ON FRIDAY. THE YEN IS 1.4820. TRUMP ANNOUNCED AN EXTENSION TO THE CHINA TRADE TRUCE FOR 90 DAYS AND THE MARKET IS NOT REACTING TO THAT. IT AVERTED THE TARIFF HIKE, NOT HAPPENING NOW AND TRUMP WILL ALLOW NVIDIA TO SELL A SCALED BACK CHIP. MINMIN LOW AND TOM GILES JOINING US. MINMIN, A 90 DAY EXTENSION, WHAT NEXT? MINMIN: YEAH, IT IS ANTICIPATED AND MARKETS BARELY BUDGED AFTER THE STOCKHOLM TALKS, BUT THIS PAVES THE WAY FOR XI TO MEET AT THE AIPAC SUMMIT AND WE MIGHT HEAR MORE AFTER THE POTENTIAL MEETING OF THE TWO LEADERS. CHINA WANT TO REMOVE FENTANYL TARIFFS AND WANTS CHIPS, WHILE U.S. THREATENED SECONDARY TARIFFS FOR RUSSIAN OIL. TRUMP SIGNALED HE MIGHT ALLOW CHINA TO ACCESS THE LATEST NVIDIA CHIPS, HAVE A LISTEN. TRUMP: I DEAL WITH JENSEN AND NVIDIA. THE H20 CHIP IS, UH, IT'S AN OLD CHIP, CHINA ALREADY HAS IT. DIFFERENT FORM AND NAME, BUT THEY HAVE IT. THE BLACKWELL IS ADVANCED, I WOULDN'T MAKE A DEAL, BUT I MIGHT WITH A NEGATIVELY ENHANCED BALCKWELL. NOBODY HAS IT, THEY WON'T HAVE IT FOR FIVE YEARS AND THE H20 IS OBSELETE. PAUL: A SCALED BACK CHIP, WOULD CHINA WANT IT? THEY ARE UNSURE ABOUT THE SECURITY OF THE NVIDIA CHIPS NOW? MINMIN: CHINA CAN ONLY ACCESS H20 AND NVIDIA SAID THIS CANNOT BE SCALED BACK. CHINA IS NOT HOT ON H20 CHIPS BECAUSE CHINA HAS CHIPS WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF IMPACT BY COMBINING CHIPS TOGETHER. CHINA WANTS TO KNOW THE NVIDIA CHIPS WILL NOT CONTAIN A BACKDOOR TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, BUT THE ADVANCE CHIPS COULD INTEREST CHINA. SECURITY RISKS ARE THERE FOR BOTH SIDES. PAUL: YEAH, WANT TO GET MORE WITH TOM GILES. THE SECURITY RISKS, WHAT ARE THEY FOR THE U.S.? ARE EXPORT CONTROLS UP FOR NEGOTIATION? TOM: FOR THE RIGHT PRICE, BUT WITH CHIPS, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS PUT STRICT LIMITS ON WHAT KIND CAN BE SOLD TO CHINA AND AS TRUMP SAID, SCALED BACK VERSION S -- HE WOULD CUT A DEAL WITH NVIDIA LIKE THE ONE WITH AMD. HE WOULD MAKE CONCESSIONS, THE ARGUMENT BEING THAT THESE DON'T HAVE THE SAME IMPLICATIONS AS THE MOST ADVANCED CHIPS AND THIS IS RECOGNITION OF THE CHINESE MARKET AND CHINESE CUSTOMERS WANTING AMD AND NVIDIA CHIPS, WITHIN REASON. CHINESE CHIP MAKERS ARE CATCHIG NG UP AND THE U.S. NEEDS TO STAY AHEAD OF COMPANIES LIKE SMIC AND SELL INTO CHINA. THEY WILL MAKE CONCESSIONS OF 15% TO DO THAT. PAUL: WE HAD THE PRESIDENT MEETING THE INTEL CEO AND SAYING HE HAS AN AMAZING STORY. WILL THIS SAVE HIS JOB? TOM: HE NEEDED TO KISS THE RING AND SHOW WILLINGNESS TO PAY HOMAGE TO TRUMP, SHOW UP AND TELL YOUR STORY, EXPLAIN YOUR PAST. THE CEO HAS BEEN ON THE BOARD OF A LOT OF COMPANIES AND GOT INTO HOT WATER WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, WHICH RAISED CONCERNS THAT HE MAY NOT BE DEVOTED TO THE U.S. THE CEO WANTED TO SHOW TRUMP HE WAS HERE TO DO BUSINESS AND WANTS CHIPS MADE IN THE U.S. INTEL HAS STRUGGLED AND FALLEN BEHIND OTHER COMPANIES, SO HE HAS A BIG JOB AND CANNOT AFFORD THE PRESIDENT CALLING FOR HIS RESIGNATION. PAUL: WE HAVE TRUMP CALLING FOR THE RESIGNATION OF A TECH COMPANY BUT IT IS OK TO SELL CHIPS TO CHINA IF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT GETS A CUT. ARE THERE CONCERNS ABOUT POLITICAL OVERREACH? TOM: THERE IS CONCERN AS THEIR WILL BE. WE CAN FOR THE RIGHT PRICE TO MAKE CONCESSIONS WHICH SENDS MIXED SIGNALS AND COMPLICATES EFFORTS TO GET ALLIES ON BOARD. IF YOU ARE A U.S. CORPORATION HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO INTERFERE WITH BUSINESS? INTERESTS MAY ALLIGN OR YOU MAY BE ASKED TO COMPROMISE AND REMOVE AN OFFICIAL OR ANTE UP YOUR SALES. WHAT DOES THAT DO TO MARGINS AND WHEN DO INVESTORS LOSE PATIENCE WITH THIS DEAL MAKING? PAUL: ALRIGHT, MINMIN LOW AND TOM GILES THERE. TRUMP IS SAID TO HAVE XPANDED ITS LIKE OF FED CHAIRS. PHILIP JEFFERSON AND MICHELLE BOWMAN ARE BEING CONSIDERED AND DEREK JOINS US NOW. WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD ANY OF THEM WOULD DO TRUMP'S BIDDING ANYWAY? THE LIST OF FINALISTS IS EXPANDING. THE TREASURY SECRETARY IS A KEY PERSON INVOLVED BUT IT WILL BE TRUMP'S DECISION. THIS COULD FEATURE 6-10 PEOPLE AND THE THINKING IN D.C. CENTERS AROUND HASSETT, WARSH AND WALLER. THE LIST WILL CONTRACT. TRUMP HAD A TIME WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN NAMING SOMEONE TO GO THROUGH AND SAY THIS IS WHO I WANT TO GO FOR, BUT HE SAID NOPE, LET ME DO A TEMPORARY PICK TO BUY EXTRA TIME, SO TRUMP IS NOT UNDER THE GUN AND CAN TAKE MONTHS TO CHOOSE. WHAT WILL THIS PERSON DO AND WHO WILL ACHIEVE THE OUTCOME THAT TRUMP WANTS OF LOWERING RATES? HE IS CRITICAL OF THE FED FOR NOT LOWERING RATES, SO WHO WILL BE HIS VESSEL AND WHAT DOES TRUMP WANT THEM TO DO? THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT. PAUL: ON CIVIL SERVANTS, THERE IS A NEW HEAD OF THE BUREAU OF STATISTICE, EJ, AFTER TRUMP DIDN'T LIKE THE DATA. ARE WE HEADING DOWN AN INTERESTING ROAD HERE? THIS AGENCY IS BORING, IT IS ONE THAT IS DRAMA FREE AND SORT OF POPS UP TO PUT OUT REPORTS, THEN POPS DOWN TO WORK AND SO ON. THE BLS HAS NEVER HAD A PERIOD LIKE THIS. NOW TRUMP HAS NAMED EJ ANTONI FROM THE HERITAGE FOUNDATION. EJ WENT ON STEVE BANNON'S PODCAST AND SAID THERE WAS NOT A MAGA PERSON ON TOP AT BLS AND HE SAID NO. TRUMP SAID EJ WILL ENSURE THE NUMBERS ARE HONEST AND ACCURATE IN ALL CAPS. IF YOU DISCUSS BLS MEMBERS YOU GET INTO THINGS QUICKLY BECAUSE THIS IS JOBS, INFLATION AND BIG ECONOMIC PRINTS. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF QUESTIONS ABOUT REVISIONS, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IN AN AGE WHERE FEWER PEOPLE WANT TO BE INTERVIEWED WHAT THE DATA IS. THIS IS NOT ONLY A U.S. PROBLEM BUT THE SITUATION HERE HAS BOILED OVER. THE BLS NUMBERS NEED TO BE INSURED TO BE ACCURATE. PAUL: LET'S NOT FORGET A STRONG JOBS MARKET SUGGESTS THE FED DOES NOT NEED TO EASE. DEREK WALLBANK THERE. STILL TO COME, ASIA SOCIETY POLICY INSTITUTE WEIGHS IN ON THE U.S. AND CHINA TARIFF EXTENSION, UBP FAVORS TECH STOCKS AND A CLOSER LOOK AT AUSTRALIA'S EARNINGS SEASON WITH JP MORGAN. TRUMP DOWNPLAYS EXPECTATIONS FOR A SUMMIT WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN, SAYING IT IS NOT UP TO HIM TO DELIVER A TRUCE, DETAILS NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a THIS IS REALLY A FEEL-OUT MEETING AND PUTIN WANTS TO GET IT OVER WITH. I'VE SAID THAT A FEW TIMES. PAUL: TRUMP DOWNPLAYING EXPECTATIONS AS HE SEEKS TO END THE WAR IN UKRAINE. MIKE HEATH, WHAT IS A REALISTIC EXPECTATION FOR OUTCOMES? MICHAEL: PUTIN HOLDS THE CARDS AND THERE ARE TWO SCENARIOS. PUTIN STICKS TO HIS DEMANDS AND TRUMP SAYS GOOD LUCK AND THINGS CONTINUE AS THEY WERE BEFORE. OR PUTIN COMES UP WITH A DEAL WHERE UKRAINE DOES NOT HAND OVER MORE LAND. THERE ARE REPORTS UKRAINE WOULD CEDE LAND UNDER RUSSIAN CONTROL. PAUL: DOES THAT LOOK LIKE A WIN FOR PUTIN, THAT WOULD MEAN HE HOLDS 1/5 OF UKRAINE. WHO'S TO SAY THERE WON'T B A THIRD ATTEMPT? MIKE: VANCE SAID NO ONE WILL BE HAPPY, BUT RUSSIA WILL GET LAND THAT IT MORALLY SHOULD NOT. THEY ARE A MILITARY MACHINE AND UKRAINE NEEDS SECURITY, BUT TRUMP SAID THEY WILL NOT EVER JOIN NATO. SO YEAH, AGGRESSION WORKS AND THROUGH HISTORY, IT HAS SHOWN THAT AND PUTIN BELIEVED THE WEST WOULD CAVE IN. PAUL: IN GAZA, NORWAY'S WEALTH FUND IS DIVESTING OF ISRAEL. MIKE: IT WON'T BE HUGE FOR ISRAEL. THE FUND HAD SAID THERE ARE ELEVEN FIRMS RELATED TO THE HUMANITARIAN DISASTER AND THIS IS GRIST FOR THE MILL, WITH THE PRESSURE THAT IS BUILDING. PEOPLE ARE REFUSING TO SELL WEAPONS TO ISRAEL, BUT ISRAEL HAS THE U.S. BEHIND IT AND IS CONFIDENT. PAUL: MORE AHEAD, THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a LET'S GET THE LATEST. AN EXPLOSION IN PA KILLED ONE PERSON AND INVOLVES COKE FOR BATTERIES AND THE PLANT IS WORKING TO INVESTIGATE, BUT THEY HAVE A HISTORY OF ACCIDENTS. PARAMOUNT WILL SHOW ALL UFC EVENTS, BOLSTERING THE SERVICE. UFC OWNER TKO JUMPED 10%. MORE AHEAD ON THE ASIA UFC OWNER TKO JUMPED 10%. MORE AHEAD ON THE ASIA PAUL: 30 MINUTES FROM THE AUSSIE OPEN. FUTURES ARE SOFTER AFTER THE ASX HIT A RECORD YESTERDAY AND LITHIUM MINERS ARE HAVING A GOOD DAY. NIKKEI FUTURES ARE OFF AS THE EBD FUTURES ARE FLAT. WE SAW TRUMP EXTEND A POT OF TARIFFS STABILIZING TRADE TIES. LET'S BRING IN THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE ASIA SOCIETY POLICY INSTITUTE. WE NEED, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US AND I WANT TO START WITH THE TRUCE EXTENSION. WE ALL EXPECTED IT AND OTHER TRADE DEALS WERE CONCLUDED QUICKLY SO WHAT IS THE PACE TELLING YOU? WENDY: NOT A LOT OF TIME FOR NEGOTIATIONS TO PROCEED SO IT IS IMPORTANT BOTH SIDES AGREED TO A TARIFF ROLL OVER SO THEY CAN FOCUS ON EXPORT CONTROLS, MINERALS, EXCESS CAPACITY. THERE ISN'T A LOT OF TIME TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS. PAUL: TRUMP IS LOOKING AT ALLOWING NVIDIA TO SELL SCALED BACK CHIPS TO CHINA, WHAT DOES THAT TELL YOU ABOUT SECURITY AND IS THAT ON THE TABLE? WENDY: TRADING WITH CHINA, WE ARE NOT NEGOTIATING FOR EXPORT CONTROLS, BUT TRUMP OPENED THE DOOR AND CHINA WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE AND TOP OF THE LIST IS A STAND STILL ON CONTROLS TO MAKE THE TALKS HARDER. PAUL: WHAT RISKS DOES THIS OPEN UP? WENDY: THE U.S. WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO SELL CHINA THE CHIPS THEY NEED OR DOUBLE DOWN AND SAY WE WILL NOT SUPPLY THESE CHIPS OR OTHER GOODS, SO IT WILL BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE I DON'T THINK EVERYONE IS ON THE SAME PAGE AS TRUMP. PAUL: CHINA HOLDS MORE CARDS WITH THE U.S. ON RARE EARTHS, SO HOW WILL THEY USE THIS TO INFORM A DEAL? WENDY: CHINA IS STRONGER THAN DURING TRUMP 1.0 AND THEY ARE USING LEVERAGE ON CRITICAL MINERALS AND MAGNETS TO ACHIEVE A MORE BALANCED DEAL AS LEVERAGE IF THEY DON'T LIKE THE U.S. OFFER. PAUL: WILL ANYTHING NEW GET PUT ON THE TABLE DURING THE NEXT 90 DAYS? WENDY: LOTS OF ISSUES, BUT THERE ISN'T MUCH TIME, SO EVEN A LIMITED DEAL WOULD CREATE A PROCESS TO ADDRESS THE OTHER ISSUES. PAUL: YEAH, IN OTHER ISSUES, CHINA AND INDIA BUY RUSSIAN OIL, BUT CHINA IS NOT FACING PRESSURE FROM THE U.S., WHAT'S GOING ON? THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN VERY FIRM WITH INDIA AND INDIA IS SAYING WHY US? WHY NOT CHINA? SO TRUMP COULD PRESS CHINA, BUT WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT OR TARIFFS. PAUL: TRUMP IS SUPPOSED TO VISIT BEIJING WITHIN THE NEXT 90 DAYS, SO WILL THE WHITE HOUSE ANNOUNCE SOMETHING BY THEN AND WHAT? WENDY: I DON'T SEE THE MEETING TAKING PLACE WITHOUT A TRADE AGREEMENT, EVEN FOCUSED ON MEGA PURCHASES BY CHINA, BUT PEOPLE WILL BE SKEPTICAL BECAUSE DURING TRUMP 1.0, CHINA DID NOT FOLLOW THROUGH WITH THEIR PLEDGES. PAUL: THE U.S. WANTS CHINA TO BUY 4X THE SOY BEANS, IS THAT REALISTIC? WENDY: I DON'T THINK IT IS ON THE TOP OF THE SHOPPING LIST TO GIVE TO CHINA. TRUMP NEEDS TO SHOW FARMERS HE IS FIGHTING FOR THEM, BUT WE ARE NOT CHINA'S LARGEST SOYEAN PROVIDER, THEY RELY ON BRAZIL, SO THIS WILL BE HARD AFTER THEY LEARNED LESSONS DURING PHASE ONE TALKS. PAUL: CHINA IS ON A CHARM OFFENSIVE WITH ALBANESE ON A LONG, SIX DAY VISIT, SO HOW WILL CHINA BUILD RELATIONS TO DEPEND LESS ON THE U.S. TRADE? TRADE PARTNERS ARE REDUCING DEPENDANCE AND CHINA'S DOORS ARE OPEN. BUT CHINA DUMPS EXCESS CAPACITY AROUND ASIA AND THE EU, WE'VE SEEN THAT SPIKE, SO THESE COUNTRIES ARE WARY OF CHINA. PAUL: WENDY, THANKS FOR YOUR INSIGHT. LET'S LOOK AT KEY COMMODITIES WITH NORMALITY RETURNING TO GOLD AS TRUMP SAYS \" GOLD WILL NOT BE TARIFFED!\" THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION ABOUT THAT AND NOW WE ARE BACK TO WHERE WE WERE ONE WEEK AGO. WE DISCUSSED SOYBEAN SALES WITH THE U.S. DEMANDING FOUR TIMES MORE SOYBEANS TO BE PURCHASED BY CHINA. CHINA'S POLLUTION ISSUES ARE SUPPORTING IRON ORE AND LITHIUM IS STRONG. IN THE TOP THREE ON THE ASX AFTER THE CATL MINE WAS SUSPENDED, SO WE WILL SEE IF LITHIUM STOCKS HOLD UP TODAY. FOR MORE, LET'S GET TO EDITOR ANDREW. I WANT TO START WITH THE GOLD DRAMA, IS GOLD NOT SUBJECT TO TARIFFS? ANDREW: SANITY HAS PREVAILED AND THIS WAS SPARKED BY A REPORT BASED ON THE LETTER FROM THE U.S. TO SWISS REFINERS. GOLD IS A CURRENCY AND BARS MOVE AROUNF -- AROUND THE WORLD, SO THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN TARIFFS ON WHAT IS ALMOST A CURRENCY AND WE SAW THE GOLD PRICE SHOOT UP ON FRIDAY. THIS WOULD CAUSE DISLOCATIONS AND GUM UP THE MARKET, BUT TRUMP SAID IT WON'T HAPPEN AND WE HAVE NO DETAILS. PAUL: WE WILL WAIT FOR MORE, BUT ON IRON ORE, IT IS SHOWING RESILIENCE CONSIDERING CHINA'S ECONOMIC OUTLOOK WITH MILLS CLOSING, SO HOW SUSTAINABLE IS IT? THIS IS IN A MAJOR STEEL MAKING HUB NEAR BEIJING AND THEY ARE SUSPENDING ACTIVITY FOR TH BIG PARADE. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL TO DO THIS AND IT CAUSES A SHORT TERM BUMP. THE BIG QUESTION IS STEEL MILLS CAUGHT UP IN EFFORTS TO TACKLE OVER CAPACITY, THEY HAVE MOVED IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS TO DO THAT AFTER PRODUCING WAY TO MUCH STEEL. THE GOVERNMENT WILL AFFECT THE MARKETS AND IF YOU MAKE LESS STEEL, YOU NEED LESS IRON ORE, SO PRICES COULD DROP OR THE SECOTR COULD PUSH THEM UP. PAUL: SIMILAR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE LITHIUM RALLY YESTERDAY, OFF THE BACK OF THE SUSPENSION, SO CAN THE GAINS BE HELD ONTO? ANDREW: UH, WELL, THIS IS PART OF CHINA'S EFFORT TO TACKLE OVER-CAPACITY, ANTI-INVOLUTION. SO CATL STOPPED PRODUCTION AT A MINE THAT ACCOUNTS FOR 5% OF GLOBAL SUPPLY, SO THIS IS AUTHORITIES TACKLING A BIG GLUT. THERE ARE OTHER MINES THAT ACCOUNT FOR 5% OF PRODUCTION, SO IF THEY ARE ABLE TO KEEP PRODUCING, THOSE ARE THE BIG QUESTIONS. WE SAW DRAMATIC RISES AND CHINA IS SERIOUS ABOUT THE LITHIUM GLUT IN THE CONTEXT OF THE BIG DRIVE TO REIGN IN OVER-CAPACITY. PAUL: ALRIGHT, ANDREW JAMES THERE. TRUMP ANNOUNCED A FEDERAL TAKEOVER OF THE D.C. POLICE AND IS THREATENING TO SNED -- SEND FEDERAL PERSONNEL TO NEW YORK AND CHICAGO IF POLICE FAIL TO CURB CRIME. WE ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS. OUR FAMILIES GO TO WAR, WE PAY TAXES AND UPHOLD RESPONSIBILITIES OF CITIZENSHIP. WHILE THIS ACTION IS UNSETTLING AND UNPRECEDENTED, GIVEN THE RHETORIC OF THE PATH I CANNOT SAY WE ARE SURPRISED. PAUL: TWO CHINESE SHIPS COLLIDED DIN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA AND THE PHILIPPINE COAST GUARD SHOWED A CHINESE VESSEL HITTING A CHINESE NAVY SHIP IN THE PHILIPPINES SAY THE CHINESE SHIP SUFFERED DAMAGE. STILL TO COME, EXPECTED THIRD CUT FROM THE RBA, WE DISCUSSED THE DECISION NEXT. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a OK, ABOUT 12 MINUTES FROM THE OPEN IN AUSTRALIA WITH THE AUSSIE DOLLAR ABOVE $.65 AND FUTURES POINT LOWER. LOTS OF EARNINGS TODAY WITH A NUMBER OF STOCKS AND THEN TOMORROW COMMONWEALTH BANK IS THE LARGEST ASX STOCK AND WE WILL HEAR FROM AGL. THE FOCUS WILL BE ON THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA WITH EASING MAKING IT THE THIRD CUT AND 36 ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE CUT TODAY AS DATA INDICATES MORE SLACK THAN PROJECTED IN MAY AND BLOOMBERG'S JAMES MCINTYRE JOINS US. THE MARKET WAS SURPRISE WE DID NOT RECEIVE A CUT. WHAT IS LEADING YOU TO EXPECT THE RBA WILL USE? JAMES: WE DID NOT THINK THEY WOULD CUT LAST TIME AND THEY ARE DELIVERING GRADUAL, DATA DEPENDENT EASING. THERE IS NO BURNING PLATFORM IN WHICH THEY HAD TO CUT AND AUGUST WILL BE THE BIG FORECAST REVIEW WITH INFLATION IN LINE, BUT WHAT CHANGED IS THE LABOR MARKET. UNEMPLOYMENT IS HIGHER THAN PROJECTIONS IN THE INFORMATION THEY RELY ON, IT GOT REVISED. BIT LOOSE ON LABOR MARKET. WITH INFLATION THAT IS ENOUGH TO GET A DOSE OF EASING. PAUL: JOBS, INFLATION, THESE ARE THE KEY THINGS BUT HOW ABOUT TARIFFS? JAMES: TARIFFS ARE NOT A HUGE DIRECT IMPACT BUT THE INDIRECT IMPACT AND SHOCK TO THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IS SOMETHING THE RBA WILL FOCUS ON. THERE IS A BIG TRANSITION IN THE ECONOMY FROM PUBLIC SECTOR GROWTH AND IF CONSUMERS DON'T OPEN THEIR WALLETS, IF THEY SAID ON THEIR HANDS WE WILL NOT GET RECOVERY. THEY MIGHT HAVE TO PROMPT CONSUMERS LATER THIS YEAR OR NEXT YEAR. PAUL: WE GET A NEW SET OF FORECAST TODAY, HOW WILL THAT BE REFLECTED IN THE PATH AHEAD? JAMES: THE RBA COMMENTARY WILL STAY WITH A HAWKISH CUT AND GRADUAL EASING TO EXTEND THEIR FORECAST PROFILE BY ANOTHER SIX MONTHS AND UNEMPLOYMENT BEING HIGHER MEANS DOWNWARD PRESSURE MAYBE ON INFLATION AT THE ENDING OF THE PROFILE TO DRAG THEM OVER THE LINE TO CUT, NO BIG, CLEAR GUIDANCE FOR THE NEXT MEETING BUT THE MEETING AFTER THAT, THE NOVEMBER CUT IS MORE LIKELY. PAUL: JAMES MCINTYRE THERE AND SUBSCRIBERS CAN TURN TO THE TERMINAL FOR MORE. PLUS COMMENTARY AND ANALYSIS FROM EXPERT EDITORS. MORE AHEAD ON THE ASIA TRADE, THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a PAUL: TIME TO LOOK AT ANALYST CALLS WITH THE BANK OF AMERICA SURVEY SHOWING FUND MANAGERS THINK OF U.S. STOCKS AS TOO EXPENSIVE. 91% INDICATED U.S. EQUITIES ARE OVERVALUED AND MICHAEL HARTMAN SAYS INVESTORS SEEK -- SEE A MODEST PROBABILITY OF A HARD LANDING. GOLDMAN SAID U.S. COMPANIES TOOK THE BRUNT OF THE HIT FROM TARIFFS BUT THAT WILL CHANGE. CONSUMERS WILL ABSORB 67% OF TARIFF COSTS AND THE RESULT WILL BE FAST INFLATION. LET'S CHECK ONE STOCK WE WILL WATCH WHEN TRADE OPENS SHORTLY, KEEPING OUR EYES ON THIS ONE WHO REPORTED NUMBERS ON FRIDAY AFTER THE CLOSE, A BIG MISS ON SECOND QUARTER OPERATING INCOME, NET LOSS OF 50 BILLION YEN, BIGGER THAN THE EXPECTATION OF \u00a520 BILLION IS ONE BRIGHT SPOT, THE BANK IS UP 54% ON THE YEAR WITH NO DIVIDEND. KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT WHEN WE GET GOING. JAPANESE ASSETS, NIKKEI FUTURES ARE FLIPPING POSITIVE BY 1% AND JAPAN RETURNS AFTER THE PUBLIC HOLIDAY ON MONDAY. THE YEN LOOKS PRETTY WEAK. THE MARKET OPENS OUR NEXT, THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a PAUL: THIS IS \"THE ASIA TRADE.\" WE DID HAVE UPSIDE AHEAD OF THE OPEN. WE HAD FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE MOST WIDELY ANTICIPATED, THE U.S. AND CHINA EXTENDING THE TREE TRUTH A FURTHER 90 AND DURING THAT PERIOD, PRESIDENT TRUMP MADE VISIT BEIJING. -- THE TRADE TRUTH A FURTHER 90 DAYS AND DURING THAT PERIOD, PRESIDENT TRUMP MAY VISIT BEIJING. WE ARE COUNTING DOWN TO THE CRITICAL CB -- PI DATA FOR THE MONTH OF JULY IN THE U.S. AND WE ARE EXPECTING A SLIGHT PICKUP. THE MARKET OPEN WE ARE SEEING SOME FOR THE NIKKEI JAPAN RETURNING AFTER THE PUBLIC HOLIDAY ON MONDAY. ONE STOCK WE ARE FOCUSING ON THEIR IS BRACKET ATTEND GROUP. UP PERCENT DESPITE REPORTING FROM UNDERWHELMING END OF THE WEEKEND. -- UP PERCENT DESPITE REPORTING OF UNDER WYOMING -- THANKS A THE YEN. SOFT PERHAPS THAT IS A FACTOR OF SOME THE GAIN WE SAW IN THE U.S. DOLLAR. SWITCHING OVER TO KOREA LOOK AT HOW THE KOSPI IS TRACKING WE HAVE MODEST GAIN THERE AS WELL. UP BY POINT -- .1%. LOOK AT THE A SX HAVE THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA WIDELY EXPECTED TO CUT I THINK IT IS 100% OF THOSE SURVEYED ANY FIVE BASIS POINTS WORTH OF TODAY. ALSO THE KICKOFF OF EARNINGS THAN IN AUSTRALIA. AT THE MOMENT, STAGGERED OPEN AND WE OF SOFTNESS ON THE A SX BUT WE WILL CHECK IT LATER. WE WANT TO GET IS A BREAKING IS OUT OF SINGAPORE. FINAL G FOR THE SECOND QUARTER IN AS EXPECTED. RISING 4.4%. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE MARKET WAS ANTICIPATING THE TOP THREE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTORS TO GROWTH IN THE QUARTER, WHOLESALE TRADE, MANUFACTURING, FINANCE SERVICES PRODUCING 4.3%. WHEN IT COMES TO SINGAPORE BID UP FRONT LOADING GOING ON IN OF ACCELERATING EXPORTS BEFORE ITERIS HIT AND WE ARE SEEING AN EXTENSION OF THAT THREAD -- TREND. WE ARE GETTING A LITTLE BIT OF NEWS I MENTIONED THE TARIFF THE U.S. ANNOUNCED AND CHINA SAYS IT HAS AGREED THE U.S. EXTEND THE TARIFF TRUCE LET'S GET TO OUR NEXT GUEST U.S. STOCKS WE ARE JOINED BY KIERAN CALDER. WE ARE SEEING A LITTLE BIT OF ACTION IN TERMS OF U.S. TAKE IN THE LAST FEW DAYS PRESIDENT TRUMP APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE INTEL YELLOW AND THEN APPEARING TO BACK OFF AND REVENUE SHARING AMD AND NVIDIA WHEN IT COMES TO EXPORTING CHIPS TO CHINA. POLITICAL INVOLVEMENT WITH TECH COMPANIES DOES IT MAKE YOU NERVOUS? KIERAN: I THINK IT IS OBVIOUSLY NOT THE BASE CASE WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE BUT IT IS THE NEW REALITY UNDER THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WHERE PRESIDENT TRUMP TYPICALLY WANTS TO GET INVOLVED IN THE REVENUE SHARING ON CHINA BUSINESS FOR NVIDIA AND AMD IS INTERESTING. FOR THE COMPANY THEMSELVES, I GUESS IT IS BETTER TO HAVE 85% OF THE REVENUE WILL MARKET TO HUAWEI. IT IS A LITTLE BIT OF PRAGMATISM ON THEIR PART. FOR US THAT WE LIKE U.S. YOU BACK UP AT THIS STAGE IN THE CYCLE, WE RECOMMEND A FULL ALLOCATION MOBILE EQUITIES. WE HAVE A BIAS SECTORS WITH VISIBILITY WHICH LEAVES US IN U.S. TECH AND AGILITY -- AND UTLIITIES WE ALSO THINK GIVEN THE MACRO UNCERTAINTY IT IS A STOCK PICKERS MARKET AND THERE ARE SEVERIN -- SEVERAL INDUSTRIES WANT TO FOCUS ON. PAUL: THERE ARE ALWAYS ACTIONS ON ULULATIONS THAT WE ARE SEEING IN THE TECH SECTOR. NOW LOOKING FAIRLY RICH. DOES THAT GIVE YOU ANY LAWS WHEN IT COMES TO ADDING TO YOUR ALLOCATE -- ANY PAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO ADDING TO YOUR ALLOCATIONS? KIERAN: IT IS THE MAIN FACTOR THAT GOES IN A SOFT ACTION AFTER HIT OR MISS WE ARE COST THE RUN-UP SINCE LIBERATION DAY IS PROBABLY A NOT AGGRESSIVELY ADDING YOU HAVE AN OVERWEIGHT WE ARE KEEPING TECH AND YOU -- AND UTI LITIES. PAUL: JAPAN'S INDEX EDGING UP WITH THE TOPIX. -- NIKEI INDEX THING UP WITH TOPIX. YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE LEADERS OUT OF THAT FIRST HAND, ENDO -- TENDO AND SONY AND EVEN SOFTBANK WHERE SENTIMENT HAS A NARROWING OF THE DISCOUNT ON THE STORY HAS BECOME ABOUT AI HERE TODAY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FLIP THE SCRIPT HIGHLIGHTS -- IS NOT THE MARKET IT IS STOCK PACIFIC AND SECTOR SPECIFIC WHICH ARE LEADING -- STOCK SPECIFIC AND SECTOR SPECIFIC. PAUL: THAT IS ONE SECTOR THAT YOU ARE CAUTIOUS ON. HOW MUCH YOU HAVE THAT THE TARIFF RISK MIGHT BE RE CEDING? WE HAVE PASSED TARIFF UNCERTAINTY. WE THINK THE MARKET HAS GOTTEN A LOT MORE USE TO THE PATTERN OF PRESIDENT TRUMP PUTTING UP A LARGE NUMBER AND THEN NEGOTIATING DOWN. ALSO, THE PAUSE IN THE CASE OF CHINA, THAT IS PART OF THE STRATEGY. WE HAVE PASSED UNCERTAINTY REGARDING TARIFFS. WE WOULD EXPECT A BIG DEAL TO BE DONE RELATED TO CHINA. SHORTLY BEFORE OCTOBER. IT MEETS EVERYBODY'S POLITICAL CALENDAR. AND THEN WE WILL -- AND THAT WILL BE MOST OF THE GLOBAL TRADE WRAPPED UP IN TERMS OF TARA. THAT IN TERMS OF TARA. CANADA HAS BEEN LEFT OUT. BUT IT IS COVERED IN NAFTA. THINK THE MARKET -- WE THINK THE MARKET IS RESIGNED TO TARIFFS AHEAD AND WE HAVE SETTLED MOST OF THEM. PAUL: I JUST WANT TO LOOK AHEAD TO AN IMPORTANT PIECE OF DATA WE WILL GET IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS AND THAT IS THE U.S. PI NUMBERS FOR JULY. THERE IS A LOT OF VARIANCE IN TERMS OF EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHETHER WE HAVE SEEN TARIFF THROUGH YOU AND IF WE HAVE, HOW ENDURING WILL IT BE VERY HOW ARE YOU WEIGHING THE POSSIBILITIES AROUND U.S. INFLATION? KIERAN: WE ARE OBVIOUSLY VERY CONCERNED. WE DON'T THINK THE TARIFF HAS HIT. THAT WILL BE A SECOND HALF OF THE STORY. YOU LOOK AT THE JOBS DATA AND THE BIG REVISIONS THAT CAME RECENTLY. THE INFLATION DATA AND WILL THAT TAKE UP AGAIN. THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT IN TERMS OF BOTH OF THOSE READINGS AND YOU HAVE THE NEW OR HARDER PRESSURE ON THE FED TO POSSIBLY CUT. AS EARLY AS NEXT MONTH. THINK THERE IS PROBABLY A WINDOW TO CUT AHEAD OF SOME OF THE DATA LOOKING REALLY BAD IF THE -- IF THAT IS WHAT THE FED WANTS TO DO. INFLATION PRINT TOMORROW WILL BE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. IN ANY CASE WE WOULD EXPECT A 25 BASIS POINT CUT IN SEPTEMBER AND CERTAINLY OCTOBER IF NOT SEPTEMBER. PAUL: WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST A WEAKER DOLLAR AS WELL. FEEL THE PATH OF RINGBACK IS DOWN -- FEEL THE PATH OF THE GREENBACK IS DOWN? AND A LOT OF STRENGTH IN CURRENT TO THE WORLD. THE SINGAPORE DOLLAR YOU JUST MENTIONED THE SECOND QUARTER AS EXPECTED. PART OUT OF THAT -- NOT IMPORTANT PART , SMALL OPEN ECONOMIES ARE YOU BE WELL ACTUALLY. PAUL: THANK YOU'S MUCH FOR JOINING US TO HAVE MORE AHEAD ON THE ASIAN TRADE THIS IS BLOOMBERG. PAUL: ERIC CHINA. ALL OTHER ELEMENTS HE ALSO SIGNALED WILL BOWING AND VIDEO TO SELL CHINA A SCALED-BACK VERSION OF ITS MOST ADVANCED AI CHIP. LET'S GET MORE ON ALL OF THIS WITH OUR CHINA CORRESPONDENT, MINMIN LOW. I WANT TO START WITH THE EXTENSION TO TRADE NEGOTIATE. I THINK EVERYONE'S ALL THAT ONE COMING, RIGHT? WHAT IS NEXT? IT IS HIGHLY ANTICIPATED OF HOW COORDINATED THE MESSAGING HAD BEEN. CHINA AND THE U.S. THEIR VERSION OF THE STATEMENT AROUND 8:00 A.M. TIME CHINA REITERATING THE TARIFF AND IT WILL SUSPEND SOME OF THE NON-TARIFF MEASURES INCLUDING THE MONOPOLY INVESTIGATION. BOTH SIDES MAINTAINING THE TARIFFS AT CURRENT LEVEL. THIS THEY ARE KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD FOR ANOTHER 90 AS WE PLAN FOR A POTENTIAL PRESIDENT TRUMP AND XI. PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID ALREADY XI BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. THIS FLIES -- THIS BUYS THEM MORE TIME TO WORK ON THE TALES REGARDING DISAGREE -- THE D TALES. CHINA HAS ALSO BEEN PUSHING FOR THE FALL OF SOME OF THE TECH CURBS ON CHINA AND THE U.S. HAD BEEN SCRUTINIZING OF OIL FROM RUSSIA. PRESIDENT TRUMP ALSO CALLING FOR CHINA QUADRUPLE ITS SOYBEAN PURCHASES FROM THE U.S. AND HAD BEEN IN FOCUS FOR A LONG TIME AS WELL. PAUL: LET'S TALK MORE ABOUT THE ISSUE OF CHIPS PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNALING NVIDIA SELLING CHINA DOWN VERSION OF ITS MOST ADVANCED GAMMA IDEAL WITH JENSEN WONG RATE GUY AND NVIDIA. THIS IS AN OLD CHIP AND CHINA ALREADY HAS A DIFFERENT FORM, A DIFFERENT NAME. OR THEY HAVE A COMBINATION OF TWO AND WE OUT FOR IT AND THEN SOME. THE BLACK WELL IS YOU WERE ADVANCED I WOULDN'T MAKE A DEAL WITH THAT ALTHOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE I WOULD MAKE A DEAL SOMEWHAT, IN A NEGATIVE WAY, LACKED WEALTH, IN OTHER WORDS, TAKE 30% OR 50% OFF OF IT BUT THAT IS THE LATEST AND THE GREATEST IN THE WORLD NOBODY HAS IT AND ONE FOR FIVE YEARS THE LETTER H IS OBSOLETE BUT STILL HAS A MARKET. PAUL: LET'S LOOK -- LET'S DO THIS LITTLE BIT -- LET'S DIG INTO THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE. WOULD CHINA WANT A SCALED-BACK LACK WHILE CHIP UNHAPPY ABOUT THE SECURITY VULNERABILITIES OF THE CHIPS IT IS ALREADY ABLE TO ACCESS? IT DOES SEEM LIKE PRESIDENT TRUMP MIGHT BE WILLING TO CONSIDER TRADING ON THESE NATIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS IN EXCHANGE FOR SOME TYPE OF CONCESSION FROM NVIDIA. NVIDIA RECENTLY CAME INTO A DEAL WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT GIVING THE GOVERNMENT A 15% CUT OF ITS CHINA SALES IN EGGS CHANGE FOR EXPORT LICENSES FOR THE LETTER H ONE T CHIPS. THAT IS SOMETHING CHINA HAS RAISED CONCERNS ABOUT, THE SECURITY THAT THE U.S. COULD INSTALL BACKDOORS INTO THE CHIPS LIKE TRACKING CAPABILITIES THIS IS SOMETHING THAT CHINA HAS FLAGGED SOME OF THE CONCERNS ARE NOT JUST REGARDING SECURITY YOU LOOK AT THE STATE MEDIA PIECES SO FAR, THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT HOW IT IS NOT THE MOST ADVANCED TIPS AVAILABLE OR ENERGY-EFFICIENT. THERE IS NO REASON THAT CHINESE CONSUMERS SHOULD BE AND DIVIDE THESE CHIPS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MAYBE CHINA MIGHT WANT THE MORE ADVANCED LACK WELL VERSIONS. BLACKWELL CHINA AND U.S. BOTH MAY BE WILLING TO TRADE AWAY SOME OF THE SECURITY RISK IN EXCHANGE FOR SOMETHING THAT IS MORE THAN -- FOR THEM. PAUL: BLOOMBERG'S TRYING TO CORRESPOND IT MINMIN LOW. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NAMED DGN TONY TO LEAD THE BUREAU OF LABOR AND STATISTICS AFTER FIRING THE PREVIOUS CHIEF FOLLOWING WEEK JULY PAYROLLS DATA. HE HAS BEEN VOCAL ABOUT HIS CONCERNS REGARDING THE JOBS DATA AND THE REVISIONS. THE POSITION IS SUBJECT TO SENATE CONFIRMATION. TRUMP DESCRIBED THE MEETING WITH THE INTEL CEO INTERESTING CALLING HIS RISE AN AMAZING STORY. LAST WEEK THE PRESIDENT CALLED FOR HIS IMMEDIATE RESIGNATION ACCUSING HIM OF UNSPECIFIED CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. THE PRESIDENT HAS USED HIS TRUTH SOCIAL PLATFORM TO DECLARE THAT IMPORTS OF GOLD WILL NOT FACE U.S. TERRORISTS. WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL SUGGESTED LAST WEEK THAT THE U.S. WOULD ISSUE A NEW POLICY. MORE AHEAD ON THE ASIAN TRADE. THIS IS A FEEL OUT A LITTLE BIT. PRESIDENT PUTIN INVITED ME TO GET INVOLVED. HE WANTS TO GET IT OVER WITH. I'VE SAID THAT A FEW TIMES AND HAVE BEEN DISAPPOINTED. PAUL: PRESIDENT TRUMP PLAYING DON'T EXPECTATIONS FOR HIS MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN AS HE SEEKS TO END THE WAR IN UKRAINE. FOR MORE, OUR BLOOMBERG EDITOR IS WITH US THE PRESIDENT SAYING HE FEELS PRESIDENT PUTTING WANTS TO GET INVOLVED AND AND THIS WHICH IS PROBABLY CORRECT BUT ON PRESIDENT PUTIN TERMS ONE WOULD EXPECT. THIS HOW LONG THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON. WHEN IT COMES TO TRUMP IN PARTICULAR, HE HAS EXPRESSED A LOT OF FRUSTRATION OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS. THIS IS A CAMPAIGN PROMISE THAT AS SOON HE ENTERED OFFICE THAT HE WOULD END THE WAR IN UKRAINE THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED. THERE ARE A LOT OF STICKING POINTS ON WHAT WAS THE HUGHES FIRE. VLADIMIR PUTIN WOULD BE DEMANDING ON CONCESSIONS ON THE EASTERN DONBAS REGION. THE LENS HAS MADE -- PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY HAS SAID IS NOT OPEN LAND IS AND SUCH. IT MAY END UP BEING A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE CONVERSATION WHAT IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER IS JUST AHEAD OF THIS MEETING, THAT TRUMP HIMSELF IS DOING WITH HE IS IN WITH EUROPEAN LEADERS INCLUDING PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY AS WELL. THAT IS SUPPOSED TO TAKE PLACE ON WEDNESDAY. POSSIBLY SOME TERMS DISCUSSED AT THAT MEETING. I IMAGINE IF YOU ARE PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY AND EUROPEAN LEADERS YOU MAY BE WONDERING WHAT COULD BE HAPPENING IN THE TRUMP AND PRESIDENT PUTIN MEETING. AS WE KNOW, THIS HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN A DEEP FRUSTRATION TO THE PRESIDENT, HIS INABILITY TO END THE WAR WHETHER HE READ IS A BREAKTHROUGH THIS WEEKEND RATE PAUL: YOU MENTION HE IS ALSO BEEN BEFORE HAND WITH EUROPEAN LEADERS IN THE RUSSIAN PRESIDENT . WHAT SORTS OF SECURITY GUARANTEE WILL NEED TO BE AGREED. PRESIDENT PUTIN HAS A TRACK RECORD FOR SLICING UP PIECES OF UKRAINE. WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM NATO IS THAT LAND DISCUSSION WOULD HAVE TO BE ON THE TABLE. TRUMP HAS SAID HE THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE LAND UP FOR DISCUSSION. THANKS WHEN IT COMES UKRAINE, PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY, IT IS A DIFFICULT PILL TO SWALLOW. IT'S THERE IS SOME AGREEMENT THERE -- IT IS THERE IS SOME AGREEMENT THERE. I THINK THE QUESTION, WHATEVER IS DISCUSSED IN THIS ME PRESIDENT ZELENSKYY AND TRUMP AND THE EUROPEAN LEADERS, HOW MUCH OF THAT WILL TRANSFER OVER AND CARRY THROUGH TO THE TRUMP-MEETING. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHICH TELLS US NO MATTER WHAT IS ULTIMATELY DISCUSSED DURING THE PRE-BRIEFING ON WEDNESDAY, IT REMAINS TO BE WHAT HAPPENS-PUT AND WHETHER IT RESULTS IN THE SOMETHING THAT COULD INSPIRE. PAUL: -- SOMETHING THAT COULD LEAD A FIRE. PAUL: OFFICIALS SAY THE CENTRAL BANKS TWO VICE CHAIRS ARE NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION ALONG WITH THE DALLAS FED PRESIDENT TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT WILL ADDITIONAL CANDIDATES. AN EXPLOSION AT A U.S. PLANT IN PENNSYLVANIA HAS KILLED AT LEAST ONE PERSON AND INJURED 10. THE COMPANY SAYS THAT IT INVOLVES BATTERIES. U.S. STEEL CEO SAYS THE FIRM IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH AUTHORITIES TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE. THE FACTORY HAS THE OF ACCIDENTS. TWO CHINESE SHIPS COLLIDED AFTER ONE THE FILIPINO COAST GUARD VESSEL IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA THE PHILIPPINE COAST GUARD VIDEO AND PHOTOS OF THE INCIDENT. THE PHILIPPINE SAY THE CHINA WAS CARD SUFFERED SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE LET'S LOOK AT EUROPEAN FUTURES POSITIVITY THERE AS WELL FOLLOWING ON SOME OF THE SENTIMENT. WE ARE GOING TO GET U.K. JOB NUMBERS FOR JULY FIGURE ON. -- TEACHER ON. FOUR REACTORS -- TAKE A LOOK AT HOW JAPANESE ASSETS ARE TRACKING COMING BACK THE LONG END, PUBLIC HOLIDAY ON MONDAY. BOUNCING BACK STRONGLY. WE HAVE A NEED A AT RECORD RISING 1.98 PERCENT. A SHADE UNDER 2%. AGAIN THERE AS WELL WRAPS A FUNCTION OF A STRENGTHENING U.S. DOLLAR. WE ARE SEEING SOME DOLLAR STRENGTH THERE IN THE LAST 24 HOURS NOT A LOT OF ON THE JAPANESE AND EUROPE. UP TO RECORD -- BRINGING YOU UP TO DATE RECKITT HANH DID REPORT ON FRIDAY AFTER THE CLOSE IT WASN'T A FANTASTIC SET OF NUMBERS BUT THE STOCK IS STILL REBOUNDING NICELY. TAKE A LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER ASSETS WE ARE TRACKING WE HAVE THE DOLLAR SPOT INDEX SHOWING SOME STRENGTH ALTHOUGH IT IS PROVING WRONG WHEN BACK HAD THE 10 YEAR ALSO HOLDING PRETTY STEADY AT FOUR POINT S & P JUICE ARE MODESTLY POSITIVE AHEAD OF THE CPI DATA FOR JULY COMING OUT WEST ARROW. PAUL: LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THAT AT HOW SOME THE KEY CURRENCY ARE GOING NUMB DOLLARS STRENGTH PERHAPS CONTRIBUTING THE YEN WE THE AUSSIE DOLLAR, NOT A LOT OF CHANGE HAVE A CENTRAL BANK DECISION TODAY AND ONE WOULD IMAGINE LITTLE BIT OF THAT ACTION HAS ALREADY BEEN PRICED IN BE WE HAVE ALL 36 ECONOMISTS SURVEYED EXPECTING A CUT OF 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE LABOR MARKET SAYS THERE IS MORE SLACK THAN PROJECTED ALSO EVICTING A CUT TODAY, OUR OWN WORK ECONOMIST WE WERE ANTICIPATING A CUT DID NOT MATERIALIZE. WAS A NEW TO CUT -- HE DID NOT THINK THERE WAS A NEED TO CUT FIVE WEEKS AGO. THE LABOR MARKET WAS TIGHT. THE MONTHLY INFLATION DATA WAS SUGGESTING THINGS ARE WE. I THINK MARK NICK -- OUR WEEK. THAT WAS THAT WAS WHY THEY HELD IN JULY. . PAUL: THE RBA HAS A DUAL MANDATE IS THERE ANY CONSIDERATION FOR THE TRADE ENVIRONMENT? TRADE WILL NOT BE OF OUR EXPE COMMODITIES AND WE HAVE ONE OF THE BETTER TRADE DEALS WITH THE U.S. ONLY THAT 10% RECIPROCAL TARIFF. THE BIGGER TRADE IMPACT COME WITH THE RBA WILL BE CONSIDERING AND WORRIED ABOUT WILL BE ANY OF THE UNCERTAINTY SHOCK FROM WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THE EVOLUTION OF U.S. ECONOMIC POLICY FOLLOWING THE LIBERATION TRADE DAY. THAT IS A REAL CHALLENGE GIVEN WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY. WE ARE HOPING THAT AFTER STRONG PUBLIC SECTOR DEMAND WITHIN GROWTH IN 2023 AND 2024, THE PRIVATE SECTOR SIDE OF THE ECONOMY IS REALLY GOING TO PICK UP THIS YEAR. HAPPENS TO DRIVE CONSUMERS AND CLOSE THEIR WALLETS, SIT ON THEIR HANDS, AND MAYBE SEES FIRMS TAKE A SECOND GUESS. IF WE DON'T GET THAT PRIVATE SECTOR PICK UP, THE RBA WILL BE WORRIED ABOUT THOSE SORTS OF SPILLOVERS. PAUL: WHAT CAN WE ANTICIPATE DOWN THE TRACK AND WHAT COMMENTARY WILL BE HERE LATER? I THINK IN ONE WAY WHICH YOU COULD PROBABLY CALL -- THEY WILL BE DELIVERING FURTHER EASING. THE RBA KNOWS THAT WE THINK THE INTEREST RATE IS TOO HIGH FOR WHAT WE NEED. IT IS ABOVE NEUTRAL AND CONTRACTIONARY. BUT THE ECONOMY IS NOT SCREAMING THAT THEY NEED TO RUSH INTO AN EASING OR STIMULATORY STATE RIGHT NOW. IT IS MORE ABOUT A GRADUAL RETURN TO NEUTRAL AND IN MY VIEW I THINK WE MIGHT NEED TO MOVE BEYOND THAT NEXT YEAR. WHAT WE ARE LIKELY TO GET FROM THE RBA IS A CONTINUATION OF CAUTIOUS CUTTING, VERY DELIBERATE AND DATA-DRIVEN. FURTHER EASING BUT NOT LIKELY TO COME STRAIGHT AWAY. THE UPDATE WE ARE GOING TO GET TODAY WILL HAVE ANOTHER SIX MONTHS ON THE FORECAST PROFILE AND THAT WILL BE ENOUGH TO PULL THEM OVER THE LINE. PAUL: CERTAINLY BEEN AN INTERESTING WEEK IN TERMS OF THE THREE ON YOUR SCREEN. GOLD FINALLY SETTLING DOWN AFTER ALL THE DRAMA WE HAVE SEEN. WE WILL GET TO THAT IN A MINUTE. IRON ORE HAS BEEN INTERESTING BECAUSE WE HAVE HAD THE NEWS FROM CHINA THE PAST 24 HOURS THAT A NUMBER OF STEEL MILLS WILL BE CLOSED MAINLY DUE TO OIL AIR QUALITY BUT PERHAPS SOMETHING TO DO WITH OVERCAPACITY AS WELL. OIL PRICES HOLDING REASONABLY STUDY AT THE MOMENT. BRENT CRUDE UP BY .3%. LET'S GET MORE ON THIS WITH ENERGY AND COMMODITIES EDITOR ANDREW JANES. I WANT TO START WITH THE ACTION WE SAW IN GOLD PRICES. SEEMS TO HAVE SETTLED DOWN FOR NOW BUT THERE WAS CONCERN IT MIGHT SEE -- MIGHT BE SUBJECT OF TARIFFS. THIS PLAYS INTO IS IT A COMMODITY OR CURRENCY DEBATE AROUND GOLD, RIGHT? ANDREW: THAT'S RIGHT. IT HAS BEEN A TUMULTUOUS FEW SESSIONS FOR GOLD ALTHOUGH MAINLY IN THE U.S. PRICES AS OPPOSED TO THE GLOBAL BENCHMARK TRADED IN LONDON. THE SUIT WAS SPARKED LATE LAST WEEK BY A REPORT THAT SAID THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WOULD PUT TARIFFS ON GOLD BARS. ONE KILOGRAM AND 100 OUNCE GOLD BAR IS ARE HEAVILY TRADED AROUND THE WORLD. THAT CAUSED THE PRICE IN THE U.S. TO SURGE ON FRIDAY. A BIG DISLOCATION WITH THE LONDON PRICE. AS YOU SAY, GOLD IS AN INVESTMENT ASSET. IT IS A CURRENCY, REALLY. SO TARIFFS ON GOLLD BARS WOULD HAVE ALMOST BEEN LIKE A TARIFF ON A CURRENCY. WOULD HAVE REALLY GUMMED UP THE MARKET CAUSED BIG DISLOCATIONS BETWEEN THE PRICES IN NEW YORK AND LONDON. TRUMP HAS COME OUT WITH A SOCIAL MEDIA POST TODAY SAYING THE TARIFFS WILL NOT HAPPEN. SO IT APPEARS SANITY HAS PREVAILED ALTHOUGH AS ALWAYS WITH DONALD TRUMP, WE DON'T HAVE ANY DETAILS. PAUL: THAT'S RIGHT. THE FIVE WORDS ON SOCIAL MEDIA BUT NO FORMAL POLICY YET. TELL US ABOUT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WITH IRON ORE AS WELL BECAUSE WE HAVE GOT THE NEWS THAT A NUMBER OF CHINESE STEEL MILLS ARE GOING TO TEMPORARILY HALT OUTPUT. THIS IS HELPING SUPPORT IRON ORE PRICES, BUT FOR HOW LONG? ANDREW: THAT'S RIGHT. IS IN A BIG STEELMAKING OF REASONABLY CLOSE TO BEIJING. THERE IS A BIG MILITARY PARADE HAPPENING IN BEIJING ON SEPTEMBER 3. AND SO SOME OF THESE MILLS HAVE BEEN ORDERED THE SHUT DOWN OR REDUCE ACTIVITY. THIS IS SOMETHING CHINA DOES QUITE OFTEN. IT LIKES TO ENSURE CLEAN SKIES OF BIG PARADES AND EVENTS YOU SEE AROUND SPORTING EVENTS AND STUFF AS WELL. THE BIGGER QUESTION I GUESS IS, IS THIS PART OF THE SO-CALLED ANTI-EVOLUTION CAMPAIGN? THIS HAS STEPPED UP EFFORTS IN BEIJING TO REDUCE OVERCAPACITY ACROSS SEVERAL SECTORS IN THE ECONOMY. HARD TO SAY IF IT IS. SO THE BIG QUESTION REALLY IS WHAT EXTENT STEEL MILLS GET INCLUDED IN THIS BIG CAMPAIGN TO TACKLE OVERCAPACITY. ON THE ONE HAND IF YOU'RE GETTING STEEL MILLS TO PRODUCE STEEL AND MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR IRON ORE BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THIS SHOULD BE GOOD FOR THE SECTOR AND HELP MARGINS. SO IT CAN ALSO BE SEEN AS A BIT OF A POSITIVE FOR IRON ORE AND IRON ORE PRICES HAVE TENDED TO RISE ON SPECULATION THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN. PAUL: ALL RIGHT. ANDREW JANES THERE. LET'S GET THE LATEST ON THE CORPORATE FRONT. MICRON HAS RAISED ITS FISCAL FOURTH-QUARTER SALES AND PROFIT OUTLOOK CITING STRONGER DRAM PRICES AND HIGHER BEEN WITH MEMORY DEMAND. REVENUE IS NOW SEEN UP TO $11.3 BILLION WITH EARNINGS AS HIGH AS $2.92 A SHARE. SHARES CLOSED MORE THAN 4% HIGHER. MICRON HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BEST-PERFORMING CHIP STOCKS THIS YEAR. FORD HAS UNVEILED A $5 BILLION PLAN FOR OF BUDGET ELECTRIC VEHICLES STARTING WITH A $30,000 PICKUP TRUCK SENT TO ROLL IN 2027. THE CEO CALLS IT A BET TO TAKE ON CHINESE RIVALS, WARNING THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES IN THE UNPREDICTABLE U.S. TV MARKET. THE PLAN INCLUDES A $2 BILLION OVERHAUL OF FORWARDS LOUISVILLE PLANT. PARAMOUNT IS BUYING THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO SHOW ALL EVENTS FROM THE ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP IN THE U.S. THE SEVEN YEAR DEAL IS WORTH 7.7 BILLION DOLLARS AND BOLSTERS THE POWER MOUNT PRESS SERVICE. TKO GROUP JUMPED 10% IN NEW YORK TRADING. PARAMOUNT SAYS ALSO BUYING INTERNATIONAL RIGHTS IN THE FUTURE AS THEY BECOME AVAILABLE. WE HAVE GOT THE NIKKEI AT A RECORD. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT SOME KEY STOCKS MOVING AT THE MOMENT. RECORD 10 GROUP OF MORE THAN 3%. IT DID DELIVER A RATHER DEPRESSING SET OF NUMBERS ON FRIDAY BUT THE MARKET REACTING WARMLY. SOME OF THE ANALYSTS SAYING THERE ARE NO SURPRISES IN THAT THAT RESULT BUT THE EARNINGS DO SIGNAL A SUSTAINED PROFIT TURNAROUND BY COST CONTROLS. OLYMPUS THINKING ABOUT 7%, CUTTING ITS OPERATING INCOME GUIDANCE FOR THE FULL YEAR. GUIDANCE DID STILL BEAT THE TOP ANALYSTS ESTIMATE. ANOTHER STOCK WE ARE WATCHING IS SHARP, UP MORE THAN 7%. SHARP BOOSTING ITS OPERATIONAL INCOME GUIDANCE FOR THE FULL YEAR, EVEN THOUGH THAT GUIDANCE DIDN'T MISS THE AVERAGE ANALYST ESTIMATE. OPERATING INCOME FOR THE FIRST QUARTER FOR SHARP, 15.3 BILLION YEN WHICH BLUE ESTIMATES OUT OF THE WATER, MORE THAN THREE TIMES HIGHER. WE HAVE MORE AHEAD. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a PAUL: LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT HOW AUSTRALIAN ASSETS ARE TRACKING. FAIRLY POSITIVE DAY FOR AUSTRALIA AT THE MOMENT SEEING MODEST GAINS HERE. WE HAVE GOT THE AUSSIE DOLLAR HOLDING ON JUST ABOVE $.65 AS WELL. THAT IS OF COURSE THE RESERVE BANK OF AUSTRALIA DECISION DAY. A MIXED BAG IN TERMS OF THE BEST PERFORMERS. WE SAW A BIG BUMP ON LITHIUM STOCKS YESTERDAY. THAT IS NOT A TREND WE ARE SEEING CONTINUE INTO TODAY. THIS IS OF COURSE COURSE THE START OF EARNINGS SEASON IN AUSTRALIA. WE HAVE THE RBA AS I MENTIONED ALSO IN HERE TO HELP US UNPACK ALL OF THIS WE ARE JOINED BY JASON STEEDS, JP MORGAN HEAD OF AUSTRALIA RESEARCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY AND COMING IN. EARNINGS SEASON GETTING UNDERWAY. ANY PARTICULAR SECTORS OR COMPANIES YOU ARE WATCHING FOR OUTPERFORMANCE? JASON: WHAT WE ARE ANTICIPATING IS A VERY VOLATILE SEASON. WE PUBLISHED A REPORT RECENTLY DESCRIBING THIS AS THE TEMPEST AND I THINK EVEN IN THE FIRST WEEK OR SO OF THE SEASON WE HAVE SEEN THAT. WE HAVE SEEN VERY EXTREME MOVES BOTH TO THE UPSIDE AND THEN WE HAVE SEEN MORE DIFFICULT DAYS FOR STOCKS TRENDING LOWER. I THINK THAT IS REALLY ADMIN VIGNETTE OF WHAT IS AHEAD FOR THE SEASON. WHEN WE LOOK AT WHERE -- WHERE THERE IS THE PROSPECT OF EARNINGS GROWTH, HEALTH CARE IS AN EXAMPLE WHERE THERE WILL NO DOUBT BE CHALLENGES. CSL HAS A LONG D RATING, BUT IT IS A SECTOR THAT OFFERS GROWTH AND INCREASINGLY INVESTORS ARE LOOKING TOWARDS WHERE CAN WE FIND HIGH SINGLE DIGIT OR DOUBLE DIGIT GROWTH AND I WOULD SAY TECH IS LANDING IN THAT TERRITORY AS WELL. PAUL: A COMPANY LIKE CSL ALSO EXPOSED TO WEALTH UNCERTAINTY. WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO PHARMACEUTICAL TARIFFS. WHEN YOU CAST YOUR EYE ACROSS AUSTRALIA'S LISTED COMPANIES, IS THAT SOMETHING YOU THINK THESE TRADE EXPOSED ONES MIGHT HAVE AN INTERESTING FEW QUARTERS? JASON: WITHOUT DOUBT. AS WE KNOW AND ARE EXPERIENCING ALMOST DAY BY DAY, THERE IS PERSISTENT UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHERE TARIFFS MIGHT LAND, WHICH COUNTRIES WILL BE HIT HARDEST, WHICH SECTORS IS AN AREA OF CONCERN. I THINK FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE LONGER TERM PICTURE FOR A COMPANY LIKE CSL OR A COMPANY LIKE REZ MET, WE CAN SEE THE GROWTH PROFILE BEING GENERALLY ROBUST. SO WE CAN FEEL CONFIDENT AROUND THAT BUT YOU ARE RIGHT, IN THE SHORT-TERM IT IS MORE CHALLENGING AND THAT IS WHY WE HAVE SEEN NOT SINGULARLY BUT QUITE A FEW OF THE DOMESTIC SECULAR SECTORS DO PRETTY WELL BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT FACING THAT TARIFF UNCERTAINTY, THAT DAY BY DAY WHIP SAWING THAT COMES FROM THE PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT THE TRENCH VERY REGULARLY. PAUL: IT IS NOT JUST THOSE PRONOUNCEMENTS BECAUSE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PACIFIC WE HAVE CHINA DEALING WITH ITS OVERCAPACITY ISSUE AND THAT HAS MAJOR IMPLICATIONS FOR AUSTRALIA'S MINERAL SECTOR. DO YOU SEE THAT PLAYING OUT IN THE NUMBERS? JASON: NOT IN THE SHORT-TERM BUT THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT WHEN WE HEAR FROM THE LITHIUM COUNTRIES THAT YOU MENTIONED ARE DOING TREMENDOUSLY WELL ON THE ANTI-INVOLUTION STORY THAT IS BUILDING IN CHINA. CERTAINLY IN SECTORS WHERE THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT OVERCAPACITY LIKE LITHIUM THERE IS THE PROSPECT THAT WHEN THE COMPANY'S REPORT OR THE OUTLOOK THEY TALK ABOUT THEY WILL TALK THAT THE SUPPLY SIDE IS MORE CONSTRAINT AND THAT WILL BE BENEFICIAL TO PERFORMANCE. BUT OVERALL THIS SENSE THAT THERE IS PERHAPS SUPPLY-SIDE DISCIPLINE COMING INTO THE EQUATION IN CHINA IS VERY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE FOR A LONG TIME THAT OVERCAPACITY, THAT ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY AS WELL AS TARIFF UNCERTAINTY, HAS BEEN A NEGATIVE FACTOR FOR A LOT OF THE MATERIALS COMPANIES IN OUR MARKET. PAUL: WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT COMMONWEALTH BANK BECAUSE IT IS THE 900,000 POUND GORILLA OF THE INDEX. OUR TOP 37% ON YEAR, THERE IS ALWAYS COMMENTARY AROUND THE STOCK ABOUT HOW OVERPRICED IT LOOKS AND YET IT KEEPS DEFYING GRAVITY. A LOT OF INTEREST FROM OVERSEAS INVESTORS. DO YOU SEE THAT AS A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN AUSTRALIA AND CAN THESE GAINS BE SUSTAINED? JASON: I THINK THE GAINS WILL BE DIFFICULT TO CONTINUE ON. NOT SURE WE ARE GOING TO SEE FURTHER GAINS. AND I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO SEE FROM THE CBA AND OTHER BANKS WHICH OBVIOUSLY DON'T REPORT IN THIS SEASON, BUT IS EVIDENCE THAT THERE IS SOME GROWTH IN THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS. THAT IS THE BIGGEST ISSUE FOR OUR BANKS AT THE MOMENT, IS THERE IS VERY LIMITED AND IN SOME CASES NEGATIVE EARNINGS GROWTH IN THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS. IF YOU ARE RUNNING WITH A MULTIPLE LIKE CBA DOES AT THE MOMENT, 30 TIMES EARNINGS, AND A DIVIDEND YIELD OF SUB 3%, WE ARE GOING TO SEE SOMETHING IN THE NUMBERS THAT GIVES US CONFIDENCE THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN LEVELS OF RETURN BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THAT THERE IS SOME GROWTH IN THE NEXT TWO TO THREE YEARS, WHICH RIGHT NOW IS DIFFICULT TO SEE. CREDIT GROWTH IS AND WILL PICK UP WE THINK WITH THE RBA BUT THE REALITY IS THAT MIGHT GENERATE 2% TO 3% EARNINGS GROWTH WHICH IS LOW IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE ELEVATED MULTIPLES WE SEE ACROSS THE SECTOR. PAUL: IN TERMS OF THE RBA WE ARE EXPECTING TO SEE THE EASING CYCLE CONTINUE AT THAT GRADUAL PACE TODAY. PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY, YOURSELF I AM SURE, IS ANTICIPATING A 20 FIVE BASIS POINT REDUCTION. WHERE TO FROM HER WHERE TO FROM HERE? WHERE WE ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT IS WE ONLY EXPECT ONE FURTHER CUT BEYOND TODAY. IF YOU LOOK AT MARKET PRICING, I THINK IT IS CLOSER TO THREE. AND WHAT THAT LEAVES BEHIND IS HOW MUCH MORE CAN THAT THE ECONOMY? OR THE HOUSING OF -- FOR THE HOUSING MARKET? IT IS THE HEALTH OF THE CONSUMER AND HOW MUCH THEY ARE SPENDING. TWO MORE WILL HELP. WILL IT PUT A ROCKET UNDER THOSE TWO? I DON'T THINK SO. THAT IS THE CHALLENGE. THE PROPERTY MARKET CONTINUES TO DEFY EXPECTATIONS. OFF THE BACK OF THAT MEETING FIVE WEEKS AGO, QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN ASKED ABOUT THE COMMUNICATIONS FROM THE RESERVE BANK. HOW DO YOU FEEL CONCERN -- HOW DO YOU FEEL COMMUNICATIONS HAVE BEEN? THE TIMES WE SEE THE GOVERNOR HAVE INCREASED SO WE GET A BROADER RANGE OF POINTS FOR REFERENCE. IT IS A DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH INFLATION IS DISTORTED BY DIFFERENT FACTORS SUCH AS SUBSIDIES, WHERE THERE IS GLOBAL UNCERTAINTY TO AT ANY ONE POINT IN TIME SAY EVERYTHING YOU HAVE ON THE TABLE IS ENOUGH TO MEET THE MARKETS EXPECTATIONS. I UNDERSTAND WHERE THERE MAY BE POINTS IN TIME WHERE THERE IS A DIVERSIONS AND FROM A MARKET PERSPECTIVE I THINK WE SHOULD WELCOME BACK BECAUSE SOMETIMES UNCERTAINTY BRINGS ABOUT OPPORTUNITY. FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, I THINK THE RBA WORKED WITH WHAT THEY HAD IN -- AT THE TIME AND WITH THE DATA WE HAVE HAD SINCE THE LAST DECISION, IT IS A CLEARER PATH FOR THEM. WE WILL SEE AT 2 -- AT 2:30 P.M. TOMORROW WE WILL BE SPEAKING FIRST WITH THE EVOLUTION MINING MANAGING DIRECTOR, LORI CONWAY. THAT INTERVIEW IT 9:15 ON WEDNESDAY. WE HAVE MORE ON AUSTRALIA AND AHEAD. EVERY TUESDAY, IF YOU ARE WATCHING IN SYDNEY, IT IS 8:40 A.M. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT OUR FUTURE IS TRACKING AHEAD OF THE OPEN IN CHINA AND TAIWAN. A LITTLE SOFTNESS THERE. EARLIER WE HAD THE NEWS THAT THE TRADE TRUCE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA WOULD BE EXTENDED FOR A FURTHER 90 DAYS. THAT NEWS CATCHING NO ONE OFFGUARD. IT WAS WIDELY EXPECTED. WE SAW NO REACTION IN THE MARKET. U.S. FUTURES POINTING HIGHER. LET'S GET A PREVIEW OF THE MARKET OPEN IN CHINA. OUR MANAGING EDITOR FOR ASIAN EQUITIES JOINS US. WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING IN TERMS OF MARKET REACTION IF ANY TO THE NEWS OF THE EXTENSION OF THE TARIFF TRUCE? AS YOU SAID, I THINK A MUTED REACTION IS WHAT PEOPLE EXPECT BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN SO MUCH NEWS IN THE LAST WEEK POINTING TO A POTENTIAL TRUCE. THE MOOD MUSIC HAS BEEN RELATIVELY POSITIVE WITH DONALD TRUMP TALKING UP A MEETING WITH XI AND EVEN THE NVIDIA CHIP NEWS IS POINTING TO A CONSTRUCTIVE TONE BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. THE MARKET INVESTOR ATTENTION HAS SHIFTED TO EARNINGS. WE HAVE A SLEW OF INTERNET GIANTS FROM CHINA REPORTING EARNINGS IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. TENCENT WILL BE REPORTING TOMORROW. AND WE HAVE THE LIKES OF XIAOMI AND OTHERS REPORTING BY THE END OF THE MONTH. THAT WILL BE THE NEXT CATALYST FOR THE HONG KONG LISTED CHINA STOCKS GOING FORWARD. CHINA'S MAINLAND STOCK MARKET HAS BEEN DOING WELL CARED WHAT IS DRIVING THE RALLY? IT HAS BEEN GOING QUITE WELL. CSI 300 HAS HAD THE FOURTH CONSECUTIVE MASSIVE GAINS. IT HAS BEEN OUTPERFORMING HONG KONG STOCKS FOR TWO STRAIGHT MONTHS. THE REASON MAINLY IS THE AMPLE LIQUIDITY GOING ON AND OFFSHORE. WE HAVE SEEN RISING HOUSEHOLD SAVINGS. THERE ARE INSURANCE FUNDS OR MORE INSURANCE FUNDS GOING INTO THE ONSHORE MARKET AS WELL. THAT IS RESULTING IN A NUMBER OF INDICES HAVING SOME FRESH MILESTONES. LOOK AT THE SHANGHAI COMPOSITE, WE ARE CLOSE TO TAKING OUT THE INTRADAY OCTOBER 8 HIGHS TO REACH THE HIGHEST SINCE 2021. THAT COULD BE ACHIEVED TODAY. THERE IS FOR OFF FORMING IN CORNERS OF THE ONSHORE MARKET. LOOK AT THE SMALL-CAP INDEX, CSI 2000, THAT INDEX IS ALMOST AT THE HIGHEST IN EIGHT YEARS AND MARGIN TRADING IS AT A DECADE HIGH. WE ARE SEEING SPECULATION GOING ON IN THE ONSHORE MARKET WHILE MOST PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT THE ONSHORE RALLY STILL HAS A LITTLE BIT OF LEGS. THERE IS ANOTHER CAMP THAT SAYS THE RALLY MAY NOT BE SUSTAINED WITHOUT MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENT IN EARNINGS IN THE MACROECONOMY. BLOOMBERG'S MANAGING EDITOR FOR ASIAN EQUITIES. TAKE A LOOK AT HOW OUR BENCHMARKS ARE TRADING ACROSS THE MARKETS THAT ARE OPEN. A MODESTLY RISK ON DAY IN AUSTRALIA AHEAD OF THE RBA MEETING IN A FEW HOURS. WE EXPECT THAT REDUCTION OF 25 BASIS POINTS. TAKE A LOOK AT THE NIKKEI. BACK FROM A THREE-DAY HOLIDAY AND OFF TO THE RACES. THE NIKKEI IS AT A RECORD. THE KOSPI ALSO HIGHER BY ALMOST 1%. THAT IS IT FOR THE ASIA TRADE. MARKETS COVERAGE CONTINUES AS WE LOOK TO THE START OF TRADE IN HONG KONG,",
