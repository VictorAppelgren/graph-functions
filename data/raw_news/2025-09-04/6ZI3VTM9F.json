  "description": "See Thursday\u2019s report on average mortgage rates on different types of home loans so you can pick the best mortgage for your needs as you house shop.",
  "content": "The average interest rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate conforming mortgage loan in the U.S. is 6.522%, according to data available from mortgage data company Optimal Blue. That\u2019s up approximately 3 basis points from the prior day\u2019s report, and down approximately 1 basis point from a week ago. Read on to compare average rates for a variety of conventional and government-backed mortgage types and see whether rates have increased or decreased.\n\nNote that Fortune reviewed Optimal Blue\u2019s latest available data on Sept. 3, with the numbers reflecting home loans locked in as of Sept. 2.\n\nIf it appears 30-year mortgage rates have been stuck on the brink of 7% for an eternity, that impression is not too far off from reality. Many watching the market expected rates to decrease when the Federal Reserve began reducing the federal funds rate last September, but that hope did not materialize. There was a brief decline leading up to the September Fed meeting, but rates swiftly increased afterward.\n\nIn fact, by January 2025 the average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage passed 7% for the first time since last May, according to Freddie Mac figures. That\u2019s considerably higher than the historic average low of 2.65% witnessed in January 2021, when the government was still attempting to boost the economy and prevent a pandemic-induced recession.\n\nBarring another catastrophe, experts agree we won\u2019t see mortgage rates in the 2% to 3% range in our lifetimes. However, rates around the 6% level are entirely feasible if the U.S. succeeds in controlling inflation and lenders feel confident about the economic outlook.\n\nIn fact, rates dipped slightly at the end of February, falling closer to the 6.5% mark than had been observed for some time. They even fell below 6.5% for a brief moment in early April before rising once again.\n\nCurrently, with uncertainty about how far President Donald Trump will go in implementing policies such as tariffs and deportations, some analysts fear the labor market could tighten and inflation could reignite. In this environment, U.S. homebuyers are faced with high mortgage rates\u2014though some can still find ways to make their purchase more affordable, such as negotiating rate buydowns with a builder when buying newly constructed housing.\n\nHow to get the best mortgage rate you can\n\nWhile economic conditions are out of your control, your financial profile as an applicant also has a major impact on how low a mortgage rate you\u2019re offered. With that in mind, strive to do the following:\n\u2022 Ensure your credit is in excellent shape. The minimum credit score to get a conventional mortgage is generally 620 (for FHA loans, you may be able to qualify with a score of 580 or a score as low as 500 and a 10% down payment). But, if you\u2019re hoping to get a low rate that could potentially save you five or even six figures in interest over the life of your loan, you\u2019ll want a score quite a bit higher. For example, lender Blue Water Mortgage notes that a score of at least 740 is considered top tier.\n\u2022 Keep your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio low. You can calculate your DTI by dividing your monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income, then multiplying by 100. For example, someone with a $3,000 monthly income and $750 in monthly debt payments has a 25% DTI. It\u2019s typically best when applying for a mortgage to have a DTI of 36% or below, though you may get approved with a DTI as high as 43%\n\u2022 Get prequalified with multiple lenders. You may wish to try a mix of large banks, local credit unions, and online lenders and compare offers. Plus, getting connected with loan officers at several different institutions can help you evaluate what you\u2019re looking for in a lender and which one will be best able to meet your needs. Just make sure when you\u2019re comparing rates that you\u2019re doing it in a way that\u2019s apples to apples\u2014if one estimate relies on you purchasing mortgage discount points and another does not, it\u2019s important to understand there\u2019s an upfront cost for buying down your rate with points.\n\nAn important piece of context to the discussion surrounding high mortgage rates is that today\u2019s rates in the ballpark of 7% feel high because of the recent memory of rates in the range of 2% to 3%. Those rates were possible as the federal government took virtually unprecedented action trying to prevent recession as the country battled a global pandemic.\n\nHowever, under more typical economic conditions, experts agree we\u2019re unlikely to see such dramatically low interest rates again. And, historically, rates in the vicinity of 7% are not abnormally high.\n\nConsider this St. Louis Fed (FRED) chart tracking Freddie Mac data on the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage average. From the 1970s through the 1990s, such rates were more or less the norm, with a massive spike in the early 1980s. In fact, September, October, and November of 1981 all saw mortgage interest rates above 18%.\n\nStill, that historical context is scant comfort for homeowners who may want to move but are locked in with a once-in-a-lifetime low interest rate. Such situations are common enough in the current market that low pandemic-era rates keeping homeowners put when they\u2019d otherwise move have become known as the \u201cgolden handcuffs.\u201d\n\nThe state of the U.S. economy may well be the biggest thing impacting mortgage rates. If lenders are worried about inflation, they can hike rates to protect their future earnings. And, the national debt is another big factor. When the government has to borrow large sums to cover its spending, that can push interest rates higher.\n\nDemand for home loans plays a big role too. If not many consumers are seeking loans, lenders might cut rates to attract borrowers. But if demand is high, they might raise rates to cover the costs of handling more loans.\n\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s actions are also crucial. The Fed can influence mortgage rates both by adjusting the federal funds rate and by managing its balance sheet.\n\nThat first factor, the federal funds rate, gets a lot of coverage in the media. When the Fed hikes or cuts it, mortgage rates often follow. But keep in mind, the Fed doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates directly, and they don\u2019t always move in perfect step with the fed funds rate.\n\nThe Fed also impacts rates on long-term financial products like mortgages via its balance sheet. During economic downturns, the central bank can buy assets like mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to inject money into the economy.\n\nBut recently, the Fed has been trimming its balance sheet, letting assets mature without buying new ones. This tends to push interest rates up. So while everyone watches for federal funds rate decisions, what the Fed does with its balance sheet might matter even more for your mortgage rate.\n\nComparing rates on different types of loans and shopping around with different lenders are both important steps in getting the best mortgage for your situation.\n\nIf your credit is in stellar shape, opting for a conventional mortgage could very well be the best choice for you. But, if your score is sub-600, an FHA loan may give you a chance a conventional loan would not.\n\nWhen it comes to shopping around with different banks, credit unions, and online lenders, it can make a tangible difference in how much you pay. Freddie Mac research shows that in a market with high interest rates, homebuyers may be able to save $600 to $1,200 annually if they apply with multiple mortgage lenders.",

      "text": "Now\u2019s a great time to open up a new savings account to reach your financial goals. Many of the best savings account rates available today are above 4.00%, and a few outliers may even reach as much as 5.00%.\nRising inflation and economic uncertainty has prompted the Federal Reserve to pause further rate cuts over the past several months. While this has mixed implications across the U.S. economy, it suggests that average savings account APYs may remain stable\u2014at least until the Fed decides to reduce the federal funds rate.\nFor investors who want to maximize their returns or save for a new financial goal, Fortune has collaborated with Curinos, a team of financial industry experts, to provide an overview of the most competitive high-yield savings account rates available today.\nToday\u2019s best high-yield savings account rates: Earn up to 5.00% APY\nVaro Money has the best savings account rate today, offering up to 5.00% APY. Other institutions with very competitive APYs include Betterment, SoFi, and Presidential Bank.\nAs part of our ongoing commitment to help readers optimize their savings, Fortune continuously monitors the top rates offered by leading U.S. financial institutions. Compare today\u2019s top savings account rates below:\nFDIC average national deposit rates: January 2020 to present\nThe rates listed above are significantly higher than the national average of 0.39% that you\u2019ll find on many accounts. And after the Fed\u2019s recent rate cuts this average has been falling, down from a previous high of 0.47% in March 2024.\nCheck Out Our Daily Rates Reports\n- Discover the highest CD rates, up to 4.45% for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover the current mortgage rates for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover current refi mortgage rates report for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover current ARM mortgage rates report for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of gold for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of silver for September 3, 2025.\nSavings account news in 2025\nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy decisions play a key role in shaping savings account rates. When the Fed raises its benchmark rate, financial institutions typically follow suit by increasing the APYs offered on savings accounts to remain competitive. Conversely, when the central bank lowers rates, savings account yields generally decrease.\nThe Fed has left the fed funds rate, its key short-term interest rate, unchanged at 4.25%-4.50% since December 2024. With inflation potentially heating up again, we are unlikely to see more rate cuts any time soon, so it\u2019s logical to believe that the high-yield savings rates we see now could be sticking around for a while longer.\nJust bear in mind that the linkage between Fed rates and savings yields isn\u2019t always so direct. Banks adjust their savings rates based on a variety of factors, including their own financial objectives, efforts to attract new customers, and broader market conditions.\nHere\u2019s why finding high-yield savings account is important\nThe key difference between high-yield and traditional savings accounts lies in the interest rate offered; High-yield accounts typically provide rates 10 to 20 times higher than conventional accounts. For example, while the national average savings rate is 0.39%, many of the high-yield accounts on our list offer rates above 4.00%.\nTraditional accounts often come with physical branch access but lower rates, while high-yield accounts are typically offered by online banks. They feature higher rates but no option for in-person services. Just remember that no matter what type of account you have, you\u2019ll owe the IRS a portion of the interest earned.\nSubstantially higher interest rates aren\u2019t the only perk you get from these accounts, either. They\u2019re often free from minimum balance requirements or monthly fees. Your liquid funds remain easily accessible, making them ideal for emergency funds or short-term savings goals. And these online accounts are still FDIC-insured, providing the same protection as traditional banks.\nWhen comparing savings accounts, keep these factors in mind:\n- Interest rates: Look for competitive APYs to maximize your earnings.\n- Minimum balance requirements: Many high-yield accounts have no minimums.\n- Fee structure: Avoid accounts with monthly maintenance fees.\n- Fund accessibility: Ensure easy withdrawals or transfers when needed, preferably without charging foreign ATM fees\n- Security: Verify FDIC insurance coverage.\nFrequently asked questions\nHow often do APYs on high-yield savings accounts change?\nThe frequency with which your high-yield savings account\u2019s rate changes isn\u2019t set in stone. Financial institutions can update APYs at their discretion, but changes are commonly linked to moves in the federal funds rate set by the Federal Reserve.\nShould I switch banks if I find a savings account with a higher rate?\nIf you find a higher APY elsewhere, it might be smart to switch, but only after checking if the extra interest earned would be substantial and if the new account\u2019s terms (for example, minimum deposit requirements) fit your needs.\nHow easy is it to withdraw money from a HYSA?\nIt\u2019s typically simple to take money out of a HYSA, especially assuming your bank offers digital transfers. Just know that even though federal limits on withdrawals have been lifted, some banks continue to restrict you to six per statement cycle.\nShould I choose an online-only bank for my HYSA?\nOnline banks frequently offer more competitive yields on savings accounts, so they\u2019re a great place to look when searching for the best high-yield options.\nCan I lose money in a high-yield savings account?\nWith FDIC or NCUA insurance, your principal in a HYSA is secure up to the insurance max. However, if the account\u2019s APY is lower than inflation, your money\u2019s buying power could decrease over time.\nSeries on daily savings rates created by former Fortune editor Cassie Bottorff.

Historically, it trails other investment options, like stocks. From 1921 onward, silver has underperformed the S&P 500 by about 96%. That means an equal sum invested in silver and stocks back then would now be worth 96% less in silver holdings than stocks.\nInstead, silver is prized for its stability and its power to hedge against inflation. Often dubbed a \u201cstore of value,\u201d it tends to sustain purchasing power when inflation climbs.\nCompared with gold, silver prices generally swing more sharply due to industrial demand\u2014solar equipment, healthcare devices, and more\u2014whereas gold is almost purely a safe-haven asset.\nWhat does \u201cspot silver\u201d mean?\n\u201cSpot silver\u201d refers to the live market rate at which silver can be bought or sold instantly. That said, real-world buyers usually pay a premium over spot for markups, shipping, insurance, and other fees.\nThe spot price serves as a gauge of immediate market demand: a higher spot price means stronger buying interest.\nWhat is \u201cprice spread\u201d in silver trading?\nThe term \u201cprice spread\u201d describes the difference between the buying (ask) and selling (bid) prices for silver. Here\u2019s how those terms are defined.\n- Ask price: the cost to purchase silver.\n- Bid price: the amount you receive when you sell silver.\nA narrower spread indicates high demand.\nHow to invest in silver\nSilver exposure can be achieved through physical ownership or via silver-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs). ETFs let you own a stake in a fund that holds silver, sparing you storage and insurance responsibilities.\nKey silver investment options include:\n- Bullion bars and rounds. These are sold by weight and purity\n- Government-minted silver coins. Iconic examples include American Silver Eagles and Canada\u2019s Silver Maple Leafs, which often trade at premiums for their rarity and backing.\n- Silver jewelry. Custom pieces that fetch prices above equal-purity bullion.\n- Silver mining equities. Stocks in companies extracting silver, offering a sort of indirect investment in silver.\nOn exchanges, bullion and coins must meet a minimum 99.9% purity. Lower-purity silver generally falls into collectible or industrial categories.\nIs it a good time to invest in silver?\nSilver has surged nearly 25% in 2025, hitting its highest levels in over a decade.\nDeciding whether to invest now depends on your unique attitude toward the market. If inflation is top of mind, adding precious metals can be prudent. Or, if you foresee rising industrial applications\u2014such as electronics\u2014demand could potentially push prices even higher.\nCurrent precious metals prices as of 8:15 a.m. ET today\n| Precious metal | Price per ounce |\n|---|---|\n| Gold | $3,546.52 |\n| Silver | $40.88 |\n| Platinum | $1,400.50 |\n| Palladium | $1,145.00 |\n| Gold | |\n|---|---|\n| Price per ounce | $3,546.52 |\n| Silver | |\n| Price per ounce | $40.88 |\n| Platinum | |\n| Price per ounce | $1,400.50 |\n| Palladium | |\n| Price per ounce | $1,145.00 |\nGold remains the benchmark metal, while platinum and palladium exhibit volatility patterns similar to silver due to smaller market caps. Gold\u2019s larger market makes it comparatively stable.\nThe takeaway\nWith economic volatility persistent in the current market, precious metals deserve at least a quick look. Silver\u2019s 2025 performance has outshined gold\u2019s, and many experts forecast the likelihood of seeing further upside, potentially pushing silver to record levels.\nSilver\u2019s lower entry cost compared with gold also makes it an accessible hedge. Whether through physical bullion, ETFs, or mining stocks, you can position yourself to benefit from anticipated silver demand.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat percentage of my portfolio should I allocate to silver?\nMany advisors suggest allocating no more than between 10% and 15% to silver, keeping total precious metal holdings under 20%.\nCan silver be held in an IRA?\nYes\u2014IRA-eligible silver coins and bars (99.9% pure) stored with an IRS-approved custodian qualify. Coins with lower silver content, such as pre-1965 U.S. coins that often have around 90% purity and are known as constitutional silver, aren\u2019t permitted. But of course, silver coins and jewelry that doesn\u2019t hit the 99.9% purity level can still be collected or worn outside of retirement accounts.\nWhat\u2019s driving silver prices in 2025?\nSilver\u2019s ascent this year reflects tight supplies and robust demand from both industrial users and investors."

Gold has a long-term record of appreciating in value. One of the more common ways of buying and holding gold is a gold IRA. It\u2019s also a practical choice for those who want to avoid the cost and burden of storing physical gold.\nHistorical gold price chart\nGold doesn\u2019t outperform traditional stocks in every financial situation. In strong economic climates, stocks can deliver higher returns over both short and long periods. From 1971 to 2024, stocks averaged 10.7% in annual returns, while gold averaged 7.9%.\nBut in uncertain economic times, gold is seen as a safe, risk-averse asset. That\u2019s why many people view it more as a store of value than a typical investment like stocks or bonds.\nWhat does \u201cspot gold\u201d mean?\nThe spot gold price is the rate for immediate transactions when buying gold over-the-counter. This figure helps investors track real-time demand and trends. Simply put, a higher spot price reflects greater demand. Unlike futures, the spot price is for instant settlement.\nWhen the future price is above the spot price, it\u2019s called contango, which is common for commodities with high storage costs. If the futures price is below the spot price, it\u2019s known as backwardation.\nMany factors can affect the spot price, causing frequent changes. Active gold investors need to be prepared for this volatility.\nWhat is price spread in gold trading?\nA price spread is the difference between the buying and selling price of an asset.\nIn gold trading, the ask price is what you pay to buy, and the bid price is what you receive when selling. The bid is always lower than the ask.\nA smaller spread means the market is more liquid.

While you can buy physical bars, coins, or jewelry, gold is often traded as exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nPopular gold investment options include:\n- Gold bars: Also called bullion, sold by weight, with purity and manufacturer details stamped on the bar. Gold rounds are essentially the same, with the only notable difference being the shape of the bullion.\n- Gold coins: Collectible coins like the American Gold Eagle, often priced higher than bars of the same weight due to rarity.\n- Gold jewelry: Priced above gold content for design and craftsmanship.\n- Gold futures contracts: Agreements to buy gold at a set price in the future, allowing speculation without handling the physical metal.\n- Gold funds: Mutual funds or ETFs invested in gold assets, with values tied to the underlying portfolio.\nIs it a good time to invest in gold?\nWhether now is the best time to invest in gold is open to interpretation. Still, adding gold can help diversify your portfolio and reduce market volatility.\nGold remains a steady asset in today\u2019s unpredictable market. Prices have soared to all-time highs, up over 25% since the beginning of 2025, fueled by inflation and uncertainty. Many experts suggest this is a good time to diversify with gold.\nCurrent precious metals prices as of 9:30 a.m. ET today\n| Precious Metal | Price per ounce |\n|---|---|\n| Gold | $3,561 |\n| Silver | $41 |\n| Platinum | $1,420 |\n| Palladium | $1,149 |\n| Gold | |\n|---|---|\n| Price per ounce | $3,561 |\n| Silver | |\n| Price per ounce | $41 |\n| Platinum | |\n| Price per ounce | $1,420 |\n| Palladium | |\n| Price per ounce | $1,149 |\nSilver, platinum, and palladium are also favored by investors. Gold is generally less volatile than silver, which can fluctuate widely in a single day. Silver\u2019s industrial uses make it more responsive to economic changes.\nPlatinum and palladium act similarly to silver. While they offer diversification, they tend to be more volatile than gold.\nAugusta Precious Metals\n| A+ BBB rating, AAA BCA rating \u2013 unmatched trust and credibility |\n| Over 1,000 verified 5-star reviews from real customers |\n| Highest buyback guarantee \u2013 You\u2019re in control.

Thanks to various purchase methods, it\u2019s a relatively accessible asset for most investors. Whether you invest through a gold IRA or a more hands-on account, gold can help you reach both short- and long-term financial targets.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhat is the best way to own gold?\nMany investors choose gold ETFs, which offer a managed portfolio of easily traded assets.\nIs gold a good investment?\nGold is often a solid choice for those seeking diversification and protection from inflation.

      "text": "The current average rate on 5-year adjustable-rate mortgages is 6.87%, according to data from the popular real estate marketplace Zillow. If you\u2019re considering an ARM to buy a home, whether to call your own or as an investment property, read on\u2014we\u2019ll take a look at average rates for a couple ARM types, show you how ARMs work, and explain when such a loan might be worth considering even though fixed-rate mortgages are by far the more popular option.\nYou can see the previous ARM rates report here.\nAverage ARM mortgage rates\nNote that Fortune reviewed the most recent Zillow data available as of Sept. 2.\nFixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages\nFixed-rate home loans account for about 92% of all mortgages in U.S. households. Unlike ARMs\u2014where interest rates can increase or decrease after an initial fixed period\u2014a fixed-rate mortgage guarantees the same rate for the entire loan term. This consistency gives them an obvious appeal.\nHowever, there are situations where ARMs might be worth considering. Roughly 8% of borrowers choose these loans because they see unique advantages.\nWhen you might consider an adjustable-rate mortgage\nThree types of buyers often find ARMs beneficial:\n- Starter home buyers: If you plan to move within a few years, an ARM may let you capitalize on a low initial rate without having to worry about future adjustments, as you intend to sell the home before the fixed period ends.\n- Investors: Real estate investors who intend to flip a house or rent it out may use ARMs to minimize upfront costs, then sell the property or adjust the rent amount when rates change.\n- Buyers facing high-interest markets: During periods of elevated interest rates, ARMs might offer lower upfront costs and may even provide relief later if market conditions improve.\nHow adjustable-rate mortgages work\nARMs typically feature a low fixed interest rate for a predetermined period\u2014such as three, five, seven, or 10 years\u2014followed by periods of adjustment. Factors affecting ARM rates during the adjustments include:\n- Benchmark indices: ARM rates are often tied to benchmarks like the SOFR. The U.S. Treasury publishes an updated SOFR each day, reflecting the overnight costs faced by banks for borrowing cash.\n- Margins: Lenders add margins (fixed percentages) to benchmarks when calculating your ARM\u2019s final rate. These can often range from 2% to 3.5%.\n- Caps: Rate caps limit increases during specific intervals or throughout the loan term (e.g., initial adjustment caps, subsequent caps).\nIn most instances ARMs will be 30-year loans. Popular ARM structures include 5/1 and 10/6\u2014meaning a fixed rate for five years and then annual adjustments, and a fixed rate for 10 years and adjustment periods every six months, respectively. There are also 3/1 ARMs, 7/1 ARMs and 10/1 ARMs.\nLearn more: Why the Secured Overnight Financing Rate might matter for your mortgage.\nCheck Out Our Daily Rates Reports\n- Discover the highest high-yield savings rates, up to 5% for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover the highest CD rates, up to 4.45% for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover the current mortgage rates for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover current refi mortgage rates report for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of gold for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of silver for September 3, 2025.\nRefinancing from an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage\nIf your plans change, you can likely decide to refinance into a fixed-rate mortgage. For instance, say you decide to stay in your home longer than you initially thought you would.\nYou\u2019re not alone if that\u2019s the situation you find yourself in, as many Millennial and Gen Z homeowners can\u2019t afford to upgrade and are getting by with their starter homes.\nMuch like refinancing from one fixed-rate loan to another (which is often done to obtain a better rate or to tap equity) refinancing from an ARM to a fixed-rate loan involves shopping around with lenders, providing documentation to show you meet their requirements, and paying off your existing mortgage.\nPros and cons of adjustable-rate mortgages\nARMs come with positives and negatives you should weigh before applying for this type of mortgage. And, working with a trusted loan officer can help you determine if this is really the right loan type for you. Here are some basics to consider.\nPros\n- Chance for a lower rate at first. During the fixed introductory period, you may find an ARM offers you a lower rate than you could get on a fixed-rate mortgage.\n- Potential for easier qualification. Some borrowers may find they\u2019re more likely to qualify for an adjustable-rate mortgage than for a fixed-rate loan.\n- Possible savings down the road. This is not guaranteed, but if market rates decrease during adjustment periods, your monthly payment might go down accordingly.\nCons\n- Possibility for payments to rise. Remember, adjustment periods are dependent on what\u2019s happening with the market. Just like there\u2019s a chance for your rate and thus your monthly payment to go down, the converse could happen.\n- Hard to comparison shop. Complex terms can make comparison shopping for a good rate on an ARM more difficult than with common fixed-rate mortgage types.\n- Less predictability. Once you take out a fixed-rate mortgage, you\u2019re locked into that rate as long as you have the loan. This can give you a little more stability in terms of monthly payment (though you may still face changes to things like homeowners insurance or your HOA dues). With ARMs, you need a certain level of risk tolerance."

      "text": "You\u2019ve still got time to earn solid returns in a certificate of deposit, but don\u2019t delay. The Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times in 2024, which means average CD yields are well off their recent record highs. While CD rates have stabilized in 2025 as the Fed holds pat, they might begin reducing rates again later this year\u2014possibly as soon as this month.\nCurrently, the best CD rates offer up to 4.45% annual percentage yield. If you fund a certificate of deposit today, you could lock in a higher rate for years, depending on what term length best fits your financial objectives.\nToday\u2019s best CD rates: Earn up to 4.45%\nToday\u2019s highest CD rate of 4.45% is offered by E*TRADE on its six-month CD. Savers can also earn a 4.45% APY on a six-month CD from Bread Savings and a 12-month jumbo CD from My eBanc, but E*TRADE stands out for having no minimum deposit requirement.\nFortune monitors the top rates offered by leading U.S. financial institutions to help readers obtain the best possible return on their CD investments. Here are today\u2019s highest CD rates:\nPro tip\nLooking for the best CD to fit your investment needs? See rates from top institutions:\n\u2013Wells Fargo\n\u2013Capital One\n\u2013Chase\n\u2013Bank of America\n\u2013Discover Bank\n\u2013Northern Bank Direct\n\u2013Ally Bank\n\u2013Newtek Bank\n\u2013Popular Direct\n\u2013Citibank\n\u2013Sallie Mae Bank\nCompare CD rates at top national banks\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with some or all of the institutions on the list above, that\u2019s no accident. Big banks\u2014Chase, PNC, and U.S. Bank, for example\u2014are more focused on products like loans and credit cards rather than certificates of deposit. Consequently, they tend to offer CD rates that can suffer in comparison to smaller regional institutions or online banks.\nCD rates news 2025\nCD investors should understand that market rates are closely tied to Federal Reserve policy decisions, more specifically changes to the fed funds rate. Staying informed about fed interest rate policy is vital for anyone investing in certificates of deposit.\nIn January, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held its first semi-annual meeting of 2025. As expected, the central bank left the fed funds rate unchanged, which suggests that CD rates are likely to remain unchanged for the time being. The most recent FOMC meeting happened July 29-30 and once again there were no changes made to the federal funds rate\u2014the next meeting is set for Sept. 16-17.\nThe Fed cut rates three times in 2024, with the final rate reduction in December fixing fed funds at 4.25%-4.50%. The central bank cut rates to support the economy as inflation finally began to subside after its pandemic surge. As a consequence, CD rates came off their recent highs.\nThe strong average CD yields of 2022 and 2023 were a direct result of the Fed\u2019s post-pandemic rate hike campaign. From March 2022 through July 2023, the FOMC hiked interest rates eleven times, taking fed funds from zero to 5.25%-5.50%. The central bank took action as inflation grew at higher rates than at any time since the 1980s.\nRemember, current CD rates aren\u2019t far off their recent highs. Investors have an opportunity to secure attractive rates on both short-term and long-term certificates. By placing a larger lump sum into your CD account, you can earn substantial interest.\nCheck Out Our Daily Rates Reports\n- Discover the highest high-yield savings rates, up to 5% for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover the current mortgage rates for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover current refi mortgage rates report for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover current ARM mortgage rates report for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of gold for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of silver for September 3, 2025.\nHistorical CD rates\nIn the early 1980s, CD rates surged into double digits, starkly contrasting with today\u2019s lower rates. By 2019, however, the APY for a 5-year CD had slightly exceeded 3.00%.\nThroughout the early 2020s, top rates typically remained below 1.00% APY. In recent years, rates saw a significant increase, with the best offerings surpassing 5.00% APY in 2024. In 2025, however, we are beginning to see rates stabilize and drop below this threshold.\nHow to get a good CD rate\nDetermining what constitutes a good CD rate involves striking a balance between the highest rate available and your willingness to lock your money up for a specified term.\nFor instance, investing a large sum in a five-year CD yielding 5.00% may not be a good choice if you need the money sooner or if you believe interest rates could start rising again. But generally speaking, rates that exceed the national average are considered worthwhile.\nKey factors to consider when comparing CDs include:\n- Term length: Ensure it aligns with your savings goals and timeline.\n- APY: Higher rates typically are offered for longer terms.\n- Minimum deposit: Make sure you can meet the required initial balance.\n- Penalties: Understand the costs associated with withdrawing funds before maturity.\n- Deposit insurance: Verify that the bank is Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)- or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA)-insured for deposit protection.\nNote that online banks typically offer better CD yields\u2014just be mindful of any minimum balance requirements and associated fees. Choosing a bank over a broker can sometimes help avoid unnecessary fees.\nLook into offerings from online banks\nOnline banks and fintech companies generally offer more competitive rates than big national banks. Large financial institutions primarily earn revenue from interest on loans, fees, and investments in securities.\nIn contrast, smaller banks and online fintech companies attract customers with competitive APYs on deposit accounts. Moreover, online banks typically operate with lower overhead costs, allowing them to pass better rates on to their clients.\nSet up a CD ladder\nCD ladders are perfect for savers who are hesitant to commit funds for extended periods of time. By diversifying savings across CDs with different maturity dates, you can benefit from both short-term accessibility and higher long-term interest rates.\nFor instance, say you invest $3,000 in three staggered CDs (1-year, 2-year, and 3-year). As each CD matures, you can reinvest the funds into a new 3-year CD. This approach allows annual access to your money along with the accrued interest.\nSeries on daily CD rates created by former Fortune editor Cassie Bottorff.

      "text": "The current average refinance rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate home loan is 6.58%, according to data from the popular real estate marketplace Zillow. If you\u2019re a homeowner hoping to refinance your mortgage for a lower rate or perhaps to tap home equity, read on to see average refi interest rates for a variety of loan types and terms. You can also see the previous refi rates report here.\nCurrent refi rates data\nNote that Fortune reviewed the most recent Zillow data available as of Sept. 2.\nHow mortgage refinancing works\nMortgage refinancing essentially involves paying off your existing home loan with a new one. Similar to when you applied for a mortgage the first time, you\u2019ll need to apply for the refinance loan and meet lender criteria regarding your credit profile, proof of income, your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio, and more.\nThis process generally means there will be a small hit to your credit score due to the hard inquiry. And, you should be aware there\u2019s a risk of denial if you don\u2019t meet the lender\u2019s requirements.\nWhat\u2019s happening with mortgage rates in today\u2019s market?\nSome observers thought that mortgage interest rates would fall alongside the cuts made by the Federal Reserve to the federal funds rate late last year. However, that didn\u2019t happen, and interest rates remained stubbornly near the 7% mark\u2014considering the nationwide average for 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages\u2014for months.\nRates did drop slightly toward the end of February, moving closer to 6.5% than had been seen in a while. Still, rates remain elevated well above pandemic-era lows, when some homeowners got mortgages with rates in the 2% and 3% range.\nA report from Redfin showed that as of the third quarter of 2024, 82.8% of homeowners carrying a mortgage had an interest rate under 6%. Many Americans remain locked in, unwilling or unable to move or refinance in the current environment.\nCheck Out Our Daily Rates Reports\n- Discover the highest high-yield savings rates, up to 5% for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover the highest CD rates, up to 4.45% for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover the current mortgage rates for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover current ARM mortgage rates report for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of gold for September 3, 2025.\n- Discover the current price of silver for September 3, 2025.\nWhen it might make sense to refinance your mortgage\nRefinancing isn\u2019t free, so it\u2019s crucial to weigh the costs. One rule of thumb you\u2019ll hear referenced is that it makes sense to refi if you can secure a rate at least a percentage point lower than your current rate. For example, if rates drop and you\u2019re able to move from a 7% rate to a 6% rate, that\u2019s worth seriously considering.\nYou might also want to refinance if you need to tap your home equity\u2014this can be done via a cash-out refinance, which typically requires that you have built up at least 20% equity in your home.\nRefinancing can also help change your loan term or switch loan types, such as moving from an FHA loan to a conventional one to get rid of a lifetime mortgage insurance (MIP) requirement, or changing from an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) to a fixed-rate loan.\nIt can also be beneficial to refinance if you want to adjust your loan term. For instance, switching from a 15-year to a 30-year mortgage can provide smaller monthly payments, which might be more manageable if your financial situation has changed from when you took out the loan.\nCosts to refinance your mortgage\nRefinancing involves closing costs, typically ranging from 2% to 6% of the loan amount. For a $300,000 loan, costs might range from $6,000 to $18,000, for example. Some common costs include:\n- Lender origination fees.\n- Appraisal fees.\n- Title search and insurance fees.\n- Loan application fees.\n- Survey fees.\n- Attorney fees (if required in your state).\n- Recording fees.\n- Prepayment penalties (if applicable with your existing lender).\nDifferent types of mortgage refi loans\nSeveral types of refinance options exist, each suited to different goals:\n- Rate-and-term refinance: This is what you\u2019re looking for when you seek to lower your interest rate or change your loan term\u2014though be aware if you shorten your repayment term this will almost certainly result in higher monthly payments.\n- Cash-out refinance: Leverage your home equity by paying off your existing loan and taking out a larger loan, while receiving the difference in cash.\n- No-closing-cost refinance: The lender covers closing costs in exchange for a higher interest rate. This is a refi to approach with educated caution, but could be worthwhile in certain cases.\n- Streamline refinance: Available for FHA, VA, and USDA loans, offering a simpler application process and oftentimes less paperwork.\nRefinancing with your existing lender vs. a new one\nYou\u2019re not required to refinance with your original lender. Shopping around may help you find lower rates and possibly even better service.\nBut, some lenders offer incentives, such as waiving closing costs, for staying with them. So you should broach the topic of refinancing with your existing lender before you make a decision.\nLastly, know that if your mortgage has been purchased by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, you might be eligible for programs like Refi Now and Refi Possible."
