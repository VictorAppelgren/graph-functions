  "title": "Ukraine is keeping soldiers in Western training longer \u2014 betting on skill over mass against Russia",
  "description": "The head of Operation Interflex said he was impressed Ukraine chose to extend the training, as it could have simply said \"we need recruits quickly.\"",
  "content": "\u2022 None Western training for Ukrainian troops was extended at Ukraine's own request.\n\u2022 None The head of the UK-led training deemed it a \"brave\" call as it means fewer get trained.\n\u2022 None He said Ukraine is focusing on quality over mass as it faces the larger Russian force.\n\nUkraine has chosen to keep its soldiers in Western training for longer \u2014 a \"brave\" decision that prioritizes quality over quantity, even as Russia throws waves of poorly trained troops into battle, the head of the UK-led training program told Business Insider.\n\nThrough Operation Interflex, the UK and its allies have trained thousands of Ukrainian troops in Western ways of warfare. At Ukraine's request, the standard course for new recruits was recently extended from five weeks to seven, said Col. Boardman, the program's commanding officer.\n\nBoardman, who the British defense ministry requested be identified only by rank and last name, described Ukraine's choice as \"a very conscious decision in the face of a huge quantitative mismatch to the Russian military,\" which is much larger, with more people and significantly more equipment.\n\nHe said that Ukraine could have pushed for shorter, faster training to rush more soldiers to the front. Instead, it asked for the opposite: Ukraine said, \"Have them for longer, make them better.\"\n\nBoardman said, \"the idea is that they'll be more lethal, more effective when they get back to the front line.\"\n\nBoardman said that Ukraine's decision to hold longer courses means fewer courses in a year, meaning a reduction in the number receiving training. \"That's more than offset by the increased quality of the output,\" he said.\n\nUkraine can't match Russia in force size, so it wants to make the troops it does have as lethal and effective as possible.\n\n\"The Ukrainians have decided to address this by increasing the quality of their training in order to offset the quantitative disadvantage, which I think is a brave decision,\" Boardman said.\n\nHe said that makes a Ukrainian basic recruit \"so much better than a Russian conscript,\" who may have been trained for just a few weeks, if not a few days.\n\nBoardman said Ukraine's emphasis on longer, higher-quality training stands in stark contrast to Russia's.\n\nThere is a big difference \"in the quality of the training,\" he said. \"And that's not praising ourselves. That's in terms of the Ukrainian's approach to the quality of their training, while the Russian training is comparatively short.\"\n\nMany Russian soldiers have been sent to the front line with just days of preparation.\n\nUkraine, by comparison, has steadily extended its training pipeline. Beyond Operation Interflex, Kyiv lengthened mandatory basic training from 30 to 45 days in late 2024, though some support roles were later cut back again to ease pressure.\n\nUkrainian officials have repeatedly emphasized the importance of the quality of training for their troops. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in December, \"It is the quality of training that largely impacts the effectiveness of our soldiers in battles and, of course, it saves the lives of our guys.\"\n\nEven with the extensions, Ukraine's training periods remain far shorter than NATO's \u2014 a reflection of how the grinding war against a much larger adversary forces constant compromise.\n\nThe quantity-versus-quality divide shows up not only in training but also on the battlefield, Boardman said. \"The Russian approach is extraordinarily wasteful of its people,\" he said.\n\n\"It is bludgeoning along using mass to soak up an enormous amount of fire and then to creep forward very slowly, which is not something that any Western military could or would do with its people.\"\n\nRussia has repeatedly been accused by its own soldiers, by Ukrainian troops, and by Western officials of using \"meat grinder\" tactics \u2014 sending wave after wave of barely trained men to die in an attempt to overwhelm defenses.\n\nAdm. Rob Bauer, who was then the chair of the Military Committee of NATO, said in 2023 that the conflict in Ukraine was increasingly a contest between Russia's masses of poorly trained troops with outdated equipment and a smaller Ukrainian military with better Western weapons and training.\n\nA new US Army report in July said Russia had \"reverted to Soviet form on the battlefield, favoring mass over maneuver, quantity over quality, capacity over capability, brutality over precision, and mobilization over readiness.\"\n\nSince 2022, the UK and allied nations have trained more than 56,000 Ukrainians under Operation Interflex, while Ukraine's own academies and General Staff provide additional instruction at home.\n\nBoardman stressed that the program is shaped by Ukraine's requests, with courses adapted to battlefield realities.\n\nThat situation means Western trainers \u2014 who lack the direct experiences of this war \u2014 are teaching Ukrainians who have already fought in it. It's an unusual dynamic, but the Ukrainians clearly see value in the training.\n\nThe result, Boardman explained, is a mixture of NATO-standard training and Ukraine's front-line experience that produces something stronger than either alone.\n\nIt's \"an enormously worthwhile and valid mission\" that supports Ukraine and shows \"it's not okay to just invade another country and try and subjugate the people,\" he said.\n\nThe effort also feeds back into NATO militaries themselves. \"We use their expertise to guide us, but we are not just letting it go past us in the British Army. We are also feeding all that knowledge into the field army, the British Army, all of the contributing nations.\"",

Col. Wilson, the commanding officer for training and delivery at the site, told BI that \"The UK is now investing in its approach for looking at trench warfare.\n\"Elements of digging in have always been part of training, but now there's a more renewed focus on how trench warfare has evolved,\" he said.\nAt the request of the UK Ministry of Defence, the officers featured in this article are only referred to by their surnames.\nBritain helped pioneer trench warfare in World War I, where years of bloody conflict with Germany cost the UK hundreds of thousands of men and left a permanent scar on the nation.\n\"Trench warfare has clearly been around for over a century,\" Wilson said, \"and perhaps it had been consigned to history in some view, but now it's very much back in focus and particularly when you layer that with the drone threat.\"\nDrones have been a defining feature of the war in Ukraine, monitoring the battlefield so totally that soldiers often struggle to move without coming under fire.\nThat's part of the reason there are so many trenches in Ukraine \u2014 they are one of the few places soldiers can hide safely.\nWilson said that Britain had \"not focused\" on trench techniques much in the past decade, where it face a very different kind of foe in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\"So our training then was appropriately focused around that environment, the counterinsurgency,\" he said.\nBecause of Ukraine, \"the extensive use of trenches has brought that again to the fore.\"\nWilson said that his colleagues who train British infantry \"are now looking at trenches, at how we fight against them, but also how we fight from them.\"\nOther NATO members are also training troops on trench warfare, citing its resurgence in the war in Ukraine.\nTrench fighting is also a major focus when the British are training Ukraine's soldiers, some 30,000 of them so far.\nBoth Wilson and another officer, Lt. Col. Davidson, told BI that the British led-training operation, called Operation Interflex, is a mutually beneficial exercise \u2014 Ukraine can ask for help with the skills it most needs, while the UK picks up invaluable tips about fighting Russia.\nDavidson, the Deputy Commander of Operation Interflex, told BI that Britain and the partner countries helping with the training realized early in the program that \"we had doctrine that was dated\" on trench warfare.\nThe Ukrainians were quick to point that out, he said, and the UK changed its offering.\nWilson said the training changes almost in real time.\n\"Things that are happening on the battlefield today, yesterday, we were able to implement some of those changes really quickly.\"\nDavidson said that as the UK and its allies train Ukrainians, \"we're learning as much off of them as they are off of us.\""

      "text": "- The level of training for Russian forces has gotten progressively lower throughout the Ukraine war.\n- A war expert said he's surprised by \"how poor the Russian individual soldier quality is.\"\n- \"The bar is very, very low at this point,\" he said.\nA Ukraine war analyst told Business Insider that while watching this conflict, he's been continually surprised by how poorly trained Russia's soldiers are. Even when he thinks they can't get any worse, they somehow find a way.\n\"I find myself being surprised with the new depths of how poor the Russian individual soldier quality is,\" George Barros, a Russia analyst at the Insitute for the Study of War, a US think tank, said.\nEach batch of new recruits gets progressively worse as Russia rushes them off to battle, he said. \"It's becoming really difficult for me to see what other additional shortcuts they could take, other than maybe deploying just people unfit for service,\" such as people with disabilities or who are too old.\n\"But the bar is very, very low at this point,\" Barros said.\nCaptured Russian soldiers, war experts, Ukrainian troops, and Western intelligence have all pointed to Russian troops being poorly trained and treated as disposable throughout the war.\nThe poor training, coupled with the intensity of the war, has resulted in quick deaths: In October 2022, only one month after Russia announced a mobilization of 300,000 Russian citizens, some of those new soldiers were already dead, having only received days of training before being sent to Ukraine.\nRussia's losses have risen recently as Russian troops continue to suffer from deficiencies in training.\nUS intelligence estimated in December that Russia had lost 87% of the troops it had before the start of its full-scale invasion, meaning it started the new year without the vast majority of its professional army, which had its own problems. It is now largely fighting with a replacement force that's been hastily thrown together.\nRussia's losses, while they have been high since the start of its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, appear to have soared in recent months.\nThe UK Ministry of Defence said in July that more than 70,000 Russian troops were likely killed or wounded between May and June. It blamed \"an effective Ukrainian defense and a lack of Russian training\" as Russia fought in multiple sectors.\nThat rate \u2014 more than 1,100 casualties a day \u2014 appears to have continued, with Ukraine regularly reporting similar Russian losses every day, including 1,140 casualties reported in 24 hours last Wednesday. Business Insider could not independently verify the reported Ukrainian figures.\nIn addition to the poor training Russian troops receive, Barros also said Russia has been running operations at a fast tempo across multiple sectors of the front for almost a year now. It \"has been just sort of sprinting for a very long time,\" he said.\nQuantity, not quality\nIn some ways, Russia's high losses have been part of its strategy: Russia has a much larger population and military than Ukraine, and it can use those soldiers to try and overwhelm Ukraine's forces.\nBarros said that Russia's \"whole theory of victory is based on mass, not individual excellence.\"\nHe said Russia was inspired by the Soviet army victories in World War II. \"They won their wars not because of the individual excellence of soldiers or units,\" Barros said. \"It's because the Soviet Union found a way to be able to wage effective operational war with large masses of essentially uneducated, individually ineffective soldiers, but together with mass, were able to achieve what they needed.\"\nIn its invasion of Ukraine, Russia has repeatedly used \"meat wave\" tactics rooted, in some ways, in the Soviet \"Not a step back!\" doctrine. These brutal Russian tactics have involved sending waves of untrained, poorly equipped soldiers forward to overwhelm Ukrainian positions before sending more skilled soldiers forward.\nRussia has been able to reconstitute and sustain losses, replacing killed or wounded troops with new recruits, but there are challenges. Russia can't take severe losses indefinitely.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has not made any attempt to launch a mass mobilization since 2022. Russia experts and Western intelligence have said the move is a politically risky one that he appears unwilling to take.\nThat limits its pool of new soldiers. Instead, Russia has recruited prisoners, used citizens of allies and partner countries like Cuba, and used men already in military service in a reserve capacity.\nMatthew Savill, a military-strategy expert at the Royal United Services Institute think tank and a former intelligence analyst at the UK Ministry of Defence, told BI that Russia's weak response to Ukraine's attack on its Kursk region, which started last month, may partly be because \"Russian reserves aren't as extensive as we think they are.\""

      "text": "- Since Russia launched its invasion, thousands of Ukrainian soldiers have been trained in the UK.\n- Part of their training involves preparing for urban warfare in a mock village.\n- Business Insider visited the training ground in southern England.\nIn the two years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Ukrainian soldiers, both new recruits and experienced troops, have been receiving training in the UK, from the British military and its allies.\nThe training, which covers multiple types of combat and first aid, also includes urban warfare, which takes place in a mock village in the English countryside.\nBusiness Insider visited the training site where experienced Ukrainian soldiers were being put through their paces.\nUkrainian soldiers are sent to the UK for training.\nAs of November 2023, more than 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers have been trained in the UK since Russia's full-scale invasion began in February 2022.\nPart of their training involves preparing for urban warfare.\nLt. Col. Wilson told BI that urban warfare training has been a \"fundamental part\" of the training given to Ukrainian soldiers since Operation Interflex began.\nHe said this is included in general infantry training but \"it becomes more pertinent now when we talk in the context of the battleground in Ukraine.\"\nAt the request of UK Ministry of Defence, the officers featured in this article are only referred to by their surnames.\nMuch of the fight in Ukraine has taken place in urban areas.\nThe training includes moving through the village and learning how best to take control of it.\nUrban warfare instructions include when and how to cover windows, when to advance and in what order, how to cover each other, which soldier is most at risk at any moment, and what speed to move at.\nSoldiers also train in just the outlines of buildings so their movements can be seen and studied.\nTraining officers put orange tape on the ground to represent buildings' walls, allowing soldiers' movements to be more visible than if they trained inside.\nThe military training also covers other combat techniques, like drone, mine, trench warfare, battlefield first aid, and patrol tactics.\nSoldiers said the training is beneficial despite their experience fighting.\nThe UK trains both new Ukrainian recruits and soldiers who have already been fighting Russia.\nThe soldiers that BI observed and spoke to were experienced men taking part in a 10-week program.\nThey said that despite their deep firsthand experience fighting, the training was still able to improve their skills and allowed them to exchange techniques.\nArtem, 31, has been part of Ukraine's national guard since 2015, the year after proxy fighting with Russia started in Ukraine's east.\nHe said he was still able to learn some \"new drills and skills from the UK Army.\"\nAnother soldier, callsign Local, said his aim \"is to exchange the knowledge and all skills I have, and speak about combat activities I get during the real fight.\"\nThe UK military said training is collaborative, with Ukrainian troops also sharing tactics.\nLt. Col. Davidson told BI that as the trainers in the UK teach their doctrine to Ukrainian troops, the Ukrainian troops also offer their methods and experiences fighting Russia.\nHe said this is \"benefiting\" their soldiers and junior officers who hear those conversations: \"They're actually doubling their education.\"\nHe said that as the UK and its allies train Ukrainians, \"we're learning as much off of them as they are off of us.\"\nThe training focuses on areas Ukraine says it needs.\nDavidson said Ukraine is \"involved the entire way through it. So we only do what they need.\"\nWilson added that the training can change \"with immediate effects\" based on what Ukraine says is happening on the battlefield: \"Things that are happening on the battlefield today, yesterday, we were able to implement some of those changes really quickly.\"\nSoldiers taking part said they have to fight back against Russia.\nArtem said he has to fight for his country and his seven-year-old daughter.\n\"I am a Ukrainian, this is my land and my young daughter is waiting for me,\" he told BI. \"I don't want this horrible life for her.\"\nLocal also said he has to fight for Ukraine: \"We have to do it because it's our mission to have the flag of Ukraine on our territories, to see our flag, to see our fields, to see our home.\"\nThey both urged Ukraine's allies to continue offering support, repeating warnings made by multiple European leaders that if Russia is not defeated in Ukraine it may attack elsewhere in Europe next."

      "text": "A Compendium of Troika Observations on Russia's Special Military Operation\nDownload the full publication here: How Russia Fights: A Compendium of Troika Observations on Russia's Special Military Operations [PDF - 11.6 MB]\nTroika Compendium: Editor's Note\nAcknowledgments\nThis project began as the vision of General Christopher Cavoli when he was the Commanding General, U.S. Army Europe and Africa (CG, USAREUR-AF). He realized that the U.S. Army Foreign Area Officers (FAOs) assigned to the European theater lacked the detailed understanding of the Russian Federation Armed Forces (RF AF) required to advise him and other senior warfighters. During the period from 1991 to 2014, when the United States considered Russia to be a strategic partner, FAO training had shifted its focus away from Russian military capabilities. To address this training gap, GEN Cavoli convened a team of retired Russian-speaking Army FAOs, with a combined total of more than 200 years\u2019 experience working the Russian problem set. We named ourselves \u201cthe Troika,\u201d a Russian word rich in history and symbolism. GEN Cavoli directed us to create a training course for FAOs focused on the RF AF at the operational and tactical levels. This course became the Russian Way of War (RWOW) Flagship.\nAfter a successful pilot course in January 2021, GEN Cavoli tasked us to develop a one-day version of RWOW for his senior leaders, and a one-week version for staff officers, NCOs, and civilians, which we did. When Russia launched its \u201cSpecial Military Operation\u201d (SMO) against Ukraine on 24 February 2022, the Troika watched with rapt attention. We had just completed a flagship course, and our FAO students had planned a notional Russian invasion of Ukraine as part of a course exercise. Our curriculum was based on Russian taktika (doctrine), theory, professional military journals, exercises, and case studies of recent Russian operations in Chechnya, Ukraine, and Syria.\nWe were anxious to see how well our curriculum held up in a real Russian large-scale combat operation. In fact, it held up quite well. Many of our assumptions turned out to be correct. But there were some surprises, and some things we had overlooked.\nThe Troika commenced to update our curriculum in real time. On 25 February 2022, Day 2 of the SMO, we consolidated and organized 24 hours of hasty Troika-internal texts and emails summarizing our observations and sent them to GEN Cavoli via his Special Advisor for Russia. He responded with comments and enough questions to generate another set of \u201cTroika Observations.\u201d\nHe realized the daily Russian Way of War curriculum updates we began sending him in late February 2022 would be of use to his staff, subordinate units, and warfighters throughout the Joint Force. Thus the \u201cTroika Observations,\u201d currently distributed to more than 3,500 email addresses three times per week, were born.\nIn 2024, as Supreme Allied Commander Europe, GEN Cavoli encouraged us to go back through more than 2 years and several thousand pages of raw observations, analyze them, and produce a Compendium organized by U.S. Army Warfighting Functions.\nThe current CG of USAREUR-AF, General Christopher Donahue, enthusiastically supported the idea and suggested the title. Mr. Brendan McAloon, SES, served as our conduit to the command, as well as our Editor-in-Chief. He has read every Troika Observation for more than 3 years, helping us improve our often hastily written observations and ensure they were relevant to the warfighters. He also reviewed several drafts of this Compendium and helped us improve this final product.\nHow Russia Fights: A Compendium of Troika Observations on Russia\u2019s Special Military Operation, First Edition was written under the auspices of the Emergent Threat, Training, and Readiness Capability (ET2RC) contract. The thrice-weekly Troika Observations and future editions of this Compendium will continue under the Service Solutions for Modernization, Analysis, Readiness Capability, Threat, and Training (SSMARTT) contract. The Troika Observations have always been a dialogue with warfighters in the field.\nWe benefit from their feedback, and their requests for information often become research topics for future observations. We see this Compendium in the same vein. We hope to receive feedback from the field, which we will incorporate into future editions.\nWe will also update future editions with observations and insights from 1 July 2024 and beyond. We encourage readers to provide feedback to this email address: troika.compendium.comments@bah.com.\nA project as complex and extensive as this involves many hands, and appreciation is due to many contributors who made it possible. This is a partial acknowledgment of contributors; we will inevitably have omitted some people.\n- Managing Editor and Co-Author: COL (Ret) Ted Donnelly\n- Co-Author: BG (Ret) Kevin Ryan\n- Co-Author: COL (Ret) Tom Butler\n- Co-Author: COL (Ret) Jeff Hartman\n- Co-Author: COL (Ret) Lee Gabel\n- Copy/Technical Editor: Mary Ann Singlaub\n- Graphic Design and Layout: MAJ (Ret) Sean Frerking\nMr. Trent Duncan played an integral role in developing the daily procedures for the Troika Observations in early spring 2022 and pushed out the initial versions.

      "text": "Zelenskyy holds meeting of Staff to address military training quality\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Monday, December 9, convened a meeting of the Staff of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief to discuss the quality of Ukrainian military training, according to the President's evening address.\nHe emphasized that the quality of military training was one of the key topics of discussion. In his opinion, this issue requires significant changes.\n\"Personnel changes have been made specifically to reboot our training system. Oleh Apostol and Mykhailo Drapatyi will be in charge of this. Today, the initial discussion on this topic took place at our Staff meeting,\" the President said.\nZelenskyy instructed to prepare a detailed report on this issue for the next meeting. He also hinted at new personnel changes without specifying who they would involve.\n\"For now, we need to audit what requires immediate changes, identify what needs to be fixed, what needs to be added, and who else needs to be replaced. Everything necessary can be provided, both at the organizational level and financially. It is the quality of training that largely impacts the effectiveness of our soldiers in battles and, of course, it saves the lives of our guys,\" Zelenskyy stressed.\nMilitary leadership changes\nPreviously, RBC-Ukraine reported that Zelenskyy appointed Mykhailo Drapatyi as the new commander of the Ground Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.\nAdditionally, Colonel Pavlo Palisa, commander of the 93rd Brigade Kholodnyi Yar, was appointed Deputy Head of the Presidential Office.\nZelenskyy had earlier announced further rotations within the Defense Forces and the General Staff, explaining that these changes are essential to \"move faster\"."

      "text": "- Western training for Ukrainian soldiers focuses on making \"every shot count.\"\n- Ukraine is at a clear ammunition disadvantage in a very ammunition-heavy fight.\n- The training's commanding officer told BI that Ukrainians are trained to be as \"lethal as possible.\"\nWestern training for Ukrainian soldiers includes trying to make them as \"lethal as possible\" while also preserving ammunition, as they lack the deep ammo stores of their Russian foes.\nCol. Boardman, the commanding officer of the UK-led training program Operation Interflex, told Business Insider that the training is designed to ensure that Ukraine's soldiers use every shot that they have as effectively as possible.\n\"The Ukrainians don't have the luxury of a huge amount of ammunition in the way the Russians do,\" he said. It means Ukraine needs to \"make best use of the ammunition they've got.\"\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine is a grinding fight that has consumed mountains of ammunition. With a much smaller arsenal, Ukraine has often found itself at a disadvantage and grappling with critical shortages.\nFighting effectively while at that disadvantage has been baked into the training, which has been provided by the UK and 13 other allied nations to more than 56,000 Ukrainians.\n\"We are focusing on making sure the soldiers that we train are as lethal as possible,\" Boardman said of the efforts to train them on small arms like rifles\n\"Making every shot count in a literal sense is really important for the Ukrainians,\" he said. \"So we spend quite a lot of time on the range coaching the marksmanship of the guys we're training to make sure that they do make every shot count when they get to the front.\"\nHe explained that they're \"trying to make the soldiers not only able to survive in the environment but also be as lethal, be as effective as they can be.\"\nUkraine has a booming defense industry, but it still gets much of its weaponry and ammunition from Western partners. It's faced shortages as partner stockpiles are strained and as the US, previously a major supplier of war aid, sometimes pauses support amid political drama.\nThose shortages have, at times, meant that Ukraine's soldiers have to ration ammunition, leaving them unable to prosecute targets in their sights, Western soldiers who have fought for Ukraine in this war have told Business Insider.\nBig wars eat up a lot of ammunition\nUkraine's ammunition struggles have been a serious wake-up call for Western militaries, which are closely watching the war to see what sort of weapons and tactics are needed for modern war against a great power adversary.\nWestern countries are sounding the alarm over not having enough ammunition.\nThe West is behind in solving that problem. Last month, the head of the NATO alliance warned that Russia produces as much ammunition in three months as NATO does in a year and called for a \"quantum leap\" in how Europe defends itself.\nBoth large defense companies and startups are trying to solve this issue, but there's a huge gap to bridge.\nThe shortage is just one indication of how this war is different from those the West has experienced in the last few decades. Those have been fights like counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency operations against adversaries that Western militaries had outgunned.\nRussia, by contrast, has one of the world's largest militaries, and the war is one marked by the resurgence of old methods, like trench warfare, along with advanced technology like drones. It is a long and grinding fight with hundreds of thousands of war dead.\nUkraine is experiencing a fight unlike any the West has seen recently and passing lessons to Western partners that are not directly involved. That unusual dynamic is reflected in the Western trainings of Ukrainian soldiers, Boardman said.\nSome of the soldiers trained already have front-line experience. So, for example, when they are being taught trench clearance, they \"know very well how to clear a trench because they were doing it a few weeks ago.\" They sometimes push back on what the instructors tell them to do, saying it won't work in this conflict.\nBoardman said that feedback is welcome.\nWhat happens, he said, is that NATO best practices and the Ukrainians' direct combat experience get combined. There is a \"really rich mutual understanding going on,\" and the training ultimately \"ends up with the sum being much greater than the parts, which is really valuable for us.\"\nBoardman said that even though the UK has \"spent 20 or so years in the counterinsurgency focus,\" the training for Ukrainians is largely similar to what is given to the UK's own basic recruits, just with some specific focuses tailored to their war, like mines, drone warfare, and electronic warfare.\n\"We probably teach them more than we would teach our British Army recruits because our British Army recruits don't go straight to war off the back of their basic training,\" he said.\nBoardman said the UK and its allies benefit from training Ukrainians too, getting direct feedback about how to fight Russia for their soldiers. He said trainers are \"learning a lot from the Ukrainians,\" and \"we are also feeding all that knowledge into the British Army.\"\nBoardman praised Ukraine's soldiers, saying its new recruits pick up on \"how to operate a weapon incredibly quickly.\"\nHe said that Ukraine's military focuses on the quality of its soldiers, choosing that as its strategy because it \"hasn't got the size, the sheer mass of the Russian military.\"\nHe said Ukraine decided to increase the length of Interflex training from 35 days to almost 50.\n\"I'm really impressed, frankly, that they've done that because they could easily have said, 'We need recruits quickly. We just need numbers. Can we shorten the course a bit? Can you get through to us faster?' But they've done the opposite,\" Boardman said."

      "text": "- Ukraine is getting Western help to train its soldiers for the brutal fight against Russia.\n- Many of the trainers have not been in a fight like that, the operation head acknowledged to BI.\n- He said the training combines Ukraine's experience with NATO doctrine to make the best preparation.\nWestern instructors are teaching Ukrainian troops how to fight a war they've never fought themselves, but it works, officials say.\nMore than 56,000 Ukrainian troops have been trained by Western allies under the UK-led Operation Interflex since June 2022, giving Ukraine's soldiers the skills they need to survive and fight in Europe's biggest land war since World War II.\nStrangely, many of the Ukrainian troops who come to training arrive straight from the front lines \u2014 fresh from trench assaults, drone strikes, and days under artillery fire \u2014 while some of the instructors have never fought in a war like the one they came from.\nCol. Boardman, commanding officer for Operation Interflex, told Business Insider that the UK's Ministry of Defence is well aware of this unusual dynamic.\nFar from being a disadvantage, he said, the mix of Western warfighting doctrine and Ukrainian battlefield experience produces tactics that are better than either side's knowledge alone.\n\"I'm conscious of our need to have credibility even though we may not have up-to-date combat experience of this type,\" he said.\n\"But I don't see that as a disqualifying factor, if you like, because I think we do have the institutional credibility and expertise that what we're teaching is genuinely valued, not only at the top end of the Ukrainian military, but right all the way down through to those who actually go through the training.\"\nA different type of war\nThe West hasn't fought a major war against a powerful, industrialized military in decades. Most NATO combat experience in recent memory comes from the counterinsurgency and counterterrorism campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, where Western forces enjoyed air superiority and faced smaller, less-equipped adversaries. Some Interflex trainers weren't even in Iraq or Afghanistan, having joined after those conflicts ended.\nUkraine is battling one of the world's largest militaries in a grinding, high-casualty war with no control of the skies. Russia's relentless artillery fire, missile strikes, and widespread use of drones have reshaped the battlefield in ways NATO has not faced for generations, or in some cases at all.\nFor years, Western militaries were heavily focused on counterinsurgency skills while maintaining a theoretical capability for large-scale war. Boardman acknowledged this, while saying the UK did not lose the capability for major operations: \"I think naturally you do shape yourself for the moment.\"\nNow, Boardman said, there's a renewed focus on combating a well-armed foe. That has meant dusting off tactics such as trench warfare and learning as much as possible from Ukraine's front-line soldiers about emerging threats like exploding drones.\nA win-win scenario\nBoardman said Ukrainian soldiers bring \u201ca lot of valuable military experience\u201d to the training. That experience often challenges NATO\u2019s best practices and leads to adjustments.\nThe Western officials and instructors behind Interflex are \"approaching it with a humility of approach that allows us to provide our opinions and our ideas and our teaching, but also learn from some of the feedback that we get,\" he said.\nFor example, when learning casualty evacuation, Ukrainians sometimes reject NATO's extraction techniques, explaining that in their war, it may be safer to wait until nightfall to move the wounded. In trench warfare lessons, Ukrainians sometimes correct their instructors based on tactics they used in combat just weeks earlier. Those insights are then incorporated into the training.\nBoth sides are learning from the training exercise. Key lessons from Ukraine are feeding directly into Western planning as militaries across Europe prepare for the possibility of a future conflict with Russia. And NATO allies are sharing their skills with Ukraine. Finland, for example, brings forest-warfare expertise to Interflex that Ukraine lacks.\n\"There's no question that's a benefit to the Ukrainians,\" Boardman said.\nHe explained that there is a \"really rich mutual understanding going on\" and that the training program \"ends up with the sum being much greater than the parts, which is really valuable for us.\"\nUkraine\u2019s expertise with drones, particularly the first-person-view attack drones, has been especially valuable, especially considering the changes to the operating environment since Iraq and Afghanistan.\nBoardman said that while the UK has drone operators and instructors, \u201cwe are not currently at war, so we are not developing them at the same pace that the Ukrainians are.\u201d\nHe said Ukraine is \"very good at sharing the understanding with us,\" which also helps the UK and other Western militaries.\nBracing for more war\nBoardman said he recognizes that it can be a bit \"uncomfortable\" for trainers to teach trench assaults without having actually done it personally, but the West has a lot of institutional credibility from past military operations and combat successes that give \"us license, effectively, to do this training.\"\nUkraine, he said, is asking for the training. \"We're not just asking them to come and be trained here; it's Ukrainians who are asking us to do it.\"\nExit interviews show how much Ukraine values the training, Boardman said: \"The overriding theme is one of gratitude for the training that they've been a part of.\" Highlighting the value of the training, Ukraine has requested that it be extended.\nHe said Ukraine places a lot of value on NATO and Western military doctrine because while \"they may have the current battle experience,\" the Ukrainians \"know that we have some of the history, some of the hard-won experience of this in the past.\"\nBut again, the West also sees tremendous value in learning from this war and the Ukrainian experiences.\n\"This isn't a completely charitable activity,\" Boardman explained. \"There is a big benefit to us in doing this that we are learning an awful lot from our engagement with this war.\"\nBoardman said that information and tactics from Ukraine are fed to the UK and allies.\nThe West wants insights from this war, with many European allies fearing Russia may attack elsewhere on the continent. They are closely watching Ukraine to see what kinds of tactics and weaponry they need to adopt for such a conflict.\n\"We want to teach them as much as we can,\" Boardman said of the Ukrainians and the war against Russia. \"We also want to learn from it so we can benefit ourselves.\""

      "text": "- Western training for Ukrainian troops was extended at Ukraine's own request.\n- The head of the UK-led training deemed it a \"brave\" call as it means fewer get trained.\n- He said Ukraine is focusing on quality over mass as it faces the larger Russian force.\nUkraine has chosen to keep its soldiers in Western training for longer \u2014 a \"brave\" decision that prioritizes quality over quantity, even as Russia throws waves of poorly trained troops into battle, the head of the UK-led training program told Business Insider.\nThrough Operation Interflex, the UK and its allies have trained thousands of Ukrainian troops in Western ways of warfare. At Ukraine's request, the standard course for new recruits was recently extended from five weeks to seven, said Col. Boardman, the program's commanding officer.\nBoardman, who the British defense ministry requested be identified only by rank and last name, described Ukraine's choice as \"a very conscious decision in the face of a huge quantitative mismatch to the Russian military,\" which is much larger, with more people and significantly more equipment.\nHe said that Ukraine could have pushed for shorter, faster training to rush more soldiers to the front. Instead, it asked for the opposite: Ukraine said, \"Have them for longer, make them better.\"\nBoardman said, \"the idea is that they'll be more lethal, more effective when they get back to the front line.\"\nA 'brave' decision\nBoardman said that Ukraine's decision to hold longer courses means fewer courses in a year, meaning a reduction in the number receiving training. \"That's more than offset by the increased quality of the output,\" he said.\nUkraine can't match Russia in force size, so it wants to make the troops it does have as lethal and effective as possible.\n\"The Ukrainians have decided to address this by increasing the quality of their training in order to offset the quantitative disadvantage, which I think is a brave decision,\" Boardman said.\nHe said that makes a Ukrainian basic recruit \"so much better than a Russian conscript,\" who may have been trained for just a few weeks, if not a few days.\nDifferent from Russia's approach\nBoardman said Ukraine's emphasis on longer, higher-quality training stands in stark contrast to Russia's.\nThere is a big difference \"in the quality of the training,\" he said. \"And that's not praising ourselves. That's in terms of the Ukrainian's approach to the quality of their training, while the Russian training is comparatively short.\"\nMany Russian soldiers have been sent to the front line with just days of preparation.\nUkraine, by comparison, has steadily extended its training pipeline. Beyond Operation Interflex, Kyiv lengthened mandatory basic training from 30 to 45 days in late 2024, though some support roles were later cut back again to ease pressure.\nUkrainian officials have repeatedly emphasized the importance of the quality of training for their troops. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in December, \"It is the quality of training that largely impacts the effectiveness of our soldiers in battles and, of course, it saves the lives of our guys.\"\nEven with the extensions, Ukraine's training periods remain far shorter than NATO's \u2014 a reflection of how the grinding war against a much larger adversary forces constant compromise.\nThe quantity-versus-quality divide shows up not only in training but also on the battlefield, Boardman said. \"The Russian approach is extraordinarily wasteful of its people,\" he said.\n\"It is bludgeoning along using mass to soak up an enormous amount of fire and then to creep forward very slowly, which is not something that any Western military could or would do with its people.\"\nRussia has repeatedly been accused by its own soldiers, by Ukrainian troops, and by Western officials of using \"meat grinder\" tactics \u2014 sending wave after wave of barely trained men to die in an attempt to overwhelm defenses.\nAdm. Rob Bauer, who was then the chair of the Military Committee of NATO, said in 2023 that the conflict in Ukraine was increasingly a contest between Russia's masses of poorly trained troops with outdated equipment and a smaller Ukrainian military with better Western weapons and training.\nA new US Army report in July said Russia had \"reverted to Soviet form on the battlefield, favoring mass over maneuver, quantity over quality, capacity over capability, brutality over precision, and mobilization over readiness.\"\nUkraine's training\nSince 2022, the UK and allied nations have trained more than 56,000 Ukrainians under Operation Interflex, while Ukraine's own academies and General Staff provide additional instruction at home.\nBoardman stressed that the program is shaped by Ukraine's requests, with courses adapted to battlefield realities.\nThat situation means Western trainers \u2014 who lack the direct experiences of this war \u2014 are teaching Ukrainians who have already fought in it. It's an unusual dynamic, but the Ukrainians clearly see value in the training.\nThe result, Boardman explained, is a mixture of NATO-standard training and Ukraine's front-line experience that produces something stronger than either alone.\nIt's \"an enormously worthwhile and valid mission\" that supports Ukraine and shows \"it's not okay to just invade another country and try and subjugate the people,\" he said.\nThe effort also feeds back into NATO militaries themselves. \"We use their expertise to guide us, but we are not just letting it go past us in the British Army. We are also feeding all that knowledge into the field army, the British Army, all of the contributing nations.\""

The move, praised as a \u201cbrave\u201d decision, aims to produce more lethal, effective soldiers despite fewer recruits per year. Western trainers combine NATO doctrine with Ukrainian battlefield experience, while Ukraine also benefits from the insights gained. This shift reflects a strategic focus on training depth amid ongoing conflict with Russia.",
