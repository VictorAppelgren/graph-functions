Biden\u2019s office announced May 18 that he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that had spread to his bones.\n\nMeanwhile, the Internet conspiracy machine ginned up a dark rumor that Trump had passed away after the White House released a blank schedule showing no public events over Labor Day weekend, sparking hashtags such as #TrumpIsDead\u201d and \u201c#WhereIsTrump to trend on X.\n\nThe president\u2019s thin holiday weekend schedule was announced four days after Trump\u2019s last public appearance during a cabinet meeting Tuesday.\n\nBut Trump-haters\u2019 hopes were dashed when a photo surfaced showing him dressed in a white polo, black pants and his signature red MAGA hat Saturday morning with his granddaughter, Kai Trump, 18, as the duo headed to Trump National golf course in Sterling, Va.\n\nTrump did not appear in front of reporters at the White House on Friday, but he did post to Truth Social about a federal appeals court ruling smacking down his tariffs trade agenda as illegal, warning it would be a \u201ctotal disaster for the country\u201d if the tariffs went away.",

And he must have had a PSA test numerous times before. This is odd,\u201d he added. \u201cI wish him well and hope he has an opportunity for maximizing his quality of life.\u201d\nDr. Steven Quay flagged similar concerns, saying Biden\u2019s type of cancer is the easiest to diagnose when it first starts and progresses.\n\u201cThe PSA blood test shows the rate of cancer cell growth. For even with the most aggressive form, it is a 5-7 year journey without treatment before it becomes metastatic,\u201d he said.\n\u201cMeaning, it would be malpractice for this patient to show up and be first diagnosed with metastatic disease in May 2025,\u201d he continued.\nFollow the latest on Joe Biden\u2019s prostate cancer diagnosis:\n- Biden cancer diagnosis spurs free prostate screenings in NYC \u2014 8 tips for first-timers\n- Biden last underwent common prostate cancer screening in 2014, rep reveals\n- Trump accuses Biden allies of \u2018not telling the facts\u2019 after cancer diagnosis: \u2018Dangerous for our country\u2019\n- Renowned oncologist questions Joe Biden\u2019s prostate cancer diagnosis timeline \u2013 and when treatments possibly started: \u2018Doesn\u2019t make any sense\u2019\n\u201cIt is highly likely he was carrying a diagnosis of prostate cancer throughout his White House tenure and the American people were uninformed.\u201d\nMedical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel also weighed in, telling Fox News that it was surprising Biden\u2019s illness was so aggressive given his high profile.\n\u201cI mean, he must have had the best possible care here. I\u2019m a little taken aback that it\u2019s this far advanced,\u201d he said.\nUrologist Dr. David Shusterman speculated that Biden could have known for some time.\n\u201cThe fact that we just find it at a Gleason nine is just pretty much unheard of in this day and age of medicine,\u201d Shusterman told \u201cNewsNation Prime.\u201d\n\u201cThis is what I typically would see in a VA hospital, where a patient hasn\u2019t had medical attention in 10 years, presents to an emergency room with bone pain, and then they find that it\u2019s metastatic prostate cancer.\u201d\nMeanwhile, President Trump\u2019s son Don Jr. went further in bluntly suggesting the news was hidden.\n\u201cWhat I want to know is how did Dr. Jill Biden miss stage five metastatic cancer or is this yet another coverup???\u201d the first son wrote on Truth Social.\nThe former first lady is not a medical doctor, but is called by the honorific by virtue of receiving a doctorate in education from the University of Delaware.\nBiden\u2019s team disclosed that the diagnosis came after the former commander-in-chief started having urinary symptoms.\n\u201cWhile this represents a more aggressive form of the disease, the cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive which allows for effective management,\u201d his office said.\n\u201cThe President and his family are reviewing treatment options with his physicians.\u201d"

I just missed it. I had like a dead look if you know what I mean. I\u2019m sure the guy was also acting in the moment of heat, in the moment of emotions.\u201d\nSzczerek, CEO of paving company Drogbruk, was allegedly caught on the live broadcast Thursday night apparently snatching the prized memento from young fan Brock\u2019s hands after Majchrzak, also Polish, appeared to be gifting it to the child while signing autographs courtside.\nThe businessman \u2013 who was seen placing the prized hat into his wife\u2019s bag as the devastated young fan protested \u2013 has since deactivated his social media accounts after the incident sparked widespread fury, Spanish outlet MARCA reported.\nSzczerek\u2019s countrymen swiftly blasted him on a Polish job search site as a \u201csack of garbage,\u201d \u201ccommon thief,\u201d \u201cprimitive scammer,\u201d and \u201cshameful jerk.\u201d\n\u201cOnly an ordinary idiot and a jerk could snatch a hat from a child\u2019s hands,\u201d wrote one Gowork.pl user. \u201cYou can\u2019t buy class,\u201d offered another critic.\n\u201cIf the company\u2019s president so unscrupulously stole a child\u2019s hat, if I were a customer, I would no longer use his services\u201d chime in another. \u201cI\u2019d be afraid he\u2019d steal from me too.\u201d\nThe millionaire has since attempted to make amends with the cheated fan and his family, according to Majchrzak.\n\u201cHe also wanted to make things right, so I gave him the credentials for Brock\u2019s mom on the same social media I was using to contact her,\u201d Majchrzak said.\n\u201cSo, maybe he can make things right himself.\u201d\nSzczerek \u2013 an amateur competitive tennis player in Poland \u2014 and was introduced to the sport by his racket-swinging wife Anna, according to Polish outlet Tenis Magazyn.\nFollow along for The Post\u2019s live coverage of the 2025 US Open\nAt their tony home in Kalisz, Poland, the Szcereks boast a private tennis court where they once hosted Polish legend Urszula Radwanska.\n\u201cIt was the most wonderful gift of my life. Our employees came up with the idea, and my husband helped them implement it,\u201d Anna Szcerek told the outlet, adding it was a her birthday gift.\nThe couple, who have two sons, also play competitive doubles tennis together \u2014 but Piotr Szczerek\u2019s prowess has propelled him to the second division of the Kalisz Tennis Association, the outlet reported.\nThe doting pair co-founded Drogbruck in 1999, and was described by the outlet as a leader in the industry.\nIn an interview, he noted that the paving industry was thriving in his country at the time, prompting him and his wife to establish a business in their hometown.\nThe company reportedly sponsors local sports programs and supports Polish tennis players, including Piotr Matuszewski.\nSzczerek could not be reached for comment, and emails sent to his company were not immediately returned.\nBut what began as an ugly incident ended on a brighter note for the slighted boy, when Majchrzak used the \u201cpower of the internet\u201d to track him down and gifted him a signed cap, along with other keepsakes.\nA video posted Saturday to Majchrzak\u2019s Instagram stories shows him reuniting with the overjoyed young fan, who he said was named Brock, and his family \u2013 showering him with gifts, snapping photos, and warmly chatting with them.\n\u201cToday after warm up I had a nice meeting,\u201d the tennis star wrote with a hands up emoji, followed by, \u201cDo you recognize?\u201d and a hat emoji.\nIn the clip, Brock beamed as he placed the hat on his head, proudly showing it off to what appeared to be his mother.\nMajchrzak then shared a photo of himself with the young boy, who was proudly wearing the prized possession.\n\u201cHello World, Together with Brock we wish you a great day!\u201d"
