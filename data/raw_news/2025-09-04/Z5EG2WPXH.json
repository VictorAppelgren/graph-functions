Officials said that more than 200 \u201cNo Right Turns on Red\u201d signs have been placed at these designated intersections.\n\nThe Montgomery County Department of Transportation said that it started installing these signs over the summer and has since completed installation.\n\nRoad worker struck by car on MD 200 in Silver Spring: Officials\n\n\u201cWe are eliminating right turns at red lights in our busy downtown areas where we know many residents walk, bike, or scooter to shops, restaurants, and other amenities,\u201d County Executive Marc Elrich said in the news release. \u201cWith the Safe Streets Act, we are taking action to ensure our streets are safe for pedestrians and cyclists when going to school, to work, or while enjoying our downtown areas. I was pleased to sign into law this bill, which was passed unanimously by County Council.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo many residents are being injured while lawfully crossing the street, with nearly 60% of all pedestrian- and cyclist-involved crashes occurring at intersections,\u201d Councilmember Evan Glass, Chair of the Transportation and Environment Committee, said in the release.\n\nGlass took the lead in introducing and spearheading the legislation.\n\nNeighboring districts \u2014 including D.C. and parts of Arlington, Va. \u2014 have similar restrictions on right turns at red lights.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.
