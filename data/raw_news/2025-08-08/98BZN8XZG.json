      "text": "Alleged mushroom murderer Erin Patterson faked cancer to lure victims, prosecutors say\nSYDNEY, April 30 \u2013 An Australian woman accused of murdering three of her estranged husband\u2019s elderly relatives by poisoning their food, faked a cancer diagnosis to lure the victims to a meal, prosecutors claimed on Wednesday, in a case that has gripped the country.\nErin Patterson, 50, is charged with the July 2023 murders of her mother-in-law Gail Patterson, father-in-law Donald Patterson and Gail\u2019s sister Heather Wilkinson, along with the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson, Heather\u2019s husband.\nAll four fell ill after a lunch of Beef Wellington, mashed potatoes and green beans, the court was told. Prosecutors said the accused knowingly laced the meal with deadly death cap mushrooms at her home in Leongatha, a town of around 6,000 people some 135 kilometers (84 miles) from Melbourne.\nErin Patterson denies the charges.\nDefending Patterson, barrister Colin Mandy told the court the deaths were a \u201cterrible accident,\u201d and that the accused had no intention of killing her lunch guests.\n\u201cThe defense case is that Erin Patterson did not deliberately serve poisoned food to her guests,\u201d he said.\nIn the opening arguments that began on Wednesday, prosecutor Nanette Rogers said the accused had fabricated a cancer diagnosis and hosted the lunch on the pretense of discussing the best way to tell her two children about the illness, in order to ensure they did not attend.\n\u201cIt is the prosecution case that the accused deliberately poisoned (the victims) with murderous intent,\u201d she told the court.\n\u201cThe prosecution will not be suggesting that there was a particular motive to do what she did,\u201d she said.\nSEPARATE PLATES\nThe guests ate individual portions of Beef Wellington off four large grey dinner plates, while the accused ate from a smaller, tan colored plate, the court heard.\nThe guests fell ill later that day and were hospitalized a day after, where three later died. Ian Wilkinson spent weeks in hospital and survived.\nThe accused went to hospital two days later, where she initially discharged herself against medical advice, the court was told.\nShe had mild symptoms of illness, but further tests revealed no evidence of toxins consistent with death cap poisoning, the prosecution said.\nThe accused resisted attempts by doctors to have her two children tested, who she claimed had eaten leftovers of the lunch, saying she did not want to frighten them, Rogers said.\n\u201cShe was reluctant to have the children medically assessed, because she knew that, like her, they had not eaten any poisoned food,\u201d she said.\nThe defendant denied ever owning a food dehydrator, but police traced one owned by her to a nearby garbage dump, that was later found to contain death cap mushrooms, Rogers said \u2013 one of the world\u2019s deadliest strains of mushrooms.\nMandy said his client had lied repeatedly during the investigation, but had \u201cpanicked\u201d due to the intense scrutiny surrounding the case.\nINTENSE INTEREST\nErin Patterson married her husband Simon in 2007 and had two children together, the court heard.\nThey separated temporarily several times, before splitting permanently in 2015. They remained amicable, sharing custody of the children and going on family holidays together.\nThat changed in 2022 when Simon listed himself as separated on a tax return, Rogers said, with communication deteriorating and the pair disagreeing over child support.\nThe trial has seen intense interest from local and international media, with podcasters, journalists and documentary-makers descending on the town of Morwell, around two hours east of Melbourne, where the trial is being heard.\nThe court is expected to hear the first of dozens of witnesses and scientific experts on Thursday.\nThe trial, scheduled to run until early June, continues."

The jurors will remain secluded until they reach a unanimous decision on the charges of murder and attempted murder.\nThree of Patterson\u2019s four lunch guests \u2014 her parents-in-law Don and Gail Patterson, and Gail\u2019s sister Heather Wilkinson \u2014 died in the hospital after the 2023 meal, at which she served individual beef Wellington pastries containing death cap mushrooms. The fourth, Heather\u2019s husband Ian Wilkinson, became gravely ill but survived.\nPatterson, 50, told the trial she didn\u2019t deliberately poison her guests and must have accidentally mixed up store-bought and wild mushrooms, which she had foraged herself without knowing they were death caps. She also said she ate the mushrooms but didn\u2019t get as sick because she threw up soon after the lunch due to an eating disorder.\nProsecutors in the case, which has gripped Australia for two years, said the accused woman researched, foraged and served the mushrooms deliberately and lied to investigators to cover her tracks. Patterson accepted she had disposed of a food dehydrator after the fatal meal and reset her phone multiple times.\nThe prosecution said she lied about having a dire medical diagnosis to ensure her guests attended the lunch, cooked individual pastries to avoid poisoning herself, and faked symptoms to make it look as though she fell ill, too.\nProsecutors didn\u2019t offer a motive but suggested a deteriorating relationship between the accused and her estranged husband, Simon Patterson, as well as her exasperation with her former in-laws. Simon Patterson was invited to the fatal lunch but didn\u2019t go.\nPatterson would face life in prison if she is convicted."

      "text": "Millionaire Texas rancher fatally gored by buffalo during South Africa hunting trip\nA millionaire Texas ranch realtor was gored to death by a massive buffalo that he was stalking while on a hunting trip in South Africa, according to reports.\nAsher Watkins, 52, was tracking a 1.3-ton Cape buffalo in Limpopo on Sunday when the beast charged at him, killing him instantly, Coenraad and Vermaak Safari, which organized the trip, told multiple outlets.\nThe buffalo was not wounded, the safari said.\n\u201cIt is with deep sadness and heavy hearts that we confirm the tragic death of our client and friend Asher Watkins from the USA,\u201d Coenraad and Vermaak Safari said in a statement to Metro.\n\u201cHe was tracking it together with one of our professional hunters and one of our trackers. This is a devastating incident, and our hearts go out to his loved ones,\u201d the company said.\nWatkins\u2019 mom, Gwen, stepdad, and brother Amon were waiting for him at a safari lodge when the brutal incident unfolded, the outlet reported.\nHe was the head of Watkins Ranch Group, a successful brokerage company that sells multimillion-dollar ranches in Texas, Oklahoma and Arkansas, according to the company\u2019s website.\nThe affluent rancher was active in the Dallas Safari Club and avidly hunted birds and other wildlife, according to several social media posts where he boasted about his hunts.\nWatkins was raised in Dallas, where he worked on his family\u2019s hunting and cattle ranch, according to his company biography.\nHis ex-wife, Courtney, and their teenage daughter, Savannah, were also notified of his tragic death.\n\u201cThis photo is from another time, another chapter of our lives \u2014 but it\u2019s one that will always be a part of our daughter\u2019s story,\u201d Courtney wrote alongside an old photo with their daughter that has since been deleted, according to the outlet.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been in a state of shock and heartbreak ever since, trying to process not just the loss, but the complexity that comes with it,\u201d she said.\nCape buffalo can weigh over 2,000 pounds and reach a height of 5.5 feet at the shoulder, according to wildlife experts.\nThe species is notoriously ill-tempered, especially when wounded, and often moves in herds of up to 500 animals."

      "text": "Australian woman on trial for mushroom murder of in-laws claims she was trying to fix a \u2018bland\u2019 lunch\nBefore Erin Patterson\u2019s in-laws and their relatives arrived at her home for lunch, she bought pricey ingredients, consulted friends about recipes and sent her children out to a movie.\nThen, the Australian woman served them a dish containing poisonous death cap mushrooms \u2014 a meal that was fatal for three of her four guests.\nWhether that was Patterson\u2019s plan is at the heart of a triple murder trial that has gripped Australia for nearly six weeks.\nProsecutors in the Supreme Court case in the state of Victoria say the accused lured her guests to lunch with a lie about having cancer, before deliberately feeding them toxic fungi.\nBut her lawyers say the tainted beef Wellington she served was a tragic accident caused by a mushroom storage mishap. She denies murdering her estranged husband\u2019s parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and their relative, Heather Wilkinson.\nThe mother of two also denies attempting to murder Heather\u2019s husband Ian Wilkinson, who survived the meal. In a rare step for a defendant charged with murder, Patterson chose to speak in her own defense at her trial this week.\nOn Wednesday, she spoke publicly for the first time about the fateful lunch in July 2023 and offered her explanations on how she planned the meal and didn\u2019t become sick herself.\nAdding more mushrooms to a \u2018bland\u2019 meal\nNo one disputes that Patterson, 50, served death cap mushrooms to her guests for lunch in the rural town of Leongatha, but she says she did it unknowingly.\nPatterson said Wednesday she splurged on expensive ingredients and researched ideas to find \u201csomething special\u201d to serve. She deviated from her chosen recipe to improve the \u201cbland\u201d flavor, she said.\nShe believed she was adding dried fungi bought from an Asian supermarket from a container in her pantry, she told the court.\n\u201cNow I think that there was a possibility that there were foraged ones in there as well,\u201d she told her lawyer, Colin Mandy. Patterson had foraged wild mushrooms for years, she told the court Tuesday, and had put some in her pantry weeks before the deaths.\nThe accused says she \u2018shouldn\u2019t have lied\u2019 about cancer\nPatterson, who formally separated from her husband Simon Patterson in 2015, said she felt \u201churt\u201d when Simon told her the night before the lunch that he \u201cwasn\u2019t comfortable\u201d attending.\nShe earlier told his relatives that she\u2019d arranged the meal to discuss her health. Patterson admitted this week that she never had cancer \u2014 but after a health scare, she told her in-laws she did.\nIn reality, Patterson said she intended to have weight loss surgery. But she was too embarrassed to tell anybody and planned to pretend to her in-laws that she was undergoing cancer treatment instead, she said.\n\u201cI was ashamed of the fact that I didn\u2019t have control over my body or what I ate,\u201d a tearful Patterson said Wednesday. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell anybody, but I shouldn\u2019t have lied to them.\u201d\nPatterson says she threw up her mushroom meal\nThe accused said she believes she was spared the worst effects of the poisoned meal because she self-induced vomiting shortly after her lunch guests left. She had binged on most of a cake and then made herself throw up \u2014 a problem she said she had struggled with for decades.\nPatterson also said she believes she had eaten enough of the meal to cause her subsequent diarrhea. She then sought hospital treatment but unlike her lunch guests, she quickly recovered.\nAt the hospital where her guests\u2019 health was deteriorating, her estranged husband asked her about the dehydrator she used to dry her foraged mushrooms, she said.\n\u201cIs that how you poisoned my parents?\u201d she said Simon Patterson asked her.\nGrowing afraid she would be blamed for the poisoning and that her children would be taken from her, Patterson said she later disposed of her dehydrator. She told investigators she\u2019d never owned one and hadn\u2019t foraged for mushrooms before.\nWhile still at the hospital, she insisted she\u2019d bought all the mushrooms at stores even though she said she knew it was possible that foraged mushrooms had accidentally found their way into the meal.\nShe was too frightened to tell anyone, Patterson said.\nAlso later, Patterson said she remotely wiped her cell phone while it sat in an evidence locker to remove pictures of mushrooms she\u2019d foraged.\nProsecutors argued in opening their case in April that she poisoned her husband\u2019s family on purpose, although they didn\u2019t suggest a motive. She carefully avoided poisoning herself and faked being ill, they said.\nThe trial continues on Thursday with Patterson\u2019s cross-examination by the prosecutors. If convicted, she faces life in prison for murder and 25 years for attempted murder."

Heather\u2019s husband, Ian Wilkinson, was gravely ill but survived.\nPatterson\u2019s lawyer earlier told the Supreme Court trial that the poisoning was a tragic accident but prosecutors said it was deliberate. If convicted, she faces a sentence of life imprisonment on the murder charges and 25 years in jail for attempted murder.\nLong queues formed outside the Latrobe Valley Courthouse on Tuesday after Patterson took the stand late Monday, which was the first time she had spoken publicly since the deaths.\nAccused foraged mushrooms for years\nDuring several hours of evidence on Tuesday, Patterson, 50, told the court she began foraging fungi during the COVID-19 lockdown of March 2020, witnessed only by her children.\n\u201cI cut a bit of one of the mushrooms, fried it up with some butter and ate it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey tasted good and I didn\u2019t get sick.\u201d\nPatterson said she also fed foraged mushrooms to her children, chopped up \u201cvery, very small\u201d so they couldn\u2019t pick them out of curries, pasta and soups.\nShe developed a taste for exotic varieties, joined a \u201cmushroom lovers\u201d Facebook group, and bought a dehydrator to preserve her finds, Patterson said. Her lawyer, Colin Mandy SC, asked if she accepted that the beef Wellington pastries she had served to her lunch guests in 2023 contained death caps.\n\u201cYes, I do,\u201d said Patterson.\nThe accused told her lawyer most of the mushrooms she used that day came from local supermarkets. She agreed she might have put them in the same container as dehydrated wild mushrooms she had foraged weeks earlier and others from an Asian food store.\nMandy in April told the court his client had lied when she initially told investigators that she had never foraged before. But he denied that she had deliberately sought out death cap mushrooms and said she disposed of her dehydrator in a panic about the accidental deaths.\nRegrets over \u201cventing\u201d messages about in-laws\nEarlier Tuesday, Patterson became tearful when she was asked about expletive-filled messages she had sent about her in-laws in December 2022 in a Facebook group chat that she described as a \u201csafe venting space\u201d for a group of women.\n\u201cI wish I\u2019d never said it. I feel very ashamed for saying it and I wish that the family didn\u2019t have to hear that I said it,\u201d said Patterson. \u201cThey didn\u2019t deserve it.\u201d\nPatterson, who said she had tried to have her parents-in-law mediate a dispute with her estranged husband, Simon, about school fees, said she was feeling hurt, frustrated and \u201ca little bit desperate.\u201d\nThe couple formally separated in 2015 after earlier temporary splits, the court has heard. Simon Patterson was invited to the July 2023 lunch but did not attend.\nAccused said she was still close with husband\u2019s family\nTuesday\u2019s evidence also traversed Patterson\u2019s health after prosecutors\u2019 suggestions that her lunch invitation was unusual and that she\u2019d organized it on a false pretense of receiving a cancer diagnosis. The mother of two admitted she never had cancer, but had been worried enough by symptoms to seek tests.\nDespite her separation from Simon, Patterson said she had hoped to reunite with her estranged husband and said she had remained close to her in-laws.\n\u201cIt never changed. I was just their daughter in law,\u201d said Patterson, through tears. \u201cThey just continued to love me.\u201d\nEvidence follows lengthy prosecution case\nThe 14-member jury has heard five weeks of prosecution evidence, including what the lunch guests told relatives before they died. Heather Wilkinson said shortly before she died that Patterson ate her individual beef wellington pastry from a different colored plate to the other diners, said prosecutor Nanette Rogers.\nOpening her case in April, Rogers said the poisoning was deliberate but that her case would not suggest a motive for the alleged killings. The prosecution says Patterson lied when she told investigators she had eaten the same meal as her guests and fed her children the leftovers.\nPatterson is due to continue giving evidence on Wednesday. Her evidence Tuesday did not include her account of the day of the lunch, or cross-examination from prosecutors."

      "text": "Manhattan-sized interstellar object could be alien probe here to \u2018destroy us\u2019: Harvard scientist\nA Harvard physicist has asserted that new images of the Manhattan-sized interstellar object rocketing through our inner solar system back his claim that it\u2019s not a comet \u2014 but instead possibly an alien probe that may \u201cdestroy us.\u201d\nDr. Avi Loeb is pointing to apparent smoking guns emanating from 31/ATLAS \u2014 the object discovered in early July motoring past Earth which NASA officials have deemed a simple, though aberrational, comet.\n\u201cUsually, for comets, you see a tail trailing behind the object,\u201d Loeb told CNN Thursday.\n\u201cHere, the glow is actually in front of it. We\u2019ve never seen such a thing. A comet doesn\u2019t glow in front.\u201d\nLoeb then called the glow \u201cpuzzling\u201d in a blog post and implied that the object could be directed by an intelligent species with their sights set on our pale blue dot.\n\u201cIt may come to save us or destroy us. We\u2019d better be ready for both options and check whether all interstellar objects are rocks.\u201d\nLoeb cited two new images from The Hubble Space Telescope that show a concentration of light in front of the interstellar rock.\nThe images, taken on July 21, represent the most recent publicly available data on the 31/ATLAS.\nIn a blog post Wednesday, the theoretical astrophysicist wrote, \u201cThe existence of a glow ahead of 31/ATLAS but no evidence of gas molecules is puzzling.\u201d\nLoeb further reiterated claims made in a paper last month regarding the object\u2019s suspiciously specific flight path through our inner solar system.\n\u201cIt lies in the plane of the orbits of the planets around the sun to within five degrees,\u201d Loeb explained to CNN.\n\u201cIt will arrive closest to the sun when the Earth is on the opposite side. We won\u2019t be able to observe it. But that\u2019s the perfect time for it to maneuver.\u201d\nIn his recent paper, Loeb suggested that the pathway is ideal for observing and measuring the motion of the spheres in our solar system.\nThe object will come closest to the sun on Halloween and the intervening time will provide the best opportunity to glean information from the object.\n\u201cWe will have a better assessment of this probability within a month or two, once 31/ATLAS gets brighter and easier to observe as it approaches the Sun,\u201d Loeb wrote in a blog post last week.\nCongresswoman Anna Paulina Luna (R-Fla) is answering Loeb\u2019s calls for increased and vigilant observation of 31/ATLAS.\n\u201cI\u2019m urging NASA to extend the Juno mission to study interstellar object 31/ATLAS,\u201d Rep. Luna wrote on X last week.\n\u201cThank you Avi Loeb for your continued dedication to exploring our universe. We must seize this opportunity for groundbreaking discovery.\u201d"

Mixed it into chocolate brownies yesterday, the kids had no idea\u201d Patterson wrote in a message to the group.\nPatterson, a mother-of-two, is accused of the July 2023 murders of her mother-in-law Gail Patterson, father-in-law Donald Patterson and Gail\u2019s sister Heather Wilkinson, along with the attempted murder of Ian Wilkinson, Heather\u2019s husband.\nThe victims all fell ill after being served beef Wellington, with prosecutors claiming Patterson knowingly laced the meal with deadly death cap mushrooms.\nFacebook friends and fellow armchair detectives Christine Hunt, Daniela Barkley, and Jenny Hay said Patterson often shared photos of the dishes she prepared for her family, including pictures of a dehydrator in her kitchen that was exclusively used for mushrooms.\nPatterson had denied ever owning a food dehydrator, but police traced one that she owned to a nearby garbage dump containing death cap mushrooms.\nBarkley told the court that Patterson had once asked the group for advice on preparing beef Wellington, with Hay giving the online friend some tips to make sure it wouldn\u2019t come out soggy.\nThe online friends also claimed Patterson often complained about her husband, Simon, accusing him of being \u201ccontrolling\u201d and \u201ccoercive\u201d in their relationship.\nHunt, who described Patterson as a \u201creally good researcher\u201d and a \u201csuper sleuth,\u201d said Patterson also complained about dealing with Simon and his family\u2019s religious beliefs given she was an atheist.\nPatterson has denied the allegations that she deliberately served poisoned food to her guests, with her defense attorney saying the deaths were a \u201cterrible accident.\u201d\nThe court previously heard how Simon\u2019s family ate individual portions of beef Wellington off four large grey dinner plates, while the accused ate from a smaller, tan-colored plate.\nProsecutors also claimed that Patterson faked a cancer diagnosis to lure the victims to her home for the deadly meal."
