  "title": "The recent 3.5% gain must have brightened CEO Francesco Siccardi's week, Medacta Group SA's (VTX:MOVE) most bullish insider",
  "description": "SWX:MOVE 1 Year Share Price vs Fair Value Explore Medacta Group's Fair Values from the Community and select yours Key...",
  "content": "Explore Medacta Group's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\u2022 The top 3 shareholders own 60% of the company\n\nThis technology could replace computers: discover the 20 stocks are working to make quantum computing a reality.\n\nA look at the shareholders of Medacta Group SA (VTX:MOVE) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 70% stake, individual insiders possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nAs a result, insiders scored the highest last week as the company hit CHF3.1b market cap following a 3.5% gain in the stock.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Medacta Group.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Medacta Group?\n\nMany institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Medacta Group. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Medacta Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.\n\nWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Medacta Group. The company's CEO Francesco Siccardi is the largest shareholder with 20% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are Alessandro Siccardi and Maria Siccardi Tonolli, with an equal amount of shares to their name at 20%. Note that two of the top three shareholders are also Senior Key Executive and Member of the Board of Directors, respectively, once again pointing to significant ownership by company insiders.\n\nA more detailed study of the shareholder registry showed us that 3 of the top shareholders have a considerable amount of ownership in the company, via their 60% stake.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.",
