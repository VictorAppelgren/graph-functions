  "title": "Tropical Storm Erin update as path shifts south",
  "description": "Erin is expected to develop into a hurricane later this week and could affect Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the northern Leeward Islands.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center (NHC) has warned that Tropical Storm Erin could move, causing impacts to Puerto Rico, the Virgin Island and the northern Leeward Island over the weekend, though the agency said the magnitude of any potential impacts was unclear.\n\nMeteorologists have indicated that Erin has the potential to become the first major hurricane of the 2025 season.\n\nEris is the fifth named system of the Atlantic season so far, following Andrea, Barry, Chantal, and Dexter. Chantal brought heavy rain and flooding to North Carolina in early July.\n\nNone of the previous named storms developed into hurricanes.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nIn a video update posted to social media on Tuesday, NHC warning coordination meteorologist Robbie Berg said that Erin was located over the eastern Atlantic and was expected to move west and strengthen into a hurricane, potentially moving to the north of the Leeward Islands.\n\n\"The track forecast has shifted a bit to the south. That does potentially increase the risks to the islands as we head into the weekend,\" Berg said.\n\n\"We now have about a 25 to 30 percent chance of tropical storm-force winds on some of those islands. So now is the time to start thinking about getting some supplies ready just in case the storm is to move a little bit closer.\"\n\nNHC said there was \"even greater uncertainty\" regarding any potential impacts to the Bahamas and the east coast of the U.S.\n\nIn its most recent public advisory for Tropical Storm Erin, NHC said the system was moving west at around 20 miles per hour, with maximum sustained winds near 45 mph.\n\nThe agency said Erin was \"likely\" to become a hurricane by late Thursday or early Friday.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nMeteorologist Brooks Garner said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, on Wednesday: \"Tropical Storm Erin continues to battle Saharan Dust slowing its development. It's now expected to become a hurricane a day or two later than initially forecast, but it's still expected to become a 'Major' Cat 3. Models persist it will curve out to sea next week.\"\n\nABC7 New York meteorologist Brittany Bell said on X, Wednesday: \"Here's the latest track for Tropical Storm Erin. The latest trends continue to show it curving north in the Atlantic, but it will bring rough surf and rip currents next week along our coastline.\"\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nThe Atlantic hurricane season runs from June through November, while the eastern Pacific hurricane season began on May 15 and lasts until November 30.\n\nNHC says that August and September are typically the busiest months of the Atlantic season.",

Inconsistencies may occur.\nThe threat of flooding was expected to persist for parts of the East Coast as Tropical Depression Chantal was forecast to continue its movement across the eastern U.S. on Monday.\nWhy It Matters\nTropical Storm Chantal was the third named storm of the Atlantic Hurricane season after storms Andrea and Barry in June. It has since been downgraded to tropical depression status.\nThe system made landfall along the South Carolina coast early on Sunday morning, bringing strong winds and heavy rain. Flood watches were in place from the National Weather Service (NWS) for parts of Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware as of early Monday morning.\nWhat To Know\nThe Weather Prediction Center (WPC) said in an update late Sunday night that the system was moving northeast around 12 miles per hour and this motion was expected to continue \"with an increase in forward speed\" on Monday.\nHeavy rainfall and flash floods were possible in Virginia on Monday, the agency said.\nThe WPC added that \"life threatening\" surf and rip current conditions would likely persist along the U.S. East Coast, from northeastern Florida to the mid-Atlantic, for the next day or so.\nRainfall totals of 7 to 8 inches have been recorded west of Durham, North Carolina, spanning the area between Goldston, Burlington, and Caldwell, according to the WPC.\nLocal outlets reported severe flooding in the state, with state of emergencies declared in Moore and Orange Counties.\nWRAL News reported that dozens were rescued in Durham County after rains caused the Eno River to overflow. Floodwaters also prompted the closure of multiple roads and highways, including parts of the I-40 and I-85 in Orange County, it said.\nAccording to WNCN, at least two water rescues were carried out in Moore County on Sunday, with road closures due to flooding along the U.S. 1 in Aberdeen and N.C. 5.\nWhat People Are Saying\nAccuWeather lead hurricane expert Alex DaSilva said: \"This was a classic example of homegrown development, by which a tropical storm formed close to the southeast Atlantic coast and in an area where it is typical for July.\"\nA spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Transportation told Newsweek on Monday: \"The closures are mainly on the secondary road system with some primary closures reported, all in central NC and most of them being in the north-central counties. The Haw River flooded I-40/85 in Alamance County and a clogged drain resulted in flooding on the interstate just east of there, in Orange County. Both sections reopened this morning after maintenance and bridge teams completed inspections to ensure the areas were safe for travel \u2026\n\"River levels are dropping significantly today, aided by no additional precipitation. We expect to see significant improvement in the next 24 hours.\"\nMeteorologist Will Haenni said on X, Sunday: \"More flash flooding ongoing in a different part of the country tonight. A dangerous situation is playing out in central North Carolina, near Chapel Hill. Radar estimating pockets of double digit rainfall thanks to the remnants of Tropical Storm Chantal. Turn around, don't drown!\"\nMeteorologist Jacob Lanier said on X, Sunday: \"More major flash flooding occurring tonight, but in North Carolina. Tropical Depression #Chantal has dropped over 6\" of rain west of Raleigh-Durham with rapidly rising river levels. Several water rescues reported around Chapel Hill.\"\nWhat Happens Next\nAccording to forecasters at AccuWeather, a continued weakening of winds into early this week will bring coastal hazards to an end.\nUpdate, 7/8/2025, 12:10 p.m. ET: This article was updated with comment from a North Carolina Department of Transportation spokesperson.\nAbout the writer\nJoe Edwards is a Live News Reporter based in Newsweek's London Bureau.

DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK ---------------------- At 1100 AM AST (1500 UTC), the center of Tropical Storm Erin was located near latitude 16.3 North, longitude 43.4 West. Erin is moving toward the west near 17 mph (28 km/h). This general motion is expected to continue into Thursday, with a west-northwestward motion beginning Thursday night and continuing into the weekend. On the forecast track, the center of Erin is likely to move near or just north of the northern Leeward Islands over the weekend. Maximum sustained winds are near 45 mph (75 km/h) with higher gusts. Gradual strengthening is forecast to begin later today or tonight, and Erin is expected to become a hurricane by Friday. Tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 60 miles (95 km) from the center. The estimated minimum central pressure is 1004 mb (29.65 inches). HAZARDS AFFECTING LAND ---------------------- SURF: Swells generated by Erin will begin affecting portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by this weekend. These swells are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions. Please consult products from your local weather forecast office.
