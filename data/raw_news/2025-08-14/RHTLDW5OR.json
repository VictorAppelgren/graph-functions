  "title": "Exchange Operator MIAX Jumps 33% After $345 Million IPO",
  "description": "Miami International Holdings Inc. rose 33% from its initial public offering price as the exchange operator became the most recent financial services business to get a warm welcome in its trading debut. Miami International Holdings Chairman and CEO Thomas Gallagher has more on the story. \n\n (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "Congratulations. IPO price is $23. You went public and open for trading at 3165, bouncing around now. But essentially you raised $345 million. Are you happy enough? I'm very happy. I'm very happy. I'm happy how the stock opened. I'm happy about the the way the whole roadshow went. And I'm happy about the opportunity that being a publicly traded exchange gives us. So I'm very excited for today, Vonnie. Now, you did get a nice bump. Any concerns that you might have left some money on the table? No. No concerns at all. You know, we've raised a lot of capital prior to going public, and I want our shareholders to enjoy some upside in our stock. So I was very pleased with the pricing and I think that we got fair value this morning. So I'm very excited and particularly excited about what having this capital on our balance sheet does for us. Now you have Emerald Sapphire, Pearl, so many different securities and derivatives exchanges. Talk to us a little bit about how you plan to broaden your reach, because right now you really do have a nice portion of the derivatives and it's the options trading, if you like. But when it comes to equities and maybe other products, you could do more. Yes. You know, I'm very proud of the fact that literally in less than a dozen years, we've become the 14th largest derivatives exchange operator in the world. And in December of 2012, we didn't exist. So what I plan to do is to leverage the technology, the people, and the relationships with market participants like Citadel and move into other asset classes like Futures. And I'm so excited about the long term exclusive licensing agreement that we signed last summer with Bloomberg. So we're going to launch the B 500 futures on our Max futures exchange. And also right on the heels of opening up our brand new trading platform on August excuse me, on July 1st. So we have a whole new asset class in futures. And the anchor for this relationship is Bloomberg. I'm so excited about that. And then once we get done with the B 500 futures and options, we're going to move to the B 100. So we're really excited about this long term partnership with Bloomberg, particularly the ability to not only have the securities relationship, but also that you folks will be down in Miami with us and have a broadcast facility. Really exciting. Hey, listen, I like the sound of that. You are planning on having a PC, right? It's going to be the first pit that we've seen since essentially, you know, the last remaining pit closed in New York a couple of years ago. Yeah. You know, having a trading floor. We're coming full circle. Some of my team closed trading floors. But the reason we opened the trading floor in Miami is our member firms wanted us to do it. You know, in 1988, there was two phone companies that dominated the flip phones. That was Motorola and it was Nokia. Who would have thought 20 years later that the Apple iPhone would become so ubiquitous? So what we've done over the last 18 months, I put people on the floors of various exchanges, see the workflow, and we've automated things even on a manual trading floor that haven't been changed in 30 years. So I'm really excited. The other thing is Miami. Miami is a great place to conduct business. What started as a pandemic relocation, you know, starting in March of 2020, is now a full fledged exodus from some of the major cities to go into Miami. So to be the first national exchange in the history of our country to open up in Miami, I'm so excited and to be in partnership with Bloomberg. Tom, U.S. trading volume has increased 300% from before the pandemic. How much of this is retail? How much of it is like literally Jane Street? Well, the real focus of our business is with the people that interact with the retail flow. So in terms of the the retail flow, it's very important to the options business. And one of the things that's really leading to this explosive growth is the the low cost trading that's happening all around us with people like Robinhood, Webull and Ninja, where the customers can trade for free. So what I'm really excited about is leveraging these relationships that we have in multi listed options and moving into futures products like the B 500 with the Bloomberg team. So and then with that futures exchange that we have, I think we can get that wave of retail futures engagement with the best technology in the world that was only launched 30 days ago. Tom, the exchange area has quite a few players now, you know, mimics obviously, you know nicely where you are in the Nasdaq and so on. You know, some of the the older ones. How do you compete? Do you compete on price? Is there a time when it will get saturated? You know, in the beginning, I competed on price. I competed on access fees, trying to be a low operator because it was all about getting market share. The rocket fuel for an exchange is market share. Unless your exchange group gets to five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10% of market share. No one wants to connect to you. But once you get them here, my whole idea was get them into our exchange group, get them comfortable, have a great experience. And now I'm not competing. I'm not going. Getting on price. I'm not competing because we have equity ownership by some of the largest market makers. What I'm competing on is technology. Everything changed for us on March 13th, 2020, when the pandemic hit. President Trump goes out in the Oval Office, comes out on the lawn and say, this is a national pandemic. Well, guess what? The markets exploded on March 16. Volatility was all over the place. Well, I built the church for Easter Sunday. We had the infrastructure in place when that volatility was going to hit. The difference between our customers interaction and some of our competing exchanges was game changing from that day to today. We've grown dramatically. In fact, from the second half of 20, the first half of 2016 to the first half of this year. We've grown over a thousand basis points of market share. And guess who the donors were, the big three, Nasdaq CIBO, and some from the New York Stock Exchange. Although I'm so proud to be listing today on the New York Stock Exchange. I have a lot of respect for Lynn Martin. She's been a gracious host today, and that's how competition should be, should be fierce. But it can be friendly. And I'm very gratified to be here today. Well, in the halls of commerce.",
