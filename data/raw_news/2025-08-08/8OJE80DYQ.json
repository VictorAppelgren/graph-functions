  "title": "Analysis: Epstein victims are a growing political threat to Trump",
  "description": "The women whom Jeffrey Epstein abused demand to be heard.",
  "content": "The women whom Jeffrey Epstein abused demand to be heard.\n\nAnd their voices \u2014 long suppressed, but now emerging powerfully and with courage \u2014 could further fuel the maelstrom around President Donald Trump and aides who dig the scandal deeper each time they try to end it.\n\nThese are women who\u2019ve been let down for years, at multiple levels, by a government that was supposed to keep them safe. Their families are victims, too, since abuse sows trauma through generations.\n\nAnd it\u2019s happening again as the Trump administration refuses to release files about Epstein\u2019s life, which several of its members had promised to make public. CNN has reported that Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed Trump in May that his name was mentioned in the files, among those of other high-profile figures.\n\nTrump has never been investigated or charged over anything to do with Epstein, whom he knew in the 1990s and early 2000s. The White House says Trump threw Epstein out of Mar-a-Lago because he was \u201ca creep.\u201d\n\nBut hardly anyone at the White House ever mentions the young women whom Epstein used and abused.\n\n\u201cWhat they really need is for it to go away,\u201d Sky Roberts, the brother of one of Epstein\u2019s most prominent victims, Virginia Giuffre, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lack of transparency here and what we are not hearing is \u2026 we are not hearing the survivors\u2019 voices coming through,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cThis is a human issue, and I think we need to bring that back because we are dehumanizing survivors by not bringing justice forward.\u201d Giuffre took her own life in Australia, where she lived, earlier this year.\n\nIn a sign of the administration\u2019s political priorities, there were no Epstein survivors represented at a Wednesday night White House meeting that addressed the crisis, CNN reported. Those in attendance included Vice President JD Vance, Attorney General Pam Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel. The meeting was moved from the vice president\u2019s residence amid a media storm.\n\nThe focus at those White House talks appears to have been about ending a political problem rather than alleviating any further agony for people whose live were blighted by Epstein and Maxwell.\n\nOne Epstein accuser, Annie Farmer, told CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on Thursday that she had reached out to Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche \u2014 who spent two days interviewing Epstein\u2019s jailed accomplice Maxwell last month \u2014 but had not heard back. Some victims and their families view the meeting as a political maneuver to find a way to refocus attention away from Trump.\n\n\u201cI hate that it has been politicized the way it is because I think we lose sight of the bigger picture in that,\u201d Farmer said on \u201cThe Source.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think this is really about people using their power to harm others, and that is not a political issue,\u201d Farmer said, referring to Epstein\u2019s past conduct. \u201cI think people on both sides care about the safety of children and I really hope that Trump understands that a message is being sent beyond just the individuals involved in this case to the wider community about the seriousness of these types of crimes.\u201d\n\nThe question now is whether survivors and their families can coalesce as a political force as they seek to influence the administration\u2019s decision-making \u2014 even if they are seldom mentioned by MAGA media.\n\nCan they secure the recognition of which they were so often deprived by the justice system? Will their influence further complicate a controversy that the White House has downplayed and dismissed but that keeps growing? And could they add a new dimension of political exposure for a White House so far mostly concerned with extinguishing a scandal that is uniquely dangerous for Trump \u2014 because it opened a rift between him and his base? Could that increased attention even make it more difficult to for Trump to pardon Maxwell, if that is his intention?\n\nVictims have been ignored for years\n\nIt\u2019s nothing new that the powerful are ignoring the victims.\n\nIt\u2019s been running on repeat for years.\n\nAs young girls, these women were victimized by Epstein, a disgraced financier, in a sordid web of soliciting, abuse and underage sexual exploitation.\n\nThey were also victimized by Maxwell, his onetime paramour, who was sent to prison for 20 years for grooming Epstein\u2019s young female victims \u2014 and abusing some herself.\n\nThey were victimized by a lenient Florida plea deal in 2008 that allowed Epstein, an accused sex trafficker, to escape federal charges and a possible long prison term. He used the time he got back to perpetrate more horrendous crimes.\n\nThey were the victims of justice denied when Epstein killed himself in prison rather than face trial.\n\nA modicum of recognition arrived when Maxwell was convicted. But that vindication is under threat because of politics.\n\nThe conspiracy theorists who made this an animating cause of the MAGA right profess to care about child sex trafficking, but the coverage in fringe right-wing media rarely mentions the plight of victims themselves.\n\nUsing the Department of Justice to protect Trump, not victims\n\nNow, top administration officials are using the power of the Department of Justice in a plan apparently designed to take the political heat off Trump over his past relationship with Epstein. The clue is in the name \u2014 the Department of Justice. It\u2019s supposed to deliver justice to victims and to honor their suffering. Instead, it\u2019s being used to protect a president.\n\nWhen Trump was asked about Giuffre, he said he recalled that Epstein \u201cstole\u201d her, as if she were chattel, from his employ at the spa at Mar-a-Lago. The inhumanity of Trump\u2019s remark prompted Giuffre\u2019s family to first speak up, in a move that appears to have encouraged other families to come forward. \u201cShe wasn\u2019t stolen, she was preyed upon at his property, at President Trump\u2019s property \u2026 \u2018stolen\u2019 seems very impersonal. It feels very much like an object, and the survivors are not objects; women are not objects,\u201d Roberts told CNN\u2019s Collins last month.\n\nHardly anyone at the White House has publicly voiced concern for those dragged into some of modern history\u2019s most notorious sex crimes.\n\nThe opposite is true. Trump, increasingly agitated as the Epstein fallout drowns out his presidency, keeps blasting the entire Epstein drama as a \u201choax\u201d in remarks that only makes the anguish worse. He even called it B.S. on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a hoax,\u201d Roberts told Burnett on Thursday, his voice breaking.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s pretty clear that these survivors are not a hoax. These are people. It hurts. They are still healing. They had something taken from them that they can never get back.\u201d\n\nThe White House has tried other ruses to make the scandal go away.\n\nIt has asked a judge to release grand jury testimony about the Epstein case, apparently hoping to slake demands for transparency by MAGA influencers. But the material is only a fraction of what the Justice Department controls. Then Blanche, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, interviewed Maxwell. Then, mysteriously, Maxwell was moved to a much more comfortable prison in a highly unusual show of leniency for a sex offender. This fueled warnings of a cover-up, since Maxwell has an incentive to help Trump politically: He has the power to pardon her or improve her conditions.\n\nThe contempt for the victims is \u201coutrageous,\u201d Jennifer Freeman, a lawyer for some of those abused by Maxwell, told CNN\u2019s Collins on Wednesday. \u201cWhen the voices are so strong from everyone else except for them. They\u2019re not given any attention whatsoever.\u201d Freeman lamented that those caught up in the Epstein political saga have been \u201cignoring the survivors over and over \u2026. (in) one of the largest law enforcement failures in US history.\u201d\n\nThe disrespect keeps on coming.\n\nIn an interview with Newsmax last week, Trump was asked why Blanche met with Maxwell. \u201cWe\u2019d like to release everything, but we don\u2019t want people to get hurt that shouldn\u2019t be hurt, and I would assume that was why he was there,\u201d Trump told Newsmax a week ago. His remark was ambiguous. But it seemed to prioritize people who came into contact with Epstein, including himself, rather than those who have already been hurt \u2014 the victims. CNN reported this week that audio tapes were made of the Maxwell interview and that officials are considering releasing a transcript.\n\nThere is no indication of wrongdoing by Trump in his dealings with Epstein, Maxwell or in any other area of the case. He has never been charged or investigated. But there is growing scrutiny over how often he\u2019s mentioned in the Epstein files held by the Justice Department.\n\nSome victims want all of the Epstein files publicly released so any men who associated with the accused sex offender must account for what they knew about his activities.\n\nBut they fear what will happen with Maxwell and the pardon that Trump keeps saying he has the constitutional authority to grant.\n\nSuch an outcome would be another betrayal of those who have suffered so terribly already.",

      "text": "For years, Republicans and MAGA influencers have been keen to rip the lid off a supposed government conspiracy to cover up information related to Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s crimes and alleged associates. Many key figures who now serve in the Trump administration pledged to do exactly that.\nThe administration\u2019s failures to live up to those promises and its bizarre handling of the situation now have it scrambling. On Wednesday night, that will take the form of top officials strategizing at Vice President JD Vance\u2019s residence, CNN is now reporting.\nBut their task is only getting harder.\nAnd that\u2019s in large part because a growing chorus of Epstein\u2019s victims and their allies now suggest there could indeed be a cover-up afoot.\nOne forged by the same MAGA administration that built itself up as the antidote.\nTo be clear, President Donald Trump has not been accused of any crimes in relation to Epstein. But repeatedly in recent days and weeks, those victims and allies have stepped forward to raise serious questions about the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the matter. They\u2019ve complained about favorable treatment of convicted Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell. They\u2019ve objected to the lack of disclosure. They\u2019ve complained about the administration\u2019s treatment of them.\nThey\u2019ve invoked the phrase \u201ccover-up\u201d on at least three occasions. Others have more subtly pointed in that direction.\nVictims have raised concerns about the government\u2019s handling of the matter for years \u2013 in particular focusing on a favorable non-prosecution agreement Epstein landed in 2007 and the years before he was later charged \u2013 but their complaints are now directed squarely at the Trump administration.\nAll of which makes it much more difficult for the administration to just move on, as the president would clearly prefer.\nLast week, family members of one of Epstein\u2019s and Maxwell\u2019s most prominent accusers, Virginia Giuffre, cited Trump\u2019s recent admission that he had been aware that Epstein recruited Giuffre from Mar-a-Lago. They cited other evidence that Trump was aware of Epstein\u2019s affinity for young girls and women and said, \u201cIt makes us ask if he was aware of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s criminal actions.\u201d\n(Giuffre died by suicide earlier this year.)\nIn another letter, Giuffre family members and other accusers also cited the still-unexplained prison transfer of Maxwell to a lower-security prison camp that sex offenders like her don\u2019t appear eligible for, without a waiver. That news came shortly after Maxwell, who\u2019s serving a 20-year sentence, was interviewed by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. And it comes as Trump has dangled the possibility of pardoning Maxwell, who\u2019s appealing her conviction.\n\u201cThis move smacks of a cover up,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe victims deserve better.\u201d\nThey\u2019re not the only ones to raise concerns about the prison transfer.\nTwo attorneys who have represented Epstein accusers, Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, said in a letter Tuesday that they were given no notice of Maxwell\u2019s transfer or any chance to object.\nThey said the victims view the transfer \u201cas extraordinarily insensitive and suggestive of ulterior purposes.\u201d\nThat letter was one of several entered into the record as part of proceedings over whether to unseal grand jury testimony from the investigations into Maxwell and Epstein. And some of those letters have also raised concerns about a cover-up.\nOne unnamed victim in her letter appeared to cite a Bloomberg report that the FBI has redacted the names of Trump and other prominent public figures in the Epstein files \u2013 a report that CNN hasn\u2019t confirmed.\nThe unnamed victim said, \u201cI feel like the DOJ\u2019s and FBI\u2019s priority is protecting the \u2018third-party\u2019, the wealthy men by focusing on scrubbing their names off the files,\u201d adding: \u201cThat is their focus? Wow!\u201d\nAnother victim, Annie Farmer, offered similar thoughts. Her lawyer cited the Justice Department\u2019s statement last month that it would not release \u201cinformation related to third parties who neither have been charged or alleged to be involved\u201d in Epstein\u2019s and Maxwell\u2019s crimes.\n\u201cAny effort to redact third party names smacks of a cover up,\u201d Farmer\u2019s lawyer said.\nFarmer previously told The New York Times that she urged law enforcement and the FBI two decades ago to look more broadly into Epstein\u2019s associates, including Trump, who was friendly with Epstein but has said they had a falling out. Farmer also described a troubling encounter with Trump and Epstein in Epstein\u2019s office in the mid-1990s.\nThere is no evidence of Trump\u2019s involvement in Epstein\u2019s crimes, and Farmer said she had no evidence of criminal wrongdoing by Trump. The White House has denied the alleged encounter by saying, \u201cThe president was never in [Epstein\u2019s] office.\u201d But Farmer\u2019s account reinforces how Trump\u2019s name could appear in the Epstein files and how it might reflect poorly on him, even if there\u2019s no accusation of wrongdoing.\nAlso suggesting a cover-up last month was Alicia Arden, who alleged that Epstein assaulted her in 1997.\nArden told NBC News that she supported Trump but believed \u201cthere\u2019s a cover-up of some kind going on.\u201d\nShe cited Attorney General Pam Bondi\u2019s comments in February indicating she had Epstein\u2019s client list on her desk \u2013 comments Bondi and the White House now claim referred to other Epstein-related documents. The DOJ now says there is no client list.\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want something to come out, and I don\u2019t understand why,\u201d Arden said. \u201cMaybe the list is more horrifying than we think.\u201d\nAnother anonymous Epstein accuser told NBC: \u201cI am not surprised Trump is now saying we should stop talking about Epstein,\u201d adding, \u201cThese people are trying to protect themselves.\u201d\nAnd David Boies, a prominent attorney who represented Giuffre, told NBC: \u201cI think they ought to release the material after promising, and if they don\u2019t, people will believe they are hiding something, and that cannot be tolerated.\u201d\nBoies points to something important. While Epstein-related conspiracy theories have been mostly pushed by Republicans and right-wing influencers, polls suggest large swaths of Americans buy into them, at least to some degree.\nA CBS News-YouGov poll last month found Americans agreed 92-8% that the Epstein files \u201cprobably include damaging information about powerful or wealthy people.\u201d\nA Reuters-Ipsos poll showed Americans agreed 69-6% that the federal government was \u201chiding information\u201d about Epstein\u2019s clients and 60-12% that it was covering up details of his death (with many doubting he died by suicide, as the administration affirmed he did).\nThe comments of Epstein\u2019s victims and their allies would seem to bolster that pre-existing belief.\nAnd that makes it a lot harder to claim there\u2019s nothing to see here \u2013 whether for Trump or the many people who have built followings by pushing these theories."

      "text": "Federal prosecutors amassed millions of records during the sex trafficking investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and his accomplice and former girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell.\nThe question of what is actually in those pages \u2014 and whether the public will ever see them \u2014 has become central to a growing public relations crisis for President Donald Trump and his aides.\nHaving said it would release case documents, now the Justice Department is trying to staunch the public outcry from some of Trump\u2019s ardent supporters along with some Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill who believe the administration has fallen short of its transparency pledge.\nIt\u2019s unclear what new information, if any, is stuffed in the boxes of evidence within the Justice Department or what Maxwell would say publicly about Epstein and anyone else\u2019s connections to him.\nFor months, Justice Department and FBI officials have wrestled with the fact much of the material they have requires redaction to protect the identities of victims and witnesses, and people who haven\u2019t been charged with crimes, according to people briefed on the matter. That raised the prospect that releasing thousands of pages covered with black ink for the redactions would only inflame people who believe the government is hiding evidence of additional criminal activity.\nThe Epstein files are made of over 300 gigabytes of data, paper, video, photographs, and audio that live within the FBI\u2019s main electronic case management system, \u201cSentinel.\u201d These records would include investigative reports and records from the FBI Miami field division\u2019s original Epstein investigation. The bulk of the records would come from the second investigation carried out by the FBI\u2019s New York Office, including memorandums about the investigation and potential targets, locations to be searched, records to be subpoenaed, and hundreds of pages of \u201c302s\u201d which are the forms that FBI agents use to memorialize what witnesses, victims and suspects said in interviews by investigators.\nA large cache of records has already been made public through unsealing civil court cases, Maxwell\u2019s criminal trial, and news reports. Politicians, including Trump, and celebrities have been publicly linked to Epstein for years \u2014 sometimes by appearing in flight logs or at events \u2014 and all have denied any wrongdoing.\nEpstein\u2019s death by suicide before trial launched conspiracy theories and deprived many of his accusers a public airing of his conduct. Maxwell was convicted of sex trafficking minors following a four-week trial in 2021. She is appealing.\nThe Justice Department asked federal judges to unseal grand jury transcripts from the Epstein and Maxwell cases. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche met Thursday with Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence, in Tallahassee, Fla.\n\u201cIf Ghislane Maxwell has information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims, the FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say,\u201d Blanche said in a post on X.\nBlanche\u2019s post stands in contrast with the July 8 memo that was intended to close the books on the Epstein matter. In that memo, the Justice Department and FBI declared that they had done an exhaustive review and had determined that \u201cwe did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\u201d\nHere\u2019s what we do and don\u2019t know about the Epstein records:\nGrand jury\nThe Justice Department has asked two federal judges in New York to unseal grand jury transcripts from Epstein and Maxwell\u2019s criminal cases. Former federal prosecutors say the transcripts likely contain a miniscule amount of evidence from the investigations.\nFederal prosecutors in New York generally call law enforcement agents to testify before the grand jury to present just enough evidence they need to support an indictment. Other witnesses, including accusers, are rarely called in to testify before federal grand juries in New York.\nThe judges overseeing the two cases in New York asked DOJ for more legal argument for why they should unseal grand jury material, which is rarely done, and set deadlines that extend to August 5.\nAlready one effort has failed. A federal judge in Florida denied DOJ\u2019s request to unseal grand jury transcripts from its 2005 and 2007 investigations into Epstein, stating the department didn\u2019t meet the legal hurdle to do so under the rules governing the circuit.\nThe DOJ request is narrow: It isn\u2019t seeking to unseal all information that was derived from the grand jury proceedings, which if sought, could include information from financial institutions, emails or text messages, and returns from any other person or institution that was subpoenaed by the grand jury.\nSearch warrants\nFederal prosecutors and the FBI obtained a trove of information during the searches of Epstein\u2019s homes in Florida, New York and Little Saint James, Epstein\u2019s private Caribbean island. That information is under the control of DOJ and is not blocked from public release by secrecy rules.\nFBI officials recovered thousands of nude and seminude photographs of young females, including at least of one minor, in a search of his Manhattan mansion in the days following his arrest. Binders of CDs containing the photos were seized. Agents used a saw to open a safe that had more than $70,000 in cash, 48 loose diamond stones, one as large as 2.38 carats, and a large diamond ring.\nThey also collected documents from the New York home, including notes, messages with names and contact information for certain victims, and phone records.\nA search of Epstein\u2019s private island was conducted days after he was found dead in a jail cell about one month after his arrest. By then the investigation had shifted its focus to any co-conspirators of Epstein.\nIn February the Justice Department provided an index of evidence it has. The index includes over two dozen computers, numerous hard drives, at least two cell phones, and four iPads. The index says there are boat trip logs potentially of who traveled to his private island \u2014 that information has not been made public.\nThe Justice Department does not release child pornography so those records would not be expected to be made public under any circumstance.\nFlorida DOJ case file\nFederal prosecutors in New York obtained the investigative record from the earlier investigations into Epstein conducted by their counterparts in Florida in 2007 and 2009. Any of those records that were not covered by grand jury secrecy rules could be released.\nCivil lawsuits\nMuch of the public record relating to Epstein has derived from civil lawsuits brought by accusers, some filed under their own names and others using Jane Doe pseudonyms. Judges have ordered the release of thousands of pages of documents, including depositions taken under oath.\nAmong the famous names referenced in those documents are Trump, former President Bill Clinton, Britain\u2019s Prince Andrew, former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, French modeling scout Jean-Luc Brunel, American investor Glenn Dubin, and Leslie Wexner, the CEO of L Brands. Not all of them were accused of wrongdoing, and all of them have denied any wrongdoing.\nMaxwell trial\nMaxwell\u2019s four-week criminal trial was a public airing of her close relationship to Epstein and her role recruiting, grooming and at times participating in the sexual abuse of minors with Epstein. Four women testified about being sexually assaulted when they were minors.\nEpstein\u2019s former pilot testified and identified people he saw on Epstein\u2019s plane, including Trump, Senators John Glenn and George Mitchell, Prince Andrew, actor Kevin Spacey, and violinist Itzhak Perlman. The pilot said he never saw any wrongdoing.\nGawker first published a copy in 2015 of Epstein\u2019s so-called \u201cblack book\u201d with names and phone numbers of his contacts. The Justice Department released a redacted version of it earlier this year as well as copies of the flight logs that were made public during Maxwell\u2019s criminal trial.\nThe release was criticized by some of Trump\u2019s supporters because the information was already public \u2014 and did nothing to answer lingering questions.\nCNN\u2019s John Miller contributed to this report."

      "text": "Lordy, there are tapes.\nIn the latest turn of the immortal scandal over Jeffrey Epstein, CNN first reported Tuesday that Donald Trump\u2019s administration has recorded conversations with Epstein\u2019s convicted sex trafficker accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell and is working on a transcript, which it may even release.\nThe revelation about Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche\u2019s conversations with Maxwell last month is certain to renew demands for transparency from sectors of the president\u2019s base that first whipped the Epstein storm into overdrive.\nAnd it comes as senior administration officials plan to meet at Vice President JD Vance\u2019s residence for dinner Wednesday to discuss how to better handle the Epstein case, CNN\u2019s team reported.\nTaking a step back, it\u2019s an extraordinary use of an administration\u2019s power for a top Justice Department official to spend two days talking to someone convicted of grooming, abusing and trafficking young girls for a figure as reviled as Epstein. The idea that officials would then consider releasing an account of the meeting to brazenly help a president escape a political scandal raises ethical, legal and political questions that reflect the unfathomable times in Trump\u2019s second term.\nBut it\u2019s hard to see how releasing a transcript of the interview with Maxwell could end up making people less interested in the intrigue \u2014 which would be the ostensible purpose of the exercise.\nMore likely, such a move would risk repeating the damaging cycle that has plunged the White House ever deeper into a political morass.\nEvery time the administration takes a step designed to quell the scandal, all it succeeds in doing is raising expectations and brewing new conspiracy theories among MAGA activists obsessed with the case while widening public exposure to an episode that has blotted out the president\u2019s summer winning streak.\nThree senior administration officials told CNN that discussions are taking place about releasing the transcript of Maxwell\u2019s interviews with Blanche in Florida two weeks ago. That was before she was moved, without explanation, to a less draconian prison in Texas \u2014 a step that itself launched new speculation and suggestions that Trump was misusing presidential power to advance his personal interests. A final decision on next steps on a transcript has not been made, one of the officials said.\nBut this news came on a day when the Epstein question broke the surface in Washington again \u2014 just when the White House hoped it was fading.\nNews came Tuesday that the House Oversight Committee had issued a dozen subpoenas to the Justice Department and high-profile Democratic and Republican figures for files and information related to Epstein.\nAnd in the latest step of a complex dance with the administration, Maxwell\u2019s lawyers warned against the release of sealed grand jury transcripts about the Epstein case. They said the move \u2014 one way the DOJ is seeking to appease demands for transparency from the Trump base \u2014 would prejudice her due process interests as she petitions the Supreme Court to take up her appeal.\n\u201cJeffrey Epstein is dead. Ghislaine Maxwell is not,\u201d Maxwell\u2019s attorney, David Oscar Markus, wrote to the judge in a filing.\nThe aphorism is factual. But Epstein\u2019s poisoned influence on politics has never been so alive, six years after he was found dead by suicide in his cell while awaiting trial on a catalogue of horrific charges of abusing young women and girls.\nMany of those victims on Tuesday questioned the motives of the Trump administration in its dealings with Maxwell and said that indications that she was being \u201clegitimized\u201d had traumatized them all over again. They told the judge in the grand jury documents case that survivors supported transparency but said the \u201csafety, privacy and dignity\u201d of victims must be protected.\nWhy a Maxwell transcript might make the scandal even worse\nThere\u2019s been intense speculation about the past friendship between Epstein and Trump, both New York and Florida celebrities, in the 1990s and the early 2000s, before the future president threw the disgraced financier out of his Mar-a-Lago club. Epstein \u201cstole\u201d his employees, Trump told reporters last week.\nThere\u2019s no evidence that Trump did anything legally wrong during his friendship with Epstein, and he has never been charged with any crimes related to their connection.\nThe president, however, keeps refocusing attention on Epstein\u2019s case by refusing to rule out a pardon or commutation for Maxwell. Trump instead keeps noting that he has the power to ease the plight of someone who has a huge incentive to help him.\n\u201cI\u2019m allowed to do it, but nobody\u2019s asked me to do it. I know nothing about it. I don\u2019t know anything about the case, but I know I have the right to do it,\u201d Trump said in an interview with Newsmax, a conservative outlet, last week.\nIt is unclear what Blanche and Maxwell spoke about. But the point of releasing a transcript might be to show Epstein knew multiple famous people and not just Trump. This might defuse concerns about the president\u2019s past relationship with him.\nBut such a release might also be unfair to people who came across Epstein but who committed no crimes.\nThere would be issues with Maxwell\u2019s credibility as a witness, given the nature of the conviction for which she is serving a 20-year prison sentence. People would ask what she got in return for her cooperation. Already, survivors of Epstein\u2019s abuse and the family of Virginia Giuffre, one of his most well-know victims, who took her life this year, have warned there should be no leniency.\nTrump insisted, as he answered a question from CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins on Tuesday, that he knew nothing about the contents of Blanche\u2019s talks with Maxwell.\n\u201cSo, I know this. I didn\u2019t discuss it with him, but anything he talked about with her, or the fact that he did that \u2014 not unusual, number one, and most importantly, is something that would be totally above board,\u201d the president said.\nBut it is highly unusual for a deputy attorney general to meet with an imprisoned inmate convicted of child sex trafficking as a related scandal swirls around the president who appointed him. And Blanche is Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer.\nAnd in any case, any notion that a transcript would end the Epstein drama feels far-fetched. The document would need to be heavily redacted to avoid revealing sensitive details like the names of victims. But this would surely fuel fringe intriguers who argue that the government is involved in a massive cover-up. It\u2019s the nature of conspiracy theories that efforts to squelch them only spark new tributaries of unhinged speculation. This has already happened. Previous disclosures by Attorney General Pam Bondi of documents and details in the case only conjured claims of a deep state plot to hide the truth when the release fell far short of her promises to MAGA activists.\nHouse Oversight ensures this drama will run and run\nThe House Oversight Committee\u2019s subpoena to the Justice Department calls for the provision to Congress of any Epstein files in its possession, with victims\u2019 names redacted. The GOP-led panel also wants communications between former Biden administration officials and the Justice Department related to the case.\nDepartments of Justice often resist releasing sensitive documents to Congress: They often leak. But Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, who serves on the House Oversight Committee, told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Tuesday the House would reinforce the demand for action in September, when Khanna is hoping for a vote on his bipartisan bill demanding the full release of information. \u201cI think soon you are going to see many victims speaking out themselves about how this is important for them, in terms of disclosure in terms of transparency,\u201d Khanna said.\nThe Republican-led panel additionally subpoenaed 10 individuals for closed-door depositions between August and mid-October. Those are: former Attorneys General Merrick Garland, William Barr, Jeff Sessions, Loretta Lynch, Eric Holder and Alberto Gonzales; former FBI Director James Comey; former special counsel and FBI Director Robert Mueller III; former Secretary of State and first lady Hillary Clinton; and former President Bill Clinton.\nBut there are huge omissions on the list of subpoenas that raise doubts about whether it\u2019s really seeking full transparency. Like Trump, who was mentioned multiple times in the Epstein files, and his first-term Labor Secretary Alex Acosta, who handed Epstein a sweetheart plea deal in 2008. There are also no victims \u2014 people who have often been ignored in the current political uproar \u2014 on the subpoena list.\nRyan Goodman, a New York University law professor, said the omission of Trump from the subpoenas was \u201cvery glaring,\u201d since a subpoena sent to former President Bill Clinton said Clinton could have information regarding Epstein that may be relevant to the investigation. The same is true of Trump. \u201cIt only stands to reason that if you are looking around for the people that would provide information for the investigation, he (Trump) would be pretty close to the top of that list,\u201d Goodman told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett.\nThe subpoenas likely mean months of negotiations and legal battles about the timing and scope of testimony. So the Epstein saga is here to stay.\nThe inclusion of the names of high-profile Democrats and past Republican officials may be an attempt to spare Trump from being the only person tainted by association with Epstein.\nMaxwell\u2019s legal conundrum\nThe warning by Maxwell\u2019s lawyers that grand jury testimony should not be released potentially puts their client in opposition to the Justice Department at a time when she has strong incentives to help the administration.\nThe DOJ went to court to ask for the release of grand jury transcripts about Epstein and Maxwell, hoping to placate the MAGA base. The testimony, however, is thought to be only a fraction of investigative material the DOJ is holding. Some observers question whether officials really want grand jury documents released or whether they petitioned the judge only to create political cover.\nCNN Senior Legal Analyst Elie Honig explained that Maxwell\u2019s lawyers are protecting her interests in the event that Supreme Court accepts her appeal. Her lawyer would \u201cnot want this grand jury material out there for the public,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Kasie Hunt.\nTaken together, Tuesday\u2019s developments mean Epstein drama will go on.\nAnd the history of tapes in American scandals \u2014 from Watergate onward \u2014 create evocative echoes. Audio and questions about its release, redaction and editing have been inseparable from lore about cover-ups and chicanery in Washington politics. That\u2019s why \u2014 amid a previous scandal \u2014 Comey replied, when asked whether there were recordings of his conversations with Trump: \u201cLordy, I hope there are tapes.\u201d"

      "text": "The Trump administration made interviewing Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, a key part of its efforts to climb out from beneath its Epstein files problems.\nOver a week later, we still don\u2019t know what transpired during that meeting. But the Maxwell situation has only grown to epitomize a series of very curious maneuvers that call into question precisely what everyone in the administration is thinking and suggest the controversy is going nowhere fast.\nIndeed, it\u2019s almost as if those involved are trying to make this look bad.\nWe learned Friday that Maxwell had been moved from a low-security federal prison in Florida to a minimum-security prison camp in Texas called Camp Bryan \u2013 a significant upgrade for an inmate serving a 20-year sentence.\nNeither the Justice Department, the Bureau of Prisons nor Maxwell\u2019s lawyer has addressed precisely why the transfer was made. We don\u2019t know who was involved. But it\u2019s conspicuous for a host of reasons.\nTo wit:\n- News of the transfer broke after Maxwell met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, a political appointee and Trump\u2019s former defense lawyer, in a meeting that remains shrouded in secrecy.\n- Maxwell doesn\u2019t appear to have been eligible for such a transfer, unless someone granted her a waiver. Bureau of Prisons policy states that anyone who had \u201csexual contact with a minor,\u201d as Maxwell did when she participated in the sexual abuse, \u201cwill be housed in at least a Low security level institution,\u201d without such a waiver. (Maxwell was sentenced in 2022 for carrying out a years-long scheme with Epstein to groom and sexually abuse underage girls.)\n- Experts have said such a transfer is highly unusual. Prison consultant Holli Coulman on Friday told CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly that she had \u201cnever seen this in my life. Never seen it by women that I\u2019ve either served time with, clients, never have seen this. This is unprecedented.\u201d\n- Maxwell\u2019s upgrade comes as Trump has repeatedly seemed to dangle a favor \u2013 specifically, a potential pardon \u2013 as she spoke with the Justice Department and entered into talks to testify to Congress. The White House told CNN last week that \u201cno leniency is being given or discussed\u201d for Maxwell, but then Trump again conspicuously noted that he had the power to pardon her.\n- A lower-security prison could certainly be construed as a form of \u201cleniency.\u201d\n- Trump has a history of suggesting favors for those whose actions could impact him. He dangled pardons over witnesses in the Russia investigation in ways that special counsel Robert Mueller said could have impacted their decisions on cooperating with the government. And more recently, Trump\u2019s Justice Department seemed to tie the dismissal of New York Mayor Eric Adams\u2019s criminal charges to him helping with Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.\n- The favorable prison transfer comes even as Maxwell\u2019s lawyer has openly sought concessions for her.\nThere is plenty we don\u2019t know about all of this, in large part because the key players aren\u2019t talking. It\u2019s theoretically possible this is all just a major coincidence.\nBut it certainly raises questions that the key officials involved would seem to have motivation to put to rest \u2013 and quickly. Maxwell\u2019s testimony could bear on Trump personally, given continuing revelations about his ties to Epstein and his desire to put the entire Epstein files fiasco to rest. Now we learn she got a highly unusual perk.\nAnd it\u2019s merely the latest in a series of very questionable developments.\nThe other concession the Trump administration made after failing to produce the Epstein documents that it had promised was moving to unseal grand jury testimony. But its own filing last week reinforced that information is likely to be quite limited, if it even sees the light of day.\nTrump has been very slow to acknowledge his own proximity to Epstein. Last week, after days of confusion, the president ultimately said he had been aware in real time that Epstein \u201cstole\u201d one of his Mar-a-Lago employees, a then-minor named Virginia Giuffre who became one of Epstein\u2019s highest-profile accusers.\nGiven Giuffre\u2019s age at the time and a paper trail that suggests Trump\u2019s awareness of Epstein\u2019s affinity for young women and girls, that raises valid questions about what Trump knew or might have suspected at the time. Family members of Giuffre\u2019s have raised the possibility that Trump knows more than he has let on, but the president has balked at expanding on his statements about why this episode made him decide Epstein was a \u201ccreep.\u201d\nTrump, who has not been accused of wrongdoing in connection with Epstein, claimed Thursday that \u201cI don\u2019t know really why\u201d Epstein was taking his employees.\nBut he\u2019s repeatedly made false and misleading claims about his past ties to Epstein. Most recently, he denied that Attorney General Pam Bondi had told him his name was in the Epstein files, which CNN later reported she had \u2013 back in May.\nWhat\u2019s more, the timeline suggests the administration\u2019s reversal on promising full disclosure coincided with Trump being told he was in the files.\nAnd then there is the Maxwell situation. Even before the news of her prison transfer, the administration took very little care to make its handling of her appear proper.\nIt sent Blanche, Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, to meet with her. Blanche has called Maxwell\u2019s lawyer his \u201cfriend.\u201d Maxwell\u2019s lawyer has been solicitous of Trump. And, of course, Trump has repeatedly left open a pardon.\nTrump late last week said he didn\u2019t know what would be produced from the Blanche meeting, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know because I haven\u2019t spoken about it.\u201d\nBut he again suggested it might be limited by a desire not to create suspicion of people who haven\u2019t been charged with crimes.\nThe confusion around all of this only seems to be growing, in large part because of Trump\u2019s and the administration\u2019s own actions and lack of transparency.\nAnd perhaps nothing looms larger right now than the unanswered questions about the prison transfer."

      "text": "Top Trump administration officials will gather at the vice president\u2019s residence Wednesday evening as they continue to weigh whether to publish an audio recording and transcript of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche\u2019s recent conversation with Jeffrey Epstein accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell.\nThe administration\u2019s handling of the Epstein case, as well as the need to craft a unified response, is expected to be a main focus of the dinner, three sources familiar with the meeting told CNN. The meeting will include White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Vice President JD Vance, Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel and Blanche.\nWith the exception of Vance, the White House considers those officials the leaders of the administration\u2019s ongoing strategy regarding the Epstein files, two of the sources said.\nThe meeting comes as Trump\u2019s administration is considering releasing the contents of Blanche\u2019s interview last month with Maxwell. Two officials told CNN that the materials could be made public as early as this week.\nThere have also been internal discussions about Blanche holding a press conference or doing a high-profile interview, possibly with popular podcaster Joe Rogan, according to three people familiar with the discussions, though those conversations are preliminary. Rogan, who endorsed Trump on the eve of last fall\u2019s election, has been highly critical of the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the Epstein case and previously called their refusal release more information about Epstein a \u201cline in the sand.\u201d\nWilliam Martin, Vance\u2019s communications director, denied CNN\u2019s reporting in a statement: \u201cAs we\u2019ve said publicly, there was never a supposed meeting scheduled at the Vice President\u2019s residence to discuss Epstein Strategy. Any reporting to the contrary is false.\u201d\nThe Department of Justice did not respond to a request for comment for this story. The FBI declined to comment. Patel and Bondi have previously clashed over the administration\u2019s Epstein strategy.\nMeanwhile, CNN previously reported that the Justice Department has been digitizing, transcribing and redacting the interview materials as they weigh if and when to publicly release the information from the Maxwell interview. There is over 10 hours of audio, a senior Trump administration official said. Portions of the transcript that could reveal sensitive details like victim names would also have to be redacted, one of the officials said.\nOne official told CNN that some of the conversation within the White House has focused on whether making the details from the interview public would bring the Epstein controversy back to the surface. Many officials close to Trump believe the story has largely died down.\nTrump on Tuesday defended Blanche\u2019s recent sit-down with Maxwell, arguing that Blanche wanted to ensure that people who \u201caren\u2019t involved are not hurt\u201d by something \u201cvery unfair.\u201d\nOn Wednesday morning, the family of Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre issued a statement asking why no survivors had been invited to the meeting at Vance\u2019s home. They offered to attend in Giuffre\u2019s stead, as she died by suicide earlier this year.\n\u201cMissing from this group is, of course, any survivor of the vicious crimes of convicted perjurer and sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. Their voices must be heard, above all,\u201d wrote Giuffre\u2019s two brothers and sisters in law, Sky and Amanda Roberts and Danny and Lanette Wilson.\nAmid the clamor for more disclosures about the case, the House Oversight Committee on Tuesday issued nearly a dozen subpoenas to the Justice Department and high-profile Democratic and GOP figures for files and information related to Epstein \u2014 a significant show of defiance against Republican leaders.\nTwo of the administration officials said if they were to release the audio and transcript, it would likely be done sooner rather than later. One said the release could be several weeks from now, depending on what the most senior-level officials within the West Wing and Justice Department decide. It was not immediately clear whether the White House and DOJ were aligned on the issue.\n\u201cThis is nothing more than CNN trying desperately to create news out of old news. [Trump] already addressed this issue in an interview with Newsmax, a real news outlet that routinely gets better ratings than CNN,\u201d White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told CNN, when asked about the possibility of releasing the transcript.\nA lawyer for Maxwell declined to comment.\nBlanche interviewed Maxwell at the US attorney\u2019s office in Tallahassee, Florida, last month over a period of two days. Maxwell was sentenced in 2022 to 20 years in federal prison for carrying out a yearslong scheme with Epstein to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. She has continued to appeal her conviction, including with the Supreme Court.\nLast week, Maxwell was moved from a Florida federal prison to a lower-security federal prison camp in Texas, a relatively uncommon move as those convicted of sex offenses are almost always deemed too high of a risk to public safety.\nAs Trump has faced mounting pressure from his base for transparency, the White House has repeatedly said the DOJ should release all \u201ccredible evidence\u201d in the Epstein files.\nAsked about Blanche\u2019s meeting with Maxwell last week, Trump again said he\u2019d like to see everything in the files released.\n\u201cWe\u2019d like to release everything, but we don\u2019t want people to get hurt that shouldn\u2019t be hurt, and I would assume that was why he was there,\u201d Trump told Newsmax on Friday.\nThe president said he hadn\u2019t spoken to Blanche about his meetings with Maxwell and didn\u2019t know when that information would be made public.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t spoken about it, but he\u2019s a very talented guy, Todd Blanche, and a very straight shooter, and I think he probably wanted to know, you know, just to get a feeling of it,\u201d Trump said.\nCNN previously reported that a senior Trump administration official stated that the president is not currently considering clemency for Maxwell, though he has repeatedly left the door open on the matter in recent weeks, saying he\u2019s \u201callowed to do it.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Mi Seon Lee, Holmes Lybrand and Annie Grayer contributed to this report.\nThis story and headline have been significantly updated with additional reporting."

      "text": "Plenty of Republicans are walking a tricky line right now on the Jeffrey Epstein files. But few have walked one as tricky as congressional leadership in recent days.\nAsked about President Donald Trump potentially pardoning Epstein\u2019s convicted sex-trafficking accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell \u2013 something Trump conspicuously left the door open to Friday and then again Monday \u2013 House Speaker Mike Johnson punted on Sunday.\n\u201cWell, I mean, obviously that\u2019s a decision of the president,\u201d he told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d adding: \u201cI won\u2019t get in front of him. That\u2019s not my lane.\u201d\nWhen pressed, the Louisiana Republican relented a bit and said that the idea gave him \u201cgreat pause\u201d because of her \u201cunspeakable crimes\u201d \u2013 while again emphasizing that\u2019s \u201cnot my decision.\u201d\nSimilarly on Monday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune would not say if Trump should rule out a pardon for Maxwell.\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s up to him,\u201d the South Dakota Republican told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. \u201cBut it looks to me like she\u2019s going to spend a good long time in jail.\u201d\nMaxwell, who\u2019s serving 20 years, is a convicted sex trafficker. Of children. Leadership\u2019s message to Trump seemed to be: Please don\u2019t do it. But also, just in case you do pardon a sex trafficker of children, I need to cover myself and emphasize that you have the full right to do it.\nAnd they weren\u2019t the only Republicans to curiously avoid rejecting such a pardon. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about Maxwell or the conversation to even weigh in on that,\u201d Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday.\nSo why on earth are Republicans treating this seemingly unthinkable maneuver so gently?\nWould Trump actually do such a thing? And how on earth would that not blow up in his face?\nIt\u2019s difficult to see how. And indeed, this prospect seems to work better as a carrot for Maxwell, who met last week with the deputy attorney general, than as a legitimate possibility. You could certainly be forgiven for thinking Trump wants Maxwell to believe she might get a pardon \u2013 or other help in her ongoing appeals \u2013 even if that\u2019s not realistic.\nThe conventional wisdom among some on the left has been that Trump has indeed cued up a Maxwell pardon, ever since his administration made interviewing her its first big move to allay concerns about its handling of the Epstein files. The idea would be that Maxwell will say the things the Trump administration wants \u2013 such as clearing the president and/or implicating others \u2013 and he rewards her with a pardon.\nTrump certainly hasn\u2019t shied away from controversial pardons before. He has gone to historic lengths to pardon allies. He has granted clemency to virtually all January 6, 2021, defendants \u2013 including hundreds who were convicted of assaulting police.\nBut even against that backdrop, pardoning a convicted sex trafficker is on another level.\nLet\u2019s say Trump does it.\nThe idea would apparently be that Maxwell provides Trump and his team enough information that they can change the subject by focusing the conversation on other people she might implicate. (It\u2019s worth noting that Trump has not been accused of any wrongdoing in connection with Epstein.)\nBut what happens then? Maxwell clearly has a credibility issues and reason to say what helps her in this moment. And that\u2019s not just me saying it; it\u2019s Trump\u2019s own Justice Department, circa 2020, which called her a brazen liar. A pardon would only reinforce the idea that this was some kind of corrupt bargain.\nAbout the only way to combat that would be if she gave information that actually panned out. But justice takes a long time to be served. The Justice Department needs time to build cases, and those cases might or might not succeed. Are you really going to pardon her before any of that happens? What happens if the end result is that the only Epstein associate to actually be convicted walks free?\nIt also seems likely that a pardon would only add new fuel to a subject that Trump badly wants to move on from. If other people were implicated, that would create all kinds of threads to be pulled moving forward.\nThat would also inject new life into theories about a possible cover-up. The question would become whether these people were subjects in the various investigations, and whether those leads were followed up. It would also lead to questions about whether other people could be brought to justice, which would make withholding the Epstein files even more difficult for the Trump administration.\nAnd that\u2019s a very big risk here. Polls show huge numbers of Americans already believe there is some form of a cover-up at play. A Reuters-Ipsos poll this month showed Americans agreed 60-12% that the federal government was \u201chiding information\u201d about Epstein\u2019s death, and 69-6% that it was hiding information about his clients.\nThat latter belief was overwhelmingly bipartisan, with 82% of Democrats and 62% of Republicans agreeing. These people would have their fears confirmed \u2013 and probably would want to know more.\nAnd then there is just the \u201cyuck\u201d factor.\nTrump\u2019s January 6 pardons were highly unpopular; a February Washington Post-Ipsos poll showed Americans opposed the pardons of violent offenders 83-14%.\nAt the same time, the president doesn\u2019t seem to have paid much of a price. Those pardons during his first week back in office quickly faded amid a barrage of early Trump maneuvers that competed for the attention of the media and news consumers.\nBut the attack on the US Capitol was also years in the past by that point. People were probably unfamiliar with the many hundreds of defendants, and many Trump supporters had been convinced over many months that these people were railroaded. It just wasn\u2019t as much of a political hot potato, even as it was unseemly in most Americans\u2019 eyes.\nIt\u2019s difficult to see how a Maxwell pardon wouldn\u2019t instantly be news for days and weeks, because of how people feel about her crimes and the entire Epstein saga, and because of questions about whether this was some kind of corrupt trade. It would also force GOP lawmakers into some very uncomfortable interviews. (A president indeed has the power to pardon whomever he wants to. That doesn\u2019t mean every pardon is morally just.)\nFor all of the MAGA movement\u2019s seeming willingness to go along with whatever Trump says, it\u2019s hard to see how even much of the base would be okay with all that.\nThe question of whether Trump pardons Maxwell might not even be the right one. A better one might be whether Trump\u2019s Justice Department could do something else to help her \u2013 such as in her ongoing appeals.\nMaxwell\u2019s legal team has based its appeal around the idea that the 2008 non-prosecution agreement Epstein secured in Florida should have covered Maxwell. To this point, the Trump administration has rejected that argument, saying earlier this month that Maxwell was \u201cnot a party to the relevant agreement.\u201d Perhaps it could change its tune?\nEven that seems pretty far-fetched, though. While this would be a more limited step, it would still look pretty bad and would lead to all kinds of questions about quid pro quos with a convicted sex trafficker.\nIn the end, this debate seems a whole lot more valuable to Trump in the abstract than in reality. Maxwell didn\u2019t just talk to a top Trump appointee in the Justice Department last week, she could soon be testifying to Congress. What better way to guide what she says than to have her believe maybe the administration could do her a solid.\nOr perhaps this is just another example of Trump\u2019s strange commentary about Maxwell \u2013 remember \u201cI wish her well\u201d \u2013 and never wanting to rule things out. He loves to keep his options open, even when one of those options seems to be ridiculous.\nBut at least for now, it\u2019s apparently significant enough for Republicans to treat it as a real possibility. And that, in and of itself, is shocking."

      "text": "When Attorney General Pam Bondi briefed President Donald Trump in May on the Justice Department\u2019s review of the documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, she told him that his name appeared in the files, sources familiar with the discussion told CNN.\nThe conversation, which also included Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, was characterized by two White House officials as a \u201croutine briefing\u201d that covered the scope of the Justice Department\u2019s findings. Trump\u2019s name appearing in the files, they said, was not the sole focus of the discussions.\nBondi also raised in the meeting that several names of high-profile figures were also mentioned, and that investigators did not find evidence of a so-called client list or evidence refuting that Epstein died by suicide, the officials said.\nThe sources familiar with the department\u2019s review said the files appeared to include several unsubstantiated claims that the Justice Department found not to be credible, including those relating to Trump.\nIt wasn\u2019t clear in what context Trump\u2019s name appeared in the files. Like many high-powered people in 1990s New York, Trump was an associate of Epstein\u2019s, who worked to cultivate celebrities to burnish his business. The revelation that his name appears in the documents does little to advance previous knowledge about his ties to the late sex offender.\n\u201cThe White House is not surprised by this \u2013 Trump\u2019s name was present in the binders that Bondi produced and handed out,\u201d one of the White House officials said, adding that many of the materials already released by the Justice Department had included mention of the president\u2019s name.\n\u201cThe White House does not view this as groundbreaking or new or surprising at all,\u201d the official said, adding that there is no evidence that Trump was involved in any wrongdoing.\n\u201cThe fact is that the President kicked him out of his club for being a creep,\u201d White House communications director Steven Cheung said in a statement to CNN, referring to Epstein. \u201cThis is nothing more than a continuation of the fake news stories concocted by the Democrats and the liberal media, just like the Obama Russiagate scandal, which President Trump was right about.\u201d\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported that Bondi informed Trump in May about his name appearing in the documents.\nThe revelations about the meeting contradict Trump\u2019s more recent denials that he was told he was in the files.\nPressed last week on whether Bondi had told him he was named in the documents, he said, \u201cNo, no. She\u2019s given us just a very quick briefing.\u201d\nTrump has struggled to tamp down weeks of backlash over the administration\u2019s decision not to release more documents related to the Epstein investigation \u2014 a move that infuriated a vocal segment of the MAGA base and put the president at odds with some of his most ardent supporters.\nInside the White House, officials were outraged that Bondi did not redact Trump\u2019s name from publicly available materials contained in Epstein binders distributed to influencers in February, sources said. Her failure to protect the president during the episode has been a longstanding point of contention between the DOJ and the White House.\n\u201cThe DOJ and FBI reviewed the Epstein Files and reached the conclusion set out in the July 6 memo,\u201d Bondi and Blanche said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cNothing in the files warranted further investigation or prosecution, and we have filed a motion in court to unseal the underlying grand jury transcripts. As part of our routine briefing, we made the President aware of the findings.\u201d\nThe White House has dismissed the ongoing focus on the Epstein files, arguing that it\u2019s distracting from the administration\u2019s accomplishments and aiding Democrats\u2019 efforts to damage the president.\nBut a growing and bipartisan chorus of lawmakers have since called for a full release of the documents, forcing Republican leaders on Capitol Hill to cut short their legislative session to avoid taking a series of votes on the matter. But before leaving town, a House Oversight subcommittee voted Wednesday to subpoena the Department of Justice to release files related to Epstein.\nA Wall Street Journal report last week \u2013 about a letter bearing Trump\u2019s name and the outline of a naked woman that was included in an album given to Epstein for his 50th birthday in 2003 \u2013 has also ratcheted up the pressure on Trump.\nTrump denied writing the letter and has since sued the Wall Street Journal over its publication of that article.\nCNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak, Paula Reid and Kit Maher contributed to this report."

Despite promises of transparency, key figures in the administration have been accused of prioritizing political concerns over the voices of victims, with no survivors represented in recent high-level meetings. The ongoing controversy raises questions about potential cover-ups and the administration's treatment of Epstein's accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell, amid fears that political maneuvers could further harm the victims and their families.",
