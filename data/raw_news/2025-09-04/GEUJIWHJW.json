  "title": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra $300 off, but only in these two colors",
  "description": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra has very little competition in the premium phone market, especially if you can catch it at this discounted price.",
  "content": "Samsung\u2019s most exciting phones right now include foldables, flip phones, and a super-thin phone. These are cool, but if you want true performance and an overall premium experience, you can\u2019t beat the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra. We would argue it is still Samsung\u2019s best phone, and you can often catch better deals on it. It\u2019s currently as cheap as $999.99, which is a $300 discount. Buy the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra for just $999.99 ($300 off)\n\nThis offer is available from Amazon, but the maximum discount only applies to the Titanium Silverblue and Titanium Whitesilver color models. The other hues will increase the price to nearly $1,050, arguably still a good deal.\n\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra Simply put, this is Samsung's very best phone for 2025. The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is a 6.9-inch QHD+ device with 12GB of RAM, 256GB+ of storage, embedded S Pen, and the overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC. The key upgrade over the lower S25 models is a 200MP main camera and 100x Space Zoom.\n\nNot only is the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra arguably the company\u2019s best phone, but we also list it as the top premium option in our list of the best Android phones. It\u2019s a true flagship device with little to no sacrifices.\n\nPerformance will be second to none, featuring a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite and 12GB of RAM. This is enough to handle pretty much any app, game, or task.\n\nYou\u2019ll be able to see everything in full glory, too. It comes with a large 6.9-inch Dynamic LTPO AMOLED 2X panel, known for its deep blacks and vibrant colors. The definition is crisp at 3,120 x 1,440, and you also get a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. Not to mention, it\u2019s one of the very few phones with an included stylus. The S Pen will offer a very intuitive and handy way to interact with the phone.\n\nWe know many of you care a lot about camera performance, and the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra won\u2019t fall behind in this department. It has high-quality cameras and is one of the most versatile camera phones around. Whether you\u2019re shooting portraits, landscapes, or something far away, it has the necessary lenses to cover most people\u2019s needs.\n\nEven the battery life is great. Despite pushing so much performance and having a huge high-end screen, we managed to get about two full days of battery per charge during our testing.\n\nThe design is also up there with the best, featuring a sleek Samsung look with a titanium frame and Gorilla Glass 2. Of course, it gets an IP68 rating for outstanding water and dust resistance. This makes it a great phone to keep for years to come, so Sammy also includes a seven-year update commitment, which happens to be among the best in the industry.\n\nDo we have any complaints? Well, the main one is the price, but that gets much better with this discount. At $999.99, this price is pretty nice for what many would consider the very best phone in the industry.",

Learn more.\nSamsung S Pen: The ultimate guide\nJanuary 22, 2025\nThe S Pen has been one of the standout features on Samsung flagships for many years. First integrated with the Note line, the S Pen is now a core part of the Galaxy S Ultra models, newer foldables, and top-line tablets. No longer is the stylus only useful to creatives and scribes, either. The pen makes interacting with your device a more organic experience, whether you jot down notes, revel in remote photography, or annotate existing content.\nBelow, we detail everything you should know about the S Pen, from the models available, device compatibility, and its swathe of features.\nWhat is the Samsung S Pen?\nThe S Pen is Samsung\u2019s stylus for mobile devices. Initially a core part of the Galaxy Note series, it has since been offered as an add-on for Samsung\u2019s foldables, built into Galaxy S series flagships, and alongside the company\u2019s best tablets. Although there are now multiple S Pen models, they all share similar basic functionality.\nBuilt-in S Pen for phones\nThe smallest S Pen model is the one many will know and love. You\u2019ll find them wedged within Samsung\u2019s phones. Most of these are powered by a super-capacitor, which charges quickly and provides around 30 minutes of usage per charge. This also makes for a fairly lightweight and efficient device. Samsung believes the S Pen uses just 0.5mAh per full charge if never used or 100mAh per charge if highly used. For reference, 0.5mAh is 0.01% of the 5,000mAh battery in the Galaxy S23 Ultra. Notably, the S Pen also works without a charge, but you lose out on some software gadgetry.\nSince the Galaxy Note 9, many of the built-in S Pens offered on Samsung\u2019s phones included Bluetooth functionality. However, with the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Samsung has removed Bluetooth from the stylus once again. This means this particular pen cannot utilize several stalwart S Pen features, including remote shutter smarts.\nNevertheless, Bluetooth-enabled pens don\u2019t require manual pairing like other styli. This also means a fairly generous range of 30 feet, which makes the S Pen (through its built-in button) extremely useful as a remote shutter for photography. For jotters, the pen uses a 0.7mm tip and can recognize up to 4,096 pressure levels on the Galaxy S22 Ultra, Galaxy S23 Ultra, and Galaxy S24 Ultra. This is equivalent to the Microsoft Surface Pen 2 and most Wacom styli.\nIf you lose or break your S Pen, you can grab replacements online, but this model usually comes free with the device. You can also switch out the tips of the S Pen if desired.\nBundled S Pen for tablets\nSamsung also bundles an S Pen with its tablets. While these are functionally similar to the S Pen for its phones, they differ in size, charging method, and how they\u2019re stored.\nLet\u2019s address the first point first. The Galaxy Tab S9 series S Pen weighs just under 9g, with dimensions of 8.2 x 145 x 7.7mm, whereas the Galaxy S23 Ultra S Pen measures 5.8 x 105 x 4.4mm, weighing just 3g. The phone stylus is smaller as it\u2019s stored within the device body, while the tablet S Pen is clipped onto the rear using magnets. Notably, that\u2019s also how it\u2019s charged.\nSamsung also sells more niche S Pen models for its foldables, those who want a stylus that works across every Samsung device, and creative users looking for more control.\nS Pen Fold Edition\nThe S Pen Fold Edition is specifically made for Samsung\u2019s foldable phones. This particular model works with the Galaxy Z Fold 6, 5, 4, and 3. Notably, the stylus is never bundled with the company\u2019s foldable phones. Users are required to purchase it separately.\nThis pen doesn\u2019t support Bluetooth but does feature an auto-retractable tip that gives at a force of 500 gf (gram force) or greater. This means it\u2019s much kinder to fragile foldable phone displays. Moreover, you don\u2019t need to charge the S Pen Fold Edition, which means no need for a dedicated charging slot or hardware.\nS Pen Pro\nThe S Pen Pro is Samsung\u2019s more serious and larger stylus for creatives. Launched in 2021, the Pro supports Bluetooth and packs a 16-day battery that\u2019s charged via a USB-C hidden at its end. It can also be used with multiple devices and switch between them using the Pair button.\nInterestingly, the S Pen Pro also features a retractable tip for use on Samsung\u2019s foldables, but it can be locked in place when used on a phone or tablet using the Mode switch.\nOverall, the S Pen Pro is the priciest aftermarket Samsung stylus you can buy, but its wide compatibility with Samsung devices, old and new, makes up for that.\nS Pen Creator Edition\nFinally, Samsung\u2019s latest stylus is the S Pen Creator Edition. Launched with the Galaxy Tab S9 series but sold separately as an accessory, the passive stylus resembles the Apple Pencil, with an increased diameter for a more comfortable hold.\nUnlike the S Pen Pro and S Pen Fold Edition, the Creator Edition doesn\u2019t have a retractable tip, so it cannot be used on Samsung\u2019s foldable phones. However, it supports various pressure levels and tilt sensitivity for shading. As mentioned, the Creator Edition is passive, lacking a built-in battery and the usual S Pen smart features you might expect.\nWhich devices support the S Pen?\nAs of 2023, several Samsung phones and mobile devices support the S Pen. Here are some of the newer devices that fall into this category listed by Samsung.\nSamsung phones\nEvery Samsung Galaxy Note model has a built-in S Pen. Galaxy S Ultra devices from the S21 series also support the S Pen but only feature built-in styli from the S22 Ultra onwards. The Galaxy Z Fold 6, 5, 4, and 3 support the S Pen Fold Edition. Also, the S Pen Pro Edition works with all the devices mentioned below.\n- Galaxy S25 Ultra\n- Galaxy S24 Ultra\n- Galaxy S23 Ultra\n- Galaxy S22 Ultra\n- Galaxy S21 Ultra 5G\n- Galaxy Z Fold 6\n- Galaxy Z Fold 5\n- Galaxy Z Fold 4\n- Galaxy Z Fold 3\n- Galaxy Note series\nSamsung tablets\nUnfortunately, none of Samsung\u2019s newer Tab A models support the S Pen. If you want a budget tablet with S Pen support, consider buying the older Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2019) or the Galaxy Tab A 8.0 (2019). It\u2019s worth noting that Samsung no longer supports these models. The S Pen Pro Edition should also work with the devices listed below.\n- Galaxy Tab S10 series\n- Galaxy Tab S9 series (incl. S9 FE)\n- Galaxy Tab S8 series\n- Galaxy Tab S7 series\n- Galaxy Tab S6 series\n- Galaxy Tab Active Pro\n- Galaxy Tab Active 3\nOther Samsung devices\nSamsung\u2019s third- and fourth-generation Galaxy Book 360 Windows machines are the newest notebooks to pack S Pen support. The S Pen Pro Edition can be used with most of these devices, including:\n- Galaxy Book 4 Pro 360\n- Galaxy Book 4 360\n- Galaxy Book 3 Pro 360\n- Galaxy Book 3 360\nS Pen basic features\nAir View: Air View lets you glean quick information by hovering the stylus close to bits of information. It works best in Samsung\u2019s calendar and gallery apps.\nDirect Writing Input: This lets you fill out text fields on your phone with actual writing. You can enable this in two ways. The Samsung Keyboard has the Pen Detection option in the Handwriting section of its settings menu to recognize when the S Pen is out. It will automatically open the writing pad when blank text fields are selected. You can also enable the S Pen to text function to write directly in search boxes.\nScreen Off Memo: A classic Note feature. You can take notes on your device without unlocking the screen. Remove the S Pen while the screen is off and follow the on-screen prompts to use the feature. You can save these notes to Samsung\u2019s note app, record multiple notes, erase what you wrote, and even change the thickness of the digital ink.\nPENUP: This is a social network of sorts for Samsung Note owners. You can create drawings, color in existing drawings, and share your artwork across the collective. It comes stock on the device, but you can uninstall it if you don\u2019t want it. It is also available in the Google Play Store if you change your mind.\nChange S Pen ink color: Back in the day, there were some instances (like the Screen Off Memo) where you could only select between white and your actual S Pen color. However, you can almost always select your S Pen ink color on modern devices, so this is a non-issue.\nVisible Pointer: You can set the device to show a pointer graphic when the S Pen is close enough to the screen. This is an old feature and on by default.\nGalaxy AI features: The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra and Galaxy Z Fold 6 have a few nifty AI tricks that improve existing S Pen features. Note that these features don\u2019t inherently rely on the S Pen to function, as they\u2019re also available on the S24 and S24 Plus, but the stylus does make using these features a little easier.\n- Circle To Search lets users quickly open a contextual Google Search of an item they highlight on their screen.\n- Summarization and Note Assist dovetails with the S Pen\u2019s intended use \u2014 notation. The feature lets users tidy up their handwritten notes and offer summarization options for this content. These aren\u2019t specifically related to the S Pen and can also be used on the S24, S24 Plus, and several older Samsung flagships.\n- Sketch to Image isn\u2019t an exclusive S Pen feature, but the stylus makes it much easier use. In short, Sketch to Image does exactly what it says on the tin. Users can modify existing images by drawing a simple sketch on them. Galaxy AI will then add your generative AI-transformed photorealistic sketch to the image. The feature is accessible through the Smart Select feature.\nAir Command features\nAir Command: This is the native interface for all the various functions. It appears by default by removing the S Pen from the device while the screen is on. Earlier versions of the Note used a rotary-style graphic. However, Samsung lets you choose between compact or near full-screen styles in the settings.\nNotes: What do you normally do with a pen? There are two Air Command functions for note-taking. The first creates a new note and the second opens the Samsung Notes app to view previous notes. Notes sync across devices via your Samsung account if you buy a new Samsung device later. You can also add the View all notes Air Command to view every note you\u2019ve made.\nScreen Write: Screen Write takes a screenshot of the entire screen. It immediately opens an interface where you can write on the screenshot. From there, you can save it, share it, or stylize it in other ways. On newer Note devices, you can also opt to have the screenshot function take scrolling screenshots if needed.\nSmart Select: Smart Select is our favorite way of taking a screenshot. You can use the S Pen to draw a shape anywhere on the screen, and the phone will screenshot just that portion of the screen. This is so much better than taking super tall screenshots and cropping them down when you just need a little extra information. There is also an option to capture animation within a defined area. Smart Select turns it into a GIF for easy sharing. It featured an update with One UI 6.1.1 and now feels and functions more like Circle to Search. It also boasts a new animation and additional menu options, including Sketch to Image \u2014 a new generative AI feature that creates or modifies an image based on a simple sketch. When used with the S Pen Pro, this feature also allows you to share clippings across devices.\nTranslate: Hover the S Pen over a word in a foreign language, select Translate, and the phone translates it. The feature uses Google Translate, and we appreciate Samsung using something tried and true. You can also listen to the word with the small sound icon next to the translation.\nMagnify: Hover over items on your screen, and select Magnify to make elements bigger and easier to read. You can magnify things by 150%, 200%, 250%, and 300%. There is also a toggle to slightly change how the area is magnified, but we couldn\u2019t tell much difference. The magnification window is also a decent size.\nGlance: Glance is an excellent tool for multitasking. It makes any app work in picture-in-picture mode. Open an app, engage Glance, and the app becomes a small thumbnail. Hover over the thumbnail to view the app again in full-page mode. Move the little box with the S Pen to put it back in Glance mode. Drag the box to the top center of the screen to trash it and leave Glance mode.\nLive Message: Live Message is a fun little feature that debuted a few years ago. Write out a missive or draw a simple picture, and your device will turn it into a GIF. The GIF is shareable anywhere and works wherever GIFs work. This has no productivity value whatsoever, but it is fun. This also works with Samsung\u2019s AR Emoji feature and you can write on images you have on your device already as well.\nBixby Vision: This one is a bit polarizing. Bixby Vision is meant to identify things on your phone screen and show you information about it, like shopping links. Its best use is extracting text from an image with OCR or scanning a QR code, but other functionality isn\u2019t quite as polished as Google Lens.\nAR Doodle: AR Doodle is a feature on newer Note, Galaxy Tab, and Galaxy S devices. It opens your camera and lets you doodle on stuff. It recognizes surfaces and your environment so you can move the camera away from your doodle, start somewhere else, and then move back to the original. It\u2019s fun to mess around with and shows how fun AR can be sometimes.\nWrite on calendar: This is a shortcut to open your Samsung Calendar and use S Pen there. It doesn\u2019t do anything different from opening Samsung Calendar from the app drawer, and we only recommend using it if you\u2019re a fan of Samsung Calendar.\nAdd your own: Air Command lets you add your own apps to the S Pen shortcut wheel. We recommend adding apps you use the stylus with a lot. For our testing, we even added the game Draw Something since the S Pen is extremely useful there.\nAccess S Pen settings: Once Air Command opens, click the cogwheel in the top left or bottom left corner (depending on your device) to access the S Pen\u2019s settings. It\u2019s the quickest way to get to those settings.\nHardware features\nThere are some extra little hardware features. Most of these have been present since the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 launch in 2018. These features can also be found on newer devices like the Galaxy S23 Ultra and S24 Ultra. The Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s passive S Pen may miss out on the features that require Bluetooth. The S Pen Pro also has a few unique hardware features of its own.\nWarn when S Pen is left behind: This is the one hardware feature from older versions of the S Pen. When it is removed from the device and separated from it, the parent device will constantly remind you it is missing until you put it back. It\u2019s a good way to avoid losing it.\nSmartThings Find: If you lose your stylus, the S Pen Pro can be located using SmartThings Find. The other S Pen models do not have this feature.\nKeep S Pen Connected: This is enabled by default. When enabled, it constantly keeps your S Pen connected to the phone. This uses extra battery power and was once referred to as Battery saver mode in previous devices. You can disable it if you want to save some battery, but your S-Pen may need manual reconnecting to your phone more often.\nAllow multiple S Pens: This option lets you connect a second S Pen while having one holstered inside the device. It slightly increases battery drain but lets you keep multiple S Pens connected simultaneously. If you have this enabled, you cannot disable the Keep S Pen Connected option.\nSound and Vibration: You can set the parent device to make an audible sound and vibrate slightly when you remove the S Pen from its holster. Both of these settings are set to on by default.\nUnlock with S Pen: You can set your device to unlock with the S Pen instead of a PIN, passcode, fingerprint scanner, and so on. It\u2019s a neat trick, but we don\u2019t recommend it. It\u2019s not a good idea to keep the key with the lock, so to speak.\nAir Actions: This was originally called Remote capabilities in previous devices, but now we know it as Air Actions. It lets you perform actions inside of apps with your S Pen. There is a dedicated menu in the S Pen settings where you can configure it per app. It\u2019s also where you find S Pen gesture commands as well.\nAnywhere actions: Anywhere actions is a subheader in the Air Actions settings menu. It lets you configure basic S Pen gestures to control your phone. You have back, home, recent, smart select, and screen write by default, but you can customize each gesture by clicking on it.\nHold down pen to open: You can also set the S Pen to open an app with a long press of the remote button. Unlike the actual remote function, you can open any app you want with this setting, but only one at a time. The stock Samsung camera app is the default.\nGeneral app actions: The S Pen has master controls for cameras and music playback. Samsung doesn\u2019t even require developers to include support. Your phone knows if you\u2019re using a media or camera app. You can turn these master controls off but can\u2019t edit or customize them.\nDevice switching: The S Pen Pro can be used across multiple devices simultaneously. When two devices are connected to the same Samsung account, tap the Connection button on the S Pen, then select Connect in the pop-up on the screen of the second device you wish to use. You can now use the stylus on the second device. It\u2019s not seamless, but it improves the stylus\u2019 utility.\nSamsung S Pen FAQs\nYes, the Galaxy S25 Ultra does feature a built-in S Pen. This edition of the stylus lacks Bluetooth, however, so several core S Pen features no longer work on this device.\nSome S Pen models, like the S Pen Pro, needs to be charged before you can use it. However, the S Pen Fold Edition and S Pen Creator Edition do not have batteries, so this isn\u2019t required.\nThe S Pen works on a wider array of devices than ever before, but not every Samsung phone or tablet is compatible with the S Pen.\nYes, the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra features an S Pen that slots into the phone.\nNo, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 does not come with an S Pen in the box, but you can purchase one separately.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is a big, brilliant phone that doesn't feel special enough to me anymore\nFebruary 15, 2025\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\nMSRP: $1,299.99\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra\nYou know that feeling when something comes out and you know that you should love it? Like when your favorite author drops a new title out of nowhere, even if it\u2019s not their typical genre, or your favorite football team signs a promising but injury-prone young player? On paper, you know that there\u2019s a ton of potential there, and your hopes should be sky-high. In reality, though, the experience isn\u2019t always what it\u2019s made out to be.\nFor me, that\u2019s what has happened with the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra after testing it for a couple of weeks. Even though I know I should be impressed by its new slate of Galaxy AI features, overclocked chipset, and flexible cameras, I can\u2019t help but think that Samsung\u2019s most expensive candy bar flagship falls a little flat. Here\u2019s why I feel somewhat let down \u2014 but why you might feel differently.\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s design is functional rather than fun\nNobody ever said that Samsung\u2019s massive, productivity-minded Galaxy S25 Ultra had to be the sleekest device around \u2014 nor did I expect it to be. I spent enough time with its predecessor, the Galaxy S24 Ultra, to know that there are only so many ways you can combine four cameras and an S Pen and still have room for a massive 5,000mAh battery. And yet, I remained hopeful that Samsung would at least find a way to keep its absolute beast of a flagship somewhat comfortable to use. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not so much the case for me.\nNow, I didn\u2019t expect it to fit perfectly in the palm of my hand \u2014 I\u2019m a small guy, and this is not a small phone. Huge phones don\u2019t work for me because I struggle to reach across a 6.7-inch (or larger) display, and I don\u2019t love when a device doesn\u2019t fit comfortably in my pocket. However, I\u2019m happy to make exceptions when phones feel well-designed, like the just-round-enough OnePlus 13 or the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL with a slightly softer aluminum frame. The problem, for me, is that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is neither of those things.\nInstead, someone at Samsung decided to merge the design of its largest flagship with that of its smallest. So, off went the rounded frame that made the Galaxy S24 Ultra manageable to hold, and in its place sits a flat, industrial slice of titanium that meets the front and rear glass at sharp right angles. It\u2019s almost identical to the frame on both the Galaxy S25 and the Galaxy S25 Plus, with an additional rear camera and an S Pen tucked along the bottom edge. For me and my small hands, though, the result is a phone that feels too big and blocky to be held comfortably. I need to use two hands with the Galaxy S25 Ultra at almost all times, and that\u2019s without even touching the S Pen.\nOf course, I know why Samsung made the changes it did. I know that it\u2019s better to have a series of flagships that all match and that the Ultra was always going to feel big to have enough space for its additional camera and stylus \u2014 that\u2019s just the way it is. I know that adopting tougher glass for the front and back panels is a substantial upgrade, especially if you want to live that caseless lifestyle \u2014 but please, as a guy who has had to repair a phone or two in his day, don\u2019t trust glass or titanium over concrete.\nAlso, if you\u2019re after a new phone that\u2019s simply gorgeous to sit and look at, I\u2019d recommend you keep moving. My colleague C. Scott Brown recently put together a list of the best-looking phones ever made, and to me, the Galaxy S25 Ultra deserves to be as far away from that list as possible. It\u2019s taken on a generic profile to the point where there\u2019s almost no personality left. The cameras sit in their own little islands once again, and the sharp frame makes the front and back panels of glass feel like they\u2019re so far apart.\nSamsung's choice of materials is excellent, but I wish it hadn't made the Galaxy S25 Ultra less comfortable to hold.\nWhile I have no real love for the size or shape of the Galaxy S25 Ultra, I can\u2019t fault Samsung\u2019s materials. Both the grade-five titanium frame and Corning Gorilla Armor 2 on the front and back feel like they could take a beating, whether you drop the phone on the sidewalk or let it take a tumble across your kitchen floor. I probably wouldn\u2019t recommend either one \u2014 it\u2019s a $1,300 phone, after all \u2014 but I\u2019m a little more confident carrying this Ultra without a case than I usually am. Besides, if I put a case on it, I won\u2019t be able to appreciate the satin finish that continues to be one of my favorites long after Samsung has given up on the Phantom branding. This year, my color of choice is a shade called Titanium Silverblue, which feels like a silly combination of three slightly different colors, yet it\u2019s spot-on in describing the pale blue finish.\nOf course, Samsung knows you\u2019re not about to buy the Galaxy S25 Ultra for its refreshed design. You might not even buy it for the S Pen \u2014 especially now that it comes without Bluetooth. But, what you should consider buying the Galaxy S25 Ultra for is its display, which is simply excellent. Of course it is \u2014 Samsung had to save something for its top-end launch. I\u2019d go so far as to say that I love the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s display, I just wish it were in a phone that\u2019s easier to wrangle, almost like it should fold in half for more comfortable carrying\u2026 call it a Galaxy Flip or something.\nAnyway, I\u2019ve yet to find an area where the 6.9-inch Dynamic 2X AMOLED panel struggles, from helping me keep up with Chelsea FC\u2019s not-a-title-race to exploring the new set of Space-Time Showdown cards in Pokemon TCG Pocket. The truly variable 1-120Hz refresh rate is buttery smooth, whether I\u2019m digging through a 38-hour Spotify playlist (not a joke) or trying to recap an entire week of Champion\u2019s League football at double speed (also, not a joke). Samsung\u2019s 2,600 nits of peak brightness might not quite match the 3,000 nits of the Pixel 9 Pro XL or the 4,500 nits of the OnePlus 13, but let\u2019s be honest \u2014 you\u2019re not going to notice a difference. I certainly didn\u2019t, whether I was navigating to drop a friend off at a metro station or doomscrolling before bed.\nMy last two points on the design of the Galaxy S25 Ultra are a little bit disappointing, but neither one is shocking. First, there is no full Qi2 support on Samsung\u2019s top-end flagship. Technically, the entire series is Qi2 Ready, which means it can work with magnetic accessories, but you\u2019ll need a specific magnetic case to add the functionality. Those magnets could also interfere with the S Pen, which is only made worse because it can\u2019t be used as a remote camera shutter anymore, either. Also, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is IP68 rated, which is still great, but we\u2019ve started to see much more affordable devices launch with IP69 protection from jets of water and heat. It would be nice to see Samsung do the same when there aren\u2019t too many other changes in store.\nQualcomm\u2019s overclocked Galaxy-exclusive chipset remains excellent\nAlthough Samsung\u2019s current hardware design falls incredibly flat for me, I can\u2019t argue with anything going on under the hood of the Galaxy S25 Ultra. It\u2019s tough to pack an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset with 12GB of RAM and up to 1TB of fixed storage and not perform like an absolute winner. Of course, you never know \u2014 I\u2019ve gone into reviews with high hopes, only to discover that a flagship can\u2019t keep up with its own thermal demands.\nBut the Galaxy S25 Ultra is not one of those flagships \u2014 this is a performer through and through based on our comparative benchmarks. As always, I loaded up our usual slate of CPU and GPU-intensive tests and put Samsung\u2019s numbers up against the best from Apple, Google, and OnePlus, taking on the top in-house processors and the standard version of Qualcomm\u2019s best chip at the same time.\nAs expected, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Ultra came ready to compete across all our tests. It didn\u2019t dominate the competition outright, falling short of the iPhone 16 Pro in single-core Geekbench performance and landing behind the OnePlus 13 across 20 runs of 3DMark\u2019s Wild Life test, but it checked every other box I asked of it along the way. It put up the highest PCMark score I\u2019ve ever seen, suggesting a better balance across various day-to-day tasks than its closest Android rivals.\nI\u2019m also slightly surprised to see how quickly the massive Galaxy S25 Ultra fell behind the OnePlus 13 in terms of GPU performance, though it remains comfortably ahead of competitors from Apple and Google. There\u2019s a good chance that\u2019s precisely where Samsung wants to be \u2014 it seems to treat the iPhone and Pixel as its main threats \u2014 but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the safest plan. To me, the OnePlus 13 is the best phone I\u2019ve used in a long time, and for Samsung to seemingly rule it out feels like a dangerous game.\nLuckily for Samsung, though, benchmarking never tells the whole story. Outside of occasionally being bettered on paper, the Galaxy S25 Ultra is a beast in daily life. As mentioned above, it\u2019s guided me comfortably through my winter of activities, from dropping friends at grad school visits to navigating me to the Apple Store when I needed to repair a device. It\u2019s been somewhat challenging to adopt the Galaxy S25 Ultra as my daily driver, given its massive size, yet I\u2019ve come back to it without fear any time streaming has been involved. It answered my call when I needed some post-hangover Super Bowl highlights, and it will continue to guide me when I have to find my way to the SEPTA station in Wilmington, Delaware, for the victory parade on Valentine\u2019s Day. Samsung\u2019s cooling setup is also strong enough to avoid the kind of overheating issues we saw with some of the earliest Snapdragon 8 Elite handsets.\nIt's tough to doubt a 'For Galaxy' chipset when Qualcomm comes up big time and time again.\nWith Samsung\u2019s ever-reliable 5,000mAh battery under the hood, I\u2019m not too worried about how the Galaxy S25 Ultra will handle a long day spanning three states. It\u2019s a beefy cell that doesn\u2019t seem to slow down very quickly, and I\u2019ve regularly been able to push it for two days away from a charger before I\u2019m worried about turning on power-saving mode. Also, this is usually where I\u2019d insert the results of our standardized battery drain test, which puts a phone through a gauntlet of everyday tasks like web browsing, video streaming, and camera capturing. Unfortunately, Samsung\u2019s top-level optimization has somewhat broken our test for now, with the Galaxy S25 Ultra preferring to save its juice rather than shift from one leg of the test to the next.\nSo, instead, you\u2019ll get my thoughts on the battery performance on an average day. In short, it\u2019s excellent. Although I\u2019m not pulling the Galaxy S25 Ultra out of my pocket and checking it quite as often as other phones when it\u2019s out, I tend to use it for longer stretches at a time. I\u2019ll start by checking a sports score or two from the Now Bar, only to find myself hopping from a video podcast on Spotify to checking off a few levels in Royal Match before I go back to check on the status of my pack stamina in Pokemon TCG Pocket. I\u2019ll occasionally spend a bit longer exploring some of the new Galaxy AI features, too, but we\u2019ll come back to those in a second.\nAnyway, when you knock out the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s massive cell, you\u2019ll tap into a charging experience that feels all too familiar. For what feels like the fifth year in a row, Samsung is sticking with 45W wired and 15W wireless charging for its most expensive flagship. Don\u2019t get me wrong, 45W wired speeds are pretty good \u2014 as long as you have the required USB PD PPS charger \u2014 but they no longer feel revolutionary or especially impressive. Motorola has surpassed Samsung with 68W speeds on its top Edges and Razrs, and OnePlus is even faster with 80W wired charging on the OnePlus 13.\nAs seen above, Samsung still has Apple and Google in a charging chokehold. Although Google updated its most premium Pixel 9 Pro XL with 37W wired speeds, it still demands an additional 20 minutes on the block before it\u2019s ready to get back in action. The iPhone 16 Pro is even worse, nearly doubling the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s charging time despite having the smallest battery of the current flagship crop.\nOf course, digging into Samsung\u2019s charging setup gives me another chance to bemoan its lack of proper Qi2 support. It\u2019s been two years since the Wireless Power Consortium launched its Apple-supported take on MagSafe, and I thought we\u2019d have native support by now. Instead, you have to buy a specific case for use with your already expensive phone, and adding magnets to the Galaxy S25 Ultra ultimately strips out one of its most unique features, the S Pen. It\u2019s a bit of a silly limitation on an extremely expensive device that otherwise delivers on just about every front.\nIs Samsung still a camera king?\nSticking with another typical Samsung strength, it\u2019s time to discuss the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s cameras. Most years, Samsung launches its new slate of flagships, and they slot comfortably onto our podium for the best Android camera phones that money can buy. Sometimes, Samsung even adds an exciting new wrinkle or two or at least a few megapixels to one of its sensors. This year, we got the latter.\nAt a glance, the four sensors that dot the rear panel of Gorilla Armor 2 look almost identical to those that came before. They still live in their individual rings, though those rings are slightly more robust this time around. And, in three out of four cases, they\u2019re identical to the previous generation. Samsung carried over the same primary and telephoto hardware from the Galaxy S25 Ultra, keeping a 200MP sensor as the star of the show and backing it with 10MP and 50MP lenses set to 3x and 5x optical zoom, respectively. The one difference, however, comes in the ultrawide sensor, which has jumped from 12MP to 50MP and expanded its maximum aperture from \u0192/2.2 to \u0192/1.9 to capture more light and offer a shallower depth of field. So, with that basic hardware rundown complete, let\u2019s check out some camera samples. Also, please forgive the general lack of color \u2014 winter in Baltimore is a difficult time to escape red bricks and gray skies, what can I say?\nDespite the overall sameness of the colors across most of my samples \u2014 thanks, default Samsung profile \u2014 I feel like the variety of zoom lengths and shooting modes offers a decent feel for the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s potential. While I think some of Samsung\u2019s punchier colors, like the orange of the glass bottles and the green of the Pitango Bakery sign, might thrive better in the spring and summer months, the sharpness in both photos is still excellent. I was especially impressed with the detail of the glass bottles as I was using Samsung\u2019s digital macro mode, which relies on the upgraded ultrawide sensor. It pulled solid detail out of the bottles themselves and the cement base in which they\u2019re encased without falling into the fuzzy macro trap some ultrawide cameras suffer from.\nAlso, while I\u2019m mostly unimpressed with Samsung\u2019s camera filters (as I\u2019ll discuss in a minute), I quite like the results of my custom filter when applied to the holly bush. It gives the berries a much warmer punch than reality, and the warmer colors are almost enough to make up for the snow I had to trudge through to find colorful plant life. I can\u2019t give Samsung too much credit for that filter, though, since it\u2019s based on an image I took with my Fujifilm X100V and then ran through Samsung\u2019s camera app.\nBy the way, if you\u2019ve read a recent Samsung Galaxy review, you probably remember us pointing out issues with motion blur, especially when snapping photos of pets. Well, I\u2019m happy to say that those issues have been largely cleaned up, at least in well-lit scenes. I\u2019ve been impressed with a few of the shots I\u2019ve captured of my friends\u2019 dogs running around my neighborhood park and had decent luck catching moving players at the Eagles\u2019 Super Bowl parade, both in bright daylight. Unfortunately, low-light scenes still throw a little bit of a wrench into the motion blur, as the slower shutter speed makes my tuxedo cats look like even more of a black-and-white blur than they already are.\nHowever, the spot where Samsung surprised me most was when I put it through its zoom paces. After all, Samsung has been bragging about hitting 100x on its Ultra-tier flagships for years, so you\u2019d expect the results to be pretty good. Well, I think they can be decent, but there\u2019s a limit to what Samsung\u2019s sensors can resolve with help from Galaxy AI. I reached out to shoot across Baltimore\u2019s harbor to capture the cranes that work day and night at the sugar factory and found myself decently pleased until I hit 30x zoom. Up to that point, the details looked fine, and the overall colors were good \u2014 if a bit dark against the very bright sky \u2014 and then I punched in to 100x zoom and got\u2026 something that looks like it was rendered in the Nintendo 64 classic Goldeneye. Sure, you can make out the lines and shapes of the crane, but they look more like a low-poly render than an image taken with a $1,300 smartphone.\nFlipping the camera around, Samsung\u2019s approach to selfies should be a good reminder that more isn\u2019t always better. I\u2019ve been far more impressed with the front-facing camera on the Galaxy S Ultra models ever since it ditched the 40MP sensor in favor of a 12MP version, picking up bigger pixels and ditching the need to bin along the way. I trust both Samsung\u2019s color science and edge detection in portrait mode, though I might like a slightly wider field of view for the wide selfies since it only really adds enough space if someone is standing right over my shoulder.\nWhile I\u2019d say that, on the whole, the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s cameras are pretty good (at least up to 30x zoom), I think that Samsung is relying on software upgrades more than ever. Because the sensors themselves aren\u2019t drastically different, I found myself digging into smaller features to find something worth getting excited about. In doing so, I spent a decent amount of time with Samsung\u2019s new set of camera filters, which are specifically designed to challenge Apple\u2019s Photographic Styles, and I also gave Samsung\u2019s Audio Eraser a shot, which is a Galaxy-flavored version of Google\u2019s Audio Magic Eraser.\nUnfortunately for Samsung, both features still need a bit of fine-tuning and polish before they\u2019re ready to take on their original inspirations. I couldn\u2019t find enough differentiation in any of the camera filters to want to pick one over the default profile, though I do like that you can create your own based on an existing image. I also struggled to control the Audio Eraser effectively, with its Auto setting taking out too much noise and the more specific sliders often failing to separate one audio source from another. That said, Samsung will probably push updates to both features over time, so I\u2019ll be curious to come back to them in the future.\nVideo shooters will also be happy to know that capturing clips on the Galaxy S25 Ultra remains excellent. You can shoot in up to 8K resolution at 30fps or 4K at up to 120fps from the rear cameras, and 4K at up to 60fps from the selfie shooter, and Samsung\u2019s stabilization remains rock-solid. There are also a few new pro-grade wrinkles to dig into, like the ability to shoot in Log format for later color-grading or the Audio Eraser tool I mentioned above. I\u2019ll probably skip recording in Log myself, but I\u2019m glad to see Samsung taking on Apple\u2019s ProRes Log support.\nYou can also check out full-size versions of these camera samples and many more at this Google Drive link.\nOne UI 7 is great, no matter how you feel about Galaxy AI\nWhile the camera wrinkles might not have landed perfectly for me, they were far from enough to spoil the rest of my Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra experience. Most of the new modifications to One UI 7 and updates to Galaxy AI kept me using the monster of a phone even after complaining about its overall footprint. I\u2019d even go so far as to forgive Samsung for making us wait so long to get full access to Android 15 once the Galaxy S25 series came out \u2014 especially considering Google beat it to the punch by several months on the Pixel 9 series.\nAnyway, my first hint that Samsung had spent a good long time revamping its Galaxy AI experience was when I went to test out the updated version of its Portrait Studio. See, I was less than impressed when the feature launched last year and only really preserved one human face from a photo at a time, so this year, when it got added into the Drawing Assist experience and paired with a Galaxy AI image generator, it gave me a lot more hope. The new results are significantly better than before, and they hold onto other things about your subject, like their original clothes and almost \u2014 I mean almost \u2014 a semblance of the original background. Drawing Assist struggles when it can\u2019t find a human face, though, occasionally turning my friends into bridges or sunset scenes.\nSamsung also decided to lightly copy Apple\u2019s Dynamic Island but, like most Android developers, wanted to do Apple one better. Thus, the Now Brief and Now Bar were born. In Samsung\u2019s case, the Now Bar is closer to a Dynamic Island-like experience, popping up in your notification bar with score updates, weather forecasts, and more bits of information throughout the day, while the Now Brief is more of a one-stop shop. It appears on your lock screen and home screen several times throughout the day, giving you an easy breakdown of the weather and your upcoming appointments. It\u2019s largely felt impressive to me, though I can\u2019t say I love the politically charged news articles, especially when most other briefings tune their recommendations to your interests.\nSamsung's Galaxy AI theme park is more crowded than ever, but is it worth the price to ride?\nOh, and I guess I can officially bid farewell to my friend and yours, Bixby. After automatically mapping the power button on the previous Galaxy S24 series to open the in-house assistant, that button now launches a Gemini interface, which you can use to complete tasks across apps. Unfortunately for Bixby, I couldn\u2019t be happier. Gemini is faster and more responsive when I ask it for specific context, and I\u2019m already more familiar with the interface after spending most of my time with a Pixel in my pocket. It became my go-to plumbing partner when I needed to fix my kitchen sink, and I\u2019ve been counting on it to help me make plans to reach Broad Street in Philadelphia for one more Super Bowl celebration.\nOf course, the rest of Samsung\u2019s well-established Galaxy AI features are also back. Circle to Search remains really, really good, and Samsung\u2019s Object Eraser in the Gallery app is more accurate than ever \u2014 especially when compared to the state of Apple\u2019s Clean Up feature. I still haven\u2019t found a love for the Writing Assist tools, but I write for a living, so that\u2019s one piece of my job that I will defend until the end.\nOutside of Galaxy AI, though, the rest of Samsung\u2019s One UI 7 experience is just as good, if not better. The Galaxy S25 Ultra is in line for seven years of overall updates and already feels excellent, with redesigned widgets, better color-matching for app icons to your wallpapers, and redesigned default icons that look and feel a little more lively than they used to. I\u2019m not as in love with the split of notifications into one pulldown menu and quick settings into another, but I\u2019m slowly getting used to it after a few weeks with the phone \u2014 and I can\u2019t find the correct setting to restore it to the previous One UI 6 layout. Also, the side-scrolling app drawer is no more; you can finally set your Galaxy S25 up with a vertical, alphabetized drawer, and it\u2019s made my life so much easier.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra review verdict: A brilliant phone that\u2019s not for me\nSo, at this point, there\u2019s little doubt left as to how I feel about the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: It\u2019s an excellent Android super-phone that packs all of the features, software support, and premium materials you could ask for, but it\u2019s just not the phone for me. Has it impressed me at almost every turn? Yes, and it certainly deserves praise for that. It\u2019s an objectively excellent phone that largely reminds me why Samsung isn\u2019t all that afraid of what Google, OnePlus, or Motorola comes up with because it just has to rinse and repeat with the things that work and make them just a tiny bit better. In my eyes, though, it\u2019s just too big for me to want to carry it every day, and after another year of minor iteration, it\u2019s not doing enough new to convince me to look past that.\nAnd yes, I know that\u2019s a tough reason to knock a phone so severely that I put my SIM in something else, but it\u2019s true. If they say that the best camera is the one you have with you, then the best phone is probably also the one that you want to carry. Unfortunately, that means carrying something smaller, even if I have to give up on a little bit of battery life or reach for cameras that don\u2019t quite scratch 100x zoom. On the bright side, though, that also means that Samsung has at least one other phone that would fit my needs much better \u2014 and another one pretty soon that we\u2019ve already been teased with.\nI know that the Galaxy S25 Ultra is brilliant, but it's too big for me to fall in love.\nThe base Galaxy S25 ($809.99 at Amazon) and the Galaxy S25 Plus ($999.99 at Amazon) deliver the bulk of the same experience, offering the same number of software updates, the same stable of Galaxy AI features, and similar overall materials while not putting nearly as much strain on your wallet. As someone who doesn\u2019t use the S Pen hardly ever and came away not too impressed with Samsung\u2019s 100x zoom, I would be just as happy with a phone that fits comfortably in my hand and tops out at a usable 30x zoom. That said, if you have a semi-recent Galaxy S phone, you\u2019re almost certainly better off hanging onto it as the upgrades on offer from Samsung across the entire series are pretty meager this year \u2014 or at least wait until we have more info on the still-mysterious Galaxy S25 Edge.\nPerhaps the best way to describe Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Ultra is this \u2014 it\u2019s a big, powerful phone that doesn\u2019t feel special enough anymore. And while Samsung may not want to admit it, its closest rivals are more competitive than ever.\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel 9 series might still lose in a raw power foot race, but it has been running Android 15 for months and seems determined to advance its overall design and build quality much faster than Samsung. Google also did something I\u2019d been begging for for years and introduced a smaller Pixel 9 Pro ($999 at Amazon) that I find much more comfortable to use than the Pixel 9 Pro XL ($1099 at Amazon). I also think that Google still has an edge in terms of camera processing, with its AI-powered editing features proving just a little bit more reliable than Samsung\u2019, plus you save a bit of cash, which is always a big factor.\nThere\u2019s also Samsung\u2019s major market competition, the iPhone 16 Pro ($999 at Amazon) and Pro Max ($1199 at Amazon). As always, Apple\u2019s most expensive flagships feel like they\u2019ve been tailor-made to challenge Samsung, finally jumping into the AI race and picking up new hardware buttons along the way. So far, Apple has introduced its own take on just about all of the AI features that Google and Samsung have tried, debuting Clean Up to take on the Object Eraser, Image Playground to take on the Portrait Studio, and a slate of writing tools to help clean up your messages. However, the biggest hurdle to picking up an iPhone will still be that you have to give up many of the Android comforts that brought you to Samsung in the first place and will likely have to buy a new suite of accessories \u2014 albeit with far more variety to choose from.\nThe S25 Ultra is the definition of Samsung playing it safe, and the more reasonably priced flagships from both Google and OnePlus are starting to loom very large.\nTo me, though, the real dark horse that Samsung should be worried about snatching away Android power users is the OnePlus 13 ($899.99 at OnePlus) \u2014 a phone that blew me away while reviewing it. Although the lack of official carrier availability will hurt OnePlus\u2019s overall popularity, everything else about its latest flagship should make Samsung sweat. It bumped to an IP69 rating in addition to its IP68 protection, upgraded to even better Hasselblad-tuned cameras that are pretty impressive past 100x zoom, and picked up a slightly rounded body that\u2019s still extremely comfortable to hold despite the massive 6.82-inch display. And again, just like Google, you\u2019ll save yourself some cash with it thanks to the relatively massive $400 price gap.\nOnePlus might still be behind the best Android phones in terms of its software update commitment, but I have to say, switching to the S25 Ultra \u2014 one of the most competent, yet safest plays we\u2019ve seen from Samsung to date \u2014 made me long to go back to a flagship that was genuinely pushing the envelope and didn\u2019t remotely feel like it was settling.\n- Premium materials\n- Great battery life\n- Solid cameras\n- Top-tier Snapdragon performance\n- Brilliant display\n- Excellent software policy\n- Downgraded S Pen\n- Mostly AI-based upgrades\n- Still no full Qi2 support\n- Can be uncomfortable to hold\n- Very expensive\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nHere are the phone update policies from every major Android manufacturer\nApril 15, 2025\nIf you have an Android smartphone, you likely want it to last as long as possible, especially if you\u2019ve spent upwards of $1,000 on a flagship model. You probably have a case to protect it physically, but what about the software inside the phone? How can you keep that safe? This is where phone updates come into play \u2014 an integral aspect of keeping your phone working its best long after you buy it.\nUnfortunately, the company that created your phone plays a major part in how frequently you see updates, not to mention for how long. In this guide, we\u2019re going to give you all the info you need on phone updates as well as what you can expect from the major manufacturers.\nPhone updates: What are they, and where do they come from?\nIn the Android world, there are two types of smartphone updates. There are major upgrades to a new version of Android that usually land once a year. The more frequent type is a security patch, which lands on a monthly, bi-monthly, or quarterly basis. For the sake of clarity, we\u2019re going to refer to the former as upgrades and the latter as patches.\n- Upgrades \u2014 This is when your phone jumps from one Android version to another. For example, if your device has Android 13 and gets an update that takes it to Android 14, that\u2019s an upgrade. These usually come once a year and represent a major shift in the functionality and sometimes even the overall look of your phone\u2019s software.\n- Patches \u2014 These are smaller and more frequent. The main reason these land is to enhance the security of your phone. Sometimes they also include new features, although this will heavily depend on your phone\u2019s manufacturer.\nWhich smartphone manufacturer do you trust the most for software updates?\nGoogle \u2014 which owns and maintains the Android operating system \u2014 is responsible for creating and issuing both upgrades and patches. This is why Google\u2019s Pixel phones usually see upgrades and patches first. For phones not manufactured by Google, upgrades and patches need to go through the manufacturer first so it can modify code to accommodate specific products. In most cases, this slows down distribution. Likewise, carriers and chipset vendors may also delay rollouts for a variety of reasons.\nUltimately, how frequently your phone receives updates depends on how seriously your phone\u2019s manufacturer takes them. Simply put, some Android manufacturers place more importance on updates than others. Below, you\u2019ll see how much of a difference there can be!\nApple\n- Apple\u2019s stated commitment is five years of software support, but that\u2019s only the minimum. In reality, the company usually offers at least six years of support for all its phones, even those in the budget SE line.\nObviously, Apple is not an Android manufacturer, but it\u2019s helpful to have it on this list for the sake of comparison. Only recently did we find out what Apple\u2019s stated commitment is for iPhone software updates: five years. That would be five years of iOS upgrades and security patches.\nHowever, Apple exceeds this commitment nearly all the time. Most iPhones \u2014 from the most expensive Pro Max model to the cheapest SE model \u2014 get at least six years of support. The five-year commitment is just as low as Apple would ever go, but we doubt it would ever shelve an iPhone at the five-year mark.\nYou\u2019ll find, as you continue this article, that this commitment puts the majority of Android OEMs to shame.\nASUS\n- ASUS typically offers two upgrades and at least two years of security patches for its lineup.\nTypically, ASUS doesn\u2019t release a significant number of phones each year. One would assume this would mean the company would have a stellar phone update policy since it only needs to focus on a handful of devices. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not really the case.\nThe company promised at least two major upgrades for ASUS\u2019 most recent flagships in the Zenfone and ROG Phone ranges. ASUS also said its most recent phones would receive security updates for four years, with the ZenFone 12 Ultra extending this by a year. This is much better than its previous commitment, which was just two years of security patches. Unfortunately, some ASUS phones still stick to that policy.\nTwo Android upgrades and two years of patches represent Google\u2019s recommended minimum for after-purchase support. In other words, ASUS is only making the minimum promise for most of its devices.\nASUS\u2019 delivery of timely updates has also been mixed over the years. With the Zenfone 8, for example, ASUS pushed the Android 12 update in early January 2022, roughly three months after the stable launch. Previously, it pushed Android 11 to the Zenfone 7 series in April 2021 \u2014 roughly eight months after the stable launch of the operating system. This shows ASUS is getting faster, which is good, but its commitment could be stronger.\n- Google set a new benchmark with the Pixel 8 series, committing to seven upgrades and seven years of security patches. Most of its lineup promises three upgrades and five years of security patches. Everything before the Pixel 6 series, however, only receives three years of patches.\nFrom 2016 to mid-2021, Google had a phone update policy for Pixels that was not too bad: three years of upgrades and patches. This was better than most other companies, and Google\u2019s consistency was very impressive. Pixel phones are almost always the first to see the newest upgrade, and patches land at the beginning of each month like clockwork.\nGoogle is one of the best companies when it comes to keeping its phones up-to-date and safe.\nIn 2021, with the launch of the Google Pixel 6 series, the company augmented its policy. The Pixel 6 and Pixel 7 series will see three upgrades and five years of patches. Unfortunately, Pixels launched before the Pixel 6 series will stick with the former policy. But Google didn\u2019t stop there. With the launch of the Pixel 8 series, though, Google set a new high watermark for Android phone support. The smartphone duo will see seven upgrades, with seven years of security updates. The company has since extended this policy to the mid-range Pixel 8a, making it the best-supported phone under $500. The newer Pixel 9a shares this promise.\nGoogle also has a great website that details exactly when its devices will stop receiving upgrades and patches. Without a doubt, Google helps set the bar for phone updates in the world of Android.\nHMD Global / Nokia\n- HMD Global typically offers two upgrades and two or three years of security patches for Nokia-branded phones.\nHMD Global manufactures smartphones with Nokia branding. Nokia phones come with a version of Android that is very close to stock. Originally, this helped HMD keep its phones up-to-date quickly and consistently because it didn\u2019t need to change much when Google pushed out the core update.\nHowever, HMD has fallen off the wagon over the past few years. A combination of an increasingly complex portfolio, as well as small profit margins for its budget-priced devices, likely contributed to this. At this point, HMD doesn\u2019t have a stated comprehensive phone update policy.\nThankfully, the company recently posted a page on its website to help people determine how long their phones will receive patches. A 2023 phone like the G22, for example, will receive three years of security updates through April 2026. Based on the website, many devices will receive security updates for a minimum of two years, with some devices seeing security updates for up to three years.\nThat\u2019s pretty par for the course, but HMD\u2019s track record with respect to upgrades isn\u2019t as good. Most of its older phones saw Android 11 after considerable delays, for example.\nHONOR\n- In most cases, HONOR commits to two upgrades and two years of security patches. However, recent HONOR Magic Pro models get special treatment with three upgrade commitments and five years of patches. The company extends this to seven years with the Magic 7 Pro.\nHONOR used to be a subsidiary of HUAWEI. Shortly after the HUAWEI ban took effect, HUAWEI sold HONOR to an independent firm, making HONOR its own brand without any ties to its former parent. Since then, it has only launched a handful of phones.\nSince that all happened, HONOR has committed to the standard phone update policy for most of its phones: two years of upgrades and patches. Even its 2022 flagship \u2014 the HONOR Magic 4 Pro \u2014 stuck with this promise, despite its high price. Thankfully, the two most recent HONOR flagships \u2014 the Magic 5 Pro and Magic 6 Pro \u2014 upped the ante to three upgrades and five years of patches.\nNotably, the company has promised seven years of Android upgrades and security patches starting with the Magic 7 Pro. Hopefully, all future phones from HONOR will see the same update commitment. Time will tell.\nHUAWEI\n- HUAWEI has no firm commitment to the rollout of upgrades and patches to its recent phones. Instead, it takes things on a case-by-case basis.\nDue to the HUAWEI ban, HUAWEI uses two different operating systems on its phones. Harmony OS (which is an Android fork) appears on phones in its native China. Meanwhile, regular Android (with its EMUI skin) appears on global devices. We\u2019ll be focused on the Android versions of HUAWEI\u2019s catalog here.\nRegardless of the operating system onboard, HUAWEI is unable to use Google services on its devices and doesn\u2019t seem to have access to the most recent versions of Android either.\nHUAWEI's smartphone business is in a shambles, making updates unreliable.\nCase in point, 2022\u2019s HUAWEI Mate 50 Pro flagship still has no schedule for getting Android 13, although HUAWEI does commit to two Android upgrades coming at some point. The Pura 70 Ultra from 2024 launched with Android 12, though, so it might just be that anything beyond that version isn\u2019t coming.\nMaking matters worse, HUAWEI can\u2019t even commit to a concrete promise of how long it will update its phones. In the case of the P50 Pro from 2022, it told us this: \u201cUpdates will be provided and maintained regularly throughout the full lifecycle of the product.\u201d That could mean anything, really.\nLikewise, the company also told us this at one point in an email:\nPrivacy protection and security have always been HUAWEI\u2019s top priority, and HUAWEI has been innovating to protect users\u2019 privacy and security. We rigorously adhere to foundational principles for data privacy during the entire product design and development process. We continuously provide security updates to our users, when necessary, and will continue to offer them timely technical support.\nOnce again, that could mean anything.\nThe bottom line here is that if phone updates are important to you, you should beware of HUAWEI devices.\nMotorola\n- Motorola flagships generally receive two software upgrades and two (or sometimes three) years of patches. The company\u2019s budget phones usually see just one upgrade and two years of patches. Currently, only one phone offers five years of coverage.\nMotorola has a problematic past when it comes to phone updates. When it launched the premium Motorola Edge series in 2020, for example, it promised just one Android upgrade and two years of patches. After public outcry (including from Android Authority), it amended its promise to two upgrades and two years of patches.\nIncredibly, the same thing happened again the following year with the Edge 20 series. The end result was the same: two years of upgrades and patches.\nIn 2022, it finally learned its lesson. It publicly promised to deliver two upgrades and three years of bi-monthly patches to the Motorola Edge 30 series. In 2023, it upped the ante again, offering three upgrades and four years of patches for the Motorola Edge Plus (2023).\nIn 2024, it finally offered five upgrades and five years of patches with the Motorola Edge 50 Neo, a mid-range phone available in Europe and India. As of 2025, the ThinkPhone 25 and Moto G75 have since been placed on that list, too.\nHowever, Motorola stops short of offering good commitments like that to all its phones. Motorola\u2019s budget phones often see the original promise of one upgrade and two years of patches. Thankfully, Motorola makes it easy for users to know what they should expect with updates using a web-based tool. If you\u2019re a Motorola phone owner (or thinking of becoming one), a quick visit to that web page would be a good idea.\nNothing\n- Most Nothing-branded phone has an update commitment of three upgrades and four years of patches. However, the Phone 3a series will receive six years of security patches with three upgrades.\nNothing is the youngest smartphone brand on this list, but its update commitment already matches many players. So far, the three Nothing phones we\u2019ve seen \u2014 Phone 1, Phone 2, and Phone 2a \u2014 have the same update commitment, which is three Android upgrades and four years of patches.\nCurrently, the Nothing Phone 3a series is the only device line in the company\u2019s umbrella that\u2019ll receive six years of patches and three Android upgrades.\nNothing\u2019s speed with these updates has been pretty good. All Nothing phones are already on Android 14 and there some have already received Android 15, suggesting a timely rollout of Google\u2019s latest OS version.\nAs time goes on, Nothing could extend these commitments, considering Google and Samsung have extended theirs. However, Nothing\u2019s relative size could prevent it from offering too much of a commitment, so time will tell there.\nOnePlus\n- The OnePlus 13 gets four upgrades and six years of patches. Older flagships receive up to four upgrades and up to five years of patches. Mid-rangers in the Nord series get two upgrades and three years of patches. Budget Nord N models get one upgrade and two years of patches.\nOnePlus breaks down its support criteria based on the class of device at hand. The differences are notable. In brief, the more money you spend, the more support you\u2019ll receive.\nFor example, the OnePlus 13 line will receive four upgrades and six years of security patches while the OnePlus 11, OnePlus 12, and OnePlus Open will all see four upgrades and five years of patches. Meanwhile, the OnePlus 10 Pro, OnePlus 9 series, etc., will receive three years of upgrades and a fourth year of security updates.\nHowever, when you step down to the mid-range Nord series, you\u2019ll see two years of Android updates and a third year of security updates. Finally, when you step down again to the budget-tier Nord N series \u2014 including devices like the Nord N30 and Nord N300 \u2014 you\u2019ll only get one upgrade and two years of security patches.\nUnfortunately, OnePlus\u2019 reliability in disseminating those updates has been up and down over the years. The company has become well-known for launching half-baked Android upgrades with sometimes devastating bugs. It also isn\u2019t incredibly consistent with the rollouts of its patches. Still, as long as you stick to flagship-tier products from the brand, you should be happy.\nOPPO\n- The Find X8 will receive five years of upgrades and six years of security patches. Most other OPPO flagships from 2023 and forward will receive four upgrades and five years of patches. Pre-2023 flagships will receive three upgrades and four years of patches. Mid-rangers get two upgrades and four years of patches. Budget models get one upgrade and three years of patches. Select ultra-budget models will see no upgrades.\nOPPO and OnePlus are essentially the same company, with both organizations using the same staff, the same R&D, and even the same code base for their respective Android skins. As such, it should be unsurprising to hear that OPPO\u2019s promises for phone updates are similar to those of OnePlus: the more you spend, the more you get.\nAt the top end, OPPO\u2019s flagships in its Find series launched in 2025 and beyond will receive five years of upgrades and six years of security patches, with older models receiving four upgrades and five years of patches. Meanwhile, older flagships \u2014 including the Find X5 series \u2014 will see three upgrades and four years of security patches.\nUnlike its slabby siblings, the foldable OPPO Find N5 will receive four years of upgrades and six years of security patches.\nThe mid-range OPPO F, K, Reno, and Find Lite/Neo series will see two upgrades and four years of patches. Finally, some of the budget OPPO A series phones will see one Android upgrade and three years of patches. Note that we say \u201csome\u201d there, meaning there could be OPPO A phones with zero upgrades.\nWhile OPPO\u2019s commitments to its budget phones are quite sad, it is nice to see the company lay it all out in public. At least with OPPO, you know what you\u2019re going to get.\nPOCO\n- POCO generally offers no firm commitment to upgrades and patches, instead issuing information on a phone-by-phone basis. Most of its phones see two years of overall support, including two upgrades. However, more recent models are offering a little more. The F7 Ultra, for instance, promises four years of upgrades and six years of security patches.\nPOCO has improved its update policy in recent years, but only for a handful of its devices. The F7 Ultra, for instance, will receive four years of upgrades and six years of security patches, meeting many other companies in this particular boat.\nHowever, good luck finding details for any of its older devices. When asked, offered only a brief statement about its plans to support its smartphones over time. \u201cCurrently, the Android updates and security patches cycles of our devices are in accordance with our agreements with Google and comply with corresponding policies.\u201d\nWhat does this mean? Essentially, POCO is passing the buck. Google has no set rule on how long manufacturers must issue phone updates, nor how regularly they should come. Google\u2019s suggested schedule is a minimum of two years, but the company hasn\u2019t done anything to enforce this.\nPOCO has historically given wishy-washy answers to our requests for formal commitments to software support.\nIn other words, POCO does not make any overall promises for its phones. To its credit, it has historically delivered two upgrades to most of its devices. It might take longer than we would like, but it does happen.\nDuring our review of the POCO F5 Pro, the company committed to two years of upgrades and three years of patches. The Poco X6 series, launched in January 2024, offers three upgrades and four years of patches. So the company is getting better slowly but surely.\nThe bottom line here is that you should approach any POCO purchases under the assumption that your device will get the bare minimum of software support.\nrealme\n- realme phones usually come with two upgrades and three years of patches, although newer phones are seeing better promises.\nIn 2022 and earlier, realme stuck to its original promise when it comes to phone updates. Despite its sister brands OPPO and OnePlus upping the ante for flagship phones, realme stuck with the suggested minimum:\n\u201cI think we are still sticking to\u2026two years of [upgrades] and the regular security patch updates for three years,\u201d realme CEO Madhav Sheth told us in an interview.\nHowever, realme is making changes. In March 2022, the company announced that the realme GT 2 and realme GT 2 Pro would see three upgrades and four years of patches. Unfortunately, the company didn\u2019t explicitly state if this was its new universal policy going forward or just a special consideration for these phones. Until we hear differently, assume a realme phone comes with just two upgrades.\nAs of 2025, the GT7 Pro offers four years of upgrades, so the company is slowly improving its policy outlook.\nRedmi\n- Most Redmi phones get one or two upgrades, but the company\u2019s newest phones are seeing increases to that commitment.\nXiaomi sub-brand Redmi makes a whole lot of mid-range and budget phones. As with realme, it should be unsurprising to learn that a company known for very cheap devices doesn\u2019t put too much credence into keeping those phones updated.\nIn the past, it has committed to providing monthly and/or quarterly security updates to a wide range of Redmi-branded phones. The list includes most of the Redmi 7, 8, and 9 families. Unfortunately, the company has made no specific commitments to upgrades and usually supplies two or even just one before shelving the device.\nHowever, in 2022, the company did start being better. Some of its devices saw commitments rise to two or even three years of upgrades. There isn\u2019t much rhyme or reason to which phones do or don\u2019t get this promise, though. With 2024\u2019s launch of the Redmi Note 13 Pro Plus, the company is committing to three upgrades and four years of patches for this particular model.\nOne should go into buying a Redmi phone with the knowledge that it is very unlikely you\u2019ll see more than two upgrades during its lifespan.\nSamsung\n- The majority of recent Samsung phones will see four upgrades and five years of patches. Some older phones will see three upgrades and three years of patches. Phones in the Galaxy S24 series are due for seven years of both upgrades and patches. The Galaxy A56 5G, A36 5G, A26 5G, and A16 5G will receive six upgrades and six years of security patches.\nFor years now, Samsung has been the top dog when it comes to global smartphone sales, so naturally, it\u2019s also one of the OEMs with the best support promise for its flagships and mid-range phones. It was briefly knocked off its throne by Google with the Pixel 8 series, but if you\u2019re buying a Galaxy S24, Samsung is promising to match Google\u2019s seven-year commitment. We\u2019re expecting that to apply to other models in the future, and it has already with the Galaxy Z Fold 6 and the Galaxy Z Flip 6.\nNotably, Samsung also announced the Galaxy A16 5G, which surprisingly offers six years of Android upgrades and security patches. It has since been joined by the And, starting with the Galaxy A56 5G, A36 5G, and A26 5G.\nOnly Google's Pixel 8 series features a better update promise than most Samsung phones.\nOutside of the Galaxy S24 series, Samsung otherwise trumps every OEM except Google, with four years of upgrades and five years of security patches for all its previous phones. That means a Galaxy S23 \u2014 which first shipped with Android 13 \u2014 will see Android 15, Android 16, and even Android 17.\nAs mentioned, Samsung doesn\u2019t lock its promise to premium flagships. The mid-range Galaxy A54 5G gets the same commitment, for example.\nSome phones get a less extensive promise of three years of upgrades and patches. However, when you consider that that\u2019s a better promise than most companies make for even their premium flagships, you start to see just how good Samsung is at this.\nFor a full rundown of all Samsung devices and how long they\u2019ll see updates, consult our guide.\nSony\n- The majority of Sony phones come with two upgrades and two years of patches. Newer flagships, though, do come with better policies.\nIn the world of Android, Sony makes some of the most expensive non-foldable phones. One would think that with the phones costing so much money, Sony\u2019s promises for phone updates would be quite extensive. However, one would be wrong to think that.\nThe Sony Xperia 1 V \u2014 one of its recent flagships \u2014 has no stated update commitment. Before that, the Xperia 1 IV saw two years of upgrades and three years of patches. Going back to even older flagships, the commitment gets worse and weaker. Thankfully, Sony addressed the rot, giving the Xperia VI three upgrades and four years of security patches. That pales in comparison to many, many mid-range phones from the likes of Samsung and Google, but it\u2019s a step in the right direction.\nRemember that these phones start at a price of at least $1,300. Also, Sony\u2019s phone roster is incredibly small. It\u2019s bizarre that the company can\u2019t even match Samsung\u2019s commitments to its older and budget-level phones.\nHopefully, Sony will eventually up its game here. Until then, buyers who appreciate fast and long-lasting updates should steer clear.\nTCL\n- TCL changes its commitments depending on the phone\u2019s price. However, you shouldn\u2019t expect anything more than two years of support, with some devices only seeing one upgrade in that time.\nTCL says its software update policies typically depend on each individual device. \u201cThere are numerous factors that need to be considered for each device, such as carrier requirements, certifications, chipset software support, and regional needs,\u201d said TCL via email.\nThis open-ended policy makes for a wid variety of commitments. For example, the TCL 40 XE 5G from 2023 has a two-year commitment for patches but no commitment for upgrades, meaning it will never get beyond Android 13. Other devices get one upgrade commitment, with only a select few getting two.\nIn other words, you shouldn\u2019t expect more than two upgrades for a TCL phone. That applies even if you buy one of its most expensive devices. Meanwhile, if you get something more budget-oriented, you should expect just one upgrade \u2014 if that.\nvivo\n- vivo has no firm software support commitment for the majority of its phones. The only exception is the latest vivo X series, but even then, there are a whole lot of caveats.\nIn 2021, vivo made a decent commitment to its newer flagship phones, saying it would deliver three years of upgrades and patches for \u201cselect models\u201d in the vivo X series. We see this commitment still to this day, with the X80 Pro getting a formal commitment to that effect. However, that only applies to devices launched after July 2021 and only applies to select markets.\nDevices that don\u2019t fall under this policy will \u201ccontinue to receive regular Android security updates\u201d for an unknown period of time. Unfortunately, vivo has not yet amended this policy, despite detailed promises from sister brands OPPO and OnePlus.\nNotably, vivo has committed to three upgrades and four years of patches with its X100 Pro, and has bettered this with the X200 Pro. The new phone will see four upgrades and five years of security patches.\nThankfully, vivo does offer a tool that allows you to see what to expect as far as phone updates for any particular model.\nXiaomi\n- Xiaomi has a stated policy of two years of security patches for its phones. However, it has no stated policy for upgrades. It does make exceptions for its premium phones, with older flagships seeing three upgrades and four years of patches. The Xiaomi 15, however, will receive four years of OS updates and six years of patches.\nXiaomi\u2019s stated minimum for phone updates across all its lines is as follows: \u201cWe release monthly and quarterly security patch updates on Xiaomi devices for at least two years after product listing in the marketplace. Monthly and quarterly security updates will include Android security patches released by Google, as well as patches for Xiaomi-specific issues.\u201d\nUnfortunately, that doesn\u2019t bring any clarity to Xiaomi\u2019s policy toward upgrades. As with some other vendors on this list, Xiaomi approaches each line on its own to determine its commitment. For example, the company does promise three upgrades and four years of security patches for its flagship Xiaomi 13 lines. The Xiaomi 14 gets a year extra on both OS upgrades and security patches. The Xiaomi 15 kicks this up to four upgrades and six years of security patches. Phones outside of these lines, however, won\u2019t see that extensive of a commitment \u2014 if the company issues a commitment at all.\nZTE\n- Most ZTE phones will see one Android upgrade and the company makes no commitment towards patches.\nA relatively small player on the global stage, ZTE is very vague about its update plans. \u201cZTE has plans to provide major system updates (one update) on flagship products, but the update time depends on the release time of Google\u2019s commercial version,\u201d said the company via email. This doesn\u2019t make us feel too confident about the longevity of its phones.\nIn the case of the ZTE Axon 40 Ultra from 2022, the company didn\u2019t even make a commitment at all, refusing to comment on the matter.\nIn other words, ZTE might be the weakest company on this list when it comes to software support.\nPhone updates: A summary of the industry\nIf you read through this whole list, you\u2019ll notice that only a handful of companies take software updates seriously. Samsung is the leader when it comes to issuing phone updates for a significant period of time on a consistent and frequent basis. Meanwhile, Google sits in a comfortable second place slot. These two companies are neck-and-neck, though.\nOther than those two companies, however, it\u2019s a mixed bag. OnePlus, OPPO, and Xiaomi offer very good update policies, but only for their premium flagships. Motorola is showing a positive trend, even if many of its devices still fall short of its rivals. Mid-rangers and budget models see much weaker promises. Even huge brands like Sony, ASUS, realme, vivo, and TCL can\u2019t meet the bar set by Samsung\u2019s budget lines.\nDoes a company's track record with software updates influence your purchasing decision with new phones?\nThen you have companies like ZTE. More often than not, they simply refuse to make any promises at all. Looking from the top down, you can really see how the Android phone industry is incredibly fragmented when it comes to a standard policy of updates.\nOne thing we haven\u2019t mentioned yet is how Apple treats phone updates. Apple actually trumps most Android brands by offering six years (or more) of upgrades for iPhones. We\u2019d definitely like to see this as a standard across the Android world, too.\nThis would be a universally good thing. It would allow Android users to have the same level of after-purchase support as iOS users, for one. It would also set an example for other Android OEMs and, hopefully, push the idea that weak update commitments are simply not acceptable anymore.\nPhone updates are important and should be treated as such. Someday, we hope this whole list is filled with robust promises from all companies.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."

Learn more.\nWaterproof tech: Everything you need to know about IP and ATM ratings\nMarch 7, 2025\nWaterproof tech has become a big trend in recent years. But how do you know how protected your device is? Most devices use either an IP or ATM ratings. Let\u2019s start by talking about what an IP rating is. Most high-end smartphones these days have an IP68 rating. These include the Samsung Galaxy S25 series, Apple iPhone 16 series, and Google Pixel 9 series. Some can even go up to IP69, but that is rare. What does all of this even mean, though? Let\u2019s dig into it.\nWhat is an IP rating?\nYou probably know that IP ratings have something to do with protection from water and dust, but if you are reading this, that may be as far as your understanding goes.\nAn IP rating tells you the level of protection a device offers against solids and liquids. The International Electrotechnical Commission sets these standards. The \u201cIP\u201d stands for Ingress Protection (or International Protection) and is followed by two numbers. The first number indicates the level of protection against solid particles (dust, dirt, etc.) and ranges from one to six. The second number tells you how much water a device can handle without suffering damage, and it goes from one to nine \u2014 the higher the number, the better the protection against liquids. Check out the chart below for detailed info on what each number means:\n| Level | Solids (first number) | Liquids (second number) |\n|---|---|---|\n| Level 1 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 50mm (example: hands). | Liquids (second number) Protected against vertically falling drops of water. |\n| Level 2 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 12mm (example: fingers). | Liquids (second number) Protected against direct sprays of water up to 15 degrees from the vertical. |\n| Level 3 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 2.5mm (example: tools and wires). | Liquids (second number) Protected against direct sprays of water up to 60 degrees from the vertical. |\n| Level 4 | Solids (first number) Protected against solid objects over 1mm (example: small wires). | Liquids (second number) Protected against water sprayed from all directions. |\n| Level 5 | Solids (first number) Dust protected \u2014 limited ingress of dust permitted. | Liquids (second number) Protected against jets of water from all directions. |\n| Level 6 | Solids (first number) Dust-tight \u2014 no ingress of dust permitted. | Liquids (second number) Protected against powerful jets of water from all directions. |\n| Level 7 | Solids (first number) / | Liquids (second number) Protected against the effects of immersion in water \u2014 between 15 cm (5.9 inches) and 1 meter (3.3 feet) for up to 30 minutes. |\n| Level 8 | Solids (first number) / | Liquids (second number) Protected against the effects of long periods of immersion in water under pressure. Usually 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) of immersion for up to 30 minutes. |\n| Level 9 | Solids (first number) / | Liquids (second number) Protected against high pressure and temperature water jets. The device needs to survive 30 seconds of 14-16 liters directed at the phone from multiple angles, at an 80-degree Celsius temperature. |\nAs you can tell by the chart above, a handset with an IP67 rating is entirely dust-tight and will survive in up to one meter of water (3.3 feet) for up to 30 minutes. An IP68-rated device is also completely dust-tight. It is protected against the effects of long periods of immersion in water, which usually means it will survive in up to 1.5 meters (4.9 feet) of water for 30 minutes. If a phone is IP69 rated, it means it can also handle really hot water under high pressure.\nIP69 ratings are still a bit rare in smartphones, but the list is growing. Some popular phones with an IP69 rating include the OnePlus 13, HONOR Magic 7 Pro, OPPO Find N5, and the Moto G Power 2025.\nYou\u2019ve probably also heard of an IP69K rating. This one isn\u2019t relevant to smartphones. IP69K ratings are provided to equipment made for road vehicles. It ensures that the rated product can withstand severe washes using pressure washers.\nWater-resistant, but not waterproof\nEven if a smartphone has a high IP rating, it may not be completely waterproof. You can drop a phone with an IP68 rating in a freshwater pond, or a tub, and it should be fine. However, if that phone is dipped in a chlorinated pool, or in the ocean, which has saltwater, that could cause problems.\nManufacturers are always quick to tell you water resistance is not a permanent state. The rubber seals and gaskets that usually protect a high IP-rated phone from water damage could be weakened over time. This could decrease the device\u2019s overall water resistance over time. Those same seals can erode if a smartphone encounters coffee, soft drinks, or champagne spills.\nRemember that a phone\u2019s IP rating is based on closed lab conditions, not real-world situations. In other words, try to keep your phone dry, even if it might have a high IP rating.\nAdditionally, a phone that has been damaged is likely no longer waterproof. Water can leak into the device through cracks.\nATM Rating\nThere\u2019s another rating to consider for devices, especially for smartwatches; the ATM (Atmospheres) rating system indicates how much static atmospheric pressure a device can deal with while in water. It\u2019s actually an older rating system than the IP certification. A rating of 1 ATM means that you are at sea level, outside of water. If a device has a 1 ATM level listed, don\u2019t put it in water under any circumstances.\nThe system is actually much simpler to understand. Each ATM number represents about 10 meters of depth. So, if you have a device with an ATM 3 rating, you should be able to submerge it as deep as 30 meters. An ATM 10 rating increases the depth to 100 meters, and so on. These are usually used in smartwatches and other more specialized tech.\nHere\u2019s a look at the ATM rating system.\n| Rating | Pressure | Device Meaning |\n|---|---|---|\n| Rating 1 ATM | Pressure 0. | Device Meaning Do not put in water. |\n| Rating 3 ATM | Pressure Under 100 feet. | Device Meaning Device can be used in the rain, and protected against splashes. |\n| Rating 5 ATM | Pressure Under 165 feet. | Device Meaning Device can last for short amounts of time submerged in water, like swimming in a pool. |\n| Rating 10 ATM | Pressure Under 330 feet. | Device Meaning Device can last for much longer amounts of time submerged in water, such as for snorkeling in the ocean. |\n| Rating 20 ATM | Pressure Under 660 feet. | Device Meaning Device can handle being used for high impact water sports like surfing and jet skiing. |\nMilitary ready standards\nYou may be wondering if there are any tougher handsets out there. Military certifications guarantee \u201ccombat-ready\u201d smartphones that can handle all kinds of damage. MIL-STD-810G-certified smartphones go through a series of 29 tests. These include exposure to shock, vibration, heat, cold, gunfire shock, humidity, and more. You can learn more about these in the link below. There\u2019s also the improved MIL-STD-810H now, which goes through 30 tests.\nThese MIL-STD ratings are usually reserved for rugged devices. Here\u2019s our list of the best rugged phones, if you want to take a look at some options.\nLooking after your devices\nAn IP or ATM rating gives you peace of mind if you pick up your device with wet hands, accidentally drop it in the pool, or use it in the rain. Without it, there is no reassurance a device will survive some liquid exposure.\nHowever, that does not mean your smartphone is invincible. Here are some quick tips to ensure you will get the most out of your smartphone:\n- If you decide to take your phone in the water, make sure to cover all the ports. Those may include SIM and microSD card slots. Your USB power port may also have a cover.\n- If you take your phone into a chlorinated pool, wash it off with fresh water when you take it out. Don\u2019t use soap or chemicals.\n- Your phone should stay away from saltwater, like the water found in the ocean.\n- Avoid using your phone in extreme locations, including places with high heat, like a sauna, or rough environments.\n- If your phone goes into the water, dry it off thoroughly before plugging other accessories into their ports. That includes your USB phone charger or wired headphones if the phone has a headphone jack. Also, don\u2019t use a hairdryer to dry off your phone; use a dry cloth.\n- Remove any hair or other small objects that you might see inside your phone\u2019s covers and ports. Even small amounts of dirt could damage your microSD card slot, USB power ports, or headphone jack.\n- One last recommendation we can give you is to always have smartphone insurance. You never know when something can go wrong. Also, read your insurance\u2019s terms, as some might not cover water damage, especially when caused by willful actions.\nConsider getting a waterproof pouch\nIf you must take your phone underwater, we recommend investing in a second layer of protection. Waterproof pouches are a great way to keep your expensive electronics safe when submerged in liquids. Here\u2019s a really good one from CaliCase.\nFAQs\nIP ratings are standards that measure how much a product can withstand solids and liquids. It stands for Ingress Protection, and two numbers follow it. The first measures how much the unit can handle solids, while the second number measures liquid resistance.\nThe best smartphones usually come with an IP68 rating. This makes them dust-tight and protected against immersion up to 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes. Some rugged devices take it a step further and also get IP69 certification, which means they can withstand pressured hot water.\nSmartphones don\u2019t usually come with ATM ratings. These ratings are reserved for watches and other products you might take to deeper depths.\nThe most resistant rugged devices come with a MIL-STD rating. Usually MIL-STD-810H, but some devices still have the older MIL-STD-810G rating. These devices go through a wide variety of tests, and can generally handle more damage, such as shock, high pressures, extreme temperatures, and more.\nSome phones don\u2019t have excellent IP ratings. This means it might be unsafe to get them in contact with water. That said, you can always get a waterproof phone pouch and add a layer of protection to any device.\nSay the worst has already happened, and you\u2019ve already water-damaged your smartphone. We have a guide for fixing water-damaged phones. Just keep in mind none of these methods are guaranteed to work. You might need a new phone.

Learn more.\nI test all the best Android phones every year, and these are the ones you should buy in 2025\nAugust 20, 2025\nIt\u2019s a funny thing, this idea of calling something the best. After all, everyone wants to think that their favorite of anything is the best \u2014 the best album, book, or cup of coffee \u2014 but that can\u2019t always be true. And, when you apply the idea of being the best to a category as wide open as Android phones, which can come in different shapes, sizes, and prices, the task becomes even greater.\nHowever, I think I have a pretty good idea of what makes an Android phone great. I test and review dozens of them every year, and I\u2019ve spent time with just about every phone you can get your hands on in the US (and even some that you can only buy elsewhere). And, across my many Android-fueled adventures, I\u2019ve learned to pick the qualities that make a phone worth buying. So, with that in mind, here\u2019s what I think are the best Android phones you can buy in 2025.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL: The best Android phone overall\n- Excellent build quality, refined design\n- Stunning display\n- Extensive update policy\n- Sharp, powerful cameras\n- Improved wired charging\n- Clever Gemini features\n- Tensor still runs warm\n- Confusing charging situation\n- Only 128GB base storage\nI remember when Google\u2019s Pixel phones felt like niche picks for the most dedicated Android fans. They paired clean, simple software with brilliant cameras and added a dash of fun Google design to the mix, and I always felt clever spotting one out in the wild. These days, the Pixel 9 Pro XL hangs its hat on many of the same features as its predecessors, but it\u2019s no longer a pick for those in the know \u2014 it\u2019s just the best Android phone that money can buy.\nI\u2019ve spent perhaps more time with the Pixel 9 Pro XL (and its smaller Pixel 9 Pro sibling) than anyone else at Android Authority, and it continues to find new ways to impress. Its updated design with smooth, shiny side rails and a camera bar that\u2019s become more of an island feels a little bit Apple-inspired, but in a way that makes me think the student has become the master. Granted, I\u2019ve always been a fan of Google\u2019s camera bar design, but it now feels polished and premium in a way that can stand with any other phone on the market.\nAnd, since we\u2019re already on the topic of the camera bar, let\u2019s dig into Google\u2019s impressive hardware a little further. The Pixel 9 Pro XL packs a 50MP primary sensor that\u2019s simply excellent, capturing plenty of detail and processing images with a very natural color profile thanks to the Tensor G4 chipset. Google\u2019s ultrawide and 5x optical telephoto sensor help to round out the setup with up to 30x zoom, while tricks like a revamped panorama mode and Add Me helped to earn the phone the title of best Android camera phone, too.\nWith an updated design, improved Tensor G4 chipset, and tons of AI features, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is Google's most complete phone to date.\nUpdates under the hood have helped to keep Google\u2019s top-end flagship at the front of my mind since it launched last fall. Its 16GB of RAM (with 4GB reserved for Gemini) and up to 1TB of storage space feel like clever future-proofing methods that will keep the Pixel 9 Pro XL near the top of the list as Google rolls out new AI-powered features like updates to the Pixel Studio, better support for Pixel Screenshots, and new capabilities for Gemini Live over the course of seven years of updates.\nEven the Pixel 9 Pro XL\u2019s battery and charging setup have taken a step forward, thanks in no small part to the combination of the more efficient Tensor G4 chipset and upgraded 37W wired speeds. I don\u2019t even mind that I needed to pick up Google\u2019s new USB-C Pixel charger, as I\u2019m still achieving close to two days of battery life between charges. And, with a starting price of $1,099 (or $999 for the Pixel 9 Pro), Google\u2019s best Pixel to date is a little more approachable than rivals from Samsung and Apple.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: The best ultra-tier Android phone\n- Premium materials\n- Great battery life\n- Solid cameras\n- Top-tier Snapdragon performance\n- Brilliant display\n- Excellent software policy\n- Downgraded S Pen\n- Mostly AI-based upgrades\n- Still no full Qi2 support\n- Can be uncomfortable to hold\n- Very expensive\nAs a Pixel fan, it\u2019s easy for me to hype up the Pixel 9 Pro XL as the best Android phone, but for many Samsung diehards, it\u2019s Galaxy or nothing. And, with the amount of power packed into the Galaxy S25 Ultra, I can see where they\u2019re coming from. If there\u2019s a spec you\u2019re looking for \u2014 solid charging, flexible cameras, ample RAM and storage \u2014 I\u2019d be willing to bet that Samsung\u2019s top-end option checks that box, which is why we\u2019re calling it the best ultra-tier Android phone.\nFrom the minute you take it out of the box, the Galaxy S25 Ultra feels like a tool that\u2019s ready to work. Its massive titanium frame protects panels of Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on both the front and back, and it continues to house the S Pen that\u2019s boosted productivity users since the days of the Galaxy Note lineup. Yes, Samsung simplified its built-in stylus a bit this year and took away a few features, but it remains the easiest way to take notes and doodle your way into Sketch to Image on the gorgeous 6.9-inch AMOLED panel.\nTo me, though, the Galaxy 25 Ultra stands out because of its four rear cameras. Like the previous generation, the start of the show is a huge 200MP sensor that covers much of the short-range zoom until the dual 3x and 5x optical telephoto sensors take over to push to 100x Space Zoom with a bit of help from some Galaxy AI processing. I prefer the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s shots up to about the 10x zoom length, as there\u2019s barely any drop in quality, and the built-in camera filters make it easier to put some personality into your images right off the bat.\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra remains a productivity powerhouse with four rear cameras and a built-in S Pen.\nThe rest of Samsung\u2019s internals keep the Galaxy S25 Ultra well-positioned for the future, even if they come at a cost. Yes, this ultra-tier flagship starts at $1,299 \u2014 more than any of our other primary picks \u2014 but that\u2019s what you pay for an \u201cUltra\u201d phone, and for your money, you get an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, 12GB of RAM across most configurations, frequently updated Galaxy AI features, and the fastest charging that you\u2019ll currently find on a Samsug phone at 45W. But, with seven years of updates, you can stretch your time with the Galaxy S25 Ultra further than most of its rivals.\nGoogle Pixel 9a: The best Android phone under $500\n- Solid, reliable cameras\n- Excellent update commitment\n- Clever AI-powered features\n- Great battery life\n- New, streamlined design\n- Excellent price\n- Relatively slow charging\n- Aging Gorilla Glass 3 (again)\n- Missing Pixel Screenshots\nAlthough I love spending time with the biggest, most expensive flagship Android phones, I think I\u2019m ready to tell you a little secret: They\u2019re not my favorites. Instead, I think the mid-range is the best section of the Android market right now \u2014 the phones that pick up a few flagship-level features without the painful price tag. There\u2019s no better example than the slimmed-down, sped-up Pixel 9a.\nIn almost every way, the Pixel 9a is just the type of addition the larger Pixel 9 series needed. It carries over most of the great AI-powered features I mentioned falling in love with on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, like access to the Pixel Studio, using Gemini to multitask across apps, and receiving the same regular Pixel Drops as its flagship siblings. It\u2019s a bummer to see Pixel Screenshots wind up on the cutting room floor, but I\u2019ve always found screenshot management in Photos good enough that I don\u2019t mind too much.\nI love the Pixel 9a's slimmed-down design and flagship-tier features at the $500 price point.\nPerhaps the one thing that initially surprised me about the Pixel 9a was its updated design. I\u2019d seen leaks and rumors that the camera bar was going away, and I didn\u2019t want to believe it. However, since spending time with Google\u2019s most affordable model, I\u2019ve come around to the benefit of simplicity. Google didn\u2019t just axe its iconic camera bar for fun, but instead found ways to slim the internal components to free up the space to embed its cameras deeper into the body. The result is a phone that doesn\u2019t collect dust around its cameras, but still manages to have the same Google-y personality I love about Pixels.\nAlong with that refreshed design, Google gave its mid-ranger several other updates to make the $500 price tag feel like even more of a bargain. It carries the same Tensor G4 chipset as its flagship siblings, and has swapped to a wider 48MP primary camera that lets in more light for Google\u2019s brilliant image processing to play with, and it\u2019s all topped off with the largest battery on any Pixel at 5,100mAh. I called it the best $500 phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I\u2019ll stand by that until the Pixel 10a comes around.\nCMF Phone 2 Pro: The best Android phone under $300\n- Incredibly low price\n- Amazing design and display\n- Cool modular features\n- Primary, ultrawide, and telephoto lenses\n- Good update commitment\n- Not good for a US-based buyer\n- Controversial Essential Key\nMoving down another step, it\u2019s remarkable to see how far the budget Android segment has come in just a few years. I remember bashing cheap options for their lame cameras, underwhelming charging, and bland designs, and now the CMF Phone 2 Pro feels like a breath of fresh air by comparison. It\u2019s the personality-packed follow-up to one of the most interesting phones of 2024, the CMF Phone 1, and it improves on almost every aspect of the modular design without jumping the price too much.\nOf course, I should point out that it still doesn\u2019t work well in the US. Yes, you\u2019ll get some band support, but it won\u2019t completely cover any of the big three networks. That said, if you live in a supported market, or can live with some signal inconsistency, there is absolutely no better phone under $300.\nThe modular design is the most fun I\u2019ve had with a phone since Samsung brought back the flip phone with its Galaxy Z Flip lineup. The design still works the same as it did on the first CMF Phone, having you release the back panel with a series of screws before attaching different accessories like a lanyard, card holder, or a kickstand.\nCMF's Phone 2 Pro builds on a quirky, modular design in a way that's still fun to switch up every day.\nI think the coolest accessory that the team at CMF has cooked up is one that\u2019s out for Moment\u2019s lunch. The Phone 2 Pro supports new external camera lenses, which you can screw on and off the updated 50MP sensors to give them macro and fisheye functionality. It\u2019s perhaps a slightly old-fashioned take on what\u2019s usually done with software or a dedicated sensor, but I like that it means you don\u2019t have to worry about macro mode turning on and off as it senses you nearing a subject. Oh, and have I mentioned that you can give this quirky pick a try for less than $300?\nAt that price, we usually expect some pretty significant cuts to budget phones, but I think the Phone 2 Pro has managed to avoid most of the pitfalls. Its Dimensity 7300 Pro is up for most tasks, and adding the Essential Key allows the budget pick to tap into the same convenient AI journal that Nothing introduced on its recent Phone 3a duo. The upgraded IP54 rating (up from IP52) is also a nice touch, but it falls slightly behind the IP68 protection that Samsung and Motorola have started adding to their affordable options.\nSamsung Galaxy A16 5G: The best Android phone under $200\n- Stellar software update promise\n- Solid primary camera\n- Decent battery life\n- Great price\n- Good charging\n- Just-okay build quality\n- Aging performance\n- Weak peripheral cameras\n- Bland design\nThe last of our budget picks, the Galaxy A16 5G, somehow manages to dance within one of the tightest categories of Android phones. When launching for less than $200, you have to make some serious concessions on the spec sheet, yet this cheap Android option manages to check off quite a few boxes with a decent IP54 rating (matching the CMF Phone 2 Pro above), an AMOLED panel with a 90Hz refresh rate, and an in-house Exynos 1330 processor in the US. It also looks the part of a more expensive Galaxy device, pulling heavily from Samsung\u2019s streamlined flagship style.\nI spent a fair portion of my winter with the Galaxy A16 5G in my pocket, and I came away impressed more often than not. Yes, I have to put it into the context that this is merely a $200 Android phone, but sometimes good enough is all you need. Its display is bright enough in most conditions, its primary camera is flexible enough to cover day-to-day shooting in decent lighting, and its battery life is pretty solid because of the power-sipping processor. However, one thing truly adds a mountain of value to a phone that costs little more than a mole hill.\nSamsung's Galaxy A16 5G is a fine value pick boosted by an incredible update commitment.\nYes, it\u2019s Samsung\u2019s downright remarkable commitment to software updates. Despite costing about the same as a premium pair of running shoes, the Galaxy A16 5G is on tap for six years of updates across major Android patches and regular security coverage. That puts this budget option at more updates than either the OnePlus 13 or Motorola Razr Ultra can match, despite both flagships costing at least four times more.\nUltimately, that mix of value and long-term support makes the Galaxy A16 5G great for a few particular groups of people, like kids or grandparents. It makes sense for the former as you won\u2019t have to worry too much about the phone picking up scuffs or scrapes since it doesn\u2019t cost too much to repair or replace, while it makes sense for the latter as One UI probably won\u2019t change too much over the course of its many updates, making it easy for you to lend a hand as the go-to tech support person in your family.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro: The best Android camera phone\n- Impressive Gemini-powered features\n- Excellent build quality\n- Gorgeous display\n- Flexible, capable cameras\n- Reliable update commitment\n- Tensor G4 still runs hot\n- Charges slower than 9 Pro XL\n- Limited base storage\nA lazier guide would tell you to scroll back up to the Pixel 9 Pro XL \u2014 our pick for the best overall Android phone \u2014 skim that entry, and then come back here to understand why the Pixel 9 Pro also makes this list, as both phones share the same camera specs and smarts. But I\u2019d much rather take this chance to hype up one of the best pocket-sized phones you can still get your hands on. After all, this is the one phone that\u2019s made its way back into my pocket more than any other whenever I find myself between reviews, and if you don\u2019t care about having a larger screen for snaps, the Pixel 9 Pro gets you that same industry-leading camera package for under $1,000, so it\u2019ll save you some cash, too.\nGoogle\u2019s 6.3-inch flagship packs the same hardware \u2014 50MP primary, 48MP periscope telephoto, and 48MP ultrawide sensors \u2014 as the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but the smaller body makes it much easier to pull out of your pocket and grab a photo before you miss the moment. On top of that, the Pixel 9 Pro still supports all of the same AI-powered shooting modes like Add Me, the refreshed Panorama mode, and the ability to edit your shots after the fact with Magic Editor.\nWant to see the proof for yourself? You can check out a whole bunch of our camera test samples in this Google Drive.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro takes everything we loved about the XL and, well, shrinks it.\nOf course, to make its compact Pro model run smoothly, Google had to make a cut or two. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t follow the path of Apple\u2019s previous Pros, putting different telephoto sensors on each size, but instead opted for a smaller battery. The Pixel 9 Pro packs a still-solid 4,700mAh battery with 27W wired charging from the same USB-C Pixel charger I\u2019ve mentioned once or twice and 21W wireless charging from the in-house Pixel Stand. Otherwise, though, everything from the combination of aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 to the top-notch build quality and the still-questionable Temperature Sensor is a perfect match for the full-sized flagship.\nMotorola Razr Ultra: The best flip-style Android foldable\n- Blisteringly fast charging and excellent battery life\n- Ultra-flagship-tier performance\n- Solid dual camera setup\n- Top-notch materials and eye-catching Pantone colors\n- Two very vibrant displays\n- Clean, simple software\n- Moto AI feels half baked\n- Limited software commitment\n- Long-range zoom kinda stinks\n- Expensive\nIt\u2019s tough to pick a flip phone as my favorite overall Android phone, but I think the Motorola Razr Ultra is about as close as any has come. After all, it\u2019s the first of its form factor to truly take the training wheels off, packing its spec sheet with Ultra-grade decisions while carefully dancing within its limits. It takes almost everything I loved about the previous flagship Razr foldable, fixes the odd camera decision I thought I\u2019d like, and then adds an extra dose of power in the form of additional RAM and Qualcomm\u2019s top-tier chipset.\nMore specifically, the Razr Ultra packs an impressive 16GB of RAM in its base configuration with 512GB of storage by default, both of which are more than any of Samsung\u2019s foldables can match. It then pairs them up with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and a 4,700mAh battery that towers over that of most flip phones I\u2019ve reviewed. Not only that, but Motorola\u2019s top-tier flip phone also packs a charging setup worth writing home about. The Razr Ultra ships ready to handle up to 68W wired TurboPower speeds with 30W wireless charging as a backup, at least as long as you have a capable charger. That\u2019s fast enough to run circles around everyone but OnePlus in the US, and makes an already great phone feel even better.\nThe Razr Ultra is by far the best-looking, most powerful flip phone I've ever used.\nPerhaps what wins the Razr Ultra the most points over Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Flip lineup is that I still prefer its cover screen experience. There are no hoops to jump through, no extra software to install, and no weird layouts to avoid. Yes, your apps use the entire display by default, meaning they might get cut off by the camera cutouts, but you can quickly fix that with a press of the gesture pill to compact the interface into a smaller square. On top of that, AI companions like Perplexity, Gemini, and Moto AI come optimized for the cover screen, making it easy to ask for help when needed.\nWhile I don\u2019t usually like to put too much stock into the way a phone looks \u2014 especially if I\u2019m going to put it into a case \u2014 there\u2019s no way around it on the Razr Ultra. Every colorful finish that Motorola offers comes from its close partnership with Pantone, and the different back panels offer more personality than the usual mix of Gorilla Glass can match. I reviewed the Mountain Trail version, which comes with a wooden back and a bronzed aluminum frame, but Motorola\u2019s Scarab finish is an eye-catcher with its deep green color and slightly fuzzy Alcantara back panel. I might be concerned about how it\u2019ll age in the coming years, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve seen anyone use materials quite like Motorola.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold: The best tablet-style Android foldable\n- Impressively thin design that opens completely flat\n- Excellent displays with high brightness\n- Thoughtful enhancements to Android for foldables\n- Lots of Gemini-powered AI features\n- Seven years of update support\n- Camera setup weaker than other Pixel 9s\n- Sluggish, frustrating charging\n- Tensor G4 behind the competition for power\n- Buttons too low\n- Extremely high price\nAt long last, there\u2019s a new king of the tablet-style Android foldable phones. Yes, this was Samsung\u2019s spot to lose for a long time \u2014 partly because it was the only real option in the US for several years \u2014 and now it\u2019s happened. After an original Pixel Fold that felt like a bright idea with classic prototype flaws, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold feels ready to stand on its own two feet, or at least two sides of its hinge. Google took everything we liked about its original form factor, ironed out the quirks, and then completely reimagined its internal display for a more comfortable experience.\nWhat surprised me most about coming to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold a little late in the game is that it doesn\u2019t feel too different from the small Pixel 9 Pro, at least not when closed. As a result, I\u2019m much more willing to pull it out of my pocket for casual tasks like streaming, social media, and updating my Strava activities without feeling like I\u2019m trying to type on a knife\u2019s edge. Then, when I\u2019ve found whatever show I\u2019m desperately trying to keep up with, I\u2019m perfectly comfortable opening the nearly bezelless internal display and only losing a bit of space to letterboxing.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold feels like a much larger upgrade than simply a second-year refresh.\nAlthough it\u2019s a massive leap forward for Google\u2019s foldables overall, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold isn\u2019t without its quirks. Its slim form factor means the Tensor G4 chipset has to work a little harder to vent heat, while the 4,650mAh battery is held back by just 21W wired charging \u2014 barely faster than what you get from the Pixel 9a for a third of the cost. Google\u2019s peripheral cameras feel like odd choices, too, with just a 10.8MP telephoto and 10.5MP ultrawide to hold down the newly square camera bump.\nAnd yet, I still feel like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the best tablet-style foldable you can get your hands on. Maybe it\u2019s because many of the Android Authority crew are Pixel fans by nature, but I feel like Google\u2019s approach to Android remains one of the cleanest and easiest to navigate, with the right mix of optimizations for the internal display. You\u2019ll also get the full suite of AI-powered features like Call Screen, Pixel Studio, and Gemini Live, just with far more real estate on which to explore them.\nOnePlus 13: The best Android phone for battery life\n- Gorgeous design\n- Incredible camera zoom and overall photography\n- Helpful AI integration\n- Excellent charging options\n- Simplified Oxygen OS experience\n- Great performance\n- Magnetic charging requires accessories\n- Fewer updates than Samsung or Google\nThese days, 5,000mAh batteries have almost become the standard on large Android flagships. Everyone is using them, from Google to Samsung to Motorola, and it\u2019s made life hard when hunting for the phone with the best battery life. However, whenever everyone seems to catch up, there\u2019s always one brand ready to jump ahead again. To nobody\u2019s surprise, it\u2019s once again the flagship killer, OnePlus. Its OnePlus 13 is a shoo-in for the best battery life, and it comes down to a no-limits combination of capacity and charging speed. Plus, it also helps that it\u2019s generally one of the best phones OnePlus has ever made.\nUp first, the cell that keeps the lights on. The OnePlus 13\u2019s 6,000mAh cell is large enough to make all but the most dedicated gaming phones feel inadequate. It\u2019s a full 1,000mAh larger than the battery Samsung tapped for its Galaxy S25 Ultra or Google chose for its Pixel 9 Pro XL, yet the OnePlus 13 is no thicker than either one. It can achieve such a remarkable capacity thanks to its switch from lithium-ion technology to silicon-carbon, a move that we\u2019d love to see the likes of Samsung copy the next time it tries an ultra-thin Edge model.\nBetter, our objective drain testing showed that the OnePlus 13 can go on and on thanks to its impressive cooling setup and efficient Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. It does experience some pretty extreme throttling here and there, occasionally quitting out benchmarking tests in the name of thermal management, but I\u2019ve always been able to go two days between charges, so I\u2019m not complaining.\nOnePlus's 6,000mAh battery looms large over most other Android flagships.\nAnd, when you inevitably drain your OnePlus 13, SuperVOOC charging is some of the best in the business. You\u2019ll need to keep the included USB-A charger close at hand since SuperVOOC is a much different standard than USB PD PPS in terms of support, but when you watch the OnePlus 13 fly back to a 50% charge in just 13 minutes, you probably won\u2019t have an issue with it. OnePlus\u2019s latest flagship also supports 50W wireless charging through a brand-new magnetic charger with a built-in fan, though you\u2019ll need a magnetic charger and might have to use a special plastic panel to protect the Arctic Dawn finish should you choose that colorway \u2014 it\u2019s a bit of a confusing mess, and the only blot on an otherwise near-perfect package.\nASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro: Best Android phone for gaming\n- Overkill performance\n- Outstanding battery life\n- Fast, universal charging\n- Super-stable video\n- Handy AI tools\n- Expensive Pro model\n- Poor software commitment\n- Inconsistent cameras\n- No 4K recording on all lenses\nThe last of our main selections for this list of the best Android phones is one for the gamers, literally. ASUS\u2019s ROG Phone 9 Pro is about as close to a gaming laptop as you can get, at least if you can ignore that it doesn\u2019t fold in half. It has a frankly ridiculous spec sheet, offering up to 24GB of RAM with a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip under the hood and 65W wired charging that\u2019s much faster than the MacBook Air I\u2019m using to assemble this list.\nOf course, those features aren\u2019t completely unheard of in the flagship Android segment \u2014 well, 24GB of RAM is a lot \u2014 but its clever gaming tweaks set the ROG Phone 9 Pro apart. It pulls the programmable matrix from the back of the ROG Zephyrus and pairs it with pressure-sensitive triggers dotted around the frame to help you draw some of the controls off the 6.78-inch AMOLED itself. Those features, combined with the improved efficiency of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, had my colleague Rob Triggs gaming with a smile, pushing the ROG Phone 9 Pro as hard as he wanted to find out where its throttling point lay.\nFor what might be the first time, though, Rob also declared this to be a gaming phone he might not mind using every day. See, a lot of gaming-specific devices fall into the common trap of being too big, too edgy, and too expensive for casual usage, not to mention the fact that camera hardware almost always comes last. On the ROG Phone 9 Pro, however, you get an updated 50MP LYTIA 700 sensor for the bulk of your photography, and ASUS has reimagined its stabilization for better video shooting. The display is also brighter and smoother than before, topping out at a 185Hz refresh rate and 2,500 nits of brightness, which is more than enough for a bright, sunny day.\nThe ROG Phone 9 Pro is an elite gaming phone that's flexible enough for everyday usage.\nAlso, if you\u2019re serious about pushing the ROG Phone 9 Pro to its gaming limits (and why wouldn\u2019t you be?), ASUS has several accessories worth checking out. Rob got plenty of mileage out of the detachable controller below, though he also mentioned the external cooling setup as a helpful option when trying to game and charge simultaneously. And, if you\u2019re not set on the customizable LED matrix on the back, you can also check out the ROG Phone 9 to save a couple of bucks.\nHonorable mentions\nIf the Xiaomi 15 Ultra were just a little bit easier to access in the US, it might have earned a full spot on our list rather than simply an honorable mention, and I think it still has a legitimate claim to being the best Android camera phone. Like the last few Ultras, it\u2019s practically a mirrorless camera with a phone on the back, pairing a trio of 50MP sensors with a 200MP telephoto camera and sporting an overall design that\u2019s reminiscent of a Leica mirrorless camera to go along with Xiaomi\u2019s Leica-tuned color science.\nMaking its first full appearance on this list (CMF Phone 2 Pro not withstanding), the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is one of the most fun mid-rangers I\u2019ve reviewed in a while. Yes, it suffers from the same limited US band support as its siblings, but it\u2019s easy to fall in love with the dot-based Nothing OS skin, the light-up Glyph Interface, and the snappy 50W wired charging. I might like the more subtle camera bump on the Nothing Phone 3a a little better, but the extra zoom flexibility is a worthy tradeoff.\nOnePlus\u2019s proper 2025 flagship is more than deserving of its place as our battery king, but its mid-range option isn\u2019t far behind. Some might say that the OnePlus 13R is a bit of a 2024 flagship in disguise, and I think they\u2019d be right \u2014 in the best of ways. It pairs a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset with a OnePlus 13-esque design, housing a trio of camera sensors in its circular bump. I\u2019ll never complain about a phone with a 6,000mAh battery capacity, though it\u2019s a bit of a bummer that the included SuperVOOC charger will only get you to 55W.\nAlthough I\u2019m happy to call Motorola\u2019s latest Razr Ultra the best flip phone, it\u2019s also the most expensive. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Flip 6, on the other hand, picks up right where the Galaxy Z Flip 5 left off, with two capable cameras, a folder-shaped Flex Window, and nabs a chipset upgrade to keep things interesting. You\u2019ll have to get used to having two app drawers if you want more than Maps, YouTube, and Google Messages at your disposal, but Samsung\u2019s full-screen widgets are simply excellent.\nIn that same vein, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 has gone from setting the standard for book-style foldables to playing second fiddle to the Pixel. It\u2019s still an excellent foldable, and its taller, thinner internal display sometimes makes a bit more sense than Google\u2019s wide aspect ratio, but it hasn\u2019t changed too much outside of a chipset upgrade in recent years, still sporting the same battery, charging setup, and cameras as the Folds that came before it.\nIf you\u2019ve spent any time looking for a great Android phone, you\u2019ll know there aren\u2019t many small ones left. Somehow, 6.5-inch or larger displays have become the standard, leaving those of us with smaller hands relegated to a precious few picks. Thankfully, the Pixel 9 is one of those, offering quite a lot of the Pro-level experience in a slightly more comfortable form factor. Its 6.3-inch display is easy to reach across yet doesn\u2019t feel so tiny that you\u2019re missing out on real estate. If we hadn\u2019t already put every other Pixel 9 device on this list, this one might have earned more than an honorable mention.\nMany of Samsung\u2019s best offerings lay it on pretty heavy with the focus on power users, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. However, it also has the unintended benefit of making Samsung\u2019s budget-conscious picks stand out slightly more. The Galaxy S24 FE is one such option, landing just below the flagship tier with a display that nearly matches the Galaxy S25 Plus, materials like aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus Plus that I\u2019d trust without a case, and just enough of a dip into Galaxy AI to give more users a taste of Chat Assist, Note Assist, and better photo editing tools.\nWhat to look for in a good Android phone\nWe could sit here and list the best Android phones all day \u2014 we\u2019re phone nerds, it\u2019s our job. We\u2019ll sit here and reminisce on some of the best phones from yesteryear, too, looking for any excuse to pull something fun out of the closet. However, just because we like one or two or ten things about a phone doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right for you. There\u2019s much more to consider before you splash the cash, especially if you plan to have this phone for several years.\nWe have our favorite Android phones, but the best way for you to pick one is to break it down into the features you really want.\nFor example, if you want a small, super-portable phone, something like the Galaxy S25 Ultra simply won\u2019t work, no matter how you try to wrangle it. That 6.9-inch display will always feel too big for your pocket. At the same time, it\u2019s a great phone that packs flexible cameras, a powerful chipset, and a convenient S Pen, so it\u2019s all about deciding what features you absolutely must have in a device.\nSo, with that in mind, here are a few things I always tell people to look for when buying a new phone:\n- Software updates: A phone is only as good as the number of software updates it will receive. You won\u2019t be able to change your battery, display, or camera hardware over time, so most of the value you\u2019ll pull from a phone comes from keeping it for years and years after you\u2019ve paid it off. The best way to guarantee some of that value is with a Pixel or Galaxy device set for seven years of patches, though Motorola and OnePlus are catching up with four and five years of support at their flagship levels.\n- Camera flexibility: If you\u2019re after one of the best Android phones on the market, you probably have high camera expectations. It\u2019s perfectly understandable \u2014 you\u2019ll probably capture your life with this device for several years. And, as you might have noticed, single-camera Android phones aren\u2019t a thing anymore. So, if you prioritize a great camera phone, you\u2019ll want to keep an eye on things like sensor size, telephoto focal length, and how your phone processes images after the fact.\n- Display size: As mentioned above, finding a small Android phone is easier said than done these days. There aren\u2019t many 6.1-inch or 6.2-inch options left, with premium picks like the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Galaxy S25 Ultra measuring close to 7 inches, and many budget to mid-range options measuring 6.5 inches or larger. Also, if display size is no issue (or you want a phone that can check two boxes at once), you might consider a foldable that can take over for a tablet, too.\n- RAM and storage options: Depending on your needs, you might also want to monitor the RAM and storage that your chosen Android phone comes with. At one point, 8GB of RAM was enough to tackle everything from web browsing to gaming to streaming a full season on Netflix, but no longer. With the explosion of AI-powered features, 12GB is closer to the bare minimum for flagships, while the Pixel 9 Pro series feels even more capable with 16GB across the board.\n- To fold or not to fold: Foldable Android phones remain one of the most exciting categories in tech, at least to me. They\u2019ve improved by leaps and bounds in recent years, picking up better cameras, thinner hinges, and better protection against water and dust. However, you\u2019ll still have to weigh out whether or not you have the budget to try something new and if you can live with a spec sheet that hasn\u2019t caught up just yet.\n- Durability: These days, phones feature more premium materials than ever, sometimes pairing aluminum and titanium frames with advanced glasses like Panda Glass and Gorilla Glass or interesting textures like vegan leather and, in the case of the Razr Ultra, Alcantara. My advice would be to think about what materials you want and whether or not you plan to put your phone in a case. Also, keep in mind that IP68 ratings against water and dust have become the standard for many flagships, so think twice before settling for a lower rating, even if it saves money.\n- Charging speed: It\u2019s no longer a surprise to see phones ship with 5,000mAh batteries \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s expected on phones of a certain size. However, with great power capacity comes great responsibility, so you\u2019ll want to keep an eye on the charging speeds that your new phone supports. Some, like OnePlus, offer up to 80W speeds with the correct charger, while others, like the Galaxy S25, won\u2019t go above 25W no matter how hard you try. Also, if you opt for something like the Pixel 9 Pro XL, you\u2019ll need Google\u2019s in-house USB-C charger to guarantee the best speeds, so you might need to budget for some extra charging accessories.\n- AI features: One last thing worth watching \u2014 and probably the least essential of my picks \u2014 is the list of AI features your new phone will support. If you opt for a flagship Pixel or a Galaxy S25, you\u2019ll get a pretty solid set of Gemini and Galaxy AI picks, while the OnePlus 13 and Motorola Razr lineup might lag behind just a bit. Then again, you might find that the available features don\u2019t quite mesh with your usage or don\u2019t feel quite polished enough, so you may also be able to get by with Circle to Search and some of the other features that have made their way to lower price points.\nWhy you should trust me\nI\u2019m a phone guy \u2014 always have been. I can still rattle off every device I\u2019ve ever purchased with my own money, and I continue to hold the LG G3 as one of my favorite phones of all time. I stayed almost perfectly true to Android ever since my parents got me my first smartphone after I made it to high school, at least as long as you\u2019re willing to forgive the few years I spent with an iPhone 7 when I let green bubble bullying get the best of me.\nSince then, I\u2019ve made my love of phones into my day job, shifting my personal SIM more times than I can count and spending time with everything from the Motorola Moto G Play (2021) to the OnePlus Open to the Galaxy S25 Ultra in my pocket. I won\u2019t pretend to have loved every phone I\u2019ve reviewed \u2014 you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet \u2014 but I\u2019ve taken highlights away from each one and come to appreciate Android options both high and low.\nI review dozens of Android phones every single year, and my personal SIM moves around enough to qualify for frequent flyer status.\nFurther, my opinions come from more than simply running around with a new phone in my pocket. Part of my role as a reviewer is to work closely with my colleague, and our resident testing expert, Rob Triggs, to come up with objective metrics by which we can compare devices. We\u2019ve worked closely to cook up tests for battery life and charging, along with a nicely standardized set of ways to put CPUs and GPUs through their paces long before I ever sit down to write a review. Do I still count my hands-on experience? Of course I do, but I also like to ensure that data backs them up. If you want more information on our testing procedures, you can read our full methodology at the link.\nWhat do you look for in an Android phone?\nSometimes, my need to be thorough means that I\u2019m not the first reviewer to press the publish button, and I\u2019m rarely the shortest and sweetest among my peers, but I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll happily cause a little bit of a headache for my editor (shout out to you, Ollie) if it means I know I\u2019m being as thorough as possible. Besides, with how far phones have come in just the last few years, I\u2019m not sure how anyone could put together a review without stopping and taking a few stretch breaks.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."
