  "content": "What\u2019s the best way to handle financial disagreements in a relationship?\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love a story that ends with \u201cand they lived happily ever after\u201d? Whether it\u2019s a fairy tale or a rom-com, everyone swoons when the pair that belonged together all along finally heads off into the sunset hand in hand.\n\nLearn More: 3 Advanced Investing Moves Experts Use to Minimize Taxes and Help Boost Returns\n\nYet the story usually ends at this point. There\u2019s no mention of what that happily ever after really looks like \u2014 sharing space, juggling busy schedules and navigating arguments about money.\n\nPart of merging your life with someone else\u2019s means integrating your finances. Depending on your upbringing, personal history and beliefs, you could be bringing some very different money mindsets to the table \u2014 and serving up a perfect recipe for conflict.\n\nFortunately, according to Rachel Cruze, bestselling author and financial expert, achieving that \u201chappily ever after\u201d is possible \u2014 even when you\u2019re still figuring out how to manage money as a couple.\n\nGOBankingRates caught up with Cruze to ask why couples fight about money and what they can do to achieve their own financial harmony.\n\nIt Goes Deeper Than Dollars and Cents\n\nSometimes, a fight that seems like it\u2019s all about money isn\u2019t just about dollars and cents. Cruze explained that most financial disagreements stem from deeper emotional issues, like trust, communication and feeling disconnected from your partner.\n\n\u201cI always say: Money touches every part of your life, from what groceries you buy to the dreams you have for your future,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if there\u2019s tension in how you\u2019re handling money, it\u2019s going to spill over into everything else. That\u2019s why I\u2019m such a big believer in working together, not separately.\u201d\n\nUnderstanding that there are emotional and philosophical factors at play in how you and your partner think about money is key to having practical, productive conversations about your finances. Cruze\u2019s advice? \u201cStop hiding, start communicating, and get on a plan together.\u201d\n\nRead Next: How Much Debt Is Too Much To Marry Into? Rachel Cruze Weighs In\n\nRemember that old Paula Abdul tune, \u201cOpposites Attract\u201d? (You know, the one where she dances with a cartoon cat?) Well, she might have been onto something when it comes to love. And when it comes to money, opposites often do attract, like when a spender marries a saver.\n\nThat pairing might sound like a recipe for conflict, but Cruze said it can actually be a strength \u2014 if you approach it the right way.\n\n\u201cThe key is not trying to change each other but learning how to work together,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to set goals as a couple and create a budget that reflects both of your values.\u201d\n\nShe points to her own marriage as an example. She and her husband, Winston, include \u201cfun money\u201d in their budget so each of them has the freedom to spend a little without guilt or resentment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all part of our shared plan,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember: You\u2019re not two individuals managing money; you\u2019re a team. And teams win when they communicate and stay focused on the same goal.\u201d\n\nCruze is quick to remind you that financial disagreements are normal in any relationship. The important thing isn\u2019t avoiding them \u2014 it\u2019s handling them with empathy and honesty.\n\n\u201cStart by reminding yourself: You\u2019re not enemies. You\u2019re on the same team,\u201d she said. \u201cBe willing to have those tough conversations, really listen, and try to understand where your spouse is coming from.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy friend Dr. Les Parrott says, \u2018Conflict is the price we pay for deeper intimacy.\u2019 And he\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes a good counselor can help too! Just don\u2019t avoid the issue. Facing it head-on with grace and honesty is what brings growth and unity in your marriage.\u201d\n\nJust like regular date nights help keep the romance alive, you and your partner should also consider a monthly budget check-in to stay financially in sync.\n\n\u201cJust sit down, look at your income and expenses, and plan where every dollar is going for the month. It doesn\u2019t have to be stressful or super formal,\u201d she said.\n\nShe and Winston do this every month, and she says it gives them peace of mind and keeps them on the same page.\n\n\u201cWe also use the EveryDollar budgeting app, which makes it easy for both of us to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d she added.\n\nEveryDollar is a zero-based budgeting app designed to help individuals and couples assign a purpose to every dollar, making it a practical tool for building unity and staying organized.\n\n\u201cWhen you make budgeting a routine, it builds trust, reduces stress, and helps you feel like you\u2019re on the same team,\u201d Cruze said.\n\nHappily ever after doesn\u2019t just mean candlelit dinners \u2014 it also means coming together to navigate the everyday realities of building a life together, like figuring out your budget.\n\nIf you follow Rachel Cruze\u2019s advice and lead with communication, create shared goals and build in regular check-ins, you might just argue less, save more and grow stronger together.\n\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

      "text": "Ramit Sethi: Avoid These 5 Phrases in Your Money Conversations\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nMany people leave money talk out of their conversations, but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. If you choose your words carefully, money doesn\u2019t have to be as scary or uncomfortable of a subject as it may seem.\nFinancial literacy is crucial to avoiding money problems and staying on top of your personal finances. However, many Americans don\u2019t seem comfortable talking about money at all, according to an Empower survey. Here are some key results to note:\n- 62% of Americans don\u2019t talk about money overall\n- 63% of Americans don\u2019t talk about money with their family\n- 75% of Americans don\u2019t talk about money with their friends\n- 46% of Americans don\u2019t talk about money with their partner or spouse\nHere are five phrases to avoid when having money conversations, according to financial guru Ramit Sethi:\n\u2018I Just Want To\u2026\u2019\nSethi explained in a post on TikTok that the word \u201cjust\u201d on its own has a sort of minimizing effect on your financial goals. It\u2019s critical to not reduce the importance of money in your life. \u201cJust\u201d doing something won\u2019t contribute to building a financially secure life for yourself.\n\u2018Budget\u2019\nWhile budgeting may be helpful for some, it can be stressful and overwhelming for others. It might be best to leave this word out of money conversations altogether.\n\u2018We Need To Get Serious\u2019\nThe word \u201cserious\u201d automatically adds a stern (and possibly intense) tone to any money conversation. If you\u2019re trying to make the conversation more approachable and lighthearted, it\u2019s important to leave out harsh phrases like this one.\n\u2018Credit Card Bill\u2019\nCredit card debt is usually never good, and if you carry too much of it, you\u2019ll want to get rid of it as quickly as possible. However, starting a money conversation with credit card bills or debt at the forefront can be an automatic turnoff or even an immediate non-starter. Consider starting with lighter topics as a segue into such a serious money issue as credit card debt.\n\u2018You Always\u2026/You Never\u2026\u2019\nIn many cases, starting a sentence with \u201cyou\u201d can sound like you\u2019re pointing fingers and seriously turn someone off. If you\u2019re having a money conversation with your immediate family or significant other, use the word \u201cwe\u201d rather than \u201cyou.\u201d It can seem less accusatory and help make the conversation more comfortable for all parties."

      "text": "Love is patient, love is kind\u2026 but love also has bills to pay. \ud83d\udc9d Talking about money might not be anyone\u2019s idea of romance, but it\u2019s a conversation every couple needs to have. Money and marriage go hand in hand, and if you\u2019re not financially in sync, you might find yourselves bickering over more than just whose turn it is to do the dishes.\nWhether you\u2019re negotiating purchases or merging bank accounts, figuring out how to manage money as a couple can keep financial stress from crashing your love story. Because nothing kills the mood faster than an unexpected overdraft fee. \ud83d\udcb3\n8 tips for money and marriage\nNavigating finances in marriage takes teamwork, transparency, and a little strategy. Here\u2019s how to manage money in marriage \u2014 and create a money game plan with your partner \u2014 without turning every budgeting talk into a fight.\n1. Create a shared budget together\nThink of your budget as a financial roadmap for your relationship. Sit down together and map out your income, expenses, savings goals, and spending habits. This is also the time for financial honesty: debts, salaries, shopping habits, investments \u2014 when it comes to financial planning for married couples, everything needs to be on the table.\nA shared budget is key to money management for couples, as it keeps both partners accountable and prevents financial surprises. But if one person is a strict saver while the other loves spontaneous purchases, expect some differences in opinion. The key is to compromise and ensure that both partners feel comfortable with the spending plan.\nLearn: How to Build a Healthy Relationship with Money\n2. Open a household checking account\nA joint checking account makes managing shared expenses \u2014 like rent, utilities, and groceries \u2014 easier. Some couples deposit equal amounts, while others contribute based on income percentage. There\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach when it comes to how to manage joint finances, as long as it feels fair to both people.\nEven with a shared account, many couples also keep personal accounts for discretionary spending. This allows each partner some financial independence while ensuring that essential bills are covered together.\n3. Add your spouse as a beneficiary on your 401(k)\nIf something happens to you, your spouse should be financially protected. Adding them as a beneficiary on your retirement accounts, including your 401(k), ensures they receive those funds without legal complications. It\u2019s a simple step that can provide long-term security.\nIf you\u2019ve been married before, double-check your beneficiary designations. Many people forget to update these, which can lead to unintended complications.\n4. Set clear financial boundaries and expectations\nThis is one of the most important financial tips for married couples. That\u2019s because every couple has different views on money, so it\u2019s important to set ground rules early. Discuss spending thresholds that require mutual agreement before a purchase. For example, one person may be fine with spending $500 on a vacuum, while the other wants to have a discussion first. Setting clear expectations can help eliminate financial problems in marriage.\nAlso, talk about how to manage individual debts brought into the relationship. Will each person continue paying their own student loans, or will they tackle them together? Establishing boundaries in advance helps avoid resentment later.\n5. Split expenses fairly (which doesn\u2019t always mean equally)\nFair doesn\u2019t always mean splitting every bill 50/50. If one partner earns significantly more, dividing expenses based on income percentage can make things feel more balanced. This approach ensures that both partners contribute without putting financial strain on the lower earner.\nAgreeing on a method for covering bills prevents misunderstandings. Whether it\u2019s pooling all income together or keeping finances semi-separate, what matters is that you both feel the arrangement is fair.\n6. Develop shared long-term financial goals\nEvery couple should have a financial vision for the future. Whether it\u2019s buying a home, traveling more, paying off debt, or retiring early, aligning on major goals ensures both partners are working toward the same priorities.\nThese goals should be revisited regularly. As life changes, so will financial plans. Checking in helps make sure you both remain on the same page. One of the best money-saving tips for couples is actually to communicate about what you\u2019re spending.\n7. Maintain a level of financial independence\nEven in the healthiest relationships, financial autonomy is important. Having a personal account or discretionary fund allows each partner to make purchases without seeking approval. It\u2019s a way to avoid resentment and maintain a sense of independence.\nThat said, financial independence doesn\u2019t mean secrecy. Major financial decisions should still be discussed openly to prevent conflicts or surprises.\n8. Schedule monthly \u201cmoney dates\u201d\nInstead of waiting until there\u2019s a financial issue, set aside time each month for a \u201cmoney date\u201d to go over your finances together. Reviewing budgets, tracking progress toward savings goals, and discussing any upcoming expenses keeps both partners informed.\nA \u201cmoney date\u201d doesn\u2019t have to be stressful \u2014 make it enjoyable by grabbing your favorite snacks, pouring a drink, or treating yourselves after. The goal is to keep financial discussions consistent and constructive. And if the conversation goes well, you could be finding yourself feeling romantic.\nLove and Money: Finding the Right Balance\nManaging money and marriage takes communication, compromise, and a willingness to be open about finances. Whether you\u2019re figuring out the best way to budget as a couple or navigating money issues in marriage, the key is to create a financial system that works for you both. Talk early, talk often, and most importantly: keep your love stronger than your spending habits.\nFAQs\nWhat\u2019s the best way for couples to manage their money together?\nThe best way to budget as a couple depends on your relationship and income dynamics. Many couples use a mix of joint and separate accounts, set clear spending limits, and check in regularly on financial goals.\nShould you share money in a relationship?\nIt depends! Some couples fully merge their finances, while others prefer to keep some independence. The best way to combine finances when married is the way that ensures trust, transparency, and fairness.\nHow do married couples split finances?\nHow to handle finances in marriage depends on the couple. Couples can split expenses equally or based on income percentages. The key is finding a system that feels fair to both partners and prevents money issues in marriage from becoming a source of stress."

While taxes shouldn\u2019t be the sole focus of your investment strategy, they can take a serious chunk out of your returns if you\u2019re not careful.\nThat\u2019s why the most seasoned investors focus on advanced strategies designed to minimize their tax bill and help boost what stays in their portfolio.\nKeep more of what you earn with Betterment\u2019s tax-saving tech.

Learn more.\nIf you\u2019re a long-term investor who wants to grow your wealth the smart way, consider using these six strategies:\n1. Tax Loss Harvesting \u2014 Helps Offset Capital Gains\nThe stock market ebbs and flows. It can\u2019t be predicted. So it\u2019s inevitable that even the best portfolios will experience losses. That\u2019s where tax loss harvesting can be a smart strategy.\nTax loss harvesting is the practice of selling a security that has experienced a loss. By realizing, or \u201charvesting\u201d a loss, investors are able to offset taxes on both gains and income. The sold security is replaced by a similar one, ideally maintaining an optimal asset allocation and expected returns.\nThe losses can then be used to offset capital gains and potentially reduce ordinary income by up to $3,000 annually, with remaining losses carried forward.\nTurn market losses into potential tax wins. Betterment\u2019s automated tax tools use investment losses to help offset gains, potentially lowering your tax bill. Make the most of market dips. Learn more.\n2. Tax-Coordinated Portfolio \u2014 Make Sure You\u2019re as Tax-Efficient As Possible\nIf you\u2019re investing across different types of accounts \u2014 say a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, and a taxable brokerage account \u2014 it\u2019s wise to strategically organize your assets according to their tax efficiency. You generally want to place less tax-efficient assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts.\nThe goal here is to minimize the taxes you\u2019ll pay on investment growth. But this can be complicated to do on your own.\nInvest like a tax pro. Betterment\u2019s asset location strategy is designed to improve your after-tax returns year round \u2014 helping you keep more of what you earn. Save on taxes. Learn more.\n3. Charitable Giving Made Tax-Efficient\nPlanning to give back? Donating appreciated securities can reduce your capital gains taxes and allow you to deduct the full value of the donation, assuming you itemize.\nIt\u2019s a powerful way to support causes you care about while getting a potential tax break in return.\nBottom Line\nTaking advantage of tax-smart strategies can help maximize your investment returns and keep more of your returns in your portfolio.\nYou may think about your taxes one day a year. Betterment thinks about them all year. Smarter investing starts with tax-saving tech that works all year round. Keep more of what you earn.

We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nBuilding a budget is one of the smartest ways to take control of your finances. This guide will walk you through the basics of budgeting, including different methods you can use, tips for creating a plan that fits your lifestyle and a sample budget to help you get started.\nHow To Make a Budget: 6 Simple Steps\nWhen you are making a personal budget, you need one that is realistic for your needs. You may want to start with a few broad spending categories or monthly expenses and narrow them down as you learn your spending patterns and where you have room to save money.\nMoney management is not always easy, but knowing how to get started can help. These step-by-step instructions for how to make a budget will get you going:\nStep 1. List Your Essential Living Expenses\nStart with budgeting living expenses like housing, food, transportation and car payments. These are all payments you make each month or week and are considered necessities.\nIt\u2019s important to factor in needs versus wants when it comes to knowing what you are actually spending money on.\nStep 2. Identify Flexible and Recurring Costs\nBy analyzing your recurring expenses, you can see what are priorities and what are not.\nPaying down debts such as student loans is important, but subscriptions to five different streaming services are not.\nEdit down what you use and what you don\u2019t to trim some fat from where you\u2019re spending money.\nStep 3. Calculate Your After-Tax Income\nAdd up your take-home income, which is what you make after any taxes or deductions. Make sure to include income from your spouse or partner\u2019s full-time job and any money from side hustles and other gigs.\nWhen you know the total amount you bring in each month, it makes it easier to break down your budget.\nGood To Know\nA good way to split up your savings and expenditures is by putting them into budget percentages.\nFor example, you could try the 50/30/20 rule. This is where you allocate 50% of your income to your needs, 30% to wants and 20% to building up savings and paying down debt.\nStep 4. Set Realistic Financial Goals\nUse your priorities to set aside money for a future payoff. Your priorities for financial goals might include:\n- Overall financial stability\n- Establishing a savings or emergency fund\n- Saving for retirement\n- Paying down debt\n- Saving for a large purchase, such as a home, car, education or starting a business\nStep 5. Track and Review Your Spending\nYou can record and track your spending manually, but there are also several great tools or apps you can use to do so.\nEach week, touch base with other spenders in your household so you\u2019re on the same page with your income and expenses for the week. Look at the previous month and evaluate your spending as compared to your budget.\nHere\u2019s one way to do this:\n- Make a column for your spending budget.\n- Make a column for your actual spending.\n- Determine the percentage you spent in each category.\n- Calculate the difference between your budget and your actual spending.\n6. Adjust Your Budget as You Grow\nAdjusting, reviewing and reevaluating your budget regularly should be a part of your process.\n- Use your weekly or monthly monitoring to decide your budget percentages for the next month and allow for changes in income or expenses.\n- Look at categories where you overspent and allocate funds or cut spending in those categories.\n- Over time, you\u2019ll find out how to improve the budgeting process so that it better reflects your goals and priorities.\nSample Budget Breakdown\nCreating a simple monthly budget can help you stay on track with spending and saving. The example below is based on the 50/30/20 budgeting method, which divides your income into different categories. In this case, the total monthly income is $5,000:\nCategory Amount Percentage of Income Needs: housing, utilities, groceries $2,500 50% Wants: dining out, entertainment, shopping $1,500 30% Savings and debt repayment $1,000 20%\nTypes of Budgeting Methods\nWhen it comes to how to approach budgeting, there\u2019s an option for everyone. Here are some popular methods:\n- 50/30/20:\n- Developed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren, this budgeting method allocates 50% of your income to your needs, 30% to wants and 20% to building up savings and paying down debt.\n- Zero-based budgeting:\n- With zero-based budgeting, you allocate all of your income so that your income minus your expenses equals zero. Every dollar that comes in has a function.\n- Envelope method:\n- Popularized by Dave Ramsey, this method uses cash in envelopes to control spending. Each spending category has an envelope, and once the money is gone, you stop spending.\n- 80/20:\n- You focus on setting aside 20% of your income for savings. Everything else comes from the remaining 80%.\nBudgeting Methods At a Glance\n| Method | Best For | Key Features |\n|---|---|---|\n| 50/30/20 | Balanced spenders | 50% needs, 30% wants and 20% savings or debt payoff |\n| Zero-based | Those who want tight control | Every dollar is assigned a purpose; income minus expenses equals zero |\n| Envelope method | People who prefer cash systems | Cash placed into envelopes by category; once it\u2019s gone, no more spending |\n| 80/20 | Simplified savers | Save 20% of income automatically; spend the remaining 80% |\nExpert Tips To Stick to Your Budget\nFinding the right budgeting method might take some trial and error, but a few smart habits can help you stay on track:\n- Pick a method and stick with it: Start simple with something like the 80/20 or 50/30/20 budget. Both focus on saving while covering essentials and allowing room for spending.\n- Use apps and tools to stay organized: Banks often offer budgeting tools, and free apps can help track your spending and automate payments.\n- Check in with your budget every week: Reviewing your numbers weekly \u2014 not just monthly \u2014 can help you spot issues early.\n- Celebrate small wins: Whether its reaching a savings milestone or sticking to your grocery budget, recognizing progress keeps you motivated.\nWhat To Watch Out For When Budgeting\nBudgeting is easier when you know what to plan for. Keep an eye on these common factors:\n- Irregular income: Freelance or gig workers need a flexible budget that adjusts for variable income month to month.\n- Seasonal and irregular expenses: Budget for costs like holiday gifts, home repairs or medical bills before they sneak up on you.\n- Shared finances: If you split expenses with a partner or family member, communication and a shared plan are key.\n- Recurring expenses: Hidden automatic charges can drain your budget \u2014 review them every few months to see what\u2019s still worth paying for.\nFinal Take\nBudgeting money doesn\u2019t mean buckling down and never having a latte again. It\u2019s about giving yourself control \u2014 deciding where your money goes instead of wondering where it went.\nStart small, stay consistent and choose the budgeting style that works best for your life. Even minor adjustments, like tracking expenses weekly or setting tiny savings goals, can lead to big changes over time.\nThe key is to keep moving forward \u2014 not to get everything perfect from the start.\nFAQ\nHere are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions about making budgets.- How do I start budgeting with no experience?\n- Start by tracking your income and expenses for a month. Then, choose a simple budgeting method, like the 50/30/20 rule and set a small savings goal to build momentum.\n- What's the best budgeting method for beginners?\n- The 50/30/20 rule is a great place to start. It divides your income into the following:\n- Needs: 50%\n- Wants: 30%\n- Savings or debt repayment: 20%\n- The 50/30/20 rule is a great place to start. It divides your income into the following:\n- How much should I budget for each category?\n- A common guide is 50% of your income for needs, 30% for wants and 20% for savings or debt. You can adjust the percentages based on your goals and lifestyle.\n- What's the 50/30/20 rule?\n- The 50/30/20 budget rule is when you divide your after-tax income into different categories. Fifty percent of your income is put toward needs, 30% is put toward wants and 20% goes toward savings.\n- Is budgeting still useful if my income changes each month?\n- Yes, if your income varies, build your budget around your lowest expected monthly income. That way, you stay on track even when earnings fluctuate.\nCaitlyn Moorhead and Elizabeth Constantineau contributed to the reporting for this article."

      "text": "How Much Debt Is Too Much To Marry Into? Rachel Cruze Weighs In\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nIn 2025, the average person in the U.S. owes approximately $62,500 in debt, including student loans, mortgages, credit cards and personal loans. This means, if you\u2019re planning to get married, or hoping to in the future, your partner will likely be bringing debt to the union.\nIf you\u2019ve worked hard to pay off or avoid debt, this can be extremely frustrating. Some have questioned if it\u2019s worth it to marry someone saddled with debt and where to draw the line. Rachel Cruze, a personal finance expert and cohost of \u201cThe Ramsey Show,\u201d dove into the topic in a recent YouTube video. Here\u2019s how she would approach this tricky situation.\nAccept the Situation\nIf you decide to marry someone who has debt, you must accept it first and foremost. Cruze made the important point that the strongest marriages view themselves as a team. Finger-pointing and blaming your spouse for having debt will cause division and resentment. Likewise, keeping financial matters separate can lead to marital problems.\nDave Ramsey, Cruze\u2019s father, has explained why this is so important in the past. According to him, financial fights and problems are the leading cause of divorce in the U.S. However, he said, it\u2019s not about how much money or debt you have, but how you handle it as a team.\nSo, there isn\u2019t a specific number to look for when deciding how much debt is too much. Instead, determine if you\u2019ll be able to accept the situation and work together.\nMake a Plan\nWhile acceptance is an essential step, it doesn\u2019t fix anything on its own. You and your partner must come together to find a path to becoming debt-free and stick to it. If your spouse isn\u2019t willing to make lifestyle changes to get out of debt, you should view it as a red flag.\nOne plan that Cruze brought up is the debt snowball method. To take advantage of this strategy, list your debts from smallest to largest and continue making the minimum payments to each. Save up extra money and put it all toward the smallest debt you have. As you begin to pay off your smallest debts, you\u2019ll gain momentum and have more each month to throw at your larger debts.\nA variation of the debt snowball method is the debt avalanche method. The difference is that you list your debts from highest to lowest interest rate and work to pay down the highest-interest debts first. By doing this, you\u2019ll save more in the long term and can contribute more to your other debts.\nPay It Off\nWith a plan in place, you can shift your priorities together and find ways to put more money toward your debt. Cruze suggested selling things you don\u2019t need, trying to get a raise, looking for a side hustle and cutting nonessential expenses from your budget. However, it\u2019s important not to begin combining finances and paying off someone else\u2019s debts until after you get married and it becomes your joint debt.\nCruze made the point that couples can demonstrate their commitment to getting out of debt even before they tie the knot. In some instances, she\u2019s seen the partner who is in debt working harder and putting more toward paying off their own debt. Meanwhile, the partner without debt is saving extra money so that when they get married, that amount can go directly toward paying it down."

Whether it\u2019s a fairy tale or a rom-com, everyone swoons when the pair that belonged together all along finally heads off into the sunset hand in hand.\nYet the story usually ends at this point. There\u2019s no mention of what that happily ever after really looks like \u2014 sharing space, juggling busy schedules and navigating arguments about money.\nPart of merging your life with someone else\u2019s means integrating your finances. Depending on your upbringing, personal history and beliefs, you could be bringing some very different money mindsets to the table \u2014 and serving up a perfect recipe for conflict.\nFortunately, according to Rachel Cruze, bestselling author and financial expert, achieving that \u201chappily ever after\u201d is possible \u2014 even when you\u2019re still figuring out how to manage money as a couple.\nGOBankingRates caught up with Cruze to ask why couples fight about money and what they can do to achieve their own financial harmony.\nIt Goes Deeper Than Dollars and Cents\nSometimes, a fight that seems like it\u2019s all about money isn\u2019t just about dollars and cents. Cruze explained that most financial disagreements stem from deeper emotional issues, like trust, communication and feeling disconnected from your partner.\n\u201cI always say: Money touches every part of your life, from what groceries you buy to the dreams you have for your future,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if there\u2019s tension in how you\u2019re handling money, it\u2019s going to spill over into everything else. That\u2019s why I\u2019m such a big believer in working together, not separately.\u201d\nUnderstanding that there are emotional and philosophical factors at play in how you and your partner think about money is key to having practical, productive conversations about your finances. Cruze\u2019s advice? \u201cStop hiding, start communicating, and get on a plan together.\u201d\nBalancing Money Personalities\nRemember that old Paula Abdul tune, \u201cOpposites Attract\u201d? (You know, the one where she dances with a cartoon cat?) Well, she might have been onto something when it comes to love. And when it comes to money, opposites often do attract, like when a spender marries a saver.\nThat pairing might sound like a recipe for conflict, but Cruze said it can actually be a strength \u2014 if you approach it the right way.\n\u201cThe key is not trying to change each other but learning how to work together,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to set goals as a couple and create a budget that reflects both of your values.\u201d\nShe points to her own marriage as an example. She and her husband, Winston, include \u201cfun money\u201d in their budget so each of them has the freedom to spend a little without guilt or resentment.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all part of our shared plan,\u201d she said. \u201cRemember: You\u2019re not two individuals managing money; you\u2019re a team. And teams win when they communicate and stay focused on the same goal.\u201d\nHandling Disagreements\nCruze is quick to remind you that financial disagreements are normal in any relationship. The important thing isn\u2019t avoiding them \u2014 it\u2019s handling them with empathy and honesty.\n\u201cStart by reminding yourself: You\u2019re not enemies. You\u2019re on the same team,\u201d she said. \u201cBe willing to have those tough conversations, really listen, and try to understand where your spouse is coming from.\u201d\nCruze also recommends professional support if you\u2019re feeling stuck.\n\u201cMy friend Dr. Les Parrott says, \u2018Conflict is the price we pay for deeper intimacy.\u2019 And he\u2019s right,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes a good counselor can help too! Just don\u2019t avoid the issue. Facing it head-on with grace and honesty is what brings growth and unity in your marriage.\u201d\nBuilding Unity\nJust like regular date nights help keep the romance alive, you and your partner should also consider a monthly budget check-in to stay financially in sync.\n\u201cJust sit down, look at your income and expenses, and plan where every dollar is going for the month. It doesn\u2019t have to be stressful or super formal,\u201d she said.\nShe and Winston do this every month, and she says it gives them peace of mind and keeps them on the same page.\n\u201cWe also use the EveryDollar budgeting app, which makes it easy for both of us to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d she added.\nEveryDollar is a zero-based budgeting app designed to help individuals and couples assign a purpose to every dollar, making it a practical tool for building unity and staying organized.\n\u201cWhen you make budgeting a routine, it builds trust, reduces stress, and helps you feel like you\u2019re on the same team,\u201d Cruze said.\nBottom Line\nHappily ever after doesn\u2019t just mean candlelit dinners \u2014 it also means coming together to navigate the everyday realities of building a life together, like figuring out your budget.\nIf you follow Rachel Cruze\u2019s advice and lead with communication, create shared goals and build in regular check-ins, you might just argue less, save more and grow stronger together.\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

This will help you and your partner better understand each other\u2019s relationship with money.\u201d\nShe said the more transparency you have around money, the less room there will be for financial tension or resentment.\n\u201cRemember, it\u2019s never too late to start having open conversations about money,\u201d she added.\nTalk With Your Partner About Your Past Money Memories\nHoward said talking about past money memories should be done sooner than later.\n\u201cIt may feel awkward at first, but financial conversations are vital to healthy relationships,\u201d she explained.\nShe suggested aligning your priorities, values and budgets first, then getting into the harder topics, like your debts and credit scores.\n\u201cRestate what you hear and be open to corrections by using the phrase, \u2018What I hear you saying is \u2026 is that correct?'\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to hear new ideas when we are expecting something else. Continue the conversation with \u2018I statements\u2019 and rephrase what you hear until both people feel heard and you have an action plan.\u201d\nIf couples leave this area unaddressed, Howard said, money trauma and harmful financial habits can surface without warning and sometimes lead to financial infidelity \u2014 when one partner conceals or misleads the other about financial matters. This can include making major purchases in secret, lying about spending, hiding debt or keeping undisclosed bank accounts or balances.\nUnderstand Both of Your Money Stories Before Making Decisions\nHoward said the spending, saving and investing decisions you make today are influenced by your earliest experiences with money \u2014 also known as a \u201cmoney story.\u201d\n\u201cIn a relationship, your money story and attitude toward finances may conflict with your partner\u2019s,\u201d she explained. \u201cIf you and your partner disagree on certain money decisions, make sure you are asking each other to explain the \u2018why\u2019 behind a preferred approach.\n\u201cThis will help to understand your partner\u2019s money values, and it opens the door to having conversations about how you can support each other while fostering joy and navigating finances together.\u201d\nHoward recommended Money Roots, a free, interactive financial wellness program that\u2019s shame-free and grounded in empathy, for people who have a hard time communicating their money values or want to more successfully navigate finances with a partner.\n\u201cThese virtual, interactive workshops guide participants through difficult, vulnerable financial conversations and help people rewrite their money story and habits,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnyone can participate at their own pace and in any order.\u201d\nCreate a Values-Based Spending and Savings Plan\n\u201cThis strategy allows you to align spending and saving on the things that best reflect your values,\u201d said Howard. \u201cThe major areas should include your fixed expenses, variable expenses, savings \u2014 emergency and retirement \u2014 as well as splurges. Making space for all areas while reflecting on your values helps you spend and save with clarity.\u201d\nHoward added that there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all approach to finances. However, she said that creating a values-based spending and savings plan with your partner removes the pressure to spend on things that don\u2019t hold value and allows you to identify the purchases and experiences that bring you joy.\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re saving, spending or paying down debt, money decisions should reflect your collective goals,\u201d she said."

In one of her latest videos, financial expert Rachel Cruze recently sat down with Jefferson Fisher, a prominent personal injury lawyer and communication specialist. Cruze and Fisher explore practical strategies to break the cycle of repetitive arguments, handle conflicts with grace, and ensure that communication around money becomes a source of unity rather than discord.\n1. Break the Cycle of Repetitive Arguments\nCruze starts by addressing one of the most common conflicts in marriages\u2013repetitive arguments about money. Fisher emphasizes the importance of understanding the root cause behind these arguments. He likens it to trying to cut down a tree by trimming its leaves instead of addressing the core issue. When couples find themselves in a loop of the same financial disputes, it often indicates an underlying problem such as trust issues or unspoken fears. Fisher suggests shifting the conversation to the deeper issues at hand, focusing on building trust and addressing fears, rather than getting caught up in surface-level disagreements about joint bank accounts or budgeting.\n2. Try Effective Communication Techniques\nAs the conversation unfolds, Fisher shares valuable insights on effective communication during conflicts. He advises couples to be aware of their emotions and openly express their feelings. Fisher\u2019s key strategies include verbalizing rising frustrations, paying attention to body tension, and deliberately slowing down speech to prevent escalating tension. Cruze and Fisher highlight the importance of self-awareness and discernment in understanding not just what is said but also what is unsaid. Fisher encourages couples to grow in their ability to catch behavioral cues and engage in active listening.\n3. Deal With Different Argument Styles\nAcknowledging that people have varying argument styles, Fisher addresses the challenge of couples with different processing speeds. He shares personal experiences, highlighting that he and his wife have distinct communication styles. For those who need time and space to process internally, Fisher advises setting boundaries and scheduling dedicated times to revisit conversations. This approach ensures that both partners have the opportunity to contribute fully to the discussion, preventing rushed and incomplete responses.\n4. Set Boundaries And Respond To Disrespect\nTransitioning to a more assertive stance, Fisher offers guidance on setting and enforcing boundaries, especially when faced with disrespectful behavior. Drawing on his legal expertise, he recommends a clear and direct response when confronted with mean-spirited comments. Couples are urged to assert themselves by saying, \u201cI am not going to be spoken to that way.\u201d Fisher emphasizes that this approach is about protecting one\u2019s emotional well-being rather than attempting to control the other person.\n5. Navigate Conflicts For Personal Growth\nCruze and Fisher delve into the internal dynamics of those who unintentionally hurt others during conflicts. Fisher underscores the need for self-reflection and thorough consideration of words before speaking. He encourages individuals to empathize by putting themselves in the other person\u2019s shoes. This thoughtful pause fosters better understanding and prevents the escalation of conflicts. Fisher suggests that the work begins before opening one\u2019s mouth, focusing on both what needs to be said and how it will be received.\nThis conversation between Rachel Cruze and Jefferson Fisher unravels the complexities of handling money conflicts within relationships. Fisher\u2019s expertise in communication and negotiation provides practical strategies for couples to navigate financial disagreements successfully. From breaking the cycle of repetitive arguments to setting boundaries and fostering personal growth, the insights shared by Cruze and Fisher serve as a valuable guide for couples seeking harmony in their financial conversations.\nAs they conclude their discussion, the overarching message is clear: By understanding each other, setting boundaries, and communicating effectively, couples can take control of their money and create a life they love.\nEditor's note: This article was produced via automated technology and then fine-tuned and verified for accuracy by a member of GOBankingRates' editorial team."

Everyone has a net worth \u2014 though some are certainly higher than others \u2014 but you might be surprised to learn that you\u2019re worth more than you think. More importantly, your net worth is one of the clearest snapshots of your overall financial health.\nDr. Preston D. Cherry, a financial planner who calls himself \u201ca life designer in the world of wealth,\u201d is the founder of Concurrent Wealth Management and author of \u201cWealth in the Key of Life.\u201d He explains how to calculate your net worth, why it matters more than you might realize, and how tracking it over time can help you achieve your biggest financial goals.\nDo This Simple Math\nCalculating your net worth doesn\u2019t require any complicated technology or sifting through boxes of paperwork; it\u2019s a lot simpler than people think, Cherry said. \u201cIt\u2019s just what you own minus what you owe.\u201d To calculate your net worth:\n- Add up your assets: This includes cash, retirement and brokerage accounts, investments, your home and even business equity if you have it.\n- Then subtract your liabilities: These include credit card balances, student loans, auto loans, your mortgage or any other outstanding debts.\nA Snapshot of Your Financial Story\nOnce you calculate that number, Cherry encouraged a mindset shift: don\u2019t think of it as a static figure, but as \u201ca snapshot of your financial story.\u201d In his words, \u201cIt gives you a sense of where you are and a guide to where you\u2019re going.\u201d\nThink of your net worth as your personal financial narrative. \u201cIt tells you where you stand, how far you\u2019ve come, and your aspirational future,\u201d Cherry said. In other words, don\u2019t use it to compare yourself to others, but to measure your progress against your own goals.\nTracking your net worth regularly, such as quarterly or annually, can reveal whether you\u2019re headed in the right direction. It can also highlight blind spots, like lingering debt or underutilized savings opportunities, and bring clarity to future decision-making.\nA Reflection of Your Financial Choices\nAnother way to think of net worth, according to Cherry, is as \u201ca reflection of how your financial choices support your well-being.\u201d If your net worth is on the low side, that may show up as struggling to make ends meet or falling short of your goals.\nThe good news? You can set more aspirational goals and create concrete plans to raise your net worth. \u201cAnd when you see that number grow, you gain confidence \u2014 not just in your finances, but in your future,\u201d Cherry said.\nTake These Steps To Grow Your Net Worth\nGrowing your net worth doesn\u2019t happen on its own unless you already started with millions. Instead, Cherry suggests taking the following steps:\n- Automate and activate saving and investing: Your contributions add up with time and compound growth. Use both employer-sponsored and brokerage accounts. Also, don\u2019t be afraid to take calculated risks at opportune times.\n- Pay down high-interest debt: It might not seem as exciting as \u201cmaking money,\u201d but Cherry pointed out that it\u2019s a guaranteed return on your money.\n- Avoid both lifestyle creep and deprivation: Learn to spend intentionally so you can enjoy life while also increasing your savings as your income grows.\n- Invest in yourself: Money invested in your own education, health, skill-building or personal growth often translates into long-term financial growth.\nConsistency Is Key\nRemember that net worth isn\u2019t built overnight. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s boring,\u201d Cherry said. \u201cIt\u2019s the result of aligning your habits with your values \u2014 and doing so consistently.\u201d Over time, those daily choices can add up to financial clarity and freedom.\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.

There\u2019s no shortage of money trends out there and like fashion, they\u2019re not all good. In a recent post on the National Debt Relief blog, financial activist Dasha Kennedy highlighted three money trends your finances need you to ditch immediately.\nKeep reading to find out what these trends are and why they can be detrimental to your finances.\nImpulse Spending\nThe average consumer spent $218.75 per month on impulse buys in 2024, according to Capital One Shopping. Some people might be tempted to make impulse purchases after watching unboxing videos of viral hauls and must-have purchases, Kennedy said.\nInstead, she advised being intentional with your purchases and stopping to ask yourself if an item will add value to your life before taking your wallet out.\n\u2018Girl Math\u2019\nA play on \u201cgirl dinner,\u201d TikTok user Samantha James introduced the idea of \u201cgirl math,\u201d highlighting how she \u2014 and presumably many women\u2013 justify their spending. Her examples included purchases under $5 counting as freebies, returning a $50 item to a store, and buying another $100 item counting as a $50 purchase and when concert tickets are bought months in advance, the show is essentially free.\n\u201cWhile this trend brought laughs and relatability to money conversations, sometimes it played into the idea that some financial decisions can be oversimplified,\u201d Kennedy wrote in her blog post.\nShe said there\u2019s nothing wrong with engaging in some guilt-free spending, but you should largely focus on making value-based decisions that align with your goals.\nPositive Money Affirmations Without Meaningful Change\nUsing positive affirmations to encourage yourself to be more responsible with your money is a good thing. However, that alone won\u2019t improve your finances.\n\u201cPairing a hopeful mindset with practical habits like automating savings or tracking spending improves your chances of making real progress,\u201d wrote Kennedy.\n3 Money Moves to Make Instead\nNow that you know which money trends need to be left in the past, it\u2019s time to move forward. Kennedy shared several tips to help you do exactly that.\nLet Go of Habits That Aren\u2019t Serving You\nWhen you\u2019ve held onto certain financial habits for a while, it can be hard to give them up \u2014 even if they\u2019re not working. Doing so might make you feel like a failure, or learning new habits could feel daunting, but it\u2019s time to change that mindset.\nIf the financial habits or trends you\u2019ve grown accustomed to aren\u2019t making managing your money easier, Kennedy said it\u2019s okay to try something new.\nFocus on the Value\n\u201cLook for habits that simplify your life, reduce financial stress or bring you closer to your goals,\u201d Kennedy wrote.\nThey might take a while to produce results, but she said strategies like automating your savings or tracking your spending will likely serve you better than a trendy Band-Aid solution.\nRealize Less Can Be More\nInstead of seeking out the next trendy way to overhaul your finances, Kennedy said to stick to the basics. This includes spending less than you earn, consistently saving money, and planning.\nMore From GOBankingRates\nSources:\n- National Debt Relief, Money Trends That Were Fun, But It\u2019s Time to Move On\n- Capital One Shopping, Impulse Buying Statistics\n- TikTok, samjamessssss\n- BuzzFeed, You\u2019ve Heard Of \u201cGirl Dinner,\u201d But This TikToker Just Brought Up \u201cGirl Math\u201d And It\u2019s Probably The Most Accurate Thing I\u2019ve Ever Heard"

While taxes shouldn\u2019t be the sole focus of your investment strategy, they can take a serious chunk out of your returns if you\u2019re not careful.\nThat\u2019s why the most seasoned investors focus on advanced strategies designed to minimize their tax bill and help boost what stays in their portfolio.\nKeep more of what you earn with Betterment\u2019s tax-saving tech. You may not notice Betterment\u2019s tax-saving tech at work, but your after-tax returns will. Help minimize your tax impact and maximize your investment returns. Be a tax-smart investor. Learn more.\nIf you\u2019re a long-term investor who wants to grow your wealth the smart way, consider using these six strategies:\n1. Tax Loss Harvesting \u2014 Helps Offset Capital Gains\nThe stock market ebbs and flows. It can\u2019t be predicted. So it\u2019s inevitable that even the best portfolios will experience losses. That\u2019s where tax loss harvesting can be a smart strategy.\nTax loss harvesting is the practice of selling a security that has experienced a loss. By realizing, or \u201charvesting\u201d a loss, investors are able to offset taxes on both gains and income. The sold security is replaced by a similar one, ideally maintaining an optimal asset allocation and expected returns.\nThe losses can then be used to offset capital gains and potentially reduce ordinary income by up to $3,000 annually, with remaining losses carried forward.\nTurn market losses into potential tax wins. Betterment\u2019s automated tax tools use investment losses to help offset gains, potentially lowering your tax bill. Make the most of market dips. Learn more.\n2. Tax-Coordinated Portfolio \u2014 Make Sure You\u2019re as Tax-Efficient As Possible\nIf you\u2019re investing across different types of accounts \u2014 say a traditional IRA, Roth IRA, and a taxable brokerage account \u2014 it\u2019s wise to strategically organize your assets according to their tax efficiency. You generally want to place less tax-efficient assets in tax-advantaged accounts and more tax-efficient assets in taxable accounts.\nThe goal here is to minimize the taxes you\u2019ll pay on investment growth. But this can be complicated to do on your own.\nInvest like a tax pro. Betterment\u2019s asset location strategy is designed to improve your after-tax returns year round \u2014 helping you keep more of what you earn. Save on taxes. Learn more.\n3. Charitable Giving Made Tax-Efficient\nPlanning to give back? Donating appreciated securities can reduce your capital gains taxes and allow you to deduct the full value of the donation, assuming you itemize.\nIt\u2019s a powerful way to support causes you care about while getting a potential tax break in return.\nBottom Line\nTaking advantage of tax-smart strategies can help maximize your investment returns and keep more of your returns in your portfolio.\nYou may think about your taxes one day a year. Betterment thinks about them all year. Smarter investing starts with tax-saving tech that works all year round. Keep more of what you earn. Learn more.\nBetterment is not a tax advisor, nor should any information herein be considered tax advice. Please consult a qualified tax professional. Tax Loss Harvesting+ (TLH+) is not suitable for all investors. Consider your personal circumstances before deciding whether to utilize Betterment\u2019s TLH+ feature. Investing involves risk.

      "text": "$3 Million in Retirement Savings: Here\u2019s How Much You Could Withdraw Per Year\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nThree million dollars sounds like the kind of money that lets you spend retirement sitting on the dock of your own boat, sipping mai tais (or coffee, if that\u2019s more of your thing). But a $3 million retirement fund must be managed with the same care and consideration that you\u2019d apply to a much smaller account.\nA key part of managing your retirement savings is knowing how much you should withdraw every year. You have several options about how you\u2019ll make your withdrawals, but determining the right one for you requires some expert insight. This is why you should consult with a certified financial planner or other advisor when digging into the specifics of your retirement plans.\nFortunately, GOBankingRates connected with several experts who can offer their insights about how you can figure out withdrawal amounts that suit you and your lifestyle.\nIntroducing the 4% Rule\nThe 4% rule is an old chestnut of wisdom within the personal finance community. As Ohan Kayikchyan PhD, CFP, founder of Ohan The Money Doctor, explained, it\u2019s a form of general guidance about how much money you can withdraw each year during retirement to avoid depleting your money.\n\u201cAs the name suggests, you should withdraw 4% of total retirement savings the year you retire, adjusting the withdrawal amount annually to account for inflation,\u201d he said.\nHe added that, according to this rule, the amount you withdraw should be considered safe enough to sustain your retirement for 30 years.\n\u201cFor example, if you retire with $3 million saved, you would start withdrawing $120,000 in the first year and adjust this amount for inflation thereafter,\u201d he said.\nTo stretch your money further, Kayikchyan said you can consider withdrawing less than $120,000 annually.\n\u201cThe reverse calculation is also helpful, as the same 4% rule is used to determine how much money you need to retire. Simply divide your desired annual retirement income by 4%.\u201d\nYou Don\u2019t Always Have To Play by the Rule, Exactly\nKayikchyan noted that the 4% rule originated in the mid-\u201990s, using historical stock and bond returns data over 50 years.\n\u201cThe hypothetical portfolio used for the rule was invested 50% in stocks and 50% in bonds,\u201d he said. \u201cIn reality, your actual portfolio\u2019s asset allocation may differ, and the length of your retirement may vary, not necessarily lasting 30 years.\u201d\nAs he explained it, in a high inflationary environment, \u201cutilizing the 4% rule as a retirement withdrawal technique may not be very sound.\u201d\nElizabeth Pennington, certified financial planner (CFP) and senior associate at Fearless Finance, said that the 4% rule is often misunderstood. While you can take 4% out of your starting retirement balance, you shouldn\u2019t forget that you also have to pay taxes on any money that isn\u2019t in a Roth account.\nShe added that you should not take 4% out of your current retirement balance every year but adjust the original 4% for inflation.\n\u201cIf one person with $3 million in retirement retires into a high-inflation/low-growth market, how much they can safely spend is going to be a lot different than someone that retires into a rising market with low inflation,\u201d said Pennington. \u201cMarket context matters, and that\u2019s where it\u2019s worth consulting with a financial planner rather than relying solely on a rule of thumb.\u201d\nYou Have To Understand Your Needs\nAccording to Taylor Kovar, CFP and the founder and CEO of 11 Financial, there are a myriad of factors that can play into your decision-making around how much to take out every year.\n\u201cFactors such as life expectancy, desired lifestyle in retirement, expected investment returns, and other sources of income (such as Social Security or pensions) should be taken into consideration when determining withdrawal rates,\u201d he said.\nKovar added that since the goal of retirement withdrawals is to ensure the sustainability of retirement savings long term, retirees should try for a balance between \u201ctheir desired lifestyle in retirement and preserving their nest egg to support future needs and unexpected expenses.\u201d\nAs Anthony DeLuca, CFP and expert contributor at Annuity.org explained it, the wiser question isn\u2019t so much how much money you can withdraw, but how much you should withdraw.\n\u201cThe first step in understanding this is to build a detailed expense sheet. Understanding your needs and wants will lay the foundation and answer everything else,\u201d he said.\nTaxation Is a Factor\nWhen considering what to withdraw, DeLuca also said that you should think about the investment vehicle your nest egg is in.\n\u201cIf the assets are in a tax-deferred shell, then each withdrawal will be taxed at your income bracket,\u201d he said.\nWhile you may think that having $3 million tucked away for retirement might insulate you from worries about taxation, DeLuca said you should be cautious about withdrawing too much money in one year and causing a jump in your tax bracket.\n\u201cSecondly, if your nest egg is in an individual account, make sure that any investment sold is for a long-term capital gain, if possible. That is, investments held for more than one year,\u201d he said. \u201cThese types of capital gains are more advantageous than short-term capital gains, which are taxed at one\u2019s marginal tax bracket.\u201d\nThere Is No One-Size-Fits-All Retirement Plan\nUltimately, there\u2019s no one perfect, one-size-fits-all dollar amount or percentage to withdraw for every single retiree.\n\u201cRetirement income planning should be a dynamic, ongoing process,\u201d said Chris Urban, CFP and founder at Discovery Wealth Planning.\nWhile there are ways to model the probability of certain outcomes, Urban suggested that a better way to approach retirement income planning is to use a \u201cguardrails approach that allows you to adjust your spending capacity (aka how much you can spend in dollars) depending on factors such as age, income, investable assets, current economic environment, and legacy goals.\u201d\nGiven the intricacies of determining how much you should withdraw from any amount of retirement savings \u2014 especially an amount as large as $3 million \u2014 you should seriously consider bringing in trusted financial advisors to help you. Above all, you should be flexible.\n\u201cWhether you are managing your finances on your own or with a qualified financial professional, it is important to revisit this several times per year,\u201d Urban said."

She was recently a guest on the Who Ya Know Show by ClearPath Wealth Strategies and said many people ask her what life was like growing up in the Dave Ramsey household.\nRachel took the question in stride and explained that her parents integrated money lessons into everyday life. There weren\u2019t money lectures on Saturdays, but rather Rachel earned money for doing chores and organized the money she made into spend, save and give jars.\nRachel said that overall, her parents did a great job instilling money lessons from a young age. This has enabled her to become a money expert in her own right and the author of several personal finance books. Here are some of the top money lessons Dave Ramsey taught Rachel Cruze.\nConnect Work and Money\nRachel explained that her parents paid her a commission, not an allowance. Essentially, the Ramseys did not give their children money. Instead, the three Ramsey kids had to complete chores around the house to be paid.\nThe key is to link money to effort, which shows kids that if you want money to purchase things, you have to earn it. Rachel explained in an article on the Ramsey website that kids can complete chores as early as age two. She then listed several chore ideas kids can complete through their teenage years.\nGive Teenagers Responsibilities\nRachel said one difference between her friends and herself growing up was that her friends\u2019 parents gave them money, while Rachel had to manage her money on her own. At that point, Rachel said she had a checkbook, and her parents taught her how to balance it.\nHaving the ability to learn and make mistakes before adulthood is a great way for teenagers to practice for having more responsibility in the future. If they can learn not to spend more than they make, they\u2019ll be better equipped to manage money as adults.\nDon\u2019t Neglect Emotions Around Money\nFinally, Rachel explained that her parents also talked about the emotional side of money. They taught her about contentment and generosity. All the Ramsey children were expected to use part of their money to give to others. When you\u2019re raising kids and teaching them about money, it\u2019s important to go beyond basic budgeting lessons and investing to discuss topics like this.\nRachel wrote an article called \u201cHow Contentment Can Make You Rich.\u201d Contentment, she said, is something you choose. Jealousy and comparison to others can steal your contentment, but you can counteract it with gratitude. Being grateful for what you have and where you are can help you avoid spending unnecessarily.\nFinal Thoughts\nIn the interview clip, Rachel explained that she now has children of her own, and passes these money lessons down to them. Again, she said her parents were effective in teaching her about money because they made it a part of everyday life, and she strives to do the same with her kids today.\nMore From GOBankingRates"

      "text": "Still Paying Off Debt the \u2018Smart\u2019 Way? Dave Ramsey Says That\u2019s Exactly Why You\u2019re Stuck\nCommitment to Our Readers\nGOBankingRates' editorial team is committed to bringing you unbiased reviews and information. We use data-driven methodologies to evaluate financial products and services - our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers. You can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology.\n20 Years\nHelping You Live Richer\nReviewed\nby Experts\nTrusted by\nMillions of Readers\nQuestion #1 of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts Series\nShould I prioritize paying off my smallest debt first or the one with the highest interest?\nWhen you\u2019re staring down a mountain of debt, it\u2019s only natural to want to get to flat land as quickly as possible. You figure, why not throw everything you have financially at the debt with the highest interest rate? Then all you have to do is ride the ensuing avalanche down to the ground of financial security.\nIt sure sounds good.\nBut for Dave Ramsey, bestselling author and trusted financial advisor to millions, that attitude could be a trap \u2014 and a reason you\u2019re staying in debt longer than necessary.\nAccording to Ramsey, the smartest way out isn\u2019t the one that saves the most on interest. It\u2019s the one that builds momentum fast enough to keep you going. And that\u2019s the Debt Snowball Method \u2014 not the avalanche.\nAvalanche vs. Snowball\nOn the surface, the debt snowball method runs counter to most conventional finance advice, which argues that you should pay off the debt with the highest interest rate first, regardless of balance. That way, more of your payments go toward the principal, and you pay less in interest over time. From a strictly mathematical standpoint, it is the most efficient approach.\nBut Ramsey argues that this isn\u2019t a math problem \u2014 it\u2019s a behavior problem. And for most people, leading with logic instead of motivation is what gets them stuck.\n\u201cYou should always start with the smallest debt first, regardless of the interest rate,\u201d Ramsey told GOBankingRates. \u201cThe Debt Snowball Method works because personal finance is 80% behavior and only 20% head knowledge.\u201d\nThe snowball method flips the conventional logic on its head. You list your debts from smallest balance to largest, and make only the minimum payments on all but the very smallest one. That\u2019s the one you attack first, aggressively paying it off. Once it\u2019s paid off, you roll the money that was going towards it into the next smallest debt, building momentum as you go.\nAs each smaller debt disappears, you gain confidence, motivation \u2014 and a larger payment to put toward the next debt. That emotional traction is what Ramsey says most people are missing.\nThe Power of Progress\nRamsey stands by the snowball method because he understands that, for better or worse, emotions and ingrained behaviors influence how people handle money. And people need to feel wins early and often to stay motivated, especially when they\u2019re overwhelmed by debt.\n\u201cKnocking out that first debt gives you a quick win and builds momentum,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cOnce you see progress, you\u2019re fired up to keep going. If math was the only issue, most people wouldn\u2019t be in debt to begin with \u2014 it\u2019s about changing habits and attacking debt with intensity.\u201d\nThat\u2019s why he cautions against getting too caught up in interest rates. While avalanche math might save you money in the long term, the long term is hard to stick with if you don\u2019t see progress.\n\u201cThe snowball method works because it gives you hope,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you pay off a small debt, you feel like you can actually win \u2014 and hope is what keeps you in the game. That early success creates emotional fuel.\u201d\nWhy Avalanche Fails for Most People\nAccording to Ramsey, the avalanche method, though logical, doesn\u2019t work for most people because it takes too long to feel rewarding. That lack of progress kills people\u2019s motivation.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the problem with the avalanche \u2014 it\u2019s slow, and slow kills motivation,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is NOT actually mathematically correct if you incorporate \u2018probability of completion\u2019 in your math formula.\u201d\nThe way he sees it, the snowball method resolves one of his core issues with the avalanche method, which he considers a slow-burning motivation-killer. The most efficient plan on paper doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t finish it. And most people don\u2019t.\n\u201cHardly anyone finishes the avalanche, and millions have completed the Debt Snowball,\u201d he said. \u201cYou fix a behavior-based problem with a behavior-based solution. Paying off debt is about momentum, not math.\u201d\nBottom Line\nWhile the avalanche method might save more money on interest, it often fails where it matters most: keeping people motivated. That\u2019s why Ramsey stands by the snowball approach.\n\u201cI always recommend the Debt Snowball Method because most people need those small victories to stay engaged,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you try to lead with math instead of motivation, you risk burning out before you see real progress.\u201d\nThis article is part of GOBankingRates\u2019 Top 100 Money Experts series, where we spotlight expert answers to the biggest financial questions Americans are asking.
