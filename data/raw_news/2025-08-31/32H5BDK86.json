  "description": "A tropical wave off the west coast of Africa has a 30% chance of formulating into a cyclone over the next week, the National Hurricane Center says.",
  "content": "A tropical wave will soon emerge off the coast of Africa, slowly moving through the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center is monitoring a tropical wave that is about to emerge from the west coast of Africa, as of 8 a.m. ET on Sunday, Aug. 31. After it moves off the coast, there is about a 30% chance the wave could formulate a cyclone across the Atlantic Ocean in the next week, the center states.\n\nIf the wave were to develop into a tropical storm, it would be the seventh tropical storm of the 2025 season. The next storm name is Gabrielle, according to the National Hurricane Center's Tropical Cyclone Names list.\n\nHurricane Erin has been the only one of the 2025 season so far. The storm damaged beaches along much of the Atlantic Coast in early August. Rough surf and rip currents stirred up by its high winds and large size are blamed for the deaths of two swimmers, one in New Hampshire and one off Long Island. A boater in his 50s went missing after a vessel capsized off the Massachusetts coast on Aug. 25.\n\nThe Atlantic Ocean's hurricane season typically reaches its peak on Sept. 10, but 13 of last year's named storms formed on or after Sept. 9, including Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. The Atlantic season officially began on June 1 and will last through the end of November.\n\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\n\nA tropical wave is an inverted trough (an elongated rea of relatively low pressure) or cyclonic curvature maximum (strong point of a curved clockwise or counter-clockwise turn of wind flow) moving east to west across the tropics, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nHurricanes are born in the tropics, above warm water. Clusters of thunderstorms can develop over the ocean when water temperatures exceed 80 degrees. If conditions are right, the clusters swirl into a storm known as a tropical wave or tropical depression.\n\nA tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm once its sustained wind speeds reach 39 mph. When its winds reach 74 mph, the storm officially becomes a hurricane.\n\nDelaying potentially lifesaving preparations could mean waiting until it\u2019s too late. \"Get your disaster supplies while the shelves are still stocked, and get that insurance checkup early, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recommends.\n\u2022 Develop an evacuation plan. If you are at risk from hurricanes, you need an evacuation plan. Now is the time to begin planning where you would go and how you would get there.\n\u2022 Assemble disaster supplies. Whether you\u2019re evacuating or sheltering in place, you\u2019re going to need supplies not just to get through the storm but for a possibly lengthy aftermath, NOAA said.\n\u2022 Get an insurance checkup and document your possessions. Contact your insurance company or agent now and ask for an insurance checkup to make sure you have enough insurance to repair or even replace your home and belongings. Remember, home and renters insurance don\u2019t cover flooding, so you\u2019ll need a separate policy for those. Flood insurance is available through your company, agent or the National Flood Insurance Program. Act now, because flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period.\n\u2022 Create a family communication plan. NOAA says you should take the time now to write down a hurricane plan and share it with your family. Determine family meeting places and make sure to include an out-of-town location in case of evacuation.\n\u2022 Strengthen your home. Now is the time to improve your home\u2019s ability to withstand hurricanes. Trim trees and install storm shutters, accordion shutters, and impact glass; seal outside wall openings.\n\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY. Story idea?

      "text": "Sharks vs. hurricanes? Scientists say predators can help track huge storms.\nResearchers are looking at how sharks can help gather ocean data for improved hurricane predictions by using sharks as freely moving ocean monitors.\nIt's not a schlocky TV movie or teams in a hockey game. Sharks vs. hurricanes is real science.\nResearchers are looking at how sharks can help gather ocean data for improved hurricane predictions by using the predators as freely moving monitors by putting sensor tags on them. The goal is that the sharks will gather temperature and other data that will go toward improving hurricane forecasting \u2013 data that's challenging or expensive to get elsewhere.\n\"By attaching these tags ... to sharks, which are wide-ranging, mobile predators, we will be able to observe a much larger part of the ocean that typically remains unobserved,\" said marine ecologist Aaron Carlisle of the University of Delaware in an email to USA TODAY.\nHe said it's not so much that we can't obtain such data using other means (such as vessels or autonomous vehicles), it's that those other platforms are very expensive and are limited in where they can go. In addition, \"remote sensing via satellite-based sensors only looks at the surface, and it is what is going on below the surface that is really critical for many oceanographic/climate processes (such as hurricanes).\"\nWater temps drive hurricane formation\nAccording to Carlisle, water temperature and how it changes with depth is what drives ocean heat content, and that is generally what drives hurricanes in the Atlantic. He said salinity is important, too, but is less crucial. Indeed, according to the National Weather Service, the first condition for hurricane formation is that ocean waters must be above 79 degrees.\n\"Below this threshold temperature, hurricanes will not form or will weaken rapidly once they move over water below this threshold. Ocean temperatures in the tropical East Pacific and the tropical Atlantic routinely surpass this threshold,\" the weather service said.\nWhat species of sharks are being used?\nBlue sharks and mako sharks are two of the species best suited to carry the sensor tags because of their movement and diving characteristics.\nThis isn't the first time animals have been used in a similar way for scientific research. Marine life such as seals and narwhals have been tagged to track hard-to-reach areas in the Arctic and Antarctic, The Washington Post reports. Dolphins and whales have been used by Russia for military purposes.\nWill the data captured by the sharks be used during actual hurricanes?\n\"Our goal is to have a 'fleet' of sharks carrying these tags during the hurricane season, and they will be providing real-time oceanographic data across the North Atlantic that will be fed into various ocean models that are used to predict hurricane strength, intensity, direction, etc.,\" Carlisle said in an e-mail.\nHis team carried out tagging experiments with the sharks in May, with some success.\n\"As to whether the sharks will be in the actual hurricanes remains to be seen, but I suspect they will avoid them and won't be surfacing during hurricanes!\"\nIs the goal to have the sharks deployed this year, during the 2025 season?\nThis year, researchers are still working out bugs and are limited in the number of tags that can be deployed because of the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a huge impact on this project, Carlisle said.\n\"Our hope, if we obtain sufficient additional funding to keep things moving forward, is that we will be actually doing this type of work on a larger scale in 2026 (if lucky) or more likely 2027.\"\nFunding from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been more than satisfactory for the project, and Carlisle said \"the agency has been incredibly supportive of us throughout this process.\" The teams' partner, the Mid-Atlantic Regional Association Coastal Ocean Observing System, also has been helpful.\nAre the sharks harmed by having tags attached to them?\n\"That's a topic that we are keenly aware of in our field,\" Carlisle said. \"Attaching anything to an animal will have some impact on the animal, but we do everything in our power to minimize any negative impacts on the animal.\"\nIn addition, Carlisle and his team go through a permitting and review process that ensures they do everything they can to minimize the effect on animals. Beyond that, he said, researchers need the animals to be \"happy and healthy\" to provide the team with good data, because they are carrying expensive equipment (each tag costs about $6,000). So if the tag has too much of an effect on the animal, \"we aren't just hurting the animal but we're essentially throwing the tag away.\"\nThe tags will not be on the animals permanently: Researchers use parts that will corrode over time and allow the whole tag package to fall off."

      "text": "TROPICAL DEFINITIONS\nTropical Wave\nAn inverted trough (an elongated area of relatively low pressure) or cyclonic curvature maximum moving east to west across the tropics. These can lead to the formation of a tropical cyclone. Also known as an easterly wave.\nTropical Disturbance\nA tropical weather system with organized convection (generally 100-300 miles in diameter) originating in the tropics or subtropics, having a non-frontal migratory character and maintaining its identity for 24 hours or longer. It may or may not be associated with a detectable perturbation of the wind field.\nTropical Cyclone\nA warm-core non-frontal synoptic-scale cyclone, originating over tropical or subtropical waters, with organized deep convection and a closed surface wind circulation about a well-defined center. Once formed, a tropical cyclone is maintained by the extraction of heat energy from the ocean at high temperature and heat export at the low temperatures of the upper troposphere. In this they differ from extratropical cyclones, which derive their energy from horizontal temperature contrasts in the atmosphere (baroclinic effects).\nPotential Tropical Cyclone (PTC)\nA term used in NWS advisory products to describe a disturbance that is not yet a tropical cyclone, BUT which poses the threat of bringing tropical storm or hurricane conditions to land areas within 48 hours.\nInvest\nA weather system for which a tropical cyclone forecast center (NHC, CPHC, or JTWC) is interested in collecting specialized data sets and/or running model guidance. The designation of a system as an invest does not correspond to any particular likelihood of development of the system into a tropical cyclone.\nExtratropical Cyclone\nA cyclone (of any intensity) for which the primary energy source is baroclinic (i.e., results from the temperature contrast between warm & cold air masses).\nPost-Tropical Cyclone\nA cyclone that no longer possesses sufficient tropical characteristics to be considered a tropical cyclone. Post-tropical cyclones can continue to carry heavy rains and high winds. Note: former tropical cyclones that become extratropical and remnant lows are 2 specific classes of post-tropical cyclones.\nRemnant Low\nA post-tropical cyclone that no longer possesses the convective organization required of a tropical cyclone and has maximum sustained winds of less than 34 knots.\nSubtropical Cyclone\nA non-frontal low pressure system that has characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones. Subtropical cyclones originate over tropical or subtropical waters and have a closed circulation about a well-defined center. In comparison to tropical cyclones, the maximum winds occur relatively far from the center (greater than 60 nautical miles) and have a less symmetric wind field and distribution of convection.\nTropical Depression\nA tropical cyclone that has maximum sustained surface winds (one-minute average) of 38 mph (33 knots) or less.\nTropical Storm\nA tropical cyclone that has maximum sustained surface winds ranging from 39-73 mph (34 to 63 knots).\nHurricane\nA hurricane is a tropical cyclone that has maximum sustained surface winds of 74 mph or greater (64 knots or greater).\nMajor Hurricane\nA hurricane that is classified as Category 3 or higher.\nNOTE: The number of Tropical Storms and Hurricanes increases substantially in August, peaks in mid-September and decreases towards a minimum by early November.\nEye Wall\nAn organized band of cumulonimbus clouds immediately surrounding the center of the tropical cyclone.\nRapid Intensification\nAn increase in the maximum sustained winds of a tropical cyclone of at least 30 knots in a 24 hour period.\nLandfall\nThe intersection of the surface center of a tropical cyclone with a coastline. Because the strongest winds in a tropical cyclone are not located precisely at the center, it is possible for a cyclone's strongest winds to be experienced over land even if landfall does not occur. Similarly, it is possible for a tropical cyclone to make landfall and have its strongest winds remain over the water.\nStorm Surge\nAn abnormal rise in sea level accompanying a tropical cyclone. This is the difference in height between observed level of the sea surface and the level that would have occurred in the absence of the storm. Storm surge is usually estimated by subtracting the normal or astronomical tide from the observed storm tide.\nStorm Tide\nThe actual level of sea water resulting from the astronomic tide combined with the storm surge.\nInundation\nThe flooding of normally dry land, primarily caused by events along the coasts, estuaries, and adjoining rivers. The winds drive large waves and storm surge on shore, and heavy rains raise rivers.\nTropical Storm Watch\nA Tropical Storm Watch is issued when Tropical Storm conditions, including winds of 39-73 mph, pose a POSSIBLE threat to a specified coastal area within 48 hours.\nTropical Storm Warning\nA Tropical Storm Warning is issued when Tropical Storm conditions, including winds of 39-73 mph, are EXPECTED in a specified coastal area within 36 hours or less.\nHurricane Watch\nA Hurricane Watch is issued when sustained winds of 74 mph or higher are POSSIBLE within the specified area of the Watch. Because hurricane preparedness activities become difficult once winds reach tropical storm force, the Watch is issued 48 hours in advance of the onset of tropical storm force winds.\nHurricane Warning\nA Hurricane Warning is issued when sustained winds of 74 mph or higher are EXPECTED somewhere within the specified area of the Warning. Because hurricane preparedness activities become difficult once winds reach tropical storm force, the Warning is issued 36 hours in advance of the onset of tropical storm force winds.\nNOTE: A Hurricane Warning can remain in effect when dangerously high water or a combination of dangerously high water and exceptionally high waves continues...even if the winds have subsided below hurricane intensity.\nExtreme Wind Warning\nExtreme Wind Warning (EWW) is issued for sustained surface winds of 115 mph or greater from a MAJOR Hurricane (Category 3, 4, or 5) are expected within the next hour. This is usually associated with the eyewall of a major hurricane and is considered your final call to shelter in place.\nStorm Surge Watch\nThe POSSIBILITY of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the shoreline somewhere within the specified area, generally within 48 hours, in association with an ongoing or potential tropical cyclones, a subtropical cyclone or a post-tropical cyclone. The watch may be issued earlier when other conditions, such as the onset of tropical-storm-force winds are expected to limit the time available to take protective actions for surge (e.g., evacuations). The warning may also be issued for locations not expected to receive life-threatening inundation but which could potentially be isolated by inundation in adjacent areas.\nStorm Surge Warning\nThe DANGER of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the shoreline somewhere within the specified area, generally within 36 hours, in association with an ongoing or potential tropical cyclones, a subtropical cyclone or a post-tropical cyclone. The warning may be issued earlier when other conditions, such as the onset of tropical storm force winds are expected to limit the time available to take protective actions for surge (e.g., evacuations). The warning may also be issued for locations not expected to receive life-threatening inundation but which could potentially be isolated by inundation in adjacent areas."

      "text": "How a distant hurricane likely killed 2 people\nThe massive Hurricane Erin roughed up the sea and surf, causing rip currents expected to be blamed for two rip deaths in the United States.\nAt least two deaths in the mainland United States are expected to be attributed to rough surf conditions as Hurricane Erin moved away from the coast, and police continue searching for a person missing from a capsized vessel in Maine.\nA 59-year-old swimmer drowned in New York, and a 17-year-old boy was swept away in a strong current in New Hampshire, authorities said.\nThe weekend deaths mark at least 69 surf zone fatalities in the United States this year, according to the National Weather Service.\nIn the days ahead of Hurricane Erin's arrival along the Atlantic Coast, Michael Brennan, director of the National Hurricane Center, pleaded with people to use caution in the surf. The late-summer weather may seem ideal for a beach trip, but rip current fatalities tend to occur in these conditions, Brennan warned people on Aug. 16 to heed warnings and stay close to lifeguards.\nMany beaches along the U.S. Atlantic Coast were closed last week as the massive and powerful hurricane passed a few hundred miles offshore and stirred up big waves and rough surf.\nTeen dies in New Hampshire\nWitnesses said a teen and his father, 61, were swept away on Aug. 24 in a strong current at Hampton Beach, according to New Hampshire State Police, who are conducting an investigation.\nThe teen had been swimming with family members at about 6:45 p.m., when he was pulled away from shore by a strong ocean current, reported Seacoastonline, a USA TODAY Network property. The boy\u2019s father went into the water to try to rescue his son, but also became distressed.\nState Beach Patrol lifeguards were off duty at the time of the incident, but were called back to the scene and brought the boy and his father to shore and began lifesaving efforts, according to the state police. The teen and his father were taken to the hospital. The name of the teen was withheld because he was a minor.\nA high surf advisory, for the swells and rip currents caused by Hurricane Erin, was in effect at beaches on Aug. 24, meteorologist Stephen Baron, with the National Weather Service office in Gray, Maine, confirmed to USA TODAY.\nSouth Carolina man dies in New York\nOn Aug. 23 in New York, Ishmoile Mohammed, 59, of South Carolina, was swimming in the ocean at Sailors Haven in Fire Island National Seashore when he was caught in a rip current, according to Suffolk County Police.\nLifeguards pulled Mohammed from the water and rendered aid with the assistance of National Park Service employees. Mohammed was airlifted to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\nA rip current advisory was in effect along the New York coast. The weather service office in New York City warned on Aug. 24 at 3:49 p.m. of \"life-threatening swimming and surfing conditions and localized beach erosion.\"\nOcean often deadly when hurricanes are offshore\nThe National Hurricane Center, along with other weather service offices, has worked to raise awareness of the life-threatening hazards from rip currents and strong surf. The parent agency of the weather service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, launched a new effort this summer, with the slogan \"Know Your Blue IQ.\"\nBetween 2013 and 2022, 15% of all direct hurricane fatalities in the United States were attributed to hazardous surf and rip current conditions, the weather service and hurricane center found in a study released in 2023. An additional 3% of deaths were attributed to offshore marine incidents.\nBoater missing after incident in Erin's rough waters\nAuthorities in Massachusetts continued their third day of searching on Aug. 25 for a man in his 50s who remained missing following a boating incident on Aug. 23, said the Massachusetts State Police. The state police, the Massachusetts Environmental Police and the U.S. Coast Guard searched for the missing boater. Names have not been released for the missing man or the person rescued after the incident.\n\"We remain focused on reuniting the missing person with his loved ones,\" the state police said late Sunday. \"Despite challenging weather and sea conditions, including 6-8\u2019 swells, Troopers and Coast Guardsman performed sonar scans, dives, surface and aerial patrols\" on Sunday, Aug. 24. A state police marine unit with divers continued searching on Monday, Aug. 25. While the boater wasn't located, the team found evidence of the vessel's wreckage, police said.\nSwimmers rescued in Maryland\nElsewhere along the Atlantic Coast over the weekend, lifeguards rescued three girls in Ocean City, Maryland, on Aug. 22 after they were caught up in a rip current.\n\"This is why we restrict swimming and wading,\" Captain Butch Arbin with Ocean City Beach Patrol said, in a message on the patrol's Facebook page.\nWhile water access was restricted to ankle depth, three girls headed into the ocean between lifeguard stands, Arbin said. As a surf rescue technician attempted to move them in closer to shore, a wave broke, knocking them down and a rip current began pulling them out to deeper water, Arbin said. An inexperienced surfer was also rescued that day, he added. The three girls later visited the department's headquarters to offer letters of thanks.\nContributing: USA TODAY Network, including Keith Demko with the Salisbury Times, and Angeljean Chiaramida at Seacoastonline.\nDinah Voyles Pulver, a national correspondent for USA TODAY, writes about climate change, violent weather and other news.

      "text": "Hurricane names listed for 2025 Atlantic season\nThe 2025 Atlantic hurricane season starts June 1, but we already know what all the storms will be named.\nThe list of storm names is created by the World Meteorological Organization well in advance of the hurricane season. But we don't yet know how many storms will form this year, or how strong they will be.\nCould there be a Tropical Storm Andrea, or perhaps a Hurricane Karen in our future? How about Tropical Depression Jerry?\nHow bad will the 2025 hurricane season be? It's too soon to say for sure, but forecasters have started the year with some good news.\nA tropical storm gets a name when its sustained winds reach 39 mph; it becomes a hurricane when its winds reach 74 mph.\nA typical Atlantic hurricane season averages about 14 tropical storms, seven of which spin into hurricanes, based on weather records that date from 1991 to 2020.\nForecasts about the predicted severity of the 2025 hurricane season will be coming out in the weeks and months ahead from private, university and government groups.\nHere is the list of names for the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season\nThe names are given out in alphabetical order, and each new storm gets the next name on the list. There are no Q, U, X, Y, or Z names because of the lack of names that begin with those letters.\nHow bad will the 2025 hurricane season be? It's too soon to say for sure, but forecasters have started the year with some good news.\nHere's how to pronounce all of the 2025 hurricane names.\n\u25feAndrea\n\u25feBarry\n\u25feChantal\n\u25feDexter\n\u25feErin\n\u25feFernand\n\u25feGabrielle\n\u25feHumberto\n\u25feImelda\n\u25feJerry\n\u25feKaren\n\u25feLorenzo\n\u25feMelissa\n\u25feNestor\n\u25feOlga\n\u25fePablo\n\u25feRebekah\n\u25feSebastien\n\u25feTanya\n\u25feVan\n\u25feWendy\nEastern Pacific hurricane names\nThere is a separate list of tropical storms and hurricanes that form in the eastern Pacific Ocean:\n\u25feAlvin\n\u25feBarbara\n\u25feCosme\n\u25feDalila\n\u25feErick\n\u25feFlossie\n\u25feGil\n\u25feHenriette\n\u25feIvo\n\u25feJuliette\n\u25feKiko\n\u25feLorena\n\u25feMario\n\u25feNarda\n\u25feOctave\n\u25fePriscilla\n\u25feRaymond\n\u25feSonia\n\u25feTico\n\u25feVelma\n\u25feWallis\n\u25feXina\n\u25feYork\n\u25feZelda\nEastern Pacific hurricanes seldom have any direct impact on the U.S., though Hilary did wreak havoc across portions of California and the Southwest in 2023. The eastern Pacific season begins on May 15, more than two weeks earlier than the Atlantic season.\nThere is also a separate list of names for Central Pacific hurricanes, which can occasionally hit or impact Hawaii. In addition, there are separate lists for typhoons in the western Pacific and tropical cyclones in Australia and the Indian Ocean.\nWhy \u2013 and how \u2013 do hurricanes get names?\nBefore hurricane forecasters started naming storms, they had to refer to storms by saying something like \"the storm 500 miles east-southeast of Miami.\" But six hours later, the storm's position would change.\nAlso, when more than one storm was going on at the same time, making it clear which storm was being described made the job even harder.\nHow bad will the 2025 hurricane season be? It's too soon to say for sure, but forecasters have started the year with some good news.\nIn 1953, the U.S. began using female names for hurricanes. By 1979, male and female names were being used. The names alternate between male and female.\nThe World Meteorological Organization, based in Geneva, chooses hurricane names several years in advance, based on strict criteria. If a hurricane is particularly deadly or costly, its name is \"retired\" by the WMO and replaced by another one."

      "text": "Will a hurricane impact your state in 2025? A final forecast has been released.\nTop experts from Colorado State University are still maintaining their prediction of a slightly above-average season.\nTop experts from Colorado State University released their final planned forecast for the Atlantic hurricane season on Aug. 6, including a state-by-state look at upcoming hurricane risk.\nOverall, the outlook maintains a prediction of a slightly above-average season of 8 hurricanes, and 3 major hurricanes. A major hurricane has wind speeds of at least 111 mph.\nA \"normal\" year sees 14 named storms, of which seven become hurricanes.\n\"We're keeping the forecast the same as what we predicted in early July\" (16 named storms of which 8 become hurricanes), Colorado State meteorologist Phil Klotzbach told USA TODAY. This includes the four storms that have already formed.\nThe news comes as August brings a pivot point in hurricane season and increased tropical activity in the Atlantic.\nTropical Atlantic is now warm enough for hurricanes\nAccording to the updated forecast, the tropical Atlantic has warmed faster than normal over the past few weeks. \"When the waters in the tropical Atlantic and Caribbean Sea are warmer than normal, it tends to favor an above-average season, since a hurricane\u2019s fuel source is warm ocean water. Additionally, a warm Atlantic leads to lower atmospheric pressure and a more unstable atmosphere. Both conditions favor hurricane formation,\" the forecast said.\n\"Water temperatures are pretty much warm enough everywhere in the tropical Atlantic to support hurricane formation,\" Klotzbach told USA TODAY.\nIn addition, the Colorado State team anticipates \"a slightly above-average probability for major hurricanes making landfall along the continental United States coastline and in the Caribbean for the remainder of the hurricane season.\"\nHurricane risk by state\nThe updated forecast includes a state-by-state look at hurricane risk. Those calculations predict the chances of a storm passing within 50 miles of the state.\nPer usual, the highest risk is in Florida, which faces an 89% chance of being impacted by a tropical storm and a 61% chance of being impacted by a hurricane.\nWill your state be impacted by a hurricane? Here's what to know about the risk in 2025, according to the new outlook:\nWill a hurricane impact Alabama in 2025?\nIn Alabama, there's a 63% storm chance and a 31% hurricane chance. There is also a 9% chance of a major hurricane tracking within 50 miles of Alabama, according to CSU experts.\nWill a hurricane impact Connecticut in 2025?\nThere is a 25% storm chance and 9% hurricane chance in Connecticut.\nWill a hurricane impact Delaware in 2025?\nThere is a 25% storm chance and 7% hurricane chance in Delaware.\nWill a hurricane impact Florida in 2025?\nIn Florida, there is an 89% storm chance and a 61% hurricane chance. There is also a 32% chance of a major hurricane tracking within 50 miles of the state.\nWill a hurricane impact Georgia in 2025?\nThere is a 68% storm chance and a 34% hurricane chance in Georgia.\nWill a hurricane impact Louisiana in 2025?\nIn Louisiana, there is a 71% storm chance and a 43% hurricane chance. There is also a 16% chance of a major hurricane tracking within 50 miles of Louisiana.\nWill a hurricane impact Maine in 2025?\nIn Maine, there is a 24% storm chance and 8% hurricane chance.\nWill a hurricane impact Maryland in 2025?\nIn Maryland, there is a 35% storm chance and 12% hurricane chance.\nWill a hurricane impact Massachusetts in 2025?\nThere is a 37% storm chance and a 16% hurricane chance in Massachusetts.\nWill a hurricane impact Mississippi in 2025?\nThere is a 58% storm chance and a 32% hurricane chance in Mississippi.\nWill a hurricane impact New Hampshire in 2025?\nIn New Hampshire, there is a 20% storm chance and 6% hurricane chance.\nWill a hurricane impact New Jersey in 2025?\nIn New Jersey, there is a 25% storm chance and 8% hurricane chance.\nWill a hurricane impact New York in 2025?\nThere is a 30% storm chance and an 11% hurricane chance in New York.\nWill a hurricane impact North Carolina in 2025?\nThere is a 73% storm chance and a 43% hurricane chance in North Carolina.\nWill a hurricane impact Rhode Island in 2025?\nThere is a 23% storm chance and 9% hurricane chance in Rhode Island.\nWill a hurricane impact South Carolina in 2025?\nIn South Carolina, there is a 62% storm chance and a 32% hurricane chance.\nWill a hurricane impact Texas in 2025?\nIn Texas, there is a 66% storm chance and 41% hurricane chance, as well as an 18% chance of a major hurricane tracking within 50 miles of the state.\nWill a hurricane impact Virginia in 2025?\nThere is a 50% storm chance and a 22% hurricane chance in Virginia.\nWhen is the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season?\nHurricane season officially began June 1. The six-month season lasts until Nov. 30.\nWill a major hurricane make landfall in the US in 2025?\nColorado State researchers said there's a 48% chance of a major hurricane making landfall somewhere along the U.S. coastline. The average, based on records from 1880 to 2020, is 43%.\nThe chances for a landfall are greater along the Gulf Coast (31%) than they are along the East Coast (25%).\n(This story has been updated to add new information)."

      "text": "What does fierce Hurricane Erin mean for the rest of the season?\nHurricane Erin, the first of the Atlantic season, briefly reached Catagory 5 status. What does the intense storm mean for the rest of the 2025?\nHurricane Erin, a major storm that is forecast to churn offshore of the East Coast of the United States for the next several days, briefly attained Category 5 status on Aug. 16 as it intensified in the Atlantic.\nCategory 5 hurricanes are the rarest of storms, with only a small fraction of all tropical cyclones reaching that intense wind speed of 157 mph or more.\nCould this Category 5 storm \u2013 among the earliest on record \u2013 be a harbinger of a potentially catastrophic season to come? USA TODAY reached out to experts for their take on the question.\nIs Erin a sign of a potentially catastrophic hurricane season to come?\n\u201cErin's rapid intensification to Cat 5 does not mean potentially more Cat 5 hurricanes this year,\" said Yonggang Liu, an associate professor of physical oceanography at the University of South Florida and director of its Ocean Circulation Lab.\nColorado State University research scientist Levi Silvers, in an e-mail to USA TODAY, said that Erin's Cat 5 status doesn't affect the forecast for the rest of the season overall.\n\"Based on the atmospheric conditions and warm sea-surface temperature we do expect an above-average season. This includes a forecast of additional major hurricanes,\" he said. \"The rapid intensification of Erin to a Category 5 hurricane was a bit startling to see, but it does not change our forecast.\"\nDan Brown, branch chief of the hurricane specialists at the National Hurricane Center, shared similar thoughts with USA TODAY: \"There is little correlation between the occurrence of a Category 5 hurricane and the overall activity of the season.\"\nBrown pointed to two previous seasons for comparison.\n\"In 1992, the first hurricane of the season was Category 5 Hurricane Andrew, but that storm was the only major hurricane in the Atlantic basin that year and only seven named storms formed overall,\" he said. \"In contrast, during the 2024 hurricane season, Beryl became a Category 5 hurricane in July and four additional major hurricanes formed that year with a total of 18 named storms.\"\nThe most recent Colorado State University forecast, released earlier in August, calls for a total of a total of eight hurricanes in 2025, of which three are predicted to be major. Based on that forecast, seven hurricanes could still be expected to form in the remainder of 2025, of which two could be major.\nSilvers also clarified the definition of a \"catastrophic season.\"\n\"Unfortunately, it only takes one intense hurricane making landfall in a vulnerable region to result in a catastrophic season,\" he said. \"Fortunately, Erin is not forecast to make landfall.\"\nBrown agreed, saying \"the most important lesson is to remember it only takes one hurricane to affect you for it to be a bad year where you live.\"\n\"As we approach the peak of the hurricane season, now is the time to find out if you live in an evacuation zone and make sure you have a hurricane plan in place,\" Brown said.\nIs there any correlation between Cat 5s in August and activity in the remainder of the season?\nSilvers said he's \"not aware of a correlation between Category 5s in August and later season activity.\" But he added: \"Since we still have not reached the climatological peak of the hurricane season, we do expect a lot of further activity.\"\nThe climatological peak of the season is usually around Sept. 10, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nOverall, Silvers concluded that \"one of the difficulties with this type of correlation is the small number of Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes that occur in August. They are certainly not unprecedented, but they are rare, and this makes calculating robust statistical relationships difficult.\"\nHow fast did Hurricane Erin intensify?\nHurricane Erin's wind speeds rocketed Aug. 16. Erin, the fifth named storm of this season, quickly exceeded expectations after undergoing a period of strengthening the hurricane center refers to as \"rapid intensification.\"\nErin's burst of intensification will be among the most rapid ever recorded in the Atlantic Ocean.\nIts winds increased 45 mph in just 12 hours overnight on Friday, Aug. 15, from 75 mph to 120 mph. Ultimately, its wind speeds increased a total of 80 mph in just 18 hours.\nHurricane Milton last year surpassed that mark. In a postseason summary of the 2024 hurricane season, NOAA reported Milton's rate of intensification \u2013 90 mph in 24 hours in October 2024 \u2013 was \"among the highest ever observed.\"\nAt least two other hurricanes have exceeded that increase. In 2005, Hurricane Wilma's winds increased 125 mph in 24 hours. In 2007, wind speeds in Hurricane Felix increased by 100 mph in 24 hours.\nHow common are Cat 5s?\nNOAA's database shows slightly more than 40 hurricanes on record have reached wind speeds of 157 mph or more, the minimum threshold for a Category 5 hurricane. However, records show there has been at least one Category 5 hurricane every year since 2022.\nErin became the 11th Category 5 hurricane recorded in the Atlantic since 2016. That is 11 in just nine years, according to University of Oklahoma student and hurricane mapmaker Michael Ferragamo.\nThat's the highest number of Cat 5 hurricanes recorded in a nine-year timeframe on record in a comprehensive database compiled by federal researchers, including the Hurricane Research Division of NOAA's Atlantic and Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory. The database, which dates to 1851, is supported by decades of research into storm records, including ships logs and other historical accounts from the 19th century.\nBy decade, there have been eight Category 5 hurricanes in the Atlantic during the first two decades of this century. There have been five since 2020. Before this century, the greatest number of Cat 5s occurred in the 1930s, when there were six, and the 1960s, when there were five.\nOcean temperatures can contribute to storm strength\nOcean temperatures \u2013 at the surface and below the surface \u2013 can contribute to the rapid intensification of storms, the experts said.\nRecent ocean data indicates Erin may be getting fuel from subsurface temperatures in the ocean, Liu said. \"Subsurface ocean temperature information is critical,\" he added.\nThe latest data indicates temperatures are climbing in the upper layer of the ocean and at the surface.\nThe heat content in the upper layer of the ocean in the main region of the Atlantic where hurricanes develop is lower than at this time last year, but still warmer than normal.\nSea surface temperatures also have warmed in mid-August.\n(This story has been updated to add new information.)\nUSA TODAY journalists Doyle Rice and Dinah Voyles Pulver have covered hurricanes and other violent weather for decades.

      "text": "Prepare now for hurricanes, Trump warns. Here's what you should do.\nNOAA says the best time to prepare for oncoming storms is now \u2013 well before the official start of Hurricane season.\nNational Hurricane Preparedness Week was designated by President Donald Trump on May 5, a reminder that deadly hurricanes will soon be brewing.\nThe Atlantic Hurricane season starts June 1. Presidents dating back to at least George W. Bush have issued proclamations about the preparedness week tradition, which warns of danger ahead.\nAccording to Trump's latest proclamation, this is \"a time to raise awareness about the dangers of these storms and encourage citizens in coastal areas and inland communities to be vigilant in emergency planning and preparation.\"Yet another active year is predicted, with as many as 17 named storms possible, according to a forecast from Colorado State University experts.\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) says the best time to prepare for oncoming storms is now \u2013 well before the official start of the season. \"Take action TODAY to be better prepared for when the worst happens. Understand your risk from hurricanes, and begin pre-season preparations now.\"\nDelaying potentially life-saving preparations could mean waiting until it\u2019s too late. \"Get your disaster supplies while the shelves are still stocked, and get that insurance checkup early, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period,\" NOAA recommends.\nHere are five things you should do now:\n1. Develop an evacuation plan\nIf you are at risk from hurricanes, you need an evacuation plan. Now is the time to begin planning where you would go and how you would get there.\nYou do not need to travel hundreds of miles. Your destination could be a friend or relative who lives in a well-built home outside flood prone areas. Plan several routes and be sure to account for your pets.\n2. Assemble disaster supplies\nWhether you\u2019re evacuating or sheltering-in-place, you\u2019re going to need supplies not just to get through the storm but for the potentially lengthy aftermath, NOAA said.\nHave enough non-perishable food, water and medicine to last each person in your family a minimum of three days (store a longer than 3-day supply of water, if possible). Electricity and water could be out for weeks. You\u2019ll need extra cash, a battery-powered radio and flashlights. You may need a portable crank or solar-powered USB charger for your cell phones. And lastly, don\u2019t forget your pets!\n3. Get an insurance checkup and document your possessions\nContact your insurance company or agent now and ask for an insurance check-up to make sure you have enough insurance to repair or even replace your home and/or belongings. Remember, home and renters insurance doesn\u2019t cover flooding, so you\u2019ll need a separate policy for it. Flood insurance is available through your company, agent, or the National Flood Insurance Program. Act now, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period.\nAlso take the time before hurricane season begins to document your possessions: photos, serial numbers, or anything else that you may need to provide your insurance company when filing a claim.\n4. Create a family communication plan\nNOAA said to take the time now to write down your hurricane plan, and share it with your family. Determine family meeting places, and make sure to include an out-of-town location in case of evacuation.\nWrite down on paper a list of emergency contacts, and make sure to include utilities and other critical services \u2013 remember, the Internet may not be accessible during or after a storm.\n5. Strengthen your home\nNow is the time to improve your home\u2019s ability to withstand hurricane impacts. Trim trees; install storm shutters, accordion shutters, and/or impact glass; seal outside wall openings.\nRemember, the garage door is the most vulnerable part of the home, so it must be able to withstand hurricane-force winds. Many retrofits are not as costly or time consuming as you may think, NOAA said.\nIf you\u2019re a renter, work with your landlord now to prepare for a storm.\nAnd remember \u2013 now is the time to purchase the proper plywood, steel or aluminum panels to have on hand if you need to board up the windows and doors ahead of an approaching storm."

      "text": "Weakened Hurricane Erin heads away from US, leaving flooding along East Coast\nAs Hurricane Erin moves away from the East Coast on Aug. 22, it leaves behind flooded-out and sand-covered roads, eroded beaches and dangerous waters for beachgoers.\nSome of the hardest hit areas were along the Outer Banks barrier islands of North Carolina, where waves crashed into beachfront homes and made a major road impassable. A state of emergency was also declared in New Jersey on Aug. 21 in preparation for flood impacts and high winds as Erin made its up the coast out at sea.\nDozens of people had to be rescued from stranded vehicles and restaurants as floodwaters rose in Margate City on the Jersey Shore, authorities there said the evening of Aug. 21.\nErin made a turn to the northeast and was finally moving away from the United States as a weakened Category 1 hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm passed as close as about 200 miles from the North Carolina coast.\nThough Erin has weakened, dangerous surf conditions and rip currents remain a threat at beaches along much of the East Coast, forecasters said.\n\u201cIt may seem like a nice beach day, with sunshine and blue skies as the storm goes out to sea, but powerful rip currents will be lurking in the water through Saturday,\" AccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva said.\n50 people, 3 dogs rescued from Hurricane Erin floodwaters in NJ\nPhotos from Margate City, New Jersey, show cars stuck on roads covered in water and people standing in ankle-to-calf-deep floodwaters.\nThe Margate City Fire Department said in a late Aug. 21 update that it rescued 50 people and three dogs. Sixteen people and the dogs were rescued from vehicles, and 34 people were rescued from two restaurants that were flooded.\nThe department was also busy dealing with a gas leak, a transformer fire and an electrical fire at a business during the height of Erin's flooding.\nHurricane Erin produces coastal flooding in the East\nOn the Outer Banks, at a gauge on the beach at Duck, North Carolina, the National Weather Service said the high water level at high tide on Aug. 21 reached 6.97 inches. The water level was about 9 inches below the previous record, set in 2003 during Hurricane Isabel.\nRoads in the Outer Banks between Oregon Inlet and Ocracoke are expected to remain impassable, especially during morning and evening times of high tide, the weather service in Newport and Morehead City, North Carolina, said on Aug. 22. Damaged dune structures and large swells will contribute to continued flooding, the weather service said.\nHighway 12, a crucial artery in the Outer Banks, has already experienced additional dune breaches during high tide the morning of Aug. 22, the North Carolina Department of Transportation said. Portions of the highway remain closed, but there is so far no indication of pavement damage, the department said.\nIn New Jersey, coastal flooding closed U.S. 40 in both directions in Pleasantville, near Atlantic City, the weather service said on Aug. 21. Flooding also closed lanes of a road in North Wildwood, New Jersey. And in Ocean City, flooding began in coastal areas before high tide arrived, flooding 8th and 9th streets near the boardwalk.\nIn Delaware, the water washed over the tops of dunes and caused some beach erosion on the north side of Indian River Inlet in Sussex, according to the weather service.\nRip currents remain a dangerous threat at East Coast beaches\nThe rip current risk remains high along much of the East Coast, and the hurricane center said swimming is likely to continue to be dangerous for the next couple days.\n\u201cEven as Erin pushes out into the open Atlantic, dangerous conditions are expected at many beaches heading into the weekend. Do not let your guard down if you\u2019re spending time at the beach on Friday or Saturday,\u201d DaSilva said.\nRip currents accounted for about 10 to 15% of all fatalities from tropical storms or hurricanes in the U.S. in the last decade, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The fast-moving channels of water can drag swimmers away from shore and tire them out.\nBeaches in several East Coast states including North Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey, and others remained closed to swimmers on Aug. 22.\nMore in store in the tropics\nErin's departure may not mean a break in tropical impacts to the U.S. for very long. Hurricane forecasters are eyeing three developing systems in the Atlantic, including a developing tropical wave that could become the next named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season, Fernand.\nThat system has an 80% chance of cyclone formation within a week and a 70% chance of formation in the next 48 hours, the hurricane center said. It's currently located a couple hundred miles away from the northern Leeward Islands. It's likely to form into a tropical depression over the weekend, and if the depression's winds reach 39 mph, it would be the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season.\nIt's too soon to determine if it'll impact the U.S. Forecasters said it could turn northwestward and then northward.\nContributing: Doyle Rice, Dinah Voyles Pulver, Thao Nguyen and Jorge L.

They are now maintained and updated through a strict procedure by an international committee of the World Meteorological Organization.\nThe six lists above are used in rotation and re-cycled every six years, i.e., the 2023 list will be used again in 2029. The only time that there is a change in the list is if a storm is so deadly or costly that the future use of its name for a different storm would be inappropriate for reasons of sensitivity. If that occurs, then at an annual meeting by the WMO committee (called primarily to discuss many other issues) the offending name is stricken from the list and another name is selected to replace it. Several names have been retired since the lists were created. Here is more information on the history of naming tropical cyclones and retired names.\nIf a storm forms during the off-season, it will take the next name in the list based on the current calendar date. For example, if a tropical cyclone formed on December 28th, it would take the name from the previous season's list of names. If a storm formed in February, it would be named from the subsequent season's list of names.\nIn the event that more than twenty-one named tropical cyclones occur in the Atlantic basin in a season, any additional storms will take names from an alternate list of names approved by the WMO. Here are the pronunciation guides for the Atlantic basin.\nCan I have a tropical cyclone named for me?\nEastern North Pacific Names\nEastern North Pacific Pronunciation Guide (PDF)\n| 2025 | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|\nAlvin Barbara Cosme Dalila Erick Flossie Gil Henriette Ivo Juliette Kiko Lorena Mario Narda Octave Priscilla Raymond Sonia Tico Velma Wallis Xina York Zelda |\nAmanda Boris Cristina Douglas Elida Fausto Genevieve Hernan Iselle Julio Karina Lowell Marie Norbert Odalys Polo Rachel Simon Trudy Vance Winnie Xavier Yolanda Zeke |\nAndres Blanca Carlos Dolores Enrique Felicia Guillermo Hilda Ignacio Jimena Kevin Linda Marty Nora Olaf Pamela Rick Sandra Terry Vivian Waldo Xina York Zelda |\nAgatha Blas Celia Darby Estelle Frank Georgette Howard Ivette Javier Kay Lester Madeline Newton Orlene Paine Roslyn Seymour Tina Virgil Winifred Xavier Yolanda Zeke |\nAdrian Beatriz Calvin Debora Eugene Fernanda Greg Hilary Irwin Jova Kenneth Lidia Max Norma Otilio Pilar Ramon Selma Todd Veronica Wiley Xina York Zelda |\nAletta Bud Carlotta Daniel Emilia Fabio Gilma Hector Ileana Jake Kristy Lane Miriam Norman Olivia Paul Rosa Sergio Tara Vicente Willa Xavier Yolanda Zeke |\nThese lists are also re-cycled every six years (the 2023 list will be used again in 2029).\nIn the event that more than twenty-four named tropical cyclones in the eastern North Pacific basin in a season, any additional storms will take names from an alternate list of names approved by the WMO.

      "text": "After an emergency, you may need to survive on your own for several days. Being prepared means having your own food, water and other supplies to last for several days. A disaster supplies kit is a collection of basic items your household may need in the event of an emergency.\nMake sure your emergency kit is stocked with the items on the checklist below. Download a printable version to take with you to the store. Once you take a look at the basic items consider what unique needs your family might have, such as supplies for pets or seniors.\nEmergency Supply List\nEmergency Supply Kit Checklist Translations\nBasic Disaster Supplies Kit\nTo assemble your kit store items in airtight plastic bags and put your entire disaster supplies kit in one or two easy-to-carry containers such as plastic bins or a duffel bag.\nA basic emergency supply kit could include the following recommended items:\n- Water (one gallon per person per day for several days, for drinking and sanitation)\n- Food (at least a several-day supply of non-perishable food)\n- Battery-powered or hand crank radio and a NOAA Weather Radio with tone alert\n- Flashlight\n- First aid kit\n- Extra batteries\n- Whistle (to signal for help)\n- Dust mask (to help filter contaminated air)\n- Plastic sheeting, scissors and duct tape (to shelter in place)\n- Moist towelettes, garbage bags and plastic ties (for personal sanitation)\n- Wrench or pliers (to turn off utilities)\n- Manual can opener (for food)\n- Local maps\n- Cell phone with chargers and a backup battery\nAdditional Emergency Supplies\nConsider adding the following items to your emergency supply kit based on your individual needs:\n- Soap, hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes to disinfect surfaces\n- Prescription medications. About half of all Americans take a prescription medicine every day. An emergency can make it difficult for them to refill their prescription or to find an open pharmacy. Organize and protect your prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs, and vitamins to prepare for an emergency.\n- Non-prescription medications such as pain relievers, anti-diarrhea medication, antacids or laxatives\n- Prescription eyeglasses and contact lens solution\n- Infant formula, bottles, diapers, wipes and diaper rash cream\n- Pet food and extra water for your pet\n- Cash or traveler's checks\n- Important family documents such as copies of insurance policies, identification and bank account records saved electronically or in a waterproof, portable container\n- Sleeping bag or warm blanket for each person\n- Complete change of clothing appropriate for your climate and sturdy shoes\n- Fire extinguisher\n- Matches in a waterproof container\n- Feminine supplies and personal hygiene items\n- Mess kits, paper cups, plates, paper towels and plastic utensils\n- Paper and pencil\n- Books, games, puzzles or other activities for children\nMaintaining Your Kit\nAfter assembling your kit remember to maintain it so it\u2019s ready when needed:\n- Keep canned food in a cool, dry place.\n- Store boxed food in tightly closed plastic or metal containers.\n- Replace expired items as needed.\n- Re-think your needs every year and update your kit as your family\u2019s needs change.\nKit Storage Locations\nSince you do not know where you will be when an emergency occurs, prepare supplies for home, work and cars.\n- Home: Keep this kit in a designated place and have it ready in case you have to leave your home quickly. Make sure all family members know where the kit is kept.\n- Work: Be prepared to shelter at work for at least 24 hours. Your work kit should include food, water and other necessities like medicines, as well as comfortable walking shoes, stored in a \u201cgrab and go\u201d case.\n- Car: In case you are stranded, keep a kit of emergency supplies in your car."

      "text": "How to Make a Family Disaster Plan\n07/22/2025\nPlan | Stay Safe \u2022 Earthquakes | Extreme Heat | Floods | Hail | Hurricanes | Lightning | Tornadoes | Tsunamis | Winter Storms\nWhere will your family or household be when disaster strikes? If you are not together when an emergency happens, will everyone know how to stay in contact \u2014 even if cell towers are down and phones don\u2019t work? Do you have a meeting place and will everyone have a way to get there?\nTo develop a family disaster plan, start by mapping out contact methods and meeting places. Then share and practice your plan with your family or household and out-of-town contact. While you develop your plan, keep in mind these specific household needs:\n- Ages of household members\n- Medical needs like prescriptions and equipment\n- Disabilities or access and functional needs\n- Dietary needs\n- Pets or service animals\n- Languages spoken\nAfter you make your plan, all you need to do is revisit and communicate your plan regularly so you\u2019re ready when disaster strikes.\nBuild your plan\n- Write it down.\n- Create a document with the contact information for your family, close friends, designated out-of-town contact, employers, and other service providers like doctors, schools, etc.\n- Plan to communicate.\n- Plan how to communicate with family or friends when disaster strikes.\n- Discuss the benefits of calling, texting, emailing, or using social media. Texting tends to work more reliably than calling, especially when systems are in high demand.\n- Determine how your family will receive emergency updates and alerts.\n- Choose a meeting place.\n- Pick two places to meet your family or household members.\n- Meet outside your home in case of a sudden emergency or at a friend's or neighbor's house in case you can't return home.\n- Ensure that these places are reachable for those with access and functional needs and that your pets are welcome.\n- Share the address and phone number for each of your meet-up locations.\n- Add the information to your phone\u2019s contacts and list them in your plan.\n- Plan to evacuate.\n- If an evacuation is necessary, determine where you will evacuate and how you will get there.\n- If you plan to shelter-in-place, identify the safest location in your home to shelter during a disaster.\n- Identify emergency contact(s).\n- Ask an out-of-town family member or friend to be your emergency contact.\n- Ensure everyone in your household knows the contact\u2019s name, location, phone number, email, and any social media contact options.\n- Schedule a meeting.\n- Set a meeting with your household to talk about the types of disasters and hazards you might face.\n- Work together and share responsibilities as a team.\nKnow your plan\nSend links to your disaster plan and make copies for all family or household members and emergency contacts. Post a copy in a prominent place in your home like a bulletin board.\nPractice the plan\nRegularly gather your family or household members to review and practice your plan. Discuss what information you would communicate during a disaster and send practice messages. Make sure all family members (including children) understand how and when to call 911.\nUpdate your communication plan at least once a year or whenever information changes.\nSpecial Considerations for Families with Children\nA natural disaster is often devastating for adults, but children can be especially vulnerable to stress and anxiety when disaster strikes. Prepare your children before a disaster and plan activities to keep them busy during and after an emergency.\nGetting kids involved in the planning process and letting them plan activities will distribute the workload and give your family a sense of control.\nPreparing Your Children for Disasters\n- Learn what types of emergencies are possible where you live, teach your children about them, and discuss the steps you\u2019ve taken to protect your family and home.\n- Discuss emergencies that may require evacuation, such as a hurricane, and shelter-in-place emergencies, such as a tornado.\n- Include your children when creating your family communication plans and building a disaster supply kit.\n- Have a disaster drill and practice your plan, making sure to give your children a role and way to participate.\n- Prepare fun, kid-friendly activities and games to keep them occupied. Choose games that they do not ordinarily play, so they have something special to enjoy.\n- Select activities that do not require power so you can conserve your batteries and back-up power sources.\nMore Resources"

      "text": "A tropical wave brewing off the African coast could become the next named storm\nDon't look now and spoil your Labor Day weekend, but by this time next week, another tropical system could be worth watching as it crosses the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe National Hurricane Center is monitoring a tropical wave expected to move off the African coast on Aug. 31. After it moves into the Atlantic, environmental conditions in the region could support slow development of a tropical storm as the wave moves westward, the hurricane center said.\nIf a named storm forms, it would be the seventh tropical storm of the season. According to the official list of names for the 2025 season, the next name up is Gabrielle.\nThe center's outlook map shows a 30% chance of a tropical system formation within seven days, along a path stretching between the Cabo Verde Islands and the middle of the tropical Atlantic.\nThe timing and location of the westward- to northwestward-moving wave would coincide with a long-term outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center that showed increased chances of a storm forming in the region over the week between Sept. 3 and 9. From Sept. 10, the center predicts enhanced chances for storm activity in the midst of the tropical Atlantic as well as a greater than 20% chance of activity in the southern Gulf and northwestern Caribbean.\nOver the 30-year period between 1991 and 2020, the seventh storm of the season forms on average by Sept. 3.\nErin was the only hurricane so far this season, even though the second hurricane typically forms by Aug. 26. Erin battered beaches and sea turtle nests along much of the Atlantic coast. Rough surf and rip currents stirred up by its high winds and large size are blamed for the deaths of two swimmers, one in New Hampshire and one off Long Island. A boater in his 50s went missing after a vessel capsized off the Massachusetts coast on Aug. 25\nSeasonal outlooks for the 2025 season from NOAA and others have predicted a busier than normal season, and forecasters say they still expect that to be the case.\nThe annual hurricane season in the Atlantic typically reaches its peak on Sept. 10, but 13 of last year's named storms formed on or after Sept. 9, including Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton. The Atlantic season officially began on June 1 and will last through the end of November.\nSee where the disturbance is forecast to go\nHow do hurricanes form?\nHurricanes are born in the tropics, above warm water. Clusters of thunderstorms can develop over the ocean when water temperatures exceed 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If conditions are right, the clusters swirl into a storm known as a tropical wave or tropical depression.\nA tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm once its sustained wind speeds reaches 39 miles per hour. When its winds reach 74 mph, the storm officially becomes a hurricane.\nPrepare now for hurricanes\nDelaying potentially lifesaving preparations could mean waiting until it\u2019s too late. \"Get your disaster supplies while the shelves are still stocked, and get that insurance checkup early, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recommends.\n- Develop an evacuation plan. If you are at risk from hurricanes, you need an evacuation plan. Now is the time to begin planning where you would go and how you would get there.\n- Assemble disaster supplies. Whether you\u2019re evacuating or sheltering in place, you\u2019re going to need supplies not just to get through the storm but for a possibly lengthy aftermath, NOAA said.\n- Get an insurance checkup and document your possessions. Contact your insurance company or agent now and ask for an insurance checkup to make sure you have enough insurance to repair or even replace your home and belongings. Remember, home and renters insurance don\u2019t cover flooding, so you\u2019ll need a separate policy for those. Flood insurance is available through your company, agent or the National Flood Insurance Program. Act now, because flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period.\n- Create a family communication plan. NOAA says you should take the time now to write down a hurricane plan and share it with your family. Determine family meeting places and make sure to include an out-of-town location in case of evacuation.\n- Strengthen your home. Now is the time to improve your home\u2019s ability to withstand hurricanes. Trim trees and install storm shutters, accordion shutters and impact glass; seal outside wall openings."

  "argos_summary": "A tropical wave is expected to emerge off Africa on Aug. 31, with a 30% chance of developing into a cyclone in the Atlantic over the next week; if it becomes a storm it would be the seventh of the 2025 season and would be named Gabrielle. The National Hurricane Center and NOAA are monitoring the wave and the current Atlantic conditions, which are favorable for tropical development. Hurricane Erin, the only hurricane so far this season, caused significant surf and rip\u2011current fatalities along the U.S. East Coast and highlighted the ongoing risk of coastal impacts. Forecasts from NOAA and other agencies project an above\u2011average 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, with enhanced chances of activity from early September onward.",
