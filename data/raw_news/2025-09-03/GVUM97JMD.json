  "content": "CHICAGO, Sept. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- In the wake of sweeping \"Liberation Day\" tariffs and reciprocal measures from key global partners, the U.S. trade environment is undergoing a recalibration. Because of the ongoing nature of the volatility, the project44 Tariff report will now be published the first week of every month, giving supply chain decision-makers a clearer picture of the macro landscape.\n\nHere are the key findings from the September report:\n\u2022 Export Declines to Top Partners: Year-to-date exports to Canada and China have dropped by 7.6% and 1% respectively, signaling a shift in demand and potential geopolitical tension\n\u2022 Blank Sailings Surge: Ocean carriers are responding with aggressive capacity management. The New York \u2192 Colombo route saw a 49.2 percentage point increase in blank sailings (defined as a cargo ship voyage being canceled, partially or entirely) year-over-year, with similar spikes on Lianyungang \u2192 Seattle (+27.0pp) and Kaohsiung \u2192 Long Beach (+22.7pp)\n\u2022 Diversification Trends: India and Bangladesh have gained modest import share, reflecting ongoing efforts by U.S. businesses to diversify sourcing amid tariff uncertainty\n\u2022 Legal Challenges and Policy Uncertainty: With the Trump Administration in its final term, the future of these tariffs remains unclear. Legal challenges to the \"Liberation Day\" tariffs are currently moving through the courts, and 2029 could mark their sunset\n\n\"Don't mistake capacity discipline for demand recovery. The spike in blanks on U.S.\u2013linked lanes is carriers managing the chessboard, avoiding high tariffs and reorganizing their importing strategy to align with the changing game,\" said Lora Cecere, founder of Supply Chain Insights, LLC.\n\nIn future months, project44 expects tariff rates to stabilize. Once trade agreements are extended, the current patterns suggest a cautious equilibrium can be found. Renewed volatility remains a possibility if geopolitical, legal or policy conditions shift.\n\nFor more information about project44 and Movement, the Decision Intelligence platform, visit project44.com.\n\nproject44 is the Decision Intelligence Platform for the modern supply chain.
