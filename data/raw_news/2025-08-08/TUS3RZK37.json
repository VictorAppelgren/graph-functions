  "title": "Florida woman faked her way into a nursing job \u2014 then it all unraveled, charges say",
  "description": "Autumn Bardisa posed as a licensed nurse and participated in the treatment of more than 4,000 patients while working at the hospital, authorities said.",
  "content": "A Florida woman posed as a nurse and treated thousands of patients before getting caught in the lie, leading to her arrest and criminal charges, authorities said.\n\nAutumn Bardisa, 29, was accused of submitting fake records to get a job at a hospital in Palm Coast, a city of about 100,000 in Flagler County. She treated or helped treat nearly 4,500 patients between June 2024 and January 2025, when she was fired after her ruse unraveled, the Flagler County Sheriff's Office said.\n\nBardisa was charged with seven counts of practicing a health care profession without a license and seven counts of fraudulent use of personal identification information, each a third-degree felony that carries up to five years in prison, the sheriff's office said. She was arrested on Aug. 5 while wearing medical scrubs, a photo released by the sheriff's office showed. She is being held on a $70,000 bond, jail records show.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most disturbing cases of medical fraud we\u2019ve ever investigated,\u201d Sheriff Rick Staly said in a statement.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear if Bardisa had an attorney who could comment on her behalf.\n\nHow did Florida woman get hired as a nurse?\n\nAccording to the sheriff's office, investigators learned that Bardisa was hired by the AdventHealth hospital in Palm Coast in July 2023 as an advanced nurse tech, working under supervision of a registered nurse. In her application, Bardisa said she had completed the required education for nursing but hadn't yet passed the national exam to obtain a license.\n\nDuring the course of her hiring, she told the hospital she had completed the exam and provided a license number, the sheriff's office said. The license number matched a registered nurse who had the same first name but a different last name, which Bardisa told the hospital was because she had recently gotten married. AdventHealth asked her to provide her marriage license, but she never did.\n\nDuring her time on the job, Bardisa participated in medical services to 4,486 people despite never actually holding a valid nursing license, the sheriff's office said.\n\nBardisa seemed to do very well at her job, Staly told the Daytona Beach News-Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, in an interview. She did so well that she eventually was up for a promotion. That's when things unraveled, he said.\n\nHow Bardisa got caught, officials say\n\nIn January 2025, Bardisa was offered a promotion. That\u2019s when a fellow employee checked Bardisa\u2019s license. The employee discovered that Bardisa had a certified nursing assistant license, which had expired, the sheriff's office stated. The employee reported her discovery to administrators.\n\nAdventHealth investigated and found that Bardisa had not provided her marriage license as she had been asked to do.\n\nAdministrators fired Bardisa on Jan. 22, 2025, and the hospital contacted the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nInvestigators found that the license number Bardisa provided belonged to another nurse.\n\nFlagler County Sheriff\u2019s Office detectives and investigators with the Florida Department of Health and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u201cdetermined that Bardisa shared a first name with the other nurse, who was employed by AdventHealth, but at a different hospital, and had attended school with her,\u201d the sheriff's office said. But the two women did not know each other.\n\nStaly said in the phone interview that the nurse whose credentials Bardisa used for her fraud works at an AdventHealth hospital in South Florida. He said Bardisa graduated from Rasmussen University, which according to its website, has campuses in Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\nStaly said Bardisa was going to be promoted to \"charge nurse\" when the hospital uncovered her deceit. A charge nurse supervises their specific nursing unit and ensures that nurses perform operations \"smoothly and efficiently\" within the department, according to the American Nurses Association website.\n\n\"I guess her degree is in this area,\" Staly said. \"But that doesn't make it right for you to steal someone's identity and pretend that you are a registered licensed nurse.\"\n\nLindsay Cashio, AdventHealth's executive director of communications for the region, told the News-Journal in an email that the hospital does not comment on personnel or pending legal matters.\n\nAfter she was fired, Bardisa passed her state test and became a registered nurse, receiving her license on Feb. 18. Staly said the state might revoke her license due to the accusations against her.\n\n\u201cThis woman potentially put thousands of lives at risk by pretending to be someone she was not and violating the trust of patients, their families, AdventHealth and an entire medical community,\" Staly said, calling her actions \"reckless and dangerous.\"\n\nStaly said his office is not aware of \"any injury or death that occurred while she was working for AdventHealth that was related to any care that she provided.\"\n\nHe said the state decided to charge Bardisa with one count of each charge for each of the seven months she committed the fraud because it would bog down the legal system to charge her with 4,486 counts.\n\n\"I give credit that she eventually got caught by AdventHealth and they reported it instead of trying to hide it like some corporations might try to do,\" Staly said. \"I won't speak for AdventHealth but clearly there's a follow-up flaw in their onboarding process. Ask for proof that she got married and she never provided it.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office asked anyone who believed they might be a victim to email fakenursecase@flaglersheriff.com for information.\n\nFake nurses and doctors arrested in several states\n\nFake nurses and doctors have been caught in several states in recent years, leading to multiple arrests.\n\nEarlier this year, a New York man was arrested after prosecutors said he posed as a doctor and performed a botched cosmetic surgery in his apartment, leaving a woman brain dead. She later died. Felipe Hoyos Foronda then tried to flee the country but was nabbed at an airport and charged with assault and unauthorized practice of a profession.\n\nLast month, police in Pennsylvania arrested Shannon Nicole Womack, who they said used at least 20 aliases to work as a registered nurse, licensed practical nurse and registered nurse supervisor to care for patients at rehabilitation and nursing homes without proper licenses.\n\nMore arrests have have been documented in Ohio, Michigan and Mississippi. Federal prosecutors in May charged a New York man, Kevin M. Whitman, with distributing and dispensing a controlled substance and fraud after they said he pretended to be a doctor and used someone else's credentials to issue 177 prescriptions of controlled substances including oxycodone.",

Whitman, 27, of Irondequoit, NY, was arrested and charged by criminal complaint with distributing and dispensing a controlled substance, using a registration number issued to another person to obtain controlled substances, and obtaining controlled substances by fraud. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $1,000,000 fine.\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Sean C. Eldridge, who is prosecuting the case, stated that Whitman is not a licensed physician in New York State or anywhere else in the United States and does not possess a DEA Registration Number to issue prescriptions. The criminal complaint alleges that between August 2023 and April 2025, Whitman claimed to be a medical doctor and, fraudulently and without authorization, used a DEA Registration Number belonging to Strong Memorial Hospital. Using that number, Whitman issued 177 prescriptions to nine individuals for Schedule II controlled substances, totaling 38,067 dosage units. Of these 177 prescriptions, 173 were for oxycodone. Whitman is not an employee of Strong Memorial Hospital, he did not graduate from the University of Rochester Medical School, and Whitman does not hold any professional licenses granted in New York State to practice medicine or to issue controlled substance prescriptions. During a search of Whitman\u2019s residence, law enforcement officers recovered a framed fake diploma purportedly from the University of Rochester Medical School.\nWhitman made an initial appearance this morning before U.S. Magistrate Judge Mark W. Pedersen and was released on conditions.\nThe criminal complaint is the result of an investigation by the Drug Enforcement Administration, under the direction of Special Agent-in-Charge Frank Tarentino, New York Field Division, the U.S. Department Health of Human Services, Office of Inspector General, under the direction of Special Agent-in-Charge Naomi Gruchacz, and the New York State Attorney General\u2019s Office Medicaid Fraud Control Unit, under the direction of Attorney General Letitia James.

      "text": "Charge Nurse vs. Nurse Manager: What's the Difference?\n5 min read\nCharge nurses and nurse managers are equally critical to the hierarchy of nursing. Though the scope of responsibilities varies, they both support, supervise, and amplify the voices of their fellow nurses. That ensures staff nurses can provide the best patient care possible. Learn what each position entails, how they're similar, and how they differ.\nWhat Is a Charge Nurse?\nCharge nurses oversee the operations of their specific nursing unit during a set period while working alongside the team. The primary role of a charge nurse is to ensure that all nursing functions within the department run smoothly and efficiently. They also provide guidance and support to help staff through challenging situations as they arise. Like staff nurses, charge nurses are generally patient-facing.\nTypical charge nurse responsibilities include:\n- Ensuring staff adheres to workplace protocols and procedures\n- Assisting nurses in their charge with patient-related questions\n- Overseeing the smooth transition from one shift to another\n- Acting as a liaison between nurses and doctors\n- Creating and evaluating staffing plans and schedules\n- Checking the availability of patient supplies and medications\n- Handling their own patient assignments, if applicable (varies by facility)\nFor a registered nurse (RN) to become a charge nurse, they typically require three to five years of clinical experience. According to Zippia, the median annual salary for RN charge nurses is $71,342.\nWhat Is a Nurse Manager?\nNurse managers are licensed nurses in upper management positions. Because their roles are mainly administrative, they often work in an office environment versus a clinical setting. They're usually RNs or advanced practice registered nurses (APRN), such as nurse practitioners (NP). Some nurse managers also have specific certifications, such as Nurse Executive Certification (NE-BC). And because the position requires legal and business acumen, they may also hold a Master of Business Administration (MBA).\nTypical responsibilities of a nurse manager vary by facility but generally include:\n- Handling staffing issues, such as hiring and setting or amending schedules\n- Supervising nursing personnel, including training and disciplining\n- Supporting other personnel in their unit, like social workers, therapists, and pharmacists\n- Managing financial and human resources for their unit\n- Overseeing the effectiveness of operations, including patient record maintenance\n- Serving as a liaison between nurses, physicians, and upper management, such as a hospital's director of nursing or C-suite\n- Ensuring their unit aligns with the strategic goals of the hospital or workplace setting, including following best legal and safety practices\nBesides having administrative and management savviness, nurse managers must demonstrate clinical excellence. Many health care facilities require at least five years of hands-on experience. Nurse managers fall under the fast-growing field of medical and health services managers. Per the Bureau of Labor Statistics, their average annual salary is $101,340, with a rapid estimated growth rate of 28%.\nHow the Roles Are Similar\nNurse managers and charge nurses share many similar responsibilities, such as guiding and supporting staff, addressing questions or feedback, and implementing or overseeing new procedures. Strong organizational and problem-solving skills are integral to each position, so clinical excellence is required. If you enjoy a role that entails leading with purpose and compassion, a career as a charge nurse or nurse manager can be a fulfilling option.\nIn either role, you'll serve as a de facto mentor. You'll provide candid, nonjudgmental feedback and ongoing education to the nurses on your watch. You'll also ensure they have what's needed to succeed. For a nurse manager, that may involve developing and protecting an environment calibrated to prevent burnout. If you're a charge nurse, it could mean ensuring time gets managed correctly, so your entire staff gets their necessary shift breaks.\nIf you're in a charge nurse role, you may decide to become a nurse manager. Depending on your institution's requirements, you may need to earn a Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) and an MBA in addition to the required RN credentials.\nLearn more about the benefits of mentorship in nursing and the best qualities of a nurse leader.\nHow the Roles Differ\nNurse managers and charge nurses share the overarching duty of ensuring their teams have the support needed to thrive in the organization. However, their day-to-day responsibilities and standard requirements for eligibility vary.\nInteraction With Staff and Patients\nCharge nurses work alongside their nursing staff during shift hours and have direct contact with patients. Nurse managers are more clinically removed, focusing on setting overall standards of care.\nDay-to-Day Responsibilities\nCharge nurses are on the ground floor overseeing the daily operations of their unit and staff. That typically includes:\n- Assisting patients and administering treatment\n- Distributing assignments to staff based on patient volume and needs\n- Assessing needs for incoming shifts and requesting additional staff accordingly\nNurse managers' daily schedules generally focus on administrative undertakings rather than patient care. They typically meet with other supervisors, check in with staff members, and oversee hiring new employees.\nScope of Oversight\nCharge nurses are generally responsible for the activities within their unit for the duration of their shift. A nurse manager may be responsible for all activities at one or more locations and for all shifts within a 24-hour cycle.\nEducation and Advanced Degrees\nNurse managers typically hold advanced degrees, such as an MSN, NP, or APRN. They often also obtain an MBA to prepare for the business aspect of their role. Charge nurses don't have standardized license requirements but are usually registered nurses and may also have certifications specific to their unit, such as Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS).\nWhether you decide to become a charge nurse or nurse manager, both positions are in high demand and offer challenging and rewarding career opportunities.\nImages sourced from Getty Images"

Each charge is a third-degree felony punishable by up to five years in prison.\nDetectives determined that Bardisa had participated in medical services to 4,486 individuals from June 2024 through January 2025, despite never holding a valid nursing license, the sheriff's office stated.\nBardisa was being held at the Sheriff Perry Hall Inmate Detention Facility on a $70,000 bond.\nThe sheriff\u2019s office began the investigation in January after AdventHealth hospital administrators said they terminated Bardisa \u201cfor impersonating a registered nurse by utilizing another individual\u2019s license number and submitting false documentation to be employed as an advanced nurse technician\u201d at AdventHealth Hospital on Palm Coast Parkway in Palm Coast, according to the sheriff's office.\nThe hospital hired Bardisa on July 3, 2023, as an advanced nurse tech to work under the supervision of a registered nurse, the release stated.\nWhen she applied for a job, Bardisa indicated that she passed the required classes to be a registered nurse but had not yet passed the licensing exam. Bardisa subsequently told the hospital that she had passed the exam and gave them a license number, which matched a woman with her first name but a different last name, the sheriff's office stated.\nBardisa said she had recently gotten married and changed her last name. She was asked to provide her marriage license but she never did, the sheriff's office stated.\nBardisa about to get promoted\nIn January 2025, Bardisa was offered a promotion. That\u2019s when a fellow employee checked Bardisa\u2019s license. The employee discovered that Bardisa had a certified nursing assistant license, which had expired, the sheriff's office stated. The employee reported her discovery to administrators.\nAdventHealth investigated and found that Bardisa had not provided her marriage license as she had been asked to do.\nAdministrators fired Bardisa on Jan. 22, 2025, and the hospital contacted the sheriff\u2019s office.\nAdventHealth declines comment\nIn an email, Lindsay Cashio, AdventHealth's executive director of communications for the region, wrote: \"We do not comment on private personnel matters or pending legal matters.\"\nFlagler County Sheriff\u2019s Office detectives and investigators with the Florida Department of Health and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services \u201cdetermined that Bardisa shared a first name with the other nurse, who was employed by AdventHealth, but at a different hospital, and had attended school with her,\u201d the release stated. But the two women did not know each other.\nFlagler County Sheriff Rick Staly said in a phone interview that the nurse whose credentials Bardisa used for her fraud works at an AdventHealth hospital in South Florida.\nHe said Bardisa graduated from Rasmussen University, which according to its website, has campuses in Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota and Wisconsin.\nStaly said Bardisa was going to be promoted to \"charge nurse\" when the hospital uncovered her deceit. A charge nurse supervises their specific nursing unit and ensures that nurses perform operations \"smoothly and efficiently\" within the department, according to the American Nurses Association website.\nAfter firing, Bardisa became registered nurse\nAfter she was fired, Bardisa passed her state test and became a registered nurse, receiving her license on Feb. 18. Staly said he believed, but could not confirm, that the state planned to revoke her license due to the accusations against her.\n\"This is one of the most disturbing cases of medical fraud we\u2019ve ever investigated,\u201d stated Staly. \u201cThis woman potentially put thousands of lives at risk by pretending to be someone she was not and violating the trust of patients, their families, AdventHealth and an entire medical community. Thanks to great investigative work between our detectives and State Attorney R.J. Larizza\u2019s Office and AdventHealth, along with our state and federal partners, she\u2019ll now be held accountable for her reckless and dangerous actions.\u201d\nStaly said his office is not aware of \"any injury or death that occurred while she was working for AdventHealth that was related to any care that she provided.\"\nStaly said he wanted to make it \"very clear\" that the sheriff's office never received anyone's medical records because that information is all protected.\nHe said the state decided to charge Bardisa with one count of each charge for each of the seven months she committed the fraud because it would bog down the legal system to charge her with 4,486 counts.\n\"I give credit that she eventually got caught by AdventHealth and they reported it instead of trying to hide it like some corporations might try to do,\" Staly said. \"I won't speak for AdventHealth but clearly there's a follow-up flaw in their onboarding process. Ask for proof that she got married and she never provided it.\"\nIt appeared Bardisa was doing well at her job, Staly said.\n\"I would guess that since she was up for promotion and that's what caught her I guess she did a pretty good job overall, even though she wasn't licensed. I guess her degree is in this area,\" Staly said. \"But that doesn't make it right for you to steal someone's identity and pretend that you are a registered licensed nurse.\"\nThe sheriff's office asked anyone who believed they might be a victim of Bardisa to contact the FCSO by email at fakenursecase@flaglersheriff.com for information."

      "text": "Fake nurse used at least 20 aliases to illegally treat patients: Police\nA woman was arrested after allegedly using at least 20 aliases to pose as a registered nurse (RN), licensed practical nurse (LPN) and registered nurse supervisor to care for patients at rehabilitation and nursing homes across Pennsylvania, state police said.\nShannon Nicole Womack, 39, was charged with 43 counts, including endangering the welfare of a care-dependent person, identity theft, forgery, procurement fraud, use and possession of drug paraphernalia and falsely pretending to hold a license, according to Pennsylvania state court records reviewed by USA TODAY.\nAccording to Pennsylvania State Police, Womack allegedly secured nursing positions through staffing agencies by \"submitting fraudulently signed documents and also by creating a false LLC to deploy herself to jobs.\" Reports indicate she worked at each of these nursing jobs for \"only a short time,\" police added.\nThe belief is that Womack began the \"pattern of racketeering\" in 2020 and continued to pose as nurses across many different states on the eastern side of the country, the department said.\n\"During that COVID time, they got hit hard, and they needed help,\" Pennsylvania State Police trooper Rocco Gagliardi said at a news conference. \"So it wasn't uncommon for these different residence locations, agencies, to reach out to host agencies and say we need some extra shifts filled. That started in 2020, and it was such an easy transition; she just kept going after that.\"\nAs of Wednesday, July 23, court records did not indicate Womack had legal representation.\nHow was Shannon Womack arrested?\nWomack, of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, was arrested on Monday, July 21, according to court records. Her arrest came after troopers conducted a traffic stop in April on a Mercedes-Benz on Interstate 79 in Washington County, police said in a news release. During the stop, Womack handed the troopers a fake ID.\nA search of the vehicle resulted in the discovery of multiple forms of identification, medications prescribed to different victims, medical documents and numerous pieces of medical equipment, according to the department.\nThe traffic stop led to a monthslong investigation during which authorities said they found Womack was associated with 20 different aliases and seven different Social Security numbers. Investigators also found that Womack allegedly used the identities and credentials of four confirmed nurses from southern states, police said.\nWhat aliases did Shannon Womack allegedly use?\nPolice, who are working with the Pennsylvania Department of Health, Department of State and multiple district attorneys and states in the investigation, said these are 10 aliases Womack allegedly used in various parts of the state:\n- Shannon Nicole Parham\n- Shannon Nicole Abiola\n- Shannon Nicole Armstrong\n- Shannon Abiola-Parham\n- Shannon Nicole Grimes\n- Shannon Nicole Womack\n- Shannon Nicole Lawson\n- Shannon Nicole Lethco\n- Shannon Nicole Robinson\n- Shannon Lee Lawson"

      "text": "Mississippi woman arrested on suspicion of faking nursing credentials\nA Mississippi woman who was arrested on suspicion of faking nursing credentials may have used a license number from a deceased person and needs mental health treatment, according to authorities.\nMary Moore was arrested on Nov. 21 and charged with false pretense, a felony, Aberdeen Police Chief Quinell Shumpert told USA TODAY.\nShe was booked into the Monroe County Jail.\nWoman accused of using deceased person's license number\nShumpert said Moore was properly credentialed at one point but she had a mental breakdown and her license expired in 2017.\nIt\u2019s not clear who is representing Moore legally.\nAccording to Shumpert, Moore was hired in October 2023 at Care Center in Aberdeen, about 30 miles north of Columbus. She claimed to be a registered nurse.\n\u201cShe was supervised the whole time she was there and during her supervision, there were certain things about her which made them suspicious,\u201d he said.\nMoore also applied for a job at another nursing home in Fulton, Mississippi. She was hired there but someone called anonymously telling the nursing home she wasn\u2019t really a registered nurse.\nWhen the Fulton nursing home found out what happened, they contacted the Care Center in Aberdeen, Shumpert said.\nShe is accused of using the license number of someone whose name matches hers. The person is deceased, Shumpert said.\nPolice chief says woman accused of faking nursing credentials is 'mentally ill'\n\u201cShe is mentally ill. She needs to be in the hospital somewhere,\u201d Shumpert said, adding that someone is currently trying to get the woman admitted to a mental health facility.\nHe said the way the judicial system and mental health facilities deal with mental illness needs work.\nMental health facilities don\u2019t accept people who have felonies, he said. Usually what happens is the felony charges must be dropped for them to get help.\n\u201cOnce you drop those charges and take them to a mental health facility, they may keep them for two or three days and then they turn them loose, out doing the same thing they were doing before,\u201d he told USA TODAY. \u201cIt\u2019s just a mess.\u201d"
