      "summary": "The article reports a fatal shooting of two police officers in the UK by a self‑proclaimed sovereign citizen, highlighting growing concerns about the extremist movement’s spread in Britain. Experts note that sovereign citizens, originally a US phenomenon, now have tens of thousands of adherents in the UK and Australia, and their anti‑government ideology has been linked to violent incidents worldwide. The piece cites academic and law‑enforcement sources warning that the movement’s use of pseudolegal arguments and online propaganda could fuel further clashes, especially as generative AI amplifies recruitment. While the UK has not seen widespread violence yet, authorities are treating sovereign citizens as a serious threat, mirroring responses in Australia and the US.",
