      "feedback": "The draft covers a broad set of timely themes but needs a tighter, testable 0–3 week scenario anchored in explicit causal links, tighter quantification, and a consistent use of the provided sources. Actionable edits: (1) Build a crisp base-case causal chain for the horizon: tariff pass-through to U.S. auto pricing (evidence that tariffs fell from 27.5% to 15% but are still affecting prices via Nikkei/WSJ reporting) leading to higher auto sticker prices and potential negative equity churn (cite S15934PBQ for tariffs and Toyota NA −$438m income drag; cite CDBMWIUTB for the financing-cost channel). (2) Quantify the financing channel and depreciation risk with concrete figures from the sources you’ve got: average new-car loan rate 6.43% (CDBMWIUTB) and EV depreciation/ resale risk framing from the auto-depreciation piece (CDBMWIUTB); avoid generalities and state a plausible impact range rather than a vague “pressure.” (3) Tighten the near-term catalysts: confirm tariff-policy cues ( tariff level, any re-ignition of price pressure), Lagarde’s Jackson Hole context on central-bank independence (U6HXAJR4J), and the Vegas/Bethel datapoints as sentiment and financial-condition proxies (Vegas tourist-slump piece 6OOEK8TUR; Bethel affordability and housing-data points in F8GF45MEU and the embedded Redfin data via 6OOEK8TUR). (4) Distinguish transmission channels into price pass-through, credit/financing conditions, and policy credibility; treat EV depreciation and used-vs-new substitution as a separate sub-channel with explicit references. (5) Define explicit levels and invalidation signals for 0–3 weeks: e.g., weekly auto-price momentum or CPI autos subcomponent up a notch versus the prior, a move in average auto-loan rate above/below the 6.4% ballpark, and any breach of a stated threshold in Bethel 8-30g litigation risk or in Vegas pricing signals; specify that a failure of tariff pass-through to materialize within the week would invalidate the upside thesis. (6) Reconcile conflicts with a balanced view: present both the pass-through evidence (S15934PBQ/Nikkei) and the automakers’ denials of tariff effects (S15934PBQ) rather than taking one side as given. (7) Improve structure to align with SECTION FOCUS: clearly label Immediate Drivers, Near-Term Catalysts/Positioning Dynamics, and Reaction Function, and end with a concise “monitor next” checklist. (8) Citation hygiene: attach each factual claim to one or more of the IDs you’ve included (CDBMWIUTB, S15934PBQ, U6HXAJR4J, F8GF45MEU, 6OOEK8TUR) and avoid introducing any numbers that aren’t present in those sources. (9) Shorten and sharpen prose to a single, tight paragraph that flows from drivers through catalysts to the monitor list, replacing broad assertions with the concrete data points you now have. This will increase signal, reduce ambiguity, and support a testable 0–3 week view with credible, source-backed thresholds.",
