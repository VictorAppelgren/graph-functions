  "content": "Three people died and five were injured in Indonesia after protesters set fire to a regional parliament building, authorities said on Saturday, as demonstrations pose the first major test to President Prabowo Subianto\u2019s government.\n\nThe Southeast Asian nation\u2019s disaster management agency, in a statement, did not give the causes of the deaths in the Friday evening fire in Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi province.\n\nThe Antara news agency said the dead victims allegedly had been trapped in the burning building. The disaster agency said two of the injuries resulted from people jumping out of the building.\n\nProtests began in Indonesia\u2019s capital Jakarta this week over lawmakers\u2019 pay, escalating on Friday after a police armored vehicle hit and killed the driver of a ride-hailing motorbike.\n\nPrabowo, who took office in October last year, visited the home of the driver late on Friday, offering condolences to his parents and vowing to oversee the investigation into his death.\n\nLocal media reported isolated looting in Jakarta and damage to several transportation facilities in Jakarta on Friday, as well as demonstrations in the major cities of Bandung and Yogyakarta.\n\nJakarta\u2019s mass rapid transit railway said trains were not stopping at one station on Saturday near Friday\u2019s protest site, while the Jakarta province-owned Transjakarta bus service said it was unable to serve customers.\n\n\n\nThere were no immediate signs of protests on Saturday.",

      "text": "Protests erupted in multiple cities and tensions soared across Indonesia on Friday, a day after a delivery rider was allegedly run over by a police armored vehicle during clashes between riot police and students protesting against lawmakers\u2019 allowances.\nProtesters marched to the headquarters of the police mobile brigade in the capital Jakarta on Friday, and some attempted to storm the compound. Police used water canons and fired rounds of tear gas to push back the demonstrators, who hurled bottles, rocks and flares at them.\nOne group of rioters set fire to a five-story building near the police compound in Kwitang neighborhood of central Jakarta, causing several people to be trapped inside. Some students halted their protests to help soldiers and residents rescue those trapped.\nOther protesters destroyed traffic signs and other infrastructure, causing traffic to come to a standstill in the area.\nClashes between rock-throwing demonstrators and riot police also broke out in other cities across the country, including Surabaya, Solo, Yogyakarta, Medan, Makassar, Manado, Bandung and Manokwari in the easternmost Papua region.\nThe unrest came after a video on social media apparently showing the death of the motorcycle taxi driver during Thursday\u2019s clashes shocked the nation and spurred an outcry against the security forces.\nThe victim, identified as 21-year-old Affan Kurniawan, was reportedly completing a food delivery service order when he was caught in the clash following days of violent demonstrations.\nWitnesses told local television that the armored car from the National Police\u2019s Mobile Brigade unit suddenly sped through the crowd of demonstrators and hit Kurniawan, causing him to fall. Instead of stopping, the car ran over him.\nThousands of motorcycle riders, along with rights activists and politicians, paid their respects to the Kurniawan on Friday during his burial. They filled a major traffic circle in the heart of the city and sprawled into its main thoroughfares.\nPresident Prabowo Subianto appealed for calm and expressed condolences in a televised speech.\n\u201cI am deeply concerned and deeply saddened by this incident,\u201d Subianto said. \u201cI was shocked and disappointed by the officers\u2019 excessive actions.\u201d\nThe former general said he has been closely monitoring developments surrounding the protests, and said he has ordered a thorough investigation. He called on people \u201cto remain vigilant against elements that constantly stir up unrest and seek chaos.\u201d\n\u201cIn a situation like this, I urge all citizens to remain calm and trust in the government I lead, which will do what\u2019s best for the people,\u201d Subianto said.\nAuthorities confirmed that seven members of the police motor brigade who were linked to the incident have been detained and questioned, though the driver of the armored vehicle has not yet been identified.\nNationwide protests began on Monday after reports revealed that all 580 lawmakers received a monthly housing allowance of 50 million rupiah ($3,075) in addition to their salaries. The allowance, introduced last year, is almost 10 times the Jakarta minimum wage.\nCritics argue the new allowance is not only excessive but also insensitive at a time when most people are grappling with soaring living costs and taxes and rising unemployment."
