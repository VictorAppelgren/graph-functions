  "description": "A Trump administration ruling that gold bars will be subject to tariffs stunned traders who had assumed they would be exempted, throwing bullion markets into turmoil.",
  "content": "A Trump administration ruling that gold bars will be subject to tariffs stunned traders who had assumed they would be exempted, throwing bullion markets into turmoil.\n\nFutures in New York, which are backed by bars shipped from Switzerland and other key trading and refining hubs, surged overnight to a record. They later erased those gains after an official said Friday that the White House intends to issue an executive order to clarify what that person described as misinformation.\n\nTraders, analysts and executives across the industry had understood the bars would be exempt from reciprocal tariffs enacted by President Donald Trump, such as a 39% levy on Swiss goods. But when a gold refiner in Switzerland asked about it, US Customs and Border Protection clarified that one-kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars are subject to the levies, according to a letter from the agency.\n\nThe decision, if it remains in place, has sweeping implications for the flow of bullion around the world, and potentially for the smooth functioning of the US futures contract. Gold\u2019s role as a financial asset and global currency sets it apart from other commodities like copper that have been roiled by tariffs, and traders said on Friday that shipments were freezing up in response to the shock news.\n\n\u201cIn the long run, the existence of US tariffs on deliverable gold products raises the question on the role of futures trading in the US,\u201d said Joni Teves, a strategist at UBS AG. \u201cUntil there is clarity, we expect the gold market and precious metals markets more generally to remain very nervous.\u201d\n\nThe US Customs notice was first reported by the Financial Times.\n\nThe decision extends a tumultuous year for gold, which has soared to unprecedented levels amid strong buying from central banks and as Trump\u2019s trade war drives haven demand. Earlier this year, physical flows were upended as traders rushed billions of dollars worth of gold and silver into the US as New York prices traded at large premiums in anticipation of potential tariffs. However, that trade came to a crashing halt after the US included gold and silver in its list of exemptions from the tariffs announced in early April.\n\nThe industry is still seeking answers to several questions: It\u2019s unclear if the US will also impose tariffs on larger 400-ounce bars that underpin trading in London. There\u2019s also uncertainty about levies for other major gold-producing countries. Speculation is even swirling that the US government issued the ruling in error, and that it could be legally challenged.\n\nThe Comex exchange in New York is one of three key global pricing venues, alongside London and Shanghai, where prices are now trading at a big discount.\n\nThe chaos has been exacerbated by the absence of a formal announcement or explanation. The CBP\u2019s ruling, which says that one-kilogram and 100-ounce gold bars should be classified under a different category than the one that received the exemption, was not initially made public but has now appeared on the CBPs website.\n\nThe decision will have particularly significant implications for refiners in Switzerland, which as the largest gold refining hub plays a particularly crucial role in the smooth functioning of the global market. If prices in London and New York move out of lockstep, Swiss refiners can melt down the larger bars that are traded in the UK capital so they can be delivered against US futures contracts, and vice versa.\n\n\u201cGold is moved back and forth between central banks and reserves around the world,\u201d said Robert Gottlieb, a former precious metals trader and managing director at JPMorgan Chase & Co., referring to the bars. \u201cWe never, ever thought that it would be hit by a tariff.\u201d\n\nOne-kilo gold bars are the most common form traded on Comex, the world\u2019s largest gold futures market, and comprise the bulk of Switzerland\u2019s bullion exports to the US. The country\u2019s gold exports have become a flashpoint in its trade negotiations with the US, after a surge in shipments earlier this year caused the US\u2019s trade deficit with the country to spike.\n\nThe levy could add to troubles for Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter after Trump handed Switzerland the highest country tariff among developed nations. She made an emergency trip to Washington on Thursday aimed at swaying the White House, but came away empty-handed after being denied a meeting with Trump.\n\nThe Swiss Precious Metals Association said in a statement on Friday the ruling threatens to negatively impact the international flow of physical gold.\n\n\u201cWe are particularly concerned about the implications of the tariffs for the gold industry and the physical exchange of gold with the U.S., a long-standing and historical partner for Switzerland,\u201d said Christoph Wild, president of the ASFCMP.\n\nManagers at two major gold refineries in Asia, who did not want to be named discussing sensitive information, said they are pausing shipments to the US until there is more clarity on the tariffs. Several traders and refiners in Switzerland and elsewhere said they are taking similar steps.\n\nContracts for December delivery jumped to a premium of more than $100 an ounce above the global benchmark for spot prices in London, as investors bet on the tariffs snarling imports. That premium tumbled to about $61 following the official\u2019s comments on the excecutive order.\n\nImports and exports for all countries are classified by an intricate system of codes that are used to set the scope of any levies.\n\nThe CBP letter said the gold bars fall under code 7108.13.5500 rather than the non-tariffed 7108.12.10 as expected. That classifies them as a \u201csemi-manufactured\u201d rather than \u201cunwrought\u201d type of gold, according to the US International Trade Commission\u2019s website.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether other types of gold bars, such as 400-ounce bullion that\u2019s the most-traded in London, will be subject to tariffs. If not, those could simply be shipped to the US and recast into one-kilogram blocks, said a manager of a major refinery, who declined to be named as they are not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nSuch a scenario would still render the CME contract unviable, according to Nikos Kavalis, managing director at consultancy Metals Focus Ltd, since the US only has limited gold refining capacity.\n\nUS monthly gold imports surged to a high of 43 tons in January this year, as traders raced to ship metal to the US ahead of any possible tariffs. That compares to average monthly production by gold refiners in the US of 22 tons last year, according to US Geological Survey data.\n\n\u201cThe gap between the spot price and the futures price will be prone to issues of capacity. I just don\u2019t see that as being in anyone\u2019s best interest,\u201d he said. \u201cI suspect that this is a misunderstanding or an error on the part of the customs authorities, or if not an error, let\u2019s say a poor assessment. I suspect it\u2019ll be legally challenged or lobbied.\u201d",

      "text": "Nordstrom to close Santa Monica store\n- Share via\nRetail giant Nordstrom is closing its sprawling Santa Monica Place store as it restructures its network to try to better target customers who have moved to online shopping.\nThe last day of business of the store at 220 Broadway in Santa Monica will be Aug. 26, a spokesperson said in a statement. The store was opened about 15 years ago.\nAlthough the spokesperson didn\u2019t give the reason for the decision, safety has become an issue in downtown Santa Monica and Third Street Promenade, once known as a signature destination for shopping and dining.\nSanta Monica has struggled with high-profile robberies in recent years and an increase in the number of people living on the street.\nLast week, the police arrested a man accused of opening fire at a police officer at the Santa Monica Place mall and shooting at a Waymo vehicle. Another officer was attacked and injured there last year.\nNordstrom started as a shoe store in 1901 in Seattle. Currently, it operates more than 370 Nordstrom, Nordstrom Local and Nordstrom Rack locations. In 2024, the company opened 23 stores, including seven in California.\n\u201cWe believe we\u2019ll be best able to serve customers in the area by leveraging our surrounding stores and through our digital channels,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cDecisions like this are never easy, and we understand the impact they have on our team members.\u201d\nOther retailers have also been restructuring their store networks across the country. Macy\u2019s announced last year that it would shut down 150 stores by 2026, which include the one in San Francisco\u2019s Union Square. Walmart shut the doors to its West Covina store in March.\nAt Home, the home goods retailer, has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and announced the closure of 26 stores, as it tries to recover from a slowdown in sales and the impacts of inflation and tariffs."

      "text": "Tesla awards Elon Musk $29 billion in stock amid compensation battle. What to know\n- Share via\nTesla is awarding Elon Musk around $29 billion in shares as a legal battle looms over a prior multibillion dollar compensation plan for the chief executive.\nA special committee of the company\u2019s board of directors said the interim pay package would motivate Musk to \u201cstay focused\u201d on Tesla as the electric vehicle maker pivots to robotics and artificial intelligence.\nUnder the pay plan, Musk would receive 96 million shares valued at around $300 each as long as he remains in an executive position at Tesla for the next two years. On Musk\u2019s social media platform X, the special committee said the executive has not received \u201cmeaningful compensation\u201d for his work for eight years.\nOne of the world\u2019s richest people, Musk owns about 13% of Tesla shares, making him the largest individual shareholder. The company is worth more than $969 billion based on current share prices. Tesla shares on Monday closed at $309.26, up 2%.\nAggressive, audacious, bristling with risk. That describes Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk.\nWhy did the board approve this plan?\nTesla board members Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson said on X that the $29 billion award is a first step, \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to compensate Musk in lieu of a longer term plan.\nAs Musk splits his time and energy among several ventures, including AI startup xAI and space exploration firm SpaceX, Tesla board members said they are eager to keep his attention focused on the electric vehicle maker. Musk has garnered criticism from investors for getting distracted by his temporary role in the Trump administration.\nTesla shares have fallen more than 18% this year following significant brand damage and plunging vehicle sales. The company is at a critical turning point where it must pivot to robotics and autonomous driving technology to remain competitive, analysts said. Musk has overseen Tesla\u2019s robotaxi launch in Austin, Texas, and frequently touts the potential of the humanoid robot Optimus.\nDuring a feud with President Trump, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk announced plans to start his own political party. Shares for his company fell more than 6% Monday.\n\u201cWhile these impending changes are exciting, the outcomes are not guaranteed,\u201d wrote Denholm and Wilson-Thompson. \u201cIt is imperative to retain and motivate our extraordinary talent, beginning with Elon.\u201d\n\u201cWe are confident that this award will incentivize Elon to remain at Tesla,\u201d they wrote.\nWhat happened to Musk\u2019s previous pay package?\nA Delaware judge has twice struck down a 2018 executive pay package that would have awarded Musk more than $55 billion in stock, arguing that Musk exerted unfair control over the negotiation process.\nIn 2018, Tesla shareholder Richard Tornetta sued the company to block the compensation plan, claiming the board misled investors and was not transparent about the approval process. Tornetta and his attorneys also argued that the board was too susceptible to Musk\u2019s influence.\nChancellor Kathaleen McCormick, the judge in the case, sided with Tornetta and rescinded the entire pay package, calling it an \u201cunfathomable sum.\u201d McCormick denied the pay plan again in 2024, after the board held another vote to approve it. Tesla has since appealed McCormick\u2019s second decision, citing his contributions to Tesla\u2019s growth.\nA Delaware judge rejected Tesla CEO Elon Musk\u2019s multibillion-dollar pay package again, writing that the company\u2019s approval process was \u2018deeply flawed.\u2019\n\u201cThis compensation issue has been a constant concern of shareholders once the Delaware soap opera began,\u201d Tesla analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note.\nIf the 2018 plan is ultimately approved after legal battles, the recent $29 billion package will be thrown out to prevent double dipping, the board said.\nHow does Musk\u2019s pay compare to other chief executives?\nThe pay package brought to court in 2018 was the largest potential compensation plan for an executive of a publicly traded company, McCormick said, worth 250 times as much as the median peer pay.\nThe new plan is still the highest executive compensation package by far. Blackstone Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman earned $1.39 billion in 2008, compared to the $29 billion interim package for Musk. Another top earner, Palantir CEO Alexander Karp, earned $1.10 billion in 2020.\nA Times survey tallies the paydays for the heads of Warner Bros. Discovery, Netflix and more. The issue has become a hot topic on picket lines during the writers\u2019 strike.\nIn 2018, Musk agreed to forgo a cash salary for his work at Tesla and instead receive stock options based on his ability to meet company milestones. Board members argue that the value Musk brings to the company is worth hefty compensation.\n\u201cWe can all agree that Elon has delivered the transformative and unprecedented growth that was required to earn all milestones of the 2018 CEO Performance Award,\u201d the board\u2019s special committee wrote. \u201cRetaining Elon is more important than ever before.\u201d"

      "text": "People are melting their old jewelry for cash as gold prices soar\n- Share via\nWith gold prices at record highs, jewelry collectors are in meltdown mode.\nFor weeks, they\u2019ve been scouring their homes and cracking open their safes to retrieve vintage necklaces, family heirlooms and other expensive pieces containing the precious metal that can be melted for cash.\n\u201cIt happens with every gold spike,\u201d said Jeff Clark, a market analyst and founder of TheGoldAdvisor.com. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a lot of old gold jewelry, it\u2019s basically free money.\u201d\nThe price of gold hit an all-time high of $3,357 per ounce on Thursday and is up about 27% from the beginning of the year, driven by factors including geopolitical tensions, tariff turmoil and increased demand from central banks.\nGov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday announced a lawsuit alleging that President Trump lacks the authority to enact the international tariffs without the support of Congress.\nGold has long been considered a safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty, viewed by investors as a hedge against inflation and stock market volatility. And, when demand is strong, items made with gold can be lucrative for owners to offload.\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s like, \u2018If I have some gold jewelry, if my grandparents or my mother or father left me something, maybe I can get some money for it since everything else is down and inflation is killing everyone\u2019s purchasing power and consumption,\u2019\u201d said Alex Arakeloglu, a sales associate at Capri Jewelry in downtown Los Angeles. \u201cI hear it all around the Jewelry District.\u201d\nThe influx of customers looking to trade in or sell their gold pieces has been a boon for independent jewelers, who have been grappling with steep wholesale prices for new items amid the latest gold rush. Many are also worried that President Trump\u2019s tariffs could further drive up costs for imported precious metals and diamonds.\nOn a recent Monday afternoon, Rosie Juda arrived at her longtime jeweler\u2019s second-floor L.A. studio with plastic bags full of gold jewelry, some of which had been in her family for generations.\nThere\u2019s still gold in them thar hills. As the price of the precious metal climbs to record highs, prospectors are buying up claims in the Mojave Desert to seek their fortune. But it\u2019s the real estate agents who have the sure bet.\nSpreading the glimmering pieces on a glass-topped table between them, Olivia Kazanjian, owner of Jewelry by Olivia K, examined each with a loupe: rings set with blue and red gemstones, an inscribed cigarette case, a chunky necklace with large shiny beads, sea urchin-shaped clip-on earrings from Tiffany & Co., a whimsical clown figurine with a wide grin.\n\u201cWell, it turns out you made some really good choices investing in gold,\u201d Kazanjian said as she placed the items one by one on a scale. For pieces of unknown purity, she performed a quick scratch test using an acid kit to help determine the metal\u2019s karat composition.\nLately, Kazanjian has seen \u201ca revolving door\u201d of clients eager to melt their jewelry collections. But she\u2019s urging caution.\n\u201cSometimes it\u2019s very clear when you get jewelry in that\u2019s like, \u2018Nope. This is not to be melted, you\u2019ve got to hold onto this,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAntique pieces are not worth it \u2014 you\u2019ll never, ever see that craftsmanship again.\u201d\nFor Juda, 56, it\u2019s about taking advantage while gold is a hot commodity. The timing is especially fortuitous, with two daughters in college and hefty tuitions to pay.\n\u201cPriorities in your life change. Do I want all this stuff sitting in the safety deposit box?\u201d the retired set decorator said. \u201cLet it go, it\u2019s just time.\u201d\nOver the next two hours, jeweler and collector pored over nearly 40 pieces, separating them into neat piles. Kazanjian persuaded Juda to keep some of the rarer items as-is, and will redesign a few others to give them a fresh look.\nThe largest was the melt pile, a mound of discarded jewelry for which Kazanjian offered to pay Juda $9,500 \u2014 a figure she calculated by estimating the grams of pure gold in each piece and multiplying it by the current market price of the metal, before subtracting melting and processing fees. She\u2019ll write Juda a check at the end of the session and take the items to a refinery in the Jewelry District.\nThere are dozens of businesses downtown that will melt gold. One of the largest precious metal refiners is Elemetal, which operates more than 45 locations around the country. A manager for the downtown L.A. branch said he wasn\u2019t authorized to comment on the business, citing its high-value transactions and carefully vetted clients.\nOn its website, Elemetal says its specialized facilities melt gold sources such as scrap jewelry and impaired bullion to separate impurities and obtain refined gold. It works with jewelers, miners, pawnbrokers and dealers to \u201cconvert materials into marketable, high-purity gold products while ensuring transparency and competitive settlements.\u201d\nIt happens with every gold spike. If you\u2019ve got a lot of old gold jewelry, it\u2019s basically free money.\n\u2014 Jeff Clark, a gold market analyst and founder of TheGoldAdvisor.com\nAs the price of gold has surged, businesses in the Jewelry District have been taking extra security precautions.\nThis week, millions of dollars in gold and jewels were stolen from a downtown L.A. jeweler\u2019s two safes after burglars tunneled into the shop through multiple reinforced walls. The FBI is working with Los Angeles police to investigate the heist at Love Jewels, where officials said the thieves cut through a room next to the gold merchant and made off with about $10 million worth of merchandise.\nDespite the current mania, Clark, the gold market analyst, noted that jewelry owners bringing in old pieces \u201cprobably won\u2019t get rich off of it.\u201d\nMany will try nonetheless. During a previous spike in gold prices, Clark said, people were asking morticians for permission to pull gold teeth from the mouths of dead family members.\n\u201cYou can sell anything that has gold in it,\u201d he said. \u201cSome morgues will let you do it.\u201d"

      "text": "In-N-Out owner Lynsi Snyder says she is leaving California\n- Share via\nFor more than 75 years, In-N-Out Burger has been a pillar of California fast-food culture, its Double-Doubles and palm tree logos becoming fixtures of the West Coast landscape. But now, the family-owned chain is making a pivot eastward, with billionaire owner and Chief Executive Lynsi Snyder announcing her own departure from the Golden State.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of great things about California, but raising a family is not easy here. Doing business is not easy here,\u201d Snyder said during a recent appearance on the \u201cRelatable\u201d podcast, hosted by conservative commentator Allie Beth Stuckey.\nThe move to Tennessee represents a seismic shift for the leader of the brand. Currently operating more than 400 locations across eight states \u2014 California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Oregon, Colorado, Texas and Idaho \u2014 In-N-Out has long thrived on being the burger chain you couldn\u2019t find everywhere.\n\u201cI like that we\u2019re sought after when someone\u2019s coming into town. I like that we\u2019re unique. that we\u2019re not on every corner,\u201d Snyder told Forbes in 2018. \u201cYou put us in every state, and it takes away some of its luster.\u201d\nBut times, and Snyder\u2019s position, have changed. The company announced plans in January 2023 to establish a corporate office in Franklin, Tenn., by 2026. In California, the company is consolidating its corporate operations to Baldwin Park, the chain\u2019s birthplace.\nThe migration reflects a broader corporate exodus from California, with businesses and some billionaires leaving. Tesla, Charles Schwab and Chevron are among the companies that have moved, citing regulatory challenges, operational costs and policy disagreements.\nDuring the podcast, Snyder discussed elements of California policy that make the state hard to operate in, specifically referencing pandemic-era restrictions as particularly challenging.\nIn-N-Out started in 1948 when Harry and Esther Snyder opened their first location on a small piece of land in Baldwin Park. With little money, they created what would become the first drive-through burger chain.\nI wrote the book on In-N-Out. Here\u2019s why Julia Child kept a list of its restaurant locations in her purse.\nFrom those humble beginnings, the chain grew into a part of Southern California mythology, attracting devoted fans from Michelin-starred chefs to celebrities such as Julia Child, who kept a map of all In-N-Out locations in her purse.\nHarry and Esther Snyder\u2019s granddaughter Lynsi became president in 2010 at age 27, making her one of America\u2019s youngest billionaires. Under her leadership, she has largely followed the path set down by her grandparents, maintaining the company\u2019s founding principles and her grandfather\u2019s own motto: \u201cKeep it simple, do one thing and do it the best you can.\u201d\nAlthough at one point Snyder said the company wouldn\u2019t expand further east than Texas, her views have changed. She told Stuckey that \u201cthe bulk of our stores are still going to be here in California.\u201d The relocation of both corporate operations and the CEO signals a fundamental change in the company\u2019s center of gravity.\n\u201cIt will be wonderful having an office out there, growing out there, and being able to have the family and other people\u2019s families out there,\u201d Snyder said, though she maintains limits on expansion.\n\u201cFlorida has begged us, and we\u2019re still saying no,\u201d she said on the podcast. \u201cThe East Coast states, we\u2019re still saying no.\u201d\nIn-N-Out did not respond to a request for comment."

This decision has caused turmoil in the bullion markets, leading to a surge in futures prices that later corrected after clarification from the White House. The ruling raises significant concerns about the future of gold trading in the U.S. and its implications for global bullion flows, particularly affecting Swiss refiners who play a crucial role in the market.",
