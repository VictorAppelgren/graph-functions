      "feedback": "Your draft captures the key drivers but falls short of a world‑class swing‑trade outlook. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly linking Fed dovishness to risk‑on sentiment and to the 85 % cut probability (17F49LURJ) rather than treating them as separate lines. Collapse the two “Up” lines into one 1–3 week driver that combines the dovish stance and the 25 bp cut probability, and give the “Down” line a concrete trigger (e.g., a CPI > 3.5 % or jobs > 200 k) with a 15 % probability that cites (17F49LURJ). Replace the vague “Rapid AI displacement” with a quantified risk: a 10 % jump in AI‑adoption metrics that would erode consumer confidence, citing (1GVYF2V8O). For the 3–6 month “Up” line, anchor the soybean price range ($10–$12/mt) and the 60 % probability to the supply‑shock data (J54PXL0NV). In the Outlook line, drop the “5–10 % upside” which is too vague; instead state a target range (e.g., BTC $115–$125k, ETH $5,200–$5,600) and tie it to the Fed dovish stance, oil inventory data (J99EM2TPZ), and euro CPI (R3WNA7L7A). Ensure every probability is derived from a cited source and that the total probability mass across scenarios sums to 100 %. Finally, remove the extraneous “(R3WNA7L7A) | 60” at the end of the Outlook line and keep the format strictly to the required single line. This will sharpen the causal logic, improve quantification, and align the output with the prescribed format.",
