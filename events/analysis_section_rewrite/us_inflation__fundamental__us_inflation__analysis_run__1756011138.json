      "feedback": "Your draft is a good start but falls short of a world‑class, multi‑year structural analysis. Add a first‑principles framework: quantify real‑rate differentials (US vs Eurozone), terms‑of‑trade, productivity growth, BoP and net external position, and policy reaction functions (Fed rate hikes, tariff adjustments). Define the current regime (tech‑growth vs automotive‑headwinds) and the transition conditions (tariff escalation, EV‑credit phase‑out, R2 launch, robotaxi milestones). Build a coherent causal chain to pricing: productivity → cloud/AI revenue → earnings → dividend sustainability → valuation for Microsoft/Shopify; cost‑structure → margins → profitability → valuation for Rivian/Tesla. Include a scenario structure: base case (cloud growth + R2 breakeven 2027), upside (AI acceleration, R2 volume > 200k), downside (tariff spike >15%, robotaxi delay). Add specific catalysts/triggers (R2 production ramp 2026, Tesla robotaxi regulatory approval, Fed rate decisions) and invalidation points (tariff hike >10%, oil price spike). Quantify all key metrics with ranges and cite the source IDs: e.g., Microsoft revenue $76.4 B (0G3A676BP), Azure growth 39% (0G3A676BP), Shopify revenue $2.7 B, net income $906 M (0G3A676BP), Tesla gross margin 17.9% (P0K0UEOHU), Rivian first quarterly gross profit $170 M (P0K0UEOHU), EV credit $7,500 (P0K0UEOHU), tariffs 10% (4LQD15CFU). Integrate Donegal (TN66GHPAT) dividend yield decline and Ford’s 1976 discontinuation (JVKCZAPVG) to illustrate sectoral shifts. Reconcile any conflicting data (e.g., cloud growth vs AI adoption slowdown) by noting sector‑specific lag. Finally, state a confidence rating (moderate‑high) and watch signals (Fed rates, tariff changes, R2 ramp, robotaxi milestones). Ensure every fact has a citation ID and that the paragraph stays within the required length/format.",
