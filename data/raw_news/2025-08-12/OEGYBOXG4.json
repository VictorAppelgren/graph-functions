  "description": "Z-Ben Advisors' Peter Alexander says Chinese stocks will likely outperform developed markets in the coming months, with further advances in AI and a meeting between Presidents Trump and Xi among the major catalysts. He speaks on \"Bloomberg: The China Show.\" (Source: Bloomberg)",
  "content": "You've been talking about what's happening on the ground and how really sentiment has really shifted to risk on among Chinese investors. It's it's beginning to shift the risk on. And I think, David, the chart that you just put up is fantastic because if you look at the CSI bank index, it's sold off in the last month and a half. And the bank index, because of the dividend trade, was actually the most one of the more popular trades by the Chinese retail Chinese investors broadly because they were looking for something that was a little bit safer. And if you looked at yields, yields were plumbing lows, so on and so forth. And there's been a reversal of late. You're starting to actually even see the ten year yield is starting to slowly pick up. Now, why is that? Not because of deflation or anything, but so much money has flowed into fixed income instruments in China that when it flows the opposite way, flows out, it actually has an impact on an increasing yield. We were talking earlier on, before we went back on TV that look at Hong Kong, half of the volume in Hong Kong this year through stock Connect is the real trade that people are need to pay attention to. We think that there has been an ultimate shift of risk off to risk on. And you've talked about the Shanghai Composite. I'll make the statement that right now you're going to see the CSI 300 radically outperform developed markets, including the S & P over the next year, the world's most hated trade. I'm down here for a whole week trying to explain the opportunity that China has for equity investors. Look at liquidity globally. Nobody wants to hear it. Nobody wants to hear anything about the opportunity that Chinese A-shares have for asset allocators. What's the case for A-shares? Because most of that liquidity, to your point, has so far come to Hong Kong. Like what? What what will change in your view? Well, predominantly it's a relative valuation. I mean, global investors to begin with rational individuals. You were talking about the the Nikkei at an all time high, the DAX at an all time high. Everybody's at an all time high. And yet I think the Hang Seng is still 20% off the all time high and the CSI is 30 odd percent off the all time high, 13 times trailing earnings versus low 30 times trailing earnings elsewhere. So I think rationally, investors, both locally and globally, are going to just wake up with this flood of money from liquidity and say, where's the next great trade? China is going to be. It is the earnings momentum there, because when you talk about U.S. markets, that's where people say, I need to stick to the max seven the like because I'm still getting that resilience and invisible. Yeah, no, that's the big question of the fundamentals. The fundamentals are uncertain. There's an inflection point or I should say multiple inflection points throughout the economy, whether it's property deleveraging, Can the shift from old economy to new economy happen? I mean, one of the comments I've made to groups is deep sea 2.0 is coming. And when it comes, that could be a catalyst. You may follow this robotics company called Union Trigger, unitary, unitary. That's going to listen. That could be a catalyst. But I think the ultimate catalyst you alluded to earlier on is going to be when Trump and Xi Jinping me and there's going to be a you know, I call it the Taiwan for TikTok tariff agreement, where, you know, they're going to come to some agreement, they're going to highlight what's going on with Taiwan. Trump's going to get ultimately his poisoned chalice, which is going to be the the tick tock platform that I think is going to ultimately be the real catalyst going into next year that will get people interested in China. The message, though, is to the point you're here trying to market that message, right? Your audience? No. The incremental buys in the U.S., I mean, part of the audience here understands that, I think already. And I wonder what I think two part question. One is how receptive has the audience been here in Hong Kong? How receptive do you think the audience will be across the Pacific? Obviously with the China, Hong Kong, the Hong Kong investors, broadly speaking, understand it, but still are very reticent. I'd rather just stay in Hong Kong and get my play that way, which is understandable. So you can imagine that if I were to extend the conversation even to Europeans, God forbid the Americans. You know, I've had clients tell me, look, Peter, we can't even raise the concept of a China allocation with our institutional investors. They told us if we do so, you won't get fired because it's that much of a, you know, the so-called hated trade. I think over time, people are just going to forget their priors. They're going to look at the opportunity and they'll start slowly, quietly reallocating back into the mainland. Is it just because they've just been burned so badly before? It's still the scars from that. There's a little bit of that, but it's predominantly the headlines. If you're in the United States, in New York or Boston or Chicago, and you're being pounded by exit bans and all of this nonsense, why would you I mean it career risk, why would you add anything? And if you do, just go to Hong Kong, that's a little bit easier, which is why I think you've seen some. But I think over time that will gravitate back to the mainland. What do you make of this anti-evolution conversation and whether or not that brings back the earnings that we were just making the point valuations aren't isn't quite as evident just yet. So. The whole concept of supply, right? Which is the way that I try to talk about anti involution is just a very Chinese word. This is China competition one on one. You have five or six or ten companies come into an industry. Just happened for the longest time. Do you remember the rental bike industry? We used to be ten of them. Ultimately, what happens? They fight it out. Then the government comes in and says, okay, we're going to start putting up new barriers. You have to then address those barriers, which is what we're seeing now, let's say, with EVs. And then after that, you typically come down with two, maybe three really strong competitors. So this is not anything new. I think it's just a center of focus because of the whole China overcapacity concerns that are being addressed globally. But this is I've seen this on a host of different industries over the last 30 years. Right. This makes, I think, raw, brute force competition makes the Chinese the stronger. So they're going to move from market share, grab to earnings, how long it takes. That's what I think the analyst industry has to really focus on. Yeah, I mean, Diamond Sharp is diamond, right? You take the domestic name outside. But the question, I think when you look domestic, I think I'll use the the the bike analogy that you just made. You put out a story back then where it was this graveyard of used bikes. And the question is, do we wait to that point where they just kill each other or do you need to step in and save some of the margin and earnings? And is that starting to show up? Extreme competition in EVs. We know that. Financial services. Services, Yes. What's the what's what's your take on what's going? It's interesting, you know, when we're trying to look at what potential catalyst you might see over the course of the next several months that would lead to demand for shares. It is M & A. You know, you mentioned financial services. We had two major securities companies merge. Right. We're looking at shipping, massive shipping merger happened. Was it six months ago now with Costco? We've just seen, I think, a chip business that was merged a couple of them. So I believe that there is a learning from last mistakes within sort of the governing policy members. And they are stepping in right now to try to get to the point where this does not become a a massive issue, overcapacity, prices decline, you name it. Again, the real issue is can they get it done in time? People have to make up their own mind. Okay. You're making this pitch to investors in Hong Kong. What is the pitch then for A-shares? What's what's the sector? What's what's the what's the trade? I think it's I mean, we're not looking specifically at stocks. What we're looking at is either beta or alpha, which is we think all investors, if they do not have an allocation to Asia renminbi securities, they should be at least going into some sort of beta play, whether it's the CSI 300, MSCI, China, whatever the case might be. However, if you look back at 2021 or 2015 or even, God forbid, 27, this is a market that was made for active managers. So if you're out looking for mandates, you should be looking and talking to all the big managers because there has been a demonstrable ability to deliver in excess of these indices. But having those conversations live on right now is impossible. People just don't want to they don't even want to entertain the idea, What are you here for? You beta all you have. And it's only it's only day two. Yeah, well, let's hope deep seek to win outcomes. What are you hearing on that? I literally have the rumors bubbling about that. It's this week I to speculate. But yes. No, I genuinely think it's something that will probably happen in September. I believe Liang and the team over there are a little bit smarter when it comes to the timing of it. And if you look just in the past week, I mean, I think the folks at Openai had a very hard week trying to go open source and this is a subject for another day. But watching this pitched battle between closed and open sourced models between the United States and China is fascinating. I did not, as they like to say, have on my bingo card. China was going to be the driver of open source A.I. And ultimately, you know, how is it that this closed source system is going to be a viable scaled business going forward? I joked with a client yesterday, I said, Steve Case showing my age, called up and said he wants his AOL business model back because it's a it's a closed guarded right. And that's what whether it's anthropic or open A.I. or ZII, they're predominantly closed architectures. China just iterates and iterates and iterates every single day, every single week.",

  "summary": "David Wong, author of the China Stock Exchange, has highlighted that sentiment has shifted to risk on among Chinese investors, suggesting that the CSI bank index is beginning to shift the risk on. This shift is not due to deflation or anything, but due to large amounts of money flowing into fixed income instruments in China, which has significantly impacted the yield. Wong argues that the Shanghai Composite is likely to outperform developed markets over the next year. He also points out that half of the volume in Hong Kong this year through stock Connect is from China, and that the next catalyst is expected to be when Trump and Xi Jinping agree on a Taiwan for TikTok tariff agreement. Wong suggests that China's potential as a major market catalyst for the country's economy, with the Nikkei at an all time high, while the DAX at all time highs and the CSI at all-time high, the Hang Seng at 20% off the all-term high, and the Shanghai composite at 30% off its all-year high. However, he also notes that the potential for China's growth is to be influenced by the ongoing dispute with the US and China's strong earnings momentum.",
