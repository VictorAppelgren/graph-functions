      "feedback": "Overall, the draft largely strings macro/policy signals into one narrative but fails to (a) spell out a testable horizon, (b) articulate a formal causal chain from policy to valuations, (c) present a structured scenario framework with catalysts/invalidation, and (d) deliver a tight, number-backed watch-list. Actionable edits: define a clear horizon (multi-year regime with near-term concrete catalysts and an explicit policy/inflation context); build a first-principles causal chain: Fed policy/path real rates relative to inflation drives cost of capital, which compresses multiples; productivity/AI gains modulate earnings power and justify premium placement for durable franchises; energy disinflation from oil oversupply buffers inflation and informs policy; tariff stability alters cross-border flows and pricing; anchor each link to a cited driver (TN66GHPAT for cost of capital/dividends, J99EM2TPZ for oil, RHXDOHQQX for tariff/truce, 4LQD15CFU for AI/productivity); quantify where possible with the exact ranges and magnitudes in the sources (1.8–2.2% dividend yield, 12–18% justness premium, 2.5 million bpd 2025 oil-supply rise, 90-day tariff truce, MFN ~15% on 70% of EU goods, 750B energy purchases and 600B in U.S. investment, etc.). Replace the placeholder “IntelOrbis Graph” with concrete beneficiaries (AI-enabled, durable franchises) and tie earnings leverage explicitly to the productivity signal. Adopt a formal three-scenario framework (base: regime drifts along current path; upside: AI-productivity surprise lifts margins; downside: tariff/friction or oil-driven inflation surprises disrupt the path) with defined catalysts, timing, and explicit invalidation rules (e.g., if IBM-like productivity signals fail to widen dispersion or if oil-price paths invert the disinflationary impulse, or if the tariff truce is renewed or escalates beyond 90 days). The watch-list should be a concise, 5-signal menu: IBM/AI-productivity signal evolution; IEA/J99EM2TPZ oil-supply/demand inflection; renewal/renegotiation trajectory of the 90-day tariff truce (RHXDOHQQX); Fed commentary on real-rate differentials vs inflation; and dispersion/justness premium behavior within cross-sectional cohorts (TN66GHPAT, 4LQD15CFU). Tighten citations so every factual claim anchors to the exact IDs after the assertion; ensure coverage of all critical sources and explicitly acknowledge cross-source tensions (e.g., disinflationary oil path vs potential energy-price shocks) with stated fragilities.",
