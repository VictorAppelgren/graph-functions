  "description": "It's going to be a stretched-out series",
  "content": "We won't be seeing South Park season 27 episode 4 just yet.\n\nSouth Park season 27 episode 4 hasn't aired again this week, and it's now the third in a series of ongoing delays. After its controversial premiere, both episodes 2 and 3 have had two-week gaps between them, with episode 4 now following suit (you can expect to see it on September 3 instead).\n\nParamount has now confirmed this schedule will continue for the entire duration of the 10-episode season, meaning we can now expect the (surely explosive) season finale on November 26.\n\nInitially, the studio hadn't given a reason why, or at least it hadn't publicly. With influential figures in the US Government blasting South Park's parodies on a near-daily basis, I'd already guessed that this could feed into why episodes were taking longer, especially given the Paramount+ exclusive post-credit scenes we're starting to see.\n\nPresident Trump has been naked in bed with the devil, US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem has shot puppies at point blank range, and Towelie's trip to Washington D.C. shone a spotlight on the city's National Guard deployment.\n\nBut ahead of South Park season 27 episode 4, we've finally got an explanation \u2013 and as it turns out, there are multiple reasons why we're seeing a lag on the launches.\n\nNot only does it feel like a smart move, I also think it's a huge positive. The creators show no signs of slowing down their scathing political parodies, so some breathing space between them could do us all the world of good.\n\n\"So much happens right now in just one day with Trump\"\n\nAccording to an interview with Deadline, the season 27 delays initially started with timing episode 2 to release in line with the show's 25th anniversary. Afterwards, a two-week schedule was continued in order to make sure episodes were completely up to date with real-world events.\n\nDeadline's source close to the South Park producers explained, \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing means this year\u2019s episodes need more time than usual to put together, to finish.\n\n\u201cSo much happens right now in just one day with Trump. No one\u2019s going to sacrifice getting it right, even if we have to push getting it to air, and if that makes the season longer, so be it.\u201d\n\nIn short, this means that everything is taking more time to make, which isn't surprising in a world with a news cycle that moves at breakneck speed.\n\nWhat's perhaps more surprising is that Paramount is totally fine with the changes. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to argue with what\u2019s working, \u201d an insider at the studio added. \u201cThe numbers are great, the show is getting a lot of attention \u2013 if they want to give us a 20-week season for 10-episodes, that\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nDeadline previously reported that the second episode of Season 27 drew 6.2 million global multi-platform viewers across Comedy Central and Paramount+ in its first three days, numbers which largely came from streaming. Clearly, taking more time is working for everyone, and perhaps this allows creators to cut even deeper with their political parody.\n\nCould this change how comedies, or any streamable series, are released in the future? Very possibly. But for now, there's a certain relief that comes with the empty space between the animated poundings.\n\nWith Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna now the latest to clap back at her South Park depiction, the new schedule will likely cool any political jets before anything gets messier than the tension and legal threats we saw through its two-year hiatus.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 Beth Dutton and Rip Wheeler spin-off: Everything we know about the sequel series to Yellowstone on Paramount+\n\u2022 Mayor of Kingstown season 4: everything we know so far about the hit Paramount+ show's return\n\u2022 New Paramount+ series Avatar: Seven Havens will succeed where the Last Airbender live-action adaptation couldn't, and that should make Netflix panic",

      "text": "South Park season 27 episode 3 disappoints Paramount+ subscribers again with another delay \u2013 here\u2019s when you can watch it and why we\u2019ve been left waiting\nComedy Central did not air South Park season 27 episode 3 on its expected release date (August 13), with the series now thought to continue next week instead. This also means it now won\u2019t be available on Paramount+ either. However, unlike the season\u2019s previous delay, the episode 3 delay was scheduled in advance. Instead, the network declared the day to be \u201cSouth Park day,\u201d running a marathon of fan-favorite episodes followed by the sitcom\u2019s pilot episode \u2018Cartman Gets an Anal Probe\u2019 in the typical 10pm ET timeslot.\nEpisode 2 was delayed after the show\u2019s controversial premiere, which featured the likes of a deepfaked Donald Trump with no clothes on and ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents shooting puppies and driving around ominously in large groups. Screenshots from the show were quickly used on both the White House and US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem\u2019s social accounts in order to try and recruit more people to join ICE.\nThe Department of Homeland Security (NHS) additionally told Newsweek: \u201cWe want to thank South Park for drawing attention to ICE law enforcement recruitment. We are calling on patriotic Americans to help us remove murderers, gang members, pedophiles, and other violent criminals from our country.\u201d\nIt\u2019s for this reason that I can\u2019t help but think the delay of South Park season 27 episode 3 has something more attached to it. It\u2019s certainly a conveniently timed break in the schedule, but given that season 27 has only been on for three episodes yet has suffered two delays already. Surely things aren\u2019t operating smoothly behind the scenes? We always know what we get into with the hit TV show, but that might no longer be to everybody\u2019s tastes.\nHas South Park season 27 hit a political snag after its season 3 delay? I wouldn\u2019t be surprised\nI don\u2019t need to spell out that the political and cultural landscape has remarkably changed in the last few years, and that\u2019s possibly to South Park\u2019s detriment. While real-world political and cultural affairs are offering a smorgasbord of inspiration, it also comes with a more critical lens. We\u2019ve already had the comments from the NHS, above, with Kristi Noem also weighing in on her portrayal as well. Before her secret post-credits scene was revealed, she responded during an interview on the Glenn Beck Program podcast, slamming her character\u2019s appearance: \u201cIt\u2019s so lazy to just constantly make fun of women for how they look. If they wanted to criticize my job, go ahead and do that. But clearly they can\u2019t \u2013 they just pick something petty like that.\u201d\nWhite House spokesperson Taylor Rogers also told Variety about the events of episode 1: \"Just like the creators of South Park, the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows. This show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention.\"\nThis won\u2019t be the last round of comments from political figures about what\u2019s happening on the show, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we see public conversations between the two sides on a weekly basis. I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if there\u2019s resistance to what\u2019s being shown behind the scenes, given nobody exactly comes across particularly well if they\u2019re being featured on South Park. We\u2019ve seen critics of the current US Government coming under fire or having their shows canceled (The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u2019s cancellation is a great example of this), so discussions about what should and shouldn\u2019t be parodied could be holding up episode releases.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nOf course, this is all speculation. We\u2019ve got no idea what the rest of South Park season 27\u2019s 10-episode run has in store for us, and I really hope Paramount and the show\u2019s creators can hold firm to delivering the creative vision they want to. I can\u2019t deny that I\u2019m worried about episodes 4-10, but I\u2019m also holding out hope. After all, South Park wouldn\u2019t be South Park if it wasn\u2019t near the knuckle and beyond, right?\nYou might also like\n- Beth Dutton and Rip Wheeler spin-off: Everything we know about the sequel series to Yellowstone on Paramount+\n- Mayor of Kingstown season 4: everything we know so far about the hit Paramount+ show's return\n- New Paramount+ series Avatar: Seven Havens will succeed where the Last Airbender live-action adaptation couldn't, and that should make Netflix panic\nJasmine is a Streaming Staff Writer for TechRadar, previously writing for outlets including Radio Times, Yahoo! and Stylist.

Spearheaded by Yellowstone's Taylor Sheridan alongside Hugh Dillon, it's one of the best shows on Paramount+ and there's plenty more where that came from.\nViewers have watched the McClusky family position themselves as power brokers acting as the go-between for police, criminals, inmates, prison guards and politicians. And leading the McClusky family? Mike (Jeremy Renner) as he navigates Kingstown, a place with a real lack of order, in hopes of digging his way out.\nHere's everything we can expect from release date speculation, predicted cast, plot rumors, and more.\nFull spoilers follow for Mayor of Kingstown seasons 1-3. Potential spoilers are also discussed for season 4.\nMayor of Kingstown season 4 release date prediction\nA post shared by Hugh Dillon (@hughdillon)\nA photo posted by on\nWhile Mayor of Kingstown season 4 doesn't have an exact release date, it does have a release window \u2013 and that's October.\nThanks to an Instagram post by the show's co-creator, Hugh Dillon, it was revealed on June 10 that season 4 had officially wrapped on production and will start streaming on Paramount+ in October.\nMayor of Kingstown season 4 trailer speculation\nWith filming wrapped on Mayor of Kingstown season 4 and an impending October release window in mind, I'd expect the trailer to arrive in September \u2013 and when it does, I'll post it here.\nIf we take a look at season 3's trailer release, it officially dropped on April 25 before the season arrived on June 2. That's just over a month before, which is the same gap as the trailer release to show launch of season 2.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMayor of Kingstown season 4 confirmed cast\nA post shared by Mayor of Kingstown (@mayorofkingstown)\nA photo posted by on\nSpoilers follow for Mayor of Kingstown season 1 to 3.\nThe Mayor of Kingstown season 4 cast has been growing in size with returning cast and newcomers alike. Here's who we can expect to star this time round:\n- Jeremy Renner as Mike McLusky\n- Hugh Dillon as Ian\n- Tobi Bamtefa as Deverin 'Bunny' Washington\n- Nishi Munshi as Tracy\n- Taylor Handley as Kyle McLusky\n- Hamish Allan-Headley as\n- Derek Webster as\n- Clayton Cardenas as Deputy Warden Torres\n- Edie Falco as Nina Hobbs\n- Lennie James as Frank Moses\n- Laura Benanti as Cindy Stephens\n- Derek Rivera as Cortez\nAs mentioned, there's already been a few casting announcements for Mayor of Kingstown season 4 including Edie Falco, Lennie James and Laura Benanti all revealed in the official Instagram post above.\nAnd, as per Deadline in January, Clayton Cardenas joined as Deputy Warden Torres: \"the right-hand man to the prison's new warden at Anchor Bay Prison\".\nAnother cast announcement, confirmed again by Deadline in June, is Derek Rivera. He'll be joining the cast for season 4 as Cortez: \"a young, cold, and measured Colombian Sicario in a recurring role\".\nMayor of Kingstown season 4 story synopsis and rumors\nFull spoilers follow for Mayor of Kingstown seasons 1-3. Potential spoilers for Mayor of Kingstown season 4.\nThe Mayor of Kingstown season 3 finale was tumultuous, to say the least. While a lot of issues were resolved, most importantly the Russian mafia which has had a chokehold on the McClusky family for three strong seasons, the stage is set for Mike to navigate new territory.\nIt also comes as no surprise really that new cast announcements have been made for Mayor of Kingstown season 4, considering the characters that were lost in season 3. There was Iris (Emma Laird) and Kareem (Michael Beach) met their untimely fates. And, Milo (Aidan Gillen), who seemingly returned from the dead to take over Konstantin, succeeding with the manipulation of Iris before being overpowered by Mike.\nMilo's return made Mike's plan to finally rid Kingstown of its Russian problem in the season 3 finale a little tricky, but he managed it all the same. For season 4 though, co-creator Hugh Dillon told The Hollywood Reporter that the season 3 finale: \"leaves a vacuum\".\nBut, he adds: \"And it will be filled, it's human nature\". But, who's next to step into the criminal abyss left behind by the eradication of the Russian mafia, we'll have to wait and see.\nThen, there was the shootout on the bridge during a confrontation with Bunny's game, which saw Kyle shoot at Robert to protect the innocent civilians around them.\nWhile this subsequently led to Kyle's arrest, it leaves the door open for Robert's story in season 4 given Evelyn is still hellbent on looking into him, despite him recovering in hospital from Kyle's shooting.\nIt's all speculation for now as the Mayor of Kingstown season 4 plot is kept firmly under wraps. And I'd expect no less from a show filled with complicated dynamics and brutal exchanges.\nThough, Dillon did say, when it comes to Mayor of Kingstown season 4: \"The scripts are graet, the characters great. And that's what we want to do. We don't want to leave any strone unturned. This show is very much rock 'n' roll\".\nWill there be more seasons of Mayor of Kingstown?\nMayor of Kingstown has a rather complicated relationship with renewals, especially after Jeremy Renner's serious accident in 2023 left the entire show hanging in the balance.\nBut, even after returning for season 3, it still took a few months to confirm the return of Mayor of Kingstown season 4 was happening. It appears though that the plan has always been for more.\nIn conversation with ScreenRant, Hugh Dillon reveals the aim has always been for multiple more seasons \u2013 with Taylor Sheridan already having planned an ending in season 7: \"Well, Taylor's my mentor, he has been. He's coached me, this was the first thing he ever wrote, and he was my acting coach.\n\"He coached me on 100 episodes of TV, and we would talk about this all the time. And when we first mapped it out, he's the king of knowing where it ends. I like intros, and I like explosive intros. And he has an ending for it in season 7\".\nDillon added: \"So, our goal is to get to that season 7, because that's as far as we can get, because that's where he's always had it\".\nWhether the show makes it that far is one thing, but if Sheridan has plans to extend its run with a multi-year deal at Paramount+ already in place, there's some real hope for more Mayor of Kingstown.

      "text": "South Park\u2019s unhinged secret season 27 episode 2 post-credits scene is only available to stream on Paramount+, and there\u2019s a good reason why\nAfter a lengthy wait following its controversial premiere, South Park season 27 episode 2 aired on Comedy Central on August 6, and boy did it go for the jugular. A deepfake of Donald Trump was joined by a miniature J.D. Vance, Krypto the superdog was shot out of the sky by US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, and right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk was\u2026 well, made fun of. Just a regular day in the sitcom, right? Wrong.\nFor starters, the Krypto reference was a parody of Noem disclosing in her 2024 memoir that she once shot and killed her dog on a family farm. She responded to the scene during an interview on the Glenn Beck Program podcast, slamming her character\u2019s appearance: \u201cIt\u2019s so lazy to just constantly make fun of women for how they look. If they wanted to criticize my job, go ahead and do that. But clearly they can\u2019t \u2013 they just pick something petty like that.\u201d Much like the official White House account, Noem also used a screenshot of her South Park character to try and recruit users to join ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement).\nBut did the South Park team stop there? Of course not! Not only did they fire back at the ICE recruitment posts on social media, but season 27 episode 2 features a scathing secret post-credits scene that can only be streamed on Paramount+.\nSouth Park season 27 episode 2 post-credit scene on Paramount+ goes even harder on Kristi Noem\nDidn\u2019t see this on TV? Here\u2019s the Paramount+ version of the end credits scene. pic.twitter.com/QAvMgQfU9tAugust 11, 2025\nSpoilers for South Park season 27 episode 2 ahead.\nIn short, it\u2019s even more bad news for Noem. In the post-credits scene, Noem essentially goes on a shooting spree in a pet store, opening fire on all of the poor puppies who are inside. One manages to escape, but Noem soon guns it down after catching up to it. Even for South Park, the scene is especially grim, and I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised it\u2019s a well-hidden secret. What did puppies do to deserve getting caught up in Noem\u2019s political crossfire?\nWhile no official reason has been given for why the post-credits scene wasn\u2019t included in the original broadcast, it\u2019s possible that it was added last minute after the White House and Noem both began to publicly respond to season 27, meaning it would have been too late to include in the live transmission. This might not necessarily be the case, though, and if it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s a dang good marketing ploy.\nIt\u2019s also a lot less obvious if you\u2019re going to double-down on your governmental criticisms on a streaming service than on cable TV (South Park season 27 is airing on Comedy Central). Paramount+ isn\u2019t likely to be repulsed by the idea either, drawing more viewers to their streaming service to see the post-credits scene in its entire episodic context. It\u2019s a shrewd move on all counts, even if it\u2019s making me a little nauseous and light-headed just by writing about it.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nIs this going to be the last of South Park season 27 airing subtly placed clapbacks and putting their subjects of parody on blast online?

      "text": "New Paramount+ series Avatar: Seven Havens will succeed where the Last Airbender live-action adaptation couldn't, and that should make Netflix panic\nSan Diego Comic Con 2025 has confirmed a new spinoff series from the Avatar: The Last Airbender universe will air on Nickelodeon then stream on Paramount+ in 2027, called Avatar: Seven Havens. As of writing, we\u2019ve got three Avatar: The Last Airbender related projects in the works. On top of the new spinoff, there\u2019s seasons 2 and 3 of Netflix\u2019s live action Avatar: The Last Airbender and standalone movie The Legend of Aang: The Last Airbender, both due to be released in 2026.\nIn Avatar: Seven Havens, we get to relive the glory of the original 2005 animation all over again, with a new young Earthbender who discovers she is the next Avatar after Korra, who was first introduced in The Legend of Korra. Original creators Michael DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko are also returning for the project, which will split its 26 episodes across two seasons. To top it all off, the first-look image confirms that the series is sticking to the classic 2D animation style that made it so popular in the first place.\nSo far, so good. Avatar: Seven Havens isn\u2019t putting a step wrong, and that should send alarm bells ringing at Netflix HQ. It\u2019s fair to say the reviews for season 1 of their Avatar adaptation were mixed at best, but with hype dying down before Avatar: The Last Airbender season 2 even comes out, it\u2019s Paramount+\u2019s time to shine.\nAvatar: Seven Havens is already running rings around Netflix\u2019s The Last Airbender remake\nWhile I love rewatching the original cartoon whenever I can, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever watch Netflix\u2019s version of Avatar: The Last Airbender again. The heart was completely missing, the chemistry between its bulging ensemble cast was barely there, and the storyline was incredibly ropey in too many season lulls, despite the visuals largely holding strong. As far as we\u2019re aware, season 2 is still in production, but Netflix is now set to be second-best to Seven Havens unless it gets its act together in the next two years.\nSure, it\u2019s not M. Night Shyamalan levels of awful (lest we forget his 2010 movie version), but why would fans not invest in an extension of the original animation instead? Seven Havens appears committed to elevating Aang\u2019s story to align with what\u2019s going on in 2025 society already feels second to none.\nHere\u2019s the full plot: \u201cSet in a world shattered by a devastating cataclysm. A young Earthbender discovers she\u2019s the new Avatar after Korra \u2013 but in this dangerous era, that title marks her as humanity\u2019s destroyer, not its savior. Hunted by both human and spirit enemies, she and her long-lost twin must uncover their mysterious origins and save the Seven Havens before civilization\u2019s last strongholds collapse.\u201d\nIf Seven Havens is as full of wonder, whimsy, and meaning as it\u2019s promising, then we could well see Netflix's Avatar viewership dwindle. Frankly, I\u2019ll be one of the fans who\u2019s more than happy to jump ship\u2026 it\u2019s been a long time since the journey to becoming the Avatar has filled our cup like it should.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nYou might also like\n- I watch Netflix for a living \u2013 here are the 7 new anime shows you need to to be ready for\n- Think Dandadan season 2 looks different on Netflix?

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: South Park fans and teeth-gnashing MAGA supporters are going to have to wait a little longer this season for new episodes of the biting satire from Matt Stone and Trey Parker.\nAfter airing the third episode of its 27th season on August 20, a new South Park once again will be absent this week from Comedy Central and Paramount+, and that looks to be the new normal for the rest of the show\u2019s 10-episode run this year.\nSo far, South Park\u2018s Donald Trump-pounding season is set to be back with another new episode on September 3, with the next new episode after that to follow on September 17. Announced by Paramount late last week, that schedule continues the week-on/week-off pattern the show has had since its delayed Season 27 premiered on July 23 with \u201cSermon on the Mount,\u201d an episode written and directed by Parker that focused on Jesus, Trump and Satan.\nWatch on Deadline\nRight now, though plans could shift, the current South Park production plan is to stick with such a schedule and have Season 27 run to around December 10, I hear.\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re doing means this year\u2019s episodes need more time than usual to put together, to finish,\u201d a source close to the South Park producers tells Deadline, noting how up-to-the-minute the show has been on Trump\u2019s attacks on democratic norms with ICE kidnappings, troops in the streets of L.A. and D.C. and a very dysfunctional affair with the Prince of Darkness (not Ozzy). \u201cSo much happens right now in just one day with Trump. No one\u2019s going to sacrifice getting it right, even if we have to push getting it to air, and if that makes the season longer, so be it.\u201d\nAll of which just fine with the folks at Paramount, A Skydance Corporation, I hear.\nRELATED: Former Comedy Central Chief Doug Herzog On Paramount\u2019s Future: \u201cYou Need To Blow It Up\u201d:\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to argue with what\u2019s working, \u201d an insider at the David Ellison-run company said with a laugh about the unconventional broadcasting of this year\u2019s new South Parks. \u201cThe numbers are great, the show is getting a lot of attention \u2014 if they want to give us a 20-week season for 10-episodes, that\u2019s OK.\u201d\nAs my colleague Katie Campione pointed out on August 13, \u201cthe second episode of Season 27 drew 6.2M global multi-platform viewers across Comedy Central and Paramount+ in its first three days. Mainly drawing from streaming (1.6 million viewers watch on Comedy Central according to L3 results), those numbers from Paramount for the \u2018Got a Nut\u2019 episode that saw VP JD Vance\u2019s South Park debut were up from the 6 million who watched the Season 27 opener on multiple platform \u201cParamount says that global streaming consumption of the long-running series from Trey Parker and Matt Stone has grown double digits in the first three days of Episode 2702\u2019s release, up 49% from the same period of streaming for the series post-premiere,\u201d Campione noted.\nRELATED: \u201cWell, I Finally Made It\u201d: JD Vance Responds To His Blistering \u2018South Park\u2019 Debut\nWith all that music to everyone\u2019s ears, reps for the WME-signed Parker and Stone did not respond to Deadline\u2019s request for comment on the schedule for the rest of South Park\u2019s 27th season. Neither did reps for Paramount brass.\nUnder the purview of Paramount Global ex-co-CEO George Cheeks, who is now CEO Ellison\u2019s Chair of TV Media, the equal-offender animated series is produced by South Park Digital Studios, a joint venture co-owned by Paramount and series creators Parker and Stone\u2019s Park County.\nBack after a two-year break of sorts filled with studio-on-studio legal battles, some potential friendly fire-ish legal battles, a beyond 11th hour five-year deal for Stone and Parker and a $1.5 billion exclusive five-year license agreement with Paramount+, South Park now will roll out 50 new episodes during the next half-decade. As a key ingredient of Ellison and streaming chief Cindy Holland\u2019s bid to supersize Paramount+ over the next few years, all of South Park\u2018s previous 26 seasons are now only on Paramount+ a.k.a. the home of the Taylor Sheridan Manoverse.\nSouth Park has been unwatchable and stupid for awhile now\nI love this season. I never got why they felt they had to do it all in a single week. Give em two weeks and the writing is clearly better.\nWhy can\u2019t a better show extend its season due to poking fun at Trump?\nI\u2019d love to have an extra 5-6 episodes of Star Trek Strange New Worlds, for example, even if they\u2019re time travel episodes.\nSouth park is controlled opposition.\nTHEY\u2019RE GETTING GREAT RATINGS, SOME SAY THE BEST RATINGS ANYONE HAS EVER SEEN!"

Launching without much fanfare on the Paramount Network back in June 2018 (HBO turned it down initially) the Kevin Costner-fronted show steadily drew in a bigger and bigger audience, as the series \u2013 which covered life in and around a ranch in Yellowstone, Montana \u2013 went out on a high in the final series five in 2024 with a viewership of more than 12 million people.\nBut the people, like the ranchers, wanted more. And spin-offs of the Dutton family were hastily assembled by creators Taylor Sheridan and John Linson. First were the prequels, 1883 and 1923, then the sequels and other Dutton-adjacent series (deep breath): The Madison (due out in 2025), Y: Marshalls, 1944, 6666 and, perhaps the most eagerly awaited of all the new series in the Yellowstone universe, a show that some have said will be called Dutton Ranch. But, hold fire! says Cole Hauser, who plays Rip Wheeler, as he told Fox News that: \u201cFirst of all, it's not [called] Dutton Ranch. That's not the name of it.\u201d\nSo, what do we know about the spin-off show that will see Kelly Reilly and Cole Hauser reprising their roles as Beth Dutton and Rip Wheeler? Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the neo-Western series so far, including cast members, potential plot and expected release date:\nBeth Dutton and Rip Wheeler Yellowstone spin-off: release date predictions\nNews first came out off a spin-off in December 2024 when Deadline reported: \u201cTaylor Sheridan, the mastermind behind Yellowstone and its ever-expanding universe, is working on the creative for the new show, which will likely feature other cast members from the mothership series alongside Reilly and Hauser.\u201d\nSince then, the most recent word is, according to Bloomberg, that this particular show is being pegged for a Fall launch in 2025, which would make this a very quick turnaround. Paramount+ are yet to confirm a release date, but we\u2019ll update this piece as soon as we find out.\nBeth Dutton and Rip Wheeler Yellowstone spin-off: is there a trailer yet?\nNo, there\u2019s nothing as yet \u2013 we\u2019ll let you know as soon as anything drops.\nBeth Dutton and Rip Wheeler Yellowstone spin-off: who is in the cast?\nExcitingly for the fans who weren\u2019t ready for Yellowstone to finish after five seasons, Kelly Reilly and Cole Hauser will be back in their legendary roles of Beth Dutton and Rip Wheeler, respectively. It\u2019s been suggested by several publications that other key characters from Yellowstone could also make a return, but so far, the only person confirmed is Finn Little who plays Carter.\nCarter arrived as a \u201ctroubled teen\u201d in season four, who met Beth in hospital, when both their fathers were dying. After Carter\u2019s dad dies of a drug addiction, Beth and Rip become Carter\u2019s guardians, and he comes to live and work with them on their ranch. Beth is unable to have children and doesn\u2019t see herself as maternal, yet she and Rip form a bond with Carter, and come to view him as family.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nBeth Dutton and Rip Wheeler Yellowstone spin-off: the potential plot\nWell, it\u2019s a series that will obviously have Beth and Rip at the heart of the action. At the end of season 5 of Yellowstone (spoilers ahead, if you\u2019re not up to date yet) the Dutton Ranch is no more, after being sold to the Broken Rock Reservation, allowing the land to be preserved as a protected reservation.\nBeth\u2019s father, John Dutton III, was murdered by a contract killer (by a gunshot to the head) hired by Jamie Dutton and Sarah Atwood, but it was staged to look like suicide. In the season\u2019s finale, Beth, who vowed revenge for her dad\u2019s death, stabs Jamie.\nAccording to Deadline, the spin-off is likely to pick up where season 5 ended. It will be \u201cled by Yellowstone characters, played by the same actors in the same present-day time frame; the new offshoot shares the most DNA with the mothership of any shows in the Yellowstone universe to date.\u201d\nHauser is remaining tight-lipped about the plot, also telling Fox News in May 2025: \"We can expect the same that we've been doing for the last seven years. Kelly and I are going and working our [expletive] off trying to create something special.\u201d\nMeanwhile, he told The Hollywood Reporter in June 2025: \u201cKelly and I, we're focused on [Rip and Beth's] relationship and our love together, and what we're going to get [them] into. I'm excited just like everybody else. I can't wait to see what they come up with. Hopefully, we'll start seeing stuff soon.\u201d We\u2019d hope so too, if the series is to be released by the end of the year.\nWhat are the other spin-offs, sequels and prequels of Yellowstone that we know about?\nThere will be two other offshoots soon joining the Beth and Rip series. The Madison (appearing on Paramount+), led by Michelle Pfeiffer as Stacy Clyburn, and Y: Marshals (on CBS) which will star Luke Grimes as Kayce Dutton, and which will be released in early 2026.\nAlongside this, there are two more series in the Yellowstone universe: 1944 (set during World War II and will explore the Dutton family's experiences during that era) and 6666 (about another ranch, Four Sixes, which also appears in Yellowstone and will be about the characters who live on it) which have been previously announced as \u201cin development\u201d.\nLaura Martin is an entertainment journalist who covers TV, film, and music.

      "text": "Towelie wasn\u2019t even the worst part of South Park season 27 episode 3 \u2013 just wait for the ending\nHe's just an innocent towel who wanted to see the sights\nWell, I said South Park season 27 episode 3 would be unhinged, and it didn't let me down. Towelie headed to Washington D.C. against the backdrop of the National Guard being deployed on its streets, something that President Trump made happen in real life on August 11. He should of been just a small town towel, living in a lonely world who took the midnight bus going anywhere, to paraphrase Journey. But this is South Park, so obviously he didn't merely pop by The Smithsonian for the afternoon.\nBut should we be surprised? Not only do we know what kinds of parodies the show historically leans into, but South Park season 27 has particularly come out all guns blazing against the current US government. In as little as two episodes, the show's creators have managed to deepfake a naked version of Trump (who now comes with a miniature sidekick in J.D. Vance), show US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem shooting puppies in a pet store, and featured ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) agents so heavily that the White House started using screenshots for recruitment purposes on social media.\nA naive part of me thought that shifting to Towelie's perspective would be more gentle after the show's controversial premiere and subsequent scheduled break, but I was wrong. Instead, the gates of hell quite literally opened in a brand-new way, and now I'm so disturbed by what the parody really means, I can't sleep.\nSouth Park season 27 episode 3's ending keeps Towelie and Satan stuck in Trump's personal hell\nDon't get me wrong: South Park showing Satan and Trump as being... overly chummy... isn't a new concept. Fans saw them in bed together during episode 1, with a naked Trump trying to get Satan to be intimate with him. The White House hit back soon after, describing [via BBC] the Paramount+ series as a \"fourth-rate\" show that was \"hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention\". Co-creator later gave a mock apology during a panel at San Diego Comic Con.\nThis is all disturbing enough, but episode 3 reveals the truth behind why Satan is at the White House in the first place \u2013 rather than Trump being under Satan's spell, Satan is being held against his will in Trump's own personal hell, where Towelie soon joins him. After being propositioned by Trump, Satan goes to the bathroom, stating: \u201cWhat am I doing here?\u201d\nTowelie then tells him, \u201cplease, I want to get out of here,\u201d with Satan replying: \u201cSo do I, but there is no escape from this place.\u201d Cue the fan reactions. \"Both Satan and Towelie stuck in Trump\u2019s hell. This season is unreal. Paramount got their money\u2019s worth for South Park,\" said one on X/Twitter, with another adding: \"Satan and Towelie both trapped at the White House with Trump is honestly the darkest ending this season so far.\"\nTrying to follow the plot line. Satan sent Saddam to heaven with the Mormons so that he'd stop bothering Satan in hell. Then Satan went to heaven... was that because he died trying to save everyone from man-bear-pig? If someone knows, please save me from searching for the old\u2026August 21, 2025\nI couldn't agree more, but we're also seeing a parody of a parody here. You might remember from previous South Park episodes that Satan had exactly the same bed scene with Saddam Hussein, which basically prompts theories on its own merit. As one fan put it: \"Trying to follow the plot line. Satan sent Saddam to heaven with the Mormons so that he'd stop bothering Satan in hell. Then Satan went to heaven... was that because he died trying to save everyone from man-bear-pig?\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\n\"If someone knows, please save me from searching for the old episodes. So now Trump clearly has Saddam's voice and personality. I'm sure that'll become relevant to the story at some point.\"\nI'm honestly not sure if I care about the lore too much thanks to the latest South Park scene leaving me incredibly disturbed about what's going on in the real world.

We\u2019re now back on track with South Park Elementary counselor Mr. Mackey being fired due to budget cuts, then getting a job with United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in the latest episode.

We\u2019ve seen a deepfaked version of President Donald Trump in full nude mode in episode 1, with episode 2 quickly following up with the horrific death of Superman\u2019s sidekick Krypto, who gets shot in the head by US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem (RIP, you were a good boy to the very end).\nBut for me, the best critique of US politics from South Park this week wasn\u2019t even seen in episode 2. If you\u2019ve been chronically online over the last few days, you might know what I\u2019m talking about. If you\u2019re a well-rounded, rational person with hobbies and a life (unlike myself), let me catch you up.\nSouth Park claps back at The White house in this major burn not seen in season 27 episode 2\nWait, so we ARE relevant?#eatabagofdicks https://t.co/HeQSMU86DaAugust 5, 2025\nAs I\u2019ve touched on, ICE is coming under heavy fire in South Park season 27, making up a prevalent part of both episodes we\u2019ve seen so far. However, in an unexpected turn of events, the White House has tried to use being the butt of the joke to their advantage. As you can see from the X/Twitter post above, the White House\u2019s official account posted a (pretty sinister looking) screenshot of South Park-ed versions of ICE agents in order to try and recruit people to join their ranks. Not only was the post immediately criticised by fans, but the South Park creators themselves, who replied: \u201cwait, so we ARE relevant? #eatabagofd*cks.\u201d\nNot only is the show no stranger to parodying Trump long before season 27 arrived on the scene, the clapback is a direct response to a Variety interview with White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers on the events of episode 1. \"Just like the creators of South Park, the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows,\u201d Rogers said in response to the deepfake. \u201cThis show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention.\"\nThe Department of Homeland Security (NHS) additionally told Newsweek: \u201cWe want to thank South Park for drawing attention to ICE law enforcement recruitment. We are calling on patriotic Americans to help us remove murderers, gang members, pedophiles, and other violent criminals from our country.\u201d\nIt\u2019s too early to tell yet, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if episode 2 rivals the astonishing viewing figures of season 27 episode 1 (that received 6 million), making it the highest-watched South Park episode since 1999. The X post in question currently has 15.2 million views, meaning there\u2019s a good chance more people will be tuning in as the weeks go on. If we\u2019re being honest, the show is likely only just getting started with its scathing satirizations of Trump and the US government, so I\u2019d suggest keeping one eye on new episodes and the other on their social channels.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nYou might also like\n- Beth Dutton and Rip Wheeler spin-off: Everything we know about the sequel series to Yellowstone on Paramount+\n- Mayor of Kingstown season 4: everything we know so far about the hit Paramount+ show's return\n- New Paramount+ series Avatar: Seven Havens will succeed where the Last Airbender live-action adaptation couldn't, and that should make Netflix panic\nJasmine is a Streaming Staff Writer for TechRadar, previously writing for outlets including Radio Times, Yahoo! and Stylist.

      "text": "South Park season 27 episode 3 is bringing back one of its most unhinged characters, and I\u2019m already scared\nTowelie's back, tell a friend. South Park season 27 episode 3 just got messy.\nSouth Park season 27 episode 3 has already been delayed by a week thanks to a planned break in the schedule, but judging by the first-look trailer, it was well worth the wait. It's reintroducing Towelie, the talking towel first seen all the way back in season 5. This time, he's set to take on the National Guard as he visits Washington DC \u2013 and I\u2019m already dreading what\u2019s to come.\nAfter its controversial premiere and a second episode showing US Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem shooting puppies in a pet store, the Paramount+ show is holding nothing back against the current US government. Unsurprisingly, the start of season 27 has drawn a lot of public criticism from those featured, which now includes a naked version of Donald Trump and a much smaller version of JD Vance. If anything, switching to Towelie's perspective is an incredibly smart move.\nWhile we don't yet know what will happen in South Park season 27 episode 3 other than the initial teaser of Towelie getting off a bus in front of the US Capitol (which you can see below), a talking towel can't be taken as seriously as any human character seen facing off against political parodies. However, longtime fans of the show will understand how much damage Towelie could actually do... and frankly, I'm dreading it.\nTowelie heads to Washington D.C. in South Park season 27 episode 3, and that's dangerous\n\u201cSickofancy\u201d: Towelie goes to Washington, D.C.South Park\u2019s 27th season continues this Wednesday, August 20 at 10/9c on Comedy Central and next day on Paramount+. pic.twitter.com/HVzao5ii4DAugust 20, 2025\nIn his initial character description that can be found on South Park Fandom, Towelie \"is usually seen either appearing out of nowhere to give towel advice to the citizens of South Park or getting high\". If there has ever been a sensible decision made by anyone living in South Park, I've yet to see it, and my best guess tells me that any advice given to our political parodies is either going to fall on deaf ears or escalate the situation. As you can see from the above clip, the National Guard has been deployed in the heart of Washington DC, with President Trump also deploying troops to the capital in real life as of August 11, 2025.\nThere's bound to be references to the US Capitol insurrection of January 6, 2021, especially considering the famous DC museum The Smithsonian changed an exhibit's wording on August 8 to recant Trump's involvement in inciting the violence. In short, it's the hottest national topic South Park could have chosen to illustrate, and surely nobody is coming out the other side unscathed.\nPerhaps I'm being too pessimistic and Towelie will merely be able to reconnect with his long-lost son Washcloth against the backdrop of tanks and deployed soldiers, showing him the city's cultural offerings before anything further changes. But let's face it, that's not what we're doing here. Given that Towelie is almost always high, you best bet that Washington DC's views on marijuana are also going to be featured, and maybe, just maybe, we'll see some others indulging too.\nI won't be surprised if Paramount+ follows in the footsteps of episode 2 and offers up another exclusive post-credits scene, either to show more content that couldn't be broadcast on cable TV (South Park airs on Comedy Central) or to add new scenes they've created since the episode was originally submitted. This is speculation for the time being, but I'd say it's worthwhile keeping an eye out.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nYou might also like\n- Beth Dutton and Rip Wheeler spin-off: Everything we know about the sequel series to Yellowstone on Paramount+\n- Mayor of Kingstown season 4: everything we know so far about the hit Paramount+ show's return\n- New Paramount+ series Avatar: Seven Havens will succeed where the Last Airbender live-action adaptation couldn't, and that should make Netflix panic\nJasmine is a Streaming Staff Writer for TechRadar, previously writing for outlets including Radio Times, Yahoo! and Stylist.

      "text": "South Park hit yet another home run with Season 27\u2019s continued jokes about the Trump administration.\nThe second episode of Season 27 drew 6.2M global multi-platform viewers across Comedy Central and Paramount+ in its first three days, Paramount Global said Wednesday. That\u2019s a slight uptick from the premiere episode, which reached nearly 6M viewers in the same time frame.\nParamount says that global streaming consumption of the long-running series from Trey Parker and Matt Stone has grown double digits in the first three days of Episode 2702\u2019s release, up 49% from the same period of streaming for the series post-premiere.\nOn cable, the second episode of this season is now the highest rated episode of South Park since 2018, outperforming the premiere episode by 54% in the 18-49 demo with a 1.53, per Nielsen data.\nWatch on Deadline\nIn terms of total viewers on cable, Episode 2702 brought in an audience of 1.56M in L3, indicating that the majority of the audience came from streaming.\nThe August 6 episode featured commentary on the ongoing masked ICE abductions of undocumented immigrants and U.S. citizens across the country with a parody of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem shooting puppies and raiding heaven, among other things. The episode follows laid off South Park teacher Mr. Mackey as he joins ICE once he loses his job at the school, conducting his first raid with little to no training save for a short video from Noem declaring that \u201ctogether we will make sure everyone is in this country legally.\u201d\nThere is also Cartman as right-wing provocateur Charlie Kirk doing his podcast on the toilet while getting busy \u2014 and a stylized version of JD Vance makes a first appearance as well. And, of course, there\u2019s more Trump and Satan canoodling to boot.\nTaking yet another shot at parent company Paramount, South Park also depicted ICE going after Dora the Explorer. Parker and Stone recently struck a new, five-year overall deal with Paramount Global as well as a five-year streaming license deal reportedly worth around $1.5B as streamers such as HBO Max clamored for the opportunity to stream the 300-plus episodes of the long-running animated show.\nSouth Park is taking another week off, so expect a new episode on August 20.\nMatt, Trey and anyone with a brain know that Trump is a moron and MAGA are a bunch of clowns and I love that they continue to go after the facist, racist, ignorant group that is making our country a laughing stock. At least through South Park the rest of the world can see that there are still intelligent, decent Americans here who see the horror that this regime is causing. Keep up the good work, Matt & Trey!\nI think this article is trying to imply that people watching south park is an indictment on trump, but I voted for trump and still enjoy south park. many such cases.\nM\u2019kay?"
