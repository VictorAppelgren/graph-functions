  "title": "Razer's Latest Mechanical Keyboards Are Ultra-Thin",
  "description": "Low-profile keyboards are quite the concept.",
  "content": "If you want a mechanical keyboard, you don't have to go for the ones with full-size switches and keycaps. There are tons of low-profile options that are just as clacky, even as they might have a tad less travel. Now, Razer's latest keyboards are here, and they're as thin as they get.\n\nRazer has announced the launch of two new low-profile gaming keyboards, the BlackWidow V4 Low-profile HyperSpeed and the BlackWidow V4 Low-profile Tenkeyless HyperSpeed. The big thing about them, as we hinted to before, is how thin they are. The company's green (clicky), yellow (linear), and orange (tactile) switches have been redesigned in a new low-profile flavor, with a reduced key height and a shorter travel distance, which Razer states promotes a more natural wrist alignment for users and potentially increases comfort during extended use without the need for a separate wrist rest. The keyboards feature a front height of 18.5mm and an angled chassis to further support a neutral wrist position.\n\nThe new switches have a circular stem wall intended to let Razer's Chroma RGB lighting shine through the translucent top housing of the switch. Each switch is factory-lubricated to ensure smooth key travel and is rated for up to 80 million keystrokes.\n\nAs far as the actual construction, both the full-size and tenkeyless models feature a 5052 aluminum alloy top case for durability. Internally, the keyboards are equipped with dual sound-dampening foam layers and a stainless steel plate, which, combined with pre-lubricated stabilizers, allow for a clean and satisfying typing sound despite what the low-profile switches would otherwise allow for. Yes, these are thin, but they are still mechanical, and Razer wants you to be very aware of that fact while you're using it.\n\nBoth keyboards support Razer's HyperSpeed Wireless technology, which is basically souped-up 2.4 GHz connectivity with a polling rate of up to 1000Hz for low-latency input. A single dongle can be used to connect both the keyboard and a compatible Razer gaming mouse. The keyboards also support Bluetooth connectivity, allowing you to pair them with up to three different devices for multitasking across various platforms.\n\nThese are also probably as feature-rich as a low-profile keyboard can get. The keyboards include a clickable multi-function roller and a set of dedicated macro buttons. These controls provide quick access to functions such as media playback, volume adjustment, and custom macros without interrupting gameplay. The keyboards also feature a Power Saving Mode, which can extend the battery life up to 980 hours on a single charge. We also have Razer Snap Tap, which allows for instant prioritization of the latest input between two keys without needing to release the first\u2014if used well, it could be a huge advantage in fast-paced games.\n\nBoth the regular model and the tenkeyless version are available for purchase on Razer's website.",

Razer Mechanical Switches are full-height in nature, offering up to 4.0 mm in total travel distance, whereas Razer Low-profile Mechanical Switches have a shorter total travel distance of up to 2.8 mm. This enables quicker keystrokes, while still delivering a satisfying typing experience. -\nIs the Razer BlackWidow V4 Low-profile HyperSpeed a hot-swappable keyboard? No, the keyboard does not feature hot-swap capabilities. However, it is available in 3 distinct low-profile switch options: Green Clicky, Orange Tactile and Yellow Linears. Availability and options will vary depending on layout types and regions. -\nHow do I check the battery life status on the Razer BlackWidow V4 Low-profile HyperSpeed? Using the dedicated battery life button, the number row will light up and show the estimated percentage accordingly. -\nCan I pair the Razer BlackWidow V4 Low-profile HyperSpeed with a compatible Razer wireless mouse to the same USB dongle? Yes, you can easily do this via Razer Synapse, and it is highly recommended to use the USB dongle that came with the keyboard as the main dongle. Please visit our support site for a step-by-step guide to multi-device pairing. -\nCan the Razer BlackWidow V4 Low-profile HyperSpeed be used both wired and wirelessly while charging? For wired mode, set the power switch to Wired and plug in the included USB Type A to Type C Cable. This will allow wired use while charging the keyboard. For wireless mode, set the power switch to Wireless and ensure that the HyperSpeed dongle is plugged into the main device. Plug in the included USB Type A to Type C Cable to continue charging the keyboard while using it wirelessly. -\nWhat material is the Razer BlackWidow V4 Low-profile HyperSpeed made of? The top case of this low-profile keyboard is made from durable 5052 aluminum alloy, while the bottom case is constructed using ABS plastic. -\nWhat is a top mount? A top mount is where the switch plate is secured to the top housing of the keyboard directly. This provides a typing experience that\u2019s consistent on any part of the keyboard while also eliminating resonance and ping that\u2019s commonly associated with integrated mounts. -\nIs this device compatible with Windows Dynamic Lighting? Please view our list of compatible devices to find out. If your device isn\u2019t listed, we highly recommend turning off Windows Dynamic Lighting to ensure the best Chroma RGB experience. -\nAre third-party cables supported with the Razer BlackWidow V4 Low-profile HyperSpeed? As this is a product that requires high-speed USB, it is highly recommended to use the included USB Type A to Type C cable as it is designed to handle high polling rates and high-speed connection. Using other cables that are not USB High-Speed compliant will cause performance issues on the device. -\nWhat is Razer\u2122 Snap Tap and does this keyboard have it? Prioritize the latest input between two selected keys without having to release the previous one. Enjoy more responsive inputs for near-instant directional changes. This keyboard supports Razer Snap Tap onboard and is off by default. -\nHow do I toggle Razer Snap Tap? Hit FN + Left Shift to immediately toggle Razer Snap Tap. The A and D keys are paired to this mode by default. Paired keys will light up white when Snap Tap is on and light up red when Snap Tap is off. Snap Tap can also be toggled via Razer Synapse, including customizing with your choice of assigned keys. -\nHow do I ensure I am getting the best experience out of my keyboard? To achieve the best experience with your keyboard, ensure both the firmware and Razer Synapse have been updated to the latest versions. -\nIs there a tenkeyless version of the Razer BlackWidow V4 Low-profile HyperSpeed?
