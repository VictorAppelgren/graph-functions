ANY AMOUNT PAID BY JACKPOCKET IN RELATION TO ANY SUCH WINNING TICKET SHALL NOT BE: (I) AN ADMISSION OF LIABILITY, (II) A REQUIREMENT TO MAKE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS, OR (III) CONSIDERED A WAIVER OF ANY OF JACKPOCKET'S RIGHTS IN THIS TERMS OF SERVICE.\nWinning Tickets greater than the In-Store Redemption Threshold are subject to approval by the Regulator and must be claimed directly from the Regulator either by mail or in person.

In the event you do pick up a Winning Ticket in person, you agree to take full possession and release Jackpocket from any responsibility for the Winning Ticket, and any associated prize claims, by signing a ticket release form.\nIn the event that Jackpocket mails you the Winning Ticket, Jackpocket will be responsible for paying for the shipping costs and Jackpocket is released from any liability and responsibility as soon as the packaged Winning Ticket is put into the possession of the mail courier. Prior to or upon shipping, Jackpocket will provide you with an email containing the tracking information for your Winning Ticket. In the event you do not receive your Winning Ticket, you must notify Jackpocket within fifteen (15) days following receipt of the email containing the tracking information so that Jackpocket may notify the courier or mail service. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of your mailing address.

You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Jackpocket for any claims, losses, expenses and all other liabilities Jackpocket incurs as a result of your failure to comply with these Terms of Service.\nd. Winning Ticket is a Bearer Instrument. Note that your ticket is held in trust by Jackpocket as the courier, and a Ticket is a bearer instrument within the meaning of all applicable law, such that the holder of the ticket is presumed to be the owner of the ticket with all applicable rights in the ticket and its proceeds. Therefore, if you obtain possession of your Winning Ticket, do not lose your Ticket or allow others to possess your Ticket. Jackpocket attempts to mitigate this risk by placing the winning customer's name on the back of the Ticket following the ticket being deemed a Winning Ticket, however Jackpocket cannot be held responsible for any lost or stolen tickets or other tickets that, for whatever reason, are not in the winning customer's possession.\n9.
