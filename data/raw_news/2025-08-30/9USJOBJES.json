  "content": "It was a rough afternoon for the American men at the U.S. Open.\n\nWith tears in his eyes, No. 6 Ben Shelton removed himself from Friday\u2019s third-round match against France\u2019s Adrian Mannarino with a shoulder injury, bringing a sudden end to the 22-year-old\u2019s run at Flushing Meadows.\n\nAbout an hour later, No. 17 Frances Tiafoe suffered an upset loss to Germany\u2019s Jan-Lennard Struff in straight sets.\n\nShelton retired from the action after dropping the fourth set against Mannarino at Louis Armstrong Stadium. The match would have gone to a decisive fifth set had Shelton been able to continue.\n\nInstead, Mannarino won, 3-6, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, ret., to advance to the fourth round.\n\n\u201cUsually I\u2019ll play through anything and just kind of find a way,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cAnd whether it\u2019s sickness or injury, like, if I can stay out there, I can stay out there. I never felt anything like this before.\u201d\n\nShelton said he \u201ccan\u2019t pinpoint\u201d when he got hurt but that he didn\u2019t have an injury going into the match.\n\nThe third set ended with Shelton delivering a diving shot from the corner and landing on his left arm. The left-handed Shelton was then heard in the fourth set telling the coach\u2019s box, \u201cI did something to my shoulder. I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d\n\nAfter that fourth set, a seated Shelton rubbed his eyes, then quickly embraced Mannarino before walking off of the court with a towel over his head.\n\nIt\u2019s the first time in 178 career matches that Shelton had to retire.\n\n\u201cI was just trying to adjust and figure out whatever I can to keep competing,\u201d Shelton said. \u201cEven though I was in pain, I was just kind of in that competitive mindset of trying to find a way and push through it.\u201d\n\nShelton is in the midst of the best season of his career, advancing to the semifinals at the Australian Open, the fourth round at the French Open and the quarterfinals at Wimbledon. He made it to the U.S. Open semifinal in 2023.\n\nTiafoe, meanwhile, lost 6-4, 6-3, 7-6 to Struff, the world\u2019s 144th-ranked men\u2019s player, on the Grandstand court. It was a disappointing finish for Tiafoe, who made it to the Open semifinal last year.\n\n\u201cI just thought Grandstand was super quick today, and having to have rallies was very, very tough. I was late on a lot of balls, just scrubbing them to be on offense, and he was dictating play most of the time,\u201d Tiafoe said.\n\n\u201cThe match was always kind of on his racquet. I had a little window there when he just gave me some gifts. I didn\u2019t take it. But I played extremely passive today. I didn\u2019t put any pressure on him at all.\u201d\n\nAn American man has not won the U.S. Open \u2014 or any Grand Slam, for that matter \u2014 since Andy Roddick claimed the crown at Flushing Meadows in 2003. Ending that drought becomes more difficult without Shelton and Tiafoe, who held two of the four highest seeds among U.S. men.\n\n\u201cThis is my favorite tournament,\u201d Shelton said last week. \u201cI think that we\u2019ve got a lot of guys \u2026 who can make deep runs here and play against the best players in the world. I think that it\u2019s a matter of time for us.\u201d",
