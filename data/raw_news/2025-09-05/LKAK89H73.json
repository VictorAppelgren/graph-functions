  "content": "Far from devaluing creativity, the AI boom is making it one of the most expensive skills in tech.A job listing for a content strategist at OpenAI, posted earlier this week, comes with a pay package that rivals senior engineering roles: $310,000 to $393,000 in base salary plus equity.Glassdoor data shows the average US content strategist earns about $92,000.OpenAI's posting says the person hired will \"define and execute the content strategy for ChatGPT.com.\"\"You'll shape how our brand sounds to the world, set the voice and tone guidelines, and roll up your sleeves to write, edit, and publish content that resonates with a global audience of both businesses and consumers,\" the company wrote.OpenAI is targeting candidates with 6 to 10 or more years of experience in content strategy, copywriting, or growth marketing at a \"high-growth company or prominent brand.\"OpenAI isn't alone in paying up for content talent. Meta posted a job last week for a content engineer role tied to generative AI with compensation of $159,000 to $223,000 in base salary plus bonus and equity.Meta says its GenAI content engineering team has backgrounds in  \"journalism, social media, creative storytelling, writing, editing, visual arts, film & TV production, and more.\"Applicants are expected to have extensive experience in digital content strategy, along with at least a year of hands-on work with GenAI products, prompt engineering, annotation, or content labeling and analysis, the posting said.OpenAI and Meta did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.High-paying content jobs are cropping up across the industry \u2014 especially in sectors being reshaped by AI.Last month, Duolingo advertised for a director of social media with a salary band topping out at $342,000. PayPal recently listed a head of CEO content role paying up to nearly $240,000.PwC's 2025 Global AI Jobs Barometer, published in June, found wages in AI-exposed industries are rising twice as fast as those in less exposed ones, and workers with AI skills command a 56% wage premium. PwC analyzed about 841 million job ads across 24 countries, including the US, UK, Hong Kong, and Australia.Fresh content job titles are also emerging. According to Autodesk's 2025 AI Jobs Report published in June, postings for an \"AI Content Creator\" surged 134.5% year over year, based on an analysis of nearly 3 million global job ads.Some startups are leaning hard on content, too.Viral AI \"cheating\" startup Cluely is betting on influencers to drive growth.Cluely needs to be \"the biggest thing\" on Instagram and TikTok, CEO and cofounder Chungin \"Roy\" Lee said on a podcast in June. \"Every single big company is known by regular people,\" he added.Lee previously told BI that his main goal for Cluely is to reach 1 billion views across all platforms.",
