  "description": "Closing out with Bon Jovi\u2019s \u201cLivin\u2019 on a Prayer\u201d was the ultimate ode to the emo hero\u2019s home state.",
  "content": "There was a palpable sense of excitement \u2014 the kind that moves you deep within \u2014 at New Jersey\u2019s MetLife Stadium on Saturday, Aug. 9.\n\nJust before My Chemical Romance took the stage for their \u2018Long Live The Black Parade North American Tour\u2019 headlining set, monitors throughout the stadium highlighted various rules audience members needed to follow in the fictional country of \u201cDraag,\u201d aka where the audience would be living for roughly the next 90 minutes.\n\nOne such rule was \u201cplease do not throw hair.\u201d Fair. Yeah, I think I can handle that one.\n\nOn the field, the Draag\u2019s dictator sat directly across from the stage and his menacing silhouette loomed large on the screens throughout the show. This was authoritarianism in full effect.\n\nThe opening \u201cNational Anthem\u201d led by the bandleader dressed in Nazi-like garb evoked an unsettling sense of patriotism for this fascist, fictional country, and, just like that, we were underway.\n\nAs predicted by fans, frontman Gerard Way\u2019s makeup showcases his ongoing decomposition he experiences each show. Amazingly, he stays in character the whole time. That includes when he shoved countless noodles into his mouth (a lunch break?) and when the mayor of his actual hometown \u2014 Belleville, NJ\u2019s Michael Melham \u2014 interrupted the vote for an execution* to hand over the key to the city.\n\nSorry, we forgot to mention the execution. Clearly, there was a lot going on in addition to, you know, the music.\n\nThis \u201cexecution\u201d was signaled by a shocking firework bomb that was followed by \u201cWelcome to the Black Parade,\u201d so any panic created was eased by the chills-inducing anthem. Shout out to Ray Toro on guitar who captivated all night long with his virtuoso axe skills.\n\n\n\nAs we neared the end of the first act, I felt the heat of the pyrotechnics. No lie, I started worrying about everyone on stage. That didn\u2019t last long though; my heat sympathies quickly dissipated when another firework bomb (!) went off not long after Gerard\u2019s character is (SPOILER ALERT) stabbed.\n\nCellist Clarice Jensen\u2019s hauntingly beautiful solo was a transformative interlude and necessary palate cleanser after the dramatics of the 2005 \u201cBlack Parade\u201d album in full. When the emo heroes returned to the B-stage to play cuts from other classic records of theirs, they came out as they are \u2013 a bunch of talented musicians from New Jersey.\n\nTruth be told, this was my favorite part of the show, hands down. For the next 11 songs, the sold-out crowd was treated to a stripped-down set that felt more like watching a band perform in their garage than headlining the gargantuan venue that\u2019s home to the New York Jets and Giants.\n\nAlong with an amazing view of the pale moon, the second-act setlist was definitely for the longtime fans. The \u201cKilljoys.\u201d The \u201cMCRmy,\u201d if you will. The real ones that have been there since the very beginning.\n\nI went absolutely nuts when they played the angsty as ever \u201cSkylines and Turnstiles\u201d (for the first time on the tour!) and fist-pumping singalong \u201cIt\u2019s Not a Fashion Statement, It\u2019s a F\u2014ing Deathwish.\u201d Closing out with Bon Jovi\u2019s all-timer classic \u201cLivin\u2019 on a Prayer\u201d was the ultimate ode to all those who rep the great state of New Jersey.\n\nFinal verdict: The theatrics of \u2018The Black Parade Tour\u2019s\u2019 heady, high-concept first half both left me in awe and overwhelmed as evidenced by the loud, scary firework bombs. As a result, the stripped-down second half was much more my speed. To each their own. either way, I am fully enlisted in the Black Parade.\n\nMy only complaint? The show almost felt too short because it was so engaging and enjoyable.\n\nMissed MCR at MetLife? The emo legends will be in Philadelphia (Aug. 15), Toronto (Aug. 22) and Boston (Sept. 7) these next few weeks. For more information, our team has everything you need to know and more about the tour below.\n\nPost-MetLife show, here\u2019s where My Chemical Romance will head next (along with their exquisitely curated special guests).\n\nA week after tour wraps, My Chemical Romance will close their 2025 run with a headlining spot at Atlanta\u2019s Shaky Knees Festival, which runs Sept. 19-21 at the city\u2019s Piedmont Park.\n\nIn addition to the big names mentioned above, Sublime, The Black Keys, Vampire Weekend, Lucy Dacus, 4 Non Blondes and many more exciting acts are also slated to appear at the three-day extravaganza.\n\nSound like the fest for you?\n\nIf so, you can grab single and multi-day Shaky Knees Festival passes here.\n\nFor a closer look, here\u2019s what MCR took to the stage at East Rutherford, NJ\u2019s MetLife Stadium on Saturday, Aug. 9 courtesy of Set List FM.\n\n01.) \u201cThe End.\u201d\n\n\n\n02.) \u201cDead!\u201d\n\n\n\n03.) \u201cThis Is How I Disappear\u201d\n\n\n\n04.) \u201cThe Sharpest Lives\u201d\n\n\n\n05.) \u201cWelcome to the Black Parade\u201d\n\n(interrupted at intro by the band being given the key to Belleville; followed by \u201cThe Election\u201d)\n\n06.) \u201cI Don\u2019t Love You\u201d\n\n(extended intro)\n\n\n\n07.) \u201cHouse of Wolves\u201d\n\n(with dog noises intro)\n\n\n\n08.) \u201cCancer\u201d\n\n\n\n09.) \u201cMama\u201d\n\n(with \u201cDagger\u201d outro; with guest opera singer)\n\n\n\n10.) \u201cSleep\u201d\n\n(with \u201cThe Big Sky\u201d intro)\n\n\n\n11.) \u201cTeenagers\u201d\n\n\n\n12.) \u201cDisenchanted\u201d\n\n(with \u201cThe Button Pressed\u201d intro)\n\n\n\n13.) \u201cFamous Last Words\u201d\n\n\n\n14.) \u201cThe End.\u201d\n\n(Reprise)\n\n\n\nB-Stage\n\n15.) \u201cFrom A to B\u201d\n\n(Clarice Jensen song) (performed by Clarice Jensen)\n\n\n\n16.) \u201cSkylines and Turnstiles\u201d (Tour debut)\n\n\n\n17.) \u201cOur Lady of Sorrows\u201d\n\n\n\n18.) \u201cI\u2019m Not Okay (I Promise)\u201d\n\n\n\n19.)

First was a handheld poster, that read \u201cYEA\u201d on one side and \u201cNAY\u201d on the other that were used for the aforementioned execution vote during the show. Second was a small piece of colored paper to put in front of your phone light. The payoff was that the entire stadium glowed red while we swayed during the slower songs. Super cool to see.\n\nGotta be honest here. Thursday did not get enough love from the crowd, which is shocking considering that they\u2019re they not only a huge inspiration to MCR but also helped produce their first album, 2002\u2019s \u201cI Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.\u201d Still, Geoff Rickly and his long-running outfit brought the goods.\n\n\n\nBen Gibbard and Death Cab For Cutie was a great chill interlude in between the much heavier, more dramatic acts. Standout tracks include \u201cI Will Possess Your Heart,\u201d \u201cYou Are a a Tourist\u201d and \u201cSoul Meets Body.\u201d They\u2019ll be at the Brooklyn Paramount on Tuesday, Aug. 12 performing a 20th anniversary concert celebrating the release of their 2005 album \u201cPlans.\u201d\n\nWhile they performed, fans traded bracelets, photos and keychains. Nice touch, MCRmy. This was a really sweet way for fans to interact and say hello, especially for those who may have gone to the concert on their own.\n\nIf you like your jeans skinny and still shop at Hot Topic, here are just five more acts you won\u2019t want to miss live these next few months.\n\nIn that case, make sure to check out next year\u2019s When We Were Young Festival (with Blink-182 and Panic! At The Disco) as well as the recently-revived Warped Tour.\n\nWhy you should trust \u2018Post Wanted\u2019 by the New York Post\n\nThis article was written by Matt Levy, New York Post live events reporter.

      "text": "Known for a unique blend of indie pop and hip-hop, Twenty One Pilots, made up of Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun, has exploded in popularity since the outfit dropped its self-released debut in 2009. From early songs like \u201cHolding on to You\u201d to later mainstream hits like \u201cStressed Out,\u201d Twenty One Pilots draws on all the biggest songs in its catalog to entertain fans in concert.

Melissas,\u201d Villase\u00f1or said over Zoom. \u201cI had a really good time the whole week we filmed.\u201d\nBut that\u2019s not all.\nVillase\u00f1or is also embarking on her nationwide \u2018New Things Tour\u2019 gearing herself up for her eventual special \u201cMore Melissa\u201d \u2014 named after what commenters would write online after watching \u2018SNL\u2019 \u2014 and a possible sitcom she\u2019s developing.\nWhat can fans expect if they see Villase\u00f1or live this year?\n\u201cMy stand up is about myself,\u201d she shared. \u201cThere\u2019s impressions, but it\u2019s not famous people. It\u2019s people around me, my family, so there\u2019s always a lot of voices.\u201d\nTo be fair, there are a few celebrities in the act.\n\u201cI\u2019m bringing back J-Lo. Ash Ketchum from Pok\u00e9mon and Pikachu and Schwarzenegger. They\u2019re all very silly, but tied of my life in some way,\u201d she said.\nMore than anything, the material really is more Melissa \u2014 more personal, more honest, more of a showcase of her skills set.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more my story, more my point of view, more voices, more singing. It\u2019s everything. There are no rules.\u201d\nPlus, she may even surprise you at a show.\n\u201cMy journey has been positive but I have a lot of new bits that are on the darker, meaner side that I don\u2019t usually get to reveal.\u201d\nShe won\u2019t get too crazy though.\n\u201c(The jokes) aren\u2019t even that mean but I think the crowd really loves it because they\u2019re like, \u2018Whoa, we didn\u2019t expect that.'\u201d\nWant to see more Melissa than ever before?\nKeep reading.\nWe\u2019ve got everything you need to know and more below.\nMelissa Villase\u00f1or 2023 tour schedule\nA complete calendar including all of Villase\u00f1or\u2019s tour dates, venues and links to buy tickets can be found below.\nMelissa\u2019s time at \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019\nAs major SNL nerds, we couldn\u2019t help but ask Melissa a few questions about her six seasons on the show.\nHere\u2019s what she had to say.\nNew York Post: Are there any sketches that got cut at dress you\u2019re especially bummed the world never got to see?\nMelissa: My impression of Sebastian Maniscalco. I did him twice at dress rehearsal. There was one where I was him on a \u2018Family Feud,\u2019 and it did really well but sometimes it doesn\u2019t work out. Maybe the host doesn\u2019t like their piece or you don\u2019t know the reason.\nThere are also a few comedy songs I wrote for SNL that didn\u2019t get picked for music videos so I\u2019m trying to figure out a way to make those happen for the live show because they\u2019re so fun.\nNYP: Did you ever do another installment of your dirty talk character you did with Aziz Ansari and Donald Glover?\nMelissa: Sort of. There was a table read with Oscar Isaac because he really liked that one but it didn\u2019t pan out.\nThose sketches were written by Mikey Day and Streeter Seidell. They always joked \u201cMelissa can\u2019t talk dirty.\u201d\nNYP: What do you think of this season thus far?\nMelissa: I think it\u2019s great. It makes me happy to see everyone get more screen time too. They\u2019re really spreading their wings with their ideas now.\nNYP: Which writers did you appreciate most in your time there?\nMelissa: I really enjoyed working with my friend Steven Castillo. We wrote for a few years together on things like the Nickelback sketch from a few years back. I liked working with Andrew Dismukes and Ben Silva the last season too.\nSilva helped me write my Cesar character and the Peek at Pico \u201cthat\u2019s so sad\u201d sketch.\nNYP: What do you see after the 50th season happening now?\nI have no clue. It\u2019s a mystery. It\u2019s a mystery, yeah.\nEven if I was there, it\u2019d be a mystery. No one knows anything, really.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nSNL stars on tour in 2023\nMelissa isn\u2019t the only cast member out and about this year.\nHere are just five fellow Not Ready For Primetime Players that you can catch at a venue near you these next few months.\nWho else is on the road from \u201cSNL?\u201d Check out our list of all 31 \u201cSNL\u201d alumni on tour in 2023 here."

      "text": "Midway through his Friday, Sept. 1 concert at East Rutherford, NJ\u2019s MetLife Stadium, Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Bruce Springsteen took a minute to allude to one of the few unfortunate breaks in his illustrious career.\nThe music quieted and The Boss told a humorous story of how he was kicked out of his first band, The Rogues, way back in 1965.\nHe laughed it off with \u201cSopranos\u201d cast member and longtime E Street Band guitarist Steven Van Zandt but clearly this chip on his shoulder had a lasting impact.\n58 years later, no one in music continually works harder to prove their worth. Rather than phone it in, Springsteen gives it his all to show his loyal fanbase \u2014 and maybe The Rogues \u2014 that he belongs every single time he takes the stage.\nLet\u2019s go back to the beginning though.\nStarting promptly at 7:55 p.m. as New Jerseyans straggled into the massive Jets and Giants stadium with their $50 \u201cBorn In The U.S.A.\u201d souvenir t-shirts, Springsteen and the E Street Band kicked the evening off with the rockin\u2019, larger-than-life \u201cLonesome Day.\u201d\nThen, for nearly 2.5 hours, the long-running ensemble took nary a break. No banter, all bangers. Each song bled into the next with Bruce\u2019s signature \u201c1, 2, 3, 4!\u201d cry giving the crowd a full-on musical thrill ride that never ran out of gas and was simultaneously heavy, silly and soaring sometimes all within the span of one song.\nOf course, the singalong hits were just as impassioned, fresh and joyously infectious as when they debuted nearly a half century ago \u2014 \u201cBorn To Run,\u201d \u201cThunder Road\u201d and \u201cDancing In The Dark\u201d all made this reviewer\u2019s hair stand on end \u2014 but they weren\u2019t even close to the chill-inducing pair of highlights from the jam-packed evening.\nEarly in the night, the band surprised super fans with the inclusion of their bluesy 1973 classic \u201cSpirit In The Night\u201d which The Boss hasn\u2019t busted out since 2017 according to Set List FM. While the song didn\u2019t have the seamless flow it does on the record, hearing the slowed-down, twinkling piano section live under Bruce\u2019s powerful, gruff vocals was truly a great gift.\nYet, that wasn\u2019t the peak.\nFor this reviewer, it was the rousing cover of The Commodores\u2019 hit \u201cNight Shift\u201d where Springsteen stepped aside and showcased the horn section, drummer Max Weinberg (who you may remember from \u201cLate Night with Conan O\u2019Brien\u201d) and most importantly, backup singer Curtis King Jr.\u2019s striking falsetto that left the night\u2019s most lasting impression.\nThat\u2019s not to mention Bruce\u2019s true co-MVP, saxophonist Jake Clemons (the nephew of the late Clarence Clemons), who blew his heart out all night breathing shockingly urgent life into the music that the band has been playing live for six (!) decades now.\nSimply put, you have to see The Boss and his talented band live to truly appreciate their craft.\nAt the center of it all, the 74-year-old Springsteen is a pure showman full of gusto and bravado incorporating every tool at his disposal. Whispers, echoes, street preacher sermons, false starts and stops, ripping his shirt open, sharing a mic dangerously close to Van Zandt, spoken word sections, yelps and heart. Lots and lots and lots of heart.\nThe man still really cares about the music.\nBased on what we saw, no one\u2019s kicking him out of The E Street Band anytime soon.\nFinal verdict: Although Bruce didn\u2019t play \u201cJungleland,\u201d \u201cBorn In The U.S.A.,\u201d \u201cHungry Heart\u201d and countless other favorites at the gig this reviewer attended, we\u2019ll give him a pass \u2014 the Sept. 1 concert was a complete, satisfying experience that encapsulated Springsteen\u2019s historic career beautifully.\nIf you haven\u2019t caught The Boss live, make it a priority.\nNew Yorkers, he\u2019s in Syracuse next at the JMA Wireless Dome on Thursday, Sept. 7.\nAfter that, The Boss will drop into Albany\u2019s MVP Arena on Tuesday, Sept. 19.\nBruce Springsteen 2023-24 tour schedule\nA complete calendar of all 24 remaining summer, fall and winter concert dates, venues and links to buy tickets can be found below.\nBruce Springsteen set list\nHere\u2019s what we heard Asbury Park\u2019s most famous band play at the Sept. 1 MetLife Stadium show courtesy of Set List FM.\n01.) \u201cLonesome Day\u201d\n02.) \u201cNight\u201d\n03.) \u201cNo Surrender\u201d\n04.) \u201cGhosts\u201d\n05.) \u201cProve It All Night\u201d\n06.) \u201cDarkness On The Edge Of Town\u201d\n07.) \u201cLetter To You\u201d\n08.) \u201cThe Promised Land\u201d\n09.) \u201cSpirit In The Night\u201d\n10.) \u201cKitty\u2019s Back\u201d\n11.) \u201cNightshift\u201d (Commodores cover)\n12.) \u201cThe E Street Shuffle\u201d\n13.) \u201cMary\u2019s Place\u201d\n14.) \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d\n15.) \u201cBackstreets\u201d\n16.) \u201cBecause The Night\u201d (Patti Smith cover)\n17.) \u201cShe\u2019s The One\u201d\n18.) \u201cWrecking Ball\u201d\n19.) \u201cThe Rising\u201d\n20.) \u201cBadlands\u201d\n21.) \u201cThunder Road\u201d\nEncore\n22.) \u201cBorn To Run\u201d\n23.) \u201cRosalita (Come Out Tonight)\u201d\n24.) \u201cSeven Nights To Rock\u201d (Moon Mullican cover)\n24.) \u201cGlory Days\u201d\n25.) \u201cDancing In The Dark\u201d\n26.) \u201cTenth Avenue Freeze Out\u201d\nEncore Two\n27.) \u201cI\u2019ll See You In My Dreams\u201d\nClassic rockers on tour in 2023\nA surprising number of stars that dominated the charts in the \u201970s and \u201980s are back on the road this year.\nHere are our five favorite acts you won\u2019t want to miss these next few months.\n\u2022 Billy Joel with Stevie Nicks\n\u2022 Ringo Starr and his All Starr Band\nWant to see who else is out and about?

      "text": "A couple years ago, Beth Stelling got off on the wrong foot with her landlady.\nAlmost immediately after moving into her new apartment building, the celebrated Los Angeles-based stand-up \u2014 who has also written for \u201cCrashing,\u201d \u201cThe Last O.G\u201d and \u201cRick and Morty\u201d and a number of other series \u2014 began clashing with the woman in charge of her rent.\nYet, rather than just let their contentious interactions bother her, she opted to turn her grievances into comedy and ended up developing her airtight, whip-smart special \u201cThe Landlord\u201d all about this fraught relationship [Editor\u2019s Note: Stelling has since moved out of her place].\n\u201cI spent a lot of time wondering if she was messing with me so I would write something about her,\u201d Stelling told The Post in an exclusive interview. \u201cBut no. She messed with so many people. One guy told me his wife avoids the landlady because she made her cry.\u201d\nWhile stories like this may not sound like subject matter ripe for comedy, Stelling\u2019s laugh-out-loud 30-minute special defies all expectations, surprising at every turn. Her razor-sharp observations, trademark exasperated deadpan and exaggerated nose-rumpling impressions make for one of the year\u2019s most inspired, under-the-radar half hours all about a thorny yet ever-prescient subject for renters.\n\u201cEvery conversation is like falling in a prickle bush\u201d she jokes about her landlady a few minutes into \u201cThe Landlord,\u201d before effortlessly rattling off hundreds more precise punchlines about disparate yet similar topics. Some choice favorites include \u201cI have a ton of money in my checking account because I feel safer looking at a lump sum watching it depreciate\u201d and \u201cwhen I write for a show I\u2019m, going to appear on, I have makeup put on so I didn\u2019t have to field questions about my mental health.\u201d\nNow, one month removed from the release of the spectacularly dense yet willfully carefree \u201cThe Landlord,\u201d the special is now streaming on YouTube and Stelling is back on the road with a fresh hour of material. That includes two nights of gigs at Brooklyn\u2019s Bell House on Friday, Nov. 21 and Saturday, Nov. 22.\nAhead of those headlining spots, we chatted with the sly comic about her hilarious \u201cLandlady\u201d-centric half hour, favorite lines she\u2019s written for sitcoms/movies she\u2019s worked on and the upcoming tour.\nAll that and more can be found below. Just make sure you don\u2019t read this story with your landlord peeking over your shoulder.\nBeth Stelling tour schedule 2025\nA complete calendar including all tour dates, venues and links to buy tickets for all upcoming Beth Stelling stand-up shows can be found below.\nBeth Stelling stand-up specials\nWant to dig into the archives and catch all of Beth\u2019s primo past material ASAP? Below, you\u2019ll find where you can stream all four of her excellent specials.\n\u201cSimply The Beth\u201d (2015) is streaming on Spotify\n\u201cGirl Daddy\u201d (2020) is streaming on HBO Max\n\u201cIf You Didn\u2019t Want Me Then\u201d (2023) is streaming on Netflix\n\u201cThe Landlord\u201d (2025) is streaming on YouTube\nBeth Stelling interview\nHow did \u201cThe Landlord\u201d special come to be?\nThe story came to fruition after so many years of frustration with my landlady. It\u2019s based in deep feelings of anger, helplessness and shock. In some cases, I\u2019d go \u201cit\u2019s not that bad\u201d because the truth is I wasn\u2019t living with drips in the roof and a lot of my basic needs were met but it was an insane experience every time I came across that woman. In fact, it got to the point where sometimes it would take me hours to come down from our interaction because it was so charged.\nShe screamed in my face and I would hear every argument she\u2019d have with her daughter. There really were so many stories that I had to pick and choose which ones I\u2019d tell onstage.\nAt the beginning of the special you tease the audience with material about skydiving at the mall instead of jumping into the landlady story. Was that intentional from the outset of your writing process?\nYes. Plenty of people asked \u201cwhy did you start with that?\u201d but I lived differently when I was renting.\nBack then, I would spend $180 on an \u201cI Fly\u201d because rent was so much cheaper. It was a different mindset. So, the first few minutes of the special are a commentary on how you can spend all your money doing ridiculous things when you don\u2019t own property.\nI finally saved up and bought a house before I finished this special and realized \u201cthose were my renting days when I would spend $180 to get shot into a tube with a friend.\u201d Now, I\u2019m frugal. I get when people say you\u2019re \u201chouse poor.\u201d These days, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s better.\nI never thought when I moved to Los Angeles 14 years ago in my mom\u2019s \u201902 Mercury Sable with $1,200, which was every ounce of money I\u2019d saved from babysitting and waitressing at cafes, that I\u2019d own a home.\nDid the landlord material start out as a bit or a chunk and develop into a full special?\nI was at Sarah Silverman\u2019s house and we were swimming and I told her a joke about my landlady that made her laugh. Then, when I was on vacation with my mom and sister, I was venting about the situation and they were cracking up. So, I built the story up over a long period of time onstage, which was tough because if audiences aren\u2019t on board, it can be a slog. It takes a long time to hone a story to get people with you the whole time.\nI funded the special myself. My boyfriend, Adam Newacheck, was the director and we only had two other crew members (Lincoln Rzonca and Maya Ortega) manning the cameras. We shot it at Denver\u2019s Comedy Works and had one of the best colorists in town, Jay Cody Baker, work on the special, as well as Joanna Katcher who did the sound mixing.\nYou have 25 shows over these next few months. Will the landlady story be built into your upcoming tour? Will you be revisiting material from past specials or are you going to be doing all new stuff on the road?\nLast May, I\u2019d amassed an hour that was made up of my landlady material, another chunk that ended up on Don\u2019t Tell Comedy\u2019s YouTube and some other stuff. I tried to shop all that as a special but everybody said it was too soon since I\u2019d just put out \u201cIf You Didn\u2019t Want Me Then\u201d on HBO in 2023. Hulu told me \u201cwe already have our slot for this year\u2026maybe in 2026?\u201d which left me sitting on all this material.\nSo, I put \u201cThe Landlord\u201d online, my \u201cstarting my own religion\u201d story on \u201cDon\u2019t Tell\u201d and still have 55 minutes of material left. I\u2019ve been honing and touring that since last May. None of those jokes are available unless you\u2019ve seen me on the road recently.\nIs there any particular subject matter you\u2019re covering onstage these days?\nThe theme to my current show is aging. I turned 40 this year and I\u2019m aging naturally, which I proclaimed in my 2023 special. So I\u2019m expanding on that concept with material that wasn\u2019t ready for that special. There\u2019s stuff about having my eggs frozen and meeting a guy that has kids and stepping into the step-parent role. I come from a divorced family and had step-parents that were pretty bad blueprints, so it\u2019s tapping back into what I had as a stepdaughter. That\u2019s in development. I recorded a version of that material in June as a proof of concept.\nI would love to have someone produce my special when I\u2019m at the Wilbur in Boston this October.\nHow has your stand up evolved over the past few years?\nI have become a little sillier and started deploying more voices and facial movements. Mo Welch is one of my best friends (as well as Stelling\u2019s Sweethearts Podcast co-host), and she told me she loved my act-outs. So I\u2019ve listened to her and am now more physical than I have been in the past because my default is a very calm deadpan.\nWhat would you say to someone that\u2019s never seen you live to get them to come to your shows?\nPlease!\nPlease come. I have to pay my mortgage. The feedback I\u2019ve liked lately is when dudes come up to me after a show and tell me how much they loved my set and wish they had brought a woman in their lives that could relate. A lot of women in their early forties say similar things. A few have told me they feel seen.\nIt\u2019s going to be a fun night, I promise. I won\u2019t bother you either. I won\u2019t ask you what you do for a living. I would never make fun of you or how you look. I\u2019m there to entertain and make you feel less alone.\nWhat line are you most proud of to have gotten on the air from all the shows you\u2019ve worked on over the years?\nThere are two.\nIn an episode of \u201cCrashing,\u201d there\u2019s a scene where Pete\u2019s getting a massage and when he moves his face, the masseuse goes \u201cthere you are Peter.\u201d I like that because I loved \u201cHook\u201d growing up.\nThen, there was a line I wrote for the movie \u201cGood Boys,\u201d where the boys are talking about girls at the pool and one of them says \u201cshe\u2019s a total nympho\u201d and one of the others says \u201cwhat does that mean?\u201d and he says \u201cshe has sex on land and sea.\u201d\nYou are at the Bell House in November for two nights.\nThat\u2019s true.\nWhat do you love about that space?\nIt\u2019s a great New York venue, and I am always glad people come out and see me. I normally do one night, so hopefully it creates opportunities for more people to come.\nWho are your favorite working comics right now?\nMaria Bamford always makes me laugh.\nSarah Silverman. I liked doing road dates with her while she was working on \u201cPostpartum.\u201d She\u2019s one of the greats.\nZainab Johnson. We did a fun festival together in Seattle. She\u2019s just so smooth, funny and smart.\nMarc Maron. I like watching him. Although sometimes when I\u2019m on a show with him, he\u2019ll blow the light.\nMo Welch. Of course.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity.\nNeed even more comedy in your life? Check out our list of all the biggest comedians on tour in 2025 to find the show for you.\nWhy you should trust \u2018Post Wanted\u2019 by the New York Post\nThis article was written by Matt Levy, New York Post live events reporter.

      "text": "The Black Keys' rise to fame was slow but steady, eventually coming to fruition thanks to 2010's Brothers, which was the sixth studio album from Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney. The record spawned hit singles like \"Tighten Up\" and \"Howlin' for You\", and ultimately earned the group its first of several much-deserved GRAMMYs. Even though The Black Keys is only made up of a drummer and a guitarist, the Ohio-based duo has been known to deliver some of the most compelling live performances in modern rock music. The band has been touring the world since 2003, when the first Black Keys tour took the group around its native U.S., as well as to cities in Europe, the U.K., and Australia. Since then, the duo has continued its reputation for live excellence with performances at standalone concerts and festivals around the globe. The Black Keys tours plotted in support of albums like El Camino and Brothers have taken the group to festivals like Bonnaroo, Outside Lands, Lollapalooza, Coachella, and many more. Equipped with an innate ability to produce tracks that are as catchy as they are well-written, don't miss the chance to experience the talents of Auerbach and Carney in person during an upcoming show or tour date.

Over its 53-minute runtime, Gaga goes hard providing her signature powerful vocals over shimmery synths, thumping percussion and the occasional epic guitar riff. And, yes, it\u2019s an absolute blast that we went gaga over.\nStandouts here include the anthemic, electro \u201cDisease,\u201d disco jam \u201cAbracadabra,\u201d creepy, hypnotic bop \u201cKillah,\u201d glittery foot-stomper \u201cZombieboy\u201d and retro, New Wave-esque \u201cDon\u2019t Call Tonight.\u201d\nStill, our top track has to be the lead single, Gaga\u2019s throwback \u201cDie With A Smile\u201d duet with Bruno Mars. Sweeping yet intimate and thrillingly romantic, the heartfelt tune pairs perfectly as an upbeat counterpart to her similarlly swooning \u201cShallow.\u201d It\u2019s essential and we\u2019d bet will likely become a staple at Gaga tours for the next few decades.\nIf you\u2019d like to fire up the glossy record right now and find your own favorite tune or two, \u201cMayhem\u201d can be found here.\nHuge stars on tour in 2025\nGaga isn\u2019t the only household name icon swooping into arenas this year.\nIf you don\u2019t believe us, here are just five of our favorite powerhouse superstars that might be coming to an arena or stadium near you these next few months.\n\u2022 Dua Lipa\nPlus, don\u2019t forget Dolly Parton is putting on a six-show Las Vegas residency this December. Trust us- you won\u2019t want to miss her brief run while you have the chance.\nWhy you should trust \u2018Post Wanted\u2019 by the New York Post\nThis article was written by Matt Levy, New York Post live events reporter.

  "argos_summary": "My Chemical Romance's concert at MetLife Stadium on August 9, 2025, was a theatrical spectacle, blending music with a narrative set in a fictional authoritarian regime. The show featured dramatic performances, including a mock execution and pyrotechnics, alongside fan-favorite songs from their albums, particularly 'The Black Parade.' The second half of the concert shifted to a more intimate vibe, showcasing deeper cuts and allowing the band to connect with longtime fans. The tour continues with upcoming shows in Philadelphia, Toronto, and Boston.",
