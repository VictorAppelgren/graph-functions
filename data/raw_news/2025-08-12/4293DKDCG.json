  "description": "Key PointsPalantir\u2019s AIP is experiencing rapid enterprise adoption.",
  "content": "Key Points\n\u2022 10 stocks we like better than Palantir Technologies \u203a\n\nSmart investing is much more about picking high-quality growth stocks and holding them patiently rather than chasing speculative investments and focusing on market timing. The investment journey also doesn't require thousands of dollars or a finance degree. With just $200 (which you don't need to pay bills or for contingencies), you can start building a portfolio of stocks backed by fundamentally strong companies with robust long-term growth prospects.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Learn More \u00bb\n\nPalantir Technologies (NASDAQ: PLTR) and Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG) are two such companies that fit the bill. Here's why you can consider picking stakes in either of these stocks in 2025.\n\nData analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) player Palantir is at the forefront of helping government agencies and large corporations derive insights and meaning from vast amounts of data. While the company initially focused on national security, it also expanded into commercial markets.\n\nPalantir's Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is proving to be a significant growth catalyst. AIP integrates large language models with real-world workflows and data systems through Palantir's proprietary ontology (mapping of real-world assets of the clients to digital counterparts). By understanding the data and its relationships in the context of the organization, AIP is better positioned to resolve real-world problems rapidly. Additionally, clients are leveraging AIP not only as another AI-powered software tool but also as foundational infrastructure to build their custom software.\n\nAIP's success has been at the heart of Palantir's financial growth. The company's revenues soared 48% year over year to over $1 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending June 30). U.S. commercial revenues surged 93% year over year to $306 million, while government revenues climbed 53% year over year to $426 million. The company is experiencing a rapid rise in new high-value deals, while existing customers are also increasing their usage once they experience the platform's capabilities. Palantir achieved this success with a relatively small direct sales force, relying instead on satisfied customers to spread the word.\n\nWhile the commercial business is growing at a quicker pace, government contracts are still a crucial part of Palantir's business. The U.S. Army recently awarded Palantir a 10-year agreement worth up to $10 billion, consolidating 75 separate contracts.\n\nPalantir is also profitable and reported its sixth consecutive quarter of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) profitability. But despite the robust growth potential, Palantir's sky-high valuation is making investors concerned. The stock trades at 132 times sales and 277 times forward earnings -- numbers that would make even the most optimistic investor pause.\n\nYet it may not be wise to dismiss the company based on valuation. Amazon also faced significant criticism as it traded at sky-high valuations. Eventually, though, Amazon's growth potential helped readjust the valuation, and the company proved to be a brilliant pick for long-term investors who purchased in those early \"expensive\" periods.\n\nPalantir appears positioned for a similar exceptional growth story, with analysts expecting revenues to rise 45.6% in fiscal 2025 and 33% in fiscal 2026. While those growth rates are lower than current levels, they're still impressive for a company with an annual run rate of around $3.4 billion. For investors willing to bet on Palantir's strong tailwinds, the current valuation might prove justified over time.\n\nDatadog's cloud monitoring and observability platform is increasingly becoming mission-critical for enterprises tracking their digital infrastructure and applications. As more companies shift to the cloud and adopt advanced AI technologies, it becomes imperative for them to track performance, cost efficiency, and errors in their digital infrastructure.\n\nDatadog is positioned to capitalize on this growing opportunity. This is evident considering the company's solid revenue and earnings performance in the second quarter. Revenues grew 28% year over year to $827 million, primarily driven by increased service usage by existing customers, which included both AI-focused (AI-native) users and the rest of the customers. AI-native users accounted for 11% of Datadog's revenue in the second quarter, up from 8% last quarter.\n\nDatadog's platform strategy has also played a pivotal role in the success of its cross-selling and upselling efforts. At the end of the second quarter, 83% of customers used two or more products, while 52% used four or more. The company's net revenue retention rate was also around 120%. A sticky customer base ensures high revenue visibility.\n\nDatadog is also leveraging AI to strengthen its observability and monitoring platform. The company has launched autonomous AI agents to focus on three areas: investigating and remediating alerts, fixing coding issues, and analyzing security signals without human intervention.\n\nDatadog faces the risk of revenue volatility if its AI-native customers optimize their spending as they mature. Despite the risk, the company appears positioned for continued growth. For investors comfortable with some volatility, Datadog could be a worthwhile pick now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Palantir Technologies wasn\u2019t one of them.

      "text": "Forward P/E is a valuation metric that uses earnings forecasts to calculate the ratio of the share price to projected earnings per share. The \"P\" in forward P/E stands for price, or share price. The \"E\" stands for future earnings per share.\nWhat is it?\nWhat is forward P/E?\nForward P/E is a variation of the price-to-earnings ratio that uses an estimate of earnings over the next 12 months to calculate the metric. Unlike the trailing P/E, which uses actual earnings results from the previous 12 months, the forward P/E is based on estimates, and is therefore subject to errors in forecasting.\nTo combat the potential to get the estimated earnings wrong, the forward P/E is typically calculated using a consensus estimate from all analysts who have published their expectations. This wisdom of the crowd approach typically leads to more accurate estimates.\nHow to calculate it\nHow to calculate forward P/E\nThe formula for calculating a forward P/E ratio is very straightforward.\nForward P/E = Current share price / Estimated future earnings per share\nThe hard part is determining the estimated earnings per share. Several resources provide consensus estimates from Wall Street analysts for big companies. Some companies, however, only have a few analysts (and sometimes none) publishing estimates. In those cases it may be worthwhile to dig into the company financials, management\u2019s commentary, and build your own estimate to aggregate with the professionals.\nAs an example, let\u2019s say a stock currently trades for around $150 per share. Analysts expect it\u2019ll produce earnings per share of $6 over the next year. That stock has a forward P/E ratio of 25.\nHow to use it\nHow to use forward P/E\nCalculating the forward P/E of a stock isn\u2019t very useful in and of itself. To get something out of it, you need to calculate the forward P/E of other comparable stocks.\nComparing the forward P/E of two or more companies within the same industry can give you an idea of whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued. If one stock has a P/E far greater than its peers, the stock might not be a very good deal.\nBut there are good reasons why a stock may have a high forward P/E. If analysts expect that company\u2019s earnings per share to grow significantly faster than its peers, it\u2019ll value the next 12 months of earnings far higher than a slow-growing company. That\u2019s because a stock price reflects all the future cash flows of a business, not just the next 12 months.\nIt\u2019s important to consider that a forward P/E uses earnings per share, or EPS, in the denominator. EPS is itself a ratio, which is affected by the number of shares outstanding. So, if a company has plans to buy back a large percentage of its shares outstanding through a share repurchase program, investors may be willing to pay more for its earnings today.\nRelated investing topics\nLimitations\nLimitations of forward P/E\nTo calculate a price-to-earnings ratio, a company needs to have earnings. But not every company produces positive earnings for its shareholders.\nEarly-stage growth companies often produce losses, but their operations show strong potential for earnings at some point in the future. While they invest to grow the business, leverage their fixed operating expenses, and move toward profitability, their stocks technically trade for a negative P/E ratio.\nProfit\nEven when those companies start to make a profit, their relatively minuscule profits relative to the number of shares outstanding can lead to P/E ratios with triple or even quadruple digits. Those valuations aren\u2019t useful for an investing thesis, and forward P/E falls flat in those cases.\nInvestors will be better off finding a different valuation metric to compare growth stocks that are still generating losses for investors. Just because they have extremely high or non-existent forward P/E ratios doesn\u2019t make them bad investments."

      "text": "Ever since the launch of ChatGPT, the business world has been captivated by artificial intelligence (AI), so it shouldn't be a surprise that investors are looking for new ways to use AI in investing.\nThe applications for generative AI and other forms of the emerging technology are opening up new ways for its use in investing. Now, investors are not only looking for companies that could make a fortune from AI but also for ways to use AI to become better investors and improve their returns.\nIn this look at AI and investing, we'll review the definition of artificial intelligence, discuss several ways that AI is being applied in investing, and explore how artificial intelligence could affect the future of investing.\nWhat is AI?\nWhat is AI?\nArtificial Intelligence\nIn the real world, artificial intelligence takes shape in a number of different ways. The most common application of AI is machine learning, which describes the way in which computers can be trained with data to make inferences that would typically require human thinking. This is the kind of AI that allows computers to recognize images like faces or identify a specific species of plant.\nOther commonly used forms of AI include computer vision, which is critical for applications like autonomous vehicles, and natural language processing, which underpins technology like ChatGPT and other generative AI tools.\nThere's also robotics, which has a wide range of applications, including industrial robots that can be used for painting or welding, and domestic robots like robot vacuum cleaners that are used for cleaning or home security functions.\nFinally, neural networks are another example of AI that mimics the connectivity of the human brain and underpins technologies like speech recognition and natural language processing.\nKeep reading to see five ways that AI is used in investing.\nFive applications of AI in investing\nFive applications of AI in investing\n1. Algorithmic trading\nAlgorithmic trading might be the most direct way in which AI is used in investing.\nTraders use AI algorithms to analyze large datasets and trade at high speeds, making trades based on market trends and patterns.\nComputers have the ability to analyze data much faster than humans can, giving them an advantage in high-frequency trading. Algorithms also aren't subject to human biases, which range from loss aversion to anchoring to framing, none of which affect AI algorithms.\nAlgorithmic trading often focuses on taking advantage of price discrepancies such as the bid-ask spread, and the gains are often small enough that it only works in high volume.\nAlgorithmic trading does work, but no trading strategy works 100% of the time since market conditions and traders adjust to new information quickly.\nBid and Ask\n2. Sentiment analysis\nAnother way AI is used in investing is for sentiment analysis. Markets move according to a variety of factors, such as macroeconomic data, earnings reports, geopolitical issues, interest rates, and market sentiment.\nSentiment is difficult to quantify, but investor feelings often dictate the direction of the stock market more than any other data point.\nArtificial intelligence programs can help traders assess market sentiment by collecting news articles, social media posts, and other online activity to measure market sentiment and predict movements.\nSentiment can also have a significant impact at the sector level, driving booms in industries like electric vehicles, cannabis, cryptocurrency -- and now, artificial intelligence stocks.\n3. Portfolio optimization\nPortfolio management is another bedrock concept in investing. Money managers try to maintain a balance around diversification, risk, and factors like income and growth. AI can help fund managers optimize their portfolios to balance between these goals and prioritize any one of them.\nThere could also be a future where generative AI technologies like ChatGPT are used in portfolio management; one research team found that ChatGPT can be effective as a co-pilot when putting together a portfolio. Such a tool can be especially useful for retail investors who may not be as experienced at managing their own investments.\nAI investing bots can also advise money managers on what's missing in their portfolios, informing them on how to better balance them.\n4. Risk management\nAI can also play a role in risk management, helping money managers and companies by analyzing historical market data, volatility, and any correlations that could affect returns.\nMachine learning techniques are also used in risk management to help improve efficiency and reduce costs.\nIn some ways, the technology can replace human labor since it's able to analyze large datasets at fast speeds with relatively little need for human intervention.\nThese models have demonstrated better forecasting accuracy than traditional regression models and are able to capture nonlinear relationships between risk factors and other variables.\n5. Personalized investment advice\nThanks to the innovation behind ChatGPT and generative AI, AI programs are starting to be able to offer personalized investment advice.\nOne such app is called Magnifi, which uses ChatGPT and other AI tools to provide real-time investment advice.\nMagnifi acts like something of an AI-powered Robinhood (HOOD -0.88%), functioning as a trading platform that can answer questions with a chatbot interface like ChatGPT.\nAlthough Magnifi only recently launched, we'll likely see more such AI investing platforms as investors are eager to take advantage of the new technology.\nMainstream trading platforms like Robinhood and others could also start to incorporate some of these AI trading tools soon.\nRelated investing topics\nIs AI the future of investing?\nIs artificial intelligence the future of investing?\nThere's no single way to invest, and investing can't be neatly categorized like other industries.\nHowever, investors are likely to embrace any new technology that can improve performance and alleviate some of the labor of investing, and artificial intelligence fits both criteria.\nAlthough there will always be a human component in investing, picking stocks, and managing a portfolio, artificial intelligence is likely to play a greater role in investing as the technology develops.\nIf you're interested in getting exposure to artificial intelligence in your own portfolio, consider looking at AI stocks or an AI ETF to gain broad exposure to this emerging technology.\nFAQ\nAI in investing FAQ\nHow is AI being used in investing?\nAI is being used in investing in a number of ways, including algorithmic trading, sentiment analysis, and chatbot interfaces to help investors analyze data and ensure that their portfolios are diversified.\nCan I use AI for stock trading?\nThere isn't an AI that will fully automate stock trading for retail investors, but there are tools like Magnifi, an AI chatbot, that can help you invest better. AI can't fully replace human decision-making in investing, but it can help with research and other tasks.\nWhat is the best AI to invest in?\nSeveral different AI stocks have emerged as early winners in the AI boom, including GPU maker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AI server pro Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI). As the generative AI revolution evolves, we're likely to see more winners.\nCan AI really predict the stock market?\nSome professional traders use algorithmic trading tools to help them beat the market or predict trends, but no human or computer can accurately predict the stock market all the time.\nMarket prices move according to a wide range of unpredictable and news-driven inputs, and there's no formula that dictates stock movements, although there are patterns.\nIs it legal to use AI for stocks?\nIt is legal to use AI for stocks, but investors should be aware that there's no silver bullet in investing. While AI can help you with things like research and diversification, it's probably not as powerful as some investors might think."

      "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has grown rapidly in popularity, and businesses are starting to get in on the action. Companies are turning to AI in an attempt to increase productivity and decrease costs.\nBy tracking AI adoption rates, we can see which types of businesses and which parts of the country are incorporating AI the most. Even if it seems like businesses everywhere are integrating AI technology into their operations, that perception doesn't quite match reality.\nSo how many companies use AI, and where is it most common? The U.S. Census Bureau has been tracking this information as part of its biweekly Business Trends and Outlook Survey, which includes responses from 1.2 million businesses split into six rotating panels.\nExplore the latest AI statistics below, including current and projected usage rates nationwide, as well as at the state, city, sector, and business-size levels.\nNational AI Usage Rates\nNational AI Usage Rates\n- Current AI business usage rate: 9.2%\n- Projected AI business usage rate, next 6 months: 11.6%\nAlthough AI hasn't reached widespread adoption yet, usage is steadily growing. Business usage of AI has more than doubled, from 3.7% to 9.2% of companies surveyed by the U.S. Census Bureau since it started collecting this data in the fall of 2023. Projected AI usage has almost doubled, going from 6.3% to 11.6%.\nThose numbers might appear low given how AI is often discussed as a game changer for businesses. That could be for a few reasons.\nFirst, the Census survey asks specifically if AI has been used to produce goods or services, which respondents could interpret as excluding back-of-office functions that utilize AI, like marketing or project management.\nSecond, some businesses might be using AI tools without realizing they are powered by AI. Or their employees may be using AI even if the tools aren\u2019t recognized as part of an official business strategy.\nThird, AI use cases are still relatively narrow, and use on a large scale can be complex and expensive.\nAI Usage Rates by State\nAI Usage Rates by State\nUtah has the most AI business adoption so far, with a usage rate of 14.6%. It's followed by Montana, Arizona, Florida, and Massachusetts.\nIn terms of projected AI usage by businesses, Delaware is in the lead with a rate of 19.1%. Montana, Arizona, Nevada, and Utah round out the top five states for projected usage.\nPennsylvania has the lowest reported AI usage rate at 6.0%. Its projected usage rate is also the lowest at 7.0%.\nAfter Pennsylvania, the next four states with the lowest AI usage are Wisconsin, Oklahoma, Idaho, and Tennessee. The next lowest by projected usage are Arkansas, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and Iowa and New Mexico tied for fifth lowest.\nNot all states had AI usage rates available as of the most recent Business Trends and Outlook survey. It's possible that some states had higher or lower totals that went unreported. Also worth mentioning is that rates in some states can fluctuate quite a bit from survey to survey.\nAI Usage Rates by City\nAI Usage Rates by City\nThe greater San Diego area is currently the nationwide leader in current (16.0%) and projected AI business usage (19.9%). Other metropolitan areas with high AI usage among businesses include Boston-Cambridge-Newton, Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater, Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, and Washington D.C.-Arlington-Alexandria.\nAfter San Diego, the next four metropolitan areas by projected AI usage by businesses are Baltimore-Columbia-Towson, Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler, Boston-Cambridge-Newton, and Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach.\nAI Usage Rates by Sector\nAI Usage Rates by Sector\nInformation companies are leading the way in AI adoption, with a 24.2% usage rate and a 30.5% projected usage rate. Professional services and educational services companies also have high AI usage and projected usage.\nAI naturally fits into the information sector, which includes tech, media, and data companies. Many businesses in the space are digital first, which makes AI integration easier. Similarly, professional services are data- and communications-heavy industries with plenty of applications for AI tools.\nIn the most recent Business Trends and Outlook survey, accommodation and food services had the lowest AI usage, followed by the other services category, and then transportation and warehousing.\nHowever, there wasn't any data on current or projected AI usage available for the agriculture, management of companies, or mining sectors. Once again, it's possible that these sectors had higher or lower totals that went unreported.\nAI Usage Rates by Business Size\nAI Usage Rates by Business Size\nLarge companies are the most likely to use AI. The usage rate is 14.9% for businesses with at least 250 employees, 5.0% higher than at businesses of any other size. Businesses with 250 or more employees and 100 to 249 employees also have the highest projected AI usage rates.\nHowever, this doesn't mean that AI usage increases evenly with company size. Small businesses with one to four employees had the second-highest AI usage rate at 7.3%.\nWhat Workers are Using AI?\nWhat Types of Workers Are Using AI?\nAI usage is most common in the computer and mathematical field by a wide margin. Of queries sent to Claude.ai, 40.2% are in that category, according to a report by the Anthropic Economic Index. Here's a complete look at AI usage by occupational category based on Claude.ai queries.\nOutside of tech companies, other areas where AI is used fairly often are in education and library services; arts and media; office and administrative work; and life, physical, and social sciences. As you'd expect, jobs reliant on physical labor have the lowest AI usage rates. The most notable example is farming, fishing, and forestry, which accounted for just 0.1% of queries.\nStill, a growing number of occupations are using AI. The way they use AI depends heavily on the type of job.\nSome occupations predominantly use AI for automation, meaning the model directly completes a task with minimal human involvement. Computer systems administrators, web administrators, and software developers are the top occupations that use AI in this way.\nOther occupations mainly use AI for augmentation, where the model and the human work together on a task. Copywriters, editors, and instructional designers are the top occupations that use AI to augment their work.\nIs AI Adoption About to Take Off?\nNo industry has high AI adoption yet, but that could change over the next few years. Leading AI companies are seeing massive demand and making significant investments in product development.\nU.S. private AI investment reached a new high of $109 billion in 2024, according to Stanford HAI's 2025 AI Index Report. And many major tech companies have plans to increase their AI data center spending even more going forward. The Stargate Project is a recent example -- SoftBank, OpenAI, Oracle(NYSE:ORCL), and MGX are planning to invest $500 billion toward building new AI infrastructure in the United States.\nOne of the main drivers of AI adoption is the development of lower-cost models. These make it easier and more affordable for companies to integrate AI throughout their businesses. AI models are getting cheaper -- the cost of querying an AI model that scores the equivalent of GPT-3.5 went from $20 per million tokens in November 2022 down to $0.07 per million tokens by October 2024, according to Stanford HAI. That trend should continue, spurred by competition from Chinese AI company DeepSeek.\nHow much AI use increases will also depend on how it affects productivity. The early returns on this are promising, with studies finding that AI can boost worker productivity on certain tasks but not all of them. Businesses will need to evaluate which tasks are suitable for AI to best implement it in their operations.\nMethodology\nThe U.S. Census Bureau asked businesses if they had used AI to produce goods or services in the last two weeks and if they planned to use it in the next six months. Possible responses were \"yes,\" \"no,\" and \"do not know.\" AI usage and projected usage data is the percentage of businesses that answered \"yes\" to these questions.\nNot all states had this data available, but some had the percentages of \"no\" and \"do not know\" responses. For these states, we extrapolated AI usage by subtracting the percentage of businesses that answered \"no\" and \"do not know\" from 100%. Extrapolated data is denoted with an asterisk.\nSources\n- Anthropic (2025). \"Introducing the Anthropic Economic Index.\"\n- Stanford University Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (2025). \"The 2025 AI Index Report.\"\n- U.S. Census Bureau (2025). \u201cBusiness Trends and Outlook Survey.\u201d"

      "text": "Investing in growth stocks can be a great way to earn life-changing wealth in the stock market. The key, of course, is to know which growth stocks to buy and when.\nDespite increased volatility in the stock market in 2025, growth stocks continue to outperform. The S&P 500 Growth index climbed about 8.5% through the first five months of the year. Its counterpart, the S&P 500 Value index, was up just 2.2% during the same period.\nHowever, growth stocks don't always outperform during periods of volatility. In 2022, the S&P 500 Growth index fell 30% for the year, while the S&P 500 index dropped just 19%.\nPicking the right growth stock can help you weather the downside while profiting in the long run from their potential. Here's a handy guide to help you get started investing in growth stocks. With these tools and strategies, you can position your portfolio for long-term success with growth stocks.\nOverview\nWhat is a growth stock?\nGrowth stocks are companies that increase their earnings faster than the average business in their industry or the market as a whole. Growth investing, however, involves more than picking stocks that are going up.\nOften, a growth company has developed an innovative product or service that is gaining share in existing markets, entering new markets, or creating entirely new industries. The market tends to reward businesses that can grow faster than average for long periods, delivering handsome returns to shareholders in the process. The faster they grow, the bigger the potential returns.\nUnlike value stocks, high-growth stocks tend to be more expensive than the average in terms of profitability ratios. Despite their premium price tags, the best growth stocks can still deliver fortune-creating returns to investors.\nThat said, growth stocks can be much more volatile. In 2022, they took a beating in the market. Despite strong performances in 2023 and 2024, the S&P 500 Growth index total returns still lagged the returns of the broader index over the three-year period.\nHigh inflation puts pressure on growth stocks because it reduces the future value of their expected earnings. Supply chain constraints also affect the ability of some to expand, and other macroeconomic factors slow the entire economy. However, downturns can give long-term investors a buying opportunity when growth stock prices are low.\nTen growth stocks\nTop growth stocks in 2025\nTo provide you with some examples, here are 10 excellent growth stocks available in the stock market today.\n| Company name | Company ticker | Market cap | Industry |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Meta Platforms | NASDAQ:META | $1.9 trillion | Interactive Media and Services |\n| Shopify | NASDAQ:SHOP | $192 billion | IT Services |\n| Uber Technologies | NYSE:UBER | $189 billion | Road and Rail |\n| Block | NYSE:XYZ | $45 billion | Diversified Financial Services |\n| MercadoLibre | NASDAQ:MELI | $116 billion | Multiline Retail |\n| Nvidia | NASDAQ:NVDA | $4.4 trillion | Semiconductors and Semiconductor Equipment |\n| Netflix | NASDAQ:NFLX | $518 billion | Entertainment |\n| Amazon | NASDAQ:AMZN | $2.4 trillion | Multiline Retail |\n| Salesforce | NYSE:CRM | $222 billion | Software |\n| Alphabet | NASDAQ:GOOG | $2.4 trillion | Interactive Media and Services |\nAs this list shows, growth stocks come in all shapes and sizes. They can be found in a variety of industries, both within the U.S. and international markets. Although all the stocks on this list are from larger businesses, smaller companies can also be fertile ground for growth investors.\nA great way to invest in a wide variety of small-cap growth stocks is via an exchange-traded fund (ETF), such as Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund ETF (VBK -0.37%). This fund tracks the performance of the CRSP U.S. Small Cap Growth Index, which gives investors an easy way to invest in roughly 570 small-cap growth companies all at once.\nThe Vanguard Small-Cap Growth Index Fund ETF has an ultra-low expense ratio of 0.07%. This means investors will receive almost all the fund's returns, with only a small amount in fees going to Vanguard. (An annual expense ratio of 0.07% works out to only $0.70 in fees per $1,000 invested annually.)\nWhere to look\nHow to find growth stocks\nTo find great growth stocks, you'll need to:\n- Identify powerful long-term market trends and the companies best positioned to profit from them.\n- Narrow your list to businesses with strong competitive advantages.\n- Further narrow your list to companies with large addressable markets.\nIdentify trends\nIdentify trends and the companies driving them\nCompanies that capitalize on powerful long-term trends can increase their sales and profits for many years, generating wealth for their shareholders along the way. Here are some examples, along with the companies that can help you profit from those trends:\nE-commerce\nAs more people shop online, Amazon, Shopify, and Etsy (ETSY 1.41%) are well positioned to profit within the U.S. (and many international markets). MercadoLibre holds a leading share of the online retail market in Latin America. Despite the consistent presence of brick-and-mortar retail, e-commerce still has tons of growth potential as an industry.\nDigital advertising\nMeta (formerly Facebook) and Alphabet (which owns Google) own the lion's share of the digital ad market and are poised to profit handsomely as marketing budgets shift from TV and print to online channels. Amazon has built a massive advertising business, which continues to expand into new formats. Even Netflix has come around to advertising to increase its subscriber base and boost its revenue.\nDigital payments\nPayPal (PYPL -0.87%) and Block are helping accelerate the global shift from cash to digital payment forms by allowing businesses of all sizes to accept debit and credit card transactions and giving consumers easier access to cashless payments.\nCloud computing\nComputing power is migrating from on-premises data centers to cloud-based servers. Amazon's and Google's cloud infrastructure services help make this possible, while Salesforce provides some of the best cloud-based enterprise software available. The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) will require vast amounts of computing power that cloud providers are ready, willing, and able to offer.\nCloud Computing\nCord-cutting and streaming entertainment\nMillions are canceling their cable subscriptions and replacing them with less expensive and more convenient streaming options. As the global leader in streaming entertainment, Netflix offers a great way to profit from this trend, but it faces growing competition from other media companies.\nElectric and autonomous vehicles\nThe world is shifting from its reliance on gasoline to using electricity to power vehicles. According to a survey of industry executives, half of all auto sales could be electric vehicles (EVs) by 2030. Tesla (TSLA 2.85%) has been the leader in the space with its lineup of vehicles and battery technology. Chinese company BYD's (BYDDY -0.84%) (BYDD.F -1.09%) automotive segment has ascended rapidly to become the leading EV maker in the world, thanks to its low-priced vehicles.\nBoth EV makers have made significant progress in developing self-driving technology for their cars. However, Alphabet's Waymo has a clear lead in the space, offering a commercial service in several U.S. cities and completing more than 250,000 rides per week. Uber has emerged as a key partner for autonomous vehicle companies looking to deploy their fleet and maximize their capital utilization, and it could be a hidden beneficiary of the growing number of self-driving cars on the road.\nArtificial intelligence\nCompanies have recently poured billions into accelerating their AI development and applying it to their businesses. Nvidia has been a big beneficiary since it designs the chips used to train many large language models (the foundation of generative AI).\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft (MSFT -0.16%) also benefit from growth in AI applications since many run on their cloud computing platforms. Salesforce is leveraging its position in enterprise software to help companies use their own data to create AI-powered agents.\nThe key is to try investing in these trends and companies as early as possible. The earlier you get in, the more you stand to profit. However, the most powerful trends can last for many years -- even decades -- giving you plenty of time to claim your share of the profits they create.\nCompetitive advantages\nPrioritize companies with competitive advantages\nIt's also important to invest in growth companies that possess strong competitive advantages. Otherwise, their competitors may pass them, and their growth may not last long.\nCompetitive advantages become especially important during turbulent times, such as during a pandemic or periods of high inflation. A strong competitive advantage will help companies survive and thrive through market downturns, while those without one will struggle.\nWe saw a big sell-off in many tech-focused growth stocks in 2022. Many top growth stocks' share prices were slashed by more than 50%, but some of the biggest stock market losers of the year turned out to be the biggest winners in 2023 and 2024.\nIf you can identify stocks of companies with strong competitive advantages being sold off along with the rest of the market, it can be an opportunity to generate massive returns as they recover. Some competitive advantages are:\n- Network effects: Meta's Facebook is a prime example here. Each person who joins its social media platform makes it more valuable to other members. Network effects can make it difficult for new entrants to displace the current market share leader. Meta's 3.4 billion users across its family of apps certainly make it unlikely that a new social media company will displace it.\n- Scale advantages: Size can be another powerful advantage. Amazon is a great example in this category because smaller rivals will find it extremely difficult to replicate its massive global fulfillment network.\n- High switching costs: Switching costs are the expenses and difficulties associated with switching to a rival's product or service. Shopify, an online retail system for more than 1 million businesses, is a perfect example of a business with high switching costs. Once a company begins using Shopify as the core of its online operations, it's unlikely to go through the hassle of switching to a competitor.\nWhy invest in growth stocks\nWhy invest in growth stocks\nGrowth stocks offer some of the highest return potential of all the companies available in the stock market. As is the case with any individual stock pick, the reason to invest in a growth stock is that you expect it to outperform the overall market. Better yet, if you can find a growth stock trading at a price that mitigates the inherent risks involved in investing in growth stocks, you can do very well with your investment in the long run.\nThe appeal of growth stocks over value stocks and those paying high dividends is that the company's management is given more freedom and flexibility to invest in new opportunities. Without demands on its capital or as much pressure on quarterly profits, management may take a long-term view to grow the value of the business. That will ultimately benefit buy-and-hold investors who patiently stick with the company as it builds the business.\nRelated investing topics\nOpportunity\nFind companies with large addressable markets\nFinally, you'll want to invest in businesses with large addressable markets and long runways for growth still ahead. Industry reports from research firms -- such as Gartner (IT -1.32%) and Insider Intelligence, which provide estimates of industry sizes, projections for growth, and market share figures -- can be very helpful.\nThe larger the opportunity, the larger a business can ultimately become. And the earlier in its growth cycle it is, the longer it can continue to grow at an impressive rate.\nFAQ\nFAQ: Growth stocks\nWhat are growth stocks?\nGrowth stocks are shares of companies expected to increase their revenue and earnings faster than the average business in their industry or the market as a whole. They generally trade for high price multiples and experience more price volatility than the average stock.\nWhat growth stock is going to boom in 2025?\nThe stock market prices future expectations for each company into its stock price. If a company exceeds expectations, it'll likely see its stock price increase. So, the stocks expected to rise the most in 2025 are those that outperform market expectations.\nWhat is an example of a growth stock?\nOne example of a growth stock is Amazon. Its shares are usually considered expensive by traditional valuation measures, like price-to-earnings (P/E) or price-to-sales (P/S) ratios. However, the company continuously invests to grow its business and expand into new markets and industries. The long-term potential profit remains extremely high.\nWhat are the best stocks for growth?\nThe best stocks for growth are usually smaller companies with unique competitive advantages in large or potentially large addressable markets. They are typically expensive relative to their peers, but the company's upside justifies the stock price.\nWhat is the difference between a growth stock and a value stock?\nGrowth stocks tend to exhibit faster and less predictable revenue growth compared to value stocks, which are much more predictable from year to year. Over the long run, growth stocks are expected to grow revenue and earnings much faster than value stocks. Value stocks typically trade based on their valuation, while growth stocks may trade on momentum and how their financial results and managements' outlooks compare to expectations.\nExpert Q&A on growth stocks\nDr. Preston D. Cherry, PhD, CFP\nThe Motley Fool: What's your best advice on finding high potential stocks like growth stocks?\nDr. Cherry: Because growth stocks tend to operate in a growth business cycle or business sector, finding high potential growth stocks should contain metrics that attempt to confirm or support current growth and best signal sustainable growth patterns. One important feature of a growth company is to ask, \"do they possess a unique business service or product in their sector that provides a valuable moat?\" This service or product is the lifeline of growth where the company needs to market, produce, deliver, and protect better than competitors and new entrants. Performance metrics to consider are whether the company shows historical increases in earnings over select periods and profit margin analysis, which illustrates how a company can manage costs and increase revenues. Other analysis considerations are the technical chart trend characteristics and experienced market analysts' forward growth and price projections.\nThe Motley Fool: Are growth stocks risky?\nDr. Cherry: Investing in individual stocks, in general, contains risk factors such as overall market risk and business risk, among others. The characteristics of growth stocks can make them riskier than their value stock counterparts. As their name suggests, growth stock companies tend to be in a growing business phase. The growing stage could consist of younger and smaller companies with an unproven product or entity track record that tend to use much of their revenues and raised capital to grow the business. These growth characteristics, among others, tend to make growth stocks riskier through higher stock price volatility or reactions to market, company, economic, and political risks, to name a few, thus more significant exposure to downside stock price pressure. However, as investors should avail themselves of the downside cautions of growth stock risk, the upside potential should also be considered. With additional risk comes the prospect of added returns. Because growth companies have the potential for higher company growth rates, growing from earlier business stages to mature business stages, growth stocks could potentially experience higher returns over shorter time horizons. Above all, investors should consider their risk tolerance, capacity, portfolio allocations, and goals to accept the higher risk of growth stocks.\nThe Motley Fool: How do you tell the difference between a growth vs. value stock?\nDr. Cherry: Growth and value stocks tend to differ in a few areas, such as company size, business stage, and revenues to return gains to the shareholder. Growth stocks tend to be in the emerging markets or small or mid-cap company size areas whereas value stock companies tend to be large-cap. The size of companies tends to be the lens of what business stage a company resides. Growth stocks tend to be in the early to mid-business stages, the growth stages (although a small segment of large companies can be growth companies too), and value stock companies tend to be larger, more mature business stage companies. The value stock companies tend to be trading at a discount, \"on-sale,\" or a premium, \"overvalued,\" to their valuation, thus their name, finding value. Growth stock companies tend to reinvest their earnings back into the company and return value to shareholders solely through stock price appreciation. In comparison, value companies may return earnings to investors through a dividend, representing income to an investor and complements stock price appreciation. This income and stock price appreciation mean a total return approach.\nScott Stewart, PhD\nThe Motley Fool: How do you tell the difference between a growth vs. value stock?\nDr. Stewart: The Gordon valuation model is an excellent tool to illustrate the difference between growth and value stocks. Professor Gordon\u2019s model, with some simplifying assumptions, shows that stock prices equal next year\u2019s earnings (e) divided by the expression r \u2013 g, where \u201cr\u201d is a discount rate and \u201cg\u201d is a growth rate. For the same stock price, a lower growth rate necessitates a higher earnings number. Conversely, (illustrated by dividing both sides by e) a high-p/e stock is associated with a high growth rate. Of course, these numbers reflect investor expectations.\nInvestors bid up the p/e ratios of some stocks because, despite low current earnings relative to their market values, they expect earnings to grow at high rates. These are traditionally defined as growth stocks. Tesla stock is a good example of a growth stock, with its 154 p/e multiple and 73% earnings growth rate (using Yahoo Finance data).\nThe Motley Fool: Are growth stocks risky?\nDr. Stewart: Note that a company\u2019s risk is embedded in its discount rate \u201cr.\u201d As a result, companies with stable earnings will justify higher p/e multiples than ones with volatile earnings, other things equal. Clorox, a large-cap, stable-earnings company with only modest growth expectations (basically 0% using Yahoo Finance data) still justifies a p/e of 30 (using next fiscal year\u2019s earnings).\nEmpirical evidence suggests that high-growth stocks underperform low-growth, low-p/e \u201cvalue\u201d stocks over the very long term. For example, the Russell small-cap Value index yielded roughly 3% a year higher than its Growth peer over the forty years ending 2019, and at lower return volatility. One explanation is that investors over-estimate the sustainability of high-growing companies since these \u201cglamour\u201d stocks subsequently fail to deliver on those high expectations. However, there can be long periods in which growth stocks outperform, such as the 10 years ending 2020.\nThe theory and evidence suggest that the key to picking good growth stocks is to identify the ones whose earnings growth rates will accelerate in the short term (increasing the p/e and price) and not disappoint in the long term (sustaining e growth and maintaining a high p/e). For value stocks, some practitioners suggest picking companies that investors have given up on (ones with very low-p/e or other multiples if e is less than zero), that won\u2019t fail in the short-term and will recover in the long-term. Not easy tasks!"

Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo!

      "text": "In addition to attracting new customers, many companies strive to expand relationships with clients who are already purchasing their products and services. Net revenue retention has become one of the most important drivers of success for many businesses.\nDefinition\nWhat is net revenue retention?\nNet revenue retention is a comparative metric that tracks average spending from the same customers across two time periods. In most cases, net revenue retention will compare sales from customer pools annually or across the same quarter in different fiscal years.\nWhen customers increase their average spending, a company's net revenue retention rate will be above 100%. For example, a company will have a net revenue retention rate of 105% in a given period if its retained customers have increased their spending an average of 5% year over year. Alternatively, posting a net revenue retention rate of 95% would mean that sales among that customer cohort had actually declined 5% compared to the prior-year period.\nHow does it work?\nHow does net revenue retention work?\nNet revenue retention tracks spending among customers who have continued to use a company's services. If a company is able to increase average spending from its retained customers across comparable periods, it will have net revenue retention above 100%. This can be done by raising the prices of its services or by selling additional offerings to existing customers.\nSpending from new customers in a given fiscal quarter does not factor into a company's net revenue retention rate. Additionally, the difference in spending that results from former customers ceasing to use a company's services is not included in net revenue retention calculations. As a result, a company can have net revenue retention above 100% and still record an overall sales decline if its total customer count shrinks.\nMarketing Strategy\nWhy is it important?\nWhy is net revenue retention important?\nIf a business can record strong net revenue retention, it has a way to grow sales beyond just attracting new customers. Increasing spending from existing customers can also offer companies more efficient paths to growth. Rather than having to spend money on sales and marketing initiatives to attract new customers, businesses can expand relationships with clients who are already using their services.\nNet revenue retention has become a particularly important metric to watch in the software industry. Many companies using the software-as-a-service (SaaS) model now concentrate on building out an encompassing ecosystem that offers multiple services on a subscription basis. Once a client has been brought into the ecosystem, businesses have opportunities to sell other services and can increase their net revenue retention.\nRelated investing topics\nExample\nAn example of net revenue retention in action\nCrowdStrike (CRWD 0.43%) is a cybersecurity company with a business model that revolves heavily around sustaining high levels of net revenue retention. The company has established a benchmark goal of having a net revenue retention rate of at least 120% each quarter, which means that it aims to grow spending by 20% annually among customers that are already using its services.\nCustomers purchasing additional services have helped the cybersecurity specialist record strong net revenue retention. For example, the number of customers using at least five of its service modules was up 52% annually at the end of its last fiscal year. Meanwhile, the number of clients using six or more modules was up 62%, and the number of clients using seven or more modules was up 75%.\nIn its last fiscal year, CrowdStrike actually managed to record a net revenue retention rate above 125% in each quarter. Along with 41% annual growth for the company's total customer count, this allowed the company to increase overall revenue by 54% in the fiscal year."

      "text": "One of the fastest-growing stocks in artificial intelligence (AI) over the last year is Palantir Technologies (PLTR -2.27%). Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) brought eye-popping productivity gains to its customers. Investors took notice, as the stock is up by 420% over the last year.\nUnfortunately for investors who have recently taken an interest, its forward P/E ratio is 205, and it sells for 96 times sales. Knowing that, three contributing analysts from The Motley Fool have weighed in to determine whether its stock is still worth buying at these levels.\nIs Palantir a repeat lesson from the dot-com era?\nJustin Pope: Separating noise from signal is arguably the most challenging aspect of investing.\nFor Palantir, the noise is a red-hot stock price. Shares of Palantir have risen a mind-melting 1,770% since 2023. In other words, buying the stock up to this point has looked like a genius move. Anyone seeing this, especially on social media, where people aren't always humble, might feel tempted to jump into the stock.\nBut here is the signal. The stock is rising faster than Palantir's underlying business has grown. Don't get me wrong, I think Palantir is an excellent AI stock, and the company is executing at a high level, particularly since launching AIP two years ago.\nIt can make a stock appear invincible when prices only go up. However, investors have seen this movie before. Cisco Systems ran to wildly excessive valuations during the infamous dot-com bubble in the late 1990s. It lost most of its value when the bubble burst, and still hasn't revisited its all-time high, a whopping 25 years later.\nThat doesn't mean that Palantir will suffer the same fate, but check this out. Cisco's P/E ratio peaked at approximately 234, and its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio peaked at around 39. Palantir is even more expensive today than Cisco at its peak.\nAt the very least, it's hard to imagine much more rational upside in Palantir from these levels. Even worse, any market downturn or misfire in Palantir's business could pop that valuation bubble. Investors should tread very carefully around Palantir stock these days.\nAmazon's stock history holds a valuable lesson for those worried about Palantir's lofty valuation\nJake Lerch: Here's a sentiment that I often hear: \"I love the stock, but it's too late to buy it now.\"\nAnd while there's nothing wrong with this viewpoint in theory, I've seen it disproven too many times in practice to grant it much weight. Take Amazon, for example.\nFor years, countless analysts pointed out -- for good reason -- that Amazon's valuation was sky-high. From 1997 through 2000, Amazon's average P/S ratio was around 16. Moreover, the company had no profits -- and therefore no P/E ratio -- until 2003. Once it was making money, Amazon's average P/E ratio over its first five years of profitability was an eye-popping 88.\nYet, investors who bought Amazon -- and held until today -- would be very happy with the results. In fact, $10,000 invested in the stock in 2008 would be worth about $800,000 today.\nThis is all to point out that valuation isn't everything.\nYes, Palantir is an expensive stock by just about any measure. Its current P/S and P/E ratios are significantly higher than the historical averages I cited for Amazon.\nHowever, that's because Palantir is poised to deliver enormous growth over the next decade or more. The company offers a unique value proposition that appeals to almost every organization. It can deliver efficiency gains for government agencies; it can cut costs for commercial clients. It can even help military and intelligence agencies win wars and prevent terrorist attacks. Simply put, there's very little this company can't do.\nLastly, the nature of AI and data analysis means that Palantir is positioned to benefit from significant network effects and economies of scale as its AI systems improve and the company's overall client list grows. On top of that, its revenue is already growing at a year-over-year rate of 39%, and profits are increasing, as is free cash flow.\nThat's what gives me confidence to believe it's not too late to buy Palantir stock.\nPalantir is a winner for customers, but not investors\nWill Healy: When it comes to AI living up to its potential, perhaps no stock outshines Palantir. The company began in 2003 and utilizes AI and machine learning as a national security-focused tool.\nHowever, it was only when Palantir began to benefit from AIP's massive productivity gains that its popularity took off. Anduril Industries had a 200-fold efficiency gain in its ability to respond to supply shortages. A global insurer reduced an underwriting workflow from two weeks to three hours. With results like that, it is little wonder its commercial customer count is up fivefold over the past three years.\nSuch gains undoubtedly played a role in the aforementioned stock price growth, but regrettably for Palantir bulls, the increases likely do not justify the software-as-a-service (SaaS) stock's valuation, and here's why.\nIn Q1, revenue of $884 million rose 39% compared to year-ago levels. With that growth, its net income of $214 million surged 103% higher over the same period. Unfortunately, triple-digit growth is not sustainable for even the best of companies, and the current valuation likely prices it for perfection.\nThat \"perfection\" is likely not in the cards for Palantir. Analysts forecast revenue growth will slow to 36% for 2025 before falling to 29% in 2026. That is likely to do little to make the 96 P/S ratio more attractive, particularly when the larger and faster-growing Nvidia sells for 24 times sales.\nIndeed, Palantir is likely to play a key role in the AI field for years to come. Nonetheless, valuation matters at some point, and investors could find themselves stuck in a losing stock for years to come if the sentiment around the stock starts to turn negative."

      "text": "Palantir Technologies (PLTR -2.27%) started as many companies do: Its founders (Peter Thiel, Stephen Cohen, Joe Lonsdale, and current CEO Alex Carp) couldn't find the right solution for their needs. In this case, they needed software technology that allowed collaboration without sacrificing data security. That led them to start building Palantir in 2003.\nAt its core, Palantir Technologies is a software company. It builds digital infrastructure to help organizations better manage their secure data. Its focus on data security has made it a key software provider for the U.S. government and large corporations.\nPalantir has also begun leveraging its expertise in data by providing customers with artificial intelligence (AI) solutions to help them get the most from their data. The company launched its Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) in 2023. It has quickly become an AI leader, with unrelenting demand for its leading capabilities.\nPalantir's AI-driven growth potential might have you wondering how to invest in its stock. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to buy stock in the data software company and some factors to consider before adding shares to your portfolio.\nStock Ticker\nHow to buy\nHow to buy Palantir Technologies stock\nInvestors considering buying Palantir Technologies stock will need to take a few steps before becoming shareholders. This six-step guide will show you how to add the data software company to your portfolio:\n- Open your brokerage app: Log in to your brokerage account where you handle your investments.\n- Search for the stock: Enter the ticker or company name into the search bar to bring up the stock's trading page.\n- Decide how many shares to buy: Consider your investment goals and how much of your portfolio you want to allocate to this stock.\n- Select order type: Choose between a market order to buy at the current price or a limit order to specify the maximum price you're willing to pay.\n- Submit your order: Confirm the details and submit your buy order.\n- Review your purchase: Check your portfolio to ensure your order was filled as expected and adjust your investment strategy accordingly.\nShould I invest?\nShould I invest in Palantir Technologies?\nExamining all the data and doing your due diligence is essential before buying shares of any company. This process might confirm your investment thesis or change your mind about buying shares.\nHere are a few factors that could lead you to buy shares of Palantir:\n- You strongly believe Palantir's stock will outperform the S&P 500 over the next three to five years.\n- You're a buy-and-hold investor who plans to own Palantir shares for several years.\n- You believe Palantir's AI platform will continue to be a huge growth driver.\n- You think Palantir's profitability will continue improving.\n- You believe Palantir can grow into its rather lofty valuation.\n- You prefer to invest in cash-rich, debt-free companies generating growing free cash flow.\n- Investing in Palantir would help diversify your portfolio.\n- You like to invest in founder-led companies.\n- You don't need dividend income from your investment.\nBuy-and-Hold Strategy\nOn the other hand, here are some things that might lead you away from buying its stock:\n- You're not exactly sure what Palantir does.\n- You're not convinced Palantir can deliver market-beating returns in the coming years.\n- You think AI is a fad.\n- You're a more value-focused investor and think Palantir trades at a very high valuation.\n- You already own several technology stocks.\n- Given the country's deficits and debt, you're concerned about Palantir's exposure to the U.S. government (more than 40% of its total revenue in the first quarter of 2025).\n- You're in or nearing retirement and need income-generating investments.\nProfitability\nIs Palantir Technologies profitable?\nCrunching the data on a company's profitability is crucial to researching a stock. Historically, profit growth is a key driver of stock price returns over the long term. Here's a closer look at Palantir Technologies' profitability.\nPalantir Technologies' earnings are growing rapidly. The company's generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income was $214 million ($0.08 per share) in the first quarter of 2025, more than double the $105 million from a year earlier.\nPalantir is also generating growing free cash flow. It produced $370 million of adjusted free cash flow during the first quarter of 2025 (a robust 42% margin). That grew its cash balance to more than $5.4 billion at the end of the third quarter (including cash, equivalents, and short-term U.S. Treasury securities). The balance allowed the company to start returning cash to investors via a $1 billion share repurchase program in mid-2023.\nThe company believes its revenue, earnings, and cash flow will continue growing, driven by robust demand for its AIP. That growing profitability could help drive its share price higher in the future.\nDividends\nDoes Palantir Technologies pay a dividend?\nPalantir Technologies had not yet started paying a dividend as of mid-2025. While the data analytics company hadn't started making dividend payments, it had begun returning cash to shareholders.\nGiven that it has only recently started earning a profit and launched a share repurchase program, the company likely won't initiate a dividend anytime soon.\nETF options\nETFs with exposure to Palantir Technologies\nInvestors who are unsure whether they want to invest directly in Palantir stock can still gain some exposure to the data software company. An alternative strategy is to make a passive investment by purchasing a fund that holds its stock. One of the most common passive investment vehicles is an exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nExchange-Traded Fund (ETF)\nAccording to ETF.com, 374 ETFs held more than 390.4 million shares of Palantir Technologies as of mid-2025. The Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI -0.3%) was the biggest holder, with more than 66.6 million shares. However, the fund had only a small allocation to Palantir, so it might not be the best way for investors to gain passive exposure to the data company.\nOn the other hand, the REX AI Equity Premium Income ETF (AIPI 0.09%) had the biggest allocation, at 9.4%. Palantir was the fund's third-largest holding, making the ETF a potentially attractive alternative option for investors seeking exposure to the data software company.\nStock splits\nWill Palantir Technologies stock split?\nPalantir Technologies didn't have an upcoming stock split on the calendar as of mid-2025. The data specialist had not completed a stock split since its direct public market listing in 2020.\nShares of Palantir surged in 2024 and through mid-2025, reaching around $135 towards the end of June. That was their highest level since going public. The stock had rocketed by more than 1,300% since its listing. If shares continue rising, Palantir might need to consider a stock split.\nRelated investing topics\nThe bottom line on Palantir Technologies\nPalantir Technologies co-founder and CEO Alex Karp is extremely optimistic about the future. In the company's first-quarter 2025 earnings release, he stated: \"We are in the middle of a tectonic shift in the adoption of our software.\u201d Karp also noted that: \"We are delivering the operating system for the modern enterprise in the era of AI.\"\nThere's a lot of competition in the AI space. However, Palantir has positioned itself as an early winner. That makes it a potentially compelling investment opportunity for those seeking exposure to the AI megatrend.\nFAQ\nInvesting in Palantir Technologies FAQ\nIs Palantir a good stock to invest in?\nAccording to Wall Street analysts who follow the company, Palantir had a consensus rating of \"hold\" as of July 2025. Its stock price at the time (around $135) was well above the average analyst 12-month price target of $101.32 per share.\nHowever, that doesn't mean you should follow their advice and hold shares. Those who believe Palantir's AIP will be a major growth driver might still want to buy shares. Conversely, people needing dividend income or concerned about valuation might wish to sell and invest that money in another stock.\nWhat is a fair price for Palantir stock?\nThe consensus 12-month price target among analysts who cover Palantir was $101.32 per share as of July 2025. The highest price forecast was $155 per share, while the lowest was $40 per share. That compares to a stock price of around $135 a share at that time.\nIs Palantir a public company?\nPalantir Technologies is a publicly traded company. It trades on the NASDAQ under the stock ticker PLTR.\nDoes Palantir pay a dividend?\nPalantir did not pay dividends as of mid 2025. However, the company had started returning cash to investors. Its board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program in mid-2023.\nWhere will Palantir be in 5 years?\nNo one can accurately predict where Palantir will be in five years. Some highly ranked investors believe its share price could top $250 or even $500 in five years. Driving those bullish views is the potential for accelerated growth due to the immense market size for generative AI.\nHowever, others are less optimistic about the stock's future due to the company's current valuation, which is very high.\nGiven this, there's a range of outcomes for Palantir. There is the potential for shares to more than double in five years if everything goes as planned. It's also possible that the stock could underperform if its growth rate slows. Palantir is a higher-risk stock with high reward potential.\nCould Palantir be the next Nvidia?\nYes, Palantir could be the next Nvidia. The company is growing extremely fast. Its revenue jumped 39% in the first quarter of 2025. It's also growing its profitability and margins. That growth has driven the stock higher, much like Nvidia's AI-powered growth has fueled the surge in its stock price in recent years. If Palantir continues to deliver strong revenue and profit growth, it could follow in Nvidia's footsteps and become a massive growth stock.\nHowever, if its growth starts to slow, then it will likely fall short of delivering Nvidia-like returns.\nWhat is the rule of 40 in Palantir?\nThe Rule of 40 is a financial metric used for measuring software as a service (SaaS) companies. It suggests that a healthy SaaS company should have a combined revenue growth rate and profit margin of 40% or above. During the first quarter of 2025, Palantir had an exceptional Rule of 40 score of 83%."

      "text": "Volatility is troublesome for many investors. Value changes in your stocks, your portfolio, or an index can keep you up at night -- or worse, push you to make emotional decisions you later regret. Understanding an asset's potential for volatility by way of a few calculations can help you keep a level head when stock prices falter.\nStandard deviation\nStandard deviation as a volatility measure\nTo analyze volatility, you start by creating a dataset that includes the daily closing values of a stock or an index. The longer the timeframe you use, the more reliable the results will be.\nUsing the closing values, you will first calculate the asset's daily returns. With those values, you can use a spreadsheet program like Microsoft Excel to calculate the asset's standard deviation.\nInvestors use standard deviation as a proxy for volatility. To interpret standard deviation as it pertains to volatility, you must understand the assumptions of a normal bell curve. When data is normally distributed, 68% of the values fall within one standard deviation, and 95% of the values fall within two standard deviations.\nWhen a stock has a standard deviation of 10%, the assumption is that its price fluctuations will remain within 10%, higher or lower, 68% of the time. Two standard deviations, or 20% higher or lower, should encompass 95% of price change scenarios. This interpretation is not ironclad, however. The drawbacks are discussed in the final section below.\nMicrosoft Excel\nHow to calculate volatility with Microsoft Excel\nTo demonstrate the process, we will use 10 days of closing values for the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX:^GSPC). In practice, you would need a much larger dataset to achieve statistical significance.\n1. Calculate percentage changes. Using data in Column C, calculate the daily percentage change in the index. Starting with cell D4, the formula is the current day's closing value divided by the previous day's closing value minus 1, or (C4/C3)-1.\nPro tip: If you place your cursor in D4, where you have the formula, you can quickly populate cells D5 through D12. Do this by hovering your cursor over the lower right corner of D4 until you see a plus sign, then click, hold, and drag your cursor to D12.\n2. Find the daily standard deviation. Now, you will use the STDEV.S function in Excel. Place your cursor in D13 and type '=STDEV.S(D4:D12)' without the quotation marks. This formula calculates the standard deviation of the dataset.\n3. Annualize the standard deviation. Next, you will convert the daily value to an annualized one. To do this, multiply the daily volatility by the square root of 252, which is the number of trading days in a year. In cell D14, type '=SQRT(252)*D13' without the quotes. This tells you the annualized volatility of the index is 10.39% based on the sample data.\nIf you want to know the asset's weekly volatility, multiply the daily volatility by the square root of 5, or the number of trading days in a week. Using the formula '=SQRT(5)*D13' indicates that the weekly volatility is 1.46%.\nCalculating portfolio volatility\nCalculating portfolio volatility\nYou can also calculate the volatility of an entire portfolio, but this formula is far more complex. To keep things simple, we will explain the formula assuming a two-stock portfolio. The data points you need are:\n- The portfolio weight of Stock 1 and Stock 2. Calculate this by dividing the value of each position by the total portfolio value. Let's label these values W1 and W2.\n- The standard deviation of Stock 1 and Stock 2. You can calculate these values using the formula explained above. We will label these SD1 and SD2.\n- The covariance, or relational movement, between Stock 1 and Stock 2. This will be one value for your two-stock portfolio, and we can call it C12. Use the CORREL function in Excel to calculate this value, applied to the two series of daily values for the two stocks.\nThe portfolio variance formula is: (W1^2)(SD1^2)+(W2^2)(SD2^2)+(2xW1xW2xC12). Note that '^2' means to the power of 2.\nThe logic underlying the formula is complicated. As you can see, the equation will be increasingly cumbersome as you add more stocks to your portfolio.\nRelated investing topics\nDrawbacks of using standard deviation\nDrawbacks of using standard deviation as a volatility measure\nStandard deviation measurements assume returns are normally distributed. Normal distribution, known as the bell curve, assumes more results clustered near the center and fewer results that are significantly above or below average.\nIn reality, stock prices and index values can have asymmetrical distributions. They can stay unusually high or low for long periods. In addition, stock or index volatility can change over time, which challenges the assumption of a constant statistical distribution of returns.\nWhile performing historical volatility calculations helps construct a view of an asset's behavior, investors only have data for what's already occurred. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that historical patterns will repeat. For that reason, standard deviation analysis should be one aspect of a much broader analysis to predict how a stock might behave."
