  "title": "'How do we get down?' RFK Jr., Dr. Oz climb boulder in video stunt",
  "description": "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Dr. Mehmet Oz went hiking together in a video posted to social media.",
  "content": "A video of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Medicare administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz climbing a large rock and hiking through Colorado's Garden of the Gods has been circulating online.\n\nIn the three-and-a-half-minute-long video posted Wednesday, Aug. 13, on Kennedy's official HHS X page, he and Oz are seen at the Garden of the Gods in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In a separate X post on Kennedy's personal page, the secretary wrote that he and Oz went hiking during a break between their speeches at the National Governors Conference, which took place July 25-26.\n\nKennedy speaks in the public service announcement video about how daily hiking has benefitted his life, improving his focus, clarity and creativity. He says that hiking also exposes him to \"sunlight,\" which he calls \"medicine\" since it is a source of vitamin D.\n\n\"Fifteen minutes outside can change your day \u2212 and your life. It sharpens your mind, strengthens your body, and restores the connection so many of us have lost \u2212 to each other, to nature, and to ourselves,\" Kennedy wrote in the post. \"Thanks @DrOzCMS for joining me on this hike.\"\n\nAa around the two-minute and 30-second mark in the video, Kennedy says, \"We got to go, this mountain is not going to climb itself.\" As the video cuts to Kennedy, 71, climbing the mountain, he appears wobbly as he pulls himself up onto a boulder. Oz, 65, follows behind him and appears to need Kennedy's assistance to reach the boulder.\n\n\"So how do we get down?\" Oz says in the video, before sliding back down with Kennedy.\n\nSome naturally poked fun at the video, calling it an \"SNL skit\" or mocking it as cringe. Others mocked Kennedy's jeans, which he'd also worn during a July hike in sweltering Arizona in an image shared publicly, much to the amusement of social media.\n\nSupporters echoed Kennedy and Oz's message about getting outside and encouraged others to go on walks.\n\nSince being appointed as HHS secretary by President Donald Trump, Kennedy has faced criticism over changes in COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for children and pregnant people, as well as his cuts to vaccine programs. He has been an advocate for natural medical and health methods, including improving food quality by eliminating certain dyes and additives.\n\nJonathan Limehouse covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Texas AG asks judge to arrest Beto O'Rourke for redistricting battle fundraising\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton is asking a judge to jail Beto O'Rourke, claiming the former Democratic congressman violated a court order by fundraising to support the dozens of state Democratic lawmakers who have fled the state amid its redistricting battle.\nThe attorney general\u2019s request builds on a previous order, granted by a Texas county judge earlier this month, barring O\u2019Rourke and his nonprofit, Powered by People, from raising money to help fund the Democratic lawmakers\u2019 exodus from the state more than a week ago. Paxton claimed in his filing to the Tarrant County court on Aug. 12 that O\u2019Rourke violated the fundraising block by soliciting donations through the Democrats\u2019 ActBlue platform.\n\"He\u2019s about to find out that running your mouth and ignoring the rule of law has consequences in Texas,\" Paxton said in a statement released alongside the filing. \"It\u2019s time to lock him up.\"\nPaxton\u2019s move is the latest in growing escalations between Democrats and Republicans in the Lone Star state, as the standoff over GOP attempts to redraw congressional boundaries in Texas. The redistricting attempt could add another five Republican seats to Congress ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, and is seen as blatant gerrymandering efforts by Democrats.\nIn response, Democrats decamped the state en masse, many taking refuge in blue-led states like Illinois and New York, to prevent the vote from taking place in Austin, Texas, where the Republicans\u2019 firm majority would all but guarantee the revised maps pass.\nTexas Republican Gov. Greg Abbott ordered the arrest of the dozens of Democratic lawmakers who have fled while Paxton asked the state Supreme Court to oust them from office over their absence, arguing they abandoned their seats.\nIn the first sentence of the court filing, Paxton quoted the former congressman at an Aug. 9 Fort Worth event saying: \"There are no refs in this game, f--- the rules,\" claiming O\u2019Rourke was \"disparaging\u201d the previous court order.\nIn response, O\u2019Rourke posted the full clip of his speech at the event to X, saying that Paxton took his words out of context in the filing. In the full recorded video of the speech, O\u2019Rourke is speaking about the Democrats\u2019 attempts to put forward their own revised maps in states like California, New Jersey, Maryland, and Illinois, telling the crowd that blue states should redistrict now and \"not wait for Texas to move first.\"\n\"You may say to yourself, 'Well, those aren\u2019t the rules,'\" O\u2019Rourke says immediately after speaking about the Democrats\u2019 redistricting efforts. \"There are no refs in this game, f--- the rules, we are going to win. Whatever it takes, we are going to take this to them in every way that we can.\"\nO\u2019Rourke said in his post on X on Aug. 12 that the attorney general's office lied in its filing.\n\"We\u2019re seeking maximum sanctions in response to his abuse of office,\" he said. \"Taking the fight directly to this corrupt, lying thug.\"\nAlong with jail time, the attorney general is also requesting O\u2019Rourke be held in contempt and fined $500.\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Kennedy Jr. canceling funding for mRNA vaccine development.\n\"People are going to die because we're cutting short funding for this technology,\" Adams said in a CBS interview Aug. 10.\nAdams served from 2017 through the end of Trump's first term, when the administration helped develop mRNA vaccines to combat COVID-19 through Operation Warp Speed. Adams described the initiative as Trump's greatest achievement \"bar none\" and said it's concerning that his administration is turning away from the mRNA technology.\nMessenger RNA, or mRNA, is used in the two most common COVID-19 vaccines licensed in the United States. Adams, citing other experts, said it would've taken 18 to 24 months longer to develop the vaccines without the technology.\n\"By the most conservative estimates, at least 2 million lives were saved,\" Adams said. \"Many people say that up to 20 million lives were saved because of the vaccines.\"\nIn a video posted on X Aug. 5, Kennedy said the decision to cut funding for mRNA vaccine development will impact 22 projects worth nearly $500 million at the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, which helps companies develop medical supplies to address public health threats.\nKennedy called the vaccine technology \"ineffective,\" which Adams said is \"simply not true.\"\nKennedy is a long-time vaccine skeptic who has been making sweeping changes to reshape vaccines, food, and medicine policies as the nation's top public health official.\nAdams also faulted Kennedy's response to the Aug. 8 shooting at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention headquarters in Atlanta that claimed the life of a police officer, saying his rhetoric about vaccines was \"fanning the flames that lead to situations like we saw at the CDC.\"\nAuthorities identified Georgia resident Patrick Joseph White, 30, as the shooter. White's neighbor, Nancy Hoalst, told the New York Times that White believed vaccines had hurt him.\n\"We have to understand people are listening,\" Adams said of Kennedy's rhetoric. \"And when you call the CDC a cesspool... when you make claims that have been proven false time and time again about safety and efficacy of vaccines, that can cause unintended consequences.\"\nThe Department of Health and Human Services didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Adams' remarks. Kennedy said in an email to HHS staff Aug. 9 that the shooting \"is a reminder of the very human challenges public servants sometimes face \u2014 even in places dedicated to healing and progress.\"\n\"But it also reinforces the importance of the work you do every day,\" he added.\nContributing: Adrianna Rodriguez and Ken Alltucker, USA TODAY; Reuters"

Time, schedule, location, subject of talks\nPresident Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to meet for a face-to-face summit on Aug. 15, and both leaders are traveling to Anchorage, Alaska, for the sit-down.\nThe two presidents as are expected to discuss Russia's war with Ukraine, which was launched with its full-scale invasion of the country more than three years ago, as Trump angles for a peace deal. It's a high-stakes exercise for Trump as he wades into the conflict and attempts a mediator-type role, as America's staunch support of Ukraine has come under fire from some in his own party and European leaders insist Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy be present for future talks.\nHere's what to know about the highly anticipated diplomatic summit.\nWhen and where is the meeting?\nThe pair's meeting is set to start at 11:30 a.m. Alaska time (3:30 p.m. ET) and a joint press conference is expected to follow.\nThe two world leaders will meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. The base hosts about 30,000 service members, their family members and civilian employees, and is approximately 700 miles from the border with Russia.\nTrump is scheduled to leave Washington, D.C., early Aug. 15, flying about six to seven hours on Air Force One before landing in Anchorage.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, appearing Aug. 14 on Fox News' Fox and Friends, said Trump's meeting with Putin will be followed by a \"bilateral lunch\" between the two leaders and their respective delegations followed by a news conference.\nPutin will be the first elected Russian leader to visit Alaska for the summit, land that the United States purchased from Moscow for $7.2 million in 1867, according to the National Archives. If everything goes according to plan, this trip will mark Putin's eighth visit to the U.S. during his presidency, a role he has held for more than 20 years across two separate terms since 1999.\nLivestream\nUSA TODAY is scheduled to provide live coverage as Trump meets with Putin in Alaska. You can watch at the embed below or on USA TODAY's YouTube channel.\nWhat might be discussed?\nTrump said there would be \u201cvery severe consequences\u201d if Putin does not agree to end the Ukraine war when they meet and has said his summit with the Russian president would be \"setting the table\" for a possible Putin-Zelenskyy meeting that he might attend as well.\nIn an Aug. 14 interview with conservative talk show host Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio, Trump called the meeting a \"chess game\" and predicted there's a \"25% chance\" the meeting could fail to advance peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.\nTrump has raised the idea of a \"land swap\" between Russia and Ukraine, asserting that both countries would have to cede land to each other to end the war. But Zelenskyy has firmly rejected the idea of ceding any land to Russia. \"Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier,\" Zelenskyy said in a video posted on X on Aug. 9.\nContributing: Francesca Chambers, Lauren Villagran, Tom Vanden Brook, Joey Garrison, USA TODAY; Reuters.\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "DC mayor says Trump takeover shows why US capital should be 51st state\nWashington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is advocating for the city to become the 51st state after President Donald Trump announced the federal government would take control of the local Metropolitan Police Department.\nBowser, who has been the city\u2019s mayor since 2015, made the remarks during an appearance on Charlamagne Tha God\u2019s radio show \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d on Tuesday, Aug. 12.\n\u201cIt\u2019s times like this when America needs to know why your nation\u2019s capital, a place where 700,000 tax-paying Americans live, should be the 51st state,\u201d said Bowser on the radio show.\n\u201c[Trump] wants to send the message to cities that if he can get away with this in Los Angeles, if he can get away with this in DC, he can get away with it in New York, or Baltimore or Chicago, or any other place where millions of people live, work and are doing everything the right way.\u201d\nOn Monday, Aug. 11, Trump announced he\u2019d be invoking Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to take control of the police department. The 1973 law grants Washington, DC residents limited authority to govern themselves.\nUnder the law, the president can take control of local police for two days, but any additional time would require congressional notice or an amendment to the existing law. After 30 days, Trump would need congressional approval to retain control of DC police.\nTrump has touted the idea of taking over the police force since 2020, when the Black Lives Matter protests were taking hold of the city, and has since voiced his criticisms of Washington, DC leadership.\nHis recent attempt to crack down on violent crime came after a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee was assaulted during an attempted carjacking on Aug. 3.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d said Trump during a news briefing at the White House on Aug. 11. \u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people.\u201d\nThe president also said he\u2019d be deploying National Guard troops into the city as part of the effort.\nBowser refuted the characterization that violent crime in the city has gotten out of control and disagreed with the president\u2019s actions. It\u2019s the first time a president has taken control of local police.\nAccording to data from the Metropolitan Police Department, violent crime in DC has fallen by 26% compared to the same period last year.\n\u201cThe numbers just don\u2019t justify the action,\u201d said Bowser. She said it\u2019s \u201cnot a good idea\u201d for local police, who have gained the trust of city residents, to be used in a way that makes communities fearful.\nBowser said it appears the president is targeting urban areas where he is less popular, including DC.\nTrump, she said, is \u201cvery aware\u201d of the number of DC residents who voted for him in the 2024 election and has, in turn, taken an aggressive stance. About 6% of city residents voted for the president in the 2024 election.\nThe president has named other liberal-leaning cities, like Chicago and Los Angeles, as places where he might send federal troops next.\nCharlamagne Tha God asked Bowser if she believes Trump\u2019s actions could be a \u201ctrial run for a police state.\u201d\nWhile she didn\u2019t directly respond to the question, she said: \u201cIt is a step in fascism when the federal government can bigfoot sovereign states.\n\u201cRight now... he\u2019s trying to make it normal where citizens say the federal government should overtake local policing and try to make that a normal thing, so if he tries it in other places, people will be desensitized to it.\u201d\nShe continued: \u201cWe can\u2019t be desensitized to it because it\u2019s not normal.\u201d\nMichelle Del Rey is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

The agency's website explained that its role is \"to assure that color additives are safely and appropriately used,\" but says it can also amend its regulations as needed, such as revoking the approved use of some dyes.\nFood activists and watchdog groups have commended the move, saying it's a step in the right direction.\nHere's what to know about the dyes the FDA aims to remove from American food.\nIs the U.S. banning artificial food dyes?\nThe FDA announced on April 22 that it will \"phase out all petroleum-based synthetic dyes from the nation\u2019s food supply\" by the end of 2026.\nNo formal agreement or legislation was passed officially banning the substances. Instead, HHS and the FDA have a \"mutual understanding\" with the food industry that the dyes will be progressively removed, according to Kennedy.\nDuring an April 22 press conference, FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency intends to revoke the approval of some dyes for use and work with industry leaders to substitute petrochemical dyes with \"natural\" ones. A press statement released by the FDA also said it plans to establish a \"national standard and timeline for the transition from petrochemical-based dyes to natural alternatives.\"\nWhat health & wellness means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's Keeping It Together newsletter.\nA statement from the watchdog group Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) called the agreement's voluntary nature \"disappointing.\"\n\"Because using synthetic food dyes has always been voluntary, there is no incentive from today's announcement for manufacturers to switch to natural food colors,\" it read.\nThe FDA will authorize four new natural color additives and expedite the approval of more, according to its statement. The agency will also partner with the National Institutes of Health to research the effect food additives have on children's health and development.\nStudies have been done on the impacts of commonly used synthetic food dyes, some of which have found links to conditions like cancer, ADHD and organ damage. However, some experts believe more definitive research is necessary.\nAs a result, different countries have implemented different rules over time as the scientific community learns more about the potential correlation between food additives and health.\nWhat 8 food dyes will be phased out?\n- Red Dye 40 (Allura Red or FD&C Red No. 40): A dark red dye commonly used in candy, cereals, sports drinks, frosting, condiments, gelatin, jams and more.\n- Yellow Dye 5 (Tartrazine or FD&C Yellow No. 5): A lemon-yellow dye often found in candy, cereal, soft drinks, popcorn, yogurt, juices, spices and more.\n- Yellow Dye 6 (Sunset Yellow or FD&C Yellow No. 6): An orange-yellow dye used in candy, sauces, baked goods, preserved fruit, cheese, soups, cereals and more.\n- Blue Dye 1 (Brilliant Blue FCF or FD&C Blue No. 1): A greenish-blue dye used in ice cream, canned peas, soups, popsicles, icing, confections, dairy products and more.\n- Blue Dye 2 (Indigo Carmine, FD&C Blue No. 2 or Indigotine): A royal blue dye commonly found in candy, ice cream, cereal, snacks, sausages, maraschino cherries and more.\n- Green Dye 3 (Fast Green FCF or FD&C Green No. 3): A forest green dye often found in canned vegetables, cereal, candy, ice cream, salad dressing, soft drinks and more.\nThe FDA will also move to eliminate the use of:\n- Citrus Red 2 (C.I. Solvent Red 80): A dye used only to color the skin of oranges in the U.S., specifically Florida oranges. It is used to make the skins a more vibrant color but is not allowed on the inner edible fruit.\n- Orange B (C.I. Acid Orange 137): Is also a dye used for one purpose: hot dog and sausage casings. The dye itself is also no longer made in the U.S., limiting its use even further.\nWhat other food dyes are banned in the U.S.?\nSome dyes that have been banned in the U.S. are still used in other countries like Canada and those in the European Union, while some still used in the U.S. are banned in others.\nSome food dyes already banned from the U.S. include:\n- Red No. 3: A dye that was already in the process of being phased out under a Biden-era order mandate with a deadline of Jan. 15, 2027. The Trump administration has since asked that this deadline be moved up.\n- Reds 1, 2, 4 and 32: Banned in 1961, 1976 and 1956, for potential (but disputed) links to cancer and organ damage.\n- Yellows 1, 2, 3 and 4: Banned in 1959 after they were found to be potentially linked to lesions and heart damage.\n- Violet 1: Banned in 1973 for being potentially linked to cancer.\n- Orange 1 and 2: Banned in 1956 and 1960 for being potentially linked to organ damage.\n- Green 1 and 2: Both banned in 1965 for being potentially linked to cancer.\n- Sudan 1 and Butter Yellow: Banned in 1919 after they were found to be toxic and potentially carcinogenic.\nSome legislators have already moved to rid their state of food dyes, such as Gov. Gavin Newsom, who signed a bill in 2024 prohibiting the use of Red 3, Blue 1, Blue 2, Green 3, Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 in California.\nWhy are color additives used in foods?\nThe most popular color additives are Red 40, Yellow 5 and Yellow 6, making up 90% of all the food dye used in the U.S., according to Healthline. Artificial food dye consumption has also increased by 500% in the last 50 years, it said.\nAccording to the FDA, dyes are common in processed foods and are used to:\n- Offset color loss due to exposure to light, air, temperature extremes, moisture and storage conditions.\n- Correct natural variations in color.\n- Enhance colors that occur naturally.\n- Provide color to colorless and \"fun\" foods.\nBecause natural dyes are less shelf-stable than artificial ones, some food products may look different after the proposed switch. Naturally derived coloring is more susceptible to fading and degradation when exposed to elements like heat, light and air, so while foods may have the same general color profile, they may appear less vibrant.\nNatural dyes are also generally more expensive to make and use, so companies changing their formulas to adhere to the FDA's requests may have to make adjustments to preserve their bottom line.\nContributing: Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy, USA TODAY; Cheryl McCloud, USA TODAY Network"

      "text": "Leading doctors sue RFK Jr. over COVID-19 vaccines. Here's why.\nAmerica\u2019s top medical organizations are suing Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. over the agency\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for children and pregnant people.\nOn May 27, Kennedy said the shot would no longer be included in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s recommended immunization schedule for healthy children and pregnant women, a move that broke with previous expert guidance and bypassed the normal scientific review process.\nThe health secretary also fired all 17 original members of a federal vaccine panel June 9 and quickly appointed eight new members, including some vaccine skeptics. The panel met for the first time on June 25 but did not make COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for the fall.\nThe plaintiffs, which include the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine, claim Kennedy\u2019s recent decisions were designed to mislead, confuse and desensitize the public to anti-vaccine and anti-science rhetoric. In the July 7 lawsuit filed in Massachusetts, they ask the judge to halt changes made to the COVID-19 vaccine policy. The lawsuit doesn't address Kennedy's overhaul of the vaccine committee.\n\u201cThis wasn\u2019t just sidelining science,\u201d said AAP President Dr. Susan Kressly. \u201cIt\u2019s an attack on the very foundation of how we protect families and children\u2019s health. And the consequences could be dangerous.\u201d\nLead counsel for the plaintiffs Richard Hughes, a partner at law firm Epstein Becker Green, said he hopes to expedite the case, with a hearing in the next few weeks and a permanent order in the case entered by September.\nThe American College of Physicians, American Public Health Association, Infectious Diseases Society of America, Massachusetts Public Health Alliance and an anonymous pregnant physician were also listed as plaintiffs.\nHHS' changes to the COVID vaccine recommendations have led pregnant women and parents to question the value of other recommended vaccines, representatives of the medical societies said. They urge parents and patients to follow medical advice published on their websites.\n\u201cWe will not stand by while a single federal official unilaterally and effectively strips Americans of their choice to vaccinate with actions that thoroughly disregard overwhelming scientific evidence and decades of established federal processes,\u201d said IDSA President Dr. Tina Tan. \u201cAs a community of clinicians, public health officials and scientists, our focus remains the protection of patients and public health.\u201d\nUSA TODAY reached out to HHS for comment.\nContributing: Reuters.\nAdrianna Rodriguez can be reached at adrodriguez@usatoday.com."

      "text": "What vitamin comes from the sun? Here's what it does and how your body benefits from sunlight.\nIt\u2019s common knowledge that plants require sunlight for photosynthesis, a biological process which is essential to their growth \u2014 but did you know the sun also provides significant health benefits to humans?\nDespite numerous risks associated with prolonged exposure to the sun\u2019s powerful ultraviolet rays (sunburn, skin damage, skin cancer and more, according to the Mayo Clinic), the sun is actually vital to a number of the human body\u2019s functions.\nHere\u2019s how the sun helps you produce one of the 13 essential vitamins, as well as several other important benefits it provides.\nWhat vitamin comes from the sun?\nSunlight helps your body produce vitamin D. While this essential vitamin doesn\u2019t come directly from sunlight, it does help transform chemicals already in your skin, according to Harvard Health Publishing.\nThe energy your body receives from the sun converts chemicals in your skin to vitamin D3, which is then hydroxylated in your liver and kidneys to become active vitamin D, according to the National Institutes of Health\u2019s Office of Dietary Supplements.\nOnce it is adequately prepared by your body, vitamin D helps your gut absorb calcium, which increases bone health and can prevent muscle cramps and spasms, according to the NIH. Vitamin D also reduces inflammation, supports the immune system and helps with glucose metabolism.\nWhat is the healthiest fish to eat? And what fish should I avoid?\nHow to keep your cholesterol down: Best and worst foods to maintain cholesterol levels\nVitamin D deficiency\nVitamin D deficiency can cause problems for your body and make you more susceptible to certain diseases. In children, a lack of vitamin D can cause rickets, a now-rare bone disease, according to Harvard Health Publishing, and adults without sufficient vitamin D can face bone diseases such as osteomalacia or osteoporosis.\nNonwhite populations are especially at risk for vitamin D deficiency, as pigmentation can drastically reduce vitamin D production in the skin.\nAlthough doctors disagree about the efficacy of vitamin D supplements for the average person, those who need more vitamin D can add fatty fish, liver and fortified foods to their diets, according to Harvard\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Fish that are a good source of vitamin D include salmon, swordfish, tuna and sardines. You can also look for orange juice, milk and cereals fortified with vitamin D at your grocery store.\nThe Mayo Clinic suggests vitamin D supplements for those who cannot get enough vitamin D from the sun or their diet.\nBut taking tons of vitamin D supplements won\u2019t make you healthier if you are already getting enough vitamin D from your diet and the sun. If your body has too much vitamin D, your blood calcium levels could increase, causing nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dehydration, confusion and more, according to Healthline.\nOther health benefits of sunshine\nVitamin D isn\u2019t the only health benefit you get from the sun. Numerous other benefits to sun exposure have been reported.\nFor example, sunlight triggers your body to produce serotonin, which can improve your mood, emotions, appetite and digestion, according to PBS North Carolina.\nSerotonin is also necessary to produce melatonin, according to PBS North Carolina, which means spending time in the sun during the day can help you fall asleep easier at night.\nThe same melatonin that helps you fall asleep can also reduce your stress levels, according to SelectHealth.\nSunlight might even help you keep excess weight off. A study published in the Public Library of Science in 2014 also links weight loss with morning sunlight exposure.\nWhat does vitamin D do? And information on who needs supplements.\nWhat is sugar alcohol? The reduced-calorie sweetener you might not recognize.\nJust curious?: We're here to answer your everyday questions."

      "text": "RFK Jr. works out in jeans. We tried it. It didn't go well.\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr. seems to really love wearing jeans. Who doesn't, really? Whether they're skinny or baggy, dark- or light-wash, denim jeans are a fashion staple.\nBut RFK Jr. seems to also love wearing jeans to ... exercise? The Health and Human Services Secretary has been spotted donning jeans at the gym. Most recently, on a hike in blistering heat. Many on social media were quick to question the behavior: \"It\u2019s really weird to me that this guy seems to always be exercising in jeans.\" Others were less skeptical: \"RFK Jr is single-handedly showing the nation that 'activewear' is a myth. You can train, hike, run, cycle in normal clothing.\"\nOK, let's play along here. Some experts tout the benefits of hot yoga. Many people lead active lifestyles outdoors in jeans every day. Maybe working out in jeans is no different? Here at USA TODAY, we couldn't help but wonder: Would we be happy breaking a denim-soaked sweat?\nSo we tried it out ourselves, to mixed results.\nWearing jeans on a run\nThe second I stepped outside in my light-wash, baby blue jeans to go for a run on a July morning in Washington, D.C., I regretted the choice. The humidity seeped into my pores, and beads of sweat pooled all across my body. Including my denim-covered legs.\nI typically run in shorts, a running tank top and a sweatband. That day, I channeled RFK Jr. and ran like the wind, or something like that. The breezy rush of air that usually whispers at my legs never materialized. The denim laced heat onto them instead. I wanted to shout at each runner and dog-walker I ran by: \"This is for work! I promise! I don't like this!\"\nOne mile passed, then two and then a third. I took my usual route, though nothing about the run felt particularly usual. I felt constricted. Contained. Confounded. How could anyone enjoy this?\nBut then it clicked. Just because this didn't work for me didn't mean it couldn't work for others. Maybe some are self-conscious about their legs, and find jeans a comfortable solution for their exercise routines over athleisure. Maybe some like the heat the denim brings. Maybe others just like breaking the status quo.\nWill I be running in jeans again? No. But I'm glad I tried it \u2013 even if a friend saw me and won't let me live it down. \u2013\u2013 David Oliver, Deputy Wellness Editor\nWearing jeans during Solidcore\nEven in sweat-wicking fabric, Solidcore is no walk in the park. The pilates-inspired reformer workout has a cult following among New York City 20-somethings for packing a core and oblique focused challenge into 50 EDM-filled minutes.\nEach station on the studio floor is marked with a motivational phrase. Mine read \u201cMake someday today.\u201d I don\u2019t think they meant the \u201csomeday\u201d you attend a workout class in jeans, I thought as I lunged and crunched to the chorus of \u201cHarlem Shake.\u201d\nEven with the lights dimmed, I couldn\u2019t help but feel self-conscious in a sea of matching Alo yoga sets and Lululemon leggings. When I dropped into the first Bulgarian split squat of class, flashbacks of the time I split my pants during a high school PE class raced through my mind.\nBut truth be told, it wasn\u2019t as bad as I expected. I got a few confused looks, but once I realized everyone in the room was more concerned with surviving the plank section than with my choice of attire, the class moved on as normal, albeit with more sweat.\nIf you forget your workout clothes, jeans can work in a pinch. (It likely helps if they\u2019re 94% cotton and bootcut like mine were). Still, I wouldn\u2019t test the limits by trying it out in a more sweat-inducing class like SoulCycle or CorePower. \u2013\u2013 Rachel Hale, Youth Mental Health Reporting Fellow\nWearing jeans during a gym session\nMy dark-wash denims were made to move \u2013 well, really more to suck it up and keep it tight. They pack \"tighter tummy technology,\" with 77% cotton, 21% polyester and the hardworking 2% Spandex.\nSo when I set my position to bang out 15 squats at the start of my workout, I expected them to feel like a second skin. And, to a degree, they did. Not too long into my second set, it was like a skin I was desperate to shed \u2013 now, now, NOW!\nWhile I didn't tap out of my workout, I did have to abandon my jeans. It was not my favorite experience knowing exactly where sweat was gathering and soaking into my pants that grew just a little heavier. That might seem like a perk in a workout, but I assure you it was not. That said, if I did feel like spontaneously smacking the battle ropes in the backyard, being in jeans wouldn't deter me. \u2013\u2013 Michelle Maltais, Executive Editor for Lifestyles & Financial Wellbeing\nThe bottom line?\nWe are glad we tried RFK Jr.'s jeans workout (hey, it makes for a good conversation starter) but none of us can say we'd readily repeat it. Maybe the Make America Health Again guru knows something we don't. We can't be sure \u2013 he didn't return our request for comment on the subject. Feel free to send us your \"hot\" takes on working out in jeans by emailing David at doliver@usatoday.com. And for anyone wanting to jump on the trend, please keep in mind jeans may not be safe to work out in, depending on the activity and your individual health needs; please consult a health care provider if you have any concerns about it and remember to follow the rules of your gym. Some institutions don't allow working out in jeans (and we now understand why)."
