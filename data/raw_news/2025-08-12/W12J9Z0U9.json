  "title": "NJ parents outraged over new law that could put them in prison for their kid\u2019s bad behavior: \u2018Snake eating its tail\u2019",
  "description": "The new law in Gloucester Township, passed in late July, is called \u201cMinors and Parent Responsibility.\u201d",
  "content": "Moms and dads in a New Jersey suburb can be tossed in prison and fined for their badly behaving children \u2014 under a bonkers new ordinance that some say strips parents of their rights and potentially sets a \u201cdangerous precedent.\u201d\n\nThe new law in Gloucester Township, passed in late July, is called \u201cMinors and Parent Responsibility\u201d and stipulates that parents will be held \u201caccountable for public disturbances caused by\u201d their child, and could go to jail for three months if their kids are found guilty of multiple offenses.\n\n\u201cParents are feeling pretty outraged,\u201d Alex Bougher, chair of the Bergen County chapter of parents\u2019 rights group Moms for Liberty, told The Post Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019re getting attacked from every angle here.\u201d\n\nThe ordinance is the result of a massive brawl that broke out last year among a throng of 500 minors at the Gloucester Township Day and Drone Show, according to NJ.com. Eleven people \u2014 including nine teens \u2014 were arrested. Three officers were also injured.\n\nThe juvenile offenses that fall under the new law are sweeping \u2014 there are 28 in total \u2014 with \u201cbeing a disorderly person,\u201d \u201cimmorality,\u201d \u201cdestruction of playground equipment\u201d and \u201cloitering\u201d joining the likes of assault, mugging, drunkenness and drug dealing.\n\n\u201cIf a child is repeatedly found guilty in juvenile court, their caretaker could face up to 90 days in prison and/or a fine of up to $2,000,\u201d Gloucester Township Police said in a recent release clarifying the law.\n\nPolice Chief David Harkins told NJ.com that the law consisted of \u201cgeneral legal language\u201d and that parents would receive a warning first for the kids\u2019 bad behavior.\n\n\u201cOur ordinance was actually sampled from other towns,\u201d Harkins said, referring to the Jersey Shore\u2019s Wildwood, which has also seen a spate of crazy teen behavior. \u201cWe\u2019re not necessarily the first, but we\u2019re probably the first bigger town to adopt it.\u201d\n\nGloucester Township is located just eight miles from Philadelphia and has a population of nearly 66,900.\n\nThe drastic move has been supported by Mayor David Mayer.\n\n\u201cWe have to hold parents responsible,\u201d he told the Courier Post.\n\nBougher, a mother of three herself, said many parents she\u2019s spoken with feel the law is an overstep \u2014 and an alarming move toward stripping away parents\u2019 right to make choices for their own children.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous precedent. Like, this should not be. This should not be,\u201d she said, adding that the new law was also a \u201ccontradiction\u201d of policies already in place in the state.\n\nBougher cited New Jersey public schools\u2019 Policy 5756, a recent guidance which advises teachers not to tell parents if their kids begin identifying as a different gender in the classroom \u2014 and to create a \u201cconfidential file\u201d of school records to keep hidden from parents.\n\nPolicy 5756 is intended to protect transgender students who might be endangered by parents who don\u2019t agree with their identity choice, but Bougher and others see it as an infringement on parents\u2019 freedoms to raise their kids \u2014 and a policy that also makes the \u201cMinors and Parent Responsibility\u201d illogical.\n\n\u201cParents are basically being told that they don\u2019t have rights as parents to know what\u2019s going on with their children,\u201d she said, \u201cbut then on the other side, it\u2019s \u2018How could you not know what was going on with your children? How come you didn\u2019t step in?'\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to block the parents, how can you blame the parents?\u201d she added.\n\nNicole Stouffer, one of the organizers of parents\u2019 rights group the New Jersey Project, says the new ordinance on its face doesn\u2019t make sense.\n\n\u201cA 90-day jail sentence is extreme \u2014 for parents who maybe have other kids, maybe they have a problem kid,\u201d she said. \u201cNow this person can\u2019t pay their bills and their mortgage or take care of their children? And they\u2019re going to go to jail because they have one child that\u2019s out of control?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a snake eating its tail \u2014 nothing is going to get fixed,\u201d Stouffer added.\n\nStouffer thinks the problem lies in post-pandemic movements to roll back policing \u2014 and that cops need to be allowed to intervene and diffuse kids before situations get out of hand.\n\n\u201cWe have eliminated powers for the police to maybe do their job,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just an extreme response to something that\u2019s not being taken care of by the state.\u201d",

      "text": "A South Jersey town plans to hold parents or guardians criminally liable for children who break the law.\nGloucester Township enacted a new ordinance on July 28 that imposes maximum fines of $2,000, plus the possibility of up to 90 days in jail, for adults whose children continuously commit unruly acts.\nThe ordinance includes 28 offenses that could make caretakers liable. They range from felonies, loitering, breaking curfew and chronic truancy to immorality, habitual vagrancy and knowingly associating with immoral people.\nPolice Chief David Harkins said the new law covers disorderly conduct overall, calling it \u201cgeneral legal language. Parents will first be warned instead being assessed fines, he said.\n\u201cOur ordinance was actually sampled from other towns,\u201d Harkins said. \u201cWe\u2019re not necessarily the first, but we\u2019re probably the first bigger town to adopt it.\u201d\nThe ordinance comes as the township has grappled with a trend of teens and juveniles instigating fights, damaging property and committing other offenses.\nLast year, the annual Gloucester Township Day, a carnival-like event that draws families to Veterans Park, was marred by more than 500 minors who gathered around the time of the inaugural drone show portion of the event. Violence flared when the crowd instigated a large brawl, which eventually drifted into a nearby shopping plaza. Nine teens were among 11 arrested, and three police officers trying to curtail the violence were injured.\nThe event was postponed this year after posts to social media suggested similar behavior was being planned again. Township officials have examined the event\u2019s future in light of the violence.\nDisruptive crowds of juveniles have appeared in public places across the state, including at the Jersey Shore. Wildwood, one of the towns that contended with unruly children last year, instituted a policy similar to Gloucester Township\u2019s ordinance this summer, making parents prone to fines of up to $1,000 for their child\u2019s misbehavior.\nGov. Phil Murphy went as far as to sign a new law to punish people suspected of instigating a public brawl after the bipartisan bill cleared the statehouse earlier this year.\nStories by Eric Conklin\nThank you for relying on us to provide the local news you can trust.

      "text": "NYC designer Martha Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s tragic death on Montauk boat eyed as suspected accidental drug overdose: sources\nThe mysterious death of Manhattan swimwear designer Martha Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra at the upscale Montauk Yacht Club is being eyed as a possible accidental overdose, sources said Tuesday.\nThe 33-year-old Irish beauty was found unconscious at the ritzy club at around midnight on Aug. 5 aboard a boat named \u201cRipple\u201d \u2013 one of at least two Grateful Dead-themed crafts owned by insurance mogul Christopher Durnan, sources tell The Post.\nAn autopsy is pending to determine Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s official cause of death \u2013 although sources said it was a suspected drug overdose.\nQuestions have been swirling since the tragic night when Nolan-O\u2019Slatarra was discovered on the \u201cRipple,\u201d which was docked at the Yacht Club. Members reported hearing screams and called 911, before trying to resuscitate the young designer \u2013 who was later pronounced dead.\nThe good Samaritans told The Post they were woken by a naked man throwing sunscreen at their boat and saw him running down the dock screaming, \u201cDo something!\u201d\nDurnan, 60, a familiar figure at the club, owns the Durnan Group in Rockville Center, which manages the \u201clargest, most successful Workers Compensation Safety Group for Real Estate\u201d on the company\u2019s website.\nHe owns \u201cRipple\u201d and a second boat, \u201cHell in a Bucket,\u201d which was docked alongside and is also a shout-out to the Grateful Dead, several club members confirmed.\nDurnan did not return several requests for comment.\nSuffolk County cops have not filed charges or identified any suspects in the case. But authorities have also not publicly ruled out foul play, despite revealing that there was no evidence of violence to the body.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s death is also being investigated by Suffolk County\u2019s East End Drug Task Force, according to a Tuesday report by Newsday.\n\u201cUntil you start ruling stuff out, everything is in play,\u201d a source familiar with the investigation told the outlet.\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra, a native of the tiny Irish town of Carlow, migrated to the US, where she started as a bottle service girl in SoHo before co-founding East x East, a swimwear label.\n\u201cI always knew I wanted to be successful, that I was money-driven, business-driven, and that fashion is a tough industry and it would be a slow road,\u201d she told the Irish Independent last year.\nHer partner in the East x East, Dylan Grace, posted a moving tribute on Instagram following her death.\n\u201cWe dreamed big together, laughed harder than anyone else could understand and built so much from nothing,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m truly blessed and grateful to have had you in my life.\u201d\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra summered in the Hamptons, where she hosted successful pop-up shows and fashion exhibits for wealthy clientele in Montauk and the surrounding area.\nShe had finalized her divorce to ex-Sam Ryan just months before her death, according to court records reviewed by The Post.\n\u201cI represented Mr. Ryan in a matrimonial proceeding. The final papers had been submitted to the court, and before the Judgment of Divorce was issued, I became aware of Ms. Nolan-O\u2019slatarra\u2019s passing and promptly notified the court,\u201d his attorney, David Centeno, said in a statement. \u201cOut of respect for the privacy of those involved and my ethical restraints, I cannot discuss whether there was a prenuptial agreement, mediation, or other private arrangements.\u201d\nNolan-O\u2019Slatarra\u2019s heartbroken mother, Elma Nolan, told the Irish Independent on Aug. 7 that her daughter was planning a trip home to Carlow before her death.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to my daughter,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cI feel numb and in shock.\u201d\n\u2014 Additional reporting by Brandon Cruz, Joe Marino and Peter Senzamici"

The inmates are taking turns doing it. It\u2019s relentless,\u201d McDonough continued. \u201cHe\u2019s extremely annoyed and frustrated. He\u2019s complaining to the authorities that he can\u2019t sleep because of them.\u201d\nKohberger is being housed in the prison\u2019s restricted unit in the facility\u2019s J block, away from the general prison population.\nHe\u2019s kept in a cell by himself at all times, except for one-hour a day when he\u2019s let into \u201cthe cage\u201d outside for recreation, while he wears restraints. And he\u2019s only allotted one shower every other day.\nThe high-profile nature of Kohberger\u2019s case and the fact he copped to such abhorrent crimes makes him a target for other inmates who would want to harm him \u201cjust to make a name for themselves,\u201d McDonough explained.\nAnd since the other inmates don\u2019t pose a physical threat to Kohberger while he\u2019s in solitary, prison staff aren\u2019t likely to intervene, the former cop said.\nStill, as attention moves away from Kohberger over time, prison staff may eventually be willing to move him back to the general population, McDonough explained.\nAt the jail that Kohberger was previously kept in while he awaited trial, other defendants said he did unusual things like spending hours on the phone with his mom MaryAnn, washing his hands compulsively, taking showers upwards of an hour long and staying awake at night only to nap during the day.\nOnce, he confronted another defendant who yelled \u201cyou suck\u201d at a sports player on the TV because he thought the man was insulting Kohberger and his mom as they spoke on the phone.\nLast month, Kohberger took a surprise plea deal just weeks before his highly anticipated trial was set to kick off. The deal saw him skirt the possibility of facing the death penalty, enraging some of the families of his victims and leaving loved ones with no explanation for why he committed the heinous murders.\nHe admitted to killing Xana Kernodle, Kaylee Goncalves, Madison Mogen, and Ethan Chapin on Nov. 13, 2022 in their off-campus house in Moscow."

One person was charged with both disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, Bryan told the outlet.\nSome participating youths shared posts on TikTok and Instagram leading up to the swarm, telling people to show up at the mall at 7 p.m.\nIt\u2019s unclear if any of the posts advertised a fight or if it was intended for some other kind of event, but Bryan confirmed that TikTok played a role in the huge crowd.\nOne TikTok shared last Tuesday that pitched a \u201cMenlo Mall Linkup??\u201d received over 9,000 likes and 156,000 views. The user posted about the meetup again on Thursday.\nVideos capturing the chaotic scene quickly went viral on TikTok overnight as teens wreaked havoc, screaming and running from officers while they were making arrests.\nImpromptu fights spurred by social media meetups have resulted in slews of minors being arrested in the last year.\nIn October, \u201cmass chaos\u201d broke out at the Kings Dominion theme park just outside Richmond, Va., following a social media callout. No one was arrested after 14 deputies responded.\nIn November, an armed teenage gangbanger lost hold of his gun during a fight at a mall on Long Island. A bystander kicked the weapon farther away from the teen in a video released in early May.\nThe Post reached out to the Edison Police Department for comment."

      "text": "In Gloucester Township, parents may be fined or jailed if kids commit crimes under new law\n- Gloucester Township passed an ordinance holding parents accountable for their child's offenses, including felonies and more minor infractions such as loitering and truancy.\n- The ordinance is a response to disruptive youth behavior at public events, including a 2024 incident involving 500 unsupervised youths.\n- Penalties for repeated offenses can include fines of up to $2,000 and 90 days in jail for guardians.\nA new ordinance in Gloucester Township could bring fines or jail time to parents who fail to prevent their child from breaking the law, according to authorities.\n\"We have to hold parents responsible,\" said Mayor David Mayer, tracing the measure to an unruly mob of young people who disrupted a community event in June of last year.\nThere are 28 offenses that could make guardians liable, a Gloucester Township police statement noted. They range from \"felonies to minor infractions like loitering, breaking curfew, or chronic truancy.\"\n\"The ordinance holds parents, legal guardians, or anyone responsible for a minor accountable for public disturbances caused by the child,\" police said in the statement.\nIn the summer of 2024 incident, approximately 500 unsupervised youths arrived unexpectedly near the end of Gloucester Township Day, a family-oriented summer tradition. Fighting broke out at approximately 8:40 p.m., and more than 100 police officers had trouble restoring order for almost two hours.\nSimilar incidents have marred public events across South Jersey in recent months, including a church fair in Bellmawr.\nA pop-up party June 30 drew hundreds of people to Rowan Boulevard in Glassboro. One man was charged with attempted murder and other offenses after he allegedly shot a man in the entertainment area near Rowan University's campus.\nOfficials canceled this year's Gloucester Township Day after learning that youths were organizing online to disrupt the scholarship fundraiser. At the same time, local officials and state legislators outlined steps intended to tamp down youth violence, including the newly enacted ordinance.\nUnder another measure enacted in the past year, Mayer noted, caretakers can be held accountable for youths' curfew violations.\nIn addition, a new state law has created the crime of inciting a public brawl. It also upgraded the penalty for disorderly conduct under some circumstances.\nGov. Phil Murphy signed the bill in June, just weeks after a Memorial Day weekend marred by fights and stabbings in Seaside Heights, Ocean County. The measure's sponsors included legislators representing Gloucester Township.\nFirst-time violators of Gloucester Township's new ordinance would receive a warning, Mayer said.\nBut if a youth is repeatedly found guilty in juvenile court, a caretaker could face up to 90 days in prison and/or a fine of up to $2.000.\nTownship council members approved the measure at their meeting July 28. The ordinance takes effect immediately, police said.\nJim Walsh is a senior reporter with the Courier-Post, Burlington County Times and The Daily Journal. Email: Jwalsh@cpsj.com."

      "text": "Eleven people, including nine teenagers, were arrested at a community drone light show in South Jersey Saturday after multiple fights were instigated by a crowd that swelled to more than 500 kids and young adults, according to police.\nThree police officers were also injured in the chaotic crowd gathered at the Veterans Memorial Park in Gloucester Township Saturday night, local police said Sunday.\nOne of the officers was struck by a bicycle, leading to a 33-year-old man from Camden being arrested and charged with aggravated assault on a police officer. The same man was also charged with attempted escape for slipping out of handcuffs while being transported to jail, police said.\nAnother man, 18, was arrested for disorderly conduct.\nThe officers involved with the bike collision declined medical treatment. The other injured officers, one from Gloucester Township and the other from Clementon, sustained minor injuries while mediating multiple fights, police said.\nThe show was part of Gloucester Township Day, an annual event the municipality holds with rides, games and food vendors. It was scheduled to begin at noon and last until 10 p.m., according to Gloucester Township\u2019s website.\n\u201cThe lawless of groups of unsupervised juveniles and young people acting with total disregard for others ruined a great family-oriented event, which has taken place to raise funds for the Gloucester Township Scholarship Committee for over 40 years,\u2019' Gloucester Township Police Chief David Harkins said in a statement Sunday. \u201cThis type of lawlessness and violent riotous behavior will not be tolerated, and will not define the great community of Gloucester Township.\u201d\nThe nine teenagers arrested ranged from 13 to 17, police said. Eight of the nine were from towns in Camden County. Seven were boys and two were girls. All were charged with disorderly conduct and released to their guardian.\nFamilies congregated in the park off Chews Landing Road were awaiting the drone show to begin when an influx of kids and young adults began to be dropped off at the event, police said. The crowd is believed to have swelled to more than 500 people.\nFighting between large groups began around 8:40 p.m., police said. They ran \u201crecklessly\u201d through the crowd while officers fought to maintain order, describing their actions as \u201chostile and disorderly,\u2019' according to police. Two people were arrested for disorderly conduct.\nAdditional officers from across Camden County were called to the scene to tame the crowd, police said.\nThe light show, police said, began early because of the dangerous situation, leading to officers dispersing the crowd from the park\u2019s field once it ended. Large groups moved to a shopping plaza nearby, continuing to fight and causing more police to be sent to the area.\nFighting continued for two hours, ending at around 11 p.m., when police deemed the situation under control. Two minors were injured because of the melees but were released into their guardian\u2019s custody.\nMany of those inciting the fights were dressed in black clothing and covered their face with medical masks and sweatshirts, police said.\nThe scenario was similar to that of Memorial Day weekend in Ocean City in Cape May County, where teenagers sparked a brawl on the town\u2019s boardwalk, resulting in a 15-year-old being stabbed. Similar disarray happened in Wildwood and Seaside Heights.\nThe New Jersey State PBA condemned the actions of the teenagers in a statement on X on Sunday.\n\u201cOut of control juveniles with no accountability is not limited to the Jersey shore,\u2019' the PBA statement said. \u201cOfficers were injured, and the event was canceled yesterday. Things must change.\u2019'\nSixty-eight Gloucester Township officers were assigned or responded the event, and at least 30 were considered mutual aid from towns nearby, police said. The fights were being investigated.\nHarkins credited the officers for showing restraint to limit injuries while working to control the violence.\n\u201cI was proud to serve with all of these officers who put their safety on the line to bring this difficult situation under control,\u201d Harkins said. \u201cI am thankful that more injuries were not sustained to officers, the families attending the event, and even those involved in this disorderly conduct.\u201d\nStories by Eric Conklin\nThank you for relying on us to provide the local news you can trust.
