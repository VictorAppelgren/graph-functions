The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed inflation rose by a modest 0.2% in July and 2.7% over the last year. This cooler-than-expected data prompted a significant market rally, with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq all climbing as investors grew more optimistic. The prevailing view is that easing inflation gives the central bank room to lower interest rates. Lower rates typically reduce borrowing costs for businesses and make stocks more attractive relative to bonds, contributing to widespread gains across sectors like healthcare.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks.\n\nAmong others, the following stocks were impacted:\n\u2022 Specialized Medical & Nursing Services company AMN Healthcare Services (NYSE:AMN) jumped 9.2%.

In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 1 day ago when the stock dropped 5% on the news that analyst firm BMO Capital lowered its price target on the stock to $22.00 from $27.00. The price target reduction from BMO Capital followed AMN's second-quarter earnings report, where the company issued third-quarter revenue guidance below consensus expectations. AMN projects its Q3 revenue to fall between 9% and 11% compared to the prior year. Management attributed the weaker outlook to an \u201cuncertain healthcare policy environment\u201d and macroeconomic volatility, which has caused clients to slow down decision-making. BMO Capital noted that healthcare staffing volumes have been negatively impacted, particularly at Academic Medical Centers that depend on federal funding. While AMN's second-quarter results had surpassed estimates, the soft forward guidance prompted the more cautious analyst rating.",

      "text": "NeoGenomics (NEO)\nNeoGenomics keeps us up at night. Its poor sales growth shows demand is soft and its negative returns on capital suggest it destroyed value.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think NeoGenomics Will Underperform\nOperating a network of CAP-accredited and CLIA-certified laboratories across the United States and United Kingdom, NeoGenomics (NASDAQ:NEO) provides specialized cancer diagnostic testing services, including genetic analysis, molecular testing, and pathology consultation for oncologists and healthcare providers.\n- Push for growth has led to negative returns on capital, signaling value destruction, and its shrinking returns suggest its past profit sources are losing steam\n- Poor expense management has led to adjusted operating margin losses\n- Depletion of cash reserves could lead to a fundraising event that triggers shareholder dilution\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than NeoGenomics\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than NeoGenomics\nNeoGenomics is trading at $5.84 per share, or 24.4x forward P/E. Not only does NeoGenomics trade at a premium to companies in the healthcare space, but this multiple is also high for its fundamentals.\nWe\u2019d rather invest in similarly-priced but higher-quality companies with more reliable earnings growth.\n3. NeoGenomics (NEO) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nOncology (cancer) diagnostics company NeoGenomics (NASDAQ:NEO) missed Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations in Q2 CY2025, but sales rose 10.2% year on year to $181.3 million. The company\u2019s full-year revenue guidance of $723 million at the midpoint came in 2.9% below analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.03 per share was in line with analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nNeoGenomics (NEO) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $181.3 million vs analyst estimates of $182.9 million (10.2% year-on-year growth, 0.9% miss)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.03 vs analyst estimates of $0.02 (in line)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $10.68 million vs analyst estimates of $11.31 million (5.9% margin, 5.6% miss)\n- The company dropped its revenue guidance for the full year to $723 million at the midpoint from $753 million, a 4% decrease\n- Adjusted EPS guidance for the full year is $0.10 at the midpoint, missing analyst estimates by 36.1%\n- EBITDA guidance for the full year is $42.5 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $54.7 million\n- Operating Margin: -26.3%, down from -13.3% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 13.7%, up from 0.5% in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $831.4 million\nCompany Overview\nOperating a network of CAP-accredited and CLIA-certified laboratories across the United States and United Kingdom, NeoGenomics (NASDAQ:NEO) provides specialized cancer diagnostic testing services, including genetic analysis, molecular testing, and pathology consultation for oncologists and healthcare providers.\nNeoGenomics serves as a critical link in cancer care by offering comprehensive diagnostic testing that helps physicians determine the specific characteristics of a patient's cancer. The company's testing portfolio includes cytogenetics (analyzing chromosome structures), fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH), flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and advanced molecular and next-generation sequencing (NGS) tests that identify genetic mutations and other biomarkers in cancer cells.\nThese sophisticated tests enable oncologists to make more precise diagnoses and develop personalized treatment plans. For example, a lung cancer patient might have their tumor sample analyzed by NeoGenomics to identify specific genetic mutations that could make them eligible for targeted therapies rather than traditional chemotherapy.\nThe company operates through two main segments. The Clinical Services segment serves community pathology practices, hospital labs, academic centers, and oncology groups who need specialized cancer testing beyond their in-house capabilities. Many clients use NeoGenomics on a \"tech-only\" basis, where the company performs the technical component of testing while the client's pathologists interpret the results. The Advanced Diagnostics segment partners with pharmaceutical companies to support clinical trials, drug development, and companion diagnostic tests that determine which patients might respond to specific cancer therapies.\nNeoGenomics has expanded its capabilities through strategic acquisitions, including Inivata in 2021, which added liquid biopsy technology that can detect cancer through blood samples rather than tissue biopsies. The company's InVisionFirst-Lung test analyzes blood samples from non-small cell lung cancer patients, while its RaDaR assay can detect minimal residual disease after treatment, helping to monitor for cancer recurrence.\nThe company generates revenue through reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, and direct billing to healthcare providers. For pharmaceutical clients, NeoGenomics typically operates under service contracts for clinical trials and research projects.\n4. Testing & Diagnostics Services\nThe testing and diagnostics services industry plays a crucial role in disease detection, monitoring, and prevention, serving hospitals, clinics, and individual consumers. This sector benefits from stable demand, driven by an aging population, increased prevalence of chronic diseases, and growing awareness of preventive healthcare. Recurring revenue streams come from routine screenings, lab tests, and diagnostic imaging, with reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, and out-of-pocket payments. However, the industry faces challenges such as pricing pressures, regulatory compliance, and the need for continuous investment in new testing technologies. Looking ahead, industry tailwinds include the expansion of personalized medicine, increased adoption of at-home and rapid diagnostic tests, and advancements in AI-driven diagnostics that enhance accuracy and efficiency. However, headwinds such as reimbursement uncertainties, competition from decentralized testing solutions, and regulatory scrutiny over test validity and cost-effectiveness may impact profitability. Adapting to evolving healthcare models and integrating automation will be key for sustaining growth and maintaining operational efficiency.\nNeoGenomics competes with large laboratory companies like Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America, as well as specialized cancer diagnostics firms including Guardant Health (NASDAQ:GH), Natera (NASDAQ:NTRA), Exact Sciences (NASDAQ:EXAS), Caris Life Sciences, Tempus Labs, and Myriad Genetics (NASDAQ:MYGN).\n5. Revenue Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith just $689.2 million in revenue over the past 12 months, NeoGenomics is a small company in an industry where scale matters. This makes it difficult to build trust with customers because healthcare is heavily regulated, complex, and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance can indicate its overall quality. Any business can put up a good quarter or two, but many enduring ones grow for years. Thankfully, NeoGenomics\u2019s 11.2% annualized revenue growth over the last five years was decent. Its growth was slightly above the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. NeoGenomics\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 11.8% over the last two years aligns with its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was stable.\nThis quarter, NeoGenomics\u2019s revenue grew by 10.2% year on year to $181.3 million but fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 14.4% over the next 12 months, an improvement versus the last two years. This projection is healthy and suggests its newer products and services will spur better top-line performance.\n7. Operating Margin\nNeoGenomics\u2019s high expenses have contributed to an average operating margin of negative 19% over the last five years. Unprofitable healthcare companies require extra attention because they could get caught swimming naked when the tide goes out. It\u2019s hard to trust that the business can endure a full cycle.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, NeoGenomics\u2019s operating margin decreased by 11.1 percentage points over the last five years, but it rose by 7 percentage points on a two-year basis. Still, shareholders will want to see NeoGenomics become more profitable in the future.\nThis quarter, NeoGenomics generated a negative 26.3% operating margin. The company's consistent lack of profits raise a flag.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nNeoGenomics\u2019s EPS grew at an unimpressive 1.1% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, lower than its 11.2% annualized revenue growth. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded.\nDiving into the nuances of NeoGenomics\u2019s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, NeoGenomics\u2019s operating margin declined by 11.1 percentage points over the last five years. Its share count also grew by 18.6%, meaning the company not only became less efficient with its operating expenses but also diluted its shareholders.\nIn Q2, NeoGenomics reported EPS at $0.03, in line with the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects NeoGenomics to perform poorly. Analysts forecast its full-year EPS of $0.12 will hit $0.24.\n9. Cash Is King\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nWhile NeoGenomics posted positive free cash flow this quarter, the broader story hasn\u2019t been so clean. NeoGenomics\u2019s demanding reinvestments have consumed many resources over the last five years, contributing to an average free cash flow margin of negative 9.5%. This means it lit $9.50 of cash on fire for every $100 in revenue.\nTaking a step back, an encouraging sign is that NeoGenomics\u2019s margin expanded by 8.9 percentage points during that time. Despite its improvement and recent free cash flow generation, we\u2019d like to see more quarters of positive cash flow before recommending the stock.\nNeoGenomics\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $24.83 million in Q2, equivalent to a 13.7% margin. This result was good as its margin was 13.2 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, building on its favorable historical trend.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? A company\u2019s ROIC explains this by showing how much operating profit it makes compared to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nNeoGenomics\u2019s five-year average ROIC was negative 9.4%, meaning management lost money while trying to expand the business. Its returns were among the worst in the healthcare sector.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Unfortunately, NeoGenomics\u2019s ROIC averaged 1.4 percentage point decreases over the last few years. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between.\n11. Balance Sheet Risk\nAs long-term investors, the risk we care about most is the permanent loss of capital, which can happen when a company goes bankrupt or raises money from a disadvantaged position. This is separate from short-term stock price volatility, something we are much less bothered by.\nNeoGenomics burned through $8.35 million of cash over the last year, and its $411.8 million of debt exceeds the $163.7 million of cash on its balance sheet. This is a deal breaker for us because indebted loss-making companies spell trouble.\nUnless the NeoGenomics\u2019s fundamentals change quickly, it might find itself in a position where it must raise capital from investors to continue operating. Whether that would be favorable is unclear because dilution is a headwind for shareholder returns.\nWe remain cautious of NeoGenomics until it generates consistent free cash flow or any of its announced financing plans materialize on its balance sheet.\n12. Key Takeaways from NeoGenomics\u2019s Q2 Results\nRevenue in the quarter missed, and the company lowered its full-year revenue guidance. Full-year EPS guidance also came in below expectations. Overall, this was a terrible quarter. The stock traded down 15.8% to $5.45 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy NeoGenomics?\nUpdated: August 11, 2025 at 11:55 PM EDT\nBefore deciding whether to buy NeoGenomics or pass, we urge investors to consider business quality, valuation, and the latest quarterly results.\nWe cheer for all companies helping people live better, but in the case of NeoGenomics, we\u2019ll be cheering from the sidelines. Although its revenue growth was good over the last five years, it\u2019s expected to deteriorate over the next 12 months and its relatively low ROIC suggests management has struggled to find compelling investment opportunities. And while the company\u2019s rising cash profitability gives it more optionality, the downside is its operating margins reveal poor profitability compared to other healthcare companies.\nNeoGenomics\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 24.4x. This valuation tells us a lot of optimism is priced in - we think other companies feature superior fundamentals at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $8.61 on the company (compared to the current share price of $5.84).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

Compared to other healthcare companies, we think this multiple is fair for the revenue growth you get.\nNow could be a good time to invest if you believe in the story.\n3. BrightSpring Health Services (BTSG) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nHealthcare services provider BrightSpring Health Services (NASDAQ:BTSG) reported Q2 CY2025 results beating Wall Street\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 15.3% year on year to $3.15 billion. The company expects the full year\u2019s revenue to be around $12.4 billion, close to analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.22 per share was 17.6% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nBrightSpring Health Services (BTSG) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $3.15 billion vs analyst estimates of $2.99 billion (15.3% year-on-year growth, 5.2% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.22 vs analyst estimates of $0.19 (17.6% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $142.5 million vs analyst estimates of $139.4 million (4.5% margin, 2.2% beat)\n- The company lifted its revenue guidance for the full year to $12.4 billion at the midpoint from $12.25 billion, a 1.2% increase\n- EBITDA guidance for the full year is $597.5 million at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $579.8 million\n- Operating Margin: 1.5%, in line with the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow was $42.28 million, up from -$38.97 million in the same quarter last year\n- Market Capitalization: $3.63 billion\nCompany Overview\nFounded in 1974, BrightSpring Health Services (NASDAQ:BTSG) offers home health care, hospice, neuro-rehabilitation, and pharmacy services.\nThe company focuses on serving individuals in need of high-quality, personalized care in home and community settings as opposed to formal facilities such as hospitals.\n4. Senior Health, Home Health & Hospice\nThe senior health, home care, and hospice care industries provide essential services to aging populations and patients with chronic or terminal conditions. These companies benefit from stable, recurring revenue driven by relationships with patients and families that can extend many months or even years. However, the labor-intensive nature of the business makes it vulnerable to rising labor costs and staffing shortages, while profitability is constrained by reimbursement rates from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurers. Looking ahead, the industry is positioned for tailwinds from an aging population, increasing chronic disease prevalence, and a growing preference for personalized in-home care. Advancements in remote monitoring and telehealth are expected to enhance efficiency and care delivery. However, headwinds such as labor shortages, wage inflation, and regulatory uncertainty around reimbursement could pose challenges. Investments in digitization and technology-driven care will be critical for long-term success.\nCompetitors include Amedisys (NASDAQ:AMED), Encompass Health (NYSE:EHC), UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), and Addus HomeCare (NASDAQ:ADUS).\n5. Economies of Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith $11.99 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, BrightSpring Health Services has decent scale. This is important as it gives the company more leverage in a heavily regulated, competitive environment that is complex and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Over the last five years, BrightSpring Health Services grew its sales at an impressive 17.4% compounded annual growth rate. Its growth beat the average healthcare company and shows its offerings resonate with customers.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. BrightSpring Health Services\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 21.3% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting its demand was strong and recently accelerated.\nWe can better understand the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its most important segment, Pharmacy. Over the last two years, BrightSpring Health Services\u2019s Pharmacy revenue averaged 31.4% year-on-year growth. This segment has outperformed its total sales during the same period, lifting the company\u2019s performance.\nThis quarter, BrightSpring Health Services reported year-on-year revenue growth of 15.3%, and its $3.15 billion of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 5.2%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 9.1% over the next 12 months, a deceleration versus the last two years. We still think its growth trajectory is attractive given its scale and implies the market sees success for its products and services.\n7. Operating Margin\nBrightSpring Health Services was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average operating margin of 2.2% was weak for a healthcare business.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, BrightSpring Health Services\u2019s operating margin decreased by 2.2 percentage points over the last five years. This raises questions about the company\u2019s expense base because its revenue growth should have given it leverage on its fixed costs, resulting in better economies of scale and profitability. BrightSpring Health Services\u2019s performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows that costs were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass them onto its customers.\nIn Q2, BrightSpring Health Services generated an operating margin profit margin of 1.5%, in line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company\u2019s overall cost structure has been relatively stable.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nBrightSpring Health Services\u2019s full-year EPS grew at an astounding 26.2% compounded annual growth rate over the last four years, better than the broader healthcare sector.\nIn Q2, BrightSpring Health Services reported adjusted EPS at $0.22, up from $0.10 in the same quarter last year. This print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates, and shareholders should be content with the results. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects BrightSpring Health Services\u2019s full-year EPS of $0.74 to grow 33%.\n9. Cash Is King\nIf you\u2019ve followed StockStory for a while, you know we emphasize free cash flow. Why, you ask? We believe that in the end, cash is king, and you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nBrightSpring Health Services has shown mediocre cash profitability over the last five years, giving the company limited opportunities to return capital to shareholders. Its free cash flow margin averaged 1.4%, subpar for a healthcare business.\nTaking a step back, we can see that BrightSpring Health Services\u2019s margin dropped by 4.8 percentage points during that time. Almost any movement in the wrong direction is undesirable because of its already low cash conversion. If the trend continues, it could signal it\u2019s becoming a more capital-intensive business.\nBrightSpring Health Services\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $42.28 million in Q2, equivalent to a 1.3% margin. Its cash flow turned positive after being negative in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t put too much weight on the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, causing temporary swings. Long-term trends are more important.\n10. Balance Sheet Assessment\nBrightSpring Health Services reported $70.07 million of cash and $2.71 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $592 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view BrightSpring Health Services\u2019s 4.5\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $113.9 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n11. Key Takeaways from BrightSpring Health Services\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly BrightSpring Health Services blew past analysts\u2019 revenue expectations this quarter. We were also glad its EPS outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Zooming out, we think this quarter featured some important positives. The stock remained flat at $20.80 immediately following the results.\n12. Is Now The Time To Buy BrightSpring Health Services?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:23 AM EDT\nAre you wondering whether to buy BrightSpring Health Services or pass? We urge investors to not only consider the latest earnings results but also longer-term business quality and valuation as well.\nBrightSpring Health Services is a fine business. To kick things off, its revenue growth was impressive over the last five years. And while its operating margins are low compared to other healthcare companies, its astounding EPS growth over the last four years shows its profits are trickling down to shareholders. On top of that, its economies of scale give it more fixed cost leverage than its smaller competitors.\nBrightSpring Health Services\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 21.1x. Looking at the healthcare landscape right now, BrightSpring Health Services trades at a pretty interesting price. If you believe in the company and its growth potential, now is an opportune time to buy shares.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $28.71 on the company (compared to the current share price of $20.66), implying they see 39% upside in buying BrightSpring Health Services in the short term."

      "text": "AMN Healthcare Services (AMN)\nAMN Healthcare Services keeps us up at night. Its poor sales growth and falling returns on capital suggest its growth opportunities are shrinking.\u2015 StockStory Analyst Team\n1. News\n2. Summary\nWhy We Think AMN Healthcare Services Will Underperform\nWith a network of thousands of healthcare professionals ranging from nurses to physicians to executives, AMN Healthcare (NYSE:AMN) provides healthcare workforce solutions including temporary staffing, permanent placement, and technology platforms for hospitals and healthcare facilities across the United States.\n- Products and services are facing significant end-market challenges during this cycle as sales have declined by 20.5% annually over the last two years\n- Performance over the past five years shows its incremental sales were much less profitable, as its earnings per share fell by 8.4% annually\n- Projected sales decline of 9% over the next 12 months indicates demand will continue deteriorating\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than AMN Healthcare Services\nHigh Quality\nInvestable\nUnderperform\nWhy There Are Better Opportunities Than AMN Healthcare Services\nAMN Healthcare Services is trading at $16.62 per share, or 15.9x forward P/E. AMN Healthcare Services\u2019s multiple may seem like a great deal among healthcare peers, but we think there are valid reasons why it\u2019s this cheap.\nOur advice is to pay up for elite businesses whose advantages are tailwinds to earnings growth. Don\u2019t get sucked into lower-quality businesses just because they seem like bargains. These mediocre businesses often never achieve a higher multiple as hoped, a phenomenon known as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.\n3. AMN Healthcare Services (AMN) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nHealthcare staffing company AMN Healthcare Services (NYSE:AMN) reported Q2 CY2025 results exceeding the market\u2019s revenue expectations, but sales fell by 11.1% year on year to $658.2 million. On the other hand, next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance of $617.5 million was less impressive, coming in 3.7% below analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.30 per share was 60.9% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nAMN Healthcare Services (AMN) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $658.2 million vs analyst estimates of $652.8 million (11.1% year-on-year decline, 0.8% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.30 vs analyst estimates of $0.19 (60.9% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $58.29 million vs analyst estimates of $52.14 million (8.9% margin, 11.8% beat)\n- Revenue Guidance for Q3 CY2025 is $617.5 million at the midpoint, below analyst estimates of $641.5 million\n- Operating Margin: -18.8%, down from 5.1% in the same quarter last year\n- Free Cash Flow Margin: 11.9%, up from 9.8% in the same quarter last year\n- Sales Volumes fell 15.6% year on year (-24.2% in the same quarter last year)\n- Market Capitalization: $647.8 million\nCompany Overview\nWith a network of thousands of healthcare professionals ranging from nurses to physicians to executives, AMN Healthcare (NYSE:AMN) provides healthcare workforce solutions including temporary staffing, permanent placement, and technology platforms for hospitals and healthcare facilities across the United States.\nAMN Healthcare operates through three main segments: nurse and allied solutions, physician and leadership solutions, and technology and workforce solutions. The company serves as a crucial intermediary between healthcare professionals and the facilities that need them, helping to address staffing shortages and workforce challenges in the healthcare industry.\nIn its nurse and allied solutions segment, AMN offers travel nursing assignments (typically 13 weeks), international nurse recruitment, crisis staffing for emergencies, and local staffing services. Allied health professionals placed by AMN include physical therapists, respiratory therapists, medical technologists, and pharmacists.\nThe physician and leadership solutions segment provides locum tenens (temporary physician) staffing, permanent physician recruitment, and interim leadership for healthcare organizations needing executives or clinical leaders on a temporary basis. This allows facilities to maintain operations during leadership transitions or address unexpected vacancies.\nThrough its technology and workforce solutions segment, AMN offers managed services programs (MSPs) where it oversees a client's entire contingent staffing process. The company's vendor management systems (VMS) help healthcare organizations track and manage their staffing needs efficiently. AMN also provides language interpretation services through video and phone platforms, helping healthcare providers communicate with patients who speak different languages.\nAMN generates revenue by charging healthcare facilities for its staffing and workforce solutions while paying the healthcare professionals it places. The company typically earns the difference between what clients pay for services and what AMN pays to the healthcare professionals, creating a margin on each placement. For technology solutions, AMN often uses a subscription or service-fee model.\n4. Specialized Medical & Nursing Services\nThe skilled nursing services industry provides specialized care for patients requiring medical or rehabilitative support after hospital stays or for chronic conditions. These companies benefit from stable demand driven by an aging population and recurring revenue from Medicare, Medicaid, and private insurance. However, the industry faces challenges such as thin margins due to high labor costs and stringent regulatory requirements. Looking ahead, the industry is supported by tailwinds from an aging population, which means higher chronic disease prevalence. Advances in medical technology, including using AI to better predict, diagnose, and treat illnesses, may reduce hospital readmissions and improve outcomes. However, headwinds such as labor shortages, wage inflation, and potential government reimbursement cuts pose challenges. Adapting to value-based care models may further squeeze margins by requiring investments in training, technology, and compliance.\nAMN Healthcare's main competitors include Cross Country Healthcare (NASDAQ: CCRN), CHG Healthcare Services, Aya Healthcare, HealthTrust Workforce Solutions, and Ingenovis Health. In the language services segment, it competes with LanguageLine Solutions.\n5. Economies of Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith $2.77 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, AMN Healthcare Services has decent scale. This is important as it gives the company more leverage in a heavily regulated, competitive environment that is complex and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nReviewing a company\u2019s long-term sales performance reveals insights into its quality. Any business can have short-term success, but a top-tier one grows for years. Regrettably, AMN Healthcare Services\u2019s sales grew at a tepid 3.2% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This was below our standard for the healthcare sector and is a tough starting point for our analysis.\nWe at StockStory place the most emphasis on long-term growth, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss recent innovations or disruptive industry trends. AMN Healthcare Services\u2019s performance shows it grew in the past but relinquished its gains over the last two years, as its revenue fell by 20.5% annually.\nAMN Healthcare Services also reports its number of travelers on assignment, which reached 8,700 in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, AMN Healthcare Services\u2019s travelers on assignment averaged 21.5% year-on-year declines. Because this number is in line with its revenue growth, we can see the company kept its prices fairly consistent.\nThis quarter, AMN Healthcare Services\u2019s revenue fell by 11.1% year on year to $658.2 million but beat Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 0.8%. Company management is currently guiding for a 10.2% year-on-year decline in sales next quarter.\nLooking further ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to decline by 12.4% over the next 12 months. Although this projection is better than its two-year trend, it\u2019s hard to get excited about a company that is struggling with demand.\n7. Adjusted Operating Margin\nAdjusted operating margin is a key measure of profitability. Think of it as net income (the bottom line) excluding the impact of non-recurring expenses, taxes, and interest on debt - metrics less connected to business fundamentals.\nAMN Healthcare Services was profitable over the last five years but held back by its large cost base. Its average adjusted operating margin of 9.9% was weak for a healthcare business.\nLooking at the trend in its profitability, AMN Healthcare Services\u2019s adjusted operating margin decreased by 12.9 percentage points over the last five years. The company\u2019s two-year trajectory also shows it failed to get its profitability back to the peak as its margin fell by 13.8 percentage points. This performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows its expenses were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass those costs onto its customers.\nIn Q2, AMN Healthcare Services generated an adjusted operating margin profit margin of negative 18.8%, down 25.5 percentage points year on year. This contraction shows it was less efficient because its expenses increased relative to its revenue.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nWe track the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) for the same reason as long-term revenue growth. Compared to revenue, however, EPS highlights whether a company\u2019s growth is profitable.\nSadly for AMN Healthcare Services, its EPS declined by 8.4% annually over the last five years while its revenue grew by 3.2%. This tells us the company became less profitable on a per-share basis as it expanded due to non-fundamental factors such as interest expenses and taxes.\nDiving into the nuances of AMN Healthcare Services\u2019s earnings can give us a better understanding of its performance. As we mentioned earlier, AMN Healthcare Services\u2019s adjusted operating margin declined by 12.9 percentage points over the last five years. This was the most relevant factor (aside from the revenue impact) behind its lower earnings; interest expenses and taxes can also affect EPS but don\u2019t tell us as much about a company\u2019s fundamentals.\nIn Q2, AMN Healthcare Services reported adjusted EPS at $0.30, down from $0.98 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects AMN Healthcare Services\u2019s full-year EPS of $2.11 to shrink by 50.9%.\n9. Cash Is King\nAlthough earnings are undoubtedly valuable for assessing company performance, we believe cash is king because you can\u2019t use accounting profits to pay the bills.\nAMN Healthcare Services has shown decent cash profitability, giving it some flexibility to reinvest or return capital to investors. The company\u2019s free cash flow margin averaged 8.7% over the last five years, slightly better than the broader healthcare sector.\nAMN Healthcare Services\u2019s free cash flow clocked in at $78.55 million in Q2, equivalent to a 11.9% margin. This result was good as its margin was 2.2 percentage points higher than in the same quarter last year, but we wouldn\u2019t read too much into the short term because investment needs can be seasonal, leading to temporary swings. Long-term trends trump fluctuations.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAMN Healthcare Services\u2019s management team makes decent investment decisions and generates value for shareholders. Its five-year average ROIC was 8.9%, slightly better than typical healthcare business.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, AMN Healthcare Services\u2019s ROIC has unfortunately decreased significantly. We like what management has done in the past, but its declining returns are perhaps a symptom of fewer profitable growth opportunities.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nAMN Healthcare Services reported $41.5 million of cash and $986.5 million of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $271.5 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view AMN Healthcare Services\u2019s 3.5\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $38.52 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from AMN Healthcare Services\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe were impressed by how significantly AMN Healthcare Services blew past analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. We were also glad its revenue guidance for next quarter slightly exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Overall, we think this was a solid quarter with some key areas of upside. Investors were likely hoping for more, and shares traded down 6.5% to $15.80 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy AMN Healthcare Services?\nUpdated: August 12, 2025 at 12:31 AM EDT\nWhen considering an investment in AMN Healthcare Services, investors should account for its valuation and business qualities as well as what\u2019s happened in the latest quarter.\nWe see the value of companies making people healthier, but in the case of AMN Healthcare Services, we\u2019re out. For starters, its revenue growth was uninspiring over the last five years, and analysts expect its demand to deteriorate over the next 12 months. And while its solid free cash flow generation gives it reinvestment options, the downside is its diminishing returns show management's prior bets haven't worked out. On top of that, its declining EPS over the last five years makes it a less attractive asset to the public markets.\nAMN Healthcare Services\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 15.9x. This valuation tells us it\u2019s a bit of a market darling with a lot of good news priced in - we think other companies feature superior fundamentals at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $22 on the company (compared to the current share price of $16.62).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."

This is a cheap valuation multiple, but for good reason. You get what you pay for.\nIt\u2019s better to pay up for high-quality businesses with higher long-term earnings potential rather than to buy lower-quality stocks because they appear cheap. These challenged businesses often don\u2019t re-rate, a phenomenon known as a \u201cvalue trap\u201d.\n3. Acadia Healthcare (ACHC) Research Report: Q2 CY2025 Update\nBehavioral health company Acadia Healthcare (NASDAQ:ACHC) reported Q2 CY2025 results topping the market\u2019s revenue expectations, with sales up 9.2% year on year to $869.2 million. The company expects the full year\u2019s revenue to be around $3.33 billion, close to analysts\u2019 estimates. Its non-GAAP profit of $0.83 per share was 17.4% above analysts\u2019 consensus estimates.\nAcadia Healthcare (ACHC) Q2 CY2025 Highlights:\n- Revenue: $869.2 million vs analyst estimates of $842.2 million (9.2% year-on-year growth, 3.2% beat)\n- Adjusted EPS: $0.83 vs analyst estimates of $0.71 (17.4% beat)\n- Adjusted EBITDA: $201.8 million vs analyst estimates of $177.2 million (23.2% margin, 13.9% beat)\n- The company dropped its revenue guidance for the full year to $3.33 billion at the midpoint from $3.35 billion, a 0.7% decrease\n- Management lowered its full-year Adjusted EPS guidance to $2.55 at the midpoint, a 3.8% decrease\n- EBITDA guidance for the full year is $687.5 million at the midpoint, in line with analyst expectations\n- Free Cash Flow was -$34.24 million, down from $16.91 million in the same quarter last year\n- Sales Volumes fell 1.2% year on year (1% in the same quarter last year)\n- Market Capitalization: $1.97 billion\nCompany Overview\nWith a network of over 250 facilities serving patients in 38 states and Puerto Rico, Acadia Healthcare (NASDAQ:ACHC) operates facilities providing mental health and substance use disorder treatment services across the United States.\nAcadia's treatment facilities are organized into four main categories, each addressing different levels of patient needs. Acute inpatient psychiatric facilities provide 24-hour crisis stabilization for patients who may be a danger to themselves or others, with psychiatrists, nurses, and therapists delivering intensive medical and behavioral interventions. Specialty treatment facilities focus on addiction recovery and eating disorders, offering various levels of care from detoxification to outpatient services.\nThe company's Comprehensive Treatment Centers (CTCs) specialize in medication-assisted treatment for opioid addiction in outpatient settings, combining behavioral therapy with medications that normalize brain chemistry. Residential treatment centers provide longer-term care for children and adolescents with severe psychiatric disorders and trauma histories, often in secure environments with educational programs.\nA patient experiencing severe depression might enter Acadia's acute care for immediate stabilization, then transition to a specialty facility for ongoing therapy. Similarly, someone struggling with opioid addiction might receive medication and counseling at a CTC, with treatment potentially lasting a year or longer.\nAcadia generates revenue through multiple payment sources, including state Medicaid programs, commercial insurance, Medicare, and direct patient payments. The company pursues growth through five main pathways: expanding existing facilities, forming joint venture partnerships (often with healthcare systems), building new facilities, acquiring other behavioral healthcare providers, and extending its continuum of care offerings.\nThe behavioral healthcare industry faces significant regulatory oversight, with facilities maintaining accreditations from organizations like The Joint Commission and complying with various healthcare laws including HIPAA privacy regulations and physician self-referral restrictions.\n4. Hospital Chains\nHospital chains operate scale-driven businesses that rely on patient volumes, efficient operations, and favorable payer contracts to drive revenue and profitability. These organizations benefit from the essential nature of their services, which ensures consistent demand, particularly as populations age and chronic diseases become more prevalent. However, profitability can be pressured by rising labor costs, regulatory requirements, and the challenges of balancing care quality with cost efficiency. Dependence on government and private insurance reimbursements also introduces financial uncertainty. Looking ahead, hospital chains stand to benefit from tailwinds such as increasing healthcare utilization driven by an aging population that generally has higher incidents of disease. AI can also be a tailwind in areas such as predictive analytics for more personalized treatment and efficiency (intake, staffing, resourcing allocation). However, the sector faces potential headwinds such as labor shortages that could push up wages as well as substantial investments needs for digital infrastructure to support telehealth and electronic health records. Regulatory scrutiny, and reimbursement cuts are also looming topics that could further strain margins.\nAcadia Healthcare's primary competitor is Universal Health Services (NYSE:UHS), which operates behavioral health facilities alongside its acute care hospitals. Other competitors include private behavioral health providers and hospital systems with psychiatric units.\n5. Economies of Scale\nLarger companies benefit from economies of scale, where fixed costs like infrastructure, technology, and administration are spread over a higher volume of goods or services, reducing the cost per unit. Scale can also lead to bargaining power with suppliers, greater brand recognition, and more investment firepower. A virtuous cycle can ensue if a scaled company plays its cards right.\nWith $3.23 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Acadia Healthcare has decent scale. This is important as it gives the company more leverage in a heavily regulated, competitive environment that is complex and resource-intensive.\n6. Revenue Growth\nA company\u2019s long-term sales performance is one signal of its overall quality. Even a bad business can shine for one or two quarters, but a top-tier one grows for years. Regrettably, Acadia Healthcare\u2019s sales grew at a mediocre 4.8% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years. This was below our standard for the healthcare sector and is a tough starting point for our analysis.\nLong-term growth is the most important, but within healthcare, a half-decade historical view may miss new innovations or demand cycles. Acadia Healthcare\u2019s annualized revenue growth of 7.8% over the last two years is above its five-year trend, suggesting some bright spots.\nWe can dig further into the company\u2019s revenue dynamics by analyzing its number of admissions, which reached 49,903 in the latest quarter. Over the last two years, Acadia Healthcare\u2019s admissions averaged 1.5% year-on-year growth. Because this number is lower than its revenue growth, we can see the company benefited from price increases.\nThis quarter, Acadia Healthcare reported year-on-year revenue growth of 9.2%, and its $869.2 million of revenue exceeded Wall Street\u2019s estimates by 3.2%.\nLooking ahead, sell-side analysts expect revenue to grow 8% over the next 12 months, similar to its two-year rate. This projection is above average for the sector and suggests its newer products and services will help support its recent top-line performance.\n7. Operating Margin\nOperating margin is one of the best measures of profitability because it tells us how much money a company takes home after subtracting all core expenses, like marketing and R&D.\nAcadia Healthcare has done a decent job managing its cost base over the last five years. The company has produced an average operating margin of 12.4%, higher than the broader healthcare sector.\nAnalyzing the trend in its profitability, Acadia Healthcare\u2019s operating margin decreased by 7.8 percentage points over the last five years. The company\u2019s two-year trajectory also shows it failed to get its profitability back to the peak as its margin fell by 5.9 percentage points. This performance was poor no matter how you look at it - it shows its expenses were rising and it couldn\u2019t pass those costs onto its customers.\nin line with the same quarter last year. This indicates the company\u2019s overall cost structure has been relatively stable.\n8. Earnings Per Share\nRevenue trends explain a company\u2019s historical growth, but the long-term change in earnings per share (EPS) points to the profitability of that growth \u2013 for example, a company could inflate its sales through excessive spending on advertising and promotions.\nAcadia Healthcare\u2019s EPS grew at a decent 6.9% compounded annual growth rate over the last five years, higher than its 4.8% annualized revenue growth. However, we take this with a grain of salt because its operating margin didn\u2019t improve and it didn\u2019t repurchase its shares, meaning the delta came from reduced interest expenses or taxes.\nIn Q2, Acadia Healthcare reported adjusted EPS at $0.83, down from $0.91 in the same quarter last year. Despite falling year on year, this print easily cleared analysts\u2019 estimates. Over the next 12 months, Wall Street expects Acadia Healthcare\u2019s full-year EPS of $2.78 to stay about the same.\n9. Cash Is King\nFree cash flow isn't a prominently featured metric in company financials and earnings releases, but we think it's telling because it accounts for all operating and capital expenses, making it tough to manipulate. Cash is king.\nAcadia Healthcare\u2019s demanding reinvestments have consumed many resources over the last five years, contributing to an average free cash flow margin of negative 1.6%. This means it lit $1.62 of cash on fire for every $100 in revenue.\nTaking a step back, we can see that Acadia Healthcare\u2019s margin dropped by 24.8 percentage points during that time. It may have ticked higher more recently, but shareholders are likely hoping for its margin to at least revert to its historical level. Almost any movement in the wrong direction is undesirable because it\u2019s already burning cash. If the longer-term trend returns, it could signal it\u2019s becoming a more capital-intensive business.\nAcadia Healthcare burned through $34.24 million of cash in Q2, equivalent to a negative 3.9% margin. The company\u2019s cash flow turned negative after being positive in the same quarter last year, suggesting its historical struggles have dragged on.\n10. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)\nEPS and free cash flow tell us whether a company was profitable while growing its revenue. But was it capital-efficient? Enter ROIC, a metric showing how much operating profit a company generates relative to the money it has raised (debt and equity).\nAcadia Healthcare historically did a mediocre job investing in profitable growth initiatives. Its five-year average ROIC was 6%, somewhat low compared to the best healthcare companies that consistently pump out 20%+.\nWe like to invest in businesses with high returns, but the trend in a company\u2019s ROIC is what often surprises the market and moves the stock price. Over the last few years, Acadia Healthcare\u2019s ROIC averaged 3.9 percentage point decreases each year. Paired with its already low returns, these declines suggest its profitable growth opportunities are few and far between.\n11. Balance Sheet Assessment\nAcadia Healthcare reported $131.4 million of cash and $2.38 billion of debt on its balance sheet in the most recent quarter. As investors in high-quality companies, we primarily focus on two things: 1) that a company\u2019s debt level isn\u2019t too high and 2) that its interest payments are not excessively burdening the business.\nWith $683.5 million of EBITDA over the last 12 months, we view Acadia Healthcare\u2019s 3.3\u00d7 net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio as safe. We also see its $89.18 million of annual interest expenses as appropriate. The company\u2019s profits give it plenty of breathing room, allowing it to continue investing in growth initiatives.\n12. Key Takeaways from Acadia Healthcare\u2019s Q2 Results\nWe enjoyed seeing Acadia Healthcare beat analysts\u2019 EPS expectations this quarter. We were also glad its revenue outperformed Wall Street\u2019s estimates. On the other hand, the company's sales volume fell short of Wall Street\u2019s estimates. Looking ahead, full-year revenue guidance was lowered and full-year EPS guidance was lowered and missed. Overall, this quarter could have been better. The stock traded down 3.6% to $21 immediately following the results.\n13. Is Now The Time To Buy Acadia Healthcare?\nUpdated: August 11, 2025 at 11:55 PM EDT\nAre you wondering whether to buy Acadia Healthcare or pass? We urge investors to not only consider the latest earnings results but also longer-term business quality and valuation as well.\nAcadia Healthcare isn\u2019t a terrible business, but it isn\u2019t one of our picks. To begin with, its revenue growth was mediocre over the last five years. And while its sturdy operating margins show it has disciplined cost controls, the downside is its cash profitability fell over the last five years. On top of that, its operations are burning a modest amount of cash.\nAcadia Healthcare\u2019s P/E ratio based on the next 12 months is 6.9x. While this valuation is optically cheap, the potential downside is big given its shaky fundamentals. We're pretty confident there are more exciting stocks to buy at the moment.\nWall Street analysts have a consensus one-year price target of $33.21 on the company (compared to the current share price of $19.03).\nAlthough the price target is bullish, readers should exercise caution because analysts tend to be overly optimistic. The firms they work for, often big banks, have relationships with companies that extend into fundraising, M&A advisory, and other rewarding business lines. As a result, they typically hesitate to say bad things for fear they will lose out. We at StockStory do not suffer from such conflicts of interest, so we\u2019ll always tell it like it is."
