      "feedback": "The draft correctly links Fed policy, inflation, and the S&P 500 but drifts into DXY‑centric detail that dilutes the focus on the index. Remove the paragraph on DXY’s short‑term upside (the sentence starting “The U.S. Dollar Index’s short‑term upside hinges…”) or re‑frame it as a secondary channel: “A 50–100 bp rise in DXY would lift risk‑on sentiment and support the S&P 500 (7XH2DKEKV)”. Tighten the causal chain by explicitly stating that a Fed cut → lower 2‑yr → lower term premium → higher equity risk‑premium → 3–5 % rally (B1KYJ1GPU)(3YAQ8JUPL). Replace vague “high probability of a September Fed cut” with the concrete July CPI/PCE catalyst window (2025‑07‑15) and the Sept 5 payrolls (2025‑09‑05) as the key dates. Quantify the tech concentration risk: “40 % of the index is in the top ten tech names; a 10 % earnings miss could trigger a 5–10 % pullback (FAN5RYW6T)”. Add a short‑term risk‑premium range: “If the 10‑yr stays >4.3 % through Q3, the S&P could decline 5–10 % (97MD1FHW8)”. Finally, include a single invalidation clause: “A Fed surprise hike on 2025‑09‑16 would steepen the curve, erode valuations, and reverse the rally (Z7)”. Ensure every claim has an inline citation and that the narrative stays within the 3–6 month horizon.",
