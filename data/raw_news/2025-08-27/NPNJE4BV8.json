  "title": "Citi wealth boss Andy Sieg denies claims he threw tirades, made execs cry: \u2018Not accurate\u2019",
  "description": "Sieg, 58, told Fox Business News anchor Maria Bartiromo on Wednesday that \u201cthe stories themselves are not accurate.\u201d",
  "content": "Citigroup\u2019s embattled wealth boss Andy Sieg brushed off reports that he terrorized colleagues with profanity-laced tirades \u2014 and hinted that business has improved as laggard employees have gone and been replaced.\n\nSieg, 58, told Fox Business Network anchor Maria Bartiromo on Wednesday that \u201cthe stories themselves are not accurate\u201d and insisted the sweeping changes he\u2019s imposed inside Citi were part of a deliberate restructuring.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019d say overall is change is hard, and we\u2019ve been driving a lot of change across Citi and in our wealth business. That change is working, I\u2019m happy to say,\u201d Sieg told Bartiromo on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe quality of talent that has risen up inside Citi and joined our part of the business from outside has been phenomenal. So we\u2019re moving ahead full speed.\u201d\n\nThe comments came only days after Bloomberg revealed that Citi had hired powerhouse law firm Paul Weiss to probe Sieg\u2019s alleged volcanic temper \u2014 with at least six managing directors accusing him of humiliating subordinates in front of colleagues.\n\nSources told the outlet Sieg allegedly unleashed expletive-filled rants, belittled staffers\u2019 work as \u201cpathetic\u201d and once slammed a table so hard during a meeting that a male managing director broke down in tears.\n\nAt the center of the claims is Sieg\u2019s treatment of Ida Liu, 49, who ran Citi\u2019s private bank for nearly two decades before her sudden exit in January. Liu previously held the same post Jane Fraser occupied on her path to CEO, making her departure particularly significant.\n\nWitnesses told investigators Sieg openly mocked Liu in meetings, undermined her authority and made disparaging remarks about her both in public and private, Bloomberg reported.\n\nAfter Liu\u2019s exit, Sieg scrapped her job entirely and instead installed four male executives as regional co-heads reporting directly to him, according to Bloomberg.\n\nSieg\u2019s No. 2, chief operating officer Valentin Valderrabano, allegedly ordered another managing director to cut Liu out of key business correspondence, a move that further marginalized her role, the report said.\n\nAnother senior figure, wealth executive Kristen Bitterly, also lodged multiple complaints with human resources after allegedly facing Sieg\u2019s wrath, according to the Bloomberg report.\n\nHer predecessor, Naz Vahid, had already left last year after nearly four decades at the bank, partly due to concerns about Sieg\u2019s conduct, Bloomberg reported.\n\nOther staffers claimed Sieg would ridicule executives behind their backs \u2014 and sometimes to their faces \u2014 in front of peers.\n\nAs complaints piled up, Citi\u2019s HR chief Sara Wechter tapped Paul Weiss to investigate. The firm interviewed more than a dozen witnesses, with questioning continuing as recently as July, people familiar with the probe told Bloomberg.\n\nBoard chair John Dugan was also sent anonymous letters describing troubling behavior by Sieg, both at Citi and in earlier roles at Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Lynch, where he previously ran wealth management.\n\nThe findings of the outside review have not been released, and Citi has refused to say whether Sieg faces any discipline. He did not respond to repeated requests for comment from Bloomberg or The Post.\n\nCiti spokesman Mark Costiglio defended Sieg as \u201ca highly respected leader with more than 25 years operating at the most senior levels of the wealth management industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he joined Citi in 2023, it was with a clear mandate for change and Wealth has been transformed under his leadership,\u201d Costiglio said in a statement.\n\nHe praised Sieg as \u201ca hard-charging leader\u201d who built \u201ca strong, client-focused franchise that is delivering revenue growth and improved returns.\u201d\n\nCostiglio added that more than 40% of the wealth unit\u2019s senior leadership team are women, despite complaints that Sieg marginalized top female executives.\n\nCEO Jane Fraser, 58, who lured Sieg to Citi in a personal recruitment pitch at her Connecticut home, has yet to say whether she will take action against her prized hire.\n\nFraser has been banking on Sieg to transform Citi\u2019s wealth arm into a profit engine as she slashes 20,000 jobs across the firm.\n\nSieg, who sits on Citi\u2019s 18-member executive management team, is widely seen as a potential successor to Fraser.\n\nHis division delivered record revenue of $2.17 billion in the second quarter and Citi shares are up nearly 40% this year, outpacing rivals.",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21. Terms Pertaining to Certain Third Party Content, Data and Information Providers and Mobile Application Platforms.\n21.1 AP Material. By accessing the Services, you specifically acknowledge and agree that (i) Associated Press text, photo, graphic, video and/or audio material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium; (ii) No Associated Press materials nor any portion thereof may be stored in a computer except for personal and non-commercial use; (iii) The Associated Press will not be held liable for any delays, inaccuracies, errors or omissions therefrom or in the transmission or delivery of all or any part thereof or for any damages arising from any of the foregoing; (iv) The Associated Press is an intended third party beneficiary of these terms and conditions and it may exercise all rights and remedies available to it; and (v) The Associated Press reserves the right to audit possible unauthorized commercial use of AP materials or any portion thereof at any time.\n21.2 Mobile Applications.

      "text": "Google warns 2.5B Gmail users to update passwords after hackers complete \u2018successful intrusions\u2019\nGoogle has warned most of its 2.5 billion Gmail users to update their passwords and strengthen their account security as password hackers have carried out a significant amount of \u201csuccessful intrusions.\u201d\nIt is advising users to be on high alert for suspicious activity and add extra security measures, like two-factor authentication, if they have not already.\nHackers often access Gmail passwords by sending emails with links to fake sign-in pages, or by tricking users into sharing their two-factor authentication codes.\nWhile most users have strong, unique passwords, only a third regularly update these keys, according to Google data.\nSeparately, Google has also advised customers to ramp up their security measures after a breach of its own Salesforce database.\nIn June, it warned that bad actors were targeting people through social engineering attacks \u2013 posing as IT support staffers, which was \u201cparticularly effective in tricking employees,\u201d Google said.\nThis hack largely compromised publicly available data, like contact details for small- and medium-size businesses, but the hacking method could be used for more serious attacks in the future.\n\u201cWe believe threat actors using the \u2018ShinyHunters\u2019 brand may be preparing to escalate their extortion tactics by launching a data leak site (DLS),\u201d Google said in a June blog post.\n\u201cThese new tactics are likely intended to increase pressure on victims, including those associated with the recent UNC6040 Salesforce-related data breaches.\u201d\nIt notified all users impacted by this incident via email on Aug. 8.\nShinyHunters, which seemingly pulls its name from the Pok\u00e9mon franchise, formed in 2020 and has since been linked to several high-profile breaches of firms like AT&T, Microsoft, Santander and Ticketmaster."

      "text": "Shell fired white staffers at Houston offices for \u2018weaker\u2019 diverse hires in \u2018discriminatory\u2019 purge: lawsuit\nOil giant Shell USA allegedly ousted all the white employees from its corporate security team in Houston \u2014 replacing them with less qualified people of color in what amounted to a discriminatory purge, according to a bombshell lawsuit.\nKevin Taylor and Gulf War veteran Michelle Romak, who are both white, claim they were booted from their jobs earlier this year despite each having more than a decade of relevant experience at Shell, according to the lawsuit filed in the US Southern District of Texas on Tuesday.\nThey are suing Shell and Wayne Hunt, a regional security manager \u2013 alleging they participated in a discriminatory restructuring under DEI mandates that violate civil rights laws.\nShell did not respond to The Post\u2019s request for comment.\nIn January, Hunt announced an upcoming reorganization and required all of the white employees on the team to reapply for their current roles \u2013 though non-white team members were not required to submit applications, according to the lawsuit.\nAt the time, Hunt told Taylor that he had to resubmit for his current job because \u201cothers had expressed interest\u201d and Shell \u201cwas looking to diversify the talent,\u201d the suit alleged.\nHigh-level security roles were then given to a Hispanic woman who had a background as an administrative assistant and a black man with no background in protecting people or assets, according to the lawsuit.\nA Hispanic contractor for Shell \u2013 whose contract had previously been in the process of being terminated for poor performance \u2013 also won a role on the team, along with a Hispanic woman without US citizenship, the lawsuit said.\nWhen it was revealed that she was ineligible due to her citizenship, the woman was given a high-level role at Shell in Mexico, according to the complaint.\nThe lawsuit accuses Shell of maintaining illegal racial hiring and promotion quotas in the US \u2013 despite actions taken by the Trump administration to squash DEI programs.\nOn its website, the oil company boasts that it is \u201cworking to become one of the most diverse and inclusive organizations in the world.\u201d\nIt has a Global Council for Race consisting of senior executives that \u201caims to advance diversity in our workforce so that it better reflects communities in which we work.\u201d\nTaylor was stripped of his role and forced to relocate to the East Coast, while Romak and Thomas Hutt \u2013 a white man and US veteran who worked at Shell for 15 years \u2013 were fired, the suit claims.\nHunt, who managed the security team, appeared to mock Romak and Hutt\u2019s firings \u2013 giving them each a \u201ctear jar,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\u201cThis is evidence of conduct that is callous, willful and wanton,\u201d the lawsuit said.\nIt became clear that these promoted employees had \u201cobjectively weaker qualifications\u201d \u2013 with at least one asking Taylor for help with their new job, according to the lawsuit.\nTaylor was ousted from his role in Houston \u2013 where he was replaced with Ana Chevez, a Hispanic woman \u2013 and relocated to a security advisor position in the east region, which had been his third of four choices, the suit said.\nBut Taylor has repeatedly been asked to complete tasks belonging to Chevez \u2013 like guarding the CEO \u2013 because \u201cit was well known that she was not competent to fulfill those duties,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\nTaylor was passed over for his second-choice position in the west region, which went to Hector Erazo, a Hispanic man and contractor for Shell, the suit said.\nHutt \u2013 who supervised Taylor and Romak before he was fired \u2013 said both were more qualified than Erazo, whose contract he had been in the process of terminating in 2024 for poor performance, according to the lawsuit.\nSince taking on the role in August, Erazo has asked for Taylor\u2019s help, claiming he has never completed a security assessment or security plan for executive protection \u2013 even admitting that he has never seen one, according to the lawsuit.\nThe Post was unable to reach Chevez and Erazo for comment.\n\u201cWhat our clients experienced should alarm every American,\u201d Juli Haller, attorney for America First Legal, which filed the suit on behalf of Taylor and Romak, said in a statement.\n\u201cIf a corporation can openly discriminate against employees because of the color of their skin \u2014 under the guise of DEI \u2014 then no one\u2019s rights are safe.\u201d\nTaylor and Romak are seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages."

      "text": "Top Citigroup banker Andy Sieg allegedly humiliated employees with explosive tirades, made executive cry: report\nCitigroup\u2019s star wealth chief Andy Sieg is being probed after at least six managing directors accused him of humiliating employees with explosive tirades \u2014 including one outburst that reduced an executive to tears, according to a report.\nThe New York-based megabank hired white-shoe law firm Paul Weiss to investigate CEO Jane Fraser\u2019s prized recruit following allegations that he mocked and undermined one of Citigroup\u2019s most prominent female executives before she left the firm, according to Bloomberg News.\nSieg, 58, whom Fraser personally courted at his Connecticut home to poach from Bank of America\u2019s Merrill Lynch division, allegedly unleashed expletive-filled rants and called employees\u2019 work \u201cpathetic\u201d in front of their peers, sources told Bloomberg.\n\u201cSome of the people also described a male managing director being reduced to tears after Sieg berated him in front of colleagues while striking a tabletop,\u201d according to the report.\nAt the center of the complaints was Sieg\u2019s treatment of Ida Liu, 49, who ran Citigroup\u2019s private bank for 18 years before abruptly leaving in January.\nLiu once held the same position Fraser occupied on her climb to CEO, making her departure particularly significant.\nWitnesses told investigators that Sieg openly mocked Liu in meetings, undermined her authority and made disparaging comments both to her face and behind her back.\nHis chief operating officer, Valentin Valderrabano, allegedly ordered another managing director to cut Liu out of critical business correspondence, that executive told Bloomberg News.\nAfter Liu\u2019s exit, Sieg eliminated her position entirely and replaced her with four male regional co-heads reporting directly to him, according to the report.\nSenior wealth executive Kristen Bitterly also became a target of Sieg\u2019s harsh treatment, prompting multiple complaints to human resources, sources told Bloomberg News.\nHer predecessor, Naz Vahid, quit last year after nearly 40 years at Citigroup, partly because of concerns about how Sieg treated colleagues, people familiar with the situation told the financial news agency.\nOther alleged incidents included Sieg sarcastically ridiculing an executive to colleagues immediately after the person left the room.\nHuman resources chief Sara Wechter ordered the outside investigation as complaints piled up from both male and female executives about Sieg\u2019s conduct since joining the bank nearly two years ago, according to the report.\nBoard chair John Dugan also received anonymous letters alleging troubling behavior from both Sieg\u2019s current role and earlier career stints, according to correspondence reviewed by Bloomberg News.\nPaul Weiss investigators interviewed more than a dozen witnesses, with some questioned as recently as July, before wrapping up their probe, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News.\nThe bank refused to reveal the investigation\u2019s findings. Sieg didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment from Bloomberg and The Post.\n\u201cIt is standard practice for us to engage an outside law firm to investigate allegations made against a senior member of the management team,\u201d Citigroup spokesperson Mark Costiglio told Bloomberg News.\nCostiglio also The Post: \u201cAndy is a highly respected leader with more than 25 years operating at the most senior levels of the wealth management industry.\u201d\n\u201cWhen he joined Citi in 2023, it was with a clear mandate for change and Wealth has been transformed under his leadership,\u201d the Citi rep added in a statement to The Post.\nCostiglio praised Sieg as \u201ca hard-charging leader who has established a strong, client-focused franchise that is delivering revenue growth and improved returns.\u201d\n\u201cHe also continues to attract, retain and promote industry-leading talent, including the more than 40% of accomplished women on Wealth\u2019s Senior Leadership Team,\u201d Costiglio told The Post.\n\u201cWe look forward to Andy continuing to drive strong business performance.\u201d\nFraser, 58, who became CEO in 2021, had bet big on Sieg to transform the wealth division as part of her broader push to boost profitability.\nSieg sits on Citigroup\u2019s 18-person executive management team and is widely viewed as a potential successor to Fraser.\nUnder his leadership, the wealth unit posted record revenue of $2.17 billion in the second quarter while shifting focus from lending to investment management.\nCitigroup shares have surged 33% this year, outpacing other major banks.\nBut the exodus of several longtime executives tells a different story about life under Sieg\u2019s regime.\nThe wealth division has undergone massive layoffs as part of Fraser\u2019s plan to eliminate 20,000 positions across the bank.\nSenior managers grew alarmed at the intensity of complaints about Sieg\u2019s behavior during the restructuring, sources said.\nWhether Fraser will take action against her handpicked lieutenant or stand by him despite the damaging allegations remains unclear as the investigation\u2019s conclusions stay buried.\nThe Post has sought comment from Sieg, Fraser, Citi, Paul Weiss and Liu."

He faces 11 felony counts.\nAhl\u2019s ex-wife, Lorena Solis, and her partner, Enrique Neira Moreno, also took part in the crime ring, helping to resell stolen goods from a warehouse piled high with boxes, according to Ventura County officials.\nShocking Home Depot surveillance footage shows Eber Bonilla Lopez of Pomona \u2013 one of the main \u201cbooster crew\u201d members \u2013 using a pole to frantically knock down boxes of goods while stuffing electrical breakers, each worth $100, into his pockets.\nJose Banuelos Guerrero of South Gate and Edwin Rivera of Los Angeles were also boosters \u2013 accused of stealing products worth as much as $10,000 on a daily basis, officials said.\nErlin Hernandez Lopez and Denny Hernandez Gomez, both of Pomona, were part of a second booster crew, according to officials.\nThe nine crime ring members who have been charged face maximum sentences from four to 32 years in state prison. The status of the other five arrested earlier this month is unknown.\nMore arrests are likely as this case continues, officials said."
