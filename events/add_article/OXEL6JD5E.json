      "summary": "Judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google will not be forced to divest its Chrome and Android platforms, but must share search data and remove exclusive contracts. The decision was welcomed by some business leaders but criticized by rivals like DuckDuckGo and Epic Games, who argue the remedies are insufficient to curb Google's monopoly power. Google’s CEO highlighted the impact of AI on search and expressed concerns about privacy and user experience under the new requirements. The ruling leaves Google free to continue its dominant position while imposing limited data‑sharing obligations.",
