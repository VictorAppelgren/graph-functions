  "title": "Mailbag: Kids on e-bikes are creating dangerous traffic situations in O.C.",
  "description": "Letters to the editor of the Daily Pilot, this week from readers in Aliso Viejo, Burbank and Huntington Beach.",
  "content": "A reader writes about kids creating \u201cdangerous traffic situations\u201d in Newport Beach while riding their e-bikes around the city. In the photo above, Huntington Beach police help kids learn e-bike safety during a training session held in May at Talbert Middle School.\n\nLast week I posted a video on Reddit of kids speeding on e-bikes, and then throwing a rock at my car on Mariner\u2019s Boulevard in Newport Beach, across from Mariner\u2019s Elementary. It was taken on Thursday, Aug. 14.\n\nI, as well as others, have complained to the Newport Beach Police Department about kids creating very dangerous traffic situations with their e-bikes. They don\u2019t seem to care. There have been several accidents this summer that could have been avoided if these kids had better parents. Something needs to be done about the situation before it gets too late.\n\nI\u2019ve spent decades traveling in Canada, and during a recent trip I was struck by how many Canadians expressed shock that Americans voted for Donald Trump. They see him as a convicted criminal, a sexual predator, and a bully who threatened to take over their country and is now using the military against U.S. cities. Many Canadians told me they will not travel here until he is out of office. That\u2019s a warning we should take seriously \u2014 tourism matters to our economy. So does maintaining our longstanding relationship with our ally to the north.\n\nIt\u2019s also a warning for Huntington Beach\u2019s MAGA-dominated city council. Trump\u2019s approval rating is sinking, yet the council continues to glorify him, even creating a MAGA-themed plaque for the Central Library\u2019s 50th anniversary. The plaque was approved last spring, but the city has not informed the public of when it will be installed. There\u2019s a rumor floating around that it will be this fall. I urge our city council to scrap that project to stop further polarization of our community. A public library is a nonpartisan institution, not a political billboard.\n\nOur city leaders should represent all of us \u2014 not just a political faction. Huntington Beach deserves better.\n\nSince December 2022, the Huntington Beach City Council majority has shown a troubling pattern of limiting public access and transparency. Item No. 14 on this week\u2019s agenda \u2014 opposing state Senate Bill 707 \u2014 is the latest example.\n\nSB 707 would require real-time remote public comment and translation services in diverse communities, removing barriers for people with disabilities, seniors, families, and residents without reliable transportation. Huntington Beach successfully offered this access until January 2023, proving its value.\n\nMayor Pat Burns claims the bill would create \u201chardships\u201d to the city and that the city has \u201cno issues\u201d with participation. In reality, requiring residents to appear in person silences many voices.\n\nOpposition to SB 707 fits a broader pattern of public engagement, for example: secret settlements, stalled projects approved without public input, appointing officials without public engagement, silence about extremist ties with anti-American militia groups, cutting public comment time, eliminating boards and commissions and restricting library materials access. These actions show a council majority working to exclude, not involve, the public.\n\nGood governance requires transparency and accountability. SB 707 strengthens democracy by ensuring meaningful participation for all. Thank you to state Sen. Buffy Wicks for championing this important bill.\n\nHuntington Beach residents deserve a government that welcomes voices, not one that shuts them out.\n\nRep. Young Kim clearly cares more about loyalty to her party than being honest with her constituents. Although she styles herself as being \u201cpro-women\u2019s health\u201d and originally promised not to support a bill that cuts Medicaid (known as \u201cMedi-Cal\u201d in Calif.), she voted \u201cyes\u201d to Trump\u2019s \u201cBig, Beautiful Bill.\u201d\n\nThis bill rips healthcare away from the most vulnerable people in her district. It \u201cdefunds\u201d Planned Parenthood by excluding it from Medi-Cal reimbursement, and severely cuts Medi-Cal funding for Orange County residents. This does not prevent federal funds from going to abortion care, since that has been illegal since 1977. But it does block access to affordable, quality STI testing, birth control, cervical cancer screenings, primary care and annual exams for 65,000 people in Orange County.\n\nDefunding Planned Parenthood is not about efficiency or fiscal responsibility. It\u2019s about punishing providers for offering care that does not align with a particular religious and political ideology. Young Kim clearly is too terrified of her own party to stand up against this anti-woman legislation \u2014 and she\u2019s so terrified of her own constituents that she hasn\u2019t held a public town hall in over two years.\n\nIf you\u2019re angry and want to make a difference, here\u2019s what you can do: \n\n \u2014 Educate your community. Most people are not aware of the dangerous provisions in the bill. Help share the facts about what defunding actually means for Planned Parenthood and Orange County. \n\n \u2014 Call Rep. Kim and demand she explain why she voted to block thousands of her constituents from accessing critical healthcare. Show up, speak up, and refuse to be silent as our rights are stripped away one law, one budget line, and one court case at a time.\n\n \u2014 Support your local Planned Parenthood. This fight is not over, but there are difficult days ahead. Planned Parenthood needs donations from our community to help them continue to fund care for patients.\n\nYou should have the freedom to decide what\u2019s best for you and your family, not Young Kim. For more information about what is happening and how you can get involved, please visit pposbc.org.\n\nPriscilla Huang\n\nAliso Viejo\n\n(Huang is a board member of the Community Action Fund of Planned Parenthood of Orange & San Bernardino Counties.)",

      "text": "(1) Existing law, the Ralph M. Brown Act, requires, with specified exceptions, that all meetings of a legislative body, as defined, of a local agency be open and public and that all persons be permitted to attend and participate.\nThis bill would, until January 1, 2030, require an eligible legislative body, as defined, to comply with additional meeting requirements, including that, except as specified, all open and public meetings include an opportunity for members of the public to attend via a 2-way telephonic service or a 2-way audiovisual platform, as defined, and that the eligible legislative body take specified actions to encourage residents to participate in public meetings, as specified.\n(2) Existing law prohibits a majority of the members of a\nlegislative body, outside a meeting authorized by the act, from using a series of communications of any kind to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item of business that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body. Existing law defines \u201cmeetings\u201d for these purposes to mean any congregation of a majority of the members of a legislative body at the same time and location, as specified, to hear, discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body. Until January 1, 2026, existing law excepts from the prohibition a member engaging in separate conversations or communications outside of a meeting with any other person using an internet-based social media platform for specified purposes, provided, among other things, that a majority of the members do not use the internet-based social media platform to discuss among themselves business of a specific nature that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative\nbody.\nThis bill would make the above-described exception related to communications on an internet-based social media platform applicable indefinitely.\n(3) Existing law requires a legislative body, prior to taking final action, to orally report a summary of a recommendation for a final action on specified forms of compensation for a local agency executive, as defined, during the open meeting in which the final action is to be taken.\nThis bill would also require the legislative body to make that oral report, as provided above, prior to taking final action on those specified forms of compensation for a department head or other similar administrative officer of the local agency.\n(4) Existing law requires a legislative body of a local agency or its designee, at least 72 hours before a regular\nmeeting, to post an agenda that meets specified requirements, including that the agenda contain a brief general description of each item of business to be transacted or discussed at the meeting, as specified.\nThis bill would require the agenda for each meeting of an eligible legislative body, as defined, to be translated into all applicable languages. The bill would define \u201capplicable languages\u201d to mean languages spoken jointly by 20% or more of the population in the city or county in which the eligible legislative body is located that, among other things, speaks English less than \u201cvery well,\u201d as specified, and except as provided.\nExisting law requires every agenda for regular meetings to provide an opportunity for members of the public to directly address the legislative body on any item of interest of the public, as specified. Existing law specifies that the agenda is not required to provide an opportunity for members of\nthe public to address the legislative body on any item that has already been considered by a committee, as specified.\nThis bill would remove the provision related to an item that has already been considered by a committee.\n(5) Existing law authorizes a legislative body of a local agency to require a copy of the act to be given to each member of the legislative body and specified persons elected to serve as a member of the legislative body, and authorizes an elected legislative body member to require a copy to be given to each member of each legislative body all or a majority of whose members are appointed by or under the authority of the elected legislative body.\nThis bill would instead require a local agency to provide a copy of the act to any person elected or appointed to serve as a member of a legislative body of the local agency.\nExisting law authorizes legislative bodies of local agencies to impose requirements upon themselves which allow greater access to their meetings than prescribed by the minimal standards set forth in the act, and authorizes an elected legislative body of a local agency to also impose those requirements on those appointed legislative bodies of the local agency of which all or a majority of the members are appointed by or under the authority of the elected legislative body.\nThis bill would remove the above-described requirement that members of an appointed legislative body of a local agency must be appointed by or under the authority of the elected legislative body of a local agency in order for the elected legislative body to impose the above-described requirements on the appointed legislative body.\n(6) Existing law authorizes a district attorney or any interested\nperson to file an action to determine the applicability of the act to past actions of the legislative body pursuant to specified provisions relating to violations of the act if specified conditions are met, including that the district attorney or interested person first submits a cease and desist letter to the clerk or secretary of the legislative body being accused of the violation, as specified, within 9 months of the alleged violation.\nThis bill would instead require that a cease and desist letter described above be submitted within 12 months of the alleged violation.\n(7) Existing law provides any person attending an open and public meeting of a legislative body of a local agency with the right to record the proceedings with an audio or visual recorder or a still or motion picture camera, as specified.\nThis bill would remove the reference to an audio or\nvisual recorder or a still or motion picture camera for purposes of recording the proceedings, as described above.\n(8) Existing law authorizes a legislative body of a local agency to use teleconferencing, as specified, and requires a legislative body of a local agency that elects to use teleconferencing to comply with specified general requirements, including that the local agency post agendas at all teleconference locations, identify each teleconference location in the notice and agenda of the meeting or proceeding, and have each teleconference location be accessible to the public. Existing law also requires that, during the teleconference, at least a quorum of the members of the legislative body participate from locations within the boundaries of the territory over which the local agency exercises jurisdiction, except as specified.\nExisting law authorizes members who are outside the jurisdiction of a\nhealth authority, as defined, that conducts a teleconferencing meeting to, notwithstanding the above-described general teleconference provisions, count towards the establishment of a quorum when participating in the teleconference if, among other things, at least 50% of the number of members that would establish a quorum are present within the boundaries of the territory over which the authority exercises jurisdiction.\nExisting law authorizes, in certain circumstances, the legislative body of a local agency to use specified alternative teleconferencing which include provisions related to, among others, notice of the means by which members of the public may access the meeting and offer public comment and identifying and including an opportunity for all persons to attend via a call-in option or an internet-based service option. Those circumstances in which the legislative body of a local agency is authorized to use the alternative teleconferencing provisions include\nspecified circumstances relating to a state of emergency, as defined, and, until January 1, 2026, subject to specified limitations, a member\u2019s need to participate remotely due to just cause, defined to include, among other things, a need related to a physical or mental disability, or emergency circumstances, as those terms are defined, if certain quorum and disclosure requirements are met.\nExisting law also authorizes certain eligible legislative bodies, including neighborhood councils and student body associations and student-run community college organizations to, until January 1, 2026, use alternate teleconferencing if, among other requirements, the city council or board of trustees, as applicable, has adopted an authorizing resolution and 2/3 of the neighborhood city council or specified student organization, as applicable, votes to use alternate teleconference\nprovisions, as specified.\nThis bill would revise and recast the above-specified teleconferencing and alternative teleconferencing provisions to uniformly apply certain noticing, disclosure, accessibility, and public commenting provisions. The bill would require a legislative body of a local agency that elects to use teleconferencing pursuant to these alternative teleconferencing provisions to comply with, in addition to any other applicable requirements under the act, specified requirements, including that the legislative body provides at least either 2-way audiovisual platform or 2-way telephonic service and a live webcasting of the meeting as a means by which the public may, among other things, remotely hear and visually observe the meeting, and that a member of the legislative body who participates in a teleconference meeting from a remote location pursuant to these alternative teleconferencing provisions and the specific provision of law that the member relied\nupon to permit their participation by teleconferencing are listed in the minutes of the meeting. The bill would require the local agency to identify and make available to legislative bodies a list of one or more meeting locations that may be available for use by the legislative bodies to conduct their meetings.\nThe bill would require a legislative body to allow a member with a disability, as defined, that precludes a member\u2019s in-person attendance at meetings of the body, as specified, to participate in any meeting of the legislative body by remote participation, as defined, except as specified. The bill would apply certain provisions relative to, among other things, quorum establishment to that circumstance.\nThe bill would instead authorize a health authority, as defined, to conduct a teleconference meeting pursuant to the above-described alternative teleconferencing provisions.\nThe bill would revise and recast the alternative teleconferencing provisions applicable in a state of emergency, as defined. The bill would also include a local emergency, as defined, as a circumstance in which a legislative body of a local agency is authorized to use the alternative teleconferencing provisions.\nThe bill would revise and recast the alternative teleconferencing provisions applicable in cases of a member\u2019s need to participate remotely due to just cause or emergency circumstances, as defined, to remove the provision applicable to emergency circumstances, to revise related definitions, including broadening the definition of just cause to include a physical or family medical emergency that prevents a member from attending in person, and to require the minutes for a meeting to identify the specific provision of law that each member relied upon to participate remotely, as specified. The bill would extend the\nauthorization to use the alternative teleconferencing provision until January 1, 2030.\nThe bill would revise and recast the alternative teleconferencing provisions applicable to neighborhood councils and student body associations and student-run community college organizations In regards to the alternative teleconferencing provisions applicable to student body associations and student-run community college organizations, the bill would exempt the California Online Community College from specified requirements for an in-person quorum, a physical location for public participation, and certain accommodations under the authorization, and remove the ability for a person with a disability that requires certain accommodations to count towards the in-person quorum requirement. The bill would specify that the California community college student body associations and student-run community college organizations described above are those in any community college recognized\nwithin the California Community Colleges system, and would extend the authorization to the Student Senate for California Community Colleges. The bill would extend the authorization to use the alternative teleconferencing provisions applicable to neighborhood councils and student body associations and student-run community college organizations until January 1, 2030.\nThe bill would, until January 1, 2030, also authorize a specified subsidiary body of local agencies to conduct a teleconference meeting pursuant to the above-described alternative teleconferencing provisions, provided that it complies with the requirements for alternative teleconferencing described above and additional requirements, including that the subsidiary body designates at least one physical meeting location within the boundaries of the legislative body that created the subsidiary body where members of the public may physically attend, observe, hear, and participate in the meeting, as\nspecified.\nThe bill would, until January 1, 2030, also authorize specified multijurisdictional bodies of local agencies to conduct a teleconference meeting pursuant to the above-described alternative teleconferencing provisions, provided that it complies with the requirements for alternative teleconferencing described above and additional requirements, including that the eligible multijurisdictional body has adopted a resolution that authorizes the multijurisdictional body to use teleconferencing at a regular meeting in open session.\nExisting law defines \u201cteleconference\u201d for purposes of the authorization for a legislative body of a local agency to use teleconferencing to mean a meeting of a legislative body, the members of which are in different locations, connected by electronic means, through either audio or video, or both.\nThis bill would specify that \u201cteleconference\u201d does not\ninclude the attendance of one or more members of a legislative body in a meeting of the body solely by watching or listening via webcasting or any other similar electronic medium that does not permit members to interactively speak, discuss, or deliberate on matters.\n(9) Existing law authorizes a special meeting to be called any time by, among other persons, the presiding officer of the legislative body of a local agency, by delivering specified written notices and posting a notice on the local agency\u2019s internet website, if the local agency has one. Existing law requires specified legislative bodies to comply with the internet website posting requirement.\nThe bill would remove the requirement that only specified legislative bodies comply with the internet website posting requirement, thereby imposing that requirement on all legislative bodies.\n(10) Existing law authorizes a legislative body of a local agency to hold an emergency meeting without complying with specified notice and posting requirements in the case of specified emergency circumstances, as specified, and imposes various requirements under these provisions applicable to either legislative bodies generally or legislative bodies which are a school board.\nThis bill would remove the school board distinction from the above-described provisions, thereby imposing the same requirements to hold an emergency meeting on all legislative bodies of local agencies.\nBy imposing additional duties on legislative bodies of local agencies, the bill would impose a state-mandated local program.\n(11) Existing law authorizes, in addition\nto other related specified authorizations, the presiding member of the legislative body conducting a meeting or their designee to remove, or cause the removal of, an individual for disrupting the meeting. Existing law defines \u201cdisrupting\u201d for these purposes to mean engaging in behavior during a meeting of a legislative body that actually disrupts, disturbs, impedes, or renders infeasible the orderly conduct of the meeting, as specified.\nThis bill would specify that a meeting for purposes of that provision includes any teleconferenced meeting. The bill would specify that the existing authority of a legislative body or its presiding officer to remove or limit participation by individuals or groups of persons who engage in behavior that actually disrupts, disturbs, impedes, or renders infeasible the orderly conduct of the meeting, as specified, applies to members of the public participating in a meeting via a 2-way telephonic service or a 2-way audiovisual platform, as\nthose terms are defined.\n(12) The bill would make other updates to references in the act.\n(13) Existing constitutional provisions require that a statute that limits the right of access to the meetings of public bodies or the writings of public officials and agencies be adopted with findings demonstrating the interest protected by the limitation and the need for protecting that interest.\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n(14) The California Constitution requires local agencies, for the purpose of ensuring public access to the meetings of public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies, to comply with a statutory enactment that amends or enacts laws relating to public records or open meetings\nand contains findings demonstrating that the enactment furthers the constitutional requirements relating to this purpose.\nThis bill would make legislative findings to that effect.\n(15) The bill would include findings that changes proposed by this bill address a matter of statewide concern rather than a municipal affair and, therefore, apply to all cities, including charter cities.\n(16) The California Constitution requires the state to reimburse local agencies and school districts for certain costs mandated by the state. Statutory provisions establish procedures for making that reimbursement.\nThis bill would provide that no reimbursement is required by this act for a specified reason."

      "text": "Millions of Californians may lose health coverage because of new Medicaid work requirements\n- Share via\n- The work requirement is the first to be imposed nationwide in the six-decade history of Medicaid, the program that provides free and subsidized health insurance to disabled and low-income Americans\n- How the rule will be rolled out is still under discussion, but one Los Angeles County health plan that serves about 2.3 million people on Medi-Cal said more than 1 million people could lose their insurance\nThe nation\u2019s first mandated work requirement for Medicaid recipients, approved by the Republican-led Congress and signed by President Trump, is expected to have a seismic effect in California.\nOne estimate from state health officials suggests that as many as 3.4 million people could lose their insurance through what Gov. Gavin Newsom calls the \u201clabyrinth of manual verification,\u201d which involves Medi-Cal recipients proving every six months that they are working, going to school or volunteering at least 80 hours per month.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be much harder to stay insured,\u201d said Martha Santana-Chin, the head of L.A. Care Health Plan, a publicly operated health plan that serves about 2.3 million Medi-Cal patients in Los Angeles County.\nShe said that as many as 1 million people, or about 20% to 40% of its members, could lose their coverage.\nThe work requirement will be the first imposed nationwide in the six-decade history of Medicaid, the program that provides free and subsidized health insurance to disabled and low-income Americans.\nIt\u2019s relatively uncharted territory, and it\u2019s not yet clear how the rules will shake out for the 5.1 million people in California who will be required to prove that they are working in order to qualify for Medi-Cal, the state\u2019s version of Medicaid.\nAfter the 2026 midterm elections, millions of healthy adults will be required to prove every six months that they meet the work requirement in order to qualify for Medicaid. The rule applies to those whose income is between 100% and 138% of the federal poverty limit, a group that became eligible for Medicaid when the program was expanded under the Affordable Care Act.\nThe new mandate spells out other exceptions, including for people who are pregnant, in addiction treatment or caring for children under 14.\nDemocrats have long argued that work requirements generally lead to eligible people losing their health insurance due to bureaucratic hurdles. Republicans say that a work requirement will encourage healthy people to get jobs and preserve Medicaid for those who truly need it.\n\u201cIf you clean that up and shore it up, you save a lot of money,\u201d said House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana. \u201cAnd you return the dignity of work to young men who need to be out working instead of playing video games all day.\u201d\nOnly three U.S. states have tried to implement work requirements for Medicaid recipients: New Hampshire, Arkansas and Georgia. One study found that in the first three months of the Arkansas program, more than 18,000 people lost health coverage.\nPeople can lose coverage a variety of ways, said Joan Alker, a Georgetown University professor who studies Medicaid. Some people hear that the rules have changed and assume they are no longer eligible. Others struggle to prove their eligibility because their income fluctuates, they are paid in cash or their jobs don\u2019t keep good payroll records. Some have problems with the technology or forms, she said, and others don\u2019t appeal their rejections.\nOf the 15 million people on Medi-Cal in California, about one-third will be required to prove they are working, the state said. Those people earn very little: less than $21,000 for a single person and less than $43,000 for a household of four.\nThe state\u2019s estimate of 3.4 million people losing coverage is a projection based on what happened in Arkansas and New Hampshire.\nBut those programs were brief, overturned by the courts and weren\u2019t \u201ca coordinated effort among the states to figure out what the best practices are,\u201d said Ryan Long, the director of congressional relations at the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative think tank that has become influential among congressional Republicans.\nLong said advancements in technology and a national emphasis on work requirements should make work verification less of a barrier. The budget bill includes $200 million in grants for states to update their systems to prepare, he said.\nArguments from liberal groups that people will lose healthcare are a \u201cstraw man argument,\u201d Long said: \u201cThey know that the public supports work requirements for these benefits, so they can\u2019t come out and say, \u2018We don\u2019t support them.\u2019\u201d\nA poll by the health research group KFF found this year that 62% of American adults support tying Medicaid eligibility to work requirements.\nThe poll also found that support for the policy drops to less than 1 in 3 people when respondents hear \u201cthat most people on Medicaid are already working and many would risk losing coverage because of the burden of proving eligibility through paperwork.\u201d\nIn June, Newsom warned that some Californians could be forced to fill out 36 pages of paperwork to keep their insurance, showing reporters an image of a stack of forms with teal and gold accents that he described as \u201can actual PDF example of the paperwork that people will have to submit to for their eligibility checks.\u201d\nMany Californians already are required to fill out that 36-page form or its online equivalent to enroll in Medi-Cal and Covered California, the state\u2019s health insurance marketplace.\nExperts say it\u2019s too soon to say what system will be used for people to prove their work eligibility, because federal guidance won\u2019t be finalized for months.\nNewsom\u2019s office directed questions to the Department of Health Care Services, which runs Medi-Cal. A spokesperson there said officials are \u201cstill reviewing the full operational impacts\u201d of the work requirements.\n\u201cThe idea that you are going to get a paper submission every six months, I\u2019m not sure people have to do that,\u201d Long said.\nGeorgia is the only state that has implemented a lasting work requirement for Medicaid. Two years ago, the state made healthcare available to people who were working at least 80 hours per month and earned less than the federal poverty limit (about $15,000 for one person or $31,200 for a household of four).\nMore than 100,000 people have applied for coverage since the program\u2019s launch in July of 2023. As of June of this year, more than 8,000 people were enrolled, according to the state\u2019s most recent data.\nThe Medicaid program has cost more than $100 million so far, and of that, $26 million was spent on health benefits and more than $20 million was allocated to marketing contracts, KFF Health News reported. Democrats in Georgia have sought an investigation into the program.\nThe Inland Empire agency that provides Medi-Cal coverage for about 1.5 million people in San Bernardino and Riverside counties estimated that 150,000 members could lose their insurance as a result of work requirements.\nJarrod McNaughton, the chief executive of the Inland Empire Health Plan, said that California\u2019s 58 counties, which administer Medi-Cal, \u201cwill be the ones at the precipice of piecing this together\u201d but haven\u2019t yet received guidance on how the eligibility process will be set up or what information people will have to provide.\nWill it be done online? Will recipients be required to fill out a piece of paper that needs to be mailed in or dropped off? \u201cWe don\u2019t really know the process yet, because all of this is so new,\u201d McNaughton said.\nIn the meantime, he said, the health plan\u2019s foundation is working to make this \u201cas least burdensome as possible,\u201d working to improve community outreach and connect people who receive Medi-Cal insurance to volunteer opportunities."
