  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nEntertainment gossip and news from Newsweek's network of contributors\n\nNot long after its Partner Showcase Nintendo Direct last week, Nintendo has once again held another presentation, this time an Indie World presentation focusing on indie games.\n\nThe August 2025 Indie World presentation featured eighteen games in all, including newly announced titles, announcements for ports of existing titles, updates to previously known games, and more. At a snappy 15 minutes long, not much time was spent on each game \u2014 but there was enough in there to get the gist of most games in the presentation.\n\nThe big hitters for the Indie World presentation were bookended at the start and the end of the presentation. The presentation kicked off with Mina the Hollower, a brand-new NES-inspired Zelda-like RPG from Shovel Knight developer Yacht Club Games, which after years of development finally got a release date in October for both Switch and Switch 2, on the same date as the previously announced PC release date. The presentation then wrapped up with a fantastic shadow drop \u2014 UFO 50, an excellent collection of 50 small games and one of the best games of 2024, is out now on Switch.\n\nWe've got all the announcements from the Nintendo Indie World presentation listed below, including release platforms, release dates, and trailers where possible.\n\nIs This Seat Taken?",
