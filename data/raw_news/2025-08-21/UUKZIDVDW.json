  "content": "RYE, N.Y., Aug. 21, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Board of Directors of The Gabelli Multimedia Trust Inc. (NYSE:GGT) (the \u201cFund\u201d) approved the continuation of its policy of paying fixed monthly cash distributions. The Board of Directors declared cash distributions as set forth below for each of October, November, and December 2025.\n\nUnder its monthly distribution policy, the Fund will continue to pay a $0.22 per share quarterly distribution, with $0.07 per share paid for each of the first two months of the quarter and $0.08 per share paid in the third month of each quarter.\n\nThe Fund previously paid quarterly distributions in accordance with a \u201cmanaged distribution policy\u201d adopted pursuant to an exemptive order granted to the Fund by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which permitted the Fund to distribute long-term capital gains more frequently than the limits provided in the Investment Company Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Fund no longer intends to rely on this exemptive relief to maintain a managed distribution policy in connection with its monthly distributions.\n\nThe Fund currently intends to make monthly cash distributions of all or a portion of its investment company taxable income (which includes ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains) to common shareholders. The Fund also intends to make annual distributions of its realized net long term capital gains, if any. The Fund, however, may make more than one capital gain distribution to avoid paying U.S. federal excise tax. A portion of each distribution may be a return of capital. Various factors will affect the level of the Fund\u2019s income. To permit the Fund to maintain more stable distributions, the Fund may from time to time distribute more or less than the entire amount of income earned in a particular period. The Fund\u2019s distribution policy may be modified from time to time by the Board as it deems appropriate, including in light of market and economic conditions and the Fund\u2019s current, expected and historical earnings and investment performance. Because the Fund\u2019s monthly distributions are subject to modification by the Board at any time and the Fund\u2019s income will fluctuate, there can be no assurance that the Fund will pay distributions at a particular rate or frequency.",
