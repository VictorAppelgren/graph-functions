  "content": "\u2022 Instagram is unveiling several new features.\n\u2022 Including a Snapchat-style map that lets you see where your friends are.\n\u2022 There's also a new way to see content your friends are interacting with.\n\nMeta has unveiled a number of changes to Instagram, all aimed at helping you better connect with your friends and their favorite content. A new location-sharing map is on the way, along with new ways to find content.\n\nMaybe the most useful feature is one taken directly from Snapchat (whose upcoming AR glasses are looking special): Instagram Map. This feature shares the last location you used the app with people you choose (followers you follow back, close friends, selected friends, or no one). You can turn this off at any time, Meta says. You can also open the map to see content from your friends.\n\nIf you're a parent of a teen account, you can control their location sharing. You'll get a notification if your teen starts sharing their location, and you can decide whether your teen has access to location sharing on the map and who your teen shares their location with.\n\nAlso: How to protect your privacy from Facebook - and what doesn't work\n\nWhether you're sharing your location or not, you can still use the map to explore content around you. You can browse stories from friends at a new restaurant, find a new hang from a popular local creator, and more. Any content with a location tagged can show up on the map, Meta explained, including Reels, posts, and stories from people you follow. These will be available for 24 hours after they're posted.\n\nInstagram Map is rolling out today. You'll find it at the top of your DM inbox.\n\nLike what your friends are liking\n\nMeta is also introducing a new Friends tab in Reels.\n\nIn this tab, you'll see public content your friends have interacted with or recommendations from Blends you've started. The Friends tab will help you see which Reels your friends are creating and engaging with, Meta says, hopefully helping you connect a little more. Friends began rolling out earlier this year, but now it's launching globally. You have control over what's shown in the Friends tab, like the ability to hide your own likes and comments on Reels and to mute activity bubbles from specific people.\n\nAlso: How to delete Facebook, Messenger, or Instagram - if you want Meta out of your life\n\nYou'll find the Friends tab at the top of Reels. Tap the \"Reels\" tab to return to your usual Reels feed.\n\nA new Repost feature lets you repost public Reels and feed posts, making it easier for you to share interests with friends. Reposts are recommended to your friends' and followers' feeds, but you can also find them in a separate tab.\n\nAlso: Facebook's new passkey support could soon let you ditch your password forever\n\nThe original poster will get credit, but content reposted by someone else might show up for that person's followers, even if those people don't follow the creator. To repost a Reel or post, tap the repost icon.\n\nYou can also add a note to your repost by typing into the thought bubble.\n\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter.",

      "text": "Today, we\u2019re launching several new ways to help you better connect with your friends on Instagram. People have always come to Instagram to share what they\u2019re up to and where they are. Now, with reposts, the map, and the \u201cFriends\u201d tab in Reels, it\u2019s easier for you and your friends to stay in touch through the content you\u2019re enjoying on Instagram.\nRepost Your Favorite Reels and Posts\nWith reposts, you can repost public reels and feed posts, making it easier for you to share your interests with your friends. Reposts will be recommended to your friends\u2019 and followers\u2019 feeds, and they\u2019ll also be in a separate tab on your profile, so you can always go back to revisit your reposts.\nReposts are credited to the original poster. If you\u2019re a creator, this means that if your content is reposted by someone else, it may be recommended to that person\u2019s followers, even if those people don\u2019t follow you. This gives creators an opportunity to reach even more people.\nTo repost a reel or post, tap the repost icon. You can also add a note to your repost by typing into the thought bubble that appears on screen and pressing save.\nConnect with Friends Using the Instagram Map\nStay up-to-date with friends with the Instagram map. You can opt in to sharing your last active location with friends you choose, and you can turn it off anytime. You can also open the map to see content your friends and favorite creators are posting from interesting or fun locations. No matter how you use the map, you and your friends have a new, lightweight way to connect with each other.\nLocation sharing is off unless you opt in. If you do share your location with friends, you have controls to customize this experience:\n- You choose who you share your location with: friends (followers you follow back), Close Friends, Only selected friends, or no one.\n- You can choose to not share location in specific places or with specific people.\n- If you use location sharing, your location is updated whenever you open the app or return to the app if it\u2019s been running in the background. You can turn off location sharing at any time.\n- If you\u2019re a parent with supervision set up for your teen, you have control over their location sharing experience on the map. You will receive a notification if your teen starts sharing their location, giving you the opportunity to have important conversations about how to safely share with friends. You can decide whether your teen has access to location sharing on the map and see who your teen is sharing their location with.\n- Learn more about sharing location.\nRegardless of whether you choose to share your location, you can use the map to explore location-based content. From checking out stories from friends who\u2019ve gone to a concert or finding a new place to hang out from a local creator\u2019s reel, there\u2019s content to help you and your friends connect with the world around you.\nAny content with a location tagged can show up on the map including:\n- Reels, posts, and stories from people you follow, available for 24 hours after it\u2019s posted\n- Notes from people you mutually follow, available for 24 hours\nYou can find the Instagram map at the top of your DM inbox. This feature is rolling out to the US today, with more global availability soon.\nFind Out What Your Friends Are Enjoying\nWe\u2019re introducing Friends, a new tab in Reels where you can see public content your friends have interacted with, or recommendations from Blends you\u2019ve started, and easily start conversations about them. Friends will help you see which reels the people you care about most are creating and engaging with. We started rolling Friends out earlier this year, and are now excited to launch it globally.\nTo access your Friends tab, tap the \u201cFriends\u201d tab at the top of Reels. To return to your usual Reels feed, tap the \u201cReels\u201d tab. We\u2019re also rolling out controls for what\u2019s shown in the Friends tab, including the ability to hide your own likes and comments on reels, and to mute activity bubbles from specific people you follow."

      "text": "Snapchat's upcoming AR glasses beat the Meta Ray-Bans in a meaningful way\nThe success of Meta Ray-Bans has helped demonstrate there's a demand for lightweight, everyday glasses packing additional tech. Snap is getting in on the action with all-new Specs AR glasses that address the biggest pain points of their predecessors.\nNext-gen Snap Specs\nAt the Augmented World Exhibition (AWE) 2025 this week, Snap announced its next-generation, AI-centered Specs. Packed into a lighter form factor and powered by Snapdragon, these Specs use advanced machine learning to understand the world around you and offer AI assistance in your everyday life. They also offer entertainment-gear AR experiences such as shared games and a portable workstation for browsing, streaming, and more.\nAlso: I tested smart glasses with built-in hearing aids for a week, and didn't want to take them off\nThe fifth generation of Spectacles was released in 2024 but was only available to developers, who could build new experiences using the glasses. Snap shares the public launch of Specs will be in 2026.\nWhen I tried the fifth-generation version myself, I was very impressed with the realistic AR experience and how well it felt anchored in the three-dimensional world around me. My biggest complaint was the sheer weight of the glasses, making this update most welcome. Beyond the hardware, the software powering the experiences -- Snap OS -- also got a myriad of upgrades.\nSnap OS with AI assistance\nIn the era of AI, AR glasses would not be considered useful unless they could also provide AI assistance. To meet that demand, Snapchat is including deep integrations with OpenAI and Google Gemini, which developers can use to build multi-modal AI-powered Lenses that the Spectacles community can access. Snap provides some examples of developer use cases, such as using AI to provide text translation, current conversion, suggest recipes, and more.\n(Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.)\nAt Google I/O last month, Google showed the public its long-awaited smart glasses, which pack Gemini assistance, in-lens displays, speakers, cameras, and mics into the form factor of traditional eyeglasses. The combination of a light form factor, multimodal AI assistance, and AR Lenses from the new Specs resembles those found on the Google smartglasses.\nAlso: I tried XR glasses that gave me a 200-inch screen to work on - and can't go back\nThe company also introduced new APIs -- Depth Module, Automated Speech Recognition, and Snap3D -- meant to help developers create meaningful experiences on Spectacles.\nWith the Depth Module API, Snap says, developers can unlock better spatial intelligence by having the API translate 2D information from large language models to accurately anchor AR information into three dimensions. The Automated Speech Recognition API offers real-time transcription with support for 40+ languages with \"high accuracy.\" Lastly, developers can easily generate 3D objects inside Lenses via the Snap3D API.\nAlso: Your Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses just got two significant upgrades for free - what they do\nSnap also launched tools to help developers build location-based experiences, including a fleet management app in which developers can monitor and manage multiple pairs of Specs in the app; guided mode, which enables developers to program the Specs to launch directly in single- or multiplayer mode; and Guided Navigation, which allows developers to build AR-guided tools. There will also soon be WebXR support in the browser for developers to build WebXR experiences.\nIf you are a developer interested in building for Specs before they launch publicly, you can sign up for the developer program.\nLooking for the next best product?

      "url": "https://www.zdnet.com/article/yes-you-need-a-firewall-on-linux-heres-why-and-which-to-use/",
      "text": "Yes, you need a firewall on Linux - here's why and which to use\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Linux is highly secure, but you should still have a firewall.\n- You should know if your ISP's hardware (gateway) uses a firewall.\n- One of the easiest Linux firewalls is UFW and its GUI sidekick, GUFW.\nI've been using Linux for nearly 30 years. Over those years, I've experienced only one security issue (a rootkit on a server I inherited). The reason for that is Linux's heightened security. Out of the box, it includes a tight permissions system and security mechanisms (such as AppArmor and SELinux) that do an amazing job of locking down the operating system.\nBut what about the firewall? You know about firewalls, especially if you've used Windows (because Microsoft's OS has always depended on them). And before you think it, no matter how secure your web browser is, it's not enough.\nAlso: Thinking about switching to Linux? 9 things you need to know\nAlmost every Linux distribution ships with a firewall that is ready to use. Oddly enough, however, some distributions ship with the firewall disabled.\nThat seems counterintuitive for an operating system that hangs its hat on security.\nThe big question you may ask is, \"Does Linux even need a firewall?\"\nBefore answering that question, I'll ask you some questions:\n- Is your Linux machine on a home network?\n- Does your home network have a router that includes a firewall?\n- Is your router regularly updated?\n- If your home network has a router with a firewall, are there any ports open?\n- Do you have sensitive data on your computer?\nYou might not know the answers to those questions, which means you might have to contact your ISP and ask them about the hardware in use. For example, AT&T Fiber does include a firewall on its gateway hardware. Comcast's Xfinity gateways also include a firewall.\nAlso: 8 things you can do with Linux that you can't do with MacOS or Windows\nIf you know your ISP hardware includes a firewall, the need for a firewall on your Linux machines is less pressing than otherwise.\nBut does that mean you should forget about the firewall?\nI say, no.\nI say, the more security, the better.\nFor example, your ISP's gateway goes without updates, which could leave it vulnerable to attacks. Some ne'er-do-well figures out what gateway you're using, breaks through its unpatched defenses, and has access to your network. If your Linux machine isn't protected via a firewall, that bad actor could access the machine through an open port and have at the data it contains.\nYou don't want that.\nErgo\u2026 firewall.\nBut which one should you use?\nDifferent distributions ship with different firewalls. For example, Ubuntu (and those based on Ubuntu) ship with Uncomplicated Firewall (UFW), whereas Fedora (and those based on Fedora) ship with firewalld. Although both are solid options, I give the nod to UFW because it's so easy to use. And if you don't want to use the command line, there are GUI apps you can install to control UFW.\nAlso: You can try Linux without ditching Windows first - here's how\nEven from the command line, UFW is easy. To enable it, issue the command:\nsudo ufw enable\nOnce enabled, all ports are closed, and accessing your machine is made exponentially more challenging. Let's say, however, that you regularly use SSH to access that machine from your LAN. For that, you could issue the command:\nsudo ufw allow ssh\nOr maybe you want to only allow SSH from a single IP address within your LAN, which can be done with:\nsudo ufw allow from IP_ADDRESS to any port 22 proto tcp\nWhere IP_ADDRESS is the address of the machine you want to allow in.\nThose same actions with Firewalld look like this:\nsudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=ssh\nOr\nsudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-source=IP_ADDRESS --zone=drop\nsudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=ssh\nsudo firewall-cmd --reload\nsudo firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=drop\nsudo firewall-cmd --list-all\nWhere IP_ADDRESS is the address of the machine you want to allow in.\nObviously, UFW is the easier tool, and I would always recommend it over firewalld for those who are just getting into Linux.\nAnd if you want a GUI for UFW, try GUFW (which can be installed from your GUI app store).\nIn the end, the answers to the questions are simple:\n- Do you need a firewall on Linux? - yes\n- Which one should you use? - UFW\nUnderstand that if you want to use UFW on Fedora-based systems, you must install it. To do that, issue the following commands:\nsudo systemctl stop firewalld\nsudo systemctl disable firewalld\nsudo dnf remove firewalld\nsudo dnf install ufw\nsudo ufw enable\nYou now have UFW running on your Fedora-based distribution.\nWith a firewall active, your Linux machine will be better protected, should someone get around the defenses of your ISP's hardware. As always, it's better to be safe than sorry.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

But that appears to be changing for some. Whether it's to get more IRL time back or because of recent controversies, more and more users are looking for the exits.\nAlso: 'How to quit Facebook?' searches spike after Meta's fact-checking ban\nIf you're ready to finally say goodbye to all-things Meta, I'll walk you through the quickest and easiest ways to delete your Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp accounts. It's not hard at all and can be done in a matter of minutes. I've detailed the steps for both iPhone and Android users, though you can do most of it from a computer if that's your preference.\nHow to delete Facebook\nWhat you'll need: To delete your Facebook account, you can use the Facebook app on your phone or do it from a computer. These instructions are for the iPhone and Android mobile apps, but the process is similar to a computer browser.\n1. Open Facebook app and go to the Menu\nOpen the Facebook app on your phone and make sure you're logged into your account. Next, head to your profile's Menu. If you're using an iPhone, tap the menu icon at the bottom-right corner of the screen. If you're on Android, tap the menu icon at the top-right corner.\n2. Navigate to Settings\nOnce you're in the Menu, go to Settings. On iPhone, scroll down, tap Settings & Privacy, and then select Settings. On Android, scroll down, tap Settings & Privacy, and then choose Settings.\n3. Find your account deletion options\nYou can now access the account deletion options in Settings and decide whether to delete your account.\nAlso: How to use Bluesky Social: Everything to know about the popular X alternative\nOn both iPhone and Android:\n- If Accounts Center is at the top of the settings menu, tap it, select Personal Details, go to Account Ownership and Control, and then tap Deactivation or Deletion.\n- If Accounts Center is at the bottom, choose Profile Access and Control and then tap Deactivation and Deletion.\n4. Complete the deletion process\nFinally, select the option to delete your account. On iPhone, tap Delete Account, then choose Continue to Account Deletion and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. On Android, follow the same steps: tap Delete Account, select Continue to Account Deletion, and finish by following the on-screen prompts.\nHow to delete Facebook Messenger\nWhat you'll need: If you've already deleted Facebook but later want to delete Messenger too, all you need is the Messenger app on your phone and your login details. The steps below work for both iPhone and Android users who have already deleted their Facebook account. Keep in mind, you can't delete your Messenger account from a computer.\n1. Open Messenger app and go to Profile\nOpen the Messenger app on your phone and log in if you're not already signed in. Then, go to your profile by tapping your profile picture in the top-left corner of the Chats tab on both iPhone and Android.\n2. Navigate to Settings\nNext, navigate to your account settings in the Messenger app. On both iPhone and Android, scroll down, tap Settings, and then select See More in Accounts Center.\nAlso: Why the TikTok ban could collapse the creator economy\n3. Find your account control options\nFrom here, access your Messenger account controls. On both iPhone and Android, tap Personal Details, then select Account Ownership and Control.\n4. Complete the deletion process\nNow you can delete your Messenger account. On both iPhone and Android, select Deactivation or Deletion, choose the account you want to delete, tap Delete Account, and follow the prompts to confirm.\nHow to delete Instagram\nWhat you'll need: To delete your Instagram account, you'll need the Instagram app on your phone and your login details.\n1. Open Instagram and go to your profile\nOpen the Instagram app and log in to your account if needed. Next, navigate to your profile by tapping your profile picture in the bottom-right corner of the screen on both iPhone and Android.\n2. Access Settings\nNow go to your account settings by tapping the Menu icon (three horizontal lines) in the top-right corner of the screen on both iPhone and Android.\n3. Navigate to account deletion settings\nYou can now access your account deletion settings. On both iPhone and Android, open Accounts Center, select Personal Details, tap Account Ownership and Control, and then choose Deactivation or Deletion.\n4. Complete the deletion process\nFrom here, select the account you want to delete, tap Delete Account, and follow the on-screen prompts to confirm on both iPhone and Android.\nHow to delete WhatsApp\nWhat you'll need: To delete WhatsApp, you need the app on your primary device, and you'll need to know your phone number.\n1. Open WhatsApp and go to Settings\nOnce you've opened and signed into the WhatsApp app on your phone, go to the Settings area to begin your account deletion process. On iPhone, tap the Settings tab located at the bottom-right corner of the screen. On Android, tap the More Options menu (three vertical dots) in the top-right corner and select Settings.\n2. Navigate to account deletion options\nNow you'll need to find the deletion options with your WhatsApp settings. On iPhone, go to Account and select Delete My Account. On Android, navigate to Account and tap Delete My Account.\nAlso: Halliday's new AI glasses are what Meta, Google, and Apple have been trying to build\n3. Provide your number\nWhatsApp requires that you enter your phone number and submit a reason for deletion. On iPhone, enter your phone number in full international format (e.g., +1 for the US), select a reason for deletion from the dropdown menu, and proceed to the next step. On Android, follow the same process: Enter your phone number in the required format, choose a reason, and continue.\n4. Confirm account deletion\nNow, to finish everything: On iPhone or Android, tap Delete My Account, and you'll complete the deletion process.\nFAQ\nDo you need to delete each Meta account separately?\nYes, unfortunately. Each of your accounts -- Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp -- must be deleted individually.\nCan you delete your Facebook and still keep Messenger?\nNo. If you want to keep Messenger, for whatever reason, you'll need to deactivate your Facebook account rather than delete it.\nDo you need a computer to delete your Meta accounts?\nYou can delete Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp directly from their respective apps on your phone. A computer is optional. However, you need the Messenger mobile app to delete your Messenger account if you've already deleted Facebook.\nAlso: Meta's latest update is a devastating blow to advertisers - what you need to know\nCan you recover your accounts after deleting them?\nNo. Once the deletion process is complete, your Meta accounts cannot be recovered. There is a grace period -- 30 days for Facebook and Instagram -- where you can log back in to cancel the deletion process, however. There is no grace period for deleting a WhatsApp account,\nWhat happens to your data after you delete your accounts?\nMeta says it retains some data for legal or operational purposes, but most of your content and personal data will be permanently deleted.\nWhat's the difference between deleting and deactivating?\nYou can deactivate Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp, if you prefer that option instead.\nEach app has its own deactivation process. But essentially, once you deactivate your account -- specifically on Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp -- your profile and all its content will be temporarily hidden. (For Messenger, deactivation is tied to your Facebook account.) You can reactivate your profiles later on either app simply by logging back into the platform.\nDeleting your account is permanent, erasing all data and making recovery impossible after a certain grace period (e.g., 30 days for Facebook and WhatsApp). Deactivation is a good choice if you want a break but think you might return later, while deletion is if you're certain about leaving for good.\nFor step-by-step guidance on deactivating or deleting accounts, see the following resources pages:"

I did the math, and here's my buying advice\nI remember when people used to scoff at refurbished tech. Buying a used phone or computer was like rolling the dice: you never knew exactly what you were getting.\nWell, the times certainly have changed. And, in this economy, the prices on refurbished tech are looking more and more tempting. Consumers are challenging this idea that we're all supposed to buy brand new phones and laptops every few years, and in the process, the market for refurbished tech has blown up.\nAlso: Should you buy a refurbished iPad? I tried one from Back Market and here's my verdict\nHaving never purchased a refurbished product myself, I was very curious as to how the experience would go with a new (used) laptop. So, I connected with the folks at Back Market and acquired a $950 MacBook Pro M1 from 2021 to test out as my main driver for a few weeks.\nI'll say right now: it wasn't a perfectly seamless experience, but buying brand new tech rarely is, either. Here's how it went, and what I've learned from the process.\nHow Back Market works\nFirst thing you should know is that the retailer offers different tiers of products: you can buy a MacBook in Fair, Good, Excellent, or Premium condition, with the prices scaling higher with better condition. If you're wondering what Fair condition looks like, it could include some visible signs of use, but ultimately, the internal parts have been inspected and verified by Back Market to be in good working order.\nAfter choosing the level of wear you're comfortable with, you then go through and choose the processor, memory amount, storage, and color of your new MacBook -- just like you would a brand new one.\nAlso: Your MacBook is getting a major upgrade for free - 5 MacOS 26 features I'm trying right now\nLastly, you can choose to include a trade-in with another device as part of the purchase. This process consists of a Back Market rep appraising your device and giving you an offer in a dollar amount. You then have 21 days to ship the item to Back Market, and once they get it, they'll cut you a rebate check.\nCan you trust a refurbished item?\nI don't blame you for being wary of used tech. But keep in mind that Back Market only takes in products it knows it can resell, and even then, it has to pass a 25-point inspection test to ensure they're in good enough condition.\nThis testing, repair, and parts replacement process is what sets a refurbished MacBook apart from a used one you'd buy straight from the hands of someone on Facebook Marketplace, for example.\nBesides a few signs of wear and tear (which you can realistically expect from a device in the Fair or Good categories), the primary thing to consider is the device's battery life. Luckily, you can see your MacBook's battery capacity in the settings, along with a host of other information, including how many cycles it's gone through.\nAlso: MacBook Pro vs. MacBook Air: How to decide which Apple laptop you should buy\nThe rule of thumb is to replace a battery that has dipped below 80% capacity, so a device purchased through Back Market should be above that mark, with Premium tier devices certified to be above 90%.\nThe MacBook Pro M1 I got from Back Market arrived in the Premium tier, so there was actually not a scratch or dent on the device at all. The screen looked flawless. The battery capacity was at 95%, and I had no issues with the keyboard or trackpad.\nThe only issue I experienced was that a day or two after I first set it up, it randomly booted up in recovery mode, prompting me to reinstall the latest OS. I did so, and it hasn't happened again since.\nHow much do you save?\nHere's the big question. How much are you really saving? Let's break it down based on three different comparable MacBook Pros from different generations: the M1 Pro I got from 2021, the M2 from 2023, and the latest MacBook Pro on the market, the M4 from 2024:\nCPU | Memory/Storage | Price | |\nMacBook Pro M1 14\" (Refurbished) | M1 Pro 10-core | 16GB, 1TB | |\nMacBook Pro M2 14\" (New) | M2 Pro 10-core | 16GB, 1TB | |\nMacBook Pro M4 14\" (New) | M4 Pro 10-core | 16GB, 1TB |\nThe refurbished M1 is not available new from most retailers, but you can still get new M2s from Amazon. As you can see, it's significantly cheaper -- over $600 less -- than the next generation up with comparable hardware. The difference between the M2 and M4, however, is smaller; just a few hundred dollars.\nIf you're wondering how they compare, CPU benchmarking results from Geekbench put the M1 and M2 10-core CPUs quite close together, with the M4 understandably a bit further off. These numbers refer to the CPU's performance limits under a heavy load, showing that the newer MacBooks have more power under the hood on the top end.\nAlso: The MacOS 26 public beta is here - How to install (and which models support it)\nBut the differences are not earth-shattering, here. When it comes to everyday tasks like working out of a browser, running productivity software, and multitasking with different apps across the latest MacOS, the difference in performance is not as easy to identify.\nAnd yes, the M1 MacBook Pro will be able to upgrade to the all-new MacOS 26 Tahoe when it comes out this fall, meaning it'll have the same operating system as newer MacBooks.\nGeekbench Single-Core CPU | Geekbench Multi-Core CPU | |\nMacBook Pro M1 14\" (Refurbished) | 2,451 | 10,983 |\nMacBook Pro M2 14\" (New) | 2,648 | 12,310 |\nMacBook Pro M4 14\" (New) | 3,742 | 14,693 |\nThe final verdict\nSo, should you buy a refurbished MacBook? If you want to enjoy the latest features like iPhone mirroring, the new and improved spotlight, and the liquid glass UI redesign in MacOS 26 and don't need the top-of-the-line processing power, then absolutely, yes.\nYou can get a refurbished MacBook Pro M1 with 16GB of unified memory for $841 less than a MacBook Pro M4 with a 10-core CPU. If you're not editing 4K video, animation, or rendering large image files, a top-tier processor might be overkill.\nAlso: How to make any MacOS app start at login - to save you time and clicks\nThat being said, by choosing a refurbished laptop, you'll want to carefully weigh the trade-offs. Make sure you're opting for enough local storage to future-proof your device, decide what kind of physical condition you're comfortable with, and make sure the device you choose has a healthy battery.\nLastly, keep in mind that Back Market is not the only place to purchase refurbished MacBooks, Apple has its own official refurbished store where you can purchase everything from MacBooks to iPads to Apple Watches."

This is made worse by summer temperatures being at record highs, with heat waves wreaking havoc across various states in the past few weeks. As someone who's gone through a few of these this summer alone, I'm constantly looking for ways to conserve energy.\nThere are many little things you can do that can shave dollars off your monthly energy bill, and they go beyond switching off the lights when you leave the room. Did you know you can save 3% on cooling costs for every 1\u00b0F increase in your thermostat? As a fan of data, I've looked into multiple quantifiable ways to save energy and how these translate into saving money.\nAlso: Apple's tariff costs and iPhone sales are soaring - how long until device prices are too?\nUnplugging a single device when not in use isn't going to save you a bucket of cash. But unplugging multiple devices adds up quickly to help you save, especially when you make a habit of it. Here are the devices you should unplug when they're not in use, and how doing so could save you almost $200 a year, depending on your local rates.\n1. TVs, gaming consoles, and office devices\nIt's easy to forget to unplug TVs that aren't in daily use, but it happens more often than you'd think. This is especially true if you have a TV in a guest room or common area that isn't often occupied. Simply unplugging your TVs when not in use could save you between $2 and $6 a year for each one. As soon as I learned this, I ran to unplug my guest room and office TV.\nSimilarly, a printer left plugged in can cost between $3 and $8 a year when idle. One can consume between 2W and 6W when not in use, adding another good savings option.\nAlso: These jobs face the highest risk of AI takeover, according to Microsoft\nA single gaming console like a PlayStation or Xbox can consume between 1.5W and 10W in standby power, which can cost up to a dollar each month for a device that is not in use. It's a good idea to unplug these devices when you'll be out of the house or overnight, just keep in mind that you may still want to leave them in rest mode so you don't miss an update.\nYou should also consider unplugging sound bars and speakers when not in use, especially in areas that don't get daily use.\n2. Coffee makers and kitchen devices\nUnfortunately, I learned the hard way that my Keurig coffeemaker was driving up my power bill. I kept my Keurig in standby mode, rather than asleep, so it was always ready to brew a cup of coffee. This can consume from 60W and 70W because it has to keep the water warm and ready. This can translate into up to $60 a year.\nAlso: This unexpected robot vacuum made me forget about my $2,000 Roborock\nSimilarly, a mini-fridge can cost you up to $130 a year to run, which doesn't always pay off if you don't need it to run all the time. I used to forget to refill my mini-fridge, so it ended up running empty for weeks, wasting between 50-100W of energy and costing me money. If you have a mini-fridge that you only use seasonally, like in your sunroom during summer months, it's best to unplug it when not in use. Doing so can save you over $10 a month on energy bills.\n3. Smart home devices that are mostly idle\nMost smart home devices are focused on improving energy efficiency, but they can also be vampire devices. Smart devices are always consuming energy because they remain connected to either the internet or another device, like a hub. However, smart devices tend to consume very low phantom loads, so you don't need to rush to unplug them all.\nSmart bulbs and plugs, though small, are always drawing a small amount of power, around 1W. This only costs you between $0.65-$1.30 a year, depending on your local rate, but it can add up if you have multiple of these devices, especially if you don't use them often.\nI have a lot of smart bulbs at home and I kill the switch on the ones that I know we won't be using un the near future. Similarly, I unplug my smart plugs when they don't have a device plugged into them.\nAlso: I let this Segway robot mow my lawn for months - here's why it's been irreplaceable for me\nA smart plug can often save you money on your energy bill. For example, if you have an older Keurig without scheduling capabilities that you'd like to have ready when you wake up, you can put a smart plug on it and schedule it to turn on just an hour a day. I also use my smart plugs to run a grow light for houseplants, a fan, and an older lamp.\n4. Older devices around your home\nMany people still have older devices plugged in that they haven't used in a long time, but either forgot or simply don't think twice about it. A single set-top cable box, DVR, or Blu-ray player can cost you up to $20 a year to power when not in use, depending on your local rates.\nLook around your home and see what is plugged in that doesn't need to be, including alarm clocks, cordless phone bases, electric kettles, hair dryers, and more. Unplugging these devices and only plugging them back in before using them can pay off, even if it's just a few dollars a month.\nFAQs\nMore tips to save on utilities this summer\nEven as the temperatures reach scorching highs, there are many ways to save on your utility bills this summer.\nHere are some things you can do to save money on your energy bills:\n- Run a fan instead of turning down the A/C: Your central air conditioner unit uses between 2,000W and 2,500W when running, while a ceiling fan, for example, uses around 50W. You can set your thermostat between 4-6 degrees higher during the warmer months and use a fan to save energy costs and the life of your A/C unit.\n- Keep the heat out: A warmer house takes more effort to cool, so you should make sure your windows are completely shut and your home is properly insulated. Closing the blinds and adding blackout curtains in some rooms can also maintain a cooler temperature throughout the day.\n- Switch to LED bulbs: I'm sure you've heard this before, but this is a fantastic way to save on your utility bill. LED bulbs use 80-90% less energy than traditional incandescent bulbs and generate less heat.\n- Learn about energy savings through your utility provider: Many providers offer opportunities to save on your energy bills, especially during peak usage days and hours. Find out if your utility provider has a savings program and what you can do to participate in it.\nWhat are vampire devices?\nYou've likely heard about unplugging common household appliances and devices when not in use to save energy. Devices that consume energy even while they're switched off are aptly called 'vampire devices,' and you may have more of them in your home than you think.\nAlso: This thermostat mistake was costing me hundreds: 3 tips to get the best temperature control\nThe US Department of Energy recommends unplugging devices when not in use to reduce phantom loads. Doing so can save you up to 10% on your energy bill, which is a pretty significant amount for such little effort.\nDoes unplugging devices actually save money?\nUnplugging devices can help you save more energy than you'd think, especially if you often forget to switch off appliances like your Keurig. Many of the devices in our homes consume power even if they're not in use, and the key to saving on your energy bills lies in compounding your potential to conserve energy.\nAs someone with a whole-home backup system that sees multiple power outages a year, I make a habit of unplugging devices to save energy. This is even more evident when the power goes out and I go through all my home's circuits using the EcoFlow Smart Home Panel. The EcoFlow app shows me the load that each circuit in my home carries at any given time, and lets me turn them off from my phone.\nAlso: I let this Segway robot mow my lawn for months - here's why it's been irreplaceable for me\nWhen the power goes out, I unplug devices that aren't essential and turn off non-critical circuits. If my home consumes 1.2kWh at any given time, I can easily halve this by unplugging devices and switching off circuits. I unplug anything from smart plugs and lamps to air purifiers and robot vacuums that don't need to be used during a power outage, and I keep my home running with only 330Wh to 600Wh to extend the life of my backup battery.\nGet the best tech tips in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "How to protect your privacy from Facebook - and what doesn't work\nFacebook has not been making friends lately with its policy changes. While some people have left, others find it hard to leave. It's where their friends and social groups -- from old co-workers to church members to fellow sufferers of obscure diseases -- are.\nAlso: The best data removal services in 2025: Delete yourself from the internet\nIn addition, Meta, Facebook's parent company, tracks your activity not just on Facebook, but across the internet with Meta's tracking pixel. If you'd rather not have Big Zucker looking over your shoulder, here's what you can do to limit how much Meta can track you.\nFacebook has been collecting data on you for years\nBefore getting into protecting your privacy, you should know what data Facebook has already been collecting data on you for years. Besides the obvious -- your name and that you liked Aunt Jodie's funny cat picture -- companies that use Facebook Business Tools, such as Facebook Pixel, the Facebook Software Development Kit (SDK), and Facebook Login and Account Kit, also share what they know about you with Facebook.\nSpecifically, Meta tracks when you're:\n- Opening an app\n- Logging into an app with Facebook\n- Viewing content\n- Searching for an item\n- Adding an item to a shopping cart\n- Making a purchase\n- Making a donation\n- When you've been naughty or nice\nOK, I made up the last one, but when you use Facebook, you really are giving up your privacy in ways that would make Santa Claus envious. Don't believe it? According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Facebook tracks you on 30% of the top 10,000 websites. On my own account, I see that Facebook and its partners have data on me from 955 apps and websites that I've used or visited in the last 180 days.\nThat includes every time I checked my Ring doorbell, the time I checked StubHub for WVU-Kansas basketball tickets, and how often I checked into Zillow when searching for a new home. And, of course, what sites I visit daily.\nAlso: What is DuckDuckGo? If you're into online privacy, try this popular Google alternative\nAlso keep in mind that things that sound like they help, such as clearing your Facebook history, may not help at all. Clearing your history, for example, doesn't delete anything. Instead, all it does is disconnect your activity history from your account. Meta will continue to receive your activity from the businesses and organizations you visit in the future.\nThe only real way out is to delete your Facebook account. But even then, Facebook says it will take up to 90 days to remove all your data. It may take longer. Much longer. In any case, Meta doesn't spell out what it does with your activity history.\nWhat doesn't work\nYou can turn off, sort of, the data Facebook and its partners share about you. But, even then, Facebook says: \"We'll still receive activity from whatever site. It may be used to measure and improve their ads, but it will be disconnected from your account.\" (You can believe Facebook if you like, but I'm inclined to doubt it.)\nNext, simply putting a post on your page that claims to be a legal notice forbidding Meta from using your personal data and photos won't help you a bit. No, I don't care who told you that this would work. It doesn't. Never has, never will.\nAlso: Stop exposing your Venmo activity - by changing this privacy setting. Here's why\nSo, what can you do? Well, first things first. Facebook has a bad habit of changing its menus. If the specific suggestions below don't work for you, use the Facebook search function to find the settings you're looking for.\nDon't share public posts - it's dangerous\nYou should be careful about what you share in the first place. If you really don't want people to know your favorite TV show is Happy Days, don't post about Richie Cunningham and The Fonz. That's a silly example, but I trust you get my point.\nAlso: Why you don't need to pay for antivirus software anymore\nRelated to this, if you're comfortable with, say, your friends knowing you won't be going to Great-Uncle Jack's fifth wedding but not the world at large, use the \"Post audience\" to restrict the people who can see your post to your friends or even more restricted groups, not the public.\nAdjust your default privacy settings for posts\nIndeed, unless you want everyone and anyone to see what you're up to, you should set your Facebook postings to always be for friends only. To do this, take the following steps:\n- Open the Facebook app or website.\n- Go to Settings & Privacy > Settings.\n- Navigate to Privacy Center.\n- Go to Common Privacy Settings.\n- Head to Manage Audience Settings.\n- Find \"Who can see your future posts?\"\n- Change this setting to \"Friends.\"\nThis ensures that all your future posts will be visible only to your friends by default.\nChange the privacy of your existing public or friends-of-friends posts\nWhat's that? You got years' worth of public posts that you'd rather not have public? Well, you can fix that too:\n- In the Privacy settings, locate Limit Past Posts.\n- Click on Limit Old Posts.\n- Confirm your choice.\nThis action will change all your past public and friends-of-friends posts to be visible only to friends.\nIt's not just Joe Random Snooper you need to worry about. Meta makes it easy for the company and its partners to use your information for anyone who uses its application programming interfaces (APIs), such as its Graph API, its Research Tools, and, of course, Facebook can use all your public data for AI at Meta.\nWhat else can you do to get Meta out of your hair?\nYou can control what you post and who sees it, but controlling what other people post about you is much harder.\nTake charge of who can tag you\nOne thing you can do, though, is take some control of the posts and images you're tagged in. To do this, take the following steps:\n- Click your profile picture in the top right of Facebook.\n- Select Settings & Privacy, then click Settings.\n- In the left column, click Profile and Tagging.\n- Click next to Review posts you're tagged in before the post appears on your profile? to turn this setting on or off.\nThis only controls, however, whether you allow their posts to show up on your profile.\nYou can (and should) also block users\nTo stop someone from tagging you at all, you need to block them using these steps:\n- Switch to the profile that you want to use.\n- Click your profile picture in the top right of Facebook.\n- Select Settings & Privacy, then click Settings.\n- In the left column, under Audience and Visibility, click Blocking.\n- In the Block Users section, click Edit.\n- Click Add to Blocked List.\n- Type the name of the profile you want to block.\n- Click Block next to their name.\n- Click Confirm.\nHow to control your Facebook apps\nFacebook apps, yes, even the FarmVille game you downloaded years ago, can spy on you. To control them and eliminate the ones you don't use, head over to Facebook's App Settings. Here, you can see the Facebook apps, games, and websites you've connected to your Facebook account. To control these, do the following:\n- Click your profile picture in the top right of Facebook.\n- Select Settings & Privacy, then click Settings.\n- Click Apps and Websites in the left side menu.\n- Scroll down to Preferences, then next to Apps, websites, and games, click Turn Off for each one.\nOr, instead of cherry-picking and disabling Facebook apps, you can choose to completely disable the Facebook app platform. This means you won't be able to use Facebook integrations on third-party apps or websites that access data through OAuth. This should cut down on the information you've been sharing with Meta.\nHow to manage your off-Facebook activity\nYou can also control how much of your information you're sharing with Meta's partners by going to the Off-Facebook Activity (OFA) page. To view this page, you may need to enter your Facebook password.\nOnce there, to see exactly what each one is up to in general terms, click on the ones you're concerned about. Since you probably have hundreds of them, I doubt you'll want to go through all of them.\nHowever, to quote Meta, \"We receive more details and activity than what appears here.\"\nRemember to turn off future activity\nFrom the Manage Your Off-Facebook Activity page, toward the bottom of the display, you can Turn off Future Activity. Again, that doesn't stop either Facebook or the company from getting your data; it just breaks, in theory, the connection between your Facebook identity and your data.\nAlso: Why you should power off your phone once a week - according to the NSA\nYou're not done yet. Head back once more to Manage Your Off-Facebook Activity. There, click on More Options in the right-hand column. Once that's done, toward the bottom of the column, you'll see a link to Manage Future Activity. Click on it, and you'll get another window with a button for, once again, Manage Future Activity.\nFrom here, you get an option: \"Your future off-Facebook activity saved with your account allows us to personalize your experience.\" If you turn this off, you'll more permanently break the connection between your account and everyone else. If you do this, you should know before doing this that you'll no longer be able to use Facebook to log into third-party websites.\nAt the end of all this, Facebook and friends will still be spying on you, but at least they'll be seeing through a dark glass instead of looking right at you.\nThe Meta-nuclear option\nIf you decide you want to get rid of Facebook once and for all, you can start by deactivating Facebook. This closes down your use of Facebook, but you can always come back to it. Unless you are absolutely sure you want to leave Facebook for good, I recommend deactivating it for a while to see if you'd miss it before deleting it forever.\nAlso: How to delete Facebook, Messenger, or Instagram\nDelete or deactivate Facebook\nYou take the same steps to do either one. These are:\n- Open the Facebook app or access Facebook through a web browser.\n- Tap or click on your profile picture in the top right corner.\n- Select Settings & Privacy, then click Settings.\n- In the left menu, click on Your Facebook Information or Accounts Center.\n- Select Personal Details under Account Settings.\n- Click on Account Ownership and Control.\n- Choose Deactivation or Deletion. If you deactivate it, you can always come back and bring it back again.\n- Select the account or profile you want to delete.\n- Click on Delete Account and then Continue.\n- You may be asked to enter your password to confirm your identity.\n- Optionally, you can select a reason for leaving Facebook.\n- Review your options, which may include downloading your information. Click Delete Account to confirm. Your account will be scheduled for permanent deletion after a 30-day grace period. During the grace period, you can log back in to cancel the deletion if you change your mind.\nThis is the only way out of Facebook that will truly protect your privacy. I know that's easier said than done, but it's the only way to be sure. Even then, however, Meta will keep its eye on you.\nMeta admits to keeping your data around for 90 days, but a recent security study found that Meta will keep all your data for 180 days. Still, it's truly your only option if you're fed up with Meta and want out. Good luck."

      "text": "Microsoft Authenticator won't manage your passwords anymore - or most passkeys\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Microsoft is a prolific supporter of using passkeys over passwords.\n- Authenticator will no longer save your passwords.\n- But Authenticator can't be your comprehensive passkey manager.\n- The Edge browser will likely fill that role one day, but it's not there yet.\nFor most of this year, Microsoft has been warning users that they will no longer be able to use its Authenticator mobile application for user ID and password management. As reported by CNET on July 29, 2025, \"In June, the company stopped letting users add passwords to Authenticator\u2026. And starting Aug. 1, you'll no longer be able to use saved passwords.\"\nAlso: How passkeys work: The complete guide to your inevitable passwordless future\nTo me, the dire warnings of this pending doomsday-like deadline are reminiscent of the run-up to January 1, 2000 -- the so-called \"Y2K problem\" -- when it was anticipated that computers everywhere would experience a meltdown because their programmers never considered the possibility that their software would still be in use in the 21st century.\nThe great passkey migration\nBut most of this reporting overlooks the bigger shift that's underway across Microsoft's identity management portfolio and, in many cases, is missing key details about the future roles of Microsoft Authenticator and the Microsoft Edge browser when it comes to another colossal shift that's currently in progress: the world's transition from passwords to passkeys.\nA passkey is unequivocally a safer credential than a password when it comes to logging into websites and apps. Passkeys cannot be guessed, the same passkey cannot be reused across different websites and apps, and you cannot be tricked into divulging your passkeys to malicious actors through techniques such as phishing, smishing, squishing, and malvertising. Even if you're strengthening user IDs and passwords with additional factors of authentication, passkeys are a better and more secure alternative.\nAlso: I replaced my Microsoft account password with a passkey - and you should, too\nIn fact, of the major technology vendors that are encouraging end-users to switch to passkeys, no vendor is pushing users to transition as hard as Microsoft is. But, at the same time that Microsoft is aggressively campaigning for that transition, we are still waiting for Microsoft to offer the comprehensive credential management capabilities that are necessary to support that future.\nManaging passwords after Authenticator\nFor users who managed their user IDs and passwords with Authenticator and want to stay with Microsoft-based solutions to manage their user IDs and passwords, their only option is to export their passwords from Microsoft Authenticator to Microsoft's Edge web browser. Once users do this, Edge will not only take over the role of managing those user IDs and passwords, it will also handle the auto-provisioning of those credentials (a.k.a. autofill) at the time of login and the synchronization of those credentials to the user's other copies of Edge.\nIn addition to Windows, Edge is available on MacOS, iOS, Android, and Linux. Given Edge's cross-platform reach when compared to that of Microsoft Authenticator (iOS and Android), it makes more sense for Edge to handle credential management and autofill.\nAlso: What if your passkey device is stolen? How to manage risk in our passwordless future\nThis approach, where Microsoft is facilitating credential management through the browser instead of a mobile application closely resembles the way Google is handling credential management and autofill through its Chrome browser. Both browsers are based on Chromium and offer users some basic password management capabilities, and both rely on a central cloud to handle credential synchronization to the same browser on other devices.\nThe problem with non-syncable passkeys\nBut, at the time this article was published, whereas Chrome's password management capabilities will auto-provision and synchronize credentials of both types (passwords and passkeys) to a user's other installations of Chrome, Edge can only synchronize passwords. According to a Microsoft spokesperson who was interviewed for this story, \"passkeys created for services like PayPal and eBay are stored as device-bound credentials in Windows and can be accessed via Windows Settings > Accounts > Passkeys. These are not stored or synced in Edge.\"\nIn other words, Edge for Windows is capable of handling and auto-provisioning passkeys during a login, but not the other versions of Edge. I confirmed this by trying to use Edge for Android to register a passkey for eBay. A lot happens behind the scenes when you register a passkey for the first time, and I explain the process in How Passkeys Work: Let's Start the Registration Process.\nAlso: 10 passkey survival tips: Prepare for your passwordless future now\nWhereas an eBay passkey registration option exists when using Edge for Windows, no such option was available to me on Edge for Android. In addition to that limitation, the eBay passkey that I was able to establish on Edge for Windows could not be synchronized to my copy of Edge for Android. This confirmed the spokesperson's statement about passkeys being \"stored as device-bound credentials in Windows.\" Device-bound passkeys are also referred to as \"non-syncable passkeys.\" As I wrote in my detailed comparison of syncable passkeys to device-bound passkeys (something that ever user should know going forward), device-bound passkeys are tied to the device that was used to create them and cannot be synchronized to another device. As it turns out, the passkey that I established through Edge running on my copy of Windows 11 was bound via Windows Hello to the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) in my HP Notebook.\nThis raises the question of where, across Microsoft's portfolio, users might be able to find support for syncable passkeys since they are by far the most convenient form of passkey to use for the websites and apps that support them. After all, the company is already supporting syncable user IDs and passwords through Edge. The last thing most users want to do is manage multiple device-bound passkeys for each website and app they use. Better to just have one, just like a password.\nYour passkey management options now\nThis is where the confusion sets in. Across most of the articles that reported on the elimination of user ID and password support in Microsoft Authenticator, the authors also noted that Authenticator would continue to support passkeys and that the user could continue to rely on Authenticator to authenticate (login) with those passkeys (see my explanation of what really happens during your 'passwordless' passkey login). It's not surprising that most of the articles said this. After all, Microsoft's own post about the changes to Authenticator very clearly states, \"Authenticator will continue to support passkeys. If you have set up Passkeys for your Microsoft Account, ensure that Authenticator remains enabled as your Passkey Provider. Disabling Authenticator will disable your passkeys.\"\nThis certainly piqued my interest. On the surface, it was strangely starting to look like Microsoft was moving all user ID and password management to Edge while at the same time fracturing passkey management across Microsoft Authenticator and Edge for Windows instead of moving full support for both syncable passwords and syncable passkeys to Edge (which is exactly how Chrome does it). So I went back to Microsoft to make sure that I understood things correctly. I apparently didn't.\nAlso: Passkeys won't be ready for primetime until Google and other companies fix this\n\"Authenticator will always continue to support device-bound passkeys for Entra accounts,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told me. \"You'll always be able to create one of those today and in the future.\" There's a lot to unpack there. Not only are Authenticator-managed passkeys also device-bound passkeys (in other words, they cannot be synchronized), the passkey support found in Authenticator is for users of Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft's cloud-based identity management solution (formerly known as Azure Active Directory) for businesses. In other words, the passkey support found in Microsoft Authenticator is not for those of us in the general user population who just want to manage their credentials. And it still lacks any synchronization capabilities.\nIn a nutshell, for those of us in the general user population who want to manage and use passkeys in addition to user IDs and passwords, Microsoft offers one option: Edge on Windows. Additionally, neither Edge for Windows nor Microsoft Authenticator (for Entra ID users) offers passkey synchronization. The only type of passkeys that Microsoft currently supports are device-bound (non-syncable) passkeys. This is obviously not ideal, and knowing some of the folks at Microsoft, I'm sure they would agree (especially given how hard the company is selling the idea of passkeys right now).\nMy conclusion as I try to take a 30,000-foot view of this situation is that when it comes to all of the different Microsoft technologies that play a role in credential management -- Windows, Windows Hello, Authenticator, Edge, Microsoft Wallet, Entra ID, passkeys, etc. -- the company has a lot of different pieces on the chessboard. Moving them all into the ideal position to support the secure credential management future it is selling is easier said than done.\nAlso: What really happens during your 'passwordless' passkey login?\nIn the same way that a chess player (and opponent) always think and anticipate a few moves ahead, it's hard not to see that at some point, sooner or later (probably sooner), Microsoft will support syncable passkeys across all its versions of Edge just like it does now with user IDs and passwords (and just like Chrome does). That is the only logical outcome given its strongly worded messages to migrate passwords from Authenticator to Edge.\nBut until that final chess move happens, users have options in the other credential management companies, including Google and all the third-party password managers (1Password, BitWarden, Dashlane, LastPass, NordPass, etc.) that support syncable passkeys and passwords in a single solution.\nStay ahead of security news with Tech Today, delivered to your inbox every morning."
