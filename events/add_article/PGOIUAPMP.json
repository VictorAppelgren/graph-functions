      "summary": "The 57th annual PDK poll shows declining confidence in public schools, with only 13% giving the nation’s schools an A or B and 43% rating local schools similarly. Support for AI in schools has fallen across all uses, while 86% favor some cellphone restriction and 40% back a full ban. Nearly two‑thirds of respondents say teacher pay is inadequate, and 66% oppose dismantling the federal Department of Education. The survey, conducted June 21‑30, 2025 with 1,005 adults, highlights strong priorities for teacher pay, shortages, security, and inclusion, with sharp partisan divides on many issues.",
