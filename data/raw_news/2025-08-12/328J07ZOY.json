  "content": "There are a few key trends to look for if we want to identify the next multi-bagger. Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Having said that, from a first glance at Tri-Mode System (M) Berhad (KLSE:TRIMODE) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.\n\nTrump has pledged to \"unleash\" American oil and gas and these 15 US stocks have developments that are poised to benefit.\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Tri-Mode System (M) Berhad is:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.028 = RM4.4m \u00f7 (RM173m - RM17m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2025).\n\nSo, Tri-Mode System (M) Berhad has an ROCE of 2.8%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Logistics industry average of 4.0%.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Tri-Mode System (M) Berhad\n\nHistorical performance is a great place to start when researching a stock so above you can see the gauge for Tri-Mode System (M) Berhad's ROCE against it's prior returns. If you want to delve into the historical earnings , check out these free graphs detailing revenue and cash flow performance of Tri-Mode System (M) Berhad.\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nIn terms of Tri-Mode System (M) Berhad's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. Around five years ago the returns on capital were 3.5%, but since then they've fallen to 2.8%. However, given capital employed and revenue have both increased it appears that the business is currently pursuing growth, at the consequence of short term returns. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.\n\nOur Take On Tri-Mode System (M) Berhad's ROCE\n\nWhile returns have fallen for Tri-Mode System (M) Berhad in recent times, we're encouraged to see that sales are growing and that the business is reinvesting in its operations. These growth trends haven't led to growth returns though, since the stock has fallen 24% over the last five years. As a result, we'd recommend researching this stock further to uncover what other fundamentals of the business can show us.",

The declaration of a \"national energy emergency\" further empowers these companies by prioritizing pipeline and storage projects to support increased production from newly accessible federal lands and waters. \u2013 \u2013 The push to \"unleash American energy\" also amplifies demand for midstream services as upstream production ramps up, particularly in regions like Alaska and offshore areas reopened for drilling.

The stock has fallen 24% over the past five years, suggesting that further research into its fundamentals is necessary.",
