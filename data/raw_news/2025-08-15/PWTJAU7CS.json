  "content": "Amazon Vs Harbor Freight: Which Has The Better Budget Tools? (According To Reviews)\n\nTools are an essential part of life for most people working in the trades, as well as for DIYers, hobbyists, and home improvement enthusiasts. That includes everything from standard hand tools \u2014 like screwdrivers, hammers, and pliers \u2014 to power tools and more specialized devices for niche jobs and applications. Having access to a well-rounded tool kit can make the difference between completing jobs efficiently and on time and struggling with a project for hours or days. The problem is that tools, especially high-quality ones, can be quite costly. While professionals may have no issue investing in high-dollar products, DIYers and hobbyists may struggle to build their collection. Fortunately, there are various ways to build a solid tool kit on a budget, including shopping for cheaper, more entry-level products. When it comes to affordable tools, there are various places you can look. However, two of the most popular destinations include Harbor Freight and Amazon. Harbor Freight is immensely famous in the world of tradespeople and DIYers, thanks to its massive inventory of affordably-priced tools, which range in quality from low budget devices to those that can compete with big-name brands. Amazon, on the other hand, is known for its vast online marketplace and rapid shipping times. Regarding budget tools, we wanted to see which store offers the best value. So, we compared a handful of popular devices, and we looked into what actual customers had to say about these products. While Amazon does sell name-brand tools, for the purposes of this article, we chose to compare its line of Amazon Basics products to similar items sold at Harbor Freight. We'll take a look at popular hand tools and power tools, as well as the warranties offered by each company. Here's what you need to know.\n\nBetween the two companies, Harbor Freight's hand tool inventory is significantly larger than the Amazon Basics lineup. Amazon does sell a huge number of hand tools built by various brands. However, only a handful of its products come with the Amazon Basics label, meaning that if you're specifically looking for Amazon Basics products, you will be somewhat limited in your options. Regarding price, Harbor Freight beats Amazon Basics for some products. For example, you can buy a Pittsburgh 70-Piece Comfort Grip Screwdriver Set from Harbor Freight for $29.99 normally. The Amazon Basics 12-Piece Magnetic Screwdriver Set, on the other hand, costs $15.28. Harbor Freight also sells a non-magnetized 12-piece set for $7.99, while Amazon does not offer any additional sets of screwdrivers under the Amazon Basics brand. However, for other products, Amazon does come out on top in terms of price. An Amazon Basics 123-Piece Mechanic's Tool Socket Set costs $53.99, while Harbor Freight does not sell any socket and ratchet sets in that price range that come with a similar number of tools. As far as reviews go, both Harbor Freight and Amazon Basics products tend to have mostly positive ratings. The Pittsburgh screwdriver set described above features 4.8 out of five stars based on 1,169 customer reviews, while the Amazon Basics set comes with 4.6 out of five stars based on over 1,300 reviews. The same applies to the socket sets, with a Harbor Freight Pittsburgh 64-piece kit boasting 4.6 out of five stars based on 1,500 reviews and the Amazon Basics set coming with 4.7 out of five stars based on nearly 12,000 user ratings.\n\nWhen it comes to power tools, Harbor Freight is the clear winner in most regards. While Amazon does sell a vast number of power tools, few of those products come with the Amazon Basics brand. One of the only power tools we found in the Amazon Basics store is the Amazon Basics cordless screwdriver. The base model \u2013the 4V Cordless Stick Screwdriver \u2013 which comes with a 10-piece bit set and a charging cable, costs $22.47. In comparison, Harbor Freight sells the Bauer 4V Cordless \u00bc-inch Screwdriver, which comes with four bits and a charging cable, for $19.99. Both tools offer similar power levels and feature an integrated LED worklight. However, in terms of customer ratings, the Bauer model comes out on top with 4.6 out of five stars based on over 2,000 user reviews, while the Amazon Basics tool features 4.4 out of five stars based on just shy of 2,500 reviews. The only other type of power tool that we could find in the Amazon Basics store is an Amazon Basics Wet Dry Vacuum Cleaner, available for $59.98. The brand does sell a handful of other standard vacuum cleaners, but those products aren't typically considered power tools like drills and reciprocating saws. The Amazon Basics shop vacuum is a 4-gallon model with three horsepower and an 8-foot power cable. In comparison, Harbor Freight sells a Bauer 6-Gallon Wet/Dry Vacuum for $54.99. It offers four peak horsepower and comes with a 10-foot power cable. Both products are well-rated, but the Bauer model comes out ahead with 4.7 out of five stars based on nearly 3,500 customer reviews, while the Amazon Basics vacuum has 4.5 out of five stars based on 1,777 reviews.\n\nBoth Harbor Freight and Amazon Basics tools all come with some form of guarantee. For Amazon Basics products, it's a flat one-year limited warranty. This warranty covers manufacturer's defects and damage unrelated to accidents, improper use, neglect, or accidents caused by things like fires, floods, and unauthorized repairs or modifications. If you claim the warranty on an Amazon Basics tool and the company determines that your request is legitimate, Amazon will either replace your device with a new or refurbished model that is the same or similar to your original product, or it will refund the purchase price of the tool, provided that you send the product back with all of its original accessories. Amazon goes on to state that there is no guarantee that the replacement tool it sends you will be exactly the same or provide the same features as the original product. Furthermore, if you take advantage of the Amazon Basics tool warranty, Amazon will only cover the replacement item for the remainder of the original tool's warranty or 90 days, whichever is longer. In comparison, Harbor Freight offers a couple of different tool warranties, depending on the type of product you purchase. (Keep in mind, that hand tools come with a limited lifetime warranty). The company states that if at any point during the tool's lifetime it fails or experiences damage due to a manufacturer's defect, Harbor Freight will replace the tool with an identical item or one that is \"substantially similar.\" Warranty limitations include things like misuse, user-caused accidents, and neglect. Harbor Freight power tools, on the other hand, come with a limited 90-day warranty, during which the company will replace the tool or refund your purchase price if damage is a result of manufacturer's defects and not caused by user error or negligence.",

      "text": "5 Tips For Building A Professional Tool Kit On A Budget\nBuilding a solid tool collection can take a lot of time and money, especially if you're only just getting started in a career. While home improvement enthusiasts and DIYers can get by with less expensive and lower-quality tools, professionals require high-quality equipment that won't break or fail after several months of daily use. That often means forking over big bucks for professional-tier tools. Furthermore, many professions, like auto repair, HVAC, or electrical work, require workers to have not only high-quality, durable tools but also a vast selection of equipment to handle innumerable situations and repair jobs. All of those factors can make it extremely challenging for new workers just starting out in an industry.\nFortunately, there are some methods you can use to build your toolbox on a budget. First of all, most of the best professional-level tool manufacturers provide lifetime warranties on their products without requiring a receipt of the original purchase. That means you can hunt for bargains on used tools without worrying about expired warranties. Second, it's important to purchase high-quality tools when you're a pro, but that doesn't mean all of your tools must come from an expensive name brand. Often, you can get by just fine with a cheaper economy option. So, from searching local pawn shops to shopping off-brand, here are five tips to help you build a professional tool kit on a budget.\nCheck your local pawn shops\nPawn shops don't always have the best reputations. But that doesn't mean that pawn shops can't be helpful. In fact, pawn shops are one of the best places to search for quality, used tools. Because tools, especially name-brand tools, can be so expensive, many retired workers or those in a financial pinch choose to sell their equipment to pawn shops for quick and easy cash. Many pawn shops have entire sections dedicated to tool displays and buckets upon buckets of loose tools, like sockets, wrenches, and screwdrivers. While many of the highest-quality and most expensive tools will end up behind glass, you can often discover name-brand sockets or wrenches that slipped through the shop's system in the buckets of cheap, loose tools.\nWhen you visit a pawn shop to search for tools, look specifically for professional-level name brands like Snap-On, Matco, and Cornwell. Most of the tools produced by these companies come with lifetime warranties, and you don't need a receipt to cash in on those promises. You can frequently find name-brand tools in pawn shops for a fraction of the price you'll pay off the tool truck. Then, if you happen to break an item while working, you can contact your local representative or franchisee for a replacement free of charge.\nShop garage and estate sales\nGarage and estate sales are another fantastic way to hunt for tool bargains. You're less likely to encounter individual tools and more likely to find entire collections up for grabs at these sales. Estate sales, in particular, are an excellent way to find older tools. You may discover a collection that took decades to build, filled with obscure equipment and unique devices. Even better, estate sale organizers don't always understand the actual value of high-quality tools, meaning you may be able to find expensive items at extremely low prices.\nGarage sales are more likely to yield lower-quality, less expensive tools. But that's not always the case, and spending a few hours each weekend perusing local garage sales is a great way to find some diamonds in the rough. These sales are also wonderful places to search for tool storage options. You may encounter a toolbox well under its retail price, or you may find a random Snap-On ratchet buried in a box of junk. Again, hunting for name-brand tools is a solid plan, as the manufacturers will almost always honor their warranties, even if you didn't buy the tool yourself when it was new.\nBrowse classified ads\nChecking out the local classified ads in your area is another great way to find tool deals. Sites like Craigslist, Facebook Marketplace, and local newspaper websites can be excellent resources for finding low-cost tools. When you search classified ads for tools, you're less likely to find fantastic deals on individual items. Generally, the seller will be a retired worker or someone who understands the value of the tools they're selling. That means the best way to find tool bargains in classified ads is to look for someone selling entire collections. While you may not find extreme deals on individual tools, it's common to discover sellers offering tool collections for a flat sum that can translate to hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in savings. This is a great way to buy name-brand tools and toolboxes, and it can be a wonderful way for a beginner to acquire an extensive collection of quality equipment quickly.\nWhen shopping classified ads, it's vital that you take a couple of precautionary steps. Only meet in safe, public locations with adequate lighting. Remember to thoroughly inspect the items for damage or flaws before handing over the cash, and always ask for a bill of sale or a receipt.\nSkip the brand name\nWe've covered a few ways to buy pro-tier tools on a budget. But it's also wise to remember that not every tool in your collection needs to come from an expensive name brand. Sometimes, a Harbor Freight find will do the job perfectly and provide years of quality service. It's important to understand when you should purchase name-brand and when you can get away with an economy option. For things like hammers, pry bars, and breaker bars, there isn't a lot of real difference between budget and professional-level brands.\nYou may also consider purchasing entry-level, economy versions of the most expensive tools you'll need, like pneumatic devices. For example, you can pick up a cheap impact wrench from Harbor Freight for hundreds of dollars less than you'd spend on the Snap-On truck. These devices are excellent for beginners and those just starting their careers. Even though Harbor Freight tools are of undeniably lower quality than professional tools, they can still get the job done without sacrificing too much power. Purchasing one or two entry-level tools from Harbor Freight allows you to concentrate on buying other items off the tool trucks or from a professional brand. You could buy one $600 Snap-On air gun. Or you could buy a $150 tool from Harbor Freight and use your savings to purchase a wrench or socket set off the truck. Buying the cheap, entry-level tool will allow you to slowly build your kit, purchasing smaller items each week or month until you're ready to drop big bucks on the pro-level pneumatic device.\nShop the sales\nShopping the sales may seem like an obvious suggestion. But it's worth mentioning for a couple of reasons. One, sales are relatively common these days, and you typically don't have to wait too long to see one pop up on your favorite brand's website.\nMore important, however, is the fact that tool truck brands like Snap-On, Matco, and Cornwell usually rely on franchise owners to sell their products. The person who shows up each week in the Matco truck outside your local mechanic's shop is most likely an independent Matco franchise owner. That means these sellers can create their own promotions and sales. Forming a relationship with these vendors is important if you plan on buying name-brand tools. Ask them about upcoming promotions and what kind of deals they plan to offer. Many of these sellers even offer interest-free payment plans to help workers build their kits.\nEven if you don't work at a shop, finding a tool truck in your area is not too hard. You can contact individual companies to ask about reps in your neighborhood, or you can visit local repair shops to ask when the tool trucks generally stop by. Then, swing by yourself and ask about any deals or promotions the vendor is currently offering or planning to offer in the future."

      "text": "How Does Harbor Freight's Lifetime Warranty Work And Which Tools Come With It?\nHarbor Freight is known for being a tool store with quality products at an affordable price, especially compared to the other larger home improvement stores like Home Depot and Lowes. In fact, because the sold brands are owned by Harbor Freight, the company has the right to dictate policies to help not only themselves but the customers as well. For example, on all Harbor Freight Tools, you have 90 days to return an item for either a full refund or exchange. Other stores usually only give you a month.\nIn terms of a warranty, most items have a 90-day warranty. On top of that, for some tools, like power tools, Harbor Freight gives you the chance to purchase an extended warranty, which is useful if you plan to use the tool frequently. Additionally, the tool store also has another warranty \u2014 a lifetime warranty. With that said, how does Harbor Freight's lifetime warranty work and exactly which tools does it apply to?\nHow does Harbor Freight's lifetime warranty work?\nThe lifetime warranty works the same as the 90-day warranty \u2014 the only difference being the time limit of the warranty from the date of purchase. However, the warranty is on more than just the tool itself. If needed, whoever enacts the warranty must be the original purchaser. To use the warranty, you'll need to show the receipt, the defective item, and an explanation of what is wrong with the item. We'd suggest either keeping the receipt in a safe place or uploading it to your computer, so you'll always have it. Additionally, if you are part of Harbor Freight's Inside Track Club Membership, the store keeps track of your purchases.\nIt's important to understand that the lifetime warranty has limitations. When you present your tool to the store, they will do an inspection. If it is determined that there is a defect or that it has failed to work as it should, your item will be replaced with either the same tool or a substitute if the identical tool is not available. However, if it is determined that the item is broken due to user misuse or if the user modified the tool at all, the company reserves the right to deny the warranty and the replacement. With that said, we suggest following Harbor Freight's guidelines and using your tools properly, so you won't have to cover the costs of a new tool if needed in the future.\nWhich tools are included in the lifetime warranty?\nOn Harbor Freight's customer service page, the lifetime warranty states that it covers hand tools. However, upon further research, we discovered it's not all hand tools. On Harbor Freight's main page under the Shop tab, you'll find a list of hand tools. We wanted to check under the different hand tool options and see if the lifetime warranty pertained to all of them. Under hand saw and cutting tools, looking at the Portland Saw 12-inch Flush Cut Saw, which is technically a hand tool, it is listed under Harbor Freight's 90-day return policy and warranty. However, within the same tab of hand saw and cutting tools, the Pittsburgh 42-inch Bolt Cutters is protected under the lifetime warranty.\nThere's truly no explanation as to why some Harbor Freight hand tools are not covered under the lifetime warranty and others are. Your standard hand tools like ratchets and tape measures as well as accessories like sockets and tool sets like the Quinn socket sets are all under the lifetime warranty. Before purchasing, we suggest looking at the product page of the tool and checking out the warranty information section to get a definite answer for your tool's protection plan."

      "text": "10 Harbor Freight Hand Tools Every DIYer Will Wish They Had Sooner\nHand tools are slower, more physically demanding, and sometimes even harder to use than their powered brethren. Every major tool brand produces them, yet so many DIYers focus most of their attention on power alternatives. Even so, there's something special about chiseling out a recess or retooling a screw thread under the power of your own hands. And while power tools are wonderful additions to the toolbox, there are occasions where they just can't provide the precision oomph necessary. Fastening a delicate screw, measuring a precision cutline, or tearing out old fasteners to reclaim a board often demand a hand tool that's tailored specifically to the task.\nUnfortunately, these specialty demands often require a tool that might not already be in your toolbox. It's these occasions when DIYers wish they'd rounded out their collection a bit sooner. Fortunately, Harbor Freight carries a wide range of tools, including some pretty essential hand implements. From specialty hammers to workpiece cutting tools, these Harbor Freight offerings are staples in both vintage and modern DIY workbenches. Whether you're trying to improve your home or garden, once you bring these 10 hand tools into your collection, you'll wonder why you didn't invest in these unique and versatile instruments sooner.\nCentral Machinery 5-1/2-Inch Reversible Bench Vise\nThe bench vise is a versatile tool that elevates everything a woodworker, home welder, machinist, or hobby DIYer can accomplish. No matter what kinds of projects you plan on tackling around the home or in your garage setup, a bench vise is one of the first things you should invest in \u2014 seriously! The vise might not seem like an essential piece of equipment; it can't screw or hammer a fastener into place, and it doesn't have the ability to move around the workspace with you. This leads some 'early career' DIYers to discount the value of a tool that doesn't feel very tool-like on the surface.\nHowever, a bench vise provides a crucial extra set of hands. When grinding a metal piece or even replacing the grip on a golf club, the immobility that a vise brings to the table is irreplaceable. Vises come in a range of sizes and styles, though, so it can be difficult to find one that suits your particular needs. Harbor Freight offers a well-rounded choice in the Central Machinery 5-1/2-Inch Reversible Bench Vise. Retailing for $130, the Central Machinery vise is large enough to capture work measuring up to 7-3/4 inches in the reversed position. The jaws provide nearly 5,000 pounds of clamping force, and the vise's body swivels on a 360-degree axis for full rotation around the corner of your workbench \u2014 for lengthways grabbing or short sided piece holding to keep the jaws out of your way. The vise includes an anvil, too, allowing for routine striking operation when necessary.\nCentral Forge Mattock Pick with Fiberglass Handle\nAn in-store only product that requires you to visit your local Harbor Freight, the Central Forge Mattock Pick (finished off with a fiberglass handle) is one tool that brings huge versatility to your DIY project slate. Coming in at under $50, this Harbor Freight find (listed at $27) is a must-have tool for anyone who frequents the landscaping around their home on a Saturday afternoon. The mattock is an age-old hand tool that brings two landscaping tools into one striking head. A mattock can feature a pick or quasi-axe head on the reverse side, with a sharpened hoe blade on the front. These tools are crucially important when digging trenches for flower beds, aerating stubborn ground that needs tilling for a new season of planting \u2014 or when resodding a lawn, for instance \u2014 or chopping down a tree by hand. The side-oriented blade allows a DIYer to deliver ground level blows to the stump, removing it from the bottom entirely one the tree's aerial growth has been felled.\nA forged and heat-treated steel blade combined with a 6-plus pound overall package make for a physically powerful striking tool that still brings nuance and precision to the cultivation tasks around your home. Rounding out the mattock pick is a fiberglass handle. Using fiberglass reduces vibration significantly over a wooden alternative and makes for a long lasting handle that will virtually never need replacing. Fiberglass handles are typically lighter, as well, providing better swing control and precise striking action for a more efficient cutting or digging operation.\nPittsburgh 3-lb. Neon Orange Dead Blow Hammer\nThe dead blow hammer is a perfect fit for a variety of DIYers, such as fine woodworkers and home mechanics who need a specialty tool. As the name might imply, the hammer delivers a deadened blow due to the shot found within the hammer's mallet construction. Rather than a solid hammer with material spread evenly throughout the face, a dead blow hammer is more or less hollow. Inside the body, these hammers are filled with metal pellets, sand, or other loose material that move as the hammer is swung. During a strike, the shot is pushed toward the rear end of the hammer, and as the tool makes contact, the shot falls down to the \"face\" end to effectively dampen the elasticity of the strike. This creates a deadened inertia that makes the hammer immensely efficient at striking delicate parts, attacking tight spaces, and removing stuck components that need a massive hit to dislodge.\nThe Pittsburgh 3-lb. Neon Orange Dead Blow Hammer costs just $11 and is the perfect tool for woodworkers, auto mechanics, and any other DIYer looking to add versatile striking capabilities to their toolbox. This dead blow hammer is heavy enough to provide quality striking force while providing a non-marring strike head so that users can swing away at delicate parts, metal components, or soft or hard woods without worrying about sparking, surface damage, or marking the workpiece. The steel core handle makes for a durable hammer that will last a very long time, and the bright orange outer coating allows for an easily distinguishable tool.\nDoyle 15-Inch High Performance Adjustable Wrench\nAn adjustable wrench might seem like an oddity on a list of tools that DIYers and home improvers wouldn't already have. Yet, it's the specifics of the Doyle 15-Inch High Performance Adjustable Wrench that sets it apart and makes it something unique to add to the work bench. First of all, the Doyle wrench, retailing at $30 from Harbor Freight, is precision machined for butter-smooth operation through the adjustment knob. Laser etching offers precise size markings along the face for a dialed in grip that won't fail with the help of non-slip jaws that adjust out to a maximum capacity of 1-3/4 inches.\nBells and whistles aside, the real star of the show in this adjustable wrench is its length. While many DIYers will have a basic set of sockets, wrenches, and ratchets, length is a big deal and can really make or break a project when the going gets tough. The typical set won't include extra long bars or wrench arms that are simply necessary when dealing with particularly troublesome bolts and other workpieces. A 15-inch wrench is fairly non-standard, providing a happy medium in price, torque production, and usability that bridges the gap between standard and non-standard torque needs. While longer wrenches exist, a 15-inch variant is the perfect option for a DIYer looking to bring in more power while maintaining their ability to get into tight spaces and avoid carting around an impressively heavy hand tool.\nFasten-Pro Hammer Tacker\nA hammer tacker is the evolution in staple guns that DIYers often don't know that they need. A stapler is a common find in the toolbox of DIYers across the country, and yet anyone using a standard stapler is missing out on a major upgrade that will truly elevate their ability to get into tight spaces, quickly fasten material, and generally find more enjoyment in their projects. The hammer tacker is a fast fastening stapler that showcases a more streamlined body than your grandfather's staple gun and can deliver staples at a much faster pace. The Fasten-Pro Hammer Tacker at Harbor Freight costs just $15, as well, meaning this major improvement to your DIY workflow doesn't have to be a major expense.\nThe all-steel frame of the Fasten-Pro tool is hard wearing and will stand up to a wide range of job conditions and demands. The comfort grip handle at the tail end of the tool helps make the work less strenuous, too. All manner of stapling needs can be accomplished at a rapid pace with a hammer tacker, from carpet underlay installation to weed barrier placement within raised garden beds. The transition to a hammer tacker is one that many won't have already completed, but once you make the switch, you'll wonder how you didn't come across the hammer tacker much sooner.\nPittsburgh 60-Piece SAE and Metric Tap and Die Set\nThe ability to cut a new thread in a seated bolt or any other workpiece that will receive a fastener is a crucial competency that many DIYers overlook. The task doesn't feature prominently in a lot of DIY work, but those who understand how to use a tap and die set cherish their tool, especially when the time comes to consider a large part replacement versus a simple recut operation. The Pittsburgh SAE and Metric Tap and Die Set is a 60-piece affair that comes in a sturdy carrying case for longevity and can perform virtually and rethreading you might face off against in your home improvement work, automotive revamp, or machine shop hobby craft.\nThe many tap tools in the set offer a plethora of size options for rethreading a hole that will accept a fastener, while the dies littered throughout the case's molded holders are used to recut the threads on a fastener that will be seated in a screw hole. The set features both imperial and metric measurements for cutting power that can tackle just about any job you'll find. The ability to rethread an integrated component on a larger workpiece is paramount for a DIYer looking to tackle jobs on their own while keeping costs low. The tools are precision ground with alloy steel builds that have been heat treated and hardened for a hard wearing tool set that will stand up to any job you might find around the house.\nCentral Forge No. 4 Jack and Mini Plane Set (2-Piece)\nA hand plane is a tool that every woodworker will want in their collection. Hand planes are time-honored tools that bring an angled cutting blade into precise contact with a wooden workpiece to shave off segments to create a flat surface. As a woodworker or DIYer glides the plane over a wooden surface, the tool draws down on high spots and takes a smooth shaving of extra material to lower it down to the same height as the lower areas that surround it. These tools feature an angle iron, chip breaker, frog, and of course, the cast iron or steel body that provides the pane with its angular and iconic form.\nThe Central Forge Hand Plane Two-Piece Set, featuring a No. 4 Jack Plane and a Mini Plane offers all the smoothing power you need to tackle door installation, precision shaving needs on surfaces that require flat edges, and more. The Jack Plane is perfect for standard smoothing requirements and provides a solid cutting surface that's wide enough to quickly tackle large areas. The Mini Plane is a one handed shaver that's ideal for knocking down sharp edges and finishing off the precision wood shaving needs to perfect a surface's edge with exacting standards. At $18 for the pair of planes, Harbor Freight's offering is more than valuable. The Jack Plane features a cast iron body for heavy smoothing work while the Mini Plane is made with a stamped steel body for lightweight finish planing.\nPittsburgh 10-Inch Multi-Purpose Pry Bar (AKA the Cat's Paw)\nThe cat's paw is a humble yet widely applicable hand tool. It features a pull arm and claw that replace the nail-pulling power of a standard claw hammer, but it offers much greater functionality and precision in this task. The Honest Carpenter consistently raves about the value of a cat's paw, naming it \"one of the most useful demolition tools ever made.\" Pittsburgh's 10-Inch Multipurpose Pry Bar is perhaps the most valuable iteration of the cat's paw available in nearly any storefront, online or in person. At $4, the pry bar is a true steal of a deal. The steel construction ensures long-lasting pulling power that won't fail you when tackling any manner of fasteners, facing, or molding removal needs.\nThe bar offers an angled nail puller on one end that won't mar surfaces in the same way that a claw hammer is wont to do. This gives a DIYer better pulling power with the help of a lengthy steel bar without worrying about chipping, marking, denting, or otherwise damaging the underlying surface around or beneath the fastener in question. On the other end of the tool, the cat's paw delivers a flat pry bar blade that's excellent for getting into molding, facing, or wainscoting and can be used to remove a range of material, also without delivering collateral damage to the surrounding areas.\nDoyle 7-Inch Professional Rafter Square (Speed Square)\nAn essential tool for welders, woodworkers, and construction pros alike, the speed square is a simple looking tool with a massively potent design dripping with features and functionality. The Doyle 7-Inch Professional Rafter Square is an immaculate example of this form. At $11, the speed square sits right in the middle of smaller bodied squares (4- or 5-inch varieties for trim work and smaller jobs) and the larger 12- or 24-inch units that are in demand on some professional jobsites. A 7-inch rafter square is perfect for marking out right angles on boards, or measuring intermediate distances across the workpiece ahead of ripping the board down to size. These speed squares are instrumental in finding precision angles across a board's face or marking out a line at a precise measurement (in quarter inches on the Doyle model) with the help of continuous scribe notches.\nThe speed square features laser-etched markings for long-lasting measurement capabilities on an anodized aluminum frame for excellent corrosion resistance, lightweight functionality, and major durability from one application to the next across many years of use. A speed square, as the name implies, can massively ramp up the pace at which you mark out boards and make cuts when performing DIY projects of all sorts. It's a crucial tool that every DIYer should have in their toolbox.\nPittsburgh 6-Inch Digital Caliper with SAE and Metric Fractional Readings\nPittsburgh's 6-Inch Digital Caliper with SAE and Metric Fractional Readings offers excellent value and immense precision in measurement. Having a set of calipers is crucial when it comes to delicate DIY work. While precise measurements might not matter all that much when building a basic workbench for your shed or drilling holes for new wiring that will hide behind a faceplate, other applications demand critical accuracy at all times. When measuring for a woodworking project, for instance, you might find that you need to cut with millimeter precision to make interlocking parts in a dovetail joint fit. Finding replacements for dowels or bolts is also far easier when working with a caliper rather than eyeballing the size. Pittsburgh's digital caliper offers both analog measurements printed along the steel body's length and a digital readout that's easy to see and precise down to within 0.001 inch (0.03 millimeters).\nThe caliper extends out to a 6-inch reading and offers reversible jaws for both interior dimension measurements and exterior measurement capabilities, and it can also perform step measurements. A digital caliper is one of those tools that you'll always find a use for after you buy one. The Pittsburgh caliper is available in store only, but it will be shipping with online orders by October 7, 2024. The caliper comes with a carrying case to protect the tool and costs $23."
