  "description": "Netflix\u2019s tvOS app just rolled out a big redesign, here are the details on the new look for Apple TV 4K users.",
  "content": "One of the most popular tvOS apps is debuting a brand new look: Netflix\u2019s previously announced redesign of its Apple TV app is rolling out now.\n\nNew design for Netflix tvOS app now available\n\nBack in May, Netflix announced a variety of big changes that were coming to its iOS and tvOS apps.\n\nNow, the newly updated Netflix app for Apple TV users is here.\n\nAs spotted by users on Reddit, the new design seems to have launched with the latest tvOS app update. If you\u2019re not seeing it yet, make sure you\u2019re running the latest version of the Netflix app.\n\nHere are several features of the new design, per the original announcement:\n\u2022 Discover Your Next Great Watch More Easily: We\u2019re putting all the information you need to make an informed choice about what to watch front and center. That way you can better focus on what makes each title relevant for you, with callouts like \u201cEmmy Award Winner\u201d or \u201c#1 in TV Shows.\u201d\n\u2022 More Visible Shortcuts: Until now, shortcuts to Search and My List were somewhat hidden on the left-hand side. We\u2019re moving them to the top of the page where they\u2019re more noticeable and easier to access.\n\u2022 Better Realtime Recommendations: We\u2019re making the recommendations on the homepage more responsive to your moods and interests in the moment.\n\u2022 Elevated Design: The new homepage has a clean and modern design that better reflects the elevated experience you\u2019ve come to expect on Netflix.\n\nIf you\u2019re a regular user of Apple\u2019s own TV app, you\u2019ll notice some commonalities between it and Netflix\u2014especially compared to Apple\u2019s tvOS 26 redesign.\n\nMost obvious is the similar navigation menu at the top of the screen. Apple\u2019s TV app has long used a similar-style navigation bar.\n\nNow the Apple TV and Netflix apps\u2014easily my two most-used tvOS apps\u2014will feel more cohesive.\n\nWhat do you think of Netflix\u2019s new tvOS app design? Let us know in the comments.\n\u2022 AirPods Pro 2 (now only $169, down from $249)",

Please reload the page.\n- Reviewed in the United States on December 3, 2024Style: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseI\u2019ve tried several hearing aid substitutes over the years, my past favorite being the now unavailable Bose Hearphones and costing $500. Rather than just a sound amplifier, these had several functions allowing you to filter and focus sounds in various ways and for various situations. They were pretty good.\nBut now Apple has added some great features to their AirPods 2\u2014features that function like far more expensive hearing aids and at less than half the price of the Bose product. I\u2019ve owned these for a month or so and am now just getting the hang of how to use them. If there is a downside to these earbuds it is the rather deep and confusing tech included in them (or, at least confusing for a grandfatherly type like me). Once they are Bluetooth connected to your iPhone (They connect very easily with the button on the front of the EarPod\u2019s charging case.) they should automatically connect every time you put them in your ears. You will then be able to access all the functions by tapping the \u201csettings\u201d app on your phone. You will find a heading near the top of the list just below the box with your name and iCloud options. Tapping on this will allow you to drill down through several pages of options. There are a lot of options there and it can be confusing, but experimenting with the various functions will help you figure out their purpose.\nThe key here is to drill down to find the hearing test. This will quickly test for hearing loss by leading you through a series of tones of varying in pitch and volume. The end result will be an audiogram that can be used to program your EarPods as hearing aids. As stated before, it took me several weeks to find and activate this feature, but when I did a whole new experience dawned. Just be patient and search around for this function. It works very well.\nOf course, these things also serve as EarPods to listen to music or podcasts. (May I recommend \u201cPat Gray Unleashed!\u201d if your bent is conservative commentary and just plain fooling around). The quality of sound is phenomenal and the buds are more comfortable than most to keep in your ears for an extended time. To control the volume for this function you can TRY to use the external control buttons located on those silly looking stems that hang out of your ears (good luck) OR just open the \u201cControl Center\u201d page (slide one finger upward on your iPhone screen to access this page) where you\u2019ll find the volume slider. If your EarPods are connected and in your ears you\u2019ll see the slider is marked as controlling the AirPods.\nI really like these things now that I\u2019m a little more familiar with them. The quality and value are exquisite. If I discover more, I\u2019ll edit this comment.\n4 MONTHS LATER: Apple has improved the controls for these in their latest iOS update. The functions I had to dig around to find are now more easily accessed. Getting to the hearing test is now fairly straight forward.\n- Reviewed in the United States on July 27, 2025Style: Without AppleCare+Verified PurchaseThe AirPods Pro 2.0 earbuds are very close to perfection. I have four pairs. Two with the lightning connectors, and two with the now standard USB-C connectors. My USB-C pairs have the Mag-Lock charging as well. The sound is awesome! There are earbuds with more bass and higher volumes. But I believe for recreating quality live sound the Airpods produce clear sound that rivals listening to live music. They put out a reasonable amount of bass. I don\u2019t honestly think that folks will be satisfied if you want ear shattering bass. The vocals are crisp. The battery life is pretty darn good too! Even the first pair that I purchased in 2023 still runs for at least 4.5 hours playing music. If the Airpods are totally dead, they\u2019re recharged in about an hour. With the different sized silicone eartips, they will comfortably fit in most ears. Plus when they wear out, you can purchase replacements on Apple\u2019s store, or right here on Amazon. I think one of the best features is the sound dampening ability. I usually have this feature on. I believe that even with no music playing the Airpods cut noise down by at least 50%-70%. You can have the microphones set to when you start talking, they let sounds through. I think the microphones are of wonderful quality. The clarity is really good. It is very rare that someone says they\u2019re having a hard time hearing me. About the only negative is they are susceptible to interference from other devices every once in awhile. This is more prevalent in the summer than in the cooler months. They are discounted now to $169.00! This is much better than paying $249 or even $199. These are the best cordless earbuds I have ever purchased. I would definitely recommend these Airpods Pro 2.0 for the value they are.

YMMV\u2026 So, for those of us crusty old codgers with beat up ears, here's an interesting discovery I made today:\nI (unsurprisingly) listen to a lot of stuff while working out in my shop. And as a DOACA (\"Dude of a Certain Age\") who worked as a roadie & stage tech in the age of Grunge, I have pretty pronounced tinnitus, so I'm doubly careful about my hearing when using some of my larger shop tools, like my cabinet saw, mill, etc, which means I'm often putting hearing protection on, and taking it off repeatedly. I have a decent \"bone conduction\" headset that allows for environmental awareness, but the protectors don't work with those on. I have tried a few wireless earbuds (most recently the well reviewed certain-Lab \u201cMini\u201ds) but there was some problem or other with all of them (the Minis sound great, but have terrible connectivity).\nSo I finally sucked it up and got a set of Apple AirPod Pro 2s (yeah, mostly after hearing Adam Savage rave about them in a recent video you can easily find.) An interesting thing about them is that Apple actually worked with the US FDA (for those of you not in America, that's the federal agency that regulates medical devices here in the States\u2014you need to be certified by them to make any medical claims about a product or device) and got these to be certified as Class II hearing aids in the US and Canada. And in addition to a clinical-grade hearing test feature included that runs in the app, the Hearing Aid feature is easy to employ, and actually useful. But that's not what has me so jazzed about these.\nAside from the Bluetooth being rather astounding (my wife took my phone to the other end of the house about 40' away, with our chimney stack between us, and stuck it in her sock drawer\u2014totally fine), the noise cancellation is *shockingly* good. And this is where things get interesting, and where we get back around to my tinnitus.\nPutting these in my ears this morning while sitting in my dining area, next to our furnace closet with the HVAC running, the ANC immediately kicked in. And even with no music or sound playing, the furnace noise (I'd guess about ~50dB) just... *disappeared*. I literally had to take them out and put them back in a few times to see if I was going a bit bonkers. But not only did that sound disappear, but my tinnitus\u2014a group of between five and seven tones of various frequencies between 4kHz - 8/9kHz that has a perceived volume of about 40dB all the time\u2014suddenly had its volume \"turned down\" by about 10-15dB.\nIt was rather startling.\nI've heard those tones from the age of 17 on (I'm now 57). Incessantly. Unforgivingly. Perpetually.\nFor them to get quieter was pretty amazing.\nI suspect that the Active Noise Cancellation is at play here. If you're not aware, AirPods have microphones built into them. The main, obvious ones, are the little sticks that come off them outside your ears that listen to the environment around them. But there is a second set of microphones that detect the sounds *inside your ear canal when the buds are in them* that are likely the heroes here. The buds take both of those sound profiles (technically, it's *four* sound signatures\u2014two for each ear) and then uses machine learning combined with Apple's H2 chip to create \"anti-noise.\"\nNow, anti-noise is nothing new: I mean, *that's how ANC works*. It's also nothing new to tinnitus sufferers, either. \"Noise generators\" have been around for decades. There are even apps available that allow you to pump white, gray, pink, brown, or other noise \"colors,\" or other environmental sounds (ocean waves, rain, fireplace crackling, etc) into your ears -via- buds throughout the day to \"mask\" tinnitus. Many people have decent luck with this kind of tinnitus self-treatment\u2014I never have.\nI suspect that it's the inner microphones (Apple is one of a handful of current makers that have this) that are really helping to effectively mask the sound that gets past the bud seals, combined with (love 'em or hate 'em) Apple's crazy level of R&D that gets these buds to analyze not only the environmental noise profile *outside* the buds, but the sound that *gets past the buds*. This winds up being a broader noise profile, so the buds generate a broader palate of anti-noise, and then puts it *right in your ear*.\nNow to be clear, I can still hear my tinnitus tones. They're just less present in the... what? *\"auditory mix\"* in my head. But boy oh boy is the change noticeable. At least for now. It may be that in time my ears get used to the trick. But as of right now? I'm fine with being fooled.\nIt may be that other buds with ANC also do this, but I can't speak to any other solutions except the comparison to my -Labs. I get nothing if you buy these or any other buds. This is just my experience, but as someone who's lived with this affliction for so long, ANY positive change is important enough for me to take time, write down, and share my experience. YMMV.\nIf you have tinnitus, or hearing problems (or suspect you might) these are a serious consideration."

Please reload the page.\n- Reviewed in the United States on December 19, 2022Color: Premium Black Apple TV MountVerified PurchaseIn the garage I have a TV on a wall mount and AppleTV as the sole source for content. I wanted to mount the AppleTV on the back of the TV for the minimalist option. I found the TotalMount when searching Amazon and it looked like it would fit the bill. I was concerned about which generation of AppleTV would fit as many of the mounts you will find on Amazon only work for the older mount. What was not obviously, but welcome surprise, is the TotalMount is completely compatible with both generations as it includes an \u201cinsert\u201d that adapts the smaller newest generation to the mount.\nGood:\n1. Mount works with all generations of AppleTV 4K.\n2. Mount includes a large piece of high quality double sided tape already cut to fit and installed. Pro tip: use a heat gun or hair dryer to warm up both the tape and surface for the best possible adhesion.\n3. Extremely easy and fast installation, no instructions required.\nBad:\n1. One of the more expensive AppleTV mounting options, but I think the quality, construction, and compatibility justify the price.\n2. The mount does not hold the AppleTV in all directions. Basically only one supported orientation which is vertical wall mount with cords either pointing up or down. Mounting the AppleTV horizontally on the ceiling or even horizontally on a vertical wall will not work. You could experiment with taping the AppleTV into the unit to hold it in these other orientations.\n5.0 out of 5 starsIn the garage I have a TV on a wall mount and AppleTV as the sole source for content.

However, it's not ideal for older Apple TV models, and the vent mounting option is limited.

      "text": "Today Netflix unveiled a big overhaul to its tvOS app, and a couple experimental features coming to iOS too. The new features are rolling out soon, here are all the details.\nNetflix\u2019s tvOS app getting big redesign, iOS testing TikTok-style feed\nNetflix has just revealed a \u201cnew Netflix TV experience\u201d that will be rolling out globally in the coming weeks and months.\nHere are four changes coming to the tvOS app, per Netflix\u2019s announcement post:\n- Discover Your Next Great Watch More Easily: We\u2019re putting all the information you need to make an informed choice about what to watch front and center. That way you can better focus on what makes each title relevant for you, with callouts like \u201cEmmy Award Winner\u201d or \u201c#1 in TV Shows.\u201d\n- More Visible Shortcuts: Until now, shortcuts to Search and My List were somewhat hidden on the left-hand side. We\u2019re moving them to the top of the page where they\u2019re more noticeable and easier to access.\n- Better Realtime Recommendations: We\u2019re making the recommendations on the homepage more responsive to your moods and interests in the moment.\n- Elevated Design: The new homepage has a clean and modern design that better reflects the elevated experience you\u2019ve come to expect on Netflix.\nThe new app design looks fresh yet familiar. And much of the UI seems especially well suited for tvOS.\nFor example, the \u2018More Visible Shortcuts\u2019 feature puts a navigation menu right at the top of the screen, just like Apple\u2019s own TV app.\nThough you won\u2019t see as many titles onscreen at once, I also like the idea of getting to see more information about a title when you hover over it, as it expands to reveal a summary and more.\ntvOS isn\u2019t the only platform getting updated though.\nNetflix also announced two new features coming to iOS:\n- TikTok-style vertical discover feed\n- Search powered by Generative AI\nThese two features aren\u2019t rolling out globally just yet. The search upgrade will launch as a small opt-in beta, while the TikTok-like vertical feed is only a test for now.\nWhat do you think of Netflix\u2019s new app changes on tvOS and iOS? Let us know in the comments.\nBest Apple TV 4K accessories\n- AirPods Pro 2 (now only $169, down from $249)\n- Anti-slip silicone case for Siri Remote, AirTag compatible\n- TotalMount for mounting Apple TV\n- iPhone Continuity Camera mount for Apple TV\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

      "text": "Liquid Glass is the theme of Apple\u2019s big cross-platform redesign this year. The new design is coming to Apple\u2019s TV app too in iOS 26 and tvOS 26, joined by some other UI updates. Here\u2019s what\u2019s new.\nApple TV app getting Liquid Glass, new theatrical poster art, more changes in iOS 26\nApple\u2019s TV app has undoubtedly gotten more use this year than ever before, driven by Apple TV+ having its best year to date.\nThis fall, just in time for returning Apple TV+ hits like Slow Horses and The Morning Show, there are several TV app design changes coming with iOS 26 and tvOS 26.\nDesign changes include:\n- New poster art\n- More content on-screen at once\n- Refreshed app icon\n- Liquid Glass buttons and menus\n- Redesigned player controls\nThroughout the updated TV app, you\u2019ll see new vertical poster art replacing the old artwork design. The updated, more \u2018theatrical\u2019 design comes with functional improvements too.\nThanks to the new look, more shows and movies will be displayed on-screen at once in iOS 26 and tvOS 26. Content density has improved quite a bit.\nThe TV app also has a refreshed app icon, and Liquid Glass is used for certain UI elements such as the iOS tab bar.\nOne of the biggest beneficiaries of Liquid Glass is the video player controls.\nWhen you\u2019re watching a show or movie, the new transparent controls ensure you don\u2019t miss any content when they\u2019re on-screen.\nInstead, the Liquid Glass controls float above your video without obstructing what\u2019s happening underneath.\nWhat do you think of the design update for Apple\u2019s TV app in iOS 26 and tvOS 26?
