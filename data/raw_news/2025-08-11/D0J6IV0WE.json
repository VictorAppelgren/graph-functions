  "title": "'Armed And Dangerous' Murder Suspect's Car Found In LA County, Suspect At Large",
  "description": "The Washington man, believed to be in LA County, is wanted in connection with a double stabbing and served time for a machete attack.",
  "content": "Alexander Lee Rogers, 51, of Longview, Washington is wanted in connection with the murder of Dawn Peters, 64, and the attempted murder of Andrew Peters, 73, according to the Longview Police Department. Authorities previously said Rogers, who is considered armed and dangerous, was likely still in Washington. But on Monday afternoon, authorities in Los Angeles County said Rogers may now be in the Southland.\n\nHis car was found parked on the 23000 block of Calabasas Road, just off the 101 Freeway near Mulholland Drive and Valley Circle Boulevard, according to the Malibu/Lost Hills Sheriff's Station. \"The suspect may still be in the surrounding area,\" deputies said. \"If you see the suspect, call 9-1-1, do not approach or attempt to contact the suspect.\"\n\nDawn and Andrew Peters were found stabbed in a home in the southwestern Washington city at around noon on Aug. 5, KIRO reported. Rogers was publicly named as the suspect the next day.\n\n\"It's really important for us that the public knows this guy is dangerous. He's shown a propensity for violence. We believe he's likely to commit violence again,\" Longview police Capt. Brandon McNew told the station last week.\n\nHe got out of prison 10 months ago after serving over two decades for burglary and assault charges. The sentence stemmed from a 2002 incident in which Rogers attacked two people with a machete and stole one of their cars, KGW reported. After Rogers was named as the suspect in last week's murder, Longview police shared photos of him captured the day the Peters were found stabbed, authorities said. The photos were captured by police body cameras during an unrelated interaction earlier that morning outside a grocery store, according to Longview police. Rogers is described as a 6-foot-2-inch-tall man weighing 190 pounds. He was believed to be traveling in a partially spray-painted black BMW with Washington license plate BNU8712, police said.",
