  "title": "Vogue Magazine's Publishing Ads With AI Models\u2014And That's a Huge Problem",
  "description": "That's a bold strategy, let's see how it turns out for them.",
  "content": "When readers opened the latest issue of Vogue magazine, sporting Anne Hathaway on the cover, they were in for a nasty surprise\u2014AI-generated fashion models. This quickly led to severe public backlash. But when the storm's blown over, what does this mean for the future?\n\nWhile Vogue didn't directly include these models itself, this can be seen as a way to test the waters for various interested parties, and how we as the public react might have heavy implications for the fashion industry.\n\nWhat happened in the case of Vogue is that a series of advertisements by Guess were clocked as AI-generated by readers, and some felt strongly enough about this to cancel their subscriptions, according to The Daily Dot.\n\nWhile Vogue's parent company Cond\u00e9 Nast told CNN that an AI model had never appeared in the magazine \"editorially\", that's beside the point. The magazine and its owners obviously have a say in what adverts run. If Vogue had run a racist or sexist advertisement, it would be ridiculous to say in defense they'd never published racist or sexist content \"editorially\", and so, in my opinion, the buck stops with the magazine itself.\n\nThe ads themselves seem to be the product of a company called Seraphinne Vallora, which is \"the world's leading AI marketing agency for fashion and luxury.\" It's that company's entire raison d'\u00eatre, so it hardly seems like an experiment at this stage.\n\nThe Business Case for AI Is Clear\n\nSo, why even use an AI-generated model in a fashion campaign? The business case is pretty clear in my opinion:\n\u2022 The models never age, never complain, and will do literally anything you say.\n\u2022 You don't need to spend a bunch of money on venues, photographers, food, and all the other stuff that usually goes into a fashion shoot.\n\u2022 The turnaround times are much, much faster.\n\nClearly, an agency that specializes in AI fashion ads is pretty good at making their AI models wear the real products that the client provides, and, honestly, looking at the example above, I'm guessing most people didn't even realize these were AI-generated until someone brought it up. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the reason this came to the fore wasn't through some obvious issue with the images.\n\nInstead, Vogue's readership is one that's interested in fashion for its own sake, and by extension have an interest in the people involved in the industry. So as soon as someone wondered \"who's that model?\" and looked them up, they'd find that there was no model to begin with!\n\nUsing AI Models Misses the Point of Modeling\n\nUsing made-up people to advertise real products isn't a great idea in any industry, but when it comes to clothing, makeup, and self-expression, it makes zero sense. People are looking for a human connection, and perhaps a way to see themselves in the model and a specific lifestyle. When we read books, or look at pictures, or absorb any media, it's both a \"bottom up\" and \"top down\" process. In other words, your knowledge and perceptions alter how you see these media.\n\nSo just the mere fact that you know you're not looking at a real person can devalue and diminish both the product that's being waved before your nose, and your perception of fashion and artistry itself. There has been plenty of controversy in the past about using software like Photoshop to touch up models in magazines. Why did the people behind this think replacing the entire model would somehow be less of an issue?\n\nVogue Could Be Playing With Fire\n\nTo even attempt this as a test shows some pretty poor judgment on the part of Vogue magazine, and the potential reputational damage definitely isn't worth it, if you ask me. While there are plenty of sensible and appropriate uses of AI-generated imagery (and I use it myself all the time), this is one specific industry where people value authenticity and take an interest in the people behind the fashion (like models, designers, and photographers).\n\nFrom that perspective, I think Vogue will learn a hard lesson from this, although who knows whether the effects of that lesson will change things in the long term? Usually, I'd think that the average person doesn't care too much how their entertainment is made, so it won't matter that much in the long run. However, people who are in the fashion industry don't just care about the final product, they have a vested interest in the humans behind the final product.\n\nWhen you have a world where someone cares about the story behind the photo, who wants to know what someone eats, or what their skin routine is, there's nothing mroe jarring than realizing there's no \"someone\" at all. I don't think that's going to fly, Vogue.",

      "text": "Vogue\u2019s August 2025 issue, starring Anne Hathaway on the cover, has ignited a heated debate because of its use of AI-generated models. While some may see it as a step toward innovation, many readers feel Vogue has crossed a line. The inclusion of AI-generated \u201cmodels\u201d has led to subscription cancellations and criticism online.\nAI in couture: Vogue\u2019s digital dilemma\nInside the glossy pages, AI-generated figures pose in high-end couture against stylized backdrops, bearing flawless complexions and idealized proportions. Each image comes with a disclaimer stating it was \u201cproduced with artificial intelligence,\u201d alongside full designer credits. Yet, that transparency hasn\u2019t soothed concerns, as these advertisements have taken away jobs from models, makeup artists, photographers, and more.\nCritics argue the pristine visuals lack soul. Although the models wear real fashion from top labels, many say the images resemble luxury video game renders more than genuine editorials. While supporters claim AI offers faster production and cleaner visuals, detractors believe it sacrifices emotional depth and the artistry that human models bring.\nThis isn\u2019t Vogue\u2019s first brush with controversy, but the shift toward digital \u201cperfection\u201d arrives at a time when consumers increasingly crave authenticity. The overwhelming response from long-time readers suggests this particular fusion of fashion and technology has backfired.\nFashion fans react with displeasure\nSocial media lit up with frustration as readers voiced disapproval of the digitally enhanced imagery. For them, swapping human models for code undermines the dedication models put into their craft.\nOne person tweeted, \u201cHad to end the Vogue magazine subscription I\u2019ve had for years because the latest magazine used AI models ??? In Vogue? AI models in Vogue?\u201d\nA mother shared a more personal story, writing, \u201cTrue story: my Gen Z daughter is all about analog. She subscribes to @voguemagazine and gets the physical copy in the mail. New issue shows up. She\u2019s flipping through, stops, and says, \u2018Some of these models are AI.\u2019 I say maybe it\u2019s bad Photoshop. She\u2019s like, \u2018Nope. It\u2019s definitely AI. I\u2019m canceling.\u2019\u201d\nShe went on to add that her daughter doesn\u2019t care that the images were for ads, and not editorial pieces. \u201cAdvertisers think Gen Z is hooked on AI and won\u2019t care. But some of them do. AI isn\u2019t always a flex. Sometimes it\u2019s the reason they bounce.\u201d\nFashion fans aren\u2019t just reacting emotionally, they\u2019re calling out a deeper concern about the future of representation and authenticity in the industry. Although AI models are gaining traction, they risk alienating the very audiences brands hope to engage.\nThe internet is chaotic\u2014but we\u2019ll break it down for you in one daily email.

      "text": "American Vogue\u2019s August 2025 issue has been making headlines \u2014 and not only for its cover featuring actor Anne Hathaway, who is back in the limelight as she films \u201cThe Devil Wears Prada\u201d sequel. What has drawn much \u2014 if not more \u2014 attention can be found in the pages of the magazine: advertisements for the Californian clothing company Guess.\nAt a cursory glance, nothing appears unusual: A Caucasian woman with wavy blonde hair, flushed cheeks and perfect teeth, bared in a wide smile, shows off a long stripe dress with a matching top-handle bag. In another image, she models a floral playsuit with a drawstring that cinches her waist.\nYet, in small print on the page, it is revealed that the model was created using artificial intelligence. The campaign was developed by Seraphinne Vallora, a London-based AI-driven marketing agency, whose work has also been featured in titles including Elle, The Wall Street Journal and Harper\u2019s Bazaar. The discourse around the AI photos was ignited by TikTok user @lala4an, whose video on the Guess ad has since been viewed more than 2.7 million times.\nThe revelation that AI models were inside the pages of Vogue sparked debate over what it might mean for real-life models pushing for greater representation and diversity, and consumers \u2014 particularly younger people \u2014 who often face unrealistic expectations of beauty.\n\u201cIt\u2019s insane because it\u2019s not like we\u2019re short on people looking for modeling gigs or anything,\u201d wrote one user on TikTok in a comment that, to date, has over 67,700 likes. \u201cSo first normal women are comparing themselves to edited models\u2026 Now we have to compare ourselves to women that don\u2019t even exist???\u201d wrote another.\nSeveral people have since called for a boycott against Guess and Vogue. Guess did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. While the Guess campaign was a commercial decision, it would have still required internal approval at Vogue to be printed. A Cond\u00e9 Nast spokesperson confirmed to CNN that an AI model has never appeared editorially in Vogue. Though, digitally created models have featured in international editions of the title: Vogue Singapore previously showcased AI-generated avatars in its March 2023 issue. (Vogue Singapore is a licensee and not owned or operated by Cond\u00e9 Nast.)\n\u2018We still hire models\u2019\nValentina Gonzalez and Andreea Petrescu, the 25-year-old co-founders of Seraphinne Vallora, believe the outrage behind the Guess campaign is misplaced. Speaking to CNN on a video call, Petrescu explained that \u201cpeople think these images just came to be by AI, which is not true. We have a team, and we also still hire models.\u201d\nGonzalez and Petrescu were approached by Guess co-founder Paul Marciano to create AI models for the brand, they said. After reviewing multiple drafts, Marciano picked a digitally created blonde (Vivienne) and brunette (Anastasia) for further development. Both ended up being featured in Guess\u2019 ads, which appeared in Vogue and other magazines, Gonzalez said (though it was only Vivienne who went viral).\nTo create the campaign, Seraphinne Vallora employed a real model, who, over the course of a week, was photographed in the studio wearing Guess clothing. That informed how the clothes looked on an AI model, said Gonzalez. \u201cWe needed to see what poses would flatter the product most, and how it looked on a real woman. We cannot generate an image if we don\u2019t have an informed idea of what positions will be the most flattering.\u201d\nAsked why brands wouldn\u2019t simply use a real model in their ads, Petrescu argued that AI gave clients greater choice and efficiency, by requiring less time and smaller budgets to execute than a typical marketing campaign.\nSeraphinne Vallora was initially founded as a jewelry label before pivoting into providing AI-led marketing services, Petrescu explained. \u201cWe realized that to sell this jewelry, we had to put a lot of good content out there that attracted people. But we didn\u2019t have budgets at the time to hire real people to be the face of our brand, so we tried to make our own model.\u201d\nAs architecture graduates, both Petrescu and Gonzalez were well versed in photography, drawing and digital media, so they turned to AI to create a model that would tout their products online. The results, according to Petrescu, were positive. \u201cWe had millions of views on our Instagram Reels and tens of thousands of likes on some posts,\u201d she said.\nThe novelty of an AI model has appealed to many, added Gonzalez. \u201cThe reason it went viral was because people were like, \u2018oh my god, is she real?\u2019\u201d\nLack of diversity\nGuess is not the only brand to have used AI models. Last July, Mango introduced its first AI-generated campaign to promote clothing for teenage girls. In one image, a young woman is wearing a colorful co-ord set. While the garments shown were real and available to purchase, the model was entirely AI generated. In March 2023, Levi\u2019s said that it would begin testing AI-generated models to ensure more diverse body types and skin tones in its marketing.\nThose launches were also met with criticism, with some seeing the AI creation of a model \u2014 especially a person of color \u2014 as a way for companies to profit from the appearance of diversity without having to invest in it, while also potentially pushing professional models out of their jobs in the process. Others feared the move would also negatively impact the livelihoods of photographers, makeup artists and other creatives traditionally involved in creating a campaign.\nIn an October 2024 interview with Bloomberg, Mango\u2019s CEO Toni Ruiz justified the use of AI models, saying that advertising could be created more quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s about faster content creation,\u201d he said. Mango did not reply to CNN\u2019s request for comment.\nLevi\u2019s responded to criticism at the time of its announcement, clarifying that it was not \u201ca means to advance diversity\u201d and the company remained committed to working with diverse models. The brand added it would not scale back live photoshoots with models.\nNoticeably, the AI models shared by Seraphinne Vallora on its Instagram are largely white and have conventionally attractive features, such as luscious hair, a fit body and facial symmetry, which align with widely held societal standards of beauty.\nAsked why there isn\u2019t greater diversity among Seraphinne Vallora\u2019s AI models, Petrescu said there were no technical limitations, but they simply followed directions from clients. She added that on testing a variety of models, they \u201csaw what works best with the public. We saw what people responded to.\u201d The varied responses to their AI models have been considerable, said Gonzalez, with likes on a single Instagram post ranging from a few hundred going up to tens of thousands. \u201cTo create an AI model, it takes time, so we want to make sure that people engage with it,\u201d Gonzalez noted.\nFor Sara Ziff, who started work as a model in New York at age 14 and is the founder and executive director of the non-profit organization Model Alliance, the concerns around AI are not unfounded. As the technology becomes more widely adopted, Ziff argued that brands and creators must consider \u201chow it can best be rolled out and how it can be used responsibly,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to ask who\u2019s getting paid, who\u2019s getting seen and who gets erased.\u201d\nA future with digital doubles\nThe rise of AI models is not worlds apart from virtual influencers, who are already overlapping with real-life ones. Digital avatars such as Lil Miquela and Shudu have large followings on social media and wear clothing from luxury brands like Prada, Dior and Calvin Klein. Neither digital model is Caucasian, and both have at least one white creator (Shudu was created by British visual artist Cameron-James Wilson and Miquela by Los Angeles-based creatives Trevor McFedries and Sara DeCou).\nNot all AI creations are entirely fictional, either. In March, H&M said that it would create AI \u201ctwins\u201d of 30 real-life models, with the intention of using them in advertising campaigns and social media posts. As part of the agreement, each model would own the rights to their twin, meaning they can book multiple photoshoots with brands (including H&M\u2019s competitors) and, in that sense, be in more than one place at once. The first images, using AI-made photos of models, were released this month.\nIn a statement provided to CNN, H&M\u2019s chief creative officer J\u00f6rgen Andersson said the company would not change its \u201chuman-centric\u201d approach and was simply \u201cexploring how AI can enhance the creative process.\u201d He added: \u201cWe recognize that there are many questions and concerns around our engagement in AI, however, we are committed to approach this ethically, transparently, and responsibly.\u201d\nSome luxury brands have experimented with technology to create digital doubles. In 2021, Dior created a digital version of real-life ambassador Angelababy (who has been dubbed the \u201cKim Kardashian of China\u201d due to her prolific appearances and extravagant lifestyle) to virtually attend its fashion show in Shanghai. A computer-generated version of supermodel Naomi Campbell appeared in Burberry\u2019s campaign that same year.\nRecalling her previous experience working for an online luxury retailer, Lara Ferris \u2014 now strategy director of Spring Studios, a global creative agency with clients such as Louis Vuitton, Tom Ford and Est\u00e9e Lauder \u2014 said: \u201cTen years ago, they tried to shoot products at volume. Clothes like T-shirts, shorts, coats and dresses would be photographed and transposed onto an online model. There was no human involved.\u201d\nThe use of AI models allows companies \u201cto create images at scale very quickly,\u201d said Ferris. It\u2019s indicative of the rapid growth and globalization of the fashion industry, which has created tremendous ethical and environmental problems. \u201cWe\u2019ve always struggled with appetite and demand, and this is how the industry keeps up. The fact that you can create an image and reproduce that across thousands of products is very mass. But does it feel premium? No,\u201d she concluded.\nMichael Musandu, the CEO and founder of digital model studio Lalaland.ai, which partnered with Levi\u2019s to create its AI models, said that the use of AI models in fashion is already more widespread than many realize, and that brands of all sizes are simply not disclosing it because there is no legal obligation to.\nThe recent sale of Musandu\u2019s company Lalaland.ai to digital design firm Browzwear is a testament to the growing opportunities in the space, he said. Like many AI model creators, Musandu insists his work is supplementary and not intended to replace real-life models. \u201cWe launched by solving a massive problem, which is people of color feeling underrepresented while shopping online. I never got to see models that looked like myself,\u201d said Musandu, who was born in Zimbabwe, raised in South Africa, and studied computer science and AI in the Netherlands, where he is currently based.\nAs diversity in fashion continues to be a priority, brands are still shooting with real models but using AI to increase their output, said Musandu. \u201cThere is no brand that we work with that is scaling down on traditional photography.\u201d Musandu added that it would be impossible to entirely replace real-life models, who \u201ccan create genuine connection with consumers.\u201d\nSpring Studios\u2019 Ferris agrees, noting that the most successful models and online influencers today, such as Julia Fox, Gabbriette and Olivia Neill, are not traditional in that they are not \u201cstatuesque and don\u2019t speak,\u201d but they have a large fanbase because they are \u201creally active online and engaged with their communities.\u201d While it will become \u201cincreasingly difficult\u201d to tell an AI model apart from a real-life person online, Ferris argued that the latter\u2019s personalities will set them apart and become an even greater asset.\nStill, the further use of AI in fashion is just another potential risk for models, who have historically lacked protection in the workplace and across the sector. It\u2019s what the New York State Fashion Workers Act, which took effect in June, seeks to do (the new law, co-sponsored by Ziff\u2019s Model Alliance, regulates model management companies, provides complaint procedures and sets up penalties for violations). \u201cI don\u2019t think that the use of AI is inherently bad, but it will be used to exploit people without the proper guardrails in place,\u201d said Ziff.\nThe new law, she added, \u201cis not a silver bullet by any stretch, but it\u2019s a starting point.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "The latest issue of Vogue, featuring Anne Hathaway, has sparked significant backlash due to the inclusion of AI-generated fashion models in advertisements, leading some readers to cancel their subscriptions. Critics argue that using AI models undermines the authenticity and emotional connection that human models provide, raising concerns about representation and job security in the fashion industry. While proponents of AI in fashion cite benefits like cost efficiency and faster production, the public's reaction suggests a strong preference for genuine human representation in fashion advertising.",
