  "title": "Public sector one step closer to four-day working week after \u2018positive\u2019 trial",
  "description": "Workers switched to 32-hour weeks with no loss of pay or benefits",
  "content": "A trial of a four-day working week in the public sector has yielded \u201coverwhelmingly positive\u201d results and could pave the way for the model to become more widely adopted.\n\nWorkers at two Scottish public sector bodies \u2013 Accountant in Bankruptcy (AiB) and South of Scotland Enterprise (SOSE) \u2013 switched to a 32-hour week with no loss of pay or benefits during the year-long trial.\n\nA total of 259 workers are employed between the two organisations, with almost all participating in the trial. In both cases, staff reported less work-related stress and greater satisfaction with their job and work-life balance.\n\nAlmost all workers at SOSE (98 per cent) said the four-day week trial improved morale and motivation in the workplace, while those who reported feeling \u2018very satisfied\u2019 with their work-life balance rose from four per cent to 84 per cent just nine months in.\n\nStaff with caring responsibilities gave some of the strongest responses to the pilot, with some describing it as \u201clife-changing\u201d.\n\nThe trial was coordinated by the Autonomy Institute, which was commissioned by the Scottish government.\n\nChief executive Will Stronge said: \"The results of the Scottish government pilot have been overwhelmingly positive, demonstrating that both the workers and employers involved are thriving.\n\n\"These groundbreaking results show that the public sector can reap similar benefits, including improved productivity, employee well-being, and work-life balance.\n\n\"As the introduction of AI accelerates across industries, it's crucial that workers in both the public and private sectors experience the benefits of these advancements, and one of the easiest ways of achieving this is by shortening the working week.\"\n\nBoth participating groups made clear that they wanted normal levels of service to be maintained. To enable this, staff days off were staggered to make sure service was maintained for the full working week.\n\nBoth organisations have opted to extend the pilot beyond the trial period.\n\nThe success of the trial comes after the Liberal Democrat-run South Cambridgeshire District Council became the first UK local authority to permanently adopt a four-day working week in July.\n\nA similar trial period was carried out before the decision, with an independent report finding that 21 out of 24 council services had improved or stayed the same since the new working model began in 2023.\n\nThe report also showed that the number of job applicants to the council had risen by more than 120 per cent, while the council makes ongoing yearly savings of \u00a3399,263 due to lower agency staff costs.\n\nIvan McKee, Scotland\u2019s finance minister, said there will be no wider rollout in the government at present despite the positive results.\n\n\u201cWhile the Scottish government and its agencies will not be moving to a 32-hour week at this time, the pilot has identified several examples of more efficient and innovative working practices which will be made available to the wider public sector to help drive reform,\u201d he said.",

That\u2019s how we\u2019re putting our Plan for Change into action.\u201d\nMr Murray said: \u201cThis is a landmark moment and will place Scotland at the forefront of the UK\u2019s technological revolution.\n\u201cThe up to \u00a3750 million investment in Edinburgh\u2019s new supercomputer also places Scotland at the cutting edge of computing power globally.\n\u201cThis will see Scotland playing a leading role in creating breakthroughs that have a global benefit \u2013 such as new medicines, health advances, and climate change solutions.\n\u201cThis is the Plan for Change \u2013 delivering real opportunities and economic growth for communities across Scotland.\u201d\nScottish Government business minister Richard Lochhead said: \u201cWith our world-renowned talent for research, innovation and ingenuity, Scotland is perfectly placed to capitalise on AI\u2019s rapid growth and be a supplier of this transformational technology, not just a consumer.\n\u201cWe are also home to vital supporting and enabling infrastructure \u2013 from good-quality digital connectivity to the abundant renewable energy supplies needed to power the huge demand from computer processing in a sustainable way.\n\u201cThe UK Government\u2019s confirmation that an AI Growth Zone and National Supercomputing Centre will be established in Scotland is welcome.\n\u201cIt will help unlock new opportunities for businesses, researchers, citizens and communities \u2014 supporting high-quality jobs through economic growth and boosting productivity.\u201d"

      "text": "Businesses \u2018thriving\u2019 after adopting four-day working week\nNearly 1,000 workers at 17 different companies adopted a four-day working week for a six-month trial\nA national pilot scheme exploring a four-day working week has concluded with a resounding 100 per cent success rate, prompting all participating companies to permanently adopt the shorter schedule.\nThe six-month trial, which began last November, involved 17 companies and nearly 1,000 workers, and was organised by the 4 Day Week Foundation.\nAll 17 firms have now committed to continuing the four-day week beyond the pilot phase.\nA report on the initiative highlighted that organisations were able to maintain their service levels and key performance indicators throughout the trial period.\nThis demonstrated that productivity did not suffer despite the reduction in working days.\nCrucially, the pilot also yielded substantial benefits for employee wellbeing. Almost two-thirds of workers registered a reduction in how often they experienced burnout, while two in five found an improvement in their mental health.\nFurthermore, nearly half of the participants reported feeling more satisfied with their lives.\nJoe Ryle, campaign director of the 4 Day Week Foundation, said: \u201cWith greater knowledge, expertise and experience of what it takes to successfully implement a four-day week, we\u2019re really pleased to see such a high success rate.\n\u201cPeople are happier, businesses are thriving, and there\u2019s no turning back.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve proved it again and again: a four-day week works and should now be implemented more widely across the economy.\u201d\nAlan Brunt, chief executive of Bron Afon Community Housing with 420 staff, who are extending their pilot further, said: \u201cAlmost as soon as we started talking about it, our teams got together to set about making it work which was brilliant.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve closely monitored our performance and customer satisfaction. We\u2019re happy with the results so far and will continue to make sure we\u2019re delivering for our customers.\n\u201cI expect that most organisations will be doing this in the next 10 years or so.\u201d\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"

      "text": "Is this the end of the five-day week? These companies think so\nA four-day week trial among UK businesses resulted in nearly two-thirds of employees feeling less burned out\nYou\u2019re probably reading this on your weekend. But now imagine that weekend had started a day earlier... and did so every week. Sounds good, right?\nThat could be the new reality many companies and employees face in the future, after the four-day business week took another step towards implementation in the UK.\nThis year, 17 businesses of different types have been trialling the move, organised by the 4 Day Week Foundation. Almost 1,000 different employees were involved, all retaining their normal salary \u2013 and after the culmination of that study, all 17 companies have opted to keep going, following an earlier trial which saw 5,000 people adopt the scheme permanently.\nNot all are doing straight four-day weeks. Some were trialling nine-day fortnights. And there are clearly some industries which would face challenges to alter schedules and regulations.\nBut the initial results for those taking part appeared positive, with nearly two-thirds (62 per cent) of employees saying they noted a \u201creduction in how often they experienced burnout\u201d.\nFirms that took part in the trial have cited customer satisfaction and employee performance as reasons for continuing, with one expecting mass adoption across the next decade.\nVicky Walker, chief people officer at Westfield Health, told The Independent that less work has been shown to mean more output.\n\u201cStudies have shown that a shorter work week can lead to enhanced efficiency and focus among employees. People may be more motivated to complete their tasks and increase productivity. There\u2019s now a growing recognition for flexibility and work-life balance, and this trial is a step in the right direction,\u201d Ms Walker said.\n\u201cThese flexible benefits can also help attract new talent and improve employee retention rates, which for some businesses is a key business target.\u201d\nThere is, however, much more to consider for employers and the wider economy before we see it adopted on a larger scale.\n\u201cUltimately, what matters for the economy is hours worked multiplied by productivity per hour. If people are simply working their weekly hours in four days rather than five, then there should be little economic impact. If they are working harder \u2013 fewer hours for the same output \u2013 then we could see an uptick in productivity, but that wouldn\u2019t necessarily translate into growth because of fewer hours,\u201d Thomas Pugh, chief economist at RSM UK, told The Independent.\nThis is essentially the French model of the system, Mr Pugh explained \u2013 but success in it will naturally lead to businesses asking one pertinent question:\n\u201cIf you can be as productive in four days as in five, then why not be as productive over the full five days?\u201d\nThere also remain questions over the potential for staggered days off \u2013 \u201cDo people want Wednesdays off, for example?\u201d \u2013 and of course, whether a firm\u2019s opening hours would still match up to those of their clients. It\u2019s not a \u201csolution to the UK\u2019s economic problems\u201d, Mr Pugh added.\nAndrew Timpson, a tax partner at RSM, pointed out there would be implications if reduced hours meant reduced pay \u2013 and not just for the Treasury.\n\u201cIf base pay is reduced, there could be an impact on salary sacrifice and pensions,\u201d he said, \u201cplus if employees are earning less, then the tax take will reduce. Some employees may also find themselves slipping under thresholds which will change the personal allowance, or other aspects such as child benefit.\u201d\nThe discussion outside of finance has also taken centre stage.\nA study by BHN Extras recently concluded that over a third of UK workers (34 per cent) said they would accept a pay cut for a shorter commute, and only 23 per cent enjoyed their commute.\nThe survey suggested both the cost and the sentiment were stronger in London, but would knocking a day off the commute to work be a big draw for all?\nIt won\u2019t be one for everybody, nor every business. Implementation costs and rescheduling alone may make it prohibitive, while there\u2019s no doubt that some management may not appreciate the thought of it, let alone the reality.\nBut just like working from home, hot-desking and zero-hours contracts before it, the four-day week looks set to play some part in the future of UK business \u2013 and like all those others, divide plenty of opinion on the way.\nJoin our commenting forum\nJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their replies\nComments"
