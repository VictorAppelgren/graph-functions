  "description": "",
  "content": "Hubris in the financial markets is most apparent when growth is robust and investors ignore the past\n\nAre U.S. recessions a thing of the past - and if so, how should you shift your investment strategy?\n\nAn increasing number of the Wall Street analysts I follow are beginning to ask these questions. They do have a point, as illustrated by the chart below: economic recessions in the U.S. have become far less frequent. If we omit the two-month downturn that accompanied the initial COVID-19 lockdown, it has been more than 16 years since the U.S. economy was last in a recession as designated by the National Bureau of Economic Research - the longest such stretch in U.S. history.\n\nStocks that should benefit the most in a recession-free future would be those previously held back by the threat of a recession - such as growth stocks in general and those in the \"junk\" category in particular.\n\nThis is just what we've been seeing in recent years. Consider the relative returns of quality- and junk stocks, as defined by advisory firm AQR. Stocks that score highest on the dimensions of \"profitability, growth, safety and payout\" are deemed to be in the \"quality\" camp, while those at the opposite ends of these spectra are consider \"junk.\" For each month AQR subtracts the return of a hypothetical \"junk\" portfolio from that of a \"quality\" portfolio.\n\nThe above chart plots the trailing six-month cumulative performance of AQR's monthly quality-minus-junk returns. Notice the downward trend over the past couple of years. Quality's trailing six-month advantage over junk was high during the 2022 bear market. Though technically not a recession, that period came close to one - which helps to explain why junk stocks on average underperformed quality ones. But that's changed.\n\nIs that a recession or a mirage?\n\nThe real question is whether analysts are right that recessions, if not completely a thing of the past, have become so rare that investors no longer need to defend a portfolio against economic growth turning negative for two consecutive quarters.\n\nThe analysts make compelling points, but I'm not convinced. Analysts arguing that recessions have become a thing of the past is all too reminiscent of economist Irving Fisher, who in the fall of 1929 famously declared that \"stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau.\" The October 1929 stock market crash, then the worst in U.S. history, would occur within weeks of his proclamation.\n\nIt's safe to say that hubris about the stock market has not been retired. Throughout history, when economic expansion have lasted several years and memories of the prior contraction have receded, economists begin declaring that recession will never come again.\n\nConsider the headline on this New York Times article: \"Are Recessions A Thing of the Past?\" The story was published in June 1964.\n\nAccording to this article 61 years ago, the idea of American being done with economic recessions was \"a topic of serious conversation among economists and others, as the American economy sets a record with every succeeding month for the duration of a period of peacetime business expansion.\"\n\nThe U.S. economy suffered two severe recessions over the next decade.\n\nOn the other hand, Wall Street's graveyard is filled with economists who have confidently declared that a recession was certain and imminent. So I'm not predicting when the next recession will occur; I'm just saying there'll be one sooner or later. Accordingly, we should pick stocks that are best able to survive an economic downturn.\n\nAnother reason to believe that recessions are fixtures of our economic future is that their ultimate cause is human nature . Whenever economic expansions persist for a long time, people play down the rising risk level. Debt increases and leverage expands, for example, and investors become more willing to bet on companies with little chance of ever being profitable. As a result, the economy becomes more fragile and vulnerable.\n\nThe Federal Reserve and other monetary policy experts can try to moderate the excesses of such a late-stage expansion, but even they can't postpone a recession forever. That won't stop politicians from trying - as we're currently seeing with the intense pressure President Donald Trump is putting on Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.\n\nMark Hulbert is a regular contributor to MarketWatch.

It highlights the performance of quality versus junk stocks, noting that quality stocks have outperformed during market downturns. However, the author expresses skepticism about the notion that recessions are no longer a concern, drawing parallels to historical instances of overconfidence in the market and emphasizing that economic expansions often lead to increased risk and eventual downturns.",
