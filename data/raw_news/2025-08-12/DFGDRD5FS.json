  "content": "JD Vance is expected to stay at a plush countryside estate during his visit to Scotland as police prepare for another major security operation \u2013 only weeks after Donald Trump\u2019s visit.\n\nThe Vice President arrived in England last week for a family holiday, sparking protests from activists who branded him a \u2018moral vacuum\u2019.\n\nMr Vance is set to continue his break at Carnell Estate, near Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, which is known for offering its guests high-end shooting and fishing excursions.\n\nAirspace restrictions have been put in place around the estate between 9am on Wednesday, August 13, and midnight on Sunday, August 17, according to air traffic service provide NATS.\n\nA briefing note published by NATS states: \u2018A VIP will visit the Carnell Estate, Ayrshire Scotland between August 12, 2025 and August17 and as part of the security arrangements the Secretary of State for Transport has decided that it is necessary, on the grounds of public safety and security, to introduce Restriction of Flying Regulations under Article 239 of the Air Navigation Order 2016 to restrict the operation of all types of aircraft.\u2019\n\nCarnell Estate is owned by Michael Findlay and has been family-owned since the 1300s. William Wallace was one of his ancestors.\n\nA description of the country pile on its website states Carnell \u2018is home to a stunning 14th-century tower and historic and luxurious mansion house hidden within beautiful, prize-winning gardens and over 2,000 acres of parkland in Ayrshire, Scotland\u2019.\n\nIt added: \u2018The estate is renowned for its private hospitality and can be rented for exclusive use including corporate think tanks, product launches, bespoke wedding parties, golf groups and shooting.\u2019\n\nBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie stayed at Carnell House while filming World War Z in Glasgow in 2013.\n\nMr Vance and his family were in Kent last week, where they stayed at Chevening House, the official residence of the Foreign Secretary, before spending time in the Cotswolds.\n\nThe Stop Trump Coalition said the Vice President was a \u2018hideous moral vacuum and the British public want nothing to do with him\u2019.\n\nToday, a protest against Mr Vance\u2019s visit was staged in Charlbury, Oxfordshire.\n\nThe demonstration, organised by the Stop Trump Coalition and locals, featured placards such as \u2018Cotswold childless cat ladies say go home\u2019.\n\nMr Vance\u2019s planned trip north of the Border comes just weeks after Mr Trump visited his Turnberry estate, near Girvan, Ayrshire.\n\nThe US President also travelled to Aberdeenshire, where he opened his new golf course at Menie.\n\nThe police operation is believed to have cost more than \u00a33million, with more than 7,000 officers involved.\n\nOne source close to the preparations for Mr Vance\u2019s visit told the Mail: \u2018It is another security headache for the police - another VIP who is likely to trigger protests.\n\n\u2018It won\u2019t be quite as big as the Trump operation but it will still be very significant.\u2019\n\nMr Vance used a major speech in Munich in February to suggest Scots could face prosecution for praying in their own homes.\n\nThe Vice President attacked what he viewed as an erosion of free speech across Europe.\n\nAnd he pointed to the recent introduction of buffer zones around Scottish abortion clinics as an example of the kind of crackdown he feared.\n\nMr Vance said during his speech in February: \u2018This last October, the Scottish Government began distributing letters to citizens whose houses lay within so-called \u201csafe access zones\u201d, warning them that even private prayer, within their own home may amount to breaking the law.\n\n\u2018Naturally, the Government urged readers to report any fellow citizens suspected guilty of thought crime.\n\n\u2018In Britain, and across Europe, free speech, I fear, is in retreat.\u2019\n\nThe Scottish Government insisted that Mr Vance\u2019s claim was \u2018incorrect\u2019.\n\nA Police Scotland spokesman said: \u2018Planning is under way for a potential visit to Scotland by the Vice President of the United States.\n\n\u2018Details of any visit would be for the White House to comment on; however it is important that we prepare in advance for what would be a significant policing operation.\u2019\n\nThe White House and Carnell Estate were contacted for comment.",

      "text": "Jeremy Clarkson has today joined the Cotswolds backlash against holidaying US Vice President JD Vance.\nThe presenter revealed his new summer neighbour has interrupted the filming of Clarkson's Farm as the secret service swarms the surrounding countryside and a no\u2013fly zone has been put in place.\nThe Vice President's visit to the Cotswolds has already attracted some criticism with locals complaining of disruption and left\u2013leaning protesters flocking to the area.\nMotoring journalist turned farmer Clarkson said that the one\u2013mile no fly zone around Vance's Cotswolds manor house rental is preventing drone cameramen on his Amazon Prime show from doing their job.\nThe no fly zone has been set up for security reasons while Mr Vance is in residence in the hamlet of Dean for the rest of August.\nHe posted a picture on Instagram showing the no fly zone, including his own farm, Curdle Hill Farm \u2013 also known as Diddly Squat because, he has claimed, that's how much money he stands to make from it.\nThe TV star captioned the map: 'The JD Vance no fly zone. We are the pin. So on the downside, no drone shots today. On the upside, no annoying light aircraft.'\nAnd Clarkson isn't the only one frustrated by Vance's presence in Chipping Norton, with the presenter's right hand man Kaleb Cooper complaining that the extra security had derailed him from his own farming duties.\nJeremy Clarkson has joined the Cotswolds backlash against holidaying US Vice President JD Vance who was spotted yesterday visiting Daylesford Organic farm shop (pictured)\nMr Vance was said to have shown particular interest in the bread counter, where he tried several samples during his visit as he relaxed in the Cotswolds\nThe Vice President's visit has already attracted criticism with locals complaining of disruption and left\u2013leaning protesters flocking to the area (Pictured: a small protest in Chevening ahead of Mr Vance's visit)\nDemonstrators pose with placards and in T-shirts criticising the vice president as part of a 'Vance not welcome party' organised by Stop Trump Coalition\nA woman hold up a Colin the Caterpillar cake with a picture of the JD Vance meme as part of protests against Vance's visit to the UK\nA woman wearing a keffiyeh around her shoulders holds up a sign criticising Vance\nA man holds up signs reading 'JD Vance thinks the moon is 'just a rumour' and demanding he go home as he takes part in a protest in Oxfordshire\nProtestors pose with signs and placards demanding JD Vance return to the US as they campaign against him holidaying in the idyllic village of Chipping Norton\nTwo protestors hold placards at a 'Vance not welcome' party as local residents gather in Charlbury to protest his visit to Oxfordshire\nAnd it's not just Clarkson who has had a run in with the US vice president.\nThe former Top Gear presenter turned farmer's right hand man Kaleb Cooper also had an encounter.\nIn a comment on Instagram the farmhand revealed that his own farming duties were derailed by the Republican politician's visit.\nThe farmer \u2013 who has his own land and has spun out a successful entertainment career of his own \u2013 said his wheat transportation was held up by the convoy as it passed through Chipping Norton.\nHe also slammed Vance for his conspicuous presence in the area, writing on Instagram: 'My wheat got wet in the trailer last night as the convo stopped me in the rain in Chippy.\n'I could easily have went on my way and got it in the shed without getting in the way.'\nAdding several laughing emojis, he noted: '(If) he had just drove around in a VW Polo nobody would know who he was.'\nThe Daily Mail revealed the close proximity of Mr. Vance's manor house rental to Clarkson's farm last week.\nThe enormous property, Dean Manor, is located in a tiny hamlet of just 12 houses in Oxfordshire, and was picked out by US secret service personnel because of its remote secure location.\nStone walls 15ft tall protect its immaculately manicured six\u2013acre gardens.\nFilming of series five of Jeremy Clarkson's hit TV show Clarkson's Farm has been interrupted by the presenter's new summer neighbour US Vice President J D Vance (Pictured: Clarkson at behind the bar of his pub The Farmer's Dog)\nOn Instagram, Clarkson said that the one mile no fly zone around Vance's Cotswolds manor house rental is preventing Amazon Prime drone cameramen from doing their job\nKaleb Cooper complaining that the extra security had derailed him from his own farming duties and disrupted his wheat harvest\nA large billboard photograph depicting a 'JD Vance Edit' meme - exaggerating his features and removing his hair - has appeared in Cheltenham\nA van, displaying meme imagery of U.S. Vice President JD Vance, organised by the campaign group Everyone Hates Elon, travels through the town of Charlbury\nA sign reading 'Gaza Starves, Vance Not Welcome' is displayed outside a home near Chipping Norton in the Cotswolds\nProtestors pose with signs and banners reading 'go away' and 'bullies not welcome here' in the village of Chipping Norton\nA demonstrator dons a mask of US president Donald Trump as they protest JD Vance's visit to the Cotswolds\nA woman holds a flag displaying the JD Vance meme showing the politician with exaggerated features and an egg-shaped head\nA woman holds a sign demanding Vance 'go home' as she demonstrates in Charlbury, Oxfordshire\nProtestors draped balloons with the JD Vance mem on them around trees and held aloft Palestinian flags in the village where the vice president is holidaying\nVance is staying in Dean Manor, located in a tiny hamlet of just 12 houses in Oxfordshire, which was picked out by US secret service personnel because of its remote secure location\nSecurity personnel pictured outside Vance's Cotswolds retreat, just down the road from Clarkson's Diddly Squat Farm\nThe house, which was built 1702 in the reign of Queen Anne, is surrounded by teams of US secret service operatives dressed in regulation navy blue sports jackets and khaki chino trousers who are guarding the property around the clock.\nThe manor house's owner, Pippa Hornby, was also sworn to secrecy on the imminent arrival of her new high\u2013profile tenant.\nIt is believed the rental may cost as much as \u00a38,000 a week.\nWhen asked by the Daily Mail about JD Vance's rental of her home, she would only say: 'Thanks so much but we have no comment to make.'\nLocals however were rather more forthcoming and confirmed the upcoming arrival of Donald Trump's deputy yesterday, while the activity around the manor house itself left little doubt that a very prominent high profile American political figure was indeed on their way.\nIn the grounds of Dean Manor, American secret service personnel in dark glasses, talking into ear\u2013pieces, were dotted around its four corners keeping watch.\nOn the main gateway of the property, leading to a sweeping 'in and out' driveway, two suited security guards were checking the security clearance of those coming and going in a stream of blacked out cars and Mercedes limousine vans.\nIn an adjoining field, an impromptu circular helicopter landing pad had also been mown into the grass.\nWithin the grounds, teams of gardeners had been drafted in to make the lawns and pretty herbaceous borders look immaculate.\nStaff bringing in Vance's suitcases and boxes as he and his family enjoy a summer in the Cotswolds\nCars and security guards at the \u00a38,000 a week manor house built in 1702 in the reign of Queen Anne and previously owned by Tory peer Peter Selwyn Gummer, Baron Chadlington\nThe vice presidential convoy making its way through Chipping Norton with blacked out windows\nOfficers are checking the identity of residents trying to pass through the security cordon, watched on by dozens of Secret Service agents\nThe vice president is in residence in the hamlet of Dean \u2013 just down the road from the former Top Gear presenter \u2013 for the rest of August as he enjoys a summer break\nDean Manor is famous for its picturesque gardens, viewable by appointment \u2013 but the manor has been locked down for Mr Vance's visit between the middle and the end of August.\nBeyond its high honey\u2013coloured Cotswold stone walls, it is surrounded by woodland with the occasional public footpath and public bridleway running nearby.\nFittingly for right\u2013wing Republican Vice President Mr Vance, the manor house has a history of Tory political figures as previous owners.\nIt even has a former Tory Prime Minister living a very short stroll away.\nDean Manor was built in 1702 for local Oxford Tory MP Thomas Rowney and is grade II listed.\nIt was until recently owned by Tory peer Peter Selwyn Gummer, Baron Chadlington.\nFormer Tory Prime Minister David Cameron \u2013 who is also known as Lord Cameron of Chipping Norton \u2013 also lives in Dean with his wife Samantha and he has a permanent team of armed Metropolitan Police Protection officers at his home there.\nDean Manor is about as close a neighbouring property to Clarkson's own Cotswolds home, Curdle Hill Farm, better known as Diddly Squat Farm, can be.\nThey are a mile apart as the crow flies, separated mainly by Clarkson's own arable fields.\nOne local who did not wish to be named said: 'Dean Manor is as close as possible to Mr Clarkson's farm house as can be. I'm willing to bet Clarkson can see it out of his bedroom window.'\nRoads, footpaths and village lanes in and out of the hamlet of Dean have been sealed off and locals are being questioned by police and security (Pictured: a woman on horseback talking to a police officer)\nA woman holds a sign that reads'I'm from a random country' following the vice president's remarks about Europe having not fought a war for 40 years\nTwo women rest on a bench surrounded by JD Vance balloons as a van displaying the Vance mem drives past them through Charlbury\nBut his holidaying in the area has seen left\u2013leaning protesters flock to the area with signs telling the vice president he is not welcome (pictured)\nProtest signs read 'Fascists not welcome here' and were placed outside houses\nMore signs were placed along gates and fences in the local area as part of the backlash against Vance's visit\nAll of which might make Clarkson feel a little awkward this summer after he made a particularly caustic attack on the very same JD Vance in a recent Sunday Times column of his.\nIn March of this year, probably around the time that the US Vice President and his secret service operatives were making plans for his Cotswolds summer break, Clarkson issued a strong response to Mr Vance following his comments about the British and French armed forces.\nVance was recently condemned for describing the UK as 'some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years' amid rising tensions between Europe and the US as to how Ukraine can be supported in their conflict with Russia.\nThe US vice president was accused of erasing the experience of Britons who served in Iraq and Afghanistan after his latest tirade against America's European allies.\nVance told Fox News: 'If you want to actually ensure that Vladimir Putin does not invade Ukraine again, the very best security guarantee is to give Americans economic upside in the future of Ukraine.\n'I've searched for the right word to describe him and I think it's \"t**t\". He also has no clue about history.\n'Because far more recently than 30 or 40 years ago, as Vance claimed last week, our brave young men were being blown to pieces in some godforsaken desert to support whatever madcap scheme the American president had embarked upon that week.\n'And let's not forget that while they were out there, dying in agony, the UK was still paying the US back for all the weapons we'd bought from them to defeat Hitler in the Second World War. In fact, the last payment for all their 'help' was for \u00a343m in 2006.\n'And while we are on the subject of the Second World War, let's not forget that what Trump is doing in Ukraine is like Franklin Roosevelt saying to Churchill: \"Look, Hitler has taken Poland so just let him have it\".'"

Locals and protesters have expressed their discontent with Vance's presence, organizing demonstrations and voicing their opposition through signs and social media. The Vice President's comments about the UK, which he referred to as a 'random country' that hasn't fought a war in decades, have further fueled criticism, leading to a mix of frustration and protest among residents.",
