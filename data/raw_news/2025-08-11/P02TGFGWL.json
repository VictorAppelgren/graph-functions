  "title": "Fantasy Premier League: How to get off to a good start in FPL \u2013 seven rules for success",
  "description": "Abdul Rehman explains how to ensure your Gameweek One team sets the foundation for a strong season",
  "content": "The opening weeks of the Fantasy Premier League season can be really important.\n\nA good start can set the tone for the entire campaign, giving you an advantage over your mini-league rivals and putting you on the way to attaining a good overall rank. On the other hand, beginning poorly can lead to rushed transfers, wasted chips and early wildcards.\n\nSo, how do we ensure our Gameweek One team sets the foundation for success?\n\nHere I will share my thoughts on some of the best ways to get off to a flyer in FPL.\n\nDon\u2019t be put off by following the \u2018template\u2019\n\nAt the start of every FPL season, a \u2018template\u2019 always forms \u2014 and for fair reason. These players are fine picks and are highly owned because of good underlying numbers, favourable fixtures, and/or because they represent good value.\n\nWhile it can be tempting to pick a team full of differentials, these opening weeks are not the time to gamble on too many risky picks.\n\nThe likes of Erling Haaland (\u00a314.0m) or Mohamed Salah (\u00a314.5m) are perma-captain options who can deliver double-digit hauls regularly. Choosing to avoid these players early can be detrimental if they then deliver in those weeks. We saw what Haaland and Salah did at the beginning of last season and the real beneficiaries were those FPL managers who started off owning both of them.\n\nA balanced approach is wise, building your core team around the popular, high-ownership assets, and then sprinkling in one or two smart differentials who have good fixtures and high upside if you really fancy them.\n\nDon\u2019t just go for differentials for the sake of it.\n\nA common mistake early in the season is to ignore the fixtures. Teams often start the season with different schedules, and FPL points tend to flow from teams with more favourable early runs.\n\nThis may mean foregoing big-hitters and proven players who we know will do well over the season as a whole.\n\nFor example, we will all probably own two Arsenal defenders and one of their attackers at least, eventually. However, with Liverpool (A), Manchester City (H) and Newcastle (A) in their first six games, is it wise to start with three of Mikel Arteta\u2019s players?\n\nTeams such as Tottenham and Everton have great fixtures in the opening weeks and I can see a template forming with at least two players from each of those \u2014 I think this is a good idea, as we can target them for the good early run and just transfer them out later.\n\nWith the new rules of double chips and an extra five free transfers given to us in Gameweek 16, we can afford to be a bit more flexible.\n\nTargeting good fixtures means a higher chance of goals, clean sheets and points, in theory. Plus, the extra bonus of your team increasing in value if those players do well is always welcome.\n\nIn the early weeks, picking nailed-on starters is crucial. Teams are still settling at the start of a new season, managers are rotating new signings, and squad depth can create uncertainty. Selecting players who are guaranteed to play 90 minutes for their club every game can prevent frustration and lost points due to benchings.\n\nSimilarly, avoid gambling too heavily on new transfers into the Premier League. Even the best players can take weeks or months to adapt after coming to the league. It\u2019s hard to not get swayed by glamorous new signings but remember, it\u2019s all about FPL points and more minutes on the pitch often equals more of those.\n\nAs an example, I have Florian Wirtz (\u00a38.5m) in the current draft of my team but, honestly, I don\u2019t think I will start the season with him.\n\nHe is clearly a great player and has had a promising pre-season with Liverpool, but he isn\u2019t on penalties for them and is new to English football. I have no doubt he will come good in the Premier League but will that happen in these first few weeks? Going for someone such as Eberechi Eze (\u00a37.5m) instead, and saving \u00a31million of your budget, sounds boring but, quite frankly, is sensible. The Crystal Palace man is sure to start if fit, and is on both penalty and set-piece duties.\n\nThis season, FPL has introduced points for players\u2019 \u2018defensive contributions\u2019. These include clearances, blocks, interceptions and tackles (CBIT).\n\nOnce a defender reaches 10 defensive contributions in a match, they get an extra two points. For midfielders and forwards, it\u2019s two points for 12 contributions, but the term also counts recoveries for those positions.\n\nThis makes nailed-on, 90-minute players even more important across the board, but especially in defence. It also shifts the power towards centre-backs when, over the past few years, full-backs were the go-to guys on clubs\u2019 back lines. Full-backs tend to get subbed off earlier in games, and centre-backs typically make more of those actions that count towards earning defensive-contribution points.\n\nAlso, make sure you have a defence which you will be happy with, long term and barring injuries, so you don\u2019t need to use a transfer on them. Look at two-way or three-way rotational pairs and \u2018set-and-forget\u2019 buys. I know we have extra transfers coming midway through the season, but you want to be using those on your attacking players.\n\nPlayer prices fluctuate greatly at the start of the season as millions of FPL managers jump on early bandwagons. It\u2019s easy to get caught in the rush of price rises and waste early transfers chasing points from one-week wonders.\n\nThe key is patience. Trust the players you\u2019ve chosen for their fixtures and ability. Unless there\u2019s a significant injury or a clear upgrade, waiting a few gameweeks before making changes often pays off.\n\nIf you\u2019ve picked players with long-term fixtures in mind, hold your nerve and see where else you can upgrade.\n\nPlan when to use your chips\n\nWhile we have two sets of all the chips this season, it\u2019s still a good idea to plan when you are going to use them\u2026 at least roughly.\n\nUsing the first wildcard to target fixture swings and having a gameweek in mind where you will use the Free Hit and Bench Boost is still optimal. Let others make the mistake of thinking no more planning is needed. Although admittedly, with the new rules, long-term planning has less of an advantage, the edge will always be there.\n\nFor this season, the planning will just be in smaller blocks. In the second half of the season, the same rules apply: use your chips around blanks and double gameweeks.\n\nLook at what happened in pre-season\n\nClubs\u2019 warm-up friendlies are goldmines of information. They can reveal which players are sharp and who\u2019s taking the set pieces, and are especially good for getting an idea about those budget gems. The next John Lundstram, Michu or Matt Doherty (the Wolves defender was a brilliant asset in the 2018-19 and 2019-20 seasons) could be around the corner.\n\nI tend to ignore \u2018form\u2019 in pre-season as it\u2019s not the best indicator, due to the quality of opposition, often from lower divisions or other leagues, and intensity of the matches. However, these games are great to get a gauge on formations, expected minutes and general fitness levels or availability.\n\nThe first few gameweeks of the season are not about winning FPL. They\u2019re about setting a strong foundation, steady points, consistent captaincy picks, and a balanced squad that doesn\u2019t force you to make transfers or burn an unplanned wildcard.\n\nIt\u2019s also about not getting left behind the rest of the pack. Having a poor start can mean an uphill struggle for the majority of your season.\n\nI myself have begun slowly in the past two years and although, in the second half, I luckily managed to pull things back, it was a slog. With better returns early on, I could have easily got back-to-back top-10k finishes. Instead, I ranked 70k and 48k.\n\nBy focusing on fixtures, proven players and nailed picks, you can build momentum without the need for an early wildcard. A calm, well-structured approach almost always beats knee-jerk reactions in the opening weeks of the season.\n\nWant to compete against your fellow subscribers?

      "text": "The most settled metric in Fantasy Premier League to build your Gameweek One team around is the fixture list, with pre-season form often an unreliable indicator in the classic battle of form vs fixtures.\nFor 2025-26, the fixture analysis is compelling, with none of the clubs you\u2019d traditionally invest in having a remarkable start in terms of their opening games.\nAdd into the mix a full complement of chips for the first half of the season, plus a boost to five free transfers for Gameweek 16, and chip strategy becomes a key consideration, too.\nA look at the football calendar\nBefore the Premier League season even kicks off, we\u2019ve had Crystal Palace beating Liverpool on penalties in the Community Shield, while Tottenham Hotspur will travel to Italy to contest the UEFA Super Cup against Paris Saint-Germain on Wednesday.\nAs it stands, Crystal Palace actually have six competitive fixtures in August, with their demotion to the UEFA Conference League \u2014 Palace have appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) to present the club\u2019s case for reinstatement to the Europa League \u2014 seeing them in two-legged play-off action in the midweeks between the opening three Premier League gameweeks.\nFor the other sides who have qualified for European football this season (Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester City, Chelsea, Newcastle, Spurs, Aston Villa and Nottingham Forest), they have no midweek fixtures in August once the Premier League has begun.\nThat presents a big advantage compared to the other sides not in Europe, who have Carabao Cup second-round action in the midweek between Gameweek Two and Gameweek Three. Following Gameweek Three, from September 1-9, we then have the first international break of the season.\nFollowing this first international break at the start of September, the schedule then really ramps up for those clubs in Europe as the group stages of those competitions begin. By this time, the summer transfer window has closed.\nAdvertisement\nFixture Analysis\nGiven the proximity of the first international break and gaps in the midweek schedule for the teams we traditionally invest in, I\u2019m going to initially look at the fixtures for the opening three gameweeks of the season.\n| Team | GW1 | GW2 | GW3 |\n|---|---|---|---|\nMan. United (A) | Leeds (H) | Liverpool (A) | |\nNewcastle (H) | Brentford (A) | C. Palace (H) | |\nLiverpool (A) | Wolves (H) | Tottenham (A) | |\nNott. Forest (A) | Aston Villa (H) | Sunderland (A) | |\nFulham (H) | Everton (A) | Man. City (H) | |\nTottenham (A) | Sunderland (H) | Man. United (A) | |\nC. Palace (H) | West Ham (A) | Fulham (H) | |\nChelsea (A) | Nott. Forest (H) | Aston Villa (A) | |\nLeeds (A) | Brighton (H) | Wolves (A) | |\nBrighton (A) | Man. United (H) | Chelsea (A) | |\nEverton (H) | Arsenal (A) | Newcastle (H) | |\nBournemouth (H) | Newcastle (A) | Arsenal (H) | |\nWolves (A) | Tottenham (H) | Brighton (A) | |\nArsenal (H) | Fulham (A) | Burnley (H) | |\nAston VIlla (A) | Liverpool (H) | Leeds (A) | |\nBrentford (H) | C. Palace (A) | West Ham (H) | |\nBurnley (H) | Man. City (A) | Bournemouth (H) | |\nWest Ham (H) | Burnley (A) | Brentford (H) | |\nSunderland (A) | Chelsea (H) | Nott. Forest (A) | |\nMan. City (H) | Bournemouth (A) | Everton (H) |\nNottingham Forest, Aston Villa, Spurs and Chelsea each have two home games in this three-game period, with reasonable opening fixtures across the board. Forest top the Fantasy Football Hub fixture ticker, which ranks teams by the overall ease of their games over the opening six gameweeks.\nNottingham Forest host Brentford and West Ham, sandwiching a trip to Crystal Palace, who could well be fatigued given their European commitments. They do then face Arsenal in Gameweek Four, before they face promoted teams Burnley and Sunderland, giving their assets some longevity.\nAston Villa have a trickier opener at home to Newcastle United, but investors shouldn\u2019t be put off: Villa Park is a fortress, with Unai Emery\u2019s side coming off 4-1 victors in this fixture back in April. They then face Brentford and Crystal Palace. Their favourable schedule extends until Gameweek Nine.\nSpurs have a tough away trip to Manchester City in Gameweek Two, but their home games either side are much kinder, beginning with promoted Burnley and then Bournemouth. New head coach Thomas Frank could make an early impact and their fixtures remain positive into September and October.\nChelsea will be thankful for a favourable run of opening fixtures after a busy summer winning the Club World Cup, meaning a shorter pre-season for them. They face Crystal Palace, West Ham and Fulham in their first three games. The schedule remains kind in September before they host Liverpool in early October.\nManchester City face a trip to Wolves in Gameweek One, who have been a bogey team for them in the past. Following their clash with Tottenham in Gameweek Two, it\u2019s then a trip to Brighton, with the Manchester derby coming immediately after the international break.\nAdvertisement\nLiverpool\u2019s opening schedule is tough to call. They begin the season hosting Bournemouth in the Friday-night game on August 15, but then travel to Newcastle United before entertaining Arsenal in Gameweek Three. Beyond that, it\u2019s a trip to Burnley and the Merseyside derby at Anfield.\nArsenal share the same challenging start given that meeting in Gameweek Three between last season\u2019s top two. They kick off their campaign at Old Trafford in Gameweek One, with their home game against promoted Leeds United in Gameweek Two a key one to target. Their schedule doesn\u2019t improve into September, where they face Nottingham Forest, Manchester City and Newcastle United.\nNewcastle United have the toughest opener of all the sides involved in Europe, travelling to Aston Villa on the opening weekend before hosting Liverpool. Their trip to Leeds United in Gameweek Three could be the time to jump on board their assets, with Wolves and Bournemouth after the break.\nFixture strategy\nBearing in mind that Liverpool and Arsenal face off in Gameweek Three and Newcastle United are against Leeds United, this could provide an early opportunity to use the Free Hit chip.\nManchester United hosting Burnley and Brentford entertaining Sunderland are also fixtures to target here.\nIt\u2019s important for managers to consider their chip strategy when building a draft for Gameweek One, since it could heavily impact how far into the future you look ahead in terms of fixtures.\nGiven the addition of five free transfers to cover Africa Cup of Nations call-ups in Gameweek 16, there\u2019s an even stronger case for an early wildcard this season, perhaps as soon as Gameweek Four. This also allows you to build team value quickly.\nFixture runs around Gameweek 16 will also be worth planning for. Arsenal head into a good run of fixtures at this point, with Wolves, Everton, Brighton, Aston Villa and Bournemouth in their festive schedule.\nAdvertisement\nIt\u2019s important to have a loose strategy to start the season with, but that could provide inflexibility further down the line. While there are no predicted double gameweeks in the first half of the season, external factors like bad weather could change things.\n(Top photo: Martin Rickett/PA Images via Getty Images)"

      "text": "It\u2019s Fantasy Premier League, but perhaps not as you know it.\nThe makers of everyone\u2019s favourite Premier League companion game have announced some pretty major changes to the rules for the 2025-26 season, which will almost certainly affect strategies across the board.\nThe first is that outfield players can now be rewarded with two FPL points for \u201cdefensive contributions\u201d.\nAdvertisement\nDefenders who reach a combined total of 10 clearances, blocks, interceptions and tackles (known as CBIT) in a match will score two points, as will midfielders and forwards who reach 12 CBIT points \u2014 but in addition, they can also rack these up via \u201cball recoveries\u201d.\nThe second major change is that FPL users will now have access to two super-powered sets of chips: the Wildcard, Free Hit, Triple Captain and Bench Boost. The initial four chips must be used before the Gameweek 19 deadline on December 30, and cannot be carried over into the second half of the season.\nAnd to complete a trio of rule changes, FPL announced on Saturday that all of its managers will be topped up to the maximum of five free transfers in Gameweek 16, to help them more easily navigate the impact of players leaving their club to compete in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON), which runs from December 21 to January 18.\nHere, our FPL experts Holly Shand and Abdul Rehman explore how these rule changes may impact the game and how you can take advantage of the new status quo.\nWhat is the most eye-catching change to the rules for FPL in 2025-26?\nHolly: Doubling the number of chips for the season definitely caught my eye, and left me feeling excited about the season ahead.\nAs an engaged manager, in the past I have often felt restricted by having to save chips for the second half of the season, where we typically see more blanks and double gameweeks \u2014 these have traditionally been the best time to use these chips \u201con paper\u201d. This time around, we will have the opportunity to use our chips in the first half of the season, with the freedom to go on instinct and gut feeling, and without being punished in its second half.\nSince the introduction of chips for 2015-16, they have been the most exciting part of the game, with the power to make or break your season, so to have those opportunities doubled provides plenty of hope. I think it will also encourage a greater variety of strategies and team differences, which is only a good thing in my eyes.\nAdvertisement\nAbdul: The double set of chips for sure. I\u2019m all for any changes that make the game more fun but, at the same time, please don\u2019t change its core scoring. Having more chips means we don\u2019t need to wait until the second half of the season to use them around doubles and blanks. We can have a bit of fun using them in single weeks and chase upside. It also means more varied strategies, which is a great thing.\nOf course, we were free to use the chips in the first half of the season before, but you would have to get quite lucky to outscore those managers using them around double and blank gameweeks.\nI think this will also keep more FPL managers engaged for longer, which is probably why the game has introduced the change.\nWhat do you make of the changes to chips, and how do you think this will affect strategies?\nHolly: We often see players new to the game using chips in the opening gameweeks of the season without realising their worth later on, and then being punished for this lack of knowledge.\nThese changes will allow them to remain on an even keel with more experienced managers in the long term, instead of dropping off. As a content creator in FPL, a strong start is definitely helpful, so I\u2019m absolutely open to using the chips early, too.\nBench Boost has plenty of constraints on your team and could be something best played in Gameweek 1 or shortly after your first Wildcard. I\u2019ll personally be waiting to gather information on the worst defences in the league before committing to using a Triple Captain chip in the first half of the season, but it will likely be used on one of the big premium-price players, such as Erling Haaland or Mohamed Salah.\nFree Hit can be used as a \u201cget out of jail free\u201d card if injuries or suspensions leave your team in bad shape, or could be activated to attack a gameweek with alternative picks when you have lots of players facing each other in your main squad.\nAbdul: I don\u2019t think it will change much for the second half of the season, as it will still be optimal to use them around blanks and doubles \u2014 but it will mean planning more meticulously in the first half of the season now.\nA Bench Boost in Gameweek 1 becomes much more viable, as you can set your team up for an early wildcard afterwards and get that chip \u201cout of the way\u201d. You are effectively wildcarding in Gameweek 1, so it\u2019s not a bad time to play it at all now that we have another available to us.\nAdvertisement\nTriple Captain and Free Hit can be used on a whim as and when your team need them, and there will be less need for long-term strategy as we are not planning for doubles and blanks. The Free Hit might come in really handy, actually, with nine of the 20 Premier League clubs competing in Europe this season and the extra games that come in those competitions.\nHaving two sets of chips might even encourage FPL managers to be a bit more maverick with their first ones. Chasing differentials and unconventional times to use the chip is a lot easier when you know you have another set to use in the second half of the season.\nWhat do you make of the removal of the Assistant Manager chip that was introduced in the 2024-25 season?\nHolly: The removal of the Assistant Manager chip is a major positive for me, as the introduction of this chip in the 2024-25 season seemed flawed on several levels.\nFor starters, it felt far too complicated for casual managers to understand, and the one-chip-per-gameweek rule will have caught many out. In addition, the chip had too much power in the game, with massive swings of 50-plus points if activated to perfection, which could cause a huge shift in overall rank and mini-leagues come the end of the season.\nIt was also frustrating to spend half the season looking at what was billed as a \u201cMystery Chip\u201d, with no idea of what it was, what it would do and how it could impact strategy later on. Avoiding that eventuality is another positive in my book.\nAbdul: I enjoyed the Assistant Manager chip from a selfish point of view, simply because I gained around 45 points from it. But from a game-state perspective, I think it is the right decision to remove it from the game, as it was too powerful.\nI also feel it was maybe a bit too complicated for the average FPL manager to take advantage of. It really favoured the hardcore managers who were able to research the best time to use it.\nAdvertisement\nThere should be a nice balance of luck and skill in FPL, and at the moment, I think they have it right, even with the two sets of chips. The Assistant Manager chip tipped it too far into the luck category, due to how the scoring was structured. You could literally come away with zero points while others were getting near 50.\nLet\u2019s talk about the new defensive contribution points. What do you make of this addition?\nHolly: The introduction of defensive contribution points brings FPL in line with other popular fantasy games that we\u2019ve seen from other providers, and those from major international tournaments.\nI\u2019m not surprised by its inclusion, given that it\u2019s been something well discussed in the FPL community for years. I\u2019m a little sceptical of the form in which it\u2019s been introduced, with a variety of actions all being pooled together in one metric known as clearances, blocks, interceptions and tackles (CBIT) for defenders, and then adding ball recoveries for attacking players \u2014 it might have been neater to have those actions count individually.\nIt will change the way FPL managers watch games and scout players, and there will almost certainly be some frustrations along the way about exactly which actions are credited towards the tally of 10 or 12, respectively by position, to activate the two-point bonus.\nBrand new for the 2025/26 season \ud83e\udd29\nIntroducing defensive contribution points \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f#FPL pic.twitter.com/LAseSwN2DO\n\u2014 Fantasy Premier League (@OfficialFPL) July 18, 2025\nAbdul: I am not a big fan of the points for defensive contributions.\nThere are only two extra points on offer per game and player, so it\u2019s not overpowered and won\u2019t cause a huge shift in the viable player pool. But the reason I love FPL is its simplicity, and this change is leading towards taking that out of the game. I\u2019m not totally against it, though, and am willing to see how it goes in the coming season.\nAlso, there is already at least one controversy per gameweek as to what counts as an assist according to the game\u2019s rules, which can cause frustrating changes to points scored. It feels like this new tweak is going to cause similar issues in terms of what constitutes a block, clearance, tackle et cetera. It\u2019s fun watching your FPL players and cheering them to score or assist. I\u2019m not sure I want to be sitting there counting how many tackles or interceptions my guys have made.\nAdvertisement\nDo you think this will have a big impact on how FPL players construct their teams?\nHolly: Without the context of player prices, it\u2019s hard to categorically say how the new defensive contribution points will affect team construction. If prices stay widely similar to the past, I don\u2019t think it will have a big impact in terms of team construction, but it will give certain players more utility.\nTraditionally, we\u2019ve always targeted attacking full-backs in FPL, but centre-backs will now carry more appeal. We\u2019ve also tried to avoid defenders from the promoted teams or against tough opposition, but both of these situations invite pressure on such teams\u2019 defences, which could allow their centre-backs to rack up CBIT actions more frequently. We may also choose a fifth midfielder differently, with those who play the holding role also rewarded in this system.\nAbdul: I think it will impact our defence a lot more than the attack. The likes of Everton\u2019s James Tarkowski and other similar cheaper centre-backs will become more popular. Choosing players who play the full 90 minutes will be even more important now, with full-backs getting subbed off much more often than centre-backs.\nThe lads in central defence also generally make more blocks, interceptions and tackles. There definitely will be some full-backs who will breach this threshold regularly, but that will only become more apparent once the season kicks off.\nFor the attacking positions, I reckon it only really makes a difference to our fifth, or possibly fourth, midfielder. We are still going to pick the likes of Mohamed Salah, Cole Palmer and Bukayo Saka. However, when it comes to the cheaper midfielders at \u00a35.0m and below, their defensive contributions will become a lot more important.\nWho are the players that you think have become attractive FPL assets now they can rack up defensive points?\nHolly: My thoughts immediately went to attack-minded forwards and midfielders who press for their team and get involved in defensive actions too.\nManchester United\u2019s Bruno Fernandes is immediately on my radar. He could be set for a deeper role in the coming season, especially with the looming arrival of Bryan Mbeumo in the summer transfer window to follow that of Matheus Cunha.\nAdvertisement\nI\u2019ll also be keeping a close eye on the prices of Arsenal\u2019s Declan Rice and Enzo Fernandez of Chelsea, who are no strangers to attacking returns and also have some set-piece involvement, while also providing plenty of defensive contributions. Backing assets who play 90 minutes regularly could be an important consideration.\nWhen it comes to defenders, centre-backs from units who typically don\u2019t have plenty of possession fit the bill \u2014 we know that Tarkowski was the top performer in this metric last season. There may also be merit to picking central defenders from those sides who keep consistent clean sheets, such as Liverpool\u2019s Virgil van Dijk and Arsenal\u2019s Gabriel.\nAbdul: FPL\u2019s official X account put out a graphic showing the defenders and midfielders who would have picked up the most points from the defensive contributions last season. Tarkowski, Jan Bednarek of relegation-bound Southampton and Bournemouth\u2019s now-at-Real Madrid Dean Huijsen (all centre-backs) led the way, so the Everton man is definitely on my radar.\nDavid Moyes\u2019 Merseysiders are a solid defensive team and will pick up a fair few clean sheets. Tarkowski is also nailed-on to start if fit, plays 90 minutes when he\u2019s in the team and has a bit of goal threat, too.\nJames Tarkowski tops the charts \ud83d\udcca\nNo defender would have picked up as many defensive contribution points as the Everton defender if they were available in FPL last season \ud83d\udd35#FPL pic.twitter.com/c5yQS9QeUT\n\u2014 Fantasy Premier League (@OfficialFPL) July 18, 2025\nChelsea\u2019s Moises Caicedo would have picked up the most defensive contribution points among midfielders, followed by Elliot Anderson of Nottingham Forest and Wolves\u2019 Joao Gomes.\nMoises Caicedo would have picked up the most defensive contribution points among midfielders last season \ud83d\udc4a\nWith the new defensive contributions points coming in 2025/26, will any of these players be in your squad? \ud83d\udc40#FPL pic.twitter.com/qjP2bg51qP\n\u2014 Fantasy Premier League (@OfficialFPL) July 18, 2025\nCaicedo picked up an extra 42 points, which is quite significant, so his price is something I\u2019ll be keeping an eye on. Other defensive midfielders such as Rice, Fernandez, Manchester City\u2019s Rodri and Bruno Guimaraes of Newcastle might be interesting, too. They all have a fair bit of attacking threat as well.\nFernandes could be the one who benefits the most from this. We all know he\u2019s one of the most likely players in the league to start and that he is on penalties for United, but he\u2019s also really involved in play and was used deep quite a lot last season.\nAdvertisement\nOverall, though, a fair bit of research is still needed pre-season to try and find those gems before the pack.\nWhat do you make of all FPL managers getting topped-up to five free transfers in Gameweek 16 to mitigate the impact of AFCON?\nHolly: This is the wildest introduction of all the rule changes we\u2019ve seen in the past couple of days, and one I\u2019m not a fan of.\nAFCON has never had a major impact on FPL, with planning not really necessary for navigating the mid-season tournament. The chances of it impacting four or five of the template player picks seem slim and it effectively gives managers close to an additional wildcard, in addition to the four chips we already have to use in the first half of the season.\nI believe FPL has introduced this to help casual managers who may not plan for that tournament, but less engaged managers will more likely have transfers accrued anyway. The initial reaction within the FPL community has been very negative: maybe we\u2019ll see a U-turn on this decision?\nAbdul: I\u2019m really not a fan of this change. The introduction of extra transfers feels like an attempt to keep casual FPL managers engaged across the season, but it comes at the cost of one of the game\u2019s core elements: planning.\nWith two wildcards, the ability to roll up to five free transfers, and now an additional five of the latter in Gameweek 16, it feels like there are simply too many \u201cget out of jail free\u201d cards. In FPL, or any competitive game, players should be rewarded for putting in the effort, researching stats, scouting players, and thinking ahead. While FPL already involves a significant element of luck, this change tilts the balance even further, making it easier for those who don\u2019t plan or prepare.\nAFCON planning, for example, has always been part of the challenge, giving a real edge to the more engaged managers. Removing that aspect makes the game feel too easy and less rewarding for those who plan strategically.\nAdvertisement\nI also worry that this change will push more managers into following the same strategies and template picks during the first half of the season. It\u2019s disappointing, because the other changes, like the two sets of chips and improved defender bonus, were steps in the right direction in terms of adding variety.\n(Top photo: Michael Regan/Getty Images/Getty Images For The Premier League)"

After struggling with Chelsea, expectations were mixed when he returned to England from Roma, but Salah\u2019s first season at Liverpool saw him score 32 goals and 12 assists, setting a new FPL points record (303). He has set so many benchmarks that it is tough to know where to start, but, in fantasy terms, last season\u2019s record points total of 344 speaks for itself.\nTaking a calculated risk on new players early can give managers a huge advantage.

In his two years at the west London club, Werner only scored 10 times in 56 Premier League appearances.\nThen, in summer 2023, Christopher Nkunku (\u00a36.0m) was another hot attacking prospect who moved from Leipzig to Stamford Bridge. The French forward was coming off two great seasons in the Bundesliga but, shortly after signing for Chelsea, he injured his left knee in a pre-season friendly. He was out for four months and hasn\u2019t looked the player of old since his comeback.\nAdvertisement\nThere are plenty more examples but those we\u2019ve mentioned are sufficient to remind us that proven Premier League experience is often a safer path, especially early in a season when bandwagons and price changes can see you burning through transfers.\nWe know what we are getting with tried and tested players; with brand new signings, the returns are often hit and miss.\nWho is worth the gamble this year?\nStrong options\nDuring pre-season, Wirtz has played as Liverpool\u2019s No 10 at times and is taking a lot of their set pieces. Taking on those creative responsibilities indicates he will be a first-team player and guaranteed minutes. He is coming off the back of two successful seasons at Bayer Leverkusen and has good underlying numbers. Liverpool will score plenty of goals, so provided Wirtz is on the pitch, we can expect returns from him.\nJoao Palhinha (\u00a35.5m) was rarely a priority pick when at Fulham in 2022-23 and 2023-24 but, having joined Tottenham Hotspur on a season\u2019s loan from Bayern Munich, he could be a shrewd addition now because of a rule tweak. Players will be awarded two FPL points this season if they manage 10 \u2018defensive contributions\u2019 (clearances, blocks, interceptions and tackles) in a match.

He has hardly played in pre-season as the transfer saga rumbled on, so is unlikely to start their opening game, away to Manchester United. Kai Havertz (\u00a37.5m) is ready and available to fill the centre-forward role after the hamstring injury that wrecked the second half of his 2024-25 season. With Arsenal also coming up against Liverpool (A), City (H) and Newcastle United (A) in the first six weeks, Gyokeres is just not worth the risk.\nAdvertisement\nOllie Watkins (\u00a39.0m) is a safer alternative \u2014 at the same price, you can have a proven Premier League forward who is sure to start if fit.

      "text": "For serious Fantasy Premier League managers, the early season template is an important factor when starting out in Gameweek 1.\nMany will never have considered the ownership percentages of their players and may be wondering why the template is important or not.\nSo, what is the template for Gameweek 1 and why should we be considering aligning with it to some degree at the start of the season?\nWhat do we mean by \u2018the template\u2019?\nThe template in FPL is simply a team of the most-selected players in the game. There is some negativity around following the template, as it feels like a dull approach.\nThis season, we are set for a bigger variation, given the much higher price point of Erling Haaland (\u00a315m), which will prevent him from starting the season in 80 per cent of sides, as he did in 2023-24.\nThere feels like a broader choice of playing strategies, which has been amplified by the new rules, which allow managers to bank up to five free transfers.\nGO DEEPER\nExplaining the major changes to FPL in 2024-25 - and how to profit from them\nWe need to be mindful that the template emerges for a reason: managers identify players given their previous form, fixture difficulty and points potential. So it\u2019s not surprising the assets that tick all of these boxes become popular.\nGiven the luck involved in the game and these predictions, the template will not always deliver in the opening stages of the season, but embracing it will allow you to keep pace with other managers.\nThe compromise is selecting differentials as well as the core picks from the template and then diversifying your line-up and strategy as the season progresses.\nAdvertisement\nIt\u2019s not essential to pick all the highly owned players in the template; if you have reason to believe an alternative option is better, back your decision and potentially reap the rewards.\nA points haul from an overlooked differential can bring the ultimate bragging rights in mini-leagues, but those punts are far more likely to blank than bang.\nDon\u2019t try to be different just for the sake of it though, as you can easily lose significant ground on your rivals and be on the back foot.\nWho is in the Gameweek 1 template team?\nA small disclaimer to start here: the template does shift throughout pre-season as information emerges on movement in the transfer window and player availability after summer tournaments. This was correct at the time of writing.\nArsenal\u2019s David Raya (\u00a35.5m) has emerged as the goalkeeper of choice, in over 20 per cent of sides, despite his premium price tag. He kept 16 clean sheets last season, including seven in his final 10 games.\nMatt Turner (\u00a34m) is the go-to backup goalkeeper, due to being the highest-scoring goalkeeper at this price point last season, but it\u2019s unlikely he sees any minutes for Nottingham Forest this season. He\u2019s expected to be their third choice.\nArsenal centre-back William Saliba (\u00a36m) headlines the defence, in nearly 40 per cent of sides, but I prefer the goal threat of team-mates Ben White (\u00a36.5m) and Gabriel (\u00a36m).\nThe Arsenal defender ownerships are much more varied among the elite player pool between this pair. Having some investment in a side that kept 18 clean sheets last season will be key.\nManchester City\u2019s Josko Gvardiol (\u00a36m) is well backed, in around one-third of sides, having finished last campaign in fantastic form. He was the highest-scoring Fantasy player in the final nine gameweeks of the season, with six goal involvements. He had more shots on target than any other defender last season, with 14.\nPedro Porro (\u00a35.5m) completes a premium defence in this 3-4-3 formation, having produced 11 goal involvements last campaign. His role in set pieces made him fixture-proof last season. He\u2019s been selected by around 25 per cent of managers for the upcoming season.\nWe should be mindful that a change in the bonus points system for goals conceded by defenders could dent the 20 bonus points he earned last campaign \u2014 we will need to see a significant improvement in the Spurs back line for clean-sheet potential.\nPorro just edges out mid-priced defender options Dan Burn (\u00a34.5m) and Joachim Andersen (\u00a34.5m), who have the potential to provide value. Burn in particular has been a popular pick among managers within the FPL community, whereas Porro is less-fancied.\nAdvertisement\nPromoted defenders Taylor Harwood-Bellis (\u00a34m) and Wout Faes (\u00a34m) are the bench picks to make this squad affordable.\nMoving into the midfield, and last season\u2019s highest-scoring player, Cole Palmer (\u00a310.5m) is owned by nearly half of FPL managers, despite picking up the biggest price rise in fantasy history.\nHe was the highest-scoring player over the final nine gameweeks of last season by some margin, scooping up a total of 35 goal involvements for the season, but his late involvement with England at the Euros does raise questions on his availability for Gameweek 1, with elite managers looking elsewhere.\nAnthony Gordon (\u00a37.5m) is in nearly a third of current drafts, following 27 goal involvements in his breakout season for Newcastle United. He\u2019s even more popular among elite managers, with 71 per cent ownership across a 100-team sample of first drafts I looked at.\nMohamed Salah (\u00a312.5m) is the big premium pick, with great utility for captaincy in each of his opening three fixtures. His ownership compared to Haaland is marginal for the template right now and it\u2019s impossible to fit both in with the high price tags of the other popular players.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that, across elite managers, Salah\u2019s ownership is over 80 per cent, with around half of those managers also choosing to double up with Haaland, making compromises elsewhere in their squads to incorporate two heavy hitters.\nEberechi Eze (\u00a37m) is also in a third of sides, having finished last season in fine form as part of a Crystal Palace side rejuvenated under Oliver Glasner. Michael Olise, who has joined Bayern Munich, will be a big miss, although it does mean more set-piece responsibility for Eze, which may work in his favour.\nPhil Foden (\u00a39.5m) and Bukayo Saka (\u00a310m) narrowly miss out on selection here to make the budget work, with Leicester City\u2019s Harry Winks (\u00a34.5m) the budget fifth midfielder to have on the bench.\nAdvertisement\nMoving into the attack, there are no funds for Haaland, who is only the third-most selected forward in the game, behind Ollie Watkins (\u00a39m) and Alexander Isak (\u00a38.5m), who each are around the 50 per cent ownership mark.\nWithin the FPL community, Isak is deemed essential given his 18 big chances on goal in the final 10 games of last season. He is on penalty duty with Callum Wilson (\u00a37m) injured, facing promoted Southampton at home in Gameweek 1.\nWatkins was the most consistent player in the game last season, with 37 goal involvements from 37 starts.\nJoao Pedro (\u00a35.5m) is winning the race to be the budget forward after Brighton put together a string of impressive performances under Fabian Hurzeler in pre-season. He\u2019s set for regular minutes through the middle of their attack and should be on penalties.\nInputting this XI of the template team into the Fantasy Football Hub My Team Tool gives an AI Gameweek 1 Rating of 91 per cent and an overall Team Rating of 94 per cent.\nAt the time of writing, its AI-predicted points give a Gameweek 1 score of 65.0, which is not far off the AI Best GW1 Team, which is predicted to score 69.4 points, sharing six common players: Raya, Gvardiol, Salah, Gordon, Eze and Isak.\n(Top photo: Peter Powell/AFP via Getty Images)"
