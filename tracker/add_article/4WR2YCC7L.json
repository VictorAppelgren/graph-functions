      "summary": "Tesla’s sales momentum in China has slowed sharply, with deliveries falling 8.4% in July and retail volumes down about 12% YoY, while its market share dropped to 7.6% from a 15% peak in 2020. In the first half of 2025, China contributed $8.61 billion—down from $9.23 billion last year—making up 19% of quarterly revenue. To counter the decline, Elon Musk is partnering with Chinese AI firms DeepSeek and ByteDance’s Doubao to enhance in‑car tools, a move that follows his earlier criticism of DeepSeek. Tesla is also focusing on the new three‑row Model Y L, priced at $47,200, to regain market share and tap ride‑hailing opportunities later this year.",
