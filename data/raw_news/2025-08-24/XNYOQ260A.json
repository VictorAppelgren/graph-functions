  "description": "Your day-ahead look for Aug. 21, 2025",
  "content": "By Omkar Godbole (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) Crypto majors continue to trade in a choppy manner, with bitcoin (BTC) retreating to $113,600 after reaching $114,800 late Wednesday. Ether (ETH) and most major tokens also erased overnight gains as derivatives traders looked for downside protection ahead of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s highly anticipated speech at the Jackson Hole Symposium on Friday. Long-term sentiment for bitcoin, measured by an options market indicator, turned bearish for the first time since June 2023. Technical signals also point to a weakening short-term outlook. In a notable move, an OG wallet sold 660 BTC and opened long positions in ether worth $295 million across four wallets, reflecting growing preference for ETH over bitcoin and echoing a trend seen in derivatives markets. Heightened concerns over bitcoin\u2019s decentralization emerged after popular X account \"WhaleWire\" revealed that two mining pools, Foundry USA and Antpool, now control over 50% of the network\u2019s hashrate \u2014 the computing power validating transactions. This follows Qubic's recent claim it was able to make a 51% attack on Monero and planned an attempt on Dogecoin. Financial services platform Swan highlighted that market confidence was shaken by recent guidance from bitcoin holder Strategy, which said that it may issue equity to pay debt interest, fund preferred dividends or when deemed advantageous. Swan urged investors to focus on Strategy\u2019s $73 billion in BTC holdings and strong balance sheet, suggesting the company could cover dividend obligations for decades even if bitcoin\u2019s price fell more than 50%. \u201cHardly the picture of imminent collapse,\u201d Swan said on X. Rapper Kanye West launched a memecoin called YZY, which skyrocketed to a $3 billion market cap within minutes before quickly dropping back below $1 billion. This rapid surge and fall contrast with previous celebrity tokens like TRUMP and MELANIA, which held their hype for a day or two before crashing, indicating a steep decline in appetite for speculative tokens. In traditional markets, yield on Japanese government bonds continued to rise, increasing the risk of injecting volatility into global financial markets.

Space is limited. Use code CDB10 for 10% off your registration through Aug. 31.\n\u2022 YZY Money, a Solana memecoin tied to Ye (formerly Kanye West), debuted Thursday with a 6,800% surge in price before slipping under $1, indicative of the speculative churn around celebrity tokens.\n\u2022 The token announcement on Ye's X account sparked speculation of a hack before posting a video it which he appeared to confirm the launch. Questions remain whether the clip was AI-generated.\n\u2022 The token structure mirrors the TRUMP coin: 70% supply allocated to Ye, 10% to liquidity, 20% for sale. Insiders said Ye initially demanded 80% before agreeing to 70%.\n\u2022 Wallet data shows clear advance access. Wallet 6MNWV8 spent 450,611 USDC at $0.35, later selling some of its holding for $1.39 million to reap a $1.5 million profit when price gains on the remainder are included. Another whale bought $2.28 million worth and sits on $6 million in gains.\n\u2022 Liquidity was seeded single-sided with only YZY, allowing developers or large holders to withdraw value at will \u2014 a design critics liken to the controversial LIBRA token in Argentina.\n\u2022 Retail buyers absorbed the losses: One wallet lost nearly $500,000 within two hours after buying at $1.56 and exiting at $1.06.The episode highlights how insider-heavy allocations and liquidity gimmicks expose fans and traders, even as hype briefly drove the token's market cap toward $3 billion.\n\u2022 Wormhole challenged LayerZero\u2019s $110 million bid for Stargate with plans for a higher counteroffer, asking the community to delay its governance vote for five days to complete due diligence and ensure token holders evaluate both proposals on fair terms.\n\u2022 Stargate\u2019s appeal lies in scale: $4 billion processed in July, $345 million locked, and a treasury with $92 million in stablecoins and ether plus $55 million in STG and other assets.\n\u2022 LayerZero\u2019s proposal would transfer treasury and future revenue to itself, which critics say undervalues Stargate and shortchanges token holders.\n\u2022 Wormhole argues STG holders \u201cdeserve a more competitive process\u201d and positions its bid as delivering greater long-term value.\n\u2022 A merger would fuse Stargate\u2019s unified liquidity pools with Wormhole\u2019s integrations across dozens of blockchains, creating one of the largest cross-chain hubs.\n\u2022 The Wormhole Foundation claims such a combination would \u201cunlock unrealized value\u201d and drive both immediate and lasting benefits for STG and Wormhole token holders.\n\u2022 The growth in BTC and ETH futures open interest stalled at levels above 700K BTC and 14.2 million ETH, which is consistent with the directionless trading in spot prices before the start of the central bankers' confab at Jackson Hole.\n\u2022 Open interest in LINK futures remains near record highs, with the token price rising to nearly $27 on Wednesday, the most since January. Other top 10 tokens, excluding BNB, saw open interest fall in the past 24 hours.\n\u2022 HYPE leads crypto majors with annualized funding rates exceeding 25%. That shows traders are increasingly seeking bullish exposure in the token.\n\u2022 On CME, the recovery in the BTC futures noted on Wednesday has stalled, with the three-month premium receding to nearly 7%. Meanwhile, ether futures OI continues to grow and is nearing the 2 million ETH mark. These diverging trends point to a growing institutional preference for ether over bitcoin.\n\u2022 On Deribit, the 180-day bitcoin options skew dipped to -0.42, indicating the strongest demand for put options, or downside insurance, since June 2023. Longer-dated ETH options continued to show a bias for calls.\n\u2022 Flows over the OTC network Paradigm featured demand for BTC puts financed by selling calls and mixed activity in the ether options market.\n\u2022 Volmex's seven-day implied volatility indices for bitcoin and ether have remained steady at around 36% and 70%, respectively, indicating that the market does not anticipate a significant volatility spike from the Jackson Hole event.\n\u2022 BTC is down 0.84% from 4 p.m. ET Wednesday at $113,434.22 (24hrs: -0.4%)\n\u2022 ETH is down 1.68% at $4,283.19 (24hrs: +1.23%)\n\u2022 CoinDesk 20 is down 1.44% at 4,019.84 (24hrs: +0.69%)\n\u2022 Ether CESR Composite Staking Rate is down 1 bp at 2.93%\n\u2022 BTC funding rate is at 0.0074% (8.0548% annualized) on Binance\n\u2022 Gold futures are down 0.20% at $3,381.60\n\u2022 Silver futures are down 0.13% at $37.72\n\u2022 Euro Stoxx 50 is down 0.3% at 5,455.71\n\u2022 U.S. 10-Year Treasury rate is up 1.4 bps at 4.31%\n\u2022 E-mini S&P 500 futures are down 0.11% at 6,406.50\n\u2022 E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average Index are down 0.26% at 44,880.00\n\u2022 The daily chart for e-mini futures tied to the Nasdaq 100 show that the longer duration MACD (50,100,9) has turned negative for the first time since April. The negative crossover indicates a bullish-to-bearish shift in momentum.\n\u2022 The RSI recently diverged bearishly as it produced a lower high last week, contradicting the new peak in prices. The indicator is on the verge of falling below 50 to suggest strengthening of the downside momentum.\n\u2022 Together, the two indicators suggest more losses ahead for technology stocks.\n\u2022 Cryptocurrencies are known to closely track movements in Nasdaq.\n\u2022 Strategy (MSTR): closed on Wednesday at $344.37 (+2.32%), -0.69% at $342 in pre-market\n\u2022 The chart shows two mining pools, Foundry USA and Antpool, account for nearly 50% of the computing power dedicated to the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\u2022 The concentration of hashrate has raised concerns about centralization on social media. While You Were Sleeping\n\u2022 Talk of Boots on the Ground in Ukraine Sparks Unease in Germany (Reuters): German Chancellor Merz kept the option of sending troops to Ukraine open, but the country's history, past overseas setbacks, economic strain and fears of military overextension make it a politically fraught move.\n\u2022 Key Bitcoin Indicators Hint at Bearish Regime Shift as Jackson Hole Nears (CoinDesk): Options markets show stronger demand for downside protection, while bitcoin has slipped beneath key trend levels, pointing to weakening sentiment despite only a modest price pullback.\n\u2022 Canada Cultivates Nordic Connections to Offset Its Reliance on U.S. Trade (Financial Times): Canada is boosting defense and trade ties with Finland and Sweden, including icebreakers and fighter jets, to lessen reliance on the U.S. following Trump\u2019s annexation and tariff threats.\n\u2022 DBS Launches Tokenized Structured Notes on Ethereum, Expanding Investor Access (CoinDesk): The Singapore-based bank is breaking down $100,000 structured notes into $1,000 tokenized units on Ethereum, making them tradable for accredited and institutional investors via Singapore exchanges ADDX, DigiFT and HydraX.\n\u2022 Windtree\u2019s BNB Treasury Bet Collides With Nasdaq Delisting Order (CoinDesk): Windtree\u2019s sub-$1 share price forced a Nasdaq delisting, leaving its $200 million BNB treasury plan in limbo as it scrambles to shift trading to over-the-counter markets under its existing \"WINT\" ticker.\n\u2022 Trump Orders Pentagon to Deploy Three Warships Against Latin American Drug Cartels (The Wall Street Journal): The Navy\u2019s guided-missile destroyers will be tasked with intercepting drug shipments off South America\u2019s coast, including near Venezuela, marking a shift from their usual supporting role to the Coast Guard.",

It later posted a video showing Ye talking about and confirming the issuance (it is unclear if it is the real Ye or an AI generation).\nThe token briefly touched $3.16 in early trading \u2014 a surge of nearly 6,800% from its issue price \u2014 with some trackers claiming it briefly commanded a $3 billion market cap.\nBehind the frenzy supposedly sits the broader YZY ecosystem, which Ye\u2019s team has pitched as including a YZY token, a Ye Pay processor for transactions, and a YZY Card for global spending of YZY and USDC.\nYZY\u2019s structure was first revealed by CoinDesk in February, which reported that 70% of supply would go directly to Ye personally, with 10% for liquidity and 20% for public sale.\nAt the time, insiders said Ye had initially demanded an 80% stake \u2014 the same allocation structure tied to Donald Trump\u2019s TRUMP token \u2014 before being negotiated down. The project has also carried heavy baggage from the start. Ye had previously declared that \u201ccoins prey on the fans with hype\u201d before backtracking and approving YZY.\nSources told CoinDesk the token was meant to mimic TRUMP\u2019s success, even as Argentina was roiled by a similar scandal when President Javier Milei\u2019s endorsed LIBRA coin collapsed as a pump-and-dump.\nCritics flagged then \u2014 and now \u2014 that such insider-heavy distributions tilt risk squarely toward retail buyers, especially when paired with a single-sided liquidity pool.\nThe token distribution shows 20% allocated to the public, 10% to liquidity, and 70% to Yeezy Investments LLC, locked for 24 months under a structured vesting arrangement via Jupiter Lock.\nTo prevent bot-driven manipulation, 25 contract addresses were initially deployed, with only one randomly selected as the official token. That 1-in-25 anti-sniping setup was billed as a fairer launch \u2014 but on-chain data suggests insiders still had advance access.\n\u2014 Darren Lau (@Darrenlautf) August 21, 2025\nAnalytics account Lookonchain identified wallet 6MNWV8 as knowing the contract address in advance. The wallet even attempted to buy YZY before launch. Once live, it spent 450,611 USDC to acquire 1.29 million tokens at roughly $0.35 each. It later sold 1.04 million YZY for 1.39 million USDC, leaving 249,907 tokens worth about $600,000 \u2014 booking a profit of more than $1.5 million.\n\u201cInsider wallet 6MNWV8 knew the contract address in advance and even tried buying yesterday,\u201d Lookonchain wrote on X.\nye(@kanyewest) launched the $YZY token. Note:\n\u2014 Lookonchain (@lookonchain) August 21, 2025\nOnly $YZY was added to the liquidity pool with no $USDC.\nDev may sell $YZY by adding/removing liquidity, similar to $LIBRA.\nMultiple insider wallets prepared funds in advance and immediately bought $YZY.\nInsider wallet 6MNWV8 knew\u2026 pic.twitter.com/qv7nsx0R4J\nOnChain Lens flagged an even larger whale who invested 12,170 SOL (about $2.28 million) for 2.67 million YZY.

Weeks later, the Securities and Exchange Commission ordered it delisted.\nWhat to know:\n- Windtree Therapeutics will be delisted from the Nasdaq on August 21 due to failing to meet the $1 minimum bid price requirement.\n- The company plans to transition to over-the-counter trading, though it cannot guarantee the success of this move.\n- Windtree's shares plummeted nearly 80% after the delisting announcement, closing at 11 cents.\nWindtree Therapeutics\u2019 high-profile plan to raise up to $200 million for a BNB (BNB) treasury has run headlong into a market reality check: the Nasdaq is kicking it off the exchange.\nThe Warrington, Pennsylvania-based biotech disclosed in a Tuesday filing that the Nasdaq Capital Market will suspend trading in its shares effective Aug. 21 after the company failed to meet the $1 minimum bid price required under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).\nWindtree expects to transition to over-the-counter trading under its existing symbol \u201cWINT,\u201d though it cannot guarantee that the plan will go through, it said in a filing.\nThe delisting undercuts Windtree\u2019s July announcement that it would become the first Nasdaq-listed company to build a BNB treasury.\nAt the time, the company unveiled a $60 million securities purchase agreement with blockchain infrastructure investor Build and Build Corp., with the potential to scale the program to $200 million. Shares surged more than 20% in pre-market trading after the news last month, but the company could not maintain the important $1 mark to maintain its listing.\nWindtree's stock slumped through most of late July and August, trading at 48 cents before the delisting announcement.\nThe move was positioned as an echo of Michael Saylor\u2019s Strategy (MSTR), which has turned its balance sheet into a bitcoin proxy. But unlike Strategy, which remains a Nasdaq bellwether, Windtree will now be relegated to OTC markets, limiting its visibility and institutional reach.\nShares dropped nearly 80% after the company disclosed the delisting order, and closed at 11 cents.\nRead more: Biotech Company Windtree to Raise Up to $200M for BNB Treasury\nSam Reynolds\nSam Reynolds is a senior reporter based in Asia.

stipulates the conditions for\ngender change in Japan is unconstitutional.\nIn response to this, concerns have been raised that \"men who identify themselves as\nwomen may enter women's restrooms and commit crimes,\" and that \"women's safety and\nsecurity may be at risk.\"\nIn response to these concerns, we are considering submitting the bill to ensure a safe and\nsecure environment for women.\n\uff12\uff0eOutline of the bill\nFor public baths and changing rooms etc., which are used by many people without wearing\nclothes, measures will be taken by the relevant ministries and managers of such facilities,\nregarding the separate use of facilities by men and women, based on the premise that men\nand women are distinguished by physical characteristics.\nIn facilities that are normally used by men and women separately, such as restrooms,\nmanagers of such facilities will be required to make efforts to take necessary measures,\nsuch as providing necessary equipments and patrols, to ensure a safe and secure\nenvironment for women to use the facilities.\nEducation: BA in Sociology, Cairo University (October 1976)\nCareer\nJuly 2024: Re-elected to a third term as

The number of single-family offices in the city-state topped 2,000 in 2024, up 43% year on year, it said in a release.\nThe move comes as Singapore deepens its role as a hub for tokenized finance. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been advancing industry pilots through Project Guardian, which explores tokenization of assets across fixed income, FX and funds, while developing cross-border infrastructure like Global Layer One to pool global liquidity.\nDBS has been one of the most active banks participating in these initiatives, often using permissioned blockchains for pilots before expanding into public chains.\nWhile the initial focus is on crypto-linked notes, DBS said it will also tokenize more traditional equity- and credit-linked notes.\n\u201cAsset tokenization is the next frontier of financial markets infrastructure,\u201d said Li Zhen, head of foreign exchange and digital assets at DBS.\n\u201cOur first tokenized product addresses the growing institutional appetite for digital assets. With this initiative, a broader segment of investors can now tap our digital asset ecosystem to build exposure to the asset class,\u201d Zhen continued.\nSam Reynolds\nSam Reynolds is a senior reporter based in Asia.

The last time this occurred, in January, the bitcoin rally lost momentum near $110,000, eventually leading to a deep sell-off in March and early April.\nHere's another sign of investor disquiet: Spot bitcoin and ether ETFs registered almost $1 billion in total net outflows on Tuesday.\n\"At this stage, the market broadly expects cuts, so much of that is already priced in,\" Nicolai Sondergaard, a research analyst at Nansen, said in an email, referring to U.S. interest rates. \"If Powell delivers exactly what\u2019s anticipated, crypto could see sideways-to-slightly-bearish action, a classic 'sell the news' dynamic.\"\nSondergaard said markets will likely rally if Powell signals deeper or faster-than-expected rate cuts.

This puts it among a small list of platforms earning high revenues in the crypto space.\nPump originally collected fees when tokens \u201cgraduated\u201d to Raydium, but now earns from its in-house DEX, PumpSwap. The model has proven sticky despite competition.\nLetsBonk briefly overtook Pump in graduated tokens last month, driven by its Raydium LaunchLab integration and Bonk community push, but lost ground as top memecoin deployers migrated back to Pump.\nPump\u2019s token ICO last month raised $600 million in 12 minutes, with the platform now running buybacks above market price to stabilize trading. This is indicative of how the launchpad has become an asset in itself.\nIn contrast, LetsBonk revenue has collapsed to under $30,000 a day from around $1 million earlier this month, showing the volatility of memecoin platforms competing for flow.\nNew entrant Token Mill is trying to stand out with a \u201cKing of the Mill\u201d mechanism in which fees are used to buy and burn the highest-volume token every 30 minutes. The aim is to gamify volatility as a growth loop.\nSolana, meanwhile, lost its crown as the dominant memecoin chain to Coinbase's Base, which has tied token issuance into decentralized social media via Zora. On Monday, Base hosted nearly 58,000 new memecoins versus 33,000 on Solana.\nDerivatives Positioning\nLeveraged crypto futures bets worth $448 million have been liquidated in the past 24 hours. Most were longs, which means significant bullish leverage has been cleared from the market.\nOpen interest in BTC, DOGE and XRP has declined, indicating that the price drop has yet to trigger a surge in new bearish bets.\nMeanwhile, LINK, HYPE and SUI have seen increases in open interest, while OI has held flat in ETH, according to data source Coinglass.\nPerpetual funding rates for most major cryptocurrencies continue to remain mildly positive, indicating a bias towards long positions. The opposite is the case for ADA and XMR.\nSolana futures open interest on CME remains elevated near record highs above 4.6 million SOL, with the annualized three-month premium rising to 16% from 12% last week. The uptick indicates bullish capital inflows.\nBTC open interest is beginning to recover, now at 145.76K BTC, the highest since late July. Premium remains below 10%. In ETH's case, the premium again faded the spike above 10%, with open interest approaching the 2 million ETH mark.\nOn Deribit, short-dated (one-week) and near-dated (coming months) BTC and ETH puts continue to trade at a premium to calls, reflecting concerns about downside risks.\nFlows over the OTC network Paradigm featured increased activity in put options tied to bitcoin and ether, with activity across outrights, spreads, and calendar spread strategies.\nMarket Movements\nBTC is up 0.4% from 4 p.m. ET Tuesday at $113,757.49 (24hrs: -1.53%)\nETH is up 1.55% at $4,217.10 (24hrs: -1.62%)\nCoinDesk 20 is up 1.06% at 3,983.85 (24hrs: -2.26%)\nEther CESR Composite Staking Rate is up 2 bps at 2.94%\nBTC funding rate is at 0.0022% (2.4276% annualized) on Binance\nDXY is unchanged at 98.29\nGold futures are up 0.29% at $3,368.50\nSilver futures are down 0.70% at $37.07\nNikkei 225 closed down 1.51% at 42,888.55\nHang Seng closed up 0.17% at 25,165.94\nFTSE is up 0.17% at 9,204.66\nEuro Stoxx 50 is unchanged at 5,483.55\nDJIA closed on Tuesday unchanged at 44,922.27\nS&P 500 closed down 0.59% at 6,411.37\nNasdaq Composite closed down 1.46% at 21,314.95\nS&P/TSX Composite closed down 0.35% at 27,823.88\nS&P 40 Latin America closed down 2.02% at 2,637.60\nU.S. 10-Year Treasury rate is down 0.7 bps at 4.295%\nE-mini S&P 500 futures are down 0.14% at 6,423.50\nE-mini Nasdaq-100 futures are down 0.18% at 23,427.50\nE-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average Index are down 0.18% at 44,919.00\nBitcoin Stats\nBTC Dominance: 59.8% (+0.48%)\nEther-bitcoin ratio: 0.0371 (2.74%)\nHashrate (seven-day moving average): 962 EH/s\nHashprice (spot): $55.71\nTotal fees: 3.27 BTC / $374,274\nCME Futures Open Interest: 145,760 BTC\nBTC priced in gold: 34.2 oz.\nBTC vs gold market cap: 9.68%\nTechnical Analysis\nWhile the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes recently rallied above their January highs, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) has yet to do so.\nThe daily chart shows the DJIA bulls are struggling to establish a foothold above the trendline connecting December-February highs.\nAs a barometer of risk appetite, a turn lower could add to the bearish momentum in cryptocurrencies.\nCrypto Equities\nStrategy (MSTR): closed on Tuesday at $336.57 (-7.43%), +7.91% at $363.19 in pre-market\nCoinbase Global (COIN): closed at $302.07 (-5.82%), +5.93% at $319.98\nCircle (CRCL): closed at $135.23 (-4.49%), +5.98% at $143.31\nGalaxy Digital (GLXY): closed at $24.09 (-10.06%), +10.23% at $26.56\nBullish (BLSH): closed at $59.51 (-6.09%), +3.68% at $61.70\nMARA Holdings (MARA): closed at $15.17 (-5.72%), +6.46% at $16.15\nRiot Platforms (RIOT): closed at $11.96 (-2.92%), +3.09% at $12.33\nCore Scientific (CORZ): closed at $14.35 (-1.24%), +0.63% at $14.44\nCleanSpark (CLSK): closed at $9.36 (-4.88%), +5.13% at $9.84\nCoinShares Valkyrie Bitcoin Miners ETF (WGMI): closed at $26.6 (-5.97%), +5.30% at $28.01\nSemler Scientific (SMLR): closed at $31.89 (-5.55%), +5.07% at $33.50\nExodus Movement (EXOD): closed at $27.1 (+1.96%), -1.37% at $26.73\nSharpLink Gaming (SBET): closed at $18.38 (-8.65%), +6.42% at $19.56\nUK Bitcoin ETNs Could Be a Bigger Deal Than People Expect (CoinDesk): Crypto ETNs, banned by the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority in January 2021, return on Oct. 8.

A negative call-put skew suggests that traders are pricing in greater demand for put options (which offer protection against price declines) relative to call options. The data can be interpreted as rising market caution or bearish sentiment over the medium term.\n\"BTC longer dated skew flipping into put premium could be a sign of regime shift,\" Imran Lakha, founder of Options Insights, said on X.\nThe negative reading comes across as a regime shift, as it follows two years of consistently positive values, which reflected a bias toward bullish call options.\nMore importantly, BTC has only pulled back by roughly 8% from its record highs above $124,000, which were reached a week ago. Yet, the long-term sentiment has flipped bearish.\nAccording to Lakha, the price pullback has triggered demand for put options.\n\"BTC and ETH skews are pulling toward put premium as markets correct. BTC doesn\u2019t show a call premium again until March 2026. The move lower triggered buying of August/September puts around the $110,000 strike. Calls and call spreads are being sold as longs de-risk into Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole speech on Friday,\" Lakha said in a blog post.\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at the central bank's annual Jackson Hole Symposium on Friday. Most traders expect Powell to signal rate cuts starting from September and if he gives what's expected, the market may correct, according to Nansen's research analyst Nicolai Sondergaard.\n\"At this stage, the market broadly expects cuts, so much of that is already priced in. If Powell delivers exactly what\u2019s anticipated, crypto could see sideways to slightly bearish action, a classic \u201csell the news\u201d dynamic. By contrast, if the Fed signals a deeper or faster cutting cycle than expected, that could spark fresh risk appetite and set the stage for the next bullish leg in crypto,\" Sondergaard said.\nStock traders chase puts\nThe demand for downside protection in BTC is consistent with the activity on Wall Street, where traders have been preparing for a sell-off in the major technology stocks.\n\"Traders are buying 'disaster' puts on the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 Index,\" Jeff Jacobson, head of derivative strategy at 22V Research Group, told Bloomberg.\nGuppy multiple moving average indicator\nThe second indicator pointing to a bearish shift in the regime is the Guppy multiple moving average (GMMA) indicator.\nDeveloped by Australian trader Daryl Guppy, the indicator is used to identify reversals and assess trend strength by analyzing the bands formed by short-term and long-term moving averages. A bullish cross occurs when the green band representing short-term moving averages crosses above the red band of long-term moving averages, indicating that upward momentum is gathering pace.\nBTC's price has crossed below the Guppy moving average bands, a sign that bulls are losing control and the long-term sentiment may be turning bearish. This is often considered a warning sign that downside momentum is about to strengthen, paving the way for pronounced price weakness.\nOther indicators, such as the MACD histogram, also suggest a strengthening of the downside momentum.\nRead more: Bitcoin Hovers at $113K; Solana and Dogecoin Lead Gains Ahead of Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole Speech\nOmkar Godbole\nOmkar Godbole is a Co-Managing Editor and analyst on CoinDesk's Markets team.

  "argos_summary": "Crypto majors traded sideways as Bitcoin slid to $113,600 and Ether fell after traders sought downside protection ahead of Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole speech. Options data shows a shift to bearish sentiment, with BTC\u2019s long\u2011dated skew turning negative for the first time since June 2023, while ETH options remain bullish.
