The Financial Statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, and related MD&A have been reviewed and approved by the Company's Audit Committee and Board of Directors. For a more detailed explanation and analysis, please refer to the MD&A that has been filed on SEDAR+ at www.sedarplus.ca and is also available on the Company's website at www.light.ai. Non-IFRS and Other Financial Measures This press release refers to the following non-IFRS measures: \"Adjusted Working Capital\" is comprised as current assets less current liabilities. Management believes Adjusted Working Capital is a useful indicator for investors, and is used by management, for evaluating the operating liquidity to the Company. See \"Adjusted Working Capital Reconciliation\" for a quantitative reconciliation of Adjusted Working Capital to the most directly comparable financial measure. Such non-IFRS measures and non-IFRS ratio do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and may not be comparable to a similar measure disclosed by other issuers. Light AI Inc. is a technology company focused on developing artificial intelligence health screening and diagnostic solutions. Light AI is developing a technology platform which represents the next generation of patient management: it applies AI algorithms to smartphone images\u2014starting with images of Strep A and anticipated expansion with COVID19 along with other medical conditions \u2014to identify the disease in seconds. Its patented, app-based solution requires no swabs, lab tests or proprietary hardware of any kind\u2014its hardware platform is the 4.5 billion smartphones that exist in the world today. Light AI is at the forefront of developing innovative screening and diagnostic solutions aimed at improving healthcare delivery worldwide. Their cutting-edge AI powered technology offers rapid, accurate, and cost-effective screening and diagnostic tools designed to address critical healthcare challenges. In pre-FDA validation studies, Light AI's algorithm demonstrated remarkable accuracy in differentiating between viral and bacterial pharyngitis, specifically targeting Group A Streptococcus (GAS). The algorithm achieved a 96.57% accuracy rate and attained a Negative Predictive Value of 100%, indicating its high reliability in confirming the absence of Streptococcus A infection. Viral and GAS pharyngitis affects over 600 million people annually worldwide. If left untreated, GAS pharyngitis can lead to serious complications such as Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD), which imposes a global economic burden exceeding $1 trillion annually. Light AI's technology offers a significant advancement in the accurate and timely identification of GAS pharyngitis, potentially reducing the incidence of RHD and its associated costs. Light AI's approach to applying AI to smartphone images can be expanded to other throat conditions, as well as other areas of analysis, such as the human eye and skin. Light AI's vision is to combine the smartphone with AI in-the-Cloud to create a Digital Clinical Lab that provides quick and accessible diagnosis for countless conditions that today require expensive and time-consuming imaging or lab processes. Light AI's commercial launch of its consumer-facing Wellness App initial offering is anticipated to be available in North America in Q3 2025.

Here's how it's changing healthcare. Scientific breakthroughs enabled by AI received recognition with two Nobel Prizes in 2024. John Hopfield, and Geoffrey Hinton whose widely regarded as the 'Godfather of AI,' were both honoured with the Nobel Prize in Physics for their fundamental discoveries and inventions in ML, which underpin today's boom in AI. In healthcare, AI has made waves in drug discovery. But it's also quietly reshaping another critical area: diagnostics. This is where Light AI is making its mark. Diagnostics are complex, context-rich, and vital to patient care \u2014 yet this area receives just 2% of global healthcare funding. This underinvestment presents an opportunity for real change and scalable impact. AI is uniquely positioned to master this domain \u2014 and who knows? The next healthcare breakthrough that wins a Nobel Prize might come from this very space.\n-\n\ud83c\udfe5 The last time you visited an emergency room, how long did you wait? Now flip that question around: How long did you wait before deciding to go...because you knew there'd be a wait? It can be frustrating to visit and leave with never having needed to be there in the first place. And it can also be devastating to end up finding out you should've been there sooner. George Reznik and Sheldon Chang shared at CEM in Bermuda this weekend how the above scenario can be mitigated with Light AI's app, being released in the Fall. The app is primed to be able to detect a wide range of diseases in the long-term.

(CBOE CA: ALGO / FSE: 0HC / OTCQB: OHCFF)\nLight AI Inc. is a technology company focused on developing artificial intelligence health screening and diagnostic solutions. Light AI is developing a technology platform which represents the next generation of patient management: it applies AI algorithms to smartphone images\u2014starting with images of Strep A and anticipated expansion with COVID19 along with other medical conditions \u2014to identify the disease in seconds. Its patented, app-based solution requires no swabs, lab tests or proprietary hardware of any kind\u2014its hardware platform is the 4.5 billion smartphones that exist in the world today. Light AI is at the forefront of developing innovative screening and diagnostic solutions aimed at improving healthcare delivery worldwide. Their cutting-edge AI powered technology offers rapid, accurate, and cost-effective screening and diagnostic tools designed to address critical healthcare challenges.\nIn pre-FDA validation studies, Light AI's algorithm demonstrated remarkable accuracy in differentiating between viral and bacterial pharyngitis, specifically targeting Group A Streptococcus (GAS). The algorithm achieved a 96.57% accuracy rate and attained a Negative Predictive Value of 100%, indicating its high reliability in confirming the absence of Streptococcus A infection. Viral and GAS pharyngitis affects over 600 million people annually worldwide. If left untreated, GAS pharyngitis can lead to serious complications such as Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD), which imposes a global economic burden exceeding $1 trillion annually. Light AI's technology offers a significant advancement in the accurate and timely identification of GAS pharyngitis, potentially reducing the incidence of RHD and its associated costs. Light AI's approach to applying AI to smartphone images can be expanded to other throat conditions, as well as other areas of analysis, such as the human eye and skin. Light AI's vision is to combine the smartphone with AI in-the-Cloud to create a Digital Clinical Lab that provides quick and accessible diagnosis for countless conditions that today require expensive and time-consuming imaging or lab processes. Light AI's commercial launch of its consumer-facing Wellness App initial offering is anticipated to be available in North America in Q3 2025.\nON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY\n\"George Reznik\"\nGeorge Reznik\nChief Financial Officer\nTelephone: 604-307-6800\nEmail: [email protected]\nFor more information, please contact the Company at [email protected] or visit https://light.ai/.\nWebsite: https://light.ai/\nLinkedIn: LinkedIn/company/Light AI\nX (Formerly Twitter): @lightaihealth\nForward-Looking Information:\nThis news release includes information, statements, beliefs and opinions which are forward-looking, and which reflect current estimates, expectations and projections about future events, including, but not limited to, the Company's research and development and commercialization initiatives, the anticipated inflection of the business, the Company's financial and operational performance and outlook and other statements that contain words such as \"believe,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"should,\" \"seek,\" \"anticipate,\" \"will,\" \"intend,\" \"positioned,\" \"risk,\" \"plan,\" \"may,\" \"estimate\" or, in each case, their negative and words of similar meaning.
