      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: After winning Series Mania\u2019s Best Actress Award for her turn opposite Cooper Raiff in Mubi\u2019s Hal & Harper, Lili Reinhart has come aboard to star in and exec produce The Love Hypothesis, an adaptation of the New York Times bestseller by Ali Hazelwood, for Amazon MGM Studios and MRC.\nIn the romantic comedy, Olive Smith, a biology PhD candidate, and Dr. Adam Carlsen, a hotshot professor and well-known tyrant, enter into a fake relationship, seeing each of their carefully calculated theories on love get thrown into chaos.\nPublished by Berkley, an imprint of Penguin Random House, Hazelwood\u2019s novel spent 10 months on the New York Times bestseller list, breaking out internationally in 40 countries. Originally acquired for publication by editor Sarah Blumenstock at Berkley, the book was also named the Best Romance of the Year by Amazon. Hazelwood is also known for titles like Problematic Summer Romance, Deep End, and Bride, among others.\nWatch on Deadline\nClaire Scanlon (Set It Up) is directing The Love Hypothesis from a script by Sarah Rothschild (The Sleepover). Elizabeth Cantillon (The Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web, Charlie\u2019s Angels) is producing, with Reinhart, Catherine Hagedorn, and Hazelwood executive producing.\nIn a statement accompanying the project announcement, author Hazelwood said, \u201cHonestly, I still can\u2019t believe this is happening? Elizabeth Cantillon, Claire Scanlon, and Lili Reinhart have all created, produced, or starred in works that I\u2019m absolutely feral about, and I am beyond honored that they\u2019re choosing to bring their talent to this project. Books and films are very different media, and I have complete trust in this brilliant team. I cannot wait to see the final product they\u2019ll come up with. I hope they have as much fun filming as I had while writing the book.\u201d\nSoon to be seen starring opposite Raiff and Mark Ruffalo in the former\u2019s indie TV series Hal & Harper, a project she produced which was acquired by MUBI following its premiere at Sundance, Reinhart\u2019s upcoming slate also includes Uta Briesewitz\u2019s American Sweatshop, which premiered at SXSW this year. She recently wrapped on Brian Swibel\u2019s directorial debut, The Very Best People, as well as Meredith Alloway\u2019s first feature, Forbidden Fruits, which IFC Films will release in 2026. She\u2019s also attached to produce and star in Ali & Anthony Garland\u2019s Fake Wedding, which is in development at Amazon MGM under her production company, Small Victory, and is represented by Anonymous Content, UTA, and Peikoff Mahan.\nReuniting with Amazon MGM here after directing The People We Hate at the Wedding, starring Allison Janney, Kristen Bell, and Ben Platt, Scanlon is also known for helming the Netflix rom-com Set It Up, starring Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell. Most recently, she directed episodes of Loot and Palm Royale for Apple TV+, Abbott Elementary for ABC, and produced and directed Season 2 of Unstable for Netflix. She is repped by UTA, 3 Arts, and Jared Levine.\nRothschild wrote The Sleepover, which was sold in a bidding war to Netflix, and stars Malin Akerman, Ken Marino, and Joe Manganiello. The film was directed by Trish Sie and earned her a WGA Award. After recently turning in her draft of Splash at Disney, she is currently writing projects for Paramount and Walden Media. She is represented by Verve, Entertainment 360, and attorney Kim Stenton at Myman Greenspan.\nHazelwood is repped by the Sandra Dijkstra Literary Agency and UTA.\nThis was star wars fanfiction. The only correct casting was daisy and adam. I\u2019m not gonna knock it until i\u2019ve seen it but Lili is such a different vibe that I can\u2019t picture what the final vision for this is\nShe\u2019s great but this is a miscast.\nTotally agree. I love her but she isn\u2019t Olive!\nLil is a force of nature- smart and a great actress-\nTotally agree, I been a fan of hers since Riverdale not only I want to see her more but also her Riverdale costars Camila Mendes and Madelaine Petsch as well."
