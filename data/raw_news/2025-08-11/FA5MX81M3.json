  "content": "Shrek 5 has been delayed until 2027 with a new date that's over six months after its previously planned date. Variety reports that Shrek 5 has been moved off its latest release date of December 23, 2026 to a June 30, 2027 release. Cumulatively, that marks nearly a full year of delays for Shrek 5, which was originally announced for a July 2026 release.\n\nDreamworks has offered up no reason for the delay, though a cynical perspective may be that it could be tied to criticism over the designs that have been shown for Shrek 5, which have evolved from the original portrayal.\n\nThat new date is within a week of the newly revised release date for Sony's animated sequel Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse, itself the subject of multiple delays since its initial announcement. While Beyond the Spider-Verse will arrive four years after the previous film in the series, Across the Spider-Verse, that's nothing compared to Shrek 5, which will release 17 years after the previous installment in the franchise, 2010's Shrek Ever After.\n\nThe Shrek series, which first debuted all the way back in 2001, has so far spawned four films in the core series, as well as two spinoff movies starring Antonio Banderas' dashing Puss in Boots. Original cast members Mike Meyers (Shrek), Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona), and Eddie Murphy (Donkey) are all set to reprise their classic roles for the sequel.\n\nAlongside Shrek 5, Dreamworks is apparently prepping a solo movie for Eddie Murphy's Donkey, one of the most beloved characters of the Shrek series due to his endlessly cheerful nature and comic relief.\n\nWhile we wait, check out our list of the best animated movies that aren\u2019t Disney.",

      "text": "Shrek 5: release date, plot, trailer, news, and more\nHere is everything you need to know about Shrek 5, baby\nShrek 5 is on its way to the big screen next year, even though 2010's Shrek Forever After was supposedly the final movie in the franchise. Not that we're complaining, of course \u2013 good things come to those who wait.\nPlus, not only is a fifth installment on the way, but there's also a standalone Donkey movie in the works, with none other than Eddie Murphy returning.\nWe may have over a year before we return to the swamp, but that hasn't stopped us from putting together your complete guide to everything we know so far about Shrek 5, from the movie's release date, a list of every confirmed cast member, and the lowdown on the first teaser trailer.\nShrek 5 release date\nShrek 5 is set to hit theaters on December 23, 2026.\nThis marks 16 years since the fourth film, Shrek Forever After, premiered. Before the franchise was put on hiatus, each sequel had a three-year gap: after Shrek premiered in 2001, Shrek 2 was released in 2004, with Shrek the Third following in 2007, and the fourth sequel was released in 2010. The franchise spin-off Puss in Boots hit theaters in 2011, with its sequel arriving 11 years later in 2022.\nAs Eddie Murphy confirmed last year, a standalone Donkey spin-off is on the way, though we don't know when the film will premiere. The voice acting for Shrek 5 was completed in 2024, and as of right now, we don't have confirmation as to whether or not Donkey has entered production. Still, we can speculate a 2027 or 2028 release date for that spin-off, as Murphy made sure to note that the films are \"[not happening] at the same time.\"\nShrek 5 plot speculation\nShrek Forever After took a pre-MCU multiverse turn, what with Rumpelstiltskin transporting Shrek into an alternate reality where he was never born (it's giving Spider-Man: No Way Home, actually) and no one knows who he is. Of course, he manages to save the day and return to his regular timeline and swamp. The end credits do not end with a musical number this time, but instead a cover of The Monkees' \"I'm a Believer\" (which was covered by Smash Mouth for the first film and sung to Fiona by Shrek in the musical medley mid-credits scene.)\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nAll that said, the official plot for the film has not yet been released \u2013 but we have a feeling it will focus on Felicia, Shrek and Fiona's only daughter, going off on her own treacherous adventure and introducing us to a new batch of magical characters.\nWe do know, however, that the story is in good hands: Michael McCullers, former Saturday Night Live scribe and writer of Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me and The Bossy Baby, has penned the script. Walt Dohrn and Conrad Vernon are directing, along with director Brad Ableson. Dohrn, who also voices the Gingerbread Man aka Gingy, wrote Shrek 2, and Vernon directed Shrek 2.\nThere's also a bit of a plot hole since we saw three ogre babies in Shrek Forever After, Fergus, Farkle, and Felicia, and the teaser trailer seems to suggest that Felicia is Shrek and Fiona's one and only child. However, it's likely that Felicia is the only offspring to appear in the teaser because it was, after all, a casting announcement to welcome Zendaya to the Shrek franchise. Whether we see Fergus and Farkle in Shrek 5 remains to be seen, but we'll just have to wait for the next trailer.\nIt's also worth mentioning that Donkey and Dragon had multiple dronkey babies \u2013 and they'd be well into their teen years by now. Here's hoping we get to meet them as well.\nIs there a Shrek 5 trailer?\nDreamWorks uploaded the first look at Shrek 5 as a \"cast announcement,\" but we'll accept it as our first teaser trailer for now.\nIn the teaser, Donkey, Shrek, Fiona, and their daughter Felicia stand around Mirror, who shows the family a few Shrek memes \u2013 one of which is that super popular internet one where Shrek is Godzilla-level height and wearing a latex suit. Pinocchio then admits to creating the memes, and some on-screen text informs us that Zendaya is indeed doing the voice of Felicia.\nThe brief clip, which can be viewed above, is only 27 seconds in length and leaves much to be desired. We'll likely get an official trailer later in the year as we get closer and closer to the 2026 release date.\nThere were some mixed reactions from fans, with many questioning why the animation looked different. The animation team behind Sonic even chimed in, posting a TikTok that shows the transition from \"Ugly Sonic\" to the softer, cuter version that ended up in the franchise. We have a feeling DreamWorks will make some tweaks before the new movie arrives.\nShrek 5 cast\nThe aforementioned casting announcement confirmed that Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy would indeed be back to voice their original characters, with Zendaya signing on as Felicia. We can also infer from the clip that Chris Miller, who has done the voice of Mirror for all four films (and directed Shrek the Third), and Cody Cameron, who has been the franchise voice of Pinocchio, have returned.\nAbsent from the announcement, however, is Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots. Given that Puss in Boots had a second standalone movie just three years ago, it's hard to imagine he won't be making an appearance in Shrek 5. I'm hopeful that he'll appear in a later trailer or announcement.\nBelow is the confirmed Shrek 5 cast list so far:\n- Mike Myers as Shrek\n- Cameron Diaz as Fiona\n- Eddie Murphy as Donkey\n- Zendaya as Felicia, Shrek and Fiona's daughter\n- Conrad Vernon as the Gingerbread Man\nWhere can you stream the Shrek movies?\nShrek, Shrek 2, and Shrek the Third are available to stream on Peacock. Shrek Forever After can be streamed only on Max. Spin-off movies Puss in Boots and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish are both on Prime Video.\nPeacock starts at $7.99 for a monthly subscription, with Max starting at $9.99, and Prime Video starting at $8.99.\nFor more, check out our list of the most exciting upcoming movies in 2025 and beyond.\nLauren Milici is a Senior Entertainment Writer for GamesRadar+ currently based in the Midwest.

      "text": "The 32 greatest family animation movies that aren't Disney\nMovie magic isn't exclusive to the Magic Kingdom\nFor so long, Disney has been synonymous with family-friendly animation. Even just the term \"Disney movie\" likely conjures up a specific image. But Disney isn't the only studio in existence to produce generational classics. Ever considered what might be the greatest family animation movies not made by Disney?\nFrom DreamWorks to Sony Animation to pre-merger 20th Century Fox and more, Disney has had many challengers to its throne as the premier animation studio in Hollywood. While few corporate entities come close to matching Disney's scale and influence, many rival studios and upstarts have released must-see animation classics that give Mickey Mouse and the Magic Kingdom a run for their money.\nHere are 32 of the greatest family animation movies that aren't from Disney.\n32. Rise of the Guardians (2012)\nA generic title and audience fatigue toward 3D family adventures circa early 2010s made 2012's Rise of the Guardians fall short of expectations. But time has been kind to Rise of the Guardians, becoming something of an underappreciated gem even among animation enthusiasts. Directed by Peter Ramsey in his feature-length debut, the story sources from seasonal legends to see a pseudo-superhero group \u2013 made up of Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, and the Sandman \u2013 recruit Jack Frost to stop a boogeyman from plunging the world into perpetual darkness. It may not enchant everyone, given its bland art design, but Rise of the Guardians is plenty of fun.\n31. The Wild Robot (2024)\nIn 2024, The Wild Robot stunned audiences everywhere with its beautiful watercolor visuals, pro-environmental messaging, and moving story about adaptation, survival, and kindness. Based on Peter Brown's 2016 novel, The Wild Robot tells of a service robot, Roz (Lupitya Nyong'o) who winds up shipwrecked on an uninhabited island and learns to adapt to her surroundings, as well as becoming the adoptive mother of an orphaned goose (voiced by Kit Connor). The Wild Robot's story about technology and nature living in harmony made it one of the highest-grossing movies of 2024.\n30. Rango (2011)\nIn Gore Verbinski's affectionate parody and homage of spaghetti Westerns, Johnny Depp voices a pet chameleon who poses as a gunslinger only to wind up actually fighting for something worthwhile. In Rango, the title character winds up the desert town of Dirt and inadvertently becomes its new sheriff. Upon finding deep-rooted corruption, Rango drops the act and actually works to become the real hero Dirt needs. Uniquely filmed with the movie's voice actors dressed in character to capture their facial reactions, Rango blurs the line between animation being ostensibly a children's medium and innovative work of art that can impress all generations.\n29. Wolfwalkers (2020)\nAlthough its subdued release on Apple TV+ obscured Wolfwalkers from widespread popularity, this delightful 2D animated feature is a real howl that shouldn't be missed. Set in 17th century Ireland, Wolfwalkers follows a young English girl named Robyn as she befriends a free-spirited \"Wolfwalker\" \u2013 a member of a magical tribe who can transform into wolves during sleep. Forced between her new friendship and her father, himself a hunter of wolves, Robyn embarks on a journey of friendship and self-discovery amid an epic Celtic-inspired fantasy. Wolfwalkers will really want to make everyone of all ages run with the wolves.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\n28. The Secret of NIMH (1982)\nWhile on the surface a cute movie about mice going on adventures, there's so much more going on past its storybook surface. Directed by Don Bluth and based on Robert C. O'Brien's children's novel, The Secret of NIMH follows Mrs. Brisby, a timid mother (voiced by Elizabeth Hartman in her final film role) who seeks the help of super-intelligent rats to help cure her son of pneumonia before the plowing season begins. Smack in the middle of the rats' political power struggle, Mrs. Brisby rises to the occasion as a most unlikely hero. One of Bluth's most celebrated movies, The Secret of NIMH is a deceptively deep story while delighting audiences of all ages with its universal story concerning bravery, the love for family, and the delicate balance between science, magic, and the unknown.\n27. The Red Turtle (2016)\nChildren may not have patience for a silent, nonverbal movie with arthouse pacing. But if you're willing to give them a challenge, let them seek out The Red Turtle. In this beautiful animated production from France, a shipwrecked man winds up on a remote island. His attempts to escape are constantly thwarted by a red turtle, who slowly transforms into a woman. Over time, the two build a life together on the island. Although The Red Turtle is beguiling even to adults, the movie is nonetheless a poetic meditation on reconciling life's expectations with one's environment.\n26. Happy Feet (2006)\nDirector George Miller goes into a completely different gear from his Mad Max saga for Happy Feet. In this jukebox musical comedy, an emperor penguin named Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood) is born without the ability to sing, but instead discovers a real knack for tap dancing. After being alienated from his community, Mumble journeys to the human world where he discovers man's involvement in an environmental crisis. An uplifting story about acceptance and also, somehow, ecology, Happy Feet proves writer/director George Miller has a vision beyond post-apocalyptic action-thrillers.\n25. Guillermo del Toro's Pinocchio (2022)\nThe familiar story of Pinocchio gets a unique Guillermo del Toro spin, including urgent political underpinnings, a love for monsters, and utterly hypnotic stop-motion animation. An adaptation of the classic 1883 novel, Pinocchio tells the story we all know and love \u2013 a wooden boy is granted life \u2013 with more pronounced footing in the human world, set in Italy during World War I. A dream project for del Toro, which he co-directed with Mark Gustafson, Pinocchio is proof that the old fairy tales and myths still have much to offer, and that they are so much more than just cartoons for children.\n24. The Road to El Dorado (2000)\nDisney's Magical Kingdom is paved with gold, so leave it to Spanish con artists Miguel and Tulio to take a piece of it. Released at the heyday of 2D animated films between the 1990s and 2000s, The Road to El Dorado tells the story of two con men who win a map to the fabled city of El Dorado. Upon washing ashore in the new world, the natives of El Dorado treat the two like gods. The Road to El Dorado was just the third animated picture by DreamWorks in its attempt to become a serious contender in the animation space. While it wasn't exactly a goldmine for DreamWorks, the movie has endured as a generational cult classic.\n23. The Brave Little Toaster (1987)\nPredating Toy Story by several years, The Brave Little Toaster follows a group of sentient household appliances who try to find their human owner after they are left abandoned at a summer cabin. The outside elements test their loyalty and bravery, while confronting their own inevitable obsolescence. While often mistaken for a Disney film \u2013 it was actually produced by indie studio Hyperion Pictures, and aired on syndication on the Disney Channel \u2013 The Brave Little Toaster's emotionally moving story and admirable animation (impressive when you consider it had stricter resources than an average Disney production) has made it a cult classic outside the Disney canon.\n22. Ultraman: Rising (2024)\nUltraman has been an icon in Japan since 1966. But abroad, the super-sized superhero has barely left a footprint. That changed in 2024, when the first English-language, American-made Ultraman movie came to Netflix. Directed by Shannon Tindle, Ultraman: Rising is a stand-alone continuation of the original Ultraman television series, telling the story of Ken Sato (Christopher Sean), a baseball star who secretly carries on his father's responsibility as Ultraman. Things get complicated for Ken when he becomes the surrogate parent of an orphaned kaiju baby, Emi. A visually spectacular production that pays homage to its tokusatsu roots while forging a totally new path, Ultraman: Rising is not only a great introduction to the vast Ultra franchise but an earth-shattering picture about fatherhood and responsibility.\n21. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022)\nSurpassing low expectations as a sequel to the nearly forgotten 2011 movie Puss in Boots \u2013 itself a spin-off of the Shrek franchise \u2013 Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is proof you can't judge a cat by his fur. After finding that he's used up eight of his nine lives, Puss in Boots (a returning Antonio Banderas) embarks on a search for the Wishing Star to restore them, all while confronting old enemies along the way. With an utterly fresh painting-like animation style that heavily departs from the \"realistic\" CGI of the Shrek films, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a gasp of fresh air in an otherwise stale series.\n20. How to Train Your Dragon (2010)\nWhile it's not actually a step-by-step instructional video for training dragons (unfortunately), How to Train Your Dragon is an early 2010s classic that took fantasy stories for a real spin. In How to Train Your Dragon, a young Viking (voiced by Jay Baruchel) challenges his people's tradition of slaying dragons by befriending one, which he names Toothless, and finds a way to tame and live alongside the majestic creatures. A heartwarming story about trust, bravery, and willingness to question the status quo, How to Train Your Dragon takes to the skies in style.\n19. Fantastic Mr. Fox (2009)\nFor Fantastic Mr. Fox, released in 2009, Wes Anderson applies his knack for storybook compositions and picturesque stop-motion animation to Roald Dahl's classic 1970 children's novel. George Clooney lends his voice as Mr. Fox, a retired thief who plans one final heist against three cruel farmers who later retaliate against his family in revenge. Besides the complete eye candy that is the movie's animation style, Anderson's punchy dialogue and witty visual storytelling are on full display in this feature sure to delight children and adults alike.\n18. Ice Age (2002)\nEssentially \"Three Dinosaurs and a Baby,\" the first Ice Age launched an animated media franchise that simply hasn't compared to the towering iceberg that is the original. The first in the long-running series centers on a cautious mammoth, a wise-cracking sabre-tooth tiger, and a dim but kind sloth who team up to bring a human baby back to its tribe. Initially written as a more serious action-adventure, Ice Age was retooled during development to become a family comedy, consequently launching an expansive franchise that allowed 20th Century Fox to rival Disney and Pixar (before it eventually folded into the Disney corporate portfolio).\n17. Coraline (2009)\nNeil Gaiman's haunting 2002 novella Coraline put Laika on the map in 2009 when Gaiman's story was turned into a hair-raising but often beautiful stop-motion animated movie. Retaining the story of the novella, Coraline tells of a young girl (voiced by Dakota Fanning) who feels neglected by her parents when she discovers an alternate parallel universe in her family's new home. While button-eyed doppelgangers of her parents lavish her with all the attention she craves, she soon comes to realize that nothing comes close to the real thing. While Coraline is appropriate for families, its gothic scares can give young ones their first real scream.\n16. All Dogs Go to Heaven (1989)\nCo-directed by Don Bluth (with Gary Goldman) and released on the same day as Disney's game-changing The Little Mermaid, All Dogs Go to Heaven has cultivated a strong cult following for its uncompromising story containing dark themes for children. Death, violence, revenge, and even the afterlife are littered all over All Dogs Go to Heaven, but it's the friendship between a brash German Shepherd (voiced by Burt Reynolds) with a young orphan girl (Judith Barsi, who recorded her lines just prior to her real-life murder) that has made the movie so memorably touching. Although it exists on the record as one of Bluth's lowest-grossing films, audiences today cherish All Dogs Go to Heaven, making us all hug our furry friends all the more tighter. Goodbyes aren't forever.\n15. Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (1984)\nAfter making his directing debut with the Lupin the Third film The Castle of Cagliostro, acclaimed animator and filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki adapted his own manga with 1984's fantasy adventure Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the pacifist princess and pilot Nausica\u00e4 who tries to prevent a ruthless kingdom from eradicating a jungle populated by mutant insects. Aerospace, nature, and the unknown are some of Miyazaki's recurring themes, and Nausica\u00e4 is only just the beginning of his legendary run.\n14. Kubo and the Two Strings (2016)\nTravis Knight makes his feature debut with Kubo and the Two Strings, an acclaimed animated movie from studio Laika. Heavily inspired by Japanese mythology, Kubo and the Two Strings tells of a one-eyed young boy with a magical shamisen \u2013 a classic Japanese stringed instrument, like a guitar \u2013 who must find his late father's samurai armor and stop his evil relatives. Although Laika was well-established by 2016 with films like Coraline and ParaNorman under its belt, the praise drawn by Kubo and the Two Strings gave the studio its singular identity as an animation house balanced between family-friendly commercial appeal and arthouse sensibilities.\n13. An American Tail (1986)\nIn a decade when Disney languished, animator and filmmaker Don Bluth seized on the chance to outmatch Mickey Mouse with his own output of animation classics. Among his most revered remains An American Tail, a classic immigration story told through the diminutive perspective of mice. The story follows a young Russian-Jewish mouse, Fievel (Phillip Glasser) who gets lost on the way to America and must find a way to reunite with his family. While critics were not so easily swayed by Fievel's journey, the movie was embraced by audiences and became a big hit on home video. Its sleeper hit status launched a franchise of sequels, spin-offs, TV specials, even video games, but the first An American Tail is the only trip worth taking.\n12. My Neighbor Totoro (1988)\nWhen it comes to Hayao Miyazaki, it's truthfully hard to pick which ones are among his greatest. But there's no question that the oversized half-bunny, half-bear giant Totoro is one of his most enduring creations. In this serene adventure set in a rural corner of Japan, My Neighbor Totoro follows two sisters who deal with the reality of their ill mother by discovering local spirits who dwell just outside their own backyard. While naysayers pan the film for its low stakes and \"nothing happens\" plot, believers like to get lost in the movie's understanding that magic can exist in places closer to us than we might think.\n11. ParaNorman (2012)\nSpooky enough to satisfy Halloween marathons but enjoyable for the whole family, the coming-of-age comedy ParaNorman is all treats with no tricks. The movie follows Norman, an adolescent boy who has the power to communicate with ghosts. Although he's bullied at school and even isolated by his own family, he works to put an end to an ancient witch's curse that plagues his New England hometown. An entertaining movie with resonant story themes involving self-acceptance, belonging, and the difficulties of growing up, ParaNorman is buoyed by its unique art design that gives the whole film its eerie vibes.\n10. The Last Unicorn (1982)\nWhile its stiff animation reminds you that you're not watching a more fluid Disney blockbuster, The Last Unicorn asserts itself as a worthwhile fantasy adventure about identity, mortality, and courage. Mia Farrow voices the titular Unicorn, the last of her kind who goes on a search for other unicorns like herself. She is eventually transformed into a mortal woman and falls for a prince at the cost of potentially abandoning her quest. Although The Last Unicorn didn't exactly gallop at the box office, it has survived to become a cult classic beloved by all who bear witness to its beauty.\n9. Kung Fu Panda (2008)\n2008: The year the summer Olympics took place in Beijing, DreamWorks capitalized on America's fascination with a modernizing China with the family comedy Kung Fu Panda. The movie follows Po (voiced by Jack Black), a clumsy panda who is inexplicably chosen to become the \"Dragon Warrior\" and save his village from the evil Tai Lung. As a student of martial arts under Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman), Po learns to become a real hero from within. While originating at DreamWorks as a satire of kung fu movies, co-director John Stevenson insisted on making a more straightforward martial arts movie, \"albeit one with a comic character,\" he told ComingSoon.net in 2008.\n8. Your Name (2016)\nWhile the MPAA officially rated Makoto Shinkai's celebrated 2016 anime film Your Name with a tame PG, the movie skews to an older crowd of adolescents. Nevertheless, the movie is provocative and expansive, a body-switching comedy in which two high school students from different sides of Japan begin waking up in each other's bodies. As the two deal with the chaos, they race to unravel the mystery behind the phenomenon, seemingly rooted in the stars. Boasting utterly gorgeous scenery and a sweeping story of quite literal star-crossed romance to boot, Your Name may mystify younger viewers, but wait until they're older and watch them get swept away.\n7. Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)\nThis is the \"ultimate\" Spider-Man. At the height of superhero dominance in cinemas, Sony Animation threw down the gauntlet with a stand-alone animated Spider-Man movie that won over audiences everywhere \u2013 including the Academy Awards. Loosely based on the Ultimate Spider-Man and Spider-Verse comics, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse follows an entirely different teenage superhero, Miles Morales (voiced by Shameik Moore) who learns to become the next Spider-Man with the help of other Spider-Men and Spider-Women (and Spider-Ham) from across the multiverse. A seismic release that forever changed the look and feel of mainstream animation, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse is really out of this world.\n6. The Prince of Egypt (1998)\nKids may not be ready to sit through all of Cecil B. DeMille's epic classic The Ten Commandments. Thankfully, The Prince of Egypt exists. An animated retelling of the story of Moses with an original showtunes soundtrack, The Prince of Egypt is a rousing, uncompromising story about liberation and brotherhood. More than just another Bible movie, The Prince of Egypt's multi-dimensional storytelling, especially through its soundtrack, made it a massive hit in 1998, enough to put DreamWorks on the map as a competent rival to Disney. Even now the movie keeps its reputation as one of the most beloved animated musicals of all time, enduring even on TikTok.\n5. The Land Before Time (1988)\nWho can forget Littlefoot and his search for The Great Valley? Hot off of his previous movie An American Tail, animator and director Don Bluth began working with producer Steven Spielberg on their next project, effectively \"Bambi with dinosaurs.\" The movie became The Land Before Time, the unstoppably sad but moving adventure about childlike dinosaurs who fight the elements \u2013 including monstrous T. rexes \u2013 to reunite with their loved ones in \"The Great Valley,\" a lush corner of the world not yet ravaged by famine. While The Land Before Time launched a long-running franchise of lesser direct-to-video sequels, none of them touch the devastation of Littlefoot and his love for his late mother.\n4. Shrek (2001)\nYou can already hear Smash Mouth's \"All Star,\" can't you? In 2001, mainstream animation entered a new era of CGI-heavy productions and celebrity voice casts with Shrek, a send-up of familiar fairy tales with anachronistic humor. (Think Disney by way of Mel Brooks.) Mike Myers stars as Shrek, a lonely ogre whose peaceful solitude is interrupted when fairy tales are forced to move into his swamp. Tasked with rescuing a princess (Cameron Diaz) if he wishes to get his swamp back, Shrek \u2013 and wise-cracking Donkey (Eddie Murphy) \u2013 embark on an unlikely adventure about friendship, trust, and even prejudice. In spite of its pervasive status as a meme, Shrek really is one of the greatest non-Disney animated features of the 21st century.\n3. Spirited Away (2001)\nOf all of Hayao Miyazaki's movies, Spirited Away just might be his single best. (Maybe.) In this candlelit fantasy, a young girl, Chihiro (voiced by Rumi Hiiragi in the original Japanese language track and Daveigh Chase in the English dub) takes a job at a bathhouse run by a witch in order to restore her parents back to their human forms after they've been transformed into pigs. An elaborate coming-of-age tale about lonesomeness and the sudden end of childhood, Spirited Away balances Miyazaki's delicateness about nature and the ruthlessness of modern society.\n2. Anastasia (1997)\nAn animated princess musical so good that it's often mistaken as a Disney movie, Anastasia \u2013 from directors Don Bluth and Gary Goldman \u2013 remakes the 1956 Yul Brynner movie Anastasia, along with doses of Pygmalion. (It also plays with popular urban legend that the real-life Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna actually survived the assassination of her family during the Bolshevik revolution.) Mixing history with storybook fantasy, Anastasia sees a young orphan woman with foggy memories of her childhood being groomed by con men to pose as the real Grand Duchess Anastasia, only to learn she is the real Anastasia. An impressive production from top to bottom, Anastasia is truly animation royalty.\n1. The Iron Giant (1999)\nWhat is purpose? Is it fate or free will? That's the story underlining The Iron Giant, Brad Bird's celebrated 1999 sci-fi about a boy who befriends a giant alien robot in 1950s Maine. When a colossal robot from outer space lands on Earth, it befriends a young boy who teaches him that whatever he might be made for \u2013 and he's clearly not made for hugs \u2013 doesn't have to be his destiny. Set against the paranoia of Cold War America, The Iron Giant is a towering story about friendship that transcends programming.\nEric Francisco is a freelance entertainment journalist and graduate of Rutgers University.

      "text": "Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse delayed 3 weeks to late June 2027\nThe animated flick was originally due out in 2024\nSpider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse has had its release date pushed back just three weeks from June 4 to June 25, 2027, per Deadline.\nThe animated threequel was originally due to premiere on March 29, 2024, but was delayed indefinitely in July 2023 due to the WGA writers' and SAG-AFTRA actors' strike. It took Sony almost two years to set a definitive date, although obviously that has now proven not so definitive.\nAn official reason for the delay wasn't provided, but it's not at all uncommon for big movie studios to shuffle around release date calendars for all sorts of reasons we usually aren't privy to. In some cases, big releases are moved around to avoid conflicting with each other, but it's unclear if that was the cause here.\nBeyond the Spider-Verse is, of course, not to be confused with the upcoming Spider-Man 4, officially titled Spider-Man: Brand New day, the fourth entry in Tom Holland's live-action Spider-Man franchise, which is due to premiere July 31, 2026.\nThere's no official plot synopsis for Spider-Man: Beyond the Spider-Verse just yet, but if you've seen the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse ending, you'll have a rough idea of the setup.\nAlso, at CinemaCon 2025, filmmakers Bob Persichetti and Justin K. Thompson shared some early footage and official images from the sequel, showing Miles and Gwen reuniting and Miles fighting The Prowler before heading off on an adventure with him. \"Everyone keeps telling me how my story is supposed to go,\" Miles says in the early footage.\nWhile we wait for the sequel, check out our rankings of the best Spider-Man movies and all of the other new superhero movies in the works.\nBringing all the latest movie news, features, and reviews to your inbox\nAfter earning an English degree from ASU, I worked as a corporate copy editor while freelancing for places like SFX Magazine, Screen Rant, Game Revolution, and MMORPG on the side.

      "text": "A Donkey Kong movie may be in the works according to new documents, and it's official: 2025 is the year of DK\nSuper Mario Bros. Movie was just the beginning, as a Donkey Kong project is on the way\nHang onto your bananas because DK is coming back to the big screen, as it looks like there is a Donkey Kong movie on the way.\nThat\u2019s right, it seems like the crazed monkey is finally getting his own movie as some eagle-eyed Nintendo fans on Resetera have found that Universal Pictures has registered a movie with US Copyright titled 'Untitled Donkey Kong Project; Motion picture,' on the Public Records System. The movie has Nintendo Studios LLC and Universal Pictures listed as involved parties. Nintendo fan account Wario64 has since posted a screenshot of the listing on Twitter. Check it out below.\n\"Untitled Donkey Kong Project ; Motion picture\" US Copyright registered by Universal Pictures https://t.co/iOWSksyNTkhttps://t.co/gMc7HP8KlC pic.twitter.com/liG1znqC8jJuly 13, 2025\nThis comes just 10 days after Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said the company plans to expand \"the number of people who have access to Nintendo IP,\" adding, \"visual content is one such area.\" The statement seemed quite cryptic at the time. However, now we know what such 'visual content' Furukawa was alluding to. As well as a DK project, Nintendo also has a Super Mario Bros. Movie sequel in the works, as well as a live-action Legend of Zelda movie.\nDonkey Kong has been part of Nintendo\u2019s Super Mario franchise for almost 45 years, appearing in such games as Mario Kart, Super Mario Party Jamboree, as well as many Kong spin-offs. We saw DK make his big-screen debut in the 2023 animated movie Super Mario Bros. Movie, voiced by Seth Rogen. However, it is not clear at this point whether Rogan will return to play the cheeky monkey.\nA DK movie is just the icing on the cake for Kong. The fan-favorite character is having quite the year, with the highly anticipated upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game, Donkey Kong Bananza, coming out on July 17, 2025. The game follows Kong and Pauline as they set out to recover stolen banana diamonds from a gang of evil apes.\nFor more upcoming movies, check out our guide to all the upcoming video game adaptations you need to know about.\nI am an Entertainment Writer here at GamesRadar+, covering TV and film for SFX and Total Film online.
