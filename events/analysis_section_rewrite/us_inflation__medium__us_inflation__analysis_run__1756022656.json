      "feedback": "Strengths: the draft anchors a 3–6 month horizon on a cohesive AI-productivity thesis (Range’s 1–1.5% TF P growth and up to 78 million net new jobs) and ties that to growth signals in tech-enabled platforms (Pacaso expansion to 10 new international destinations; mogul’s 10–12% cash-on-cash yields and 18.8% IRR) and a healthcare-AI backdrop (HeartSciences’ AI-ECG with FDA/Medicare traction), which provides a plausible, multi-asset transmission map. Key gaps: the causal chain is underspecified (why 1–1.5% productivity translates into specific uplift in tech equities, credit, and valuations over 3–6 months); triggers are too implicit and not tied to concrete timing windows; the base case is under-quantified (absent explicit rate/earnings/valuation anchors) and alts are only lightly fleshed out; and there are conflicts in the sources (defunct AUVSI figures vs. 97% UAS job growth, mixed real-estate-automation signals) that need reconciliation. Actionable edits: rebuild the causal chain with a tight, first-principles flow: AI-driven TF productivity uplift (1–1.5%/yr) → higher corporate earnings and capex intensity → modest disinflationary bias → policy flexibility and credit/tech-valuation bid; anchor each link to a specific source (Range: 1–1.5%; 78M jobs; Pacaso growth metrics; HeartSciences FDA/Medicare timeline; UAS staffing data). Add explicit timing windows: near-term (0–3 months) watch CPI, wage/price data, and tech-capex signals; mid-term (3–6 months) look for tangible earnings upgrades, AI-usage milestones (HeartSciences deployment, FDA approvals), and cross-asset bid strength. Turn the alts into two crisp scenarios with quantitative prompts: Alt 1 (real estate-tech co-ownership upside) with expansion milestones, revenue/cohort growth, and discount-rate sensitivity (cite Pacaso metrics); Alt 2 (health-AI adoption) with FDA/Medicare milestones and projected impact on adoption curves and valuation multiples (cite HeartSciences, Range). Reconcile conflicts transparently: note AUVSI’s defunct projections vs. contemporary UAS data (cite FOM34PUWA) and avoid overgeneralizing nationwide increases; give a caveat on how regional data (Grand Forks) may under- or overstate national trends. Strengthen quantification by converting qualitative signals into ranges or triggers (e.g., if AI-productivity prints above 1.0% QoQ, lift the macro-asset beta by X%; if HeartSciences advances to FDA submission, imply a Y multiple expansion) and clearly label the watch-list signals with thresholds. Tighten citation discipline by mapping every factual claim to the exact IDs (V8TEZOR8R, UPV3X2MQ6, FOM34PUWA, A7VLN74BK, ILYC1M41F, etc.) and avoiding conflating unrelated “trend” claims. Finally, end with a crisp, single-sentence base-case; two explicit alts; a short risk register (inflation, policy shift, regulatory delays, geopolitics); concrete watch signals (credit spreads, CAPEX plans, FDA/CDC milestones, UAS hiring data); and a stated confidence level (e.g., moderate) grounded in the strength of the signals and the potential conflicts resolved.",
