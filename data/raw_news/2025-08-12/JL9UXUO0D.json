  "content": "A new themed meal is taking customers back. Back to \"McDonaldland,\" that is.\n\nThe \"McDonaldland\" meal, an homage to the fast-food chain's whimsical and fictional world, made its debut at participating restaurants nationwide on Tuesday, Aug. 12. The new menu offering, which includes a colorful shake and limited-edition \"souvenir,\" will only be available for a limited time.\n\nAccording to an Aug. 5 news release, McDonaldland is a promotional fantasy world that debuted in 1971 and was featured in commercials and other media.\n\nIn the imaginary world of McDonaldland, hamburgers grow on patches and apple pies grow on trees, which they say makes it the perfect place for Ronald McDonald and his friends to grab a quick bite.\n\n\"Now the gang is back together, and fans can rediscover the epic world and its characters or experience it for the first time \u2013 all through the meal,\" the McDonald's statement says.\n\nHere's what to know about McDonald's \"McDonaldland\" meal, including what is in it.\n\nCustomers can choose between two versions of the \"McDonaldland\" meal, which includes a side of fries, a Mt. McDonaldland shake and a choice of a Quarter Pounder with Cheese or a 10-piece Chicken McNuggets.\n\nThe Mt. McDonaldland shake was inspired by the \"vibrant blue lava\u201d and pink clouds of Mt. McDonaldland, a volcano from McDonaldland, the release says.\n\nAccording to McDonald's, every \"McDonaldland\" meal comes with one of six exclusive collectible tins, featuring postcards, stickers and more. Each is inspired by a different character.\n\nMcDonald's also announced the launch of limited-edition merch inspired by McDonaldland through collaborations with trendy clothing brand Pacsun and travel retailer Away.\n\nThe PacSun collaboration will feature sweat sets and graphic tees available Tuesday, Aug. 12, while the Away collaboration will include luggage tags and bag charms available starting Monday, Aug. 18, while supplies last, McDonald's said.\n\nMcDonald's \"McDonaldland\" meal might be inspired by characters of the past, but a new Happy Meal is paying tribute to characters of the present.\n\nA new Happy Meal featuring Hello Kitty and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles also made its debut at McDonald's on Aug. 12. It, like the \"McDonaldland\" meal, will only be available for a limited time.\n\nThe themed meal for children will include special figurines, consisting of \"a wild fusion of your favorite TMNT heroes and the Hello Kitty crew.\" According to McDonald's, each Happy Meal will include one of 12 figurine options and a character card describing \"their unique skills and story.\"\n\nThe signature Happy Meal boxes will feature graphics of both the fighting reptiles and the feline-like girl, which can be seen on the promotional materials obtained by USA TODAY. It can be purchased in person or through the McDonald's app at participating restaurants.",

      "text": "No front desk staff, just a tablet. Guest's hotel check-in video goes viral.\nThe kiosk will be removed, a Wyndham Hotels representative said.\nPete Sager had anything but a normal check-in when he arrived at a La Quinta hotel in Florida last month.\nInstead of staff greeting him from behind the front desk, a single candle burned on the empty counter. Taking to social media to share, a single video of his abnormal experience has garnered millions of views.\nSager, of Frisco, Texas, checked in to the La Quinta Inn & Suites in Sunrise, Florida on Friday, July 25, according to documents Sager shared with USA TODAY. Rather than making small talk with a front desk employee, Sager said he was greeted by a man on a tablet, who was helping guests remotely. Seizing on the abnormal moment, Sager said he recorded his interaction with the man on the screen using a pair of AI glasses.\nWhile Sager posted the video to his own social media, it gained traction after it was reposted by another social media user on X (formerly Twitter). As of Aug. 8, the reshared video had more than 2.1 million views.\nWhat happened?\nWhen Sager arrived to the La Quinta Inn & Suites, he first saw a group of people arguing with a tablet at a kiosk. The tablet, as seen in the video, sat under a green banner that read, \"Check in and out here!\" Sager said members of the group were asking for more towels and were told by the remote worker they would arrive the next day.\nSager said when it was his turn to step up to the kiosk, he began recording, joking with the man on the other side of the screen that he took his job. Sager said when he asked the man where he was based, he was told Florida.\nIn addition to the tablet, Sager said the kiosk included tech for guests to tap a debit or credit card and scan an ID. The tablet, which displayed the remote worker, also allowed guests to sign the necessary documents as they would traditionally do at a hotel front desk, he added. The kiosk also had an output that distributed room keys.\nDuring his two nights at the hotel, Sager said the only staff he saw on site were cleaning staff.\n\"The lack of staff could be concerning for someone who's paying for a visit,\" Sager told USA TODAY. \"It's not a four star (hotel), but it's not a two star, and it's in a part of Florida where it's a destination area. It's not like an Iowa on-the-side-of-the-road, where you're just stopping to sleep and get going.\"\nTwo nights at the hotel cost about $150, per Sager's receipt, which he provided to USA TODAY.\nA concern of safety\nSager said he also found the lack of hotel staff concerning in relation to guest safety.\n\"When I was at the pool, there were some kids out there and I thought, 'You know what, if anything happened, there's no staff here to come out and attend to an emergency,'\" Sager said. \"Say someone cuts their foot, a kid hits his head ... What are you going to do? Run to a screen and it's going to be like, 'Okay, I'll call somebody.'\"\nWyndham: Kiosk not approved, to be removed\nThe La Quinta where the incident occurred is a franchised location, meaning it is independently owned and staffed, Robert Myers, Wyndham Hotels & Resort external communications vice president, told USA TODAY.\n\"That said, this franchisee\u2019s use of this equipment is not brand approved nor is it being marketed to other franchisees. Further, our brand standards require hotels to have a team member physically stationed at the front desk at all times,\" Myers added. \"Upon learning of this matter, we immediately reached out to the hotel\u2019s owner who has since informed us the hotel will be removing the kiosk.\"\nWhat are people saying online?\nLargely, online users have expressed their discomfort by the remote staff.\n\"This is getting way out of hand. This is 100% absurd,\" one TikTok user commented on Sager's video.\nAnother commented: \"This should literally be illegal.\"\nBut others cited remote check-in options at other hotel branches, implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, guests at select Hilton hotels may check in without talking to a single employee, checking in on a mobile app and using the same app as a digital key to unlock their room. Wyndham, in fact, offers mobile check-in, too, rolling out the initiative to about 9,000 hotels across the globe in December 2020.\nGreta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY.

Then, they jumped right out with no hesitation and started foraging again.\"\nKulaga said it appeared the animals took a \"short swim or a little bath in the hot sun.\"\n\"They knew exactly what they were doing, and they made it perfectly to the other side,\" the licensed mental health counselor and life coach said, adding she checked if they did.\nWatch: Endangered Key deer take a dip in Florida canal\nKey deer in Florida\nKey deer are the smallest subspecies of white-tailed deer. They are classified as an endangered species by the Federal Endangered Species Act and as a federally designated endangered species in Florida.\nThe small animals with light to dark-brown coating, a white belly, and a black snout are found only in the Florida Keys, according to Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. Their range includes about 26 islands from Big Pine Key to Sugarloaf Key, and they can swim from one island to another, the agency said.\nWhile hunting and habitat destruction initially caused their numbers to fall to less than 50 in the 1940s, the main threat to their existence now is getting hit by vehicles, followed by illegal feeding which results in \"concentration of Key deer populations, facilitating the spread of parasites and disease,\" according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission.\nSaman Shafiq is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "What is Instagram map? How to turn location feature on and off\nInstagram's new feature that shows users' current locations is prompting some users to worry if their location will suddenly be shared on the platform.\nMeta announced the rollout of several new features on Instagram Aug. 6, including a map to show where U.S. users are active while using the app.\nHowever, users have the option to turn off location sharing \"at any time,\" Meta said in a release.\nWhile location services already existed on the app through the tagging option on posts and stories, some social media users raised concerns about the new map feature.\n\"What is with the obsession of having our location shared to the public??? NO THANK YOU!\" one person wrote on X.\nHere's what to know about the feature, including how to turn it off.\nWhat is Instagram map? Is your location automatically shared?\nInstagram map is a new feature on the social media app that shows a user's last active location. The feature is off unless users opt in to sharing, Meta said.\nThose who do opt in can choose who to share their location with, including followers, close friends or only some selected friends. Users can choose not to share location in specific places or with specific people.\nA user's location is updated whenever they open the app or return to the app if it's been running in the background, per Meta.\nParents who have supervision settings for their child have control over their location sharing on the map as well, according to Meta. They will receive a notification if their teen starts sharing their location.\nHow to turn Instagram map location sharing on and off\nThe Instagram map is available in the messages tab on the app. Here's how to change your location sharing settings:\n- Tap messages icon at the top right of home feed.\n- Tap Map at the top of inbox.\n- Tap settings icon in the top right.\n- To turn off location sharing, choose \"no one.\"\n- Alternatively, to opt in to location sharing, select \"friends,\" \"close friends\" or choose select people.\n- Tap Done at the bottom to save changes.\nOn the map page, you can also see which users are sharing their location with you.\nSome users say their location automatically shared\nSome users have reported that their location was shared without them opting in to the feature.\nAdam Mosseri, the head of Instagram, attempted to dispel theories about automatic location sharing in a post on the platform Aug. 7.\n\"Quick Friend Map clarification: your location will only be shared *if* you decide to share it, and if you do, it can only shared with a limited group of people you choose. To start, location sharing is *completely off*,\" he wrote.\nSome commenters said they experienced otherwise, claiming their own location or the location of their friends were shared without ever opting into the feature.\n\"It\u2019s definitely not opt-in. I saw a bunch of friends sharing their location last night\u2026 DMd them each and none of them had turned it on,\" one user wrote.\nAnother said, \"My location was automatically shared to all my followers before the feature was even rolled out. HUGE security risk.\"\nMeta said in a statement to USA TODAY that the map feature is \"off by default.\"\n\"Your live location is never shared unless you choose to turn it on. If you do, only people you follow back\u2014or a private, custom list you select\u2014can see your location,\" the statement said.\nInstagram releases other new features: reposting, Reels friends tab\nOther features were released with the rollout of location-sharing on Instagram.\nUsers can now repost others' public feed posts and video Reels to their own followers. Reposts are visible user feeds as well as a separate reposting tab on the user's profile, according to Meta.\nThere is also a new \"Friends\" tab on Instagram Reels, which allows users to see \"public content your friends have interacted with, or recommendations from Blends you\u2019ve started, and easily start conversations about them,\" according to Meta.\nContributing: Anthony Robledo, USA TODAY\nMelina Khan is a national trending reporter for USA TODAY.
