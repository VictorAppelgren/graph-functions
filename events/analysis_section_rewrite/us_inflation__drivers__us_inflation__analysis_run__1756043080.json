      "feedback": "The draft does a reasonable base-case scaffolding (Regime A with MSFT/Shopify as transmission nodes and a policy backdrop of mild Fed easing, mid-4% 10Y and a softer dollar) but it undercuts world-class quality by: (1) lacking a crisp, first-principles causal chain from platform breadth to GMV growth to revenue/margin expansion with explicit multipliers and a multi-year horizon; (2) misaligning to SECTION FOCUS by mixing macro/policy, flows/positioning, and valuation in a single narrative without a formal, three‑pillar structure and without a tight watch-list; (3) insufficient scenario structure and lack of explicit catalysts/invalidation points beyond vague hedges; (4) over-reliance on opaque numbers (e.g., “Azure contracted revenue ≈ $368B” and “Shopify H1’25 GMV ≈ $163B”) without verification or ranges, and without clear unit/source attribution; (5) weak citation discipline (QF is not in the source IDs, some claims are not tied to specific IDs, and the coverage of critical sources is uneven). Edits to elevate quality: restructure around macro/p policy/flows/positioning/valuation with a transparent Regime A core (state the mechanism: policy easing → FX/yields compression → AI capex uplift → platform monetization → GMV growth → revenue/operating leverage → cash flow and valuation rerating); convert to a three-scenario framework (Base Regime A; Bull/Delicate‑tariff relief; Bear/oil spike or hawkish pivot) with explicit catalysts and invalidation triggers; quantify path with verifiable numbers (verify Azure/revenue figures or replace with source-supported ranges; anchor Shopify GMV/revenue/margins to Q2’25 metrics and show 2–3 year trajectory); add a concrete watch-list: Fed Sept decision, 10Y drift to mid-4%+, USD direction, Shopify GMV/revenue/margin progression, tariff policy updates, oil-price path, and cross-border demand signals; ensure every assertion cites only IDs in the SOURCE MATERIAL (GX057ADL7, J99EM2TPZ, RHXDOHQQX, 0G3A676BP, 48JXC9VDP) and eliminate non-source text (QF); reconcile conflicts (oil oversupply vs inflation containment; tariff truce stability vs escalation risk) with explicit qualifiers; and present the material cross-topic drivers as a concise, testable framework with a short, decisive watch-list.",
