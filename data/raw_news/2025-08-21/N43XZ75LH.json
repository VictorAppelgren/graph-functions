  "content": "US summits with Putin and European leaders offered a glimmer of hope for peace, but Russia seemed to cloud it.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin appears to be resisting a bilateral meeting with Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelenskyy, casting doubt over whatever hopes for peace may have been generated by a week of summit diplomacy.\n\nThat bilateral meeting is supposed to be the next step in a process inaugurated by US President Donald Trump last Friday, when he and Putin met in Alaska.\n\nEuropean leaders told Trump in a follow-up meeting in Washington on Monday that if Putin doesn\u2019t cooperate, more sanctions should be imposed on the creaking Russian economy.\n\nThe week of meetings did nothing to lessen hostilities in Ukraine, where Russia appeared to try to deal a decisive blow to Ukrainian defenders ahead of the Trump-Putin summit, but was instead pushed back from previously captured territory. It also maintained a steady rain of drones and missiles on Ukraine\u2019s cities every day.\n\nUkraine, too, kept up pressure on Russia, continuing a highly successful series of strikes against refineries and oil depots that have deprived Russia of 13 percent of its refining capacity.\n\nA day ahead of the Alaska summit, Russian forces attempted a major push towards Dobropillia, a city in Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region that lies just 15km (9 miles) north of Pokrovsk, a target Russia has prioritised since last summer.\n\nUkrainian General Staff spokesman Andriy Kovalev said reserves had stabilised the situation. On Friday, Dnipro Group of Forces spokesman Colonel Viktor Trehubov confirmed Russian infiltrators had been cleared from Pokrovsk and a group of outlying villages. Geolocated satellite imagery also confirmed this on Saturday.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s intention was to demonstrate strength ahead of Alaska, but in fact, for the occupier, this ends with its destruction,\u201d Zelenskyy said in his Friday evening address.\n\nRussia did seize some land. Its Defence Ministry confirmed the capture of Sobolivka near Kupiansk in Ukraine\u2019s northern Kharkiv region on Tuesday, and Novogeorgievka in Dnipropetrovsk and Pankovka in Donetsk on Wednesday.\n\nRussia also continued its aerial campaign against Ukraine\u2019s cities, launching 1,421 missiles between August 14 and 21. Ukraine downed 1,114 of them. Over the same period, it downed 38 missiles out of a total of 62 launched.\n\nUkraine, too, continued its long-range campaign to destroy Russia\u2019s ability to wage war. It struck the Lukoil oil refinery in Volgograd on August 14 and the Rosneft Syzran Oil Refinery in Samara region on Friday. Both attacks caused explosions and fires.\n\nUkraine on Friday also struck the port of Olya in Russia\u2019s Astrakhan region, through which it says Russia imports drones and other war supplies from Iran. It said the strike had also destroyed the Port Olya 4 vessel, which was carrying Shahed-type drone components and ammunition from Iran.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ukrainian drones struck a Russian freight train carrying oil through Zaporizhia. Aerial video showed several oil cars burning.\n\nRussian authorities said on Tuesday that they had thwarted an attempt to blow up the Crimea Bridge, a major supply route, when they seized a car carrying 130kg (286lbs) of explosives. The car had been \u201cdriven across many European countries\u201d to end up in Georgia, they said. It was then supposed to travel to Russian territory on board a ferry, before being driven across the bridge and detonated.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump appeared to seesaw between the positions of his interlocutors across the two summits.\n\nOn August 13, Trump had warned of \u201cvery severe consequences\u201d if Putin did not stop the war in Ukraine. He had previously said he was considering a severe package of primary sanctions on Russia and secondary measures on countries buying its oil and gas that is being drafted in the US Senate.\n\nAfter spending just under three hours in talks with Putin at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson near Anchorage on Friday, Trump reversed himself on sanctions, opening a new rift between the US and Ukraine\u2019s European allies.\n\n\u201cBecause of what happened today, I don\u2019t have to think about that. Maybe I have to think about it in two weeks or three weeks,\u201d Trump told Fox presenter Sean Hannity.\n\n\u201cWhat happened\u201d remained something of a mystery because Putin and Trump took no questions from the media, and the US leader made other concessions.\n\nTrump moved away from his demand for a ceasefire, a condition he announced shortly after assuming office.\n\n\u201cThe US president\u2019s position has changed after talks with Putin, and now the discussion will focus not on a truce, but on the end of the war. And a new world order. Just as Moscow wanted,\u201d Olga Skabeyeva, a prominent Russian state TV host, wrote on Telegram.\n\nTrump has previously made another key concession to Moscow, and he repeated it en route to Alaska when he ruled out Ukraine\u2019s membership in NATO. Asked what security guarantees Ukraine would receive, he said, \u201cNot in the form of NATO, because, you know, there are things that will not happen.\u201d\n\nUkraine and Europe agree to none of these concessions, and European leaders said they would accompany Zelenskyy to Washington for a follow-up summit on Monday.\n\nZelenskyy had begun to prepare for another meeting with Trump at least 10 days ago, when the Alaska summit was announced.\n\nLast week he agreed five principles with European allies \u2013 that a ceasefire was a precondition for peace talks, that sanctions should be strengthened if Russia did not cooperate, that Russia could not have a veto over security guarantees for Ukraine, that the US had to be included as a security guarantor along with Europe, and that no deal concerning Ukraine could be made without Ukraine\u2019s consent.\n\nDuring Monday\u2019s summit in the White House, European leaders appeared to have won only their last two points.\n\nTrump has agreed to make no deals with Putin without Ukraine\u2019s consent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a done deal at all. Ukraine has to agree,\u201d he told Hannity on Friday.\n\nOn security guarantees, Trump told reporters ahead of talks, \u201cThey\u2019re going to be our first line of defence because they\u2019re there, they\u2019re Europe, but we\u2019re going to help them out also, we\u2019ll be involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that you [Trump] have said \u2018I am willing to participate in security guarantees\u2019 is a big step, is really a breakthrough, and thank you for that,\u201d said NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte, who was present at the summit.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump clarified on the Fox News entertainment network that this did not mean sending US troops to Ukraine, but meant lending air defence support.\n\nIt was unclear if Trump had agreed to a collective defence with Ukraine, as Zelenskyy and EU leaders have asked. \u201cWe need security to work in practice, like Article 5 of NATO,\u201d said Zelenskyy on Saturday after meeting with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen.\n\nCertainly, a gulf continued to separate Trump from the leaders of Europe on the first three points.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t imagine that the next meeting would take place without a ceasefire. So let\u2019s work on that, and let\u2019s try to put pressure on Russia. Because the credibility of these efforts we\u2019re undertaking today are depending on at least a ceasefire from the beginning of negotiations,\u201d German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told Trump.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron told an NBC interviewer it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for Ukrainian officials to negotiate a peace deal as bombs were falling on their cities.\n\nBut Trump said a ceasefire was not a part of any of the \u201csix wars\u201d he claims to have settled.\n\nRussia poured scorn on European security guarantees. \u201cThe brainless Gallic rooster can\u2019t let go of the idea of sending troops to \u2018Ukraine\u2019,\u201d wrote Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia\u2019s National Security Council.\n\n\u201cWe cannot agree with the current proposal to resolve issues of collective security without Russia,\u201d said Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in a press conference on Wednesday, calling the idea \u201cutopian\u201d.\n\nMacron pointed out that Russia became a security guarantor of Ukraine when recognising its independence in 1991, and that led to the Russian invasion.\n\nRussia also appeared to ignore the diplomatic path outlined by Trump and the Europeans, consisting of a bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy in the next two weeks, followed by a trilateral meeting that would include Trump.\n\nAlthough White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt told reporters on Tuesday that Putin had agreed to the bilateral meeting, there was no Kremlin confirmation as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nInstead, Lavrov offered merely to send more senior negotiators to an existing format of bilateral talks with Ukraine that doesn\u2019t include the two presidents \u2013 an offer echoed by Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov.\n\nThis appeared to be what Putin had in mind when he expressed faith in Alaska that \u201cmoving along this path, we can reach the end of the conflict in Ukraine sooner rather than later\u201d.\n\nReuters reported that Putin had demanded the unoccupied parts of Ukraine\u2019s eastern regions of Luhansk and Donetsk ahead of the Alaska summit, in return for a few pockets of land Russia has seized and a freezing of the front line in the southern regions of Zaporizhia and Kherson.\n\nThe sources were two unnamed White House officials.\n\nThere was no mention of what would happen in other parts of the front; Ukraine is also currently defending its northern regions of Kharkiv and Sumy.\n\nTrump later told Hannity that he and Putin had \u201clargely agreed\u201d on a territorial deal in Alaska. \u201cI think we\u2019re pretty close to a deal,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cUkraine has to agree to it. Maybe they\u2019ll say \u2018no\u2019.\u201d\n\nAccording to Reuters, Zelenskyy did say no.\n\nEuropean leaders continue to stand on principle, saying no land can be won through aggression, and Ukraine shouldn\u2019t be asked to cede any territory to Russia as part of a formula known as \u201cland for peace\u201d.\n\n\u201cOnce we recognise part of Donbas [as Russian territory]\u2026 There is no more international order,\u201d Macron said, using a term that refers to the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk. \u201cThis isn\u2019t compliant with the UN Charter. And the day after, our collective credibility, the US, Europeans, permanent members of the Security Council, will be totally zero.\u201d\n\nBut Trump mentioned this month that any peace deal will involve a \u201cland swap\u201d between Russia and Ukraine.\n\nTrump also appeared willing to concede large tracts of Ukrainian land to Russia.\n\nVladimir Zharikhin, a Kremlin-affiliated expert, suggested Trump had ruled out as impossible the return of Crimea to Ukraine, calling it de facto recognition of its possession by Russia.\n\nDespite its ongoing war, Russia insists that \u201cNeither Crimea, nor Donbas, nor Novorossiya as territories have ever been our goal,\u201d Lavrov told the Rossiya-24 TV channel. \u201cWe never spoke about seizing any territories,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOur goal was to protect the people, the Russian people, who had lived on these lands for centuries, who discovered these lands,\u201d Lavrov said.\n\nYet Russia has never offered to give up occupied territories.",

      "text": "MOSCOW, August 19. /TASS/. US President Donald Trump\u2019s statement about the impossibility of returning Crimea to Ukraine is de facto recognition by Washington that the peninsula is a part of Russia, Vladimir Zharikhin, deputy director of the CIS Countries Institute, told TASS on Tuesday.\n\"De facto, this is the recognition of Crimea as a Russian territory, albeit not de jure,\" the expert said. \"Legal recognition by the United States should be handled via the Congress, and with its current rather critical attitude towards Russia, I'm not sure that it will be recognized de jure in the foreseeable future.\"\nZharikhin, however, described the current situation as a \"significant shift.\"\n\"It\u2019s quite possible that this [the recognition] may happen in many other countries after Trump\u2019s statement,\" he noted.\nAccording to the expert, after the Russia-US summit in Alaska, \"the result is still a draw.\"\n\"Trump held his ground and forced Vladimir Zelensky and representatives of Europe to support the position that first a deal must be struck, and then a truce can follow,\" the analyst explained.\nTaking that approach, Zharikhin believes, would \"pave the way for signing an agreement on sustainable peace.\"\nIn an interview with Fox News earlier in the day, Trump stated that neither the return of Crimea to Ukraine nor Kiev\u2019s accession to NATO is possible.\nOn August 15, a meeting between Russian and US Presidents Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump took place at a military base in Alaska. The meeting lasted about three hours: there was a one-on-one discussion in the American leader\u2019s limousine on the way to the main venue for the talks and a narrow \"three-on-three\" meeting.\nThe Russian side was also represented by Presidential aide Yury Ushakov and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, while the American side was represented by Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff.\nIn a statement to the press following the talks, Putin said that the settlement of the Ukrainian conflict was the main topic of the summit.\nThe Russian leader also called for turning the page in bilateral relations and resuming cooperation, and invited Trump to Moscow. For his part, the US president announced the progress made in the talks, but noted that the parties had not managed to reach an agreement.\nOn August 18, US President Donald Trump received Vladimir Zelensky, presidents of Finland and France Alexander Stubb and Emmanuel Macron, Prime Minister of Great Britain Keir Starmer, Chancellor of Germany Friedrich Merz, and the head of the Italian government Giorgia Meloni.\nIn addition, the meeting was attended by the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. According to Macron, the talks focused on security guarantees for Ukraine."

Trump softened his earlier hard\u2011line stance on sanctions and moved away from a ceasefire demand, instead proposing air\u2011defence support for Ukraine while refusing to deploy U.S. troops or grant NATO membership. European leaders insisted on a pre\u2011condition ceasefire, stronger sanctions, and security guarantees that exclude Russia, while Russia pushed for territorial concessions and a \u201cland\u2011swap\u201d deal that the West rejected. Amid ongoing missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian cities and counter\u2011strikes on Russian oil infrastructure, the diplomatic talks have stalled, leaving the conflict\u2019s resolution uncertain.
