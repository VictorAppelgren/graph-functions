  "content": "Strong foundation of creating access to high-quality care in rural areas sets the stage for future innovations.\n\nCHARLOTTE, N.C., Aug. 14, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Advocate Health's commitment to provide access to care for all is showcased in a new report detailing the health system's sweeping and deep commitment to providing high-quality and innovative health care to rural communities.\n\nThe white paper, published this week at AdvocateHealth.org/RuralCare, provides a big-picture look at the health system's work across its rural footprint, including its 21 rural hospitals and 322 rural clinics. Entitled \"Commitment to Community: Advocate Health's Role as an Innovative National Rural Health Leader,\" the report also highlights the stories of individual clinicians going above and beyond for their patients across its six-state footprint.\n\n\"At Advocate Health, we believe access to nation-leading care shouldn't depend on your ZIP code or the size of your town,\" said Eugene A. Woods, chief executive officer of Advocate Health. \"That's why we're investing more than $3 billion across our rural footprint \u2013 to expand access, improve outcomes and create jobs.\n\n\"We're combining the strength of a national health system with the heart of local care \u2013 delivered by people who live in and understand the communities they serve,\" Woods added. \"From virtual visits that bring specialists to small towns to new facilities, expanded mental health services and training the next generation of rural health professionals, we're committed to transforming rural health and strengthening the communities we call home.\"\n\nAdvocate Health serves patients in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina and Wisconsin under the regional care delivery brands Advocate Health Care, Atrium Health and Aurora Health Care. Wake Forest University School of Medicine is the academic core of the health system.\n\nAdvocate Health's ongoing efforts are laying a strong foundation for more substantial commitments in the future via strategic partnerships.\n\nLast month, Hugh Chatham Health joined Advocate Health, deepening the system's rural health commitment. Recently announced grants from The Duke Endowment and expansion of a school-based therapy program to serve students in five more rural counties in North Carolina are also among Advocate Health's growing track record of success and support in rural health care detailed in the report.\n\nThe report also demonstrates how Advocate Health has extended clinical trials to its rural operations, expanded its nationally leading hospital at home program and is investing in the next generation of medical professionals, including the establishment of a rural residency program.",

      "text": "Today, Hugh Chatham Health and Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist announced Hugh Chatham Health has officially joined Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist, part of the third-largest nonprofit health system in the country, Advocate Health. Additionally, Atrium Health is investing $100 million to ensure access to enhanced resources and expertise is delivered by health care providers who best understand the community\u2019s unique needs.\n\u201cHugh Chatham Health believes in the power of our two organizations coming together to enhance patient care, community engagement and innovation in health care delivery,\u201d said Hugh Chatham Health Board of Trustees Chair Cynthia Gonzalez.\n\u201cAtrium Health Wake Forest Baptist\u2019s deep commitment and experience with serving rural communities like Elkin was one of the key drivers of our decision to select them as our partner.\u201d\nAtrium Health Wake Forest Baptist was selected, in part, because of its long-standing commitment to rural health care. North Carolina has the second-largest rural population in the United States, with many located in and around the Yadkin Valley area. These rural communities have specific health care challenges, such as recruiting providers and ensuring access to essential services.\nAs part of Atrium Health\u2019s commitment, their $100 million investment will allow Hugh Chatham Health to:\n- Implement a new electronic health record, EPIC, to facilitate seamless care coordination between providers at Hugh Chatham Health and Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist.\n- Advance the recruitment and retention of primary care and specialty care providers to the Yadkin Valley region.\n- Support and expand current clinical programs such as Women\u2019s Services, Heart and Vascular and Cancer Care to ensure essential services stay local.\n- Provide professional and career growth opportunities for Hugh Chatham Health team members and providers.\n\u201cAt a time when rural health care is under pressure across the country, we are stepping up to ensure rural communities have access to leading-edge primary and specialty care close to home \u2013 and that\u2019s what this partnership with Hugh Chatham Health is going to deliver,\u201d said Eugene A. Woods, CEO of Advocate Health, of which Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist is a part. \"This partnership is about ensuring families in the rural Yadkin Valley have access to the same nationally-recognized medicine, virtual care, and specialty programs in women's and children's health, heart and vascular, cancer, and more \u2013 without having to travel far for the care they need and deserve.\u201d\n\u201cWith our 25-year history of collaboration, this next step naturally builds on our shared commitment to deliver high-quality care, while providing access to advanced resources, cutting-edge technology and clinical expertise,\u201d said Dr. David Zaas, president of Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist. \u201cAnd with Wake Forest University School of Medicine as our academic core, we are excited to bring new opportunities for medical innovation and growth, ensuring long-term health and wellness for the communities we serve.\u201d\nIn addition to the $100 million commitment to Hugh Chatham Health, Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist has committed $30 million to establish the Yadkin Valley Wellness Foundation, whose mission will advance health and wellness priorities in the community and ensure that the terms and conditions of the broader affiliation are fully met.\n\u201cFor more than 10 years, I have had the privilege of working with Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist as a partner on many levels,\u201d said Paul Hammes, CEO of Hugh Chatham Health. \u201cI know, firsthand, their deep commitment to high-quality, patient-centered care \u2013 especially in our rural communities. I am excited about the unlimited possibilities of our future together and the positive impact we can have on this community.\u201d\nThe Hugh Chatham Health board and executive team have committed to keeping the community informed as the process moves forward. Patients and community members are encouraged to visit hughchatham.org/the-power-of-together, a dedicated web page to learn more about this partnership and receive timely updates."

      "text": "At Atrium Health, delivering high-quality care means reaching beyond traditional settings to support children and families where they live and learn\u2014including in the classroom. Through its School-Based Virtual Care and School-Based Therapy programs, Atrium Health is increasing access to essential medical and mental health services directly in North Carolina schools. This approach ensures students and staff can receive timely care with minimal disruption to their learning. With the support of Atrium Health Foundation\u2019s generous corporate partners, these initiatives are reaching more communities and making a meaningful difference in the lives of thousands of students.\nCVS Health Expands School-Based Virtual Care\nWith a generous $180,000 grant from CVS Health, Atrium Health Levine Children\u2019s School-Based Virtual Care is expanding its reach in Rutherford County. Funding will allow the program, which already supports elementary and high schools in the area, to serve all three of the county\u2019s middle schools.\nThis expansion ensures that students and staff have access to virtual medical care\u2014including diagnoses, treatments, and prescriptions\u2014without leaving their school. Through secure video technology, physicians can assess and treat students remotely, providing a convenient and effective solution for busy families. Parents can also participate in these visits either in-person or virtually, making health care more accessible without disrupting their work schedules.\nWith over 7,000 students across Rutherford County Schools, the program is expected to complete more than 1,300 virtual visits annually. By addressing both acute and chronic health conditions, the initiative helps keep students healthy and engaged in their education, ultimately supporting their academic success.\nEPIC Launches School-Based Therapy in Two Rural Counties\nAtrium Health\u2019s School-Based Therapy program received a $100,000 grant from EPIC Systems to introduce teletherapy services in Montgomery County Schools and Asheboro City Schools.\nThis initiative, led by Atrium Health Behavioral Health Services in collaboration with Atrium Health Levine Children\u2019s School-Based Virtual Care, will provide critical mental health support to over 8,000 middle and high school students. With limited access to in-person mental health resources in these rural counties, teletherapy offers a vital alternative, ensuring students can receive the care they need in a timely and convenient manner.\nEPIC\u2019s funding will cover essential start-up costs, meeting the increasing demand for mental health support in these communities and ensuring students have access to the help they need to thrive.\nErnst & Young Increases Access to Teletherapy\nFurther strengthening its commitment to student well-being, Ernst & Young has pledged $100,000 to enhance mental health services in rural areas. This generous support will be instrumental in launching teletherapy programs in middle and high schools. The funding will also help offset the cost of therapy sessions for uninsured and underinsured children. By expanding access to care, Ernst & Young is playing a vital role in promoting emotional well-being and academic success for students across the state."

      "text": "Atrium Health Foundation Receives Transformational Award from The Duke Endowment\nMajor grants will advance rural health, education and care team support\nCHARLOTTE, N.C., July 11, 2025 \u2013Atrium Health Foundation was recently awarded over $4 million from The Duke Endowment through five grants that will significantly advance Atrium Health\u2019s commitments to uplifting the communities it serves and advancing rural health initiatives. The award marks the biggest gift the Foundation has received from The Duke Endowment to date.\nThe largest of the grants \u2014 $1.45 million \u2014 will help launch a virtual nursing program at Atrium Health Stanly, making it the first all-wired virtual nursing facility in rural North Carolina. Building upon the success of the virtual nursing program implemented across Advocate Health, of which Atrium Health is a part, Atrium Health Stanly will leverage digital technology to deliver high-quality care to all members of the community. The virtual nursing program, which is expected to create 50 new jobs in Stanly County, will provide significant benefits for both the patients and the care teams.\n\u201cWe are grateful to The Duke Endowment for embracing Atrium Health\u2019s forward-thinking approach to meeting our evolving needs for nursing care,\u201d said Marietta Abernathy, facility executive for Atrium Health Stanly. \u201cHaving cameras in every room will enable our bedside nurses to focus on direct patient care while virtual nurses provide continuous monitoring and timely interventions, helping to reduce hospital readmissions and improve outcomes.\u201d\n\u201cWe are building upon the successes of the Atrium Health Cabarrus Family Medicine Residency Program, which embeds residents in clinics to provide maternity and primary care access,\u201d said Dr. Erika Steinbacher, designated institutional official of Atrium Health Cabarrus and vice-chair of the Department of Family Medicine at Wake Forest School of Medicine. \u201cWe aim to refine this model and replicate it for recruiting, training and retaining physicians in other rural communities we serve.\u201d\nPhysicians across Atrium Health will also receive support from The Duke Endowment through a $559,000 grant that will study the Dragon Ambient eXperience (DAX) Copilot\u2019s impact on clinicians who use the transcription tool\u2019s Spanish-language translation capabilities. The goal is to use the advanced AI-powered tool for translation purposes, which will streamline workflow, enhance clinician and patient experiences and improve access to care.\nIn both rural and urban areas, and through philanthropic support, Atrium Health has addressed access to care by embedding virtual clinics in over 200 schools in 10 counties in North Carolina. To address the need to modernize scheduling for the rapidly growing program, The Duke Endowment awarded a $775,000 grant to develop a user-friendly mobile app and web-based platform. The new technology will improve workflow and communications between schools and Atrium Health.\nA $755,000 grant from The Duke Endowment will support another school-based program \u2014 the Health Sciences Academy at Atrium Health Union. A partnership between Union County Public Schools and Atrium Health, the Academy prepares students for a successful future by providing them with experiences in health sciences careers and pathways. The grant will support a dedicated new headquarters at Atrium Health Union, where students from the Academy\u2019s four school locations will have enhanced learning opportunities, including use of a simulation lab. Funds will also help provide apprenticeship positions.\n\"We share Atrium Health\u2019s commitment to ensuring access to care in communities where people live and work,\u201d said Lin Hollowell, director of health care at The Duke Endowment. \u201cWhether through supporting emerging technologies or enhancing existing programs, together we can make a profound impact on our communities for generations to come.\u201d\nFor more than three decades, The Duke Endowment has remained a visionary supporter of health care initiatives at Atrium Health and has now provided more than $50 million in grants to Atrium Health Foundation."
