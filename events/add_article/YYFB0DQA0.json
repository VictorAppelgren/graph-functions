      "summary": "Fed Beige Book signals a cautious outlook: wage growth is lagging rising costs, consumer spending is muted, and hiring remains restrained amid tariff‑related price pressure. Mixed district views show only Chicago improving, while job openings fell and skilled‑trade shortages persist. Firms are turning to automation and AI to curb costs, and consumer sentiment is 14% below a year ago. Overall, the report underscores a weak demand environment and growing uncertainty across the economy.",
