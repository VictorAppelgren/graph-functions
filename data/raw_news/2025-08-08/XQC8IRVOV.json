  "content": "Major cryptocurrencies rallied on Thursday evening as President Donald Trump signed executive orders integrating digital assets into the U.S. financial system. The crypto market capitalization jumped 3.27% to $3.87 trillion following the landmark policy shift.\n\nTrump\u2019s first executive order directs the Department of Labor to reassess guidance that currently restricts alternative asset exposure in employer-sponsored retirement plans. The directive specifically targets regulations that limit cryptocurrency inclusion in 401(k) portfolios, potentially opening trillions in retirement funds to digital asset investments.\n\nDespite the rally, liquidations remained elevated with 114,295 traders liquidated in the past 24 hours, totaling $389.89 million according to Coinglass data. The largest single liquidation occurred on HTX\u2019s ETH-USDT pair, valued at $34.28 million.\n\nThe CMC Crypto Fear and Greed Index registered 59, indicating neutral market sentiment. The index has maintained neutral territory recently, trading between 50-57 over the past month.\n\nTraditional markets showed mixed results Thursday. The S&P 500 declined 0.08% to 6,340, while the Nasdaq-100 gained 0.32% to 23,389. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.51% to 43,968.64.\n\nFutures markets indicated positive sentiment for Friday\u2019s session. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.32%, Nasdaq-100 futures advanced 0.34%, and Dow futures gained 0.28%.\n\nGold retreated to $3,380 per ounce on Thursday evening as investors took profits, though the metal remains positioned for a second consecutive weekly gain.

      "text": "- Lawmakers like French Hill and Cynthia Lummis praised the orders as steps toward restoring fairness and financial innovation.\n- The actions follow Trump\u2019s broader crypto policy push, including national reserves and efforts to boost institutional crypto access.\n- The market\u2019s back, and these 3 income stocks are thriving. See them here\u2192\nPresident Donald Trump signed two executive orders on Thursday advancing the role of digital assets in the U.S. financial system. One order allows 401(k) retirement plans to include cryptocurrencies, while the other targets what the administration calls discriminatory banking practices against crypto firms.\nThe first order directs the Department of Labor to reassess its guidance, which currently restricts alternative asset exposure in employer-sponsored retirement plans.\nThe move, aimed at revising regulatory interpretations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), also instructs the Securities and Exchange Commission and Treasury Department to consider regulatory updates that could expand retail access to digital assets through accredited investor pathways.\nThis directive builds on Trump's earlier crypto-related actions, including a strategic digital asset reserve and a national initiative to promote U.S. crypto leadership.\nHashdex's Gerry O'Shea described the latest order as an opportunity for retirement plan sponsors to engage digital asset experts on safe and structured inclusion of crypto in long-term portfolios.\nIn a second executive order, Trump moved to prohibit federal regulators from using \u201creputational risk\u201d as a reason to block or discourage banks from servicing crypto companies.\nThis language, used by agencies like the Federal Reserve, has come under scrutiny by lawmakers and the crypto industry, who argue it has been misused to justify account closures and restrict banking access.\nAlso Read: ProShares Introduces Leveraged ETF Targeting Circle\u2019s 2x Daily Stock Returns\nCritics have long argued that such actions amount to a form of \"Operation Choke Point 2.0,\" a reference to a 2013 initiative that limited financial services for industries seen as risky.\nTrump's new order seeks to eliminate that discretion, aligning with prior pledges by the Federal Reserve, OCC, and FDIC to stop using reputational risk as a supervisory standard.\nRepublican lawmakers praised the order.\nHouse Financial Services Chair French Hill (R-AR) called it \"an important step\" toward protecting Americans from politically motivated financial discrimination.\nSenator Cynthia Lummis (R-NY) added that it brings \"transparency and accountability\" to what she characterized as an overreach under the Biden administration.\nBoth orders underscore a broader policy pivot under Trump aimed at normalizing crypto as part of mainstream financial systems.\nWhile the Biden-era Labor Department had cautioned against speculative risks in retirement crypto allocations, Trump's administration is instead positioning digital assets as central to innovation and investor choice.\nRead Next:\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "- TSMC, Apple, and U.S.-based fabs are tariff-proof, positioning select ETFs for gains.\n- Reshoring and U.S.-chip-heavy ETF plays are back in focus.\n- The market\u2019s back, and these 3 income stocks are thriving. See them here\u2192\nIn a step that shook tech supply chains and the semiconductor industry, President Donald Trump stated that his administration would slap a 100% tariff on all foreign-made semiconductors, unless companies pledge to construct fabs in the U.S.\nThe news was made at a press conference in the Oval Office with Apple Inc AAPL CEO Tim Cook, who vowed an extra $100 billion of domestic research and manufacturing spending.\nApple is in focus today. Check its prices live.\nMarkets welcomed the pro-U.S. sentiment. Apple shares bounced about 3% on Thursday, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM, which is exempt from tariffs due to its Arizona expansion, rose to an all-time high.\nBut behind the headline noise is an underlying investing question that comes up: Which ETFs will benefit or suffer as tariffs reshape the global chip landscape?\nWinners\nThe biggest beneficiaries of the tariff theatrics are semiconductor ETFs packed with firms already manufacturing in the U.S. or exempted from the tariffs.\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF SMH: TSM is a heavy holding here, and its exemption is a big win. The ETF increased more than 2% on Thursday, mostly on the coattails of TSM\u2019s 5%+ gain.\niShares Semiconductor ETF SOXX: SOXX has a more diversified basket of U.S. semiconductor titans such as Intel Corp INTC, Broadcom Inc AVGO, and Texas Instruments Inc TXN, all of which have domestic manufacturing. Intel\u2019s tie-up with Taiwan\u2019s United Microelectronics Corp. may also be a tariff deflector.\nInvesco PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXQ: Comparable to SOXX in makeup, but weighted differently, SOXQ could appeal to investors seeking a more U.S.-leaning semiconductor play without overpaying for TSMC exposure.\nWhile the chip company names are in the spotlight, reshoring-focused ETFs could become dark horse champions without notice.\nPacer U.S. Cash Cows 100 ETF COWZ: Investors are looking at this as a means to bet on robust U.S. earnings through industrial growth.\nFirst Trust Nasdaq Clean Edge Smart Grid Infrastructure ETF GRID: Constructing fabs is energy-intensive, and this fund follows companies constructing and modernizing U.S. electrical infrastructure as a backdoor bet on the fab boom.\nThe Apple Of Trump\u2019s Eye\nApple\u2019s $100 billion U.S. investment saved it from both the semiconductor and India tariff threats. That puts ETFs with significant Apple exposure in a pretty good place.\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK: With Apple constituting around 12% of the fund, and Microsoft Corp MSFT, with more than 14% of the portfolio, being a co-AI behemoth with U.S. manufacturing origins, XLK is likely to keep enjoying tariff-protected tech prowess.\nLosers\nWhile countries like Taiwan and South Korea are negotiating for exemptions, here are some ETFs that still stand at the crossroads.\niShares MSCI All Country Asia ex Japan ETF AAXJ: Broad exposure to Asia\u2019s tech supply chain, such as India, Malaysia and other Southeast Asian chip exporters, means this is a risk zone. The Malaysian government is yet to negotiate clarity on U.S. tariff exposure.\nFranklin FTSE South Korea ETF FLKR: While some insulation is provided by Samsung\u2019s U.S. fabs, South Korea is not proof against general tariff shocks. Any redefinition or escalation of \u201cdomestic\u201d production could land these ETFs in the middle.\nFinal Take\nAfter the 100% semiconductor tariff news, market reaction has been more precise, aiming at who\u2019s exempt, who\u2019s widening, and who\u2019s still exposed. Reshoring, infrastructure and U.S.-fab-heavy ETFs are likely to draw new money in the days and weeks to come.\nRead Next:\nPhoto: Shutterstock\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
