  "content": "Z\u00fcrich, 04. Aug (Reuters) - Die Schweizer B\u00f6rse hat am Montag mit deutlichen Einbu\u00dfen auf die von den USA gegen die Schweiz verh\u00e4ngten hohen Z\u00f6lle reagiert. Der Standardwerteindex SMI (.SSMI) fiel im Er\u00f6ffnungshandel um knapp zwei Prozent und lag zuletzt noch 1,1 Prozent im Minus bei 11.709 Punkten. \"Wir glauben, dass es eine gewisse Hoffnung auf eine Einigung \u00fcber die US-Z\u00f6lle f\u00fcr die Schweiz gibt, die das Zollniveau n\u00e4her an die 15-Prozent-Basislinie f\u00fcr andere L\u00e4nder bringen k\u00f6nnte\", erkl\u00e4rte Vontobel-Analyst Mark Diethelm. Bleibe der Zollsatz bei den von Trump festgelegten 39 Prozent bestehen, drohten vor allem den Uhrenherstellern und Maschinenbauern erhebliche Ertragseinbu\u00dfen. Das k\u00f6nnte zu Verlagerungen von Produktionen ins Ausland f\u00fchren.\n\nUS-Pr\u00e4sident Donald Trump hatte am Freitag \u00fcberraschend hohe Z\u00f6lle von 39 Prozent auf Schweizer Waren angek\u00fcndigt und damit die exportorientierte Wirtschaft des Landes alarmiert. Die Schweizer Regierung setzt nun auf schnelle Nachverhandlungen und will alles tun, um guten Willen zu zeigen und das Schweizer Angebot an die USA zu \u00fcberarbeiten, bevor die Z\u00f6lle am 7. August in Kraft treten. Das Kabinett soll im Laufe dieses Montags zu einer Sondersitzung zusammenkommen. Der Aktienmarkt in Z\u00fcrich war am Freitag wegen des Nationalfeiertags geschlossen, w\u00e4hrend andere wichtige Handelspl\u00e4tze zum Wochenschluss wegen der neu aufgeflammten Zollsorgen und der \u00fcberraschend schwachen US-Arbeitsmarktdaten deutlich nachgegeben hatten. Am Montag stieg der Dax (.GDAXI) in Frankfurt um 0,5 Prozent und der EuroStoxx50 (.STOXX50) legte leicht zu.\n\nUnter Abgabedruck standen in Z\u00fcrich der Luxusg\u00fcterhersteller Richemont (CFR.S) und der Uhrenkonzern Swatch (UHR.S) , deren Aktien um 1,5 und 1,7 Prozent absackten. Die Anteile des Elektrotechnikkonzerns ABB (ABBN.S) wurden um 1,5 Prozent tiefer gehandelt und die der Bauchemiefirma Sika (SIKA.S) um zwei Prozent. Die Gro\u00dfbank UBS (UBSG.S) und der Versicherer Z\u00fcrich verloren 1,9 und 1,6 Prozent an Wert.\n\nVon den beiden Pharmariesen hielt sich Novartis (NOVN.S) mit 0,9 Prozent Kursabschlag etwas besser als der Markt, w\u00e4hrend Roche (ROG.S) 1,6 Prozent verlor. Die Branche ist vorerst von den US-Z\u00f6llen ausgenommen. Allerdings h\u00e4ngt \u00fcber der Branche das Damoklesschwert: Pr\u00e4sident Trump hat an zahlreiche Konzerne Briefe verschickt und markant tiefere Medikamentenpreise gefordert.\n\nVergleichsweise gut hielt sich Nestle (NESN.S) mit lediglich 0,2 Prozent Kursminus. Der Lebensmittelkonzern ist das am schwersten gewichtete SMI-Unternehmen und bremste den Abstieg des Index damit merklich. Der inlandorientierte und als dividendenstark geltende Telekomkonzern Swisscom (SCMN.S) legte als einziger Bluechip zu - die Aktien zogen um 2,3 Prozent an.",

  "translation": "Zurich, August 04 (Reuters) - The Swiss stock exchange reacted on Monday with significant losses to the high tariffs imposed by the United States against Switzerland. The default value index SMI (.SSMI) fell by almost two percent in the opening trade and was recently 1.1 percent in the red of 11,709 points. \"We believe that there is a certain hope of an agreement on the US tariffs for Switzerland, which could bring the customs level closer to the 15 percent base line for other countries,\" said Vontobel analyst Mark Diethelm. If the duty of the 39 percent laid down by Trump remains, the watch manufacturers and mechanical engineers in particular threatened significant loss of yield. This could lead to relocations of productions abroad.\n\nUS President Donald Trump had announced surprisingly high tariffs of 39 percent on Swiss goods on Friday and thus alerted the country's export-oriented economy. The Swiss government is now relating to quick renegotiations and wants to do everything to show good will and to revise the Swiss offer to the USA before the tariffs come into force on August 7th. The cabinet should come together for a special meeting during this Monday. The stock market in Zurich was closed on Friday because of the national holiday, while other important trading places had given in significantly at the closing of the week due to the newly flammed customs worries and the surprisingly weak US working market data. On Monday, the Dax (.gdaxi) in Frankfurt rose by 0.5 percent and the EuroStoxx50 (. Stoxx50) increased slightly.\n\nIn Zurich, the luxury goods manufacturer Richemont (CFR.S) and the clock concentrated Swatch (o'clock), whose shares were sucked by 1.5 and 1.7 percent, were under the delivery pressure. The shares of the electrical engineering group ABB (Fign.s) were traded by 1.5 percent and that of the abdominal company Sika (Sika.s) by two percent. The large bank UBS (UBSG.S) and the insurer Zurich lost 1.9 and 1.6 percent in value.\n\nNovartis (Novn.S) kept a slightly better off -road offshift from the two pharmaceutical giants (Novn.s), while Roche (Rog.s) lost 1.6 percent. The industry is initially excluded from the US tariffs. However, the Damocles sword depends on the industry: President Trump has sent letters to numerous corporations and demanded a striking deeper medication prices.\n\nNestle (NESN.S) kept a comparatively well held price minus with only 0.2 percent. The food group is the most heaviest-weighted SMI company and thus noticeably slowed down the descent of the index. The inland -oriented telecom company Swisscom (SCMN.S), which is considered to be dividend, was the only Bluechip - the shares attracted 2.3 percent.",

For example, (i) the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company has enhanced voting rights in circumstances where someone is seeking to obtain a significant shareholding in, or acquire control of, Thomson Reuters and (ii) the prior consent of the Thomson Reuters Founders Share Company must be sought prior to undertaking any sale of, or other material transaction involving, the Reuters news business unit.\nThomson Reuters itself is obliged and committed to apply the Trust Principles to its operations.
