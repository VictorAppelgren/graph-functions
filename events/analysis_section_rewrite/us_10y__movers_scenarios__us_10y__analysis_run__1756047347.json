      "feedback": "Strengths: solid multi‑driver framing (auto cycle, EV profitability, governance, policy) and clear horizon segmentation; actionable edits focus on making the four lines one-sentence, testable, and tightly grounded in the sources. Edit plan: (1) produce exactly four lines in the required Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability% format, each line delivering a single causal chain from driver to observable trigger to watchpoint to outcome; (2) fix horizon discipline so near‑term (0–3 weeks) targets Lucid, and medium/long horizons (6–12m, 12–24m) cover auto/governance/policy, removing duplicates; (3) anchor probabilities to explicit, watchable triggers drawn from the material (e.g., Ford Model E EBIT inflection and EV‑margin recovery with yields toward mid‑4% for Up 6–12m ≈ 60%; Lucid 1.93 break or 2.50 breakout and geopolitics for Down 0–3w ≈ 40%; macro downturn/policy shifts elevating discount rates for Down 12–24m ≈ 45%), and cite the precise source IDs in the final lines only where facts/numbers are asserted; (4) tighten “What to watch” into concrete milestones (e.g., Q2/Q3 2025 updates, rate‑cut realization, EV profitability milestones) and add explicit invalidation rules per line; (5) prune extraneous cross‑topic material, ensure consistency across the four items, and maintain a compact, data‑driven tone aligned with 22PL3Q360, S5GX78VMT, 4LQD15CFU, TN66GHPAT, GX057ADL7, W2622L6WW, J99EM2TPZ, and FOM34PUWA.",
