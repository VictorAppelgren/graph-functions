  "title": "AI data centers made Americans' electricity bills 30% higher",
  "description": "America's data centers could drain as much as 12% of the nation's electricity in the next three years.",
  "content": "Electricity bills are about to get higher for Americans. That is, unless big tech companies foot the bill for their enormous data centers.\n\nOwned by the likes of Amazon, Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta, these data centers drained more than 4% of the nation\u2019s electricity in 2023, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The government agency predicts that number will double or triple to as much as 12% of the country\u2019s electricity by 2028.\n\nMuch of this rapid increase is thanks to the rise of AI, which uses up far more energy than browsing a website or streaming movies, the New York Times reported.\n\nOn average, Americans are paying 30% more for electricity compared to 2020, the publication reported. Electricity bills are on track to rise an average of 8% nationwide by 2030, according to an analysis by Carnegie Mellon University and North Carolina State University. In states with the most data centers, like Virginia, bills could increase as much as 25%.\n\nMany states are already seeing huge price hikes, the NYT reported. In June, the electricity bill for a typical household in Ohio increased at least $15 a month because of data centers, according to local utility data reviewed by the publication. In Texas, electricity demand could double by 2035, local news station KHOU 11 reported.\n\nTech companies say they don\u2019t expect residents and small businesses to eat the cost of their data centers. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to see other customers bearing the cost of us trying to grow,\u201d Microsoft energy procurement lead Bobby Hollis told the NYT.\n\nYet, the same companies have lobbied lawmakers, pitched their own pricing schemes, and invested in power companies to supply their own data centers or sell it wholesale, the NYT reported.\n\nSubsidiaries of major tech companies such as Amazon and Google have sold more than $2.7 billion on the wholesale electricity market in the past decade, according to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission data gathered by the NYT. Amazon, which holds the lion\u2019s share, saw its emissions climb 6% last year driven in part by data center construction, Bloomberg reported.",

      "text": "Domestic Energy Usage from Data Centers Expected to Double or Triple by 2028, DOE Continues to Accelerate Development and Deployment of Solutions to Meet Growing Demand\nDecember 20, 2024WASHINGTON, D.C. \u2014 The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) today announced the publication of the 2024 Report on U.S. Data Center Energy Use produced by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) which outlines the energy use of data centers from 2014 to 2028. The report estimates that data center load growth has tripled over the past decade and is projected to double or triple by 2028. U.S. electricity demand is projected to account for data center expansion and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) applications, domestic manufacturing growth, and electrification of different industries. DOE has anticipated this growing demand trend \u2014 it reflects robust industrial investments in America and national leadership on technology innovation. The Department continues to develop advanced technologies and leverage its resources to meet rising electricity demand in the United States while maintaining a reliable, affordable, and secure national energy system.\n\u201cThe United States has seen an incredible investment in artificial intelligence and other breakthrough technologies over the last decade and a half, and this industrial renaissance has created greater demand on our domestic energy supply,\u201d said U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer M. Granholm. \u201cWe can meet this growth with clean energy. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory\u2019s report on data center energy usage crucially underscores why the Department of Energy has developed and is deploying technologies to enable continued economic growth across American industries.\u201d\nThe report finds that data centers consumed about 4.4% of total U.S. electricity in 2023 and are expected to consume approximately 6.7 to 12% of total U.S. electricity by 2028. The report indicates that total data center electricity usage climbed from 58 TWh in 2014 to 176 TWh in 2023 and estimates an increase between 325 to 580 TWh by 2028.\nDOE is leveraging its resources to meet increasing electricity demand while improving critical infrastructure and advancing American economic competitiveness. DOE resources span the entire power system, from new generation and storage technologies to enhancing and expanding the transmission system to maximizing efficiency and flexibility of demand resources. DOE\u2019s key strategies for meeting data center energy demand include:\n- Enabling data center flexibility through onsite power generation and storage solutions, including the Industrial Efficiency and Decarbonization Office\u2019s Onsite Energy Program and new Industrial Energy Storage Systems Prize, so data centers can be a grid asset rather than a burden.\n- Leveraging energy community opportunities to re-use infrastructure at retired coal facilities for data centers and associated power infrastructure.\n- Engaging with stakeholders on innovative rate structures to support data center expansion while maintaining affordability.\n- Commercializing key enabling technologies such as next-generation geothermal, advanced nuclear, long-duration storage, and efficient semiconductor technologies.\nDOE has over 30 programs that can support data center energy needs and a suite of resources, including DOE\u2019s Electricity Demand Growth Resource Hub, which provides information on DOE tools available to support data center owners and operators, utilities, and regulators. The Department also provides technical assistance to support states, utilities, grid operators and technology developers right-size the grid in the midst of demand growth through the Supercharging the Electric Grid effort. DOE also provides direct support for inquiries through businesshub@hq.doe.gov.\nThe 2024 Report on U.S. Data Center Energy Use was produced by Lawrence Berkley National Laboratory\u2019s (LBNL) Center of Expertise for Energy Efficiency in Data Centers and funded through DOE\u2019s Industrial Efficiency and Decarbonization Office.

      "text": "Data Center Growth Could Increase Electricity Bills 8% Nationally and as Much as 25% in Some Regional Markets\nBy: Michael Blackhurst, Cameron Wade, Joe DeCarolis, Anderson de Queiroz, Jeremiah Johnson, Paulina Jaramillo\nNew modeling from the Open Energy Outlook Initiative shows that data center and cryptocurrency mining growth through 2030 could increase average U.S. electricity generation costs by 8% and greenhouse gas emissions from power generation by 30%.\nWhy it matters: Absent policy action, this increase in demand for electricity generation could lead to dramatically higher electricity bills for consumers and undermine the nation\u2019s clean energy goals.\nFor example, capacity market prices in the nation's largest grid operator (PJM) exploded in December 2024, from $30 to $270 per megawatt-day (MW-day), a ninefold rise that will increase bills for 67 million customers across 13 states.\nCatch up quick: Traditional utility planning assumes predictable 1%-2% annual demand growth over decades, but data centers are driving regional growth rates of 20%-30% annually. This mismatch between conventional planning timelines and demand growth has exposed limitations in capacity planning practices and increased short-run electricity generation costs, with some markets heavily utilizing older and more costly fossil-fuel generators in the short run.\nWhat we did: The Open Energy Outlook (OEO) Initiative, a collaboration between Carnegie Mellon University and North Carolina State University, modeled the energy and emissions implications of expected data center and cryptocurrency mine growth. The analysis models the infrastructure, economic, and environmental implications under current policies and recommends policy tools that could ensure the grid accommodates this expansion while protecting consumers and climate goals.\nWhat we found: Recent model results show that rapid data center demand growth increases generation from aging and expensive coal-fired power generators. In contrast, Texas utilizes more wind generation through targeted transmission investments. These contrasting outcomes underscore that data center growth will drive different regional outcomes.\nOther key findings from the modeling include:\n- Regional cost surge: Central and Northern Virginia face projected 2030 electricity cost increases exceeding 25%, the highest regional increase in the model.\n- Coal gets lifeline: More than 25 GW of aging coal plants otherwise scheduled for retirement would continue operating primarily to serve data center demand.\n- Emissions spike: Power sector emissions could increase 30% compared to scenarios without data center growth, reaching 275 million metric tonnes of CO2 annually by 2030. That matches the entire annual carbon output of France.\n- Carbon leakage: Virginia's data center growth drives increased fossil fuel use in nearby states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia, potentially undermining state and regional climate goals.\nPolicy takeaways: There are several state and federal policy strategies to consider that may mitigate the effects of this expected growth, such as:\n- Fair cost allocation: Create new customer classes and revenue sharing mechanisms to ensure large users rather than families pay for elevated infrastructure costs.\n- Strategic siting incentives: Incentivize data center expansions in renewable-rich regions and away from areas dependent on fossil fuel generation.\n- Transmission acceleration: Improving permitting and cost allocation for transmission lines connecting renewable resources to demand centers.\n- Demand flexibility requirements: Incentivize or require energy efficiency or load management during peak periods or emergencies.\nWhat's next: Data center and crypto mining electricity demand is projected to grow 350% by 2030. Without intervention, the pattern seen in PJM \u2014 massive price spikes followed by political backlash \u2014 will become more frequent. Continued investment in energy systems modeling resources like those maintained by the Open Energy Outlook Initiative can help identify policy interventions that balance the benefits and costs of increased data server activity.\nThe bottom line: The digital infrastructure boom is outpacing our electricity system\u2019s ability to respond. Data centers offer potential benefits but risk locking in higher emissions and driving up prices for households without proactive and coordinated planning. Policymakers must act now to align infrastructure investment and regulation with this demand surge."
