  "title": "De Vinck: Hunger and the consequences of ignorance",
  "description": "De Vinck writes about hunger in Gaza and the real consequences of ignoring this issue.",
  "content": "What we have in common is a disdain for ignorance. As a boy, I believed my grandfather, a retired general in the Belgian army, owned the ocean liner he and my grandmother used during their annual arrival in the New York harbor. I remember my grandfather leaning over the railing and waving to my parents and me. Easy to think the boat was his.\n\nWhen I was a boy, I believed that my brain was as small as a pea because during a raucous day in my first-grade classroom, Sister Elizabeth Anne, in frustration, made a tiny mark on the blackboard, scolded us and said, \u201cYour brains are as small as this dot.\u201d\n\nWhen I was a boy, I believed that the moon generated its own light, and that whales had special rooms in their bodies filled with chairs and couches for Jonah\u2019s comfort whenever he fell into the ocean.\n\nWhen I was a boy standing on a New Jersey beach, I was sure that I could see London.\n\nWhen I was a boy, I was convinced that the garter snake that lived in the rocks by the stream could, at any moment, emerge from the darkness and swallow me. I saw on television how snakes in Asia swallow entire boars.\n\nWhen my brothers and sister dared me to run out in the dark and slap the back of the chicken coop, I believed there were wolves, or bandits, pirates, or ghosts, even Billy next door, waiting to drag me into the swamp and toss me in among the alligators. I believed, as a boy, there were alligators in the New Jersey swamps.\n\nIgnorance has consequences. As PBS News reported last month, \u201cIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says no one in Gaza is starving: \u2018There is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza. We enable humanitarian aid throughout the duration of the war to enter Gaza \u2014 otherwise, there would be no Gazans.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe World Health Organization reported that 63 Palestinians had died from malnutrition last July. The United Nations estimates 100,000 Palestinian women and children face severe malnutrition, and a third of the population of 2.1 million hasn\u2019t eaten in days.\n\nIn John Steinbeck\u2019s novel The Grapes of Wrath, when the desperate farmers migrating through the Dust Bowl were at the very end of their hopes to survive their acute hunger:\n\n\u201cThe women watched the men, watched to see whether the break had come at last. The women stood silently and watched. And where a number of men gathered together, the fear went from their faces, and anger took its place. And the women sighed with relief, for they knew it was all right \u2014 the break had not come; and the break would never come as long as fear could turn to wrath.\u201d\n\nThe women believed that the men would hang on and manage the famine. The Oklahoma farmers were ignorant of the politics and greed that forced them from their land. They were ignorant in their belief that California was the Promised Land.\n\nChildren fear snakes and pirates; adults believe what they are told, not what they know for a fact. Ignorance is a partisan disease.\n\nPresident Franklin Roosevelt provided critical relief in response to the Dust Bowl and laid the foundation that pulled us out of the Great Depression with his New Deal: extraordinary government intervention that offered reform and relief that still contributes today to our national stability inside our economy and inside our homes.\n\nThere is no leadership in Washington to battle hunger in our country and in the world. We need an international New Deal created beyond politics and beyond borders, the art of the deal to place bread and milk into the mouths of children. To pretend people aren\u2019t starving to death is to perpetuate an ignorant myth.\n\nIn Steinbeck\u2019s novel, Tom Joad delivers some of the most famous lines in American literature:\n\nThen I\u2019ll be all aroun\u2019 in the dark. I\u2019ll be everywhere \u2014 wherever you look. Wherever they\u2019s a fight so hungry people can eat, I\u2019ll be there. Wherever they\u2019s a cop beatin\u2019 up a guy, I\u2019ll be there. ... I\u2019ll be in the way kids laugh when they\u2019re hungry an\u2019 they know supper\u2019s ready. An\u2019 when our folks eat the stuff they raise an\u2019 live in the houses they build \u2014 why, I\u2019ll be there. See?\u201d\n\nWho will be there when an emaciated, starving child vomits bile in her mother\u2019s arms and dies? See?",

  "summary": "David De Vinck argues that ignorance can lead to a lack of leadership in the United States and the world, particularly in the case of ignorance. He shares his personal experiences from childhood where he believed his grandfather, a retired general in the Belgian army, owned the ocean liner he and his grandmother used during their annual arrival in the New York harbor. DeVinck also believes that the moon generates its own light and whales have special rooms in their bodies for whale comfort when they fall into the ocean. He criticizes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for claiming that no one in Gaza is starving, stating that humanitarian aid is allowed throughout the duration of the war. The World Health Organization reported that 63 Palestinians died from malnutrition last July, and the United Nations estimates that 100,000 Palestinian women and children face severe malnutrition, with a third of the population of 2.1 million estimated to be under severe malnutrition. The author suggests that an international New Deal should be created beyond politics to place bread and milk into the mouths of children.",

      "text": "People are dying of malnutrition in Gaza. How does starvation kill you?\nThe boy made no sounds, recalls Dr. Ibrahim Alashi. Not a cry. Not even a whimper. Severe starvation had robbed him of even that, he says.\n\"When I first saw him, I was shocked. His body was extremely thin \u2014 extremely thin \u2014 just skin and bones,\" Alashi told NPR. He is a dentist who is seeing malnourished patients as a volunteer in a Gaza City clinic. \"He had no energy to speak, barely any energy to even lift his knee.\"\nThe eerily quiet child was a 9-year-old boy whom Alashi treated. The boy, he says, lay limp in his mother's arms, his body ravaged by severe malnutrition.\nThe boy is one of the many thousands in Gaza suffering from what the U.N. is calling \"catastrophic hunger\" as a result of Israel's blockade and military offensive.\nCatastrophic \u2014 and potentially fatal. The World Health Organization now says a \"worst-case scenario of famine\" has reached much of the region. In July alone, WHO reported that 63 Palestinians have died from malnutrition. The U.N. estimates 100,000 Palestinian women and children face severe malnutrition and a third of the population of 2.1 million hasn't eaten in days.\nGaza is not the only part of the world where starvation looms. The U.N. World Food Programme list of regions with the most people facing catastrophic hunger also cites Haiti, Mali, South Sudan, Sudan and Yemen. Conflict and climate conditions are typically the root causes.\nWith hunger crises unfolding across the globe, many people may be asking a terrible but timely question: What is it like to starve to death?\nThe five phases of starvation\nHunger is universal \u2014 even babies feel it. They first show it with subtle cues, like turning their head to look for a nipple or making sucking motions. If these go unnoticed and hunger grows, they cry.\n\"There's nothing quite like the cry of a hungry child. It's a completely unique sound that just somehow cuts right to your heart,\" Dr. Kevin Stephenson, a malnutrition expert at Washington University in St. Louis, says. He adds that the body's internal hunger barometer is essential for survival.\nWhen hunger persists, starvation begins. It starts when people don't get enough calories to keep up with the body's energy needs. The cause can vary: food shortages, underlying infections, psychiatric causes like anorexia nervosa, impaired absorption of nutrients or an inability to ingest food.\nIn Gaza, the driving force is simply the lack of food. That's the quickest path to malnutrition \u2014 the clinical condition that results from prolonged starvation \u2014 because it results in an immediate and total cessation of energy and nutrient intake. With no external fuel, the body launches a cascade of survival mechanisms to stay alive.\nThe body's physiologic response is broken down into five metabolic adaptations. Each phase overlaps with the others and is characterized by shifts in the body's use of energy stores \u2014 carbohydrates, fats and protein as it strives to survive.\n\"If you're not eating enough, we have evolved mechanisms for how to stay alive,\" Stephenson says. \"We basically eat our own body for nutrition.\"\nPhase 1\nThe first phase of fasting is far from catastrophic. In fact, everyone feels it. You eat dinner, then sleep \u2014 and during the hours of slumber, the body turns to its most accessible fuel source: carbohydrates.\n\"The carbohydrate stores in our liver are like protein bars that our body has evolved to be able to tap into,\" Stephenson explains.\nIf food is not ingested the next day, the body consumes its carbohydrate stores, hunger sets in and weight loss begins. Sometimes, there may be stomach rumbling, caused by rhythmic contractions to clear any residual food from the digestive tract.\nPhase 2\nThe carbohydrate reserves run dry by day one or two of food deprivation. This prompts a transition to phase two, where the body uses fats as its primary energy source. Because carbohydrate stores are depleted, the levels of sugar in the blood are low, which can cause fatigue, lightheadedness or dizziness.\nPhase 3\nUsually by the third day without food, the body begins the third phase of starvation: The liver begins to convert fats into ketones \u2014 energy-rich molecules that serve as emergency fuel for the brain. Some of the initial low blood sugar symptoms persist, but as ketone production ramps up the body compensates. Some individuals report greater mental clarity and a reduced desire to eat.\nDespite the body's low blood sugar from depleted carbohydrate stores, signs of hypoglycemia like tremor, anxiety and sweating don't appear. That's because ketones provide an alternative energy source, preventing the warning signs of low blood sugar.\nPhase 4\nIn the fourth stage, the body attempts to slam the brakes on starvation by lowering the metabolic rate \u2014 like switching on low-power mode to conserve energy. Heart rate and blood pressure drop. People cut back on physical activity instinctively but also because their bodies become weaker.\nHormone levels are adjusted as the body shifts into an energy conservation state: not because hormone production itself uses lots of energy but because the body prioritizes its most essential functions. Hormones that are important but not critical to survival are dialed down. Thyroid hormones drop, causing fatigue and lethargy, and reproductive hormones dip, which can lower libido and halt menstrual periods.\nPhase 5\nThe depletion of fat stores can take anywhere from a few weeks to months, depending on the person's fat reserves. That's when the final phase of starvation begins as the body breaks down proteins from its own muscles.\n\"The body tries to preserve muscle as best it can because muscle is very metabolically demanding to build,\" Stephenson says. \"But ultimately, though, it gives up and says, 'I'm gonna die if I don't get protein here.'\" Once proteins are broken down, they enter the bloodstream and are used to fuel the body.\nBy this point, signs of muscle wasting and weakness appear. The body also produces less albumin \u2014 a protein that helps maintain fluid balance \u2014 leading to swelling in the legs and abdomen. Physical appearance changes noticeably: Skin becomes thin and dry, hair turns brittle, the eyes appear sunken and weight loss becomes more severe.\nThese physical changes eventually lead to severe malnutrition, which falls into two categories: marasmus and kwashiorkor. Marasmus is characterized by the body consuming its own muscle and fat, leaving patients frail with visible skeletal outlines. Kwashiorkor, on the other hand, results from a severe protein deficiency. It presents with swelling of the legs and abdomen.\nThis fifth and final phase \u2014 the breakdown of proteins for energy that's known as protein catabolism \u2014 varies in length. Adults can survive up to 60 days without any food as long as they have access to water, a time span based on case studies of hunger strikes. But eventually, the body shuts down.\nAs the body breaks down proteins in this final stage, vital organs like the heart aren't spared \u2014 the heart muscle thins and weakens. The immune system, gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys weaken, too. In this stage of starvation, death often comes from an infection the body is too weak to fight or from an abnormal heart rhythm that can lead to sudden cardiac arrest. In these cases, starvation is still the underlying cause of death.\nNot everyone is at the same risk of dying from starvation. The healthier someone is, the better their chances of survival. Also, certain demographics are at higher risk, like the elderly, people with preexisting conditions, pregnant people and children.\nPregnancy adds to the risks\nAmong the most vulnerable are pregnant people, whose bodies are under intense metabolic stress because of the need to nourish the fetus.\n\"The energy requirements of pregnancy make the need for adequate nutrition even more imperative,\" says Dr. Mariam Gomaa, an OBGYN from Washington, D.C.\nStarvation reprograms some of the genes responsible for fetal growth, passing these modifications down to future generations. While the body tries to preserve the womb, there are limits to what it can do, Gomaa explains.\nThat uncomfortable reality is settling in for Alashi's pregnant patients.\n\"She looked very exhausted and incredibly frail,\" Alashi says of a patient he treated who was eight months pregnant. \"What stayed with me was what she said before leaving. She said, 'I can survive hunger, but I don't think my baby can.'\"\nThe timing of starvation in pregnancy is critical. If it occurs early in pregnancy, the effects on the fetus are most severe. Babies born to these mothers face many obstacles, including preterm birth, stunting, impaired immune function and long-term risks for noncommunicable diseases like diabetes.\nAfter delivery, problems persist for the mom. Gomaa says malnourished moms often struggle with breastfeeding, which further compromises infant growth and immune function. If starvation continues after the postpartum period, moms are faced with agonizing decisions.\n\"If there are kids starving, their moms are starving, too,\" Stephenson says. \"The mom is going to do everything she can to get her kids food. In some cultures around the world, unfortunately, the mom is the last person to eat.\"\nStarvation hits kids hard\nKids are even more at risk of starvation than adults because of the demanding physiological requirements for growth and fewer energy stores. Last year, UNICEF estimated that 12.2 million children faced severe malnutrition, which is defined as children who are dangerously underweight for their height or age. South Asia was the hardest-hit region.\nStephenson says children can die within a week of eating little to no food, especially if they develop an infection, which further depletes energy stores and rapidly worsens their condition.\n\"It's so, so common to hear this story from a mom: 'My kid was irritable and felt hot. I took them to a local doctor, and within two hours, they were dead,'\" Stephenson says. \"When you have severe malnutrition, you're just on a knife's edge. It only takes one little thing for you to tip over.\"\nSome kids with underlying illnesses \u2014 like pneumonia or diarrhea \u2013 paradoxically lose their appetite because their body decreases production of hunger hormones and a weakened digestive tract makes eating uncomfortable.\nIn even more severe cases, children can lose their ability to swallow. Swallowing dysfunction has multiple causes, but it's primarily driven by protein breakdown, which leads to muscle loss in the jaw, disrupted coordination of the swallowing reflex and difficulty using the mouth muscles needed for eating.\n\"Swallowing is so fundamental to survival, and so I think that speaks to how severe this condition is,\" Stephenson says. \"Eventually, you can just get sick enough that the parts of your brain that stimulate you to eat stop working.\"\nThe treatment is simple: food and water. \"It's not a mystery of how to treat this. There are lots of complicated things that we can't fix in the world, but severe malnutrition is not one of them,\" Stephenson emphasizes.\nMany kids receive a peanut paste to help stave off starvation. For those who have lost their appetite or can't swallow, a feeding tube is usually required. These children are at a higher risk of refeeding syndrome, a dangerous shift in electrolytes that can cause abnormal heart rhythms.\nIf a child remains untreated, studies show that mortality rates for severe malnutrition can range from 10% to as high as 40%. Those who survive face long-term consequences, including stunted growth, developmental delays and increased risk of recurrent illness and mortality. Long-term studies link the effects of severe malnutrition in childhood to poorer test scores, lower educational attainment and difficulty keeping a job later in life.\n\"It is possible, if you get them through that one bad, worst period of their childhood, that they could be OK,\" Stephenson says optimistically. \"All hope is not lost.\"\nWhen a child reaches this level of malnutrition, their behaviors become antithetical to normal survival instincts \u2014 a pattern seen in adults, too.\n\"Kids with severe malnutrition can appear very apathetic, listless and uninterested,\" Stephenson explains. \"It looks like they've given up, like they just have no energy to do anything. Even if inside they feel like they're dying in terrible pain, they can't even manifest a cry to signal to their caregivers that they need something.\"\nDr. Alashi, the dentist who volunteers at the Gaza clinic, recalls this disquieting quiet in the 9-year-old he treated. \"What stood out most to me was how silent he was,\" Alashi told NPR.\n\"His mother kept crying, saying she hadn't heard him laugh or speak in days,\" Alashi adds. \"We are watching the destruction of a generation.\"\nAlashi diagnosed the boy with marasmus. Though the child is still alive, Alashi told NPR last Thursday that the youngster is \"on the edge of death.\""

      "text": "Malnutrition is on a dangerous trajectory in the Gaza Strip, marked by a spike in deaths in July.\nOf 74 malnutrition-related deaths in 2025, 63 occurred in July \u2013 including 24 children under five, a child over five, and 38 adults. Most of these people were declared dead on arrival at health facilities or died shortly after, their bodies showing clear signs of severe wasting.\nThe crisis remains entirely preventable. Deliberate blocking and delay of large-scale food, health, and humanitarian aid has cost many lives.\nNearly one in five children under five in Gaza City is now acutely malnourished, as reported by Nutrition Cluster partners. Global Acute Malnutrition (GAM), which measures the percentage of children aged 6\u201359 months suffering from acute malnutrition, has tripled since June, making it the worst-hit area in the Gaza Strip. In Khan Younis and the Middle Area, rates have doubled in less than one month. These figures are likely an underestimation due to the severe access and security constraints preventing many families from reaching health facilities.\nSo far in July, over 5000 children under five have already been admitted for outpatient treatment of malnutrition in just the first two weeks, 18% of them with Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM), the most life-threatening form. This continues a significant rising trend since May, with 6500 children admitted for treatment in June, which is the highest number recorded since October 2023.\nAn additional 73 children with SAM and medical complications were hospitalized in July, compared to 39 in June, bringing total inpatient admissions in 2025 to 263. This surge in cases is overwhelming the only four specialized malnutrition treatment centres in the Gaza Strip, pushing an already fragile health system closer to collapse. All four centres are working beyond capacity, running low on fuel, with their supplies expected to run out by mid-next month. Health workers are exhausted, and the breakdown of water and sanitation systems is accelerating the spread of disease, driving a dangerous cycle of illness and death.\nThe crisis is taking a severe toll on pregnant and breastfeeding women. Recent Nutrition Cluster screening data shows that over 40% are severely malnourished. The situation is most critical in the Middle Area, where rates have tripled compared to June, and in Gaza City and Khan Younis, where they have doubled.\nIt is not only hunger that is killing people, but also the desperate search for food. Families are being forced to risk their lives for a handful of food, often under dangerous and chaotic conditions. Since 27 May, more than 1060 people have been killed and 7200 injured while trying to access food.\nWHO calls for urgent, sustained efforts to flood the Gaza Strip with diverse, nutritious food, and to expedite the delivery of therapeutic supplies for children and vulnerable groups, as well as essential medicines and supplies. This flow must remain consistent and unhindered to support recovery and prevent further deterioration. WHO reiterates its call for the protection of civilians and health. WHO also calls for the release of our detained colleague, the release of hostages, and for an immediate ceasefire."

Data and witnesses disagree World Jul 28, 2025 5:17 PM EDT Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says no one in Gaza is starving: \u201cThere is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza. We enable humanitarian aid throughout the duration of the war to enter Gaza \u2013 otherwise, there would be no Gazans.\u201d President Donald Trump on Monday said he disagrees with Netanyahu\u2019s claim of no starvation in Gaza, noting the images emerging of emaciated people: \u201cThose children look very hungry.\u201d After international pressure, Israel over the weekend announced humanitarian pauses, airdrops and other measures meant to allow more aid to Palestinians in Gaza. But people there say little or nothing has changed on the ground. The U.N. has described it as a one-week scale-up of aid, and Israel has not said how long these latest measures would last. WATCH: Israel increases food aid to Gaza amid outrage over growing reports of starvation \u201cThis aid, delivered in this way, is an insult to the Palestinian people,\u201d said Hasan Al-Zalaan, who was at the site of an airdrop as some fought over the supplies and crushed cans of chickpeas littered the ground. Israel asserts that Hamas is the reason aid isn\u2019t reaching Palestinians in Gaza and accuses its militants of siphoning off aid to support its rule in the territory. The U.N. denies that looting of aid is systematic and that it lessens or ends entirely when enough aid is allowed to enter Gaza. Here\u2019s what we know: Deaths are increasing Ahmed Abu Haleeb holds his baby who died due to malnutrition, according to health officials. Photo taken in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip on July 26. Photo by Ramadan Abed/Reuters The World Health Organization said Sunday there have been 63 malnutrition-related deaths in Gaza this month, including 24 children under the age of 5 \u2014 up from 11 deaths total the previous six months of the year. Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry puts the number even higher, reporting 82 deaths this month of malnutrition-related causes: 24 children and 58 adults. It said Monday that 14 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours. The ministry, which operates under the Hamas government, is headed by medical professionals and is seen by the U.N. as the most reliable source of data on casualties. U.N. agencies also often confirm numbers through other partners on the ground. The Patient\u2019s Friends Hospital, the main emergency center for malnourished kids in northern Gaza, says this month it saw for the first time malnutrition deaths in children who had no preexisting conditions. Some adults who died suffered from such illnesses as diabetes or had heart or kidney ailments made worse by starvation, according to Gaza medical officials. The WHO also says acute malnutrition in northern Gaza tripled this month, reaching nearly one in five children under 5 years old, and has doubled in central and southern Gaza.

Donate now By \u2014 Cara Anna, Associated Press Cara Anna, Associated Press\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says no one in Gaza is starving: \u201cThere is no policy of starvation in Gaza, and there is no starvation in Gaza. We enable humanitarian aid throughout the duration of the war to enter Gaza \u2013 otherwise, there would be no Gazans.\u201d President Donald Trump on Monday said he disagrees with Netanyahu\u2019s claim of no starvation in Gaza, noting the images emerging of emaciated people: \u201cThose children look very hungry.\u201d After international pressure, Israel over the weekend announced humanitarian pauses, airdrops and other measures meant to allow more aid to Palestinians in Gaza. But people there say little or nothing has changed on the ground. The U.N. has described it as a one-week scale-up of aid, and Israel has not said how long these latest measures would last. WATCH: Israel increases food aid to Gaza amid outrage over growing reports of starvation \u201cThis aid, delivered in this way, is an insult to the Palestinian people,\u201d said Hasan Al-Zalaan, who was at the site of an airdrop as some fought over the supplies and crushed cans of chickpeas littered the ground. Israel asserts that Hamas is the reason aid isn\u2019t reaching Palestinians in Gaza and accuses its militants of siphoning off aid to support its rule in the territory. The U.N. denies that looting of aid is systematic and that it lessens or ends entirely when enough aid is allowed to enter Gaza. Here\u2019s what we know: Deaths are increasing Ahmed Abu Haleeb holds his baby who died due to malnutrition, according to health officials. Photo taken in Khan Younis, southern Gaza Strip on July 26. Photo by Ramadan Abed/Reuters The World Health Organization said Sunday there have been 63 malnutrition-related deaths in Gaza this month, including 24 children under the age of 5 \u2014 up from 11 deaths total the previous six months of the year. Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry puts the number even higher, reporting 82 deaths this month of malnutrition-related causes: 24 children and 58 adults. It said Monday that 14 deaths were reported in the past 24 hours. The ministry, which operates under the Hamas government, is headed by medical professionals and is seen by the U.N. as the most reliable source of data on casualties. U.N. agencies also often confirm numbers through other partners on the ground. The Patient\u2019s Friends Hospital, the main emergency center for malnourished kids in northern Gaza, says this month it saw for the first time malnutrition deaths in children who had no preexisting conditions. Some adults who died suffered from such illnesses as diabetes or had heart or kidney ailments made worse by starvation, according to Gaza medical officials. The WHO also says acute malnutrition in northern Gaza tripled this month, reaching nearly one in five children under 5 years old, and has doubled in central and southern Gaza. The U.N. says Gaza\u2019s only four specialized treatment centers for malnutrition are \u201coverwhelmed.\u201d The leading international authority on food crises, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, has warned of famine for months in Gaza but has not formally declared one, citing the lack of data as Israel restricts access to the territory.

  "argos_summary": "The article reports a severe famine\u2011like crisis in Gaza, with 63 malnutrition\u2011related deaths in July 2025, including 24 children under five, and a sharp rise in acute malnutrition cases. It highlights that Israel\u2019s blockade and limited humanitarian pauses have impeded food delivery, with aid trucks arriving at less than half the needed daily volume and many supplies looted or delayed. WHO and UN agencies warn of a looming famine, calling for sustained, unhindered food aid and a ceasefire, while Israeli officials deny a starvation policy and blame Hamas for aid diversion.
