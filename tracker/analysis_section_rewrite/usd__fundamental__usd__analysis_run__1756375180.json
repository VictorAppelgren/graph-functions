      "feedback": "Your draft is a solid starting point but still falls short of a world‑class, multi‑year structural analysis. 1) **Depth & Coherence** – The causal chains are sketched but lack the rigorous, first‑principles logic required for a structural view.  For soy, you need to quantify the supply‑side shock: estimate the % of Brazil’s 97 Mt that is Amazon‑grown, the elasticity of export supply, and how the moratorium shifts the supply curve (e.g., a 5–10 % reduction in supply could lift prices by 3–5 % given the current 5‑year average spread).  Link this to the real‑rate differential (Brazil’s 3‑month T‑bill vs. US) and the terms‑of‑trade (price/interest‑rate ratio).  2) **Alignment & Length** – The analysis should be a single, tightly‑structured paragraph (≈200 words) that follows the format: regime → transition → causal chain → base case → key risks → watch list → confidence.  3) **Quantification & Sources** – Replace generic “supply‑side shock” with numbers: e.g., “the moratorium cuts Amazon‑grown soy by ~2 Mt (≈2 % of total exports)”, cite the 97 Mt figure (J54PXL0NV) and the 344 % growth/69 % deforestation data (J54PXL0NV).  For the dollar, quote the 79 % cut‑off probability (IBGK2IRII) and the 98.337 index level.  For Mizuho/MUFG, state the $1.3 trillion AUM, the 5 % of AUM outside Japan, and the $1.8 bn acquisition of Macquarie (PA57YBYVQ).  4) **Causal Chain & Market Transmission** – Explicitly map how the moratorium → reduced Amazon‑grown soy → higher domestic production costs → higher export prices → tighter US‑Brazil trade balance → higher Brazilian real rate → stronger peso.  For the dollar, show Fed dovish signal → lower real rates → higher risk‑premium → dollar depreciation.  5) **Citation Density** – Every key figure or claim must have a citation ID: e.g., “97 Mt (J54PXL0NV)”, “79 % probability (IBGK2IRII)”, “$1.3 trn AUM (PA57YBYVQ)”.  6) **Conflict Reconciliation** – If sources disagree (e.g., different export volumes), note the discrepancy and choose the most recent or authoritative source.  7) **Risk & Watch List** – List specific triggers: (a) Brazil court overturns moratorium → supply surge; (b) Fed surprises with dovish policy → dollar slides >5 %; (c) Trump‑Putin summit ends in a ceasefire → commodity risk premium compresses; (d) EU imposes new sanctions → Brazilian soy export costs rise.  8) **Confidence** – Quantify confidence (e.g., “moderate (60 %)”) and explain that the structural anchors are solid but the high sensitivity to policy shocks lowers certainty.  **Actionable edits**: rewrite the paragraph to include the above quantitative anchors, tighten the causal chain, add missing citations, and trim extraneous narrative.  Ensure the final piece is no longer than 200 words and follows the prescribed structure.",
