      "feedback": "The draft is ineligible because it centers on crypto (Ether) – an asset that does **not** map to any of the canonical handles (indices, rates, FX, commodities, credit/vol). The acceptance gate requires at least one canonical handle with a clear sign/magnitude and a dated catalyst window, which the current text lacks. To salvage the brief, replace the crypto focus with a canonical asset that the Fed policy directly drives (e.g., UST 10 yr, DXY, or S&P 500). Re‑write the paragraph into 4–6 concise sentences, explicitly linking Fed cuts to the chosen handle (e.g., “A 25‑bp September cut will lift UST 10 yr by ~30 bp, boosting the DXY by 0.5–1 %”), include the Jackson Hole catalyst, and retain the risk list (inflation acceleration, regulatory tightening, liquidity squeeze). Ensure every claim has an inline citation (OGK8WLL69, B1KYJ1GPU, etc.) and that the brief ends with a confidence rating.",
