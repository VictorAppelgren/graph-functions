  "description": "Firefly is the third space company to go public this year after Voyager Technology and Karman Holdings.",
  "content": "Firefly Aerospace stock opened at $70 in its Nasdaq debut after the company priced shares above its expected range. Trading under ticker symbol FLY, the stock's initial price values the company at close to $10 billion. Space technology has gained momentum in recent years as companies such as Elon Musk's SpaceX amass more funding and government contracts. Firefly is the third space company to go public this year after Voyager Technology and Karman Holdings. The rocket and lunar lander maker priced shares late Wednesday at $45, above its expected range of $41 to $43, raising $868 million. Earlier this week, Firefly had hiked its range up from the $35 to $39 it initially expected. Firefly's customers have included a growing list of key defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin and L3Harris, and the company recently received a $50 million from Northrop Grumman . Last month, Firefly also won a $177 million contract with NASA.\n\n\"It's all about execution,\" CEO Jason Kim told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Thursday. \"We're focused on rating up our alpha rockets because there's so much demand for the response of dedicated one-ton launches from national security, commercial, as well as hypersonic missile testing.\" Earlier this year, Firefly's Blue Ghost lunar lander successfully touched down on the moon in a mission funded by NASA. Firefly is also widely known for its Alpha rocket and has said in its IPO filing that its backlog totaled about $1.1 billion at the end of March. In its IPO filing, Firefly said revenue in the latest quarter jumped sixfold to $55.9 million from $8.3 million. However, the company reported a net loss of about $60.1 million, up from $52.8 million in the year-ago period. Beyond just space, the tech IPO market has started to heat up this year after an extended dry spell due to high inflation and rising interest rates. Figma , Circle and CoreWeave have all debuted in 2025 and seen their stocks pop.",

      "text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook and President Donald Trump on Wednesday announced that the iPhone maker will spend an additional $100 billion on U.S. companies and suppliers over the next four years.\nThe company said its investment would incentivize overseas companies to buy more U.S.-made parts. The commitment is on top of a $500 billion announcement that Apple made in February.\n\"This is the largest investment Apple has ever made in America and anywhere else,\" Trump said. \"As you know, Apple has been an investor in other countries a little bit, I won't say which ones, but a couple, and they're coming home.\"\nTrump said that he expects new U.S. factories to be built soon based on his policies.\n\"There are a lot of factories and a lot of plants that are either under construction or soon we'll be starting construction,\" Trump said. \"So can't tell you exactly when, but I want to be around a year from now.\"\nApple on Wednesday said it created the so-called American Manufacturing Program that includes Corning, Coherent, GlobalWafers, Applied Materials, Texas Instruments, Samsung, GlobalFoundries, Amkor and Broadcom.\nThe company said it would spend $2.5 billion to fund a major expansion with Corning, which makes glass for iPhones in Kentucky. Apple said that all glass for iPhones and Apple Watches will be manufactured in the U.S. at Corning's facility.\nAt the White House, Cook presented Trump with a souvenir based on Corning's glass.\nApple also said it had a multiyear supply agreement with Coherent to produce lasers for the iPhone's facial recognition system.\nThe company said its U.S.-based supply chain would produce more than 19 billion chips for its products this year. That's including chips made by TSMC in Arizona, Apple said. It also includes U.S.-made wafers from GlobalWafers and chips from Texas Instruments.\nApple said it would collaborate with Texas Instruments to install additional tools in factories in Utah and Texas. GlobalFoundries, a U.S.-based foundry that manufactures older chips particularly for the U.S. government, will manufacture wireless charging technology in New York for Apple.\nThe iPhone maker said its goal was to have an \"end-to-end\" supply chain, which means that every part of the chipmaking process can take place on American soil.\nEarlier this year, Apple said it would invest $500 million in a rare earths miner and that it would build AI servers at a factory in Texas.\n\"Oh, I love that you're doing this,\" Trump said after reading a list of Apple's announcements.\n\"President Trump shared some kind words about that work, but he also asked us to think about what more we could commit to doing,\" Cook said about Apple's earlier initial $500 billion commitment. \"Mr. President, we took that challenge very seriously.\"\nTrump has criticized Apple and Cook for not making its smartphones in the U.S., a move that Apple has never signaled that it is likely to make. Experts say that moving production of a high-volume, complicated electronics product like the iPhone to the U.S. would be economically infeasible and could take years.\nWhen asked about the possibility of making the iPhone in the U.S. on Wednesday, Cook said that many of the parts inside the device were made in the U.S.\n\"If you look at the bulk of it, we're doing a lot of the semiconductors here, we're doing the glass here, we're doing the face ID module here,\" Cook said.\nNot Apple's first U.S. commitment\nApple has made similar announcements in the past. In 2018, under pressure during the first Trump administration, Apple committed to spend $350 billion in the U.S. over five years, or about $70 billion per year. In 2021, Apple announced plans to spend $430 billion over five years, or $86 billion per year in the U.S. Wednesday's announcement has the company at $600 billion over four years, or $125 billion per year.\nMuch of what Apple has announced has come to fruition, although the company doesn't report its U.S. spending on an annual basis and suppliers generally don't break out how much revenue comes from Apple.\nThe company also faces increased tariffs that could hurt its profits. It's currently paying for tariffs placed on Chinese imports earlier this year, and faces increased import taxes on semiconductors when the Trump Administration finishes a so-called Section 232 investigation.\nTrump said on Wednesday that he planned to impose a 100% tariff on semiconductors and chips, but that Apple was exempt because it is committing to build in the U.S.\nApple in May said that the majority of phones it's selling in the U.S. are assembled in India to avoid Chinese tariffs, and although tariffs on India are going up to 25%, White House sources told CNBC that the iPhone maker will be \"largely unaffected\" by the India tariffs. Apple said that tariffs could cost the company $1.1 billion in the current quarter.\nIn 2017, Apple announced that it was creating a $1 billion manufacturing fund, which would go towards future purchase commitments with U.S. suppliers. Apple raised that to $10 billion earlier this year. Corning, one of the participants in Wednesday's announcement, previously got two public commitments from Apple's manufacturing fund.\nIn 2021, Apple said that its U.S. spending was outpacing its initial 2018 announcement. In its initial announcement, the company said it would spend $10 billion on data centers in North Carolina, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona and Iowa. Apple operates data centers in all those states today.\nApple on Wednesday said it was expanding data centers in North Carolina, Iowa, Nevada and Oregon.\nWATCH: Apple's bigger issue continues to be its missing AI, says Wedbush's Dan Ives"

      "text": "SoftBank Group on Thursday reported fiscal first-quarter profit that topped expectations, driven by gains in its Vision Fund tech investment arm.\nThe Japanese giant reported 421.8 billion yen ($2.87 billion) in the quarter ended June, versus 127.6 billion yen expected, according to LSEG consensus estimates. It is the second straight quarter of profit for SoftBank. The company reported a 174.28 billion yen loss in the same period last year.\nIn the fiscal first quarter, SoftBank said the value of its Vision Funds rose $4.8 billion. It is the biggest gain in value for the Vision Fund since the June quarter of 2021.\nProfit for the Vision Funds segment, which takes into account other factors like expenses, hit 451.4 billion yen in the quarter, versus a loss in the same period last year.\nSoftBank Group shares hit a record high on Thursday, ahead of earnings. The stock is up more than 36% this year, while the company has added nearly $37 billion to its market capitalization.\nOpenAI bet\nSoftBank has been on spending spree related to AI. The Japanese giant is leading a $40 billion funding round into ChatGPT developer OpenAI and it is currently waiting for its $6.5 proposed acquisition of AI chip firm Ampere Computing to close.\nFor OpenAI, SoftBank said that an initial $10 billion has been made by SoftBank and other investors. The remaining $30 billion funding will take place by December.\nOpenAI is in talks with investors about a potential stock sale, with shares to be sold by current and former employees, CNBC reported on Wednesday. SoftBank will not buy any of those shares, a person familiar with the matter, told CNBC on Thursday.\nIPO pipeline\nThe Vision Fund performance will be welcomed by investors hoping to see those big AI bets start to pay off.\nSoftBank said that the rise of the value of the Vision Fund was helped by gains at public companies such as ride-hailing firm Grab, as well as Indian food delivery firm Swiggy. The performance was also aided by private investments in some of firms in India in which the fund has a position.\nSoftBank expects companies in its portfolio \u2014 including PayPay, fintech giant Klarna and Indian eyewear retailer Lenskart \u2014 to go public this year, the person familiar with the matter said. Travel app Klook could file for an IPO in the U.S. in the coming weeks, the person said.\nMeanwhile, SoftBank is a key company in the massive $500 billion Stargate project in the U.S. that aims to build data centers and AI infrastructure in the country. Investors are waiting for details on how SoftBank plans to fund this spending.\nIn May, SoftBank posted its first annual profit in four years for the fiscal year ended March, helped by gains in SoftBank's older investments in Alibaba, T-Mobile and Deutsche Telekom.\nIn the June quarter, SoftBank reported a 256.55 billion yen investment loss for its other holdings, which weighed on the group's overall profit. The Japanese firm said it posted an investment loss on the sale of shares of T-Mobile and Alibaba, which was partially offset by a gain on shares of semiconductor giant Nvidia.\nSoftBank said on Thursday that it sold 13 million shares of T-Mobile in August for $3 billion.\nMeanwhile Arm, the chip designer that is majority-owned by SoftBank, contributed a 8.66 billion yen loss to the Japanese company. SoftBank attributed this to increase research and development expenses, which led to investments growing faster than revenues."

      "text": "Firefly Aerospace has lifted the share price range for its upcoming initial public offering in a move that would value the space technology company at more than $6 billion.\nThe lunar lander and rocket maker said in a filing Monday that it expects to price shares in its upcoming IPO between $41 and $43 apiece.\nFirefly's new target range would raise nearly $697 million at the top end of the range. That's up from the previously expected $35 to $39 price per share that Firefly announced in a filing last week, which targeted a $5.5 billion valuation.\nFirefly announced plans to go public last month as interest in space technology gains steam, and billionaire-led companies such as Elon Musk's SpaceX rake in more funding.\nThe industry has also begun testing the public markets after a long hiatus in IPO deal activity, with space tech firm Voyager debuting in June.\nFirefly makes rockets, space tugs and lunar landers, and is widely known for its satellite launching rockets known as Alpha.\nThe company has partnered with major defense players such as Lockheed Martin, L3Harris and NASA, and received a $50 million investment from defense contractor Northrop Grumman.\nFirefly's revenues jumped from $8.3 million a year ago to $55.9 million at the end of March, the company said. Its net loss grew to $60.1 million, from $52.8 million a year ago."

      "text": "After months of speculation, U.S. President Donald Trump has divulged more of his semiconductor tariff plans, but his latest threats might raise more questions than answers.\nOn Wednesday, Trump said he will impose a 100% tariff on imports of semiconductors and chips, but not for companies that are \"building in the United States.\"\nAs semiconductors represent an over $600 billion industry at the heart of the modern digital economy, any potential tariffs hold massive weight.\nHowever, experts say the President has yet to provide key details on the policy, which will ultimately determine their full impact and targets.\n\"It's still too early to pin down the impact of the tariffs on the semiconductor sector,\" Ray Wang, research director of semiconductors, supply chain and emerging technology at The Futurum Group, told CNBC.\n\"The final rule is likely still being drafted and the technical details are far from clear at this point.\"\nBig players win?\nOne of the biggest questions for chip players and investors will be how much manufacturing a company needs to commit to the U.S. to qualify for the tariff exemption.\nThe U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain for many years now. Since 2020, the world's largest semiconductor companies such as TSMC and Samsung Electronics have committed hundreds of billions of dollars to building plants in the U.S.\nSpeaking to CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia\" on Thursday, James Sullivan, managing director and head of Asia Pacific Equity Research at J.P. Morgan, said this could mean most major chip manufacturers receiving exemptions.\nIf this is the case, the policy could have the effect of \"continuing to consolidate market share amongst the largest cap players in the space,\" Sullivan said.\nIndeed, shares of major Asian chip companies like TSMC, which has significant investments in the U.S., rose in Thursday morning trading following Trump's announcement. Early this year, TSMC announced it would expand its investments in the U.S. to $165 billion.\nShares of South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix \u2014 which have both committed investments in the U.S. \u2014 were also trading up after a Korean trade envoy reportedly said that the duo would be exempt from the 100% tariffs.\nAn exemption on what?\nBeyond the question of exemptions, many other aspects of the potential tariffs remain unclear.\nSpeaking on CNBC's \"Squawk Box Asia,\" on Thursday, Stacy Rasgon, senior U.S. semiconductor analyst at Bernstein, noted that most of the semiconductors that enter the U.S. come inside consumer goods such as smartphones, PCs and cars.\nFor example, in 2024, the U.S. imported $46.3 billion of semiconductors \u2014 only about 1% of all U.S. imports, according to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.\nWhile Rasgon said tariffs on these imports may be manageable, broader tariffs would be harder to deal with.\n\"What we don't know with [Trump's] comments on tariffs, is it just raw semiconductors? Are there going to be tariffs on end devices? Are you going to be looking at tariffs on components within end devices?,\" Rasgon asked.\nThe confusion and questions around chip tariffs were brought to the forefront after the U.S. Department of Commerce started a national security investigation of semiconductor technology imports in April, just as the sector was exempted from Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs.\nThe vague language from the Trump administration \u2014 though not invoked in the President's latest proclamations \u2014 could theoretically be used to apply broad levies to an enormous segment of the electronics supply chain. It's also unclear to what extent semiconductor materials and equipment used to manufacture chips would fall under the tariffs.\nComplex supply chains\nPotential tariff strategies could also be complicated by the intricate and interdependent nature of the semiconductor supply chain.\nRasgon gave the example of American chip designer Qualcomm, which sends its designs to TSMC to be manufactured in Taiwan and then imported to the U.S.\n\"Does that mean those [chip imports] would not be tariffed, because they're made at TSMC, and TSMC is building in the U.S.?... I don't know. Hopefully that's how it would be,\" he said.\nAnother large buyer of semiconductors in the U.S. are cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services and Google, which are essential to power Washington's AI plans.\nAccording to a recent report from ITIF, semiconductors contribute $7 trillion in global economic activity annually by underpinning a range of downstream applications, including AI and \"big data.\"\nIn a potential sign of American companies seeking to move their chip supply chains into the U.S., Apple CEO Tim Cook, alongside Trump at the White House Wednesday, announced that it will be supplied with chips from Samsung's production plant in Texas.\nThe company also announced an additional $100 billion in U.S. investments, raising its total investment commitments in the country to $600 billion over the next four years."
