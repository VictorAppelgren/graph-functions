Single dental implants are one such way this clinic ensures that patients enjoy a healthy, complete, smile.\n\nSingle dental implants feature a screw-in post made from biocompatible titanium that serves as an artificial root. The post is placed where the former tooth was located, and over the span of just a few months, the post actually fuses with the underlying bone to provide an anchor. Once the fusion is complete, abutment posts are placed to allow the dental prosthetic to be fitted permanently.\n\nSingle dental implants with Brush Dental can be a great fit for someone who is seeking a beautiful smile, restoration of bite function, a boost in oral health, the prevention of bone loss, support for adjacent teeth, a self-confidence boost, and a solution that\u2019s easy to take care of. Upon consultation, the team at Brush Dental helps patients navigate through their unique needs to determine if they are a candidate for a single dental implant.
