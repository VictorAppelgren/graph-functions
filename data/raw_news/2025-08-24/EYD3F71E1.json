  "content": "Plastic bag sales have increased for the first time in a decade thanks to a boom in online shopping.\n\nLast year some 437 million single-use plastic carrier bags were bought in England, 7 per cent more than the 407 million bought in 2023, according to data from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).\n\nIt is the first time sales of plastic bags have increased since a 5p charge was imposed on them by retailers in 2015.\n\nWrap, a waste charity, explained that the growth of internet sales (which represents around 27 per cent of all retail sales) has led to this staggering increase in plastic bag use.\n\nExpert and Wrap consultant, Thomas Baker, explained: \u2018The growth of internet sales and methods used to pack items for online deliveries has contributed to the increase in single-use plastic carrier bags\u2019.\n\nSerial offender Ocado - the grocery delivery company for Marks & Spencer Customers - sold 221 million plastic bags last year representing more than 51 per cent of all single-use plastic bags sold in the UK.\n\nThis is 30 million more than they sold in 2023 - a rise they put down to an increase in customers.\n\nAn Ocado spokesman told The Times: \u2018Our approach to deliveries is designed to minimise emissions and waste, while keeping customer orders efficient and products in excellent condition from warehouse to doorstep.\u2019\n\nAfter Ocado, the Co-op, Morrisons and Sainsbury\u2019s sold the most plastic bags with 94 million, 58 million and 11 million sales for the popular supermarkets, respectively.\n\nAll four companies experienced a broader increase in sales.\n\nBy comparison, Tesco, Waitrose and Iceland all halted the sale of single-use bags in 2021.\n\nAlthough the introduction of the 5p charge in 2015 led to a sharp fall in sales, from a peak of more than 7.6 billion, there are concerns that the recent data indicates the country is taking a backward step.\n\nThe Marine Conservation Society, which conducts annual litter surveys in Britain, said that the number of plastic bags found washed up on Britain\u2019s beaches had increased by 1.8 per cent last year compared with the previous year.\n\nConsequently, Several supermarkets are now pledging to cut back on plastic.\n\nSainsbury\u2019s said it has replaced all single-use plastic bags with bags versions and expects single-use plastic bag sales to \u2018reduce significantly\u2019 next year.\n\nMeanwhile, Morrisons and Ocado say customers can return used bags to drivers for recycling, and the Co-op insists its bags are now 100 per cent compostable.\n\nIn March, the Government announced plans to tackle Britain\u2019s \u2018throwaway society\u2019.\n\nIn tandem, earlier this year Environment Secretary Steve Reed launched a \u2018circular economy taskforce\u2019 responsible for developing a roadmap to reduce waste.\n\nA DEFRA spokesperson added: \u2018[the government is] committed to cutting our reliance on plastics [but] more work is needed to clean up our streets\u2019.",

  "summary": "Plastic bag sales have increased for the first time in a decade due to a boom in online shopping, according to data from the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). Last year, 437 million single-use plastic carrier bags were purchased in England, a 7% increase from the 407 million in 2023. This is the first increase in sales since a 5p charge was imposed on them by retailers in 2015. The rise was attributed to the growth of internet sales, which represents around 27% of all retail sales. Ocado, the grocery delivery company for Marks & Spencer Customers, sold 221 million plastic bags last year, representing over 51% of the total total sold in the UK. The number of plastic bags found washed up on Britain\u2019s beaches increased by 1.8% last year compared to the previous year.",
