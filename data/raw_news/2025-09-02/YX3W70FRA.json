  "title": "The 5 Best Movies to Stream on Prime Video This Week (September 1 - 7)",
  "description": "There's a lot to watch on Prime, and you only have so much time, so here's what's worth watching.",
  "content": "Prime Video is a surprisingly great place to find new movies to watch each week. Of course, that can be intimidating. How are you supposed to sift through all these films and find the ones most worth watching? Sure, you could trust the algorithm, but where\u2019s the fun in that?\n\nThat\u2019s what I bring to the table: the human factor. I\u2019m here to recommend a few prime (pun intended) movies. Want to take your night to the next level and maybe find a new favorite along the way? Grab your popcorn and keep reading to discover what to watch next!\n\nNo 80s franchise has survived to the present day like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Every few years, we get a new show starring everyone\u2019s favorite kung fu reptiles. And with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, these totally tubular teens make their triumphant return to the big screen. It\u2019s not live-action like most of this franchise\u2019s movies, though. Instead, it\u2019s a CGI film lovingly animated in the style of Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.\n\nThe animation is almost hypnotically beautiful, which helps bring to life a fresh story about these ninja bros fighting a new threat, the buzzworthy bad guy, Superfly. He\u2019s voiced by Ice Cool, and the rest of the cast includes big names like John Cena, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogen, and Giancarlo Esposito. But the real magic of this film is the easy chemistry between the quartet of turtles played by Micah Abbey, Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon, and Shamon Brown Jr. Their banter-filled dialogue feels like that of actual brothers, and the loving sibling rivalry at the heart of this adventure makes it a good time.\n\nRoboCop was intended as social satire, with director Paul Verhoeven trying to comment on everything from 80s consumerism to the evil intersection between law enforcement and amoral corporations. Along the way, though, he created arguably the perfect action movie, one centered around a murdered cop (played by Peter Weller) who is brought back to life as a nearly unstoppable cyborg cop. Bullets may not be a problem, but he faces larger threats from a violent gang led by That \u201870s Show alumnus Kurtwood Smith and a corrupt CEO played by Beverly Hills Cop veteran Ronnie Cox.\n\nThe result is a popcorn movie with serious staying power. It\u2019s easy to enjoy RoboCop on the surface for its sweet action scenes and crazy dialogue, but the movie\u2019s messages about complex topics like corporate greed and police brutality will leave you with plenty to ponder after the credits roll. The fact that those messages are so often overlooked by general audiences is a testament to the satire of Verhoeven: he held up such a perfect mirror to American society that most watching never saw anything wrong with their reflection!\n\nWhenever I talk to fellow horror buffs, I\u2019m always surprised more of them haven\u2019t heard of Cooties. The premise of the movie is one that many parents would agree with: that young children can be scary little monsters. In this movie, that is quite literal, as we follow the adventures of hapless elementary school teachers who must defend themselves when their students turn into mindless, flesh-eating zombies. Mercifully, the plot never takes itself too seriously, and this comedy racks up even more laughs than its cannibalistic kiddos rack up bodies.\n\nIf the story of this zombie comedy doesn\u2019t pique your interest, the stacked cast probably will. The movie stars Lord of the Rings lead Elijah Wood, The Office scene-stealer Rainn Wilson, Scott Pilgrim rocker Alison Pill, and everybody\u2019s favorite 30 Rock pageboy, Jack McBrayer. Each of these actors is a capable comedian in their own right, and as an ensemble, they are almost as unstoppable as their zombie foes.\n\nTrust me: for teachers, parents, or anyone else that has ever wondered why little children can be so monstrous, Cooties is a real must-watch.\n\nAs a child of the 80s, there are few franchises I like better than Transformers. Unfortunately, no movie has ever managed to top the 1986 animated film, which was especially noticeable after the live-action Michael Bay movies started delivering diminishing returns (seriously, Revenge of the Fallen was terrible). That all changed last year, because although it was a box office bomb, Transformers One is indisputably the best film in this entire robot franchise.\n\nTransformers One is a prequel that focuses on the friendship between Optimus Prime and Megatron before their epic falling out. It also charts the early days of Cybertronian history, including the formation of the Decepticons and the heroic Autobots who oppose them. As such, the film is very accessible to general audiences who have never personally transformed a toy robot into a truck or plane. But the film also has plenty of killer references and Easter eggs for veteran Transformers fans, including those of us who have been there from the beginning.\n\nThrow in an all-star cast of voice actors that includes Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Steve Buscemi, and Jon Hamm, and you have a movie worth watching, especially with fellow fans. Just call up your nerdiest friends and give them the classic command: \u201cAutobots, transform and roll out!\u201d\n\nWatching a new vampire movie always feels like a roll of the dice. Sometimes, you get a movie that\u2019s memorably weird (like The Lost Boys) or at least tragically beautiful (like Robert Eggers\u2019 Nosferatu). Other times, you get something that\u2019s not worth a pile of vamp dust (looking at you, Dracula 2000). If you\u2019re a fan of this fiendish genre, here\u2019s some good news: you can now stream Abigail on Prime Video, and it\u2019s one vampire movie that doesn\u2019t suck.\n\nThe premise of Abigail is that a ragtag group of mercenaries (including Scream queen Melissa Barrera and Lisa Frankenstein lead Kathyrn Newton) are hired to protect a rich kid\u2019s daughter (Matilda the Musical lead Alisha Weir). The twist? She\u2019s actually a vampire, and a group of unwitting criminals are suddenly stuck in a game of kill or be killed. Abigail is alike catnip for horror fans, and the movie takes after Dracula himself, bringing the tired vampire genre back to life, one drop of blood at a time.\n\nPrime has plenty of movies and many might not be your cup of tea, but all of my picks are gems that are just waiting for their next biggest fan. That could be you, so don't let your streams be dreams. Pick up that remote and see where it takes you!",
