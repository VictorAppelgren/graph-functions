      "summary": "Europe is accelerating a digital sovereignty agenda, driven by concerns over U.S. tech dominance and the CLOUD Act’s data‑access implications. France, Germany, and Denmark are phasing out Microsoft, AWS, and Google services in favor of domestic providers like OVHcloud, and the EU is pursuing SecNumCloud certification and sovereign cloud funding. The move aims to reduce vendor lock‑in, enhance data privacy, and strengthen geopolitical resilience, while also positioning European cloud firms to compete with U.S. hyperscalers amid rising trade tensions.",
