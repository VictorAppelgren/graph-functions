  "title": "What's next for Jen Pawol after her historic debut as an MLB umpire?",
  "description": "Jen Pawol's historic work as an MLB umpire is in the history books. What might be next now that she's returned to the Class AAA ranks?",
  "content": "\u2022 Jen Pawol, the first female umpire in MLB, has returned to Class AAA after her historic debut.\n\u2022 Sixteen Class AAA umpires, including Pawol, have filled in for MLB games this season due to illness, injury, or scheduled time off.\n\u2022 Fill-in umpires have performed well this season, with a median accuracy rate comparable to full-time MLB umpires.\n\nJen Pawol's historic work behind the plate of a Major League Baseball game is in the history books. So what might be next for the 48-year-old umpire now that she's returned to the Class AAA ranks?\n\nA return engagement in the majors is certainly not out of the question. Including Pawol, 16 Class AAA umpires have called balls and strikes in the major leagues this season, with veteran John Bacon working 23 games behind the plate.\n\nFor now, Pawol is back in the minors. Yet where might she work next, and make a return to the highest level?\n\nHere's a partial breakdown of the fill-in umpire procedures, gleaned from league and umpiring sources:\n\nWhere will Jen Pawol next work a game?\n\nUnlike their MLB counterparts, Class AAA umpires aren't entirely assigned to four-man crews. Instead, 15 three-ump crews are assigned to Class AAA, working both the Pacific Coast and International leagues. There's an additional group of \"rover\" umpires who are assigned to AAA crews and made available for fill-in work on MLB games.\n\nWhy are minor-league umps forced to fill in on MLB games?\n\nIt's not unlike any other job. Umpires get sick or get injured \u2013 think foul balls off the mask or body, sometimes leading to concussion-related absences. MLB umps are also granted time off during the season.\n\nIn Pawol's case, it was a five-game series between Atlanta and Miami that included a makeup of a postponed game. By rule, an umpire must rotate off the crew during that series. (Keep an eye on the upcoming five-game Cubs-Brewers series, which will require similar help from the minors).\n\nWhat determines which fill-in umpire gets called up to MLB?\n\nIt's not unlike the factors that determine which umpires earn full-time promotions or playoff assignments once they're in the MLB fold. League evaluations are a significant part of that equation, along with merit. Experience can certainly factor into that.\n\nAnd then there's the logistical element of getting a certain umpire from Point A to Point B (along with a replacement for the replacement). In Pawol's case, the league had a few weeks to work out logistics because it knew an extra ump would be needed for the Atlanta-Miami series. Time off is a similarly predictive scenario.\n\nIn cases of injury, proximity and availability are key factors in who gets the call.\n\nHow have fill-in umpires performed in MLB?\n\nThis season, quite well. According to Umpire Scorecards, the top ball-strike caller in the majors this season is Edwin Jimenez, whose 96.48% accuracy in 19 games behind the plate leads all umpires. Jimenez is a fill-in umpire, and also the brother of full-time ump Emil Jimenez. While internal MLB umpire evaluations are tightly held, it would not be surprising to see Edwin Jimenez elevated to full-time status in coming seasons.\n\nAnd the collective 17 fill-in umps have acquitted themselves well; their median accuracy for the year is 94.49% across 189 games, almost identical to the 94.22% for all umpires. Pawol's rating of 92.72% (based on 140 of 151 correctly called pitches) is very respectable for a first-time outing, and a small enough sample that two more pitches graded as correct would put her in the 94% group.",

      "text": "Phenom Jacob Misiorowski injury is speed bump, but Brewers may make it a boon\nWASHINGTON \u2013 There\u2019s very little, it seems, that can harsh the Milwaukee Brewers\u2019 vibe these days.\nFrom offseason talent-shedding to an in-season cycle of constant roster churn to robust competition in the National League, it\u2019s almost impossible to puncture both the power of friendship and the league-leading prosperity the Brew Crew enjoys.\nHeck, at this point, even an injury to a prized young pitcher that would otherwise portend storm clouds can be viewed positively.\nOh, we won\u2019t know for sure until Aug. 15, when Jacob Misiorowski, the right-handed comet best known for earning an All-Star Game nod just five games into his career, is scheduled to come off the injured list.\nThe Miz, as he\u2019s known from Menomonie to Muskego and points beyond, has a tibia contusion on his left shin, the result of a very real line drive that came off the bat of the Chicago Cubs\u2019 Seiya Suzuki at 102.9 mph, coincidentally about as hard as Misiorowski\u2019s nastiest fastball comes out of his hand.\nMisiorowski received X-rays after that and additional imaging this weekend at Nationals Park before the Brewers scratched him roughly three hours before his Sunday, Aug. 3 scheduled start.\nThe Miz is fully ambulatory, has been throwing and will continue to throw, probably could\u2019ve one hundred or so times Sunday but instead, gave way to rookie Logan Henderson against the Washington Nationals.\n\u201cThey had an idea for me,\u201d Misiorowski said Sunday morning, \u201cand it\u2019s basically, this is what it\u2019s going to be. Obviously, I tried to fight it a little bit, trying to throw, but I understand and they\u2019re looking out for me.\u201d\nIt sounded like a rather tepid \"fight,\" and it also sounds like a very good \u201cidea.\u201d\nSee, Henderson had few problems suppressing the moribund Nationals, pitching into the fifth inning in a 14-3 victory that capped a three-game sweep. Aggregate score: 38-14. While The Miz is hardly a luxury item, if you can avoid bringing Gucci luggage on a camping trip, why not?\nAfter all, when the Brewers placed Misiorowski on the IL, seven of their next 10 games would come against the last-place Nationals, the 46-63 Atlanta Braves and the last-place Pittsburgh Pirates.\nWhen he returns, Misiorowski\u2019s first two starts would be against the wild-card contender Cincinnati Reds and those second-place, 64-46 Cubs, part of a five-game series at Wrigley Field that marks the last meeting between the teams this season.\nAnd Misiorowski\u2019s 96 \u2154 innings pitched this season almost exactly matches his professional high of 97 \u2153 innings, reached last year.\nSounds like a perfect time to pump the brakes on the kid a little bit. For competitive and, you know, other reasons.\n\u201cHe\u2019s had a lot coming at him,\u201d says Brewers manager Pat Murphy. \u201cHe came to the big leagues, the great start, the All-Star Game, line drive off the leg, hyperextended knee.\n\u201cThat\u2019s all part of your first five, six games.\u201d\nNow the 23-year-old has seven whole big league starts under his belt, during which he\u2019s struck out 47 batters in 33 \u2153 innings, riding a fastball whose 99.3 mph velocity is tied for eighth in the majors \u2013 including relievers.\nWhile Misiorowski insists there is no hard ceiling on his innings count, there is a concept of how many bullets \u2013 especially of the 100-mph variety \u2013 a guy has in a season. The Brewers, now 67-44, are in an absolute dogfight in the Central and, more broadly, in an NL with a half-dozen teams playing at least .550 ball.\nMuch bigger fights almost certainly remain for a club with a 97.3% chance of making the playoffs, per FanGraphs.\n\u201cThe kid is special,\u201d Brewers veteran right-hander Brandon Woodruff tells USA TODAY Sports. \u201cWe\u2019ve kind of seen here early on what he can do. He\u2019s just scratching the surface for what he can become.\n\u201cTake care of this, have him fully ready to go for the stretch and the end of the year \u2013 probably be a good thing.\u201d\nEspecially when there\u2019s plenty of infrastructure to support it.\nGot to get over the hump\nMurphy is well-versed at roster juggling \u2013 the Brewers used 36 pitchers last season and have already called upon 28 this season. Henderson has shown well in his five starts \u2013 he now has a 1.78 ERA and 0.99 WHIP after getting into the fifth Sunday \u2013 yet is simply another next-man-up in the Brewers\u2019 world.\nIt\u2019s all by design, the pieces well-prepared.\n\u201cEveryone in our (spring training) room last year pitched for us,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cI let them know, if you have options, you\u2019re going to be up and down. Because we need that flexibility. Anybody with options, you might be optioned.\n\u201cAnd probably will be.\u201d\nSaturday night, Henderson heard his name called in this version of Brewers bingo, scratched from his start with Class AAA Nashville at Scranton-Wilkes Barre, told to scramble to Washington to fill in for Misiorowski.\nAfter an evening drive south with his family at the wheel, he shut down the Nationals and now, the Brewers are 5-0 in his starts.\nA lot of Logan Hendersons add up to 67-44.\n\"I did not expect it,\" says Henderson of his emergency assignment, \"but I was ready for it. We\u2019re all in Nashville watching the boys win up here and it\u2019s been really fun and we all want to contribute.\n\"I think that\u2019s the toughest battle, to be quite honest, trying to feel a part of the team up here when you\u2019re down there. It fuels you more. It makes you want to get back up here and be ready for any opportunity.\"\nIt\u2019s all part of the Brewers\u2019 grand maneuvering, a place where a given winter might see them shed an All-Star piece like closer Devin Williams, or where the biggest trade deadline addition (upright division) might be reserve catcher Danny Jansen.\nThe deadline is past them and the maneuvering can begin, but Murphy realizes the Milwaukee mojo is a delicate brew.\n\u201cIt works both ways. You get so myopic about all that and forget that these are still people,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cIt\u2019s got to be fun. If all of a sudden, these guys start taking on expectations that are different from the normal expectations of playing in the big leagues and playing as a team, if they start letting their energy and focus go toward something different, then it can screw everything up.\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to keep their focus and their energies just on how we do it. And let it all play out.\u201d\nSince 2018, that more likely means a taste of the postseason but not much more. The Brewers lost Game 7 of the 2018 NLCS to the Dodgers, then bowed out as a wild card the next two seasons. They won the Central in 2021, \u201923 and \u201924 but lost in the first round each time, the past two seasons in the wild card round as they failed to secure a first-round bye.\nIf nothing else, they\u2019re a worthy steppingstone. The Brewers lost to the eventual World Series champion in 2019, 2020 and \u201921, while Arizona won the NL pennant after dispatching them in \u201923 and the New York Mets made a startling NLCS run last season.\nNot that there\u2019s any satisfaction in that.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had a good run here the last eight years. In \u201918, one game away from getting to the World Series,\u201d mused Woodruff, who has pitched excellently \u2013 a 2.01 ERA in four starts \u2013 in his return from shoulder surgery that cost him all of 2024. \u201cEver since then, it\u2019s been a battle. We\u2019ve made the playoffs, but it\u2019s like we can\u2019t get over that hump.\n\u201cYou keep knocking on the door, knocking on the door and hopefully one of these years, you get over the hump. Hopefully this year is the year.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a question the next three months will answer. They\u2019ll bid the Cubs farewell in three weeks, left to battle apart the remainder of the year.\nBeyond that, many of the Brewers\u2019 old tormentors will lurk in the postseason bracket. Carrying a bye beyond the wild card round would give Milwaukee an advantage it\u2019s never enjoyed.\n\u201cThere\u2019s some really good teams out there, with a lot more experience. Teams with a lot more physical talent,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cBut we\u2019re pretty good as a team.\n\u201cWe have to stick with that, and really understand that. If we think we\u2019re not going to go through bumps, we\u2019re crazy. There\u2019s going to be bumps.\u201d\nYet in the case of Misiorowski, the Brewers hope to turn a bump into a boon.\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news \u2014 fast.

      "text": "Jen Pawol makes history as MLB's first female umpire. Here's what to know.\nEditor's note: This story has been updated with new information\nJen Pawol continues to make history as a female baseball umpire.\nAnnounced on Wednesday by Major League Baseball, Pawol is getting called up to be part of the five-team umpire crew for this weekend's Atlanta Braves-Miami Marlins series, which features a doubleheader on Saturday, making her the first female umpire to work a regular-season MLB game.\nPawol is scheduled to be behind the plate for the Braves and Marlins series finale on Sunday, Aug. 10 at Truist Park in Atlanta. She will be working each of the final three games of the series with the crew, which needed a fifth member for the weekend due to the doubleheader.\nThe call-up by Major League Baseball comes well after other professional sports leagues broke down the gender barrier with female officials and referees of their own. The first full-time female official to work a professional sports game was Violet Palmer in 1997, who worked the Dallas Mavericks vs. then-Vancouver Grizzlies game to become the NBA's first woman referee.\nSarah Thomas then became the NFL's first woman on-field official in 2015 when she served as a line judge for the Kansas City Chiefs' road game at the Houston Astros. Thomas furthered her history in the NFL six years later in 2021 when she became the first female to officiate a Super Bowl.\nNoted by MLB.com, Pawol began her baseball umpire career in 2016 in Rookie ball and climbed all the way up the minor league ranks to Triple-A in 2023, where she was the first woman to umpire at the minor league's highest level in 34 years. That same season, Pawol made history by becoming the first woman to umpire a Triple-A championship game.\nHere's what to know about Pawol:\nWho is Jen Pawol?\nPawol, who is 47 years old, comes from a softball background as she played softball at Hofstra University and was a three-time Colonial Athletic Association All-Conference team selection as the Pride's catcher. She was a member of the U.S. Women's softball team's world championship team in 2001.\nThe New Jersey native first became an umpire in 2010 when she worked college softball games, and then shifted to baseball in 2016 when she was hired for a job in the Gulf Coast League following the completion of the Umpire Training Academy.\nShe does have some MLB experience on her resume, as she worked a Houston Astros vs. Washington Nationals spring training game in 2024. Starting at third base for that game, Pawol became the first female umpire to work a spring training game since Ria Cortesio did so back in 2007.\n\"I greatly appreciate everyone\u2019s enthusiasm, everyone\u2019s welcoming attitude on the field tonight was very, very special,\" Pawol said in 2024 after umpiring her first MLB spring training game. \"Both managers shared congratulations and were welcoming, along with my (umpiring) partners, the players. I knew a lot of the players on the field already and so many said 'Congrats, great to see you up here.'\"\nNoted by MLB.com, Pawol is one of 17 current Triple-A umpires who are eligible to serve as a substitute in Major League games, should one of MLB's umpires go on vacation or something like that.\nWhen is Jen Pawol making her MLB umpire debut?\nPawol is set to make her MLB umpiring debut on Saturday in Game 1 of the Braves-Marlins doubleheader. She is set to then work the plate for the first time in the majors on Sunday for the series finale.\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news \u2014 fast.

      "text": "Jen Pawol made her MLB umpire debut amid unprecedented scrutiny \u2014 and held up just fine\n- Jen Pawol became the first woman to umpire an MLB game and call balls and strikes behind home plate.\n- Pawol's ball and strike accuracy was 93%, comparable to many full-time MLB umpires.\nYes, Jen Pawol made history by becoming the first woman to umpire a Major League Baseball game and, on Sunday, Aug. 10, she was the first to call balls and strikes behind home plate.\nIn any era, that would be significant. Yet in this modern landscape of Statcast strike zones and umpire ratings, and the scrutiny of thousands of social media naysayers, every pitch Pawol called would be parsed and graded in a manner that simply didn\u2019t exist a decade or two ago.\nAnd just how did Pawol do in arbitrating the Atlanta Braves-Miami Marlins clash Sunday in Atlanta?\nPretty darn well.\nPawol called 93% of balls and strikes correctly, according to Umpire Scorecards, which places her in the bottom third of umpire performance this season, but very much in line with her peers.\nPawol, 48, brought more than 1,200 games of minor league experience to her fill-in assignment, necessitated because the Marlins and Braves played a weekend doubleheader, disrupting the usual umpire rotation.\nShe called 140 of 151 balls and strikes correctly, according to Umpire Scorecards, which simulates every pitch 500 times and, using a dizzying array of factors, aims to create what it calls \"interpretability, validity, practicality, and fairness.\"\nPawol\u2019s 92.72% hit rate puts her nose-to-nose with a bevy of full-time MLB umpires, including veterans Laz Diaz (92.64%) and CB Bucknor (92.85), who tend to draw the ire of fans, along with the more anonymous Bruce Dreckman (92.76) and Carlos Torres (93.13%).\nThe median percentage for all umpires this season is 94%, or, Pawol\u2019s percentage had two more calls been determined correct. Edwin Jimenez, also a Class AAA fill-in umpire in his third year calling balls and strikes in the majors, leads all umpires with 96.48% accuracy in 19 plate assignments.\nIn fact, the 16 Triple-A fill-ins have acquitted themselves quite well, producing a 94.46 median in 10 games. Pawol? She\u2019s umped one game, a sample size statistically insignificant as far as assessing her performance.\nYet in the most important metric \u2013 did the home plate umpire impact the game? \u2013 Pawol did just fine, \"favoring\" the Marlins by 0.28 runs, per Umpire Scorecards. The Braves won the game 7-1.\nYou might say, then, that Pawol earned the greatest compliment an ump could receive: Other than her trailblazing distinction, you\u2019d have hardly noticed her.\n\"We certainly didn't call her up from A-ball, right?\" said Marlins starter Cal Quantrill, per MLB.com. \"I'm sure she was well-prepared, and I think part of the game moving forward is if this is normal, then we're gonna treat it normal, too. I thought it was fine, and I think she did a quality job.\n\"She should be very proud of herself, and it's kind of a cool little thing to be a part of it. But yeah, just another day.\"\nOne that figures to be repeated."
