  "description": "Middleweight champ faces a tricky title defense against the unbeaten Russian.",
  "content": "After a week that has seen the premier MMA promotion company ink a new multi-billion dollar TV deal, as well as firm up plans for an event at the White House, it's back to business in the Octagon this weekend, with UFC 319 offering up an intriguing middleweight title fight in Chicago.\n\nSaturday's main event sees South Africa's Dricus du Plessis aiming for a third successful title defense in a row as he takes on unbeaten Russian challenger Khamzat Chimaev.\n\nDu Plessis claimed the title with a win over Sean Strickland at the start of last year and comes into this fight off the back of an unanimous decision victory in a rematch with Strickland at UFC 312 in February.\n\nChimaev hasn't fought since his win over former champ Robert Whittaker at UFC 308 last October, in a devastating performance that saw him dislocate the New Zealander's jaw in a first-round submission.\n\nCatch all the action live by following our guide to watching UFC 319.\n\nUFC 319 takes place at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, on Saturday Aug. 16. The main card gets going at 9 p.m. CDT local time (10 p.m. ET, 7 p.m. PT). Here are all the details for multiple time zones.\n\nIt's hard to say exactly when the main event will take place but if you're looking to only watch the fight between du Plessis and Chimaev, ring walks will start no earlier than midnight ET (9 p.m. PT).\n\nHow to watch UFC 319 in the US\n\n\n\nWhile live UFC coverage in the US is set to change hands next year, for the time being ESPN Plus remains its home and the place to head to if you want to watch UFC 319, with Saturday's card being offered as a pay-per-view event. The cost structure is a bit confusing, but here are the options to watch UFC on ESPN, according to ESPN's site:\n\u2022 Existing annual ESPN Plus subscribers can order the upcoming UFC card for $80.\n\u2022 New ESPN Plus subscribers can buy a bundle of the UFC 319 PPV event (streaming in HD) and an ESPN Plus annual recurring subscription for $135. This is a decent deal. The ESPN Plus annual subscription will auto-renew after one year, at the price of an ESPN Plus annual subscription at the time of auto-renewal.\n\nYou can do all of the above at the link below.\n\nHow to watch UFC 319 in the UK\n\nMMA fans in the UK can watch all the action from Chicago via TNT Sports and the good news is that unlike some UFC events on the network this event won't be PPV. Coverage gets underway on TNT Sports 1 with the prelims at 1 a.m. BST in the early hours of Sunday morning.\n\nHow to watch UFC 319 in Australia\n\nYou can watch UFC 319 through Main Event on Foxtel. That means you can also watch online via sports streaming service Kayo for AU$60.\n\nHow to watch UFC 319 in Canada\n\nUFC 319's main card is available to watch through a variety of PPV providers, including cable operators such as Bell, Rogers and Shaw, as well as streaming services such as DAZN, Sportsnet Plus and UFC Fight Pass. Whichever option you choose, it's a PPV fee of CA$70 across the board.\n\nIt's also worth noting that early prelims will be available to stream via UFC Fight Pass, while the event's Prelims will be shown on Sportsnet and TVA Sports.",

      "text": "Fight fans might have to rethink their entertainment plans. Paramount has struck a blockbuster deal to become the exclusive US broadcaster of UFC fights, agreeing to pay $7.7 billion over seven years starting in 2026. The deal, with UFC parent company TKO Group, will put all UFC events on Paramount-owned platforms, including Paramount Plus and CBS.\nThat means fans who are used to occasionally forking out for a pay-per-view UFC fight will have to consider a Paramount Plus subscription instead. All UFC events will be included in Paramount Plus subscriptions. Select events will be simulcast on CBS.\nRead also: South Park Locks Into Paramount Plus With $1.5 Billion Streaming Deal\nThe move is part of Paramount's push to beef up its live sports offerings as the streaming wars escalate. UFC has grown into one of the most valuable sports properties, attracting a younger, global audience that streaming services are eager to capture.\nFor viewers, the deal means UFC coverage will shift away from its US home on ESPN, changing how fans watch and pay for fights. Paramount merged with David Ellison's Skydance after its purchasing of Paramount Global from Shari Redstone on Aug. 7.\n\"This deal puts UFC amongst the biggest sports in the world,\" UFC CEO and president Dana White posted on X. \"The exposure provided by the Paramount and CBS networks under this new structure is a huge win for our athletes and anyone who watches and loves this sport.\"\nThe deal comes as media companies face mounting pressure to secure live content to keep subscribers from jumping to their rivals. With UFC locked in, Paramount is betting that octagon action will help it land a decisive blow in the fight for streaming dominance."

      "text": "Dana White says UFC will host first-ever White House fight on July 4: \"It is definitely going to happen\"\nThe Ultimate Fighting Championship will stage a historic fight at the White House on July 4, 2026, marking America's 250th birthday with what would be the first professional mixed martial arts event ever held at the presidential residence, UFC CEO Dana White confirmed Tuesday.\n\"It is definitely going to happen,\" White told \"CBS Mornings.\"\nWhite said he spoke with President Donald Trump Monday night about the event and plans to meet with Mr. Trump and Ivanka Trump at the end of this month to finalize details and review venue renderings. A source familiar with the planning confirmed that the White House expected the event to happen.\n\"When he called me and asked me to do it, he said, 'I want Ivanka in the middle of this,'\" White said. \"So Ivanka reached out to me, and her and I started talking about the possibilities, where it would be and, you know, I put together all the renderings.\"\nThe announcement comes as UFC finalizes a groundbreaking seven-year streaming deal with Paramount worth an average of $1.1 billion annually. The agreement represents a significant shift from UFC's traditional pay-per-view model, with select events to be simulcast on CBS.\nWhite called the Paramount deal \"one of the massive, major milestones in my career and in the history of the sport.\"\nWhite said the media world is changing but believes pay-per-view is still strong.\n\"I don't know if there's a better way,\" White said. \"There are so many disruptors in the world right now. Who would have thought taxi cabs would disappear or cable television would start to go away?\"\nWhite said that UFC will continue hosting pay-per-view events, including one scheduled for Saturday in Chicago, while embracing streaming platforms for broader reach.\n\"Live sports, you have to watch live. You have to tune in. It is a destination watch,\" he said. \"Sports are a big deal to these streaming services.\"\nNo fighters have been announced for the White House event, which White said remains nearly a year away. The venue would mark an unprecedented location for a professional mixed martial arts event that regularly fills stadiums and arenas.\nThe Paramount deal places UFC alongside other major sporting events broadcast on CBS, including the Masters Tournament, NCAA Final Four and Super Bowl.\nParamount, a Skydance Corporation, is the parent company of CBS News."

      "text": "Fight fans might have to rethink their entertainment plans. Paramount has struck a blockbuster deal to become the exclusive US broadcaster of UFC fights, agreeing to pay $7.7 billion over seven years starting in 2026. The deal, with UFC parent company TKO Group, will put all UFC events on Paramount-owned platforms, including Paramount Plus and CBS.\nThat means fans who are used to occasionally forking out for a pay-per-view UFC fight will have to consider a Paramount Plus subscription instead. All UFC events will be included in Paramount Plus subscriptions. Select events will be simulcast on CBS.\nRead also: South Park Locks Into Paramount Plus With $1.5 Billion Streaming Deal\nThe move is part of Paramount's push to beef up its live sports offerings as the streaming wars escalate. UFC has grown into one of the most valuable sports properties, attracting a younger, global audience that streaming services are eager to capture.\nFor viewers, the deal means UFC coverage will shift away from its US home on ESPN, changing how fans watch and pay for fights. Paramount merged with David Ellison's Skydance after its purchasing of Paramount Global from Shari Redstone on Aug. 7.\n\"This deal puts UFC amongst the biggest sports in the world,\" UFC CEO and president Dana White posted on X. \"The exposure provided by the Paramount and CBS networks under this new structure is a huge win for our athletes and anyone who watches and loves this sport.\"\nThe deal comes as media companies face mounting pressure to secure live content to keep subscribers from jumping to their rivals. With UFC locked in, Paramount is betting that octagon action will help it land a decisive blow in the fight for streaming dominance."
