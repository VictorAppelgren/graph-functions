  "title": "Printemps Group\u2019s Place des Tendances Bets on Loyalty and Logistics to Fuel Growth",
  "description": "In his first interview since taking the helm, new CEO Guillaume Grimbert talks about his plan to grow the e-commerce player to 100 million euros in turnover.",
  "content": "In an era where fashion e-commerce is being reshaped by social media shopping and massive global platforms, Place des Tendances, the French multibrand retailer owned by Printemps Group, is betting on mid- to premium brands, longtime customer loyalty and speed-focused logistics to fuel its European expansion. For Guillaume Grimbert, who quietly stepped into the chief executive officer role in February, it was a return to his roots. As the platform\u2019s very first employee when it was a startup back in 2008, he helped the cofounders launch the e-commerce pioneer before embarking on a 20-year career in luxury fashion and real estate tech.\n\u2022 Ulta Beauty Goes Global: Expansion into U.K., Mexico, and Middle East Marks Major International Push He understands the potential of his origin story. \u201cAs far as storytelling, it\u2019s pretty good,\u201d he joked. Now at the helm of the company where he started his career, he\u2019s focused on expansion in a market butting up against decreasing consumer confidence. Grimbert emphasizes a data-driven approach. \u201cWe\u2019re not here to be everything for everyone,\u201d he said. That means pulling back from the home and decor category, which had been tested in recent years as a potential lifestyle play. Home will now be left to Made in Design, a sister company within Printemps Group. \u201cOur customers come to us for fashion and beauty,\u201d Grimbert said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a moment to go in a different direction. We want to focus on where we are very strong, and that\u2019s fashion, accessories, shoes and beauty.\u201d Instead, the company is expanding its offer within its two core verticals. In women\u2019s fashion, Place des Tendances has added popular and up-and-coming names like Farm Rio, while also seeking out emerging labels from the Nordic countries and Spain \u2014 creative hubs Grimbert believes are \u201cunderexposed\u201d to French consumers. \u201cWe are going to continue to search, like detectives, across Europe for new independent, trendy brands to propose to our customers,\u201d he said. The team regularly travels to Barcelona, Berlin and Brussels \u2014 just to name a few cities off the beaten fashion track \u2014 in search of new labels. But Grimbert is not betting the house on Gen Z. The site\u2019s core customer is a woman between 40 and 50 who lives outside of Paris and wants access to the latest fashion trends and brands from the capital \u2014 and even further afield, like Scandinavia or South Korea.\n\nIt currently hosts more than 400 brands from French stalwarts like Sandro to rising Scandi names like Rotate and Rue de Tokyo. Recent additions include British brand Damson Madder, Danish labels Tiny Big Sister and Minimum, and indie French brands including Hod Paris, Rouge Edit and Socque. Other Nordic names including Filippa K and Baum und Pferdgarten; Spanish brands Laagam, Toral and Bibi Lou, and Korean men\u2019s brand Solid will launch soon. Nars will soon be added in the beauty category. While Amazon has entered the fashion category \u2014 not to mention the low-cost volume play of Shein and Temu, which are facing political blowback and potential regulation in France \u2014 Grimbert sees limited competition from the international giants, particularly in the accessible luxury and premium segments. \u201cSome brands just don\u2019t want to be on Amazon. It doesn\u2019t align with their brand identity,\u201d he said. \u201cOr they don\u2019t want to be seen with too many wholesalers at the same time and be [overexposed].\u201d Case in point is French label Sandro, which prefers to be on a curated platforms that reflects its positioning as accessible luxury. Men\u2019s fashion, currently just a 10 percent slice of the business pie, is also receiving fresh investment with the addition of new brands. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the big white spaces in the French market,\u201d he said. A renewed focus on shoes, accessories and premium brands for men is part of the expansion plan, as is adding more brands for children down the line. Many have been shopping on the site for more than a decade \u2014 and Grimbert intends to keep them. \u201cSome of our customers have been with us since 2008. They place 50 orders a year. That\u2019s about one a week,\u201d Grimbert said. He is building new strategies around these frequent buyers. The team has introduced segmented loyalty levels, including a VIC tier, and is rolling out exclusive services such as invitation-only sales and bespoke gifting. \u201cWe think about our customer every minute,\u201d he said. \u201cI tell my team: see your customer, call them, listen to them.\u201d Grimbert\u2019s first focus has been on \u201cquick wins,\u201d including a revamp of the site to make it more intuitive for users, international rollouts and expanding the brand portfolio. Following the tech upgrades, Grimbert has set a clear target of reaching 100 million euros in turnover within his first year while strengthening profit margins. He emphasized the need to grow revenue efficiently by using a lower-risk marketplace model to test new brands, targeting high-value customers through the new loyalty perks and expanding outlet offerings for price-sensitive shoppers. \u201cWe want everyone who visits our site to be able to buy something, whether it\u2019s a 10 euro accessory or a 500 euro jacket. That\u2019s our vision,\u201d he said. The current average basket is 200 euros. Place des Tendances has its own warehouse just outside of Paris, which handles everything from product photography to order fulfillment. \u201cWe can often shoot and launch products before the brands themselves,\u201d Grimbert said. Staff can triple in size during peak months, and every team member uses tablet-based tools to pick and ship products in under 24 hours, with one-day delivery in Paris for its VIPs. \u201cWe built our own logistics software from the beginning,\u201d said Grimbert, of the company\u2019s proprietary warehouse management system. Grimbert intends to leverage this logistical edge to scale internationally, with a test-and-learn approach targeting the U.K., Belgium, Germany, Spain, Switzerland and the Netherlands. The site now ships to 15 countries. International growth is already up more than 20 percent year-over-year, and expected to be a key growth driver for his revenue goal. French market sales have grown in the single digits \u2014 which Grimbert framed as \u201cstill pretty good\u201d considering the current macroeconomic climate. Grimbert\u2019s three-year roadmap includes launching new services and building out both the men\u2019s and children\u2019s categories. He also plans to expand both the full-price and the outlet offerings to broaden the customer base and elevate the customer experience. Place des Tendances will launch a new campaign with French TV host Marine Vignes. The 52-year-old is popular with the brand\u2019s core demographic, and the campaign is timed with France\u2019s rentr\u00e9e, a period where the country roars back to life after the traditional August vacation \u2014 and a key shopping season. Vignes will curate a selection of looks that will be available on the site, structured around a chic day-to-night wardrobe. The campaign will roll out across both Place des Tendances and Vignes\u2019 personal social platforms, and those who come to the site from Vignes\u2019 social channels will have special discount codes. \u201cMarine Vignes is really inspirational for our customer, and represents the lifestyle of our community,\u201d he said, noting that it reflects the company\u2019s new influencer-focused content strategy. \u201cWe want to use personalities who represent our customers. We\u2019ll continue to do more activations like this.\u201d\n\u2022 Macy\u2019s Is Closing 66 Stores in 2025 \u2014 Here\u2019s the List, Live Updates Sign up for WWD's Newsletter.
