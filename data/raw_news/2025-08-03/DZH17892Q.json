  "title": "5 Reasons to Buy a Pre-Built PC",
  "description": "Building your own PC is a tempting idea, but there are plenty of good reasons to just buy a pre-built one instead.",
  "content": "A lot of people would frown on the idea of buying a pre-built PC instead of building your own from scratch. I might have done that in the past, too. But it's become abundantly clear lately that there are plenty of reasons to buy a pre-built PC: it's not lazy, it's just smart.\n\nYou Don't Have to Worry About Price Scalping on Parts\n\nPrice scalping on highly desired items has always been a problem, but with the economy a little on the painful side right now, it's a lot worse than it used to be. Scalping reached an all-time high in the post-pandemic era, and though it's calmed down a little bit, it's still unforgiving today. Practically any CPU or GPU that launches these days is guaranteed to have limited initial availability and over-inflated prices. It's paradise for scalpers.\n\nIt happened with the RTX 40 and RTX 50 series launch, and with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. It's probably going to keep happening in the foreseeable future. Acquiring the individual parts you want for your custom PC build is pretty difficult and expensive. This is one very good reason to consider a pre-built PC; they usually have sought-after CPUs and GPUs at MSRP prices, or at least close to them. It's not an exaggeration to say you can get a pre-built PC with in-demand components for a much lower price than buying those components and building a PC yourself.\n\nSure, you might have to sacrifice some specific aesthetic or one particular component you may have wanted. But if the budget is tight, a pre-built PC has the potential to be cheaper than a custom if the expensive parts you really want are part of it.\n\nA Pre-Built PC is Way More Convenient\n\nThis doesn't really need much explanation, does it? Building your own PC can be a lot of fun, but it's also a lot of work. Sourcing all the parts, putting everything together, and troubleshooting problems, the list is endless. If you're really good at it, it can be a whole day of work. If you aren't an expert, it can be several. There's something to be said about getting a PC that is already built and ready to go when it arrives at your doorstep.\n\nIt's not just the effort of building the initial PC, either. When you source your own parts, troubleshooting your build in the future can be a huge hassle since many of your components probably came from different sources. If you buy a pre-built PC, you'll only ever need one point of contact for diagnosis and troubleshooting, warranty questions, or any other customer service need.\n\nBesides, just because a PC is pre-built doesn't mean you can't customize it to some extent. A lot of vendors allow you to customize your purchase while still getting all of the aforementioned benefits. If you want the final product but not the effort of building and maintaining it yourself, a pre-built PC is the way to go.\n\nOne of the old-school advantages of building your own PC was that you could get the same performance as a pre-built for cheaper. Not to mention, in the old days, buying a pre-built PC could mean getting inferior components, vague specifications, or non-standard form factors. As long as you buy from a reputable vendor, this just isn't the case anymore. It's a transparent, high-value market these days, and there's a good chance of getting pre-built PCs cheaper than custom ones now.\n\nIn fact, if you have a relatively big budget, you'll find that there are a ton of great pre-built PC options from vendors like Lenovo or Dell. Check out some trusted vendors, price out the pre-built PC that you want, and compare it to how much it might cost to build something similar yourself. You might be surprised to learn how much cheaper it can be. At worst, it'll be roughly the same or slightly more expensive, but still way more convenient than having to build one yourself.\n\nBuilding Your Own PC Isn't Novel Anymore\n\nPart of the appeal of custom PC building in the past was just how unique each build could be. Components were more varied and competitive. There were more ways to achieve the same results. Aesthetics were less streamlined. There was some real fun in showing off your personal build and knowing that it was probably a lot different from most everyone else. Unfortunately, the industry has gotten so streamlined these days that such novelty doesn't really exist anymore.\n\n360mm AIOs, RGB fans, flamboyant RAM, fish tank cases; sure, it's not like you have to use these things, but they're overwhelmingly present. Not to mention the long wait times to get the parts you want, how expensive they are, or waiting for prices to go down, and the constant grind of upgrading certain components for marginally better gains with each new generation.\n\nOf course, far be it from me to say you aren't allowed to enjoy this hobby anymore. But I think those who have always been pretty big on it can identify that the custom PC heyday is a bit behind us now. It's worth enjoying for the love of the game, but it's definitely a more harrowing and less rewarding experience than it used to be, and it doesn't impress or turn heads like it used to.\n\nPre-Built PCs Have a Lot of Aesthetic Options Now\n\nPre-built PCs have come a long way in the past few decades. Not that long ago, buying a pre-built often meant settling for a plain, generic build. Well, the market for pre-built PCs has gotten a lot more competitive since then, so vendors have really stepped it up. Most pre-built PC builders offer a huge variety of sleek cases, unique designs, with great cable management, RGB lighting, themes, and a lot more.\n\nI'm not going to pretend that you can get anything more unique than a fully-built custom PC. After all, when you pick every single part yourself, of course, it's going to be pretty darn unique. But most vendors allow you to do a lot of customization even with a pre-built PC, including components, aesthetic themes, color, and much more. Some let you get pretty granular, customizing even the type of CPU cooler, RAM design, form factor, and motherboard design.\n\nThis means that choosing a pre-built PC over a custom isn't sacrificing aesthetic and personalization. You may not have the complete and total freedom of building your own PC from scratch, but you do have a lot more options than you used to, so if that was the main thing holding you back in the past, now is a good time to forget about that hangup. If you aren't that picky about aesthetics in the first place, well, all the more reason to go with a pre-built.\n\nUltimately, there are still good reasons to build your own PC from scratch. But there are just as many good reasons to buy a pre-built PC, too. Still, if you're dead-set on building your own custom machine, you might want to consider which parts you can afford to spend a little less on. If you are going to go custom, you may as well do what you can to make it as cheap as possible.",

      "text": "Are you looking to build a new gaming PC? If so, there\u2019s a lot of information out there on what parts to pick. Choosing the right processor, graphics card, RAM, and other components can be difficult, so I\u2019m here to cut through the noise.\nAs someone who has been building both high-end and mid-range gaming PCs for over a decade, I've tried just about every combination of hardware out there. With that experience, here are my tips on what you actually need to build a gaming PC in 2025.\nA Modern i5 Is More Than Enough to Game in 2025\nIn the past, I always viewed the i5 lineup as anemic when it came to gaming. However, in 2025, a mid-range CPU is more than enough to start your gaming journey.\nMany games still don\u2019t fully utilize multi-core performance as well as they could, so having a 16+ core processor doesn\u2019t always make as much of a difference as you\u2019d expect.\nI currently switch between a Ryzen 9 7900X and an i9-13900K system for gaming, and I rarely (and I do mean extremely rarely) see CPU utilization go above 10 to 20% when gaming.\nSo, whether you\u2019re on a budget or not, I\u2019d recommend spending any extra you\u2019d normally spend on a better processor on a better graphics card, unless you have enough money to max out both.\nIntel Core i5-14600K\n- Brand\n- Intel\n- CPU Model\n- Core i5-14600K\n- CPU Socket\n- LGA 1700\n- Cores\n- 6P+8E\nIntel's Core i5-14600K is a refresh of its popular Core i5-13600K, featuring the same cores and architecture but also higher clock speeds.\nMid-Range Graphics Cards Are Great for 1080P or 1440P Gaming\nLet\u2019s be realistic: just about every PC gamer wants the famed NVIDIA xx90 graphics card (like the RTX 5090). But what if I told you that it\u2019s completely unnecessary for most builds?\nI spent the better part of two years gaming on a Ryzen 5 5600X and an RTX 3060, and I enjoyed every second of it. My gaming system before that had a GTX 1080 and i7-6800K back in 2016, which were top of the line for the day. A mid-range system was uncharacteristic of me, but it gave me a great perspective.\nWith my mid-range system, I was able to drive just about any game I wanted at 1440p and medium settings. Some games I could crank up to high or ultra, but I was almost always able to get a solid experience at medium. My 1440p monitor was an ultra widescreen display, which pushed way more pixels than a traditional 16:9 screen\u2014though I recently switched back to 16:9 to make it easier for my GPU to drive my monitor.\nJust like I was, I think the average gamer can be extremely satisfied with an RTX 4060 or RTX 5060 graphics card. With frame generation, you\u2019ll be able to play at good to great frame rates even on newer titles.\nSure, you won\u2019t push 4K144Hz with a 4060, but that\u2019s honestly not all it\u2019s cracked up to be. 4K is great and all, but 1440p is the sweet spot for all PC gaming, in my opinion. So, I\u2019d recommend you stick to a graphics card perfect for that mid-range setup.\nASUS ROG Strix GeForce RTX 4060 OC Edition\n- Brand\n- ASUS\n- Cooling Method\n- Triple Fan\nThe ASUS ROG Strix RTX 4060 OC Edition is a great mid-range graphics card with 8GB of GDDR6 memory, three DisplayPort 1.4a outputs and one HDMI 2.1a. It also features NVIDIA's DLSS 3 technology for frame generation and the 3.1-slot design allows ample cooling of the graphics card.\n16GB of RAM Will Get You By, but 32GB Is Ideal\nIn the past, 16GB of RAM was the ideal configuration. It was affordable and gave you enough headroom to do whatever you\u2019d want. 32GB was seen as \u201coverkill\u201d but still desirable, and any more than that was unnecessary for most users.\nThese days, the field has shifted and 32GB has replaced 16GB as the ideal amount of RAM for your PC. It\u2019s definitely still possible to game on 16GB (or even 8GB), but I\u2019d highly recommend you get 32GB for your gaming system.\n32GB is now fairly affordable when it comes to DDR5 RAM, and it\u2019ll give you enough room for your system to grow in the future. If you can swing 64GB, I\u2019d say do that, but it\u2019s definitely not required for a gaming system.\nCORSAIR VENGEANCE RGB DDR5 RAM 32GB\n- Brand\n- CORSAIR\nThis CORSAIR VENGEANCE RGB DDR5 32GB RAM kit is perfect for your new gaming system. It features built-in RGB lighting across the top and has a moderate CAS latency. The 6400MHz overclocking support works with Intel's XMP 3.0 profiles to make it simple to achieve the best performance possible.\nA PCIe 5.0 SSD Is Completely Unnecessary, Go PCIe 3.0 Instead\nStorage used to be the thing that held gaming performance back. Going from IDE hard drives to SATA hard drives increased gaming performance. SATA hard drives to SATA SSDs increased gaming performance. SATA SSDs to PCIe SSDs increased gaming performance.\nHowever, once we hit PCIe 3.0 drives, things sort of plateaued. I recently reviewed the Samsung 9100 PRO NVMe SSD, which set the record as the fastest storage drive around, and decided to see if it actually made any difference in gaming.\nDuring my review, I put the 9100 PRO PCIe 5.0 drive up against a PCIe 4.0 and PCIe 3.0 drive to see which would come out victorious in gaming. I was surprised that PCIe 3.0 to PCIe 5.0 had very little difference in gaming performance, if any.\nThe read and write speeds were astonishingly different\u2014the PCIe 3.0 drive had read speeds of 3.29GB/s and write speeds of 2.739GB/s, while the PCIe 5.0 drive had read speeds of 14.72GB/s and write speeds of 13.49GB/s. That\u2019s nearly five times as fast. All for zero in-game performance difference.\nAll of that is to say: don\u2019t get a PCIe 5.0 drive for your gaming system unless you have some other reason for it. You\u2019re going to see hardly any (if at all) in-game performance increase for the extra cost of the drive. Instead, get a PCIe 3.0 or PCIe 4.0 drive that has more storage instead of more speed.\nPNY CS2230 2TB M.2 NVMe SSD\n- Storage capacity\n- 2TB\n- Hardware Interface\n- M.2 NVMe\nThe PNY CS2230 2TB NVMe SSD is a great mid-range storage drive. Offering 2TB of speedy SSD storage, this drive takes up very little space in your system as it mounts directly to the motherboard.\nNot All Motherboards Are Created Equal (But You Don\u2019t Need the Highest-End, Either)\nI\u2019ve been on both sides of the spectrum\u2014I\u2019ve had a top-tier motherboard (that cost over $700) and I\u2019ve had entry-level boards. Let me tell you why I\u2019ll never go ultra-top-tier again, but also why I don\u2019t recommend going as cheap as possible, either.\nUltra-top-tier motherboards are great if you have plans to set overclocking world records or want to build an all-out system, but that\u2019s about it. On the other hand, entry-level boards typically lack standard features, like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or multiple NVMe slots.\nThe best bang-for-your-buck is a middle-of-the-road motherboard.\nI typically recommend going with the higher-end motherboard series, like the Z790 or the X870 platform. This is because those platforms normally have the best power delivery, cooling, and port options when compared to the lower-tier motherboards.\nHowever, within that Z or X lineup of boards there\u2019s a wide (very wide) range you can choose from. There are $120 motherboards, and there are $700 motherboards. I tend to try and stay around the $150 to $200 price range, and see what all I can get there.\nWhen I\u2019m shopping for a new motherboard, my primary goal is to get the most I/O and storage capabilities I can within my budget. Some boards will offer Thunderbolt in that price range, others USB4, and some plain ol\u2019 USB 3.1/3.2. You have to be careful and double check what each board delivers.\nAlso, on the storage front, some boards come with just one or two M.2 NVMe slots, and others can have four or five. I really recommend you do your research here, and get the board that ticks all the boxes you want.\nJust don\u2019t worry about spending a crazy amount on a motherboard to make your system faster. Unless you plan to do wild overclocking, your motherboard choice will have very little effect on your actual gaming experience.\nGIGABYTE Z790 AORUS Elite AX\n- Brand\n- GIGABYTE\n- Memory Slots\n- 4\nThe GIGABYTE Z790 AORUS Elite AX is the best Intel motherboard for gaming for most users. It's got great connectivity options, lots of fast USB ports, four M.2 slots, and a high-quality VRM. The only major downside is the disappointing built-in audio solution.\nAir Cooling Is Better and Easier Than Liquid Cooling\nSimilar to other categories on this list, I\u2019ve been on both sides of the fence when it comes to cooling. I\u2019ve used all-in-one liquid coolers as well as air coolers. I\u2019ve even used entry-level coolers and premium ones, and I used to build custom loop liquid systems at a previous job.\nIf I\u2019m building out a system and going for the best price to performance ratio, I\u2019m going air cooling, hands down. Premium air coolers like the be quiet! Dark Rock Pro 5 can easily handle even the most power-hungry CPUs while staying cool and quiet.\nAll-in-one liquid coolers are fun and all, and I run three of them currently in my various systems (two 360mm and one 240mm). However, the performance just isn\u2019t what I\u2019d like. Even on my two 360mm systems, I will routinely hit 70 to 80C when gaming.\nSo, I would definitely recommend going air cooling on your system. If you plan to go with a modest i5, then even a Cooler Master 212 Black Edition is a fantastic choice. It\u2019ll provide plenty of cooling without breaking the bank.\nCooler Master Hyper 212 Halo Black CPU Air Cooler\nThe Cooler Master Hyper 212 Black Edition air cooler is perfect for all mid-range CPUs, and even some high-end processors. It works with both Intel and AMD processors, comes with a 120mm PWM fan, and offers a sleek appearance in your system.\nThe Right Case Is Whichever One You Like the Most\nCases are completely a personal choice in this day and age. You really can just choose whichever one you like best.\nIn the past, airflow was a huge concern depending on the case you went with. Airflow is definitely still a concern, but case designs these days typically offer decent enough airflow to not have to worry about buying special airflow-optimized cases.\nSo, when it comes to case choice, just pick what you like and go with it. A go-to for me for years has been just about anything from NZXT. All my current systems are built in NZXT cases, and I just love the aesthetic.\nHowever, you can simply just shop Amazon, B&H, Newegg, or anywhere else for a case and find the one that has what you want. Make sure the ports on the front or top match what you need though, as not all cases come with USB-C standard yet.\nNZXT H6 Flow\nThe NZXT H6 Flow PC case is a unique dual-chamber case that puts the power supply in a rear chamber for a cleaner build. It offers panoramic tempered glass, a sleek design, and enough room for a 360mm all-in-one liquid cooler.\nDon\u2019t Undersize Your Power Supply\nFor some reason, I\u2019ve always seen people put power supplies at the bottom of their parts list and almost entirely ignore them. Power supplies are one of the most important parts of any PC build, so you shouldn\u2019t skimp here.\nI\u2019m not saying that you should go out and buy a 1,200W 80+ Platinum-rated power supply to run an i5 and RTX 5060. I'm just saying don't cheap out.\nI typically recommend adding around 20% to what your system will pull at the max. An i5 and RTX 5060 system should pull right around 450W at max, which means you\u2019ll want at least a 550W power supply, though 600W supplies are typically easier to find.\nAlso, make sure to get at least an 80+ rated power supply, ideally an 80+ white or higher. This just gives you at least a good idea that the power supply should be relatively reliable. I\u2019d also recommend sticking with name-brands for your PSU, like CORSAIR, NZXT, SeaSonic, ThermalTake, SilverStone, or any others that have been around for a long time.\nThermaltake SMART 600W ATX PSU\nThermaltake's 600W 80+ White 12V ATX power supply is a great choice for both budget- and mid-range PC builds. It offers 600W of power, comes with connections for all graphics cards, and even still includes both SATA and Molex power connectors.\n1440P Is the Sweet Spot for Monitors\nWhile you might want to pick up a 4K gaming monitor, I\u2019d actually recommend against that.\nUnless you\u2019re going with a high-end graphics card, a 4K monitor will be largely a waste in your setup. I have spent close to 10 years gaming at 1440p, and, had I not found the incredible deal I did on my current monitor, I\u2019d still be gaming at 1440p.\nHere\u2019s the thing about 1440p\u2014it\u2019s easy for your graphics card to drive. While the RTX 4060 and 5060 can technically drive 8K displays, actually gaming at that resolution will be nearly impossible with anywhere close to an enjoyable frame rate.\nThis is one of the main reasons I recommend mid-range gamers aim for 1440p. It\u2019s a resolution that you can easily drive in-game, and with modern graphics cards, you might even be able to push high or ultra settings and still be at a solid frame rate.\nPlus, 1440p monitors are simply more affordable than their 4K counterparts, making it much easier to afford when building out your gaming setup.\nAcer Nitro 27-inch 1440p 180Hz Gaming Monitor\nThe Acer Nitro 27-inch 1440p 180Hz gaming monitor is great for any gaming setup. With a 1440p resolution, it'll be easy for both mid-range and high-end graphics cards to drive with solid FPS. Plus, the 180Hz refresh rate gives you a smooth experience no matter what game you're playing.\nPicking the Perfect Peripherals\nWith the hardware of the actual gaming PC covered, you\u2019ll still need a few more things. I\u2019d recommend at least picking up a gaming mouse, headset, and keyboard\u2014though they don\u2019t all have to be top-of-the-line.\nOn the mouse side of things, it\u2019s hard to go wrong with something like the Logitech G305 LIGHTSPEED wireless. It\u2019s a solid mouse, has been around for a while, and helps keep the clutter on your desk to a minimum. Plus, it won\u2019t break the bank.\nLogitech G305 LIGHTSPEED Wireless Gaming Mouse\nThe G305 is an affordable wireless gaming mouse that doesn't feel any less responsive than the wired competition.\nFor a headset, the HyperX Cloud III is a solid contender for sure.

      "text": "Summary\n- Pre-built PCs now use name-brand components and have shifted away from low-quality parts to a higher standard.\n- Upgrading a pre-built system is easy, since you can add storage or swap out the RAM or GPU.\n- Pre-built PCs come with better warranties for all original components compared to custom-built systems.\nAre you looking at buying a pre-built gaming PC, but leery because of the reputation of pre-built systems? While the past they may not have been worth buying, modern pre-built gaming PCs are actually a great choice for your setup\u2014here\u2019s why.\nPre-Built PCs Used to Be Built With Bottom of the Barrel Parts\nIn the past, I had always told people to avoid pre-built gaming PCs. They were known for using low-quality and cheap parts to save a buck while charging a premium for being \u201cbuilt for gaming.\u201d\nWhen I used to work in PC repair, I can\u2019t tell you how many no-name low-cost power supplies I replaced, nor can I even begin to remember how many junky motherboards blew caps after just a year or two of use.\nThis alone was enough to avoid going pre-built\u2014but that\u2019s all changed now.\nAlmost All Pre-Builts Use Name-Brand Components\nA shift in recent years has changed the landscape of pre-built gaming PCs. For a while, you couldn\u2019t get graphics cards (or any PC components, for that matter) unless you bought a pre-built system because of scalpers.\nCompanies actually saw this and did something good for a change: built better systems. Yes, pre-built PC prices did go up some, but so did the quality of the systems.\nInstead of no-name bargain-barrel power supplies, many mid-range gaming PCs now ship with name-brand PSUs. The same can be said for SSDs, graphics cards, motherboards, and RAM.\nAnother thing that happened was a lot of component manufacturers got into the pre-built gaming space. Yes, there are still brands like ORIGIN-PC and MAINGEAR out there, but CORSAIR, NZXT, MSI, and others now have pre-built gaming desktops that are pretty great, all things considered.\nRather than skimping out, many companies are now using name-brand and quality components, and everyone benefits from this. Of course, there are still bargain-bin PCs out there that use no-name components, but that\u2019s becoming the exception, not the rule.\nPre-Built PCs Can Still Be Upgraded Just Like Custom-Built Ones\nSomething you might not realize is that pre-built PCs can be upgraded just like custom-built systems. A custom-built PC and pre-built PC is all built from the same parts\u2014the only thing that changes is who is building it.\nThis means you can swap out the RAM, SSD, graphics card, power supply, or even processor without a problem. While the new components won\u2019t be covered under the pre-built PC company\u2019s warranty (more on that below), you\u2019ll have an upgraded system.\nOne of the biggest ways you can upgrade a pre-built system is by adding more storage. Since many companies are using name-brand and premium motherboards, there are typically a handful of NVMe slots on modern systems, with only one being used up in a typical build from the factory.\nAnother way is by adding more or swapping out RAM entirely. Both the NVMe upgrade and RAM upgrade can add big benefits to your system while being easy and cost-effective to do.\nHowever, the biggest thing you can swap out in a pre-built system is also (typically) the biggest component\u2014the graphics card. Yes, in a pre-built system you can definitely swap the GPU out, so long as the power supply can keep up.\nIf the PSU is too underpowered for the new GPU you plan to add? Just upgrade the PSU at the same time.\nBuying a Pre-Built PC Comes With a Better Warranty Than Custom-Built\nThe warranty of a pre-built gaming PC is actually better than that of a custom-built\u2014sort of.\nPre-built systems are warrantied top to bottom for the original components that it ships with. Depending on what brand you go with, a warranty claim could result in either a full system swap or a single component swap.\nEither way, however, the brand will likely offer full system diagnostics to help determine what the issue is. Custom-building your own PC isn\u2019t quite so user-friendly in that regard.\nI have a friend who re-built his gaming PC recently and did a custom build. He just spent almost two weeks diagnosing what the issue was so he could RMA the defective parts. To diagnose the issue, he had to purchase new components to test things one-by-one in order to find out what was broken.\nThis wouldn\u2019t have been the case had he went pre-built.\nSo, if you\u2019re not super savvy on PC building (or you just want to take the easy way out), there\u2019s nothing wrong with buying a pre-built gaming PC these days. While the gaming community might see that as a lesser system, know that it\u2019s not lesser in any way.\nPre-built gaming PCs are great options these days, and still remain one of the few ways to get brand-new graphics cards on release with any relative ease."

      "url": "https://www.howtogeek.com/858042/how-to-choose-an-aio-cooler/",
      "text": "Summary\n- Select your radiator size based on the type of CPU you have; choose single for mid-range CPUs, and double or triple for higher-end.\n- Examine your heatsink material and socket compatibility for proper cooling performance.\n- Opt for reputable brands such as EKWB, Corsair, or Cooler Master to ensure efficient cooling and longevity.\nIf you're shopping parts for a gaming PC, you might be considering an aftermarket water cooling solution. There are plenty of options out there, but which one should you choose, and what factors should you take into account?\nTo help you decide, we'll round out what you should look out for in an all-in-one (closed) water cooling solution, so you're able to make a more educated purchase.\nCheck the Radiator\nAll water cooling solutions come with a radiator to help dissipate heat. Like the radiator in your car, the radiator in your PC can help you dissipate heat \u2014 coolant moves heat away from your CPU and into the radiator, where computer fans are installed that blow that excess heat out of the system. Before installing a radiator, though, you need to know which one you need to fit, and whether you can even fit it into your PC's case.\nRadiators in AIO water coolers normally come in three different sizes: single, double, and triple radiators. As the name suggests, the first one takes a single fan, the second one takes two fans, and the third one takes three fans. You might also find them as 120mm radiators, 240mm radiators, and 360mm radiators. Some of them are also slightly wider, taking 140mm fans instead of 120mm ones \u2014 you'll find the double and triple versions of those as 280mm and 420mm radiators. There are also quad radiators that take four fans, but those are very rare and frankly, not many people need them.\nWhich one you'll need will depend entirely on your setup. As a rule of thumb, though, single radiators are best for mid-range CPUs, like the AMD Ryzen 5 or the Intel Core i5. For higher-end chips, like the AMD Ryzen 7/9 or the Intel Core i7/i9, you'll want to get at least a double or triple radiator, since those generate a lot of heat. You can look up reviews of that water-cooling solution and see if anyone is using it with your specific choice of CPU, or a similar one, to be certain about your choice.\nAnd then comes the question of whether you can fit it in your PC. Your choice of radiator should be made before you choose a PC case, as you need to be sure that you can actually install that cooling solution comfortably. While single radiators can be installed on any fan vent in your PC case, double and triple radiators take a decent amount of space. Normally, though, in most cases, you'll find a top vent specifically made for radiators that take up the top of your case, so you can probably buy one of those as long as you've made sure it fits properly.\nExamine the Heatsink\nThe heatsink is the part of the water-cooling solution that's actually attached to the CPU. Also known as the block, it draws heat out of your CPU, so you need to make sure that the block itself is solidly made.\nIn reality, though, it's pretty hard to get a block wrong. As far as material goes, copper blocks are considered to be better heat conductors than aluminum blocks, so if you get a cooling solution with a copper block that has a decent amount of thermal mass, then you're probably golden.\nWhen you're buying it, though, you need to check if that block properly supports your motherboard's socket, and that it has an appropriate mounting solution. The vast majority of water cooling solutions come with brackets and mounts for both Intel and AMD CPUs, but if you have a newer or older chip, make sure to check if the cooling solution has the mount you need before you buy it. Some blocks might also be Intel-first or AMD-first, and while they might have mounts for the other CPU brand, the fact that it's an afterthought might complicate installation.\nLook for a Reputable Brand\nLast but not least, you need to make sure that the water cooling solution is actually made by a reputable brand, and whether the specific product you're buying is any good. There are a number of cheaper water cooling solutions that can fail within months \u2014 the pump might fail, or the radiator might have a defect.\nGenerally, brands like EKWB, Corsair, and Cooler Master are regarded as being the golden standard of liquid coolers, since they're efficient at cooling and they last a long time. But all of it will, of course, come down to the quality of those specific products.\nCorsair iCUE H150i Elite LCD XT Liquid CPU Cooler\nThe Corsair iCUE H150i Elite LCD XT offers slick design, mountains of RGB, and excellent cooling performance. It can get loud under strenuous loads but it's very quiet during normal usage.\nIt's better to overspend than underspend when it comes to the quality of your liquid cooler, as a damaged or otherwise inefficient cooler can shorten the lifespan of your CPU and, eventually, your whole PC. And if you need to priorize something, you might want to ditch things like RGB lighting and flashy features in general."

      "text": "Quick Links\nBuilding your own PC means spending a lot of money on things you just can't cut corners with: the CPU, the graphics card, storage, and your power supply\u2014there's no avoiding a hefty cost for these parts. But you can offset the cost of those components by going cheap on other parts.\n5 A Standard Case Is More Than Enough\nWhen building your dream machine, you want a case that looks amazing and has a bunch of nifty features. But if you are building a PC on a budget, this is definitely a component that you can cheap out on. It's just the container that holds all of your parts. It doesn't actually do anything valuable that requires it to cost over a $100.\nAdmittedly, cheap PC cases used to be rightfully considered subpar and low-quality. But we live in the here and now, where affordable cases offer everything you need, including sufficient airflow, cable space, and component clearance. Cases that cost less than $50 can give you all of that. If you want to go a little higher, you should never have to go over $100. Brands like Ant Esports, Antec, Corsair, Cooler Master, and Galax all have excellent affordable PC cases.\nWill they be the most aesthetically awesome case money can buy? No. But if you're trying to save your budget for things that actually matter, why not shave $50 off the case and put it toward a graphics card instead?\n4 Cheap CPU Coolers Still Get the Job Done\nMany ideas of what PC parts need to be expensive are colored by older technology and concerns that just don't exist anymore. CPU cooling just isn't as big of a problem as it used to be, even if you're building an impressive rig. Sure, you could spend $450 on a high-end liquid cooler, but you'll probably be just fine with a $35 air cooler. Even if you're using an 8-core CPU, a $45 cooler can almost certainly handle the toastiness.\nA lot of people building their own PC love the idea of a 360mm AIO cooler, and I get it; it's a pretty awesome piece of tech, and it feels cool to say you have one. But it's really huge overkill for most PCs. Even the idea that liquid cooling is inherently better than air cooling is rooted in the distant past and is no longer true. Not only have air coolers become more powerful and efficient over the years, but CPUs have better thermal regulation than they used to as well.\nAll in all, you can definitely save hundreds of dollars on a CPU cooler if you focus on what you actually need instead of what looks the coolest or is the most fun to brag about to your friends.\n3 A Cheap Fan is as Good as Any\nFans are one of those components that don't need to be complicated. Yes, you can spend a ton of money on the most advanced fans out there, but you rarely actually need anything above the cheapest. If you have all the money in the world to blow, than sure, min-max your case fans by comparing acoustics, materials, static pressure and all that other good stuff. But if you're on a budget, just keep it simple.\nMost of the time, the fans that come in an affordable PC case are plenty efficient and quiet. I've never even replaced the fans in mine, and I've never had one malfunction or get super noisy in the past five years. While cheaper fans may not last as long as the more expensive ones, they still last several years on average, and most gamers won't push their fans hard enough to cause some sort of early malfunction.\nIf you really want to pick out your own fans, just keep it simple. There are plenty of RGB fans from brands like Thermalright or Arctic that satisfy in every functional regard. This is one component you just don't need to blow a ton of money on; most fans these days blow just as good as any other, with the more expensive ones offering marginal benefits at best.\n2 Motherboards Don't Need to Drain Your Wallet\nSome people would condemn me outright for saying you can cheap out on the motherboard. It's one of the most important components to a PC, right? Well, I'm not saying you should always go cheap on this, but it really just depends on what you are doing with your PC. If you're running a very high-end CPU and overclocking your processors, then sure, you might want to go for one. But otherwise, you don't need an expensive motherboard.\nJust look for a $130-$150 motherboard; it has all the features most gamers need and won't negatively impact your performance either. A motherboard at this price will still get you onboard Wi-Fi, plenty of Gen4 M.2 ports, decent VRMs, and 2.5Gb Ethernet. Some AMD boards at that price will even come with a long-lasting socket. Sure, maybe you won't be able to get a Gen5 SSD or VRMs that are massive overkill, but you only need those things if you're going on the extreme end of PC gaming, and most people aren't.\nLike many other components, the general quality of motherboard builds has gone up recently, meaning you can get quality boards for under $200. Especially these days, when you can find plenty of reviews and customer ratings to confirm whether or not a component is reliable and trustworthy.\n1 You Just Don't Need That Much RAM\nYour RAM is pretty important, make no mistake. But it gives you diminishing returns. It is a good idea to have 32GB of DDR5, but that's about all you need for the vast majority of modern computer use, even in AAA gaming. Almost nothing requires 64GB of RAM to play, and certainly not 64GB of DDR5. There's just no reason to pay for that much RAM. And sure, you could spend $150 on a 32GB kit with 6,000MT/s, but you can get that for under $100 as well.\nFor example, there are brands on Amazon like Teamgroup and Crucial that offer 32GB of DDR5 at around $80. Even CL30 kits are usually only around $100. If you choose RAM kits that don't have unnecessary heat sinks, you can save yourself even more money. Ultimately, RAM is one of those things where having more of it than you need doesn't really do that much for you. If you have enough RAM to play the games and run the programs you want, having double that much RAM will only provide barely noticeable returns.\nIn fact, having too much high-speed RAM can even cause problems for your computer if you plan on overclocking it. With even the most demanding AAA games these days only recommending 32GB of RAM, just pay for what you need. It will be quite some time before games regularly need 64GB of RAM, so there's no point in getting that much now when you probably aren't going to need it for any game you're going to play in the near future.\nUltimately, there are many, many components to a PC that you shouldn't be cheap with. But in order to save money for those components, you should be cheap with what you can. These days, buying something affordable doesn't mean buying poor quality. There are plenty of great PC parts you can buy at an affordable price if you know where to look, especially if you wait for deals or sales where you can get them for even cheaper. If you're on a budget, building your own PC doesn't have to be a pipe dream."

      "text": "The RTX 5000 series cards are out, but you might not have even realized it because they all sold out within seconds, which is the perfect moment for scalpers to step in. Within minutes of officiall stock running out, scalpers started to pop up with the units they managed to secure for the high prices you'd probably expect.\nScalpers have secured units of the RTX 5090 and the RTX 4090, and the price the cards command right now is absolutely crazy. The RTX 5080, which has a $999 price point, is commanding prices north of $3,000 from resellers on Ebay. The more expensive RTX 5090, on the other hand, might set you back $7,000 or even $10,000 if you're desperate to get one today. It's worth noting that some of these purchases might not have gone through after the sale; eBay lets buyers cancel orders before they ship, but the listing might still say \"Sold\" or \"Best offer accepted.\"\nThe RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 5070 have not been released yet, but once they land on retailers, we also expect them to resell for three times their usual MSRP. That's just over $1,500 for the RTX 5070 and almost $2,500 for the RTX 5070 Ti.\nThis whole situation actually reminds us a lot of the RTX 3000-series launch. The RTX 4000 range did sell out on launch day, with some scalpers trying to capitalize on it, but NVIDIA managed to normalize supply pretty quickly. For these RTX 5000 cards, however, it's expected that this shortage might last for the next three months. Hopefully, we won't enter another big GPU shortage like the one we had from 2020 to 2022, since there were a lot of factors in play then that aren't in play right now. But you'll have to wait a bit if you were hoping to put an RTX 5000-series card on your PC.\nSource: Ebay"

      "text": "Read update\n- We've reviewed our recommendations and these are still the best pre-built PCs you can buy.\nPre-built PCs can be as good as custom PCs, as long as you do your diligence and not spend your hard-earned cash on the first pre-built that catches your eye.\nUPDATE: 08/15/2024\nWe've reviewed our recommendations and these are still the best pre-built PCs you can buy.\nWhat to Look For in a Pre-built PC in 2024\nThe two most important components of every PC, including pre-built PCs, are the CPU and the graphics card. In other words, you should spend the first part of your research process singling out PCs that pack the right CPU and GPU combo for your particular needs. If you\u2019re a gamer, you probably want the best CPU and GPU combo that fits your budget, but if you don\u2019t play games and don\u2019t require a powerful GPU for productivity purposes, you can get by with a CPU packing an integrated GPU.\nNext, you should focus on secondary components that, in some scenarios, can be more important for the overall performance than the CPU and GPU. For example, if you find a pre-built PC that packs the right CPU and GPU combo but features only 8GB of memory, a zero airflow housing, or includes inadequate CPU cooling setup, you might end up with a machine performing worse than a PC with a slower CPU and GPU but with an adequate amount of memory and a capable cooling setup.\nSecondary components include the motherboard, memory, storage, case, case fans, CPU cooler, and the power supply unit (PSU). So, once you settle on the CPU and GPU, ensure the PC(s) you\u2019re interested in isn\u2019t seriously lacking in some other department. Just note that pre-built PCs are, in most cases, not the best possible all-around machines and that some compromises had to be made.\nPre-built PC buyers should also pay special attention to the cooling setup. Many pre-built PCs try to get away with including the cheapest cooler possible, which, in many scenarios, can lead to noticeable performance drops during CPU-intensive workloads. You should also look for pre-builts with decent PSUs that have some power to spare so that you can upgrade the PC with a more powerful CPU or GPU in the future. And if your workflow includes lots of writes to the storage drive, get a pre-built PC featuring an SSD with DRAM cache since those are much better at writing operations than DRAM-less solid-state drives.\nRegarding memory, many pre-built PC brands try to save money by using slow RAM inside the build or including less than ideal amount of memory. For example, if you\u2019re buying a high-end gaming or productivity PC, 16GB of slow\u2014anything below 3000 MT/s\u2014DDR4 memory is insufficient. In the case of a high-end gaming PC, 32GB of memory is optimal nowadays, with 64GB or more being the right choice for powerful productivity-focused machines. If you\u2019re looking for a budget or a mid-range gaming PC, 16GB of memory is a must.\nMemory working in dual-channel mode is a must for gaming pre-builts with DDR4 RAM. DDR5 RAM works differently, so a single RAM stick should provide almost the same performance as two sticks working in dual channel. Also, make sure your memory works at its specified overclock speeds\u2014XMP for Intel CPUs, EXPO for AMD CPUs\u2014and not just at default speeds.\nAn inadequate CPU cooler can considerably drop CPU performance, and many gaming-focused pre-builts try to cram the cheapest possible CPU cooler that may be fine for gaming loads. Still, the moment you try doing something that pushes the CPU to its limits, it will choke and thermal throttle because the cooler can\u2019t keep up. In general, try looking for pre-builts that pack at least 240mm AIO CPU coolers because, while there are loads of quality budget air coolers out there, pre-built PCs usually come with the cheapest possible cooling solution, and those are usually not great for anything other than budget CPUs.\nConcerning the motherboard, most brands don't share the specs of the motherboards they use in pre-built PCs or, like Dell, include proprietary motherboards designed to be serviceable for the CPU in question but not much else. You don\u2019t have much in terms of choice here, so we recommend not focusing on the motherboard and just getting a pre-built that suffices in other aspects. A quality pre-built PC usually comes with at least an adequate motherboard for the included CPU.\nMost pre-builts for the chassis come with proprietary designs or affordable aftermarket housings. Some brands, such as Origin PC, allow users to pick from a list of PC cases, but those usually cost extra. If you plan on upgrading the PC in the future, we recommend skipping pre-built PCs made by Dell, Alienware, HP, and any other pre-built PC that comes with a proprietary motherboard, case, or power supply. Since you won\u2019t be able to replace the motherboard or the PSU, you won't be able to use the case as the basis for a new machine.\nOur last piece of advice is to read user reviews, especially those focusing on overall performance and thermals. Many pre-built PCs feature low airflow cases combined with cheap cooling setups, resulting in excessively high thermals that limit CPU and sometimes even GPU performance. You should get a pre-built with decent thermals where the CPU isn\u2019t choking due to an inadequate cooler and a low airflow case.\n|\nHow Did We Research |\n||\n|\nModels Evaluated |\nHours Researched |\nReviews Analyzed |\n|\n34 |\n7 |\n17 |\nHow-To Geek's product recommendations come from the same team of experts that have helped people fix their gadgets over one billion times.

The Corsair Vengeance i7400 is the company\u2019s high-end pre-built PC that's a great choice for users needing an all-around PC for gaming and work.\nThe Vengeance i7400 uses many of the company\u2019s bestselling components, including the excellent 4000D Airflow case, four high-end 120mm RGB case fans, the fully modular RM1000X PSU, 64GB of Vengeance RGB Pro DDR5 memory, and one of the best 240mm AIOs around, the H100i RGB Elite. The 2TB solid-state drive (SSD) is also Corsair\u2019s MP600, which is nothing to write home about but still more than a decent choice for the main storage drive.\nYou\u2019ve also got Intel\u2019s flagship CPU, the Core i9-13900K, paired with the current NVIDIA's flagship GPU, the RTX 4090. Finally, the Z690 motherboard used is the MSI Pro Z690-A Wi-Fi, one of the best budget Z690 motherboards that features Wi-Fi 6E and a 2.5GBps Ethernet. The overall package is impressive for a pre-built PC. While Corsair could\u2019ve put a 360mm AIO, the included 240mm unit is more than enough for any gaming scenario, and it shouldn\u2019t noticeably limit the 13900K during CPU-intensive workloads.\nThe Corsair Vengeance i7400 presents one of the best all-round pre-built PCs on the market. The CPU and GPU combo is perfect for any game or productivity task you might have in mind, 64GB of DDR5 memory is great for intensive productivity workloads, and the use of regular aftermarket components along with one of the best PSUs around means you will be able to upgrade the PC in the future or build an almost entirely new PC inside the 4000D Airflow chassis while keeping the RM1000X PSU as the cornerstone of the new build.\nThe listed price of $3950 presents decent value, considering that building a similar PC on your own would cost only a few hundred dollars less. If you\u2019re a professional looking for a high-end workstation, we recommend checking out Falcon Northwest's pre-built PCs since you can equip those with NVIDIA RTX professional GPUs. And if you need a workstation specifically made for your specific workflow that also comes with premium customer support, check out workstation offerings from Maingear and Puget Systems. They come at a premium, but the customer support and expert advice you\u2019re getting are worth the extra cash.\nCorsair Vengeance i7400\nIf you're looking for a high-end pre-built PC for gaming and productivity, get the Corsair Vengeance i7400. It features the RTX 4090 and Core i9-13900K combo, a high airflow case, a 1000W PSU, 64GB of DDR5 memory, and 2TB of PCIe 4.0 storage.\nBest Pre-Built Budget PC: Beelink Mini S12 Pro\n|\nPros |\nCons |\n|---|---|\n|\nPowerful enough for everyday tasks |\nZero USB-C ports |\n|\nCosts less than $200 |\nSingle-channel memory |\n|\nCompact form factor |\nNot made for CPU/GPU intensive tasks |\n|\nWi-Fi 6 is great to see in such an affordable PC |\n|\n|\n16GB of memory |\nIf you\u2019re looking for a budget PC that can deliver enough power for browsing, content consumption, working in Microsoft Office/Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace suite, and even some light photo or video editing, we recommend checking the Beelink Mini S12 Pro mini PC. This tiny PC takes less space than a toaster and costs less than $200 while coming with fantastic specs for the price.\nYou\u2019ve got a 12th Gen Intel N100 CPU, which is a four-core SKU without hyper-threading that\u2019s more than enough for light usage that doesn\u2019t include CPU-heavy tasks or high-end gaming, with the integrated GPU being speedy enough to run 4K videos and 2D pixel art games. The Mini S12 Pro also packs 16GB of memory, a 512GB SSD, Wi-Fi 6, and Gigabit Ethernet, everything a regular user might need in a PC.\nWe like the inclusion of four USB-A 3.2 10Gbps ports, and while you don\u2019t get a USB-C port, you can use a cheap USB-C to USB-A adapter to connect USB-C devices to the PC. You can even run a multi-monitor setup since the Beelink Mini S12 Pro has two HDMI 2.0 ports. All this is packed inside a tiny, sleek-looking chassis you can tuck anywhere on your desk or even carry around, considering its compact dimensions. You can even hide the case behind your monitor since the selling package includes a VESA mount bracket.\nUpgrade options include adding a 2.5-inch HDD/SSD or another M.2 SSD, since the main board features an extra M.2 SSD slot. Not great, but considering this is a mini PC the size of two soda cans, we\u2019ve no issues with limited upgradability. Another potential downside is single-channel memory, but since this isn\u2019t a gaming PC or a high-end workstation, single-channel memory isn\u2019t a major issue.\nIf you need something beefier, capable of running newer games, and with enough horsepower for CPU-intensive tasks, the Beelink SER5 comes with the AMD Ryzen 5 5500U CPU that\u2019s much more powerful than the Intel N100 and that packs a more capable iGPU, while costing $60 more than the Mini S12 Pro.\nBeelink Mini S12 Pro\nThe Beelink Mini S12 Pro packs a lot for less than $200. The CPU is powerful enough for everyday tasks, there is 16GB of memory, an iGPU capable of playing 4K videos, a 512GB SSD, Wi-Fi 6, all inside a tiny case that can fit anywhere.\nBest Pre-Built Gaming PC: iBuyPower Intel 13th Gen Extreme Gaming PC\n|\nPros |\nCons |\n|---|---|\n|\nRTX 4090 + Core i9-13900KF |\nExpensive |\n|\niBUYPOWER configurator allows replacing every component |\nThe default motherboard option could've been better |\n|\n360mm AIO coupled with a high airflow case |\n|\n|\nExcellent value, for a pre-built gaming PC |\n|\n|\n2TB of PCIe 4.0 storage |\n|\n|\n1000W PCIe 5.0-compatible PSU |\nGamers looking for a powerful gaming PC that can run all the latest games in 4K and triple-digit frame rates should seriously consider the Intel 13th Gen Extreme Gaming PC from iBuyPower. This build includes quality components, one of the most powerful CPU and GPU combos around, an excellent cooling setup including a high airflow case, lots of fast storage space, and all that at more than a decent price of $3,349.\nThe base configuration comes with the Intel Core i9-13900KF CPU\u2014the regular 13900K but without the iGPU\u2014and the NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU. You\u2019ve also got 32GB of DDR5 memory working at 5200 MT/s, the ASUS Prime Z790-P motherboard with Wi-Fi 6, a 1000W ATX 3.0-compatible PSU (meaning no GPU power adapters), 2TB of PCIe 4.0 storage, a 360mm AIO CPU cooler, and the NZXT H7 Flow case.\nLooking at the config, we\u2019d change the motherboard since the ASUS Prime Z790-P isn\u2019t an optimal fit for the 13900KF, and the memory because iBuyPower uses slow DDR5 memory sticks. Luckily, you can tweak the build to your liking, thanks to the excellent configurator offered by iBuyPower. You can swap every component, add extra storage, a standalone sound card, or even select a different thermal paste applied to the CPU.\nAt the end of the day, the Intel 13th Gen Extreme Gaming PC presents a mighty fine combination of quality components at a decent price for a high-end gaming PC that can run any current AAA title at max settings in 4K without any issues. The best thing about this pre-built PC is that you can tweak it by replacing every component on the buying page. If you\u2019re looking for something more affordable that\u2019s not far behind this PC in terms of gaming performance, the iBuyPower SlateMR Gaming Desktop featuring the Ryzen 7 7700X CPU and the NVIDIA RTX 4080 GPU is a pretty good alternative.\niBUYPOWER Intel 13th Gen Extreme Gaming PC\nThe RTX 4090 and Core i9-13900KF is one of the most powerful combos you can get in a gaming PC, and the iBUYPOWER's Gaming PC packs not only that, but also 2TB of PCIe 4.0 storage, a 360mm AIO and a high airflow case, 32GB of DDR5 memory, and a 1000W PCIe 5.0-compatible PSU.\nBest Pre-Built Budget Gaming PC: Skytech Shiva\n|\nPros |\nCons |\n|---|---|\n|\nLots of bang for your buck |\nCPU cooler isn't that great |\n|\nRTX 4060 supports DLSS 3.0 |\n650W PSU is not perfect concerning CPU and GPU upgrades |\n|\n16GB of dual-channel memory |\nPretty basic motherboard |\n|\n1TB of fast storage |\n|\n|\nThe Core i5-12400F is a great budget gaming CPU |\nThe Skytech Shiva variant with an Intel Core i5-12400F CPU and an NVIDIA RTX 4060 GPU costs $1049 and is one of the best budget pre-built gaming PCs you can get. The Intel Core i5-12400F is still one of the best budget gaming CPUs around. While the NVIDIA RTX 4060 doesn\u2019t offer tons of value, it\u2019s still almost as fast as the RTX 3060 Ti, one of the best bang-for-buck GPUs from NVIDIA while also supporting DLSS 3.0 frame generation tech found in more and more new titles, which should prolong this graphics card\u2019s usability when it comes to AAA gaming.\nOther components include a decent-looking air CPU cooler \u2014not great but more than adequate for the 12400F\u2014 16GB of dual-channel DDR4 memory working at 3200 MT/s, a 650W 80-Plus Gold PSU, a 1TB NVMe SSD, and a motherboard with Wi-Fi 5 support. The chassis isn\u2019t an airflow champion, but this CPU and GPU combo isn\u2019t a huge heat generator, so thermals should be in check. At least the case looks very nice and packs a ton of RGB.\nThis config should provide excellent gaming performance at 1080p. You should be able to max or almost max out the details in the latest AAA titles and get 60fps or higher performance, even with ray-tracing effects in some games. At 1440p, the Skytech Shiva should be able to run AAA games at 60fps or higher with medium to high details. eSports titles should run at triple-digit frame rates no matter the resolution, as long as you don\u2019t max out the visual options.\nThe best thing about this pre-built gaming PC is the price and the overall gaming performance you\u2019re getting for that price. Concerning negatives, the motherboard looks rather basic, but, fortunately, the Core i5-12400F is power efficient and doesn\u2019t require a beast of a motherboard to fully spread its wings. We also believe Skytech should\u2019ve opted for a bit more powerful PSU to allow users to upgrade to a more powerful CPU and GPU in the future. Other than that, the Skytech Shiva presents an excellent pre-built gaming PC deal.\nSkytech Shiva\nThe Core i5-12400F is one of the best budget gaming CPUs and the RTX 4060 is a pretty solid choice for 1080p and 1440p gaming, and you can find both in the Skytech Shiva gaming PC. This budget gaming pre-built also features 16GB of dual channel memory, 1TB of fast storage, and a decent, 650W PSU. Not bad for a budget gaming PC.\nBest Pre-Built Small Form Factor PC: EK 150 Battle\n|\nPros |\nCons |\n|---|---|\n|\nBrilliant selection of components |\nA tad bulky for an SFX gaming PC |\n|\n360mm AIO |\nExpensive |\n|\n32GB of 6000 MT/s DDR5 memory |\n|\n|\n2TB of PCIe 4.0 storage |\n|\n|\nRTX 4070 Ti is a good choice for 1440p and 4K gaming |\nSmall form factor pre-built PCs usually come at quite a steep price premium compared to what you\u2019d pay for a similarly specced PC you'd build yourself, but in the case of the EK 150 Battle pre-built PC, the price premium is justified. EKWB is one of the most known names in the liquid cooling community thanks to their superb custom loop, water cooling kit, and AIO designs, and by looking at the components used in the EK 150 Battle PC, we can say the company didn\u2019t make any compromises regarding the quality of said components.\nYou\u2019ve got the AMD Ryzen 5 7600X CPU and NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti GPU, with the CPU being cooled by the high-end EK AIO Elite 360mm D-RGB liquid cooler that can tame any CPU on the market. You\u2019ve also got 32GB of dual-channel DDR5 memory working at a snappy 6000 MT/s, an excellent motherboard choice in the form of the ASUS TUF Gaming B650M, a 750W Lian-Li SFX PSU, a 2TB TeamGroup PCIe 4.0 M.2 SSD, and one of the best SFX cases around, the Lian-Li 011D Mini. The PC also packs six RGB fans for increased airflow and a three-year manufacturer warranty.\nThe components used here are top-notch and worthy of any custom SFX PC. In fact, we have zero issues with the components used here. The chassis is perfect for any future upgrade, the 750W SFX PSU is one of the most powerful small form factor power supplies you can get, and the flagship 360mm AIO should be enough to cool down any future CPU you might replace the Ryzen 5 7600X with.\nThe CPU and GPU combo should allow for a high refresh rate 1440p gaming with zero compromises. You should also be able to play any AAA title in 4K if you turn down visuals from ultra to high. Overall, this is a fantastic pre-built SFX gaming PC, with its biggest downside being that it\u2019s on the larger side compared to other SFX PCs.\nIf you're looking for something more compact, the Chronos V3 from Origin PC looks stunning, comes with decent base specs, and can be tweaked to your liking if you don\u2019t like the default configuration. If you like the EK 150 Battle but it's out of your budget, the EK 145 BATTLE is a more affordable version of the EK 150 Battle, featuring the RTX 4070 instead of the RTX 4070 Ti.\nEK 150 BATTLE\nEKWB made zero compromises regarding parts that went into the EK 150 Battle pre-built PC. The PC features top-notch components, a CPU and GPU combo capable of 1440p and 4K gaming, one of the best SFX cases on the market, a superb CPU cooling solution, and lots of high-end RGB case fans.\nFAQ\nAre pre-built PCs any good?\nSome aren\u2019t, while others are.
