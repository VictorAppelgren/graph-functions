  "description": "Jerry Adler, an actor known for his role as Hesh Rabkin on \"The Sopranos,\" has died at 96. The star became an actor in his 60s after directing theater",
  "content": "Jerry Adler, who found a later-in-life second career as an actor and landed a memorable role on \"The Sopranos,\" has died. He was 96.\n\nA representative confirmed to USA TODAY on Sunday, Aug. 24, that the actor \"passed peacefully in his sleep.\" He is survived by his four daughters.\n\nAdler starred as Herman \"Hesh\" Rabkin, an adviser to Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), on \"The Sopranos.\" He debuted in the role in the acclaimed HBO series' first episode in 1999 and continued playing the character through the final season.\n\nAdler previously worked as a stage manager and theater director, but he didn't have his first acting role until he was in his 60s and appeared on the sitcom \"Brooklyn Bridge\" in 1991.\n\nIn his 2024 memoir \"Too Funny for Words,\" Adler explained that he was recruited for the role by Julia Louis-Dreyfus' husband Brad Hall, who \"stopped me one day\" and asked if he was an actor.\n\n\"I told him who I was, and he explained he was doing a pilot called 'Brooklyn Bridge' and he needed one more character for it,\" he wrote in the book.\n\n\"It consisted of four guys playing cards around a table and I wouldn't have more than a couple of lines to learn. The whole thing would be done over the weekend when everyone was available. I agreed, thought it would be interesting, and since my weekend was free, I did it. It was my first acting assignment in what would become a second career.\"\n\nAdler went on to act in shows like \"Quantum Leap\" and \"Northern Exposure,\" the latter of which was produced by David Chase, who would later create \"The Sopranos.\" In his book, Adler said Chase called and asked him to play a part in the \"Sopranos\" pilot that was initially described as a cameo.\n\nAdler also appeared in movies like \"Synecdoche, New York,\" \"The Angriest Man in Brooklyn\" and \"A Most Violent Year,\" and he had a recurring role as Howard Lyman on \"The Good Wife\" and its spinoff \"The Good Fight.\" His other television credits include \"Mad About You,\" \"Raising Dad\" and \"Transparent.\"\n\nIn a tribute on X, \"The Good Wife\" creator Robert King recalled that Adler was only meant to be in one episode of the show but was \"so funny\" that he was brought back for more. \"One of our favorite collaborators,\" King added.",

      "text": "'Sopranos' doc reveals 'truth' about the ending, 'painful' moments for James Gandolfini\nNEW YORK \u2013 Seventeen years later, the debate around \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d finale goes on (and on and on and on).\nIn \u201cWise Guy,\u201d a new documentary that premiered at Tribeca Festival late Thursday night, series creator David Chase continues to stir the pot about the HBO drama\u2019s famously ambiguous ending.\nIn the last section of the doc, Chase breaks down the finale at length. He was heavily inspired by the end of Stanley Kubrick\u2019s 1968 masterpiece \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey\u201d and how astronaut Dave Bowman (Keir Dullea) encounters different ages of himself. Chase attempts to mirror that with New Jersey mobster Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini), who throughout the episode, continually walks into his own POV shots.\n\u201cIt makes me think of death,\u201d Chase says in the documentary. \u201cThere\u2019s something mesmerizing about it.\u201d\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus shares memories of 'extraordinary' James Gandolfini, 10 years after his death\nDespite pushback from the writers\u2019 room, Chase chose Journey\u2019s 1981 anthem \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019\u201d as the final song because of its lyrics. (\u201cYou may not go on, but the universe does,\u201d he explains.) He initially envisioned the ending as an inverse of the opening credits: Tony driving through the Lincoln Tunnel into Manhattan, where he heads to a meeting that \u201cdoesn\u2019t go well.\u201d\nBut he eventually landed on the scene at Holsten\u2019s diner, where Tony meets wife Carmela (Edie Falco) and son A.J. (Robert Iler). As the music plays and daughter Meadow (Jamie-Lynn Sigler) struggles to parallel park outside, a man glances at Tony and goes into the bathroom. Like in \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d does he grab a gun and shoot Tony? Or does Meadow simply walk into the restaurant, where they all proceed to have a nice family dinner?\nDavid Chase reveals 'truth' about 'The Sopranos' ending (or does he?)\nAs we all know, the screen cuts to black at the last second, giving the audience no easy closure. In \u201cWise Guy,\u201d the cast says they had no idea how the show was going to end before it aired. Even Gandolfini was left confused: Lorraine Bracco, who plays therapist Dr. Melfi, watched the episode with him and said \u201che was in shock.\u201d\nChase says the ending is whatever viewers want it to be. (And frankly, isn\u2019t it boring when everything gets neatly wrapped up?) But then, he mischievously references an early \"Sopranos\" episode, in which Meadow helps A.J. with his homework. Attempting to interpret a Robert Frost poem, A.J. asks her, \u201cI thought black meant death?\u201d\nSo does that mean Chase telegraphed the series finale all the way back in Season 3? \u201cPeople will say, \u2018There! He admitted that Tony died!\u2019\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201cThe truth is\u2026,\u201d he begins, before the documentary cuts to black and the end credits roll.\nJames Gandolfini had to go 'painful' places to play Tony Soprano\nFor \u201cSopranos\u201d devotees, the greatest joy of \u201cWise Guy\u201d is the sheer amount of behind-the-scenes footage. We get to see audition tapes from nearly every cast member, including fan favorites Michael Imperioli (Christopher), Drea de Matteo (Adriana) and Nancy Marchand (Livia). There\u2019s even a clip of Steven Van Zandt auditioning to play Tony before Chase wrote him the role of right-hand man Silvio.\nMany of the doc\u2019s revelations will be familiar to longtime fans: how de Matteo landed her part by the drawn-out way she said \u201cow,\u201d or how Chase initially envisioned \u201cSopranos\u201d as a feature film starring Robert De Niro and Anne Bancroft. Matthew Weiner also got hired as a writer after sending Chase his unproduced script for a little series now known as \u201cMad Men.\u201d\nBut the documentary\u2019s most moving section is devoted to Gandolfini, who died of a heart attack in 2013 at age 51, six years after \u201cSopranos\u201d ended its six-season run. The film unearths archival footage of Gandolfini goofing off between takes with Bracco, and details how he gave his castmates $30,000 each after he negotiated a significant pay raise. \u201cHe was a very good, kindhearted man,\u201d Falco recalls. But, she says, the role \u201cmay have taken a toll on him.\u201d\nTo portray Tony, \u201che had to go places that were destructive to him, and painful for him,\u201d Chase says. Before shooting Tony's more violent scenes, Gandolfini would purposefully deprive himself of sleep for days beforehand, or walk around with rocks in his shoes to get angry. He would bruise his hands hitting the inside of Tony\u2019s car, and allegedly threatened to quit the show nearly every other day.\nAccording to his co-stars, Gandolfini would often not show up to work if they stayed out late drinking together the night before. In the documentary, former HBO head Chris Albrecht says he once tried to stage an intervention, encouraging the actor to go to rehab. But when he realized what was happening, Gandolfini apparently yelled \u201cFire me!\u201d and walked out.\nThe cast gets emotional remembering Gandolfini, as well as late co-star Tony Sirico, who played Paulie and died in 2022. More than a dozen \u201cSopranos\u201d writers and actors reunited for a post-screening Q&A at the Beacon Theatre with director Alex Gibney, where they reiterated that they\u2019re still a family to this day.\nGrowing up on set, \u201cit was home,\u201d Sigler said tearfully. \u201cA lot of life happened in those 10 years. No matter what, that set was home and the people up here were home. They accepted you and loved you no matter what. It was a privilege and an honor, and it greatly shaped who I am today.\u201d\n\u201cWise Guy\u201d will be released by HBO later this year. Tribeca Festival runs through June 16."

      "text": "James Gandolfini: Much more than Tony Soprano\nSometimes, one blinding flash of brilliance is all we get.\nThat's seldom easy to accept, and never more so than with James Gandolfini, the Sopranos star who died unexpectedly Wednesday at the age of 51. This was a man whose talent and career seemed to be expanding, not contracting \u2014 a great actor who had added \"producer\" and \"documentarian\" to his skill set, and who was poised to make another run at TV stardom. To his fans, at least, this was not a man who was ready to fade to black.\nLife, however, had other plans for him and for us. We may never see his planned return to HBO in the miniseries Criminal Justice. We'll never know whether he had a follow-up in mind for his wonderful documentary Alive Day Memories: Home from Iraq, a thoughtful, movingly empathetic film that was a testament to his ability, and his desire, to set stardom aside.\nNot that Gandolfini ever came across as a star, either in interviews or on screen. That was part of his appeal. Shy and reserved with the press (witty when relaxed, brusque when pressed), on screen he projected a solidity that, depending on whether his eyes joined in or went cold when he smiled, could either be regular-guy inviting or thuggishly threatening.\nOr, in the case of Tony Soprano, a bit of both.\nFor six seasons in his landmark HBO drama The Sopranos, Gandolfini gave a performance that will forever be cherished as one of TV's best and honored as one of the medium's most difficult. TV abounds in flashy villains and damaged anti-heroes, but Tony Soprano was something else: a mundane, banal, unimaginative suburban husband and father with mother issues whose business ran on murder. To hold our interest playing a man like that, to make us root for him to succeed while fearing what he'll do next \u2014 that's a gift.\nBy dramatic necessity, Tony had to be crude and a brute, or he wouldn't come across as real to us. But there also had to be something else to him, a yearning for more \u2014 even if that \"more\" was simply a desire to hold on to his house and his pool \u2014 or we'd have no reason to keep watching. What Gandolfini brought to the role, so uncompromisingly written by creator David Chase, was the skill and the courageous willingness to show us all sides of Tony: the humanity that allowed us to sympathize with him, the brutality that kept us at arms length.\nIt was a role that required a bit of everything, and Gandolfini gave it everything. He was funny at times, horrifying at others, and always completely alive and present. Surrounded by one of the best casts TV has ever gathered, Gandolfini was never obscured.\nThere should have been more. We deserved more, and so did he. But if Tony is all we get, Tony must be enough."

      "text": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus rejects claims it's 'impossible' for comedians to be funny today\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus is continuing to reject complaints about the modern comedy landscape.\nThe \"Seinfeld\" star, 63, pushed back against the idea that comedians can't be funny today during an interview on Monday's episode of the \"On with Kara Swisher\" podcast.\n\"I personally don't buy the conceit that this is an impossible time to be funny,\" she said. \"Maybe some people aren't laughing at your jokes, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't be made.\"\nIn fact, Louis-Dreyfus argued it's a \"ripe time\" for comedy, adding, \"Comedy is risky, and it can be offensive, but that's what makes it so enjoyable \u2014 not that it's offensive, but that it's risky. It can be very truth-telling.\"\nLouis-Dreyfus' comments come after she recently told The New York Times that it's a red flag when comedians complain about political correctness ruining comedy.\n\"When I hear people starting to complain about political correctness \u2014 and I understand why people might push back on it \u2014 but to me that's a red flag, because it sometimes means something else,\" she said. \"I believe being aware of certain sensitivities is not a bad thing. I don't know how else to say it.\"\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus calls PC comedy complaints a 'red flag' after Jerry Seinfeld comments\nThat stance stood in contrast to that of her former \"Seinfeld\" co-star Jerry Seinfeld, who in April told The New Yorker that there is barely any comedy on television anymore because of \"the extreme left and PC crap, and people worrying so much about offending other people.\"\nSeinfeld also suggested some of the storylines from \"Seinfeld\" would not be allowed today.\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus is having her movie-star moment: 'I'm down for the ride and I'm digging it'\n\"We did an episode of the series in the '90s where Kramer decides to start a business of having homeless pull rickshaws because, as he says, they're outside anyway,\" the comedian said. \"Do you think I could get that episode on the air today?\"\nLouis-Dreyfus, though, told the NYT that \"political correctness, insofar as it equates to tolerance, is obviously fantastic,\" and the bigger threat to comedy is the \"consolidation of money and power\" and \"all this siloing of studios and outlets and streamers and distributors.\"\nShe expanded on this on the \"On with Kara Swisher\" podcast, saying she is \"worried about the corporatization of arts\" and concerned that A24 is \"one of the very few, if not the last,\" remaining independent studios making \"unusual\" films like her dramatic new movie \"Tuesday.\"\nLouis-Dreyfus starred as Elaine Benes on \"Seinfeld\" and later played Selina Meyer in the HBO political satire \"Veep,\" which aired from 2012 to 2019 and frequently shocked viewers with its edgy jokes.\nJulia Louis-Dreyfus has turned down hosting the Oscars 'a few times'\nMeanwhile, Louis-Dreyfus also appeared on the \"Happy Sad Confused\" podcast Monday and revealed she has turned down hosting the Oscars \"a few times,\" noting doing so would \"scare\" her.\n\"You have to really want to do it, and I don't really want to do it,\" the Emmy winner said. \"You have to go out there and be really just delighted to be hosting the Academy Awards, and I cannot say that I would have that feeling.\"\nShe added, \"No offense to everyone.\""

      "text": "'Good Wife' farewell: A ghost from the past\nSpoiler Alert: Details from the final episode of The Good Wife on CBS are included below. If you do not want to know what happened yet, please stop here.\nThe seventh and final season of the legal drama focusing on Chicago lawyer and political wife Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) saw the main character being haunted by her past and ending the episode nearly where it all started: at a press conference discussing criminal charges against her husband. For fans of The Good Wife, Sunday night's series finale was familiar.\nReports had started surfacing about the return of a favorite character: Will Gardner (Josh Charles) who was fatally wounded in a courtroom shooting in Season 5. And shortly into the show, as Alicia started to dream about the possibilities for her future, there he was.\nThat's right. As her husband Peter Florrick (Chris Noth) once again finds himself facing prison time and her lover Jason Crouse (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) plays the conflicted good guy patiently waiting in the wings, Alicia tries to imagine which man she would want to see at home at the end of the day. And well, the ghost of Will, the love of her life, shows up to complicate things. As Peter's trial for bribery, fraud and obstructing justice occupies much of the time of the series finale, Will occasionally visits Alicia to help her decide how to proceed with life.\nTurns out, the trial leading up to the press conference takes some twists and turns involving Alicia's partner, Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), and friend Lucca Quinn (Cush Jumbo), but that only leads to an ending that brings loyal fans right back to the series premiere in 2009 and realizing that perhaps, Alicia is a lot more like her husband than previously thought. And in fact, Peter's aide, Eli Gold (Alan Cumming) is paving the way for Alicia to succeed Peter in politics.\nIf fans remember when Alicia slapped Peter in the hallway after his press conference in the series premiere in 2009, they will compare that scene with a confrontation between Diane and Alicia in the finale. Both encounters came after betrayals.\nSeries creators Robert and Michelle King explain in a video interview released after the finale that ever important slap. \"We started with this feeling that it should begin with a slap and end with a slap,\" Robert says."

      "text": "'Sopranos' creator talks new documentary, why prequel movie wasn't a 'cash grab'\nWhat\u2019s there really left to say about \u201cThe Sopranos?\u201d\nHBO\u2019s six-season mob phenomenon, which signed off to polarizing fanfare in 2007, has been thoroughly dissected in books, interviews and podcasts for the last quarter century. So when the premium cable giant approached filmmaker Alex Gibney (\u201cTaxi to the Dark Side\u201d) about making a documentary, he decided to turn the lens on the series\u2019 soft-spoken creator, David Chase.\n\u201cI felt that story had never really been properly told before,\u201d Gibney says. \u201cI embarked on a sort of combo platter, which was to tell the origins of David Chase and \u2018The Sopranos.\u2019\u201d\nThe result is \u201cWise Guy\u201d (premiering Saturday at 8 EDT/PDT on HBO and streaming on Max), a three-hour documentary featuring interviews with the cast and creative team and new behind-the-scenes footage. The film begins in a spot-on recreation of the psychiatrist's office belonging to Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), who sparred with mobster Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) throughout the 21-time Emmy-winning drama. In an in-depth conversation with Gibney, Chase reflects on the ways his upbringing inspired the show, along with his initial vision for \u201cSopranos\u201d as a feature film.\n\u201cWhat excited me was the chance to work with Alex as a director,\u201d says Chase, 79. \u201cAt first, it was a little jarring just to be talking about oneself so much. But,\u201d he adds with a chuckle, \u201cI got into it.\u201d\n'Sopranos' doc reveals 'truth' about the ending, 'painful' moments for James Gandolfini\n'The Sopranos' documentary reveals the complexity of David Chase, James Gandolfini\n\u201cWise Guy\u201d doesn\u2019t shy away from some of the more unsavory aspects of the show\u2019s history. The documentary paints Chase as an exacting leader, who fired several writers after clashes in which he sought to maintain total creative control.\n\u201cI thought I was producing a series, and a man\u2019s gotta do what a man\u2019s gotta do,\u201d Chase says. But watching the film, \u201cI came away with an impression of myself as harder and more difficult than I thought; that I had a mean side, I suppose.\u201d\nA significant chunk of the documentary is also dedicated to Gandolfini, who struggled with drug and alcohol addiction as \u201cSopranos\u201d skyrocketed in popularity. The film reveals that he frequently didn\u2019t show up to work, and at one point, network executives began docking his pay and attempted to stage an intervention. The actor died of a heart attack in 2013, six years after the show ended, at age 51.\nGibney says he was constantly adjusting how much, or how little, to include of Gandolfini\u2019s personal battles. He did not consult with the actor\u2019s family about using footage of his funeral: \u201cI kept the editing pretty much to myself, including (from) David until we got to the very end.\u201d\nBut there are lighter moments, too. An early section of the documentary reveals newly unearthed audition tapes of the series\u2019 eventual stars Michael Imperioli, Drea de Matteo and Steven Van Zandt, along with Gandolfini and several familiar actors trying out for Tony who didn't make the cut.\nVan Zandt, a member of Bruce Springsteen\u2019s E Street Band, was \"surprising,\u201d Chase recalls. \u201cWhen he came in, not only was he much better than I expected, but he had done a lot of homework. I didn\u2019t realize how interested he was in the history of the mob.\u201d Although Chase says he seriously considered Van Zandt to play Tony, he eventually decided to create a new role for him as Tony\u2019s consigliere, Silvio Dante.\nChase unpacks many of the drama\u2019s most memorable moments in \u201cWise Guy,\u201d including Adriana\u2019s harrowing sendoff and that fiercely debated final shot. But there\u2019s plenty he couldn\u2019t touch on in the documentary: In a phone interview, he speaks fondly of Season 5 guest star Annette Bening, who figures prominently in Tony\u2019s subconscious. (\u201cWe heard she liked the show, and she was perfect,\u201d Chase says of her casting. \u201cI\u2019m surprised we got her.\u201d) He remembers \u201csmall\u201d but \u201cgreat\u201d turns from then-unknowns Lady Gaga, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Michael B. Jordan, all of whom appeared briefly in the series.\nHe also stands by the bizarre Columbus Day episode from Season 4, which most fans and critics agree is the show\u2019s worst. \u201cI think it got a fair shake,\u201d Chase says. \u201cAnd the more people it pissed off, the better I liked it!\u201d\nChase reflects on 'mistakes' of prequel movie 'Many Saints of Newark'\n\u201cWise Guy\u201d explores how, along with \u201cSex and the City,\u201d \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d was instrumental in HBO\u2019s evolution from a movie channel to a prestige TV behemoth. With its surreal dream sequences and meditative character study, \u201cSopranos\u201d also defied expectations of the shoot-\u2018em-up gangster genre.\nChase doesn\u2019t believe it could be made today: \u201cNetworks now wouldn\u2019t take a chance on \u2018Anne of Green Gables,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cForget it. I was lucky HBO was in the mood to make a change and make some trouble.\u201d\nFor a long time, Chase resisted the idea of a \u201cSopranos\u201d movie, wanting the legacy of the show to speak for itself. But he finally relented in 2021 with \u201cThe Many Saints of Newark,\u201d a prequel focused on Christopher's mob boss father, Dickie Moltisanti (Alessandro Nivola). Gandolfini\u2019s son, Michael, played a teenage version of Tony in the film, which received OK reviews but struggled at the box office.\n\u201cI made some mistakes in the conception phase and in the writing phase,\u201d Chase admits. \u201cBut the worst part was what the marketing department did. That wasn\u2019t supposed to be Tony Soprano\u2019s story \u2013 that was really a story about Dickie Moltisanti. We wanted to do a gangster movie, not an origin of this kid. So of course all the fans who flocked to see it were outraged, because it wasn't what the studio told them it was going to be.\n\u201cIt never recovered from that deception or lie or whatever you want to call it,\u201d he adds. \u201cI've read things about how it was all a cash grab for me, but it was no cash grab, I swear.\u201d\nAlthough Chase once expressed interest in another prequel tracking Tony in his 20s, he says he no longer wants to make that movie. Instead, he has two other film scripts he\u2019s trying to get cast and financed.\n\u201cMy desire is to do movies, not TV anymore,\u201d Chase says. \u201cI worked with really talented people, but I\u2019m getting older, and I really only want to make movies, which is the hardest thing to get going right now.\u201d\nThat \u201cSopranos\u201d has had such staying power, with a whole new legion of Gen Z fans, is \u201cmiraculous,\u201d Chase says. \u201cFor me, as somebody in show business, you couldn\u2019t ask for anything more.\u201d He wishes he could unlock the show\u2019s secret to success, but he also accepts that you can\u2019t make lightning strike twice.\n\u201cExcept for \u2018The Godfather 2,\u2019 so many sequels and prequels miss the mark because you\u2019re trying to repeat a mystery,\u201d Chase adds. \u201cGo ahead, try to do that again \u2013 it\u2019s really tough.\u201d"

      "text": "How 'The Good Fight' became the most explicitly anti-Trump TV series\nThe Good Fight is putting up a very distinct kind of fight this year.\nThe Good Wife spinoff, on the CBS All Access streaming service, wraps up a charged and intense second season with Sunday's finale. This year featured funerals, an unexpected pregnancy and a shooting in the offices of law firm Reddick, Boseman and Lockhart. Oh, and the firm competed for the chance to help impeach President Trump.\nThe legal drama always has been political: Last year's premiere opened with central character (and avowed liberal) Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski) reacting to Trump's inaugural address. And later episodes incorporated fictional tweets and actions of the president into its storyline.\nMore: 'The Good Fight' gears up for post-'Good Wife' battle\nBut Season 2's dance with the divisive political climate became more explicit and wild, as the firm competed to represent the Democratic National Committee's bid to impeach Trump, while discovering that a notorious tape was real.\nWe spoke to Fight creators Robert and Michelle King about how the series got so political, what's coming in Season 3 and whether they're worried about real tweets from the president.\nQuestion: Did you come into this year knowing it was going to be so specifically tied to Trump\u2019s real-life narrative?\nRobert King: No. Originally we thought the year would be about optimism and trying to find a way out of the thicket of politics. But when we all discussed it, we realized that wouldn't be true to Diane's character. Diane, a diehard liberal, would be going crazy this year. So we decided to make this season not so much about Trump as Diane's reaction to Trump. It's probably our most first-person season, because you're not sure if what you're seeing is reality or Diane's micro-dosing (drug use) reaction to reality.\nQ: How did the impeachment storyline come about?\nRobert: Originally, when we were looking for a story to take us through the whole season, we thought it could be Diane's firm being hired to prepare the Democratic committee for a potential impeachment trial of the president. But we became worried that there wouldn't be enough turns in the plot, and it would become earnest; that's how we hit on the \"Kill All Lawyers\" plot line (in which several Chicago lawyers were murdered by unhappy clients).\nWe did think the impeachment story would make a good episode. We were only worried that the story would come across like preaching to the choir. That's when (we) hit on the idea that the firm, in pursuing all the avenues toward impeachment, became more and more like the worst aspects of the president they wanted to throw out of office. That felt like a concept that could sustain a story.\nQ: What about the episode concerning a tape from the infamous dossier?\nRobert: That is a subject the two of us thought was funny \u2014 the dream pursuit of a \"golden shower\" tape to take down the president. It becomes this Indiana Jones-like search. It's this precious object to the left \u2014 this silver bullet \u2014 and we had no greater goal than to make fun of that.\nQ: Are you ever worried that Trump is going to see the show and tweet about it? You guys are streaming, so he can\u2019t come at you for your ratings.\nMichelle King: I worry about Trump doing any number of things. Tweeting about The Good Fight is not amongst them.\nQ: What do you hope the audience takes away from this season, whether they\u2019re liberal, conservative or independent?\nRobert: Fasten your seat belts. The right wing has gone insane. Now it's the left wing's turn. And people in the middle have to start talking with each other, or we're all going over the cliff.\nQ: We\u2019ve heard Roseanne Barr talk about making her character on ABC\u2019s revived Roseanne an outspoken Trump supporter because she felt that someone should represent that point of view on TV. Do you feel that the \u201cresistance\u201d needed representation as well?\nMichelle: I don't actually feel that the \"resistance\" needed representation on TV. My impression of scripted television is that it's either apolitical or vaguely liberal. We're not writing The Good Fight because there was a hole to fill. Instead, we're mainly following the characters. Diane was established as an ardent liberal when we began The Good Wife in 2009. We knew that she \u2014 as well as her colleagues at a Chicago African-American law firm \u2014 would have a strong opinion about the current administration. It felt like a lie not to dramatize that.\nQ: You had several ripped-from-the-headlines stories this year, including a dramatization of the Bachelor in Paradise controversy and a Me Too episode. Are there any news stories that you\u2019re dying to get Reddick, Boseman and Lockhart to jump in on?\nRobert: The Atlantic's firing of Kevin Williamson. Unfortunately, this is probably a trend for the future: the left and the right wanting to reinforce their bubbles. Also 13 Reasons Why and the romanticizing of suicide, for obvious reasons.\nQ: Is Season 3 going to be as political as the first two seasons?\nMichelle: Season 3 will not be as political as the first two seasons \u2014 assuming that politics stop being crazier than any time in recent memory. But if politics keep heading in the same direction, then, yeah probably Season 3 will have as much to say about it as Seasons 1 and 2."
