  "title": "EMEA Morning Briefing: Stock Futures Rise on Fed Cut Bets",
  "description": "",
  "content": "European stock futures pointed to a higher open Wednesday. Asian stock benchmarks rose; the dollar and Treasury yields were little changed; oil futures were flat; while gold edged higher.\n\nStock futures advanced early Wednesday after U.S. inflation data left investors more confident that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates to support a cooling labor market.\n\nInvestors were cheered by some of the report's details. In particular, goods inflation was lower than anticipated, suggesting little impact from President Trump's tariffs. Services inflation came in hot. But that was partly because of a jump in airfares-a volatile category that could look different in the Fed's preferred inflation gauge to be released later in the month.\n\n\"This was one of those reports where you kind of took away from it what you wanted,\" said Mark Hackett, chief market strategist at Nationwide.\n\nEuropean currencies were the big winner overnight from increased bets on Fed cuts, said DBS's Philip Wee.\n\n\"Interest rate differentials are expected to move against the USD because the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank are near the end of their easing cycles,\" he said.\n\nA warmer-than-expected July core-inflation reading did little to change traders' bets that the Fed will wind up resuming rate cuts in September. That kept Treasury yields mostly stable in Tuesday trading.\n\n\"For the Fed, the lack of a more alarming acceleration in price pressures removes an obstacle to lowering rates because of growing worries about a slowing labor market,\" Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital said. Tariff increases are showing up in some goods prices, he added, but less dramatically than many economists had feared.\n\nOil futures were flat early Wednesday, but could be weighed by the diminished likelihood of tougher sanctions against Russia. This Friday's meeting between Trump and Russian President Putin has raised hopes for a cease-fire in Ukraine and even a potential easing of sanctions, Commerzbank Research's Carsten Fritsch said.\n\nAlso, Trump is unlikely to impose secondary tariffs on other countries besides India for purchases of Russian oil before meeting with Putin, the commodity analyst added.\n\nU.S. inflation data released overnight has kept a Fed rate cut in play for September and underpins gold's appeal. \"Looking beyond the recent volatility brought about by the newsflow on tariffs, the overall positive outlook on gold remains intact,\" UBS Global Research's Joni Teves said.\n\n\"Looming rate cuts over the course of the year as U.S. economic data softens are supportive of higher gold prices ahead,\" the precious metals strategist added.\n\nU.S. headline CPI data missed estimates, which could boost base metals prices, said Sucden Financial. The U.S. dollar weakened after the news, as markets raised the probability of a September Federal Reserve rate cut to over 96%, it added. The base metals complex's thin summer liquidity may also contribute to lifting prices on the LME.\n\nIron ore futures are likely rising on expectations of further steel production cuts in China, ANZ said. Steel mills in northern China have reportedly been ordered to curb output to ensure clear skies during a military parade on Sept. 3.\n\n\"The steel industry remains highly sensitive to government-mandated controls on production,\" ANZ said. Such cuts usually raise steel prices and margins, causing the cost of inputs such as iron ore to rise.\n\nTrump Advisers Consider Changes to How Government Collects Jobs Data\n\nWASHINGTON-The Trump administration is considering changes to how the federal government collects and reports jobs data, according to White House officials, following President Trump's decision to fire the Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner earlier this month in the aftermath of weak employment numbers.\n\nIn a series of closed-door discussions in recent days, White House aides and Labor Department officials have weighed new options for data collection, as well as new technologies that could make the process more efficient. White House aides said one goal is to improve the response rates to BLS surveys.\n\nThe Stock Market Is Betting on Big Tech and Rate Cuts, Not the Economy\n\nThe S&P 500 hit a fresh high Tuesday, extending the benchmark's annual gain closer to 10% as investors added to bets on a near-term interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve following a well-received inflation report.\n\nDigging deeper into the July numbers, investors are also finding some evidence of stagflation risks in the world's biggest economy that could test the market's impressive rally heading into the autumn months.\n\nSwitzerland Asks Whether Its Famed Neutrality Is Fit for the Modern World\n\nPresident Trump's tariff policies have reordered global supply chains, redrawn investment maps and tested old alliances. In Switzerland, they have also spurred an uneasy audit of its role in the world.\n\nSwitzerland thrived as an honest broker and diplomatic powerhouse for centuries. The War of the Spanish Succession between France and the Holy Roman Empire finally ended in 1714 with a treaty signed in the small town of Baden. In 1872, an arbitration court in Geneva ordered the U.K. to pay the U.S. compensation for providing war ships to the Confederacy during the Civil War. It later played a role in setting navigation rights in the Black Sea and resolving conflicts from Indochina to Algeria.\n\nUkraine's Once Nimble Army Is Mired in Soviet Decision-Making\n\nSUMY, Ukraine - In the first year of Russia's all-out invasion, Ukraine's defenders repeatedly outmaneuvered a lumbering Russian army, relying on improvisation and the judgment of men in the field.\n\nThree years on, Ukraine's military has slipped back into a more rigid, top-down mode of fighting with roots in the Soviet era, creating mounting frustration about unnecessary casualties while hurting civilian morale and army recruitment. Without overhauls, the Soviet-style habits could undermine Ukraine's ability to sustain its defense against Russia, which shows no sign of relenting in its quest to conquer the country.\n\nTrump Calls on Goldman to Replace Economist Over Tariff Stance\n\nPresident Trump on Tuesday appeared to call for Goldman Sachs Chief Executive David Solomon to replace the bank's top economist over his past predictions, in his latest broadside against executives he believes are undermining his goals.\n\nTrump said on his Truth Social social-media platform that Solomon should \"go out and get himself a new Economist\" because the bank made a \"bad prediction a long time ago\" on the market and tariffs. The president asserted that tariffs haven't caused inflation or other issues for the U.S. economy.\n\nChina's ambition to turn its open-source artificial-intelligence models into a global standard has jolted American companies and policymakers, who fear U.S. models could be eclipsed and are mobilizing their responses to the threat.\n\nChinese advances in AI have come one after another this year, starting with the widely heralded DeepSeek and its R1 reasoning model in January. This was followed by Alibaba's Qwen and a flurry of others since July, with names such as Moonshot, Z.ai and MiniMax.\n\nAll times in GMT.
