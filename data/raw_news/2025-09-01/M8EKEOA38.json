  "description": "Beat the heat and tame your energy bill with these smart end-of-summer shortcuts.",
  "content": "Summer may be winding down, but the heat hasn't let up everywhere just yet. Across much of the US, late-season heat waves are keeping air conditioners running long after peak summer has passed. That relief comes at a cost, though. Nonstop cooling can send electricity bills soaring, and for many households, the expense can feel overwhelming.\n\nThe good news is there are smarter ways to stay comfortable without blowing your budget. Small changes around the house, from adjusting your thermostat wisely to blocking out hot air with weatherstripping, can add up to noticeable savings. Even something as simple as using ceiling fans effectively or setting up a smart plug can reduce the strain on your AC.\n\nBefore you resign yourself to another month of sky-high bills, try these expert-backed tips for keeping your home cooler through the last stretch of hot weather. A few easy adjustments now can help lower your costs and make the transition into fall a little easier.\n\nDon't miss any of CNET's unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome.\n\n1. Sign up for an energy audit\n\nIf your home isn't brand new, the cold air inside is probably seeping out through doors and windows with spotty seals, a poorly insulated attic and other locations of sneaky cracks.\n\nTo see how well your home is holding in the cold, sign up for a home energy audit with your utility provider or a local contractor. A certified home energy rater or auditor will check your home for leaks and recommend the best way to make your home more energy-efficient.\n\nDon't want to spring for an audit? You can do a DIY audit instead. Stand outside your home and run your hand around the windows and doors. Can you feel the cold air escaping? If you do, caulk around leaky windows and add insulation around doors.\n\nIf you haven't upgraded to a smart thermostat -- such as one by Ecobee or Nest -- it might be time to make a change. Smart thermostats can regulate heating and cooling when you're not home to save money. Plus, you can adjust the settings remotely using an app on your phone or via voice commands. Here's our list of the best smart thermostats to help you make the best decision for your home.\n\n3. Check the placement of your thermostat\n\nThermostat placement can play a big part in how well your air conditioner works. If you put the thermostat on a wall right next to a hot window, for instance, your air conditioner will kick on much more often than it needs to because your thermostat will think the room is hotter than it actually is. Here's how to pick the perfect wall for your thermostat and the ideal temperature you should set it to. You can also consider a smart thermostat that comes with extra room sensors, allowing it to keep track of the temperature throughout your home.\n\nA window letting in the hot sun won't just heat up your thermostat, it'll heat you up, too. During the warmest part of the day, close your blinds to keep out the sun. It can also help insulate your windows, which stops the cold air from escaping. There are also special insulating blinds, curtains and drapes that can keep your home even cooler.\n\nYou don't always need to amp up the AC to feel cooler. Using a ceiling fan can make a room feel cooler, enough that you can increase the thermostat temperature by 4 degrees \"with no reduction in comfort.\" If you want to get high-tech, you can install a smart ceiling fan that connects to an app and automatically adjusts based on schedules you create. Just make sure your fan is rotating counterclockwise in the summer to get the most benefit.\n\nTo save the most money, always set your thermostat to the highest temperature you can comfortably stand. A programmable thermostat makes it easy to keep your AC at the right temperature. You can program the unit to hold at higher temperatures while you're at work and cool down right before you get home.\n\nYou can save 10% a year on your cooling bills by setting your thermostat just 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit higher for 8 hours each day, according to the Nebraska Energy Office. The US Department of Energy recommends aiming for an indoor temperature of 78 degrees Fahrenheit when you're at home. If 78 degrees isn't doable for you, even a small change in temperature can knock your energy bill down by up to 3% annually.\n\nFor more energy savings, explore our home sustainability cheat sheet full of eco-friendly tips and read about how you can save money by unplugging certain appliances when not using them.\n\nMore money-saving hacks for your home\n\u2022 Tired of Sky-High Energy Bills?

      "text": "It might seem like energy costs skyrocketing is just a fact of life right now, but there are ways to take back control -- and you might be surprised at some of the changes you can make. It's no surprise that heating bills go up during the cooler months like fall and winter, but your thermostat might also be part of the reason. It isn't just about what temperature you set it to either. Where you install your thermostat makes a huge difference in how well it does its job. If it's too close to a window or in direct sunlight, your HVAC system might be working overtime because the temperature your thermostat measures isn't accurate.\nThe good news? Fixing it doesn't require an expensive upgrade. In fact, it won't cost you a penny. All you need to do is find a better spot for that thermostat. Whether you're installing a new smart thermostat or just want to double-check your current setup, placing it in the right location can help your system run more efficiently year-round. That means more consistent comfort, less wear on your equipment, and real savings on your electric bill, especially when your AC is running full blast.\nNever install a thermostat in these places\nWhen thinking about thermostat location, the most important thing is to avoid areas with temperature extremes, which can make your thermostat think the room is much hotter or cooler than it really is and adjust the temperature accordingly.\nAccording to the US Department of Energy, you should avoid installing your thermostat near windows or doors, heat sources or direct sunlight. You should also avoid putting lamps or TVs near your thermostat since they release heat that could impact the device settings.\nFor that reason, it's best to avoid placing the thermostat in bathrooms or kitchens, too, where steam from the shower or from cooking can interfere. The same goes for exterior walls, which are typically cooler than interior ones.\nPutting your thermostat in any of these less-than-ideal spots could force it into heating or cooling when it doesn't actually need to, unnecessarily using up more energy and money.\nYou should also avoid setting up your thermostat in hallways or rooms that you don't use often. The device will not read the temperature of the places you actually want to heat or cool and could leave you with the wrong setting.\nHere's where you should put a thermostat\nThe best spot for your thermostat is on an interior wall in the middle of a room you use often, such as your living room. That will keep the most popular areas of your house comfortable at the temperature you set.\nAnd if you have a smart thermostat, make sure it's not obstructed by doors, bookshelves or decorations so its sensors will work as they're meant to. You also need to make sure the smart thermostat is in range of your Wi-Fi to stay connected.\nIn some cases, you can move your thermostat yourself. But in others, you'll need to call an HVAC specialist. But that cost can potentially be recouped over time through savings.\nFor more money-saving tips, check out how Energy Star appliances can save you cash and the cheapest place to buy groceries online.\nFor more ways to reduce energy costs, consider unplugging your appliances, adjusting your thermostat, turning off your lights or buying smart devices. There's even an easy ceiling fan hack that can save money on heating or cooling your house."

      "text": "Summer's heat wave has us all shuffling to sit in front of the nearest fan. However, not everyone has central air conditioning and, even worse, installing a window unit can be a real hassle. But that's why you should consider investing in a portable air conditioner. The best portable AC units are easily moved and also extremely powerful, with smart assistant compatibility and even the ability to add dehumidification. Combine your AC with an air purifier to enhance air quality and ensure your home has clean, cool air circulating. To assist in narrowing your choices, we tested these popular models.\nWhat is the best overall portable air conditioner?\nWhether you need a portable AC for an apartment, a stuffy room or any other space, we\u2019ve tested top units in the CNET Testing Lab to find the best at cooling and maintaining comfort. But if you're looking for a straightforward answer, our newest pick, the Black+Decker BPP08WTB, is the best budget portable AC unit.\nRead more: Best Smart Home Gifts\nNot only did the Midea MAP14HS1TBL excel in performance compared with most portable air conditioners we tested, but it also has a lot of features and specialty options. This model isn't cheap, but it's a well-rounded luxury AC unit with everything you need -- and then some.\nTo start, the MAP14HS1TBL has the highest cooling capacity of any other model we tested. Those 12,000 BTUs come in handy for cooling larger spaces up to 550 square feet, and it showed in the performance. The Midea model beat out the two other larger AC units in this list, the Haier QPWA14YZMW and the LG LP1419IVSM, in both of our performance tests.\nThis model also comes with a standard remote control and has sleep mode, timer and dehumidifier functions, as well as an app and support for Alexa and Google Assistant voice commands.\nOverall, the Midea MAP14HS1TBL has all the premium features and options you'd expect for its price. Throw in its stellar performance and this unit is our top pick to cool larger spaces. Keep in mind that this air conditioner was also the heaviest unit we tested at 77 pounds, but like the rest, it comes with wheels for easy maneuvering.\nQuiet, powerful, compact and efficient. The Black+Decker BPP08WTB delivers power at a very competitive price, earning the title of best small portable AC unit.\nIn our temperature consistency test, it outperformed all other units, maintaining a set point of 68 degrees Fahrenheit with a score of 48.3%. No other small portable AC unit achieved this level of performance. This unit offers exceptional value.\nKey features include an easy-to-use LCD remote control with a \u201cfollow me\u201d function, allowing you to set the thermostat to your desired temperature from a distance. This unit is ideal for areas with high humidity, as it also functions as a dehumidifier, capable of removing up to 80 pints of moisture per day.\nThe Haier QPWA14YZMW is an excellent midpoint between the Black+Decker and Midea AC units. Its price sits in the middle of the best small and best high-end air conditioners, yet it offers similar specs and performance to the Midea model but without some of the advanced features.\nSpecifically, this Haier AC unit has a 9,700-Btu cooling capacity and can cool up to a 550-square-foot room. While its cooling capacity is lower than the 12,000-Btu Midea air conditioner, the Haier unit held its own during testing. It managed to maintain a 68-degree set temperature for over 75% of its running time (compared with the Midea's 85%). It also maintained its lowest temperature 70.9% of its running time, after the Midea's 80.1% and the Whirlpool's 73.5%.\nRegarding features, this unit has a remote control, timer and dehumidifier functions. It also has an app, but you won't have support for voice assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant.\nOverall, this Haier portable air conditioner performed well but cost less, and it has fewer features than the Midea AC unit. If you don't want all the extras of the Midea, the Haier QPWA14YZMW is a solid alternative at great value. If you don't need a portable air conditioner that can cool up to 550 square feet, look instead to a smaller unit.\nThe contenders\nWe tested 10 portable air conditioners for this best list (some of which are no longer featured): the Black+Decker BPP08WTB, the Black+Decker BPACT14WT, the Frigidaire FHPC082AC1, the GE APCD08JALW, the Haier QPWA14YZMW, the LG LP1419IVSM (Out of Stock), the Midea MAP10S1CWT, the Midea MAP14HS1TBL, the Whirlpool WHAP131BWC and the Whynter ARC-14S. In the chart below, you can get an overview of each unit and how they compare in terms of pricing, specs and features.\nAt a glance, you can see we tested some units with similar specs, while also covering a wide range of options. Not only do the prices vary from $310 to $699, but half of the units are designed to cool smaller 350-square-foot rooms, while the rest can handle larger spaces up to 500 or 550 square feet. They also vary in terms of BTU, which ranges in the units we tested from 5,500 to 12,000 BTU.\nIt's worth noting here that there are currently two different standards for determining BTU capacity: the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers' BTU rating and the Department of Energy's Seasonally Adjusted Cooling Capacity Btu rating. For that reason, many manufacturer sites list both the Ashrae and the SACC ratings in their specs.\nFor example, the Frigidaire FHPC082AC1 we tested has an Ashrae capacity of 8,000 BTU, while the DOE's SACC rating for the same unit is 5,500 BTU. The SACC standard was developed more recently and is being broadly adopted across manufacturers, so we use the SACC Btu capacity as the default standard anywhere we reference Btu capacity in this list. Still have questions about this? Learn more about the SACC standard here (PDF).\nHow we test\nTo test portable air conditioners, we heat a climate-controlled room to 92 degrees. After the room reaches 92 degrees, we turn off the heat and turn on the portable AC unit to cool mode, with a medium fan speed and a set temperature of 68 degrees. We run the unit for 2 hours and 30 minutes and repeat the same test twice per AC unit. We then use the data collected during the tests to measure two things:\n- How consistently the portable air conditioner keeps the room within 5% of 68 degrees\n- How consistently it kept the room within 5% of the AC unit's individual lowest temperature\nOnce we have this information, we compare the results across the units to see which ones maintained the set temperature for the longest period of time. We also look at which units maintained their individual lowest temperature for the longest time. We did this so that if a unit didn't reach 68 degrees in the allotted time, we were still able to track how consistently it maintained the lowest temperature it achieved. The higher the percentage, the better the unit performed.\nWhen looking at performance, it's important to note that the units we tested don't have identical specs, so direct performance comparisons aren't the only thing we consider when arriving at our list of best portable air conditioners. We also look at a unit's features and other options in reference to its price and specifications to determine its overall value.\nWe also don't draw direct performance comparisons when looking at units of vastly different sizes and capabilities, say, the 12,000-BTU Midea MAP14HS1TBL versus the 5,500-BTU Frigidaire FHPC082AC1. For this reason, we compared performance results in two groups based on coverage area. Specifically, we compared the smaller Midea, Black+Decker, Frigidaire, Whirlpool and GE models (which all have coverage areas of up to 350 square feet) against each other and the larger Black+Decker, Whynter, Haier, LG and Midea models (which have 500-to-550-square-foot coverage areas) against one another.\nPerformance\nDelving a little more into performance, you can see how long all 10 portable air conditioners maintained a temperature set point of 68 degrees. Because we're not comparing the larger units directly with the smaller ones, we've displayed the two groups in separate charts.\nThe Midea air conditioner performed the best, maintaining the 68-degree set point for 85.4% of its runtime. The Haier model came in second with 75.5% and the LG model in third with 74.2%. For the smaller units, the Black+Decker came in at 48.3%, followed by the GE at 39.7% and the Whirlpool model at 25.2%.\nFor the second test, we looked at how consistently the unit maintained its lowest temperature. The Midea air conditioner once again outperformed the other large units by maintaining its lowest temperature for 80.1% of its runtime. The LG model came in second with 73.5% and the Haier model in a close third with 70.9%. For the smaller units, the GE model performed extremely well, closely trailing the larger Haier air conditioner at 68.9%. The Midea model wasn't far behind, at 66.2%, followed by the Frigidaire model at 57%.\nIn addition, we made charts to track the temperature changes of each unit over time. In the chart representing the larger units, the Midea unit's temperature dropped more quickly than the others and maintained the lower temperature for most of its run. For the smaller units, the Black+Decker unit dropped the temperature more quickly, held the lead for much of its run, and cooled to a lower final temperature.\nPortable air conditioner FAQs\nYes. Air conditioners work by absorbing thermal energy -- heat -- from inside and transferring it outside through coils full of refrigerant. Venting through the window gives that heat somewhere to go that isn\u2019t inside your home, the space you\u2019re trying to cool.\n\",\"quickTake\":\"\",\"canCollapse\":\"true\",\"collapseOnPageLoad\":\"false\",\"canTruncate\":\"true\",\"truncateOnPageLoad\":\"false\"},{\"question\":\"How do portable AC units work?\",\"answer\":\"These devices might look more like an air purifier than an air conditioner, but they work similarly to a window unit. They\u2019ll probably contain a water basin, like a dehumidifier, since they serve that purpose as well. A single-hose unit will use a condenser to cool the air inside and then vent the heat outside through a hose mounted into the window.

      "text": "As we approach the start of summer, the Northeast is experiencing its first heat wave. High temperatures are expected to soar beyond 90s and get up to the 100s. As people around the world adjust to this summer's stifling heat wave and take steps to protect their health, or avoid the heat entirely, folks whose jobs keep them outside (or inside in an overheated room) may be at a higher risk of heat illness, including heatstroke.\nIn the US, heat is the biggest killer when it comes to environmental effects on health. Someone's health, mobility or age can influence how they respond to heat, but people who work in construction, agricultural or other jobs outside have always had a higher risk of heat illness -- the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 436 people have died from heat exposure at work since 2011.\nBut the demand for food, construction and more doesn't stop when extreme heat kicks in. If your job places you at higher risk of heat illness, outdoors or indoors, here's what to know and tips for staying healthy.\nHow hot is too hot to work?\nThere is no exact number or federal standard for how hot it has to be to be \"too hot\" to work, though more specific federal guidelines for working in the heat have been in the works for a couple of years.\nFollowing summer 2023's announcement by the Biden administration, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration may \"intensity its enforcement\" of heat safety in industries like construction and agriculture. In the past, OSHA has cited employers \"under the general duty clause for heat stress violations,\" according to the Venable law firm.\nBut states and cities can also make their own rules for worker safety: Check the map for OSHA-approved worker health plans. As the Wall Street Journal reports, states including California, Oregon, Washington, Colorado and Minnesota have rules requiring businesses to provide things like regular breaks and free water access. Texas, according to the WSJ, has a rule taking effect in September that will ban cities like Austin and Dallas from mandating their own regulations for heat within businesses.\nIn general, whether heat is harmful to the human body, or when heat becomes a hazard at work, depends on a combination of factors in addition to the actual number of degrees Fahrenheit the temperature hits, according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. It's these combinations of factors that contribute to heat, and risk of heat illness or stress, that OSHA requires workplaces to consider when managing worker safety.\nThese factors can be boiled down to sources of heat-related illness in the workplace: environmental heat (such as the temperature, humidity or whether there's airflow or wind) and metabolic heat (getting hot because of your workload or the physical labor you're doing).\nThis means the length of time it's safe for you to be at work on extremely hot days -- or whether it's safe at all -- will depend on things like how much you're doing physically, the clothes or gear you have to wear to do your job and whether you have access to frequent shade and water breaks. Importantly, it also depends on whether you've been \"acclimatized\" to the heat, which the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention describes as gradually building up a tolerance to working in the heat over a period of a couple weeks. According to OSHA, most outdoor deaths occur during the first few days of someone working in hot weather because their body needs time to build up a tolerance.\nAs part of its explanation for how hot \"too hot\" is, OSHA recommends workplaces take heat stress level into account based on wet bulb globe temperature markers, which takes into account things like temperature, humidity, wind speed and sunlight. Heat index, which is what we typically see when looking at heat advisories, is actually a reading based in the shade, according to the National Weather Service.\nThe signs of heat illness and when to get out of the heat\nHeat exhaustion and heatstroke are what we think of when it comes to heat illness. Heat exhaustion typically comes before heatstoke, but not always. Some symptoms of heat exhaustion, per the CDC, include: heavy sweating, nausea, cold and clammy skin, muscle cramps, tiredness or weakness and a fast pulse. If you're experiencing these signs of heat exhaustion at work, it's important you working and cool down as soon as possible. Get to the shade or indoors, drink water and loosen your clothes, per the CDC.\nHeatstroke is a medical emergency and can lead to death if someone doesn't get help. While some symptoms of heatstroke overlap with heat exhaustion, like headache and nausea, heatstroke will overheat a person's body (103 degree temperature or higher) and can cause them to lose consciousness or start acting confused. If you or someone you're working with may be experiencing heat stroke, call 9-1-1.\nWhile you wait for medical services to arrive, get the overheated person to shade and cool them down by any means: Put cold towels on their skin, pour cold water on them and loosen or take off parts of their clothing. The CDC doesn't recommended you give someone with heatstroke anything to drink, since they may be unconscious or unable to swallow, which makes it a choking hazard. If they're conscious and responsive, however, the Mayo Clinic recommends giving them small sips of water while waiting for emergency services to get there.\nTips for staying safe when working in hot weather\nEven if your workplace doesn't require breaks or automatically provide framework to reduce the risk of heat illness, there are things you can do to reduce your risk.\nWear the right clothes: Try to wear less clothing or clothing that's breathable, loose fitting and light-colored (lighter colors absorb less sunlight). Read all about clothes that can help keep you cool.\nStay hydrated: You should be drinking water frequently throughout the day, preferably before you become thirsty, according to a heat illness info sheet for employers from OSHA and the National Institute for Public Safety and Health. Some reusable water bottles can help keep water cool for longer, if your work doesn't have a nearby water station with cold water.\nA good way to check you're drinking enough is to monitor the color of your urine: It should be light-colored or nearly clear when you're adequately hydrated, according to the fact sheet. If you want to get some added hydration through food during your lunch break or snacks (eating may help you stave off things like lightheadedness, too), consider eating these hydrating foods.\nCheck your medications and know your individual health risks: Older adults and people with underlying health conditions, including common ones like heart disease and diabetes, can be more susceptible to heat illness. Medications people take to manage health conditions also may make it harder for someone's body to regulate temperature, so check in with your doctor or pharmacist if you take daily medication but also work in high heat.\nConsider your individual workload risk: The more physical activity you're doing at work, the hotter your body will be, and the higher your risk for heat illness is. The same goes for clothing (more clothing equals higher body heat and higher risk) air flow (less air flow means higher risk), and the list goes on."

      "text": "Autumn is almost here, and along with dropping temperatures you may see your electricity bill free fall once you turn off the AC. However, temperature alone isn't the best way to lower your utility bills. This CNET survey found that 78% of US adults are stressed about the cost of home energy use. If you've been trying to figure out the best way to save money and keep to your budget, you're not alone.\nThe good news is that there are simple, expert-backed strategies that can help cut those expenses without sacrificing comfort. By making a few small changes, you can lower your monthly costs and keep your home running more efficiently year-round.\nThere are plenty of ways you can still save on gas, electricity and water in the coming months. Even small habits, like unplugging unused appliances, washing your clothes a different way, cooking with some energy-saving appliances or setting your thermostat to the right temperature can help save money and make your home more energy-efficient.\nDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome.\nHere are eight steps you can take to start saving electricity, gas, water -- and cash. For additional money-saving tips, check out more on how to weatherstrip your home to save on bills and a simple home upgrade that can help you save on summer cooling costs.\n1. Get an electricity audit\nMany electric companies offer a free audit, where they do a room-by-room examination of your home and look at your electricity bills to help determine where you're wasting energy. You can follow the recommendations to help reduce your electric bill. If you can't get an audit for free, you might still be able to qualify it under the energy efficient home improvement credit and recoup the costs during tax season.\nEven if your electric company doesn't provide this service, you can easily perform a DIY home energy audit using the US Department of Energy website's instructions.\n2. Adjust your thermostat\nOne of the simplest ways to reduce your electricity bill is to adjust your thermostat. According to the Department of Energy, you can save as much as 10% on your heating and cooling costs by adjusting your thermostat by 7 to 10 degrees for 8 hours per day. In other words, keep it a bit warmer in the summer and a bit cooler in the winter.\nA simple way to do this is to adjust your thermostat when you're either asleep or away from home. If you have a smart thermostat, you can preset your thermostat to adjust during these hours so you don't forget.\n3. Turn down your water heater\nMany water heater manufacturers set thermostats at 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 C). But in reality, most households only need it set at a maximum of 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Setting your water heater to a lower temperature can save hundreds of dollars a year.\nAdjusting a water heater's temperature is a quick and easy fix. The thermostat dial on your water heater is likely near the bottom of the tank on the electric or gas control valve. Be sure to check the owner's manual for instructions to adjust it -- and if you have any questions, consult a professional technician.\n4. Turn off and unplug what you aren't using\nBy leaving things around your house plugged in and turned on when you aren't using them, you're driving up your electric bill unnecessarily.\nYou can start by turning off lights when you aren't in the room or when it's light enough outside to rely solely on natural light. Multiply your light bulb's wattage by what your electricity provider charges per kilowatt to find out how much you're saving. That amount only increases with the wattage of the bulb. While it doesn't seem like much, it can add up over time.\nYou can also save money by unplugging appliances you aren't using. Phantom energy, the energy your appliances use when they're plugged in but not turned on, can cost an average of $100 per year.\n5. Use your dishwasher\nIt might sound counterintuitive to suggest running an appliance to save on your electricity bill. And yes, there was a time where dishwashers used far more water than they do today. But the Department of Energy regulates how much water modern dishwashers can use. Any dishwasher manufactured since 2013 is limited to using 5 gallons of water. If it's a compact size dishwasher, it's limited to 3.5 gallons.\nYou might think that surely you use less than 5 gallons of water to hand-wash your dishes. But the US Geological Survey estimates that it takes anywhere from 9 to 27 gallons of water to hand-wash a load of dishes. (If you're curious, we've also got a tip on how to load your dishwasher the right way.)\n6. Take advantage of off-peak rates\nElectricity use tends to be higher during certain times of the day and the year. First, demand is higher in the winter and summer when people are running heaters and air conditioners. It's also higher during the daytime and evening hours.\nSome electricity companies offer time-of-use plans, increasing rates during peak hours and decreasing them during off-peak hours. If you have one of these plans, you can save money by running large appliances like your dishwasher and washing machine early in the morning or late at night.\n7. Change your air filters\nYour air filter helps to catch any dirt, dust, pet hair and more, preventing it from making its way into your HVAC. When you don't change your air filters regularly enough, this debris gets into your HVAC system and bogs it down, reducing its efficiency. According to the Department of Energy, replacing your filters on schedule can lower your air conditioner's energy consumption by anywhere from 5% to 15%.\n8. More ways to save on your bills\nThere are many steps, big and small, that you can take to reduce your consumption and save money on your bills. The Department of Energy has an entire section of its website devoted to providing tips to help you save on energy. And while plenty of them come with a price tag, there are many more just like those on this list that you can do for free.\nFor more, check out the ceiling fan trick that can help your house stay cooler, and you can also explore our solar cheat sheet.\nMore energy and money saving tips\n- Want to Save Money?

      "text": "This summer has been brutal, with record-breaking heatwaves across the US, and heat domes that have sent the temperature rocketing up into three digits as far north as Connecticut. If your AC has been running nonstop, you might be dealing with some sticker shock at the size of your energy bill. However, there is an easy way to keep your home cooler with the help of a ceiling fan.\nA ceiling fan can make a room feel up to 4 degrees cooler, so you can dial back your air conditioning without sacrificing comfort. All it takes is flipping a switch to ensure it's spinning in the right direction (counterclockwise for summer), and you're on your way to better airflow and lower energy costs.\nIt's one of the easiest ways to beat the heat without raising your utility bill -- no fancy tech or major upgrades are required. Bonus: It's a small move that can shrink your environmental footprint.\nTake a moment to flip this hidden setting on your ceiling fan. You'll stay comfortable all season long and keep your energy bills in check.\nFor more on saving money on energy, learn how unplugging some appliances can save you $100 a year and the most efficient temperature for your thermostat this summer.\nHow to change the direction of your ceiling fan\nChanging the direction of your ceiling fan's rotation is simple. It's usually controlled by a sliding switch on the motor housing. This switch lets you adjust the fan from spinning clockwise to counterclockwise.\nBefore you make any changes, turn off your ceiling fan -- you don't want to hurt yourself or anyone else in your home. Look for the small sliding switch on the side of the fan's motor housing. It should be labeled with markings like \"Forward/Reverse\" or have arrows pointing in opposite directions.\nTo switch rotation to counterclockwise, slide the switch to Forward or Counterclockwise. For clockwise rotation, slide the same directional switch to Reverse or Counterclockwise. The fan blades will start to push air upward to recirculate warmer air.\nIf there's no switch on your ceiling fan, you may have a remote control that can change the direction with the push of a button. And if you've got a smart fan, you can probably change direction with your voice or by using an app. You may need to check your instruction manual for further help.\nSet your ceiling fan to counterclockwise in the summer\nDuring the summer, you'll want your ceiling fan to rotate counterclockwise, blowing cooler air straight down into the room. Just make sure the fins on your fan blades are tilted downward to help push the air toward the floor. You should feel the air in the room start to get cooler.\nSwitch your ceiling fan back to clockwise in the winter\nIn winter, you'll want your ceiling fan to rotate clockwise. The airflow will then be directed upward, circulating hot air from the ceiling back down into the room to help spread warmth.\nOther tips for making the most of your ceiling fans\nIf you want to reap even more benefits from your ceiling fans, choose the right fan. According to the Department of Energy, you should look for fans with the Energy Star label, as they're around 60% more efficient than conventional fans.\nYou'll also want to ensure the fan you're using is the correct size for your room. Larger rooms may need bigger fans with blade spans of at least 52 inches or more, while smaller rooms can get by using fans of 36 inches.\nIf changing your fan blades' direction becomes a pain, you might consider installing a ceiling fan with a remote control or implementing a smart switch. This makes it easier to change the fan direction and speed without reaching up, using a ladder, or fumbling around for the switch to push. The easier it is to change the fan blades' rotation, the easier it is for you to be cooler or warmer in uncomfortable temperatures."

      "text": "When the summer heat kicks in, turning up the air conditioner is an easy choice, but the comfort comes at a cost. With electricity prices climbing and inflation stretching budgets, a recent CNET survey found that almost 80% of Americans feel stressed by high energy bills. The good news is you can stay cool without spending as much.\nOne of the simplest ways to use less energy is also one of the easiest to forget. Turning off the lights when you leave a room cuts down on heat from bulbs, which means your air conditioner doesn't have to work as hard. Over the course of a summer, that small change can make a real difference on your bill.\nPair that habit with other smart moves like closing blinds during the hottest part of the day, running ceiling fans the right way, and unplugging electronics you're not using. With a few small adjustments, you can keep your home cooler and reduce your energy costs without sacrificing comfort.\nWhy should you turn off the lights?\nYou've probably been told repeatedly about the importance of conserving energy, but you might be wondering why it's so important.\nFirst, reducing your energy usage by turning off your lights is an excellent way to reduce your carbon footprint. Electricity generation is one of the biggest sources of carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. By turning off your lights when you aren't using them, you can do your part to reduce carbon emissions and therefore help the environment.\nSecond, reducing your home's energy usage doesn't just help the environment. It also helps your wallet. Turning off lights when you don't need them can help reduce your electricity bills. You'll also extend the life of your light bulbs, which will save you money as well.\nBuying a smart lightbulb can help you conserve energy by setting your lights to go on and off at certain times, so no more falling asleep with all the lights left on overnight. The Wiz tunable white LED smart bulb is CNET's pick for the best white-light smart bulb.\nHow much money can you save?\nThe amount you can save on your electricity bill by turning off your lights depends on the type of light bulb you use. You can figure your potential savings using the light bulb's wattage.\nLet's say you have a light bulb that's 40 watts, meaning in one hour, the bulb will use 0.04 kWh. Then, you can use your electricity price \u2014 which you can find on your most recent utility bill \u2014 to figure out how much you'll save for that hour. In the case of the 40-watt bulb, if you pay an electricity rate of 10 cents per kWh, your savings by turning that bulb off for one hour would be 0.4 cents.\nIt's easy to see that number and think it's simply not worth it to turn off your lights more often. After all, what difference does 0.4 cents make? First, remember that the estimate is for a 40-watt bulb. If you have higher-wattage light bulbs, the savings will be greater. Next, that estimate uses an energy price of 10 cents per kWh, but in many areas, the price of electricity may be higher than that.\nFinally, our estimate looked at the savings of turning off one bulb for one hour. You likely have many light bulbs in your house, and there are far more than just one hour in a month. So when you calculate the savings of turning off all of your light bulbs for many more hours per month, your savings will increase significantly.\nWhen should you turn off the lights?\nYou can save money by turning off your lights and fans whenever you don't need them. During the spring and summer, it's a good idea to check in on the peak and off-peak energy hours in your area. Many providers use a time-of-use electricity plan where energy costs rise during peak hours, or hours where the grid is facing higher demand, and lower during off-peak hours. These hours change depending on the seasons, so transitioning between seasons is a good time to check when you're paying the most for energy.\nDuring peak hours, usually during the afternoons in the summer, while in the early morning and in the evenings after sunset during winter, it's helpful to be especially diligent in turning off lights and other electronic appliances when you leave a room to cut down on your energy bill. During the spring and summer, daylight saving time is in effect, which means more daylight and less need to have the lights on in your home.\nA small change can yield big savings\nTurning off the lights and other electric appliances when you aren't using them is one of the most basic steps you can take to reduce your energy usage and save money on your electricity bill. Even a small change can add up to big energy savings and help reduce your carbon footprint.\nMore money-saving tips for you\n- Energy Star Appliances: Can They Really Save You Money?\n- Change Your Water Heater's Set Temperature and Save Money\n- Can You Actually Save Money by Showering Instead of Bathing?\n- How to Lower Your Air Conditioning Bill While You're on Vacation\n- Your Fan Is Probably in the Wrong Place (and Room Temperatures Suffer)\n- The Best Energy-Saving Smart Home Devices to Help You Save on Utility Bills\n- Energy Vampires: What They Are and Why Unplugging Them Can Save You Money"

      "text": "Summer might not technically be here for a few more weeks but with temperatures already soaring, you might be looking for a way to keep cool at home. As weather patterns continue to change, blackouts are becoming more common and rising energy costs are making it harder than ever to stay cool during heatwaves.\nIf you're looking for a good way to bring the temperature down inside without blowing your budget this summer, there's a long-term option you may not have considered. Buying window treatments and fabrics is a great way to boost your household's energy efficiency significantly by lowering your energy costs. Based on a recent Reddit thread on the topic, users are speaking highly on using attachments such as thermal and blackout curtains to help reduce electricity bills.\nAn energy-efficient home keeps you comfortable, uses far less energy and saves money. There are many ways to improve your home's efficiency. You can start with simple actions, such as turning off the lights when you leave a room. For bigger changes, you might consider installing solar panels. However, you might be missing one of the easiest and most effective ways to save energy.\nThe right window treatments (also known as window attachments) can make a big difference in boosting your energy efficiency. These attachments are curtains, blinds, awnings and shades. They work well in keeping you cooler in the warmer months and warmer in the cooler months. With the right treatments, you can effectively cut your utility spending in half annually.\nTom Culp, owner of Birch Point Consulting in Wisconsin and a board member of nonprofit public interest group the Attachments Energy Rating Council, spoke more about the importance of window treatments for a home. \"For a typical home, the window area is less than 10% of the overall shell. But the Department of Energy has estimated that windows can account for up to 50% of the energy that flows in and out of the home,\" he said. \"Windows have an oversized importance in your home's energy performance and your energy bills.\"\nHow do curtains and blinds save energy?\nWindow treatments can make your home more energy efficient in a couple of ways. How they can help and the right window treatments to purchase for energy savings depend on the time of year and the climate where you live.\nWhen it's cold and dark in the winter, the right window treatments can act as a barrier, preventing your home from losing heat through leaks or cracks around your windows. They can also keep cold, drafty air from entering your home.\n\"You have a lot of energy going in and out of your home through the windows,\" said Culp. \"A blind or shade will provide an insulating layer to help block some of that heat loss, especially at night.\"\nIn warm, sunny weather, blinds, shades, films and other treatments block the sun, keeping your home cooler during the hottest times of the day. In colder climates, sunlight can be beneficial in winter and the shoulder seasons.\n\"The sun coming in your window can be good or bad. Where I live in Wisconsin, it helps to warm your house and offset heating costs,\" said Culp. \"If you're in the South, maybe the sun isn't your friend in the summer. A blind or shade can block some of that sunlight and stop that extra heat from coming in and adding to your air conditioning costs. It really depends on where you are in the country and your specific application.\"\nNot all window treatments are created equal. To get the most value and find the right product for you, it's important to understand the different window treatments available.\nInsulated cellular shades\nAlso called honeycomb shades or cellular shades, these pleated fabric shades are considered the most high-performing window treatment option in terms of R-value, which measures the performance of a building's insulation. Their honeycomb shape creates a layer of air that blocks heat or cold from entering your home. They also have the most potential to help you save on energy. Insulated cellular shades reduced energy use by 20% in one study conducted by the US Department of Energy.\nThermal curtains\nThermal curtains resemble everyday fabric curtains but they differ from decorative curtains in a significant way. They're made from multiple layers of thick, insulating fabric designed to hold in cool or warm air and prevent leaks or drafts from windows.\nThermal blinds\nThermal blinds are year-round window treatments that create a heat-reflecting barrier on your home's windows. Similar to insulated cellular shades, these blinds often have honeycomb-shaped pockets to trap a layer of air that acts as a thermal barrier between the window and your home. An aluminum layer on each side of the blinds reflects heat out in the summer and into your space in the winter.\nWindow quilts\nA window quilt works the same way as a quilt made for your bed. By sewing layers of fabric together with an insulating layer between them, a window quilt blocks air from getting in or out through your windows. They also completely block the sun, doing double-duty as blackout curtains, and can help reduce outside noise.\nWindow quilts are available in roll-up and pull-up models to allow for more flexibility, although some are designed with velcro or snaps to attach the treatment around all four sides of the window.\nWindow films\nUnlike the other window treatments on this list, which are attached to the interior or exterior of your windows to help with energy efficiency, films are applied directly to the glass. Window films reduce warming from the sun's heat as well as glare and UV rays, but because they're not adjustable, they're better for warm, sunny climates rather than cold ones. Because window films are tinted, they provide privacy while allowing you to see outside, unlike curtains and blinds.\nAwnings\nWhen attached to your home's exterior above windows, awnings block sunlight, preventing solar heat gain in your home. Fixed and adjustable models are available and you can install a single awning over a window or a longer awning that can shade the windows over one entire side of your house.\nLike window films, awnings may be a better option for homeowners in warm climates, as blocking the sun will require more energy to heat your home in winter.\nHow do you find energy-efficient curtains and blinds?\nOn AERC's residential product search page, you can find certified window treatments and even filter and sort to find products that fit your needs and climate. While you probably have an idea of whether your home is more in need of cooling or heating for more of the year, the organization also has a climate zone map that can help you choose whether the AERC's cool or warm rating is more relevant to your home.\nYou can also look for products with the AERC's Energy Improvement Label when you're shopping. Each rating label includes a number for how well the product performs in cool and warm climates.\nRegardless of the window attachments you choose, you'll get the most energy savings when they're adjusted regularly according to conditions outside. Another Department of Energy study found that 75% of window coverings stay in the same position every day and more than half of US households don't adjust their window coverings daily. Culp sees that fact as an opportunity for automation to make energy-efficient window treatments even more effective.\n\"What automation can do better than most homeowners is open your window treatments when it's advantageous for you and closed when it's not,\" he said. \"You can control it yourself from an app or it can be set to be run optimally. It knows when it will save you the most energy and the most money so that you get better performance.\"\nWill regular curtains and blinds improve efficiency?\n\"All window attachments will have an impact, from basic mini-slat blinds to decorative sheers to high-performance insulating cellular shades,\" Culp said.\nThe curtains or blinds you can pick up at a department store or big-box store haven't been designed specifically for energy efficiency. They may reduce your energy use somewhat but you'll likely see a bigger impact on your utility bills with a product that's labeled as energy efficient and an AERC rating that makes sense for your home and your climate.\nFrequently asked questions\nWill curtains and blinds lower my energy bill?\nYes. Even regular blinds and shades will offer some energy savings when they're deployed properly. You'll see greater savings and use less energy with window treatments that are specifically designed for energy efficiency and have an AERC rating that makes sense for your home and climate.\nHow do I know the window treatments I'm buying are energy efficient?\nLook for AERC ratings on product packaging or use the AERC's website to find products with energy efficiency ratings."

      "text": "Feeling the pinch of high utility bills? Taking steps to make your home more energy efficient can cut down on the electricity and gas you use.\nBut beyond turning off the lights when you leave a room, unplugging seldom-used electronics and buying Energy Star appliances, it can be tough to know where to start.\nThat's where a home energy audit can help. Also called a home energy assessment, getting an audit and putting its recommendations into place can save you anywhere from 5% to 30% on your utility bills, according to the US Department of Energy. Making energy-efficient upgrades based on a home energy audit can also create a safer and more comfortable environment inside your home while cutting down on your carbon footprint.\nWhat is a home energy audit?\nA home energy audit measures how much energy you're using and identifies opportunities for increasing energy efficiency in your home. If you're interested in creating a more energy-efficient home, getting an audit is the first step.\nYou or a professional auditor will identify factors in your home that are affecting energy use, and an auditor can recommend repairs, adjustments or upgrades you can make to increase efficiency. A home energy audit involves examining utility bills or energy usage data to look for anomalies and evaluating the building envelope -- the parts of your house like walls, floors, windows and roofs that separate indoor air and outdoor air. That includes checking insulation, identifying air leaks and evaluating appliances such as HVAC systems. It may also include assessing indoor air quality and ventilation.\n\"The three big things that go into energy efficiency are air sealing your house, insulating your house and your heating and cooling system,\" said Joel Rosenberg, special projects program manager at electrification nonprofit Rewiring America.\nThe most basic form of energy audit takes place without an auditor entering your home. This process, known as a remote energy audit, virtual energy audit or quick energy audit, involves answering basic questions about your utility bills and different areas of your home, such as the age of your furnace or the condition of your windows. You might complete this type of home energy audit via a simple online questionnaire or with an auditor present via videoconference.\nA more thorough energy audit includes an in-person visit from a professional auditor who will visually inspect areas of your home and may conduct physical tests. They'll pay particular attention to doors and windows, attics and basements, floorboards, baseboards and other areas where air leaks can be common. Depending on the type of audit you're getting and who's providing it, an in-person home energy audit could include:\n- Blower door test to identify leaks and cracks throughout the home\n- Insulation check in attics and basements\n- Assessment of appliances like your furnace, AC unit and water heater\n- Infrared camera test to identify leaky windows or doors\n- Lighting inspection\n- Analysis of recent utility bills\n- Discussion of your home's energy uses and any comfort issues you're experiencing\nIn-person audits can take anywhere from one to three hours and cost up to several hundred dollars. But your utility may provide free or low-cost home energy audits, and in some states, you can get an in-person energy audit for free.\nThe most comprehensive home energy audits will also assess and make recommendations around safety factors that relate to energy efficiency measures. These safety checks may include radon testing, testing smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors, assessing indoor air quality and checking gas appliances for leaks or other malfunctions that can affect residents' health and safety if the building envelope is improved.\n\"A lot of people recommend air sealing, which is really good for energy,\" said Mike Barcik, technical principal at sustainable building nonprofit Southface in Atlanta. \"If you aren't paying attention, you can create a situation that could be dangerous.\"\nTo prepare for a home energy audit, it's a good idea to review recent utility bills and have them on hand for your auditor to review. Prep a list of questions or problem areas to discuss with your auditor, such as leaky windows or uninsulated mudrooms.\nBefore the auditor arrives on the day of the audit, close all windows and exterior doors to prepare for the blower door test. During the test, a special device called a blower door uses a powerful fan to blow the air out of your home, lowering the pressure inside and allowing outside air to flow in through any cracks or leaks. You'll also want to clean out wood-burning stoves and fireplaces and ensure they're not in use before the audit, as the blower door test can create an ashy mess.\nThe benefits of a home energy audit\nWhile a comprehensive home energy audit typically comes with an upfront cost, the cost savings on utility bills and the increased comfort you'll feel in the home can be more than worth it. Getting a home energy audit is just the first step of the process. You'll need to make the upgrades and adjustments recommended by your auditor before you can experience the benefits.\n\"The energy audit is a great first step. It's like going to the doctor for a physical, but the doctor is going to write you a prescription for what to do next,\" Rosenberg said.\nEnergy bill savings\nThe most obvious benefit of a home energy audit is lowering your utility bills. As you might expect, an energy-efficient home will use less energy, leading to lower energy costs on your gas or electric bill (or both). \"If your house is leaking less air that you've paid to heat or cool to the outside, the less money you're wasting,\" Rosenberg said.\nA more comfortable home\nIf your home is sweltering in the summer and freezing in the winter, energy efficiency upgrades recommended by your auditor can increase your and your family's comfort in the home. \"The more control you have over your indoor air, both in terms of the air quality and the temperature, the more comfortable the house will be,\" said Rosenberg.\nBy sealing up leaky doors and windows, adding insulation where it's needed and upgrading HVAC systems, your home will lose less heat in the winter and cold in the summer, giving you better climate control indoors year-round.\nReduced carbon emissions\nThe appliances in an energy-efficient home don't have to work as hard or use as much fuel to do their jobs. That applies to HVAC systems, lighting and even ceiling fans. By using less energy, you're burning less fossil fuels, thereby reducing carbon emissions.\nTax credits for home energy audits\nThe energy efficient home improvement credit, part of the Inflation Reduction Act, provides a tax credit of 30%, up to $150, for taxpayers who get a home energy audit conducted by a qualified professional auditor. Many states and local utilities also offer incentives for home energy audits, ranging from tax rebates to discounts to no-cost assessments. For example, Massachusetts homeowners, landlords and renters can take advantage of free energy efficiency assessments through the state's Mass Save program.\nHow to find an energy auditor\nIf you're hoping to take advantage of the IRA tax credit, note that only audits conducted by auditors certified by organizations on the Department of Energy's list of qualified certification programs will be eligible. These certifiers include the Building Performance Institute, the Association of Energy Engineers, ASHRAE and the Residential Energy Services Network.\nBarcik recommends seeking out home energy auditors with a certification from BPI or Home Energy Raters, the latter of which is offered through RESNET. \"I'd say the highest level of a residential audit is to have a full-on audit with a HERS rater,\" he said. \"Anybody that has one or both of those credentials usually knows what they're doing.\"\nRosenberg recommends searching the BPI or RESNET websites to find certified home energy auditors in your area, as well as checking with your utility, which may have their own list of qualified auditors for state-level or utility-level incentives. Once you've narrowed down a list, check online reviews for those companies and go with a well-rated auditor that fits your budget.\nDo-it-yourself home energy audits\nA professional home energy audit will give you the most comprehensive information about your home's energy use and ways to boost energy efficiency. However, there are a few things homeowners can do on their own to identify and make improvements.\nLook for areas along doors and windows, floorboards, baseboards and the junctions between walls and ceilings where you can see or feel air gaps. You also can buy or rent an infrared camera or smartphone attachment, which creates a visual representation of hot or cold air coming in, to pinpoint these areas. Seal gaps with an appropriate material such as caulk or weatherstripping.\nCheck the insulation in your attic, especially around your attic hatch, if your home has one. If your home has a fireplace, make sure the damper is closed. You can also insulate any exposed hot water pipes yourself, as long as you can access them. If you have combustion appliances such as a gas or oil-burning furnace, a gas fireplace or a gas stove, check with a professional to ensure there's adequate ventilation for the appliances to operate safely before sealing.\nIf you're not using a professional auditor to evaluate your energy-using appliances, Rosenberg recommends checking their age for yourself. \"The auditor can come in and look at your equipment and tell you how old it is, but you can do that too,\" he said. \"Look at the nameplates on your equipment, often near the serial number. It will say around when it was manufactured, and that's a pretty good proxy for how old it is.\"\nThe lifespan of HVAC systems, like furnaces, boilers and AC units, tends to be around 15 to 20 years with proper care and maintenance, while water heaters typically last up to 10 years. If your equipment is nearing the end of its lifespan, chances are that upgrading to a newer, more efficient model or electrifying your system will save significant energy and reduce your utility bills.\nFinally, one very easy energy efficiency strategy that just about any homeowner can do -- even without a DIY assessment -- is to switch from incandescent or fluorescent to LED bulbs.\n\"There's never a downside to upgrading to 100% LED lighting,\" Barcik said. \"You shouldn't even wait for your light bulbs to burn out. It's to your economic advantage to just go ahead and replace them today.\" If the bulbs you're replacing are fluorescent, he notes, be sure to recycle them at an appropriate facility rather than throwing them in the trash.\nFrequently asked questions\nCan a home energy audit help reduce electricity bills?\nYes. Making the recommended upgrades from a home energy audit can save you anywhere from 5 to 30% on utility bills.\nHow much does a home energy audit cost?\nHome energy audits range in cost from free for virtual, remote, or subsidized assessments to anywhere from $100 to $600 on average for more comprehensive, in-person assessments. Tax credits, rebates and other incentives offered by federal and state governments or local utilities can reduce that cost."

      "text": "Stop spending so much on electricity\nYou've probably noticed that your gas and electric bills have been more costly than usual this year.\nIn fact, the EIA estimates the Northeast regions could see a $100 increase in wholesale electricity over last year. And other regions across the country are seeing rising prices too.\nIf you're looking for ways to cut down on utility costs, there are plenty of simple measures you can take to lower your energy bills from turning off the lights to doing laundry the cost-efficient way. Here are the top 23 ways to start saving now.\nUse your dishwasher\nDishwashers may use electricity, but they save more energy, money, water and time than washing dishes by hand.\nAccording to the California Energy Commission, using an Energy Star-qualified dishwasher instead of hand washing can save you 5,000 gallons of water and $40 in utility costs each year, on average, not to mention 230 hours of your time.\nAir-dry your dishes\nOpt out of the heat-dry cycle on your dishwasher. Instead, crack open the door and let your dishes air-dry. If your dishwasher has an air-dry option, use that instead of heat-dry.\nAir drying plates can reduce your dishwasher's energy use by 15% to 50%, according to the California Energy Commission.\nGet 'em clean\nThese dishwasher tips won't save electricity if you have to repeat loads because the dishes just won't get clean. That's why you need to make sure to load the dishes correctly.\nFor example, you should place plates in the bottom rack, bowls on the top rack and cups upside-down. Pots and other large items should be washed separately.\nUse a fan\nIf you live in an area of the world where the summers are hot, turn on your ceiling fans instead of touching the thermostat. Using a ceiling fan can make a room feel 10 degrees Fahrenheit cooler, and a fan uses 10% of the energy that a central air conditioner does, according to the US Natural Resource Defense Council.\nUse a smarter bulb\nIf you haven't switched to LED lighting, now is the time. The US Department of Energy says that LED bulbs use at least 75% less energy -- and last 25 times longer -- than incandescent lighting. That equals a lot of savings over time.\nUse motion to stop waste\nIf you're constantly following family members from room to room and turning off lights behind them, a little automation can save you time and money. One solution could be motion detectors, like GE's LED Plus lineup or Ring's smart outdoor lights. They turn on when they sense someone's in the room and turn off when no movement is detected.\nTurn off the burner a little early\nAccording to the California Energy Commission, if you turn off the burner early, the stove will release enough heat to finish up whatever you're cooking and save electricity. This tip works for most dishes, though there are a few exceptions.\nKeep your oven closed\nEvery time you open an oven door while cooking, the internal temperature can drop 25 degrees Fahrenheit. The oven then has to use more electricity to bring the temperature back up. To save electricity, peek through the window and rely on the oven's light instead of opening the door.\nGo small\nIf you're heating or cooking something small, use a smaller appliance like your microwave or toaster oven. These use substantially less electricity than the oven.\nRelated reading: Yes, an Air Fryer Can Save You Money on Your Energy Bill\nInstall a dimmer\nDimming your lights reduces wattage and output, which helps save energy, according to the US Department of Energy.\nSome dimmer switches can be controlled by an app, like the Lutron Caseta In-Wall Wireless Smart Lighting Kit, giving you even more ways to adjust your lights and save electricity from wherever you are.\nBe sure to get bulbs that work with dimmer switches, though.\nUse a smart plug\nYou may think that your electronics and appliances are energy-efficient, but you might be using more electricity than you think.\nThe TP-Link Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Plug Mini is a gadget that plugs into your wall; you can schedule it to turn your electronic devices on and off automatically.\nPut it on standby\nPutting your electronics on standby saves more money than leaving them on 24/7, but it still uses a substantial amount of electricity.\nAccording to the US Department of Energy, electronics on standby account for 10% or more of your electricity bill.\nBetter yet, get a strip\nOne of the best ways to control these power wasters is by plugging them into a power strip or a smart outlet like the TP-Link Kasa Smart Wi-Fi Power Strip.\nJust switch the strip off or use the smart switch's app to turn off electricity guzzlers when you go to bed or you're not home.\nInstall a programmable thermostat\nStill have that thermostat from the 1970s? Switch it out with a programmable thermostat such as the Nest, Ecobee or Honeywell. According to the Alliance to Save Energy, switching to a programmable thermostat can save you save up to 10% on cooling and heating costs.\nHere's a list of the best thermostats you can get right now.\nCheck your thermostat location\nWhile you're considering a programmable thermostat, check your current thermostat's location. It could be on the wrong wall.\nDrafts, direct sunlight and other factors can trigger your AC or furnace to kick on when it doesn't need to. Here's the perfect place to put your thermostat.\nBaby your dryer\nThe California Energy Commission says that dryers use approximately 6% of a home's total electricity usage. You can help your dryer work more efficiently by keeping it clean, and emptying the lint trap after each load is one of the most important things you can do to stop a dryer from working harder than necessary.\nHere's more on how to deep-clean your dryer and your dryer vent.\nGo cold\nStart using cold water when you wash laundry. Why? Because 90% of the electricity used to wash a load goes toward heating the water, according to Consumer Reports.\nThe Alliance to Save Energy also says washing clothes in cold water can save you $63 a year on electricity bills. Most detergents are designed to work better in cold water, anyway, so this is an easy swap to make.\nUpgrade your laundry room\nOlder appliances aren't as energy-efficient as they could be. For example, Energy Star estimates that a washer over 10 years old could cost you around $190, on average, per year.\nOld dryers waste energy, too\nSwitch out your dryer while you're getting a washer. Your old dryer could be wasting 20% more energy than a newer, Energy Star-certified model.\nSpeed up your load\nGiving your clothes an extra spin in the washer can save up to half the drying time. Here are some more ways to save electricity on laundry day.\nSwitch out your showerhead\nSwitching to a 2.5-gallon-per-minute (low-flow) showerhead and taking a 10-minute shower not only saves you 5 gallons of water over taking a bath, it also saves up to $145 each year in electricity, according to Energy Star.\nAir ducts can be electricity suck\nThe air ducts in your home could be costing you big bucks. Ducts with holes, clogs and leaks can lose around 20% of the HVAC's efficiency. Have your ducts looked at by a professional if you have any of these problems.\nGo solar\nYou may not be able to convert your whole home to solar power, but there are a bunch of small ways you can incorporate it into your life. Here are other small ways you can go solar.\nFor more information, check out the best energy-saving devices to keep your utility bills down."

      "text": "In this article:\nIf you're thinking about purchasing a smart thermostat, Google's two Nest options are worth considering. The Learning Thermostat is Nest's flagship product, first introduced in the early 2010s, years before Google bought the emerging startup. Now in its third generation, the $249 Nest Learning Thermostat continues to be a staple for the brand.\nNest has added more than a dozen other devices in the last decade, such as video doorbells, smart speakers, displays and routers. It's also made an effort to introduce products for different budgets, especially within the smart thermostat category -- including the $130 Nest Thermostat, introduced in 2020. This newer thermostat has a lot to offer despite costing $119 less than the original.\nSo, which Nest model is the best? Below we'll dig into the key differences between these two Google thermostats. (Once you do pick one, we've got a guide for how to install your Nest thermostat. We've also got comparisons of Nest Thermostat vs. Amazon Smart Thermostat, Nest Thermostat vs. Ecobee3 Lite and Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium vs. Nest Learning Thermostat.)\nThe Nest Learning Thermostat is the Google company's premium smart thermostat. Available for $249, the third-gen Learning Thermostat features a metal ring and a high-res display.\nIts classic turn dial design lets you navigate among the settings and you can press down on the thermostat to make a selection. It's easy enough to use, but I prefer the new Nest Thermostat's side controls (more on this in the next section). You can still set up this model using the Nest app and control it in the Google Home app. The new Nest Thermostat, in contrast, only works in the Google Home app.\nThe Learning Thermostat is available in seven different color finishes: stainless steel, mirror black, brass, polished steel, white, black and copper. It comes with a trim kit if you need to cover up old holes or paint. And it works with the optional Nest Temperature Sensor accessory, sold separately for $39 each or in a three-pack for $117 (currently on sale for $99).\nIts high-res display offers a feature called Farsight that displays the weather, time or temperature when it senses your presence. This model also has a learning algorithm that's designed to adapt to your schedule over time and automatically make adjustments on your behalf. It also uses a proximity sensor to determine your home or away status.\nThe Nest Thermostat has the same rounded shape as the Learning Thermostat -- and both work with compatible smart speakers and displays (sold separately). That's where their similarities end.\nGoogle got rid of the turn dial on the new Nest Thermostat. Instead there's a touch control strip on the right side for adjusting the temperature and making other changes to your settings. I like this update, but wish the controls were available on both the right and the left side so us lefties could control it more comfortably. Still, I found the controls responsive and intuitive and an overall improvement over the previous turn dial approach.\nThis model is made of plastic and features a mirrored finish, as well as different color options than the Learning Thermostat. It's available in snow (white), sand (rose gold), fog (light greenish/blueish-gray) and charcoal (dark gray). Matching trim kits are sold separately for $15 each. This one doesn't work with the Nest Temperature Sensor accessory. It also doesn't have the high-res display and \"Farsight\" feature offered with the Learning Thermostat.\nThe Nest Thermostat is the first of the company's thermostats that doesn't work with the Nest app (the original app that still houses some legacy products, including the Nest Learning Thermostat). Instead, this model can only be set up and controlled in the Google Home app.\nIt also won't learn your schedule over time and adjust accordingly. It lets you enter a schedule and will automatically switch between home and away modes based on the thermostat's built-in proximity sensor.\nWhich Nest should you get?\nThere's no wrong answer here; both thermostats are excellent. Just consider your specific needs before you buy. If you're looking for a more substantial, premium design, go for the Learning Thermostat. It has more color finish options, comes with a trim kit and offers some advanced features, such as the learning algorithm, the Farsight feature and compatibility with the optional Nest Temperature Sensor accessory.\nThe Nest Thermostat is considerably less expensive than the Learning Thermostat. It offers an updated mirrored design in four color finishes and a refreshed side control thermostat interface. Your purchase doesn't include a trim kit and the thermostat isn't compatible with the Nest Temperature Sensor. It also doesn't have the same learning algorithm or Farsight. But for over $100 less than the Learning Thermostat, the new Nest Thermostat is an excellent option that holds its own against Google's flagship thermostat."

      "text": "If you're in the market for a smart thermostat, the Ecobee SmartThermostat with Voice Control and the Ecobee3 Lite Smart Thermostat are two solid options. These app-enabled thermostats offer intuitive technology so adjusting your home's temperature is a breeze whether you're at home or hundreds of miles away. While both models share a similar design and basic lineup of features, they're priced $80 apart.\nTo find out where the two thermostats diverge -- and which one might be best for you -- we're taking a closer look at how the premium Ecobee SmartThermostat with Voice Control compares to the more affordable Ecobee3 Lite Smart Thermostat.\nThe $249 Ecobee SmartThermostat with Voice Control is the company's most expensive smart thermostat. You can control it on your phone through the Ecobee app, but this model also has a built-in Amazon Alexa speaker. You can use Alexa voice commands to make phone calls, respond to texts and play your favorite music. You can also use the integrated Alexa to control your Ecobee thermostat, any other Alexa-powered devices.\nEcobee's SmartThermostat with Voice Control also plays well with other smart home ecosystems beyond Alexa. It's compatible with Apple HomeKit, Google Assistant, IFTTT and Samsung SmartThings. This model works with Spotify and can pair with a Bluetooth speaker.\nThis thermostat has built-in temperature and occupancy sensors that automatically adjust your temperature based on whether you're home or away. Your purchase also includes a remote sensor called a SmartSensor. You can place the sensor in any room of your home, where it can read the ambient temperature and detect occupancy. Like the thermostat itself, the sensor's Smart Home & Away feature can make temperature adjustment coincide with whether you're home or away. You can buy additional SmartSensors for $80 (pack of two).\nRead CNET's review of the Ecobee SmartThermostat with Voice Control..\nIf you want a mix of savings and convenience, the Ecobee3 Lite might be the right fit for you. At $169, this thermostat is the most affordable offering from the company.\nThe company gives you a variety of ways to monitor and make changes to your Ecobee3 Lite. You can control your home's temperature with a tap, either on the thermostat itself -- or through the Ecobee app. It also supports voice control and smart home integrations via Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, IFTTT, Samsung SmartThings and Android and iOS devices like the Apple Watch.\nIf you plan to go on vacation, you can activate vacation mode to maximize its energy efficiency. The system can help you detect rapid temperature variances, allowing you to react quickly to prevent your pipes from freezing.\nThe thermostat also gets to know you. Each month, you receive a free energy audit complete with comparisons of your energy usage with others in your area. And with a seven-day scheduling function, the Ecobee3 Lite provides an affordable and convenient way to track your home's heating and air conditioning. Unlike the SmartThermostat, this one doesn't have a built-in occupancy sensor. It's compatible with SmartSensors, but you don't get one with your purchase.\nFeatures\nThe Ecobee SmartThermostat with Voice Control is more advanced than the Ecobee3 Lite. With the SmartThermostat, you receive access to all of the Eco Plus benefits. Those benefits include temperature change recommendations based on your activity, either at the thermostat or in other rooms, when you connect your SmartSensor to the Ecobee app.\nIf you buy a SmartSensor for the Ecobee3 Lite, you do get some of those same benefits, but this less expensive model doesn't have an occupancy sensor built into the thermostat. And, while the Ecobee3 Lite works with all of the major smart home platforms, the SmartThermostat has voice control built-in. That hardware integration allows you to make temperature adjustments whenever you need it through a verbal command, without owning a separate Alexa-enabled smart speaker.\nThe SmartThermostat also works with Spotify -- and you can pair it with Bluetooth speakers to stream your favorite music, podcasts, and more in your home whenever you want. You can also make calls and listen to texts all hands-free.\nAccessories\nEcobee's SmartSensors work with both models. Your SmartThermostat comes with one SmartSensor; the Ecobee3 Lite doesn't come with any. You can buy SmartSensors a la carte in an $80 two-pack.\nThe SmartSensors have temperature- and occupancy-sensing technology. If you have rooms in your home that run particularly warm or cool -- you can place the SmartSensor there and use that location as the default temperature setting for your thermostat. That way, your home's set temperature is based on the current temperature in the cold basement office -- or the hot upstairs bedroom instead of at the location of the thermostat.\nWhich one is better?\nBoth are capable thermostats. While the Ecobee3 Lite Smart Thermostat doesn't have as many advanced features as the Ecobee SmartThermostat with VoiceControl, it gives you a lot of control over your heat and air conditioning. If you're looking for a simple way to manage your HVAC system from your phone, the Ecobee3 Lite is worth your money. You still receive features like Vacation Mode, seven-day programming, compatibility with Ecobee's wireless sensors and much more. And if your thermostat is located somewhere that's lightly trafficked, where you wouldn't commonly use voice commands or a smart speaker, the Ecobee3 Lite is a better choice.\nIf you want a SmartSensor and a thermostat with its own occupancy sensor, the SmartThermostat makes the most sense. It comes with a SmartSensor that makes real-time adjustments based on a room's temperature, occupancy and more. The system can also play your favorite music through Spotify. And with integrated Alexa voice control, you can command your thermostat with the confidence of a James Bond villain."

      "text": "The end of summer may be near, but many Americans are still facing soaring energy bills as they struggle to keep their homes feeling comfortable in the heat. Even households without air conditioning are feeling the pinch, with higher prices for gas, electricity, and water pushing monthly costs to new highs. According to this CNET survey, nearly 8 in 10 adults say they're stressed about utility bills, and the numbers show no signs of easing up.\nOne simple fix that often goes overlooked is unplugging electronics when they're not in use. Even when powered off, many devices continue to pull electricity in the background. Over weeks and months, that \"phantom load\" adds up, raising your bill and even making your home a little warmer by adding small amounts of extra heat.\nBuilding a habit of unplugging devices can help trim costs, and it works even better when paired with other smart strategies like closing blinds during peak hours, running ceiling fans to circulate air, and switching to energy-efficient laundry and water habits.\nBelow, we'll answer how much money unplugging home appliances can actually save you and whether the energy savings are worth unplugging and replugging appliances each day. Plus, to maximize your energy savings, we have tips on how to lower your water bill, the best temperature to set your thermostat at to save money and the energy-efficient way to do laundry to cut utility costs.\nCan unplugging appliances actually save me money?\nIt might seem counterintuitive to unplug your appliances. After all, they're off, so why would they be sucking up energy?\nThe fact is, household appliances actually still use energy even when they are turned off but still plugged in, according to Energy.gov. Whether the device is switched off or in standby mode, some of the worst offenders are:\n- A device that may still use energy in the form of lights or other displays showing the device is off.\n- Desktop computers that were put into sleep mode instead of being powered off.\n- Chargers that still draw power even if the device is not connected.\n- Media players that continually draw power, especially ones that still might scan for updates in the background.\n- Phones with displays that show when not in active use, like cordless phones.\n- New smart home appliances like refrigerators, washers and dryers that have always-on displays, internet connectivity and electronic controls.\nReduce your standby power to save electricity and money\nMany people are shocked to realize how much standby power can add up. Standby power accounts for 5% to 10% of residential energy use, according to the Department of Energy.\nHow much you save could depend on how many devices you use -- and your habits with them. For instance, an educational experiment from Colorado State University found that a combo radio/CD player/tape player used 4 watts continually, whether or not it was in use. Unplugging it when not in use would save 100 times as much power during the lifetime of the device.\nA study published by the Natural Resources Defense Council (PDF) found that reducing the load from always-on devices would save consumers a total of $8 billion annually and avoid using 64 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. It also has environmental benefits, like preventing 44 million metric tons of carbon dioxide pollution. The NRDC estimated the cost of always-on devices at up to $165 per household per year on average.\nBuying a smart plug can help you conserve energy by controlling the power on virtually any device you plug in. This plug from Leviton is CNET's top pick.\nHow can I optimize my standby power?\nThe first step is, of course, to unplug anything that is not actively in use or not used often. Examples of devices that could easily be unplugged include TVs and set-top boxes in guest rooms. It's also generally easy to unplug media players when not in use, like a radio or CD player. When you take your device off its charger, it can help you get into the habit of unplugging that charger as well. You might also be surprised how many devices we have plugged in that we don't even use anymore. Examples could include old wireless phones, old media players or lamps that are more decorative than functional.\nUnplugging and replugging in everything can get tedious, especially if your outlets are in hard-to-reach places. If the outlet is inaccessible, it will be hard to keep up.\nInstead, you can also set up ways to make the process of cutting phantom load more automatic. You can plug devices into surge protectors. That way, one flick of a power switch button can turn off multiple devices. You can also get timers to plug devices into or smart plugs so that you can automate when the power is connected to a device. For instance, you might set the time for the TV's power so it is only connected during peak use times like evenings or weekends.\nInvesting in a smart thermostat that can keep your room comfortable, while optimizing for power consumption is a good investment for long-term savings. Similarly, installing LED light bulbs is an excellent investment that uses far less energy compared to incandescent lightbulbs. While the initial outlay might seem high, the savings add up over the years.\nYou can also look into getting Energy Star products. Many of these products are rated to have lower standby power use than products that are not rated by Energy Star.\nFind additional resources for saving electricity\nAs power bills get higher and more erratic over time, it's more vital than ever to find ways to save on electric costs. For instance, in addition to unplugging the devices in the home, you can take a look at our guide about turning off lights when not in use. Another key way to affect your electric/heating bill for the better is to know the ideal temperature you should set for your home. You can also review our guide on quick tips for saving on your gas and electric bill, like turning down your water heater or changing your air filters.\nMore money-saving tips\n- Peak and Off-Peak Energy Explainer: Save Money, Find the Cheapest Time to Use Electricity\n- The Best Energy-Saving Smart Home Devices to Help You Save on Utility Bills\n- Change Your Water Heater's Set Temperature and Save Money\n- Cut Back Your Shower Time to Save Money on Your Energy and Water Bills\n- How to Save Money on Apartment Utilities as Energy Prices Skyrocket\n- This Habit Is Making Your Monthly Water Bills Skyrocket\n- One Simple Ceiling Fan Hack That Can Save You Money and Energy\n- How to Lower Your Air Conditioning Bill While You're Away on Vacation"

      "text": "Circulating fans, including ceiling fans, window fans, table fans, floor fans, and fans mounted to poles or walls, create a wind chill effect that makes you feel more comfortable. They can be used alongside natural ventilation or air conditioning to enhance cooling.\nCeiling Fans\nCeiling fans are the most effective type of circulating fan. They help improve comfort year-round by effectively circulating air throughout a room.\n- Summer Use: Run ceiling fans counterclockwise to create a cooling breeze.\n- Winter Use: Reverse the direction to clockwise and set to low speed to circulate warm air from the ceiling down to living spaces.\n- Energy Savings: Using a ceiling fan allows you to raise the thermostat setting by about 4\u00b0F without reducing comfort. In moderate climates, ceiling fans can sometimes replace air conditioning altogether.\nInstallation Tips\n- Ensure ceilings are at least eight feet high.\n- Follow manufacturer instructions for optimal placement and safety.\nSize and Placement\n- Room Size: Use a 36- or 44-inch diameter fan for rooms up to 225 square feet. For larger rooms, use fans 52 inches or more. In rooms longer than 18 feet, multiple fans work best.\n- Blade Size: Larger blades move more air at lower velocities, which is helpful in areas where a strong breeze might disturb loose objects.\nAdditional Tips\n- Check noise ratings and, if possible, test the fan before buying.\n- Look for the ENERGY STAR\u00ae label to ensure efficiency. ENERGY STAR\u00ae certified ceiling fans are up to 60% more efficient than conventional models.\nWindow Fans\nWindow fans are energy-efficient and effective in many climates. They work best when placed in windows facing away from the prevailing wind, exhausting hot air from your home. For more information on cooling your home efficiently, check out our guide on Cooling with Whole House Fans.\nUsage Tips:\n- Close windows near the fan tightly and open windows in rooms far from the fan, preferably on the windward side of your home.\n- Use windows near cooler, shaded outdoor areas for the best intake air.\n- In multi-level homes, place the fan on the upper level and open windows on the lower level, if possible. If not, ventilate each level with separate fans.\nMultiple Fans:\n- Using several window fans together can improve cooling efficiency. For example, fans in multiple upstairs bedrooms can pull air through the entire home, ensuring each bedroom is cooled.\nTake Action\nEnhance your home\u2019s cooling efficiency by utilizing ceiling and window fans. Consult a professional for installation if needed, and always follow manufacturer instructions for optimal performance and safety.

      "text": "As the days start cooling down, it's time to think about thermostat changes -- and there's one device that can make your new heating needs much easier to manage while also saving you a surprising amount of cash. Smart thermostats are small but powerful upgrades for your home that can learn your daily patterns, automate energy savings and help you fix cold or hot spots, without a subscription fee.\nOur Picks\nSMART THERMOSTAT DEALS OF THE WEEK\n- $81 (save $50)\n- $66 (save $25)\n- $55 (save $46)\n- $189 (save $21)\n- $194 (save $16)\nIn addition to remote app control, these thermostats make setting schedules speedy and can give you insights on just how efficient your home heating or cooling is. CNET's reviewers have tested the best over the past several years, and here's what we prefer for our own homes.\nRead more: This Modest Gadget Is the New Superhero of the Energy-Efficient Home\nWhat is the best thermostat overall?\nAfter many hours testing the functions of the latest smart thermostats, our experts recommend the Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium as the top Wi-Fi thermostat that can do everything. This programmable thermostat not only learns your schedule, it also monitors your indoor air quality and lets you adopt Siri or Alexa voice assistant options if you don't have a smart speaker.\nWe've also chosen Amazon's model for an excellent Alexa choice; Nest's latest thermostat for a beautiful, energy-saving powerhouse; an Ecobee model for a budget choice; and more. Take a look at the latest picks and our smart thermostat reviews, below.\nBest smart thermostats of 2025\nPros\n- Learning and vacation modes for complete control\n- Reliable air quality monitoring\n- Built-in speaker for Alexa or Siri\n- Included remote temperature sensor\n- Can control other Ecobee products\nCons\n- Very expensive\nWhy I like it:\nOne of the selling points of a smart thermostat is that it can save you money, so we can\u2019t say money is no object. But if money is no object, the Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium eclipses the competition. It offers the most advanced features, like a little sensor with a magnetic stand I could put in any room, and the ability to show a four-day forecast on the thermostat itself.\nThe Ecobee model also comes with a separate satellite sensor to target heating or cooling to levels in a specific room. When I asked Ecobee about its latest features, they responded that the thermostat could help save up to 26% on energy bills and mentioned, \"One of my favorite recent additions to the Ecobee smart thermostat experience is Home Energy Reports. These interactive reports help you visualize and understand the direct benefit of our temperature optimizations on your home\u2019s energy use.\"\nWhile many smart thermostats can work with voice assistant platforms like Google's Home/Gemini options or Alexa, this Premium model is the only one that offers built-in compatibility (plus a mic and speaker) for Alexa and an option to add on Siri, so you don't need an app or smart speaker to give it commands.\nWho is this for:\nPeople who want a ton of smart features in a single device, including built-in voice assistants, and a satellite sensor for detailed home climate control.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who don't want to pay a lot of money, those who already have a smart speaker they're happy with, people who don't want to learn a lot of new features.\nPros\n- Built-in Alexa and Echo compatibility\n- Useful learning features for the price\n- Affordable at under $100\n- Explains energy settings to users\nCons\n- Basic design compared to competitor models\n- Amazon's data privacy raises more questions than other thermostat brands\nWhy I like it:\nThe Amazon Smart Thermostat stands out among its peers in the sub-$100 category by having far better technology, including the ability to sense if you\u2019re home and Alexa\u2019s \u201chunches\u201d to see if a setting will work while saving you energy. It'll save you lots of energy while paying itself off faster, making it an excellent starter model. And if you add an Echo Dot 5, the thermostat can use it as a separate room and air sensor, too.\nAmazon's model doesn\u2019t have quite the advanced features of a $200 thermostat, and its display is fairly basic, but the savings are very significant, and not everyone wants a fancy touchscreen. Another thing I liked: It shows information about your energy and HVAC usage, explaining what it all means -- a smart thermostat that makes the customer smarter.\nNote: Read my full guide on smart thermostat privacy here to see how Amazon approaches this issue and why some users may want to take security precautions.\nWho is this for:\nPeople primarily interested in affordability and effective features, and less concerned with a bunch of extra learning features. It also helps if you don't mind Alexa and Amazon gleaning your household data.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who aren't fans of Alexa, users who want more smart and scheduling options, users particularly concerned about their home privacy.\nPros\n- Beautiful round display\n- Easy-to-use Eco Modes and energy reports\n- Satellite sensor for targeted heating\n- Compatibility with some Nest products like the Nest Hub Max\n- No C-wire required for installation\n- High-quality presence sensing\nCons\n- Expensive\n- Shiny display can be a little distracting\nWhy I like it:\nThe newest version of the Nest Learning Thermostat brings the best high-tech smart technology to an attractive device that works even if your home doesn't have a C-wire. The new model builds on its predecessor's attractive design by adding a sensor that can tell how far you are from the thermostat and change the information on the faceplate accordingly. Mine can even show weather effects like falling snow or the setting sun depending on what's happening outside.\nLike Ecobee's, this model also comes with an included external room sensor, encouraging you from the start to keep track of the comfort level in more than just one room of your home. The beautiful design especially sparkles when showing outdoor temperatures with associated weather animations. On the more practical side, the Nest reports and easy-to-see Eco Modes make saving money very easy.\nWho is this for:\nUsers who love a beautiful thermostat and already have Nest devices, but want something that will save them money with easy eco modes.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nBuyers who want to save on initial costs and aren't especially big fans of the Google Nest ecosystem.\nPros\n- Simple, clean touchscreen interface\n- Quick setup\n- Alexa and Google compatibility\n- Affordable when on sale\n- Provides energy, equipment and maintenance reports\nCons\n- Lacks smart features like built-in presence sensing and learning capabilities\nWhy I like it:\nThe Sensi Touch 2 is an excellent choice if you interact a lot with the physical thermostat. The app is good, and the thermostat is compatible with Alexa and Google Home, but the display on this one really shines. It\u2019s simple, intuitive and clear, allowing you to easily make changes.\nSome other thermostats require you to know what the particular icon means, which can add to the learning curve, but this one is straightforward. Plus, the temperature setting is prominently displayed, and you can set a range of temperatures very easily with the tap of a finger.\nIf you find the larger, flashier thermostat displays a bit overwhelming, Sensi's model may be a breath of cool air. While it's a bit more limited than some picks, it still works with Google and Alexa commands and provides alerts and reminders.\nWho is this for:\nUsers look for a minimalist model with more traditional manual controls that still includes handy smart features like voice assistant support.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nPeople who want learning functions and advanced eco modes. plus more sensor options.\nPros\n- Simple, effective controls and app\n- Easy setup\n- Satellite sensor options\n- Humidity and air quality sensors for air management\nCons\n- Making full use of this thermostat requires big investment in Resideo's ecosystem\nWhy I like it:\nThe Honeywell Home T9 was a very nice thermostat that combined smart features with a traditional design, but the upgrades for the T10 truly impressed us. Installation remains simple, and you can largely avoid app use if you prefer to stick with onboard controls. However, smart features still abound, and the thermostat works with remote sensors for targeted heating.\nThe T10 really shines when combined with compatible Resideo whole-house devices like the TrueDRY dehumidifier or F200 Media Air Cleaner. It can use its readings (with an added Equipment Interface Model) to automatically shut this air quality equipment on or off for increased comfort without manual adjustment or complex smart device workarounds -- as long as you're willing to make the investment.\nWho is this for:\nUsers who like the idea of investing in whole-house humidity and air quality control tied to their thermostat.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nUsers who don't really plan on investing in a bunch of Resideo home tech.\nPros\n- Affordable at under $150\n- Keeps many of the best Ecobee features like auto-away mode\n- Streamlined for ease of use\n- Retains the stylish touchscreen\nCons\n- Users who want to pay under $100 will have to look elsewhere\n- Lacks more advanced sensors\nWhy I like it:\nWhile it's not quite as cheap as my Amazon pick, I still think the Ecobee Essential model is one of the best budget thermostats if you're willing to spend around $140 for one. While it doesn't have the Premium's extra sensor or wireless satellite sensor, it does come with all the learning functions, useful screen information and app controls you could want.\nEcobee's compatibility with Siri, Alexa and Google remains as well, so you have plenty of home control options. That makes this an excellent upgrade for those interested in a new thermostat but who would rather keep things simple while still getting lots of smart upgrades.\nWho is this for:\nBuyers looking for a more affordable, streamlined Ecobee thermostat with plenty of energy saving but no extras to worry about setting up.\nWho shouldn\u2019t buy it:\nBuyers determined to spend less than $150 on a thermostat, users who want extra info about air quality or weather\nSmart thermostats compared\n| Best smart thermostats | Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium | Amazon Smart Thermostat | Nest Learning Thermostat (4th gen) | Sensi Touch 2 | Honeywell Home T10 Pro Smart Thermostat | Ecobee Smart Thermostat Essential |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Price: | $260 | $80 | $263 | $178 | $209 | $140 |\n| Presence sensing and learning functions: | Yes | Yes with Echo devices | Yes | No | No | Yes |\n| Wireless temperature sensors: | Included, can support multiple sensors in different rooms | Echo Dot 5 can function as a satellite sensor | Satellite sensor included, can average temperatures from multiple sensors | Satellite sensors available (not included) | Satellite sensors available (not included) | Satellite sensors available (not included) |\n| Smart home compatibility: | Apple Home/Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant/Gemini | Amazon Alexa | Amazon Alexa, Google Home/Gemini | Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings | Apple Home/Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings | Apple Home/Siri, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant/Gemini |\n| HVAC C-wired required: | Yes, adapter kits available through Ecobee | Yes | No | Yes | Yes, adapter kits available | Yes, adapter kits available through Ecobee |\n| Additional sensors: | Built-in indoor air quality and humidity sensors | Presence sensing added with Echo Dot | Tracks outdoor weather | N/A | Can track humidity and air quality with the right add-ons | N/A |\n| Review score: | 4.2/5 | 8.6/10 | 4/5 | 3.7/5 | N/A | N/A |\nOther smart thermostats we've tested\nCommercial Electric Smart Thermostat: Despite the name, this new offering from The Home Depot is a residential thermostat built to operate with the company\u2019s Hubspace smart home platform, although it\u2019ll work with Alexa and Google Home. It\u2019s a fairly straightforward system that allows significant control but lacks truly smart features. My favorite feature is setting a schedule based on sunrise or sunset.\nCync Smart Thermostat: This thermostat from GE Lighting, now owned by Savant which offers other home energy products such as solar batteries, offers good smart home interactions and the ability to buy an external sensor, but it lacked some of the more advanced features offered by other thermostats, while still costing more than the Amazon model.\nNest Thermostat: The Nest Thermostat was a compelling choice at a mid-level price range ($205), but a few things held it back. For one, it lacks the intuitive interface and features of its smarter big sibling (the Nest Learning Thermostat), and it wants to use the Google Home app instead of the more intuitive and feature-rich Nest app used by the Learning model. The installation prompts send you straight into scheduling, so prepare for that.\nFactors to consider when choosing a smart thermostat\nWhen you\u2019re shopping for a traditional standard thermostat, there isn\u2019t much to consider. What does it look like? Can you program it? Does it have that cool old-fashioned dial?\nWhen shopping for a smart thermostat, there are a lot more options and some things one person may love while the next person may hate. Here\u2019s what we think is important to consider.\nSmart home integration\nSmart thermostats all come with some kind of app or option to control the device from your phone. If you have a particular affinity for one smart home family or another, you\u2019ll want to make sure you\u2019re getting a thermostat that will work in conjunction with your other devices. Most smart thermostats will take voice commands from Amazon\u2019s Alexa, but if the rest of your home is running on, say, Apple\u2019s HomeKit, not every device will provide support.\nMake sure you\u2019re getting something that will play nice with the rest of your smart home.\nGeofencing\nFor the most part, your thermostat\u2019s job is to keep your home comfortable. That means you don\u2019t necessarily need it to be the perfect temperature when you aren\u2019t home. Many smart thermostats feature geofencing, meaning they can track whether or not you\u2019re home and set their expectations accordingly.\nSome devices track occupancy based on the phones of those in the household, while others combine that feature with other occupancy sensors. The good thing is that you can set limits around this feature: Do you want it to change the temperature when you\u2019re away? How far away do you have to be for it to kick in? What temperature limits should there be if you aren\u2019t home? The latter is important if you have pets. You don\u2019t want the cats sweltering or freezing while you\u2019re at work.\nHow smart do you want your thermostat to be?\nEveryone wants a different level of control over their thermostat. Some people want to decide at every moment what the temperature should be. (In that case, you can also consider a basic Wi-Fi-enabled programmable thermostat like the Honeywell Home RTH6580WF, which doesn\u2019t have as many smart features as its more expensive peers but can be adjusted from your phone.)\nSome smart thermostats can be too smart for their own good. One of the most common complaints I\u2019ve heard is that some products will hold the temperature you set them to only for a little bit, and then they\u2019ll revert to what the thermostat believes the temperature should be. If that would annoy you, focus on the ones that offer you the most control.\nInstallation and HVAC compatibility\nRead my full guide on smart thermostat installation guide here.\nNot all thermostats are installed exactly the same way, but they\u2019re all pretty similar. Expect to need a screwdriver, a pair of pliers capable of moving wires around and potentially a drill and a level. Installation is pretty simple once you\u2019ve done it once or twice: Turn off the power, mark the wires, take off the old one, wire the new one and put the thermostat up.\nYou\u2019ll want to watch out for two potential complications: First, does your system have a C-wire? There are usually five or so wires that come out of your wall to connect a thermostat. The older wires tend to carry just enough electricity to power an old-school thermostat. Smarter devices, which can tell you the weather or maybe play your playlist and need an internet connection, need more power than that. This is achieved through a C-wire, designed to carry more electricity to the thermostat. Not every home is wired with one, but if you don\u2019t have one, you have a couple of choices.\nThe first is to get a thermostat that doesn\u2019t require a C-wire. This is where the Nest thermostats are set apart because they\u2019re capable of charging their batteries off the other wires. The second option is to install an adapter kit. This involves adding a device to your HVAC system that converts one of the existing wires into a C-wire. Fortunately, most smart thermostats we\u2019ve looked at that require a C-wire come with these kits. If not, you can pick one up for under $25.\nThe second installation complication is seeing if your thermostat requires any high-voltage wires. This is most common for thermostats that power older electric furnaces or electric baseboard heaters. Today's smart thermostats can support high voltage wiring or those heating devices until you upgrade your system. High-voltage wires are usually labeled and support current at 120 volts or more.\nExternal sensors\nYour thermostat knows what the temperature is because it has a thermometer inside of it. The device\u2019s understanding of the temperature inside is usually limited to the temperature exactly where you mounted it to the wall. What about that stuffy bedroom?\nMany smart thermostats come with or are at least able to connect to separate room sensors. These room sensors allow you to train the thermostat to keep your house as comfortable as possible throughout the home. With external sensors, thermostats can target an individual room and get it to a comfortable temperature at a certain time (the bedroom at night, the home office during the day, etc.) or find a setting that makes everywhere as comfortable as possible, not just the room with the thermostat in it. Some even have proximity sensors in their room sensors, meaning they can tell when a room is occupied or not.\nHow we test smart thermostats\nMost of the home energy products we test and evaluate here at CNET have a lot of numbers attached to them: the efficiency of solar panels and the power output of batteries. Not so with smart thermostats. All of these thermostats can perform the basic functions of turning your heater on when it\u2019s cold and your AC on when it\u2019s hot. Some of our scoring is based on tangible, mathematical data, but it\u2019s mostly about the myriad ways you can interact with the thermostat to get the comfort level and energy savings you want.\nWe\u2019ve experimented, tested and handled each of the thermostats mentioned on this list, including installing them on a testing rig that simulates a standard HVAC system, programming them and trying their various features.\nThe 10-point scores we give smart thermostats are based on these metrics:\n- 20% is based on the available smart home connectivity and other features, including geofencing and external room sensors.\n- 20% is the price, with a formula that rewards less expensive products. Our methodology takes into account the price of any included room sensors.\n- 60% is completely subjective, based on our assessment of what the device offers, how easy it is to install, how easy the app or interface is to use and what features it has that might be non-standard for thermostats but helpful or useful for consumers.\nChoosing a thermostat is an incredibly subjective and personal choice, and our goal in scoring is to highlight those products that do the most and do them well. Your buying decision should focus on your priorities, which might not align exactly with ours, so be sure to look at more than just a score when choosing a device you will probably interact with almost every day.\nSmart thermostat privacy and security\nSince smart thermostats use a variety of sensors to monitor your activity, you may have privacy concerns. I dig deep into thermostat privacy in this guide, but the bottom line is that there isn't too much to worry about. Smart thermostats can't \"watch\" you or record video of your home, only get a broad sense of when people are moving around and when a house is still. Companies typically log data on how the thermostat and app are used, like when the thermostat begins an automatic temperature change and when it's manually altered.\nThermostat brands use that info for product analysis as well as marketing efforts. Within limitations, they may give it to third parties if you consent. Remember, if you use a voice assistant, it's probably recording your temperature commands for later analysis unless you have voice assistant settings to turn that option off.\nWhat we've updated\nSpring 2025: I added the Ecobee Essential model as an excellent budgets option for those who want more features than the absolute cheapest thermostats, but still want to save a lot on initial costs. Also, I made sure that our Honeywell Home picked was the latest T10 version that integrates with Resideo whole-home air quality equipment."

      "text": "Electricity seems to cost more every year, and as those expenses rise, consumers are feeling the pinch. This isn't a bill you can just eliminate, but that doesn't mean there aren't ways to save money. If you've been stressing over a giant electric bill, it's time to consider when you're using the most power. The price of electricity changes during the day, rising during peak hours, and becoming more affordable during off-peak hours. Depending on what time of day you're running the washing machine or dishwasher, you might be paying a premium for electricity.\nThis model is like surge pricing that Uber uses, except it's more convenient to use it to your advantage. The pricing varies as per demand -- when the grid is strained with lots of people plugged in, the demand is higher and so are the prices. On the other hand, when the grid isn't as busy, you can get lower pricing. If your utility company has you on a time-of-use plan, you can use it to your advantage during off-peak hours and keep the heavy electricity use limited to the time of day when electricity is at its cheapest. We've also got tips on the best time of day to do laundry to save money, and how to lower your water bill.\nWhat are peak hours?\nIn a time-of-use electricity plan, peak hours -- sometimes referred to as on-peak hours -- are the hours of the day when electricity demand is the highest. During this time, you will be paying the highest amount per kilowatt-hour used.\nSome electricity use is going to be unavoidable, whether it's your refrigerator keeping your food cool or your security system that's always on and protecting your home. Peak hours are a bad time to do tasks that can wait. If you're running large appliances, whether it's your dishwasher or washing machine, it's going to cost you extra during peak hours.\nWhat are off-peak hours?\nIn contrast to peak hours, off-peak hours are the times when electricity prices are cheaper. This is typically the case because fewer people are trying to access the grid during these hours, meaning there is less overall demand and you won't have to pay a premium for each kWh that you use.\nOff-peak hours are a great time to do those more energy-intensive tasks that you may have waiting for you. While it might not be the most convenient, if you happen to be home during off-peak hours, you can save money on your monthly electricity bill by timing your tasks to these time frames.\nWhy do utility companies use time-of-use rates?\nUtility companies know when stress on the grid is going to be at its highest. To make sure the grid can serve all of these customers, they need to make sure that power plants are operational and meeting all of the demand. When demand increases, these companies may have to generate more electricity, which can cost more. They either need to generate that power in advance to meet the peak or purchase extra energy from other sources. That additional expense is passed on to the consumer through time-of-use rates, which charge you more when you use electricity during peak hours.\nWhen are peak hours?\nPeak hours vary depending on the time of year and region of the country. As a general rule, think of peak hours as the time during which most people are getting home from work for the day. This is when people are turning on their lights, firing up their TVs and settling into their homes for the night -- all of which require more electricity than usual.\nHere's an overview of peak and off-peak hours by Eastern, Central, Mountain and Pacific time zones. Note that select states may have different time of use schedules, be sure to select your state from the menu on your provider's website if applicable.\nSummer\n| Time zone | Peak hours | Off-peak hours |\n|---|---|---|\n| Eastern | 2-6 p.m. | 6-2 p.m. (next day), Weekends all hours |\n| Central | 1-5 p.m. | 5-1 p.m. (next day), Weekends all hours |\n| Mountain | 8 a.m.-11 p.m. | 11 p.m.-8 a.m. |\n| Pacific | 5-9 p.m. | 9-5 p.m. (next day) |\nWinter\n| Time Zone | Peak hours | Off-peak hours |\n|---|---|---|\n| Eastern | 6-10 a.m.; 6-10 p.m. | 10 a.m.-6 p.m.; 10 p.m.-6 a.m., Weekends all hours |\n| Central | 5-9 a.m.; 5-9 p.m. | 9 a.m.-5 p.m.; 9 p.m.-5 a.m., Weekends all hours |\n| Mountain | 7 a.m.-10 p.m. | 10 p.m.-7 a.m. |\n| Pacific | 6-10 a.m.; 5-8 p.m. | 10 a.m.-5 p.m.; 8 p.m.-5 a.m. |\nAdditional money-saving tips\nTypically, weekends are considered to be off-peak hours for the full day. This means that if you can time your energy-intensive tasks to Saturday and Sunday, you can typically save yourself some money when it comes to your monthly energy bill. Equipped with the knowledge of when peak hours occur and what times are considered to be off-peak hours, you can figure out how to time your use of major appliances to off-peak hours and keep your energy costs down. You can also consider purchasing tools like a solar battery that will provide you with an energy reserve so you don't have to draw from the grid during peak hours.\nYou can also use this knowledge to save more by minimizing the amount of electrical usage that you require during peak hours. You can unplug your appliances that you aren't using, make sure that your thermostat is set properly so your furnace is not running as much during peak hours, and utilize \"sleep\" mode on things like your computer and TV to make sure they aren't using unnecessary electricity that will cost you more. You may also want to consider using motion sensors in your home that can be equipped to interact with other electronic devices. For example, if you aren't home, there is no need for your lights to be on. Setting them to a motion sensor would ensure they won't turn on unless you're home and moving around."

      "text": "Staying cool during the summer is expensive, especially during massive heat waves. When the temperature outside is in triple digits, your electricity bill won't be cheap, but some small tweaks to your air conditioner can make a big difference in cost.\nTo avoid stressing about your energy bill and take some of the pressure off both your AC units and your budget, try setting your thermostat to the right temperature for efficiency. Combine that with small changes like shutting windows during the hottest hours and switching off lights you're not using. Also, closing the blinds can help you keep the heat from getting even more intense.\nA few simple adjustments to how you cool your home can keep the bills from climbing, even during long stretches of hot weather.\nThis is the ideal thermostat temperature for the summer\nIn the summer, the ideal temperature for your thermostat is 75 degrees F to 78 F when you're home, and 80 F when you're away or asleep, Dukes said. The DOE suggests 78 F during the day, 82 F when you're sleeping and 85 F when you're not home.\nMost importantly, you want to make sure your system can handle it. If you notice that the house never gets as cool as your thermostat setting, that probably means your system is not sized well for your home, and you might want to ease up on the cooling. You may also want to check on how well sealed your doors and windows are and how well insulated your home is.\nAir conditioners can only really cool your home to 15 to 20 degrees below the outdoor temperature, so setting the thermostat too low can result in your system running without being effective.\nRead more: Thinking of Buying a Portable AC? 5 Things You Need to Know Before You Do\nThis is the ideal thermostat temperature for the winter\nIn the winter, experts recommend that you set your thermostat to 68 degrees Fahrenheit when you're home, and 60 to 65 degrees when you're asleep or away.\nYou can set it higher, but that will reduce efficiency and lead to higher energy bills. It also depends on the weather outside, Picard said. If it's 20 F outside, maybe don't set your thermostat to 80 F, he advised.\nThen there's the question of changing the temperature at night or when you're not home. The Department of Energy suggests you turn your thermostat back 7 to 10 degrees from its normal setting for 8 hours a day, saying that can save as much as 10% a year on heating and cooling.\nPicard suggested a smaller change: Lower the temperature by just four degrees when you're away or asleep. This means your system won't have to work quite as hard to get back to temperature..\n\"You don't want to have drastic changes in temperature,\" said Mahlie Dukes, franchise owner of WIN Home Inspection in Indiana.\nYou should also get to know your specific heating system. If you notice, for example, that your home never gets up to the temperature you set, that could be a sign that your system is improperly sized for your home, Picard says. And it's a cue to lower your thermostat setting so your HVAC won't constantly be working on overdrive.\nRead more: You Can Actually Save Money by Using Electricity at These Specific Times\nDoes it matter what type of HVAC you have?\nYes and no. The same general temperature recommendations apply regardless of the type of HVAC you have in your home, Picard says.\nBut your results may vary depending on the type and size of your system. Systems that are over- or under-sized for your home will run inefficiently, which leads to higher heating and cooling costs.\nThis is why Picard recommends that you have an HVAC professional inspect and clean your system annually. These pros can tell you how best to use your specific system for the best comfort and efficiency, he said.\nAvoid this common thermostat mistake\nSay your home is quite a bit colder than you'd prefer, and you want it to be perfect now. It may be 65 F inside, and you may want it to be 70 F. Don't set it to 75 in the hopes that it will warm it up faster. Most HVAC units have two settings -- on or off -- and there's no getting to 70 F any faster.\nSet your thermostat to the temperature you want it to be. Setting to a warmer or cooler temperature than you actually desire in the hopes that will speed things along will just result in overcooling or overheating -- and overspending on your energy bills.\nIs your thermostat in the wrong place?\nYour thermostat knows how to set the temperature because it has a thermometer in it. So if your thermostat is in the wrong spot, it won't give you an accurate reading of the temp in your home.\nYou want to avoid having your thermostat in a location that sees frequent changes in temperature or humidity, like in the kitchen or the bathroom. If it's on an exterior wall, it might be more sensitive to outdoor temperature changes.\nInstead, try to position your thermostat on an interior wall in a location like your living room.\nIf your thermostat supports external room sensors, having sensors in other locations, like a bedroom, can help you better regulate the temperature in the rooms where you spend most of your time.\nSave money by setting your thermostat\nReducing your energy bills this year doesn't have to be hard.\n\"There's a huge misconception that in order to be energy efficient, you must be uncomfortable,\" Picard said.\nHomeowners can also look at areas beyond their thermostat. Investing in good insulation, for example, can greatly reduce how much strain you put on your HVAC system.\n\"You'd be surprised how much energy we blow right through our attics,\" Picard said.\nThat annual inspection and maintenance appointment can also help save you money. Picard said buildup within your HVAC system can lead to efficiency losses of up to 10% annually, which you'll see on your energy bill. That's why having it cleaned every year is a good move.\nAnd if you're in the market for a new HVAC system, it's a great time to take stock and make sure what you have fits your specific home."

      "text": "The Energy Star label has been the official US designation for appliances with low energy requirements since the program was first introduced by President George Bush in 1992. The label helps people save money while reducing the electrical burdens on their homes, and now it's at risk under President Donald Trump.\nOn Tuesday, May 6, CNN reported that, under the Trump administration, the Environmental Protection Agency is planning its \"next phase of organizational improvements,\" which includes the elimination of the Energy Star program.\nEnergy Star ratings aren't only for refrigerators and heat pumps -- they also apply to home devices like smart plugs and thermostats. Given how much extra energy smart devices can tap, those ratings are important for managing electricity use around your home.\n\"Heating and cooling your home is likely your largest energy expense,\" said Energy Trust of Oregon when I asked about key savings spots. \"Using a smart thermostat to save a little energy every day can really add up. That's especially true if paired with other energy-saving changes like making sure your home is properly insulated, sealing any gaps or cracks around doors, windows and ducts, or switching to an energy-efficient heat pump.\"\nIf you're looking for energy-saving options like these, here are the best brands and devices with Energy Star certification.\nSmart thermostats\nWhile smart thermostats tend to have LED displays and touchscreens, they're designed to use little power and often turn off when no one is active nearby, saving energy. Models with Energy Star certification include Nest thermostats, Sensi models, some Ecobee thermostats, and thermostats from Honeywell Home.\nBecause thermostats tie into heating and cooling, they not only save electricity in their own right but can also save a whole lot of energy for the rest of your home, too. That makes them an excellent place to start cutting down on energy use.\nLight Fixtures\nLight fixtures refer to lights that are wired into a home, instead of light bulbs that you replace. Smart home brands make several smart fixtures like these with Energy Star ratings, including models from our top picks like Philips, Wiz and many more. Take a look at this Philips recessed light kit to learn more, like how you can control it and change colors with an app.\nLight strings\nLight strings are typically more decorative than fixtures, with smart features that allow them to change between many different color schemes. We have several examples from brands like Philips, Nanoleaf and Govee. You can find Energy Star string lights in most holiday sections or stores, just look for that blue star logo when you buy.\nDehumidifiers\nDehumidifiers are a godsend for wetter climates, but they can use up large amounts of electricity, especially when they have to work for hours at a time. Energy Star models will help keep running costs low, while smart picks from Homelabs, Frigidaire, Carrier, Honeywell Home and more can be controlled with apps or even connected to your smart thermostat for automation.\nAir conditioners\nYou can check out smaller air conditioners on our list of the best portable air conditioners and our top picks for window AC units. When the days get hot, devices like these can use immense amounts of electricity working to keep things cool.\nLook for models with smart features, like the ability to control remotely via app and voice assistants, and Energy Star ratings. Even better, look for models certified \"most efficient\" from brands like Midea, LG, Hisense, Gradient and others.\nSmart TVs\nToday's smart TVs can serve as home hubs and even give you live views through your security cameras on demand. But they can also use a lot of power, especially if left on for long periods of time, along with other entertainment equipment. A smart plug can help with power control, but a work-free start is to look for TVs that have Energy Star ratings. Brands like LG and Samsung are great places to begin your search.\nWater heaters\nWater heaters can be surprisingly smart, too, with tools like Aquanta's controller and similar equipment that monitor and automatically optimize water heating, much like smart thermostats do for temperature. You can enhance the savings even more by choosing an Energy Star model from brands like American Standard, ACIQ, Friedrich and Rheem. Or you can really lean into savings by switching to a tankless or solar water heater.\nEnergy monitoring devices\nEnergy Star also incorporates broad systems called SHEMS or Smart Home Energy Management Systems, which use technology to unite many Energy Star devices (thermostats, lighting, smart meters, monitor add-ons, security systems, etc.) and put them all under one automated energy use plan to save electricity.\nTechnically, SHEMS are turnkey systems you'd discuss with an authorized smart home installer. However, you can make your own version with an Emporia Energy Monitoring device and associated Emporia smart plugs, or look up smart meter options with your local utility.\nEV chargers\nFinally, if you have a home EV charger or are interested in installing one, note that these garage devices can also have Energy Star ratings. EV chargers from brands (AC and DC) like Schumacher, Pando Electric, ChargePoint, Legrand, Tesla, EvoCharge and many others can qualify to help you save even more.\nFor more smart money management, review how smart thermostats can save you energy, how to use a smart home to save on electricity bills and how home security can give you discounts every month."

      "text": "Autumn is almost here, and along with dropping temperatures you may see your electricity bill free fall once you turn off the AC. However, temperature alone isn't the best way to lower your utility bills. This CNET survey found that 78% of US adults are stressed about the cost of home energy use. If you've been trying to figure out the best way to save money and keep to your budget, you're not alone.\nThe good news is that there are simple, expert-backed strategies that can help cut those expenses without sacrificing comfort. By making a few small changes, you can lower your monthly costs and keep your home running more efficiently year-round.\nThere are plenty of ways you can still save on gas, electricity and water in the coming months. Even small habits, like unplugging unused appliances, washing your clothes a different way, cooking with some energy-saving appliances or setting your thermostat to the right temperature can help save money and make your home more energy-efficient.\nDon't miss any of our unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add CNET as a preferred Google source on Chrome.\nHere are eight steps you can take to start saving electricity, gas, water -- and cash. For additional money-saving tips, check out more on how to weatherstrip your home to save on bills and a simple home upgrade that can help you save on summer cooling costs.\n1. Get an electricity audit\nMany electric companies offer a free audit, where they do a room-by-room examination of your home and look at your electricity bills to help determine where you're wasting energy. You can follow the recommendations to help reduce your electric bill. If you can't get an audit for free, you might still be able to qualify it under the energy efficient home improvement credit and recoup the costs during tax season.\nEven if your electric company doesn't provide this service, you can easily perform a DIY home energy audit using the US Department of Energy website's instructions.\n2. Adjust your thermostat\nOne of the simplest ways to reduce your electricity bill is to adjust your thermostat. According to the Department of Energy, you can save as much as 10% on your heating and cooling costs by adjusting your thermostat by 7 to 10 degrees for 8 hours per day. In other words, keep it a bit warmer in the summer and a bit cooler in the winter.\nA simple way to do this is to adjust your thermostat when you're either asleep or away from home. If you have a smart thermostat, you can preset your thermostat to adjust during these hours so you don't forget.\n3. Turn down your water heater\nMany water heater manufacturers set thermostats at 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 C). But in reality, most households only need it set at a maximum of 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Setting your water heater to a lower temperature can save hundreds of dollars a year.\nAdjusting a water heater's temperature is a quick and easy fix. The thermostat dial on your water heater is likely near the bottom of the tank on the electric or gas control valve. Be sure to check the owner's manual for instructions to adjust it -- and if you have any questions, consult a professional technician.\n4. Turn off and unplug what you aren't using\nBy leaving things around your house plugged in and turned on when you aren't using them, you're driving up your electric bill unnecessarily.\nYou can start by turning off lights when you aren't in the room or when it's light enough outside to rely solely on natural light. Multiply your light bulb's wattage by what your electricity provider charges per kilowatt to find out how much you're saving. That amount only increases with the wattage of the bulb. While it doesn't seem like much, it can add up over time.\nYou can also save money by unplugging appliances you aren't using. Phantom energy, the energy your appliances use when they're plugged in but not turned on, can cost an average of $100 per year.\n5. Use your dishwasher\nIt might sound counterintuitive to suggest running an appliance to save on your electricity bill. And yes, there was a time where dishwashers used far more water than they do today. But the Department of Energy regulates how much water modern dishwashers can use. Any dishwasher manufactured since 2013 is limited to using 5 gallons of water. If it's a compact size dishwasher, it's limited to 3.5 gallons.\nYou might think that surely you use less than 5 gallons of water to hand-wash your dishes. But the US Geological Survey estimates that it takes anywhere from 9 to 27 gallons of water to hand-wash a load of dishes. (If you're curious, we've also got a tip on how to load your dishwasher the right way.)\n6. Take advantage of off-peak rates\nElectricity use tends to be higher during certain times of the day and the year. First, demand is higher in the winter and summer when people are running heaters and air conditioners. It's also higher during the daytime and evening hours.\nSome electricity companies offer time-of-use plans, increasing rates during peak hours and decreasing them during off-peak hours. If you have one of these plans, you can save money by running large appliances like your dishwasher and washing machine early in the morning or late at night.\n7. Change your air filters\nYour air filter helps to catch any dirt, dust, pet hair and more, preventing it from making its way into your HVAC. When you don't change your air filters regularly enough, this debris gets into your HVAC system and bogs it down, reducing its efficiency. According to the Department of Energy, replacing your filters on schedule can lower your air conditioner's energy consumption by anywhere from 5% to 15%.\n8. More ways to save on your bills\nThere are many steps, big and small, that you can take to reduce your consumption and save money on your bills. The Department of Energy has an entire section of its website devoted to providing tips to help you save on energy. And while plenty of them come with a price tag, there are many more just like those on this list that you can do for free.\nFor more, check out the ceiling fan trick that can help your house stay cooler, and you can also explore our solar cheat sheet.\nMore energy and money saving tips\n- Want to Save Money?
