      "summary": "The Broward County State Attorney's Office has decided not to pursue misdemeanor battery charges against Cleveland Browns rookie running back Quinshon Judkins, citing a lack of video evidence, independent witnesses, and a delayed report from the victim. Judkins was arrested on July 12 for allegedly striking a woman during an incident on July 7, but the Assistant State Attorney concluded there was no reasonable likelihood of conviction. As a result, Judkins remains unsigned and unable to participate in training camp while the NFL continues to review the situation.",
