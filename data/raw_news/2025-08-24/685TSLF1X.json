  "title": "The Bruno Fernandes Paradox: Why Man Utd\u2019s best player presents a tactical dilemma",
  "description": "The Portuguese's deployment in central midfield does not bring out the best in him or his team",
  "content": "Before attempting to diagnose whatever the problem is with Manchester United this week, you have to remember two things. Firstly, there is definitely not just one problem at this football club. And secondly, however many there might be, Bruno Fernandes is not one of them.\n\nIt is always worth stressing that, especially on these rare occasions when he is less of a help and more of a hindrance to his side\u2019s chances of winning, as he was at Craven Cottage on Sunday.\n\nTake last season, for example. It was arguably Fernandes\u2019 best for United, certainly since his first full campaign, but it did not start well. He had four assists by the October international break and three had come against either Southampton or Barnsley. His first goal came once Erik ten Hag had been sacked.\n\nThen, as now, the safe bet was that Fernandes would come good and eventually, that bet paid off. But then, unlike now, he was not playing as part of a two-man midfield.\n\nIt would be easy to pin Sunday\u2019s deflating 1-1 draw and performance at Fulham on Fernandes given his role in the game\u2019s two most decisive moments: his first-half penalty miss, ballooned high over the crossbar; and his failure to track Emile Smith Rowe\u2019s run as he arrived late to convert the 73rd-minute equaliser for the hosts.\n\nWhat was more worrying for the weeks and months to come, though, was the ease with which Fulham were able to repeatedly overrun United\u2019s midfield: a midfield composed of Fernandes and Casemiro, then Fernandes and Mason Mount, and later Fernandes and Manuel Ugarte. But always Fernandes.\n\nThat was Marco Silva\u2019s gameplan from the off, as Alex Iwobi later confirmed. \u201cWe knew that we would be able to get behind their two midfielders and that their centre-backs would want to jump,\u201d he told Sky Sports post-match. \u201cWe exploited that today.\u201d\n\nRuben Amorim said Fernandes\u2019 penalty miss was partly a result of him having \u201cso much responsibility\u201d, but he has entrusted his captain with more and more responsibility over the past nine months, particularly from a tactical perspective.\n\nAmorim began deploying Fernandes deeper last season to help with United\u2019s uncertain build-up play, but then his influence would be missed nearer the opposition\u2019s penalty box.\n\nMatheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo were signed, in part, to share that burden. But an overlooked aspect of United\u2019s summer business has been how two of the only players who demonstrated an ability to perform within Amorim\u2019s system have been all but locked into unnatural positions to accommodate it.\n\nFew would argue that threats like Cunha and Mbeumo were not necessary after a Premier League record low of 44 league goals last season, but there was always a risk that moving Fernandes deeper and Amad to right wing-back would nerf what little creativity United had last term.\n\nYes, poor finishing cost Amorim dearly \u2014 no top-flight side under-performed their expected goals by more \u2014 and so proven goal-scorers were necessary, but a total xG of just 52.6 was still bottom-half worthy and demonstrated that fashioning chances was an issue as well.\n\nAnd it has remained an issue so far, two games into a new campaign. United piled up the shots against Arsenal last weekend, but it was hard to classify any of them as clear-cut chances. As dominant as they were, they rarely looked like they would make their superiority tell.\n\nA week later, apart from during a bright opening quarter of an hour when Cunha was unlucky not to open the scoring, Amorim\u2019s side were otherwise blunted by Fulham. Silva dismissed the sum total of United\u2019s attacking threat in the second half as \u201cset pieces, nothing more\u201c. It was a fair comment.\n\nThe only \u2018big chance\u2019 that United created on Sunday, as defined by Opta, was from a long boot downfield by goalkeeper Altay Bayindir. Fernandes, by contrast, set up just one shot on goal, for Cunha in the very first minute, and even then only from range.\n\nThe United captain\u2019s deeper position \u2014 as shown in his touch map below \u2014 becomes hard to justify if it results in such a creative drop-off. It becomes even less defensible when it threatens to stunt the development of a potentially special talent raised through the academy.\n\nKobbie Mainoo was an unused substitute once again on Sunday, sitting out for the second consecutive game after being overlooked against Arsenal too. Why? Simple. \u201cHe\u2019s fighting for the position now with Bruno,\u201d Amorim later confirmed.\n\nHe had not considered a Fernandes-Mainoo partnership at any point at Craven Cottage, then, and seemingly will not in future. Not that he necessarily should. It is not hard to imagine that midfield pairing being just as easily overrun as the others Amorim tried on Sunday.\n\nBut Fernandes and Mainoo\u2019s skillsets are different enough to question why they are competing for the same role in the first place, and whether said role truly suits either. United fitting their best player, their most promising academy graduate and a new, \u00a3200m front three into the same line-up suddenly looks entirely impractical. At least in this system.\n\nBut if United chose this path by signing two big-money No 10s this summer, so too did Fernandes by turning down Al Hilal\u2019s offer to play in the Saudi Pro League.\n\nOver the weekend, reports that another SPL outfit \u2014 Al-Ittihad \u2014 are considering a move for the 30-year-old began to emerge, but United do not expect Fernandes to leave before next Monday\u2019s deadline, while sources in Saudi Arabia are equally sceptical that the links have much substance.\n\nFernandes made his decision to stay at Old Trafford at the very start of this transfer window and there is currently no reason to believe he will not end it as a United player.\n\nIn which case, United need to devise a way to accentuate his many strengths and mask his few weaknesses. That may mean finding the right midfield partnership, or rethinking this deeper role altogether. What\u2019s certain is that Amorim already has plenty of problems to solve without turning his best and most important player into one, too.",

  "summary": "Manchester United's best player, Bruno Fernandes, has been criticised for his performance at Craven Cottage, leading to a 1-1 draw and a poor performance at Fulham. This is due to Fernandes' role in the game's decisive moments, including a first-half penalty miss and a failure to track Emile Smith Rowe's run. Despite this, he has been given more responsibility by manager Ruben Amorim and has been deployed deeper to help with United\u2019s build-up play, but his influence is often missed. The team's performance has also been criticised, with Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo being all but locked into unnatural positions to accommodate this. This could potentially hinder the development of a potentially special talent through the academy.",

      "text": "It was Sir Alex Ferguson who talked about \u201cfoggy memories\u201d when it came to football, nostalgia and how it worked against some of the players who were trying to emulate Manchester United\u2019s old glories.\n\u201cI do it myself,\u201d the most successful manager in British football history explained, shortly before retiring in 2013 with a 13th Premier League title. \u201dPeople say that this is not as good as the teams of the past, but sometimes there are foggy recollections of teams of the past.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nWe all do it to some degree, no matter who we support. Our heroes are our heroes and, in football, nostalgia has always been the file that smooths out the rough edges from the good old days. But it is worth keeping this in mind when the subject turns to Bruno Fernandes, as it often does, and the not entirely straightforward challenge of trying to understand where he sits among the great and good who have worn the club\u2019s colours.\n- Follow live coverage of the Europa League final between Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United\nNot that high, if you listen to Roy Keane, a truly great ex-United captain who uses his role as a television pundit to speak about Fernandes at times with a look of near-revulsion on his face.\nAnd, yes, there are plenty of others who have questioned Fernandes during his five and a half seasons at the club. Is he exceptionally talented? Of course. But can he be irritatingly petulant? Absolutely. Not your usual United captain, perhaps? Not if you remember Keane or Bryan Robson or various others who have worn that armband with distinction.\nWould Fernandes get into a best-ever United XI? Not unless you were being exceedingly generous (or downright silly). At a club with United\u2019s history, he probably would not have the credentials to get into a second-best XI. Or even a third or fourth.\nUltimately, though, there is a whole raft of statistics \u2014 or you could just back what you see with your eyes \u2014 to make it clear why the modern-day United should be grateful to have him.\nAnd Ferguson is right: people do have foggy memories when it comes to their favourite players from the past.\nContrary to what you might have heard, Eric Cantona did not sprinkle his precious magic across every football pitch. Ryan Giggs, brilliant though he was, had plenty of occasions when he could not beat his man or find a cross. Paul Scholes? What a player, what a joy to watch, but don\u2019t assume he was exceptional every single time he wore that shirt. And the same goes for Wayne Rooney, Cristiano Ronaldo and pretty much all the former United players who will be remembered, deservedly, as genuine greats.\nAdvertisement\nWhen Arthur Hopcraft, one of the doyens of British sports writing, wrote his 1968 book, The Football Man, he devoted an entire chapter to Bobby Charlton. He called it \u2018Eulogy\u2019 and those of us who are too young to have seen Charlton in action might imagine that a player with his level of status and achievement \u2014 a 1966 World Cup winner with England, no less \u2014 never had a bad game or a period when his form was questioned by Hopcraft and his press-box colleagues. But, of course, he did.\n\u201cHe is the player who may disappoint sometimes with a ragged, off-form performance, and yet over the years stays clear and bright in the memory,\u201d writes Hopcraft.\n\u201cThe persistent complaint I have heard made against Charlton, the one which keeps him out of the lists when some people name the handful of the world\u2019s greatest players, is that he avoids the fury of the game, that where the hacking and elbowing are fiercest, Charlton is not to be found. But this is like dismissing Dickens from the world\u2019s great literature because he never went to gaol for throwing bricks at politicians.\u201d\nWhat all these players have in common, unlike Fernandes, is that they belonged to brilliant United teams who lived up to Charlton\u2019s expression, at the age of 21, that playing football at Old Trafford was like walking on stage in a theatre of dreams.\nFernandes, in stark contrast, has given his best years to a club enduring their worst years.\nRuben Amorim\u2019s side are 16th in a 20-club league and, with one game of their domestic campaign to go, the 20-time English champions have not even reached 40 points, which was once regarded as the safety mark that would ensure a club avoided dropping through the trapdoor into the second tier.\nIt is United\u2019s worst performance since they were last relegated in 1974 and, with that kind of backdrop, it is hard to think Fernandes will be remembered in future years as a bona fide club legend. Respect? Yes. Affection? Of course. But legend? That feels like too much of a stretch, perhaps, when the whole of football is rubbernecking in United\u2019s direction.\nThe paradox is that this could also be the man who lifts the Europa League trophy on Wednesday, to go with the FA Cup he helped United win last season and the League Cup from the year before that.\nThis is one of the strange things about United: the post-Ferguson years have brought more indignities, lows and cheek-reddening embarrassments than they would care to remember. Yet if they beat Tottenham Hotspur in Bilbao, it will be the second time they have won the Europa League in eight years and, astonishingly, their sixth major trophy in a decade. What\u2019s been a grim period for United would be, for most clubs, a golden one.\nAdvertisement\nFernandes has been there since January 2020 and, to give him his due, there have been five separate seasons, including the current one, when he has finished with double figures for both goals and assists \u2014 something no other United player in the Premier League era has done more than once.\nHis 27 goals make him the third-highest scorer in the Europa League since it replaced the old UEFA Cup in 2009, three behind Radamel Falcao and seven short of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. And who has its third-most assists with 24? That would be the wearer of United\u2019s No 8 shirt, too.\nVery good, you might think, but what about the Champions League? Remember the times when United, with all their haughty ambitions, used to look down on the clunky Thursday-Sunday routine of Europe\u2019s second-tier competition?\nMany of us do. Is it fair, though, to hold that against Fernandes when the evidence suggests he has been let down by his surroundings?\nDid you know he features in the top 10 of the list of footballers who have covered the most distance in the Premier League this season? Or that he had some of the best statistics across Europe\u2019s top five domestic leagues for tackles, interceptions and winning back the ball?\nTo say he does not understand what hard graft means, or that he does not put in a captain\u2019s shift, is simply not backed up by the numbers.\nSo why so much beef? Well, the most legitimate criticism is that, positionally, he can be indisciplined, too often nowhere to be seen on the many occasions when opponents take advantage of the big, open spaces that appear in United\u2019s midfield. His habits of arm-flapping and always chattering away in the referee\u2019s ear can rile everyone. There are also times when he does make the wrong choice or loses the ball in positions that leave his team vulnerable.\nAdvertisement\nOthers might argue it is a form of bravery that he backs himself to make the kind of decisive passes that, in another era, had Ferguson referring to Cantona as \u201cthe can-opener\u201d, slicing open opposition defences.\nWould Fernandes get into Liverpool\u2019s current team? It is a good debate and, yes, the chances are he probably would. Manchester City\u2019s? They would love to have a player with his ability to help fill the void left by Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s imminent departure. Fernandes is, in short, a terrific footballer: the only player besides Ronaldo and David de Gea to win United\u2019s player-of-the-season award (established in 1988) four times.\nIt is not difficult, therefore, to understand why the people at the top of the club do not want to contemplate the idea that Fernandes might be tempted by the mega-riches on offer in Saudi Arabia.\nThe links with current Saudi champions Al Hilal are genuine, and that should be the real concern for everyone at Old Trafford \u2014 not whether Fernandes is overrated, underrated or secretly wants to scrape his studs down Keane\u2019s shins.\nFernandes will turn 31 in September and it was inevitable that at some stage he would come to the attention of a club, or clubs, from the Saudi Pro League.\nYet the bottom line here is that United are one win away from entering next season\u2019s Champions League, albeit through the back door, and everyone associated with the club should hope that would be enough for the Portugal international to bat away any thoughts of leaving. Because, can you imagine where this once-mighty football club would be without him?\n(Top photo: Carl Recine/Getty Images)"

      "text": "Two games into the Premier League season and Manchester United remain winless despite promising performances.\nAt Craven Cottage, usually a happy hunting ground for the visitors, substitute Emile Smith Rowe denied Ruben Amorim\u2019s men three points with an equaliser in a hard-fought 1-1 draw.\nRodrigo Muniz scored an unfortunate own goal to give United the lead, as a Leny Yoro header from a Bryan Mbeumo corner deflected in off the striker in the 58th minute. The goal spared Bruno Fernandes\u2019 blushes after the United captain had wildly missed a first-half penalty.\nAdvertisement\nBut with his first touch, Smith Rowe came off the bench to brilliantly guide Alex Iwobi\u2019s fine cross home. It was a deserved goal for a Fulham team that finished the stronger of the two as Marco Silva\u2019s substitutions made an impact.\nCarl Anka and Mark Carey analyse the action.\nHow did Fernandes miss his penalty so badly?\nUnited moved the ball sharply, working it quickly into the channels where one of Mason Mount, Matheus Cunha or Mbeumo was able to make it stick. All that was missing was the opening goal.\nThat breakthrough seemed a matter of routine in the 33rd minute when referee Chris Kavanagh was called over to the pitchside monitor to review some agricultural defending on a Fernandes corner. Replays showed Calvin Bassey throwing Mount to the ground before the corner was delivered and the penalty was consequently awarded. Luke Shaw was also grappling with Muniz in the box, but the VAR was not reviewing that.\nFernandes went for a stutter-step run-up, but did not use his usual hop before striking the ball, opting for a powerful effort aimed for the top left corner. He struck the ball while leaning back, an unusual error from the typically reliable penalty-taker.\nThe United captain\u2019s regular routine appeared to be disrupted by the presence of the referee, who was in proximity to Fernandes before the midfielder started his run-up.\nThe referee\u2019s attempt to walk around the player during his run-up saw Fernandes inadvertently back into him. Fernandes was visibly frustrated, and it may have thrown him from his usual rhythm, but it was nonetheless a bad miss.\nSpeaking to NBC, Fernandes said: \u201cLike everyone, you have your own routine. I was preparing myself to get the penalty and that got a little bit on my nerves. But it is not because of that that I missed the penalty. I missed the penalty because I kicked very badly the ball. I took it too under and the ball ended up going over the bar.\u201d\nCarl Anka\nMount gives Amorim a good problem to have\nIt is widely discussed that Mason Mount is a player every manager loves.\nHis ability to stitch together attacks and provide disciplined defensive displays was on show last week against Arsenal, and the same was true against Fulham. Beyond his positive performances in the short term, it prompts an important, wider question for the season: which of United\u2019s new attacking signings is going to miss out as a consequence?\nFor now, Benjamin Sesko needs more time to get up to speed with his new squad, so two consecutive games starting on the bench are to be expected. However, the calls for Sesko, Mbeumo and Cunha to start together will be just around the corner, with fans likely to be clamouring to see their shiny new upgrades on the field at the same time.\nAdvertisement\nThe balance Mount offers to the team cannot be denied. Particularly accounting for Amorim\u2019s 3-4-2-1 system, there were times last season when the midfield duo looked dangerously overrun with the spaces far too wide to cover defensively. With Mount in the side, Amorim has a player who is comfortable tucking in to plug gaps out of possession, while still offering the technical quality to progress United up the field when his side are on the attack.\nIt is a good problem for Amorim to have, but with no European football this season, it will be harder to keep all of his star players happy all at once if Mount continues his strong start to the season.\nMark Carey\nSilva\u2019s case for new signings strengthened\nWith Fulham looking rather blunt in attack after the hour mark, Marco Silva looked to his bench. The arrival of Harry Wilson and Antonee Robinson was soon followed by Smith Rowe and Raul Jimenez \u2014 all of whom injected energy into the home side that led to Smith Rowe\u2019s excellent equaliser, meeting Iwobi\u2019s cross with a well-timed finish.\nSmith Rowe showed his eye for a late run into the box multiple times last season, knowing that his team-mates rarely need a second invitation to cross the ball. For context, no side averaged more than Fulham\u2019s 17.6 open-play crosses per 90 last season.\nIt would be crass to suggest that Silva would be happy that Fulham are still chasing their first victory of the season, but with the transfer window still open, it might strengthen his case that his side still needs reinforcements after a quiet summer of incomings.\n\u201cAt this stage of last season, we had two/three players in,\u201d Silva said at his press conference on Friday. \u201cThis season, we had a plan; the plan has fallen through. It\u2019s our fault, not active at all. We cannot be pleased.\u201d\nOn the one hand, there is plenty to be said about having a settled side going into a new season. Silva is excellent at managing his squad and making impactful substitutions, with 19 of Fulham\u2019s goals being scored by players from off the bench since the start of last season.\nAdvertisement\nOn the other hand, new signings can provide added freshness, competition for places, and greater quality as Silva looks to build on last season. Depending on Fulham\u2019s output this campaign, you can duly pick your narrative accordingly.\nMark Carey\nSesko will need time to acclimatise\nThe 53rd minute saw Amorim shake things up. Off came Casemiro and Amad to be replaced by Sesko and Diogo Dalot. That led to Mount dropping into the central midfield pivot, while Dalot offered some defensive security at right wing-back.\nBut Sesko, unfortunately, didn\u2019t get many shooting opportunities, finishing the game with 15 touches and zero shots. Marco Silva\u2019s decision to match United\u2019s 3-4-2-1 in phases meant the 22-year-old was unable to go hunting in the right half-space, as he did last week in the 1-0 loss against Arsenal. Instead, Sesko spent much of his appearance standing between Joachim Andersen and Bassey, trying to peel off Andersen and attack Bassey\u2019s blind side when the ball was funnelled out wide.\nFulham\u2019s touch-tight approach when defending Mbeumo (he only had six touches of the ball between the 45th and 70th minutes) limited the creative supply to the striker. In the final 10 minutes, Sesko tried his best with the limited chances his team manufactured. But while the away section chanted \u201cAttack, attack, attack attack attack!\u201d, United\u2019s players struggled to get the ball into the final third.\nWhen out of possession, Sesko could be found checking his shoulders to see if Cunha and Mbeumo would join his attempts to press. Amorim\u2019s new front three have plenty of running power and technical trickery, but they will need time to synchronise. Two games in, and we\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of Sesko\u2019s talents.\nCarl Anka\nWhat did Amorim say?\n\u201cIt was a tough match. I think when we scored the goal we forget about maintaining the way we should play \u2014 we were just thinking about maintaining the result,\u201d he told reporters.\n\u201cWe want to win so bad we forget about maintaining possession, push the opponent, we just gave a little bit of the game to Fulham. We started really well, until the goal I think we were a good team. We can do better. After the goal, I think we were just thinking about maintaining the advantage. We cannot do that.\n\u201cWe are going to score goals because we are creating so many chances and that is the important thing. Then we just have to move on.\u201d\nWhat did Silva say?\n\u201cThe players that came on were brilliant,\u201d said Silva, per Fulham\u2019s official website. \u201cLast week was the same and last season it was the story of the season.\n\u201cHarry Wilson had a great pre-season and today he started on the bench, but a massive impact from him. Raul started last week and, of course, Emile, helped the team last week with the build-up for the goal and this afternoon he scored.

We didn\u2019t give many spaces to them and they only created moments from set pieces. They scored, but it was a great reaction from the boys in a difficult moment of the game.

      "text": "It\u2019s easy to get annoyed at Bruno Fernandes.\nAs an on-pitch presence, he\u2019s not especially likeable. His face seems permanently set to \u2018complaint\u2019 mode. He nags at referees. There was that undignified episode when Manchester United lost 7-0 to Liverpool a couple of years ago and he essentially threw a tantrum on the pitch.\nAdvertisement\nBut, as much as anything, that just illustrates something we all know: that on-pitch manners do not necessarily maketh the man. You hear plenty of stories about Bruno being a good guy, which at the very least balances the apparent petulance, most notably his attempt to pay for United staff to attend the FA Cup final after their free travel and accommodation were nixed as part of Big Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s cost-cutting drive.\nHe also tends to be the one who \u2018fronts up\u2019 to the media after United defeats, when most of the time he\u2019s the least of their problems. That might feel minor, but doing it means one of his younger, more junior, probably struggling team-mates doesn\u2019t have to.\nFernandes currently plays for a particularly bleak type of football institution: one that\u2019s rich and high profile, and thus commands a lot of attention, but one that can\u2019t win games, and is run by people who seem intent on flushing any goodwill they might have down the toilet through redundancies, price rises, cutting charitable grants and whatever else they have planned in the name of austerity.\nThis is a club that has been carried on the pitch by their best player and captain for longer than he probably cares to remember, and one that you have little confidence is going to turn things around any time soon.\nIn short, you wouldn\u2019t blame Fernandes for desperately grabbing at any plausible life raft that happens to float past.\nWhich brings us to his decision to turn down Al Hilal this week.\n\u201cIt would have been an easy move,\u201d Fernandes said at a Portugal press conference on Monday evening.\n\u201cI had Ruben Neves and Joao Cancelo there, two people I have a great friendship with. But I want to stay at the highest level, play in big competitions, because I still feel capable. I want to keep being happy, I\u2019m still very passionate about this sport, and I\u2019m happy with my decision.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nFernandes was reportedly offered a contract that would have more than doubled his already significant wages to move to Saudi Arabia, with Al Hilal also apparently prepared to pay a \u00a380million ($108m) transfer fee to extract him.\nMost United fans will naturally be delighted. Not only do they keep their best player, but they will be protected from the dispiriting prospect of their club probably frittering away a crucial windfall; of all the clubs you would trust to cash in on their star man and use the money to responsibly beef up their squad, United are at the bottom of the list.\nBut the rest of us in Britain, Europe, the non-Saudi world, should be pleased, too.\nIt is, on the most basic level, refreshing to see someone have the conviction to turn down that amount of money. I can\u2019t confidently say that I would. If you can, then fair play to you.\nFernandes\u2019 representatives met with Al Hilal, so we can assume that he didn\u2019t turn the offer down on moral grounds, otherwise he might not have even entertained it. It\u2019s also true that it\u2019s easier to reject that kind of approach when you already earn \u00a3250,000-a-week at one of the world\u2019s biggest clubs. Fernandes is not exactly hard up.\nBut it\u2019s still pleasing that a player has not signed up to the Saudi project; someone of standing has rejected being a representative of the ultimate purpose of their move into sport, whether you call it sportswashing, soft power or something less charitable.\nThe players that have agreed to move to the Saudi Pro League so far have generally fallen into three categories: ageing legends in decline, like Cristiano Ronaldo or Sadio Mane; excellent-but-not-quite-elite types in roughly their peak years, like Ruben Neves, Ivan Toney or Aleksandar Mitrovic; and relative journeymen, such as your Daniel Podences or Georges-Kevin N\u2019Koudous.\nAdvertisement\nWhat they haven\u2019t really yet managed to snag is a genuinely elite player at the peak of his powers from one of the elite clubs; a player who could probably slot happily into most top European teams and who represents a legitimate loss to one of the \u2018legacy\u2019 leagues.\nYou could argue Karim Benzema (who was the reigning Ballon d\u2019Or holder when he joined Al Ittihad) or Riyad Mahrez (fresh from Manchester City\u2019s treble-winning season) fit into this category, but they were 35 and 32 respectively when they made their moves. Fernandes is 30, but still performing as if in his prime, so would probably have been the SPL\u2019s biggest coup from a purely football perspective, if not a PR one.\nAs it is, one of the Premier League\u2019s best players is staying in the Premier League, and will continue playing at a level of competition that befits his ability. Whether it\u2019s for that reason, or a sign that not everybody can be bought, or that not everyone can be persuaded to represent state project \u2014 take your pick \u2014 this should be celebrated.\nThis is all said with the caveat that Fernandes is staying\u2026 for now. We have been in this position before, where someone turns down a move to Saudi Arabia initially, only to reconsider. Steven Gerrard, who rejected an offer to become Al Ettifaq manager in June 2023 then joined them the following month, springs to mind. This article might look pretty silly if Fernandes flip-flops. He also isn\u2019t necessarily staying at United: should a competent European team make him and United an attractive offer, he may still leave.\nWe also shouldn\u2019t pretend he\u2019s a saint who is sticking around purely for altruistic reasons, for the history of a proud football club that he simply can\u2019t abandon. He has made this decision for essentially the same reason that all of those players who have moved to Saudi: because it is in the best interests of him and his family. If a better alternative presents itself, he will probably take it, and rightly so.\nBut for now, Bruno Fernandes is not moving to Saudi Arabia, and we should welcome that fact.\n(Top photo: Bruno Fernandes with Manchester United in Kuala Lumpur; by Annice Lyn/Manchester United via Getty Images)"

      "text": "Arsenal began their attempt to go one better in the Premier League title race this season with a 1-0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford thanks to a \u2018new\u2019 set-piece routine.\nAvram Glazer was in attendance at Old Trafford and saw the team he co-owns line up without fit-again goalkeeper Andre Onana and striker Rasmus Hojlund, who The Athletic revealed has been told he faces a challenge to get minutes under Amorim. For Arsenal, 15-year-old midfielder Max Dowman travelled with the team but was not in the matchday squad.\nAdvertisement\nAmorim chose Altay Bayindir to start in goal but he was powerless to stop Riccardo Calafiori heading in Declan Rice\u2019s corner on 13 minutes. United responded well and Patrick Dorgu hit a post before David Raya saved superbly low down with his fingertips to deny Matheus Cunha.\nNew Arsenal striker Viktor Gyokeres, signed for an initial \u00a355m ($75m) from Sporting CP, played an hour but struggled to make an impact, while Benjamin Sesko, United\u2019s new striker signed from RB Leipzig as part of a new \u00a3200m attack appeared off the bench for the last 25 minutes.\nRaya pushed away Bryan Mbeumo\u2019s header and then Sesko headed wide after the ball was recycled as Manchester United pushed for an equaliser but Arsenal held firm and are now unbeaten in their past 15 Premier League away games.\nThe Athletic\u2019s Carl Anka, Art de Roche and Ahmed Walid break down the key talking points.\nHow does Arsenal\u2019s \u2018new\u2019 free-kick routine work?\nIt may be a new season, but that doesn\u2019t mean Arsenal will stop being inventive from set pieces.\nNo team has scored more goals from set pieces, excluding penalties, (71) than them since the start of the 2021-22 season, when specialist coach Nicolas Jover arrived from Manchester City. Liverpool (64) and Manchester City (60) have the next highest tallies in the league.\nThe routine with five players starting at the edge of the box just before the corner is taken is not necessarily brand-new. They first trialled it against Tottenham Hotspur in their third game of pre-season this summer, and they benefited in their first corner of the season.\nThe two runners from those five (Gabriel Martinelli and Martin Zubimendi) helped cause more chaos centrally as the ball was delivered. Mason Mount should have dealt with William Saliba better, getting the wrong side of him and Bayindir, but all that meant less attention was paid to Calafiori at the back post.\nArsenal did score from the back post at a corner in pre-season, Christian Norgaard against Villarreal, but it was from a different routine. Either way, ensuring that space is free can often be more dangerous than what is going on in the centre of the goal.\nArsenal taking the lead from a set piece probably should not be a massive surprise either, considering where their goals against Manchester United came last season.\nArt de Roche\nWhat did Gyokeres do on his Premier League debut?\nViktor Gyokeres lasted just under an hour on his Premier League debut, which was somewhat reminiscent of his first start for Arsenal against Villarreal in pre-season.\nThe 27-year-old showed a willingness to make an impact but was just off in his execution at the vital moments. Matthijs de Ligt started on top in their individual battle but the Swede grew into the game and managed to give Arsenal an outlet at moments when they needed it.\nAdvertisement\nAs was the case in his pre-season starts, his runs in behind were not selfish ones. He often looked for his fellow attackers, Martinelli and Bukayo Saka, but overhit his passes and failed to take real advantage of the situations he was in.\nThat subpar decision-making was not just a theme of Gyokeres\u2019 performance, but Arsenal\u2019s as a team. From the opening exchanges, it seemed like Arteta\u2019s side struggled to get up to pace with Manchester United, and were therefore playing in a more reactive than proactive way \u2014 even if they had some nice attacking moments.\nThey will count themselves lucky for Raya, whose saves in both halves allowed them to just about start the season with a win and a clean sheet.\nKai Havertz wasn\u2019t amazing in Gyokeres\u2019 place, even with the fouls he won. So for Leeds United at the Emirates, Arsenal\u2019s next game, the Swede shouldn\u2019t have to worry about his starting spot.\nArt de Roche\nDo Manchester United have a goalkeeper problem?\nAmorim said before the game that Onana had \u201crecovered\u201d from his hamstring injury but that he had decided on other options, choosing Bayindir to start.\nThe 27-year-old has had a strange two seasons in England. Where many clubs use their second-choice goalkeeper in the domestic cups, Bayindir is more of a classic deputy, mostly stepping in when Onana is injured, as he was in pre-season, or in need of a break.\nPart of that is down to Bayindir\u2019s more rudimentary passing ability and his weaknesses when defending corners. Last season saw him concede an Olympic goal and more than one team have opted to pack the six-yard box to limit his movement before a set piece is delivered.\nArsenal\u2019s opening goal had an impressive setup to it, but it also owed a debt to Bayindir\u2019s inability to wrestle past Saliba to get a proper handle of the ball as it was whipped in.\n\u201cThe goalkeeper has got to be stronger,\u201d said former Manchester United defender Gary Neville on Sky Sports commentary. \u201cHe will complain that he was fouled. He has a player in front of him; there is a lot of pushing and pulling, but he has to be stronger.\u201d\nFormer Manchester City and England goalkeeper Joe Hart said Bayindir should have used his left arm to push off Saliba, while using his right to punch the ball away. To be a successful Premier League No 1, a goalkeeper should know when to scrap as well as make saves. Bayindir\u2019s comparative timidness \u2014 coupled with United\u2019s inability to protect him on set pieces \u2014 mean the team has a soft underbelly at crucial moments.\nAdvertisement\nUnfortunately for Amorim, this is not a problem that gets solved if he brings back Onana, who has trained only three times with the team since regaining fitness. The Cameroon international has also been vulnerable against teams that pack the six-yard box, and his ability to make saves has often been erratic.\nDoes this mean United should re-prioritise a goalkeeper signing before the summer window closes? The Athletic has reported that the club are unlikely to sign another goalkeeper unless one of Bayindir or Onana are sold. United fans may want a move for Gianluigi Donnarumma, but he too has difficulty when defending corners and high balls, despite his 1.96 m (6ft 5in) frame. Emiliano Mart\u00ednez excels in this regard, but it is thought Aston Villa are unlikely to sanction a sale for less than \u00a340million ($54.2m).\nUnited have a confidence issue in and around their penalty area. Amorim may have to be bold when looking to fix it.\nCarl Anka\nWhat was better about United?\nSince Amorim\u2019s arrival in November 2024, Manchester United have looked like they lack the physicality to operate in the 3-4-3 shape and the principles the Portuguese head coach wants the team to abide by.\nAmorim even spoke about the subject in his press conferences, explaining that one of the reasons United were performing better in the Europa League was the difference in physicality between it and the Premier League.\nFast-forward to United\u2019s opening game in the 2025-26 Premier League season against Arsenal, and United have looked sharper off the ball. The timing of their forward jumps looked better, there\u2019s no hesitation when being tight to one of the Arsenal players and United won more duels in midfield.\nThe improvement in intensity and physicality doesn\u2019t only help United out of possession, but it also creates more transitional opportunities for them. More than once in the first half United won the ball back and quickly switched the play towards Mbeumo down the right side, or carried the ball forward and had an effort on goal, like Dorgu, who struck the post in the 30th minute from an offensive transition.\nAhmed Walid\nWhat did Sesko do off the bench?\nThere was a moment close to the 20-minute mark when Mbeumo\u2019s pass found Diogo Dalot\u2019s overlapping run in the final third. It was the sort of play that Amorim enjoys. A direct ball into the channels, won by his No 10, before a spare attacker burst into space against a disorganised defence.\nThe problem with Dalot\u2019s run \u2014 outside of the fact it was about to be pulled back for offside \u2014 was that he had no one in the penalty box to direct a cross towards. Amorim\u2019s front three of Mbeumo, Cunha and Mount offered a lot of off-ball energy and plenty of rotations, but limited penalty-box threat. After an hour played, United had mustered four shots on target compared to Arsenal\u2019s three, but the majority came from wide angles with a lower chance of success, Cunha\u2019s low shot the closest.\nAdvertisement\nIt was little surprise that Amorim turned to Sesko in the 65th minute. The striker replaced Mount at the tip of the attacking spear and got right to work, hunting the spaces between Gabriel and Calafiori in the event a team-mate could find him with a quick pass in behind.\nA quick run prior to the second-half water break was smart; as the ball was carried on the left wing, the striker bolted across Gabriel and Saliba to drag both centre-backs away from Mbeumo lurking at the back post. Mbuemo and Amad couldn\u2019t quite sort their feet out to have a proper shot on goal.\nFive minutes later, Sesko would again bolt from his preferred hunting ground and in towards the penalty spot when chasing a cross from Dorgu. The ball sailed over his head to Mbeumo, whose header was saved. The striker\u2019s burst of pace over the first five yards will make him a handful for Premier League defenders this season. Sesko\u2019s willingness to press from the front will please Amorim and season-ticket holders alike.\nHis first touch will take some time to sharpen up, as will his timing when leaping for crosses. But the energy is there. As is a sense of movement and ability to tussle with defenders that marks him above Hojlund and Joshua Zirkzee.\nSesko brought a combative focal point to a United team that had spent too many games without one last season. The 22-year-old will ultimately be judged on how many goals he brings to Amorim\u2019s team, but there were promising moments in his half-hour appearance\nCarl Anka\nWhat next for United?\nSunday, August 24: Fulham (Away), Premier League, 4.30pm UK, 11.30am ET\nWhat next for Arsenal?\nSaturday, August 23: Leeds (Home), Premier League, 5.30pm UK, 12.30pm ET\n(Photo: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images)"

  "argos_summary": "Manchester United\u2019s early season struggles are blamed on a range of tactical and squad issues rather than on captain Bruno Fernandes, who has been criticised for a penalty miss and a perceived drop in creativity when played deeper.  Manager Ruben Amorim\u2019s 3\u20114\u20112\u20111 system has left midfield vulnerable to being overrun, and the club\u2019s new signings have yet to gel, leaving United winless after two games.  Despite rumours of a Saudi move, Fernandes has opted to stay, citing a desire to play at the highest level, while United\u2019s poor form has raised questions about the club\u2019s direction and the effectiveness of its new leadership.  Meanwhile, Arsenal\u2019s set\u2011piece routine gave them a 1\u20110 win at Old Trafford, highlighting United\u2019s defensive frailties, particularly around the penalty area and in goalkeeping.",
