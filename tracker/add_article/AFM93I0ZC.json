      "summary": "President Trump is set to meet with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, with expectations for a potentially historic summit focused on the ongoing war in Ukraine. Trump has indicated that while he hopes for a positive outcome, he is cautious, stating there is a 25% chance the talks could fail. The meeting will be closely watched by European leaders and Ukrainian officials, as they are concerned about any agreements made without their involvement. Additionally, the Trump administration is in discussions to potentially take a stake in Intel to bolster U.S. chip manufacturing.",
