      "summary": "Bill Maher on \"Real Time\" accused Democrats of being outmaneuvered by Trump’s knack for targeting niche voter blocs—ranging from tipped service workers to TikTok users and crypto enthusiasts—arguing that this micro‑level focus helped Trump win Nevada in 2024. He contrasted Trump’s pragmatic, issue‑specific appeals with the Democrats’ emphasis on lofty ideals, suggesting the former’s sales‑style messaging resonates more with voters. Maher’s remarks highlighted Trump’s ability to “pick off” small groups and turn their concerns into electoral gains, while dismissing the Democratic platform as lacking the political skill to sell it.",
