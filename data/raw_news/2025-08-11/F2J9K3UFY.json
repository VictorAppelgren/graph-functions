  "description": "Jeanine Pirro, the United States attorney for the District of Columbia, discusses President Donald Trump's efforts to make the nation's capital safe again amid crime concerns.",
  "content": "Jeanine Pirro, the United States attorney for the District of Columbia, said President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to place the D.C. police under temporary federal control and deploy the National Guard to the nation\u2019s capital was a first step toward cracking down on crime.\"We are now in the process of bringing to the attention of law-abiding citizens, not just in D.C., but throughout the country, that we're not going to tolerate crime that is out of control in the nation's capital,\" she said Monday on \"Hannity.\"\"This is the shining city on the hill that our forefathers talked about. This is the place where Ronald Reagan talked about looking up to. And in the end, it is an incredibly violent area.\"Pirro, a former Fox News co-host, joined Trump and other top administration officials at the White House briefing room when the commander-in-chief announced the changes and a surge in federal law enforcement. TOP DEMOCRATS RIPPED ON SOCIAL MEDIA OVER 'BONKERS' REACTIONS TO TRUMP'S DC CRIME PLAN: 'MASSIVE LIAR'Trump wrote on his Truth Social account that he wants to make the federal district one of the safest cities in the world and called for teenagers as young as 14 to be charged as adults. The comments came after ex-DOGE employee Edward Coristine, nicknamed \"Big Balls,\" was allegedly assaulted during an attempted carjacking. Two 15-year-olds have since been arrested and face charges of unarmed carjacking in connection with the Coristine attack, according to the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD).DC US ATTORNEY SAYS \u2018ENOUGH IS ENOUGH\u2019 AS YOUTH CRIME PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON NATION\u2019S CAPITALPirro told Fox News host Sean Hannity that D.C.\u2019s juvenile justice system is focused more on rehabilitation than accountability. \"We've got an area where criminals are emboldened for a variety of reasons,\" said the top federal prosecutor. \"They know these young gangs \u2013 or, as they're called here, crews \u2013 they know that if they're 14, 15, 16, or 17, they are below the age of criminal responsibility unless they commit the crime of murder, rape one, armed robbery or burglary in the first degree. And that means if you shoot someone and they don't die, I don't even get the case as a prosecutor.\"She added: \"Unless and until we get our hands on them and unless and until we have the ability to punish them, they are emboldened and they are laughing at us.\"MPD reported a 7% decrease in overall crime and a 26% reduction in violent crime in Washington, D.C., as of Monday, compared to the same period in 2024. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser cited a decline in crime incidents since the COVID-19 pandemic, after a spike in 2023, and noted that the city is at a 30-year low in violent crime.She called the deployment of National Guard troops \"unsettling and unprecedented\" but pledged to work with federal officials to ensure residents are safe.",

Violent crime is down 26% this year, compared to the same timeframe in 2024, according to Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department. Assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 20%, and homicides are down by 12%.\nTRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT\nFox News Digital reached out to Bowser, Mendelson and Schwalb for comment.\nHours earlier, Trump declared a public safety emergency in the District and invoked a portion of the D.C. Home Rule Act \u2013 which granted Washington, D.C., more independence from Congress \u2013 allowing him to seize control of the local police for up to 48 hours.\n\"Our capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of violent youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people, and we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore,\" Trump said during a press conference at the White House.\nTRUMP TO HOLD NEWS CONFERENCE ON DC CRIME AFTER FEDERAL AGENTS HIT STREETS\nHowever, in order to go beyond the 48-hour mark, the president needs approval from the House Oversight Committee and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \u2014 the two panels that have oversight of Washington, D.C.\nTrump can take over the district\u2019s police force for up to 30 days if he sends a special notice to the panels, but beyond that would require a joint resolution from the House and Senate extending the takeover.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nA spokesperson for the Oversight Committee told Fox News Digital that the White House notified the panel of its intent to go beyond the 48-hour window.\nFox News Digital reached out to the Senate Homeland Security Committee for comment but did not immediately hear back."

      "text": "Just a few years ago, travelers arriving by train in Washington, D.C., were met with a jarring juxtaposition: the Capitol building \u2014 home to the nation\u2019s most powerful lawmakers \u2014 rising in the background and a homeless encampment outside Union Station in the foreground.\nWhile the city has removed many of the one-time sprawling encampments near its iconic landmarks and been forced to roll back several progressive policies in an effort to reduce crime, the Trump administration remains unsatisfied.\nMany Washingtonians still dodge mentally ill or drug-addicted individuals on their daily commutes. Last week, one of President Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) staffers was assaulted \u2014 a \"last straw\" that prompted Trump to deploy the National Guard and federalize the Metropolitan Police Department.\nTrump vowed to evict the homeless population, saying the government \"will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capitol.\" He said a process had begun over the weekend to remove homeless encampments in the district.\nTRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS\u2014BUT SOME WELCOME IT\nA tour by Fox News Digital found that many former hotspots for the unhoused have been cleared, with only abandoned clothing and scattered food containers left behind as signs of recent life.\nIn other parts of the city \u2014 including the heart of downtown \u2014 the unhoused population continued to stake out places to sleep and gather in parks or on busy street corners.\nAt one park, about a dozen people were clustered together with their belongings and a few tents, seemingly unaware of the new crackdown. A dried red substance was splattered across the sidewalk outside their makeshift encampment.\nOn another corner, a handful of individuals slept through the city\u2019s lunchtime rush, undisturbed by the surrounding noise.\nTRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE. HERE'S HOW THAT COULD PLAY OUT\nWhile most interactions with the homeless are mundane and nonviolent, a broader sense of unease has taken hold in the city \u2014 driven by a series of high-profile, often random attacks. Some involve members of the unhoused population; others do not, but collectively they\u2019ve contributed to the perception that D.C. has become less safe.\nAmong them: A minor opened fire on a group of other teens in Navy Yard over the weekend; a 21-year-old congressional intern was fatally shot outside a Metro station during his commute home last month; and two Israeli embassy staffers were gunned down outside an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in May.\nEven so, D.C. was far more dangerous in the past. The city hit a 30-year low for violent crime in 2024; down 35% from the previous year. And this year, it\u2019s down 26% year to date from last year at this time. Homicides are down 12%, carjackings 37%, robbery 28% and 20% for assault with a dangerous weapon.\nViolent crime had reached a fever pitch in 2023 with 274 homicides. In 2024, there were 187.\nTrump called statistics showing a drop in crime \"phony\" and said his administration would \"look into that.\"\n\"It's becoming a situation of complete and total lawlessness,\" the president said. He added that the MPD and federal authorities would be supported by 800 D.C. National Guardsmen and potentially \"much more.\"\nGroups dedicated to helping the homeless have spoken out against the administration\u2019s move.\n\"Anyone can be at risk of experiencing homelessness,\" the Georgetown Ministry Center \u2014 a privately funded agency focused on homeless services \u2014 said in a statement. \"When our most vulnerable citizens are demonized and criminalized, we erode our shared humanity.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe D.C. City Council called Trump's move a \"manufactured intrusion on local authority.\"\n\"Federalizing the Metropolitan Police Department is unwarranted because there is no Federal emergency. Further, the National Guard has no public safety training or knowledge of local laws. The Guard\u2019s role does not include investigating or solving crimes in the District. Calling out the National Guard is an unnecessary deployment with no real mission,\" a statement read.\n\"Public safety is built on trust, consistent enforcement, and community-based strategies. We must ensure that in our pursuit of safety, we do not create an atmosphere of surveillance, intimidation or unequal treatment under the law.\""

Donald Trump has no basis to take over the local police department. And zero credibility on the issue of law and order. Get lost.\"\nConservatives on social media ripped Jeffries as well.\n\"A selection of headlines in our nation\u2019s capital this month,\" NRCC deputy executive director Jack Pandol posted on X along with several news headlines of recent violent crime in DC.\n\"Why do Democrats always take up for thugs, violent criminals, and illegals over law abiding citizens?\"\n\"Democrats are lining up to oppose crime being lower in DC,\" Outkick founder Clay Travis posted on X. \"It\u2019s bonkers.\"\nTRUMP VOWS TO MAKE DC 'SAFER' AND 'BEAUTIFUL' AS CAPITAL BATTLES CRIME AND HOMELESSNESS\n\"Democrats like Jeffries would rather preserve dangerous cities than admit their policies fail,\" GOP Congressman William Timmons posted on X.\n\"IN FACT, murder is the most violent and accurately measured crime, and the D.C. murder rate in 2024 was 83% higher than in 2012,\" the social media account for the nonprofit research institute Just Facts posted on X.\n\"Jeffries\u2019 stat is deceitful because it ignores the FBI\u2019s warning against \"making any direct comparison\" of its crime data over time given that \"changes in police procedures, shifting attitudes toward crime and police, and other societal changes can affect the extent to which people report and law enforcement agencies record crime.\"\nTrump said in the Monday press conference that he is federalizing the D.C. police department to curb spiraling violence.\n\"The murder rate in Washington today is higher than that of Bogota, Colombia, Mexico City, some of the places that you hear about as being the worst places on Earth, much higher,\" Trump said Monday. \"This is much higher. The number of car thefts has doubled over the past five years, and the number of carjackings has more than tripled. Murders in 2023 reached the highest rate, probably ever. They say 25 years, but they don't know what that means because it just goes back 25 years can't be worse.\"\nTrump whipped out charts showing the media that the nation's capital allegedly suffers worse crime trends than other cities worldwide, calling on them to \"take a look at numbers\" as he rattled off the data's findings.\n\"Look at these. Baghdad is\u2026 we doubled up on Baghdad. Panama City, Brasilia, San Jose, Costa Rica, Bogota, Colombia. Heavy drugs. Mexico City, I mentioned Lima, Peru, all double and triple what they are. So do you want to live in places like that? I don't think so. I don't think so. And I think the people in this room, if you wrote correctly, you'd see. Look at the kind of numbers we have. D.C. 41 per 100,000 (for homicides in 2023). No. 1 that we can find anywhere in the world. Other cities are pretty bad, but they're not as bad as that. That the way you want to live? The reporters of the world? Juvenile offenders and crimes against persons as they say, it's getting worse, not getting better. It's getting worse,\" he continued.\nThe nation's capital in the following years has been rocked by shootings that have left innocent children shot and dead, a trend of juveniles committing carjackings that have turned deadly in some cases, shoplifting crimes and attacks on government employees, summer interns and others, including the fatal shooting of 21-year-old congressional intern, Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, in June.\nTrump's opponents have cited crime statistics showing crime in Washington is on the decline. Violent crime is down 26% this year, in comparison to the same timeframe in 2024, according to Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department. Likewise, assaults with a dangerous weapon are down 20%, and homicides are down by 12%.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"This is Liberation Day in D.C., and we're going to take our capital back,\" he said. \"We're taking it back under the authority vested in me as the president of the United States. I'm officially invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act. You know what that is. And placing the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department under direct federal control. \u2026 In addition, I'm deploying the National Guard to help reestablish law, order and public safety in Washington, DC. And they're going to be allowed to do their job properly.\""

      "text": "Authorities announced the arrest of two teens in connection with the brutal beating of a former Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee that allegedly took place during an attempted carjacking in the nation\u2019s capital over the weekend.\nA 15-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl, both of Hyattsville, Md., now face charges of unarmed carjacking, Washington D.C.'s Metropolitan Police Department said Tuesday. Police did not provide their identities as both suspects are juveniles.\nPolice said the investigation remains ongoing, with multiple suspects still outstanding.\nThe victim, Edward Coristine, nicknamed \"Big Balls,\" was assaulted around 3:00 a.m. Sunday by a group of teenagers in the city\u2019s Logan Circle neighborhood. The teens attempted to carjack him and a woman, whom police identified as his significant other, according to authorities.\nTRUMP WARNS HE WILL TAKE 'FEDERAL CONTROL' OF WASHINGTON, DC AS YOUTH VIOLENCE CONTINUES\nPolice said Coristine pushed the woman into the vehicle for safety and turned to confront the group. At least several of the teens then attacked him, police said, until officers patrolling nearby intervened. As officers moved toward the group, the teens fled on foot.\nCoristine, one of the most visible figures of President Donald Trump\u2019s DOGE, was left bloodied in the attack, according to a photo the president shared on his Truth Social platform on Tuesday.\nThe assault prompted Trump to threaten to federalize Washington, D.C., calling for local minors and gang members over the age of 14 to be prosecuted as adults.\n\"The most recent victim was beaten mercilessly by local thugs,\" Trump wrote. \"Perhaps it should have been done a long time ago, then this incredible young man, and so many others, would not have had to go through the horrors of Violent Crime. If this continues, I am going to exert my powers, and FEDERALIZE this City. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\nFormer DOGE head Elon Musk weighed in on X, sharing more of the story.\n\"A few days ago, a gang of about a dozen young men tried to assault a woman in her car at night in DC,\" Musk wrote. \"A @Doge team member saw what was happening, ran to defend her and was severely beaten to the point of concussion, but he saved her. It is time to federalize DC.\"\nThe president said it appears criminals are \"not afraid\" of the police, because \"nothing ever happens to them.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Washington, D.C. must be safe, clean, and beautiful for all Americans and, importantly, for the World to see,\" he wrote in the post. \"If D.C. doesn\u2019t get its act together, and quickly, we will have no choice but to take Federal control of the City, and run this City how it should be run, and put criminals on notice that they\u2019re not going to get away with it anymore.\"\nFox News Digital\u2019s Alexandra Koch and Brooke Singman, along with the Assoicated Press contributed to this report."

He also announced federal legislation to end the practice of no-cash bail, which allows judges to send suspects home from jail without them paying bail.\nThe Metropolitan Police Department\u2019s 3,400 officers will be under the command of DEA administrator Terry Cole. The National Guard troops will be commanded by Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth announced. Trump vowed to remove homeless encampments popping up around the city and have the U.S. Park Police remove graffiti in the nation\u2019s capital.\nTRUMP'S PLAN TO DEPLOY NATIONAL GUARD IN DC SPARKS BACKLASH FROM RESIDENTS\u2014BUT SOME WELCOME IT\n\"He really doesn't really care about what's actually happening in D.C. On a certain level because he's not trying to get at the underlying root causes,\" Glaude continued.\nThe president is allowed to federalize local D.C. police for up to 30 days in the event of an emergency, according to the Home Rule Act which granted the nation\u2019s capital self-governing rights in 1973. Congress can lengthen the president\u2019s emergency powers through a joint resolution.\n\"Watch them, the police are standing, and they're told not to do anything under any search or this, and you can see they want to get at it. And they're standing there and people are spitting in their face, and they are not allowed to do anything, but now they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want,\" Trump said.\nTrump has long railed against what he sees as out-of-control crime in the nation\u2019s capital. Metropolitan Police Department data shows that while the homicide rate is falling, the last five years saw the greatest number of murders since 2008.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nGlaude, a professor of African American Studies at Princeton University, claimed that Trump\u2019s announcement was just an attempt to throw \"red meat\" to his base in an attempt to distract them from the Jeffrey Epstein case.\nEpstein, a former longtime friend of Trump, former President Bill Clinton and other high-profile individuals, killed himself in federal prison while awaiting trial on sex trafficking of minors charges. Many in the MAGA world have demanded the release of the so-called \"Epstein files,\" while Trump has dismissed the affair as \"pretty boring stuff\" and denounced the \"past supporters\" agitating around it."

Despite claims of escalating crime, recent statistics show a significant decrease in overall and violent crime in D.C. The announcement has sparked controversy, with local officials and critics questioning the necessity and implications of federal intervention.",
