(Photo Danielle Prokop / Source NM)\n\nPeople in Curry County who rely on private wells for drinking water can receive free water testing courtesy of two New Mexico state departments this weekend.\n\nThe New Mexico Environment Department and the New Mexico Department of Health will host a free domestic well water testing event from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday in the Home and Arts Building at 1900 E. Brady Ave in Clovis.\n\nThe departments\u2019 event, which they call a \u201cwater fair,\u201d coincides with the Curry County Fair. It offers the first 100 well owners who show up the chance to measure pH, specific conductance and levels of nitrates in their water, which the agencies said in a news release are crucial measurements for maintaining safe drinking water.\n\n\u201cPrivate well owners in Curry County can come to this water fair and find out more about the quality of their household drinking water,\u201d Ground Water Quality Bureau Chief Justin Ball said in a statement. \u201cFree well water testing gives families the knowledge they need to make informed choices about their water and health.\u201d\n\nSince July 2024, the environment department has tested 231 private drinking water wells at seven water fairs, the agency said in a news release.\n\nState officials are asking participants to bring a sample of their well water in a container, along with information about their well including overall well depth, depth to water, well casing material, well latitude and longitude and distance between the well and the nearest septic tank or leach field system. Guidelines about how to properly collect a sample can be found on the environment department\u2019s site.\n\nWell owners, their family members or neighbors should bring their water sample to the event for it to be tested. If the owner themselves cannot bring the sample, the container must be clearly labeled with the owner\u2019s name, phone number, address and well information.\n\nSUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",
