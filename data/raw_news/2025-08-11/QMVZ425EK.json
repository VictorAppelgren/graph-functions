  "title": "Guenther Steiner Exposes Max Verstappen's Plan for Future Mercedes Contract",
  "description": "Guenther Steiner has suggested that Max Verstappen has planned a move to Mercedes after the 2026 season.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nFormer Haas Formula One team principal Guenther Steiner has opened up about Max Verstappen's alleged strategy to secure a multi-year Mercedes contract after the 2026 season.\n\nVerstappen was closely linked to Mercedes since June, after George Russell admitted that his contract extension talks were on hold due to his team's ongoing talks with the Dutch driver. This is despite Verstappen's contract lasting until the end of 2028.\n\nWhile the speculation about Verstappen's 2026 move to Mercedes intensified in the following month, Verstappen shut down the rumors by confirming his loyalty to Red Bull. Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff acknowledged his interest in signing Verstappen, but confirmed that his team will be heading in the direction of having Russell and Andrea Kimi Antonelli as its driver lineup for the next season.\n\nRumors suggest that Verstappen's 2025 Red Bull contract required him to be fourth or lower in the Drivers' Standings before the summer break if an exit clause was to get triggered in his contract. However, he is currently placed third in the standings, as F1 enjoys the summer break.\n\nSteiner believes the four-time world champion will assess his options next year, when F1 enters a new era of regulations with entirely new cars, which will be powered by internal combustion and electric power, with the ratio split equally. Therefore, it would be a risk for Verstappen to switch teams after the 2025 season, given the big reset looming ahead.\n\nFor the first time, Red Bull will field cars in 2026 with its in-house power units, developed in collaboration with Ford. Mercedes, on the other hand, has proven its superior engine technology in the hybrid era that began in 2014. However, an overhaul of the engine and chassis regulations in 2026 is a first for all teams in the modern era, making it nearly impossible to predict the pecking order.\n\nSteiner suggests that Verstappen will first assess the strong players next year before deciding on a switch. If Red Bull proves its dominance, he is likely to continue for the length of his contract. If Mercedes comes out on top, Verstappen will sign a multi-year contract with the Brackley-based team.\n\nSpeaking in an interview with Web.de, the former Haas team boss was asked if he was surprised that Verstappen stayed at Red Bull this year, given the ongoing car problems faced by the team. He said:\n\n\"No, because I believe it's a very strategic decision on his part. Max knows that at Red Bull, he has the option to leave at the end of 2026. This gives him maximum flexibility.\n\n\"If Red Bull remains surprisingly strong, he's in exactly the right place. If not, he'll look at who's ahead and move. If Mercedes is strong from 2026 onwards, he'll get a multi-year contract there. A move now with a long-term contract would be riskier.\"\n\nSteiner predicts that Red Bull will be ahead next year, but not without hurdles. He added:\n\n\"Red Bull is building the engine itself with Ford. It's a massive project. It certainly won't run smoothly in the first year. They'll be near the front of the field in 2026, but not at the very top. The gap to the leaders will remain.\" [Translated by Google]",

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nFormer Red Bull junior driver Dan Ticktum has rejected the popular theory about Christian Horner being ousted with immediate effect from the team, calling the whole saga a \"drama\" and stressing that he does not believe anything that is published by the media about his sudden exit.\nHorner's exit announcement came after the British Grand Prix weekend, which saw him step down from the position of CEO and team principal in one day. Red Bull named Laurent Mekies as his successor. What added to the surprise for many was the concealment of the reason for Horner's ousting, especially since he had served the team for 20 years.\nThe former team boss is said to have known about his exit the evening before the public announcement. Ticktum, who was part of Red Bull's junior team from 2017 to 2019, refuses to believe the theory that Horner was unaware of it in advance. Speaking to GPBlog, he said:\n\"I don't know. I just don't believe anything I read in the media about it. You know, Formula 1 is such a cesspit of rumours and crap, so unless you hear it from both parties - or all parties face to face - I don't read any of it.\n\"Yes, it's been a drama, sacked with immediate effect. Do I think they would have not told him at all?\"\nRed Bull has dropped several drivers in the last few years who were unable to deal with the pressure of racing alongside Max Verstappen. It is noteworthy that Yuki Tsunoda is Verstappen's third teammate in the past year. Ticktum took a light jab at Red Bull senior advisor Helmut Marko, who plays a key role in finalizing the team's driver lineup. He added:\n\"I know Helmut Marko has got a reputation for dropping drivers like that, so it's [Horner's sudden exit] not impossible.\"\nThe 26-year-old driver, who now races in Formula E, acknowledged the great things Horner did for Red Bull and hinted that the former team boss will return to a \"prominent\" role. He said:\n\"He's achieved a lot in his time. He's done some pretty incredible things. So, I would say he'll be in a prominent role somewhere else next, but we'll see.\nHorner, who has been linked to a return with the Alpine F1 team as a shareholder, posted his thoughts on social media following his Red Bull departure. He wrote:\n\"After an incredible journey of twenty years together, it is with a heavy heart that today I say goodbye to the Team I have absolutely loved. Every one of you, the amazing people at the factory, have been the heart and soul of everything that we have achieved. Win and lose, every step of the way, we have stood by each other as one and I will never forget that. It's been a privilege being part of and leading this epic Team and I am so proud of our collective accomplishments and you all.\n\"Thanks to the amazing partners and fans who enabled us to go racing. Your support has helped grow the team from its humble beginnings to an F1 powerhouse that laid claim to 6 Constructors Championships and 8 Drivers Championships.\n\"Equally, thank you to our rivals, with whom there would be no racing at all. You've pushed us, challenged us, and enabled us to achieve accolades we never dreamed possible. The competition has made every victory sweeter and every setback an opportunity to develop and grow.\n\"Formula 1 is a sport built on relentless ambition, passion, and respect. The rivalries have been fierce, but the mutual drive to innovate and raise the bar is what has made this journey so special.\n\"It's been an honour to be part of this incredible era of motorsport. I leave with immense pride in what we've achieved and also with what's in the pipeline for 2026 - and huge respect for everyone who's made F1 the pinnacle it is today.

      "text": "Die Formel 1 hat Sommerpause, viele Fragen sind jedoch offen. Wir haben uns mit Ex-Teamchef G\u00fcnther Steiner \u00fcber die Hamilton-Krise, den Red-Bull-Absturz und die Lage im Titelkampf unterhalten.\nDie Formel 1 mag sich in die Sommerpause verabschiedet haben. Das bedeutet aber nicht, dass es deshalb keine Themen mehr gibt. Denn die Diskussionen gehen munter weiter. Schlie\u00dflich sind zahlreiche Fragen offen.\nWar der Wechsel von Lewis Hamilton zu Ferrari ein Fehler? Ist der siebenmalige Weltmeister tats\u00e4chlich nutzlos, wie er beim letzten Rennwochenende verzweifelt erkl\u00e4rte? Was passiert im Titelkampf? Eskaliert es zwischen Oscar Piastri und Lando Norris? Und wie lange braucht Red Bull, um wieder in die Erfolgsspur zu finden?\nBevor die K\u00f6nigsklasse Ende August in Zandvoort (im Free-TV auf RTL und auf Sky und bei uns im Liveticker) aus der Pause zur\u00fcckkehrt, haben wir uns mit dem Ex-Teamchef und heutigen RTL-Experten G\u00fcnther Steiner \u00fcber die Lage in der Formel 1 unterhalten.\nHerr Steiner, wie nutzlos ist\nG\u00fcnther Steiner: Nutzlos ist er nicht, aber im Moment bringt er nicht das, was man sich von ihm erwartet hat. Er ist mit sich selbst unzufrieden. Und auch die \u00f6ffentliche Erwartung riesig, vielleicht zu gro\u00df. Fakt ist: Er kommt bei Ferrari nicht in die G\u00e4nge. Der direkte Vergleich mit dem Teamkollegen ist immer der aussagekr\u00e4ftigste. Und da sieht man:\nAm Anfang konnte man das ja noch mit der Eingew\u00f6hnung erkl\u00e4ren \u2013 neues Team, neuer Ingenieur, neue Abl\u00e4ufe. Aber warum l\u00e4uft es jetzt immer noch nicht?\nEr hat sein Selbstvertrauen verloren. Wenn du nicht mehr an dich glaubst, kannst du keine Leistung bringen. Man muss sich nur erinnern: Als sein Wechsel zu Ferrari bekannt wurde, war das ein riesiger Hype. Auch f\u00fcr mich. Der siebenmalige Weltmeister bei der Scuderia, das klang wie ein M\u00e4rchen. Und nat\u00fcrlich hat er sich selbst auch viel davon versprochen. Aber wenn die Realit\u00e4t dann nicht mit den Erwartungen mith\u00e4lt, verliert man das Vertrauen in sich selbst.\nEr wird n\u00e4chstes Jahr 41. Ist das Alter auch ein Faktor?\nAlter spielt immer eine Rolle. Ich merke es ja selbst. (lacht) Aber er ist topfit. Klar: Schneller wird man mit dem Alter nicht. Aber er kann absolut noch ein paar Jahre auf gutem Niveau fahren. Aber wenn du nicht mehr die Freude hast, wenn du merkst, du k\u00e4mpfst nur noch, dann bringt\u2019s nichts. Dann ist es besser, zu sagen: Ich hab\u2019s probiert, es hat nicht funktioniert und ich h\u00f6re auf.\nHamiltons Wechsel zu Ferrari ein Fehler?\nWie gro\u00df ist der Einfluss des Autos auf Hamiltons Probleme?\nNat\u00fcrlich spielt das Auto immer eine Rolle. Aber wir sind in der Formel 1, und ein Top-Fahrer muss mit dem umgehen k\u00f6nnen, was er bekommt. Wenn ein Auto in bestimmten Bereichen schwierig zu fahren ist, dann liegt es am Fahrer, sich anzupassen, nicht umgekehrt. Das Auto ist gut. Ich w\u00fcrde da keine Entschuldigung f\u00fcr Lewis suchen.\nWar der Wechsel zu Ferrari ein Fehler?\nMan wei\u00df nicht, wie es bei Mercedes weitergegangen w\u00e4re. George Russell ist dort sehr stark. Vielleicht h\u00e4tte sich Lewis auch dort schwergetan. Aber grunds\u00e4tzlich war der Schritt mutig und ich fand ihn gut. Jetzt klappt es sportlich nicht. Aber das macht den Wechsel nicht automatisch zum Fehler. Manchmal muss man auch etwas wagen. Und selbst wenn es nicht aufgeht, kann man sagen: Ich habe es versucht.\nWie sehen Sie seine Zukunft? Bleibt er \u00fcber das Jahr hinaus?\nIch denke, die Sommerpause wird f\u00fcr ihn ein Moment der Reflexion. Vielleicht kommt er nach der Pause lockerer zur\u00fcck und die Leistung steigt. Vielleicht aber auch nicht und dann k\u00f6nnte ich mir gut vorstellen, dass er am Jahresende sagt: \"Das war's. Ich tue mir das nicht noch ein Jahr an.\" Er hat au\u00dferhalb der Formel 1 viele Interessen, er ist eine Marke f\u00fcr sich. Viele Fahrer brauchen die F1 als Plattform. Lewis braucht das nicht mehr. Und genau das macht es f\u00fcr ihn auch leichter, einen Schlussstrich zu ziehen.\nK\u00f6nnte das neue Reglement 2026 ihn wom\u00f6glich noch reizen?\nMit den neuen Ground-Effect-Autos hatte Lewis von Anfang an Schwierigkeiten. Und 2026 kommen neue Autos, neue Motoren und keiner wei\u00df, wer dann stark ist. Vielleicht sagt er: Das nehme ich noch mit. Aber wenn auch das nicht funktioniert, dann ist Schluss. Wenn auch nicht von jetzt auf gleich. Sollte er aufh\u00f6ren wollen, w\u00fcrde er das rechtzeitig kommunizieren, damit das Team Zeit hat, Ersatz zu finden.\nWas w\u00fcrden Sie ihm als Teamchef raten?\nGanz klar: Z\u00e4hne zusammenbei\u00dfen, alles geben, aber sich nicht zu sehr verkopfen. Nicht st\u00e4ndig \u00fcberlegen, was andere denken oder sagen. Wenn du Charles nicht schlagen kannst, dann versuche, an ihm dran zu bleiben. Der gr\u00f6\u00dfte Feind ist der innere Druck. Und im Moment versucht er zu viel. Er will es erzwingen. Aber wenn du wei\u00dft, die Leistung ist gerade nicht voll da, dann mach einfach das Beste draus und du wirst sehen: Lockerheit, Vertrauen, Rhythmus kommen zur\u00fcck.\nWar es richtig, dass Ferrari den Vertrag mit Teamchef Fred Vasseur verl\u00e4ngert hat?\nDas war die richtige Entscheidung. Es dauert Jahre, bis sich ein Team eingespielt hat. Und: Ferrari steht aktuell auf Platz zwei in der Konstrukteurswertung. Vielleicht entspricht es nicht ganz den Anspr\u00fcchen im Ferrari-Management, die vom WM-Titel tr\u00e4umen, aber realistisch betrachtet ist das Team stark. Und jetzt Fred rauszuwerfen? Das w\u00e4re falsch. Dann kommt der N\u00e4chste, sagt, er muss alles umbauen, und braucht wieder zwei Jahre Schonfrist. Fred muss jetzt die Chance bekommen, 2026 mitzugestalten. Erst dann wird man sehen, ob es funktioniert.\nFerrari setzt auf Kontinuit\u00e4t. H\u00e4tte Red Bull das auch tun sollen \u2013 und an Christian Horner festhalten?\nDie Unruhe im Team war ja nicht neu. Das hat sich \u00fcber eineinhalb Jahre aufgebaut, es kam immer wieder etwas Neues dazu. Und irgendwann hat man entschieden: Jetzt muss Ruhe rein. Die sportliche Leistung ist nicht mehr da wie fr\u00fcher,\nWie lange dauert es denn, ein Team wie Red Bull wieder an die Spitze zu f\u00fchren?\nDas kann Jahre dauern. Red Bull ist derzeit eher auf dem Weg nach unten als nach oben. Mekies hat einen riesigen Job vor sich. Gute Leute sind gegangen und haben sich auf andere Teams verteilt. Jetzt muss er versuchen, neue Top-Leute zu gewinnen, und das ist schwer. Und au\u00dferdem baut Red Bull mit Ford den Motor selbst. Das ist ein gewaltiges Projekt. Im ersten Jahr wird das ganz sicher nicht reibungslos laufen. Sie werden 2026 im vorderen Feld dabei sein, aber nicht ganz vorne. Der R\u00fcckstand zur Spitze wird bleiben.\nSo ist Verstappen am richtigen Ort\nHat es Sie \u00fcberrascht, dass Max Verstappen trotzdem bleibt?\nNein, denn ich glaube, dass es eine sehr strategische Entscheidung von ihm ist. Max wei\u00df: Bei Red Bull hat er die Option, Ende 2026 auszusteigen. Das gibt ihm maximale Flexibilit\u00e4t. Wenn Red Bull \u00fcberraschend stark bleibt, ist er genau am richtigen Ort. Wenn nicht, schaut er, wer vorne ist und wechselt. Wenn Mercedes ab 2026 stark ist, wird er dort einen mehrj\u00e4hrigen Vertrag bekommen. Ein Wechsel jetzt mit einem langfristigen Vertrag w\u00e4re riskanter.\nNico h\u00e4tte viel mehr erreichen k\u00f6nnen, wenn er zur richtigen Zeit im richtigen Auto gesessen h\u00e4tte. Ironisch gesagt: Er hat ein besonderes Talent daf\u00fcr, sich immer das falsche Team auszusuchen. Wenn Nico einen Vertrag unterschreibt, sollte man vielleicht kein Geld mehr auf das Team setzen, aber das meine ich liebevoll. Er war mehrfach ganz nah dran an einem Top-Cockpit, und es hat dann doch nicht geklappt. Umso sch\u00f6ner, dass er jetzt endlich sein erstes Podium hat, das hat er sich absolut verdient.\nK\u00f6nnte H\u00fclkenberg doch nochmal die Chance auf ein Top-Cockpit bekommen?\nAusschlie\u00dfen kann man es nicht, aber es m\u00fcsste etwas Au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnliches passieren. Von sich aus wird niemand ein WM-Projekt auf H\u00fclkenberg ausrichten, daf\u00fcr ist er schlicht zu alt. Aber wenn sich kurzfristig eine L\u00fccke auftut, jemand mit Erfahrung gebraucht wird, von dem man genau wei\u00df, was man bekommt, dann ist Nico genau der Richtige.\nWie bewerten Sie die aktuelle Entwicklung bei Sauber? L\u00e4uft der \u00dcbergang besser als gedacht?\nWas sie \u00fcber das Jahr gemacht haben, ist beeindruckend. Sie haben riesige Fortschritte erzielt. Die Richtung stimmt. F\u00fcr n\u00e4chstes Jahr bauen sie ihren eigenen Motor. Und wie bei Red Bull gilt: Das ist verdammt schwer. Aber Audi hat Erfahrung, das ist eine echte Ingenieursfirma, eine der besten der Welt. Sie haben gute Leute, sie kennen sich mit Antrieben aus. Trotzdem ist die Formel 1 nochmal eine andere Welt. Aber was sie bisher gezeigt haben, stimmt mich optimistisch, dass es besser laufen kann als gedacht.\nIst in Sachen Titelkampf das Ding f\u00fcr McLaren durch, oder greift nach der Sommerpause noch jemand an?\nDa greift keiner mehr an. Das Ding ist entschieden, was die Titelchancen betrifft. Auch die Konstrukteurs-WM ist durch, da wird nichts mehr passieren.\nUnd wer hat die besseren Titel-Chancen: Oscar Piastri oder Lando Norris?\nF\u00fcr mich ganz klar Oscar Piastri. Er ist konstanter, ruhiger, macht weniger Fehler. Lando ist auch stark, keine Frage, aber es schleichen sich immer wieder kleine Schnitzer ein. Piastri hat mit Berater Mark Webber jemanden an seiner Seite, der selbst auf Top-Niveau gefahren ist. Der kennt das Gesch\u00e4ft, war Teamkollege von Sebastian Vettel. Der wei\u00df, wie man mit Druck umgeht, und Piastri h\u00f6rt ihm zu. Piastri ist mental sehr reif. Und das macht ihn f\u00fcr mich zum Favoriten in diesem McLaren-Duell.\nCrash der Titelkandidaten? \"Kann jederzeit passieren\"\nWann knallt es zwischen Norris und Piastri so richtig?\nDas kann jederzeit passieren. Es hat ja mehrfach schon fast gekracht. Da war oft Gl\u00fcck im Spiel. Und Lando macht einfach zu viele kleine Fehler. In Kanada wollte er durch eine L\u00fccke, die nicht da war. Es war reines Gl\u00fcck, dass Oscar keinen Plattfu\u00df kassiert hat. Deshalb sage ich: Dass es zwischen den beiden irgendwann kracht, ist fast unausweichlich.\nSollte McLaren eingreifen \u2013 Stichwort Teamorder? Oder weiter freies Racing zulassen?\nEmpfehlungen der Redaktion\nIch bin froh, dass sie sie frei fahren lassen. Das ist doch das, was wir sehen wollen. Beide sind auf Augenh\u00f6he, wie willst du da einen zur Nummer zwei machen? Das w\u00e4re der totale Motivationskiller. Die Formel 1 lebt auch von Emotionen. Wenn man jetzt sagt, einer muss den anderen unterst\u00fctzen, dann verliert man einen Teil der Magie. Sie gewinnen die Konstrukteurs-WM sowieso. Also: frei fahren lassen!\n\u00dcber den Gespr\u00e4chspartner\n- G\u00fcnther Steiner war von 2014 bis Anfang 2024 zehn Jahre lang Teamchef bei Haas.

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nRed Bull Racing Formula One driver Max Verstappen has uncovered McLaren's strongest point that has helped it dominate the F1 grid thus far. For the first time since the inception of the current ground effect era in 2022, Verstappen is not leading the championship.\nWhile the setback could be attributed to Red Bull's dwindling performance due to reported issues on the RB21 F1 car, McLaren's superior racecraft has proven it can master different kinds of circuits under extreme weather conditions.\nOscar Piastri leads the 2025 Drivers' Standings with 284 points, nine points adrift of his teammate Lando Norris with 275 points. Verstappen is placed third in the standings with 187 points, 88 points less than Norris, his 2024 championship rival. From the looks of it, the Papaya outfit is on its way to securing both the Drivers' Championship and Constructors' Championship this year.\nWhile the McLaren MCL39 is popular for reduced tire wear compared to its rivals, Verstappen revealed that the car's medium cornering speed is unmatched by any other F1 challenger. Speaking to the media, he said:\n\"I think their medium speed performance is incredible compared to, I would say, everyone else on the grid. The rotation that they have on the front axle, without losing the rear, is something that is also quite incredible to see, and that's something that we have to try to achieve.\"\nMcLaren team principal Andrea Stella acknowledged the strong point, confirming that Verstappen was right in his observation. He said:\n\"That's an easy answer because it can be answered just by looking at the GPS data. When you look at the speed comparison with some other teams, the data says that McLaren can generate the highest mid-corner speed in medium-speed corners.\n\"So, I think the assessment of Max is correct. We still have our weak points. If you go on a very high-speed corner like Copse, for instance, or Pouhon, we are not the fastest car. Likewise, probably in very low speed, we are not the fastest car.\n\"But the majority of corners in a championship happen to be medium-speed corners, and certainly in that range, our car is, data in hand, the best.\"\nWill Red Bull be able to work on gaining a similar advantage from the RB21? It seems unlikely, given the onset of a new era of regulations in 2026, that will see the introduction of new cars that all teams are currently developing. Red Bull senior advisor Helmut Marko confirmed in a recent interview that it was now impossible for Verstappen to secure his fifth championship title.\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nIs This Article Trustworthy?\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\nAbout the writer\nSaajan Jogia is a motorsport and automotive writer with over ten years of experience.
