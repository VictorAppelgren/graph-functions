      "feedback": "The draft lacks explicit causal links to dxy and omits key catalysts that materially affect the USD index; add a line linking the Fed’s September rate cut to a 0.5‑1 % lift in dxy via the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread steepening (Z7O1DCHS7) and include the 29 Aug tariff escalation as a +0.5‑1 % driver (Z7O1DCHS7); remove the generic “Fed policy” entry for 15 Sep Cook lawsuit, as its effect on dxy is indirect and weak—replace it with a specific “Cook lawsuit resolution” catalyst that could blunt dxy gains (Z7O1DCHS7); tighten the probability ranges by citing the 89 % odds of a September cut (U21K4ALYQ)(3YAQ8JUPL) and the 0‑5 bp range for ust10y (3952FOSRQ); ensure each line references the canonical handle (dxy) and the exact window (29 Aug‑5 Sep or 12 Sep) with inline IDs; finally, add a “Down” entry for the 12 Sep CPI that could push dxy down by –0.5‑1 % if inflation falls (XTQIQRP5K) and adjust its probability to 60 % based on the 0.3 % core PCE rise (97MD1FHW8) supporting a modest upside bias.",
