      "feedback": "The draft is on target but needs a few tightening edits to meet Argos standards: 1) Replace every “UST 10‑year yield” with the canonical handle **ust10y** (e.g., “ust10y is at 4.23 %”). 2) Keep all claims tied to a source ID; add inline citations where missing (e.g., the 4.20 % support level and 4.30 % resistance should cite 97MD1FHW8 and U21K4ALYQ). 3) Explicitly state the catalyst window: the September FOMC (16‑17 Sep), the next core‑PCE release (early Sep), and tariff‑enforcement actions (mid‑Oct). 4) Quantify the expected moves: “ust10y should fall 20–30 bps if the Fed cuts, or rise 10–20 bps if it tightens.” 5) Highlight the key thresholds: 4.20 % support (cut likely) and 4.30 % resistance (cut unlikely). 6) Ensure the narrative stays focused on ust10y—remove any extraneous mention of other assets or companies. 7) Verify that every causal link (Fed tone → rate cut odds → ust10y move; tariff uncertainty → inflation expectations → ust10y rise) is explicitly stated and sourced. 8) Keep the tone concise, decisive, and aligned with the 0–3‑week horizon. Once these adjustments are made, the analysis will satisfy the acceptance gate and Argos formatting rules.",
