      "feedback": "This draft has solid core numbers (Q2: revenue $215m, net income $30m; 2025 guide $850–$950m; gross margin ~49%, net margin ~13.8%; debt/eq ~23%; price target ~$34.76; 36% QoQ move) and a plausible macro throughline (rate-cut expectations). To reach world-class quality for the 3–6 month horizon, deliver a formal scenario map with explicit catalysts, triggers, and invalidations, anchored to the two core sources (C22MKA9VY for policy/clock and SK994CBWR for ACMR fundamentals) and avoid narrative drift. Actionable edits: 1) construct a 3–6 month scenario tree (base, up, down) with timing windows and path-dependency; base-case should hinge on rate cuts starting as soon as Sep (50bp) and totaling ~150–175bp, with a clear optimistic alt if a faster/softer path materializes and a pessimistic alt if cuts stall or escalation in export-controls hits WFE demand (cite C22MKA9VY after rate-path claims). 2) map macro-to-mirmarket transmission: show how a discount-rate compression, credit/financing mood, and broader capex cycle translate into ACMR’s WFE demand, using the company’s own guidance (2025 $850–$950m; potential 2028 ~$1.4b revenue) and its product-edge upgrade (N2 bubbling on Ultra Cwb) as the near-term catalysts (cite SK994CBWR). 3) specify 1–2 explicit catalysts and milestones for the next 3–6 months (e.g., Q3 earnings visibility, progress on international expansion, uptake of N2 bubbler, any order/instrumentation news) and tie each to a watch-list signal with a defined threshold. 4) quantify impact scenarios: provide a concise sensitivity frame (e.g., if discount rate falls 50–100bp, what range of multiple/EV uplift would you expect on ACMR given flat/accelerating earnings; if ACMR hits the top end of guidance and expands international revenue, show potential upside to a base-case stock fair value). Do not rely on qualitative platitudes; anchor every claim to the cited figures. 5) tighten the balance-sheet/operating-mmo linkage: contrast ACMR’s 49.4% gross margin and 13.8% net margin with peer/industry dynamics and show how an earnings ramp could convert into FCF in the near term, referencing the 23% debt/equity, and the repeated emphasis on product-cycle leverage in the articles. 6) explicit invalidation signals: a sustained delay in rate cuts beyond Q3, a material Q3 miss on revenue or EPS, or a higher-risk export-control regime that materially dampens WFE capex; these should clearly terminate or reweight the bull-case scenario. 7) present a concise base-case end-state for 3–6 months (stock path, earnings trajectory, and a recalibrated valuation range) plus 1–2 alternate outcomes and a watch-list with 4–6 signals; assign a transparent confidence level (e.g., base 60–70%, upside 15–25%, downside 20–30%). 8) ensure no content duplication and place citations immediately after facts drawn from the sources (C22MKA9VY after rate-path and Powell/treasury notes; SK994CBWR after Q2 results, guidance, and N2 bubbling technology). This sharpening will elevate depth, maintain strict source discipline, and deliver a coherent, testable 3–6 month investment thesis.",
