Because it's also the end of the summer season, you'll find great deals on all things outdoor. This includes patio furniture, lawnmowers, grills and more. However, every category has tons of savings, not just outdoors.\n\nWhere are the best Labor Day sales?\n\nThere are Labor Day sales going on everywhere. Just about every retailer is participating in Labor Day sales. This includes favorite retailers like Amazon, Best Buy and Walmart.\n\nWhen do Labor Day sales start and end?\n\nThe official date for Labor Day is Monday, Sept. 1, but many sales kicked off much earlier and a few will stick around for a few extra days -- including Home Depot's. However, some other retailer are wrapping up their sales as soon as tonight, so don't wait too long to do your shopping.\n\nHow we choose the best Labor Day deals\n\nAt CNET, we have a team of expert shoppers and deal-hunters whose experience spans years of helping buyers understand which major sales and deals are legitimately good and which are more routine. That includes Black Friday, Prime Day, Fourth of July and countless other shopping events. We've gotten very good at weeding out scams and superficial deals. We look for real discounts, quality reviews and remaining sale time when choosing a deal to show you.\n\u2022 Real discounts mean exactly that. We look at the price history for all items sold at Home Depot to make sure no manufacturers are inflating prices to make the discount seem more substantial than it is.\n\u2022 Quality reviews are important for any product, but especially for big purchase items like grills, furniture and appliances. If it breaks the first time you use it, the discount isn't really worthwhile.\n\u2022 Remaining sale time is a huge part of our vetting process. If a deal seems like it will only be around for a short while or will only be available for the remaining stock, we'll let you know upfront so you don't come back to the deal later only to be disappointed.",

Multiple retailers offer markdowns across a wide variety of models and sizes, giving you a top-notch selection to choose from at great prices. Plus, once Labor Day has passed, there isn't another major holiday shopping event until Black Friday so you may be waiting a while to catch another great deal.\nHow much should you spend on a TV?\nThere is no right or wrong answer to this question. The important things to consider when shopping for a TV are your needs and your budget. There are plenty of cheap TV deals available to shop, but some of those models won't offer all of the features a more premium model may. Additionally, if you want an OLED display, that's going to cost significantly more than LED and other models.\nSize also tends to play into how much you'll spend, but for a standard entertainment area like a living room, you'll probably want to invest in a TV that is at least 55 inches, although 65 inches or larger is best in most cases. For bedrooms, you should opt for a model at least 43 inches in size.\nIf you're going to splurge, spending more on a larger screen, rather than better specs, will probably make the biggest impact.\nWill tariffs affect Labor Day TV prices?\nTariff-induced inflation is on everyone's mind -- especially with holiday shopping just around the corner. Unfortunately, TVs are likely to be significantly affected by the price increases, particularly those made by Chinese manufacturers like Hisense, TCL and Vizio, which could rise by as much as 15%. Japanese and Korean brands like LG, Samsung and Sony are slightly more insulated. If you know you're going to be upgrading your TV soon, we'd recommend taking advantage of these Labor Day deals, rather than waiting for the holidays.\nRead more: Why You Can (Probably) Get a Bigger TV Than You Think\nWhat items are on sale for Labor Day?\nLabor Day offers plenty of savings on big-ticket items like mattresses and TVs, but you'll also find plenty of end-of-season sales on grills, yard tools, patio furniture and gardening supplies, as well as summer apparel and tech gear like headphones, laptops and tablets.\nRead more: How We Test TVs at CNET\nHow we choose the best Labor Day TV deals\nMany of us here at CNET have covered shopping events for more than five years, including Black Friday, Memorial Day, Prime Day and countless other shopping events. In that time, we've learned how to spot the best deals among a sea of thousands of superficial offers and scams and we highlight only the best offers from trusted retailers. We look for real discounts, quality reviews and remaining sale time when choosing television deals to show you.\n- Real discounts mean genuine savings. We check pricing history for products listed as on sale, so we know when it's a case of an inflated list price rather than an actual discount.\n- Quality reviews and testing are super important for any product. A discount isn't worthwhile if it results in a subpar product experience, no matter how much you saved.\n- Remaining sale time is important, too. Some deals are around for only a short time or may be limited in supply. If that's the case, we'll let you know upfront so you don't come back to the deal later only to be disappointed.\nTop deals available today, according to CNET's shopping experts\nCurated discounts worth shopping while they last.\n- AirPods Pro 2: $169 (save $80)\n- Amazon Echo Auto: $20 (save $35)\n- Xgimi Halo Plus portable projector: $499 (save $301)\n- Ecovacs Deebot T30S combo robot vacuum and mop: $650 (save $550)\n- Blink Video Doorbell Outdoor 4 (3-pack) and Sync Module Core bundle: $135 (save $115)"

If you've always wanted the benefits of Prime but haven't made the jump, now's a great time to subscribe. Subscribing now could lead to significant savings since tariffs are expected to raise prices on a lot of goods. A recent CNET survey found that 64% of shoppers have bought or plan to buy tech products soon to avoid price increases or shortages. In fact, 16% of shoppers say they're using Prime Day to start their holiday shopping well ahead of the holiday season, according to a new RetailMeNot survey. (Disclosure: RetailMeNot is owned by the same parent company as CNET, Ziff Davis.)\nRead more: How to Sign Up for a Prime Membership\nPrevious Amazon Prime Day dates\nSince Amazon launched its first Prime Day sale in 2015, the company has scheduled the event for around the same time of year. Outside of a couple of recent years, Amazon has traditionally kicked off its main sale event around the middle two weeks of July and 2025 is no exception.\nHere are the previous Amazon Prime Day dates:\n- Prime Day 2015: July 15\n- Prime Day 2016: July 12\n- Prime Day 2017: July 11 to 12\n- Prime Day 2018: July 16 to 17\n- Prime Day 2019: July 15 to 16\n- Prime Day 2020: Oct. 13 to 14\n- Prime Day 2021: June 21 to 22\n- Prime Day 2022: July 12 to 13\n- Prime Early Access Sale 2022: Oct. 11 to 12\n- Prime Day 2023: July 11 to 12\n- Prime Big Deal Days 2023: Oct. 10 to 11\n- Prime Day 2024: July 16 to 17\n- Prime Big Deal Days 2024: Oct. 8 to 9\n- Big Spring Sale 2025: March 20 to 25\n- Prime Day 2025: July 8 to 11\nWill tariffs affect this year's Prime Day deals?\nTariffs are top of mind for most Americans and it could affect this year's Prime Day event. Prices on items like electronics could very well increase, with companies like Apple trying to avoid tariffs by moving manufacturing operations elsewhere. The tariffs were paused earlier this month, but only until Wednesday, right after Prime Day began.\nWhat is Prime Day?\nAmazon began the annual Prime Day tradition in 2015. Ever since, bargain hunters have eagerly awaited its return every summer. The Prime Day sale event has historically taken place in July, and this year is no exception. Amazon often has other sales throughout the year, including a second Prime Day-like sale in October and the Big Spring Sale in March.\nThis year's Prime Day is here -- though not for much longer. We've covered all the essentials, including everything from signing up for Amazon Prime and returning Prime Day purchases to getting Prime Day deals free and using extra Prime perks.\nHow we choose deals\nCNET has a team of shopping experts and deal hunters who have operated across major sales events for many years, making sure you understand when a deal is worth taking advantage of or when it's worth skipping. Whether it's for Black Friday, Memorial Day, the Fourth of July or Prime Day, we have the expertise to make sure you get the best deal possible.\nTo do this, we look for real discounts, quality reviews and remaining sale time when choosing an offer to show you.\n- Real discounts mean real discounts. We look at the price history for that product to make sure no manufacturers are inflating prices to make the discount seem more substantial than it is.\n- Quality reviews are equally important for any product, but particularly for deeply discounted items. If it breaks the first time you use it, the discount isn't really worthwhile.\n- Remaining sale time is a huge part of our vetting process. If a deal seems like it will only be around for a short while or will only be available for the remaining stock, we'll let you know in advance, so you don't return later only to be disappointed.\nWe are also considering the rising costs associated with tariffs to help you find items worth buying now.\nRead more: Tariff Tracker: We're Watching Prices for 11 Products You Might Need to Buy\nHow to keep up with the best Prime Day sales\nThere are a lot of ways to ensure you're getting the latest scoop on Prime Day deals.

Need gift ideas for birthdays, anniversaries and other events? Our gift guide includes a huge range of suggestions for every occasion.\nBest Labor Day retailer sales\nAmazon: One of the biggest online retailers is going all-in on the Labor Day discounts with significant savings on tech, home appliances and smart home equipment.\nWalmart: Save big on appliances like televisions, refrigerators, laptops and more at Walmart's Labor Day sale.\nThe Home Depot: Eyeing home improvement tools? Home Depot has the best discounts on tools, appliances and even grills.\nCasper: If you've been on the lookout for a new mattress, Casper is offering 35% off its entire line. In fact, there's a 30% discount across the website, so you might want to take a look even if you're not in the market for a new mattress.\nBest Buy: Shop incredible Labor Day deals on laptops, headphones, televisions and more.\nWhich Labor Day sales are the best?\nThere are plenty of competing Labor Day sales and deciding which is best for you will depend on what you're hoping to buy.\nAmazon, Best Buy and Walmart are generally good starting points if tech and smart home purchases are on your mind. If home and garden products are what you need, start with stores like Home Depot, Lowe's and Overstock.\nDon't rule out more niche retailers, such as B&H Photo, Dell, GameStop and HP, though, if their Labor Day promotions suit your needs. You can also shop direct at your favorite brands for Labor Day deals.\nWhen do Labor Day sales end?\nLabor Day 2025 falls on Monday, Sept. 1, but not all sales begin and end on that date. Many sales kicked off last week and will run beyond today. Retailers like Amazon and Best Buy might shut up shop for Labor Day-specific savings after Sept. 1, but expect mattress makers and appliance savings to continue through this week.\nShould I wait for Black Friday sales?\nLabor Day sales offer some of the best savings at this time of year, sitting nicely between summer's Prime Day sale and Black Friday in the fall. If you need something now, particularly furniture or yard equipment, Labor Day is a great time to buy, with end-of-summer pricing applying to a lot of those products.\nBlack Friday is the biggest sale of the year, though, and if you can afford to wait the extra couple of months, you could potentially get more for your money. That being said, rumors abound of a second Prime Day sale (or Prime Big Deal Days, as it was called last year) slated for October, which could kick off the holiday shopping season much earlier and may mean even less time between Labor Day and traditional fall sales.\nHow do I make the most of Labor Day sales?\nBefore diving into Labor Day sales, narrow down exactly what is on your shopping list this year. That way, you can identify the best retailers to start your search and avoid being distracted by the thousands of deals that will bombard you as you explore the last-minute Labor Day sales.\nThe CNET Deals team will keep you up to date on the best deals this Labor Day and beyond, so be sure to follow the team on X and sign up for the CNET Deals newsletter."

That includes Black Friday, Prime Day, Fourth of July and countless other shopping events. We've gotten good at weeding out scams and superficial deals. We look for real discounts, quality reviews and remaining sale time when choosing a deal to show you.\n- Real discounts mean exactly that. We look at the price history for all items sold at Best Buy to make sure no manufacturers are inflating prices to make the discount seem more substantial than it is.\n- Quality reviews are important for any product, but especially for big purchase items like grills, furniture and appliances. If it breaks the first time you use it, the discount isn't really worthwhile.\n- Remaining sale time is a huge part of our vetting process. If a deal seems like it will only be around for a short while or will only be available for the remaining stock, we'll let you know upfront so you don't come back to the deal later only to be disappointed."
