  "title": "Camila Giorgi re-emerges in Italy after 'fleeing over alleged tax evasion'",
  "description": "Following her mysterious retirement from tennis and exit from Italy, former Olympic Games quarter-finalist Camila Giorgi has now re-emerged in her home country.",
  "content": "She was there for the premiere of 'The Smashing Machine', a film featuring Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson which chronicles the life of former MMA fighter Mark Kerr. Her appearance back in her home country came as a surprise to many fans who are aware of the accusations against her, despite her lawyers Federico Marini and Cristian Carmelo Nicotra previously insisting she would be returning. In an interview with Italian chat show Verissimo, Giorgi laughed at suggesions she owed up to six months worth of rent for a villa she lived in. When asked if she left Italy and moved to the USA to escape these accusations, she said: \"It was not an escape. I moved to America permanently with my parents.\" Addressing her retirement, she also said it was coincidental her decision to walk away from tennis was made just as an investigation into her finances by the Guardia di Finanza, an Italian law enforcement agency which deals with financial crime, was concluded. She insists the tax evasion allegations were down to a lawyer who had worked with her before. Giorgi said: \u201cThe problems with the tax authorities? My family did not know about them. They were created by outside people who managed me and did this as a job. We did not flee for tax reasons. I never fled, I never spoke.\"\n\nWhen pushed on the insinuation she had either refused to pay rent or witheld payments, she sarcastically replied: \"We did not pay the rent and we took the furniture? The house had no furniture, we bought it ourselves.\u201d To be the first to receive the latest tennis news, join our WhatsApp community or tennis newsletter At the start of the year, Giorgi found work in tennis media, carrying out interviews with players while at the ATP 250 event in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in February. In November of last year, she also said she had been living in South American and was in a relationship with Argentine politician Ramiro Marra, saying it was \"love at first sight\" on her social media page. As a player, her most memorable displays in Grand Slams were her runs to the last 16 of the 2013 US Open as well as her journey to the quarter-finals of Wimbledon in 2018. She was also one round away from competing for a medal at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics when she got all the way to the quarters while representing Italy.",
