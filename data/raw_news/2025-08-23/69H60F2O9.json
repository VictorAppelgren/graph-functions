  "title": "An \u2018existential gamble\u2019: Why some experts are worried as SpaceX gears up for next Starship test",
  "description": "SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket system, the most powerful launch vehicle ever constructed, is set to make its 10th integrated test flight as soon as Sunday evening.",
  "content": "The most powerful rocket system ever constructed is headed for its next test \u2014 using a version of the vehicle that has been at the center of a series of explosive missteps and failures.\n\nSpaceX said it is aiming to launch its Starship megarocket on an hour-long test flight as soon as 7:30 p.m. ET Sunday, though the liftoff time is subject to change. A webcast of the event is expected to begin about 30 minutes earlier, according to the company.\n\nThe uncrewed Starship prototype will follow a similar flight plan to the last three missions and aim to complete test objectives left untried during those tests, all of which ended prematurely. SpaceX debuted the current generation of Starship vehicles in January, following a clean run of test missions with a slightly scaled-down version of the rocket in 2024.\n\nBut since that debut, the vehicle has twice exploded over populated islands east of Florida, creating debris that hit roadways in Turks and Caicos and washed up onto the shores of Bahamian islands. The spacecraft also spun out of control as it headed toward its landing site in the Indian Ocean on its last test flight in May.\n\nThen, in June, a Starship spacecraft that had been strapped to an engine testing stand at the company\u2019s launch and development facilities in South Texas abruptly exploded \u2014 spewing shrapnel and causing damage to SpaceX infrastructure.\n\nThese setbacks roused long-standing SpaceX critics and attracted new ones, including the Mexican government, which has threatened legal action against the company over reported debris on and around its shores. The UK government also said in a statement Thursday that it\u2019s been \u201cworking closely with US Government partners to protect the safety\u201d of its overseas territories, including Turks and Caicos.\n\nThe string of mishaps this year has also raised concerns among spaceflight experts and stakeholders who have emphasized that the United States has a lot riding on Starship\u2019s eventual success, including its plans to return humans to the moon as soon as 2027.\n\nAnd that success is not guaranteed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very, very difficult to predict how this is going to end up,\u201d said Garrett Reisman, a former NASA astronaut and SpaceX consultant who is a professor of astronautical engineering at the University of Southern California.\n\n\u201cI think it could end up never working, or it could end up revolutionizing our entire future of activities in space \u2014 and geopolitics,\u201d he added, referring to the US goal of displaying technical superiority to China in a new space race.\n\nWhy SpaceX is allowed to fly again\n\nSpaceX said it implemented changes to the Starship system slated to fly this weekend in response to the last in-flight failure in May.\n\nThose alterations include adjustments to a component called a fuel diffuser, which the company believes malfunctioned during the last flight, causing higher-than-expected pressure to build up in Starship\u2019s nose cone. It is likely what caused the vehicle to spiral out of control, according to a technical overview SpaceX published last week.\n\nDespite the series of recent problems, the Federal Aviation Administration \u2014 which licenses commercial rocket launches \u2014 said last week it had closed its investigation into SpaceX\u2019s latest mishap and approved the company\u2019s plans to fly Sunday\u2019s mission.\n\nUnder current laws and regulations, the FAA is tasked solely with ensuring that commercial rocket companies do not pose a risk to public property or bystanders\u2019 safety.\n\n\u201cThere are no reports of public injury or damage to public property. The FAA oversaw and accepted the findings of the SpaceX-led investigation,\u201d the agency said in an August 15 statement. \u201cSpaceX identified corrective actions to prevent a reoccurrence of the event.\u201d\n\nIn its update, SpaceX also made clear that the version of Starship that has experienced so many issues will soon be retired.\n\n\u201cTwo flights remain with the current generation, each with test objectives designed to expand the envelope on vehicle capabilities,\u201d according to a company blog post.\n\nSpaceX CEO Elon Musk has already been teasing plans for larger, more ambitious iterations of the vehicle that would stretch even taller and carry more propellant.\n\nNow it appears clear that SpaceX will pursue that scaled-up version of Starship \u2014 which is already more than twice as powerful as the NASA rockets that powered the Apollo moon landings \u2014 whether or not the current line of Starship prototypes ever pulls off a successful test flight.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that a bigger upgrade might solve the current problem,\u201d Reisman said. \u201cIt also could introduce new problems \u2014 you never know.\u201d\n\nNotably, the US government has taken several steps that could aide SpaceX in its efforts to expedite Starship testing.\n\nIn May, the FAA approved the company\u2019s plans to launch Starship as many as 25 times per year from Texas, up from the five it had been previously authorized to conduct.\n\nAnd earlier this month, President Donald Trump \u2014 despite a public and vitriolic falling out with Musk in June \u2014 issued an executive order that appears designed to scale back roadblocks and regulatory oversight for private-sector rocket operations, including environmental reviews.\n\nMeanwhile, the stakes appear to be growing with each Starship test flight, as SpaceX is racing against the clock.\n\nNot only does Musk want to send one of the vehicles on an uncrewed flight to Mars when the next opportunity arises in 2026, but NASA also plans to send its astronauts to the lunar surface aboard one of the vehicles as soon as mid-2027 as part of a $2.9 billion contract.\n\n\u201cWe made this bet\u201d on Starship, said Janet Petro, who served as acting NASA administrator until July. \u201cThey have had a rough year, but SpaceX is a pretty intense and motivated company.\u201d\n\nPetro added she had \u201cfull confidence\u201d that SpaceX will refine Starship\u2019s design and get the vehicle working.\n\nReisman, the former SpaceX adviser, said he is also hopeful but less certain.\n\n\u201cSpaceX has made an existential gamble on Starship,\u201d Reisman said, adding that he is concerned about the rate of progress SpaceX has been making with Starship. \u201cThey\u2019re pouring a tremendous amount of money and resources into its development \u2026 but at some point, the laws of financial physics still apply.\u201d\n\nWhat SpaceX hopes to achieve with Flight 10\n\nIf all goes according to plan with Starship\u2019s next flight, referred to as Flight 10, the 400-foot-tall Starship launch system will take off from SpaceX\u2019s facilities in South Texas and soar out over the waters off the coast.\n\nThe bottom portion of the rocket system that gives the initial burst of power at liftoff, called Super Heavy, will attempt to make a controlled splashdown off the Texas coast, according to SpaceX.\n\nFor this mission, the company will not attempt to repeat its dramatic Super Heavy \u201cchopsticks\u201d landing in which the rocket booster steers itself back into the arms of the tower from which it launched. SpaceX said it will instead put the booster through a series of tests designed to push the vehicle to its limits \u201cto gather real-world performance data\u201d that could mimic a future mission that does not go as planned.\n\nMeanwhile, the upper Starship spacecraft, which is designed to one day carry cargo or convoys of astronauts but will haul only dummy satellites for this mission, will continue flying through space.\n\nDuring the flight, Starship will attempt to deploy the eight satellite \u201csimulators\u201d as well as relight one of the spacecraft\u2019s rocket engines in space. SpaceX has failed to hit both of those milestones in its last three test missions.\n\nEven if this V2 Starship prototype meets a similarly ill fate, SpaceX is likely once again to frame the test flight as a success.\n\nThe company employs an engineering philosophy called \u201crapid iterative development,\u201d which emphasizes a pursuit of launching relatively cheap prototypes on frequent test missions over extensive ground testing or other less risky simulations.\n\nBecause of its unique development approach, SpaceX has been known to embrace fiery mishaps. The company has said that even failed test flights help engineers improve Starship\u2019s design \u2014 quicker than if SpaceX employed alternative engineering approaches.\n\n\u201cEvery lesson learned, through both flight and ground testing, continues to feed directly into designs for the next generation of Starship and Super Heavy,\u201d SpaceX\u2019s August 15 statement reads. \u201cTwo flights remain with the current generation, each with test objectives designed to expand the envelope on vehicle capabilities as we iterate towards fully and rapidly reusable, reliable rockets.\u201d\n\nSpaceX\u2019s development approach, while often seen as risky and brazen, has served the company well in the past.\n\nRarely has one of the company\u2019s rockets malfunctioned once it leaves the development stage and becomes operational. The company\u2019s human spaceflight track record, using Falcon 9 rockets, has been spotless.\n\nAnd if Starship does eventually work, Reisman said, it won\u2019t only be SpaceX \u2014 or even NASA \u2014 that benefits.\n\n\u201cThe entire space industry is hoping and betting on Starship working, because if it achieves its promise, it\u2019ll also be a revolution in affordability,\u201d Reisman said. \u201cI think there\u2019s causes for optimism and pessimism \u2014 and I think it\u2019s very, very difficult to predict how this is going to end up.\u201d\n\nSign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter.

      "text": "President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he is directing Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to be the interim NASA administrator.\n\u201cSean is doing a TREMENDOUS job in handling our Country\u2019s Transportation Affairs, including creating a state-of-the-art Air Traffic Control systems, while at the same time rebuilding our roads and bridges, making them efficient, and beautiful, again. He will be a fantastic leader of the ever more important Space Agency, even if only for a short period of time. Congratulations, and thank you, Sean,\u201d the president wrote in a post on Truth Social Wednesday.\n\u201cHonored to accept this mission. Time to take over space. Let\u2019s launch,\u201d Duffy wrote on X shortly after the president\u2019s post.\nTrump\u2019s post did not clarify the status of Janet Petro, the director of the Kennedy Space Center in Florida who has been serving as NASA\u2019s interim chief since the start of Trump\u2019s second term. She was still listed as the administrator on the agency\u2019s website Thursday.\nIn late May, the president rescinded his nomination of tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to lead NASA, citing a \u201cthorough review of prior associations.\u201d\nThe shake-up came just days before the Senate was expected to vote on the nomination of Isaacman, who has twice traveled to space on private missions and has close ties to billionaire and SpaceX chief Elon Musk.\n\u201cAfter a thorough review of prior associations, I am hereby withdrawing the nomination of Jared Isaacman to head NASA. I will soon announce a new Nominee who will be Mission aligned, and put America First in Space,\u201d the president said at the time.\nCNN has previously reported NASA administrators are typically selected from a pool of scientists, engineers, academics or public servants. Effectively leading the $25 billion agency \u2014 and securing funding for projects NASA hopes to accomplish \u2014 routinely requires the agency\u2019s chief to work with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\nThe president, discussing Isaacman\u2019s nomination in a long social media post railing against Musk over the weekend, said that he thought it would have been \u201cinappropriate that a very close friend of Elon \u2026 run NASA.\u201d\n\u201cI also thought it inappropriate that a very close friend of Elon, who was in the Space Business, run NASA, when NASA is such a big part of Elon\u2019s corporate life,\u201d the president wrote in the post.\nMusk, formerly a close Trump ally who led the Department of Government Efficiency, departed the administration in early June, and his relationship with the president has broken down in recent weeks following a disagreement over Trump\u2019s sweeping agenda package.\nMusk and Duffy sparred at a March cabinet meeting, according to a source familiar, when the Transportation secretary accused the tech billionaire of trying to fire air traffic controllers.\nDuffy is not the only member of the president\u2019s Cabinet to take up an additional job outside of their traditional purview. Secretary of State Marco Rubio currently serves as interim national security adviser and national archivist.\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nThe promise of starting life anew on Mars may appear alluring, even feasible, as the climate crisis intensifies and space and rocket technology advances.\nBut the reality would be dreadful, according to one book that argues that Elon Musk\u2019s intention to settle the red planet within the next 30 years is doomed to failure.\nWritten by Kelly and Zach Weinersmith, \u201cA City on Mars: Can We Settle Space, Should We Settle Space, and Have We Really Thought This Through?\u201d won the 2024 Royal Society Trivedi Science Book Prize and was published in November 2023.\nThe husband-and-wife authors investigate what life would actually be like in the unforgiving environment of the red planet and clear up any misconceptions about what it might involve.\nKelly Weinersmith, a biologist and an adjunct assistant professor at Rice University in Houston, and, Zach Weinersmith, a cartoonist, delve into all sorts of questions that humans would face if we became a multiplanetary species. How would we build space farms to feed everyone? What about giving birth to babies and raising kids? Would settling Mars unleash a new space race?\nInitially enthusiastic about the prospect of humans living on Mars, the authors said their research turned them into space settlement skeptics. \u201cLeaving a 2 (degree Celsius) warmer Earth for Mars would be like leaving a messy room so you can live in a toxic waste dump,\u201d they wrote in the book\u2019s introduction.\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nCNN: Why did you want to write this book?\nKelly Weinersmith: We\u2019re geeks. We were pretty excited about space settlement happening. We had written a book called \u201cSoonish: Ten Emerging Technologies That Will Improve and/or Ruin Everything,\u201d and two of the emerging technologies we talked about in that book were cheaper access to space and asteroid mining. Between those two technologies, we thought, we can either now ship up all the equipment we need to keep humans alive in space, or we can use space resources to build space settlements. So even though people have been saying for decades that this is coming soon, we thought maybe now it finally is coming.\nCNN: But that\u2019s not what you concluded after researching and writing the book?\nKW: The more we got into it \u2014 by year two out of the four-year research process, we were like, OK, there\u2019s a lot of stuff we don\u2019t know that we still need to figure out. And if we do this soon, it could be an ethical catastrophe.\nCNN: Can humans settle Mars in the near term?\nKW: Musk is saying that in the next 30 years, we\u2019re going to have a million people on Mars. No way that you could scale up to a million people on Mars without something catastrophic happening, either in terms of it turns out we can\u2019t have babies up there, and moms and babies are dying or getting cancer.\nIf you want to do this, it\u2019s got to be the slow work of generations to build up to a point where we could be self-sustaining on Mars.\nIt\u2019s such a harsh environment requiring complicated equipment to keep you alive, and I just can\u2019t see that happening on Mars in the near term.\nCNN: What is achievable then in our current lifetime?\nKW: Lots of research, and that\u2019s exciting, I think. I would love to see, for example, a research station on the moon where we have rodent colonies, and we see how they do when they go through a couple generations. Maybe in our lifetime, we\u2019ll see people land on Mars, do some exploration and come home, that could happen, but I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to have babies on Mars.\nCNN: You highlight reproduction as one of the major challenges. Why\u2019s that?\nKW: One of the places we started was biology and medical stuff. That was our first eye-opening moment. I think we had assumed the 50 years of research we had gotten from astronauts in the space stations orbiting Earth had told us everything we needed to know about how humans respond in gravity regimes unlike Earth\u2019s, and how humans respond to space radiation.\nBut it turns out that the astronauts (there) are protected by the magnetosphere (a protective bubble surrounding Earth\u2019s atmosphere), and we do know that being in free fall, which is essentially like experiencing zero gravity, is predictably bad for bones, for muscles. That microgravity explains why vision tends to degrade over time, and being in space could result in cognitive declines long-term.\nThe longest stay in space has been less than a year and a half, and astronauts predictably experience something like 1% bone loss in their hips every month. Even if that goes down to just 0.1% every month on Mars (where gravity is 38% of Earth\u2019s surface gravity), you could imagine that being really bad, for example, when labor kicks in and you\u2019ve got to hope that your hips are strong enough to handle it. We were just surprised by how many problems we thought we had a handle on. But it turns out that we have very little relevant data for how adults will do, let alone how having babies would work out.\nZach Weinersmith: There needs to be a lot more research in reproduction, simply because it\u2019s a big, open question. It could be completely benign for all we know \u2014 we would be surprised by that, but there should be a lot more research on that. Prima facie, the assumption should be that (babies) are going to have a higher-than-normal rate of abnormalities that have to be dealt with without any of the kind of (medical) care we take for granted on Earth.\nCNN: Why is the environment on Mars so hostile?\nZW: The fundamental thing is to understand that humans evolved on Earth, and Mars just lacks a lot of the stuff that we have on Earth. It\u2019s about 40% gravity and we know that humans in microgravity have all sorts of major problems, and what happens at 40% we just don\u2019t know.\nThe soil is laden in perchlorate, which is known to cause hormone disruption. We actually don\u2019t have a lot of data on prolonged exposure to high levels of this stuff, because why would we? But presumably it\u2019s not great for developing humans.\nYou have an extremely thin atmosphere. Essentially that means you cannot go outside without a pressure suit. The atmosphere is nevertheless powerful enough to whip up worldwide dust storms and also large, localized ones. There is also this stuff called regolith, which has jagged stone and glass, all that is hurling around, which is bad for equipment, bad for humans. Also, if you\u2019re intending to use solar power, you better have a really good backup system, and you\u2019re going to have to spend a huge amount of time maintaining it.\nAlso, if you\u2019re anywhere near the surface, you\u2019re exposed to high levels of radiation, because the Martian atmosphere is so thin, and because Mars is only very weakly magnetic, it doesn\u2019t have a very powerful magnetosphere like the Earth has.\nKW: Mars, on average, is 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) away, which means there is always going to be a communication delay: (at least) three minutes, and sometimes as much as 22 to 24 minutes. So if there is an emergency, you can never make a live call to physicians back on Earth.\nCNN: What about space governance?\nKW: There are a lot of unknowns there. In 1967, we got the Outer Space Treaty through the United Nations, and that is the main document that governs space. It\u2019s only some 2,000 words long. It\u2019s a very short document, and it specifically was meant to be vague, because the people who wrote it knew that you can\u2019t really predict how the future is going to unfold. Now we\u2019re at the point where things are starting to get cooking in space, but we don\u2019t have clear guidelines for what\u2019s allowed. You\u2019re definitely not allowed to claim sovereignty.\nAlso, anybody who goes to space is the responsibility of some nation, so Musk would almost certainly be the responsibility of the United States.\nSome questions are less clear, like what are you allowed to do with resources in space. You have this lack of clarity about who\u2019s allowed to go where, how long they are allowed to stay there, what they are allowed to do with those resources, you could imagine the space race part two between the United States and China. This time, instead of just going and coming back, which doesn\u2019t prohibit anybody else from doing the same thing, you land and you create a research station in the best part (of Mars or the moon), that means that somebody else can\u2019t use that spot anymore. So we can imagine there being higher stakes this time around, which is a bit concerning, given current geopolitical circumstances between China and the US.\nCNN: How would we feed ourselves on Mars?\nZW: Something else that needs a huge amount of research is closed loop ecology. That is, say, how do you have an underground, sealed bubble that is a sort of intensive agricultural area that produces oxygen and other consumables? We don\u2019t really know how to do that."

In 1969, the United States landed the first humans on the Moon. In the years since, premier space companies from around the world have been drawn to launch rockets and satellites from the United States, incentivized by its infrastructure and support for commercial space activities. Americans are more prosperous because of the space research and development occurring here.\nIt is imperative that we build on the far-reaching actions taken by my Administration during my first term to ensure that new space-based industries, space exploration capabilities, and cutting-edge defense systems are pioneered in America rather than by our adversaries. Ensuring that United States operators can efficiently launch, conduct missions in space, and reenter United States airspace is critical to economic growth, national security, and accomplishing Federal space objectives.\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to enhance American greatness in space by enabling a competitive launch marketplace and substantially increasing commercial space launch cadence and novel space activities by 2030. To accomplish this, the Federal Government will streamline commercial license and permit approvals for United States-based operators.\nSec. 3. Reforming Regulatory Barriers to Commercial Launch and Reentry. (a) The Secretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality, shall, consistent with applicable law, use all available authorities to eliminate or expedite the Department of Transportation\u2019s environmental reviews for, and other obstacles to the granting of, launch and reentry licenses and permits. Such measures shall include the exercise of authority by the Secretary of Transportation under 51 U.S.C. 50905(b)(2)(C) as applicable; determining which Department of Transportation functions are not subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA); and, as appropriate, establishing categorical exclusions under NEPA (or relying on existing categorical exclusions) for launch and reentry licenses and permits within certain parameters.\n(b) The Secretary of Transportation shall reevaluate, amend, or rescind, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, the regulations at Part 450 of title 14, Code of Federal Regulations. The Secretary\u2019s evaluation, amendment, or rescission shall specifically address:\n(i) what regulatory requirements should be inapplicable for a launch or reentry vehicle that possesses a flight termination system or automated flight safety system;\n(ii) what regulatory requirements should be inapplicable or waived for hybrid launch or reentry vehicles that hold valid Federal Aviation Administration airworthiness certificates;\n(iii) whether to expand the conditions that demonstrate reliability for a reentry vehicle, sufficient to protect against a high-consequence event on reentry; and\n(iv) whether other existing requirements are too attenuated to a vehicle\u2019s actual launch or reentry to warrant retention in Part 450.\n(c) Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Transportation shall report to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy a description of the actions that have been or will be taken pursuant to subsection (b) of this section.\nSec. 4. Reforming Regulatory Barriers to Next Generation Spaceport Infrastructure. (a) The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), shall, within 180 days of the date of this order, conduct an evaluation of relevant States\u2019 compliance under the Coastal Zone Management Act pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1458, the effect of any lack of compliance on the development of spaceport infrastructure, and whether State approvals under that Act should be revoked. The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Administrator of NASA shall also notify the Department of Justice of any State or local limitations on spaceport development on Federal lands that may be inconsistent with Federal law.\n(b) Within 180 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Administrator of NASA shall execute a memorandum of understanding that aligns review processes for spaceport development across agencies, eliminates those that are duplicative, and preserves required Federal space-exploration and National Security Space Launch capacity.\n(c) The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Administrator of NASA shall, consistent with applicable law, use all available authorities to expedite their respective environmental and administrative reviews for authorizations, permits, approval, real property leases, and any other activity relevant to spaceport infrastructure development. The Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality shall coordinate with relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies) on the establishment of new categorical exclusions under NEPA for actions related to spaceport development that normally do not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. Agencies shall, for purposes of establishing these categorical exclusions, rely on any sufficient basis to do so as each such agency determines.\n(d) The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Administrator of NASA shall, mindful of the significant national security imperatives inherent in commercial space advancement, consider for all spaceport development projects whether to submit an application to the Endangered Species Committee pursuant to 16 U.S.C. 1536(e).\nSec. 5. Reforming Novel Space Activity Authorization. Within 150 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce shall propose a process for individualized mission authorizations for activities that are covered by Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, but not clearly or straightforwardly governed by existing regulatory frameworks, with the goal of expediting and streamlining authorizations to enable American space competitiveness and superiority. This proposal must solicit and consider affected agencies\u2019 feedback on the authorization process, contain a definitive timeline for the grant or denial of authorization for proposed activities, and include clear and consistent requirements for applicants. The Secretary of Commerce shall transmit the proposal to the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy, the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, and the Assistant to the President for Science and Technology. Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply to human spaceflight.\nSec. 6. Reforming Regulatory Leadership and Accountability. (a) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Transportation shall establish a position in the Office of the Secretary with the responsibility of advising the Secretary of Transportation on fostering innovation and deregulation in the commercial space transportation industry. The Secretary of Transportation shall further direct the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration to take all necessary steps to appoint a senior executive noncareer employee to be the Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation.\n(b) Within 60 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Commerce shall elevate the Office of Space Commerce into the Office of the Secretary.\nSec. 7. Administrative Note. Where applicable, the functions assigned to the Secretary of Transportation in sections 1 through 5 of this order shall be carried out by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration under the direction of the Secretary of Transportation.\nSec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\n(d) The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Transportation.\nDONALD J. TRUMP\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nAugust 13, 2025."

      "text": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up for CNN\u2019s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country\u2019s rise and how it impacts the world.\nChina launched an uncrewed lunar mission Friday that aims to bring back samples from the far side of the moon for the first time, in a potentially major step forward for the country\u2019s ambitious space program.\nThe Chang\u2019e-6 probe \u2013 China\u2019s most complex robotic lunar mission to date \u2013 blasted off on a Long March-5 rocket from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in south China\u2019s Hainan island, where space fans had gathered to watch the historic moment. The country\u2019s National Space Administration said the launch was a success.\nThe launch marks the start of a mission that aims to be a key milestone in China\u2019s push to become a dominant space power with plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2030 and build a research base on its south pole.\nIt comes as a growing number of countries, including the United States, eye the strategic and scientific benefits of expanded lunar exploration in an increasingly competitive field.\nChina\u2019s planned 53-day mission would see the Chang\u2019e-6 lander touch down in a gaping crater on the moon\u2019s far side, which never faces Earth. China became the first and only country to land on the moon\u2019s far side during its 2019 Chang\u2019e-4 mission.\nAny far-side samples retrieved by the Chang\u2019e-6 lander could help scientists peer back into the evolution of the moon and the solar system itself \u2013 and provide important data to advance China\u2019s lunar ambitions.\n\u201cThe Chang\u2019e-6 aims to achieve breakthroughs in the design and control technology of the moon\u2019s retrograde orbit, intelligent sampling, take-off and ascent technologies, and automatic sample-return on the far side of the moon,\u201d Ge Ping, deputy director of the China National Space Administration\u2019s (CNSA) Center of Lunar Exploration and Space Engineering said last week from the launch site.\nAmbitious mission\nThe Chang\u2019e-6 probe will be a key test for China\u2019s space capabilities in its effort to realize leader Xi Jinping\u2019s \u201ceternal dream\u201d of building the country into a space power.\nChina has made rapid space advancements in recent years, in a field traditionally led by the United States and Russia.\nWith the Chang\u2019e program, launched in 2007 and named for the moon goddess of Chinese mythology, China in 2013 became the first country to achieve a robotic lunar landing in nearly four decades. In 2022, China completed its own orbital space station, the Tiangong.\nThe technically complex Chang\u2019e-6 mission builds on both the Chang\u2019e-4\u2019s 2019 record of landing on the far side of the moon, and Chang\u2019e-5\u2019s 2020 success returning to Earth with near-side moon samples.\nThis time, to communicate with Earth from the moon\u2019s far side, Chang\u2019e-6 must rely on the Queqiao-2 satellite, launched into lunar orbit in March.\nThe probe itself is composed of four parts: an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a reentry module.\nThe mission plan is for the Chang\u2019e-6\u2019s lander to gather moon dust and rocks after touching down in the sprawling, roughly 2,500-kilometer diameter South Pole-Aitken basin, a crater formed some 4 billion years ago.\nAn ascender spacecraft would then transport the samples to the lunar orbiter for transfer to the reentry module and the mission\u2019s return to Earth.\nThe complex mission \u201cgoes through virtually every step\u201d that will be required for Chinese astronauts to land on the moon in the years ahead, according to James Head, a professor emeritus at Brown University who has collaborated with Chinese scientists leading the mission.\nIn addition to returning samples that could yield \u201cfundamental new insights into the origin and early history of the moon and solar system,\u201d the mission also serves as \u201crobotic practice for these steps\u201d to get astronauts to the moon and back, he said.\nChina plans to launch two more missions in the Chang-e series as it nears its 2030 target of sending astronauts to the moon before building a research station in the following decade on the lunar south pole \u2013 a region believed to contain water ice.\nChang\u2019e-7, scheduled for 2026, will aim to search for resources on the moon\u2019s south pole, while Chang\u2019e-8 roughly two years later could look at how to utilize lunar materials to prepare for building the research base, Chinese officials have said.\nCompetitive space\nFriday\u2019s launch comes as multiple nations ramp up their lunar programs amid a growing focus on the potential access to resources and further deep space exploration access that successful moon missions could bring.\nLast year, India landed its first spacecraft on the moon, while Russia\u2019s first lunar mission in decades ended in failure when its Luna 25 probe crashed into the moon\u2019s surface.\nIn January, Japan became the fifth country to land a spacecraft on the moon, though its Moon Sniper lander faced power issues due to an incorrect landing angle. The following month, IM-1, a NASA-funded mission designed by Texas-based private firm Intuitive Machines, touched down close to the south pole.\nThat landing \u2013 the first by a US-made spacecraft in over five decades \u2013 is among several planned commercial missions intended to explore the lunar surface before NASA attempts to return US astronauts there as soon as 2026 and build its scientific base camp.\nNASA administrator Bill Nelson last month appeared to acknowledge that China\u2019s pace \u2013 and concerns about its intentions \u2013 were driving the American urgency to return to the moon, decades after its Apollo-crewed missions.\n\u201cWe believe that a lot of their so-called civilian space program is a military program. I think in effect we are in a race,\u201d Nelson told lawmakers last month, adding his concern that China could try to bar the US or other countries from certain lunar areas if they arrive there first.\nChina has long said it stands for the peaceful use of space, and, like the US, has looked to use its space prowess to cultivate international goodwill.\nThis time, China has said the Chang\u2019e-6 mission carries scientific instruments or payloads from France, Italy, Pakistan and the European Space Agency.\n\u201cChina hopes to strengthen cooperation with its international counterparts and deepen international cooperation in the space field,\u201d Ge of the CNSA told reporters a day ahead of the launch.\nCNN\u2019s Sawn Deng contributed reporting."

      "text": "With the towering SpaceX launch site behind him, Justin LeClaire spotted something astonishing in a grassy, sandflat mosaic of protected wilderness on the southern tip of Texas, near the Gulf of Mexico.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a bird that\u2019s acting really distressed,\u201d said the wildlife biologist, stopping in his tracks and quickly peering through his binoculars. \u201cWhich likely means it has a nest out here.\u201d\nThe bird was a snowy plover, LeClaire said, a species that\u2019s rapidly declined in the area over the past five years since SpaceX started actively testing and launching rockets there. The launch tower juts out of pristine Boca Chica State Park like a futuristic steeple that can be seen from more than 5 miles (8 kilometers) away on a clear day.\nSpaceX\u2019s controversial launch \u2014 and subsequent explosion \u2014 of Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, blasted scattered debris up to the size of small boulders all across the delicate ecosystem around the launchpad in April.\nWhen walking around the area in early June, LeClaire, who works with the Coastal Bend Bays & Estuaries Program, was shocked to find several snowy plovers back in the area and nesting in that debris.\nHe counted seven nests constructed among the rubble, the birds\u2019 earth-tone eggs matching the color of the rusted and charred remnants of the launchpad. Remarkably, the snowy plovers were adapting and using the debris field as a new habitat.\nBut to LeClaire, it was a scary realization.\n\u201cThe little pebbles (small pieces of debris) are providing them habitat,\u201d he said, then pointed to the launch site just a few hundred feet away. \u201cBut as soon as this disturbance comes \u2014 (another) massive rocket launch \u2014 it\u2019s bad news. This is interesting from a scientific perspective, but it\u2019s almost certainly bad for these birds.\u201d\nThe environmental impact of SpaceX in this corner of Texas is part of a growing debate among locals over the presence of Elon Musk\u2019s massive company. While some tout the potential economic boom and job opportunities that SpaceX has brought to the broader Rio Grande Valley, along with the millions of dollars that Musk has pledged to Cameron County, others fear the risk is too great. Working-class residents feel pushed out by surging property taxes and higher home and rental prices.\nEnvironmental activists also worry about turning this treasured part of the Texas coastline \u2014 known for its birdwatching, fishing and clean beaches \u2014 into an industrial space complex.\nSeveral groups are now suing the Federal Aviation Administration and SpaceX, demanding more mitigation to reduce environmental damage. Their goal is to impact how the company operates in the area \u2014 but many see the lawsuit as an uphill battle.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a David and Goliath case,\u201d said local activist Jim Chapman. \u201cWhen you have just a handful of people taking on the FAA and SpaceX, I would not say the cards are stacked in our favor.\u201d\nAn unprecedented launch\nOn April 20, SpaceX successfully launched a test flight of Starship with its massive Super Heavy rocket booster, complete with a whopping 33 engines. With a force that rattled the ground and dazzled tourists who came to watch the historic liftoff, the spacecraft took flight.\nThe rocket failed to light all of its engines at liftoff. And a few minutes into the flight, around the time the rocket was meant to separate from the spacecraft, the Starship began tumbling out of control, forcing SpaceX engineers to detonate Starship and its rocket over the Gulf of Mexico in a fiery blast.\nFor space enthusiasts and spectators, it was a rapturous moment of unprecedented power. SpaceX employees were seen cheering and clapping on the company\u2019s livestream, even amid the explosion. But it didn\u2019t take long for the literal fallout to turn into backlash.\nThe launchpad disintegrated, catapulting massive chunks of concrete and tangled rebar across the state park and Boca Chica peninsula. According to the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the wind carried a plume cloud of pulverized concrete, which rained down pebbles of debris, up to 6.5 miles (10.5 kilometers) inland and blanketed the nearby city of Port Isabel with a particle-filled substance. More than three acres of state park land were scorched in a grassfire.\nJust hours after the spectacle, the FAA grounded SpaceX\u2019s Starship, announcing the agency would oversee a mishap investigation of the test mission to ensure public safety for any future attempts, a routine step after all failed rocket launches.\nPrior to April\u2019s incident, SpaceX prototypes intended solely for testing have exploded in the area for years.\nMusk has repeatedly said he\u2019d like to try to launch Starship again as soon as this summer, but the FAA said in a statement to CNN that SpaceX has yet to take public safety actions or submit a mishap report with corrective actions for FAA review and approval.\nSpaceX did not respond to an interview request or respond to a list of questions for this story, nor has the company responded to routine inquiries from reporters in years.\nLongtime locals fear being pushed out\nThe contrast between the euphoric cheers from space tourists watching Starship take off and the deep-seated resentment among some longtime residents of the area could not be more stark. About a week after the launch, at least two fences in nearby Brownsville \u2014 the seat of Cameron County, Texas \u2014 were spray-painted with \u201cF*ck SpaceX.\u201d\nSome local activists have long been trying to raise awareness about their concerns regarding not just the environmental effects of the space company\u2019s work, but the economic impacts, too.\nJosette Hinojosa, a single mother who grew up in Brownsville, said her rent has jumped from $650 to $1,000 in just two years.\n\u201cPeople just can\u2019t afford the property taxes, so they\u2019re selling their homes,\u201d she said. \u201cRenters who are renting there or who were renting there are just, they have no place to go.\u201d\nProperty values have skyrocketed in this part of Texas, far outpacing the Covid-era surge and statewide increase from recent years. Since SpaceX broke ground in 2014, the median price of a home in Cameron County has jumped 116%, compared with an 86% increase statewide, according to the Texas A&M Real Estate Research Center.\nHinojosa cites a tweet from Musk in March 2021 that encouraged people to move to the greater Brownsville area in Texas, saying SpaceX needs engineers, technicians and builders to support his mission.\nCameron County is one of the poorest counties in Texas, and low-income households are struggling to keep up with the rising cost of living, Hinojosa said. She worries about having to relocate, abandoning an area where several generations of her family have lived.\n\u201cI grew up two blocks down from here,\u201d she said, standing outside the home she\u2019s rented for the past decade. \u201cIt means a lot to me to still be here, to still have friends that I know that still live down the street \u2026 We worry about these things because we know how hard our families work to just be able to acquire that piece of equity, which is property.\u201d\nAn economic boom\nLocal politicians, however, fully support the presence of SpaceX, touting the economic benefits for the area. According to Cameron County Judge Eddie Trevi\u00f1o, Jr., the space company employs about 2,000 people in the Rio Grande Valley.\nAn economic impact study from 2021 \u2014 provided to CNN by Cameron County officials but conducted by SpaceX \u2014 reported that the company generated $903 million in gross economic output for the county that year with $8.1 million generated in sales, property taxes and government fees. The study projected over $900 million in gross economic output for 2023.\nMusk also pledged $30 million to the area in 2021, saying $20 million would go to Cameron County schools and $10 million to the city of Brownsville for downtown revitalization. It\u2019s not clear whether all those funds have been donated.\nTrevi\u00f1o, who is the highest ranking elected official in Cameron County, acknowledged the surging property taxes for locals and the environmental impacts but said county officials are working closely with SpaceX to mitigate those concerns.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made it known we want them to be successful, but not to the detriment of the area,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a certain segment of the community that is not in favor of SpaceX and never will be,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m not invalidating those concerns \u2026 They\u2019re valid concerns, but the great majority of the people that I hear from and speak to are extremely excited.\u201d\nTrevi\u00f1o said the educational impact alone could span generations of students who want to grow up, stay in the area, and be engineers or work in the space industry.\n\u201cAs a county judge, it\u2019s been my goal \u2026 to bring those economic development projects that are going to bring in better and high paying jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd having SpaceX here short term has already been a huge, huge boom to our economy, to our industry.\u201d\nSome local business owners also share this perspective.\nAlmost two years ago, Barton Bickerton opened Hopper Haus Bar & Grill in Port Isabel. The bar sits across the bay from the Boca Chica facility in South Texas. It has become a popular hangout for SpaceX employees and tourists who descend on the area.\nThe bar has a distinct theme, with SpaceX memorabilia decorating the walls, including a chunk of the cement launchpad.\nBickerton said he agrees that SpaceX has been a boon to the local economy and, despite April\u2019s controversial rocket launch, he sees strong support for the private space program.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way \u2014 with the money that they spend on that thing \u2014 there\u2019s no way they\u2019re not going to keep launching from here,\u201d Bickerton said.\nBut Bickerton acknowledges that, for many of his customers who strongly support SpaceX, witnessing the sheer force of the rocket and its aftermath has made some a little \u201cscared about it.\u201d\n\u201cI think it\u2019s fantastic for the area,\u201d he added. \u201cYou have to do it the right way. That\u2019s for sure.\u201d\nSpaceX and environmental concerns\nMary Angela Branch lives in Port Isabel, a coastal community less than 10 miles from the launchpad, and still remembers the first time, in 2016, that she saw a big wooden sign advertising \u201cthe future home of SpaceX.\u201d It was on a previously undisturbed beach in Boca Chica.\nBranch is on the board of an organization called Save RGV (Rio Grande Valley), which started in 2014. The group initially came together to fight against proposed liquified natural gas terminals, but they are now involved in litigation directly related to SpaceX.\nThe impact of April\u2019s Starship launch on the region\u2019s environment was palpable, Branch said.\n\u201cThe air quality was horrible. It was like a nuclear blast had gone off there,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see any birds. No seagulls, no pelicans, nothing. The lack of wildlife really, really got my attention.\u201d\nBeatriz Reynoso, a disabled veteran, environmental activist, and former congressional candidate from nearby Harlingen, Texas, said she suffered health issues after exposure to burn pits in Afghanistan and fears the repeated rocket launches and explosions could impact the health of South Texas residents.\n\u201cI worry about the community, which is a medically underserved area and population, and the consequences of poor and contaminated air quality,\u201d Reynoso said.\nAhead of the launch on April 20, the FAA issued a finding that the event would have no significant impact on its surrounding environment. Therefore, the agency didn\u2019t proceed with a more in-depth environmental assessment, which would have taken more time.\nSave RGV is involved in a lawsuit against the FAA that alleges the agency failed to do enough to mitigate or thoroughly review potential damages to the area. The group is one of a handful of plaintiffs \u2014 including the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation of Texas and the Center for Biological Diversity \u2014 pursuing the case in the hope that the agency will go back and do a far more comprehensive environmental analysis of the impacts of the launch.\nIn a court document, the FAA denied the allegations levied by the activists. The agency declined further comment to CNN, saying it does not comment on ongoing litigation. SpaceX has sought to intervene in the case and did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on the lawsuit.\nJim Chapman has lived in Brownsville since the late 1970s. He joined Save RGV because he was concerned about the environmental impact of SpaceX\u2019s launches on the wildlife refuge areas that surround the launch site.\n\u201cUltimately, we want them (the FAA) to make SpaceX do what they should have done from the beginning,\u201d Chapman said."

      "text": "Sign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\nAs a piece of spaceborne garbage veered toward the International Space Station in November, the seven astronauts on board braced themselves.\nA Russian spacecraft attached to the space station lit its engines for five minutes, slightly tweaking the station\u2019s trajectory and moving the football field-size laboratory out of harm\u2019s way. If the space station had not changed course, the debris could have passed within 2 \u00bd miles (4 kilometers) of its orbital path, according to NASA.\nDebris striking the space station could have spelled disaster. An impact might have depressurized segments of the station and left the astronauts scrambling to return home.\nWhat\u2019s more concerning: The potential strike was not all that rare of an occurrence. The International Space Station has had to make similar maneuvers dozens of times since it was first occupied in November 2000, and collision risks are growing every year as the number of objects in orbit around Earth proliferate.\nFor years, space traffic experts have raised alarm bells about the increasing congestion. Earlier collisions, explosions and weapons tests have resulted in tens of thousands of pieces of debris that experts are tracking and possibly millions more that cannot be seen with current technology.\nAnd while risks to astronauts may be a top concern, congestion in orbit is also hazardous to satellites and space-based technologies that power our everyday lives \u2014 including GPS tools as well as some broadband, high-speed internet and television services.\n\u201cThe number of objects in space that we have launched in the last four years has increased exponentially,\u201d said Dr. Vishnu Reddy, a professor of planetary sciences at the University of Arizona in Tucson. \u201cSo we are heading towards the situation that we are always dreading.\u201d\nThe event Reddy referred to is a hypothetical phenomenon called Kessler Syndrome.\nNamed for American astrophysicist Donald Kessler and based on his 1978 academic paper, Kessler Syndrome \u2014 as the term is used today \u2014 has a muddy definition.\nBut the phrase broadly describes a scenario in which debris in space sets off a chain reaction: One explosion sends out a plume of fragments that in turn smash into other spaceborne objects, creating more detritus. The cascading effect may continue until Earth\u2019s orbit is so clogged with junk that satellites become inoperable and space exploration must come to a grinding halt.\nResearchers disagree about the current level of risk and when, exactly, congestion in space may reach the point of no return.\nBut there is widespread consensus about one thing: Traffic in space is a serious problem in desperate need of addressing, according to CNN interviews with scientists and space traffic experts.\nHow often do objects collide in space?\nSince the dawn of spaceflight in 1957, there have been more than 650 \u201cbreak-ups, explosions, collisions, or anomalous events resulting in fragmentation,\u201d according to the European Space Agency.\nThose incidents have included satellites that have accidentally collided with each other, rocket parts and spacecraft that have unexpectedly exploded, and weapons tests from nations including the United States, Russia, India and China that have spewed detritus across various altitudes in orbit.\nRussia, for example, launched a missile at one of its own satellites as part of a weapons test in 2021, creating more than 1,500 traceable pieces of debris.\nThe last major accidental collision between two spaceborne objects occurred in February 2009 when a dead Russian military satellite, called Kosmos 2251, rammed into Iridium 33, an active communications satellite operated by US-based telecommunications firm Iridium. That event produced a massive cloud of nearly 2,000 pieces of debris that were nearly 4 inches (10 centimeters) in diameter and thousands of even smaller pieces.\nSimilar events on a smaller scale are also common: a US Air Force weather satellite, for example, broke apart in orbit on December 19, creating at least 50 new pieces of debris, LeoLabs, a company that tracks objects in space, said on Monday. It was only the latest in a string of four \u201cfragmentation\u201d events over the past few months that created more than 300 new pieces of litter.\nWhat we can and can\u2019t see\nFor those managing satellites, congestion in space can be a nightmare. It\u2019s common for a satellite operator to receive a dozen or more alerts per day about potential collisions.\nThe process of tracking objects in orbit \u2014 called space situational awareness \u2014 involves tracing possible \u201cconjunctions,\u201d or close approaches between two entities.\nIn one incident this year, for example, a NASA weather satellite narrowly missed colliding with a defunct Russian rocket by less than 65 feet (20 meters), according to LeoLabs.\nBut the risks may be even higher than what space situational awareness can predict.\nFor the most part, an object must be larger than a tennis ball to be tracked. The remaining objects are too small to reflect light or in distant areas of orbit that are difficult to observe directly.\n\u201cEven with today\u2019s best sensors, there are limits to what can be reliably \u2018seen\u2019 or tracked, and smaller space debris is often untrackable,\u201d said Bob Hall, director of special projects at COMSPOC Corp., a space traffic software company.\nBut small objects can still pose significant threats. In orbit, objects whirl around so fast that even a fleck of paint is capable of smashing through metal, according to NASA. That means any piece of junk left in space is deeply concerning \u2014 and potentially catastrophic.\nHigher altitude, higher risk\nExactly how a chain reaction of collisions in space might play out is not clear.\nDifferent regions of Earth\u2019s orbit have their own levels of congestion and risk. Low-Earth orbit, which extends to around 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers ) above the planet\u2019s surface, is by far the most crowded.\nThis area is home to two crewed space stations and massive constellations of satellites that beam internet \u2014 such as SpaceX\u2019s network of nearly 7,000 Starlink satellites \u2014 monitor weather, observe crop production or analyze the climate.\nIf a ripple of explosions happened in low-Earth orbit, it could threaten astronauts\u2019 lives, halt rocket launches and lead to the destruction of all the satellite technology present there.\nThe good news in this scenario, if there is any, is that disastrous conditions may not last for generations to come: \u201cWe still have remnants of atmosphere in the low-Earth orbit, so we have a natural cleaning mechanism,\u201d said Carolin Frueh, an associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Purdue University in Indiana.\nAt an altitude of around 300 miles (500 kilometers), objects in orbit will naturally fall back to Earth or disintegrate in the atmosphere within about 25 years, Frueh said, indicating that a debris field at this distance likely would not threaten access to space for generations to come.\nBut the picture changes rapidly at higher orbits. At nearly 500 miles (800 kilometers), it would take at least a century for a piece of debris to be naturally dragged out of space. At more than 621 miles (1,000 kilometers), the process would take thousands of years.\nThat\u2019s bad news for geosynchronous orbit \u2014 a region about 22,236 miles (35,786 kilometers) from Earth\u2019s surface \u2014 which is home to quarter-billion-dollar communications satellites that beam TV and other services to broad swaths of the globe.\n\u201cThe most dangerous place where this (Kessler Syndrome-like event) could happen is in GEO,\u201d said Reddy, the University of Arizona researcher. \u201cBecause we have no way of cleaning it up in a quick way.\u201d\nHow cascading collisions might play out\nThe 2013 movie \u201cGravity\u201d brought the idea of Kessler Syndrome to the big screen: A Russian missile strike on a dead satellite initiates a cascade of collisions, generating a cloud of junk that devastates other satellites and spacecraft.\nBut while the drama in \u201cGravity\u201d unfolded over an hour and a half, a real-life Kessler Syndrome scenario would likely take years \u2014 or decades \u2014 to play out, experts said.\nAnd since the film\u2019s release more than a decade ago, congestion in orbit has rapidly increased: The US military was tracking about 23,000 objects then compared with 47,000 objects today.\nThough there are ongoing efforts to calculate where, when and how a ripple effect might kick off, it\u2019s an impossible task, Purdue\u2019s Frueh said.\n\u201cAs soon as we\u2019re predicting into the future, we have to make assumptions,\u201d Frueh said. \u201cEvery model is wrong \u2014 (but) some are useful.\u201d\nModels are inaccurate because even experts do not have a pristine picture of where objects are in orbit. Objects smaller than about 4 inches (10 centimeters) are largely invisible. What\u2019s more, space weather can change orbital trajectories \u2014 so it\u2019s difficult to predict exactly how and where debris is traveling, according to Dr. Thomas Berger, director of the University of Colorado\u2019s Space Weather Technology, Research, and Education Center. Berger spoke on the topic on December 11 at the American Geophysical Union\u2019s annual meeting in Washington, DC.\nThe size and shape of spaceborne garbage pieces are also a mystery. So, to model a single Kessler Syndrome effect, analysts would have to guess exactly how a satellite would break apart, how each piece of that debris would look, where it would travel and what other object it might hit next.\n\u201cWhat keeps me up,\u201d said Dan Oltrogge, chief scientist and director of COMSPOC Corp.\u2019s Center for Space Standards and Innovation, \u201cis that the data is not accurate enough to allow you to actually avoid the thing you think you\u2019re avoiding.\u201d\nHas Kessler Syndrome already started?\nGiven that \u201cKessler Syndrome\u201d is not an instantaneous event, scientists are debating whether the phenomenon could already be in motion. Kessler\u2019s thought experiment asks researchers to consider whether \u2014 even if all rocket launches ceased \u2014 collisions in space would still escalate the number of objects in orbit. And it\u2019s not clear if that point has been reached.\nThe researchers interviewed for this story offered differing perspectives on whether events indicative of Kessler Syndrome had already kicked off.\nBut Frueh said that\u2019s why she no longer believes Kessler Syndrome is a useful term.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s confusing for the public that different entities do not agree,\u201d she said. \u201cThe concept itself is just not as clean and crisp as you would think.\u201d\nWhat experts do seem to agree on is that the situation in orbit is problematic. None said that they believed disaster could certainly be avoided. More likely, they said, the garbage in orbit will continue to proliferate.\nFrueh said, \u201cI\u2019m pessimistic \u2026 that we will act timely enough to not have economic damage in the process.\u201d\nDr. Nilton Renno, a professor of climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan, said that he is optimistic by nature. But the situation in Earth orbit reminds him of the ecological woes underway here on our home planet.\n\u201cThe analogy that I like to think about space debris is plastic in the oceans,\u201d he said. \u201cWe used to think that the oceans are infinite, and we throw in trash and plastic, and now we realize \u2014 no, those are finite resources. And we are causing huge damage if we are not careful about what we do.\u201d\nPreventing Kessler Syndrome\nThere are two big considerations when talking about preventing the proliferation of debris in Earth\u2019s orbit.\nOne is cleanup technology: Companies and government initiatives are seeking to develop ways to drag debris out of orbit, such as the Drag Augmentation Deorbiting Subsystem, or ADEO, developed by the European Space Agency and tech company High Performance Space Structure Systems, or HPS GmbH. The prototype braking sail was successfully deployed from the ION satellite in December 2022, according to ESA.\nThe sail technology \u201cprovides a passive method of deorbiting by increasing the atmospheric surface drag effect,\u201d an ESA release said, with the aim of causing a defunct satellite to descend more quickly and burn up in Earth\u2019s atmosphere debris-free.\nThese methods, however, are experimental and exceedingly expensive, Renno noted. And it\u2019s not clear who would be willing to pay for them.\nThe second consideration is regulation. Space policy experts have for years traced efforts to adopt new international guidelines or national laws aimed at preventing space companies or bad actors from acting irresponsibly.\nThere are some efforts in the works. In September, the United Nations adopted the Pact for the Future.\nThe document, adopted by member states, includes an intention for nations to \u201cdiscuss the establishment of new frameworks for space traffic, space debris and space resources through the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.\u201d\nThe language appears nebulous, and space policy experts point out that the United Nations has no means of enforcement.\nPerhaps more practical, Renno said, is for individual nations to adopt laws for space stakeholders. And he believes the United States should take a leadership role in that process.\nThe University of Arizona\u2019s Reddy agreed.\n\u201cI think the biggest concern is the lack of regulation,\u201d he said. \u201cI think having some norms and guidelines that (are) put forward by the industry will help a lot.\u201d"

      "text": "The debris arrives in the rockets\u2019 wake: melted plastics, aluminum and pieces of blue adhesive. It all ends up stranded on the sands of Bagdad beach in northern Tamaulipas, Mexico, home to an endangered species of sea turtle. Just across the border lies Starbase, SpaceX\u2019s launchpad and company town.\nSince November, Conibio Global, a small non-governmental organization, has taken on a daunting task: cleaning up trash from SpaceX, one of the most powerful companies in the world.\nJes\u00fas El\u00edas Ibarra, founder of Conibio Global, told CNN that in November 2024, he witnessed one of SpaceX\u2019s launches and saw one of the rocket boosters fall into the Gulf of Mexico. That time, Ibarra says people arrived in at least three helicopters and more than 10 boats just a few hours later to clean up. CNN reached out to SpaceX to ask if they were responsible for this cleanup.\nIn May, however, there was another launch, with more debris. This time, the activist claims, millions of particles ended up contaminating the area on the Mexican side. Ibarra said that a few days later, the organization collected more than a ton of waste in an area of 500 meters.\n\u201cIn half a kilometer out of the 40 kilometers of shoreline, we already collected one ton (of trash),\u201d added Ibarra. \u201cWe are a very small group, it\u2019s impossible to clean everything.\u201d\nIbarra said that Conibio Global handed the debris to the Mexican government\u2019s environmental protection agency PROFEPA.\nIn response to inquiries from CNN, SpaceX referred to what they published on social media site X on June 26, where they claim to have offered resources and support for cleanup efforts. The company claimed that they have also requested local and federal assistance from the Mexican government for debris recovery. Under the Outer Space Treaty, SpaceX is entitled to have its debris returned.\nThe statement added that the company had performed tests that they claim confirm that there are no chemical, biological or toxicological risks associated with the flotsam and jetsam of a typical SpaceX launch.\nCNN contacted the authorities of Tamaulipas and the Presidency of Mexico about SpaceX\u2019s offer and is awaiting a response.\nIbarra said that Conibio Global has not had any contact with the company.\nMarlon Sorge, executive director of The Aerospace Corporation\u2019s Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies (CORDS), told CNN in an email that it\u2019s best not to touch space debris if found.\n\u201cAlthough a lot of debris is not hazardous, spaceflight-related vehicles can contain hazardous chemicals and materials,\u201d Sorge wrote. \u201cBe aware that it is not worth the risk to touch a piece of debris, and it could interfere with important investigations.\u201d\nSome of the objects found during cleanup operations, Ibarra said, are solid and spongy plastics, a type of rubber with a consistency similar to cork, aluminum with SpaceX labels, pieces of plastic bubble wrap, steel tubes, and pieces of a blue-colored adhesive.\nSome of this trash, Ibarra predicted, could end up being ingested by Kemp\u2019s ridley turtles, an endangered species of sea turtle that inhabits the area.\nOn its website, SpaceX says it is committed to minimizing the impact and improving the environment whenever possible, highlighting agreements with various US agencies and the Texas government.\nA months-long saga\nAfter the recent explosion of a SpaceX rocket on June 19, the NGO reported that some large fragments appeared in Mexican territory the next morning. It stated that several officials from the Mexican government got in touch so that they could be informed of the situation.\nConibio follows SpaceX\u2019s social media announcements to know when there will be launches and goes to the sites to collect evidence of debris they know will fall. He says this happens in the northern area of Bagdad Beach and on a parcel of communal farming land in nearby Matamoros.\nFollowing persistent public complaints, Mexico\u2019s President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke out at her daily conference on June 25.\nSheinbaum said that her government had found that there is indeed pollution and that the impact of rocket launches in general will be reviewed in order to take action \u201cwithin the framework of international laws,\u201d including possible legal actions.\nIbarra, who is also a veterinarian and director of the Marine Turtle Program at Conibio Global, said that he believes the vibrations generated by the rockets compact the sand where there are turtle nests and prevent them from emerging. He said that at least 300 hatchlings have died in the compacted nests.\n\u201cThere is vegetation that the last explosion burned, the entire edge of the Rio Bravo, and the pipes broke many trees, which fell near a small population of people,\u201d said Ibarra. He added that in several border cities between Tamaulipas and Texas it was reported that there was minor damage to houses due to the vibrations from the rockets.\nA team of environmental officials and personnel from the Mexican Navy Secretariat went to collect the waste Conibio collected last weekend, and during the visit, Ibarra recounted, they found a tank approximately 4 meters long and a stainless steel pipe weighing about 5 kg.\nDealing with cleaning up the waste has cost the NGO more than US$26,000 in operating expenses and beach monitoring due to vehicle fuel they use and laborers\u2019 wages, as well as cleaning materials, the organization claims.\nIbarra noted that the Mexican government has collaborated with them since they became aware of the situation, especially since it involves a foreign company. He claimed that during one of the visits they were \u201charassed\u201d by SpaceX drones that were recording them.\nSpaceX did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment on Ibarra\u2019s allegation.\nCNN has also contacted the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (Semarnat) and the Government of Tamaulipas for comments on Ibarra\u2019s statements.\nIn SpaceX\u2019s statement on social media, the company said that the debris is its property and that its recovery attempts have been hindered by individuals who had \u201ctrespassed\u201d on private property without authorization.\nCNN has asked SpaceX and the Government of Tamaulipas about what private property the company is referring to.\nThe Government of Tamaulipas has always expressed that it wants a collaborative relationship with SpaceX. Governor Am\u00e9rico Villarreal visited Starbase in November 2024.\nWhile the bigger rocket pieces have been removed, Ibarra says the trash remains a major problem at Bagdad Beach.\n\u201cThe debris is still there,\u201d Ibarra said. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer as visible as in the photos because the tides have been burying it, but it\u2019s there, and it has to be removed sooner or later.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Deblina Chakraborty and Jackie Wattles contributed reporting.\nThis article has been updated to correct the full title of The Aerospace Corporation\u2019s Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies."

      "text": "It was a typical balmy afternoon across the tropical islands that lie southeast of Florida, where tens of thousands of tourists flock this time of year for winter break. But on January 16, just after sundown, a spacecraft erupted into a ball of flames over the North Atlantic Ocean near Turks and Caicos Islands.\nThe upper stage of a SpaceX Starship launch system, the most powerful rocket ever built, had broken apart minutes after liftoff from South Texas during its seventh test flight, fracturing into a cloud of debris that streaked through the evening sky. Blazing orange and white, the astonishing spectacle left onlookers gazing in awe from beaches and cruise ships \u2014 with many posting the bizarre scene to social media.\nWere they meteorites? Satellites? The harbingers of the end of the world?\n\u201cI just never have seen colors like that in the sky,\u201d said Lori Kaine, a resident of Providenciales, the main island of the Turks and Caicos archipelago. \u201cAt first, I thought it was an actual plane that had exploded.\u201d\nThe noise was deafening, she recalled. Even inside with her doors and windows closed, Kaine said she could still hear the jarring boom. One of her dogs panicked while another could be heard crying outside, she said.\nIt wasn\u2019t until Kaine checked the flood of messages on her phone that she first came across reports about the failed Starship spacecraft.\nThe next morning, in the light of day, Kaine said she began to take stock of the fallout.\nA mysterious cable had landed in her driveway. Broken hexagon tiles \u2014 likely part of Starship\u2019s heat shield \u2014 littered the roadway where Kaine typically walks her dogs, she said. The nearby beach was similarly strewn with debris.\n\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018OK, this is crazy\u2019 \u2014 because (the Starship pieces are) on the inner roads of the island and over on the beach,\u201d Kaine said.\nTurks and Caicos, a British territory located 525 miles (925 kilometers) southeast of Miami that includes 40 islands, eight of which are inhabited, appears to be the area that was hardest hit by the falling Starship debris. No injuries resulting from the explosion have been reported, but multiple residents say the rocket parts did land near homes and have washed up along beaches near tourist hot spots. There has been one reported incident of property damage.\nSpaceX\u2019s response to the incident has drawn criticism from Turks and Caicos residents. And the ordeal raises broader questions about the company\u2019s approach to developing Starship \u2014 the gargantuan rocket system SpaceX hopes will one day carry humans to the moon and Mars \u2014 and its decision to launch the vehicle\u2019s test flights out of South Texas, on a path that takes the spacecraft over populated areas.\nAn ongoing investigation\nAfter the Starship broke apart, the Federal Aviation Administration activated a \u201cDebris Response Area,\u201d which meant the agency briefly locked down airspace near Turks and Caicos. The US agency licenses commercial rocket launches and is overseeing an investigation into the incident.\nThe DRA alert and resulting flight diversions led to a cascade of travel delays.\nDebris has now been found all over the islands, according to a database put together by local environmental group Turks and Caicos Reef Fund in partnership with the government\u2019s Department of Environment and Coastal Resources.\nWreckage has washed up on every beach on Providenciales, as well as \u201cfrom South Caicos to West Caicos which essentially spans the entirety of the Caicos Banks,\u201d said Alizee Zimmermann, the executive director of the Turks and Caicos Reef Fund, a US-registered nonprofit.\nThe reports also include at least one instance of property damage: Debris reportedly struck a car in South Caicos, Zimmermann said.\nThe FAA confirmed to CNN on Friday that it verified a report of \u201cminor damage to a vehicle located in South Caicos.\u201d There we no injuries or other reported instances of damage, the agency previously said.\n\u2018Is this safe?\u2019\nStarship is still a work in progress, prone to explosive mishaps.\nSpaceX \u2014 unlike NASA and some of the company\u2019s competitors in the aerospace industry \u2014 embraces a strategy called \u201crapid iterative development.\u201d The approach emphasizes building prototypes and accepting added risk during test flights, which launch from the company\u2019s Starbase facilities located on Texas\u2019 southernmost tip.\nPrevious Starship flights have resulted in explosions over the Gulf of Mexico and other areas of the ocean. The vehicle\u2019s first test mission notably blew up a launchpad in South Texas, causing a blizzard of debris and sparking backlash from environmentalists. However, the January 16 test flight stands out because of the Starship\u2019s proximity to populated islands at the time it malfunctioned.\nSpaceX maintains that its \u201crapid iterative development\u201d approach allows engineers to learn and adjust Starship\u2019s design more cheaply and quickly than if it were to rely on more traditional approaches and extensive ground testing.\nBut the strategy also frequently puts SpaceX in the hot seat when test flights do not go according to plan.\n\u201cJust being witnesses to this explosion and actually receiving debris, it makes you question a lot of things too,\u201d Florida resident Elena Zavet, who was visiting Turks and Caicos during the explosion, told CNN affiliate WSVN. \u201cLike is this safe?\u201d\nIn its statement to CNN, the FAA said that the Turks and Caicos government was made aware prior to the Starship launch that the nation was located within a possible hazard area.\nThe agency also said that, before the test flight launched, it required SpaceX to map out \u201chazard areas sufficient to ensure that the probability of casualty to a member of the public on land or on board a maritime vessel does not exceed one in one million.\u201d\n\u201cNo Caribbean islands, including Turks and Caicos, exceeded this threshold,\u201d the agency said.\n\u2018Unsettling\u2019 finds\nIn general, Turks and Caicos residents have expressed disappointment in the response from SpaceX.\n\u201cI\u2019m into the launches and what (SpaceX CEO Elon) Musk is doing \u2014 but I think he should be liable for the cleanup, too,\u201d said Amos Luker, the owner of a car rental business on Providenciales called Scooter Bob\u2019s.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not been big warnings going out whatsoever,\u201d he added, referring to limited communication about the potentially hazardous nature of the debris.\nSpaceX did not share any information about the location of the explosion or how to handle debris on X, where the company\u2019s account has nearly 40 million followers.\nThe company did say in a statement on its website that people should contact SpaceX if debris is found and refrain from touching the objects. That post also noted that SpaceX believed \u201csurviving pieces of debris would have fallen into the designated hazard area.\u201d (Initially, the statement described debris as falling \u201cinto the Atlantic Ocean\u201d \u2014 but the language was amended the day after the accident to remove that phrase.)\nIn the same statement, SpaceX sought to frame the Starship flight as a milestone, saying, \u201csuccess comes from what we learn, and this flight test will help us improve Starship\u2019s reliability as SpaceX seeks to make life multiplanetary.\u201d\nCynthia Filo, the manager and captain of Silly Creek Water Sports in Providenciales, told CNN she has also found wreckage \u2014 a fact that she finds \u201cunsettling for the areas that I found it in, because it\u2019s way up in the pond area.\n\u201cSo it\u2019s already come in from the ocean and gone miles inland,\u201d Filo said. On Wednesday, she told CNN she discovered a fragment next to her house, which she said she believes may have fallen off the roof days after the incident.\nZimmermann of the Turks and Caicos Reef Fund said she is aware that \u201ca multiagency response is being planned with the key focus on cleanup.\u201d And a recent dispatch from authorities showed that local officials met with several members of the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, an arm of the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for Transport, last week.\nBut residents are still waiting for something to be done. \u201cWe\u2019re just trying to put forward a plea to at least help assist us in financing the cleanup that\u2019s being done through volunteers,\u201d Zimmermann added.\nGrowing frustration\nKaine, who lives on Providenciales, said she began to collect detritus from Starship the day after the January 16 explosion.\nThe objects she gathered left her hands covered in soot and grime. She estimated there are now \u201ceasily 200 pounds (91 kilograms)\u201d of debris in her collection, stashed away in garbage bags labeled with the location where she picked up the debris. Plenty more still litters the beaches, she said.\nBut it was not until the day after the explosion, on January 17, that Kaine became aware that interacting with the debris could be dangerous.\nThe Turks and Caicos National Security Secretariat posted a notice to Facebook, saying the government is \u201cnot aware of any specific risks\u201d \u2014 but \u201cspace objects can sometimes contain hazardous materials which can cause serious harm to health.\u201d\nThe notice recommended residents not touch the debris and to contact the Turks and Caicos Islands (TCI) government or SpaceX.\nKaine said she grew frustrated.\nFor one, it was over 24 hours before she learned that exposure to the materials could be dangerous.\nShe also worried that the debris, left alone, would soon be covered by sand \u2014 literally burying the fallout from SpaceX\u2019s explosive mishap and perhaps further threatening the ecology of the island.\nSpaceX also took a week to respond to a voicemail she left with the company\u2019s hotline, Kaine told CNN. And even then, she was told representatives from the company would not arrive for another few days.\n\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a problem finding debris when they get here,\u201d Kaine said of SpaceX. \u201cIf they want me to find it, I can find it.\u201d\nAccording to a January 23 Facebook update from the local government, SpaceX representatives were scheduled to be on the island that day. Neither the company nor the government responded to requests for comment.\nKaine said she still has the debris stored at her home.\nPotential hazard to health\nHours after sending out its first communication on January 17, the day after the explosion, the TCI National Security Secretariat issued another dispatch, saying \u201cinitial discussions between the UK Space Agency and SpaceX\u201d have \u201cconfirmed that no Hydrazine was on board the Starship rocket.\u201d\nHydrazine is a type of propellant used on some spacecraft that can cause nausea, vomiting, inflammation of the nerves and even a coma following exposure.\nSpaceX\u2019s Starship does not use such fuels. The megarocket instead relies on liquid methane and oxygen for propellant \u2014 but \u201cany kind of fuel is going to \u2026 have a bunch of chemical energy inside it,\u201d according to Marlon Sorge, the executive director of the Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies at The Aerospace Corporation, a federally funded research center.\n\u201cEven if it isn\u2019t as dangerous as hydrazine, where you touch it or get close to it and you\u2019re in trouble \u2014 it\u2019s still volatile, like gasoline,\u201d Sorge added. \u201cAnd there are other things on board spacecraft, like batteries.\u201d\nHe added that it is possible for entire rocket fuel tanks to survive the trip down to the ground: \u201cIf they\u2019re weakened, you touch them, they blow up.\u201d\nThat\u2019s likely why local authorities advised residents not to touch any debris \u201cout of an abundance of caution,\u201d as the Turks and Caicos government wrote in a January 17 notice.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s a death sentence to get close to one of these things,\u201d Sorge said. \u201cMostly they\u2019re probably OK, but it is potentially risky. And it\u2019s not worth people getting injured.\u201d\nBut many people who came across the detritus have started to collect the objects \u2014 some individuals took them home as souvenirs, while others are aiming to sell them for profit.\nOne eBay listing for a heat shield tile allegedly recovered from Turks and Caicos has a bid for $3,000. A look at previously sold remnants of destroyed Starship spacecraft show the items have fetched up to $2,000.\nBut selling or keeping a piece of a SpaceX craft could be legally questionable, Sorge noted. According to the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, \u201ctechnically, (the debris) still belongs to the launching organization.\u201d\nEnvironmental impact\nZimmermann said on Monday that, although cleanup efforts may be underway soon, she is not aware of concrete plans to evaluate the Starship explosion\u2019s environmental footprint.\nShe added that she hopes there will be a formal assessment that would include testing the waters for signs of contamination and conducting exploratory surveys that might use drones to hunt for large pieces of debris at sea, which could be impacting sensitive ecosystems.\n\u201cBut all that requires a lot of coordination and a fair amount of funding \u2014 and both of those are limited here,\u201d Zimmermann said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not been the best response,\u201d she added. \u201cI think there\u2019s not a lot of precedent for this type of event either in such a populated area. But there\u2019s debris as small as a third of a fingernail and as large as a car scattered around.\u201d\nKaine said she\u2019s grown wary of SpaceX\u2019s response to the ordeal and the Starship program in general. She said she\u2019s not interested in keeping any of the debris she collected. Her goal is to keep the roadways and beaches she frequents clean and free of dangerous materials.\n\u201cYou need to come pick this up,\u201d Kaine said of SpaceX. \u201cAnd my concern has grown on a larger level about these launches, because now that I\u2019m reading about it \u2014 there\u2019s such limited information out there.\u201d"

      "text": "In May, millions of Americans watched as Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley, two veteran NASA astronauts, strapped into a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule and took a 17,000 mile per hour ride to the International Space Station. It was the first time NASA astronauts launched from US soil since 2011 \u2014 and the first time in history that a privately owned vehicle carried humans into Earth\u2019s orbit.\nThe astronauts returned safely home last weekend, and once again, NASA and SpaceX employees cheered together, celebrating their coordinated accomplishment.\nThat moment of solidarity, however, came after years of infighting, politicking and mutual distrust, according to current and former employees from NASA and SpaceX.\nElon Musk, who made millions as a co-founder of PayPal, founded SpaceX in 2002 with the stated goal of sending humans to live on Mars: \u201cI think we\u2019re beginning to see is the dawn of a new era of space exploration \u2014 one that is driven by commercial companies as much, if not more, than by government,\u201d Musk told CNN in a 2004 interview.\nWhen the startup began working with NASA later that decade, it had only a few dozen engineers and was known primarily for Musk\u2019s bold claims and for blowing up its first rocket prototypes.\nThe space agency, wise from past tragedies that cost astronauts\u2019 lives, saw SpaceX as brash and reckless.\nThe prevailing perception was \u201cthey\u2019re cowboys; they\u2019re dangerous; they\u2019re going to kill somebody,\u201d said former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman, a veteran of two Space Shuttle missions who joined SpaceX in 2011 as a senior engineer, working on Crew Dragon development.\nEven after SpaceX began to prove its engineering chops and was awarded multibillion-dollar NASA contracts, cultural divisions kept tensions brewing behind the scenes.\nNASA repeatedly signaled that it was more confident in its legacy partner, Boeing (BA), which was developing the Starliner, a spacecraft to rival SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon.\nAs recently as 2016, NASA was planning its schedule around the idea that the Starliner would beat the Crew Dragon to the launch pad. And, as recently as last September, NASA chief Jim Bridenstine and Elon Musk were publicly sparring over whether SpaceX was paying adequate attention to the spacecraft\u2019s development.\nBut by the new year, Boeing and SpaceX\u2019s race to the launch pad took a clear turn. A Starliner test flight in December was riddled with missteps and left NASA and Boeing officials scrambling to figure out what went wrong. Shortly afterward, SpaceX\u2019s Crew Dragon soared through its final testing milestones, and, in the midst of a pandemic, swiftly prepared for its crowning launch achievement.\nNASA officials admitted earlier this month that they had turned a more scrutinizing eye toward SpaceX and its unorthodox ways, while issues with Boeing\u2019s Starliner slipped through the cracks.\n\u201cTo see NASA step up and say, \u2018We should have trusted SpaceX more\u2019 \u2014 If you would have played that clip about eight years ago, I would have been flabbergasted,\u201d Reisman said. \u201cIt would have been pure science fiction.\u201d\n\u2018Wacky people doing wacky things\u2019\nBack in 2005, NASA knew its Space Shuttle program was nearing its end and the space agency would be shifting its focus to a new human spaceflight program, aimed at fulfilling then-President George W. Bush\u2019s directive to return humans to the Moon in 2020.\nThe space agency, however, also needed to keep the International Space Station, a $100 billion orbiting laboratory, stocked with supplies. And a small faction of NASA employees had a radical idea: Instead of doing the bulk of the work, perhaps NASA could ask private-sector companies to develop new spacecraft and compete for NASA contracts. If the spacecraft proved capable of delivering cargo to the Space Station, then perhaps they could also ask companies to build crew-worthy capsules.\n\u201cI think in general it was viewed by [others at] NASA as just a bunch of wacky people doing wacky things,\u201d Marc Timm, a senior manager at NASA who was involved with the commercial program (later named COTS), recalled to a NASA historian. \u201cWe were kind of left alone, which I think was another benefit that allowed us to be successful.\u201d\nWhen SpaceX was selected as a COTS program competitor in 2006, it was a four-year-old company with fewer than 100 employees, mostly young engineers, that were trying to launch cheap rockets off the tiny island of Omelek, about 2,300 miles west of Hawaii. They had already blown up one. A common perception at the time was that space technology was probably too complex and expensive for the private sector, and SpaceX\u2019s eccentric CEO, Elon Musk, could join a long list of rich guys who blew their fortune on the impossible.\n\u201cWe were on our own from our infancy, so we were used to being a bit internally self-centered,\u201d Tim Buzza, a former SpaceX vice president and one of its first employees, later said, according to NASA\u2019s Oral History Project. \u201cI think learning to accept some of that outside help was something that we had to learn.\u201d\nBuilding bridges\nThroughout its history, NASA has worked with aerospace contractors to help design, develop, build and test new spacecraft. Boeing and the companies it\u2019s merged with, for example, have worked alongside the space agency on every spaceflight program since Project Mercury began in the 1950s\nBut the COTS program marked an entirely new blueprint. NASA lent expertise and oversight, but companies were awarded fixed-price contracts. If costs ran high, the contractors would have to find more money elsewhere or work around the problem.\nSpaceX ended up spending about $545 million of its own money \u2014 on top of NASA\u2019s $475 million COTS award \u2014 to build the first Dragon spacecraft, a vehicle designed only to carry cargo. To cut costs, SpaceX wanted to skip some ground tests. Instead of sticking a spacecraft in a bunch of test chambers, as is standard, the company wanted to accept a bit of added risk and put a Dragon cargo capsule on the launch pad.\n\u201cThe first flight could serve as these big system tests,\u201d SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell told NASA\u2019s Oral History Project in 2013. \u201cThe biggest challenge, I think, that we had in the execution of this was convincing NASA, every step of the way, that though we\u2019re going to do business very differently, we\u2019re going to get it right.\u201d\nShotwell said SpaceX engineers also used C++, a modern computer programming language adored in Silicon Valley, while NASA was used to working with its own aerospace-specific languages, such as HAL/S. The two sides became accustomed to long, \u201cpainful\u201d meetings to reach understandings, Shotwell said.\nNASA preferred slow, methodical approaches and detailed documentation to organize the process. SpaceX\u2019s strategy was to move fast and continuously make changes.\nBut not everyone at NASA was put off.\n\u201cThey were making things in a month that would have taken NASA like a year,\u201d Reisman, the former NASA astronaut, told CNN. He watched the company\u2019s progress while preparing for his second Space Shuttle mission. \u201cWe were just amazed.\u201d\nAfter Reisman returned from his mission, STS-132, he left NASA to join the startup.\nA year later, in 2012, the first SpaceX Dragon cargo vehicle safely latched onto the International Space Station after launching atop its new Falcon 9 rocket.\nSpaceX became impossible to ignore. And the success of the Dragon spacecraft, which still flies routine cargo missions to the ISS, enabled a pro-commercialization movement inside NASA to push forward with a plan to allow SpaceX and other private companies to take over astronaut transportation, too.\nFailure and politics\nAfter President Barack Obama came into office, his administration asked Congress to back a new program, dubbed Commercial Crew, which would be modeled on the COTS program but would be focused on developing human-rated spacecraft. The Obama Administration also proposed scrapping the Bush-era Moon landing program in 2010.\nThat idea, however, did not sit well with the space industry establishment or some of NASA\u2019s bankrollers on Capitol Hill.\nRepublican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, whose state is home to a major NASA facility, called the administration\u2019s proposal a \u201cdeath march\u201d for NASA\u2019s human spaceflight ambitions and an attempt to \u201ccoddle the dreams of rocket hobbyists.\u201d\nRepublicans also wanted to revive the Bush Administration\u2019s Moon landing program and the massive rocket and spacecraft NASA planned to develop for the mission, so eventually a compromise was reached: The Moon program was revived, and Congress agreed to fund the Commercial Crew Program.\nBut SpaceX\u2019s critics continued to fixate on its failures. The company wanted to figure out how to recover rocket boosters after launch, hoping it would save some cash, but the boosters kept crashing off-target into the ocean. In June 2015, just months after SpaceX received its final Commercial Crew contract, one of its rockets and Dragon spacecraft erupted on its way to the ISS, destroying 4,000 pounds worth of science experiments and supplies. And in late 2016, another SpaceX rocket exploded on the launch pad, destroying a multimillion-dollar satellite.\nHowever, SpaceX also amassed impressive successes. It eventually mastered the art of landing rocket boosters and began regularly navigating them to pinpoint landings on ground pads and seafaring platforms. It launched dozens of flawless missions on rockets that cost roughly a third of those built by legacy US aerospace companies. And, in 2018, it successfully launched the largest operational rocket in the world, known as Falcon Heavy.\nMany NASA engineers grew to respect the company and its unorthodox process.\n\u201cI like to credit a bunch of people along the way that really kind of stuck their neck out,\u201d Reisman, the NASA-astronaut-turned-SpaceX-engineer, told CNN Business. (Reisman is currently a professor at the University of Southern California and works as a SpaceX consultant.)\n\u2018It\u2019s time to deliver\u2019\nBut SpaceX never stopped giving talking points to its critics. Musk, the company\u2019s head engineer and public figurehead, attracted a near-constant string of controversies: Smoking marijuana during a podcast interview, running afoul of federal regulators for posting misleading tweets about his electric car company, Tesla (TSLA), and lashing out at his critics on Twitter. And that was just 2018.\nNASA administrator Jim Bridenstine publicly aired his frustration with Musk in September, when Crew Dragon was months behind schedule after one of the capsules exploded during a test fire, and Musk was hosting a much-hyped press event about SpaceX\u2019s Mars rocket concept in Texas. Bridenstine tweeted at SpaceX that he expects to \u201csee the same level of enthusiasm focused\u201d on its plans to carry NASA astronauts to the ISS, adding \u201cit\u2019s time to deliver.\u201d\nMusk responded in an interview with CNN in which he took a jab at NASA\u2019s long-delayed and over budget Moon rocket. The back-and-forth ended with a joint press conference to publicly bury the hatchet.\nBut behind the scenes, NASA and SpaceX engineers were already finishing Crew Dragon\u2019s design fixes and preparing to give the spacecraft its final \u201cgo for launch.\u201d\nThat approval rested in large part on Kathy Lueders, NASA\u2019s Commercial Crew program head.\nIn May, days before SpaceX launched its historic crewed mission, she reflected on the evolution of Boeing, the trusted NASA partner that was then undergoing lengthy reviews of its botched test flight, and SpaceX, the underdog that some thought would never get the job done.\n\u201cI tell people that there\u2019ll be Harvard Business studies [about these companies],\u201d Lueders, who has business administration and engineering degrees, told CNN. \u201cI think the program was really a catalyst for maturity for both companies.\u201d\nBoeing had to learn to work within an aerospace program that didn\u2019t send more money when accounts ran dry. And SpaceX had to grow out of its \u201cSkunkworks\u201d phase, Lueders said, a reference to Lockheed Martin\u2019s internal experimental prototype division.\nFrom SpaceX\u2019s point of view, \u201cthe worst thing to be would be to be a major aerospace company,\u201d Lueders said. \u201cThey want to be on the leading edge and, sometimes, that\u2019s tough when you\u2019re dealing with government customers.\u201d"

      "text": "A massive chunk of a Blue Origin rocket\u2019s nose cone washed up on the shore of a Bahamian island near a tourist destination. In Europe, flaming debris from a SpaceX launch vehicle streaked across the German sky, and what appears to be a fuel tank may have landed on a company\u2019s property in Poland.\nAnd that\u2019s just this week.\nThe incidents are unrelated to the SpaceX Starship rocket that exploded midair during a test flight in January, raining debris near Turks and Caicos, where residents said they are still working to clean up the detritus from beaches, roadways and bays.\nThat situation raised questions about safety standards for test flights of unproven launch vehicles that travel over population centers.\nBut this week\u2019s two space debris-related events in the Bahamas and Europe point to how successful rocket launches can also leave their mark on Earth.\nThey also highlight how the rise in the number of rockets taking off any given week has increased the likelihood that space junk will find its way back to populated areas.\nFrom sky and shore\nAccording to the European Space Agency, junk falls to our planet from space all the time \u2014 though most of it is blown to smithereens while plunging back into Earth\u2019s thick atmosphere at thousands of miles per hour.\n\u201cSatellites and rocket parts of moderate size re-enter almost daily, while small-size tracked space debris objects re-enter even more frequently,\u201d the agency said.\nThe SpaceX rocket part that streaked through the European skies this week was a rare occurrence, however. The debris came from the second stage of a Falcon 9 rocket that had carried out a routine mission.\nThe rocket took off from California on February 1, hauling a batch of satellites for SpaceX\u2019s Starlink network, which beams internet connectivity from space. But while the primary mission to deliver satellites to space went well, the rocket\u2019s upper stage \u2014 or the portion that lights up after reaching space to finish off a mission \u2014 did not complete a controlled splashdown in the middle of the ocean as is typical, according to Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.\nBased on preliminary information, the Falcon 9 rocket part was dragged out of orbit in an uncontrolled manner, which is likely why the vehicle appeared to reenter Earth\u2019s atmosphere over Europe and crash-land this week.\nPhotos and video posted to social media show the rocket upper stage, which disintegrated into pieces as it plunged back from space, rushing through the sky.\nHeaded into work early Wednesday, a German train driver captured the event in a video after spotting \u201ca very strange constellation of flying lights in the sky.\u201d\n\u201cI was wondering at first, what kind of flying objects that could be,\u201d the train driver, identified as Ludi, said in an email to CNN. \u201cI was thinking of falling stars, comets, meteors or even missiles.\u201d\nThe European Space Agency confirmed and shared Ludi\u2019s footage.\nThe Polish Space Agency also addressed the ordeal in a statement, noting that the rocket part\u2019s trajectory would have carried it toward Poland.\nImages of what appears to be an intact fuel tank that may have landed near Pozna\u0144, Poland, also began circulating on social media and in local news reports.\nPolish hardware and supply business Elektro-Hurt shared photos of the discarded rocket part \u2014 lying against a chain-link fence on its property \u2014 calling it an \u201cextraordinary delivery.\u201d\nIt is not yet clear why the Falcon 9\u2019s upper stage did not complete a regular, controlled descent into the ocean.\nSpaceX did not respond to a request for comment, though CNN confirmed from the Federal Aviation Administration that officials from the company are working to verify whether the debris originated from the Falcon 9.\nThe FAA, which licenses commercial rocket launches, told CNN that the agency did not begin an investigation into a possible mishap with the Falcon 9 in the immediate aftermath of the February 1 launch.\nBut SpaceX has 90 days to report an anomaly, or rocket malfunction, according to the FAA.\nPotential space debris dangers\nIn an interview last month, Marlon Sorge \u2014 executive director of the Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies at The Aerospace Corporation, a federally funded research center \u2014 said that space debris can be hazardous.\nSpace debris can pose risks to people on the ground who come into contact with the object, particularly if toxic fuels are involved. But that\u2019s only part of the danger, Sorge said, noting that even nontoxic propellants are \u201cstill volatile, like gasoline.\u201d\nTanks may be especially dangerous to handle, according to Sorge: \u201cIf they\u2019re weakened, you touch them, they blow up,\u201d he added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that it\u2019s (always) a death sentence to get close to one of these things,\u201d Sorge said of space debris. \u201cMostly they\u2019re probably OK, but it is potentially risky. And it\u2019s not worth people getting injured.\u201d\nPart of New Glenn\u2019s nose cone\nThe piece of Blue Origin debris that washed up in the Bahamas is not a sign of a rocket launch gone awry. Rather, the debris \u2014 a large chunk of a rocket\u2019s nose cone that features the signatures of Blue Origin employees \u2014 appears to have been discarded as expected from the company\u2019s New Glenn rocket during its maiden flight on January 16.\nThe nose cone, or payload fairing, is designed to shield satellites during launch and break away from the vehicle after it reaches the vacuum of space. And while SpaceX tries to recover fairing pieces as they fall back toward Earth, Blue Origin\u2019s New Glenn was expected to dispose of its nose cone in the ocean.\nIt appears to be what happened before the waves forced a floating piece of the hardware onto the shores of an island in the Bahamas, according to a social media post on Monday.\n\u201cDoes anyone have any muscle power to pull this space ship debris up onto the beach,\u201d the post reads, calling it a hazard and a \u201chistorical find.\u201d\nBlue Origin confirmed that debris from the New Glenn fairing washed up in the Bahamas.\n\u201cSome minor debris from New Glenn\u2019s fairing washed ashore in Abaco, Bahamas, over the weekend,\u201d the company said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday. \u201cThe fairing\u2019s landing in the sea was planned and expected. We have sent a team out to recover the pieces.\u201d\nBlue Origin included contact information for members of the public who may encounter space debris. People can reach out by phone at 321-222-4355 or by email MissionRecovery@blueorigin.com.\nNASA can also be reached at 202-358-0001. And SpaceX has its own debris recovery email: recovery@spacex.com.\nRisk of injury called \u2018extremely remote\u2019\nSpaceX has grappled with debris landing in populated areas even before the Starship mishap in January.\nIn 2021, for example, a Falcon 9 fuel tank landed on a farm in Washington state. And the following year, a piece of a SpaceX Dragon capsule was recovered in Australia.\nA string of other incidents have also made headlines, from a mysterious ring-shaped object that crashed into a village in Kenya in late December to garbage from the International Space Station striking a family home in Florida last year.\nBut space agencies and regulators maintain that space debris poses a minuscule risk to populated areas.\n\u201cPieces that survive have only very rarely caused any damage on the ground. The risk of any satellite reentry causing injury is extremely remote,\u201d the European Space Agency said in a statement. \u201cThe annual risk of an individual human being injured by space debris is under 1 in 100 billion. In comparison, a person is about 65,000 times more likely to be struck by lightning.\u201d"

But 8.5 minutes into flight, the Starship spacecraft itself was lost.\n\u201cStarship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn,\u201d the company shared on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter. \u201cTeams will continue to review data from today\u2019s flight test to better understand root cause. With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today\u2019s flight will help us improve Starship\u2019s reliability.\u201d\nA \u201crapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d or \u201cRUD,\u201d is a phrase SpaceX typically uses to refer to an explosion. Starship had already climbed 90 miles (146 kilometers) in altitude and was traveling at 13,200 miles per hour (21,317 kilometers per hour), according to the last telemetry data shared by SpaceX.\nAircraft-tracking website Flightradar24 shared on X that the Starship explosion caused its most tracked flights to be \u201call aircraft holding or diverting to avoid any potential debris.\u201d Meanwhile, posts are appearing on social media showing purported debris from the spacecraft falling over the Caribbean.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said flights departing Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport were being delayed for an average of one hour due to a \u201crocket launch anomaly.\u201d A separate FAA alert said flights were delayed due to \u201cdebris.\u201d\n\u201cThe FAA briefly slowed and diverted aircraft around the area where space vehicle debris was falling. Normal operations have resumed,\u201d according to a statement from the agency.\nAt 5:55 p.m. ET, 18 minutes after Starship\u2019s launch, a pilot radioed to an air traffic controller at a San Juan air traffic control facility. \u201cWe just got a major streak, going from at least 60 miles, there\u2019s all these different colors, just curious. It looked like it was coming towards us, but obviously because of this, just letting you know,\u201d the pilot said.\nMeanhile, SpaceX founder Elon Musk shared an image of debris in a post and appeared to make light of the situation, saying \u201centertainment is guaranteed!\u201d\nThe Starship spacecraft, stacked atop the Super Heavy rocket booster, took flight at 5:37 p.m. ET (4:37 p.m. local time) Thursday. The rocket booster revved up the 33 engines at its base, sending a loud roar across Starbase, the SpaceX launch site near Brownsville, Texas.\nFor the first time, one of those 33 Raptor engines had been to space before: SpaceX said it was reusing an engine recovered from the Super Heavy booster flown during the company\u2019s fifth test flight in October.\nAs the Super Heavy rocket booster \u2014 the bottommost section, or first stage, of the Starship system \u2014 burned through most of its fuel, SpaceX guided the Super Heavy back to a pinpoint landing at the launch site after it separated from the Starship spacecraft.\nThe Starship spacecraft ignited its own engines and began soaring through space.\nThe company steered the Super Heavy booster squarely into the \u201cchopsticks,\u201d the metal arms of \u201cMechazilla,\u201d which is SpaceX\u2019s name for the launch tower that also serves as a structural mechanism for catching rocket parts as they blaze back down from the sky after launch.\nSpaceX had only successfully recaptured a Super Heavy booster after launch once before, during the fifth fully integrated Starship test flight in October 2024.\nThe maneuver sent an earsplitting sonic boom ringing across the landing site, which is in close proximity to the popular Texas tourist destination of South Padre Island.\nPath for \u2018new generation\u2019 Starship\nWhile the Super Heavy aced its landing attempt, the Starship spacecraft, or upper stage, was expected to continue propelling itself through space, reaching speeds almost fast enough to enter orbit around Earth.\nBut the Starship spacecraft stopped delivering telemetry, suggesting that the spacecraft may have been lost.\n\u201cWe were expecting ship engine cutoff about 40 seconds ago,\u201d said SpaceX spokesperson Dan Huot on the live stream during a crucial part of the ascent phase. \u201cWe saw some of those engines start to go out prior to that point. And so right now we are, we are just standing by to try and get the latest word on where we are.\u201d\nShortly after the update, the team confirmed the loss of the vehicle.\n\u201cWe can confirm that we did lose the ship,\u201d SpaceX engineer Kate Tice said.\nPrior to the completion of Starship\u2019s ascent burn to space, a fire developed in the aft section of the ship, leading to an explosion and sending debris falling into the Atlantic Ocean within the predefined hazard areas, according to SpaceX.\n\u201cStarship flew within its designated launch corridor \u2014 as all U.S. launches do to safeguard the public both on the ground, on water and in the air,\u201d the company shared on its site. \u201cAny surviving pieces of debris would have fallen into the designated hazard area. If you believe you have identified a piece of debris, please do not attempt to handle or retrieve the debris directly. Instead, please contact your local authorities or the SpaceX Debris Hotline at 1-866-623-0234 or at recovery@spacex.com.\u201d\nMusk took to X, which he owns, to share that \u201cimproved versions of the ship (and) booster already waiting for launch.\u201d\n\u201cPreliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity,\u201d Musk added later. \u201cApart from obviously double-checking for leaks, we will add fire suppression to that volume and probably increase vent area. Nothing so far suggests pushing next launch past next month.\u201d\nMeanwhile, outgoing NASA Administrator Bill Nelson shared his thoughts on X. \u201cCongrats to @SpaceX on Starship\u2019s seventh test flight and the second successful booster catch. Spaceflight is not easy. It\u2019s anything but routine. That\u2019s why these tests are so important \u2014 each one bringing us closer on our path to the Moon and onward to Mars through #Artemis.\u201d\nThe \u201cnew generation\u201d Starship flying on the Thursday mission had some substantial upgrades from previous versions, according to SpaceX. The changes included additional fuel capacity, which could allow Starship\u2019s engines to burn longer and generate more speed.\nThe vehicle was also equipped with a more powerful flight computer, revamped navigation, and new antennas that SpaceX hoped would allow Starship to better communicate with the company\u2019s space-based internet network, Starlink.\nCrucially, SpaceX was also for the first time attempting to test out how the Starship vehicle might deploy satellites. On board the spacecraft were 10 dummy payloads that are roughly the same size and weight as SpaceX\u2019s next generation of Starlink satellites.\nAbout 17 minutes into the mission, SpaceX was intended to deploy the mock satellites as part of a demonstration. Like Starship, the demo payloads were not expected to reach orbit. Rather, they would have been on a suborbital trajectory similar to that of Starship, guaranteeing they would be discarded in the ocean, according the company.\nAbout one hour after takeoff, the Starship spacecraft was expected to make a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean. The maneuver was intended to test out how Starship might be recovered after future flights. But as has been the case with the past few test missions, the vehicle would have been discarded and left to a watery grave.\nSpaceX will go back and assess the data from the flight to determine what caused the spacecraft to fail, Huot said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time. In the next hours, days \u2014 we\u2019re going to figure out exactly what happened, come back, fly the next one, get farther,\u201d he said. \u201cReminder, it\u2019s a test of an experimental vehicle.\u201d\nSign up for CNN\u2019s Wonder Theory science newsletter.
