  "content": "When Coinbase embraced artificial intelligence (AI) adoption, its CEO gave workers a week to get on board.\n\nBy completing this form, you agree to receive marketing communications from PYMNTS and to the sharing of your information with our sponsor, if applicable, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions .\n\nComplete the form to unlock this article and enjoy unlimited free access to all PYMNTS content \u2014 no additional logins required.\n\nDuring a podcast interview last week, Brian Armstrong said the cryptocurrency exchange had purchased enterprise licenses for GitHub Copilot and Cursor.\n\n\u201cLike a lot of companies, we\u2019re leaning as hard as we can into AI,\u201d Armstrong said during an episode of Cheeky Pint, hosted by Stripe President and Co-Founder John Collison.\n\nHowever, some employees warned that AI adoption among Coinbase\u2019s could take months, leading the CEO to push back.\n\n\u201cI went rogue,\u201d he said, and posted a mandate in Coinbase\u2019s engineering Slack channel. \u201cI said, \u2018AI is important. We need you to all learn it and at least onboard. You don\u2019t have to use it every day yet until we do some training, but at least onboard by the end of the week. And if not, I\u2019m hosting a meeting on Saturday with everybody who hasn\u2019t done it and I\u2019d like to meet with you to understand why.\u2019\u201d\n\nSome of the people who came to that meeting had good reasons, Armstrong added, such as employees who had been on vacation.\n\n\u201cAnd some of them didn\u2019t and they got fired,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people really didn\u2019t like that, by the way, that heavy-handed approach. But I think it did at least set some clarity that we need to lean into this and learn about it.\u201d\n\nAs PYMNTS has written, AI adoption rates among businesses can depend on the type of AI technology in question.\n\nFor example, the past few years have seen a surge in generative AI adoptions, with chief financial officers using this technology for tasks like content creation, customer service, coding and data analysis. Research by PYMNTS Intelligence has found that generative AI\u2019s deployment for product and service innovation has risen 21% and for spotting fraud and errors up 31% since March 2024.\n\n\u201cDespite the benefits of generative AI and its growing importance, CFOs remain cautious about agentic AI due to fears it could go off script, leading to cascading payment errors, sanctions screening failures and compliance fines,\u201d PYMNTS wrote last week, with just 15% of finance chiefs saying they are even thinking about putting agentic AI to work, with most still in the early evaluation stage.\n\n\u201cChallenges like infrastructure gaps, the transparency of large language models, and unsettled audit and regulatory standards further contribute to this hesitation,\u201d PYMNTS added.",

      "text": "It started with moving from legal pads to spreadsheets. Then shifted from spreadsheets to accounting and payments automation. Next, gen AI came along and the trend from manual finance management and forecasting took on a new speed and urgency. Now a new, more sophisticated and complicated form of AI is here, one that requires CFOs to let go of the wheel in a big way.\nIt\u2019s agentic AI. It promises to turn yesterday\u2019s month-end close into a continuous, autonomous, automated predictive engine. On the consumer side, agents are being pitched as a shopping assistant and task manager. But the more impactful usage will come from the business side of the economy. With capital markets bracing for tighter spreads and relentless rate volatility, the pressure to capture AI\u2019s agentic speed advantage is suddenly urgent. CFOs know that, but \u2026\nThe same executives who champion agentic AI\u2019s autonomy are privately questioning whether the technology is battle-ready. PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s coverage\u2014including last week\u2019s (June 21) interview with Trustly chief legal officer Kathryn McCall\u2014underscores a growing fear that agentic AI can go \u201coff script,\u201d exposing firms to cascading payment errors, sanctions screening failures and headline-grabbing compliance fines. Infrastructure gaps, large language model transparency and still unsettled audit and regulatory standards mean accountability remains a moving target. For finance leaders, the message is stark: Harness AI\u2019s momentum now, but build the guardrails before the next quarterly call\u2014or risk owning the fallout.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that enterprise CFOs aren\u2019t ignoring agentic AI, but neither are they racing to deploy it. Familiarity with the technology is nearly universal, as expected from the hype. But the execution-level confidence isn\u2019t there yet. Just 15% of executives surveyed by PYMNTS Intelligence are considering putting it to work, and most of those remain in the early evaluation stage. The hesitation comes even as the use of gen AI has surged. Among its use cases: creating content, fielding customer service queries, coding software and analyzing data. Since March 2024, the share of CFOs deploying the technology to innovate products and services has jumped 21%. Meanwhile, its use for spotting fraud and errors has climbed 31% over that same period.\nHere\u2019s another interesting finding: CFOs are more likely to trust agentic if they\u2019ve been successful with gen AI. The momentum behind agentic AI, which goes one step further than its precursor by autonomously making decisions and carrying out tasks independently of humans, builds at companies where the latter has lived up to its promise. Among highly automated firms, 67% are weighing agentic AI adoption, compared to just 11% of their low-automation peers.\nLikewise, firms reporting strong return on investment (ROI) from gen AI are twice as likely to increase their spending compared to low-automation CFOs. Among the big questions: Will the technology take away jobs? Across the board, CFOs say that gen AI has reshaped staffing needs. All report needing more analytically skilled workers, and nearly all agree that the overall skill mix across teams has changed. AI is on its way to presenting another level of automation to CFOs, one that will require a prerequisite course in gen AI deployment to understand and a more cautious, patient approach.\nThese are just some of the findings detailed in \u201cThe CAIO Report: The Agentic Trust Gap: Enterprise CFOs Push Pause on Agentic AI,\u201d a PYMNTS Intelligence and AI-ID collaboration. This edition examines the future of autonomous AI in enterprise settings and draws on insights from a survey of 60 CFOs conducted in May 2025.\nAgentic AI Adoption Lags Despite High Familiarity\nCFOs know the term, but not the tech.\nTechnology companies developing and selling agentic AI tools have done a strong job of making sure companies know what\u2019s on offer. Every CFO now knows about the technology and its potential to fully automate a host of labor-intensive business functions, from cybersecurity to product development. The reality is that very few companies are actually using it.\nDespite nearly universal familiarity, just 15% of CFOs are even considering putting agentic AI to work in their companies\u2014and 85% say they have no current plans. Among those considering climbing on board, 89% remain in the evaluation phase, with no concrete roadmap in place.\nBut that top-line number obscures a more nuanced story. Adoption interest closely tracks how far firms have already gone with gen AI automation. More than two in three CFOs from high-automation enterprises are considering agentic AI. That figure plunges to 11% among firms still dependent on manual workflows. Firms that already automate processes more are more willing to explore what comes next.\nThe same split appears by self-reported impact. One-quarter of high-impact CFOs\u2014those whose companies are most active in using gen AI\u2014are at least considering the agentic version. In medium- and low-impact roles, the share drops to 12% and 7%, respectively. The gap reflects how closely interest in autonomous systems aligns with C-suite support.\nEven among executives considering adoption, active test runs of the technology remain rare. Just 6% of high-impact CFOs, meaning executives at highly automated firms, say they\u2019re exploring adoption within the next year.\nGen AI Use Cases Surge While Investment Cools\nAgentic AI remains an idea, not a project.\nWhat is clear is that companies are not accelerating their use of agentic tools. Among CFOs considering adopting the technology, 89% say their organizations are still evaluating its relevance and fit. Just 11% are running pilots or proof-of-concept trials. Another 11% report active vendor partnerships. The overlap means that very few are doing more than research and actively using the technology.\nEven among the most engaged segment\u2014high-impact CFOs\u2014activity remains limited. One in five say their firms are piloting agentic AI. The same share reports working with vendors to explore early use cases. That leaves four in five still in the planning phase. These CFOs are best positioned to move forward\u2014but most have yet to do so.\nEngagement is nonexistent among lower-impact personas. No medium- or low-impact CFOs say their firms are evaluating agentic AI. None are testing deployments. None are working with partners. This total lack of movement reinforces the idea that strategic influence is a precondition for even limited adoption steps.\nCaution among more uncertain firms may reflect broader pressures. Gen AI has become essential\u201490% of CFOs say it\u2019s now critical for financial planning. Use is expanding across fraud detection, service innovation and real-time query response. Still, investment in the technology is slowing. Just 27% of firms are increasing budgets this year\u2014down from 53% last year. That contraction likely spills over to agentic AI, which requires even greater confidence and trust in the technology.\nUntil firms commit time, budgets and cross-functional leadership, agentic AI could sit stuck where it is today: as a widely known tool with promise for transforming business operations, but no timeline for that to happen.\nAutomation and ROI Drive Future Adoption Plans\nOver the past year, CFOs have doubled the importance they place on Gen AI.\nWhile companies have been slow to deploy agentic AI, their use of gen AI has nearly doubled. Nine in 10 CFOs now say it\u2019s very or extremely important to financial planning and analysis\u2014up from just 47% in March 2024. That shift reflects not just broader use but growing operational dependence on the technology. Gen AI has become core to how CFOs plan, monitor and execute across financial domains.\nUsage continues to expand. Since March 2024, gen AI\u2019s use for product and service innovation has grown 21%. Deployment for spotting fraud and operational errors is up 31%. Three out of four CFOs now say they use the technology to generate real-time, automated responses to customer queries.\nIt all demonstrates that gen AI is no longer siloed to a narrow, individual task: CFOs say the technology\u2019s value reaches across core functions. The tool ranks as highly important for financial reporting (87%), cost management (85%) and capital management (88%). More than 70% say it\u2019s critical for strategic planning, risk management and working capital optimization. The shift isn\u2019t limited to back-end efficiency\u2014it spans decision making, compliance and customer experience.\nStill, enthusiasm is now tempered by caution. Just 27% of firms are increasing their gen AI budgets in 2025\u2014down from 53% a year ago. Investment plans now track closely with results. Among firms reporting strong ROI, half are increasing spend. Among firms with negligible ROI, that number drops to 17%.\nAutomation levels matter, too. Highly automated firms are three times more likely to consider agentic AI adoption than low-automation peers. These firms have already laid the groundwork\u2014and now view agentic AI as a logical next step. Firms that have scaled gen AI\u2014and benefited\u2014are the ones continuing to invest.\nGen AI Shifts Workforce Needs and Skill Priorities\nCFOs agree they need more analytically skilled workers in their businesses.\nGen AI has started reshaping the talent CFOs need to transform how they operate. All CFOs now say implementation of the technology has increased their need for more analytically skilled workers. In March 2024, that share stood closer to 60%. The shift in the past year reflects growing hands-on use and a rising urgency to close capability gaps.\nThe impact goes beyond analytics alone. Ninety-seven percent of CFOs say the overall mix of skills required across the business has changed. As gen AI automates workflows and elevates data as a core asset, all with the involvement of humans, CFOs increasingly need talent that can evaluate, interpret and act on machine-generated output.\nTech teams are expanding in response. Eighty-three percent of CFOs now say they need a larger technology or IT support team. That\u2019s up 25 percentage points from 58% in March 2024. Demand for high-skill tech roles has grown as gen AI tools become more embedded in daily operations.\nAt the same time, demand for lower-skilled labor is falling. More than six in 10 CFOs say their need for such workers has declined. Nearly half (45%) say they no longer need to hire as many employees as possible in certain businesses. The trend points to gen AI\u2019s role in reducing headcount pressure while reallocating hiring needs to higher-value, higher-skilled roles.\nThe workforce shift is structural. Skills once considered specialized\u2014like data fluency and systems thinking\u2014are fast becoming baseline requirements. gen AI isn\u2019t just changing the tools teams use. It\u2019s changing who organizations need to hire, train and retain to stay competitive.\nRead More\nPYMNTS Intelligence is the leading provider of information on the trends driving AI adoption patterns.

      "text": "That\u2019s a key finding from PYMNTS Intelligence\u2019s July CAIO Report, \u201cThe Agentic Trust Gap: Enterprise CFOs Push Pause on Agentic AI,\u201d based on a May survey of 60 enterprise chief financial officers.\nThe report highlights that while familiarity with agentic AI is nearly universal among CFOs, promising to transform processes like month-end close into continuous, autonomous engines, there is hesitation regarding its deployment. Only 15% of executives surveyed are even considering putting agentic AI to work, with most remaining in the early evaluation stage.\nThis contrasts with the surging adoption of generative AI, which CFOs are increasingly using for tasks like content creation, customer service, coding and data analysis. The report shows generative AI\u2019s deployment for product and service innovation up 21% and for spotting fraud and errors up 31% since March 2024.\nThe report underscores that the willingness to embrace agentic AI, which goes a step further than its predecessor by autonomously making decisions and carrying out tasks independently, is not uniform. Instead, it is influenced by a firm\u2019s existing levels of automation and the tangible return on investment (ROI) already realized from generative AI.\nThis suggests that confidence in more advanced AI systems is built upon a foundation of successful prior AI implementation and a proven track record of automation within the enterprise.\nHere are specific data points detailing how automation and ROI are shaping future adoption plans:\n- Automation as a Prerequisite: Among highly automated firms, 67% of CFOs are weighing agentic AI adoption, a contrast to just 11% of their low-automation peers. Highly automated firms, having already laid the groundwork, are three times more likely to consider agentic AI as a logical next step.\n- ROI Drives Further Investment: Companies that report strong ROI from their generative AI initiatives are twice as likely to increase their spending on AI compared to low-automation CFOs. Among firms with strong ROI, half are increasing their AI budgets, whereas only 17% of firms with negligible ROI plan to do so.\n- Growing Reliance on Generative AI: CFOs\u2019 perception of generative AI\u2019s importance for financial planning and analysis has nearly doubled, with 9 in 10 now deeming it \u201cvery or extremely important,\u201d up from 47% in March 2024. This indicates a growing operational dependence on generative AI across core financial functions like reporting, cost management and strategic planning.\nDespite the benefits of generative AI and its growing importance, CFOs remain cautious about agentic AI due to fears it could go off script, leading to cascading payment errors, sanctions screening failures and compliance fines. Challenges like infrastructure gaps, the transparency of large language models, and unsettled audit and regulatory standards further contribute to this hesitation.\nThe report also reveals that generative AI is reshaping workforce needs, increasing the demand for analytically skilled workers and altering the overall skill mix across teams, while reducing the need for lower-skilled labor.\nAdditionally, while generative AI use cases surge, overall investment in the technology is cooling, with only 27% of firms increasing budgets this year, down from 53% last year, a trend that likely impacts agentic AI adoption.\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."

      "text": "Most chief financial officers (CFOs) say they understand the concept of agentic artificial intelligence \u2014 systems that can plan, reason and take actions with minimal or no human input \u2014 but few are ready to implement the technology.\nAccording to a July 2025 PYMNTS Intelligence report, nearly all CFOs polled were aware of agentic AI, yet only 15% expressed interest in deploying it within their organizations.\nThe gap reflects lingering skepticism among business leaders about the maturity and business value of artificial intelligence agents in their current form. While the technology holds promise for automating complex workflows and improving decision-making, many remain cautious amid concerns about implementation risks, oversight challenges and unproven ROI.\n\u201cA lot of companies are excited about what agentic AI can do, but not enough are thinking about what it takes to use it safely,\u201d James Prolizo, chief information security officer at Sovos, told PYMNTS. \u201cThese tools are starting to make real decisions, not just automate tasks, and that changes the game.\u201d\nA key roadblock is lack of trust in agentic systems. According the PYMNTS report\u2019s supplemental data, building trust depends on the following:\n- User-friendly traceability: Able to provide user-friendly reports and visualizations that clearly explain the reasons behind an AI agent\u2019s actions, with the ability to trace outputs back to the underlying input data and logic.\n- Human-in-the-loop safeguards: Human-in-the-loop controls must be present to provide ongoing human supervision and enable intervention when critical decisions are being made.\n- Built-in bias monitoring: Mechanisms must be present that identify and minimize bias in AI-generated content and analyses to ensure fairness and accuracy.\nWithout these elements, CFOs are unlikely to delegate decision-making authority to software agents, according to experts.\n\u201cFinance leaders need to implicitly trust their systems to be accurate and predictable,\u201d Justin Etkin, co-founder and COO of Tropic, told PYMNTS. \u201cMainstream adoption will only occur when CFOs can see the concrete value and have confidence that these systems won\u2019t go rogue or produce the unpredictable results that currently tarnish AI\u2019s reputation in financial contexts.\u201d\nEtkin added that CFOs are looking for AI solutions that go beyond basic automation by offering paper trails, step-by-step actions with \u201cundo\u201d capabilities, and measurable time savings.\nThe hesitation among finance executives stands in contrast to a more optimistic outlook in other parts of the enterprise.\nRaju Malhotra, chief product and technology officer at Certinia, pointed to strong momentum in the professional services sector. \u201cAgentic AI is the most transformative addition. Autonomous digital workers can create a hybrid workforce that blends AI with human teams,\u201d he said.\nMalhotra cited Certinia\u2019s own research showing that 83% of professional services firms are already deploying or planning to deploy agentic artificial intelligence in professional services automation within the next year.\nYet Malhotra acknowledged that even among early adopters, results are uneven. \u201cMany organizations still struggle to see returns, with 29% stating current AI solutions fall short of expectations. The reasons are clear: a lack of internal skills and fragmented data,\u201d he said.\nSee also: The Two Faces of AI: Gen AI\u2019s Triumph Meets Agentic AI\u2019s Caution\nAgents Must Connect to Legacy Systems\nIn financial settings, where decisions must often comply with regulatory mandates and also pass audits, the technical and cultural barriers are even higher. Integration is a major issue.\nAgentic systems must connect with a wide array of internal platforms \u2014 from enterprise resource planning (ERP) software to forecasting models to compliance tools. According to Chaim Mazal, chief security officer at Gigamon, legacy IT infrastructure can become a bottleneck, especially when it comes to visibility and security.\n\u201cAs AI workloads drive a surge in network traffic \u2014 doubling it in one in three organizations \u2014 traditional monitoring tools are increasingly overwhelmed,\u201d Mazal told PYMNTS. \u201cThis makes it harder to detect when agentic AI is acting outside intended parameters, sharing sensitive data, or accessing unauthorized systems.\u201d\nMazal said encrypted traffic and siloed authentication systems make it difficult to monitor agentic AI activity in real time. \u201cUntil companies integrate AI-aware telemetry and achieve deep, real-time observability into all data in motion, they won\u2019t be equipped to securely govern agentic AI. Simply put: if you can\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t secure it.\u201d\nBeyond the technical obstacles, agentic AI also poses human and cultural challenges.\nEric Karofsky, founder of VectorHX, emphasized the importance of trust and usability. \u201cRegardless of how sophisticated the technology or streamlined the automation, adoption comes down to whether real people can actually trust and use these systems without frustration,\u201d he told PYMNTS. \u201cWhen customers experience agentic AI that feels like a black box making unexplained decisions, their trust disappears faster than any efficiency gains can make up.\u201d\nEven in markets like payments, where automation has long played a role, agentic AI raises fresh concerns.\nEdwin Loredo, partner at Core Innovation Capital, pointed to the risks of fraud, misuse of permissions and the need for stronger authentication and oversight mechanisms. \u201cFraud is very likely to increase. Agents can be manipulated, permissions can be exploited and bad actors will look for the edge cases in these automated systems,\u201d he told PYMNTS.\nIn Loredo\u2019s view, agentic AI will require domain-specific interfaces and rigorous logic tailored to the unique needs of industries or sectors such as finance, insurance and healthcare. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely a single general-purpose agent can serve all use cases well,\u201d he said.\nFor now, CFOs are staying cautious. While the potential of agentic AI is widely acknowledged, few finance leaders are willing to deploy systems that operate beyond their control. As the technology matures, vendors and internal teams will need to meet higher standards for transparency, security and ROI to make adoption viable. Until then, agentic AI may remain mostly a buzzword in the boardroom.\nRead more:\nAI at the Crossroads: Agentic Ambitions Meet Operational Realities\nThe Agentic Trust Gap: Enterprise CFOs Push Pause on Agentic AI\nPayments Execs on Agentic AI: \u2018The Back Office Will Never Be the Same\u2019\nFor all PYMNTS AI coverage, subscribe to the daily AI Newsletter."
