  "title": "Ukraine marks Independence Day as Vance says Russia has made \" significant concessions\"",
  "description": "Russia accused Ukraine of launching drone attacks that sparked a fire at a nuclear power plant in its western Kursk region overnight Sunday.",
  "content": "Ukraine on Sunday marked 34 years since its independence, as Russia accused the country of launching drone attacks that sparked a fire at a nuclear power plant in its western Kursk region overnight.\n\nThe weekend's developments come as U.S. Vice President JD Vance said in an interview that he believes \"the Russians have made significant concessions to President Trump for the first time in three and a half years of this conflict.\"\n\n\"They've actually been willing to be flexible on some of their core demands,\" Vance said in an interview with NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that aired Sunday. \"They've talked about what would be necessary to end the war. Of course, they haven't been completely there yet, or the war would be over. But we're engaging in this diplomatic process in good faith.\"\n\nPresident Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders last week at the White House, which Zelenskyy praised as \"genuine unity.\"\n\nVance, who was present at Monday's meeting, told \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that \"we are trying to negotiate as much as we can with both the Russians and the Ukrainians to find a middle ground to stop the killing.\"\n\nHowever, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov also appeared on \"Meet the Press,\" saying there is no planned meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\"Putin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy when the agenda would be ready for a summit, and this agenda is not ready at all,\" Lavrov said.\n\nRussian officials said several power and energy facilities were targeted in the overnight strikes. The fire at the nuclear facility was quickly extinguished with no injuries reported, according to the plant's press service on Telegram. While the attack damaged a transformer, radiation levels remained within normal ranges.\n\nThe United Nations' nuclear watchdog said it was aware of media reports that a transformer at the plant had caught fire \"due to military activity,\" but hadn't received independent confirmation. It said its director-general, Rafael Mariano Grossi, said \"every nuclear facility must be protected at all times.\"\n\nUkraine did not immediately comment on the alleged attack.\n\nFirefighters also responded to a blaze at the port of Ust-Luga in Russia's Leningrad region, home to a major fuel export terminal. The regional governor said approximately 10 Ukrainian drones were shot down, with debris igniting the fire.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry claimed its air defenses intercepted 95 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory overnight into Sunday.\n\nRussia fired 72 drones and decoys, along with a cruise missile, into Ukraine overnight into Sunday, Ukraine's air force said. Of these, 48 drones were shot down or jammed.\n\nThe incidents occurred as Ukraine marked Independence Day, commemorating its 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. Zelenskyy delivered remarks in a video address from Kyiv's Independence Square, emphasizing the nation's resolve.\n\n\"We are building a Ukraine that will have enough strength and power to live in security and peace,\" Zelenskyy said, calling for a \"just peace.\"\n\n\"What our future will be is up to us alone,\" he said, in a nod to the U.S.\u2013Russia summit in Alaska earlier in August, which many feared would leave Ukrainian and European interests sidelined.\n\n\"And the world knows this. And the world respects this. It respects Ukraine. It perceives Ukraine as an equal,\" he said.\n\nU.S. special envoy Keith Kellogg was in attendance at Independence Day celebrations in Kyiv, during which Zelenskyy awarded him the Ukrainian Order of Merit, of the first degree.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney arrived in Kyiv on Sunday morning for meetings with Zelenskyy.\n\n\"On this special day \u2014 Ukraine's Independence Day \u2014 it is especially important for us to feel the support of our friends. And Canada has always stood by our side,\" wrote Andriy Yermak, Zelenskyy's chief of staff.\n\nIn a joint news conference with Zelenskyy, Carney said Canada will invest CA$2 billion (about US$1.44 billion) in new military assistance for Ukraine to boost its army and provide urgently needed weapons.\n\nZelenskyy said the two leaders were considering the presence of Canadian forces on the ground in Ukraine as part of a reassurance force.\n\nNorway announced significant new military aid Sunday, pledging about 7 billion kroner (about US$695 million) for air defense systems. Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store said Norway and Germany are jointly funding two Patriot systems, including missiles, with Norway also helping procure air defense radar.\n\nPope Leo XIV prayed Sunday for peace in Ukraine as he marked the country's Independence Day with a special appeal during his weekly noon blessing. He said the faithful were joining Ukrainians \"asking that the Lord give peace to their martyred country.\"\n\nLeo also sent a telegram to Zelenskyy, which the Ukrainian leader posted on X along with similar notes from other world leaders.\n\nIn the letter, Leo assured his prayers for all Ukrainians who are suffering and wrote: \"I implore the Lord to move the hearts of people of good will, that the clamor of arms may fall silent and give way to dialogue, opening the path to peace for the good of all.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Russia's troops continued their push in eastern and northern Ukraine, where Russia claimed Saturday that its forces had seized two villages in the Donetsk region. The Main Intelligence Directorate of Ukraine's Defense Ministry said Sunday that Ukraine had taken back control of the village of Novomykhailivka, also in the Donetsk region.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said Sunday that 146 Russian servicemen had been returned from Ukraine, in exchange for the same number of Ukrainian servicemen. The ministry said the latest exchange also included eight residents of Russia's Kursk region, which was subject to a surprise Ukrainian incursion in August 2024, who were returned to Russia after being held in Ukraine.\n\nShortly after the Russian announcement, Zelenskyy said that \"our people are coming home.\" He said those being exchanged included members of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the National Guard, the State Border Guard Service and civilians. \"Most of them had been in captivity since 2022,\" he said.\n\nZelenskyy did not confirm the number of prisoners involved in the exchange.\n\nWelcome to New Orleans",

      "text": "Trump, Zelenskyy, European leaders present united front on Ukraine in White House meeting\nWhat to know about Monday's Trump-Zelenskyy meeting at the White House\n- President Trump hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders at the White House on Monday, an event the U.S. president called \"a very good, early step\" to possibly resolve the war in Ukraine.\n- The leaders showed unity, with Zelenskyy and European allies stressing the need for security guarantees in an eventual peace deal to deter Russia from invading in the future. Mr. Trump said any guarantees would involve U.S. \"coordination.\"\n- Mr. Trump said he called Russian President Vladimir Putin shortly after the meetings wrapped up, as he aims to set up a summit between Putin and Zelenskyy. Putin met with Mr. Trump in Alaska last week.\n- It's unclear whether the talks will lead to a peace deal. Bradley Bowman from the Foundation for Defense of Democracies told CBS News the public parts of Monday's meetings largely went \"very, very well,\" but the \"proof will be in the pudding in the coming days.\"\nZelenskyy praises \"genuine unity\" at White House meetings, thanks U.S. for floating security guarantees\nZelenskyy thanked Mr. Trump and several European allies who attended Monday's talks at the White House, describing them as \"important negotiations\" in a post on X.\n\"It was a long and detailed conversation, including discussions about the situation on the battlefield and our steps to bring peace closer,\" Zelenskyy said of his talks with the U.S. president.\nHe said the discussions included security guarantees for Ukraine, adding that he appreciated \"the important signal from the United States regarding its readiness to support and be part of these guarantees.\"\nIt's not clear how any possible security guarantees to insulate Ukraine from another Russian invasion would work, or how involved the U.S. would be. But Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social earlier Monday that guarantees would be provided by European countries, in \"coordination with the United States of America.\"\nZelenskyy also said the White House meetings included discussions about returning Ukrainian children and prisoners of war held by Russia, and he noted that Mr. Trump has pushed for a summit between Zelenskyy and Putin.\n\"Today was an important step, a demonstration of genuine unity between Europe and the United States,\" he wrote. \"The leaders personally came to support Ukraine and to discuss everything that will bring us closer to real peace, to a reliable security architecture that will protect Ukraine and all of Europe.\"\nRubio says \"we're working on\" Putin-Zelenskyy meeting\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio told Fox News that \"we're working on\" setting up a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, an idea he called \"unprecedented.\"\nMr. Trump says he spoke to Putin on the phone Monday and pushed for a one-on-one meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart, followed by talks between Mr. Trump, Putin and Zelenskyy.\n\"I'm not saying they're going to leave that room with a peace deal, but I think the fact that people are now talking to each other: This wasn't happening for three and a half years. This was a stalemated war of death and destruction,\" Rubio said.\nRubio also said \"each side is going to have to make some concessions\" to resolve the Russia-Ukraine war, but Ukraine will also need to \"feel safe moving forward,\" referring to discussions of security guarantees for the eastern European country.\nTrump says he discussed missing children with EU leader\nAfter meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders, Mr. Trump said he and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had discussed \"the massive Worldwide problem of missing children,\" with a goal of \"bringing them home to their families.\"\nVon der Leyen responded by thanking Mr. Trump, and wrote that \"every single Ukrainian child abducted by Russia must be returned to their families.\"\nSince Moscow's invasion of Ukraine began more than three years ago, reports have emerged of Russian troops separating Ukrainian children from their families and giving them to Russian families. The forced removals \u2014 which Russia claims are a humanitarian move \u2014 led the International Criminal Court to issue an arrest warrant against Putin for alleged war crimes in 2023.\nMr. Trump's Truth Social post on missing children did not mention Russia specifically. But first lady Melania Trump penned an open letter to Putin over the weekend pleading with him to protect \"the innocence of these children.\"\nZelenskyy says no date for meeting with Putin\nShortly after leaving talks at the White House, Zelenskyy told CBS News that he hasn't set a date to meet with Putin, but he's prepared for a summit with the Russian president.\nMr. Trump has pushed for a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy, followed by a trilateral meeting with the two leaders and the U.S. president.\n\"Ukraine will never stop on the way to peace, and we are ready for any kind of format, but on the level of leaders,\" Zelenskyy said at an impromptu press conference in Lafayette Square in Washington, D.C.\nNATO chief calls Trump-Zelenskyy meeting \"very successful\"\nNATO Secretary General Mark Rutte called Monday's meeting between Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy and European leaders \"very successful\" in an interview with Fox News.\nRutte said that the group discussed security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 which Zelenskyy has cast as a key facet of any potential deal with Moscow. He said the leaders did not talk about the possibility of Ukraine ceding some of its territory to Russia because they need \"full clarity\" on how the guarantees will work.\nAsked about a call between the U.S. president and Putin, Rutte said Mr. Trump was able to get the Russian leader to agree to a meeting with Zelenskyy.\nZelenskyy holding press conference near White House after Trump talks\nZelenskyy has left the White House and is holding a press conference steps away, in Lafayette Square, following meetings with Mr. Trump and European leaders.\nTrump's hot mic moment with Macron\nAs the meeting with Zelenskyy and the European leaders was beginning, a hot mic captured a brief conversation President Trump was having with French President Emmanuel Macron.\nMr. Trump can be heard mentioning setting \"a trilat,\" presumably between Zelenskyy, Putin and Mr. Trump. And then in a comment that seemed to be about Putin, the president told Macron, \" I think he wants to make a deal. I think he wants to make a deal for me. You understand that? As crazy as it sounds.\"\nTrump says Europe could give security guarantees to Ukraine with U.S. \"coordination\"\nMr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that he discussed security guarantees for Ukraine during his meeting with Zelenskyy and the leaders of several European countries.\nHe said the guarantees \"would be provided by the various European Countries, with a coordination with the United States of America.\"\nThe U.S. president also called the meeting \"a very good, early step.\"\nZelenskyy has argued that his country needs security guarantees as part of any ceasefire deal with Russia to prevent Putin from reinvading Ukraine. Mr. Trump said earlier Monday that \"we will give [Ukraine] very good protection.\"\nThe exact structure of those guarantees is unclear \u2014 including whether it would require the U.S. or its European allies to get involved in a possible future Russia-Ukraine conflict.\nUkraine has sought membership in NATO, which would obligate the alliance's other members to come to Ukraine's defense if it were invaded. But Mr. Trump ruled out NATO membership for Ukraine on Sunday.\nTrump says he called Putin to set up meeting with Zelenskyy\nMr. Trump said he called Putin shortly after his White House meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders, aiming to arrange a joint session between the Ukrainian and Russian leaders.\n\"After that meeting takes place, we will have a Trilat, which would be the two Presidents, plus myself,\" the president wrote on Truth Social.\nIt's unclear if either side has agreed to the proposed meeting.\nTrump shows Zelenskyy a map of Ukrainian territories held by Russia\nA map that appeared to show percentages of Ukrainian regions occupied by Russia was on display in the Oval Office during Mr. Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy.\nZelenskyy appeared to acknowledge the map during a later meeting with Mr. Trump and European leaders, saying he had shown Mr. Trump battlefield details on a map.\n\"Thank you for the map, by the way,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\"Good map,\" Mr. Trump responded.\n\"I'm thinking how to take it back,\" Zelenskyy quipped.\n\"We'll get you one,\" said Mr. Trump.\nThe map is more than a souvenir, though. Whether Russia will retain control of Ukrainian territory \u2014 and what territories it will continue to occupy \u2014 is a key factor in the peace negotiations. Moscow has pressed Kyiv to cede control of eastern Ukraine's Donbas region in exchange for a ceasefire, a demand Zelenskyy has pushed back on.\nLate Sunday, Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that Zelenskyy can end the war \"almost immediately\" if he agrees to several demands, including \"No getting back Obama given Crimea\" \u2014 referring to the Ukrainian peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014. President Obama did not recognize Crimea as part of Russia.\nTrump's East Room meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders ends; talks continue in Oval Office\nMr. Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy and European leaders in the White House's East Room has concluded, the White House confirmed. The meeting lasted more than two hours.\nZelenskyy's press secretary Serhii Nikiforov told Ukrainian journalists that negotiations later resumed in the Oval Office in a \"leaders only\" format.\nZelenskyy emphasizes importance of returning abducted children and prisoners in peace deal\nIn his comments at the beginning of the multilateral meeting, Zelenskyy emphasized the importance of securing the return of Ukrainian prisoners of war and tens of thousands of Ukrainian children who have been abducted by Russia.\n\"It's very important to exchange all the prisoners, and I think the president will help, and I was very thankful to your wife, again, Mr. President, for the letter about our abducted children,\" Zelenskyy said, referring to a letter first lady Melania Trump wrote to Putin. \"And I hope that really it can be a historic role for the people to bring kids back to the families, and be happy \u2026 This is so, so important and I'm happy that we discussed it.\"\nOn Sunday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the U.S. has \"repeatedly raised that issue in every forum possible.\"\n\"Children should be returned to their families. On that position, I don't think there's any ambiguity on our side,\" he said. \"And they shouldn't even be a bargaining chip, in regards to a broader negotiation.\"\nPublic parts of White House talks went \"very well\" but \"proof will be in the pudding,\" expert says\nThe visible parts of Mr. Trump's meetings with Zelenskyy and European leaders went, by and large, \"very, very well,\" but the \"proof will be in the pudding in the coming days,\" said Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.\nBowman said he had hoped going into Monday that the leaders would \"present a unified image of strength,\" and that largely happened. Bowman said he hopes Mr. Trump sees today as a \"big win\" for the U.S., as it \"strengthens Mr. Trump's negotiating hand,\" and \"he shouldn't fritter that away.\"\nBut Bowman has been concerned that Mr. Trump's Alaska meeting with Putin would \"provide Putin an opportunity to further delay or avoid consequences, and so far that's what has happened.\"\n\"At some point, you're going to have to impose some consequences,\" Bowman said of the United States' posture toward Russia.\nBefore the Alaska summit, Mr. Trump warned that Russia would face \"severe consequences\" if it didn't stop the fighting. But he said Monday that a ceasefire may not be a prerequisite for a trilateral meeting.\n\"I thought that was the most unfortunate excerpt\" from today's meeting, Bowman said. A ceasefire is \"the most obvious concession [Putin] should make,\" he added.\n\"He's continued to attack Ukraine and Ukrainians,\" Bowman said, speaking to Putin's unwillingness to end the war peacefully.\nWhat \"security guarantees\" for Ukraine could mean\nThe issue of \"security guarantees\" for Ukraine has loomed large over the White House talks, with all the leaders seemingly in agreement about the need to bolster Ukraine's defenses under any eventual peace deal with the goal of deterring Russian aggression in the future. Many analysts and European officials warn that Putin would be emboldened to seize more territory down the line without a robust security agreement.\nThe contours of what those guarantees would look like are still being hashed out. But comments on Monday indicated that leaders were considering potential peacekeeping troops on the ground, defense and intelligence support for Kyiv and bolstering the Ukrainian army.\nSteve Witkoff, Mr. Trump's special envoy, hinted at one possibility for ensuring Ukraine's defense over the weekend.\nAppearing on CNN on Sunday, Witkoff said the guarantees could be styled on Article 5 of the NATO charter, which states that an attack on one of the 32 members of the transatlantic alliance would be considered an attack on all. That promise of collective defense has served as the underpinning of security in Europe since NATO's founding in 1949, deterring direct aggression against its members during the Cold War and beyond.\nRussia vehemently opposes Ukraine joining NATO, viewing it as a threat to its own security. But an Article 5-like arrangement without formally admitting Ukraine into the alliance could reassure Kyiv in a way that Russia might accept. Witkoff said Putin would be open to the U.S. and Europe offering that sort of protection for Ukraine.\nMr. Trump acknowledged that the U.S. would \"be involved\" in any arrangement to guarantee Ukraine's security, but said Europe would play a large role as well. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he thought the leaders could make progress on formulating an Article 5-style arrangement on Monday.\nEuropean leaders tie security guarantees for Ukraine to their own defense\nSeveral of the leaders assembled around the table stressed the importance of guaranteeing Ukraine's security, not just for Kyiv but for the continent as a whole.\n\"When we talk about security, we're talking about the security not just of Ukraine, we're talking about the security of Europe and the United Kingdom as well,\" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said.\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said any agreement should focus on \"how to be sure that it won't happen again,\" referring to Russia's invasion.\nAlexander Stubb, the president of Finland, said the security guarantees are a \"big part of this.\" Finland joined NATO in 2023 in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\"Some of the international media might wonder, why is the president of Finland here? I think the reason is probably that we might come from a small country, but we have a long border with Russia, over 800 miles,\" Stubb said, mentioning Finland's own history with Russia, including the Soviet invasion of the country during World War II.\n\"If I look at the silver lining of where we stand right now, we found a solution in 1944, and I'm sure we'll be able to find a solution in 2025 to end Russia's war of aggression and find and get a lasting and just peace,\" Stubb said.\nMacron: \"Everybody around this table is in favor of peace\"\nThe French president said that \"everybody around this table is in favor of peace,\" noting that \"when we speak about security guarantees, we speak about the whole security of the European continent.\"\n\"This is why we are all united here with Ukraine on this matter,\" Macron said.\nMacron said to Mr. Trump, \"you can count on us as we can count on you\" to deliver peace for Ukraine and Europe more broadly.\nGermany's Merz stresses need for ceasefire before next meeting with Putin\nMerz, the German chancellor, said he \"can't imagine\" another meeting taking place without a ceasefire, a subtle suggestion to Mr. Trump that Putin should not be granted another meeting without agreeing to end the fighting in Ukraine.\n\"I can't imagine that the next meeting would take place without a ceasefire,\" Merz said. \"So let's work on that, and let's try to put pressure on Russia. Because the credibility of these efforts we are undertaking today are depending on at least a ceasefire from the beginning of the series of negotiations, from next step on. So I would like to emphasize this aspect and would like to see a ceasefire from the next meeting, which should be a trilateral meeting, wherever it takes place.\"\nMr. Trump did not endorse that approach, and has said throughout the day that a ceasefire isn't necessary to reach an agreement.\n\"Well, we're going to let the president go over and talk to the president, and we'll see how that works out, and if we can do that,\" Mr. Trump said, meaning Putin and Zelenskyy.\nMr. Trump said ceasefires haven't preceded peace talks in other peace deals he's been involved in around the world.\nNATO chief says Trump broke \"deadlock\" on Ukraine war\nAs the leaders took turns addressing the assembled media, Rutte, the NATO secretary general, thanked Mr. Trump for breaking the \"deadlock\" with Putin by starting a dialogue earlier this year, praising the U.S. president for his work to end the war.\n\"If we play this well, we could end this. And we have to end it,\" Rutte said.\nThe NATO chief added that he was \"excited\" by the progress, while urging the leaders to \"get this thing to an end as soon as possible.\"\nZelenskyy calls meeting with Trump a \"very good conversation\"\nZelenskyy called his meeting with Mr. Trump a \"very good conversation,\" as the U.S. president chimed in saying, \"very good.\"\n\"It really was the best one, or, sorry, maybe the best one will be in the future,\" Zelenskyy said. \"But it was really good.\"\nThe Ukrainian president said he and Mr. Trump spoke about \"sensitive points,\" including security guarantees, calling it \"very positive\" that the U.S. is giving \"such strong\" signals on security guarantees. He also noted the importance of a prisoner exchange and the return of abducted children to their families.\n\"All of us want to finish this war, stop Russia and stop this war,\" Zelenskyy said.\nZelenskyy also said Ukraine would be happy if Mr. Trump attended a possible trilateral meeting with Putin.\nTrump says they'll discuss possible exchanges of territories and security guarantees\nMr. Trump said he and European leaders will discuss potential security agreement proposals for Ukraine, as well as the possible \"exchanges\" of territory.\n\"The Alaska summit reinforced my belief that while difficult, peace is within reach,\" Mr. Trump said, alongside the European leaders. \"And I believe that, in a very significant step, President Putin agreed that Russia would accept security guarantees for Ukraine, and this is one of the key points that we need to consider. And we're going to be considering that at the table also, like who will do what, essentially.\"\nThe president said he's \"optimistic\" they can reach a security agreement that will deter any future aggression against Ukraine. Mr. Trump said European nations will take \"a lot\" of the responsibility for ensuring Ukraine's security.\n\"We also need to discuss the possible exchanges of territory taken into consideration,\" Mr. Trump said, calling the current war lines \"sad\" to see.\nMr. Trump said European leaders also need to consider the negotiating positions of Putin, and of Zelenskyy.\n\"Ultimately, this is a decision that can only be made by President Zelenskyy and by the people of Ukraine, working also together and in agreement with President Putin,\" Mr. Trump said.\nTrump kicks off multilateral meeting with Zelenskyy and Europeans\nSeated around a large table in the White House's East Room, Mr. Trump kicked off the multilateral meeting with the world leaders minutes before 3 p.m., hailing a \"successful day\" up to this point.\n\"We've had a very successful day thus far, and important discussions as we work to end the killing and stop the war in Ukraine, we're all working toward the same goal \u2014 very simple goal \u2014 we want to stop the killing, get this settled,\" the president said.\nMr. Trump said he and Zelenskyy \"covered a lot of territory\" during their meeting, reiterating that he would call Putin after the meeting with the leaders.\n\"We're going to try and work out a trilat after that and see if we can get it finished, put this to sleep, because this is, not since the Second World War has there been anything like this,\" he said.\nTrump-Zelenskyy meeting concludes after an hour\nAfter roughly an hour, Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy's meeting has concluded. Mr. Trump, Zelenskyy and European leaders appeared for a \"family photo\" in the White House.\nMr. Trump did not make remarks to reporters, but could be seen talking with Zelenskyy as the leaders all walked out of Cross Hall.\nNext up is the multilateral meeting involving all of the leaders.\nWhat Trump and Zelenskyy's comments revealed about today's talks\nThe two presidents' comments at the top of the meeting laid out what each is hoping to accomplish in today's talks.\nFor Mr. Trump, he said he is pushing for consensus among the U.S., Ukraine and Europe regarding what an eventual peace deal to end the war in Ukraine might look like. He said his end goal is to make enough progress to be able to schedule a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and Putin where a final agreement could be reached.\nWhen it came to specifics, including the crucial issue of security guarantees for Ukraine to prevent another Russian invasion in the future, the president largely avoided taking a definitive position, saying the parties at the White House would work to hash out the details. He acknowledged that the U.S. would \"be involved\" to some degree in ensuring Ukraine's security, along with Europe.\n\"We're going to work with everybody, and we're going to make sure that if there's peace, the peace is going to stay long term. This is very long term. We're not talking about a two year peace and then we end up in this mess again,\" Mr. Trump said.\nZelenskyy said he is pushing for \"everything\" he can get from the U.S. in terms of a security arrangement, and said a \"strong Ukrainian army\" is crucial for ensuring the country's future. \"It's a lot about weapons and then people and training and intelligence,\" he said, as well as \"the big countries\" like the U.S. and \"a lot of our friends.\"\nMr. Trump did not take a position on whether Ukraine would have to cede territory to Russia, an idea that Zelenskyy has rejected in the past.\n\"We're going to have a lasting peace,\" Mr. Trump said in response to a question about territories.\nTrump says he'll call Putin after White House meetings\nMr. Trump said he'll be speaking with Putin today once his meetings with Zelenskyy and European leaders conclude.\n\"I just spoke to President Putin indirectly, and we're going to have a phone call right after these meetings today,\" the president told reporters.\nNext, there \"may or may not\" be a trilateral meeting with the U.S., Ukraine and Russia, he said.\nThe U.S. president said Putin is \"expecting my call when we're finished with this meeting.\"\nAfter saying he'll speak with Putin, the president concluded the Q&A with reporters to begin his meeting with Zelenskyy behind closed doors.\nZelenskyy lays out elements of security guarantees he needs in a peace deal\nZelenskyy, asked what security guarantees he needs from the U.S., responded, \"everything,\" before outlining two aspects of what he is seeking in an eventual peace deal.\nThe Ukrainian president said the picture includes a strong Ukrainian army, along with weapons, intelligence and training missions from allies and partners. He said that should be paired with cooperation from other countries, including the U.S. and \"a lot of our friends.\"\nMr. Trump said the European leaders \"want to give protection,\" adding that \"they feel very strongly about it.\"\n\"And we'll help them out with that,\" Mr. Trump said.\nTrump says \"I don't think you need a ceasefire\"\nMr. Trump said, \"I don't think you need a ceasefire,\" elaborating on the shift in his position following his meeting with Putin.\n\"I know that it might be good to have, but I can also understand, strategically, why one country or the other wouldn't want it,\" he added.\nFriday's meeting in Alaska failed to produce the halt in fighting that the president had previously sought, and the administration has pivoted to seeking a broader peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia. The decision to abandon a ceasefire was at odds with the goals of the U.S. and European allies heading into the Alaska summit, and some analysts say the shift could give Putin more leverage at the negotiating table by ramping up strikes against Ukraine.\n\"I like the concept of a ceasefire for one reason, because you'd stop killing people immediately,\" Mr. Trump said Monday. \"But we can work a deal where we're working on a peace deal while they're fighting.\"\nThe president added that previous deals he has made have happened without a ceasefire.\nTrump compliments Zelenskyy's suit\nZelenskyy, who was criticized by Vance and conservatives in February for not wearing a suit to the White House, is wearing a military-style suit for his meeting with Mr. Trump.\nA reporter who questioned him about his outfit in the last meeting complimented him this time around: \"You look fabulous in that suit.\"\n\"I said the same thing. Isn't that nice? That's the one who attacked you last time. See, now he's a nice guy,\" Mr. Trump told Zelenskyy.\n\"I remember,\" Zelenskyy replied.\n\"But you are in the same suit,\" the Ukrainian leader told the reporter, prompting laughter. \"You see, I changed. You [have] not.\"\nElvira Gasanova, a designer behind the brand that produces Zelenskyy's clothing, told Politico that the outfit reflects both that he is a head of state at war, and an awareness of his environment.\n\"This time the President [Zelenskyy] will be in a suit, but the style still remains in a military key with the same symbolism: he is the Head of State, which is at war,\" Gasanova told Politico.\nTrump: \"The war is going to end\"\nMr. Trump, asked about the root causes of the war, which Putin has previously referenced, declared that \"the war is going to end.\"\n\"When it ends, I can't tell you,\" he added. \"But the war is going to end. And this gentleman wants it to end and Vladimir Putin wants it to end. I think the whole world is tired of it and we're going to get it ended.\"\nThe president touted ending six wars, saying, \"I thought this maybe would be the easiest one and it's not the easiest one. It's a tough one.\"\nTrump says U.S. will \"be involved\" in any security guarantee for Ukraine\nA reporter asked if any security guarantee for Ukraine would involve U.S. troops. Mr. Trump responded that the U.S. Mr. Trump responded that the U.S. would \"be involved.\"\n\"We'll let you know that maybe later today,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"We're meeting with seven great leaders of great countries also. And we'll be talking about that. They'll all be involved. There'll be a lot of, there'll be a lot of help, when it comes to security, there will be a lot of help. It's going to be good. They are a first line of defense because they're there, they're Europe. But we're going to help them out also. We'll be involved.\"\nTrump sees \"reasonable chance\" of ending the war at possible trilateral meeting with Putin\nMr. Trump said \"if everything works out today,\" the leaders would have a trilateral meeting with Putin, saying, \"I think there will be a reasonable chance of ending the war when we do that.\"\nAsked whether Monday's meeting would mark the end of the road on American support for Ukraine, Mr Trump said no, replying that \"it's never the end of the road.\"\n\"People are being killed and we want to stop that, so I would not say it's the end of the road, no,\" Mr. Trump added, acknowledging the deaths last week on both sides of the war.\nMr. Trump pointed blame at the Biden administration, saying \"this isn't my war, this is Joe Biden's war\" when asked whether Russia or Ukraine was in a better negotiating position.\nZelenskyy thanks Trump for his \"personal efforts\" to stop the killing\nZelenskyy offered brief remarks thanking Mr. Trump for his efforts to end the war, as well as first lady Melania Trump's efforts.\n\"Thank you very much for your efforts, personal efforts to stop the killings and stop this war,\" Zelenskyy said.\nZelenskyy also thanked the first lady for a letter she reportedly wrote to Putin, urging him to allow the children of Ukraine to grow up, and grow up in peace.\n\"She sent a letter to Putin about our children,\" Zelenskyy said.\nTrump kicks off bilateral meeting with Zelenskyy\nThe president kicked off his meeting in the Oval Office with Zelenskyy with brief remarks.\n\"It's an honor to have the president of Ukraine with us,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We've had a lot of good discussions, a lot of good talks. And I think progress is being made \u2014 very substantial progress \u2014 in many ways.\"\nThe president said \"there's a possibility\" that something could come out of the meeting with Putin, adding that \"today's meeting is very important.\"\nZelenskyy arrives at White House for meeting with Trump\nZelenskyy's motorcade arrived outside the West Wing of the White House just before 1:15 p.m. Mr. Trump greeted him as he emerged from a black SUV, shaking his hand and escorting him inside.\nAsked by a reporter what his message is to the people of Ukraine, Mr. Trump responded, \"We love them. We love them.\"\nZelenskyy is set to hold a bilateral meeting with Mr. Trump and other U.S. officials in the Oval Office first, before expanded meetings with European leaders later in the afternoon.\nZelenskyy met with European leaders Monday morning\nZelenskyy said in a post on X that he met with several of the European leaders Monday morning to get on the same page before heading to the White House.\n\"Together with the leaders of Finland, the United Kingdom, Italy, the European Commission, and the NATO Secretary General, we coordinated our positions ahead of the meeting with President Trump. Ukraine is ready for a real truce and for establishing a new security architecture. We need peace,\" he wrote, along with a video of him greeting the leaders outside the Ukrainian embassy in Washington.\nEuropean leaders arrive at the White House\nShortly after noon, European leaders began arriving on the South Lawn.\nThe order of arrival was:\n- NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte\n- Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission\n- U.K Prime Minister Keir Starmer\n- Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni\n- Finnish President Alexander Stubb\n- German Chancellor Friedrich Merz\n- French President Emmanuel Macron\nTheir motorcades passed by an honor guard of U.S. servicemembers holding flags along the driveway leading to the South Portico of the White House.\nThe president did not greet the leaders outside. Instead, Monica Crowley, the chief of protocol at the State Department, was on hand to welcome them. A red carpet outlined the path for the leaders from their vehicles into the White House.\nTrump on Ukraine war: \"I'm only here to stop it\"\nIn a post on Truth Social before the leaders arrived, the president took aim at critics who have questioned his approach to ending the war in Ukraine, saying the Wall Street Journal and others \"truly don't have a clue.\"\n\"I'm only here to stop it, not to prosecute it any further,\" he wrote. \"It would have NEVER happened if I was President. I know exactly what I'm doing, and I don't need the advice of people who have been working on all of these conflicts for years, and were never able to do a thing to stop them.\"\nHe continued: \"They are 'STUPID' people, with no common sense, intelligence, or understanding, and they only make the current R/U disaster more difficult to FIX. Despite all of my lightweight and very jealous critics, I'll get it done \u2014 I always do!!!\"\nRussian strikes on Ukraine continue overnight ahead of Trump-Zelenskyy meeting\nRussian attacks on Ukraine continued ahead of the meeting in Washington. An overnight wave of air strikes hit cities around the country, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Sumy, according to local media.\nUkrainian authorities said a drone attack on a residential area in the city of Kharkiv killed a toddler, a 16-year-old and five other people.\n\"Despite all of the diplomacy and peace efforts, Russia continues to kill civilians,\" Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrii Sybiha said in a social media post. \"Russia is a murderous war machine that Ukraine is holding back. And it must be stopped through transatlantic unity and pressure. Moscow must stop the killing in order to advance diplomacy.\"\n\"This was a demonstrative and cynical Russian strike. They are aware that a meeting is taking place today in Washington that will address the end of the war,\" Zelenskyy wrote on social media, adding that dozens more people, including children, had been injured in the attack on Kharkiv.\nThune says Senate \"stands ready\" to provide Trump with \"economic leverage\" in Russia negotiations\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune praised Mr. Trump ahead of the meeting with Zelenskyy in a post on X, saying the president \"should be commended for his dogged determination to bring peace to Ukraine and for his courage to engage with all parties in a way his predecessor refused to do.\"\nThune reiterated that the Senate is ready to provide the White House with \"any economic leverage needed to keep Russia at the table to negotiate a just and lasting peace in Ukraine\" in what appeared to be a nod to the bipartisan effort in Congress to impose new economic sanctions aimed at ramping up pressure on the Kremlin.\nFor months, the Senate has been pushing for the sanctions bill, which was introduced by GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham in April and has 84 cosponors, but Thune has so far deferred to the White House on timing.\nWhat happened the last time Zelenskyy visited the White House\nU.S. allies hope Monday's meeting will go better than Zelenskyy's memorable last visit to the White House in February. That meeting devolved into chaos, finger pointing and insults, prompting Zelenskyy's visit to be cut short.\nDuring the course of an Oval Office meeting, Mr. Trump threatened Zelenskyy to make a deal with Russia or \"we're out,\" while Vance accused the Ukrainian leader of being \"disrespectful.\"\n\"You don't have the cards right now,\" Mr. Trump said in February, as Zelenskyy interjected and disagreed. \"With us, you start having cards. Right now, you don't have your playing cards, your playing cards \u2014 you're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III.\"\n\"Have you said 'thank you' once, this entire meeting? No, in this entire meeting, have you said 'thank you?'\" Vance said to Zelenskyy.\nZelenskyy's voice remained largely measured, while Vance and Mr. Trump raised theirs. Amid the chaos, a reporter asked \u2014 what if Russia violates a ceasefire?\n\"What if anything?\" Mr. Trump responded. \"What if a bomb drops on your head right now? OK?\"\nZelenskyy says Russia \"can only be forced into peace through strength,\" and Trump \"has that strength\"\nToday's meeting at the White House with Ukraine and other European nations is \"the first meeting in such a format, and it is very serious,\" Zelenskyy wrote on X.\nHe thanked Keith Kellogg, the special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, for a meeting before the gathering at the White House, posting a video that showed a warm greeting between the two and their discussions.\n\"We discussed the battlefield situation and our strong diplomatic capabilities \u2014 Ukraine's and all of Europe's together with America,\" Zelenskyy said in his post.\nHe arrived in Washington on Sunday.\nThe Ukrainian president said that Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities continued overnight, and two children were among those killed.\n\"People were simply sleeping when the Russian army launched strikes on the cities,\" Zelenskyy said.\n\"Russia can only be forced into peace through strength, and President Trump has that strength,\" he wrote. \"We have to do everything right to make peace happen. Thank you!\"\nHere are the European leaders accompanying Zelenskyy to Washington\nOn Sunday, a slew of European leaders announced they would be accompanying Zelenskyy on his trip to Washington, including:\n- EU Commissioner Ursula von der Leyen\n- NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte\n- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer\n- German Chancellor Friedrich Merz\n- French President Emannuel Macron\n- Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni\n- Finnish President Alexander Stubb\nMr. Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday morning that \"We have never had so many European Leaders here at one time. A great honor for America!!! Lets see what the results will be???\"\nWhat time is the Trump-Zelenskyy meeting?\nMr. Trump will meet with Zelenskyy in the Oval Office before holding a larger meeting with participating European leaders, with both events partly open to cameras.\nReporters are expected to be ushered into the beginning of Mr. Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy at 1:15 p.m., as well as part of the meeting with European leaders at 3 p.m. Those times are subject to change, as meetings may run long. There is no press conference scheduled with Mr. Trump and any European leaders.\nOther U.S. officials will be in the Oval Office for the meeting with Zelenskyy, including Vice President JD Vance, Rubio, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff and special envoy for Ukraine Keith Kellogg.\nHere's the full schedule, released by the White House:\n- Noon: European leaders arrive\n- 1 p.m.: Mr. Trump greets Zelenskyy\n- 1:15 p.m.: Bilateral meeting between Mr. Trump and Zelenskyy in the Oval Office\n- 2:15 p.m.: Mr. Trump greets European leaders in the State Dining Room\n- 2:30 p.m.: Mr. Trump and European leaders take a \"family photo\"\n- 3 p.m.: Mr. Trump holds a multilateral meeting with European leaders in the East Room\nRubio says Putin meeting resulted in \"enough movement\" for Zelenskyy meeting\nRubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that although there wasn't a \"lot of progress\" in the Alaska summit on Friday, it resulted in \"enough movement\" to justify Monday's talks.\n\"If not, we wouldn't be having Zelenskyy flying all the way over here,\" Rubio said. \"We wouldn't be having all the Europeans coming all the way over here. Now understand, and take with a grain of salt, I'm not saying we're on the verge of a peace deal, but I am saying that we saw movement, enough movement to justify a follow-up meeting with Zelenskyy and the Europeans, enough movement for us to dedicate even more time to this.\"\nOn the possibility of further sanctions on Russia, such as the secondary sanctions Mr. Trump has threatened to impose, Rubio said punishing Russia now would prompt Moscow to disengage.\n\"The moment the president puts those additional sanctions, that's the end of the talks. You've basically locked in at least another year to year and a half of war and death and destruction,\" Rubio said. \"We may unfortunately wind up there, but we don't want to wind up there. We want to wind up with a peace deal that ends this war so Ukraine can go on with the rest of their lives and rebuild their country and be assured that this is never going to happen again.\"\nRubio said \"both sides\" are going to have to make concessions. \"That's how these deals are made, whether we like it or not,\" he told Brennan.\nRead more here.\nPutin agreed to let U.S., Europe offer NATO-style protections for Ukraine, Witkoff says\nPutin agreed at the Alaska summit to allow the U.S. and its European allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee resembling NATO's collective defense mandate as part of an eventual deal to end the 3 1/2-year war in Ukraine, special U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said Sunday.\n\"We were able to win the following concession: That the United States could offer Article 5-like protection, which is one of the real reasons why Ukraine wants to be in NATO,\" he told CNN's \"State of the Union.\" He added that it \"was the first time we had ever heard the Russians agree to that\" and called it \"game-changing.\"\nArticle 5, at the heart of the 32-member military alliance, states that an armed attack against one or more of the members shall be considered an attack against all members.\nWitkoff, who had joined Rubio for the talks at a military base in Alaska, offered few details on how such an agreement would work. But it appeared to be a major shift for Putin and could serve as a workaround to his long-standing objection to Ukraine's potential NATO membership.\nRead more here."

EMMANUEL MACRON:\nI don't see President Putin very willing to get peace now.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPresident Trump presses for an end to the war, but is Moscow listening? Were you enraged when you learned that Russia targeted an American company based in Ukraine?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nI don't like it\u2013\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWas that not a slap \u2013\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nKristen \u2013\nKRISTEN WELKER:\n\u2013 in the face to the peace process \u2013\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\n--I don't like it, Kristen. but this is a war.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI\u2019ll speak exclusively with Vice President JD Vance and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\nPutin is ready to meet with Zelenskyy when the agenda would be ready for a summit, and this agenda is not ready at all.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nPlus retribution raid? The FBI searches the home and office of former Trump National Security Advisor John Bolton in search of classified records. Was it political payback? I\u2019ll talk to Democratic Senator Adam Schiff of California. And map quest lawmakers in Texas and California battle to redraw congressional maps ahead of the midterms.\nGOV. GAVIN NEWSOM:\nWe got here because the president of the United States is struggling.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nJoining me for insight and analysis are NBC News White House Correspondent Monica Alba, Amna Nawaz, co-anchor of PBS Newshour, former Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, and Republican strategist Matt Gorman. Welcome to Sunday. it\u2019s Meet the Press\nANNOUNCER:\nFrom NBC News in Washington, the longest-running show in television history, this is Meet the Press with Kristen Welker.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nGood Sunday morning. This week, President Trump welcomed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and European leaders to the White House in his efforts to negotiate an end to the war. But one week after that high-stakes Alaska summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, no cease fire has been agreed to, no meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin planned, and Russian missiles hit an American-owned factory in Ukraine as the attacks escalate. Back in Washington, the FBI raided the home and office of Mr. Trump\u2019s former National Security Advisor John Bolton searching for classified documents, according to officials. Against this backdrop, I sat down on Friday with Vice President JD Vance at residence and started by asking him about the raid on Ambassador Bolton.\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nWe're in the very early stages of an ongoing investigation into John Bolton. I will say we're going to let that investigation proceed. What I can tell you is that, unlike the Biden DOJ and the Biden FBI, our law enforcement agencies are going to be driven by law and not by politics. And so if we think that Ambassador Bolton has committed a crime, of course, eventually prosecutions will come. But as you know, Kristen, this is all part of gathering evidence, trying to understand something that we're worried about. And, of course, I'll let the FBI comment on the next stage of the investigation.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWhat's at the root of this? Is this about classified documents?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nWell, again, I'll let the FBI speak to that. Classified documents are certainly part of it. But I think that there's a broad concern about, about Ambassador Bolton. They're going to look into it. And like I said, if there's no crime here, we're not going to prosecute it. If there is a crime here, of course, Ambassador Bolton will get his day in court. That's how it should be. But again, our focus here is on did he break the law? Did he commit crimes against the American people? If so, then he deserves to be prosecuted.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAs you know, Ambassador Bolton is a frequent critic \u2014\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nSure.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\n\u2014 of President Trump's. He's also on Kash Patel's enemies list. The administration has already revoked his security clearance, Secret Service protection. Is Ambassador Bolton being targeted because he's a critic of President Trump?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nNo, not at all. And in fact, if we were trying to do that, we would just throw out prosecutions willy-nilly, like the Biden administration DOJ did, prosecutions that later got thrown out in court. If we bring a case, and, of course, we haven't done that yet. The Department of Justice has not done that yet. We are investigating Ambassador Bolton. But if they ultimately bring a case, it will be because they determine that he has broken the law. We're going to be careful about that. We're going to be deliberate about that because we don't think that we should throw people, even if they disagree with us politically, maybe especially if they disagree with us politically, you shouldn't throw people willy-nilly in prison. You should let the law drive these determinations, and that's what we're doing.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, you know, a lot of people have already looked at this and said, \"This looks a lot like retribution.\" Is this retribution?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nWell, who has said it looks a lot like retribution, Kristen? A lot of people who tried to throw Donald Trump in prison for completely fake charges that were later thrown out by multiple different courts. I suspect that if the media and the American people let this case actually unfold, if they let the investigation unfold as it's currently doing, they're going to find out that what we're doing is being very deliberate and being very driven by the national interest, and by the law here. And that's as it should be.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nLet's turn to the war in Ukraine.\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nSure.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI had the opportunity to speak with the Russian foreign minister.\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nI heard.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYes. He says, as of right now, there's no meeting planned between President Putin and President Zelenskyy. And he added, \"There's needs to be an agenda first,\" saying, quote, \"This agenda is not ready at all.\" Are the Russians stringing President Trump along?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nNo, not at all, Kristen. I think the Russians have made significant concessions to President Trump for the first time in three and a half years of this conflict. They've actually been willing to be flexible on some of their core demands. They've talked about what would be necessary to end the war. Of course, they haven't been completely there yet, or the war would be over. But we're engaging in this diplomatic process in good faith. We are trying to negotiate as much as we can with both the Russians and the Ukrainians to find a middle ground to stop the killing. I think what the president has tried to do here is try to engage in very aggressive, very energetic diplomacy because this war is not in anyone's interest. It's not in Europe or the United States's interest. We don't think it's in Russia or Ukraine's interest to keep going. So we're going to keep on pushing for a diplomatic solution. And one final point about this, Kristen. If you look historically, whenever you have a complicated war with a lot of death and destruction, it kind of goes in fits and starts. There are hills and valleys to the negotiation. We sometimes feel like we've made great progress with the Russians, and sometimes, as the president has said, he's been very frustrated with the Russians. And we're going to keep on doing what we have to do to bring this thing to a close. I don't think it's going to happen overnight. I think that we're going to continue to make progress. But, ultimately, whether the killing stops, that determination is going to belong to whether the Russians and Ukrainians can actually find some middle ground here.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, you talk about concessions. And yet, the Russians rejected the ceasefire proposal that President Trump put forward. There's no meeting planned between President Putin and President Zelenskyy. And this week, Russia targeted an American factory in Ukraine. There were 600 people inside at the time. No one was killed. What makes you think President Putin is serious about peace?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nWell, I didn't say they conceded on everything. But what they have conceded is the recognition that Ukraine will have territorial integrity after the war. They've recognized that they're not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. That was, of course, a major demand at the beginning. And importantly, they've acknowledged that there is going to be some security guarantee to the territorial integrity of Ukraine. Again, have they made every concession? Of course, they haven't. Should they have started the war? Of course, they haven't. But we're making progress, Kristen. And what I, I admire about the president in this moment is he's not asking three and a half years ago. He's not, you know, trying to focus on every nitpicky detail of how this thing started three and a half years ago. He's trying to focus on the nitpicky details of now, of what do the parties disagree on? What do they agree on? And how do you build a foundation from one side of that ledger to the other so that you can stop the killing?\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nBut with President Trump, were you enraged when you learned that Russia targeted an American company based in Ukraine?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nI don't like it \u2014\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWas that not a slap \u2014\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nKristen \u2014\nKRISTEN WELKER:\n\u2014 in the face to the peace process \u2014\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\n\u2014 I don't like it, Kristen. But this is a war. And this is why we want to stop the killing. The Russians have done a lot of things that we don't like. A lot of civilians have died. We've condemned that stuff from the get go. And frankly, President Trump has done more to apply pressure and to apply economic leverage to the Russians, certainly than Joe Biden did for three and a half years when he did nothing but talk but do nothing to bring the killing to a stop. So you asked me what I'm enraged by. What I'm enraged by is the continuation of the war. What I'm enraged by is a presidency in Joe Biden who for three years did nothing to end the killing. What I'm actually excited about right now is that we have a president who's engaging in energetic diplomacy to try to stop the killing. That's as it should be. I think the American people should be proud of it. And whatever the outcome of this, whether the war ends in three months or six months or hopefully not beyond, but maybe, we should be proud that we have a president who's trying to stop the killing. He's done it, by the way, six wars, that the president has brought to a close all over the world. This would be the seventh. It's the most complicated, but we're trying despite that.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI had the opportunity to interview Secretary Rubio last week. And he said, he actually doesn't think that new sanctions would force Putin into a ceasefire. Are sanctions now off the table, Mr. Vice President?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nNo, sanctions aren't off the table. But we're going to make these determinations on a case by case basis. What do we think is actually going to exert the right kind of leverage to bring the Russians to the table? Now, you said sanctions were not going to lead to a ceasefire. I think that's obviously correct. If you look at the way the Russians have conducted themselves, they don't want a ceasefire. They don't want a ceasefire for complicated reasons. We, of course, have pushed for a ceasefire. But again, we don't control what Russia does. If we did, the war would've been over seven months ago. What we do believe though is that we continue to have a lot of cards. The president of the United States has a lot of cards left to play to apply pressure to try to bring this conflict to a close, and that's what we're going to do.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou take me to my next question. Where exactly is the pressure on Russia to do anything if you're not right now imposing new sanctions? How do you get them to a place of getting to the table with Zelenskyy and stopping to drop bombs?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nLook Kristen, I think that question betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of where we are. The president has applied aggressive economic leverage. For example, the secondary tariffs on India, to try to make it harder for the Russians to get rich from their oil economy. He's tried to make it clear that Russia can be reinvited into the world economy if they stop the killing, but they're going to continue to be isolated if they don't stop the killing. The president has applied more economic pressure to the Russians to stop this war than Biden did in three years.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou know it\u2019s \u2014\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nSo the idea that we're not doing anything, we're already doing things right now, and this is how negotiation works. You do something, you talk to the parties, you try to see if there's a meeting of minds. Again, we believe we've already seen some significant concessions from both sides just in the last few weeks. We're going to eventually be successful, or we'll hit a brick wall. And if we hit a brick wall, then we're going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage. This is the energetic diplomacy that's going to bring this war to a close.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI hear what you're saying about India. China's actually the largest buyer of Russian oil. Why \u2014\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nThey're close.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\n\u2014 no sanctions on China \u2014\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nThey're about equal.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWhy no sanctions on China?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nWell, obviously, we have a 54% tariff on the PRC right now. So we've already applied pretty hefty sanctions on the Chinese. And we've had a number of conversations at all levels of government to try to encourage the Chinese to be better partners in bringing this war to a close. So again, I think the question betrays a misunderstanding of what's going on. We are applying aggressive economic pressure to bring this war to a close. Maybe we'll apply, apply additional pressure. Maybe if we feel like we're making progress we'll dial that pressure back. That give and take is part of the negotiation that we think is working. It hasn't reached its final outcome yet, but we're going to keep on working on this process for as long as we can.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nJust to boil down what the Russian concessions might look like, is the only thing that President Trump is asking Russia to give up is not to invade all of Ukraine?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nNo, that's not it at all. It's providing the Ukrainians the kind of security guarantees that ensures that country is not going to be invaded again. You know, this is why I think we've made a lot of progress, Kristen. Even though we're not yet there, why we've made a lot of progress is fundamentally the disagreement here is over security guarantees versus where you draw the battle lines in Ukraine. So whether we solve those issues, we've actually identified the two critical issues, one to Ukrainians, one to the Russians. And I think that is where the fruit, if we ultimately solve this thing, that's where the fruit of an agreement will come.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nI want to get security guarantees.\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nSure.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nBut very quickly, if Russia is allowed to keep any of the territory that it illegally seized, what message does that send to China? Does it give China a green light to invade Taiwan? Does it give Russia a green light to invade other European countries, which is what your European allies are concerned about?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nWell, first of all, the Ukrainians are going to ultimately make the determination about where you draw the territorial lines in their own country. But, Kristen, this is how wars ultimately get settled. If you go back to World War II, if you go back to World War I, if you go back to every major conflict in human history, they all end with some kind of negotiation. We're actually not active parties in the negotiation. We're effectively mediating. We're trying to mediate Ukrainians and the Russians to come to some agreement. If Ukrainians are willing to say something on territory that brings the conflict to the close, we're not going to stop them. We're also not going to force them because it's not our country. We're trying to play a constructive role. The president is trying to play a constructive role to bring peace to the region. But he's not going to force these parties to walk through the door. All he can do is open the door and ask them to negotiate in good faith.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou talk about security guarantees.\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nSure.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nForeign Minister Lavrov discussed the importance of Russia being a part of security guarantees. Ukraine says that's a non-starter. Is that a non-starter for the United States as well?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nI think \u2014\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nHow can Russia secure Ukraine when it's dropping bombs on Ukraine \u2014\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nThere's a little bit of a talking past each other here. First of all, we're not talking about security guarantees until after the war has come to a close. And, of course, the Russians are going to be a part of the conversation about bringing that war to a close. So, of course, they're going to have some stake in this. They're going to talk about this. That doesn't mean that they're going to have troops in Ukrainian territory. But how can you reasonably provide security guarantees without talking to the Russians about what would be necessary to bring the war to a close? So I think there's a little bit of people talking past each other. This is going to be a security guarantee provided by a host of nations. I think the Europeans are obviously going to play a big role. We think there are other countries all over the world that might play a big role. The Russians are going to be involved because they're the critical party that's necessary to stop the killing. Again, this is how negotiations happen. It's this give and take. It's a conversation between both sides.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nVery quickly before I move to domestic issues.\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nSure.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nFor Americans who are watching, can you guarantee no U.S. boots on the ground as a part of these security guarantees?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nThe president's been very clear. There are not going to be boots on the ground in Ukraine, but we are going to continue to play an active role in trying to ensure that the Ukrainians have the security guarantees and the confidence they need to stop the war on their end. And the Russians feel like they can bring the war to a conclusion on their end. It's complicated, Kristen, but we're going to keep on trying to play these parties. You know, we're going to keep on trying to convince these parties to talk to each other and continue to play the game of diplomacy because that's the only way to get this thing wrapped up.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAll right. Let's talk about some domestic issues now. This week you were in Georgia.\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nSure.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYou were there to talk about and promote the One Big Beautiful Bill. And it also comes in the same week that Texas Republicans approve five new Republican seats.\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nSure.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nSo they expanded the map for Republicans in their state. If President Trump's agenda is so popular, why do Republicans need to add additional seats to the map?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nWell, first of all, Kristen, you have to ask yourself, \"Why have Democrats gerrymandered their states aggressively over the past ten to 20 years?\" If you look, for example, at the popular vote in a lot of these states, and Massachusetts, where 32% of the residents of Massachusetts voted for Republicans, zero Republican federal representatives. So we're not trying to sort of \u2014 all we're doing, frankly, is trying to make the situation a little bit more fair on a national scale. The Democrats have gerrymandered their states really aggressively. We think there are opportunities to push back against that. And that's really all we're doing.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nSo final question for you \u2014\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nPlease.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\n\u2014 Mr. Vice President. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Elon Musk is halting his plans to create a new political party, in part because he wants to support you for president in 2028. I know you've been asked about this. You said you have not discussed this with him.\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nThat's right.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nBut do you see yourself as the apparent future of the MAGA movement?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nNo. I see myself as a vice president who's trying to do a good job for the American people, Kristen. And if I do a good job, and if the president continues to be successful, as I know that he will be, the politics will take care of itself. We can cross that bridge when we come to it. But we just had an election seven months ago. I think I'm probably like most Americans, and I'm already sick of talking about politics after a big general election. The next election that matters is not the election of 2028. It's 2026. So before we talk about anything three and a half years down the road, let's take a break from politics, focus on governing the country. And when we return to politics, it's going to be to focus on those midterm elections.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nHave you had any conversations with President Trump about him passing the torch onto you?\nVICE PRES. JD VANCE:\nAs you know, the president talks about everything. And if it's in the news, the president and I have certainly discussed it. But I think the president is just focused on doing a good job for the American people. He wants me to be focused on doing a good job for the American people. That's what I'll keep on doing. And again, if we take care of business, if America is safer, if it's more prosperous, if young people could afford to buy a home, if we actually bring peace to all these regions of the world, which we've made great progress in doing, the politics will take care of itself.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWhen we come back, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov joins me exclusively. That's next.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. In an exclusive interview on Friday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov he told me there's currently no meeting planned between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, despite President Trump's push for peace.\nThis week, Russia escalated its attacks in Ukraine. Just this week. Russia bombed an American-owned factory near the Hungarian border. I've spoken to people who, frankly, see that as a slap in the face to President Trump, to the entire peace process. Isn't it?\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\nWell, I would say that those who are sincerely interested in understanding what is going on would know, should know, by now that never, ever Russia deliberately targeted any sites which are not linked to military abilities of Ukraine.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nThis is an electronics factory though, sir. This is an electronics factory. I've spoken to people on the ground there. It builds coffee machines, among other electronics. This is not a military site.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\nWell, I understand that some people are really naive and when they see a coffee machine in the window, they believe that this is the place where coffee machines are produced. Our intelligence has very good information, and we target only \u2013 as I said \u2013 either military enterprises, military sites or industrial enterprises directly involved in producing military equipment for Ukrainian \u2013 for Ukrainian army.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nMr. Foreign Minister, here are the facts: close to 50,000 civilians have either been killed or injured in this war. Russia has hit maternity wards, churches, schools, hospitals, a kindergarten just this past week. So either the Russian military has terrible aim or you are targeting civilians. Which is it?\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\nLook, look, NBC is a very respectful structure, and I hope you are responsible for the words which you broadcast. I ask you to send us or to publicize the information to which you just referred because we never targeted the civilian targets of the kind you cited. You might be mixing, you know, the information because it is a fact that quite a number of churches were purposefully hit by the Ukrainian regime. Quite a number of just civilian settlements, human settlements \u2013\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nBut what about your actions? What about your actions, Mr. Foreign Minister?\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\nLook, we are going by circles. I told you already what we mentioned repeatedly, that we never target civilian \u2013 civilian sites, that we only attack the sites which are directly involved in the Ukrainian military machine which the West is trying to beef, beef up. And if you have any proof of what you just said about churches, kindergarten schools, and so on and so forth, I challenge you.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nSure.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\nMake it public. Make it public with the dates, with the addresses and so on and so forth. As I said, NBC is a very reputed broadcasting agency.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAbsolutely. It\u2019s all publicly \u2013\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\nYour listeners and watchers deserve \u2013\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nMr. Foreign Minister, it's all publicly documented, and we have reporters on the ground who\u2019ve seen it with their own eyes.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\n\u2013 deserve to have specific information when you, when you make such claims.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAll of the information is publicly available. We do have reporters on the ground who've seen these strikes with their own eyes. But I want to ask about what is happening on the ground right now. Attacks against Ukraine have doubled in the time since President Trump took office. If President Putin has \u2014\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\n\u2014 On the ground \u2014\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nIf President Putin has so much regard for President Trump, why is he taking actions that are undermining his push for peace?\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\nPresident Putin has regard for President Trump, respecting President Trump concentration on the interests, national interests of the United States, national interests and well being and historic heritage of the American people. And I don't have any doubt that President Trump respects the same attitude of President Putin to protecting national interests of Russia, to protecting basic interests of the Russian citizens, including the right to be a nation which has very rich history, various traditions and which has the duty, if you wish, to support those who share the values of the Russian language, Russian world if you wish.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nMr. Foreign Minister, let me ask you about something that President Putin said in June. He said, quote, \"I consider the Russian and Ukrainian people to be one nation. In this sense, all of Ukraine is ours.\" Does President Putin believe that Ukraine has a right to exist?\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\nNo, this is, this is not true. Ukraine has the right to exist, provided it must let people go. The people whom they call terrorists, who they call species and who during a referenda \u2013 several referenda in Novorossiya, in Donbas, in Crimea decided that they belong to the Russian culture and the government which came to power as a result of the coup was determined as a priority to exterminate everything Russian \u2014\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nBut as you also know, a number of those people did not want Russia to invade.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\nThis is about \u2014\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nA number of people did not want Russia to invade. Mr. Foreign Minister, do you acknowledge that Russia invaded Ukraine?\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\nWell, democracy is about the people, you know, having a chance to vote. The people voted. The people pronounced themselves. And \u2014\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nDid Russia \u2014\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\n\u2014 when it started in Crimea \u2014\nKRISTEN WELKER:\n\u2014 invade Ukraine, Mr. Foreign Minister? Did Russia invade Ukraine?\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\nRussia started special military operation to defend the people who Zelenskyy and his predecessor did not consider as humans. They called them beings, species. You should look. You should really, I understand that you need something to sell today, but if you are raising and touching up on some serious things, my suggestion is to take a look at the history of Ukrainian development after the coup in 2014.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nBut it's a yes \u2014\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\nWe have some material \u2014\nKRISTEN WELKER:\n\u2014 Yes or no question. It's a yes or no question, Mr. Foreign Minister. Do you acknowledge Russia invaded Ukraine?\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\nI said to you that we started special military operations there \u2014\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nSo, yes.\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\n\u2014 to protect, to protect the people whom the regime declared terrorists and enemies and whom the regime was bombing.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nMr. Foreign Minister, final question. Does Russia, does President Putin, want peace?\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\nYes.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd what say you to U.S. lawmakers here who believe you are stringing along President Trump? Are you?\nFOREIGN MINISTER SERGEY LAVROV:\nIt is not for the lawmakers or for any media outlet to, to decide, you know, what President Trump is motivated by. We respect President Trump because President Trump defends American national interests. And I have reason to believe that President Trump respects President Putin because he defends Russian national interests. And whatever they discuss between themselves is not a secret. We want peace in Ukraine. He wants, President Trump wants, peace in Ukraine. The reaction to Anchorage meeting, the gathering in Washington of these European representatives and what they were doing after Washington indicates that they don't want peace.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nForeign Minister Lavrov also told me quote \"security guarantees must be subject to consensus\". You can watch my full interview with Foreign Minister Lavrov online. And when we come back, Democratic Senator Adam Schiff of California joins me next.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. And joining me now is Democratic Senator Adam Schiff of California. Senator Schiff, welcome back to Meet the Press.\nSEN. ADAM SCHIFF:\nGreat to be with you.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nIt's wonderful to have you here on a big Sunday. You just heard my interviews with Vice President JD Vance with the Russian foreign minister. Senator, what do you make of where this peace process stands? Do you believe it is stalled? Or do you think it's moving forward, albeit slowly?\nSEN. ADAM SCHIFF:\nI think it's stalled. And I was most interested in your question to him: \u201cWas Russia essentially stringing along, was Putin stringing along the president of the United States?\u201d Now, Lavrov is such a practiced liar, he's been doing this for decades. He seemed to have trouble with that question. He didn't answer that question directly. I was also surprised, frankly, that Russia would go and bomb a U.S. electronics factory. That's so in-your-face to the president, President Trump. That seems unnecessarily provocative. But they're clearly stringing the president along. And, you know, I think at some, we have to start, what's our national security interest? Our national security interest is seeing a strong, sovereign, independent, democratic Ukraine. And measured against that, the summit I think was a failure. It didn't advance our interests or Ukraine's interests or that of our allies. Putin walked away with essentially no ceasefire, despite the president's demand for it. He walked away after being on the stage on U.S. soil with the U.S. president, literally the red carpet rolled out for him. He walked away out from under the threat of sanctions from the United States. Trump had promised to impose sanctions. So they strung him along successfully. And I think the president, for his part, was correct when he said, \"Ukraine can't win a war if it can't go on offense.\" But it is the president and the administration that is preventing Ukraine from going on offense, by preventing Ukraine from using weapons to attack Russia on Russian soil. So I think it was a real setback for us. Lavrov, no surprises in his statements except perhaps in his inability to directly refute the idea that they're stringing along the president.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, something we'll obviously continue to watch really closely. I do want to ask you about one of the top domestic issues this week. The FBI search of former national security advisor and Ambassador John Bolton's home and office. I did have the opportunity to ask the vice president about this. He rejects the idea that this is political retribution. Do you believe that people need to let this investigation play out and not get ahead of it at this point?\nSEN. ADAM SCHIFF:\nI think this is clearly retribution. I mean, the idea that, what, they just picked John Bolton, a prominent critic of the president, at random. What the president is trying to do here is very systemic and systematic, and that is, anyone who stands up to the president, anyone who criticizes the president, anyone who says anything adverse to the president's interests gets the full weight of the federal government brought down on them. So if you're John Bolton, you get your home seized. If you're on the Federal Reserve and you won't lower interest rates, you get threatened with prosecution or with firing. If you're a general like the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and you issue a report or your agency does casting doubt on the success of U.S. military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, you get fired. If you are the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics and you give a jobs report that the president doesn't like, you get fired. They're essentially going after any critic, any opposition in an effort to intimidate them. That's what this is about. It's not, it\u2019s not about Bolton per se. It's about anyone else that, like Bolton, might stand up to the president.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, you have been a critic of the president. And the administration is targeting you of what they allege is mortgage fraud. I want to read a little bit of what President Trump posted on social media. He writes, quote, \"Adam Schiff has engaged in a sustained pattern of possible mortgage fraud. Adam Schiff said that his primary residence was in Maryland to get a cheaper mortgage and rip off America when he must live in California because he was a congressman from California.\" Now the government mortgage company, Fannie Mae, says you're, quote, \"engaged in a sustained pattern of possible occupancy misrepresentation on several loans.\" Are these allegations true? How do you respond to them?\nSEN. ADAM SCHIFF:\nThey're patently false. And the president knows it. And the housing agency president's person Pulte knows it. He's essentially doing the president's bidding against me, against Letitia James, against this person on the Federal Reserve. Mortgage is their new weapon to go after their critics. But I've been very open about my residency both in California and in Maryland with my constituents and with the lenders. So there's no \"there\" there. But the common denominator is they will manufacture anything to go after their critics, after members of Congress to try to silence them, after John Bolton, after people in the Federal Reserve, after generals, after former presidents. They're investigating Comey and Clapper, the Obamas, the Clintons. Basically, it's free rein with a corrupt leadership at the Justice Department.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd just very quickly, will you cooperate with the investigation?\nSEN. ADAM SCHIFF:\nOh, we have. And we've refuted their allegations. In fact, we put it in writing. But it doesn't matter. What matters to them is the intimidation campaign. And they're going to mount it against anyone who stands up to the president. But I'm not backing down. And I have to hope that others will stand up to this increasing authoritarian form of government.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nA couple more and just a few minutes left. I want to talk to you about the Epstein files. The Justice Department this week releasing more than 300 pages of interview transcripts with Ghislaine Maxwell. Of course, she's serving a 20-year sentence for her role in Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking. She said in the interview she never witnessed President Trump act inappropriately and that Epstein actually did not have a client list that she's aware of. Did the release satisfy any of the outstanding questions that you have about this matter?\nSEN. ADAM SCHIFF:\nOh, I don't think it'll satisfy anyone. They go and they do this interview without the presence of a prosecutor who actually knows the facts because they fired her, James Comey's daughter. So they go in there, the number two person at the Justice Department, not knowing any of the facts, not having a lawyer present to represent the victims of this child sex trafficking.The sex \u2013 convicted sex trafficker, Ghislaine Maxwell, goes into this interview undoubtedly told by her attorney, \"Unless you completely exonerate the president, you're going to spend most of the rest of your life in prison.\" So she wants a pardon. She says exactly what her lawyers tell her is going to be necessary to get a pardon. No one should be surprised here. And she's immediately moved to a more, less secure prison which is not for convicted child sex traffickers. It all stinks to high heaven. And there's a common denominator here too which is the president going after his enemies to distract from their failure to do the one thing they promised to the Justice Department, and that is release the Epstein files.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nVery quickly, final question. This week Texas Republicans redrew their map. They added five additional Republican seats. The governor of California, Gavin Newsom, says it's time to fight fire with fire. He is moving to add five additional Democratic seats. You, Senator, have been very outspoken against tearing down Democratic norms. Does this tit-for-tat over redistricting run the risk of undercutting Democrats' credibility in the eyes of voters?\nSEN. ADAM SCHIFF:\nDemocrats offered the legislation in the last session to eliminate the gerrymander in every state. We supported, I think, to a person. Republicans, I think, almost to a person, maybe to a person, opposed that. It's very clear what party wants to do away with gerrymandering. But it was interesting to me when you asked JD Vance, \"Hey, if your agenda's so popular, why are you trying to gerrymander Texas, a state that is already gerrymandered to elect Republicans?\" And he didn't try to defend the president's agenda. The president is deeply unpopular, one of the most unpopular presidents in history. His agenda is unpopular. The big, ugly bill that is cutting health care for millions to fund tax cut \u2013 tax cuts for rich people is historically unpopular. So ,of course, the only way they feel they can survive the midterms is by redrawing the lines in Texas. California is not going to stand for this. We will fight fire with fire. Don't poke the bear. And, and it's going to be necessary. But I hope what will come out, out of the end of all of this, is where we should have begun and that was with the Democratic bill to end the gerrymander in every state.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAll right we covered a lot of ground today. Senator Adam Schiff, thank you so much for being here. We really appreciate it.\nSEN. ADAM SCHIFF:\nThank you.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd still ahead, the panel is here. But first, it was one of the deadliest and most destructive storms in U.S. history, 20 years ago this week. Our Meet the Press Minute is next.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. This week will mark 20 years since Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, claiming nearly 2,000 lives, causing more than $100 billion in damage, and leaving much of New Orleans under water, its people without power, food or shelter. Aaron Broussard, the president of Jefferson Parish, joined Meet the Press in the aftermath, pleading for more action from the federal government.\n[BEGIN TAPE]\nAARON BROUSSARD:\nThe guy who runs this building I'm in, emergency management, he's responsible for everything. His mother was trapped in St. Bernard Nursing Home. And every day, she called him and said, \"Are you coming, son? Is somebody coming?\" And he said, \"Yeah, mama. Somebody's coming to get you. Somebody's coming to get you on Tuesday. Somebody's coming to get you on Wednesday. Somebody's coming to get you on Thursday. Somebody's coming to get you on Friday.\" And she drowned Friday night. She drowned Friday night.\nTIM RUSSERT:\nMr. President \u2014\nAARON BROUSSARD:\nNobody's coming to get her. Nobody's coming to get her. For the second time, he's promised. Everybody's promised. They've had press conferences. I'm sick of the press conferences. For God's sake, shut up and send us somebody.\n[END TAPE]\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWelcome back. The panel is here. Monica Alba, NBC News White House correspondent; co-anchor of PBS News Hour Amna Nawaz; Republican strategist Matt Gorman; and Heidi Heitkamp, former Democratic senator from North Dakota. Thank you all for being here. Monica, I want to start with you. You were on the ground in Alaska for that summit between President Trump and President Putin. You heard the conversations with Lavrov and with the vice president. Based on your reporting and your sources, where do you think this process stands right now?\nMONICA ALBA:\nWell look, Kristen, remember, candidate Donald Trump promised to solve this conflict basically within hours of taking office. This week has shown why that has proven to be so difficult. And that's a point that he concedes and that White House officials are conceding now as well. The complexities of these questions of security guarantees, of territory, all of that, that is why you now have the White House taking a little bit of a step back, shifting their language, shifting their tone a little bit to say, \"We're still working furiously on this behind the scenes.\" But publicly they're saying, \"This is up to Ukraine and Russia, and the U.S. will only have a role if they are able to iron out those incredibly complex issues.\" And that's now why you also have the president laying out a two-week promise. We've heard that many times. Those time frames come and go without action sometimes. But he's saying maybe there will be these severe consequences that we haven't seen yet, maybe sanctions, maybe tariffs. And so one thing to watch this week, and soon when the Senate returns, will they take up that package? Though, there is a real question of whether those sanctions would even have an impact or be efficient in getting Russia to make some of those concessions that, frankly, they haven't. But the White House says they're not giving up. They're still trying to work on this. And that burst of momentum you saw in Alaska and with the European leaders at the White House is now showing its risk, because then when you have a pause, an impasse like the one now, it's clear after all that activity.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAmna, it's a great point. And the question of sanctions, Secretary Rubio said to me, \"I don't even think sanctions would work to get Russia to engage in a ceasefire.\" You've interviewed Zelenskyy multiple times. You've been on the ground in Ukraine. There was so much skepticism about this peace process heading in. And then as Monica notes, we are seeing this shift in tone from the White House.\nAMNA NAWAZ:\nAnd I think that skepticism remains. I want to point out that was a lot of maybes from the White House, as Monica's reporting has showed, in terms of what happens next. I thought you were so right to necessarily call out the misinformation being pushed by the foreign minister there on the fact that Ukraine started the war, as they claim, and also that civilians are not being targeted on the ground. Your reporting shows that. I have seen that. As Monica laid out, this burst of momentum, the Alaska summit, Zelenskyy and the EU leaders coming to the White House, NATO military chiefs meeting together, there's a lot of talk. The question is whether those are signals leading to something or whether they are noise, continuing to allow Russia to stall. Time benefits Putin right now. When I spoke to a former national security senior defense official who worked on NATO policy, he said the role for the U.S. to play here is critical, either as a backstop to any European security guarantees or in providing the kind of things Europeans can't, transportation, intelligence, satellite communications. What we've seen from the White House is a move from President Trump saying, \"We're going to provide very good protection to more careful, mediated language now.\" We also know that three and a half years into this war now, the U.S. and others can provide a process, but they can't set the pace for that process.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nAnd Matt, for as dynamic as this situation is, the push for peace by President Trump, boy, we had a lot of headlines this week on the domestic front. That raid of former ambassador John Bolton's home and office. You heard the vice president defend it and say, \"This is not retribution.\" Senator Adam Schiff has a very different take. Do you think this could potentially backfire against the president, against his allies? How do you see it? What are you hearing?\nMATT GORMAN:\nWell, look, it's an important point that this started \u2013 this whole investigation started under the Biden administration, which I think you can't get lost on that. And look, as the left has said to us over the course of many years, \"No one is above the law.\" I think at the end of the day, the allegations are far more reminiscent of about 20 years ago, the former Clinton official Sandy Berger when he had that issue with classified documents. We'll find out how this plays out. But my bigger takeaway from all of this is if I'm Adam Schiff, if I'm Tish James, I'd be very worried right now. The Trump administration has been quiet on the Bolton front before this, but they've been very vocal about wanting to hold them to account when it comes to alleged mortgage fraud on that. And I think that's likely going to come down the pike sooner rather than later. That's my larger takeaway from this.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nSenator Heitkamp, the fact that Matt points to the idea that this list might continue to grow, and this comes against the backdrop of the administration dispatching National Guard troops to D.C., the fight over gerrymandering. We're obviously entering the midterms. What should Democrats be focused on? Should it be the issue of these investigations or should it be pocketbook issues? All of the above?\nFMR. SEN. HEIDI HEITKAMP:\nIt should be nothing that is beltway.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nOkay.\nFMR. SEN. HEIDI HEITKAMP:\nWhat you're seeing right now is consumer sentiment as low as it was in the Biden administration. You're seeing record increases in insurance rates and health insurance is going to hit like a ton of bricks at the end of the year. You are seeing food prices not coming down. And in the first Trump administration, the lower half or the lower quartile saw their wages increase dramatically. That's inverted now. Richer people are getting richer. Poor people are having a harder time catching up. The Democrats have to lay the groundwork for an economic argument that they can do better because people out there are suffering, and that is getting ignored. The Trump administration isn't doing this. He's the master of changing the subject. I always said he's great at Crazy Eights. If you're losing playing hearts, change it to clubs. And that's what he's doing with a lot of the law and order stuff, with the Bolton stuff. Diversion, diversion, diversion. And Democrats have to stay razor-focused on the bread-and-butter and macaroni-and-cheese issues, not just the macro, the macro issues.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, and Monica, to that point, I think a lot of Republicans are wondering if the White House is going to stay laser-focused on trying to sell the Big, Beautiful Bill. You had the vice president out in Georgia, as I referenced with him, there is so much that's being thrown out there right now. What is the strategy moving forward?\nMONICA ALBA:\nWell, one example is the sort of rebranding of the One, Big Beautiful Bill, that they are now trying to message as the working family tax cut. Trying to put an emphasis on no tax on tips, no tax on overtime with limitations and up to a certain point and trying to really define it before some of the benefits, as Republicans would say, \u201ckick in.\u201d But before a lot of the issues with the Medicaid cuts also kick in, which of course Democrats and critics are really going to focus on.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nDo you think Democrats will focus on in, Amna? Because to Heidi's point, there is the risk of getting distracted by all of these other issues.\nAMNA NAWAZ:\nI really want to hear what Heidi has to say about this, whether they will or not. The economy is the single largest voting issue for all Americans, regardless of what else is swirling and regardless of what else the president promises and our reporting to follow up on our accountability of it. But on the economy, it's resilient. There's a good story for them to be telling there. You're going to see the first rate cut in a long time likely in September. But the reason a former Fed governor told me we may not see more ahead is because of all the uncertainty, the tariffs and their long-term impacts, some of these policies and their long-term impact. There's reasons to be concerned. Consumer confidence is down. It's always the economy.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nWell, you were name-checked. We saw the stock market soar after that indication that the Fed might cut rates.\nFMR. SEN. HEIDI HEITKAMP:\nThe stock market is not the economy. And you need to look at how consumers are feeling, how voters are feeling, you know, especially independent voters. And right now, they don't feel safe. They don\u2019t feel secure economically. And they are deeply concerned about what's going to happen going forward with tariffs, what's going forward. And on the Big, Beautiful Bill, the biggest problem the Republicans have is the cost was actually a continuation of existing policy. So people aren\u2019t going to see, the vast majority of Americans are not going to see a big refund at the end of the year saying, \"Wahoo, Trump did great things for me.\" And at the same time, you're seeing record defaults in credit cards. You're seeing record defaults in car loans. This is not a good economy for average people.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nMatt, ten seconds left.\nMATT GORMAN:\nI'm watching the crime and law and order issue. It seems like Democrats are falling into that same trap they did on the economy and immigration under Biden, telling them things are better even though people don't feel it.\nKRISTEN WELKER:\nYeah, President Trump clearly thinks it's a winning issue for him. Thank you for a great conversation. That is all for today. Thank you so much for watching. We'll be back next week, because if it's Sunday, it's Meet the Press."

U.S. Vice President JD\u202fVance and President Trump highlighted diplomatic progress, citing Russian concessions and a prisoner exchange, while European leaders pledged security guarantees and military aid. Despite these talks, Russia denied a ceasefire and continued strikes, and the U.S. faced domestic controversy over an FBI raid on former National Security Advisor John\u202fBolton\u2019s home. The week also saw Canada, Norway, and the Vatican extend support, and Pope Leo\u202fXIV pray for peace in Ukraine.",
