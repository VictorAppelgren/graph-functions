  "title": "Aaron Boone Makes Puzzling Claim About Yankees Offense Amid Firing Rumors",
  "description": "The New York Yankees entered Friday seven games below .500 since the start of June. Despite offensive struggles, Aaron Boone made a bold statement.",
  "content": "Based on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nThe New York Yankees have not played great baseball since the start of June, and their offense has struggled greatly.\n\nThe Yankees' offense ranks in the bottom five in runs scored this month. In June, they were in the bottom half of the league in runs scored. Their offense found some success in July, but their team still finished the month below .500.\n\nDespite the woes at the plate, Aaron Boone downplayed the problem before Monday's game.\n\n\"I think, frankly, the offense is probably the least of our concerns,\" Boone said in a clip posted by SNY on X. \"You're going to have stretches. I mean, that's the nature of offense. You're going to have little pockets where you struggle a little bit. We got a couple of guys struggling right now, but I think we have a handful of guys swinging the bats well.\"\n\nThroughout the Yankees' slump, Boone, at least publicly, has kept an optimistic tone. However, it's hard to look at the Yankees' offense in the first couple of months of the season versus since the start of June and not have reason to be concerned.\n\nAmid the Yankees' slump, Boone's leadership, managing style and willingness to be stern with players have all been questioned. Rumors and speculation about the Yankees potentially firing him have increased, and his downplaying of offensive struggles is not going to help his case.\n\nHowever, in reality, rumors are nothing more than just that. There have been no indications from the organization that the team is looking for a change. Boone is under contract through 2027.",

      "text": "\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\nThe New York Mets entered Monday having lost seven straight games and 11 of their last 12 games.\nThe team is clearly not living up to expectations right now, and the Philadelphia Phillies are starting to pull away in the National League East. Carlos Mendoza pointed at the starting rotation as one of the keys to getting back on track.\n\"We gotta get our starters going,\" Mendoza said, per The Athletic's Will Sammon.\nThe Mets' starting rotation playing better will have a positive effect on the entire team. The offense will not have to be perfect and the bullpen will be less taxed. However, the Mets will need their offense to play better at some point as well.\nThe rotation has dealt with some injuries, but the starters are going to have to start going deeper in games at some point. Against the Milwaukee Brewers, no starter completed five innings. Frankie Montas did not have a traditional start, but pitched three innings behind an opener.\nThe Mets will play two series against the Atlanta Braves, a series against the Washington Nationals and a series against the Seattle Mariners before they take on the Phillies in a critical series.\nThe Phillies entered Friday with a 5 1/2-game lead over the Mets, but Mendoza thinks the team does not need to be worried about the standings right now.\n\"We haven't played well in quite a bit now,\" Mendoza said, per Sammon. \"That's what happens. We can't be looking at the standings. We gotta start getting the job done. It's that simple.\"\nThe clock is ticking on the Mets' season, and they will need to start playing better if they want to make a deep run in October.\nMore MLB: Yankees Roster Shake-Up?
