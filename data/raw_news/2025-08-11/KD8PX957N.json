  "description": "If you're a sports fan, this new ESPN and Fox streaming bundle might be music to your ears.",
  "content": "Disney recently announced that its highly anticipated ESPN streaming service will launch on August 21, the same day Fox is also launching its new streaming service, Fox One.\n\nNow, Disney and Fox have announced an agreement to launch a new streaming bundle that includes both ESPN and Fox One for $40 a month, starting October 2. For sports fans, this bundle offers access to a wide variety of live sports content, including games from the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and many other leagues.\n\n\"Working with FOX One on this bundle offer allows us to bring ESPN's world-class sports content to even more fans in a seamless and innovative way,\" said Sean Breen, EVP of Disney Platform Distribution, in a press release. \"This collaboration reflects our shared commitment to delivering premium experiences across platforms and meeting consumers where they are -- anytime, anywhere.\"\n\nDisney's new ESPN streaming service will cost $30 a month, while Fox One will be priced at $20 a month. If you buy both separately, it would total $50 a month, so this $40 bundle deal saves you $10 a month.\n\nDisney's new ESPN streaming service differs from ESPN+ in that it offers all of ESPN's lineup of linear live TV channels, such as ESPN, ESPN2, and ESPNews. The Fox Corporation's new Fox One streaming service is similar, in that it offers subscribers access to its news and sports linear TV channels, such as Fox News, Fox Sports, FS1, and FS2.\n\nIn a press release, Fox said this bundle will give viewers access to \"an incredible portfolio of content\" like the \"NFL, NBA, WNBA, MLB, NHL, College Football and Basketball, NASCAR, INDYCAR, UFC, as well as the upcoming FIFA World Cup.\"\n\nIf you're an avid sports fan and want to become a cord-cutter, this new streaming bundle from ESPN and Fox could be an efficient way to do it, and a viable alternative to YouTube TV, which now costs $83 a month. However, both services launch on August 21, and the bundle doesn't become available until October 2, so you'll have to wait over a month to start saving on both. In addition to announcing the launch date of its new ESPN streaming service, Disney also revealed plans to scrap its standalone Hulu app and merge it completely with Disney+.",

      "text": "Summary\n- Most people should choose YouTube TV's default package or the Spanish Plan.\n- It may be worth paying for Entertainment Plus or the NFL Sunday Ticket bundle, depending on your tastes.\n- Options like 4K Plus and NFL RedZone are tougher to justify.\nWhile YouTube TV is easily one of the best-known live TV streaming service -- if you're in the US, that is -- it's also potentially confusing, not to mention expensive. On top of an $83 per month base package, there are numerous add-ons, some of which you might consider essential for your viewing habits. In some Spanish-speaking households, for instance, the practical cost could be closer to $100.\nBefore you plunk down any cash for a new YouTube TV subscription, or upgrade the one you have, here's what you need to know about the various packages Google offers, excluding individual channels. You could end up deciding that on-demand streaming is more financially viable.\nYouTube TV\n- Simultaneous streams\n- 3\n- # of profiles\n- 6\n- Live TV\n- Yes\n- Price\n- Starts at $83 /month\n- Free trial\n- Yes, length varies\nThe default YouTube TV package\nMore than enough for some people\nTo Google's credit, YouTube TV's $83 core subscription does offer a lot. The base package includes six user profiles, unlimited cloud DVR recording and playback, and up to three simultaneous streams per household. Most importantly, there are over 100 channels. That makes it impractical to list them all, but here are some highlights:\n- ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox, plus their news and sports channels\n- BBC, CNN, and other 24-hour news networks\n- Cartoon Network and Comedy Central, including a dedicated Adult Swim channel\n- ESPN channels, including college spin-offs\n- PBS and PBS Kids\n- Disney and Nickelodeon channels\n- AMC, Discovery, FX, TBS, Turner Classic Movies, USA Network, and other cable standards\n- NBA TV and NFL Network\n- Univision, Telemundo, and UniM\u00e1s for Spanish-language viewers\nThe major gaps here are in movies and Spanish channels. That's because many \"premium\" channels are missing, such as HBO, along with more specialized Spanish networks.\nDepending on your favorite sports, you may also be missing live coverage of some games.\nYouTube TV + NFL Sunday Ticket\nA bundle for football fanatics\nIf the main reason you want live TV at all is football (in the American sense), you can get the base package bundled with NFL Sunday Ticket. That adds an extra $378 per year, spread over four monthly payments, but the advantage is that you can almost always watch NFL games live, whether through Sunday Ticket or YouTube's default channels.\nI say \"most\" because while the bundle covers both locally- and nationally-televised games, Sunday Ticket is limited to out-of-market match-ups, and digital-only games are completely excluded. There's still a chance that you'll miss some events, probably anything that's blacked out locally to force stadium attendance.\n4K Plus\nFor travelers and cinephiles\nIt might shock a few people, but the base package doesn't include 4K content of any kind -- you'll be watching in 1080p resolution at best. Paying $10 per month upgrades some content to 4K, but not all of it, since some channels don't broadcast in that resolution anyway.\nIn fact, the main reason to pay for 4K Plus is probably offline DVR viewing. Without it, you can only view recordings when you have internet access, which is obviously a problem if you're trying to catch up with a show mid-flight, or otherwise away from civilization. The only other benefit of the package is unlimited simultaneous streams in your home, which is unnecessary unless you've got a large family of certified TV addicts.\nEntertainment Plus\nFor movies and prestige shows\nThis is the one add-on I'd consider myself. Why? It includes Max, Starz, and Paramount+ (with Showtime) for $30 per month. It's not cheap, but you'll pay as much or more for those services separately.\nMax is home to a lot of Warner-distributed movies, as well as prestige shows from HBO, like The Righteous Gemstones, and House of the Dragon. Paramount+ is probably best known for Yellowstone and South Park, but combined with Showtime it includes other content that's hard or impossible to find streaming elsewhere, such as Twin Peaks: The Return.\nStarz does have original shows, but it's probably best used as a way of filling in gaps in your movie library. As of this writing, for instance, you can watch titles like Jurassic Park and Spider-Man: No Way Home.\nNFL RedZone with Sports Plus\nFor very particular diehards\nIf you're not willing to pay for NFL Sunday Ticket, this package focuses on RedZone only at a price of $11 per month. The channel provides coverage of every Sunday NFL game, with the catch that you're getting \"whip around\" coverage of what's airing on CBS and Fox. It can be redundant with those networks, in other words, and if you're only interested in a specific game, you may miss some of it. Indeed, when there's only one game left to go for the day, expect RedZone to cut to highlights to encourage people to switch to CBS, Fox, or Sunday Ticket.\nThe Sports Plus part of the package includes these channels:\n- beIN Sports/beIN Sports XTRA\n- Billiard TV\n- FanDuel TV\n- Fight Network\n- FOX Soccer Plus\n- Impact Wrestling\n- MAVTV Motorsports\n- Outside\n- Overtime\n- PlayersTV\n- PokerGO+\n- SportsGrid\n- Stadium\n- Tennis Channel\n- VSiN\nThe Spanish Plan and Spanish Plus\nCut to the chase\nThe Spanish Plus add-on includes over 25 additional Spanish channels for $15 per month, focusing on content like telenovelas and soccer. Google is oddly reluctant to list every channel, but a couple of examples are the Spanish versions of ESPN and Fox Sports.\nIf your household doesn't care about English TV at all, Google sells an alternate base package called the Spanish Plan. This is just $35 per month instead of $83, but limited to Spanish Plus content as well as Univision, Telemundo, and UniM\u00e1s.\nWhich packages are worth paying for?\nDon't get boxed in by FOMO\nMost people should stick with the default package. $83 per month is already pretty expensive as streaming goes, and you'll get plenty of TV content spanning news, comedy, drama, education, and sports. For movies and \"prestige\" shows, it's probably best to combine YouTube TV with on-demand services like Max and Netflix instead, so you're only paying for what you care about. Spanish speakers can cut costs dramatically by choosing the $35 Spanish Plan.\nMost people should stick with the default base package or the Spanish Plan.\nIt may be worth paying for Entertainment Plus if you're already interested in Max, Paramount+, and Showtime, since you can merge all of those services into one place. Likewise, hardcore football fans may want the NFL Sunday Ticket bundle, since Sunday Ticket can be even more expensive elsewhere.\nThe packages that are hardest to justify are 4K Plus, Spanish Plus, and NFL RedZone with Sports Plus. You may want 4K Plus for offline caching, but for maximum quality, you'll get more reliable 4K HDR support (as well as Dolby Atmos) from on-demand services. Spanish Plus is probably overkill unless someone in your home is fully bilingual, and RedZone/Sports Plus may be too niche, or redundant with Sunday Ticket. As a rule, you should leave these add-ons by the wayside."

      "text": "Summary\n- Hulu Originals will shine more now with the merger into Disney+, boosting their profile.\n- Hulu will have more accessibility as its content reaches a larger audience through Disney+.\n- Some people now have more of a reason to get Disney+ to watch Hulu content, broadening their options.\nIt was announced in 2019 that Disney was acquiring majority control of Hulu after it acquired 21st Century Fox. After that happened, Disney offered bundles of its services together (along with ESPN or HBO Max) to give consumers a main stop for a lot of their streaming needs. In June of this year, Disney completed the acquisition of Hulu from Comcast, allowing the conglomerate full use of Hulu's name and catalog.\nDuring its earnings announcement this week, Disney made a number of big changes, including announcing the debut of its new ESPN streaming service and its acquisition of NFL Network. Another notable highlight from the earnings call was that Hulu's native app would be put to pasture by 2026. This means that all of Hulu's content will be folded into the Disney+ app and that users won't have to juggle two subscriptions.\nThis may seem like Disney is putting an end to Hulu. But that's far from the truth. This is actually the best thing that could happen to Hulu to have its content become more appreciated. This is something that has been rumored since the 2019 acquisition, but seven years of changes since confirm that Hulu is moving in the right direction.\n- number of users\n- 2-4\n- Subscription with ads\n- $9.99/month\n- Premium Subscription\n- $15.99/month\n- # of profiles\n- 6+\n- Originals\n- Yes\n- Live TV\n- No\nHulu Originals will shine more now\nYou'll pay more attention to Hulu shows\nIt currently costs $10.99 per month for the bundle of Disney+ and Hulu and $16.99 per month for the trio of Disney+, Hulu, and HBO Max.\nHulu is currently an app that features Live TV (if you pay for it), a large list of movies, and a large list of streaming shows on demand, such as ones that air on ABC or FOX and can be streamed on the app. If you want to watch Abbott Elementary or Family Guy, but don't have a cable subscription, Hulu and HBO Max are where you can watch them. Hulu also features FX on Hulu series and is the premiere place where FX shows air along with FX on Hulu series, which are series that are from FX but first air on streaming (it's hard to keep track of all this, right?)\nThe most well-known Hulu Original series is The Bear, the Emmy Award-winning smash hit by Christopher Storer that many people are likely to subscribe to Hulu strictly for. But it isn't the only Hulu Original by any means and Hulu also has original films that are lesser known. Hulu has become a bit of a landing ground for smaller horror films and TV series. Some Hulu Originals and FX on Hulu series have made bigger splashes like The Handmaid's Tale, Paradise, Shogun, American Horror Stories, The Dropout, and Only Murders in the Building. But plenty of others don't get as much promotion or much hype ahead of their releases. Examples include The Binge, Run, Plan B, Rosaline, The Drop, Reasonable Doubt, Deli Boys, and Mid-Century Modern.\nThat could change now that Hulu is folding into Disney+. The dedicated portion of the app that is now going to be Hulu's and Hulu's alone, meaning it won't be littered with streaming on-demand content anymore. You don't have to go to Hulu just to watch American Idol anymore. You're going to go there for Hulu shows and movies, boosting the profile of everything the originals have to offer. Producers and those making Hulu series and movies that are yet to come should be excited that their productions are going to have more promotion than they might have just being stashed on Hulu's app.\nHulu will have more accessibility\nDisney+ is paid for by a lot more people\nDuring the first quarter of 2025, Disney reported that Hulu had 53.6M paying subscribers, which had gradually increased from 2024. Since Hulu was purchased by Disney, its subscriber numbers have risen, thanks in large part to the bundle options available with Disney+. In comparison to that, Disney+'s first-quarter subscription numbers this year more than doubled that of Hulu's, coming in at 124.6M subscribers.\nProducers and those making Hulu series and movies that are yet to come should be excited that their productions are going to have more promotion than they might have just being stashed on Hulu's app.\nThis isn't a small note that should be overlooked. The casual viewer may have guessed that Disney+ had more subscribers, but the reality of it is that Hulu's content will be put in front of an audience much larger than it ever has been before. This is only set to grow the consumption of Hulu's entertainment, providing a bigger profile for all of its shows and movies. The casual person flicking through Disney+ now has the option to look through even more content. Right now, if you have Disney+, you don't automatically have access to the full Hulu library. That changes in 2026 and Hulu will benefit.\nSome people now have more of a reason to get Disney+\nThey were separated for a while\nAs shown by the stats, there are people that love Hulu and its content. While there is no doubt overlap between the more than 130M subscribers to Disney+ and over 50M subscribers to Hulu, there are plenty of people who have just had the standalone Hulu app. Some of those people may drop off and not get a Disney+ subscription now that the Hulu app is going away. But plenty will get a Disney+ subscription strictly to watch Hulu.\nDisney+ has done a good job of separating itself from its initial content that was strictly Disney and Pixar movies and series. It has added universes like Marvel and Star Wars as well as National Geographic to broaden its reach among viewers. Now, it adds another as Hulu's content has been geared mostly towards adults. This gives adults another reason to look at Disney+ as an option for streaming and to continue to watch their favorite Hulu and FX shows on demand. Hulu's prowess in the industry will benefit more from the complete immersion with Disney+ than if it had stayed on its own."

      "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cord-cutting",
      "text": "Cord-cutting\nIn broadcast television, cord-cutting refers to the pattern of viewers, referred to as cord-cutters, cancelling their subscriptions to multichannel television services available over cable or satellite, dropping pay television channels or reducing the number of hours of subscription television viewed in response to competition from rival media available over the Internet. This content is either free or significantly cheaper than the same content provided via cable.[1]\nAs a market trend, a growing number of \"cord cutters\" do not pay for subscription television in favor of some combination of broadband Internet and IPTV, digital video recorders, digital terrestrial television and/or free-to-air satellite television[2] broadcasts. A related group, the cord-nevers, have never used commercial cable for television service, relying on internet sources from the start. A number of purely internet television services, part of the wider IPTV concept, have emerged to cater to these groups.\nIn the third and fourth quarters of 2018, 1.1 million subscribers in the United States left traditional satellite and cable in favor of internet based streaming television.[3][4][5][6] This decline continued into the first quarter of 2019 as cable and satellite lost 1.4 million subscribers.[7] This trend is occurring globally as cord-cutting varies between 7% and 15% of households across multiple countries in Europe and Asia.[8]\nA 2021 study found that cord-cutter households \"increase internet usage by 22%, reduce payments to multiple-system operators by 50%, and 16% acquire new over-the-top (OTT) video subscriptions.\"[9]\nMarket impact\n[edit]Parks Associates estimated that in 2008, about 0.9 million American households relied entirely on the Internet for television viewing; by 2017, this figure had increased to 22.2 million.[10] Leichtman Research Group found that 6% of Americans watched at least one show online each week in 2008, a figure that grew to 8% in 2009. The number of Americans subscribing to cable service increased 2% in 2008, but the growth had slowed. Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. found that in the fourth quarter of 2008, the increase was seven-tenths of one percent, or 220,000 homes, the lowest ever recorded.[11] A Centris report showed that 8% of Americans expected to cancel their pay television service by the third quarter of 2009. About half of Americans tried to get a better deal from a provider other than the one they were subscribed to. Free-to-air catch up, paid streaming services like Netflix and Hulu, niche interest services like Crunchyroll, and paid services offering cable television shows for cheaper like Disney+ and HBO Max, made cancelling service possible for those who would be unable to see television programming over the air. Sports programming was a big reason for not cancelling pay television service, although online options existed for many events. Another problem was the inability to watch many programs live, or at least soon enough in the case of a television series.[12]\n2010 was the first year that pay television saw quarterly subscriber declines. In the second quarter of 2012, Sanford Bernstein determined that losses took place in five quarters.[13] Leichtman found that the decrease in pay subscriptions was not happening in large numbers. One reason was that some sports events, as well as other types of television (such as series airing on cable-originated networks), could not be seen online. Sanford Bernstein said the number of pay television subscribers increased by 677,000 during the first quarter of 2010, and a poll conducted by The New York Times and CBS News showed that 88% of people surveyed had such a service, and only 15% had considered going exclusively to web services. People under the age of 45, the survey said, were four times more likely to use the Internet only. To combat the trend, pay television providers were allowing people to stream television programs on desktop, laptop and tablet computers. Craig Moffett of Sanford C. Bernstein still stated that high prices and other methods would eventually drive customers away, calling cord cutting \"perhaps the most overhyped and overanticipated phenomenon in tech history.\"[14]\nComcast reported a loss of 275,000 subscribers in the third quarter of 2010, bringing the total for the calendar year to 625,000. The company said most of these losses were not from people leaving for another service. Moffett pointed out that cable companies needed to offer lower-cost packages,[15] but a survey by Strategy Analytics revealed financial considerations were not the primary reason. People were not satisfied with what they could get, and online sources had a wider array of content. The survey showed that 13% of cable subscribers intended to cancel service in the next year. Slightly more than half were under the age of 40, and nearly all had a high school education. Two-thirds had or planned further schooling, and just over half earned at least $50,000 a year.[16]\nIn second quarter 2011, Comcast lost 238,000 television customers, compared to 265,000 a year earlier, though the company was making up for these losses with increases in other services such as Internet. Moffett said the slowing rate indicated that online sources were not making people drop cable as quickly. On the other hand, Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications lost more customers in the quarter than in 2010.[17] Time Warner Cable lost 130,000, while Dish Network lost 135,000; by comparison, DirecTV gained 26,000 subscribers, compared to 100,000 the previous year. Nielsen Media Research estimated that the number of households with at least one television set had decreased from 115.9 million to 114.7 million, while also estimating an increase in program viewing by computer, tablets or smartphones. Services such as U-verse were increasing their subscriber numbers by offering special features: U-verse's \"My Multiview\" option allowed people to watch four channels at once, while Cablevision's \"iO TV Quick Views\" allowed the display of up to nine channels at once.[18]\nA Nielsen report showed that during the fourth quarter of 2011, the number of people paying for television had dropped by 15 million people (a rate of 1.5%), and the number of cable subscribers dropped by 2.9 million.[19] A 2012 Deloitte report said 9% of television households dropped cable service during 2011 and an additional 11% planned to cancel their service.[20] Sanford Bernstein estimates 400,000 dropped pay video services during the second quarter of 2012, up from 340,000 in 2011. One reason for the drop was college students' returning home for the summer, while the companies made up for the loss in other quarters. However, the number of new homes paying for television service is less than the total number of new homes.[13] Another possible reason is services, such as time shifting and live recording capabilities, that were once exclusive to pay television services, are now being offered to cord cutters.[21] Although the number of subscribers usually increases in the third quarter, in 2012 only 30,000 people added pay television service, according to a study by the International Strategy & Investment Group. Cable lost 340,000 subscribers (with Time Warner Cable accounting for 140,000 of that number) and satellite gained only 50,000; telephone companies added 320 subscribers.[22] Throughout 2012, pay television added only 46,000 new subscribers, out of 974,000 new households overall, according to SNL Kagan. 84.7% of households subscribed, compared to 87.3% in early 2010.[23]\nA 2013 Leichtman survey showed that the 13 largest MVPD companies, covering 94% of the country, experienced their first year-to-year subscriber losses. 80,000 subscribers dropped their service in the year ending March 31, 2013. 1.5 million cable customers dropped their service, with Time Warner Cable losing 553,000 and Comcast losing 359,000 subscribers. AT&T and Verizon added 1.32 million subscribers; DirecTV and Dish added 160,000 subscribers, compared to 439,000 the previous year. Before 2013, only quarter-to-quarter losses had been recorded industrywide. Internet video and switching to receiving television programming by antenna were reasons. Bruce Leichtman described the subscription television industry as \"saturated\".[24] A TDG study showed nearly 101 million U.S. households subscribed to television at the industry's peak in 2011, but the number fell below 95 million in 2017.[25] In 2013, the number of total subscribers to pay television services fell by a quarter of a million. This was the first decline from one year to the next.[26]\nSome broadcasters have elected to embrace the concept of cord-cutting by establishing subscription-based over-the-top content offerings of their own, such as HBO Now.[27][28] Alongside the 2014 launch of CBS All Access, Les Moonves stated that there was a \"very strong possibility\" Showtime would also offer an OTT service\u2014a plan which was realized in June 2015.[29][30][31] On March 31, 2016, Canadian sports channel Sportsnet (owned by media and telecom conglomerate Rogers Communications) announced an OTT service offering its four regional feeds and two main national channels.[32]\nA TiVo survey showed that 19.8% of those without pay television service had dropped it in the previous year.[33] An apparent \"deceleration\" in 2018 turned out to be an increase in the number of households.[34]\nBy 2019, the OTT market was deemed to have become oversaturated and fragmented, as the sheer number of services has led to increased diffusion of content among them, induced by studios using exclusive rights to their content as a selling point for their own new services (such as Disney+, HBO Max, and Peacock), and existing services (such as Netflix) being required to pay premiums to maintain rights to popular archive programs or lose them to rivals, and increase investment in original content as a selling point. Some critics have argued that the fragmentation of the market has defeated the purpose of cord-cutting, as consumers are now being required to spend money on multiple different services in order to access their desired content, and that these inconveniences (including fluctuating rights to popular content) may cause consumers to resort to piracy out of frustration.[35][36][37][38]\nA MoffettNathanson report said the first quarter of 2019 was the worst ever for cord cutting, with an annual rate of 4.8 percent, and virtual MVPDs were not growing either.[39]\nBy 2022, cord cutting became the majority when the share of satellite and cable subscribers dropped to 48 percent.[40][41]\nImpact in Argentina and U.S. Anti-Piracy law\n[edit]In 2024, the phenomenon began to occur in Argentina as a result of Javier Milei's current great depression impacting in middle class in that country. This is due to, however, a recession that began under Mauricio Macri's presidency in 2018 and is still ongoing under Javier Milei's ternure. Cable providers like Flow and Telecentro has been affected by the crisis, making 2024 the first year of decline, 11 years after pay television began to decline in the United States in 2013.[42]\nOne year later, in January 2025, a new U.S. law, called \"Foreign Anti-Digital Piracy Act\", was introduced under Donald Trump's second presidency. It is expected to be treated in the upcoming months and, if approved, it will block all piracy IPTV and VOD web-sites, effectively accelerating the decline of premium content in both countries, in favor of digital terrestrial television channels, like El Trece (Argentina), NBC (United States) and other terrestrial TV networks.[43]\n\"Cord-nevers\"\n[edit]On November 28, 2011, a report by Credit Suisse media analyst Stefan Anninger said that young people who grew up accustomed to watching shows online would be less likely to subscribe to pay television services, terming these people as \"cord-nevers\". Anninger predicted that by the end of 2012, the industry's subscriber count would drop by 200,000 to 100.5 million; Anninger's report also stated that consumers were not likely to return to paying for television. In the case of land-line telephones, people had believed younger people would eventually get them, but now numerous subscribers only have mobile phones. Anninger predicted that the same would hold true for pay television, and that providers would need to offer lower-priced packages with fewer channels in order to reverse the trend.[44] Also using the term \"cord-nevers\" was Richard Schneider, whose company Antennas Direct was selling antennas through the Internet. After a decade in business, the company was selling 600,000 antennas a year. However, Schneider said some people only knew of the Internet and services such as Netflix and were not even aware broadcast television even existed.[23] In a speech on November 16, 2012, Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said \"cord nevers\" did not see anything worth paying for.[45]\nCord shaving\n[edit]In 2013, specific channels were losing more subscribers than pay television providers. This was because of what came to be known as \"cord shaving\", switching to a cheaper package of channels.[46]\nDrastic changes in subscription fees influence the cord-shaving phenomenon, meaning that when prices go up, consumers are highly likely to downgrade subscription services to lower packages and complement them with cheaper OTT television services. The risk with the cord-shavers is that once this group is dissatisfied with pay-television services, they become cord-cutters. The cord-shaving phenomenon is highly likely to increase as fibre is rolled out to more areas in South Africa, and as data prices are reduced. In the United Kingdom, 36% of OTT television subscribers downgraded their premium pay-television services. A further 71% of OTT television subscribers have combined their subscription with pay-television subscription services owing to the inability of OTT television services to offer elite sport, and this phenomenon is called cord-stacking.[47]\nBroadband-only TV products\n[edit]In an effort to entice cord cutters and cord nevers, some cable television providers have begun offering Internet-only streaming services. Cablevision began to offer \"Cord Cutter\" packages that include a free digital antenna and access to its Optimum WiFi network, as well as the option to add HBO Now to the service, making it the first-ever cable provider to do so.[48] In 2015, Comcast and Time Warner Cable (TWC) began to trial television services delivered via their managed internet infrastructures; Comcast's \"Stream\" service offered access to broadcast networks, HBO, Xfinity StreamPix, and their respective TV Everywhere services. Outside of TVE apps, the service can only be accessed via Comcast home internet on supported devices.[49][50] In October 2015, TWC began to trial a service under which subscribers are given a Roku 3 digital media player to access their service via the supplied TWC app, rather than a traditional set-top box. A TWC spokesperson emphasized that this offering would provide \"the same TV and same packages delivered to the home today\", but delivered over TWC-managed internet rather than a cable line.[51][52][53] This service has since been transferred to the current Spectrum service after Time Warner Cable's merger with Charter, with an equivalent Apple TV app forthcoming.\nAt the end of 2017, most new televisions had Internet capability, allowing access to both paid and free services with no need for a special set-top-box. This contributed to the cord-cutting trend.[54]\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Menon, Devadas (2024-05-24). \"Uses and Gratifications of Over-the-Top (OTT) Video Streaming Platforms in India: Predictors of User's Affinity, Satisfaction and Cord-Cutting\".
