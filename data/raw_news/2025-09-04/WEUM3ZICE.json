  "description": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX ) (SPY ) on Wednesday closed up by +0.51%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI ) (DIA ) closed down by -0.05%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX ) (QQQ ) closed up by +0.79%.  September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25 ) rose +0.56%, and September...",
  "content": "The S&P 500 Index ($SPX) (SPY) on Wednesday closed up by +0.51%, the Dow Jones Industrials Index ($DOWI) (DIA) closed down by -0.05%, and the Nasdaq 100 Index ($IUXX) (QQQ) closed up by +0.79%. September E-mini S&P futures (ESU25) rose +0.56%, and September E-mini Nasdaq futures (NQU25) rose +0.79%.\n\nStock indexes mainly settled higher on Wednesday. The broader market was supported by lower T-note yields and increased chances of a Fed rate cut later this month. T-note yields fell after the July JOLTS job openings fell more than expected to a 10-month low. The 10-year T-note yield on Wednesday fell -6 bp to 4.21%.\n\nStrength in megacap technology stocks was also a supportive factor for the broader market. Alphabet rose more than +9% after a judge ruled in an antitrust case late Tuesday that the company won't be forced to sell its Chrome browser. Also, Apple rose more than +3% after a court ruling stopped short of barring the company's lucrative search arrangement with Google, a deal that has generated roughly $20 billion in revenue a year for Apple.\n\nThe weakness in energy-producing stocks and energy service providers was a negative factor for the overall market on Wednesday after the price of WTI crude oil fell by more than 2%.\n\nUS July JOLTS job openings fell -176,000 to a 10-month low of 7.181 million, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of 7.380 million.\n\nUS July factory orders fell -1.3% m/m, right on expectations, and the second straight month orders have declined.\n\nThe Fed Beige Book hinted at signs of stagflation and was bearish for stocks as it stated that \"most of the twelve Federal Reserve districts reported little or no change in economic activity since the prior Beige Book period. Also, across districts, contacts reported flat to declining consumer spending because, for many households, wages were failing to keep up with rising prices. In addition, nearly all districts noted tariff-related price increases, with contacts from many districts reporting that tariffs were especially impactful on the prices of inputs.\"\n\nUS MBA mortgage applications fell -1.2% in the week ended August 29, with the purchase mortgage sub-index down -3.1% and the refinancing mortgage sub-index up +0.9%. The average 30-year fixed rate mortgage fell -5 bp to 6.64% from 6.69% in the prior week.\n\nFed Governor Christopher Waller said the fed funds rate is currently above the neutral rate, meaning monetary policy is restricting the economy, and that inflation is likely to move \"much closer\" to the Fed's goal in six or seven months. He added that the Fed should aim to get ahead of a sharp slowdown in the job market and \"we need to start cutting interest rates at the next meeting\" and make multiple cuts in the coming months.\n\nSt. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said, \"The current modestly restrictive setting of the policy rate is consistent with today's full employment labor market and core inflation nearly one percentage point above the Fed's 2% target,\" and it's important to take a \"balanced approach\" to policy right now and not weight too much to support the labor market or to fight inflation.\n\nAtlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic reiterated that he sees one interest rate cut this year, as price stability remains his primary concern, and it's not unambiguously clear that the labor market is weakening materially.\n\nThe remainder of this week's USeconomic calendaris busy. On Thursday, the Aug ADP employment change is expected to increase by +68,000. Also, weekly initial unemployment claims are expected to increase by +1,000 to 230,000, and Q2 nonfarm productivity is expected to be revised upward to 2.7% from the previously reported 2.4%, with Q2 unit labor costs expected to be revised downward to 1.2% from 1.6%. In addition, the Aug trade deficit is expected to widen to -$78.0 billion from -$60.2 billion in June. Finally, the Aug ISM services index is expected to climb by +0.9 to 51.0. On Friday, Aug nonfarm payrolls are expected to rise by +75,000, and the Aug unemployment rate is expected to rise by 0.1 to 4.3%. Aug average hourly earnings are expected to increase +0.3% m/m and +3.7% y/y.\n\nRegarding tariffs, a federal appeals court ruled late last Friday that President Trump exceeded his authority by imposing global tariffs without Congressional approval, but the court let the tariffs remain in place while appeals continue. The US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Court said, \"The statute bestows significant authority on the President to undertake a number of actions in response to a declared national emergency, but none of these actions explicitly include the power to impose tariffs, duties, or the like, or the power to tax.\" The case now appears to be headed to the Supreme Court for a final decision. According to Bloomberg Economics, the average US tariff will rise to 15.2% if rates are implemented as announced, up from 13.3% earlier, and significantly higher than the 2.3% in 2024 before the tariffs were announced.\n\nFederal funds futures prices are discounting the chances of a -25 bp rate cut at 95% at the next FOMC meeting on September 16-17. The markets are discounting the chances at 53% for a second -25 bp rate cut at the following meeting on October 28-29.\n\nOverseas stock markets on Wednesday settled mixed. The Euro Stoxx 50 closed up +0.64%. China's Shanghai Composite closed down -1.16%. Japan's Nikkei Stock 225 closed down -0.88%.\n\nDecember 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) on Wednesday closed up +15 ticks, and the 10-year T-note yield fell -4.8 bp to 4.213%.\n\nDec T-notes rallied to a 4.75-month high on Wednesday, and the 10-year T-note yields fell to a 4-week low of 4.199%. T-notes rallied Wednesday after the US July JOLTS job openings fell more than expected to a 10-month low, boosting the chances for a Fed interest rate cut at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting to 95%, according to the swaps market. Also, Wednesday's 2% fall in WTI crude prices reduced inflation expectations, with the 10-year breakeven inflation rate falling to a 1.5-week low of 2.404%.\n\nOn the negative side, concerns over Fed independence are bearish for T-note prices, with President Trump trying to oust Fed Governor Cook. The worry is that Mr. Trump is trying to replace Cook and other Fed officials with policymakers more inclined to lower interest rates regardless of inflation risks.\n\nEuropean government bond yields on Wednesday moved lower. The 10-year German bund yield fell -4.6 bp to 2.740%. 10-year UK gilt yield fell from a 7.5-month high of 4.845% and finished down -5.2 bp to 4.748%.\n\nEurozone July PPI eased +0.2% y/y from +0.6% y/y in June, slightly stronger than expectations of +0.1% y/y.\n\nThe Eurozone Aug S&P composite PMI was revised downward by -0.1 to 51.0 from the previously reported 51.1.\n\nSwaps are discounting the chances at 1% for a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the September 11 policy meeting.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) closed up more than +9% to lead gainers in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 after a judge ruled in an antitrust case late Tuesday that the company won't be forced to sell its Chrome browser.\n\nApple (AAPL) closed up more than +3% to lead gainers in the Dow Jones Industrials after a court ruling stopped short of barring the company's lucrative search arrangement with Google, a deal that has generated roughly $20 billion in revenue a year for Apple.\n\nThe Campbell's Company (CPB) closed up more than +7% after reporting Q4 adjusted EPS of 62 cents, better than the consensus of 56 cents.\n\nWestern Digital (WDC) closed up more than +4% after Morgan Stanley named the stock its \"Top Pick\" with an overweight rating and a price target of $99.\n\nMacy's (M) closed up more than +20% after reporting Q2 net sales of $4.81 billion, better than the consensus of $4.71 billion, and raising its full-year net sales estimate to $21.15 billion-$21.45 billion from a previous estimate of $21.00 billion-$21.40 billion.\n\nHealthEquity (HQY) closed up more than +7% after reporting Q2 adjusted EPS of $1.08, stronger than the consensus of 92 cents, and raising its 2026 adjusted EPS forecast to $3.74-$3.91 from a previous estimate of $3.61-$3.78, above the consensus of $3.73.\n\nKraft Heinz Co (KHC) closed up more than +3% after Morgan Stanley upgraded the stock to equal weight from underweight, citing reasonable valuation.\n\nGold mining stocks rallied on Wednesday, with the price of COMEX gold posting an all-time high. As a result, Anglogold Ashanti Plc (AU) closed up more than +3% and Gold Fields Ltd (GFI) closed up more than +1%.\n\nDollar Tree (DLTR) closed down more than -8% to lead losers in the S&P 500 after forecasting 2026 adjusted EPS of $5.32-$5.72, the midpoint below the consensus of $5.53.\n\nEnergy stocks and energy service providers were under pressure on Wednesday after the price of WTI crude oil fell more than -2%. ConocoPhillips (COP), Diamondback Energy (FANG), Halliburton (HAL), and APA Corp (APA) closed down more than -4%. Also, Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Devon Energy (DVN) closed down more than -3%. In addition, Exxon Mobil (XOM), Phillips 66 (PSX), and Schlumberger NV (SLB) closed down more than -2%. Finally, Chevron (CVX) closed down more than -2% to lead losers in the Dow Jones Industrials.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) closed down more than -5% to lead losers in the Nasdaq 100 after company executives gave cautious comments during the Wells Fargo Healthcare Conference. CEO Samath said he expects 2025 gross margins of 66% versus a previous forecast of 66% to 67%, and that tariff impact is expected to be higher in 2026.\n\nBruker Corporation (BRKR) closed down more than -11% after announcing a public offering of $600 million of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.\n\nSmithfield Foods (SFD) closed down more than -5% after announcing the launch of a secondary public offering of 16 million shares of common stock.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) closed down more than -3% as analysts have lowered their price targets for the stock by an average of 8.6% since it reported earnings last Thursday.\n\nZscaler (ZS) closed down more than -1% after forecasting 2026 adjusted EPS of $3.64-$3.68, weaker than the consensus of $3.68.\n\nBroadcom Inc (AVGO), Ciena Corp (CIEN), Copart Inc (CPRT), Docusign Inc (DOCU), Guidewire Software Inc (GWRE), Lululemon Athletica Inc (LULU), Samsara Inc (IOT), Science Applications International (SAIC), Toro Co/The (TTC), UiPath Inc (PATH).",

      "text": "The Quote Overview page gives you a snapshot view for a specific index. During market hours, indices are 15 minute delay, ET. New delayed trade updates are updated on the page as indicated by a \"flash\".\nBarchart Symbol Notes Tutorial (8:43)\nQuoteboard data fields include:\n- Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session.\n- Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram.\n- Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session.\n- Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.\n- YTD High, Low, Change, %Change: The high and low price year-to-date, with the change and percent change year-to-date.\nChart Snapshot\nA thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.\nPrice Performance\nThis section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the \"See More\" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.\nOptions Overview\nHighlights important summary options statistics to provide a forward looking indication of investors' sentiment.\n- Implied Volatility: The average implied volatility (IV) of the nearest monthly options contract that is 30-days or more out. IV is a forward looking prediction of the likelihood of price change of the underlying asset, with a higher IV signifying that the market expects significant price movement, and a lower IV signifying the market expects the underlying asset price to remain within the current trading range.\n- 30-Day Historical Volatility: The average deviation from the average price over the last 30 days. Historical Volatility is a measurement of how fast the underlying security has been changing in price back in time.\n- IV Percentile: The percentage of days with IV closing below the current IV value over the prior 1-year. A high IV Percentile means the current IV is at a higher level than for most of the past year. This would occur after a period of significant price movement, and a high IV Percentile can often predict a coming market reversal in price.\n- IV Rank: The current IV compared to the highest and lowest values over the past 1-year. If IV Rank is 100% this means the IV is at its highest level over the past 1-year, and can signify the market is overbought.\n- IV High: The highest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- IV Low: The lowest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- Put/Call Vol Ratio: The total Put/Call volume ratio for all option contracts (across all expiration dates). A high put/call ratio can signify the market is oversold as more traders are buying puts rather than calls, and a low put/call ratio can signify the market is overbought as more traders are buying calls rather than puts.\n- Today's Volume: The total volume for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) traded during the current session.\n- Volume Avg (30-Day): The average volume for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) for the last 30-days.\n- Put/Call OI Ratio: The put/call open interest ratio for all options contracts (across all expiration dates).\n- Today's Open Interest: The total open interest for all option contracts (across all expiration dates).\n- Open Int (30-Day): The average total open interest for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) for the last 30 days.\nBarchart Technical Opinion\nThe Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overall Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals. Unique to Barchart.com, Opinions analyzes a stock or commodity using 13 popular analytics in short-, medium- and long-term periods. Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy.\nThe Opinion will show on the Quote Overview Page for all asset classes with this exception: For all U.S. Stocks, the Market Cap must be greater than $1B.\nA symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:\n- Strong Buy (greater than \"66% Buy\")\n- Buy (greater than or equal to \"33% Buy\" and less than or equal to \"66% Buy\")\n- Weak Buy (\"0% Buy\" through \"33% Buy\")\n- Hold\n- Strong Sell (greater than \"66% Sell\")\n- Sell (greater than or equal to \"33% Sell\" and less than or equal to \"66% Sell\")\n- Weak Sell (\"0% Sell\" through \"33% Sell\")\nThe current reading of the 14-Day Relative Strength Index is also factored into the interpretation. The following information will appear when the following conditions are met:\n- If the Relative Strength is above 80, the following displays: \"Relative Strength is above 80%. The market is in extreme overbought territory. Beware of a trend reversal.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'above 80' with today's session, the following displays: \"Relative Strength just crossed above 80%. The market has entered extreme overbought territory.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'below 80' with today's session, the following displays: \"Relative Strength just crossed below 80%. The market has dropped from extreme overbought territory, indicating a possible trend reversal. \"\n- If the Relative Strength is above 70, the following displays: \"Relative Strength is above 70%. The market is in overbought territory. Watch for a potential trend reversal.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'above 70' with today's session, the following displays: \"Relative Strength just crossed above 70%. The market has entered overbought territory.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'below 70' with today's session, the following displays: \"Relative Strength just crossed below 70%. The market has dropped from overbought territory. Beware of a potential mean reversion.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'above 50' with today's session, the following displays: \"Relative Strength just crossed above 50%. The market is indicating support for a bullish trend.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'below 50' with today's session, the following displays: \"Relative Strength just crossed below 50%. The market is indicating support for a bearish trend.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'above 30' with today's session, the following displays: \"Relative Strength just crossed above 30%. The market has bounced from oversold territory. Beware of a potential mean reversion.\"\n- If the Relative Strength has moved to 'below 30' with today's session, the following displays: \" Relative Strength just crossed below 30%.

      "text": "The Quote Overview page gives you a snapshot view for a specific index. During market hours, indices are 15 minute delay, ET. New delayed trade updates are updated on the page as indicated by a \"flash\".\nBarchart Symbol Notes Tutorial (8:43)\nQuoteboard data fields include:\n- Day High / Low: The highest and lowest trade price for the current trading session.\n- Open: The opening price for the current trading session is plotted on the day's High/Low histogram.\n- Previous Close: The closing price from the previous trading session.\n- Weighted Alpha: A measure of how much a stock or commodity has risen or fallen over a one-year period. Barchart takes this Alpha and weights this, assigning more weight to recent activity, and less (0.5 factor) to activity at the beginning of the period. Thus, Weighted Alpha is a measure of one-year growth with an emphasis on the most recent price activity.\n- YTD High, Low, Change, %Change: The high and low price year-to-date, with the change and percent change year-to-date.\nChart Snapshot\nA thumbnail of a daily chart is provided, with a link to open and customize a full-sized chart.\nPrice Performance\nThis section shows the Highs and Lows over the past 1, 3 and 12-Month periods. Click the \"See More\" link to see the full Performance Report page with expanded historical information.\nOptions Overview\nHighlights important summary options statistics to provide a forward looking indication of investors' sentiment.\n- Implied Volatility: The average implied volatility (IV) of the nearest monthly options contract that is 30-days or more out. IV is a forward looking prediction of the likelihood of price change of the underlying asset, with a higher IV signifying that the market expects significant price movement, and a lower IV signifying the market expects the underlying asset price to remain within the current trading range.\n- 30-Day Historical Volatility: The average deviation from the average price over the last 30 days. Historical Volatility is a measurement of how fast the underlying security has been changing in price back in time.\n- IV Percentile: The percentage of days with IV closing below the current IV value over the prior 1-year. A high IV Percentile means the current IV is at a higher level than for most of the past year. This would occur after a period of significant price movement, and a high IV Percentile can often predict a coming market reversal in price.\n- IV Rank: The current IV compared to the highest and lowest values over the past 1-year. If IV Rank is 100% this means the IV is at its highest level over the past 1-year, and can signify the market is overbought.\n- IV High: The highest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- IV Low: The lowest IV reading over the past 1-year and date it happened.\n- Put/Call Vol Ratio: The total Put/Call volume ratio for all option contracts (across all expiration dates). A high put/call ratio can signify the market is oversold as more traders are buying puts rather than calls, and a low put/call ratio can signify the market is overbought as more traders are buying calls rather than puts.\n- Today's Volume: The total volume for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) traded during the current session.\n- Volume Avg (30-Day): The average volume for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) for the last 30-days.\n- Put/Call OI Ratio: The put/call open interest ratio for all options contracts (across all expiration dates).\n- Today's Open Interest: The total open interest for all option contracts (across all expiration dates).\n- Open Int (30-Day): The average total open interest for all option contracts (across all expiration dates) for the last 30 days.\nBarchart Technical Opinion\nThe Barchart Technical Opinion widget shows you today's overall Barchart Opinion with general information on how to interpret the short and longer term signals.

Results are interpreted as buy, sell or hold signals, each with numeric ratings and summarized with an overall percentage buy or sell rating. After each calculation the program assigns a Buy, Sell, or Hold value with the study, depending on where the price lies in reference to the common interpretation of the study. For example, a price above its moving average is generally considered an upward trend or a buy.\nThe Opinion will show on the Quote Overview Page for all asset classes with this exception: For all U.S. Stocks, the Market Cap must be greater than $1B.\nA symbol will be given one of the following overall ratings:\n- Strong Buy (greater than \"66% Buy\")\n- Buy (greater than or equal to \"33% Buy\" and less than or equal to \"66% Buy\")\n- Weak Buy (\"0% Buy\" through \"33% Buy\")\n- Hold\n- Strong Sell (greater than \"66% Sell\")\n- Sell (greater than or equal to \"33% Sell\" and less than or equal to \"66% Sell\")\n- Weak Sell (\"0% Sell\" through \"33% Sell\")\nThe current reading of the 14-Day Relative Strength Index is also factored into the interpretation.
