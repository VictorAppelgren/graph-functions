      "feedback": "This draft is a good start tying Intel’s government stake to a near‑term market move, but it needs precise, source‑anchored structure and a tighter 0–3 week horizon. Key fixes: (1) Correct the citation mapping and avoid unsupported threads. The Canada tariff narrative in OB27SL8WU is not about Canada or USMCA tweaks and there is no source in the set tying Canada tariff relief to Intel or to a near‑term equity read; drop that Canada thread or replace with a source that actually covers the topic. The only Intel‑specific anchors should come from XQWTVR71K, which documents the 10% passive‑stake (roughly $11B value, per Bloomberg Balance of Power) with a path to about 15% fully diluted and a pledge to vote with the board; note the source also mentions the 8.9B headline on the broader coverage and the valuation range to reconcile conflicting numbers. (2) Rebuild the causal chain with first‑principles and quantification. State: immediate driver = government investment in a strategic chip firm signals industrial policy and a re‑rating of semis risk; near‑term catalysts = disclosure of final stake terms, vesting timeline, and any governance mechanics; reaction function = risk appetite in tech hardware names and a re‑rating of Intel on policy risk/defense‑industrial synergies; invalidation = if terms differ materially from described, if the stake is not passive, or if vesting/valuation remains opaque; monitor disclosures on vesting schedule, government voting mechanics, and any subsequent legislation or statements. Quantify where possible (10% stake ≈ $11B, potential 15% fully diluted; 5% incremental stake upon vesting per the cited piece; cite XQWTVR71K for these numbers). (3) Strengthen the horizon in a tight 0–3 week frame. Add explicit near‑term triggers: (a) stake disclosure and vesting terms; (b) any new government‑industry statements on semis policy; (c) Powell/Jackson Hole signals that influence risk appetite for tech equities; (d) any short‑run price move in Intel shares and the broad indices on the news. (4) Don’t conflate or over‑index on non‑Intel sources. If you want to bring Shopify or other names in the same piece, ground them with separate mini‑scenarios under the same 0–3 week window and cite QGXA2WQJ3 or 19NO2GMNF accordingly; avoid importing BigBear.ai or Petco material unless you explicitly tie it to macro risk or market sentiment in the same horizon. (5) Improve numerical discipline and reconcile conflicts. Where sources disagree on the stake’s value or the vesting path (e.g., $8.9B vs $11B headline; 10% vs 15% fully diluted), present a narrow range (e.g., “roughly $9–$11B” or “up to ~15% on vesting”) and label the exact terms as “pending disclosure.” (6) Citation hygiene and coverage. Replace the misapplied OB27SL8WU reference with a source that truly supports the Canada/USMCA angle if you keep that thread; otherwise, remove the Canada piece and keep the Intel thread clean with XQWTVR71K alone. If you keep Shopify as a broader market context, anchor it to QGXA2WQJ3/19NO2GMNF to illustrate near‑term consumer‑tech equity dynamics. (7) Deliverable format. Convert the prose into a tight, causal map: immediate driver → near‑term catalysts → expected reaction function → key levels/thresholds (e.g., disclosure timing, vesting milestones) → invalidation conditions → what to monitor next, all within 0–3 weeks, with only the IDs XQWTVR71K and (if retained) the Shopify IDs for any ancillary points.",
