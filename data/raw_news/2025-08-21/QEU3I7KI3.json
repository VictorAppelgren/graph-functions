  "content": "It\u2019s back-to-school season \u2014 the weather\u2019s getting cooler as we say goodbye to summer.\n\nThis month, we\u2019re looking at change: in careers, in spaces and in the state of Delaware, including advice on following your moral compass at work, a coworking space upgrade and the reality of upcoming infrastructure projects to support our evolving technology needs.\n\nAlso in this month\u2019s Delaware Moves, US Rep. Sarah McBride passes a bill, Jet Phynx makes a deal with Del State, an agtech company with Delaware roots secures millions in funding, and more, after a look at the most popular tech job skills listed in Delaware job listings.\n\nThe annual Millsummit leadership conference \u2014 officially rebranded as the Spur Impact Leadership Summit halfway through the event \u2014 took place on Aug. 5 at 1313 N. Market St. in Wilmington. The event brought together professionals from different sectors, including tech, to discuss topics ranging from networking to knowing your rights in the workplace to AI.\n\nIts morning keynote, \u201cSpur the Next Phase: Navigating Career Opportunities Across Industries,\u201d brought together Delaware leaders from public service, nonprofit, technology and real estate. Four panelists shared their journeys of career transition and community impact, with a diverse group of local leaders sharing their advice.\n\nOne major attribute of a strong leader? Knowing when to walk away when your moral compass is telling you something is off, panelists said.\n\n\u201cThere comes a point in your life where you have to ask yourself what you truly believe, because you may have been wired to think success looks a certain way,\u201d said Theresa Young, who currently works in a leadership position at the American Red Cross. \u201cTake a moment to challenge those beliefs, and you may find the path you\u2019re meant to follow is different than you expected.\u201d\n\nCareer paths are rarely linear, said Nicole Denson, a managing director at JPMorgan Chase.\n\n\u201cLife is a journey,\u201d she said, not a strategic plan.\n\nYou can find a live recap and photos in our Delaware Slack channel, where we report on events we attend, giving readers a real-time behind-the-scenes look at our coverage. (Not yet a member? Request an invite here.)\n\nIn preparation for its 10th anniversary in April 2026, the Mill\u2019s original location is getting an upgrade.\n\nWhen it opened in 2016, the coworking space, founded and designed by Robert Herrera, helped to usher in an era of modern work and micro-offices to a city known for its sprawling banking and biotech campuses.\n\nWhile the Mill was not Delaware\u2019s first 2010s-style coworking space \u2014 that would be the old CoIN Loft \u2014 it has been the most enduring and expansive, with three locations: The original location at the Nemours Building (renamed Market West in 2023), the Mill Concord in North Wilmington and The Mill Seaford, a massive renovation of the Nylon Capital Shopping Center in Sussex County that is slated to open later this year.\n\nLast year, after weathering the pandemic, the Market West location opened its third-floor expansion, with more offices, amenities, coworking space and an open-air terrace.\n\nWhile the third floor remains open for work and events, the fourth floor is currently closed for renovations through the fall.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking forward to unveiling a brighter, better fourth floor in the coming months,\u201d said the Mill in an update, \u201crefreshed and redesigned to spark productivity, creativity and community connection.\u201d\n\nSince a massive data center known as \u201cProject Washington\u201d has been proposed near the Delaware City Refinery, there has been more than a little controversy and confusion, with a mix of optimism and pessimism over the project.\n\nDid you know that there are currently 18 existing or proposed data centers in Delaware? All far smaller than the proposed 6 million-square-foot Del City project, but the fact is, data centers are needed to fuel our technology, including rapidly rising AI usage, and are here to stay.\n\nDo you have opinions on Project Washington or data center projects in Delaware in general? We\u2019re looking for local ecosystem voices, whether experts or simply residents with thoughts. If you\u2019d like to comment, email us at delaware@technical.ly.\n\u2022 US Congressional Rep. Sarah McBride recently passed her first bill in the US House. The Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act is a bipartisan initiative, aims to change the definition of an \u201caccredited investor\u201d to allow more individuals to qualify for private investment opportunities.\n\u2022 Jet Phynx, founder of Jet Phynx Films, has been named Creative Director for Delaware State Football Media and exclusive creative partner for Coach DeSean Jackson.\n\u2022 Governor Matt Meyer recently announced that the state is currently accepting applications for the Delaware Nuclear Energy Feasibility Task Force, which will focus on small modular reactors as a possible energy source in the state. The deadline to apply is Aug. 31.\n\u2022 Delaware-founded TRIC Robotics has come a long way from Swim with the Sharks. The agtech robotics company, now located in California, recently secured $5.5 million in seed funding.",

      "text": "A massive data center proposal near Delaware City draws vocal concerns from residents during a town hall meeting Thursday night at the Delaware City Fire Hall.\nThe town hall was an opportunity for residents to weigh in on the 6.1 million square foot data center proposed by Starwood Digital Ventures.\nWhile a few spoke in favor of the project, known as Project Washington, many raised similar issues with the proposal:\n\u201cWe could be using the same space to develop new, alternative infrastructure.\u201d\n\u201cWill this increase our energy bills, it\u2019s a yes or no question.\u201d\n\u201cIf the infrastructure of Delmarva needs to be upgraded to serve your needs, who bears that cost?\u201d\nGrid infrastructure and power prices in the First State have been a point of concern recently , and discussion of the data center\u2019s construction dominated energy stakeholders\u2019 panel discussions last week.\nThe proposed data center is estimated to use 1.2 gigawatts.\nOther concerns included Starwood Digital Venture\u2019s lack of current commitment to guarantee local labor be given priority in the construction of the plant.\nStarwood\u2019s officials on hand emphasized the center would deliver over 200 new jobs for the area and an increase in commerce. They also confirmed the project would rely on the grid for power.\nSpeaker Melissa Minor-Brown (D-New Castle) served as discussion moderator. Afterwards, she said that she wasn't convinced by Starwood's presentation.\n\"The biggest concerns with the district were how it's going to impact their energy bills, how it's going to impact their water bills, Delaware contractors and union jobs and they couldn't answer any of those questions\" she told DPM. \"I know that the ultimate decision is up to County Council, but right now I'm asking them to say no to this project\"\nState Representative Eric Morrison (D-Glasgow) was also among the state lawmakers at town hall.\n\"The company proposing the data center gave us an empty dog and pony show, an arrogant and insulting sales pitch.\"\nMorrison expressed frustration with Starwood's lack of answers to what he called \"very basic questions\", including those about energy bill increases.\n\"It is unacceptable that Delmarva Power, Veolia Water, PSC, and DNREC did not send representatives to participate in the town hall.\", echoing other commenters complaints that members of those organizations, especially Delmarva Power, were not present.\nThe proposed project is inn New Castle County Councilman Kevin Caneco's district, and he continues to withhold judgement as more is learned about the proposal.\n\"I'll be real. I have concerns. I have a lot of concerns about this project right now. However, I want to make sure that I review everything, not a sketch plan but a real plan. When it comes before the county, I want to talk to my team at the land use department, who are the talented experts on this... I can't speak for other county officials, I can only speak for me as a district councilman, and right now, I continue to reserve judgement.\" he said.\nStarwood Digital Venture officials took and answered public comments during the meeting, but were not immediately available to answer media questions afterwards."

      "text": "Why Should Delaware Care?\nThe Trump administration\u2019s immigration crackdown has completely transformed the everyday reality for immigrants in Southern Delaware, imbuing the lives of hundreds of people with fear and uncertainty.\nGina remembers the abandoned cars appearing on the road.\nIt was a week in March, and they emerged without explanation.\nDerelict lines of vehicles littered the shoulders of U.S. Route 113 leading into her hometown of Frankford \u2014 a rural town of less than 900 residents near the Delaware-Maryland border.\nSome cars still blinked their hazards amid the absence of their owners. Others would remain deserted on the side of the highway for days or weeks.\nAll of them are remnants of the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on undocumented immigrants living in southern Delaware.\nAgents sweep through the roads in the early morning, arresting suspected undocumented drivers and leaving cars behind in their wake, according to resident accounts and social media posts. The drivers\u2019 family or friends are often notified of the abandoned cars through Facebook posts or pictures in private WhatsApp group chats.\n\u201cAfter a while, you realize why those cars are there and why they\u2019ve been sitting there for more than a week,\u201d Gina said.\nThe first thought for many immigrants at the sight of an abandoned car, residents say, is now that ICE took the passengers. Not car trouble or a busted tire, but federal agents.\nIn March, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents escalated their enforcement in a cluster of rural Sussex County towns that are home to scores of immigrants from Mexico and Guatemala.\nThe crackdown imbued deep-seated fear into immigrant communities along the state border \u2014 including Dagsboro, Seaford, Frankford and Millsboro \u2014 leading to a complete upheaval of residents\u2019 lives.\nImmigrants who have lived in Delaware for decades \u2014 raising children, paying taxes and opening businesses \u2014 are now retreating back into the shadows. The fearful conditions, some residents say, are the worst they\u2019ve been in more than 20 years.\nGina, alongside two other women interviewed for this story, asked to only use their first names out of fear of retribution.\nGina left for college last fall and returned to Frankford for the summer, eager to see her family, reconnect with friends and pick up a part-time job.\nBut the new reality greeted her instead.\nShe fears the next time she comes home, things might never be the same.\n\u201cThe worst scenario would be that everything I left behind is now gone,\u201d Gina said. \u201cI\u2019m going to come back to an empty house.\u201d\n\u2018Incredibly dystopian\u2019\nIn Delaware, administrative ICE arrests of undocumented immigrants have increased by nearly 115% since President Donald Trump took office in January compared to this time last year, according to the Deportation Data Project, a group that collects immigration enforcement numbers.\nThere\u2019s been an average of 1.6 arrests daily in the state since Trump took office, according to the data.\nMany immigrants no longer leave their homes, except for work. Some completely forgo driving anywhere until the afternoon to avoid the morning traffic stops. Some trade workers have outright refused to drive work vans to job sites \u2014 a reaction to ICE agents seemingly targeting commercial vehicles.\nSome Latinos have even begun tinting their windows to avoid being profiled by ICE, police or other drivers on the road.\nResidents have formed clandestine group chats on Signal and WhatsApp to share information about ICE sightings and photos of abandoned vehicles. Every morning, dozens of participants check in from their corners of Delaware, usually writing, \u201call clean,\u201d if their morning route is clear of law enforcement.\n\u201cThis feels [\u2026] incredibly dystopian to be almost hiding this way,\u201d said Katy, a 23-year-old Frankford resident.\nThe first thing Katy\u2019s parents say when they pass a car on the side of the road is, \u201cpoor thing, they took another one.\u201d\nThe recent crackdown has completely transformed the family dynamics between Katy and her parents, who have different immigration statuses, as they try to limit their interactions with ICE.\n\u201cDon\u2019t go there,\u201d Katy recalled saying to her parents. \u201cDon\u2019t go to Salisbury [Maryland]. For anything, tell me and I\u2019ll go.\u201d\nKaty has been forced to initiate uncomfortable dinnertime conversations with her parents about what would happen if they were to be taken. She keeps copies of her parents\u2019 work permits, has their lawyer\u2019s phone number, and knows how to open their safe.\nRecently, Katy\u2019s aunt and uncle, who have lived in Delaware for decades, received a letter telling them to report to Immigration Court. The pair abruptly packed up their lives and left for North Carolina.\nKaty has become hyperaware of her surroundings. Unusual cars or license plates raise flags in her mind.\n\u201cWhere the hell are we?\u201d Katy said. \u201cWhat the hell have I done to be having to remember cars and plate numbers?\u201d\nFor Carmen, a 23-year-old Millsboro native, the increased ICE enforcement has turned routine happenings into anxiety-inducing scenarios.\nOne afternoon, her dad was taking longer than usual to return home from a job. While a commonplace occurrence, the tardiness now took on a different tone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s 6, almost 7 o\u2019clock, and he\u2019s not home, and I\u2019m over here scared,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is scary living moments like this because we\u2019ve never seen it.\u201d\n\u2018That\u2019s the fear\u2019\nReyna Gilventura\u2019s father lived his life in Southern Delaware within a 5-mile radius. Fears of immigration authorities from his time as an agricultural worker in California lingered.\nHe might travel to Selbyville once a month for groceries and the laundromat, but that was it. No further. He never crossed that imaginary threshold.\n\u201cThat was the trauma he carried,\u201d Gilventura said.\nGilventura spent her childhood within that same threshold, amid the fearful haze of immigration crackdowns. But the conditions were still never as bad as they are now, she said.\nThe consequences of living without authorization in the U.S. have evolved, and a new dimension of fear has emerged for Delaware immigrants.\nThe Trump administration has deported people to countries from which they did not come, arrested those who are U.S. citizens and now threatens to detain immigrants in \u201cAlligator Alcatraz,\u201d a detention center in the Florida Everglades.\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK if you get deported, it\u2019s fine,\u201d Gilventura said. \u201cHow about if you end up dead or somewhere else? That\u2019s the fear.\u201d\nThere was heavy immigration enforcement on the weekend of Gilventura\u2019s daughter\u2019s quincea\u00f1era in Seaford. What she expected to be an overflowing and jubilant coming-of-age celebration became a quieter affair.\nGilventura even considered canceling the party. She didn\u2019t want to be the reason why someone got in trouble.\nDuring the event, many guests who had agreed to attend did not show. Gilventura did not ask questions.\n\u201cI knew why,\u201d she said.\nFor decades, immigrants said, Delaware was seen as immune to the effects of immigration enforcement and deportation seen across the country.\nThe First State \u2014 touting just less than 1 million residents \u2014 wasn\u2019t California, Texas or Arizona.\nBut for many Delaware immigrants, that reality is changing."

      "text": "Why Should Delaware Care?\nThe developer of the proposed data center near Delaware City submitted the first official plan for the project, beginning what will likely be a long, controversial battle to get the project approved by the county.\nThe company proposing to build a massive and energy-hungry data center near the Delaware City Refinery submitted exploratory plans to New Castle County on Friday, officially starting the regulatory review of a proposal that has already drawn opposition from hundreds of people in the state.\nThe official plans show how the first phase of the development would include six buildings \u2013 each about 500,000 square feet and two-stories tall. Six additional properties adjacent to the buildings are designated as \u201celectrical yards.\u201d\nThe electrical yards highlight the massive amounts of energy that the modern data center would consume as many expect it to power the latest revolution in artificial intelligent technologies.\nStarwood Digital Ventures, the company behind the proposal, has said the future data center could use as much as 1.2 gigawatts of electricity per hour \u2013 an amount that would power nearly twice the amount of homes that exist in Delaware.\nBut critics of the project point to energy usage as the problem. They worry it could pile increased demand onto a regional electricity grid that already faces a supply crunch and surging prices.\nAmong the critics is Delaware House Speaker Melissa Minor-Brown, who recently called on New Castle County to vote against the project.\n\u201cUntil Delaware has a plan for a long-term reliable source of energy, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s a good idea to bring in an organization that is going to drain this much energy,\u201d Minor-Brown said.\nDespite the pushback, Starwood \u2013 and its apparent partner in the project, PBF Energy \u2013 are moving forward with the plans.\nDuring a call with investors last week, PBF Energy CEO Matthew Lucey was asked about his company\u2019s role in the venture and whether the Delaware City Refinery, which PBF Energy owns, could provide electricity to the project.\nLucey was vague in his response, but said \u201cwe\u2019re exploring ways in which we can maximize value for our shareholders.\u201d\n\u201cWe have been working with Starwood, who has been an excellent subject matter expert. They\u2019ve done such projects in the past. We don\u2019t have anything formal to announce at the moment, but we\u2019ll continue to develop opportunities in Delaware,\u201d Lucey said.\nWhile many details of the data center project are not yet known, the benefits of it to Starwood and PBF are clear. Massive of amounts of money have been thrown at data centers recently as tech giants all race to become king of what they expect to become an AI revolution.\nOn Monday, the Washington Post reported that Google, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft are on track to spend an unprecedented $350 billion on building and equipping AI data centers this year alone.\nThe infrastructure underpins a wave of new AI products, including prominent publicly available ones like ChatGPT, Google Gemini and Microsoft CoPilot.\nIn a presentation at a recent town hall meeting, Starwood CEO Anthony Balestrieri did not say which company or companies might use the Delaware City data center, but said Starwood has worked with a wide variety of users.\n\u201cWe serve everything from financial institutions, cloud service providers, internet companies, health care, all of the above,\u201d Balestrieri said.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nStarwood submitted its Phase 1 exploratory plans on Friday, just days before the New Castle County Council is scheduled to consider new rules that would restrict how data centers can operate and be designed.\nThe timing of the submission means that the first phase of the project will be grandfathered under the current regulations, even if the county passes new rules before Starwood receives its approvals.\nCounty Councilman Dave Carter proposed the new rules last week as part of an ordinance that came in response to the public outrage over Starwood\u2019s proposal. The council will formally introduce the ordinance at a special meeting at 3 p.m. Tuesday.\nWhile it won\u2019t impact the first phase of the proposed data center, the legislation could still regulate the second phase of Starwood\u2019s project, which is planned for a property that would have to be rezoned in order for it to be built.\nAnd that rezoning will not happen quickly.\nDays before Carter introduced his ordinance, New Castle County rejected Starwood\u2019s request for an expedited approval process under the county\u2019s JobsNow program."

      "text": "Delaware\u2019s lone Congressional Rep. Sarah McBride passes her first bill in the U.S. House ahead of a month-long legislative break.\nCongresswoman McBride is co-leading the Equal Opportunity for All Investors Act, a bipartisan initiative to change the definition of an \u201caccredited investor\u201d to allow more individuals to qualify for private investment opportunities.\nUnder current federal law, participation in private capital markets is restricted to individuals with over $1 million in net worth or an annual income over $200,000.\nThe act would establish a new pathway for investors to qualify based on demonstrated financial knowledge.\n\u201cRight now, only millionaires can invest in these markets \u2014 that shuts out everyday Americans, especially women, veterans and people of color,\" Congresswoman McBride said. \"We need a system where a Black woman in Wilmington or a veteran in Georgetown has the same chance to build wealth as someone on Wall Street.\"\nShe says the Delaware Black Chamber of Commerce signaled support for the bill, arguing it would help close the capital gap for diverse business owners.\n\u201cIn Delaware, I've heard from veteran entrepreneurs, with women business owners who are locked out, not because they lack knowledge, but because they can't get investment. And it's not because of who they are, it's because of who they don't know.\u201d\nThe bill passed unanimously in the House and Congresswoman McBride says she is hopeful the same bipartisan support for the legislation will be found in the Senate, leading to the bill ultimately becoming law.\nCongress just entered a month-long break before it returns to attempt to pass a federal budget before the end of the fiscal year on September 30.\nCongresswoman McBride says she will continue to fight back against federal funding cuts being pushed by the Trump administration but remains open to working with Republican colleagues who are willing to work with her.\n\"It is my job to defend Delaware and to deliver for Delaware, and I won't stop doing both of those things. Right now we are seeing dangerous attacks on the health, the economic well-being of Delawareans by Republicans in Congress and the Trump administration,\" the congresswoman said. \"I will not stop fighting like hell to defend our rural hospitals, to defend health coverage for Delawareans. I will continue to fight for hungry families in Delaware to be able to put food on the table. I'll continue to fight for our schools and our first responders to have the resources that they need, that too often, they don't get.\""
