      "feedback": "This draft shows a solid attempt to tie AI-driven device cycles to secular memory/imaging demand and to marshal macro strands (tariffs, geopolitics, central-bank signals) into a 3–6/6–12+ month swing view, but it falls short of world-class quality in four concrete ways: (1) format discipline and clarity, (2) explicit first-principles causal chain with verifiable triggers, (3) tight quantification anchored to the actual source numbers, and (4) rigorous, consistent citation handling and conflict reconciliation. Actionable edits: restructure into exactly four Swing Trade lines (2 Up, 2 Down) with the required 5 fields each (Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %), and keep the text ultra-concise and highly observable (no narrative drift). For example, Down 0–3 months and Down 3–6 months should be tightened to crisp trigger lines such as tariff-pass-through thresholds or specific Yemen/Red Sea risk signals, with probabilities firmly tied to the cited signals (e.g., 25% for tariff/policy risks; 10% for geopolitical cross-border frictions). Ensure Up lines are anchored to a tangible acceleration story (AI adoption tempo, seven-year upgrade cycles) and specify what would constitute a regime shift versus a continuation. Use only IDs from the SOURCE MATERIAL after each line’s probability if asserting a fact or number; e.g., tie the Up lines to 5S9GJV2O3 and HWGNUP2XG for device-cycle arguments and to 9JYRMPXB0/1443EJVX4 for macro signals, but avoid injecting non-listed numbers. The Outlook (1 line preferred, 2 max) must be a trader-ready, tradable-asset framing if you’re employing a Swing Trade; provide Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence % with tight, explicit thresholds (e.g., Entry at X, Stop at Y, Target Z, R/R = 1.5x, Invalidation on Regime shift to B/C, Trigger = a sustained AI capex beat or a tariff spike, Probability 60%, Confidence 60%), and delete the overly long composite paragraph in favor of a single, crisp line. Deepen the first-principles core by codifying a minimal causal chain: (AI feature cadence -> device-refresh tempo -> memory/imaging CAPEX -> semiconductor pricing/demand) and (policy shifts -> inflation path -> discount-rate expectations -> risk premia) with a short, numbered cause-effect map, then map each to a concrete, auditable watchlist signal with numeric thresholds. Finally, reconcile conflicts by choosing a single base-case regime (Regime A) for the Swing Trade framing, note any plausible alternative regimes (B/C) only as explicit invalidate/flip-points, and ensure every critical data point (tariffs, payrolls, ECB independence, Nvidia AI momentum, etc.) has a clear, cited source ID next to it and is not contradicted by unrelated material.",
