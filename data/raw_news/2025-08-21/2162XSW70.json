You\u2019re trying to pick a brand, a size and you need to understand all the language around a variety of extra features. To help, we\u2019ve answered a few of the most asked questions.\nWhat is 4K resolution?\nA TV with 4K offers a much clearer picture than regular HD TVs. It has a resolution called Ultra HD (UHD), which means it has about four times more pixels than a Full HD TV. The higher pixel count makes the images on the screen look sharper and more lifelike.\nWhat features does a smart TV have?\nA smart TV offers much more than just TV channels. They come loaded with apps like Netflix, Hulu, Paramount+ and other streaming services, although you will still need subscriptions to these services to use the apps. Many smart TVs also come with voice control capabilities through built-in assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant. They also support screen mirroring, which allows you to display content from your smartphone, laptop or tablet on the TV screen.\nWhat size TV should I buy?\nThe right size TV for you depends on your needs. A smaller room requires a smaller TV (unless you\u2019re willing to have it take up the entire room), while larger living rooms and entertainment rooms can house TVs up to 100 inches. A good mid-level TV is a 40- or 50-inch TV, which is large enough to keep the whole family entertained."
