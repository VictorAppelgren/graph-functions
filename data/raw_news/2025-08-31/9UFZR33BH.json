  "title": "I love this Yakima SkyBox Skinny, but you won't believe why",
  "description": "I love a good roof box, and this one might be the easiest I've ever used.",
  "content": "I've written plenty of reviews about roof rack equipment or road-going gadgets at this point in my travels. In fact, I'd go as far as to say that it's my favorite modification that I've ever made to any car I've owned. However, for the past week, a new toy has lived up there, and it did so during my most recent 1,000-mile road trip to bay-fish in South Texas. Its name is the Yakima SkyBox NX Skinny, and it's still there as we speak.\n\nI've had other roof boxes before, but despite all the Yakima products I've indulged in over the past few years, this one takes the cake as my new favorite for a reason that I never really expected -- fuel economy.\n\nNot even Texas speed limits could make a difference\n\nWhen I first installed the box, which was a surprisingly easy process (more on that later), I thought that I would lose some fuel economy. This is the typical trade-off with roof boxes, and has been the trade-off for my entire time, owning and using them on different vehicles. You get the extra space, but not the fuel economy you're used to. Checks and balances, etc., etc.\n\nThis is due to the fact that you've now got an extremity protruding out into the air that was not present when your manufacturer tested the car in its wind tunnel. These are obvious facts that I previously thought to be unavoidable.\n\nHence, I went with the Skinny SkyBox as opposed to a larger model. In my head, I thought \"maybe this will save me half a mile per gallon, maybe even one if I'm lucky,\" but still thought I would live in the low 20s-per-gallon and be stopping several times along my route. That was by no means the case, and I saw the same mileage that I was used to without the roof box as I did beforehand.\n\nI averaged around 28 miles per gallon coming and going, which was a shock to say the least, given that the Texas speed limits didn't see my average speed drop below 75 miles per hour the entire trip.\n\nHow much does it actually hold\n\nSpoiler alert: way more than you might think\n\nI was able to fit three bags the size of airport carry-ons in the SkyBox, one small bag, some collapsible fishing poles and a collapsible plastic stool (which I highly recommend finding room for if your vehicle has a lift kit) very comfortably. If you travel with super-large bags that are the same size as checked luggage, they might be too tall for the Skinny, but if you're a bag person, the SkyBox Skinny might just be your jam.\n\nThe smooth hard plastic lining inside looks like it would be easy for things to slide around on, but with my rack loaded down nothing moved an inch. Even my fianc\u00e9e's hard plastic-covered bag showed no signs of scuffing or vibrating. I could see something sliding if it was stored up top on its own, but if you're a cloth bag traveler like me, that shouldn't be a big issue.\n\nHats off to whoever designed this system, because it works\n\nThe SkyBox arrived in one piece, and amidst the Texas heat, I forgot to take photos of the box itself, but it measured about eight feet long. The product ships whole, so there's no extracurricular building after the fact.\n\nIt comes unlocked, with only one side designed to open at a time. The keys are stored inside the box during shipping, along with the circular tool pictured above. This is the only tool you need to remove or attach the box to your roof rack, which makes the process easy enough for just one person to accomplish. In comparison to the universal roof rack I own, the box was easier to install than the rack itself.\n\nYou first have to unscrew four clamps from inside the box, which is what I'm doing in the first photo. This loosens the clamp and its sliding mount so that you can adjust them to your needs and specs. Then, after you've placed the box on top of your car in the desired position, tighten those same clamps down until you hear a click, and then it's hands-off. It really is that easy.\n\nI've installed boxes before that required three different sets of Allen wrenches, and it was an hours-long affair sometimes if I was by myself. This took all of 20 minutes, and that was with a West Texas water break mixed in.\n\nWhy would you buy the Skinny?\n\nFor those of us who need to use their garage, it makes the most sense\n\nI've already been asked by plenty of friends why I would rather have the skinny than a larger, less compact roof storage box, and my answer is simple -- hail. Believe it or not, we get our fair share of it here in West Texas, and as such, it's a gamble to leave any car parked in the street. I wanted a box that would comfortably fit in my garage while mounted and wouldn't make me sweat pulling in and out on my way to and from work or traveling.\n\nMy 2022 Volkswagen Taos is a bit taller than it was from the factory due to the lift kit, and the tires don't help in that regard all that much, either. Couple that lift with the roof rack being elevated from the roof itself, and the base of the SkyBox Skinny is a fair amount higher than if it were laying flat on the roof of a normal Taos.\n\nDespite that, however, I still have plenty of room to open the SkyBox and retrieve whatever might be inside without the fear of hitting my garage door when it's open and above me. On larger boxes I've had in the past, this was not the case, as I would either have to shut myself in the microwave that is my garage to get anything out, or unload outside before pulling in. All in all, the SkyBox Skinny just makes this whole process easier, and it earns serious brownie points for that.\n\nAnd in truth, that's probably what I like about the SkyBox skinny more than anything else -- its ease of use. It was easy to install, it's easy to live with, and it's easy to use. Yakima products might not be the cheapest on the market, but they've hit another home run with this one.",

      "text": "Summary\n- Some big weeks of travel are approaching -- it's time to utilize your roof rack.\n- Bike rack, fishing rod holder, cargo carrier -- be storage-savvy.\n- Consider a retractable awning or rooftop tent for off-road fun.\nI'll be quite open about the fact that nothing makes less sense to me than someone driving around with an empty roof rack. There are quite literally no benefits to doing so other than 'well, it looks cooler,' and with how much fuel economy mine costs me, that's just not worth it.\nHowever, if you've got one, and you do want to use it, there's no better time to get serious about your rack usage than right before that summer vacation or bachelor trip with your best buddies. As someone who's attempting to plan a bachelor's trip as we speak, trust me, mine will be doing a lot of lifting.\nBut what you do use your roof rack for depends entirely on your destination and plans when you get there, and these five gadgets should cover every base for every trip, whether it's a long road trip or a daily commute.\n1 The tried and true bike rack\nWhether you're an avid rider or just a beginner, this is a must-have for those beach trips\nOne of the biggest detractors that I hear from those who don't actually own a roof rack is the fact that the accessories are hard to store when they aren't in use, as they're usually large gadgets. The good news with most bike racks is that this is not the case, and as someone with limited storage space, I would only recommend you options that I've found to stow away easily and comfortably.\nThe good news is that the sentence applies to just about every bike rack out there. They're not cumbersome or seemingly in the way all the time when not in use, and they instantly enhance any beach trip you might take with the family otherwise. Additionally, for the hardcore trail rider, the bike rack should already be a staple in your arsenal, whether it's a hitch-mounted apparatus or on the roof, hence it being the first recommendation on the list.\nI recommend Yakima products to most of my friends, as they make the extra effort to ensure that no part of the apparatus comes into contact with the paintwork or body of the car.\nMake sure that whatever accessory you're buying is supported by your roof rack not only by dimensions, but also by the weight which your roof rack is rated for. Not all roof racks are created equal, after all.\n2 Fishing rod holder\nFor the responsible outdoorsy person with an SUV\nWhen I first traded in my truck for an SUV, one of the first snags I ran into what where in the world to put my rods and reels for fishing trips. I fish mostly rivers and lakes, so my equipment isn't the largest in the world, but I needed something that could hold a decent-sized rod that would allow me to reel in catfish and other larger species with no trouble. My only problem was figuring out where to put it. Enter, again, Yakima, with the ReelDeal fishing rod mount.\nYou might think this is a Yakima-sponsored article thus far, and you'd be fair to assume so, but I promise to break from that trend later on. For now, though, all I can say is that this has made my trips to the lake much easier and far less cluttered, without having to open my pass-through rear seat window or deal with any funky smells from my excursion inside my car.\nYakima ReelDeal Fishing Rod Carrier\nFree up space to bring more friends on your next fishing trip by stowing up to 8 fishing rods on your roof. Rubber cushioned grips clamp your poles in place, keeping them organized and out of the way on your trip to your favorite fishing spot.\n5 apps I use to erase my digital trail\nIf you aren't already using a VPN, now is the time to jump on the bandwagon.\n3 Roll-up cargo carrier\nWhere can you put a big, plastic tub that isn't in the way? Roll-up is the way to go\nThe traditional cargo carrier is large, typically made of ugly, cheap plastic, and is a nightmare to stow. Even if you purchased a lower-profile option, it still takes up serious real estate on the garage wall, which is just about the only sensible place to store one.\nSizing is a bit different with cloth cargo carriers, and while they do typically ride on the roof of the car itself, most will come with a paint protective mat so the carrier itself isn't scuffing any glass or roof paint.\nInstead, a roll-up cargo carrier, made from heavier-duty cloth, can stow just as much as the alternative and stow away in something so small as a closet floor or a garage cabinet. They're great for cross-country trips or longer stays, and with the technological advances in the waterproofing of cloth fibers nowadays, they even make for a great all-weather option.\nDon't work on the go without these 7 must-have laptop accessories\nNever run out of juice on the road.\n4 Retractable awning\nThe shade is always a perfect place to hang out either on or off-road\nFor those who are looking for a more serious off-roading or overlanding experience, the best first attachment for your roof rack is going to be a retractable awning. I don't think anyone out there would recommend an overnight trip as your first overlanding excursion, which is why an awning makes infinitely more sense than a tent for a first purchase.\nThat's not to say the massive number of innovative tent designs out there is a bad thing, but if you're a casual off-roader looking for a comfortable place to sit with some friends and enjoy the scenery, a good retractable awning will keep you looking and feeling like the coolest guy in your four-wheel club. Personally, I've heard solid reviews of ROAM Adventure Co. awnings, but as with many car modifications, make and model do play a factor, so be sure to research for your specific fit.\n4 things you should be doing with your car's USB port (that isn't charging your phone)\nThe U in USB standards for Universal, not iPhone or Android.\n5 Rooftop tent\nThere's no debate -- this is the coolest way to use your roof rack by a mile, but also the most expensive\nBy and large, most would agree that a rooftop tent is the most transformative accessory you can buy for your roof rack system. It can take any car from a boring daily driver with an extra piece of hardware to a utilitarian workhorse, especially if you own anything from a compact to a large SUV or pickup truck.\nI truly can't think of anything better than waking up in the morning, looking out my rooftop tent at the sunrise, and then hopping in my mostly-still-economical Volkswagen and heading home for the weekend. When it comes to making sure you get the most out of your roof rack, these five accessories can ensure that, no matter the task, you're equipped for the job at all times."

      "text": "How to Stop Roof Rack Wind Noise and Whistling: 7 Proven Fixes\nA whistling, noisy roof rack can become very annoying, especially on long trips.\nWhat is cause it and how can I prevent it from happening?\nThis whistling is caused by wind hitting the roof rack at high speeds and can be easily fixed in a few different ways.\nTo fix a roof rack with excessive wind noise and whistling you can install a wind fairing, buy aerodynamic crossbars, or build a DIY wind deflector.\nOver the years, manufacturers have made steady improvements to reduce wind noise, but as we head deeper into 2025, the conversation around aerodynamic efficiency and EV-friendly designs has never been more relevant.\nWhether you\u2019ve just installed a brand-new rack on your electric crossover or you\u2019re still rocking an older SUV, a few simple tweaks can drastically reduce (or even eliminate) that pesky whistling sound.\nIn this refreshed 2025 guide, I\u2019ll walk you through the main causes of roof rack noise, the most effective fixes, and some top product recommendations.\nWhy Roof Racks Whistle & Make Noise\nYou may be wondering why your roof rack is so noisy in the first place.\nThis is because the wind makes a noise when passing through objects, especially at high speeds.\nThis is most noticeable on consistently-shaped, small objects (such as a roof rack). This is called \u201caeolian sound\u201c.\nAs the wind passes quickly over your roof rack, the air is rapidly forced around the rack which makes a noise in the process.\nAirflow Turbulence\nRoof racks disrupt the smooth flow of air over your vehicle, creating pockets of turbulence. These pockets can lead to vibrations that translate into a hum or whistle. With more EVs (sporting sleeker roof lines) on the road now, any added turbulence is more noticeable.\nGaps and Loose Fittings\nEven tiny gaps between crossbars, end caps, or mounting brackets can generate whistling. If bolts or screws aren\u2019t tightened properly, they can vibrate and amplify wind noise\u2014especially at highway speeds.\nAccessory Attachments\nBike trays, kayak cradles, and cargo boxes with older or non-aerodynamic designs can catch the wind like a sail. In 2025, many attachments come with low-profile mounts or integrated wind deflectors, but older models can still be a problem.\nWorn or Missing Components\nRubber strips, end caps, or fairings can degrade over time. If you\u2019ve had the same rack for a decade, age-related wear might be the root cause of your noise problem.\n7 Methods to Stop Roof Rack Wind Noise\n1. Start with a Proper Installation\nDouble-Check Mounting Points\nTighten Bolts & Screws: Ensure everything meets manufacturer torque specifications. Loose hardware is a top culprit.\nLevel Crossbars: Crossbars that are misaligned or angled can generate turbulence. Use a bubble level if needed.\nFlush End Caps: Make sure end caps are fully seated\u2014gaps at the ends of crossbars are prime spots for whistling.\nThis is my favourite tool (Rightline Gear Torque Wrench) with a built-in indicator ensuring you\u2019re hitting the correct torque (widely available in auto stores and online retailers).\n2. Buy a Roof Rack Wind Deflector\nIf you already own a roof rack, the best option to fix the wind noise and whistling is to install a wind deflector, commonly referred to as a wind fairing.\nINNO Universal Mount Fairing - Top-rated\nA roof rack wind fairing is an easy-to-install plastic shield that deflects wind away from the roof rack, therefore reducing wind noise.\nWind fairings are usually universal but are available in different lengths to fit your vehicle.\nThe top section of the wind fairing attaches to the front crossbar, while the bottom rests on top of the car. Most wind fairings include strips of protective film to protect your car\u2019s paint.\nThe INNO universal mount fairing is one of the most popular wind fairings on the market.\nIt fits almost all crossbars and vehicle widths as it comes in three sizes: 31-inch, 40-inch, and 48-inch. Due to popular demand, it might be temporarily out-of-stock. That is worth the short re-stocking wait because it is affordable, high-quality, and durable.\nHow Much Do Wind Fairings Cost?\nRoof rack wind fairings are great for fixing wind noise, but how much do they cost?\nWind fairings typically cost between $60 and $120 depending on the brand, quality, size, and design.\nSome wind fairings are only compatible with roof racks made by the same manufacturer, therefore you should check compatibility before purchasing. If you must use a specific brand of wind fairing, you may end up paying more. Contrarily, a universal wind fairing is typically cheaper.\nThe size of your wind fairing may also influence its price. Large vehicles may require a longer wind fairing. Wind fairing prices can also be affected by quality and design. Some wind fairings come in different colors or designs, such as carbon fiber print. All these factors may drive up the price.\n3. Use Aerodynamic Roof Rack Crossbars\nIf you\u2019re looking for new roof rack crossbars, aerodynamic crossbars are designed to drastically reduce wind noise.\nAerodynamic crossbars\nInstead of square or circular bars, aerodynamic crossbars are designed in an oval shape, allowing air to glide around the crossbars without making noise.\nSome aerodynamic crossbars also include a wind diffuser strip, which reduces the wind noise even more.\nMost aerodynamic crossbars are quiet enough that they don\u2019t require a wind fairing. This means you\u2019ll save time and money on purchasing and installing a wind fairing.\n4. Roof Rack Wind Deflector DIY\nIf you don\u2019t want to spend the money on a roof rack wind fairing, there is a quick fix that may stop your roof rack from whistling. This fix works by using a bungee cord to diffuse the wind hitting the rack.\nSimply wrap a 4-foot bungee cord in a tight spiral around the crossbars, attaching the cord at both ends of the crossbar.\nThe bungee cord should be tightly wrapped around the crossbar to avoid flopping. If yours is loose, you\u2019ll need a shorter bungee cord.\nFollow along with the video below to see the exact steps.\nIf you\u2019re still experiencing wind noise after trying this, you\u2019ll need to purchase a roof rack wind fairing.\n5. Get Rid of the Roof Rack\nIf you don\u2019t use your roof rack very often, one simple solution may be removing it entirely!\nFewer attachments = less noise.\nMany people don\u2019t use their roof racks at all, so if you\u2019re one of these people you should consider removing it from your roof.\nThis will guarantee that the wind noise issue is solved.\nDon\u2019t worry \u2014 You can always reattach the roof rack whenever you need to use it again!\nAlso check out: Best Thule Roof Storage Options\n6. Consider Noise-Damping Products\nAttach small foam or rubber pads around clamps, brackets, or contact points. These pads reduce vibrations at the source.\nThese Sound-Absorbing Pads, Originally used in car audio for reducing panel vibrations, these are now marketed for roof racks. Brands like Dynamat have new, smaller sheets designed specifically to fit crossbar profiles.\n7. Maintenance & Routine Checks\nRegular maintenance is key to a quieter drive. Inspect your rack for cracks in plastic end caps or peeling rubber strips\u2014they can amplify wind noise if left unaddressed. A quick rinse to clear out dirt in T-slots or under fairings also goes a long way.\nSeasonal changes matter too: in cold weather, rubber stiffens and may cause rattles, while in hotter months, metal components can expand and loosen screws.\n- Check for Damage: Look for cracks or peeling rubber and replace parts promptly.\n- Clean Debris: Remove any accumulated grime before it leads to more noise issues.\nInstallation and Positioning Tips for Your Roof Rack\nInstalling most roof racks is pretty straightforward. Sometimes the devil is in the details.\nPositioning of roof rack is key not only for safety but also for minimizing wind noise and ensuring optimal aerodynamics.\nHere's a guide to help you get it right:\n1. Positioning to Minimize Wind Noise\nFront Bar Placement. The front bar should be positioned in a location where the roof starts to curve downward. Placing it too far forward can catch more wind, leading to increased noise.\nRear Bar Placement: The rear bar's position will largely depend on what you're carrying. However, as a general rule, it should be placed where the roof is flattest to reduce wind resistance.\n2. Spacing Between Crossbars\nThe spacing between the crossbars can indeed affect wind noise. Here's why:\nEven Spacing. Evenly spaced bars distribute the load more effectively and reduce the chances of creating pockets that catch the wind. This can help in minimizing wind noise.\nAccessory Positioning. Make sure that any accessories, like bike mounts or cargo boxes, are positioned in a way that they don't excessively protrude from the sides or front of the vehicle. This can help in reducing wind noise and improving aerodynamics.\n3. Additional Tips for Installation\nAvoid any vibration of loose parts by making sure all of your components are securely tightened.\nIn some situations, rubber pads can also dampen vibrations and reduce noise.\nBy ensuring proper installation and positioning, you can significantly reduce wind noise, improve fuel efficiency, and ensure the safety of your cargo and vehicle.\nChoosing the Best Roof Rack Wind Fairing\nFinding the best roof rack wind fairing is simple. Most wind fairings are similar in quality, design, and features, making it easy to choose between products.\nInstead of comparing many different product features and specifications, wind fairings are straightforward. Typically, you only need to consider the size and price when choosing a wind fairing.\nYou should choose a wind fairing that stretches the length of your crossbars, without exceeding it. Use a measuring tape or check your crossbar\u2019s product information to determine the length of the crossbars.\nIt is important to choose the longest wind fairing available without exceeding the length of the crossbar. This ensures that the entire length of the crossbar is covered without the wind fairing sticking out.\nYou should also consider the price (and quality) of the wind fairing before purchasing. Avoid spending less than $85 on a wind fairing since wind fairings below this price point tend to be low-quality. It\u2019s worth spending more money for a more durable wind fairing by a trusted brand.\nView wind fairings on Amazon.\nQuietest Roof Rack Crossbars\nIf you\u2019re looking for a new crossbar system for your car\u2019s roof, you should consider one with an aerodynamic design. This will help reduce wind noise without the need for a wind fairing.\nAlthough aerodynamic crossbars are more expensive than normal crossbars, they save you money since you won\u2019t need a wind fairing to go along with it.\nThere are 2 aerodynamic crossbars that dominate the market:\nBoth of these crossbars are popular and known to be the best aerodynamic crossbars available, but which one should you choose?\nBoth crossbars are very similar. They cost roughly the same, look the same, etc. Although, some people have reported that the Yakima Whispbar is slightly quieter than the Thule Aeroblade.\nRegardless, both crossbars drastically reduce wind noise while driving. Either one of these products is a great choice for aerodynamic crossbars, therefore you should choose the brand you trust the most.\nAlso check out: Why Are Roof Racks So Expensive?\nFAQs\nAre Quiet, Aerodynamic Crossbars Worth It?\nWith aerodynamic crossbars costing $200 or more, you may wonder if expensive roof rack crossbars are worth the price.\nRoof racks are worth the price if you\u2019re using them frequently, driving at high speeds, or taking a long trip.\nFor these scenarios, it\u2019s important to have a roof rack that is stable, reliable and produces minimal wind noise.\nIf you\u2019re concerned about wind noise, it\u2019s absolutely worth purchasing aerodynamic crossbars. This will save you money in the end since you won\u2019t need to purchase a wind fairing to accompany the crossbars.\nCan Consistent Wind Noise Damage my Roof Rack or Vehicle Over Time?\nConsistent wind noise itself is unlikely to directly damage your roof rack or vehicle.\nHowever, a noise can be an indication of improper installation or a loose component on your roof rack.\nIf this happens, do your best to address it immediately as loose parts can lead to wear and tear or even damage your vehicle.\nDoes Wind Noise from Roof Racks Affect Fuel efficiency?\nAs for fuel efficiency, wind noise alone doesn't directly impact your fuel consumption.\nHowever roof racks, especially when loaded, disrupt the smooth flow of air over the vehicle, increasing drag.\nThis means the vehicle has to work harder, leading to higher fuel consumption.\nIn reality, your fuel economy won't be effect by a huge amount. Your driving style, terrain and weather conditions will have a greater impact compare to wind noise and roof top cargo.\nConclusion: Tackling Roof Rack Wind Noise\nRoof rack noise, known as \"aeolian sound,\" arises from wind rushing over the rack.\nWhile it's not directly harmful, it's annoying for longer trips. In rare cases, it can indicate that some of your parts are loose.\nTo combat this, here are 4 methods and solutions.\n- Get wind a fairing: These are plastic shields that deflect wind away from the rack. They're affordable (typically between $60 and $120) and come in various sizes and designs.\n- Consider aerodynamic crossbars: Oval-shaped bars designed to reduce wind noise. They might be pricier, but they save you the cost and hassle of adding a wind fairing.\n- Fix it yourself with DIY: A tightly-wrapped bungee cord around the crossbars can help diffuse wind.\n- Remove the rack: If you rarely use it, why not take it off? It's a surefire way to eliminate the noise.\nProper positioning during installation reduces noise and improves aerodynamics.\nWhen choosing a wind fairing, consider size and quality. Brands like Thule Aeroblade and Yakima Whispbar offer top-notch aerodynamic crossbars.\nAnd remember, a well-maintained, aerodynamic rack doesn\u2019t just spare your ears.\nIt can also boost fuel efficiency (or preserve EV battery range), saving you money in the long run.\nIf you have any questions about quieting your rack or want personalized recommendations, contact me at MyCargoRacks.com\u2014we\u2019re always here to help you gear up the right way.\n*proof-read by @Mike Rollins"

      "text": "Summary\n- Upgrade your car with HUDWAY Drive for a modern heads-up display experience.\n- Consider a CarPlay and Android Auto-compatible infotainment system for convenience.\n- Install aftermarket blind spot monitors & a remote start system for an updated & comfortable driving experience.\nHave you ever gotten into your friend's new car and thought to yourself, 'Wow, it's crazy what comes as standard these days?' Well, you're not alone. I distinctly remember getting into my friend's new 3-series BMW back in 2022 and immediately thinking of ways I could spice up my old Volkswagen.\nI myself used a few of these gadgets right up until I bought the car I have now, and despite using other gizmos to make it a bit more user-friendly, I haven't exactly needed as many of these. However, as the years have passed, new iterations and models have emerged that take old cars to even greater heights in 2025. These five gadgets can make any older model feel like a brand-new release if done correctly.\nWorld Travel Week 2025 is here: make your next trip easier\nTravelling can be a stressful, sometimes frustrating experience -- here's a few tips to ensure your next trip goes smoothly.\n1 Modular heads-up display\nAll the information you need right inside your field of vision\nHeads-up displays are quite common on newer vehicles, and they've been proven to be a feature that can make your driving experience safer and enjoyable. This isn't a new technology, though, and in fact, it was an option all the way back on the 1999 Chevrolet Corvette, but it's one that has come a long way in terms of providing drivers with great information without distracting them from the road.\nHUDWAY Drive\nHUDWAY Drive is a portable heads-up display for everyday commute:\nKeeps you connected in a less distracting way: speed, navigation, calls, notifications, or music info on a translucent screen right in front of you.\nI'd recommend HUDWAY's Drive system before anything else, as it comes with a fully functioning app to edit your HUD widgets and an OBD2 plugin that can show you live diagnostics information regarding your car itself, so if you're running a little hot or a check engine light displays, the HUD will let you know.\nAs HUDWAY is a smaller company, they often run out of stock fairly quickly. However, customers can join their mailing list to receive updates on when new stock is available, and it will ship within a week of their order, according to HUDWAY.\nPopSocket finally caught up to 2025 with this accessory\nHave you ever wanted to stand your iPhone up vertically? Then this is the accessory for you.\n2 A CarPlay and Android Auto-compatible infotainment system\nIt doesn't have to be a movie screen, but CarPlay and Android Auto make any drive easier.\nPeople have been upgrading their stereos just about as soon as they became standard equipment, but they've never been as advanced as they are right now. Sure, you can just take a tablet into the cabin, but sometimes it's a custom fit you're looking for. Of course, a lot of what you can and can't do with your stereo system revolves around what car you drive. Luckily, Crutchfield has an easy-to-use menu to determine the answer to that exact question.\nTruth be told, you can spend as much as $1,500 and as little as a couple of hundred dollars on finding a new touchscreen stereo for your car, but in this competitive marketplace, more often than not, you get what you pay for. For instance, Kenwood's latest system goes for upwards of the $1,500 mark, but it comes with the ability to integrate the company's new HD cameras at all corners of the car and embedded Garmin navigation software.\nThe future of CarPlay is here, if you drive a new Aston Martin\nApple's next-generation CarPlay experience is finally here, and it is officially called CarPlay Ultra.\n3 Rearview mirror backup camera\nYour mirror is the easiest thing in your car to replace. Why not do it right?\nMuch like a new stereo system, the shape and size of a rearview mirror camera system can vary depending on factors such as the type, size, and shape of the dash and vehicle itself. There are numerous options to choose from here, again, but the same principle applies -- you get what you pay for.\nCrutchfield doesn't make this as easy as it does buying stereos, but they do have a helpful guide on deciding which system is best for you, especially if it's a rearview mirror replacement. Most manufacturers are already shifting to a screened overhead mirror to monitor things like back seat activity without a funky-shaped mirror system, and even that option can be checked off in the aftermarket space.\nApple's tvOS change is unnecessary, and it's bad news for old Apple TVs\nThis isn't an exciting change.\n4 Aftermarket blind spot monitors\nYou'll never know how handy they are until you use them\nAnother safety feature that you may not realize you need until you try it is a set of blind spot monitors. Gone are the days of slapping on extra convex mirrors and other funky add-ons. Now, with radar assistance, any driver can have this modern piece of tech by replacing a few interior pieces, depending on their model. Additionally, some companies will manufacture mirrors to OEM spec with radar detection built in, but those require sitting through a waiting list, sending a deposit, etc.\nAs someone who used to drive a vehicle from the early 2000s, I would slap these on in a heartbeat now that they're standard on my new car. They make highway and interstate driving a breeze, even through dense Atlanta traffic. Just ask my fianc\u00e9, who peacefully slept away through that portion of our last trip.\nThis mirror dash cam is a great copilot, but takes up a lot of screen real estate\nThis premium mirror dash cam features high-resolution recording and probably fits on your car.\n5 Remote Start System\nBecause nobody enjoys just jumping into a hot car.\nThe final step in equipping any older car with modern tech in 2025 is adding a remote start feature, and no company makes this easier than Compustar. There are some challenges when it comes to getting your hands on one -- you can't have it delivered straight to your door -- but if there's a dealer near you, it can take away one of the worst parts of an old car; having to get inside a scorching cabin during these hot summer months.\nCompustar works directly with dealers as opposed to selling on the open market, so prices may vary depending on markup and location. Additionally, Compustar manufactures various autostart and security systems tailored to meet a customer's specific needs, including phone connectivity and finely tuned alarm systems. If interested, you can search for a dealer via a portal on the Compustar website.\nThere are other ways to make your car more modern, like newer headlights, taillights, or even performance-enhancing braking systems. However, these five features are the fastest way to take any old car into 2025 from a comfort and usability standpoint."

      "text": "Summary\n- Opt for a B2B Fab lift kit for a standout rugged SUV look at a higher cost.\n- Choose all-terrain tires like Falken for longevity and weight advantages.\n- Consider removable roof racks and Weather-Tech floor mats for versatility and easy dirt cleanup.\nIn 2025, more people than ever before are entering the compact to mid-sized SUV market. That means that, yes, more and more people are buying what have traditionally been dubbed as \"mom cars,\" and I am no exception.\nI swapped from a 2018 Ford F-150 to a 2022 Volkswagen Taos two years ago, and haven't looked back since. However, I wasn't quite satisfied with how my car looked straight from the factory. It was too low to the ground, had small, skinny tires, and didn't quite fit the rugged SUV look that I was going for. Therefore, I had to make some changes, and I'm here to tell you about the five best ones that I've done.\n5 car gadgets that make my road trips a breeze\nI put 30,000 miles a year on my car, and these five gadgets make each one a little bit better.\n1 B2B Fab lift kit\nThe most expensive mod is the one I'm the most proud of\nB2B Fab is a small suspension manufacturer based in Delaware, and is to this day one of the best companies I've ever worked with when it comes to modifying a vehicle. In fact, when the technician I hired to install the lift kit couldn't figure it out the first go around, the guys at B2B Fab stayed on the phone with them to assist. If you have a Volkswagen and want to lift it, they're the company to talk to.\nThis is not sponsored content. I just genuinely enjoyed my experience with B2B Fab that much. The company specializes in Volkswagen and Audi overlanding parts, though, so if you're driving another brand, you may want to look elsewhere, like ReadyLift or HRG Offroad. I also recommend adding spacers to your car to set the stance a bit better, but keep it as low as possible. Nobody needs to snap a wheel off.\nIf you're looking to go lower instead of higher, that's alright, too. Essentially, changing the stance of your car can be the first step towards enhancing your car's appearance. Whether you want to lift it or slam it, that needs to be the first and most expensive step in getting your ride looking right.\n5 gadgets I use to make my old car feel like a 2025 model\nStuck in that old beater, or just waiting for the payoff? These five gadgets can bring any old car up to speed for 2025.\n2 All-terrain tires\nNot a lot of companies make them the size you'll need, so be careful\nThe biggest struggle with my modification list came when I was attempting to find out what companies made the right sized tire for me. The list was short, and between the two I chose the Falken Wildpeak AT3w. I had always owned pickup trucks up to this point, and most of those were diesels up to my F-150. Those trucks chewed through anything that wasn't a 10-ply tire, which doesn't come cheap.\nHowever, I've put around 40,000 miles on these tires, and still have around half of the tread left. And I don't mean that the tires will be bald after that half - they'll just be to the recommended changing point. The weight you save by switching to a compact SUV really makes a difference in the longevity of your tires, and it's a difference that has really impressed me thus far.\n10 plug-in hybrid SUVs with the longest electric range in 2025\nYou'll be surprised at how far you can travel on electricity alone in these plug-in hybrid SUVs.\n3 A removable roof rack\nThis is the best upgrade I've made in terms of usability\nThe first thing I believed I would miss from owning a pickup was the utilitarian benefit of the thing that actually makes it a pickup - the bed. And don't get me wrong, I still do miss it, especially when I'm in the midst of a cross-country move, as I am now. However, the addition of a roof rack to my daily driver has made my hobbies much easier to accommodate. As I've written before, I have purchased a plethora of gadgets for my roof rack, and they've made things like fishing trips or long vacations in which we need extra baggage a real breeze.\nThe best part of the roof rack, though, is that it's removable. When it's attached, it does knock my fuel mileage down a peg simply due to the added drag. Removing it is as easy as inserting an Alan head bit into a drill, pressing a button and unlocking the clamps with a key I keep on my ring.\nThis mirror dash cam is a great copilot, but takes up a lot of screen real estate\nThis premium mirror dash cam features high-resolution recording and probably fits on your car.\n4 Weather-Tech floor mats\nHaving the peace of mind to not worry about my carpets was a breath of fresh air\nThese were actually a gift from my fianc\u00e9e, and, as a motorsport photographer that spends a lot of his Saturday nights at a dirt track, they were a more than welcome addition to my interior. That red clay does nothing but get into a carpet and stay there, and now, I never have to worry about it.\nI get comments about the floor mats all the time, too. My racing friends are always happy to know they can just knock their feet off on the floorboard without having to worry about muddying up my interior, and I'm always happy to put a good gift to use.\nWhy I think you should buy a pure EV and not a hybrid car\nIt's not just about range and upfront affordability.\n5 Aftermarket headlights\nThis is a perfect buy for older models with halogens\nMy car came with LED headlights, but each previous vehicle I owned came with halogens, and one of the earliest modifications I ever made was purchasing headlights with daytime running lights or brighter LEDs. Not only is this a great modification to the appearance of any car, but it also helps in terms of nighttime visibility.\nHowever, don't be the rude driver that points them too high and blinds everyone that passes them on the highway. Those people don't deserve cool mom cars, but you sure do.\nThe Nissan Leaf is dead, long live the new Leaf\nI'm going to miss the Leaf's earlier spirit, but it's probably for the best."
