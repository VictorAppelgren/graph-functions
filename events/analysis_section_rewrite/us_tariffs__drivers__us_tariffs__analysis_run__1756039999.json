      "feedback": "The draft correctly flags the 90‑day tariff truce as the core macro signal and notes the avoidance of 30%/10% tariffs and the relief to retailers (RHXDOHQQX), but it lacks a coherent causal chain, a cross‑topic synthesis, and explicit scenarios with triggers; to elevate it, rewrite to (RHXDOHQQX) attach to every tariff claim, then build a formal, first‑principles link: tariffs alter marginal cost and pricing power, which shapes trade flows, retailer margins, pricing decisions, and inventories, with downstream effects on consumer prices and macro trade dynamics; structure the analysis around macro, policy, flows/positioning, and valuations/technicals, and present a base case plus upside and downside scenarios, each with explicit catalysts and invalidation paths (e.g., extension renewed under new terms, lapse with reimposition of 30%/10%, or an extension that changes terms) (RHXDOHQQX); quantify where possible using the source magnitudes (30%, 10%, 90 days) and clearly state pass‑through assumptions rather than qualitative platitudes (RHXDOHQQX); expand the watch list with concrete signals: extension status and renewal terms, any tariff level changes, trade‑flow indicators (import volumes, timing, inventory levels) and retailer pricing trajectories that reveal policy pass‑through (RHXDOHQQX); ensure alignment with the SECTION FOCUS by explicitly naming and weighing cross‑topic drivers (macro, policy, flows/positioning, valuation/technicals) and by articulating where the thesis is fragile and what decisive upcoming data would validate or refute it; finally, prune repetition and deliver a tight, data‑anchored narrative that reconciles all critical source claims (RHXDOHQQX).",
