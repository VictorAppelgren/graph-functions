      "feedback": "The draft is on the right track but needs tightening to meet the Argos standards: 1) **Add explicit canonical handle mapping** – each claim about the S&P 500, 10‑yr Treasury yield, and the dollar should be linked to handles (e.g., `spx`, `ust10y`, `dxy`) and include a sign and magnitude range (e.g., “spx down 5‑10 % if Fed holds rates”). 2) **Cite every substantive claim** – most statements currently rely only on FAN5RYW6T; add inline citations for Fed policy (e.g., “Fed may cut rates in September” → FAN5RYW6T) and for the 10‑yr yield trend (use a separate source if available, otherwise note “data not provided”). 3) **Remove peripheral drift** – the sentence “The presence of tariffs also feeds into the inflation narrative, as the U.S. tariff regime continues to elevate import costs, thereby sustaining inflationary headwinds that could keep the Fed from easing (F7K7Y35U5)” is tangential; either replace it with a concise reference to the article’s tariff impact on inflation or delete it. 4) **Quantify catalysts and invalidations** – specify the exact catalyst windows (e.g., “September 5 payrolls, September Fed meeting, Q3 earnings releases”) and state the invalidation conditions (e.g., “Fed cuts rates → 10‑yr yield falls 20‑30 bp → spx up 5‑8 %”). 5) **Include watch‑list signals** – list concrete indicators (Fed minutes, CPI/PCE, 10‑yr yield, DXY, VIX) and the threshold that would validate the downside scenario. 6) **Add a concise base‑case, upside, and downside narrative** with magnitude ranges and horizon. 7) **Ensure every sentence ends with a citation** or an explicit assumption. After these edits, the piece will satisfy the truth‑over‑verbosity rule, provide a clear causal chain, and deliver actionable, defensible trade signals.",
