      "text": "How do you play Mega Millions? What to know about buying tickets, picking numbers\nMega Millions players could ring in the new year as a billionaire if the odds are in their favor.\nJust a few hours away of the Friday, Dec. 27 drawing, the jackpot is worth an estimated $1.22 billion. If the lucky winner chooses the cash option, they can take home $549.7 million, the lottery said.\nThe last time someone won a Mega Millions jackpot was back in September. A Texas player won the $810 million prize. Another lucky player won $1.128 billion in March. On Dec. 23, the New Jersey player claimed their prize. The largest lottery jackpot in Mega Millions history was a $1.602 billion prize from one winning ticket in Florida in August 2023.\nWith the jackpot continuing to rise, more people are trying their luck at the game. If no one wins tonight's jackpot, the grand prize will continue to grow until a winner is declared.\nReady to try your luck? Here's a guide on how to play Mega Millions.\nWhat time is the Mega Millions drawing?\nMega Millions drawings are every Tuesday and Friday at 11 p.m. ET. The next drawing is Friday, Dec. 27.\nWinning lottery numbers are sponsored by Jackpocket, the official digital lottery courier of the USA TODAY Network.\nWhat are the top 10 Mega Millions jackpots?\nAccording to the lottery, the following jackpots are the top 10 jackpots that have been won as of Dec. 27:\n- $1.602 billion, Aug. 8, 2023; a Florida player\n- $1.537 billion, Oct. 23, 2018; a South Carolina player\n- $1.348 billion, Jan.13, 2023; a Maine player\n- $1.337 billion, July 29, 2022; an Illinois player\n- $1.128 billion, March 26, 2024; a New Jersey player\n- $1.050 billion, Jan. 22, 2021; a Michigan player\n- $810 million, Sept. 10, 2024; a Texas player\n- $656 million, March 30, 2012; a player from Illinois, Kansas and Maryland\n- $648 million, Dec. 17, 2013; a player from California and Georgia\n- $552 million, June 4, 2024; an Illinois player\nHow to play Mega Millions\nMega Millions tickets cost $2 per play.\nTo play, pick six numbers from two separate pools of numbers: either five different numbers from 1-70 for the white numbers, and one number from 1-25 for the gold Mega Ball.\nYou win the Mega Millions jackpot by matching your numbers to all six numbers pulled in the drawing.\nIf you don't want to pick your own numbers or if you'd rather leave it up to chance, the Mega Millions has a random number generator on its website, where a computer will randomly generate options for white balls and a Mega Ball.\nPlayers can add the \"Megaplier\" for $1 which can increase non-grand prize winnings by two, three, four or five. The Megapiler is drawn before the Mega Millions numbers on Tuesday and Friday.\nThere are 15 Megapiler balls in all:\n- 2X, five balls\n- 3X, six balls\n- 4X, three balls\n- 5X, one ball\nWhat is the Megaplier?\nMost states offer the Megaplier feature, a multiplier which increases non-jackpot prizes by two, three, four and five times.\nIt costs an additional $1 per play. Before each regular Mega Millions drawing, the Megaplier is drawn. From a pool of 15 balls, five are marked with \"2X,\" three with \"4X\" and one with \"5X.\"\nWhat are the odds of winning the Mega Millions?\nYour odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot are pretty slim: Just 1 in 302,575,350, according to the lottery.\nThe odds of winning the smaller, $1 million prize are 1 in 12,607,306.\nWhere to buy Mega Millions tickets\nTickets can be purchased in person at gas stations, convenience stores and grocery stores. Some airport terminals may also sell lottery tickets.\nYou can also order tickets online through Jackpocket, the official digital lottery courier of the USA TODAY Network, in these U.S. states and territories: Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington D.C. and West Virginia.

      "text": "Can you buy Powerball tickets online? These are the states that allow it\nI used to think I was clever passing up convenience-store or gas-station lines by buying Powerball or Mega Millions tickets at my local grocery store. People rarely stood in front of the big lottery machine, which quickly gobbled down my dollars and spat out my tickets.\nBut then I started thinking: \"My state offers online sports betting now. Can I also buy lottery tickets online?\"\nThe answer: Yes, it does let me buy lottery tickets online.\nBut online lottery options aren't as common as it might seem. There's a way to play or purchase tickets online in just over half the 45 states that offer Powerball and Mega Millions.\nStates where you can buy Powerball and Mega Millions tickets online\nUnable to view our graphics? Click here to see them.\nWhy I purchase Powerball tickets online now\nMany state legislatures clearly recognize the value to retailers of extra shoppers buying lottery tickets \u2013 especially when jackpots grow over $1 billion as Powerball is now.\nBut for someone like me who is allergic to standing in lines and wants control of his number selection, the retail environment is not for me. And, yes, I understand how terrible the odds are for anyone playing Powerball or Mega Millions \u2013 regardless of how much I think I'm gaming the game.\nBesides being convenient, online lotteries let you visit several websites, including ours to make a slightly more educated guesses about which numbers might win.\nNote: Several states that don't offer online purchases do have apps that allow you to select your numbers. Those numbers can be transmitted to lottery machines or a cashier when purchasing your tickets.\nState lotteries where you can play Powerball and Mega Millions\nThe map above seems simple enough, but only 10 states' lotteries actually allow online purchases. Click on any of the 10 boxes below to visit the states' online web sites.\nWhere can you buy lottery tickets from lottery couriers\nIf your state's lottery doesn't offer an online option, a few other businesses such as Jackpocket and TheLotter are filling that void in 18 other places.

      "text": "First time playing the Powerball? Here's exactly how to ask the cashier for a ticket.\nThe Powerball jackpot continues to grow, reaching an estimated $1 billion ahead of the next drawing Wednesday night.\nThe current jackpot is the seventh largest U.S. lottery jackpot and third largest Powerball jackpot ever, according to lottery officials. It is second only to the $2.04 billion Powerball jackpot won in 2022 and the $1.586 billion Powerball jackpot, which was won in 2016.\nWhile there are regular Powerball players, a giant jackpot seems to get new players flocking to retailers to buy tickets \u2013 and they may not know what to say or how to play. We're here to help.\nHere\u2019s everything to know before stopping by your local store to buy a ticket.\nFeeling Lucky? Explore the Latest Lottery News & Results\nHow do you ask the cashier for a Powerball ticket?\nBuying a Powerball ticket can be a simple process if you know what you're doing.\nTo buy a ticket in-person, you can either ask for a \"Quick Pick\", where a computer will generate numbers randomly, or you can pick the numbers yourself. The cashier will also ask about \"power play.\" For an extra dollar, you may choose to \"power play,\" which multiplies all non-grand prize winnings by a factor of 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10.\nFor \"Quick Pick,\" say this: \"I'd like a quick pick Powerball ticket.\" Then tell the cashier whether you want the multiplier or \"power play.\"\nTo pick your own numbers, say this: \"I'd like a Powerball ticket and I will pick my numbers.\"\nWith this option, you will fill out a playslip with your selections. Slips may also be up for grabs on the store floor, so you could fill it out before approaching the cashier. You will need to pick six Powerball numbers total: Five numbers between 1-69 and the Powerball number, which is one number between 1-26. Hand your slip to the cashier and you will receive a printout of those numbers. Again, you can choose to \"power play\" or not.\nNeed help choosing numbers? These are the most commonly drawn numbers.\nThe Powerball also offers \"double play,\" an add-on feature with a cash prize up to $10 million. For an additional $1 per play, \"double play\" gives players in select jurisdictions another chance to match Powerball numbers in a separate drawing, which happens after the regular Powerball drawing.\nHow much are Powerball tickets?\nPowerball tickets are $2 per play.\nThe \"power play\" is an additional $1 per play, and can multiply non-jackpot prizes by 2, 3, 4, 5 or 10 times. \"Double play\" is also an additional $1 per play if selected, thus a single ticket could cost $4 if the player adds both \"power play\" and \"double play.\"\nThere are 23 states where it's allowed to buy lottery tickets with a credit card, according to NerdWallet. The other 22 states that offer the lottery can vary in what they accept for payment, from only cash to debit cards, gift cards and more.

      "text": "'Keep it quiet:' Here's what to know and do if you win the Mega Millions jackpot\nWhether you bought a ticket yourself or got some as a stocking stuffer, could that $1.15 billion Mega Millions jackpot have your name on it? The odds may be against you \u2212 like 1 in 302.6 million \u2212 but that doesn't mean you can't prepare.\nIf there is a winner, Mega Millions jackpot would be the fifth-largest jackpot in Mega Millions history, making the take-home prize a lump-sum payment of an estimated $516.1 million after taxes. How do you even begin to get ready for a windfall like that?\nThe \"smartest thing\" you can do, in the event that you do win, is keep calm and carry on, financial advisers shared with USA TODAY back in March. And avoid posting any and all details of your win on social media.\n\"If you\u2019re lucky enough to win the lottery, keep it quiet,\" Rob Burnette, an Ohio-based financial adviser at Outlook Financial Center. \"Get organized and make a plan. Consider staying anonymous, if it\u2019s a possibility.\u201d\nWho, if anyone, do I tell about my Mega Millions win?\nIf you find yourself in a situation where you stand to inherit millions of dollars, the best people to get in touch with financial experts right off the bat so scammers don't get the chance to bleed you dry before you even get the chance to cash in.\n\"Crooks usually try to get you to wire money for 'taxes' or 'fees,' or may try to get you to provide them with a bank account number, which they will then clean out,\" Mega Millions said. \"No real lottery tells winners to put up their own money in order to collect a prize they have already won.\"\nNo Mega Millions representative would ever call, text, or e-mail anyone about winning a prize so be especially wary of who contact you out of the blue. In certain states, you can remain anonymous if you win.\nSteve Azoury, owner of Azoury Financial in Troy, Michigan, who has advised many lottery winners, including a $181 million winner \"who said \u2018If I didn\u2019t know you before, I don\u2019t want to know you now.\u2019\u201d\nSpend your money smarter: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.\n\"Get a tax attorney and a tax accountant right off the bat and then a financial adviser,\u201d according to Azoury. \u201cThey\u2019ll work hand in hand to figure out the plan.\u201d\nThe \"plan\" will help you get some things squared away, such as whether you will opt to take an immediate cash payout, or if you'd prefer the cash distributed over time.\nThe difference between the two is outlined below:\n- An annuity option makes an initial annual payment followed by 29 annual payments. Each payment is 5% larger than the previous one.\n- The cash option is a one-time, lump-sum payment equal to all the cash in the jackpot prize pool. At Tuesday's drawing, it's $413.5 million.\nThe decision, though, will likely depend on your goals, your age, and what lottery rules are for beneficiaries to continue receiving payments, or if you\u2019d likely squander a lump sum. The size of the lottery winning as well as your current and projected earnings are some things to consider, according to Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt.\nYour financial expert, or experts can also help you find a \"fall guy,\" a person or adviser \"who keeps you from giving loans to anybody, who tells people all the money\u2019s tied up in investments, not available,\" Azoury said. \"We have nothing available to help you out, and we\u2019re not interested in your project.\u201d\nHow do I decide what to do with my Mega Millions win?\nOnly you and your financial adviser, or advisers can help you figure out the best way to protect you and your money.\nMost people won't claim their prize right away, taking some time to figure out a plan that's right for them. Mega Millions claim periods, which ranges from 90 days to one year from the drawing date, varies from state to state.\n\"Winning tickets must be redeemed in the state in which they were purchased, but lotteries typically have a claim-by-mail option for most prize levels,\" Mega Millions said.\nBut it might be in your best interest to \"park\" the earnings until you are able to hire and meet with a financial adviser, tax accountant and attorney that's right for you.\n\"One suggestion would be putting your winnings in a brokerage account, as many brokerage firms can spread the cash deposits across multiple banks,\" according to Azoury. \"Within one brokerage account, up to $4 million can be insured, if single, and up to $8 million can be insured on a joint account.\"\nHow much of my Mega Millions win will I take home? And when do I get it?\nThe exact amount you stand to net will vary, depending on the state you win the Mega Millions jackpot in. Lottery-related regulations and laws are different from state to state. While there is no hard and fast timeframe for the claimed prize to make its way to you, it shouldn't take more than a \"couple of weeks,\" Azoury said.\nYou\u2019ll likely be propelled into the highest federal tax bracket, if you win the lottery. The state where you live and the place where you bought the winning ticket can greatly impact what you pay in taxes and how many, if any other states you will have to file taxes in.\nCalifornia is one a dozen states, including Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming, that does not tax lottery winnings.\n\u201cThis is where a tax professional really comes in handy,\u201d Steber says. \u201cState taxes can be very tricky.\nWhen is the next Mega Millions drawing? And how do I play?\nThe next drawing, where the winning numbers for the $1.15 billion jackpot will be determined, is Friday, Dec. 27 at 11 p.m. ET. Mega Millions drawings take place every Tuesday and Friday at 11 p.m. ET. Tickets are available up to 15 minutes before the drawing takes place.\nIn order to win the jackpot, you must match all six winning numbers in a drawing. That being said, players may pick up to six numbers from two separate number pools.\nFive of the numbers will come from white balls whose numbers range between 1 to 70 and the last number will come from the gold Mega Ball whose numbers range between 1 and 25. Players may also select the \"Easy Pick\" or \"Quick Pick\" options, which will have the computer randomly generate six-number sequence.\nThe \"Megaplier,\" a $1 add-on feature, that can increase non-jackpot prizes by 2, 3, 4 or 5 times. Before each regular Mega Millions drawing, the Megaplier is drawn. From a pool of 15 balls, six are marked with \"3X,\" five are marked with \"2X,\" three with \"4X\" and one with \"5X.\"\nWhere can I buy lottery tickets?\nLottery tickets can be found and purchased from local convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores or purchased online \u2212 in a handful of states. Some airport terminals may even sell lottery tickets, too.\nYou can also order tickets online through Jackpocket, the official digital lottery courier of the USA TODAY Network, in these U.S. states and territories: Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Texas, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia.

At no time will Non-Winning Tickets be available for in-person pick up or mailing.\nJACKPOCKET IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE PAYMENT OR NON-PAYMENT OF ANY WINNING TICKET WHERE THE PRIZE EXCEEDS THE IN-STORE REDEMPTION THRESHOLD. FOR ANY WINNING TICKET THAT EXCEEDS THE IN-STORE REDEMPTION THRESHOLD, THE LOTTERY THAT ISSUED SUCH WINNING TICKET IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PAYMENT OR NON-PAYMENT OF ALL PRIZES FOR THAT TICKET. BY USING THE APPLICATION, YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY CLAIM AGAINST JACKPOCKET, AND AGREE TO RELEASE AND HOLD HARMLESS JACKPOCKET FROM ANY AND ALL LIABILITY, CLAIMS, ACTIONS, PROCEEDINGS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES OR SETTLEMENTS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, WHICH DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISE FROM, ARE RELATED TO, OR ARE BASED UPON THE PAYMENT OR NON-PAYMENT OF PRIZES FOR ANY WINNING TICKET THAT EXCEEDS THE IN-STORE REDEMPTION THRESHOLD.\nc. Prohibition on Claiming Winning Tickets. You are prohibited from claiming, or attempting to claim, any Winning Tickets in any manner that is inconsistent with the terms of this Section 8. In the event you claim, or attempt to claim, any Winning Ticket in a manner that is inconsistent with this Section, you agree that Jackpocket will have no liability to you with respect to such Winning Ticket, including, without limitation, the obligation to deposit any winnings into your Account associated with such Winning Ticket. Additionally, in the event that you and Jackpocket both claim the prize for any Winning Ticket, Jackpocket has the right to immediately remove any associated winnings from your Account and suspend or terminate your Account. You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Jackpocket for any claims, losses, expenses and all other liabilities Jackpocket incurs as a result of your failure to comply with these Terms of Service.\nd. Winning Ticket is a Bearer Instrument. Note that your ticket is held in trust by Jackpocket as the courier, and a Ticket is a bearer instrument within the meaning of all applicable law, such that the holder of the ticket is presumed to be the owner of the ticket with all applicable rights in the ticket and its proceeds. Therefore, if you obtain possession of your Winning Ticket, do not lose your Ticket or allow others to possess your Ticket. Jackpocket attempts to mitigate this risk by placing the winning customer's name on the back of the Ticket following the ticket being deemed a Winning Ticket, however Jackpocket cannot be held responsible for any lost or stolen tickets or other tickets that, for whatever reason, are not in the winning customer's possession.\n9. SMART ORDERS\na. Overview of the Smart Order Feature\nJackpocket offers a feature that enables eligible Users to schedule recurring Ticket orders based on preferences they set (\"Smart Order\").

For certain Lotteries, Smart Order allows Users to set a jackpot threshold, where Smart Order will only place an order for that Lottery when the jackpot meets or exceeds the dollar amount selected through Smart Order. For example only, if a User sets a $500 million jackpot threshold for a specific Lottery, Smart Order will not place an order unless and until the jackpot for that Lottery reaches at least $500 million.\nJackpocket may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Smart Order feature, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason or no reason, in its sole and absolute discretion.\nb.

You authorize Jackpocket to initiate such recurring charges as part of your use of Smart Order.\nThe exact timing of order placement may vary depending on when a User's Smart Order is processed and the specific criteria a User has selected.\nIf your selected payment method cannot be charged at the time an order is triggered to be placed through Smart Order, including, but not limited to, due to insufficient funds or an expired payment method, that individual Smart Order will not be placed. Jackpocket will not attempt to place an individual order again in the event your selected payment method cannot be charged at the time of that individual order, but the Smart Order will remain active and future orders will be attempted based on your selected criteria in accordance with your Smart Order. For more information about how payment failures, chargebacks, or insufficient funds are handled, including potential fees and account actions, see Section 5(g): (Chargebacks/Insufficient Fund Charges) of these Terms of Service.\nYou are solely responsible for ensuring that your selected payment method remains valid and has sufficient funds while your Smart Order is in place.\nJackpocket is not responsible for any failure to place any order related to A SMART ORDER.\nd.

The Smart Order will be paused until you proactively toggle the \"Smart Order Enabled\" switch back to on.\nYou cannot edit the criteria of an existing Smart Order. If you wish to make changes to the criteria of an existing Smart Order-including, but not limited to, selecting a different Lottery, jackpot threshold, or number of Tickets-you must cancel the existing Smart Order and create a new one with your updated preferences.\nAny cancellations of a Smart Order will take effect immediately for all future orders that have not yet been triggered or placed through the Smart Order. Once a Ticket order has been placed through a Smart Order that order is final and cannot be cancelled or changed by you.\ne. Lottery Ticket Price Increase\nIn the event a Lottery increases the cost of any Ticket(s), any Smart Orders related to such Ticket(s) will continue at the increased price, and you will be charged and authorize Jackpocket to charge your selected payment method for the increased price, whether or not you have been notified of such price increase by Jackpocket, unless you cancel the Smart Order.\nf.

PREPAID ORDERS\na. Overview of Prepaid Orders\nJackpocket offers a feature that allows eligible Users to prepay for Ticket orders in advance of future Designated Drawings (\"Prepaid Orders\"). With a Prepaid Order, Users pay a one-time, upfront amount, including any applicable service fee(s), for a set number of Tickets to future Designated Drawings. Jackpocket will then place the corresponding Ticket orders on the User's behalf until the prepaid balance has been fully used.\nOnce a Prepaid Order is confirmed and payment is successfully processed, no additional charges will be applied for the applicable Designated Drawings. Prepaid Orders are not recurring and will automatically conclude once the prepaid balance of the Prepaid Order has been fully used.\nJackpocket may modify, suspend, or discontinue the Prepaid Order feature at any time, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason or no reason, in its sole and absolute discretion, with or without notice to you.\nb.

Lottery Ticket Price Increase\nIn the event a Lottery increases the cost of any Ticket(s) related to a Prepaid Order, Jackpocket will automatically cancel the remaining unfulfilled portion of the Prepaid Order and issue you a pro rata refund of the Prepaid Order based on the number of Designated Drawings remaining after the price increase.\nFor example, if you prepaid for 10 Tickets to Designated Drawings and a price increase occurs after 5 Tickets have been ordered, Jackpocket will cancel the remaining 5 Tickets and refund to you half of the payment you made for such Prepaid Order.\nIn the event your Prepaid Order is canceled due to a Lottery increasing the cost of Tickets, you may place a new order at the updated Ticket price if you choose to do so.\nf.
