  "title": "Revel is ending its ridesharing operation to focus on EV charging",
  "description": "Revel Transit is winding down its ridesharing business, choosing to shift focus to EV charging. It has faced stiff competition in its home city of NYC.",
  "content": "Revel Transit is shutting down its rideshare operation in NYC, as reported by Bloomberg. The company will instead focus its efforts on EV charging. It's also seeking buyers for its fleet, including the 165 for-hire vehicle license plates it owns.\n\n\"At the end of the day, rideshare is a very competitive market and asset-heavy. It\u2019s low margin,\" CEO Frank Reig said. \u201cWe have made the difficult decision that the best way we can keep the EV transition moving forward is by ending our rideshare service and focusing on building the fast-charging infrastructure our biggest cities need to keep going electric.\u201d\n\nThe company was the first in NYC to operate an all-electric ridehailing fleet, launching with just 50 vehicles but eventually growing to 500 vehicles. However, that's a drip in the bucket compared to rivals like Uber and Lyft. Revel averages about 100,000 rides per month, but Uber and Lyft complete more than 20 million trips each month.\n\nRevel did find success with its EV chargers, after unveiling the platform back in 2021. It operates more than 100 chargers across five stations in NYC, along with a dozen or so more chargers in San Francisco. These stations are primarily used by Uber and Lyft drivers. It hopes to have 400 charging stalls by the end of next year and 2,000 by 2030 in markets like NYC, Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\n\u201cUber and Lyft are electrifying fast and they\u2019re providing a ton of utilization for our chargers on a much larger scale than even two or three years ago,\" Reig said.\n\nThis is just the latest pivot by Revel. The company once operated a moped rental service, but that was shuttered last year. It also laid off drivers to transition to a contractor-based model like Uber and Lyft.",

      "text": "Revel plans to build a network of EV fast-charging stations in NYC\nIt says the first site will be North America's largest universal fast charging station.\nElectric scooter company Revel is moving into EV charging. It's building its first universal fast charging site in Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant in Brooklyn, which it claims will be the largest such hub in North America with 30 chargers. The station will be open around the clock and the chargers are compatible with all electric vehicle models.\nThe hub will open in the spring at a former Pfizer building and it will initially have 10 chargers. Rather than making its own chargers, Revel is using Tritium\u2019s RTM75 system, which can deliver output of up to 920V and 180A DC via CCS connections and up to 500V and 125A through CHAdeMO. Revel says the chargers can provide EVs with up to 100 miles' worth of juice in 20 minutes.\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Revel's claim about the site becoming the largest universal fast charging station on the continent holds up. Some Tesla Supercharger locations have more chargers (though, of course, they\u2019re not universal ones) while one site in Pasadena, California has 20 universal fast chargers and 24 Superchargers.\nRevel plans to build more fast charging hubs across New York City. It's not always possible for people to have a charger at home, so it\u2019s important to have stations like these, particularly in densely populated cities, in the effort to boost the adoption of EVs."

  "argos_summary": "Revel Transit is discontinuing its rideshare service in NYC to concentrate on developing EV charging infrastructure, citing the competitive and low-margin nature of the rideshare market. The company, which previously operated an all-electric fleet, plans to expand its network of fast-charging stations, starting with a hub in Brooklyn that will feature 30 chargers. Revel aims to increase its charging stations significantly by 2030, responding to the growing demand for EV infrastructure in urban areas.",
