  "description": "\"Biggest Loser\" trainer Bob Harper opened up about his 2017 heart attack, including the reaction of his costar Jillian Michaels.",
  "content": "On \"The Biggest Loser,\" Bob Harper helped people transform their physical health. But the fitness trainer is nursing an emotional wound.\n\nHarper, who served as a trainer and later host on the hit NBC reality competition series, opened up about his 2017 heart attack, including the reaction of his costar Jillian Michaels, in an Aug. 14 interview with The Guardian. Michaels served as a fellow trainer alongside Harper for much of the Emmy-nominated series' 16-year run.\n\nIn February 2017, Harper suffered a heart attack during a workout in New York City. He told TMZ at the time that after he collapsed at the gym, a doctor who was there performed CPR on him.\n\nIn his interview with The Guardian, Harper said that while many of his \"Biggest Loser\" colleagues reached out after his medical ordeal, Michaels notably did not.\n\n\"We weren't besties, but we were partners on a television show for a very long time,\" Harper told the British outlet, adding that the absence \"spoke volumes to me.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to representatives for Michaels for comment.\n\nDespite the emotional fallout, Harper said he \"would not expect Jillian Michaels to do anything other than what she wants to do.\"\n\nIn a December 2017 essay for Today.com, Harper reflected that his heart attack on Feb. 12 of that year was \"a day that changed my life forever.\"\n\n\"I have always been what some would categorize as a Type A person. I have been driven, and I have been focused,\" Harper wrote. \"I knew that I would be working out almost every single day. I knew that my diet would be on point. I knew that I would be burning the candle at both ends. I have always loved structure and discipline.\"\n\nHowever, Harper said the health crisis inspired a shift in his outlook toward \"appreciation and gratitude,\" rather than constant productivity.\n\n\"I know how short life can be. I know that it could all be taken away in the blink of an eye,\" Harper added. \"Now when something triggers me, I try to say to myself, 'Who cares!!' It just doesn't matter. I know that I'm not perfect, and I know that life is a process. I just take it one day at a time. And that feels good to me.\"",

      "text": "Fitness trainer Bob Harper's dogs provided emotional support during his recovery from a massive heart attack\nWhen fitness icon Bob Harper collapsed onto the floor of a New York City gym in February 2017, his adoring dog, Karl, sat patiently in the corner as he always did, waiting for his owner to finish his strenuous workout.\nOn this day, however, the loyal 10-year old Havanese mix would have to wait for one of Harper\u2019s friends to take him home from the gym. The former trainer and host of NBC\u2019s The Biggest Loser, Harper, 52, had a near-fatal \u201cwidow-maker\u201d heart attack and was in full cardiac arrest \u2014 his heart stopped. To put it simply, he was dead.\nHe was also very lucky. A doctor happened to be at the gym and administered CPR and activated an automated external defibrillator, delivering a powerful electric shock to try to restore a normal heart rhythm. Paramedics who arrived used the device a third time before carefully moving Harper to a gurney for hospital transport.\nBecause of his dedication to fitness, Harper seemed among the least likely to have a heart attack, which was ultimately caused by high levels of Lipoprotein(a) or Lp(a) in his blood, a genetic condition that results in excessive amounts of cholesterol in the arteries. Diet, exercise and even lipid-lowering medications have little effect on those levels, which increase the risk of serious cardiovascular problems. Harper was aware that relatives had died of heart attacks, but had no idea he had the condition.\nThe Best Medicine\nLooking back, Harper remembers fainting after a workout six weeks prior to his collapse, and some dizzy spells, but at the time he didn\u2019t really attribute these events to a specific cause.\n\u201cWhen I woke up after two days in a coma in the hospital, I faced the fact that life can turn on a dime,\u201d he says. \u201cI was very depressed. Now I\u2019m super appreciative of the time I have, and I want to focus on making the most of every day.\u201d\nHe\u2019s stayed strong and motivated throughout his recovery process, in part because he wants to experience more joy with his two dogs, Karl Lagerfeld and Vivienne Westwood \u2014 named for two of Harper\u2019s favorite fashion designers.\nTwo days before he was discharged from the hospital, Harper had a surprise visitor. \u201cFriends brought Karl to the hospital, and I feel like it was the best medicine Bob got,\u201d says friend Kate Angelo of Los Angeles, who with mutual pal Cristi Conaway-Murphy, headed for the Big Apple as soon as they learned of Harper\u2019s heart attack.\n\u201cAll the color came back to his cheeks \u2014 just pure joy. Karl brought him step-by-step back to his old self,\u201d Angelo says.\nConaway-Murphy has seen firsthand how near and dear Harper\u2019s dogs are to him, and how pivotal they have been to his mental and physical recovery. \u201cStudies show you\u2019ll live longer if you have a dog,\u201d she notes. \u201cDogs do brighten everyone\u2019s day.\u201d\nSaving Each Other\nAmerica\u2019s beloved trainer was raised on a cattle farm in Nashville, Tenn. \u201cI used to watch my mom make big baby bottles to feed the calves,\u201d he says. \u201cI got my first dog, Waldo, a German shepherd, when I was a kid, maybe (age) 8 or 9, and I loved him. He was such a great little dog, and I think that\u2019s when my love affair with dogs began.\u201d\nHe adopted Karl in 2010 from a Los Angeles-based dog rescue organization after a friend insisted that, \u201cYou need to meet this dog.\u201d\n\u201cHe was found on the streets of Baldwin Hills in South LA, and he was just so emotionally broken and catatonic when I met him,\u201d Harper says. \u201cI was going to save him, and now, it\u2019s Karl who\u2019s saved me.\u201d\nHarper remembers the first time Karl wagged his tail \u2014 a few weeks after he adopted him. \u201cIt was amazing, because he was just so afraid,\u201d he says. \u201cI took him everywhere with me and just kept holding him. I had no expectations, really, but we were always so bonded.\u201d\nHis canine companion is not a purebred Havanese, says Harper, but he does exhibit many of the breed\u2019s desirable character traits. \u201cHe\u2019s so devoted. He\u2019s a good watchdog, and he doesn\u2019t shed \u2014 so he\u2019s hypoallergenic. He\u2019s regal, stoic and eager to sit on my lap all day if I let him.\u201d\nDuring Harper\u2019s slow and arduous recovery, when even walking around the block was at first a behemoth challenge, Karl was by Harper\u2019s side. \u201cIt was the only exercise I was allowed to do, and I had an identity crisis. It was really hard on me emotionally to try and be OK with not going to the gym.\u201d\nAnd Vivienne Makes Three\nAs Harper got stronger, he began walking faster and more frequently than Karl was capable of doing. Then someone told him about a purebred Havanese in a pet store in the New York City enclave of Chelsea, and that the dog had been there six months.\nHe says he wouldn\u2019t typically purchase a dog from a store, opting to adopt a rescue instead, however, last June, his curiosity piqued. Against the caution of friends who thought he shouldn\u2019t take on any more stress, Harper optimistically met Vivienne, which he describes as a \u201cbundle of energy, smart and independent.\u201d\nStore management told Bob that if he reimbursed them for her vaccinations and spay that he could just take her. Their encounter was definitely meant to be. Vivienne, now almost 2 year old, is also \u201cobsessed with Karl, and with food,\u201d says Harper. \u201cAt first, (he) wasn\u2019t having any part of her, but now they\u2019re really attached to each other.\u201d\nKarl has taken on new youthfulness, he says, and runs joyfully around to keep up with her.\n\u201cShe loves everyone and wants to jump on them to say \u2018Hi!\u2019\u201d Harper says. \u201cUnlike Karl, she wants to sit at my feet like I\u2019m Cuban royalty.\u201d Harper is considered fitness royalty by many, and although The Biggest Loser was canceled in mid-2017, Harper will forever be associated with the transformational TV series that ran for 17 seasons.\n\u201cI\u2019d been a trainer in LA for such a long time, working with so many celebrities and agents,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen the show was first discussed, my name got thrown into the mix with many trainers, and after six weeks of auditions, I got the job.\u201d\nFor now, Harper stays busy with the dogs, with appearances on television and radio, and with promotional appearances for his newest book, The Super Carb Diet, which hit bookshelves in late December.\nIt\u2019s OK to Miss a Workout\nThe nutrition expert is still eating a balanced diet, he says, with more plant-based foods for optimum heart health. It also includes fish, chicken, egg whites and Greek yogurt. And he doesn\u2019t freak out if he misses a workout.\n\u201cWorkouts are still very important, but they don\u2019t rule me anymore,\u201d he says. \u201cYesterday, I walked a lot in the city. It was enough for me and very liberating. I do yoga and CrossFit, but not at such a high intensity as before \u2014 I just do them longer. I\u2019m also doing Soul Cycle, and I started boxing again.\u201d\nDuring recovery, Harper and his close friend, Sean Stephens, who was with him when he had his heart attack, worked out together, away from the crowd, until Harper\u2019s confidence returned and he\u2019d mended his relationship with the gym.\n\u201cAt first, I was very afraid of being there,\u201d Harper says. \u201cMy former happy place was a fearful place, the place where I dropped dead. Nice people would ask how I was, and it made me anxious.\u201d\nToday, he works out with Vivienne and Karl in tow, Stephens says. \u201cVivienne brought a breath of fresh air to Bob\u2019s life. Their companionship helped him become himself again, and as his friend, it made me so happy to see that. He\u2019s recovered now and back to being as healthy as he can be.\u201d\nHarper adores both dogs and likes to spoil them with regular pampering appointments. \u201cOur groomer, Shiro at Dogma (in New York City), does a really great job,\u201d Harper says. \u201cNothing makes me happier than when they are bathed and fluffy. Karl has straight hair, and Vivienne\u2019s hair is crazy soft, almost like a poodle\u2019s.\u201d\nEven though his trusted companions are living in style, Harper feels he\u2019s truly the lucky one. \u201cI am so appreciative of them and the wonderful, unconditional love they give me and that I can give them,\u201d he says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier and luckier that both these dogs have come into my life.\u201d"

      "text": "Jillian Michaels 'would love to leave weight loss drugs behind' in 2024. Here's why.\nWeight less drugs like Ozempic popped up everywhere in 2023. But health and wellness expert Jillian Michaels would like them (mostly) gone for good in 2024.\n\"I would love to leave weight loss drugs behind except for life-or-death interventions,\" the former \"The Biggest Loser\" trainer told USA TODAY in an interview ahead of the new year. It comes as big-shot celebrities like Oprah have embraced the practice despite its controversies.\nMichaels is encouraging people get back to basics in 2024 and avoid falling prey to potentially problematic trends. \"The problem with trends is that they never pan out,\" she says. \"And they take people so far off the path to a real solution with confusion and backsliding.\"\nJillian Michaels has 'zero judgment' for those who use weight loss drugs\nDrugs such as Ozempic, Wegovy and Mounjaro can help someone lose 15% to 20% of their body weight \u2013 as much as 60 pounds for someone who started at 300.\nWeight loss medications work by sending signals to the appetite center of the brain to reduce hunger and increase fullness, according to Dr. Deborah Horn, an assistant professor of surgery at the McGovern Medical School at UTHealth Houston. Once a person stops taking the drug, that effect is gone, paving the way for some people to regain what they lost if they don't adjust their diet and exercise patterns.\nIt's not clear whether the newer generation of weight loss drugs, which suppress appetite, will provide different long-term results than other weight loss approaches.\nIn the longest study, lasting 68 weeks \u2013 about 16 months \u2013 weight loss plateaued and started to climb again by the end, suggesting people's bodies had acclimated to the drugs. Side effects from Ozempic run the gamut \u2013 from losing too much weight, to gaining it all back, to plateauing. Not to mention the nausea, diarrhea and other gastrointestinal issues.\nBefore taking a weight loss drug, Michaels suggests looking into supplements like berberine and yerba mate tea as alternatives. She also recommends checking in with a doctor before supplementing one's diet. \"I have no problem with people taking these formulas,\" she says. \"But somebody just needs to make sure that they're doing your bloodwork regularly, and that your hormones are actually balanced in an optimal way.\"\nStill, Michaels holds \"zero judgment\" for those who use these drugs as part of their weight loss arsenal. She \"just would like people to try every other way forward first.\"\n'There's no secret' to weight loss\nSome of those ways forward: eating less (what weight loss drugs can help with), avoiding added sugars and moving more. Of course, it's easier said than done, and will not yield the same results for everyone.\n\"We don't want people eating so little that they're not getting enough nutrients,\" Michaels says. \"But what these drugs have shown is that it doesn't matter your age, menopause, no menopause, this that the other, if you are eating a bit less food, and moving a bit more often, you can absolutely manage your weight.\"\nMoving more \"doesn't mean go crazy at 50 in a way you never have,\" she adds. \"It means obviously work to your current fitness level. But there are no types of fitness that are out of bounds as you age \u2013 quite the opposite.\" Think high intensity interval training and strength training. Intermittent fasting can also help with weight loss.\nLosing weight grows harder as one ages. A 30-year-old might burn 2,000 calories a day, for example, compared to a 50-year-old burning 1,300 calories. If that's the case, you need to exercise more and avoid eating everything you did in your 30s. Her 13-year-old can eat her entire refrigerator, she jokes, but she can only eat the rail on the right door.\n\"That is the science of it,\" she says. \"There's no secret to it.\" This diligence will come in handy once women hit menopause and undergo hormone changes: \"There is no like, 'Oh, I hit menopause and now it's a slow descent into decrepitude,'\" Michaels says \"It's just not true. Jane Fonda looked amazing \u2013 she still does!\"\nShe knows that curbing one's diet of added sugars isn't ideal. But in her opinion, it might be the alternative: \"Does it suck? Yes, but it's a lot better than taking a drug that's going to have crazy side effects that you can never get off of, and you'll eventually plateau on.\"\nContributing: Karen Weintraub and Katie Camero"

      "text": "In Netflix\u2019s new documentary about The Biggest Loser, Joelle Gwynn, a contestant on the televised weight-loss competition, has a message for her former fitness trainer: \u2018Fuck you, Bob Harper.\u2019 Gwynn was a contestant on the US show in 2008, and she has just watched a clip of Harper screaming at her to \u201cshut the fuck up\u201d after she failed to run on a treadmill for the specified time. \u201cOh, and your little dog too,\u201d she adds.\nThe Biggest Loser was a phenomenally successful TV show. It ran for 18 seasons in the US, attracting more than 10 million viewers in its prime and spawning more than 30 international versions, including a UK iteration presented in 2012 by Davina McCall.\nThe show was undeniably the making of Harper, who went from being a farmer\u2019s son who dropped out of university because he couldn\u2019t afford it, to an American household name who appeared on The Traitors US and RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. He is \u201creally proud\u201d of the years he worked on \u201cLoser\u201d, as he refers to it, and has little time for its critics.\n\u201cThat Joelle, she just does not like me, does she?\u201d he says with a grin when he speaks to me via Zoom, having just finished watching Fit for TV: The Reality of the Biggest Loser, the new documentary in which he also appears. He is calling from his chic, monochrome New York apartment, where his \u201clittle dog\u201d, Ralph (after Ralph Lauren), is darting around behind him. Days away from his 60th birthday, the reality TV star says he has \u201clearned to not take things personally\u201d.\nFor the uninitiated, each season of The Biggest Loser was filmed over a 30-week period, and brought together a group of people who wanted to lose weight (and who, like all good reality TV contestants, often had deeply harrowing back stories). Contact with their friends and families was cut off, and they were sent to live on a ranch, put into teams and assigned a trainer (such as Harper), who guided them through an intense workout schedule. Outside the gym, the teams faced \u201cchallenges\u201d and \u201ctemptations\u201d for which they could win prizes or immunity from elimination. Each week, the contestants were weighed, and those who had lost the lowest proportion of their previous body weight risked being sent home. At the end of the season, $250,000 was awarded to the remaining contestant who had lost the most weight.\nThe rigid format meant that being as thin as possible \u2013 not necessarily as healthy as possible, though contestants were monitored by health professionals \u2013 became the primary goal of the show, and huge emphasis was placed on the way contestants looked, with dolled-up finalists walking on stage alongside sad, washed-out holograms of their pre-show selves.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all obsessed with our looks,\u201d Harper says in Fit for TV. \u201cBecause aren\u2019t we?\u201d he says when I ask him about it. \u201cI know that probably sounds really shallow, but I have worked in the fitness business for a long, long time. And yes, I want to be as healthy as I possibly can\u201d, as do \u201call the people that I\u2019ve ever worked with\u201d, but looks are \u201ca huge part of it \u2026 I want to look good when I go to the beach.\u201d\nHarper\u2019s own looks were also important when it came to The Biggest Loser. The roles played by him and Jillian Michaels, the show\u2019s other original trainer, partly involved being eye candy for viewers: thin, ripped examples of what the show deemed to be desirable. Harper has a number of tattoos, which were \u201ca real issue\u201d with the producers, \u201cbecause they didn\u2019t know what the American audience would or would not respond to\u201d. He was made to wear long sleeves to cover them up \u2013 until, Harper says, on one non-shooting day: \u201cI didn\u2019t have a shirt on when I was training and they saw me and they were like, \u2018Oh, he looks great. He can show whatever he wants.\u2019\u201d\nProducers also worried about him talking about being gay on the show. Harper came out at 15, but didn\u2019t discuss it publicly until a conversation he had with a gay contestant was shown on The Biggest Loser in 2013. \u201cEveryone was kind of nervous about that,\u201d he says, but his view was: \u201cWhy would I not talk about it? I\u2019m not ashamed of who I am. I never have been.\u201d\nBorn in rural Tennessee, Harper says he was \u201cdefinitely different\u201d from his parents and two older sisters, and as a young adult he moved an hour south to Nashville to look for work. The owner of his local gym took him under her wing, and he began teaching fitness classes, which took him to Los Angeles, where his clients included Julia Roberts and Ellen DeGeneres. Thanks to the film stars and Hollywood agents who attended his classes, his name was put forward when producers began discussing The Biggest Loser, and he went on to become the only trainer to appear in all 17 seasons, between 2004 and 2016, as well as the one-season 2020 reboot, in which he was the show\u2019s presenter.\nThe Biggest Loser \u201cwas the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done,\u201d Harper says. Even on \u201cdark days\u201d when there was no filming, the trainer was busy leading \u201cmore sensible, low-pressure workouts\u201d \u2013 those days were \u201cwhen we got all the real work done\u201d, he says. He tired himself out to the point that after one season, he got shingles, and remembers being so hungry on set that he would sometimes eat the snacks that had been provided for the contestants in temptation challenges.\n\u201cTemptations\u201d were one aspect of the show with which Harper did not agree. They involved bringing the contestants into rooms full of high-calorie food, which they had to decide whether to eat (which could win them advantages in the competition or the chance for a treat, such as visiting family) or refuse, to prevent weight gain. He tried to push back on these challenges to the producers \u201call the time\u201d, he says, but he and the other trainers \u201cdidn\u2019t have a say in it\u201d.\nSuch challenges, as well as filming techniques such as shaking the camera when a contestant fell over to make it look as if their weight had caused the ground to move, were \u201cdesigned to make you draw conclusions about fat people\u201d, says the author and activist Aubrey Gordon in Fit for TV. When I ask Harper if he thinks the show made fun of fat people, he says he can only speak for himself, but \u201cthat\u2019s something I would never do and have never done\u201d.\nI mention a study that showed an increase in anti-fat attitudes after participants had been shown episodes of The Biggest Loser. Harper hasn\u2019t heard of it, but thinks it\u2019s \u201cstupid\u201d. \u201cThe trolls that are out there just want to attack in any way, because people are going to have such a strong opinion when it comes to weight loss,\u201d he says. He is keen to share examples of people who have told him they were inspired by The Biggest Loser: \u201cI really do believe that we did help a lot of people.\u201d\nBut even if you buy into the show\u2019s \u201cinspirational\u201d message, the fact remains that most of Loser\u2019s contestants regained weight after the competition had ended. When it comes to any kind of diet or fitness regimen, \u201cthe success rate overall is very low,\u201d Harper says. \u201cIt\u2019s really sad, but it\u2019s such a reality.\u201d\nHe is much happier to talk about the show\u2019s \u201csuccess stories\u201d, like Olivia Ward, who entered season 11 of The Biggest Loser with her sister, Hannah Curlee. She won, with Curlee coming second, and later named her child Harper in honour of the trainer. \u201cI was really touched by that,\u201d Harper says, adding that he and Ward have remained friends: \u201cShe\u2019s flying in for my birthday party next Saturday.\u201d Ward \u201clooks better than ever\u201d, he is quick to tell me. \u201cAnd her sister Hannah, she looks great too.\u201d\nBy \u201cgreat\u201d, he presumably means \u201cslim\u201d \u2013 and though Harper says he is \u201ca firm believer that healthy bodies come in many shapes and many sizes\u201d, when I ask whether he agrees with Loser\u2019s simplistic categorisation of thin being good and fat being bad, he says: \u201cWell, fat is bad. Let\u2019s not kid anybody.\u201d\nHarper knows as well as anybody that those who look fit may still suffer from unexpected health problems. In 2017, at 51, he had what is known as a \u201cwidowmaker\u201d heart attack because of an undiagnosed genetic issue, which left him clinically dead on the floor of his gym for nine minutes. Luckily, there was a doctor present who performed CPR, and Harper made it to hospital in time. If it had happened while he was alone in his apartment, he says: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201d\nHaving the heart attack \u201cfucked me up\u201d, Harper says. He struggled mentally with going from being the man working out in his 50s who could keep up with 20 and 30-year-olds, to \u201ca person that couldn\u2019t walk around a city block\u201d.\nPlenty of people from The Biggest Loser got in touch when they heard what had happened \u2013 but not Michaels. \u201cWe weren\u2019t besties, but we were partners on a television show for a very long time,\u201d he says, so it \u201cspoke volumes to me\u201d that she didn\u2019t get in touch. But, he adds: \u201cI would not expect Jillian Michaels to do anything other than what she wants to do.\u201d\nMichaels was always the more headstrong of the show\u2019s original trainers, and she caused controversy in 2013 by giving rule-breaking caffeine pills to her team of contestants. Did Harper ever give his contestants any kind of supplement? \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he says.\nIn any case, the 2013 season marked the beginning of the end for Loser: on top of the furore over the caffeine pills, the show was further criticised when winner Rachel Frederickson appeared in the finale having lost a record-breaking 59.62% of her original body weight, with many viewers believing her weight loss had gone too far.\nHe and Michaels \u201cwere horrified\u201d when Frederickson appeared on stage for her final weigh-in, Harper says. He thinks her background in competitive swimming led to her extreme approach. \u201cYou talk to any person who\u2019s an athlete. That\u2019s a different breed of person,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd evidently this woman was like, I\u2019m going to win this show and I\u2019m going to do whatever it takes.\u201d\nYet his \u201chorror\u201d at Frederickson\u2019s extreme weight loss doesn\u2019t seem to have led to much reflection on his involvement in the show that encouraged her behaviour. Granted, he wasn\u2019t Frederickson\u2019s assigned trainer. Nor was he season three contestant Kai Hibbard\u2019s, he points out when I ask him how he feels about reports that Hibbard later developed an eating disorder.\nThere has also been criticism from contestants he did train, including Suzanne Mendonca, who appeared on the second season and in 2016 threatened to file a class action lawsuit against the show, complaining that she later regained 150lbs (68kg) , and that during taping she was \u201cdehydrated, vomiting and limited to eating 800 calories a day.\u201d\nThough Harper tries \u201cnot to have too many regrets in my life,\u201d he does concede that two moments that are brought up in the documentary \u2013 shouting at Gwynn and telling Mendonca that it was \u201cgood\u201d when she threw up because it would help her lose weight \u2013 were things he \u201cshouldn\u2019t have\u201d done. But, he adds: \u201cYou also have to remember, everyone that came on Loser, we were all adults.\u201d\nWell, except for the \u201ckid ambassadors\u201d, junior participants whose weight loss was documented in segments of some of the later seasons. \u201cOh, I don\u2019t really remember that,\u201d Harper says.\nDoes he think the show would get made now? He doesn\u2019t see why not, although he admits: \u201cIt would have to be completely different.\u201d But \u201cwe as a society are just as obsessed with weight loss as we have ever been,\u201d he says, pointing to the rise of weight-loss drugs. Harper doesn\u2019t necessarily promote those types of drugs, but says he is \u201cfor anything that you need to get you on the path that you want to be on\u201d.\nWhen it comes to his own path, he says he is in his \u201cretirement era\u201d, but is still enjoying teaching hot yoga classes in New York. He is single, having broken off his 2019 engagement to his long-term boyfriend Anton Gutierrez, \u201cso if you know anyone \u2026\u201d he jokes. He is content with the life he has built for himself, and seems unlikely to be affected by conversations about the ethics of Loser that Fit for TV will undoubtedly bring back into focus.\n\u201cI knew what the show represented to me,\u201d he says. \u201cI have nothing but a good experience and really good memories.\u201d"

      "text": "'The Biggest Loser' is back, and we have only one question: Why?\nFor the 12 years that \"The Biggest Loser\" aired on NBC, everyone was a loser.\nThe disgusting display of hatred of fat people, their bodies and their lives helped cement the modern stigma against them, and often ruined the health of its contestants. But for some inexplicable reason, last week USA Network premiered a revival of the reality series to traumatize us all (Tuesdays, 9 EST/PST).\nThere are plenty of good and bad TV shows these days, but it's rare to find reality TV that's actually harmful to the people involved and society as a whole. \"Loser\" is a frightening example of what can happen when our worst impulses are given airtime.\nIf you have somehow blissfully purged this awful series from your memory, here are the finer points of the weight-loss competition: A group of overweight people competes to lose the highest percentage of their body weight. Most of the episodes are devoted to watching the contestants participate in grueling exercise challenges while the trainers berate them, or watching them stand \u2013 shirtless so as much of their bodies as possible are on display \u2013 on a prop scale (a disclaimer reminds the viewer that accurate weights are determined off camera). Each week, the person who shed the least weight on a percentage basis goes home, and the last person standing wins $100,000.\n\"We did want to make a better connection or bigger connection between weight loss and health,\" USA reality programming executive Heather Olander told the Television Critics Association last month. \"The message in the show is, yes, being thin and fitting into skinny jeans \u2013 if that\u2019s what you want, fabulous. But that\u2019s not the end all, be all. It\u2019s not about getting thin at all costs. It\u2019s about getting healthy and setting these contestants on a healthy lifestyle path.\"\nTo Olander's credit, there are changes in the show. Gone are the \"temptation\" challenges, in which contestants eat junk food in exchange for game advantages. Nor do they vote each other off every week. There are on-camera \"therapy\" sessions with trainer-turned-host Bob Harper, and the losers are sent home with an after-care package that includes a gym membership and access to a nutritionist.\nBut what hasn't changed is the show's fundamental message: Fat is bad, thin is good, and happiness and acceptance are achieved only by losing weight, at whatever cost.\nThere's consistent, documented evidence that \"Loser\" was a dangerous show for contestants: some practiced unhealthy weight-loss strategies or tried to game the competition by adding pounds before competing. When they left the program, some struggled with eating disorders and weight gain. A National Institutes of Health study published in 2016 found the series had slowed the metabolisms of former contestants, making it harder to maintain their weight loss.\nThe show was not just damaging to the people who endured its brutal process. Watching the series didn't make thin people more empathetic to the lives of those with different bodies: Research found that \"anti-fat attitudes increase after brief exposure to weight-loss reality television.\"\n\"Loser\" promotes the false narrative that exercise is the most important part of weight loss, and that anyone can achieve it if they just try hard enough. Viewers see radical body transformations over just a few short weeks, and perhaps some of them assume the only reason other fat people stay fat is that they're lazy bums who refuse to try hard enough.\nIn reality, our weight is determined by a variety of contributing factors, and it varies from person to person. Genetics, socioeconomic status, preexisting medical conditions, stress and mental health affect numbers on a scale. Some people may never be able to be thin.\nAnd even if every individual defined as \"medically obese\" \u2013 some 40% of the American population, according to the CDC \u2013 wanted to lose weight, they don't have to. That's the goal of body positivity and fat acceptance movements. Overweight people shouldn't have to lose weight to be full members of society, sit on airplanes without abuse and see doctors without facing discrimination. The way someone else's body presents is no one's business but their own.\nSpouting buzzwords about \"health\" and \"lifestyle\" on the new \"Loser\" in no way covers up the crassness of the reality show in an age when reboots and revivals have become something of a default business model for Hollywood. The series is not returning so it can help people achieve healthy goals or spread positive messages: It's back to profit from the degradation of a subculture.\nOne can only hope the producers miscalculated America's desire for this kind of programming as our culture inches towards inclusivity and acceptance of all sizes. When \"Loser\" premiered in 2004, there was no \"This Is Us\" or \"Shrill.\" \"Body positivity\" wasn't a household term. Lizzo, who had her own conflict with \"Loser\" alum Jillian Michaels, wasn't yet a superstar. Late-night hosts like James Corden weren't making impassioned speeches against fat shaming.\nWe've started to make change for the better. We don't need to fight over \"Loser\" all over again."

      "text": "In February, \"The Biggest Loser\" trainer Bob Harper, 52, suffered a near-fatal heart attack. He spoke with TODAY's Savannah Guthrie two months later about the experience, recalling, \"My heart stopped. Not to be dramatic, but I was dead. I was on that ground dead.\"\nAfter the heart attack, Harper rehabbed and adopted a new fitness routine and diet. The heart attack changed his life in other ways as well. He reflects on those changes below for our 2017 Voices series, a collection of essays and interviews with the people behind some of the year\u2019s biggest news stories.\nFeb. 12, 2017, is a day that I have no recollection of at all, but it is a day that changed my life forever.\nMy name is Bob Harper. I have been a personal trainer and host of NBC\u2019s \"The Biggest Loser\" for 17 seasons. I am a New York Times bestselling author. And I\u2019ve now been initiated into a club: The Heart Attack Survivors Club.\nOn Feb. 12, I was in a gym working out \u2014 like any other day \u2014 when I dropped dead on the gym floor.\nME! The health and fitness guy. The guy whose entire career is based on getting people on the right track for health and wellness.\nI woke up two days later in a hospital surrounded by friends and family. They began filling in the missing pieces of what happened, and it was the biggest shock of my life.\nThroughout this past year the two main questions I've been asked are how my life has changed since my heart attack and cardiac arrest and what my perspective is now that I am a survivor and have been given a second chance.\nMy life is completely different now. I have always been what some would categorize as a Type A person. I have been driven and I have been focused. I knew that I would be working out almost every single day. I knew that my diet would be on point. I knew that I would be burning the candle at both ends. I have always loved structure and discipline.\nWell, let me tell you, it\u2019s all different now. My life is about appreciation and gratitude. It is about balance. And just like I said to Savannah Guthrie on TODAY last April, it\u2019s about not sweating the big things and definitely not sweating the small things. I know how short life can be. I know that it could all be taken away in the blink of an eye.\nNow when something triggers me I try to say to myself, \"WHO CARES!!\" It just doesn\u2019t matter. I know that I\u2019m not perfect and I know that life is a process. I just take it one day at a time. And that feels good to me.\nMy whole life has been devoted to helping people, and since my heart attack I have a whole new set of eyes on me and I want to do what I can to help. I am more passionate than ever to get the message out there about the importance of being CPR certified and knowing how to use an AED. Those two things, along with the quick thinking of the people around me on Feb. 12, are the reasons why I am able to write this to you now. If not for them, I would not be here. They are my angels.\nI am thankful every day for the people that I surround myself with. I am thankful for my two dogs that I love with all of my heart.\nWhat I am most thankful for is the relationship that I have built with my heart. This is gonna sound a little kooky, but bear with me for a second.\nAfter my heart attack I battled with this thought that my heart gave out on me. The one thing in my life that has always been there \u2014 through every love, every heartbreak, every brutal workout, every smile and every single tear \u2014 decided on Feb. 12 to stop on me.\nThis has been a really emotional journey because I stopped trusting my heart. I was afraid to work out. I walked the streets every day thinking to myself, \u201cAm I gonna have another heart attack??\u201d I was afraid to be alone, because if I had been alone when I had my heart attack I would have stayed dead.\nIt\u2019s been 10 months since my heart attack and I am happy to say that my heart and I are building a very strong connection with one another. I don\u2019t take my heart for granted.\nAt the end of my yoga classes, as I\u2019m laying on my back, I put my hand on my heart and I feel the strong beats and I just smile. I love my heart."

      "text": "Jillian Michaels says she left California because of 'mind-boggling' laws: 'It's madness'\nThe Golden State lost its sheen for Jillian Michaels.\nThe fitness personality, who was born in Los Angeles, opened up about what inspired her to move from her home state during an interview on \"The Sage Steele Show\" released Wednesday.\nMichaels told host Sage Steele that California \"got too crazy for me,\" citing recent legislation spanning the decriminalization of sex work and gender-affirming care for transgender children.\n\"I grew up here. I'm a woman. I'm a gay woman. My mom's a Jew. My dad's an Arab. I have a Black kid. And believe it or not, my son is half Latin, even though he doesn't look like it,\" Michaels said. \"I hold a million cards in your game of woke victimology poker. And when I leave California, maybe you've lost your (expletive) mind. Just maybe. Like, when you have me running from home, maybe it's gone way too far.\"\nJillian Michaels: Fitness personality 'would love to leave weight loss drugs behind' in 2024. Here's why.\n\"The Biggest Loser\" trainer, who now resides in Miami, went on to criticize some of California's \"mind-boggling\" laws.\n\"We're decriminalizing everything, which arguably I would probably be OK with, but we're not regulating any of it,\" Michaels said. \"So, it's like, OK, you're going to decriminalize sex work, but only so women can legally loiter on the streets, not to keep them safe, not to have them pay taxes, not to make them, you know, regularly check for STDs, not to take away the pimps out of the equation.\"\n'Good luck Florida': Scott Baio divides the internet with departure from California\nRegarding gender-affirming care, Michaels condemned legislation that allows children to \"irreparably change their bod(ies).\" As a medical practice, gender-affirming care includes everything from talk therapy to hormone therapy to (in rare instances) surgical intervention.\n\"If my son came to me and said, 'Mom' \u2014 or my daughter \u2014 'I think I'm trans.' I'd say OK, you know, like, you want to dress this way. You want me to call you whatever the heck you want, dress, fine. Explore it. I love you. I'm cool,\" Michaels said. \u201cDo you as long as we're safe, but we're not changing your body until it's fully developed. I'm sorry. Conversation's over.\u201d\nMichaels concluded: \"It's madness to me. I can go on and on and on.\""
