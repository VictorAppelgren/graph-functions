      "feedback": "The draft over‑clusters the Fed‑payroll narrative (two items with the same window and almost identical logic) and under‑cites the tariff and earnings drivers; collapse the first two into a single “Fed‑policy‑driven spx” entry, assign a 55% probability with explicit (FAN5RYW6T) citations, and replace the third item with a single “Q2 tech‑earnings rally” entry that cites the earnings‑release dates (FAN5RYW6T) and uses a 40–45% probability; remove the fourth tariff‑drift item (duplicate window, unsupported 50% figure, and no clear causal link to spx) or merge it into the Fed‑policy entry with a 30% probability and a 3–6% drag (FAN5RYW6T). Ensure every line lists a canonical handle (spx), a precise catalyst window, a clear causal chain, and a probability backed by a citation. Adjust the magnitude ranges to match the source (e.g., 1–2% rally, 3–6% decline, 8–10% severe drag) and tighten the wording to a single sentence per line.",
