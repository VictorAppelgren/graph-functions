      "summary": "South Korean convenience stores have evolved into a $25‑billion cultural phenomenon, offering a rapid‑cycle menu of instant‑ized foods, luxury goods, and even dining experiences, driven by a highly competitive retail environment that churns out up to 70 new items weekly. The industry’s expansion beyond Korea—into markets such as Hawaii, Mongolia, and Malaysia—leverages the global popularity of K‑wave content, while domestic stores serve as multifunctional social hubs and entrepreneurial opportunities for a significant share of the self‑employed workforce. This rapid innovation, coupled with social media amplification, has positioned convenience stores as a key barometer of Korean consumer trends and a catalyst for cross‑border retail growth.",
