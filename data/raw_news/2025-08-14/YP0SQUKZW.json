  "content": "While these tasks offer practical value, especially boosting efficiency, the next leap isn\u2019t just technical. Agentic AI systems can enable organizations to deploy autonomous service agents capable of managing entire organizational processes end to end.\n\n\n\nThe value of agentic AI lies in collaboration, not replacement, where humans and machines each play to their strengths. When workflows combine human judgment with machine precision, organizations can streamline tasks, innovate personalization and insights, sharpen decisions, scale, and measure outcomes that inform ongoing process upgrades. Unlike reactive AI, agentic systems function as digital colleagues, taking initiative, pursuing goals, having memory and context, using tools to learn from outcomes, and adapting in real time. This shift unlocks incremental gains and breakthrough innovation in customer and user experience through reimagined workflows for operational excellence.\n\nRedefining how an organization operates to deliver differentiating value requires careful human orchestration. While agentic AI acts autonomously, it depends on human or enterprise oversight to anchor purpose, set guardrails, and ensure alignment. Effectively implementing agentic AI prioritizes the role of human employees in value creation to a higher level, ensuring transparency, ethical standards, and responsible strategic oversight at every level. To realize agentic AI\u2019s full potential, organizations need to connect AI agents to multiple tools and data sources without building custom integrations for each one. Enter the Model Context Protocol (MCP)\u2014an open standard that replaces fragmented integrations with a single, universal protocol. Think of MCP as a USB-C port for AI agents. Just as USB-C standardized device connections, MCP standardizes how AI systems access databases, applications, and external services. No more writing separate code for each integration.\n\nFor businesses, this means autonomous agents can seamlessly access customer databases, CRM systems, knowledge repositories, and execute actions across platforms\u2014all through one standardized protocol. As the ecosystem matures, AI systems maintain context while moving between tools and datasets, creating a sustainable architecture. The result? Dramatically reduced technical complexity and agents with the contextual awareness to deliver transformative customer value. Implementing the transformative value of agentic AI requires organizational change management\u2014redesigning organizational processes that efficiently yield quality outcomes.\n\nNot just a new tool, impactful agentic AI implementation requires an AI expert as a vital ongoing member of cross-functional mission-based teams focused on a specific process selected for re-engineering. AI experts should not be siloed in the technical function. They should be embedded with the functional process content and outcomes experts, learning from each other as they expand organizational expertise. As the number of reimagined process teams grows, so does the organizational expertise, extending gains achieved and staying ahead of a continuously evolving AI. All of this requires careful orchestration of data, strategy, and organizational readiness focused on the functions to which agentic AI is applied and a work culture that adapts to discover new opportunities. This is transformational enterprise change. It is not an event but a new way of working. The potential, however, is substantial. If your organization is still only implementing prompt engineering, you are lagging.\n\nAnother key factor is how to prioritize which re-engineered processes customers and users will value most by seeing how they use the product or service. In the early 1980s, then-NCR Corporation used observational research to identify the most time-consuming challenges their retail cash registers could automate. NCR collaboratively developed the Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) protocol and developed a SCSI computer chip that enabled scanning charges to replace hand entry. Similarly standing in their customers\u2019 shoes, Intuit engineers and product managers spur innovation by regularly engaging in \u201cfollow-me-home\u201d with customers seeing how users apply their product features in their daily lives. This institutionalizes technical experts\u2019 insights into customer usage to feed innovative ideas for more transformation. Companies recognizing employees\u2019 AI skill gaps are providing in-house or commercial training for workers. Higher ed institutions and their nonacademic competitors offer a variety of online courses. With AI continuously evolving, the next generation and their teachers also need training. The American Federation of Teachers (AFT), America\u2019s second largest teachers\u2019 union, is starting a training hub with $23 million in funding from Microsoft, OpenAI, and Anthropic to focus on training teachers to generate lesson plans with AI wisely, safely and ethically.\n\nAFT\u2019s Share My Lesson is now Beta testing an OpenAI-powered teaching assistant, TRYEdBrAIn, that can adapt lesson plans to change grade levels, translate into different languages and many other options. Beta testing is now underway to understand user experience. The Khan Academy is testing an AI-powered teacher assistant as a student tutor in various school districts. As digital transformation accelerates, leading organizations will see agentic AI not as a tool, but as a catalyst for new paradigms of teamwork, value creation, and enterprise agility.
