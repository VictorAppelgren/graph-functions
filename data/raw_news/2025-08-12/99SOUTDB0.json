  "content": "A state lawmaker in South Carolina resigned from his seat months after being arrested for alleged distribution of child sexual abuse material, the state's House speaker announced on Aug. 11.\n\nRJ May, a 38-year-old Republican state representative and former South Carolina House Freedom Caucus strategist, was accused of using the screen name \u201cjoebidennnn69\u201d on the social media network Kik to exchange 220 different files of toddlers and young children.\n\n\u201cI have decided that it is in the best interest of my family and constituents to resign immediately from the South Carolina House of Representatives,\u201d reads a resignation letter sent from May to the state's House Speaker Murrell Smith and obtained by local media outlets, including the Post and Courier and South Carolina Daily Gazette.\n\nIn a statement, the South Carolina House Freedom Caucus, which May helped found, said the resignation is \u201clong overdue.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe people of District 88 deserve true and honorable representation,\" the statement said.\n\nAccording to court records obtained by USA TODAY, May exchanged the explicit files across five days in spring 2024. The records say the files were uploaded and downloaded on May\u2019s home Wi-Fi network and on his cellphone.\n\nIn a June press release from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, officials said May faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison, a fine of $250,000 and five years of probation. May is being held at the Edgefield County jail, awaiting the start of his trial.\n\nMay\u2019s legal representation did not immediately respond to USA TODAY\u2019s request for comment on Aug. 12.\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Press Release\nWest Columbia Man Indicted for Distributing Child Sexual Abuse Material\nFor Immediate Release\nU.S. Attorney's Office, District of South Carolina\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. \u2014 A federal grand jury in Greenville returned a 10-count indictment against Robert John May III, 38, of West Columbia, for distributing child sexual abuse material.*\nAccording to court documents and statements made in court, in April 2024, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received a cyber-tip from the social messaging app Kik. Kik flagged several videos from the username \u201cjoebidennnn69\u201d as containing child sexual abuse. Investigators connected the account to the home IP address and mobile device of May and identified at least 10 videos depicting child sexual abuse that were shared from the account.\nMay faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in federal prison with a minimum of five years, a fine of $250,000, and a term of at least five years of supervised release to follow any term of imprisonment.\nThis case was brought as part of Project Safe Childhood, a nationwide initiative launched in May 2006 by the U.S. Department of Justice to combat the growing epidemic of child sexual exploitation and abuse. Led by the U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices and the Criminal Division\u2019s Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section, Project Safe Childhood marshals federal, state and local resources to better locate, apprehend and prosecute individuals, who sexually exploit children, as well as to identify and rescue victims. For more information about Project Safe Childhood, please visit http://www.justice.gov/psc.\nThe case was investigated by Homeland Security Investigations. Assistant U.S. Attorneys Scott Matthews and Dean Secor are prosecuting the case with Austin M. Berry of the Department of Justice\u2019s Child Exploitation & Obscenity Section.\nAll charges in the indictment are merely accusations and defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law.\n###\n* The term \u201cchild pornography\u201d is currently used in federal statutes and is defined as any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a person less than 18 years old. While this phrase still appears in federal law, \u201cchild sexual abuse material\u201d is preferred, as it better reflects the abuse that is depicted in the images and videos and the resulting trauma to the child. The Associated Press Stylebook also discourages the use of the phrase \u201cchild pornography.\u201d\nUpdated June 12, 2025\nTopic\nProject Safe Childhood\nComponent"

      "text": "Freedom Caucuses push for conservative state laws, but getting attention is their big win\nMissouri is one of 11 states with formal chapters of the State Freedom Caucus Network, which aims to push Republicans to the right.\nWhen a Republican colleague threatened to read aloud from a 2-foot stack of books \u2014 including a biblical guide to leadership and a tome by anti-tax activist Grover Norquist \u2014 to protest inaction on his bills last week, Missouri state Sen. Rick Brattin quickly took up the cause.\nSeizing on a chance to hijack the planned schedule, Brattin spoke for about 45 minutes, accusing the leaders of his own Republican Party of ignoring some bills and making things \u201creally frustrating\u201d for ultra-conservative members. He often waved his arms for emphasis, as other senators sat flipping through papers, waiting for the session to begin.\n\u201cIt leads to things coming to a halt in this chamber,\u201d he said. \u201cI wish we would do things people actually want.\u201d\nBrattin is chair of Missouri\u2019s Freedom Caucus, a group of Republican legislators who aim to push their party further to the right on issues such as immigration, voting access and transgender restrictions.\nBut some other Republicans say members of the Freedom Caucus gum up the legislative works and are more interested in publicity and grandstanding than conservative policymaking. Frustrated by such tactics, Missouri Senate leaders stripped four Freedom Caucus senators, including Brattin, of their chairmanships and parking spots earlier this year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to do stuff even when everybody\u2019s acting in good faith,\u201d said Senate President Pro Tem Caleb Rowden, a Columbia Republican. Rowden once derided the Freedom Caucus members as \u201cswamp creatures who all too often remind me more of my children than my colleagues.\u201d He added that last week\u2019s delay was a mix-up and that the bills at issue would come to the floor.\n\u201cThey did that repeatedly, day after day for two weeks, basically,\u201d Rowden said in an interview last week at his spacious desk in his high-ceilinged office across the hall from the Senate. \u201cIt became necessary for us to do something that would indicate that we\u2019re not going to let four guys run the place. It\u2019s just not how this works.\u201d\nMore: Rowden removes 'swamp creatures' of Missouri Freedom Caucus from committee positions\nThe Missouri Freedom Caucus claims at least six senators and is approaching a dozen House members. There are similar chapters in 10 other states so far that are officially part of the State Freedom Caucus Network, an outgrowth of the congressional group that has held up deals and helped oust speakers in the U.S. House of Representatives.\nThe state chapters are proposing conservative legislation and slowing measures they don\u2019t like, even bills that were once considered routine and noncontroversial. And its members in many states, including Missouri, are running for higher office. But regardless of whether they succeed on legislation, they excel at getting publicity and drawing attention to themselves.\nThat is by design, Andrew Roth, president of the Washington, D.C.-based network, told Stateline.\n\u201cWhat we try to do is push conservative policy,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we win, we win. If we lose, we\u2019re exposing the fake Republicans for who they are. They will then have to answer to their constituents. We feel like we win either way.\u201d\nThe national organization provides the state caucuses with support and funding. That includes the salary of each state director, none of whom is a legislator, according to Roth.\nThe state directors pay attention to what\u2019s going on in state government even when the legislatures are not in session and the mostly part-time lawmakers are home tending to other business. They can alert the more than 160 members to issues and either get them to call a news conference or draft legislation to be considered in the next session to highlight their priorities.\nTim Jones, a former Missouri House speaker who is now director of the state\u2019s Freedom Caucus, said in an interview that since the parking spaces kerfuffle, the caucus has picked up five new members in the House.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not meant to be a publicity stunt for anybody,\u201d he insisted. \u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be the conservative North Star of the General Assembly.\u201d\nState Sen. Bill Eigel, a Missouri caucus member from Weldon Spring who is running for governor, said taking his parking spot \u201cis kind of the height of pettiness,\u201d but that he won\u2019t be deterred.\n\u201cThey are trying to silence us, just like they are trying to silence Donald Trump,\u201d Eigel said in an interview. \u201cUnfortunately for them, it\u2019s not going to work. We\u2019re going to continue to be bold.\u201d\nEigel said he parks \u201cdown by the river\u201d now, a few blocks away from the underground Capitol garage. His wife is happy that the extra walk means he\u2019s getting in a few more steps each day, he quipped.\nMore: Missouri Senate grinds to a halt as Freedom Caucus pushes for action on ballot measures\nPushing to the right\nLike most other Republicans, Freedom Caucus members across states have championed school vouchers, pushed to send state troops to the U.S.-Mexico border to pursue migrants crossing into the country illegally, and opposed large state budgets and transgender medical care for minors.\nBut the Freedom Caucuses formed because some Republicans saw the rest of their party as not conservative enough. That has led to intraparty conflict in many GOP-dominated state capitols.\nIn Missouri, for example, the Senate passed a bill that would make it harder to amend the state constitution, if voters approve the measure, after leaders stripped a provision backed by the Freedom Caucus to ban non-citizens from voting.\nThe Missouri Constitution already restricts voting only to citizens, but Freedom Caucus members argued the ban could be made even more explicit. Democrats disagreed and staged a filibuster that tied up the Senate; Republican leaders eventually agreed to take the provisions out, drawing the Freedom Caucus\u2019s ire.\nEigel would like the House to put the tougher provisions back in. Still, he claims credit for the Senate victory.\n\u201cIf the Freedom Caucus doesn\u2019t stand up and cause a ruckus, the [ballot] initiative petition doesn\u2019t move,\u201d he said.\nIn Idaho, Republican leaders removed some Freedom Caucus members from committee leadership late last year. And in South Carolina, some Freedom Caucusers who refused to sign a loyalty oath pledging not to campaign against other Republican members, which is against party rules, were dumped from the House Republican caucus.\nMatthew Green, a politics professor at the Catholic University of America who has studied the state Freedom Caucuses extensively, said in an interview that the state caucuses are \u201carguably more important than the U.S. House Freedom Caucus for policymaking.\u201d\nIn a forthcoming paper, Green found that state legislative conservative caucuses \u2014 precursors of the current Freedom Caucuses \u2014 began to form as early as 2017, driven by lawmakers who found the GOP in their states insufficiently conservative.\nBut since 2021, the caucuses have formed at the behest of the national State Freedom Caucus Network, \u201cillustrating how national interest groups and elected officials can contribute to state-level polarization,\u201d he said. His study also found that lawmakers who lack power and influence are more likely to join the caucuses.\nThese caucuses, Green said, have been able to \u201cmove [the] party\u2019s agenda further rightward, especially if the caucus constitutes a sizable proportion of the party.\u201d\nDelaying tactics can force Republican leaders to act on some issues, he said. \u201cSeems like if the Freedom Caucus is disruptive and confrontational, they can win battles.\u201d\nPeverill Squire, a political science professor at the University of Missouri, said the Freedom Caucus members in Missouri take advantage of unlimited debate to slow the legislature down \u201cto a snail\u2019s pace. Given the rules \u2026 it is relatively easy for them to gum up the process when they are unhappy with the way things are going,\u201d he wrote in an email. That means even bills with broad GOP support have not made it all the way through the process, he wrote.\nMore: Missouri Senate leaders outline 2024 goals but fear infighting will stymie progress\nThe animosity is not restricted to Missouri. In South Carolina, Green said, there\u2019s \u201cbasically a civil war\u201d going on in the supermajority Republican Party.\nMembers of the South Carolina Freedom Caucus refused to pledge not to fund challengers to GOP incumbents; that flouted a 2006 law that prohibited \u201cspecial interest\u201d caucuses from raising money and becoming otherwise involved in political campaigns. Only major caucuses organized by political party, race, ethnicity or gender \u2014 the Democratic, Republican, Black and Women\u2019s caucuses \u2014 were allowed political operations. The ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus argued that was unfair in a suit against the legislature\u2019s Ethics Committee. Last year, a federal judge agreed.\nRep. RJ May, one of the leaders of the South Carolina Freedom Caucus, said that the law was a way to \u201csign away our First Amendment rights. The establishment attempted to weaponize the rules,\u201d he told Stateline.\nMay said that one of the reasons the Freedom Caucus formed in South Carolina is that the majority Republicans don\u2019t \u201cfollow the party platform\u201d and are too willing to compromise. The push gained steam, he said, when GOP legislative leaders began to only allow floor amendments from leadership, not rank-and-file lawmakers.\n\u201cPeople in South Carolina are sick and tired of leaders saying one thing at home and doing something different in Columbia. They say they are for reducing the size of government, but they vote for budget after budget that increases the number of agencies.\u201d\nMay said his caucus has had some victories, such as championing a bill that passed the House to ban gender-affirming care for minors. (The bill is awaiting action in the Senate.) Caucus members also claim credit for reducing the state\u2019s spending bill, though many of its members\u2019 amendments were rejected, such as a move to give grants to churches and nonprofits to bolster the foster care system.\nMay echoed leaders in Missouri and elsewhere by saying that passing a bill is not necessarily the goal. \u201cWe have the effect of moving the body to the right,\u201d he said.\nHouse Speaker Murrell Smith\u2019s staff did not respond to requests for comment. Nor did he comment for local media stories about the caucus.\n\"The farm team\"\nMost of the Freedom Caucuses formed in states with Republican supermajorities. An exception is Pennsylvania, where the governor is a Democrat and Democrats control the House, while Republicans control the Senate.\nThe Freedom Caucus there has filed a lawsuit accusing Democrats, including President Joe Biden and Gov. Josh Shapiro, of unconstitutionally wresting power from the legislature over expanding access to elections in the state. Just last week, a federal judge dismissed the suit.\nPennsylvania Rep. Dawn Keefer, the Republican Freedom Caucus chair, who is running for the state Senate, had no immediate comment on the ruling to local media. Nor would she comment for this story.\nIn Arizona, Freedom Caucus members, led by chair Sen. Jake Hoffman, spearheaded a drive that resulted in the state Board of Education delaying until next year a proposed new handbook governing how parents use state-funded educational savings accounts to send their kids to private schools. The new handbook was designed to tighten the rules for using the accounts.\nHoffman said parents had not been given sufficient input. The new rules would have restricted the use of the funds for summer programs and required more updates for use of the money for students with disabilities. He called for a \u201crobust stakeholder working group\u201d to give input into the rule changes. The Board of Education maintained it had consulted parents and other interested parties. Nonetheless, it caved after concerns from families and Freedom Caucus members.\nMore: Missouri Senate approves gubernatorial appointments after Freedom Caucus stands down\nHolding news conferences, filing lawsuits \u2014 it\u2019s all part of the State Freedom Caucus Network playbook, according to its director, Roth.\n\u201cOur members consider themselves the farm team of the House Freedom Caucus,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also provide them communications support, legal support and get them connected with legal groups to help them file lawsuits.\u201d\nBack in Missouri, roiling the entrenched GOP leadership is exactly what Freedom Caucus members are doing, Eigel said.\n\u201cWe\u2019re shaking the status quo just by going through a lot of bills that are brought to the floor and asking a lot of questions that can frustrate folks that are expecting a much easier route to get their special interest priorities to the legislative chamber,\u201d he said just before last week\u2019s Senate session that featured Brattin\u2019s delay tactics. \u201cI suspect that if you are watching today, you\u2019re going to see a lot of questions.\u201d\nAnd there were.\nThis story was first published at www.stateline.org."

      "text": "Smithsonian puts Trump's name back in museum's impeachment display - with changes\nThe Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History has restored references to President Donald Trump after removing them from a presidential impeachment display in late July.\nFirst reported by The Washington Post on July 31, changes to \"The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden\" entailed the total removal of what the museum called a temporary placard briefly covering Trump's two impeachments in 2019 and 2021.\nA more permanent display about the president has since been added, as have artifacts from the proceedings. Some text was changed between displays, specifically concerning Trump's involvement with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and accusations of election interference.\nSmithsonian was 'not asked by any Administration' to change exhibit\nThe previous, temporary Trump plaque, which was added in 2021, was taken out in July to return the display to how it appeared nearly 20 years ago in 2008, according to a Smithsonian statement shared with USA TODAY on Aug. 1. The Washington Post also noted that the exhibit said that \"only three presidents have seriously faced removal,\" meaning Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon.\nThe change was made because it \"did not meet the museum\u2019s standards in appearance,\" the Smithsonian Institute said in an Aug. 2 statement, adding that it blocked the view of other objects inside the case.\n\"We were not asked by any Administration or other government official to remove content from the exhibit,\" it said, telling USA TODAY in a separate statement that, \"A future and updated exhibit will include all impeachments,\" noting that updating and renewing permanent galleries \"requires a significant amount of time and funding.\"\nThe museum unveiled an updated exhibit on Aug. 8.\n\"At the heart of the Smithsonian\u2019s work is a steadfast commitment to scholarship, rigorous research, and the accurate, factual presentation of history,\" the institute said in a statement shared with USA TODAY on Aug. 11. \"The National Museum of American History has completed its update to the Impeachment case within 'The American Presidency: A Glorious Burden' exhibition. The updated display now reflects all presidential impeachments.\"\nTrump added back to impeachment display\nIn September 2021, a \"temporary label on content concerning the impeachments of Donald J. Trump\" was added, according to the Smithsonian.\nFrom September 2021 to July 2025, a large placard was suspended at the forefront of the display with the title, \"Case under redesign ('history happens').\" It mentioned the impeachment proceedings brought against Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon, who resigned before he could be formally impeached, as well as Trump.\nBehind it were more permanent sections about Johnson's impeachment, including tickets and newspaper clips from the time; Nixon's Senate hearing and resignation, including testimony papers, a filing cabinet and photos from the proceedings; and Clinton's trial, with tickets and Senate question cards.\nFrom late July to the exhibit reopening on Aug. 8, the removal of the placard meant there were no references to Trump, who is the first and only president in American history to be impeached twice.\nNow, Trump occupies a smaller placard at the bottom of the display case, which also includes 2019 and 2021 tickets to the impeachment proceedings acquired in June 2025, the Smithsonian said in a statement shared with USA TODAY.\nChanges to text describing Trump impeachments\nChanges were also made to the text describing the Trump proceedings, as reported by the Post and The New York Times and confirmed via photos by USA TODAY.\nThe word \"alleged\" was added to the text about Trump's 2020 impeachment trial, changing the sentence, \"The charges focused on the president\u2019s solicitation of foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election....\" to, \"The charges focused on the president\u2019s alleged solicitation of foreign interference in the 2020 presidential election and defiance of Congressional subpoenas. Trump was acquitted in January 2020.\"\nMore significant changes were made to the description of the second 2021 impeachment. Specifically, the phrases \"repeated 'false statements'\" and \"'encouraged \u2012 and foreseeably resulted in \u2012 imminent lawless action at the Capitol'\" were removed when discussing Trump's involvement in Jan. 6.\nPreviously, the placard read: \"On January 13, 2021, Donald Trump became the first president to be impeached twice. The charge was incitement of insurrection, based on repeated 'false statements' challenging the 2020 election results and his January 6 speech that 'encouraged \u2012 and foreseeably resulted in \u2012 imminent lawless action at the Capitol.' Because Trump\u2019s term ended on January 20, his acquittal on February 13 made him the first former president tried by the Senate.\"\nNow, it reads: \"On January 13, 2021, Donald Trump became the first president to be impeached twice. The charge was incitement of insurrection based on his challenge of the 2020 election results and on his speech on January 6. Because Trump\u2019s term ended on January 20, he became the first former president tried by the Senate. He was acquitted on February 13, 2021.\u201d\nThe Smithsonian declined to clarify the reason behind these changes.\n\"Adhering to principles foundational to our role as the nation's museum, we take great care to ensure that what we present to the public reflects both intellectual integrity and thoughtful design,\" it said in its Aug. 11 statement.\nThe controversy surrounding the Smithsonian's change to the display came after the White House in May pushed for the removal of art director Kim Sajet from her role as director of the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery, citing her \"strong support\" of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).\nIn March, Trump also signed an executive order demanding the removal of \"anti-American ideology\" from the Smithsonian and other cultural institutions and tasked a White House official, Lindsey Halligan, with scrutinizing \"improper ideology\" at said institutions."

House Freedom Caucus strategist RJ May has resigned, months after his arrest for distribution of child sexual abuse material.\n\"I have decided it is in the best interest of my family and constituents to resign immediately from the South Carolina House of Representatives,\" May wrote in his resignation letter released Aug. 11.\nMay, who is currently being held at the Edgefield County jail, has remained as the duly-elected state representative for the largely rural Lexington County-based House District 88 since his June 11 arrest on 10 federal counts of distributing child sexual abuse materials. House leadership suspended him from the chamber without pay June 12.\nMay, 38, has maintained his innocence, with his attorneys suggesting in court that his computerized devices were hacked by a political opponent.\nHis letter of resignation was received Aug. 11, House Speaker Murrell Smith's office confirmed.\n\"RJ May's resignation from the South Carolina House of Representatives is long overdue,\" the South Carolina Freedom Caucus, which May co-founded, said in a statement. \"The people of District 88 deserve true and honorable representation.\"\nHouse Majority Leader Davey Hiott, R-Pickens, filed a House ethics complaint against May in June and his \"business dealings with other members of the State House of Representatives.\"\nIn early July, the House Ethics Committee met to confirm they retained outside counsel to investigate a lawmaker that officials refused to identify but was widely considered to be May.\n\"We take conduct unbecoming a member with the utmost seriousness and because of the sick nature of Mr. May's indictments, a complaint to the Ethics Committee will start the process to expel him from the House of Representatives,\" Hiott said in his ethics complaint.\nAccording to inmate communication records obtained by The Post and Courier through an open-records request, May was aware of the House ethics probe. He said nothing about resigning in his inmate communication log.\n\u201cif its for pronography, its a bs media stunt. yeah. i got served the other by sc house. let them, i suppose,\u201d May wrote to his sister on July 30.\nReached by phone, Goose Creek Republican Jordan Pace, the current chairman of the caucus, said he did not believe the ethics investigation had any bearing on May's decision to resign, calling it a \"stretch\" when other former members of the legislature continued to face probes after leaving office.\n\"If the guy didn't resign immediately after being federally charged on 10 counts of pretty heinous CSAM (child sex abuse material) stuff, I don't think he's so frightened of an investigation from the South Carolina the House Ethics Committee,\" he said.\nThe hardline conservative organization has for months been seeking to separate itself from May, who was once considered the key architect of the caucus' strategy.\nIn recent weeks, the caucus pushed House leadership to call a special session specifically to expel May from the chamber \u2014 a call it reprised in its latest statement.\n\"While we welcome this resignation, we strongly believe that the SC House should have acted to expel RJ May after he was indicted for such heinous crimes,\" it said in a statement. \"Our hearts are with his victims and his innocent family and we pray for swift justice as this ugly chapter in the South Carolina House of Representatives comes to a close.\"\nA special election is expected to be called for the seat in light of May\u2019s resignation, likely taking place in late October. Currently, the only publicly identified candidate is Brian Duncan, who led a failed write-in campaign against May in November's elections after May's home was raided by federal agents last summer.\n\"When the special election occurs in the coming months, I will be ready to continue the work I began last year meeting with residents, listening to their concerns, and sharing my vision for a stronger District 88,\u201d Duncan wrote in a press statement. \u201cI\u2019ve served my country, I\u2019ve served my community, and I am ready to serve again in the State House.\u201d\nMay was elected to the S.C.

      "text": "SCOTUS has been asked to overturn same-sex marriage. What is Trump\u2019s stance?\n- Former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis has appealed to the Supreme Court to overturn the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges ruling that legalized same-sex marriage.\n- Legal experts believe the Supreme Court is unlikely to overturn the ruling.\n- President Donald Trump's stance on same-sex marriage has varied over the years, from supporting domestic partnerships to opposing same-sex marriage, and later saying he was \"fine\" with it.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has officially been asked to overturn the 2015 decision that granted equal marriage rights to LGBTQ+ couples.\nKim Davis, a former Kentucky county clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses, filed an appeal on July 24 about the compensation she was ordered to pay to a gay couple she denied a license. She asked the court, which holds a conservative supermajority, to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges.\nBut legal experts previously told USA TODAY that the court is unlikely to overturn that ruling. Also, President Joe Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act in 2022, which passed through Congress with bipartisan support and requires all states to recognize same-sex and interracial marriages.\nWhere does Trump stand on same-sex marriage?\nThe White House did not weigh in on the appeal request or the possibility of the right being taken away. But Trump has given varied stances on same-sex marriage.\nTrump expressed support for domestic partnerships in an interview he did with The Advocate in 2000, as reported by CBS News. The signal of support came at a time when many in the GOP did not share such a stance.\nLater, in 2011 he said on Fox News he was not \"in favor of gay marriage,\" and in 2015, he told CNN he supported \"traditional marriage.\u201d But days after being elected in 2016 in a \"60 Minutes\" interview, he said he was \"fine\" with same-sex marriage, a far cry from the 2016 GOP platform, which critiqued the Supreme Court decision that granted the federal right.\nBut throughout his first term and re-election campaign, he appointed some people with a history of advocating against same-sex marriage, including Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, according to GLAAD.\nDuring the 2024 presidential campaign, the GOP's official platform removed explicit mentions of same-sex marriage, saying only \"Republicans will promote a Culture that values the Sanctity of Marriage, the blessings of childhood, the foundational role of families, and supports working parents.\"\nWhen asked by NBC News if Trump planned to roll back same-sex marriage, incoming press secretary Karoline Leavitt, said \"that was never a campaign promise that he made,\u201d the outlet reported in November 2024.\nTrump's record on LGBTQ+ issues in his second term\nTrump has made attacking the transgender community a central part of his second term. His executive orders have aimed to ban transgender people from serving in the military, bar transgender student athletes from competing in women's sports and limit passports to only recognize someone's sex assigned at birth.\nThe Trump administration's federal budget cuts have also resulted in specialized services for LGBTQ+ youth through 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline being shut down in July.\nAlso, while he promised to find a way to make in vitro fertilization more accessible, he has yet to release plans.\nAppeal to SCOTUS latest in long case following Obergefell v. Hodges\nThe Supreme Court already declined to take up an appeal in Davis' case in 2020.\nBack in 2015 after the Obergefell ruling, Davis refused to issue marriage licenses for same-sex couples as a county clerk in Kentucky. An evangelical Christian, she argued issuing those licenses would conflict with her religious beliefs, and even served a brief stint in jail for contempt of court.\nDavid Ermold and David Moore, a gay couple who Davis denied licenses, sued over the incident. In 2022, U.S. District Judge David Bunning ruled Davis could not claim her own constitutional right as a defense in violating the rights of others when acting in an official capacity as an elected official. She was ordered to pay $100,000 to the couple in 2023.\nContributing: Maureen Groppe, Zac Anderson, Bart Jansen, Marc Ramirez, Eleanor McCrary, Cybele Mayes-Osterman, USA TODAY\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

      "text": "DC mayor says Trump takeover shows why US capital should be 51st state\nWashington, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser is advocating for the city to become the 51st state after President Donald Trump announced the federal government would take control of the local Metropolitan Police Department.\nBowser, who has been the city\u2019s mayor since 2015, made the remarks during an appearance on Charlamagne Tha God\u2019s radio show \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d on Tuesday, Aug. 12.\n\u201cIt\u2019s times like this when America needs to know why your nation\u2019s capital, a place where 700,000 tax-paying Americans live, should be the 51st state,\u201d said Bowser on the radio show.\n\u201c[Trump] wants to send the message to cities that if he can get away with this in Los Angeles, if he can get away with this in DC, he can get away with it in New York, or Baltimore or Chicago, or any other place where millions of people live, work and are doing everything the right way.\u201d\nOn Monday, Aug. 11, Trump announced he\u2019d be invoking Section 740 of the Home Rule Act to take control of the police department. The 1973 law grants Washington, DC residents limited authority to govern themselves.\nUnder the law, the president can take control of local police for two days, but any additional time would require congressional notice or an amendment to the existing law. After 30 days, Trump would need congressional approval to retain control of DC police.\nTrump has touted the idea of taking over the police force since 2020, when the Black Lives Matter protests were taking hold of the city, and has since voiced his criticisms of Washington, DC leadership.\nHis recent attempt to crack down on violent crime came after a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) employee was assaulted during an attempted carjacking on Aug. 3.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d said Trump during a news briefing at the White House on Aug. 11. \u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people.\u201d\nThe president also said he\u2019d be deploying National Guard troops into the city as part of the effort.\nBowser refuted the characterization that violent crime in the city has gotten out of control and disagreed with the president\u2019s actions. It\u2019s the first time a president has taken control of local police.\nAccording to data from the Metropolitan Police Department, violent crime in DC has fallen by 26% compared to the same period last year.\n\u201cThe numbers just don\u2019t justify the action,\u201d said Bowser. She said it\u2019s \u201cnot a good idea\u201d for local police, who have gained the trust of city residents, to be used in a way that makes communities fearful.\nBowser said it appears the president is targeting urban areas where he is less popular, including DC.\nTrump, she said, is \u201cvery aware\u201d of the number of DC residents who voted for him in the 2024 election and has, in turn, taken an aggressive stance. About 6% of city residents voted for the president in the 2024 election.\nThe president has named other liberal-leaning cities, like Chicago and Los Angeles, as places where he might send federal troops next.\nCharlamagne Tha God asked Bowser if she believes Trump\u2019s actions could be a \u201ctrial run for a police state.\u201d\nWhile she didn\u2019t directly respond to the question, she said: \u201cIt is a step in fascism when the federal government can bigfoot sovereign states.\n\u201cRight now... he\u2019s trying to make it normal where citizens say the federal government should overtake local policing and try to make that a normal thing, so if he tries it in other places, people will be desensitized to it.\u201d\nShe continued: \u201cWe can\u2019t be desensitized to it because it\u2019s not normal.\u201d\nMichelle Del Rey is a trending news reporter at USA TODAY.
