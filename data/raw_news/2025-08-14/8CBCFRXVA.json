  "title": "11 Must-Have Windows Utilities and PowerToys Programs for Power Users",
  "description": "Windows has plenty to offer out of the box, and Microsoft PowerToys lets it do more.",
  "content": "Want to get more out of Windows 11? Here's some cool built-in (and not quite built-in) tools you might not be aware of.\n\nWindows Actually Has a Bit of Built-in \u2018Stuff\u2019, and You Can Add More With PowerToys\n\nEach release of Windows faces criticism for 'dumbing things down'. A lot of this sentiment is just down to people being change-averse, but some of it is warranted, especially when Microsoft periodically attempts to remove a much-beloved Windows program that's shipped with the OS since the Middle Ages, like Paint or WordPad.\n\nBut, Windows is still more than just a shiny launcher for your web browser and Microsoft Office, and it's still got a lot of functionality lurking under the hood that can help you optimize your PC, make it more efficient to use, and even automate tasks. And if you want more, Microsoft PowerToys adds a lot of extra convenience and tools to tune things up.\n\nFirst, and possibly most useful, the Awake PowerToy. It does just what it says on the tin: you turn it on, and your device never goes to sleep. Awake appears as an icon in the system tray where you can toggle its functionality. It is particularly handy if you have a download or file transfer you absolutely don't want interrupted, or want to keep Docker containers or servers running in the background.\n\nEveryone's talking about, or about to be talking about, AI agents that can automatically do menial tasks for you without requiring ongoing prompting. But a lot of these things can be done already with simple scheduling and scripting, without AI agents that rely on a data center the size of Kansas.\n\nThe Windows Task Scheduler is a relatively simple tool that, combined with a bit of scripting know-how, lets you tell your PC to do something automatically at a certain time or when a specific event occurs.\n\nIf you're looking to automate tasks on the web, IFTT is pretty nifty, too.\n\nFancyZones is a PowerToy that adds mouse and keyboard-controlled windows snapping to Windows 11. You can edit screen layouts with different zones, and then with a swipe or a click, resize and position windows to them automatically.\n\nEver tried to delete a file and Windows won't let you because it's in use? When enabled, the File Locksmith PowerToy will actually tell you what's using the file (why Windows hasn't done this by default is a total mystery to me) and let you try to unlock it.\n\nCustomize your keyboard by reassigning or disabling physical keys. If you've ever accidentally alt-tabbed or hit the left Windows key and interrupted your game at a critical moment, this one's for you (I actually used to pry off the left Windows and alt keys on my keyboard back when I had time to play Counter-Strike).\n\nThe Snipping Tool is more than just a replacement for the print screen key. Copy text from anything, including images, PDFs, and protected web pages. If it's on your screen, it's probably available to the Snipping Tool. All you need to do is take a screenshot, and open the Text Actions menu or the Text Extractor PowerToy.\n\nWhy right-click to view a file's properties when you can have that information readily available? The Details and Preview panes in the Windows File Explorer show file information or a preview for supported file formats, rather than making you launch an app to view them. If you want to quickly preview files in a larger window, the Peek PowerToy lets you assign a keyboard shortcut to do just that.\n\nWe all know the Windows Task Manager, and we all know how to Ctrl + Alt + Delete to force a misbehaving program to close or see how much memory an app is using. The Process Explorer is a supercharged version of the Task Manager popular with IT administrators that shows extra info like what files programs are using. Technically, Process Explorer isn't built in (it should be), but installation is as easy as downloading it from Microsoft Sysinternals.\n\nThe Original notepad.exe (Not the New Notepad)\n\nMicrosoft recently updated Notepad with rich text support and, of course, AI. This is probably fine for most people who don't care about AI taking over everything, but the old notepad.exe is still there if you know how to get to it.\n\nIt's like Spotlight search on macOS, or a souped-up run dialog. Type what you want, and the Command Palette PowerToy will show results, from apps to files, and launch them with a keystroke.\n\nBuilt-in Windows Scripting (It\u2019s Not Just for Linux)\n\nWhatever OS you're using, you should learn to script it. Once you know how to use PowerShell (the Windows-native command line and scripting language that supersedes old batch files), you really open up a lot of possibilities for what you can do with your PC. And you might even take it further and progress to full-blown programming, where you can really start to make your devices do, well, anything you want them to.",

      "text": "Quick Links\nIf This Then That (IFTTT) is an online service that can connect all sorts of different products and services together, so you can automate just about anything your heart desires. Whenever someone tags you on Facebook, send that photo to Dropbox. Get an email when a new item appears on Craigslist matching your search terms. You can do almost anything.\nAn IFTTT \"applet\"---as they're called---consists of a trigger and an action. The trigger is something that happens that will then produce the action. To use the above example: a new Facebook photo getting tagged with my name is a trigger. The action is uploading the resulting photo to Dropbox.\nThat's just one small example out of the literally thousands and thousands of applets that you could create. Here's how to get started with IFTTT creating your own applets.\nSigning Up for an IFTTT Account\nThe first thing you'll want to do is sign up for an account with IFTTT if you don't already have one. So navigate to the IFTTT website and click \"Sign Up\" in the upper-right corner.\nEnter in your email address and create a password for your IFTTT account. Then click \"Sign up\" below that.\nYou'll then be introduced to the service and be given a brief tutorial on how the service works, but eventually you'll be taken to the home page.\nCreating an Applet\nNow it's time to create your first applet. You may already have one in mind, but for this how-to, we'll use the example mentioned above and create an applet that will automatically upload any new Facebook photo that I'm tagged in to my Dropbox folder.\nFrom the home page, click on \"My Applets\" toward the upper-right corner of the screen.\nNext, click on \"New Applet\".\nClick on \"This\" highlighted in blue.\nType \"Facebook\" in the search box or find it in the grid of products and services below that. Click on it when you find it.\nNext, you'll need to connect your Facebook account to IFTTT so that they can communicate with each other, so click \"Connect\".\nA pop-up will appear asking permission for IFTTT to access your Facebook account. Click \"OK\".\nYou'll also be asked permission for IFTTT to manage your Facebook pages, but this isn't necessary for this applet, so click \"Not Now\".\nNext, you'll choose the trigger. In this case, the trigger is when we're tagged in any new Facebook photo that someone uploads, so click on \"You are tagged in a photo\".\nAfter that, it's time to create the action that will occur when the trigger is fired, so click on \"That\" highlighted in blue.\nFind the \"Dropbox\" channel and click on it. You'll need to connect it to your IFTTT account just like you did with your Facebook account earlier.\nAfter you do that, select \"Add file from URL\" when you get to the \"Choose Action\" screen.\nYou can leave all of the text fields as is, but if you want you can give the folder that your photos will be uploaded to a custom name under \"Dropbox folder path\". By default, photos will be placed in a \"Facebook\" folder within an \"IFTTT\" folder. When you're done, click \"Create Action\" at the bottom.\nThe last step is to confirm the applet and give it a custom name if you choose. When you're ready, click on \"Finish\" at the bottom and your applet will be enabled. From now on, whenever you're tagged in a photo on Facebook, that photo will automatically be uploaded to your Dropbox folder in a separate custom folder.\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to IFTTT, and there's so much you can do with the service. Take time to familiarize yourself even more with IFTTT and experiment with different applets. You'll quickly come to find that it's a service that you'll have a hard time living without.\nYou can also get IFTTT on your iPhone or Android device from the iTunes App Store and Google Play, respectively."

      "text": "Quick Links\n\"Yeah, I know a little PowerShell,\" may be one of the most used statements at tech conferences over the years. Not many statements can be made that can equally be as much of an understatement as it is an overstatement.\nSome who say this are pretty humble, though they probably know quite a bit about PowerShell. Others tend to think knowing about PowerShell qualifies as knowing how to use it. For those who don't know how to use it, which is still a large portion of the systems support and engineering crowd, it can be quite a daunting thought to think about where to even start with utilizing PowerShell. You've heard countless technical speeches, read pages of articles, and have had plenty of conversations with peers about all that it can do for you. You're looking up at this growing mountain, and all you can do is focus on the peak, and the obvious escapes you when it comes to planning how to get to that peak. That first step is directly in front of you, at the bottom of the mountain. Let's take that first step together.\nYou May Know Nothing of PowerShell, and That's OK\nLet's get this out of the way. If you don't know PowerShell, that's perfectly OK. It's all good if you know of PowerShell, but it's OK to come clean if you have never used it. Nodding in agreement in peer discussions and throwing PowerShell into your CV to hopefully get an edge can be a reality much quicker than you think. Everyone has their own PowerShell story, and yours will be as unique as your journey through the world of IT support and engineering. You have nowhere to go but up!\nAccording to Microsoft Docs, \"PowerShell is a cross-platform task automation solution made up of a command-line shell, a scripting language, and a configuration management framework. PowerShell runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS.\" The focus of this post will be strictly on the Shell portion of PowerShell and a fundamental focus at that. The other aspects come together with a little more clarity when you get more experience in the shell portion of PowerShell.\nMicrosoft developed PowerShell, and it is continually developing PowerShell to interact with Windows desktop operating systems, Windows Server operating systems, Office 365 resources, and Azure cloud resources. It will be an integral part of almost all of the universe of Microsoft products. PowerShell allows engineers and support personnel to manage their responsibilities more efficiently by enabling bulk creation and modification of resources such as files, folders, settings, and configurations. It is most known for its unique and user-friendly verb-noun nomenclature of cmdlets, pronounced as 'command-lets'. Cmdlets are the actual commands used to do something with PowerShell. Some cmdlets can be run exactly as they are, with no defining parameters. You type them in, press enter, and BOOM! You have output given to you in the console. If you are familiar with the ever-faithful command prompt in the Windows environment, you will feel very comfortable with PowerShell. Many of the commands you would typically run inside a command prompt can also run inside a PowerShell console. If anything, give it a shot the next time you usually use the command prompt. See how it can do the same things inside of the PowerShell console.\nPeeling Back the Veil of the GUI\nMost people love their precious GUI. They can see everything they think they need to see, and they get that warm and fuzzy feeling when they press Apply, then OK. Some of them like to live on the edge and entirely skip pressing Apply! Eventually, as you get deeper and deeper into managing servers, desktops, or Exchange, you will find yourself clicking endlessly when there is a change to be made that requires adding 360 users to 20 different Active Directory security groups. Are your fingers up for that clicking nightmare?\nIt's pretty safe to say that PowerShell helps to peel back the veil that is the precious and beloved GUI. PowerShell allows you to take that task of putting AD users into multiple groups and design a few commands to do the work in a mere fraction of the time it would take to do it all through the GUI. The beautiful thing is that Microsoft wants you to utilize PowerShell for these tasks. With the emphasis on PowerShell usage in many of the major Microsoft certification exams, it's beginning to no longer be only for the seasoned administrators, but it's becoming something that is needed more often in your daily support toolbox. It's reasonably accurate to say that any action, button, setting, or configuration you see in the GUI can be manipulated and set using PowerShell, even down to the nitty-gritty of the registry.\nTaking the First Steps\nLet's get you started with just a few cmdlets that you can use right now if you are reading this on a Windows PC. One thing that most sysadmins and engineers interact with is the Services console. If you open a PowerShell console, just input\nGet-Service\nand press enter to get a list of the installed services. You will get a quick blast of all the services installed on the local system and their current status of Running or Stopped. This output would be convenient to see if a specific application service is running or not.\nMaybe you don't want the whole list of services, and you are looking for a specific service. Let's say you want to see if the spooler service is running. You can call it out by name using the -ServiceName parameter like so:\nGet-Service -ServiceName spooler\nThis output will give you the single listing for the Print Spooler service and its status. Let's say the service is currently is started or stopped, and you want to either stop it or start it. You could use the following input to stop/start the spooler service:\nStart-Service -ServiceName spoolerStop-Service -ServiceName spooler\nBy default, these lines won't list the service status when the command is sent. You will need to run Get-Service -ServiceName spooler\nto view the current status.\nLuckily PowerShell is very wildcard friendly when listing objects and names. Let's say that you need to check on a specific service, but you aren't quite sure what the service is 'officially' named. You only know that the first word is remote. That's easy:\nGet-Service -ServiceName remote*\nThis input will list all the services starting with the remote and allow you to narrow down your search to find the specific service you are looking for and take whatever action you need to. Don't forget that there is also a Restart-Service cmdlet.\nTaking this just one step further to get a return on this tiny bit of knowledge of services, let's check services on a remote computer. Let's assume you are in a Windows domain environment and have administrative access to the remote computers you manage. You can use the same cmdlets discussed previously, but you need to add one parameter and value. To check the print spooler service on a remote server named PrintServer01:\nGet-Service -ComputerName PrintServer01\nThis output will list all the services installed on the remote machine, just like the local system we did earlier. This cmdlet will save you from using RDP to log into the remote server to check the service or adding the remote server into a local MMC snap-in. This capability in and of itself pays off very quickly.\nOne other command that can be used right out of the box, without parameters, is Get-NetIPAddress. This cmdlet will give you a listing of all the network adapters on the local system and a good amount of information about each adapter. You see in this output the inner workings behind the GUI. You can see so much more information about things that you usually see as an icon within the GUI. The beauty of seeing more info is that you can always use PowerShell to manipulate and search on any of that extra information. For instance, if you want to make changes to specific network adapters, you can search or filter for only those with a particular value. The possibilities are endless!\nWhere to Learn More\nNow that you have the slimmest of slices of PowerShell experience, it's up to you to continue the quest up that mountain discussed earlier. Putting one foot in front of the other is as easy as looking through some go-to resources for PowerShell tips. A simple Google search on a cmdlet is a good start. Microsoft Docs has a mighty library for every single cmdlet with plenty of examples of using them. PowerShell itself provides a good resource for explanations and examples. The command Get-Help Get-Service\nwill give you more information on our above example.\nOne resource that many experienced PowerShell users will remember is a top-rated book by Don Jones and Jeffrey Hicks. These giants of PowerShell own the shoulders that many stand upon when it comes to conquering the mountain of PowerShell. The book is titled \"Learn Windows PowerShell in a Month of Lunches.\" This easy to read book walks you through the basics of getting to know PowerShell in bite-sized pieces and ends up being a resource that you will find yourself continually referring back to when you are running into a situation that you need to use PowerShell.\nThe PowerShell community is also a very open and helpful place to learn as well. The subreddit r/PowerShell and the site PowerShell.org have a very thriving community of people with varying degrees of experience. You can always get some guidance from these resources. You won't be able to scale that mountain unless you take the steps, so get going and see how PowerShell can help you with your day-to-day routine and mundane tasks that you sometimes dread. You may find yourself frantic to schedule and automate a good amount of your workload so that you can give yourself time to learn more about PowerShell!"

      "text": "Learning to program is a difficult skill. If you've ever opened a tutorial and thought, \u201cI have no idea what's going on,\u201d you're not alone. With a few smart choices and the right strategies, you can make your learning journey smoother and even enjoyable.\nStart With a Beginner-Friendly Language\nOne of the reasons many people find programming hard at first is that the language they choose doesn't have a beginner-friendly syntax. I started my programming journey with the C programming language. In case you haven't used it, it's not exactly the most forgiving language for beginners. Although I managed to push through (with struggle, of course,) I've seen many others give up because the complex syntax got in the way of their learning.\nIf that's you, consider starting with a language that doesn't feel cryptic. It will smooth your learning curve and let you focus on what's important: how to think like a programmer. Once you\u2019ve got the foundational concepts down, switching to other languages becomes much easier.\nPython is a great choice to start with. Its syntax is clean and readable, almost like writing plain English. This makes it easier to grasp programming concepts without the noise of complex syntax. Other good options include JavaScript (especially if you're interested in web development) or even Scratch, a visual programming language that\u2019s ideal for absolute beginners.\nFollow a Structured Learning Path\nWhen you\u2019re just starting out with programming, one of the biggest challenges isn\u2019t writing code. It\u2019s knowing what to learn and when. I\u2019ve met so many beginners who start with enthusiasm, only to lose momentum because they\u2019re bouncing between tutorials, blog posts, YouTube videos, and Reddit threads.\nI get it. It feels like big progress. But without direction, it\u2019s easy to feel lost. I\u2019ve tried the \u201cDIY curriculum\u201d approach myself, stitching together random resources in hopes they\u2019d eventually click. Sometimes they did. But more often, I was overwhelmed, skipping foundational topics or jumping into advanced ones too soon.\nThat\u2019s why a structured learning path can make a world of difference. Rather than guessing the next step, you follow a well-laid-out roadmap that builds concepts layer by layer. Moreover, these are proven paths that other successful programmers have already taken.\nIf you're the type who benefits from that kind of structure, there are some fantastic resources to help. Roadmap.sh is a great visual guide. It shows you what topics to cover in a logical order for different paths, like frontend, backend, or DevOps. It even links to free resources for each topic. For more hands-on, interactive learning, try platforms like freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, or affordable options on Udemy. These sites offer step-by-step lessons and projects that build your skills progressively.\nUse Fun and Interactive Learning Resources\nLet\u2019s face it. Reading walls of technical documentation or staring at static code examples isn\u2019t everyone\u2019s idea of a good time. Some people do manage to go through them, but for many beginners, that kind of learning feels slow, confusing, and downright dull. And if something feels boring and hard, chances are you\u2019re not going to stick with it for long.\nBut here's the good news. Learning programming doesn\u2019t have to be a grind. There are tons of interactive, visual, and even gamified resources out there that can make the process a lot more enjoyable and more effective. Whether you\u2019re someone who learns best through videos, hands-on practice, or games, there\u2019s something out there for you.\nFor example, Scrimba offers a unique way to learn through interactive screencasts. You can pause the instructor and edit the code directly in the video player. CodeCombat and CheckiO turn coding into a game where you solve challenges by writing real code. Exercism.org gives you practical, bite-sized problems and personalized feedback from mentors.\nThe point is, you don\u2019t have to stick to dry textbooks or dense tutorials. Mix it up. Try out different formats until you find what clicks.\nCreate Small Projects\nFor a lot of new programmers, the biggest hurdle isn\u2019t the learning, it\u2019s the doing. Reading tutorials and solving exercises is one thing. But when it's time to build an actual project? Suddenly, you feel burdened. Where do you even start? What if you can\u2019t finish it? Should you be creating a full-stack app with user authentication and a fancy UI from day one?\nHere's the truth. You don\u2019t need to build anything massive to make meaningful progress. In fact, small projects are often the most effective way to complement what you\u2019ve learned. A project doesn\u2019t need to be flashy or complex to be valuable. It just needs to give you a chance to apply what you know and solve a real problem. You can create a small and meaningful project even in under 100 lines of code.\nThink small and focused. A simple expense tracker, a to-do list app, a recipe manager app, or maybe a quiz app. These might sound basic, but each one gives you a chance to practice key concepts like variables, conditionals, functions, loops, and user input. Additionally, once you complete one, you\u2019ll receive a significant boost in confidence and motivation to continue.\nIf you're looking for project ideas, just go to your favorite search engine and search for \"Beginner project ideas in X language.\" On another note, some platforms offer project-based learning, meaning you learn different key coding concepts by building projects. Frontend Mentor (great for UI-based challenges), DevProjects by Codementor, CodeCrafters are some great places to get ideas.\nGet Some Programming Buddies\nThere\u2019s a saying that even boring tasks become fun when you do them with someone else. Learning to code is no exception. Know someone in your circle who's also interested in coding? That\u2019s a great opportunity! Learning together, even informally, can make the process feel less daunting and a lot more enjoyable.\nHaving a buddy or a group to learn with brings a lot of benefits. When you get stuck on a bug or a tricky concept, you have someone to talk it through with. Sometimes, just explaining a problem out loud helps you understand it better. And when it\u2019s the other way around and you\u2019re the one doing the explaining, you\u2019ll reinforce your own knowledge in the process.\nBut beyond just problem-solving, learning with others keeps you motivated. You\u2019re more likely to stick with something when you\u2019re part of a community, even a small one. You can swap project ideas, share wins and struggles, review each other\u2019s code, or take on challenges together.\nIf you don\u2019t know anyone personally who's into programming, don\u2019t worry. There are plenty of online communities you can join. Platforms like freeCodeCamp Forum, r/learnprogramming on Reddit, The Odin Project Discord, and CodeNewbie are all filled with beginners and mentors eager to help and connect.\nLearning to program is a journey, not a race.

      "text": "Summary\n- Notepad now supports rich text formatting, including Markdown, making it more modern.\n- Users can toggle between Markdown view and raw syntax view, with an option to disable all formatting.\n- The new features are beneficial for some, but controversial for those who prefer Notepad's simplicity.\nNotepad has been around for decades, but Microsoft only really started \"upgrading\" the app with Windows 11. It looks, and feels, much more modern now. And with the latest update, it's going a step further, though some users might be conflicted with this.\nMicrosoft's Notepad is adding support for rich text formatting for your text files. This includes a new formatting toolbar as well as support for Markdown, which lets you quickly format text manually as well. More specifically, if you happen to frequently work with Markdown for documentation, web content, or note-taking, you will now find native support within Notepad. The application will allow users to directly input Markdown style and will correctly interpret .md files.\nSimilarly, if you'd rather use the good old formatting bar, the option is available on top of your Notepad window, letting you select text and format it by just clicking a button. And if you want to revert to the old pure plain-text experience, a \"clear all formatting\" option is available from both the formatting toolbar and the traditional edit menu that will erase any formatting that might be currently applied to your text or a specific sentence. It's the same controls you would get from an app like Microsoft Word, for one.\nYou can easily switch between the rendered, formatted Markdown view and the raw Markdown syntax view. This toggle is accessible through the view menu or via a dedicated button in the status bar at the bottom of the Notepad window. And if you'd rather not have formatting at all (there are a lot of reasons why that might be the case), Microsoft has included an option in the app settings to disable support for formatting entirely.\nThis option might turn out to be a tad controversial for some people. For many, Notepad is good precisely because it's a no-frills text editor that doesn't have many features except displaying plain text. Because of that, rich text formatting could actually disrupt things. Just because you're wrapping something in asterisks doesn't necessarily mean that you want that to be bolded or cursive. Thankfully, for those people, the option can either be temporarily toggled off or completely turned off.\nFor others, the feature might actually come in very handy. Microsoft Word, for one, doesn't work with Markdown natively, so this could be the tool people reach for if they want to write something in Markdown offline, or if they want to interpret Markdown text on a .txt file. It's pretty neat.\nThe feature is currently available for insiders, but it will roll out to everyone within the next few months.\nSource: Microsoft"

      "text": "Summary\n- You can re-enable original notepad.exe on Windows 11 by toggling its alias in Windows Settings.\n- Notepad++ is a feature-rich text editor that is a solid AI-free Notepad alternative.\nNotepad is a simple text editor that has been included with Windows from the very beginning, providing simple, hassle-free plain text editing to literally generations of computer users. It's practically holy ground, but now it has an AI assistant. Here's how to fix that.\nRestoring Old School notepad.exe\nIf you're running Windows 11, at some point in the past, your version of Notepad was transparently replaced with a shiny new version from the Microsoft Store (the default app store available in Windows). When you run Notepad from the start menu or by running notepad.exe from the run dialog, this app store version is what is opened by default.\nThis version is the one that is being tainted with an AI assistant that can rewrite your text to make it shorter, longer, more formal, and most likely homogenized, and AI-like. As an extra kicker, it does this by sending the contents of your text file to Microsoft's servers, and they might even start charging you for it.\nThankfully, you can still re-enable the old version of Notepad by opening the Settings App (press Windows+i) and navigating to Apps > Advanced App Settings > App Execution Aliases and toggling off Notepad. Once you've done that, running notepad.exe from the Run dialog (accessed by pressing Windows+R, or right-clicking on the Start button) will open notepad.exe in its former glory.\nYou can also create a shortcut to it by right-clicking on the desktop, selecting New > Shortcut, and entering notepad.exe into the location field.\nNotepad++: Arguably The Best Notepad Alternative\nIf you want to take this opportunity to find a notepad replacement that has a few extra bells and whistles (while still being lightweight), Notepad++ is an AI free plain text editor that has been a favorite with programmers for years, and retains that native \"Windows\" feel and responsiveness (probably because it's not a bloated Electron mess).\nIf you're looking to edit rich text (with formatting, font sizes, and images) or do some desktop publishing, there are Microsoft Word alternatives that offer a bunch of sophisticated features."

      "text": "The new Notepad update, version 11.2501.29.0, comes with two main features. The first one is a summarization tool, and the second is the Snipping Tool helping you make boxes and arrows more professionally.\nThe summarization tool uses AI to create summaries of the text you select. You can highlight the text, right-click to find the summarization option or press Ctrl + M on your keyboard. You can also choose how short or long you want the summary to be. This is pretty standard AI writing tools that exist in many other applications now.\nTo use this feature, you need a Microsoft personal account, and if you have Microsoft 365 Personal, Family, or Copilot Pro, you'll use AI credits. You can turn off this feature in the app settings if you prefer. Keep in mind that the AI isn't reliable, and it would likely be better for you to just read the text yourself.\nThe second new feature is a recent files option, which has been something I've wanted for a long time. I've accidentally closed windows and documents on Notepad more times than I can count, and going all the way back to find them has been a pain. This new update lets you easily access and reopen files you've recently closed from the File menu.\nYou can also delete the list of recent files if you don't want to see it or disable this feature in the app settings. For those concerned about privacy, the recent files won't say exactly what you were writing; the list will just show the title of the document.\nThe updates to the Snipping Tool aim to make it easier for users who often use its annotation features. The new \"draw & hold\" option specifically helps users create more precise shapes, which is great because using that freehand drawing tool was difficult. Basically, you draw the shape you want, and the tool will adjust it and make it look pretty.\nThe improved launch protocol will also let developers integrate the Snipping Tool into their apps more easily. That means regular users may see the snipping tool more often in their other applications.\nBoth updates are being rolled out to Windows Insiders in the Canary and Dev channels. Microsoft has indicated that the rollout will happen gradually, so not everyone will get these features right away. I'd suggest checking back every day or so until it comes; any sooner, you'll be disappointed pretty often.\nMicrosoft made a bigger deal of asking for feedback this time around. It makes sense because this is a bigger change to Notepad, and Copilot has a tendency to do strange things, as with most generative AI services. You can provide feedback through the Feedback Hub app (using WIN + F) under the Apps section, where there are separate areas for the Snipping Tool and Notepad.\nAnyone who wants to see the full version of the Notepad update will likely have to wait a bit. The Snipping Tool's update is just a regular new feature, whereas the Notepad update is attempting to add Notepad to an AI ecosystem. It's not hard to think that a fully ready version of the Notepad update will take a while to test before a full release.\nSource: Microsoft"

      "url": "https://www.howtogeek.com/what-is-a-bat-file/",
      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\n- A BAT file is a script containing commands, written in plain text with a .bat extension.\n- Batch files are versatile, executing built-in Windows commands or programs with command-line interfaces.\n- Batch files are run by double-clicking them, and can be edited with any plain text editor.\nYou'll frequently see references to batch or \"bat\" files if you use Windows. Sometimes they're used to start another program, whereas other times they might do something on their own. But what exactly is a batch file, and how do you use one?\nWhat is a BAT File?\nA bat file, otherwise called a batch file, is a script file that contains commands. The file itself is written in plain text and has a \".bat\" file extension.\nThere aren\u2019t too many limitations on what those commands can be. They can be commands built into Windows, like the del or shutdown command, but you can also run and use programs that have command-line interfaces via a batch file too.\nMost often, batch files used when you need to run a command regularly or when you need to run multiple commands sequentially. It is also possible to write batch files that respond to user input\u2014like answering yes or no, or picking an option from a list\u2014to do different things.\nHow Do You Use a BAT File?\nTo use a BAT file, just double click it. If it has been written correctly, the commands it contain will execute and perform some function.\nIn some situations, you may only see Command Prompt or Terminal open for an instant and then close. Other times, the command may take long enough to run that you have a chance to look at it, or it may contain a line at the end that forces it to stay open until you manually close it.\nYou shouldn\u2019t assume either behavior means a BAT file didn\u2019t work unless you know what it is supposed to do.\nAs an example: if you\u2019re using a batch file to launch a dedicated game server, you\u2019d normally expect the window to stay open, so you can see output from the server. On the other hand, if you\u2019re just using a batch file that triggers a computer restart with specific options enabled, then you would expect it to open and then close almost instantly.\nHow to Open or Read a BAT File?\nBatch files are plain text documents and can be opened in just about every text editor out there. Notepad is the typical choice, but more sophisticated plain text editors might offer helpful features, like syntax highlighting and debugging tools.\nTo open a batch file in Notepad, right-click the BAT file and select \u201cEdit\" or \"Edit with Notepad.\"\nAlternatively, launch Notepad, click to File>Open, and then navigate to the batch file and click \u201cOpen.\u201d\nOnce it opens, you\u2019ll see all of the commands. Here is an example:\nIf you\u2019re just checking out what a simple BAT file does Notepad is likely fine, but if you want to edit one, or make it easier to understand what you\u2019re looking at, you should try VSCode instead.\nIf you want to write or edit a batch file, either will work, but the syntax highlighting included in more powerful plain text editors is too good to pass up.\nAre BAT Files Dangerous?\nBAT files are not inherently malware, but they can be used maliciously, and you should always treat them with a bit of caution. For example, a batch file could be written such that it deletes your files when you run it. One could also be configured to download malware from the Internet. There are countless ways in which a batch file could be used maliciously.\nThose warnings aside, the overwhelming majority of batch files floating around are not malicious. Most exist just to make some common, complex job a bit easier. If you download a file or program from a trustworthy source, you likely do not have anything to worry about.\nHowever, if you download a BAT file from a less-than-reputable source, you should take a moment to open the BAT file up in Notepad to take a look at what it is doing before you run it.\nWhat Can You Use Instead of a BAT File?\nThere are a few alternatives to batch files on Windows. The most obvious is a PS1 file, which is the PowerShell equivalent of a BAT file. BAT files can run PowerShell commands if you include special arguments, but it is usually easier to just write a PS1 file instead.\nBeyond PowerShell scripts, Python is the most obvious choice. Python can call operating system functions, and it has the added bonus of an enormous number of modules to do almost anything you can imagine. For many applications it\u2019d be overkill, but if you need to do something complicated, you should definitely consider Python."
