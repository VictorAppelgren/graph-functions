      "text": "- Hong Kong\n- /\n- Consumer Services\n- /\n- SEHK:2262\nCapital World Leads The Charge With 2 Global Penny Stocks\nReviewed by Simply Wall St\nGlobal markets have recently experienced a mix of modest gains and declines, with U.S. small-cap stocks outperforming larger indices, while geopolitical concerns and economic uncertainties weigh on European equities. Amid these fluctuating conditions, investors often seek opportunities in lesser-known areas of the market that offer potential for growth. Penny stocks, although an older term, remain relevant as they represent smaller or newer companies that can provide unique investment opportunities when supported by strong financial health. In this article, we will explore several global penny stocks that could offer long-term potential due to their solid financial foundations.\nTop 10 Penny Stocks Globally\n| Name | Share Price | Market Cap | Rewards & Risks |\n| Lever Style (SEHK:1346) | HK$1.56 | HK$964.89M | \u2705 4 \u26a0\ufe0f 1 View Analysis > |\n| Warpaint London (AIM:W7L) | \u00a33.15 | \u00a3254.48M | \u2705 5 \u26a0\ufe0f 2 View Analysis > |\n| HSS Engineers Berhad (KLSE:HSSEB) | MYR0.66 | MYR335.6M | \u2705 4 \u26a0\ufe0f 3 View Analysis > |\n| TK Group (Holdings) (SEHK:2283) | HK$2.55 | HK$2.12B | \u2705 4 \u26a0\ufe0f 1 View Analysis > |\n| Angler Gaming (NGM:ANGL) | SEK3.60 | SEK269.95M | \u2705 4 \u26a0\ufe0f 2 View Analysis > |\n| CNMC Goldmine Holdings (Catalist:5TP) | SGD0.67 | SGD271.54M | \u2705 4 \u26a0\ufe0f 2 View Analysis > |\n| Deleum Berhad (KLSE:DELEUM) | MYR1.51 | MYR606.35M | \u2705 5 \u26a0\ufe0f 1 View Analysis > |\n| Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) (SGX:BS6) | SGD3.10 | SGD12.2B | \u2705 5 \u26a0\ufe0f 1 View Analysis > |\n| Deceuninck (ENXTBR:DECB) | \u20ac2.085 | \u20ac288.19M | \u2705 4 \u26a0\ufe0f 1 View Analysis > |\n| Netgem (ENXTPA:ALNTG) | \u20ac0.934 | \u20ac31.5M | \u2705 4 \u26a0\ufe0f 2 View Analysis > |\nClick here to see the full list of 3,729 stocks from our Global Penny Stocks screener.\nLet's explore several standout options from the results in the screener.\nCapital World (Catalist:1D5)\nSimply Wall St Financial Health Rating: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\nOverview: Capital World Limited is an investment holding company focused on property development and other activities in Singapore and Malaysia, with a market cap of SGD32.20 million.\nOperations: The company has not reported any specific revenue segments.\nMarket Cap: SGD32.2M\nCapital World Limited, with a market cap of SGD32.20 million, is pre-revenue and currently unprofitable but has been reducing its losses over the past five years at a rate of 36.3% annually.
