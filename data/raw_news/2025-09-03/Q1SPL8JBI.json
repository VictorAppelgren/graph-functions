  "title": "Never Used Proton GE Before for Linux Gaming? Here's What Makes It Different",
  "description": "Two sides of the same coin?",
  "content": "Linux gamers are familiar with Proton, the go-to solution for running Windows games on Linux, but there\u2019s another, similar tool in the shed. It\u2019s called Proton GE, and while it performs the same function, it differs from Valve\u2019s Proton. Let\u2019s find out how they differ and which one you should use.\n\nProton Is a Compatibility Layer for Windows Games on Linux\n\nNow, while Linux and Windows can run on the same hardware, they\u2019re wildly different beasts software-wise. For instance, you can use both Linux and Windows on the exact same machine made of precisely the same components. However, try running a game designed for Windows on the same PC that runs Linux, and you\u2019re going to have a bad time. This is where Proton comes to the rescue.\n\nItself a free and open-source fork of Wine, which is a compatibility layer that allows running Windows software in general on Unix-like operating systems (such as Linux and macOS), Proton focuses on games and includes a patched Wine core but also extra components such as DXVK\u2014a translation layer that transforms DirectX calls to Vulkan\u2014along with various others. Together, the different components that are part of Proton work together to allow Windows games to run on Linux.\n\nProton works as a map and translator for Windows games, allowing them to run on Linux. For instance, when you run a Windows game that supports both DirectX and Vulkan, it functions as a map that shows the game how to access the Vulkan API (Application Programming Interface) and how to reach and access different components, such as the CPU or memory.\n\nBut many games don't support Vulkan. When you play such a game on your Linux machine, Proton plays the role of a translator, translating DirectX API calls to Vulkan API calls. In many cases, Proton acts as both a map and a translator, showing the game how and where to access Vulkan API and hardware components, while also translating various Windows-specific system calls to Linux-specific ones and vice versa.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s no emulation here because the games are made for the same, usually x86-based, hardware. However, the amount of software-based translation included varies depending on the specific title.\n\nProton GE is an Unofficial Fork of Proton\n\nProton GE is an unofficial fork of Proton that isn\u2019t in any way affiliated with the official version of Proton developed by Valve. The GE version of Proton is created and maintained by a solo developer, Glorious Eggroll (hence the name).\n\nUnlike Valve\u2019s Proton, Proton GE is based on a newer, bleeding-edge experimental version of Wine. The latest stable version of Valve\u2019s Proton, on the other hand, is always behind the latest version of Proton GE regarding the Wine version it\u2019s based on, which makes it more stable but can also result in worse performance and incompatibilities with certain games compared to using Proton GE.\n\nProton GE also comes with extra components built in. Stuff such as media playback fixes, AMD FSR patches, and a \u201cprotonfixes\u201d system that applies fixes on a per-game basis, allowing certain games to work with Proton GE even though they don\u2019t work with Valve\u2019s Proton.\n\nIn general, Proton GE can allow you to enjoy a game that doesn\u2019t work with Valve\u2019s Proton or offer better performance compared to Valve\u2019s Proton. On the flip side, using Proton GE can lead to instability or introduce bugs and glitches that won\u2019t occur when using Valve\u2019s Proton.\n\nProton Is Usually the Way to Go, but Sometimes Proton GE Is Better\n\nSo, is it better to use regular Proton or Proton GE? Based on my experience as a long-term Steam Deck user, regular Proton is the better option in most cases.\n\nIt\u2019s included with Steam, and you can easily swap out different versions manually by opening a game's \"Properties\" menu in Steam, visiting the \"Compatibility\" tab, and finally ticking the \"Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool\" checkbox.\n\nThis allows you to experiment with various stable versions or use the latest experimental version of Proton, which is based on a more recent version of Wine compared to the latest stable version of Proton.\n\nRunning Proton Experimental can make a game that\u2019s just come out work on your Linux PC, even though it doesn\u2019t work when combined with the latest stable version of Proton.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that Proton GE can\u2019t be handy in certain situations. For example, I couldn\u2019t make Batman: Arkham Asylum work on my Steam Deck no matter which version of Proton I used. The game would immediately crash even with the latest experimental version of Proton. But then I found out about Proton GE. And what do you know? Downloading and applying it made the game run flawlessly, from start to finish.\n\nSimilarly, Dragon Age: The Veilguard ran very poorly on Steam Deck back when it came out, at least via Valve\u2019s Proton. But when I switched to the latest version Proton GE, I got a noticeable performance bump that made the game run at a stable 30 FPS with dips to the high 20s only during cutscenes.\n\nAnother situation where Proton GE is recommended over the regular Proton is if you encounter issues with in-game video playback. If you encounter colored bars in place of in-game videos, installing and applying the latest version of Proton GE usually solves the problem because Proton GE includes various media playback-related patches that aren\u2019t found in Valve\u2019s Proton.\n\nIf you aren\u2019t sure whether to try out an experimental version of regular Proton or Proton GE, go to ProtonDB.com, search for the game you\u2019re having issues with, and see what the community recommends in the user reports section.\n\nHow to Get Proton GE on a Steam Deck\n\nIf you own a Steam Deck, you can download and install Proton GE relatively painlessly. First, switch to Desktop mode. Once there, open the Discovery store, search for \"ProtonUp-Qt,\" and then download and install the app.\n\nAll Linux users can download the app as a Flatpak from the ProtonUp-Qt Flathub page.\n\nNext, open the app, and you\u2019ll be presented with a list of different Proton GE versions. It\u2019s usually best to install the latest one unless you have found a solution that recommends using a specific version of Proton GE.\n\nNow you can switch back to Game mode, open the game you want to use Proton GE with, and open its options tab.\n\nOnce inside the options tab, click and open the \"Properties\" menu.\n\nNext, click the \"Compatibility\" tab, and tick the \"Force the use of a specific Steam Play compatibility tool\" checkbox. Then simply select Proton GE instead of Proton and you're golden.\n\nAs you can see, Proton and Proton GE are very similar. They\u2019re both based on Wine and serve the same purpose. Proton GE is an unofficial fork of Proton, packing additional goodies that can make certain games work even though they don\u2019t work with regular Proton, as well as help with in-game video playback issues. In most cases, I recommend using a stable or experimental version of Proton. However, if neither helps with a game you\u2019re trying to play, Proton GE is the next best option.",

      "text": "Proton is a tool for use with the Steam client which allows games which are exclusive to Windows to run on the Linux operating system. It uses Wine to facilitate this.\nMost users should use Proton provided by the Steam Client itself. See this Steam Community post for more details.\nThe source code is provided to enable advanced users the ability to alter Proton. For example, some users may wish to use a different version of Wine with a particular title.\nThe changelog is available on our wiki.\nAcquire Proton's source by cloning https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton and checking out the branch you desire.\nYou can clone the latest Proton to your system with this command:\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton.git proton\nBe sure to update submodules when switching between branches:\ngit checkout experimental_6.3\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\nIf you want to change any subcomponent, now is the time to do so. For\nexample, if you wish to make changes to Wine, you would apply them to the\nwine/\ndirectory.\nMost of Proton builds inside the Proton SDK container with very few dependencies on the host side.\nYou need either a Docker or a Podman setup. We highly recommend the rootless Podman setup. Please refer to your distribution's documentation for setup instructions (e.g. Arch Podman / Docker, Debian Podman / Docker).\nWe provide a top-level Makefile which will execute most of the build commands for you.\nAfter checking out the repository and updating its submodules, assuming that you have a working Docker or Podman setup, you can build and install Proton with a simple:\nmake install\nIf your build system is missing dependencies, it will fail quickly with a clear error message.\nAfter the build finishes, you may need to restart the Steam client to see the\nnew Proton tool. The tool's name in the Steam client will be based on the\ncurrently checked out branch of Proton. You can override this name using the\nbuild_name\nvariable.\nSee make help\nfor other build targets and options.\nmkdir ../build && cd ../build\n../proton/configure.sh --enable-ccache --build-name=my_build\nRunning configure.sh\nwill create a Makefile\nallowing you to build Proton.\nThe scripts checks if containers are functional and prompt you if any\nhost-side dependencies are missing. You should run the command from a\ndirectory created specifically for your build.\nThe configuration script tries to discover a working Docker or Podman setup\nto use, but you can force a compatible engine with\n--container-engine=<executable_name>\n.\nYou can enable ccache with --enable-cache\nflag. This will mount your\n$CCACHE_DIR\nor $HOME/.ccache\ninside the container.\n--proton-sdk-image=registry.gitlab.steamos.cloud/proton/soldier/sdk:<version>\ncan be used to build with a custom version of the Proton SDK images.\nCheck --help\nfor other configuration options.\nNOTE: If SELinux is in use, the Proton build container may fail to access\nyour user's files. This is caused by SELinux's filesystem\nlabels. You may pass the --relabel-volumes\nswitch to\nconfigure to cause the container engine to relabel its\nbind-mounts and allow access to those files from within the\ncontainer. This can be dangerous when used with system directories. Proceed\nwith caution and refer your container engine's manual.\nmake\nImportant make targets:\nmake install\n- install Proton into your user's Steam directory, see the install Proton\nlocally section for details.\nmake redist\n- create a redistribute build (redist/\n) that can be copied to\n~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/\n.\nmake deploy\n- create a deployment build (deploy/\n). This is what we use to\ndeploy Proton to Steam users via Steamworks.\nmake module=<module> module\n- build both 32- and 64-bit versions of the\nspecified wine module. This allows rapid iteration on one module. This target\nis only useful after building Proton.\nmake dxvk\n/ make vkd3d-proton\n- rebuild DXVK / vkd3d-proton.\nTo prevent symbol stripping add UNSTRIPPED_BUILD=1\nto the make\ninvocation. This should be used only with a clean build directory.\nE.g.:\nmkdir ../debug-proton-build && cd ../debug-proton-build\n../proton/configure.sh --enable-ccache --build-name=debug_build\nmake UNSTRIPPED_BUILD=1 install\nSteam ships with several versions of Proton, which games will use by default or that you can select in Steam Settings' Steam Play page. Steam also supports running games with local builds of Proton, which you can install on your machine.\nTo install a local build of Proton into Steam, make a new directory in\n~/.steam/root/compatibilitytools.d/\nwith a tool name of your choosing and\nplace the directory containing your redistributable build under that path.\nThe make install\ntarget will perform this task for you, installing the\nProton build into the Steam folder for the current user. You will have to\nrestart the Steam client for it to pick up on a new tool.\nA correct local tool installation should look similar to this:\ncompatibilitytools.d/my_proton/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 compatibilitytool.vdf\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 filelock.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 proton\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 proton_dist.tar\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 toolmanifest.vdf\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 user_settings.sample.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 version\nTo enable your local build in Steam, go to the Steam Play section of the Settings window. If the build was correctly installed, you should see \"proton-localbuild\" in the drop-down list of compatibility tools.\nEach component of this software is used under the terms of their licenses.\nSee the LICENSE\nfiles here, as well as the LICENSE\n, COPYING\n, etc files\nin each submodule and directory for details. If you distribute a built\nversion of Proton to other users, you must adhere to the terms of these\nlicenses.\nProton builds have their symbols stripped by default. You can switch to \"debug\" beta branch in Steam (search for Proton in your library, Properties... -> BETAS -> select \"debug\") or build without stripping (see Debug Builds section).\nThe symbols are provided through the accompanying .debug\nfiles which may\nneed to be explicitly loaded by the debugging tools. For GDB there's a helper\nscript wine/tools/gdbinit.py\n(source it) that provides load-symbol-files\n(or lsf\nfor short) command which loads the symbols for all the mapped files.\nFor tips on debugging see docs/DEBUGGING-LINUX.md and docs/DEBUGGING-WINDOWS.md.\nFor use with clangd LSP server and similar tooling.\nProjects built using cmake or meson (e.g. vkd3d-proton) automatically come with\ncompile_commands.json\n. For autotools (e.g. wine) you have to configure the\nbuild with --enable-bear\nthat uses\nbear to create the compilation database.\nIt's not on by default as it make the build slightly slower.\nThe build system collects all the created compile_commands.json files in a\nbuild subdirectory named compile_commands/\n.\nThe paths are translated to point to the real source (i.e. not the rsynced\ncopy). It still may depend on build directory for things like auto-generated\nconfig.h\nthough and for wine it may be beneficial to run tools/make_requests\nin you source directories as those changes are not committed.\nYou can then configure your editor to use that file for clangd in a few ways:\n- directly - some editors/plugins allow you to specify the path to\ncompile_commands.json\n- via\n.clangd\nfile, e.g.\ncd src/proton/wine/\ncat > .clangd <<EOF\nCompileFlags:\nCompilationDatabase: ../build/current-dev/compile_commands/wine64/\nEOF\n- by symlinking:\nln -s ../build/current-dev/compile_commands/wine64/compile_commands.json .\nProton can be tuned at runtime to help certain games run. The Steam client sets\nsome options for known games using the STEAM_COMPAT_CONFIG\nvariable.\nYou can override these options using the environment variables described below.\nThe best way to set these environment overrides for all games is by renaming\nuser_settings.sample.py\nto user_settings.py\nand modifying it appropriately.\nThis file is located in the Proton installation directory in your Steam library\n(often ~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Proton #.#\n).\nIf you want to change the runtime configuration for a specific game, you can\nuse the Set Launch Options\nsetting in the game's Properties\ndialog in the\nSteam client. Set the variable, followed by %command%\n. For example, input\n\"PROTON_USE_WINED3D=1 %command%\n\" to use the OpenGL-based wined3d renderer\ninstead of the Vulkan-based DXVK renderer.\nTo enable an option, set the variable to a non-0\nvalue. To disable an\noption, set the variable to 0\n. To use Steam's default configuration, do\nnot specify the variable at all.\nAll of the below are runtime options. They do not effect permanent changes to the Wine prefix. Removing the option will revert to the previous behavior.\n| Compat config string | Environment Variable | Description |\n|---|---|---|\nPROTON_LOG |\nConvenience method for dumping a useful debug log to $PROTON_LOG_DIR/steam-$APPID.log . Set to 1 to enable default logging, or set to a string to be appended to the default WINEDEBUG channels. |\n|\nPROTON_LOG_DIR |\nOutput log files into the directory specified. Defaults to your home directory. | |\nPROTON_WAIT_ATTACH |\nWait for a debugger to attach to steam.exe before launching the game process. To attach to the game process at startup, debuggers should be set to follow child processes. | |\nPROTON_CRASH_REPORT_DIR |\nWrite crash logs into this directory. Does not clean up old logs, so may eat all your disk space eventually. | |\nwined3d |\nPROTON_USE_WINED3D |\nUse OpenGL-based wined3d instead of Vulkan-based DXVK for d3d11, d3d10, and d3d9. |\nnod3d11 |\nPROTON_NO_D3D11 |\nDisable d3d11.dll , for d3d11 games which can fall back to and run better with d3d9. |\nnod3d10 |\nPROTON_NO_D3D10 |\nDisable d3d10.dll and dxgi.dll , for d3d10 games which can fall back to and run better with d3d9. |\ndxvkd3d8 |\nPROTON_DXVK_D3D8 |\nUse DXVK's d3d8.dll . |\nnoesync |\nPROTON_NO_ESYNC |\nDo not use eventfd-based in-process synchronization primitives. |\nnofsync |\nPROTON_NO_FSYNC |\nDo not use futex-based in-process synchronization primitives. (Automatically disabled on systems with no FUTEX_WAIT_MULTIPLE support.) |\nnoxim |\nPROTON_NO_XIM |\nEnabled by default. Do not attempt to use XIM (X Input Methods) support. XIM support is known to cause crashes with libx11 older than version 1.7. |\ndisablenvapi |\nPROTON_DISABLE_NVAPI |\nDisable NVIDIA's NVAPI GPU support library. |\nnativevulkanloader |\nUse the Vulkan loader shipped with the game instead of Proton's built-in Vulkan loader. This breaks VR support, but is required by a few games. | |\nforcelgadd |\nPROTON_FORCE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE |\nForce Wine to enable the LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE flag for all executables. Enabled by default. |\nheapdelayfree |\nPROTON_HEAP_DELAY_FREE |\nDelay freeing some memory, to work around application use-after-free bugs. |\ngamedrive |\nPROTON_SET_GAME_DRIVE |\nCreate an S: drive which points to the Steam Library which contains the game. |\nnoforcelgadd |\nDisable forcelgadd. If both this and forcelgadd are set, enabled wins. |\n|\noldglstr |\nPROTON_OLD_GL_STRING |\nSet some driver overrides to limit the length of the GL extension string, for old games that crash on very long extension strings. |\nvkd3dfl12 |\nForce the Direct3D 12 feature level to 12, regardless of driver support. | |\nvkd3dbindlesstb |\nPut force_bindless_texel_buffer into VKD3D_CONFIG . |\n|\nnomfdxgiman |\nWINE_DO_NOT_CREATE_DXGI_DEVICE_MANAGER |\nEnable hack to work around video issues in some games due to incomplete IMFDXGIDeviceManager support. |\nnoopwr |\nWINE_DISABLE_VULKAN_OPWR |\nEnable hack to disable Vulkan other process window rendering which sometimes causes issues on Wayland due to blit being one frame behind. |\nhidenvgpu |\nPROTON_HIDE_NVIDIA_GPU |\nForce Nvidia GPUs to always be reported as AMD GPUs. Some games require this if they depend on Windows-only Nvidia driver functionality. See also DXVK's nvapiHack config, which only affects reporting from Direct3D. |\nWINE_FULLSCREEN_INTEGER_SCALING |\nEnable integer scaling mode, to give sharp pixels when upscaling. | |\ncmdlineappend: |\nAppend the string after the colon as an argument to the game command. May be specified more than once. Escape commas and backslashes with a backslash. | |\nxalia or noxalia |\nPROTON_USE_XALIA |\nEnable Xalia, a program that can add a gamepad UI for some keyboard/mouse interfaces, or set to 0 to disable. The default is to enable it dynamically based on window contents. |\nseccomp |\nPROTON_USE_SECCOMP |\nNote: Obsoleted in Proton 5.13. In older versions, enable seccomp-bpf filter to emulate native syscalls, required for some DRM protections to work. |\nd9vk |\nPROTON_USE_D9VK |\nNote: Obsoleted in Proton 5.0. In older versions, use Vulkan-based DXVK instead of OpenGL-based wined3d for d3d9. |"

      "text": "Summary\n- WINE is a compatibility layer translating Windows apps on Linux, not an emulator.\n- Linux and macOS users can access Windows apps through WINE without emulation.\n- Despite some limitations, WINE provides a great way to access Windows software without Windows itself.\nLinux is at the peak of its popularity, but it's still an extremely niche desktop operating system. Say what you want about Windows, but its popularity means it has most of the software, but thanks to WINE Linux users have been partaking of Windows apps for over three decades.\nWhat Is WINE?\nWINE is one of those unique recursive acronyms that are popular in Open Source Software. It's short for \"WINE Is Not an Emulator,\" which will make sense when I tell you that WINE is a program that lets Windows software run on Linux or macOS. Except it doesn't do this by emulating Windows in any way.\nHow Does WINE Work?\nWINE is an example of a \"compatibility layer\" that sits between Windows software and Linux, translating the \"language\" of each software to the other. It's not an emulator, because it's not trying to emulate an entire system. There's no Windows emulation at all, just clever and efficient translation where needed. The basic process goes a little like this:\n- The Windows application makes a request, such as opening a file or displaying a window.\n- WINE intercepts this, and translates the request into the equivalent a native Linux application would have made.\n- Linux carries out the request, and WINE does the same thing but in the opposite direction.\nOf course, in reality this happens millions of times a second, and so the app runs pretty much like it would on Windows.\nWhy Use WINE?\nThere are plenty of good reasons to use WINE if you're a Linux or macOS user, the most obvious being you can get access to Windows apps that have no good Linux equivalent, or don't have a Linux port.\nWINE has also traditionally been a popular way to get Windows games to work on Linux. Modern Linux gaming, such as on Steam Deck, makes use of a specialized compatibility layer called Proton, which contains at least in part a modified version of the main WINE program.\nSteam Deck OLED\n- Power Source\n- 50Whr battery\n- What's Included\n- Console, charger, carrying case\n- Brand\n- Valve\n- Screen\n- 7.4-inch (diagonal) LCD display\n- Storage\n- 512GB NVMe SSD\n- CPU\n- Zen 2 4c/8t, 2.4-3.5GHz\nElevate your gaming experience with the Steam Deck OLED. Immerse yourself in stunning visuals on the vibrant OLED display, while enjoying powerful performance and portability.\nBecause it's a compatibility layer, and not an emulator or virtual machine, WINE doesn't add much computational overhead. So it's often the only way to get a usable experience out of, for example, low-end laptops running Linux.\nWINE is also a great (and legal) way to avoid paying for Windows when all you want to do is run a few specific applications that are only available for Microsoft's popular operating system.\nLimitations of WINE\nWhile WINE is certainly in great shape these days, it's not perfect. Not all applications work 100% with WINE, and its API translation isn't entirely complete. While it's less of an overhead than other approaches, WINE still adds overhead, and in some apps, particularly ones with heavy graphics, this can be a significant issue.\nThe other limitation of WINE is that getting a specific program to work can take a significant amount of tweaking, testing, and configuration. Time is money after all, and sometimes it's cheaper just to buy and run Windows to get certain software to work. You can use the WINEHQ app database to check how well specific applications work, such as this \"Platinum\" app list on the AppB main page.\nApps are ranked by how well they run, and you'll also get information on any specific issues or workarounds you need to employ.\nWINE Alternatives\nI've already mentioned Proton, which is what most people should use for gaming on Linux, but it's integrated into Steam which makes it less than ideal for games that aren't on Valve's storefront.\nVirtual machines are also a good alternative to WINE, since these days even mainstream CPUs have excellent virtualization support, which wasn't true for most of WINE's lifetime. Virtual machines do make it a little less integrated to use apps if you need to move files or information between the software on the VM and the native Linux host, but it's tolerable.\nCrossOver is a paid, commercial compatibility layer which is based on WINE, but is much more user-friendly, and comes with support.\nWhiskey is an awesome way to play Windows games on Mac that incorporates WINE as well as Apple's own Game Porting Toolkit.\nFinally, you can simply dual-boot Windows and Linux if you want to have your cake and eat it.\nThe Future of WINE\nWINE isn't going anywhere, and even its alternatives rely on this open-source project to one extent or another. There are thousands of people who contribute to WINE in one way or another, and they'll keep adding features, improving performance, and making it compatible with old and new software. Unless Linux somehow becomes popular enough to convince most software developers to have a native version of their apps for it, the need for WINE, or something like it, will be around for as long as Linux itself."

PROTON-GE DOES NOT COLLECT ANY USER DATA WHAT SO EVER AND IS NOT A COMPANY OR ORGANIZATION OF ANY TYPE.\nWarning\nRUNNING NON-STEAM GAMES WITH GE-PROTON OUTSIDE OF STEAM IS ONLY SUPPORTED USING UMU:\nProton runs in a container, which uses a runtime environment and libraries specifically built for use within that container. Not running it as intended results in the container and therefore its runtime not being used, and severely breaks library compatibility. It causes wine to search for libraries on your system instead of those it was built with/intended for within proton. It may work, if enough libraries match, but it is not correct and not supportable due to library differences across distros.\nIf you want proton functionality -outside- of proton for non-steam games, umu-launcher is a cli tool that was designed to be able to mimic steam in running the entire containerized runtime environment it needs in order to run proton exactly as steam does without needing steam. Any other method is not supported.\nLutris has already integrated UMU as the default backend used when GE-Proton(Latest)\nis selected as a wine runner either globally or for any specific game.\nHeroic has also enabled UMU by default when using GE-Proton\n.\nImportant\nIf you have an issue that happens with my proton-GE build, provided FROM this repository, that does -not- happen on Valve's proton, please DO NOT open a bug report on Valve's bug tracker.\nInstead, open an issue: https://github.com/GloriousEggroll/proton-ge-custom/issues\nor contact me on Discord about the issue: https://discord.gg/6y3BdzC\nNote\n(1) Please note, this is a custom build of proton, and is -not- affiliated with Valve's proton.\n(2) Please also note I do not provide the flatpak of proton-GE, and I do not provide the AUR version of proton-GE. I will not assist with those.\n(3) The only version of proton-GE that I provide and will assist with builds of is the one provided within this repository, using the build system documented here.\n(4) I cannot validate the accuracy or functionality of other builds that have not been built using the build system included here.\nThis is my build of Proton with the most recent bleeding-edge Proton Experimental WINE.\nThings it contains that Valve's Proton does not:\n- Additional media foundation patches for better video playback support\n- AMD FSR patches added directly to fullscreen hack that can be toggled with WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR=1\n- FSR Fake resolution patch details here\n- Nvidia CUDA support for PhysX and NVAPI\n- Raw input mouse support\n- 'protonfixes' system -- this is an automated system that applies per-game fixes (such as winetricks, envvars, EAC workarounds, overrides, etc).\n- Various upstream WINE patches backported\n- Various wine-staging patches applied as they become needed\n- NTSync enablement if the kernel supports it.\n- Warframe is problematic with VSync.

Unlimited framerate can cause slowdowns\n- Warframe on NVIDIA: you may need to disable GPU Particles in game otherwise the game can freeze randomly. On AMD they work fine\nFull patches can be viewed in protonprep-valve-staging.sh.\nPLEASE NOTE: There are prerequisites for using this version of proton:\n- You must have the proper Vulkan drivers/packages installed on your system. VKD3D on AMD requires Mesa 22.0.0 or higher for the VK_KHR_dynamic_rendering extension. Check here for general driver installation guidance.\nThere is an unofficial plugin for installing and managing ProtonGE versions\nwith asdf\n(the universal version manager), it follows\nthe same process as the manual installation but makes it a lot easier. Managing\nversions by removing and updating to newer versions also becomes easier.\nTo install by it first install asdf\n,\nand then proceed to add the ProtonGE plugin and install the version you want.\nasdf plugin add protonge\n# Or install a version from a tag (Eg.: GE-Proton8-25)\nasdf install protonge latest\nIt's also possible to use the asdf plugin in Flatpak installations, by\ncustomizing the target compatibilitytools.d\npath.

For more thorough logging, use user_settings.py . |\n|\n| PROTON_DUMP_DEBUG_COMMANDS | When running a game, Proton will write some useful debug scripts for that game into $PROTON_DEBUG_DIR/proton_$USER/ . |\n|\n| PROTON_DEBUG_DIR | Root directory for the Proton debug scripts, /tmp by default. |\n|\n| wined3d | PROTON_USE_WINED3D | Use OpenGL-based wined3d instead of Vulkan-based DXVK for d3d11 and d3d10. This used to be called PROTON_USE_WINED3D11 , which is now an alias for this same option. |\n| nod3d12 | PROTON_NO_D3D12 | Disables DX12. |\n| nod3d11 | PROTON_NO_D3D11 | Disables DX11. |\n| nod3d10 | PROTON_NO_D3D10 | Disables DX10. |\n| nod3d9 | PROTON_NO_D3D9 | Disables DX9. |\n| noesync | PROTON_NO_ESYNC | Do not use eventfd-based in-process synchronization primitives. |\n| nofsync | PROTON_NO_FSYNC | Do not use futex-based in-process synchronization primitives. (Automatically disabled on systems with no FUTEX_WAIT_MULTIPLE support.) |\n| nontsync | PROTON_NO_NTSYNC | Do not use ntsync kernel module for in-process synchronization primitives. |\n| forcelgadd | PROTON_FORCE_LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE | Force Wine to enable the LARGE_ADDRESS_AWARE flag for all executables. |\n| heapdelayfree | PROTON_HEAP_DELAY_FREE | Delay freeing some memory, to work around application use-after-free bugs. |\n| noxim | PROTON_NO_XIM | Enabled by default. Do not attempt to use XIM (X Input Methods) support. XIM support is known to cause crashes with libx11 older than version 1.7. |\n| enablenvapi | PROTON_ENABLE_NVAPI | Enable NVIDIA's NVAPI GPU support library. |\n| noforcelgadd | Disable forcelgadd. If both this and forcelgadd are set, enabled wins. |\n|\n| oldglstr | PROTON_OLD_GL_STRING | Set some driver overrides to limit the length of the GL extension string, for old games that crash on very long extension strings. |\n| cmdlineappend: | Append the string after the colon as an argument to the game command. May be specified more than once. Escape commas and backslashes with a backslash. | |\n| xalia or noxalia | PROTON_USE_XALIA | Enable Xalia, a program that can add a gamepad UI for some keyboard/mouse interfaces, or set to 0 to disable. The default is to enable it dynamically based on window contents. |\n| seccomp | PROTON_USE_SECCOMP | Enable seccomp-bpf filter to emulate native syscalls, required for some DRM protections to work. |\n| nowritewatch | PROTON_NO_WRITE_WATCH | Disable support for memory write watches in ntdll. This is a very dangerous hack and should only be applied if you have verified that the game can operate without write watches. This improves performance for some very specific games (e.g. CoreRT-based games). |\n| WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR | Enable AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 1, use in conjunction with WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_STRENGTH . Only works in Vulkan games (DXVK and VKD3D-Proton included). |\n|\n| WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_STRENGTH | AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) strength, the default sharpening of 5 is enough without needing modification, but can be changed with 0-5 if wanted. 0 is the maximum sharpness, higher values mean less sharpening. 2 is the AMD recommended default and is set by GE-Proton by default. | |\n| WINE_FULLSCREEN_FSR_CUSTOM_MODE | Set fake resolution of the screen. This can be useful in games that render in native resolution regardless of the selected resolution. Parameter WIDTHxHEIGHT |\n|\n| WINE_DO_NOT_CREATE_DXGI_DEVICE_MANAGER | Set to 1 to enable. Required for video playback in some games to not be miscolored (usually tinted pink) | |\n| COPYPREFIX | Set to 1 to enable. If -steamdeck is used on steam (or SteamDeck=1 is set), copies the game's prefix and shader cache from the game partition to the local steam steamapps folder. Logic is reversed if -steamdeck not enabled (or SteamDeck=0) |\nAs many of you may or may not already know, there is a Credits section in the README for this Git repository. My proton-ge project contains some of my personal tweaks to Proton, but a large amount of the patches, rebases and fixes come from numerous people's projects. While I tend to get credited for my builds, a lot of the work that goes into it are from other people as well. I'd like to take some time to point a few of these people out of recognition. In future builds, I plan to make clearer and more informative Git commits, as well as attempt to give these people further crediting, as my README may not be sufficient in doing so.\nI and many others owe TKG. In regards to both WINE and Proton. He has dedicated a lot of time (2+ years at least) to rebasing WINE and Proton patches, as well as making his own contributions. Before he came along, I did some rebasing work, and mainly only released things for Arch. These days he almost always beats me to rebasing, and it saves myself and others a lot of work.\nDerek was responsible for the original rawinput patches, as well as several various game fixes in the past, just to name a few: MK11, FFXV, MHW, Steep, AC Odyssey FS fix. He has also done a massive amount of work on media foundation/mfplat, which should be hopefully working very soon.\nJoshua is the creator of D9VK and also a huge contributor of DXVK. He is also known for his recent DOOM Eternal WINE fixes and also many of the Vulkan tweaks and fixes used, such as FS hack interger scaling.\nPhilip is the creator of DXVK and a heavy contributor of VKD3D. He also put up a lot of my bug reporting for Warframe years ago, when DXVK started.\nHans-Kristian is a heavy contributor of VKD3D and he also created a lot of WINE patches that allowed WoW to work.\nEthan is the creator of FAudio, and he also listened to my Warframe bug reports years ago.\nChris is the creator of the original Protonfixes project. The portions of Protonfixes I've imported are what allow customizations to be made to prefixes for various Proton games. without Proton fixes many games would still be broken and/or require manual prefix modification. Huge thanks to Chris.\nAmine is the current maintainer of dxvk-async. This is a feature that was originally removed from dxvk as it happened around the same time a few overwatch bans happened. It was thought, but never confirmed whether or not this feature caused the bans, so the feature was removed as a safety precaution. It is still safe to use in many single player games, and games that do not have competitive anti-cheats. It has also been confirmed to work safely in Warframe and Path of Exile.\nI also of course need to thank my fellow wine-staging maintainers: Alistair Leslie-Hughes, Zebediah Figura and Paul Gofman\nThey have contributed MANY patches to staging, far beyond what I have done, as well as kept up with regular rebasing. A lot of times when bug reports come to me, if it has to do with staging I end up testing and relaying information to these guys in order to get issues resolved.\nAdditionally, a thank you is owed to Andrew Aeikum (aeikum), and kisak (kisak-valve) for regularly keeping me in the loop with Proton and fsync patches, as well as accepting PRs I've made to fix Proton build system issues, or listening to bug reports on early Proton patches before they reach Proton release.\nAnd finally - To all of my patrons that have supported me, thank you so much. It's because of you that I've been able to keep this project going, getting bug fixes reported, getting Proton/WINE issues fixed, getting various hardware and/or game fixes handled, and so on. Thanks to you, I have been able to use the spare budget in order to both help support the other people that make my project possible, as well as get things necessary for testing such as new game releases or specific hardware that hits odd issues. It's had a huge effect not just for this project, but a large trickle down effect.\nMy wine-staging co-maintainers are often able to ask me for testing games, or testing on different hardware if they don't have access to it. This also trickles into both Proton bug reporting AND Lutris bug reporting, as I'm able to provide bug testing and feedback and custom builds and upgrades to them as well. I'm also able to test driver related issues for things such as mesa and getting things reported + patched. This in turn leads to early patches for Mesa, the kernel, VKD3D, and other packages on my copr repos as well.

      "url": "https://www.howtogeek.com/343877/what-is-an-api/",
      "text": "Quick Links\nYou've likely seen the term \"API\" come up. Operating system, web browser, and app updates often announce new APIs for developers. But what is an API and how do developers utilize them?\nWhat Is an Application Programming Interface\nThe term API is an acronym, and it stands for \"Application Programming Interface.\"\nThink of an API like a menu in a restaurant. The menu provides a list of dishes you can order, along with a description of each dish. When you specify what menu items you want, the restaurant's kitchen does the work and provides you with some finished dishes. You don't know exactly how the restaurant prepares that food, and you don't really need to.\nSimilarly, an API lists a bunch of operations that developers can use, along with a description of what they do. The developer doesn't necessarily need to know how, for example, an operating system builds and presents a \"Save As\" dialog box. They just need to know that it's available for use in their app.\nThis isn't a perfect metaphor, as developers may have to provide their own data to the API to get the results, so perhaps it's more like a fancy restaurant where you can provide some of your own ingredients the kitchen will work with.\nBut it's broadly accurate. APIs allow developers to save time by taking advantage of a platform's implementation to do the nitty-gritty work. This helps reduce the amount of code developers need to create, and also helps create more consistency across apps for the same platform. APIs can control access to hardware and software resources.\nAPIs Make Life Easier for Developers\nLet's say you want to develop an app for an iPhone. Apple's iOS operating system provides a large number of APIs---as every other operating system does---to make this easier on you.\nIf you want to embed a web browser to show one or more web pages, for example, you don't have to program your own web browser from scratch just for your application. You use the WKWebView API to embed a WebKit (Safari) browser object in your application.\nIf you want to capture photos or video from the iPhone's camera, you don't have to write your own camera interface. You use the camera API to embed the iPhone's built-in camera in your app. If APIs didn't exist to make this easy, app developers would have to create their own camera software and interpret the camera hardware's inputs. But Apple's operating system developers have done all this hard work so the developers can just use the camera API to embed a camera, and then get on with building their app. And, when Apple improves the camera API, all the apps that rely on it will take advantage of that improvement automatically.\nThis applies to every platform. For example, do you want to create a dialog box on Windows? There's an API for that. Want to support fingerprint authentication on Android? There's an API for that, too, so you don't have to test every different Android manufacturer's fingerprint sensor. Developers don't have to reinvent the wheel over and over.\nAPIs Control Access to Resources\nAPIs are also used to control access to hardware devices and software functions that an application may not necessarily have permission to use. That's why APIs often play a big role in security.\nFor example, if you've ever visited a website and seen a message in your browser that the website is asking to see your precise location, that website is attempting to use the geolocation API in your web browser. Web browsers expose APIs like this to make it easy for web developers to access your location---they can just ask \"where are you?\" and the browser does the hard work of accessing GPS or nearby Wi-Fi networks to find your physical location.\nHowever, browsers also expose this information via an API because it's possible to control access to it. When a website wants access to your exact physical location, the only way they can get it is via the location API. And, when a website tries to use it, you---the user---can choose to allow or deny this request. The only way to access hardware resources like the GPS sensor is through the API, so the browser can control access to the hardware and limit what apps can do.\nThis same principle is used on modern mobile operating systems like iOS and Android, where mobile apps have permissions that can be enforced by controlling access to APIs. For example, if a developer tries to access the camera via the camera API, you can deny the permission request and the app has no way of accessing your device's camera.\nFile systems that use permissions---as they do on Windows, Mac, and Linux---have those permissions enforced by the file system API. A typical application doesn't have direct access to the raw physical hard disk. Instead, the app must access files through an API.\nAPIs Are Used For Communication Between Services\nAPIs are used for all kinds of other reasons, too. For example, if you've ever seen a Google Maps object embedded on a website, that website is using the Google Maps API to embed that map. Google exposes APIs like this to web developers, who can then use the APIs to plop complex objects right on their website. If APIs like this didn't exist, developers might have to create their own maps and provide their own map data just to put a little interactive map on a website.\nAnd, because it's an API, Google can control access to Google Maps on third-party websites, ensuring they use it in a consistent way rather than attempting to messily embed a frame that shows the Google Maps website, for example.\nThis applies to many different online services. There are APIs for requesting text translation from Google Translate, or embedding Facebook comments or tweets from Twitter on a website.\nThe OAuth standard also defines a number of APIs that allow you to sign into a website with another service---for example, to use your Facebook, Google, or Twitter accounts to sign into a new website without creating a new user account just for that site. APIs are standard contracts that define how developers communicate with a service, and the kind of output those developers should expect to receive back.\nIf you've gotten through this, you'll have a better idea of what an API is. Ultimately, you don't really need to know what an API is unless you're a developer. But, if you see a software platform or service has added new APIs for various hardware or services, it should be easier for developers to take advantage of such features."

      "text": "Quick Links\nMost operating systems can be grouped into two different families. Aside from Microsoft's Windows NT-based operating systems, nearly everything else traces its heritage back to Unix.\nLinux, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, Chrome OS, Orbis OS used on the PlayStation 4, whatever firmware is running on your router -- all of these operating systems are often called \"Unix-like\" operating systems.\nUnix's Design Lives On Today\nUnix was developed in AT&T's Bell Labs back in the mid-to-late 1960's. The initial release of Unix had some important design attributes that live on today.\nOne is the \"Unix philosophy\" of creating small, modular utilities that do one thing and do them well. If you're familiar with using a Linux terminal, this should be familiar to you -- the system offers a number of utilities that can be combined in different ways through pipes and other features to perform more complex tasks. Even graphical programs are likely calling simpler utilities in the background to do the heavy lifting. This also makes it easy to create shell scripts, stringing together simple tools to do complicated things.\nUnix also had a single file system that programs use to communicate with each other. This is why \"everything is a file\" on Linux - including hardware devices and special files that provide system information or other data. It's also why only Windows has drive letters, which it inherited from DOS -- on other operating systems, every file on the system is part of a single directory hierarchy.\nTracing the Unix Descendants\nLike any history going back over 40 years, the history of Unix and its descendants is messy. To simplify things, we can roughly group Unix's descendants into two groups.\nOne group of Unix descendants were developed in academia. The first was BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution), an open-source, Unix-like operating system. BSD lives on today through FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD. NeXTStep was also based on the original BSD, Apple's Mac OS X was based on NeXTStep, and iOS was based on Mac OS X. Many other operating systems, including the Orbis OS used on the PlayStation 4, are derived from types of BSD operating systems.\nRichard Stallman's GNU project was also started as a reaction to AT&T's increasingly restrictive Unix software licensing terms. MINIX was a Unix-like operating system created for educational purposes, and Linux was inspired by MINIX. The Linux we know today is really GNU/Linux, as it's made up of the Linux kernel and a lot of GNU utilities. GNU/Linux isn't directly descended from BSD, but it is descended from Unix's design and has its roots in academia. Many operating systems today, including Android, Chrome OS, Steam OS, and a huge amount of embedded operating systems for devices, are based on Linux.\nOn the other hand, there were the commercial Unix operating systems. AT&T UNIX, SCO UnixWare, Sun Microsystems Solaris, HP-UX, IBM AIX, SGI IRIX -- many big corporations wanted to create and license their own versions of Unix. These aren't quite as common today, but some of them are still out there.\nImage Credit: Wikimedia Commons\nThe Rise of DOS and Windows NT\nMany people expected Unix to become the industry standard operating system, but DOS and \"IBM PC compatible\" computers eventually exploded in popularity. Microsoft's DOS became the most successful DOS of them all. DOS was never based on Unix at all, which is why Windows uses a backslash for file paths while everything else uses a forward slash. This decision was made back in the early days of DOS, and later versions of Windows inherited it, just as BSD, Linux, Mac OS X, and other Unix-like operating systems inherited many aspects of Unix's design.\nWindows 3.1, Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows ME were all based on DOS underneath. Microsoft was developing a more modern and stable operating system at the time, which they named Windows NT -- for \"Windows New Technology.\" Windows NT eventually made its way to regular computer users as Windows XP, but it was available for corporations as Windows 2000 and Windows NT before that.\nAll of Microsoft's operating systems are based on the Windows NT kernel today. Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows RT, Windows Phone 8, Windows Server, and the Xbox One's operating system all use the Windows NT kernel. Unlike most other operating systems, Windows NT wasn't developed as a Unix-like operating system.\nMicrosoft didn't start with a completely clean slate, of course. To maintain compatibility with DOS and old Windows software, Windows NT inherited many DOS conventions like drive letters, backslashes for file paths, and forward slashes for command-line switches.\nWhy it Matters\nHave you ever taken a look at the Mac OS X terminal or file system and noticed how similar it was to Linux's, and how different they both were from Windows? Well, this is why -- both Mac OSX and Linux are Unix-like operating systems.\nKnowing this bit of history helps you understand what a \"Unix-like\" operating system is, and why so many operating systems seem so similar to each other while Windows seems so different. This explains why the terminal on Mac OS X will feel so familiar to a Linux geek, while the Command Prompt and PowerShell on Windows are so different from other command-line environments.\nThis was just a quick history that will help you understand how we got to where we are today without getting bogged down in the details. If you want more information, you can find entire books on the history of Unix.\nImage Credit: Peter Hamer on Flickr, Takuya Oikawa on Flickr, CJ Sorg on Flickr"

      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\nUsing Vulkan can result in a noticeably higher frame rate for many games, but DirectX 12 tends to provide a more stable experience. You should test both and choose the one that works best for the game you want to play.\nMore PC games than ever allow players to choose between DirectX 12 and Vulkan. But it isn't always obvious what the difference is, nor which one will provide the best gaming experience. The answers aren't completely straightforward, but we'll tell you what you need to know.\nWhat Are Vulkan and DirectX?\nVulkan and DirectX are APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and offer two different solutions to the same problem: ensuring software, such as a videogame, can communicate with your PC hardware, and vice versa, in the most efficient way.\nVulkan is a dedicated graphics API, whereas DirectX is a collection of APIs that includes a graphics API (Direct3D.) They both feature standardized tools, making it much easier to develop software that will work with the wide variety of graphics cards and other hardware inside our computers. Without standardization of this type, software developers would be required to provide individual drivers for every possible GPU and hardware configuration.\nDirectX was developed by Microsoft and was originally called the Windows Games SDK (Software Development Kit) when released in 1995. It has been included in the OS since that time. The first game to use DirectX was iD Software's Doom 95, published in 1996.\nVulkan was developed by the Khronos Group, a consortium of more than 150 companies responsible for OpenGL, WebGL, Anari, and several other APIs. It was originally based on an API called Mantle, developed and then abandoned by AMD. Vulkan is considered to be the successor to OpenGL, a graphics API that has been around since 1992.\nIs Vulkan Faster Than DirectX?\nVulkan is a low-overhead API and can require fewer system resources, such as CPU computation, memory, and bandwidth, than DirectX. This makes it a potentially better option than DirectX 12 on lower-spec computers. Or at least, computers with a less capable CPU.\nMost benchmark tests put Vulkan ahead slightly on frame rates, but with more frequent FPS fluctuations. As you can see in the Red-Dead Redemption 2 comparison video below, the frame rate for DX 12 is a bit lower but marginally more stable.\nVisually, you should see little difference between a game running on Vulkan and DirectX 12. If identical in-game graphics settings are applied, a game like Red Dead Redemption 2 will look the same using Vulkan as it does with DirectX.\nVulkan Does Have an Advantage in Compatibility\nThe main difference between Vulkan and DirectX is in the area of cross-platform compatibility. DirectX has been developed for Windows and Windows only. That means a game developed for the Microsoft operating system has to be ported to a different API before it can be released for game consoles, for example.\nVulkan is a cross-platform API, compatible with Linux, Android, Nintendo, MacOS, and many other operating systems. This makes it quicker and easier for developers to make a game for multiple platforms, without having to completely rewrite it for each one.\nIn the long term, this could be a winning factor for Vulkan. As gaming continues to move away from the more traditional PCs or consoles to include mobile and cloud-based gaming, focusing on Vulkan could become much more appealing to developers.\nVulkan vs. DX 12: Which is Best?\nMany modern games and applications can use either DirectX 12 or Vulkan. You will be offered the choice between them before the software is loaded. Which one is best relies on several factors, including your PC hardware, the type of game, and whether you give more weight to visual effects or a high frame rate.\nIt also depends on how well the game developer understands and has implemented each API. DirectX 12 is more difficult to develop games for, but the API has been around longer than Vulkan and might be more familiar to the devs.\nOn paper, DirectX 12 (and DX 12 Ultimate) seems the better API for CPU and GPU-intensive games. And if your computer can run a game smoothly in DX 12, there is no reason not to use it. But it always makes sense to test your games using different APIs if given the option. You might find that Vulkan works better for some, while DirectX is better for others.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat is a Graphics API?\nAn API (Application Programming Interface) is software that allows two programs to efficiently communicate. Graphics APIs are used to allow software such as games or 3D rendering tools to fully access the capabilities of the GPU.\nWhat Is Vulkan 1.3?\nVulkan 1.3 is, at the time of writing, the latest stable version of the API. It was released in January 2022 and arrived with several improvements over version 1.2, including support for Raytracing.\nIs Vulkan for AMD or NVIDIA?\nVulkan can be used with both AMD or NVIDIA graphics cards. However, it was derived from an older AMD API called Mantle, so it isn't uncommon for Vulkan to work a bit better with AMD GPUs than with NVIDIA cards.\nShould I use Vulkan or DX12 in RDR2?\nRed Dead Redemption 2 works well with DX12, but Vulkan has been shown to provide a better gunslinging experience. Depending on the hardware you are using, Vulkan can improve FPS rates by 10% or more with no loss of visual quality."

      "text": "Quick Links\nAMD FSR has the potential to breathe new life into aging graphics cards, and make the balance between game performance and visual quality easier to achieve. But what exactly is FSR, and how does it work?\nWhat Is FSR?\nFSR, which stands for FidelityFX Super Resolution, is one of the latest additions to AMD's FidelityFX image toolkit. It is an upscaling technology, designed to improve the performance of games without loss of image quality and graphical detail.\nPlaying a game in high resolution such as 4K will often result in a noticeable frame rate drop, even if using a decent graphics card. This is especially true if the game uses demanding effects like Ray Tracing. FSR can reduce the input resolution to as low as 1080p and then upscale the output to appear close to 4K. You get the performance of the lower resolution but with the visual detail of a much higher resolution.\nIt works by lowering the render quality of a game and then analyzing the image, detecting edges, and reconstructing them at the higher target resolution using a spatial upscaling algorithm. A sharpening process is also performed to smooth out details further. All of this is done in a single pass during the rendering process, with GUI elements and text added to the frame afterward.\nFSR is similar to NVIDIA's DLSS or Deep Learning Super-Sampling. Although they are not strictly comparable, the same end result is achieved: a higher resolution image for a lower performance cost. One important difference is that FSR is open source, and potentially available on any graphics card. Whereas DLSS is dependent on using an NVIDIA GPU.\nWhich FSR Scaling Mode Should I Use?\nFSR has four different quality modes to choose from. Performance mode applies the most scaling at 2x the input resolution, and Ultra Quality mode the least at 1.3x the input. The four modes and their scaling levels are:\n- Performance Mode = 2x scaling\n- Balanced Mode = 1.7x scaling\n- Quality Mode = 1.5x scaling\n- Ultra Quality Mode = 1.3x scaling\nSo for example, to achieve close to 4K using Quality mode, the graphics card only needs to render 2650x1440 pixels rather than 3840x2160. FSR then scales up the image by 1.5x.\nUpscaling, even the intelligent spatial upscaling that FSR uses, isn't a perfect process. The more scaling applied to a frame, the more likely graphical errors will occur on screen. AMD itself states that \"Performance mode visibly impacts image quality and should only be selected in situations where the need for the ultimate in performance is critical.\"\nThis is an issue that AMD has at least partially addressed with the release of FSR 2.0.\nWhat Is FSR 2.0 and How Is It Different?\nThe first version of FidelityFX Super Resolution was released in mid-2021, supported by several high-profile games, including Cyberpunk 2077 and Godfall. FSR 2.0 was released in May 2022, not as a replacement for 1.0, but in addition to it. That means game developers can offer users a choice between the two, potentially making FSR available for a wider range of hardware.\nThe main difference between version 1.0 and 2.0 is the switch from spatial upscaling to temporal upscaling. Spatial upscaling uses data from the current frame to upscale the frame itself. Temporal upscaling can use data from both the current frame and previous frames, resulting in improved image quality and fewer unexpected visual artifacts.\nFSR 2.0 also allows game developers to tweak the different scaling modes. This means that games that use 2.0 might have only three modes available, or include Ultra Performance mode rather than Ultra Quality mode.\nOne of the downsides to this improved upscaling quality is that FSR 2.0 is more demanding on the graphics card. Because of this, the number of graphics cards AMD recommends using to achieve some resolutions, particularly 4K, has shrunk.\nHow Do I Use FSR?\nIf the game and your graphics card support FSR, there is usually little you need to do beyond choosing between the four FSR modes. If your card and the game supports multiple scaling technologies, you may have to select FSR before setting the mode.\nThe FSR modes can be found in the graphics settings for each game that supports it, usually in the resolution section but sometimes in a separate upscaling section. Exactly how well the different modes work will depend on several factors, including the graphics card you are using and the game being played.\nYou may need to update your graphics drivers to the latest version before you can apply FSR to your game. If the setting is still unavailable after updating, it means that your card is not capable of using it.\nGames That Support AMD FSR\nThere are over 110 games that support FSR at the time of writing, with more being added all the time. Support for FSR 2.0 is still fairly restricted, but the list is sure to expand quickly, either through patches for existing games or as new games are released.\nFidelityFX Super Resolution was made available to developers of PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S games in mid-2021. Few games currently support it, Arcademageddon being one, but you can expect more to come.\nHere are just some of the games that support one or more of the FSR versions:\n- Anno 1800\n- Arcademageddon\n- Assassin's Creed Valhalla\n- Black Desert\n- Deathloop\n- Call of Duty: Vanguard\n- Cyberpunk 2077\n- Century: Age of Ashes\n- DEATH STRANDING DIRECTOR'S CUT\n- Dota 2\n- Dying Light 2 Stay Human\n- Far Cry 6\n- God of War\n- GODFALL\n- Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice\n- Horizon Zero Dawn\n- ICARUS\n- KEO\n- No Man's Sky\n- Resident Evil 7\n- Resident Evil Village\n- SCUM\n- Sniper Elite 5\n- Terminator: Resistance\n- The Riftbreaker\n- World War Z: Aftermath\n- Resident Evil 2\n- Resident Evil 3\n- Tiny Tina's Wonderland\n- V Rising\n- War Mongrels\n- World of Warcraft: Shadowlands\nYou can find a full list of FSR-enabled games on the AMD website. If your favorite game isn't listed, you can even tell AMD which games you'd like to see added."

      "text": "Summary\n- Linux is usually free to use and designed by teams of enthusiasts rather than a profit-driven corporation.\n- Linux varies in flavors (distros) like Windows upgrades, offering a lot of versatility.\n- Linux offers no dedicated customer support and will require some effort to troubleshoot.\nIf you\u2019re thinking about switching to Linux\u2014or even just thinking about getting away from Windows\u2014you may have wondered what actually are the main differences between the two operating systems (OSes). To make it simple, here are the differences I think are most important.\nLinux Distros Typically Aren't for Profit\nProbably the biggest difference between the two OSes is the underlying philosophy: Windows is a product made by the Microsoft corporation, and it\u2019s sold for money. When you buy a new laptop, part of the purchase price is a fee being paid to Microsoft that allows you to use Windows. As such, the decisions that shape Windows often will have a profit motive in mind, which may clash with your needs as a user.\nLinux, in contrast, is in almost all cases a free product. Though there are some exceptions, especially when it comes to enterprise applications, as a regular consumer you\u2019ll likely never have to pay to use Linux. This is true even if your distribution of choice was made by a large company. For example, the extremely popular Ubuntu distro is put together by Canonical, a profit-based corporation, yet is offered for free.\nWithout the profit motive, Linux designers can make choices that are in the interest of users, without having to worry about sales funnels or advertising space. Microsoft needs to sell subscriptions and ads to operate, and it designs Windows as a means to do that.\nThere's No One \"Linux\"\nYou may have noticed another key point to realize about Linux, namely that there isn\u2019t one monolithic OS. Unlike Windows, which has iterations that are, on paper at least, direct upgrades to the ones preceding it, the Linux ecosystem is a great deal more anarchic. This is due to Linux being by and large open source: anybody can view the code, copy it, and add or remove things as they see fit.\nAs a result, Linux has a lot of different flavors, called distribution or distro, with each bringing its own take to the concept of an OS. So you can have a distribution like Ubuntu, which has a bit of a Mac-like feel and uses Canonical\u2019s software center to keep up and running. If you want a more Windows-like feel, you can check out Linux Mint, which takes what\u2019s good about Windows and gets rid of the rest.\nOf course, there\u2019s more to Linux distros than just having a Mac or Windows feel. You have distros like Arch Linux, which don\u2019t have any graphical interface, unless you specifically want one. You also have super-specific ones like Tails, which is built for anonymity and wipes itself after each use. No matter how niche an application, chances are there\u2019s a Linux distro catering to it.\nLinux Has No Dedicated Customer Support\nSo far, you may think that we\u2019re nothing but Linux fanboys here at How-to Geek, and while that\u2019s certainly true, that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re blind to its faults. One massive issue when comparing Windows to Linux is that when you have an issue with a Microsoft product, you can refer to the documentation or even reach out to a support agent to fix it. It\u2019s great, especially if you\u2019re not too savvy with computers.\nLinux forces you to know how computers work, because there\u2019s no dedicated customer support, and you'll be relying a spread of online documentation and websites instead of just one. This means that if you\u2019re having issues, you are going to have to figure stuff out on your own using what documentation you can find plus the people you can meet through the Linux community.\nWhile the Linux community as a whole is very friendly and helpful, there\u2019s no guarantee you'll find someone able to help with your specific problem. Many of the issues I\u2019ve faced using Linux I\u2019ve ended up fixing by taking some well-meant advice, some of my own know-how, and just trying stuff till it worked. Not very elegant nor efficient, and there were times where I wished I could have plugged and played, Windows style.\nNot Everything Will Work On Linux\nAnother issue to keep in mind is that a lot of software is tailored toward Windows, and may not work on Linux. While a lot of software will have Linux versions (and more is being added daily), some things just will not work. The Adobe suite of products is a good example, as are many games.\nGenerally you can get around these issues by using emulator software, but you will still have issues from time to time. A good example is Steam\u2019s Proton compatibility layer, which lets you play Windows games on Linux. In my experience, it works pretty well most of the time, but there have still been some games that were unplayable for one reason or another.\nFor me, this hasn\u2019t been a dealbreaker, but if you\u2019re dependent on specific software or a heavy gamer, it\u2019s something to keep in mind when considering switching to Linux.\nLinux Gives You Freedom to Do What You Want With Your PC\nFor me, the upshot is that Linux gives you a lot of freedom to do what you want with your PC, your only limits are your patience and the distros you use. Want to give an old laptop a new lease of life? Use a resource-light distro to keep it running. Want to use it for video editing? There\u2019s a distro for that, too.\nThe downside to Linux is that this freedom comes at the price of convenience. Not everything will work, and you will lose time figuring out how certain things work. For me it\u2019s worth it as I\u2019m not giving my money to a large corporation, and tinkering with stuff until I know how it works is something I enjoy. If you think that sounds pretty good, I recommend you try switching to Linux and seeing how you like it."

      "text": "Quick Links\nRemember the days when gaming on Linux was hard to imagine? Thanks to the Proton compatibility layer and firms focusing on Linux, gaming on Linux has gotten much better over the past few years. But what exactly is Proton, and why is it important for Linux gaming?\nWhat Is Proton Compatibility Layer?\nTo understand what Proton is, first, we need to understand two technologies---DirectX and Vulkan. Think of them as driver applications for gaming. They're Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that help your computer communicate with graphics cards.\nWhile DirectX is a Microsoft-developed and Windows-specific closed source API, Linux uses the open-source Vulkan API. There are many other APIs like OpenGL, but let's focus on Vulkan and DirectX only.\nAs DirectX is a Windows-only API and as Windows is one of the most popular operating systems globally, game developers focus on optimizing their games on DirectX. Since Windows games can't be played on Linux, here's where Proton steps in.\nIn simple terms, the Valve-made Proton is a Wine fork that uses libraries like DXVK (DirectX over Vulkan) to translate DirectX games to Vulkan. Think of it this way. Games talk to your graphics card using DirectX. DirectX gathers resources and allocates them to games. DirectX contains Direct3D (which is responsible for rendering 3D graphics in apps). Proton converts these Direct3D calls to Vulkan-understandable calls using the libraries.\nThe end result is a Windows-only game running on a Linux PC.\nWhat Can You Play with Proton?\nWhen Proton was launched in 2018, it could play only 27 games. However, in three years, the list of supported games has grown to about 16,000.\nProton is limited, however, in that it can't play games with built-in anti-cheat mechanisms. As the name suggests, anti-cheat mechanisms in games prevent players from cheating. With the rise of cheaters, gaming firms have partnered with anti-cheat mechanism providers to improve the gaming experience. Some of the popular anti-cheat providers are BattlEye and Easy by Epic Games.\nTo find out what games are currently supported, head over to the official ProtonDB website. As of this writing, over 77% of the top 1,000 games are playable using Proton, in which over 21% run Natively (don't require Proton), 21% are rated Platinum (run out of the box), 56% Gold (run after tweaks), 66% Silver (run with minor issues and tweaks), and 71% Bronze (run but crash frequently).\nHow to Use Proton\nTo enable Proton, head over to Steam Settings > Steam Play > Enable Steam Play.\nIf you're looking for a detailed guide on running Windows games on Linux using Proton, we have you covered.\nThe Future of Linux Gaming with Proton\nThere's no denying that Desktop Linux has gotten better over the past decade. However, one area where GNU/Linux was severely lacking was gaming---until Proton showed up.\nProton holds the key to revolutionizing Linux gaming to the point where Linux could compete with Windows. One development that could also help boost gaming on Linux is the\nSteam Deck, which was announced in July of 2021.\nFor starters, Steam Deck is a handheld gaming console from Valve that runs Arch Linux (SteamOS with KDE Plasma, to be precise) and uses Proton to run Windows games. What's exciting is that Valve knows that games with anti-cheat features won't work on the console. As a result, it's working with the developers of Easy and BattlEye to make it possible to run Windows games that use the same anti-cheat mechanisms.\nThe fact that Linux is open-source means that if Valve manages to get Easy's and BattlEye's support on SteamOS, the same could potentially be ported to other Linux distros. That would eventually strengthen the desktop Linux gaming experience overall.\nIt's too early to predict exactly how things will change, but for now, the future of Linux gaming looks bright."
