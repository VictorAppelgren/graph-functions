  "title": "Circle stock jumps after first-ever public earnings",
  "description": "USDC\u2019s record circulation helped boost returns from U.S. Treasuries, sending CRCL shares up 7%.",
  "content": "Stablecoin issuer Circle Internet Group is seeing its stock (NYSE: CRCL) rise yet again. Shares in the company are up more than 7% in early morning as of the time of this writing. At one point, shares were up as much as 10% after markets opened.\n\nThe reason? Circle just posted its first quarterly earnings as a public company, and investors seem to like what they are seeing. Here\u2019s what you need to know. Circle posts its first quarterly results as a public company Today, Circle announced its Q2 2025 financial results\u2014the first quarterly results the company has posted as a publicly traded business. The big number most investors seem to care about from Circle\u2019s Q2 earnings is its revenue. The company said that for the quarter, its total revenue grew to $658 million. That\u2019s a 53% increase year over year.\n\nIt also said that the circulation of its stablecoin, USDC, grew 90% year over year to reach a total of $61.3 billion at the quarter\u2019s end. The more the circulation of Circle\u2019s USDC stablecoin grows, the more Circle stands to make. That\u2019s because Circle makes the majority of its revenues not from cryptocurrencies themselves, but from U.S. Treasuries. \u201cCircle, much like a bank, knows that only a fraction of all the USDC in circulation will be redeemed at any one time, so it only needs to keep a portion of reserves in cash to be instantaneously redeemable by USDC holders,\u201d Mitrade points out. \u201cIt invests the rest in short-term U.S. Treasuries.\u201d\n\nThis means that as the circulation of USDC grows, Circle stands to make more income from its investments in short-term U.S. Treasuries, thereby increasing its revenue. Yet despite the 53% revenue growth Circle announced, the company still posted a net loss of $482 million. That net loss was mainly attributed to IPO-related noncash charges, including stock-based compensation payouts. Despite charges related to its IPO significantly contributing to the company\u2019s Q2 net loss, Circle\u2019s public offering has been very good to investors.\n\nSince Circle went public in June, its stock surged. By the end of June, CRCL stock had risen 750%. Circle, like many crypto companies, has been greatly helped by a more friendly crypto regulatory environment under the Trump Administration. Those policies are why more cryptocurrency companies seem more interested in pursuing IPOs, including trading platform eToro, which did so in May, and cryptocurrency exchange Bullish, which is having its IPO tomorrow. Over the past month, however, CRCL stock has lost about 7.65% of its value. As of the time of this writing, with today\u2019s post-earnings boost, CRCL shares are hovering around $168.16.",

      "text": "Stablecoins offer many of the benefits of crypto without the drastic price swings, making them strong candidates for broader financial adoption.\nCircle's USDC is the second most popular stablecoin on the market.\nCircle's revenue is highly dependent on factors completely outside of its control.\nSince its initial public offering (IPO) last month, Circle Internet Group (NYSE: CRCL) stock has skyrocketed 140% as excitement builds around the possibility that stablecoins could see widespread adoption across traditional finance. Considering the company issues USDC (CRYPTO: USDC), one of the most popular stablecoins around, many investors believe Circle's stock is just getting started. So, could Circle Internet be a millionaire maker?\nStablecoins are a class of cryptocurrencies designed to hold their value relative to a traditional \"fiat\" currency -- often the U.S. dollar. Where coins like Bitcoin and Dogecoin are subject to dramatic swings in price, stablecoins are intended to never deviate more than a small fraction of a percent from the currency they are \"pegged\" to.\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue \u00bb\nThough other crypto ventures have tried more complicated mechanisms, Circle maintains USDC's peg to the U.S. dollar by simply holding $1 in cash or short-term Treasury papers for every USDC it issues. Any USDC in circulation is redeemable at any time for $1 in cash.\nSo what is the point? USDC and other stablecoins provide many of the benefits of certain cryptocurrencies -- transactions are fast, cheap, and nearly frictionless -- without the fear of wild price swings. Like cash, they're intended to be used, not hoarded.\nDespite the shiny technology exterior, Circle's revenue stream is simple. The company makes money through holding U.S. Treasuries. Circle, much like a bank, knows that only a fraction of all the USDC in circulation will be redeemed at any one time, so it only needs to keep a portion of reserves in cash to be instantaneously redeemable by USDC holders. It invests the rest in short-term U.S. Treasuries. That's still a relatively liquid asset, but one that earns Circle interest income.\nThis is functionally the entirety of Circle's revenue source; of the $1.68 billion revenues the company collected in 2024, $1.66 billion was from reserve interest. So, to be clear, Circle's revenue is directly tied to two main factors: how many USDC are in circulation (and therefore the size of the reserves from which it is earning interest) and U.S. Treasury rates.\nThere are currently 62.8 billion USDC in circulation. The company believes that it will grow significantly as adoption progresses throughout the wider economy.\nThere's ample reason to believe that is true. The GENIUS Act, a landmark bill that creates a regulatory framework for stablecoins and allows for their use in the banking industry, is working its way through Congress. Though some of the finer details may change, it's more than likely it will be signed into law this year as it's one of the few pieces of legislation today that has robust bipartisan support.\nAn analysis from Citi lays out a bear, base, and bull case for the stablecoin market through 2030. Its base case sees roughly $1.6 trillion stablecoins in circulation five years from now, up from today's 234 billion. There is clearly a massive potential here.\nIt's also likely that USDC captures a significant portion of this total market. It's currently second only to Tether, but its rival wouldn't qualify under the GENIUS Act -- its reserve practices are somewhat opaque, and it uses volatile assets like Bitcoin as collateral. That puts USDC in a prime position.\nThere are some key things to consider that complicate the issue, however. First, I think USDC could face significant competition not from Tether or other \"crypto native\" issuers, but from legacy institutions. It's been reported that some of the largest banks, like JP Morgan Chase and Bank of America, have been in talks to create their own stablecoins. This would undermine the core of USDC's growth thesis. Circle and USDC could even face an official U.S. dollar central bank digital currency (CBDC) issued by the Federal Reserve itself.\nHere's another thing to consider. Circle's revenue is directly tied to yields from U.S. Treasuries, which in turn are tied to the interest rate set by the Federal Reserve. We are in an environment of relatively high interest rates, at least in the context of recent history.\nIf rates are cut, which they likely will be later this year, Circle's income will take a hit. According to an analysis by Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at the firm Fundstrat, every 0.25% drop in the Fed's rate will equal a 10% drop in Circle's revenue. That's pretty significant.\nWhile I think stablecoin adoption will grow, I think investors are getting ahead of themselves. Right now, the stock is overvalued. I think that there are too many long-term risks and not enough of a moat to call Circle a millionaire-maker.\nBefore you buy stock in Circle Internet Group, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Circle Internet Group wasn\u2019t one of them.
