  "title": "Hypocritical Dems are flouting laws and blaming Trump \u2013 they are missing an important point in the process",
  "description": "It\u2019s no small crime, and those Trump critics who pretend it is trivial and commonplace have short memories and low ethics.",
  "content": "For all his Trump-deranged bravado, Democrat Senator Adam Schiff, the notorious Russia-hoaxer, looked like a frightened rabbit caught in the spotlight Sunday morning when he appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d to deny the mortgage fraud scandal that has embroiled him.\n\nHe should be nervous.\n\nA grand jury in Maryland is weighing criminal indictments for Schiff over alleged mortgage fraud, mail fraud, bank fraud and false statements to financial institutions that were uncovered by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, claiming he certified both a Maryland property and a California condominium as his primary residence for tax and mortgage purposes.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, and at least two other unnamed people are facing similar allegations, which carry potential jail terms up to 30 years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s patently false and the president knows it,\u201d blustered Schiff, claiming FHFA head Bill Pulte was \u201cessentially doing the president\u2019s bidding against me, against Letitia James [and] against this person on the Federal Reserve.\n\n\u201cMortgage is their new weapon to go after their critics.\u201d\n\nHowever, Schiff\u2019s attempts to dismiss the allegations against him as \u201cretribution\u201d or part of a campaign of \u201clawfare\u201d by an \u201cauthoritarian\u201d president are not only hilariously hypocritical but miss an important point.\n\nMortgage fraud is a serious matter that affects us all.\n\nBanks offer significantly better rates and require smaller down payments for primary residences because they deem them lower risk than investment properties since homeowners are less likely to default on the home they live in.\n\nIf enough people falsely claim investment properties as their primary residence, lenders inadvertently carry higher risks that could see the collapse of the entire financial system, as happened in the 2008 global financial crisis, when widespread fraud and inadequate regulation led to a wave of defaults.\n\nEvery week, Post columnist Miranda Devine sits down for exclusive and candid conversations with the most influential disruptors in Washington. Subscribe here!\n\nIt\u2019s no small crime, and those Trump critics who pretend it is trivial and commonplace have short memories and low ethics.\n\nPulte, a Trump appointee with deep expertise in housing finance, is quite properly focused on cleaning up the industry.\n\n\u201cMortgage fraud is a serious crime,\u201d Pulte told me, promising it will \u201cbe nearly eliminated after we\u2019re done.\u201d\n\nHis crusade to root out fraud, waste and unethical conduct in the housing finance system is to ensure the stability of the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which guarantee about half the country\u2019s residential mortgages.\n\nPulte notes that the mortgage fraud case he referred to the DOJ against Lisa Cook is especially significant because \u201cthe very person entrusted with setting interest rates should never manipulate them for personal gain.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s significant in another way too, because it plays into Trump\u2019s power struggle with Jerome Powell.\n\nThe independent Federal Reserve chairman has stubbornly refused to cut interest rates, citing inflation concerns, earning the wrath of President Trump, who points out that the Fed was happy enough to adjust rates to Joe Biden\u2019s political benefit, including by a half percentage point seven weeks before the 2024 election.\n\nIf Cook, whose term is not up until 2038, is forced to resign over the mortgage fraud allegations, Trump will be able to appoint a governor of his choice to replace her, thus flipping the balance of the Fed in his favor, 4-3, and putting the heat on Powell. (Another Biden appointee, Adriana Kugler, resigned unexpectedly this month.)\n\nCook, like Schiff and James, denies Pulte\u2019s allegations that she falsified documents to claim two properties \u2014 a house in Ann Arbor, Mich., and a condo in Atlanta \u2014 both as her primary residence, giving her more favorable mortgage terms.\n\nShe mentions the purchases predate her 2022 appointment to the Fed\u2019s seven-member Board, one of four diversity appointments made by Biden as part of his peculiar obsession with identity politics above all.\n\nThe investigation is understood to include questions over whether she misrepresented her mortgage situation to the board when she was being vetted.\n\nAfter Pulte tweeted a copy of his criminal referral letter about Cook to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Special Attorney Ed Martin last week, Trump took the opportunity on Truth Social to demand that she \u201cresign now!!!\u201d\n\nPulte responded on X that \u201cthe President has great cause to fire Lisa Cook\u201d and alleged that Powell might \u201cbe complicit with Cook\u2019s alleged fraud.\u201d\n\nIn an extraordinary puff piece over the weekend, The New York Times framed the allegations against Cook as a racist anti-DEI purge against the first black female Fed governor, decrying \u201cattacks [that] focused on her property ownership given that Black Americans were nearly 40 percent less likely than white Americans to own homes.\u201d\n\nThe Times also referred to Cook\u2019s \u201cbest-known academic paper [that] showed how lynchings and other violence against Black Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries reduced the number of patents they filed.\u201d\n\nCook is either guilty or innocent of mortgage fraud, and the color of her skin is irrelevant, just as Schiff and James\u2019s guilt or innocence has nothing to do with how much they hate Trump.\n\nBut the fact is that if high-profile Democrats have been dumb enough or crooked enough or arrogant enough to flout the law, they can hardly expect to find mercy from Trump who, after all, suffered through 91 felony indictments from three Democrat prosecutors, aimed at throwing him in jail and off the ballot, not to mention James\u2019 $500 million civil suit aimed at destroying his company, an absurd penalty which a New York appeals court threw out last week.\n\nThat was just in five months in 2023, during his second presidential campaign, and came on top of a relentless campaign of lies and character assassination, including Russiagate and two impeachments, that crippled his first presidency.\n\nJust to remind us of those travails, Sunday was the second anniversary of Trump\u2019s famously defiant mug shot, when he had to surrender at Fulton County Jail in a Georgia election interference case led by Democrat district attorney Fani Willis \u2014 who incidentally ended up being thrown off the case in her own sordid scandal.\n\nTrump has framed the mug shot from the cover of the New York Post and it sits in pride of place at the entrance to the Oval Office, for all to see and marvel at his endurance.\n\nIf they\u2019ve done nothing wrong, they will be exonerated.\n\nBut, as they like to say: \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d\n\nIt never gets old.",

  "summary": "Democrat Senator Adam Schiff is under scrutiny for alleged mortgage fraud, mail fraud, bank fraud, and false statements to financial institutions uncovered by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). Similar allegations have been levelled at New York Attorney General Letitia James, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, and at least two unnamed individuals. Despite Schiff's attempts to dismiss these allegations as \u201cretribution\u201d or part of a campaign of \u201clawfare\u201d by an \u201cauthoritarian\u201d president, they miss an important point. Mortgage fraud affects all of us, as banks offer significantly better rates and require smaller down payments for primary residences as they are lower risk than investment properties. If enough people falsely claim investment properties as their primary residence, this could lead to a collapse of the entire financial system.",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.

Lisa Cook that he will fire her if she does not resign following allegations that she committed mortgage fraud.\nThe commander-in-chief\u2019s latest broadside against America\u2019s central bank comes after a string of attacks from administration officials over the Fed\u2019s failure to slash interest rates and a controversial $2.5 billion revamp of its downtown DC HQ.\n\u201cWhat she did was bad. So I\u2019ll fire her if she doesn\u2019t resign,\u201d Trump told reporters on Friday.\nTrump\u2019s threat came after Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte accused Cook in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi of falsifying bank documents and property records to secure better loan terms, potentially amounting to mortgage fraud.\nThe staunch Trump ally raised the allegations in a tweet on X on Wednesday that Cook had designated a condo in Atlanta as her primary residence after taking a loan on her home in Michigan, which she also declared as a primary residence.\nPulte told The Post on Friday that he is also investigating a residence that Cook has in Massachusetts.\n\u201cI am probing a third property and we will see what\u2019s there,\u201d he said.\nBloomberg reported on Thursday that the Department of Justice was set to open an investigation into the matter.\nPulte said in an interview with Fox Business Network on Thursday that he believes the president has \u201cample cause\u201d to fire Cook.\nFederal Reserve Board of Governors members can be removed only \u201cfor cause,\u201d meaning some form of wrongdoing.\nTrump had previously called for Cook\u2019s resignation on Wednesday, saying she \u201cmust resign, now!\u201d\nA Federal Reserve spokesman declined to comment.\n\u201cI have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,\u201d Cook said on Wednesday\nHer federally filed financial disclosure documents show three mortgages taken out in 2021, including a 15-year 2.5% loan on an investment property and two loans for personal residences, including a 30-year 3.25% mortgage and a 15-year 2.875% mortgage.\nThe weekly average rate for 30-year loans during 2021 ranged between 2.9% and 3.3%, Mortgage Bankers Association data shows.\nCook\u2019s possible removal would create a third vacancy on the Fed board for a Trump appointee.\nIn the coming months, Trump is set to nominate a new Fed chair and another governor, both with permanent votes on the 12-member rate-setting committee.\nTrump appointees Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller already sit on the board.\nAdriana Couglar unexpectedly stepped down as a Fed board member three weeks ago to be replaced by Stephen Miran, an economic adviser to the president."

      "text": "Trump weaponization czar teases \u2018more\u2019 developments with Schiff, warns J6 Committee alums to \u2018keep an eye on their mailbox\u2019\nPresident Trump\u2019s weaponization czar Ed Martin dropped hints that his team may soon take additional investigative actions against Sen. Adam Schiff and members of the since-defunct House Select Jan. 6 Committee who weren\u2019t pardoned by former president Joe Biden.\nMartin, who helms the Justice Department\u2019s Weaponization Working Group, took note of the criminal probe of Schiff (D-Calif.) over allegations of mortgage fraud and strongly implied something else is in the works.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a referral from Bill Pulte about mortgage fraud about Adam Schiff. That\u2019s publicly discussed. His own lawyers have been out there,\u201d Martin told Fox News\u2019 Sunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\u201cNow there\u2019s more on Adam Schiff.\u201d\nMartin did not specify what else could be coming down the pike.\nBack in May, Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director William Pulte referred Schiff to the Justice Department for \u201cmultiple instances\u201d between 2003 and 2019 when the senator allegedly \u201cfalsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms.\u201d\nThis includes accusations that he listed his Maryland home as a primary residence in multiple mortgage refinancing filings despite being an elected member of Congress from California at the time.\nSome lawmakers have homes in both their states and in the Washington, DC, Maryland and Virginia area during their time in Congress. But Pulte alleged that Schiff also sought a similar exemption on a Burbank, Calif., condo that he also dubbed his primary residence.\nIn a separate matter, Schiff recently faced surfaced accusations from a former Democratic House Intelligence Committee aide who alleged the then-congressman approved leaks of classified information to harm President Trump during the height of Russiagate.\nIt is unclear if those allegations are what Martin was referencing. DOJ officials concluded Schiff may have had liability protections for those leaks under the speech and debate clause of the Constitution, according to an FBI memo on the accusations obtained by The Post.\n\u201cAll we\u2019re going to do, again, is get to the facts of this and use all the tools that we have in our system,\u201d Martin stressed.\nLast week, Martin was seen in Brooklyn checking out New York Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 multi-family residential property that is subject to a mortgage fraud inquiry.\nPulte alleged that the AG may have \u201cfalsified bank documents and property records to acquire government-backed assistance and loans and more favorable loan terms.\u201d\nSimilar to the Schiff accusations, Pulte alleged that James declared a Norfolk, Virginia, property purchased in 2023 her \u201cprincipal residence\u201d while calling her Brooklyn brownstone she\u2019s owned since 2001 her second residence.\nBeyond Schiff and James, Martin also teased that he is reviewing members of the since-defunct House Select Jan. 6 Committee, despite Biden\u2019s sweeping 11th-hour pardon for the panel.\n\u201cWe\u2019re all in that too,\u201d Martin said. \u201cA lot of people did not get a pardon that were involved in the select committee, and they ought to be keeping an eye on their mailbox, because there\u2019s a lot to be asked about.\u201d\nMartin didn\u2019t specify names, but noted that US Attorney General Pam Bondi \u201clet us loose on\u201d issues of alleged government weaponization."

      "text": "Miranda Devine: Childish Rhode Island prosecutor is latest example of entitled Dems thinking they are above the law\nDemocrats love saying, \u201cNo one is above the law.\u201d\nBut that is psychological projection, because we keep seeing entitled Democrats behaving as if they are above the law, pulling rank on cops and generally behaving like entitled brats who think the rules apply to everyone except their precious selves.\nExhibit A this week is Rhode Island Assistant Attorney General Devon Flanagan Hogan, whose drunken antics while resisting arrest outside the upscale Clarke Cooke House in Newport are the latest example of a new genre of viral content: brats resisting arrest.\nPolice bodycam videos go viral because we all love seeing these people get their comeuppance.\nThe incident unfolded around 9:51 p.m. last Thursday, Aug. 14, when Flanagan, 34, her friend from college Veronica Hannan, who\u2019s a senior manager at PepsiCo, and Veronica\u2019s poor husband, financial adviser Dan Hannan, were asked to leave Clarke Cooke House for reasons unknown. Judging by the belligerence of the women, it\u2019s not hard to guess why.\nThe bodycam begins as police arrive to find the women out in front of the restaurant. Flanagan, wearing a short red jumpsuit, is wagging her finger and demanding that the officer stop the bodycam: \u201cProtocol is you turn it off if a citizen requests you turn it off.\u201d\nThe cop tries to be reasonable: \u201cSo they want you guys to leave. Let\u2019s just leave. Let\u2019s make it easy.\u201d\nBut Flanagan is determined to pull rank. Veronica, in a yellow body-hugging satin dress, keeps telling the cop Flanagan is a lawyer.\nPoor Dan implores: \u201cCan we all talk?\u201d He is nattily dressed in a brown suit, because Clarke Cooke House, judged by Food & Wine Magazine as \u201cby far the most sophisticated restaurant in Newport,\u201d has a dress code: \u201cGentlemen, please, jackets required.\u201d\nRule-breakers\nBut despite his sartorial compliance, the women are in no mood to comply with any rules.\nThe cop approaches an outdoor host table, where three worried-looking restaurant staffers are watching.\n\u201cDo you guys just want them out?\u201d he asks. \u201cDo you want them trespassed?\u201d\n\u201cAnything we can do,\u201d says a staffer, placing his hands together in a prayerful gesture. \u201cI just need them out. Cuff them. Please. It\u2019s the only way.\u201d\nThe cop returns to the two women and Flanagan keeps barking at him about \u201cprotocol.\u201d\n\u201cOK, so you\u2019re trespassing so we gotta leave now, unless you want to be in handcuffs,\u201d the cop says.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not trespassing,\u201d Flanagan responds sternly, as if she is lecturing a witness in court. \u201cYou haven\u2019t notified us that we\u2019re trespassing, number one.\u201d\n\u201cWhat did I just tell you,\u201d says the cop. \u201cYou\u2019re trespassing. Let\u2019s go. I don\u2019t want to arrest you guys.\u201d\nAt this stage, they could just turn around and go home.\nBut no, Flanagan was going to teach this cop some respect.\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to arrest us. Number two, the protocol is \u2026\u201d\nShe keeps lecturing him. Veronica wags her finger in his face. Poor Dan is squirming in the background.\n\u201cYour protocol is if I ask you to turn off the bodycam, you have to turn it off and that\u2019s your protocol,\u201d Flanagan insists, infuriated that this cop isn\u2019t obeying her instruction\n\u201cShe\u2019s a f\u2013king lawyer so she knows,\u201d says Veronica.\nThe cop\u2019s patience is wearing thin. \u201cWell, that\u2019s bulls\u2013t lawyer stuff so that\u2019s not true. We gotta go.\u201d\nFlanagan lets fly with her trump card: \u201cI\u2019m an AG. I\u2019m an AG.\u201d\n\u201cGood for you,\u201d says the cop. \u201cI don\u2019t give a s\u2013t.\u201d\nAnd here is the moment in the video where all rational Americans let out a loud cheer.\nAmen, bravo, attaboy!\nThe bodycam ends minutes later after unseemly scenes of both women screaming as they are handcuffed and thrown in the back of cruisers.\nFull meltdown\nVeronica then has a full meltdown, kicking and running away and refusing to get into the car while screaming, \u201cNo! No! Babe! Babe,\u201d at poor Dan. But he is sensible enough to obey the cop\u2019s direction to stand back. All you hear from him is a calm voice: \u201cI\u2019m right here. I\u2019m right here,\u201d as his wife thrashes around like a madwoman.\nA little earlier, poor Dan had tried to defend the honor of the ladies, when the cop turned to him and said in exasperation: \u201cCan you get your children out of here? What are you doing?\u201d\n\u201cExcuse me,\u201d snapped a very offended Veronica, while Dan stammered: \u201cThey\u2019re two full-grown women and mothers.\u201d\nBut honestly, they were behaving like children having a tantrum, only with an extra dose of narcissism, condescension, arrogance and a grandiose sense of privilege.\nThe last we see of Flanagan is in the back of the cruiser shrieking: \u201cBuddy, you\u2019re going to regret this. You\u2019re going to regret it. I\u2019m an A \u2026\u201d\nThe door slamming in her face before she gets out the 12th \u201cI\u2019m an AG\u201d is one of the most satisfying moments in bodycam history.\nThat cop is all of us, fed up with Democrats pulling rank, acting superior while behaving irrationally.\nWe don\u2019t want to live in their world anymore. But unlike the rest of us, the cop could do something about it. All we can do is vote, or move out of the blue cities they\u2019ve trashed.\nFlanagan and Hannan were charged with willful trespass, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest, according to Newport police.\nFirst thing the next morning, Flanagan\u2019s boss, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, made her come into his office and watch the bodycam footage of her arrest. Oh, to have been a fly on the wall.\n\u201cLook, she\u2019s put me in a bad position,\u201d he said in an interview with WPRO radio Tuesday. \u201cShe\u2019s embarrassed herself, humiliated herself, treated the Newport Police Department horribly.\u201d\nHe wouldn\u2019t be drawn on whether she would be fired, saying only: \u201cThere will be a suspension without pay, if I retain her, for sure. So she\u2019s not going to continue as if nothing happened \u2026\n\u201cI think it\u2019s alcohol-related,\u201d he added.\nNo kidding.\nBut alcohol is not an excuse. It simply acts as a truth serum, amplifying character traits like the pervasive sense of entitlement that seems to afflict Democrats like Flanagan, or the pink-shirted DOJ official, Sean Charles Dunn, who threw a Subway sandwich at an ICE agent in DC in a fit of foul-mouthed rage.\nAll they\u2019re doing is losing hearts and minds, as shown by the fact that, for the first time since 2018, more new voters nationwide chose to be Republicans than Democrats last year, according to a mournful story in the New York Times.\nThese people need to grow up and stop thinking the world revolves around them. America is tired of their tantrums."

      "text": "Feds investigating Sen. Adam Schiff for alleged mortgage fraud after DOJ criminal referral: report\nSen. Adam Schiff is reportedly under federal investigation for alleged mortgage fraud after a federal housing agency sent a criminal referral to the Justice Department in May regarding the California Democrat\u2019s ownership of a Maryland home.\nThe US Attorney\u2019s Office in Maryland is leading the probe, which could result in charges against the junior senator from California and former 12-term congressman, a Trump administration source told Fox News \u201cIngraham Angle\u201d host Laura Ingraham on Tuesday.\nThe DOJ, Maryland US Attorney\u2019s Office and Schiff did not immediately respond to The Post\u2019s requests for comment.\nFederal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director William Pulte sent a referral letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche on May 27 detailing \u201cmultiple instances\u201d between 2003 and 2019 when Schiff allegedly \u201cfalsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favorable loan terms, impacting payments\u201d for property he owns in Potomac, Md. \u2014 one of the most affluent Washington, DC, suburbs.\nSchiff, 65, listed the Maryland home as his primary residence in several mortgage refinancing filings between 2009 and 2013, despite being an elected official representing the Golden State and having taken out a homeowner\u2019s tax exemption on a Burbank, Calif., condo he purchased \u2014 which he also claimed as his primary residence \u2014 over the same time period, according to Pulte.\nSchiff and his wife did not list the Potomac property as a secondary residence until 2020, Pulte noted.\n\u201cMr. Schiff appears to have falsified records in order to receive favorable loan terms, and also appears to have been aware of the financial benefits of a primary residence mortgage when compared to a secondary residence mortgage as a spokesperson in 2023 told the media outlet CNN that, \u2018Adam\u2019s California and Maryland addresses have been listed as primary residences for loan purposes because they are both occupied throughout the year and to distinguish them from a vacation property,\u2019\u201d the letter explained.\nSchiff may have violated federal laws against wire fraud, mail fraud, bank fraud and making false statements to financial institutions, Pulte said.\nSchiff is a former House Intelligence Committee chairman whose unproven claims about President Trump\u2019s ties to Russia enraged Republicans and led to his censure. He also served as chief manager in Trump\u2019s 2020 Senate impeachment trial for pressuring Ukraine to investigate alleged Biden family corruption.\nWhen reports of the criminal referral emerged in July, Schiff denied any wrongdoing in messages posted on X.\n\u201cSince I led his first impeachment, Trump has repeatedly called for me to be arrested for treason. So in a way, I guess this is a bit of a letdown. And this baseless attempt at political retribution won\u2019t stop me from holding him accountable. Not by a long shot,\u201d the senator wrote.\n\u201cThis is just Donald Trump\u2019s latest attempt at political retaliation against his perceived enemies,\u201d Schiff added. \u201cSo it is not a surprise, only how weak this false allegation turns out to be. And much as Trump may hope, this smear will not distract from his Epstein files problem.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Schiff noted at the time that \u201cthe lenders who provided the mortgages for both homes were well aware of then-Representative Schiff\u2019s Congressional service and of his intended year-round use of both homes, neither of which were vacation homes.\u201d"

      "text": "We know that the Biden administration deliberately broke the border and ushered in over 20 million illegal aliens, at a huge cost to the nation\u2019s social welfare system, and with a reckless disregard for potential criminality and terrorism.\nExactly why it did it has always been the burning question.\nA new Rasmussen poll gives us a clue: It\u2019s the census.\nThere is mounting evidence that the Biden administration tried to cook the books to give Democrats an unfair advantage, which explains why a minority of Democrats (43% compared to 83% Republicans) approve of President Trump\u2019s decision to take a new census that excludes illegal aliens from the population count.\nIllegal migrants have always been included in the census, so blue states like California, Texas, New York and New Jersey, which bore the brunt of Biden\u2019s influx, get increased representation, which means more congressional seats for Democrats, more Electoral College votes for Democrats, and more funding for Democrats.\nMeanwhile, Democrat-proxy NGOs, not to mention federal agencies under Biden, like FEMA, were registering them to vote, even though they are not eligible. That\u2019s why Democrats fought tooth and nail to prevent voter ID so that ineligible non-citizens could vote. Further down the track, they figured that amnesty would net them tens of millions of new Democratic voters \u2014 at least for a generation or so.\nBut that was just the icing on the cake. The census was the immediate payoff, and they didn\u2019t care how many illegal aliens raped, murdered, robbed or extorted American citizens. They didn\u2019t care that the social safety net in cities like New York was collapsing under the weight of all these new supplicants. Slave-labor wages that undercut American workers only make sense if the state picks up the cost of room and board and health care for the slaves.\nIt was the census that would give Democrats more power, and in April 2021, when Biden Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced the 2020 Census results, we started to see \u201cerrors\u201d that mostly only went one way.\nRed states like Florida, Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas and Tennessee were undercounted while blue states like New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Minnesota, and Biden\u2019s home state of Delaware had overcounts, skewing political representation and funding allocation.\n\u201cThe miscounts \u2026 particularly given that overrepresentation appears to have tended to noticeably skew in favor of one political party over another, demands additional scrutiny of potential political influence by the Biden-Harris Administration or other deficiencies that would explain these errors,\u201d House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) wrote in a letter to the Census Bureau last year.\nRasmussen teased out public attitudes to these \u201cerrors\u201d with a poll of 1,184 likely voters conducted August 11-13.\nJust 37% of Democrats said illegal migrants should not be counted in the census, while 49% said they should, and 13% weren\u2019t sure. By contrast, 65% of Republicans wanted illegal immigrants excluded, while a mystifying 29% wanted them to be counted.\nOn the question of Trump ordering up a new census to replace the error-ridden 2020 pandemic version, 57% of voters approved while 34% disapproved. Of those, a whopping 83% of Republicans were in favor compared to 43% of Democrats.\nThe fact is, even before Comer conducts his investigation, before all the evidence is in, Democratic voters instinctively know that the census hoax benefited their side."

      "text": "Collapse of Tish James\u2019 civil-fraud case vs. Trump is the latest blow to Dem lawfare\nChalk up another win for President Donald Trump over Democrats who tried to destroy him with lawfare.\nOn Thursday, a New York appellate court tossed the ludicrous half-billion-dollar penalty imposed on Trump in state Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 utterly political civil-fraud case.\nThe ridiculously enormous fine was meant to hamstring him as he ran for president, though James and trial-court Judge Arthur Engoron pretended it was about warning others not to imitate his supposedly fraudulent actions.\nActions that harmed . . . exactly no one.\nThe penalty \u201cis an excessive fine that violates the Eighth Amendment,\u201d wrote the judges.\nTheir decision doesn\u2019t void Engoron\u2019s finding that Trump defrauded lenders and insurers by overestimating the value of his assets, though the Court of Appeals (the state\u2019s top court) may do so. But either way it makes the case appear even more pointless than it already was.\nAfter all, Trump warned the bankers, etc., that those estimates weren\u2019t audited and assumed they\u2019d do their own due diligence. And indeed, none of them ever complained, let alone sued Trump on their own.\nIndeed, two of the five appellate judges found serious errors in the trial proceedings and sought a re-do; one, David Friedman, said the whole case merits immediate dismissal.\n\u201cPlainly, [James\u2019] ultimate goal was not \u2018market hygiene,\u2019\u201d fumed Friedman, \u201cbut political hygiene, ending with the derailment of President Trump\u2019s political career and the destruction of his real estate business.\u201d\n\u201cThe voters have obviously rendered a verdict on his political career. This bench today unanimously derails the effort to destroy his business.\u201d Hear, hear.\nRemember, James campaigned on promises to find something (anything!) to target Trump for \u2014 a witch-hunt, that is, that should have disqualified her from the start.\nThese nothingburger civil charges were the best she could find; if they\u2019d wound up before a less-biased judge than Engoron, they would\u2019ve died long ago.\nMeanwhile, the two federal criminal cases against Trump are now kaput; the Georgia state prosecution imploded, too.\nIn the one criminal case where Trump was found guilty (in deeply anti-Trump Manhattan), the judge socked him with . . . no penalties whatsoever \u2014 and the prez is appealing that decision, too, on overwhelmingly strong grounds.\nAs Judge Friedman suggested, Democrats thought if they couldn\u2019t stop Trump through normal democratic means, they\u2019d get the courts to stop him (to save \u201cdemocracy\u201d!).\nThey failed on both fronts.\nMaybe some day soon they\u2019ll give up lawfare and other schemes, and focus on finding viable political ideas and candidates that voters can get behind on the merits."

A grand jury in Maryland is currently weighing a criminal indictment against the former 12-term congressman.\nThe newly released annual financial documents show that even after Schiff finally designated his Potomac, Maryland property as a second home in 2020 \u2013 after 16 years \u2013 he got the exact rock-bottom mortgage rate as his California residence when he refinanced both that year.\nThe average 30-year mortgage interest rate in 2020 was 3.10% for primary residences in the US, with secondary residences usually subject to rates up to 0.5% higher.\nThose terms padded his wealth, since the California Democrat would have saved somewhere between $30,000 to $50,000 over 16 years, an analysis by The Post found.\nThat spacious 3,420-square-foot home, in one of DC\u2019s most affluent suburbs, where neighbors say Schiff actually spends most of his time, is now worth $1.4 million \u2013 almost double what he paid for it in 2003.\nSchiff also benefited from a homeowner\u2019s tax exemption by declaring his much smaller 650-square-foot one-bedroom, one-bathroom condo in Burbank, California a primary home, resulting in a $7,000 reduction in property taxes.\nThe Senator\u2019s bank assets soared to between $1.18 million and $2.63 million in 2024, the records also show.\nThat\u2019s up from between $1.02 million and $2.37 million in 2023, and from $578,000 \u2013 $1.35 million in 2002, the year before he bought the Maryland home.\nSchiff, 65, who led the first House impeachment inquiry into President Trump and has repeatedly said \u201cno one\u2019s above the law,\u201d has also failed to disclose his mortgages on annual financial disclosures until 2011, a Post review found, even though he bought the Potomac property in 2003 and the California condo in 2009, an omission he has not explained.\nHe\u2019s been called \u201ccrooked\u201d and \u201clow-life\u201d by President Trump.\n\u201cI have always suspected Shifty Adam Schiff was a scam artist,\u201d Trump wrote in July on Truth Social.\nSchiff is accused of wire fraud, mail fraud, bank fraud and making false statements to financial institutions, charges which carry prison terms of up to 30 years.\nHe has denied wrongdoing and called the investigation a political witch hunt.\n\u201cSince I led his first impeachment, Trump has repeatedly called for me to be arrested for treason,\u201d Schiff wrote on X when news of the investigation broke in July.\n\u201cThis is just Donald Trump\u2019s latest attempt at political retaliation against his perceived enemies.\u201d\n\u201cAdam Schiff\u2019s baseless smears of corruption against President Trump and Republicans have one simple explanation \u2014 he\u2019s projecting,\u201d Republican National Committee Press Secretary Kiersten Pels told The Post.\n\u201cSchiff is a proven liar, a con man, and a fraud,\u201d Pels added.\n\u201cSenator Schiff received the rate that each lender deemed appropriate with full knowledge of the senator\u2019s year-round bicoastal work obligations as a member of Congress, his use of two homes for that reason, and his creditworthiness,\u201d a spokesperson for Schiff told The Post.\n\u201cIt\u2019s laughable that Donald Trump, who turned the presidency into a pay-to-play scheme to enrich himself, is desperate to project his own corruption onto others.\u201d"

      "text": "You know it\u2019s a bad idea if Joe Biden was for it. That\u2019s the case with the mad push for marijuana reform, which Biden promised in a cynical grab for young voters in his State of the Union address last year.\nBut now President Trump is reported to be open to fulfilling Biden\u2019s promise to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous Schedule III drug, which would benefit the $33 billion industry by giving it tax deductions and expanding its market.\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, Trump told donors he was considering \u201cde-scheduling\u201d marijuana at a $1 million-a-plate fundraiser at his Bedminster golf club in New Jersey this month that was attended by Kim Rivers, chief executive of one of the largest marijuana companies, Trulieve.\nTrulieve and its ilk pretend that marijuana reforms are for altruistic medical reasons rather than about growing their profits.\nMedical marijuana was the bait-and-switch trap when states started legalizing pot more than a decade ago.\nNow recreational use has exploded to the point where it has overtaken alcohol, and there\u2019s still no sound science on the benefits of medical marijuana.\n\u2018Complicated subject\u2019\nThe president confirmed last week to reporters at the White House that his administration is \u201clooking at reclassification\u201d and intends to make a decision soon.\n\u201cSome people like it. Some people hate it,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people hate the whole concept of marijuana because if it does bad for the children, it does bad for people that are older than children.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very complicated subject base,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard great things having to do with medical and bad things having to do with just about everything else.\u201d\nTrump is a teetotaler.\nHe credits his late older brother Fred Trump Jr. with his decision not to drink or take drugs. Fred struggled with alcoholism, and died in 1981, at age 42, as a consequence of his disease.\n\u201cHe was a very handsome guy,\u201d Trump told me on \u201cPod Force One.\u201d \u201cHe had an unbelievable personality, but the booze got to him \u2026 He\u2019d always say, \u2018Don\u2019t drink, don\u2019t smoke.\u2019 Now in those days, there were no drugs, or I guess there were, but you didn\u2019t know about it. But he would have added drugs in there. He said, \u2018Don\u2019t ever smoke and don\u2019t ever drink.\u2019\n\u201cHe was a great guy, you know, he was terrific. Could have done anything. He could fly airplanes unbelievably well,\u201d Trump added. \u201cHe had a great talent for that, but alcohol was a killer for him.\u201d\nTrump learned from his brother\u2019s mistakes: \u201cI never had a drink of alcohol. I don\u2019t smoke, and I\u2019m a hard worker. Well, he worked, but he just had the curse, you know, and it was tough.\u201d\nMarijuana is a disaster. It\u2019s infinitely worse than alcohol on every metric, especially mental health. The scientific evidence is incontrovertible that marijuana triggers psychosis in susceptible people.\nFor example, a large-scale Danish study published in the American Journal of Psychiatry in 2017 found that up to 30% of young men\u2019s schizophrenia could have been prevented if they had not used pot.\nEven one psychotic episode triggered by marijuana use was associated with a 47% chance of a person developing schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, with the highest risk for those ages 16 to 25, according to the study of 6.9 million Danes between 1972 and 2021.\nAnother longitudinal study of 50,000 Swedes that began in 1987 found that marijuana users were twice as likely as non-users to develop psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia. Heavy users had a six times greater risk.\nA more potent problem\nAnd it was a far less potent drug than it is now.\nMarijuana of 40 years ago had about a 5% concentration of THC, the intoxicating component of cannabis, but today\u2019s industrial products such as gummies, vapes and pre-rolled joints can be as high as 99% THC.\nThe stench of pot wafting through blue cities like New York is a hallmark of chaos and disorder. It\u2019s the opposite of Trump\u2019s law-and-order image.\nSo it is hard to believe he would bow to Big Weed and normalize this insidious drug further.\nUnlike his predecessor, Trump understands on a personal level the perils of addiction.\nYou\u2019d think Biden, with the drug problems that have afflicted the lives of both his adult children, Hunter and Ashley, might have had more sense, but pandering to Big Weed was a running theme of his presidency, with executive orders and performative pardons for federal marijuana possession (not one person was in jail for possession alone).\nThankfully, wise heads inside the Drug Enforcement Administration slow-walked things long enough to stop Biden\u2019s plan to reclassify marijuana.\nThe drug lobby has redoubled efforts under Trump, but the signs don\u2019t look good for it with the confirmation last month of the new DEA administrator, Terrance Cole.\nMuch to the disappointment of pot advocates, marijuana was nowhere to be seen on his list of \u201cstrategic priorities\u201d announced after he took office, which included combating drug trafficking, Mexican cartels, fentanyl and drug-fueled violence.\nEven better, in a post on LinkedIn last year, he wrote: \u201cEverybody knows my stance on marijuana after 30 plus years in law enforcement, so don\u2019t even ask!\u201d He added anti-drug hashtags #justsayno, #disorders, #notlegal4distribution, #healthissues, #thinblueline and #backtheblue.\nEvery week, Post columnist Miranda Devine sits down for exclusive and candid conversations with the most influential disruptors in Washington. Subscribe here!\nCole, who worked at the DEA for 21 years, has made no secret of his concerns about marijuana. sharing a link last year to an article titled \u201cNOT \u2018Just Weed\u2019: Four Times More Dangerous in Three Decades\u201d that found that higher THC levels are \u201clinked to increased problems with memory and learning, distorted perception, difficulty in thinking and problem-solving, and loss of coordination.\u201d\nCole\u2019s attitude is a good sign.\n3 states \u2018just say no\u2019\nSo is the fact that three states \u2014 Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota \u2014 last November rejected marijuana legalization measures on the ballot. This goes against the trend of the past decade in which 24 states have approved the drug for recreational use and 40 for medical use, which of course is just the Trojan horse.\nIn Florida, Big Weed, mainly Trulieve, spent a reported $153 million lobbying for legalization and still lost, despite outspending opponents almost five to one.\nIt was the third time in four years that poor old North and South Dakotans rejected the ballot measure. But Big Weed just won\u2019t take no for an answer, believing that it will eventually wear voters down.\nAnother good sign is that even the New York Times is starting to tell the truth about marijuana, reporting that 18 million people \u2014 nearly a third of adult users \u2014 report symptoms of \u201ccannabis use disorder.\u201d\nThe Times points out that only two states cap the levels of THC, with lobbyists busy preventing any new state health restrictions.\nLet\u2019s hope that the Trump administration puts the brakes on the headlong rush to legalize this dangerous drug."

Trump has threatened to fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook over similar allegations, citing the FHFA\u2019s referral and linking the case to a broader political struggle over Fed policy. The investigations also touch on other Democrats, including Attorney General Letitia James, and highlight the use of mortgage fraud as a tool for political retribution. The cases underscore the potential legal and political fallout for high\u2011profile officials accused of manipulating mortgage documentation.",
