  "description": "Move Reinforces Company Growth, Commitment to Employee Experience with Vibrant, Thoughtfully Designed Space RALEIGH, N.C., Aug. 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- McAdams, a multidisciplinary planning, design and engineering firm",
  "content": "RALEIGH, N.C., Aug. 5, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- McAdams, a multidisciplinary planning, design and engineering firm headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, is officially relocating its Durham office to a brand-new space at the Imperial Center, Bristol Place. Located at 4819 Emperor Blvd., Suite 110, this transition marks a new chapter for one of the region's leading design and consulting firms while keeping collaboration and convenience at the forefront.\n\nThe decision to relocate was driven by the evolving needs of McAdams' Durham team, whose feedback shaped the selection and design of the new office. By staying just a few miles from their current Meridian Parkway address, McAdams ensures continuity for employees while providing expanded features that support both daily productivity and long-term growth.\n\nThe new, first-floor office suite spans approximately 19,000 square feet and is thoughtfully designed to support both the current team and future growth. With a flexible layout tailored to each discipline, and modern amenities like covered parking, highway access, a nearby 4-mile paved trail, and numerous dining options, the space not only enhances the daily experience for current employees but also serves as a compelling draw for prospective team members seeking a vibrant, well-connected workplace.\n\n\"Durham has been part of our story for more than 35 years, and this move reinforces our continued commitment to the city,\" said Mike Munn, President of McAdams. \"It's a place that continues to inspire innovation and opportunity for our projects, our clients, and our people. As we grow, we're excited to keep adding talented teammates to our Durham team and investing in the future of this vibrant community.\"\n\nPlanning is already underway, with the lease signed and interior build-out soon to begin in partnership with a trusted local contractor. McAdams projects a seamless transition, with the target move-in date set for early summer 2026.\n\nThe relocation holds positive implications for employees' daily routines as well. Remaining within the same travel radius ensures that commutes remain consistent, while the Imperial Center's amenities encourage balance and well-being beyond the workday. As McAdams embraces its next phase, the company remains steadfast in its pursuit of a connected, productive, and thriving workplace.\n\nAbout McAdams\n\nFounded in 1979, McAdams is a full-service planning, design, and engineering firm focused on civil/site design, water resources, transportation, planning and design, geomatics, and construction administration, headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina with offices throughout Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas.
