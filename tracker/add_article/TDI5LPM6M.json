      "summary": "The article explains that while borrowers seek lower interest rates, lenders—such as banks and the government—must earn revenue from those rates. It highlights how the Federal Reserve’s policy rate influences banks’ willingness to lend, especially for long‑term mortgages, and shows historical small‑business loan rates reflecting inflationary pressures. Small firms often use multiple banks and actively refinance when rates change, with finance and interest rates being a top business concern, particularly in agriculture and retail. The Fed’s dual mandate to maintain employment and price stability creates tension, as low inflation supports low rates but may conflict with employment goals.",
