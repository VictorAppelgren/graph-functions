  "description": "First shown off at CES, Lenovo's ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 features an extendable 120Hz OLED display. I spent a week with it - here's my verdict.",
  "content": "Lenovo unveiled its \"rollable\" laptop at CES two years ago as a wild proof of concept that turned heads, but left consumers skeptical. Well, the company has since proved its point: the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable is now available to consumers for an eye-watering $3,300, but packed with premium design elements, solid hardware, and a 120Hz OLED display that extends to almost 17 inches at the press of a button.\n\nAlso: Lenovo's $3,000 rollable ThinkBook laptop is officially available to buy - know this before you do\n\nI've been using the ThinkBook Plus for over a week as my main laptop, and I have to admit, I'm enamored by the extendable screen, particularly as a productivity machine for work.\n\nBut as the first of its kind, it's far from perfect. There are a handful of trade-offs due to the laptop's form, and the sky-high price invites a critical eye to every element of its design. That being said, it is ultimately a well-engineered laptop. Let's take a closer look.\n\nLike all ThinkBooks, the laptop exudes business, featuring a metallic, two-tone design. It's not my favorite aesthetic, but it's certainly durable and resists fingerprints way better than all the matte black designs out there.\n\nUpon first glance, the laptop looks like any other. One of the first things to stand out is the thick bezels framing the display, but as your eye draws to the bottom, you notice something strange: there's no bottom bezel -- the screen just continues below the keyboard.\n\nAlso: How to buy a laptop for school, work, or gaming (and our top picks for each)\n\nThe rest of the rollable screen is parked underneath, waiting to be unfurled. With the push of a button, the standard-sized display extends upwards, increasing the screen size to 16.7 inches.\n\nThe result is a large, portrait-style display that goes far beyond any other standard laptop screen size on the market. The glossy, OLED screen delivers a fantastic picture, with no flickering or dimming around the edges, although there is some visible creasing that looks like what you'd see on a foldable phone's display.\n\nThis is especially true if you rotate the glossy display to reflect the light. It's a little more visible than I expected and certainly something of note (given the price), but ultimately, it doesn't really overshadow the benefit of the large screen.\n\nFor example, you stop noticing the creasing when your attention is focused on what you're actually doing. It's one of those things that's an inevitable part of its mechanics -- it took foldable phones several years to reduce the creasing on their displays -- and although it doesn't exactly scream \"premium\", it doesn't cancel out the benefits the screen provides.\n\nAlso: I tried Lenovo's infamous 'rollable' laptop at CES - it's more practical than I thought\n\nSo what are the said benefits? First off, the extra room is a breath of fresh air. It allows for a spacious workspace that I have to admit, makes for a very nice user experience. Personally, I like running one large, full-screen desktop, but you can also put two windows, one on top of the other, for two 16:9 desktops.\n\nTo maximize real estate, I set the scale in Windows to 125%, bringing the UI down to a more manageable size that results in a crisp and efficient interface. However, if you want a larger UI, it still feels more roomy than a regular laptop display.\n\nIf you're a programmer, you'll appreciate the extended portrait orientation, but anyone who works with documents will love being able to see a third more content on the screen at a glance.\n\nAs an editor, it drastically improves working in Google Docs and my browser-based CMS, both of which benefit from more visibility without having to squint at a UI that's been scaled down to the atomic level.\n\nEven basic web browsing is improved, with more of the page on the screen at once, and more content visible with less scrolling. In that sense, the display mirrors the mobile layout, which is ultimately more scrollable.\n\nRolling the screen up can be done by pressing the associated key or with a hand gesture in front of the webcam. While it's extending, the screen defaults to playing an animation (different ones are selectable in settings) with some thematic music, then reloading your desktop once it reaches the desired size. The music can be a little much in a quiet office, so luckily, all of these features can be turned off.\n\nWhen fully extended, the bottom third of the screen is occupied by the Lenovo widget panel, which shows reminders, your to-do list, and a calendar at a glance. You can pin this to stay permanently on or have it hide behind your other apps.\n\nThere's actually a lot of content here, including short videos that show how to use gesture controls to raise and lower the display and some suggestions on how to organize the screen more effectively.\n\nBeyond the display, the rest of the laptop's core components are quite nice. The keyboard is a little shallow, but the keys feel great, with a satisfying click that's crisp and responsive.\n\nI was also thrilled to find the haptic trackpad to be just as well-engineered, with a uniform click no matter where you press down on the pad, and a sensitive input for swipe gestures. One thing to note, however, is that in cooler temperatures, you might have some trouble with the pad recognizing your fingers, especially if they're cold.\n\nAlso: The Lenovo ThinkPad streak is over: This model I tested bucks a decade-long trend (for the better)\n\nAlso note that the laptop's form factor limits its I/O access, with just two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports and a headphone jack. All three ports are located on the left side of the device, which might be problematic for some users, but is an expected trade-off for the features.\n\nAll in all, the laptop's core physical build feels premium (if a little chunky), and even without the rollable display, it would be a solid office laptop. The fingerprint reader on the power key, along with support for Wi-Fi 7 seal the deal as a modern business device.\n\nUnder the hood, the Intel Core Ultra 7 \"Lunar Lake\" processor, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage make for a standard hardware loadout comparable to any number of mid-to-upper range business laptops. The big display is powered by an integrated Intel Arc 140V GPU with 16GB of internal memory, supplying more than enough power for daily use.\n\nIf you're looking to game on this laptop, it can handle some mainstream titles, but it's not exactly built for running top-tier gaming content. In \"normal\" laptop mode, you've got a 2000 x 1600 resolution, standard fare for a 14-inch. But if your game supports a 2000 x 2350 resolution, you can play with the screen fully extended, which definitely feels like a unique experience, but because of all the screen space, it isn't exactly optimized for high-APM gaming.\n\nIf you're playing an older game that doesn't support that resolution, well, the game will simply revert to the traditional resolution, resulting in empty space below the window and negating the whole point of the extended display. The bottom line here: gaming can be a bonus for this laptop, but not what it's made for.\n\nAlso: Finally, a Windows laptop that I wouldn't mind putting away my MacBook Pro for\n\nRegarding battery life, the display expectedly cuts into the 66Whr battery's longevity, although not as much as you might expect. During normal use, you can get a full work day of use out of it with the screen extended, but it's cutting it close. If you add in videoconferencing and more demanding workloads, you might not make it through the day without a power top-up.\n\nThat being said, the Lunar Lake chip does allow for the battery loss to reduce to a trickle when not in use, and it charges fast: about 80% in an hour. In our video playback test, we got a little over 11 hours at half brightness in balanced mode over Wi-Fi.\n\nSo let's address the elephant in the room: the price. Lenovo is well aware that this laptop is not for everyone. In fact, it's probably the most niche product I've reviewed all year. Instead, it's more about proving a point.\n\nAlso: I've tested dozens of ThinkPads: Here's the Lenovo model I keep coming back to\n\nLenovo wants to project a reputation of innovation, but more importantly, it wants to prove it can deliver said products to market. This device reflects that mission, earning it an important place in Lenovo's portfolio, even if it's not the year's top seller.\n\nIt's also the first iteration of this rollable concept, and as such, the physical design is not quite as polished as you'd find in Lenovo's other high-end laptops, like the ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition or the X1 Carbon. These laptops come from a product line backed up by decades of design and engineering, with the ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 having room to improve in subsequent model versions.\n\nThe ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 is an impressive product, even considering its trade-offs. The display has visible creases and thick bezels, but when it's fully extended, you forget about them. The battery isn't the best, but it's far from the worst. It's not a stellar gaming rig, but that's not why you buy a ThinkBook, anyway.\n\nIt's niche, and it's expensive, but it does what it's supposed to: deliver a fantastic user experience in the office, with an expansive, flexible display that looks great, pairs nicely with a premium haptic touchpad, and just the right amount of power under the hood.\n\nAlso: I switched to the Dell 14 Premium for two weeks, and it made my XPS laptop look bad\n\nAt $3,200, this isn't a mainstream laptop, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you're absolutely sold on the extendable display and are committed to the form factor in the long term.\n\nThe reality is that you can get almost anything for less: a MacBook Pro M4 with 24GB of RAM, or the new brand-new Dell 14 Premium with the same processor and an upgraded Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU for $1,000 less. But if you're in love with the big screen, I can say that it's a productivity game-changer in the office.",

The 14\u2011inch ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 Rollable laptop looks standard at first glance -- until a hand gesture in front of the device extends the rollable display hidden under the keyboard, doubling the screen real estate.\nAlso: I tried Lenovo's infamous 'rollable' laptop at CES - it's more practical than I thought\nThe laptop was introduced as a proof of concept back in January without many details on its price point or whether it would actually make it to market. I estimated that it wouldn't be cheap, and that proved correct. It's currently retailing for $3,299 for the 14\u2011inch version with 32GB of memory, 1TB of storage, and an Intel Core Ultra 7 258V processor.\nAn extendable theater screen\nIt's pricey, but the laptop doesn't cut corners with hardware. The rollable display is a vibrant, 2.3K OLED non\u2011touch screen that runs at 120 Hz refresh rate and 400 nits of brightness -- not bad for a 16.7\u2011inch screen. The display's mechanical component works similar to an extendable theater screen, retreating under the keyboard when not in use. There's no crease like a foldable phone.\nAlso: The best Lenovo laptops of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nSo, what's its intended use case? The rollable display is essentially a built-in portable monitor, offering more screen real estate without the need to carry additional gear. When fully extended, you can easily fit two windows on top of one another, or two side\u2011by\u2011side in a column format.\nFlashy CES gadget\nDespite being a flashy CES gadget, Lenovo's push to bring this device to market makes a point: not only can the company iterate on new ideas, it can actualize them. That said, the price relegates it to a high\u2011end niche object that is as much a novelty as it is practical.\nThe build is surprisingly good, however. When I went hands-on with the laptop earlier this year, I noted it was more sturdy than I expected while extended, with only a little screen wobble. It was, however, pretty awkward to pack up if the screen was up, since it's not manually retractable -- you have to wait for it to retract before moving it around.\nAlso: The best laptops you can buy: Expert tested\nYou can extend the screen by hitting a button on the keyboard, but it also responds to a hand gesture. Holding your palm out in front of the device and then raising or lowering it will raise or lower the display.\nIf you take this thing into a coffee shop, you're guaranteed to get a few stares, but with all that extra screen real estate, you won't even notice.\nGet the morning's top stories in your inbox each day with our Tech Today newsletter."

      "text": "I tried Lenovo's infamous 'rollable' laptop at CES - it's more practical than I thought\nLenovo unveiled an unexpected new laptop alongside its fleet of new devices at CES 2025: a 14-inch laptop with a \"rollable\" display that extends upwards over 16 inches, and it works better than I initially assumed.\nThe ThinkBook Plus Gen 6 looks like a normal 14-inch device on the surface but hit a button on the keyboard, and the display starts growing upward. Once it's fully extended, the screen measures 16.7 inches, which doesn't sound like a lot, but Lenovo says you gain about 50% screen real estate.\nAlso: CES 2025: The 12 most impressive products so far\nIt's definitely comparable to working on an external monitor, as I was able to fit two browser windows of equal size on top of one another just fine when I demoed it. Working on a portrait-oriented monitor is not everyone's preference (as opposed to a landscape orientation) but plenty of users prefer it, especially coders and writers who work with long, vertical text windows.\nI should mention that this isn't like a foldable phone; there's no bend or gap in the screen, which is the first thing I thought when I saw it. The display is on a rolling mechanism that tucks the extra inches away under the keyboard when it's not extended, making the entire thing one seamless surface.\nThe screen itself looks great, to boot. It's a 120Hz OLED display that goes up to 400 nits of brightness. There's an obvious benefit to having more screen area on demand, and the amount you gain is significant enough here to warrant its purpose (and potentially its cost, more on that in a minute). But there are certainly some logistical concerns.\nAlso: Exclusive: Incase announces new keyboard that Microsoft designed (but never released)\nThe first thing I was worried about was that having a display that big would make the device unstable and top-heavy. With the screen extended, however, it doesn't feel precarious. The bottom half of the device is on the bulky side and keeps it firmly planted on whatever surface it's on. Weighing 3.7 pounds, it's not Lenovo's lightest laptop, but all things considered, even that's not bad.\nWhen the screen is fully extended, however, closing the laptop back up is awkward. You have a closed clamshell with an active display poking out from behind the keyboard, and it's certainly not portable in this state.\nThe obvious solution is to just remember to lower the screen before packing it up, but someone somewhere will inevitably throw it in a bag in this state, and damage the exposed display in the process. For this reason, I'd recommend the screen automatically roll back to the retracted state if it senses that the clamshell is closed.\nAlso: Best laptops of CES 2025: These 5 Windows PCs left the biggest mark on the show floor\nThe process of extending the screen is as easy as hitting a button on the keyboard, but it also responds to a hand gesture. Holding your palm out in front of the device and then raising or lowering it will activate the display to take one of those actions, which could be useful if you're using this as a laptop for presentations.\nAlthough this laptop has \"buzzworthy CES gadget\" written all over it, I think there's merit to the idea. With hybrid and remote work being the new normal, consumers are buying more laptops than desktops, and there needs to be space to iterate on the \"single screen clamshell\" laptop format. Extendable screens aren't that crazy; this technology has existed for years in other products like home theater screens and commercial displays.\nLenovo first debuted this device two years ago at CES as a prototype model, but now it's in the pipeline as a fully realized product, expected to be commercially available as early as Q1 2025. This idea-to-reality transformation is what CES is all about, and Lenovo is definitely flexing here to show itself as not only an organization with groundbreaking R&D but one that can actualize its ideas.\nAs far as its intended user goes, it's certainly geared toward a business consumer who needs a device with extra screen real estate for presentations and multitasking. Programmers will appreciate the portrait-style display.\nAlso: TCL shocked CES 2025 by launching a great TV you can actually preorder\nUnder the hood, this is a ThinkBook, after all, featuring an Intel Core Ultra processor, Intel Arc GPU, and Wi-Fi 7. For connectivity, it only has two USB-C ports, which seems a little restricting, but at least you know one of those won't be for your external monitor.\nLastly, let's mention the price. Lenovo says the suggested retail will start at $3,499, which relegates it to the high end of the spectrum. Essentially you just have to be committed to the concept for it to be worth it, and the benefit of a mobile extra monitor on demand would need to outweigh simply popping your laptop into a stationary display.\nFor now, the price makes this laptop a niche pick, but I think there's an interesting concept here. If manufacturers can get to a point where extendable screens utilize affordable technology, people will use them. For now, taking this thing to a coffee shop might elicit some stares, but all that extra screen space will be worth it."

It goes without saying that this TV is a beast -- an expensive one. And the Bravia 5 is not even considered the company's flagship model (you can look to the Bravia 8 II and Bravia 9 for that). But this TV is impressive, and after testing it for a week, I'll explain why.\nAlso: You should turn off this default TV setting ASAP - and why even experts recommend it\nThe Bravia 5 is a Google TV, so setting up the UI was fairly easy using the remote and the Google Home app on my phone. But be prepared for a series of screens requiring you to check boxes for privacy disclaimers. The era of streaming content has become very complicated.\nOtherwise, the interface is intuitive, offering quick access to a vast selection of streaming services, apps, and voice control capabilities via Google Assistant. The personalization features are also a plus for helping you discover new content.\nThis behemoth of a display comes with a relatively small remote control. It's slender and lightweight, and if you have fat fingers like me, you might accidentally press enter when you meant to press a navigation button.\nAlso: Your TV's USB port has an underrated feature that can revitalize an old system for free\nI appreciate the downsizing of remotes across most brands these days. Yet despite all the streamlining, Sony (and most others) insist on including dedicated app buttons. You know, for Netflix, YouTube, Disney+, and whatever other platforms the manufacturer contracts with. These buttons take up a lot of real estate and make the remote seem almost \"disposable\" because brands get bought, sold, and sometimes change names.\nFor example, I have a Roku TV with a Vudu button. Who or what is Vudu? That platform still exists, but it's now known as Fandango Media (a joint venture between NBC Universal and Warner Bros.).\nI don't mean to make an example of Sony; its engineers are simply abiding by the current trend. Yet, I haven't met anyone who says they use these dedicated app buttons. When you have a smartly designed home screen, you don't need them.\nThat is one of my two peevish critiques of the Sony Bravia 5. Second is the fact that this remote is not backlit. Come on, Sony. If I'm buying a $6,000 TV, I envision a home cinema experience in the dark (just like in a movie theatre). This means I don't want to turn on my phone to aim a light source at the \"magic wand\" just so I can pause the thing when my DoorDash order arrives. To me, backlighting on remotes seems like a simple ask for anything above a budget model television.\nApologies for my digressionary rant on remote control design. Despite these minor gripes, it became clear to me that the Bravia 5 has plenty to shout about.\nAlso: The next big HDMI leap has arrived - how the 2.2 standard is shaking things up\nFor one thing, Sony's prowess in display technology is impressive. Its proprietary Cognitive Processor XR upscales images beautifully, ensuring motion is slippery smooth with minimal blur. From fast-paced action scenes in the 2023 Mission: Impossible rendition to 2025 NBA highlights, the Bravia 5 delivered 4K resolution with exceptional clarity, vibrant colors, and impressive contrast. HDR content truly pops, showcasing deep blacks and brilliant highlights.\nWhile 4K content looks phenomenal, lower-resolution content (like older cable broadcasts) tends to reveal imperfections more noticeably on such a large screen, even with the XR processor's excellent upscaling.\nThe Sony Bravia 5 can display up to a 120Hz refresh rate with VRR and ALLM enabled, which means the TV dynamically adjusts to match the frame rate of the content being displayed. This is especially good news for gamers. With those kinds of specs, playing Fortnite on a display of this size is an electrifying experience. The Bravia 5 showed no sign of screen tearing, with exquisitely responsive gameplay.\nAlso: The best Sony TVs of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nAlready impressed by the images on this behemoth TV, I ran a few tests at the lab for dirty screen effect, burn-in, and blooming. I clocked no degradation, even close to the edges. The color test was consistent; the subtitle test yielded no visible blooming, and the scrolling text motion was liquid.\nHaving said that, viewing the Bravia 5 from side angles was not the best. It's fair to assume that, with the same build and technology in a smaller Bravia 5, this would also be the case. With a 98-inch screen, though, you probably won't get many complaints from someone sitting on the far edge of your couch. And while Sony TVs generally handle reflections well, a screen this large can still be susceptible to glare in brightly lit rooms, so strategic placement and light control are important factors. (You might consider getting some blackout curtains.)\nAlso: I changed 12 settings on my Apple TV to instantly improve the performance\nThis Mini LED TV bears a peak brightness of around 800 nits. That isn't eye-popping OLED-level brightness, but in a dark room, you might want to lower the brightness on a Bravia 5 to prevent eye strain. Trust me, the TV is plenty bright, and it can accommodate seating from any conceivable home theater.\nWhat about sound? The Sony Bravia 5 uses Sony's Acoustic Multi-Audio system, and it's worth some praise. It combines two down-firing X-Balanced speakers for bass and midrange with a pair of Sound Positioning tweeters on the top corners of the back panel to handle mids and highs. The result is a well-balanced listening experience, with clear dialogue and vocals complemented by ambient effects that fill the space nicely.\nFor the ultimate audio experience, though, the Sony Bravia 5 could use a companion soundbar to round things out. Again, if you're investing this much in a giant screen, then your budget might not be too far stretched to install a comprehensive surround sound system as well.\nAlso: This is the soundbar I recommend for deeply immersive audio - and now it's $300 off\nThe Bravia 5 has an impressive array of connectivity options, including Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 on the wireless side, and several physical ports. I really like how Sony included an infographic panel (of sorts) right next to each port to make it clear which cables go where. It comes with four HDMI ports -- one of them eARC (for that soundbar you should buy), another being 4K at 120Hz (for your online gaming needs).\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe 98-inch Sony Bravia 5 is a formidable piece of home entertainment technology. Its stunning picture quality, immersive scale, and excellent smart features make it a dream display for any cinephile or gaming enthusiast.\nGrand proportions notwithstanding, Sony's quality will shine through on any smaller-sized Bravia 5 screen. This one runs for about $5,999, whereas you can get an 85-inch Bravia 5 for less than half that price or a 75-inch for one-third the cost.\nEven if it's not about the money, not every home can accommodate a colossal 98-inch panel. So, if your home's parameters aren't suitable for something this big, you'll arguably be getting a better value by downsizing a step or two on screen size.\nIf you have the budget and space, the Bravia 5 delivers on its promise of a magnificent viewing experience. And if you're seeking the ultimate home cinema experience, pair this TV with a high-end soundbar to match the visual grandeur with equally powerful and nuanced audio.\nHow we test TVs\nWhile testing and researching the TVs featured on this list, I and other ZDNET experts kept these criteria in mind:\n- Price: Not all budgets are created equal. And if you're working with a limited budget, that shouldn't mean you have to settle for a sub-par TV.\n- Screen size: The most important factor to consider, after price, when shopping for a new TV is whether or not it will fit into your space.\n- Picture and audio quality: A new TV doesn't mean much, even if it costs an arm and a leg, if it doesn't provide a great picture and clear audio. The best TVs we test have often been ensured to support various HDR codecs, including HDR10+ and Dolby Vision, as well as enhanced audio software like Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus, and object-tracking sound.\nFor a more detailed look, check out our extensive TV testing methodology."

TCL's Nxtpaper technology offers a paper-like screen that's made for tired eyes like mine. The TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G is the company's affordable attempt at relieving some of the stress that comes from modern smartphone screens.\nAlso: Changing this Android setting instantly doubled my phone speed (Samsung and Google models included)\nIt's a unique trick for a very inexpensive smartphone that needs to be seen to be understood. While far from perfect, and definitely a device built to a price, it brings a differentiator that will matter for some users looking to give their eyes a rest while they scroll or read.\nA unique multi-faceted display\nThe display is what immediately sets the 60XE apart. TCL's Nxtpaper 3.0 matte coating gives the glass an undeniably unique finish that I quite like. On-screen content looks a bit like E-ink depending on the mode the phone is in, but underneath that hazy layer is a standard 1080p, 120Hz LCD panel.\nThe coating addresses a slew of common downsides of modern displays. It reduces blue light, cuts reflections to nearly nothing, and even eliminates most fingerprints. There's also a nice texture that feels a bit like paper, which is a nice departure from a sea of glossy, reflective displays.\nBeneath the power and volume buttons is a physical Nxtpaper Key, a plastic switch that feels a bit cheaper than I'd like. Flipping the switch offers up a menu of distinct modes that change how the display operates.\nTCL clearly wants users to notice and appreciate this feature because every toggle results in a five-second full-screen animation complete with an obnoxious serenade. I made sure to set my volume to mute so I could avoid the theatrical effect.\nEach mode provides its own twist on usability and comfort. Color Paper Mode, my favorite, mutes the colors while retaining a standard Android interface that's easier on the eyes for all-day use. I even enjoyed watching YouTube videos in this mode, though everything feels a bit flatter than my eyes are used to.\nInk Paper Mode goes one step further, stripping color from icons and text for a no-frills grayscale approach, while still delivering the full unencumbered Android experience. Max Ink Mode is the most dramatic change, stripping all color while also limiting apps to a small subset of essentials and suspending certain background processes.\nAlso: iOS 26 envy? 5 iPhone features you can already use on your Android (Samsung included)\nThe result is an ultra-minimal, battery-saving mode that can last more than a week on a single charge. I enjoyed this mode for reading ebooks and could see it as a great solution for users looking to cut back on smartphone use entirely.\nThe display does come with a major caveat. On the brightest days, the matte finish would all but wash out on-screen content, often making it unusable in direct sunlight. If you spend time outside reading or working, you'll be looking for shade like I was.\nPerformance and battery\nPerformance is modest but serviceable, with a MediaTek Dimensity 6100+ processor inside paired with 8GB of RAM. In use, this is not a phone for hardcore users who push their devices to the limit. I noticed many actions have a slight delay attached to them. Launching the camera often takes a few seconds to negotiate.\nGeneral tasks like web browsing, email, and messaging are responsive enough to keep me happy, but things never felt snappy.\nOn the software front, the 60 XE runs Android 15, with a promise from TCL of just one upgrade to Android 16 and two years of security patches. As someone who always decries the poor state of Android OS update promises, this is a weak point, and TCL needs to step up its game. Anyone hoping to get long-term value should consider other options.\nAlso: I spent a week in New York City with the Samsung Z Fold 7 - and it spoiled me the entire time\nI found battery life to be a highlight, which isn't that surprising given the 5,010mAh battery hidden inside. I routinely made it through the day with around 20-30% capacity to spare at bedtime. Wired charging tops out at a slow 18 watts, so quick daytime top-ups will take some time, but it's fine for plugging in overnight.\nFor the truly battery paranoid, there's the Max Ink Mode that considerably jumps battery life to more than a week if you are willing to cut down on much of what the phone is capable of.\nStay for the display, but not the camera\nThe plastic marble-like backplate surrounds a large circular camera array that's hard to miss and perhaps even more premium-looking than its price point. One pet peeve of mine is an off-center camera module, and this phone has a notable wobble when placed on a tabletop as a result.\nThe camera system itself is one area where the low-end cutbacks really show. The main sensor does its best outdoors in very bright conditions and needs a lot of light to help shots taken indoors. The camera performance is mediocre with soft output that lacks punch and definition most of the time.\nLow-light conditions easily demonstrate the camera system's baseline capability, and the ultrawide lens often results in grainy images. The 32MP front camera works, but that's about it. Let's just say that this is not the phone for the discerning camera buff.\nZDNET's buying advice\nWhat the TCL 60 XE Nxtpaper 5G offers is a key standout feature: a unique matte display. At $250, the 60XE offers something that you really can't find anywhere else, in this price category and beyond, and the benefits of that might matter a lot for certain users. For everyone else, consider phones like the CMF Phone 2 Pro, which offers better imaging, better speed, and its signature modular design approach.\nFollow my latest tech reviews and projects across social media.

The electronics have improved, but the basic act of operating a digital camera has remained mostly the same. Cameras are a gaggle of buttons that are a cryptic arrangement to anyone but the initiated.\nThe real innovation in the picture-taking experience has been the smartphone, which has made picture-taking an always-available tool for documenting everything with relative ease.\nThere is still an audience, however, for innovation beyond what smartphones offer. Young consumers keep buying digital cameras, and a new generation is always interested to learn more about photography as an art.\nAlso: The best vlogging cameras of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nInto the void steps lens and camera maker Sigma Corp., based in Kanagawa, Japan, just outside Tokyo. The company this spring introduced a radical redesign of the digital camera's basic mode of use.\nThe Sigma BF, as it's called, reduces the mass of buttons to a small set of touch-sensitive controls. All the functions of digital photography are still there to be experimented with and exploited -- shutter speed, lens aperture, or \"f-stop,\" and \"ISO,\" the level of light that can be recovered from a scene -- but they are under your command in a radically simplified user interface.\nI've been testing the BF for some weeks now, and I'm smitten with the changes. The hardware's design is beautiful, and the new user interface is very thoughtful. The name \"BF\" stands for \"beautiful foolishness,\" and you could say this kind of redesign is crazy, but I love it.\nA camera for a new age of photographers\nSigma, a sixty-three-year-old company, makes most of its money from lenses for all camera brands. As a result, its cameras have tended to be somewhat experimental, never selling in the same volume as Sony, Canon, or Nikon. That means that the company takes chances. Often, the results are wild and beautiful.\nThe BF is really meant for a new age of prosumers who want to up their game in photography. At a retail price of $2,199, the price is not insignificant, but it is on the low end for what you'd pay for a very good 35mm digital camera these days. Lenses, which have to be bought separately, run from about $600 for a fixed focal length \"prime\" lens to $1,300 or more for zoom lenses. The BF uses what's called an \"L-mount,\" which means you're not limited to Sigma's lenses; it's also compatible with lenses from Leica, Panasonic, Samyang, and Sirui.\nAlso: Eufy's latest security camera has AI-powered color night vision - and no monthly fees\nThe premise of stepping up your game from the smartphone camera is pretty simple, to my mind: You will never, ever, get as good a picture with any smartphone camera as you will with a camera that has a real lens. The lens is the key. The optics are just so superior to the optics on a smartphone.\nI tested the BF with a 50mm prime lens from Sigma, the same kind I already use for most of my photography.\nNo matter what you are photographing, there are immediate benefits to using a real camera versus a smartphone camera.\nOne benefit is the detail you get. Here's a picture of a butterfly landing on some vegetation in a vivarium. When cropping the image to see the butterfly up close, you'll get a level of detail that is clean rather than the murky detail you get even with a smartphone's optical zoom:\n(None of these photos have been edited. They are all straight out of the camera. In some cases, the file size has been compressed to accommodate the publishing system.)\nNot only detail but also control of the depth of field via the aperture dial on the lens provides control over the selective blurring of objects, the \"bokeh.\"\nSmartphones will give you fake bokeh that is generated in software rather than the actual bending of the light via the lens elements. Rarely will fake bokeh give you a really complex, thrilling effect where both foreground and background elements are selectively blurred, leading to a more sophisticated image, such as this cypress I snapped in New York's Central Park:\nAnd even when fake bokeh works, I don't think you'll achieve the almost holographic, floating beauty you get with a real lens while preserving all the detail of the foreground subject, as with this thistle:\nThe second advantage is that a real lens will give you more real proportions than a smartphone lens that has a lot of barrel distortion. Like a building architectural shot or this bank vault:\nYou can get a nice, crisp skyline shot at twilight as the light changes:\nA swing to simplicity\nWhere the BF departs from other cameras is in the simplicity of design and user interface.\nThe hardware is, very simply, a solid shell milled from a block of aluminum and then filled with electronics. It's a gorgeous manufactured object with a super solid feel. (Sigma cameras always feel super solid, but this is on a new level.)\nThe BF's body is one of the lightest full-frame mirrorless cameras on the market, at just under a pound, compared to devices such as the Sony a7 IV, which weighs nearly a pound and a half.\nFor non-camera users, the weight of any real camera is something of a surprise compared to a smartphone such as an Apple iPhone Pro, which weighs half a pound. Holding 15 ounces worth of an unfamiliar object prompted some people to whom I handed the BF to remark, \"It's so heavy!\"\nAlso: First look at iPhone 17 Pro? Public images seemingly confirm big design and camera changes\nThe total weight of the camera is the combination of the 15 ounces and the 12 ounces of the 50mm Sigma lens. That kind of heft is typical of full-frame lenses because they have a lot of glass inside them. (And this particular Sigma lens is not very heavy as 50-millimeter lenses go.)\nThe real adjustment for a novice photographer is getting used to the balance of weight between camera and lens versus carrying a slab of a smartphone with uniform weight distribution.\nThe camera comes in two finishes, a striking silver color and a deep black. I chose to try the black as I like to use the camera often in discreet settings such as a jazz club, so I wanted something less flashy than the silver.\nThe sensor is a full-frame, 35mm Sony chip with just under 25 megapixels, less than the 60 megapixels in some 35mm cameras. Despite a lower pixel count, I found the sensor produced rich detail, certainly enough for Instagram pictures and possibly good enough for wall-sized prints depending on the exposure. Sony is a very reliable name for sensors, so it makes sense for Sigma to go with the market leader.\nImages are stored in the internal 230-gigabyte flash memory, which I found to be more than enough for my purposes. I usually offloaded the pictures onto my iPad or MacBook after each photo-taking session via USB-C and then cleared the BF's memory.\nAlso: Why the best fix for headless server frustration might be a little box named Comet\nOn the software side, the radical simplification of the user interface is striking -- it's even something of a revelation.\nI've been a user of Sigma cameras for over a decade, my main camera these days being the Sigma fp-L, a 60-megapixel model introduced a couple of years ago. I love that camera, but I would be very happy to see the changes in the BF user interface become standard on Sigma cameras going forward.\nThe main innovation is removing a lot of shooting information from the LCD screen. Instead of seeing the aperture or shutter speed and other settings constantly on the display, each setting on the BF occupies a separate, tiny LCD -- it's called a \"status monitor\" though I tend to think of it as simply a \"mini-LCD\" -- to the right of the main display.\nA click wheel just below the mini-LCD, formally called the \"dial pad,\" reminiscent of the first Apple iPod's click wheel, lets you rotate through the values of shutter speed, etc. The changing values are displayed on the mini-LCD as you do so, and you click the center button of the click wheel to select the setting you want.\nThere's also a touch-sensitive playback button, so you can peek at what you just snapped with a soft touch, and a touch-sensitive menu button, which is a quick way to peek at the camera's settings. And a power button at the bottom of all this, of course.\nThe effect is that the main display screen is a pristine window into what you're capturing in the real world, while the mini-LCD and the click-wheel are your controls. It's a nice division that elegantly separates the gaze from the adjustments.\nThe main LCD is a 2.1 megapixel model and is terrifically responsive for things such as selecting the focus area by tapping with your finger, or using pinch and swipe when looking through the photos you've taken.\nAlso: Stanford's holographic AI glasses are coming for your clunky VR headset\nIf you half-press the shutter button, the display momentarily shows the key settings before you fully commit to the shutter release. If you press on the center button of the click-wheel, or dial pad, extra settings come up for the function that's in focus, such as shutter speed.\nStreet photography delight\nThe BF's light weight and simplified user interface made for nice street photography, one of my favorite pastimes.\nI tended to carry the camera at my waist in one hand, holding onto the lens, sometimes with the camera body flipped upside-down, with my pinky finger on the shutter button. That way, I achieved a kind of nonchalant pose that did not draw attention to my picture-taking.\nAlso: I used Google's photo-to-video AI tool on my selfie - and it made me do the tango\nSometimes, I looked at the LCD to see what I was snapping, but oftentimes, I just took a picture in the general direction to see what chance would produce.\nThe autofocus function of the BF was super fast, notably faster than the response time of the fp-L, probably because of the BF's lower-megapixel-count sensor. That made for excellent motion capture, such as this basketball game:\nOne of the BF's shortcomings is having an electronic shutter: Instead of mechanical blades opening and closing, the sensor chip controls in software when the exposure happens. The common knock against an electronic shutter is that it can lead to blurring of fast motion. In the case of the basketball game, in late afternoon daylight, I saw no issue.\nAnother potential drawback is that indoors, in artificial light, the electronic shutter can produce dark bands across the image if the shutter speed is too fast. That can require you to take the picture at a slower shutter speed. In practice, I found it not to be much of a problem.\nImproved electronics\nIn addition to autofocus speed, Sigma has done a very good job with the BF's low-light support, which was already quite good on the fp-L.\nOne of my favorite low-light picture tests is a diorama in the North American mammals hall of the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. This is one of the darkest exhibits in the museum, and it's challenging to photograph if you don't have the camera resting on a tripod to allow for a long exposure.\nAlso: Why ads are coming to your favorite AI bots and you've only got yourself to blame\nTwo taxidermy wolves run on a painted landscape of the Michigan countryside. To the naked eye, the diorama is very, very dark because it is meant to suggest nighttime on the prairie. Here's what it typically looks like, taken with minimal low-light support by the BF:\nMost museum visitors who view the diorama turn on their smartphone camera's flash to take a souvenir shot. But, to my mind, flooding the scene with flash spoils the effect.\nInstead, I cranked up the BF to its highest ISO setting, 102,400 -- fairly high up there for any digital camera. The result is that the wolves emerge in beautiful detail from the darkness -- not as sharp or clean as if the scene were well-lighted, but that's the point:\nIn practice, the BF does a very nice job in darkly lit spaces where you might actually want a picture, such as a jazz club.\nWhen set on a tripod with professional lighting and a backdrop, the BF is also excellent for formal portraits, far better than what you'll get using a smartphone camera for your headshots.\nEven without using a macro lens, the 50mm will allow you to get pretty good closeup shots of something like your favorite toy, from a minimum distance of 18 inches, which you can then crop and still have lots of vivid detail.\nOf course, you could also add a macro lens to the BF and get even closer.\nA gentle introduction to pro features\nSigma has simplified some of the functions for newbies so that the same technical effects are present but in a more inviting fashion. For example, on the Sigma fp-L, a separate button is for \"tone control\" that lets you adjust the light across the scene by degrees for shadows and highlights to make a scene have more or less contrast.\nOn the BF, there's no button for tone control, but when selecting colors with the click-wheel, you can bump up or down values of \"highlight,\" \"shadow,\" and \"fade,\" to alter the degrees of lights and darks. That works in both still images and videos.\nAlso: What Zuckerberg's 'personal superintelligence' sales pitch leaves out\nThere's also an option called \"look effect,\" where you can dial up or down how vivid or how flat a given color filter is, which is a nice, obvious way to understand making your pictures or videos more striking or more sedate.\nIn practice, the BF does a great job with tone and exposure on automatic. A street scene at sunset, for example, nicely balances the vivid highlights of the sky with the street detail without blown highlights or detail lost in the shadows.\nWhen you review photos, the main LCD display gives you all the information on the tone adjustments you made, which is helpful for determining what works and what doesn't.\nSome things that are typically buried in sub-menus on digital cameras are brought forward in the BF's UI.\nSo, for example, when filming a movie, you have the option to turn on \"constant AF,\" which does a better job of grabbing hold of a new subject entering the frame. That is now an option from the click-wheel rather than being buried as a sub-menu option.\nOf course, there are trade-offs to simplicity. Other functions that were accessed directly via dedicated buttons on digital cameras become things you have to hunt for.\nFor example, auto-exposure lock forces the camera to keep the amount of light in the scene the same as you move it, rather than altering the exposure. This allows you to find the right balance of light and dark and hold onto it while you shift your focus.\nAlso: The 10 apps I can't live or work without - on Windows, Mac, and mobile\nOn the fp-L, auto-exposure lock has its own button. In the BF, you have to move the click wheel to the exposure section of the menus and then turn on auto-exposure lock by tapping on the icon. This extra step is fine if you don't use auto-exposure lock much.\nAnother example is a feature of most digital cameras called fill light, the ability to lighten up dark parts of a picture. On most cameras, you have an option to turn on the fill light while you're taking pictures. On the BF, fill light is something you adjust after the fact by editing the DNG, \"digital negative,\" or \"RAW,\" image in the camera.\nSigma's suggestion overall is to use color and filter adjustments to achieve a similar effect to fill light. In other words, the user interface consolidates traditional operations such as fill light and auto-exposure lock into a simpler set of choices that can be more centrally manipulated.\nAnd some things are just different. On the fp-L, and most cameras, when recording a video, you can take a still image as you're recording. On the BF, if you want a still image as well, you do it when replaying the video, by selecting \"save as JPEG.\"\nHow it performs with video\nSpeaking of video, I found the results were very satisfying. You can take 6K video (6,016 x 3,384) that looks great even without electronic stabilization turned on.\nI took this shot of a woman having her personal photo shoot in front of the Plaza Hotel. Although it's jerky and not cinematic, it was a wonderful spontaneous moment in great quality:\nWhen you turn on the electronic stabilization feature, video is reduced from 6K to \"ultra-high-def\" (3,840 x 2,160) because the camera needs to crop each frame to line up frames and make the shakiness disappear.\nIn a low-light setting, such as this video at Small's jazz club in Greenwich Village, I thought it produced a wonderful-looking film without a tripod.\nHere's where we see an example of the click-wheel at its best. I had the fun of rotating through the different color filters to change up the color from moment to moment while filming, something I would never do when color choices are a single button.\nAlthough my use of the feature is rather gimmicky here, I can see all kinds of possibilities with the click wheel, enabling new ways of controlling the camera during filming.\nLike all cameras, the sound you record with the built-in microphone video is never as good as if you had a dedicated mic attached, especially for something like music. But I thought the result here was very good in a space with challenging acoustics.\nAlso: This hidden Pixel camera setting gave my photos the pop they've been missing\nEven in low light, using the camera hand-held, you can get a nice video like this one taken in a darkened tango hall. In a dark place like a dance hall, with swaying bodies moving to and fro, with the camera in your hand and no stabilization turned on, it can be challenging to capture motion in a way that's satisfying. I love what the BF did with the color and the lights in this scene while managing to shift autofocus from one couple to the next:\nBattery life\nBattery life was fine for my purposes. I got as much as six hours of shooting on a single charge, including intermittent shooting and periods of intense activity. That meant in some cases over 500 exposures in DNG+JPEG format. That's better than the official specification by Sigma for approximately 260 images on a charge. Of course, your results may vary.\nIn my experience, plugging the BF into an iPad via USB-C for forty minutes will charge the camera from zero back to a third of its battery life. You can also bring along a spare battery and swap it in via the latched compartment on the bottom of the BF.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe complaints I've seen about the Sigma BF from seasoned photographers seem to be mostly about the reduction of controls to the click wheel and the mini-LCD. Consolidating controls in that way, they argue, robs the pro photographer of their muscle memory. Some pros also wish the touch screen did more to control the functions rather than just serving as a very good display.\nAlso: I tried Google's new agentic IDE, and it blows away the popular VS Code - here's how\nIn essence, pros have a hard time adjusting to a radically simplified UI. It's a fair point of view, but this is something of a Steve Jobs moment. You have to break a few eggs to make an omelette, and you may have to break habits to reinvent how photography is done.\nI think the BF is a terrific option for a beginning photographer or even an experienced pro. The touch-screen display is intuitive in a smartphone age, the electronics are just as fast as you'd expect based on smartphone picture-taking, and the output is very Instagram-worthy.\nAnd your envious friends will immediately want to know, What is that wild-looking camera you've got?"

I'm pretty familiar with the Stealth line, having reviewed several models in the past. This version doesn't reinvent the wheel. In fact, it shares many similarities with its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI+, to its benefit and to a fault.\nAlso: The best laptops for graphic designers: Expert tested\nFirst off: on the surface, I genuinely can't tell the difference between this model and the previous generation. The Stealth 16 measures 14\"x 10.22\"x 0.85\" inches -- the exact same dimensions as the A16. It even weighs the same at 4.63 pounds.\nWhat's funny is I used to think that was really heavy, but after carrying around chunky laptops, MSI's device feels lightweight. Even with the power adapter, I didn't mind carrying it around town. By the way, I factor that adapter into the overall weight because you will need it on hand. More on that later.\nBringing back the classics\nA few other great design elements make their triumphant return. Going down the list, you have a full-size gaming keyboard. Each button has a 1.5mm travel distance, ensuring a comfortable typing feel. Six surround sound speakers are located at either end below the keyboard for immersive audio.\nOne of my favorite moments testing this laptop came from listening to \"Doomsday\" by MF Doom. The lyrical flow from Doom sounded crystal clear and powerful through the laptop's speakers, filling my entire room with his supervillainy.\nAbove the keyboard is the 16-inch OLED display. At QuadHD+ (2,560 x 1,600 pixels) resolution, it's not quite 4K, but it's close enough -- the screen still delivers impressive visual output. Colors are vibrant, the high resolution delivers detailed images, and the 240Hz refresh rate ensures smooth on-screen motion.\nPower boost\nOne of my favorite things about MSI laptops is how easy it is to tweak their performance. On many Windows 11 laptops, all you can really do is change the Power mode in the Settings, but MSI Center, its internal settings program is actually pretty robust. Here, you can adjust the computer's output on the fly. For example, enabling Extreme Performance and Discrete Graphics Mode delivers the best hardware results.\nAlso: I tested Dell's XPS successor, and it beat my $3,000 Windows laptop in almost every way\nInside my review unit was an Intel Core Ultra 9 285H, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card, and 32GB of RAM. It's a pretty good configuration, if I say so myself, and it shows in the performance numbers.\nBelow is a list comparing MSI's Stealth 16 with its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI Plus, and the Dell Premium 16. You'll notice that the newer model has better raw processing and rendering power than the others, indicating it excels at handling heavy workloads and rendering complex 3D graphics.\nThere is a bit of a gap between the Stealth 16 and the A16 on PCMark 10, suggesting that the older model has better general performance; it's able to hop between web pages and apps without much issue. However, I didn't experience any slowdown. This laptop ran great everywhere.\nPCMark 10 | Geekbench 6 | Cinebench 2024 | Cinebench R23 | |\nMSI Stealth 16 AI | 7,693 | 15,883 | 1,129 | 21,656 |\nMSI Stealth A16 AI+ | 7,913 | 14,196 | N/A | 18,336 |\nDell Premium 16 | 6,865 | 14,763 | 726 | 17,522 |\nHaving Dell's machine may seem random, but you need to understand that the Stealth 16 isn't just a solid gaming computer. It's also a powerful graphic design laptop, too. For testing, I installed Blender, a free 3D creation app, and edited images on Pixlr. I'm not much of an artist, but I did manage to create and render simple scenes starring Blender's complex monkey model.\nI had a similar experience with Pixlr, as I was able to edit 4K photographs without any major hiccups. The entire process went smoothly. MSI's laptop is a powerhouse in almost every sense of the word.\nAlso: I switched to the Dell 14 Premium for a week, and it makes even the XPS feel outdated\nAs powerful as the laptop may be, it has its limits. I ran multiple 4K YouTube livestreams as part of my usual 50-tab Chrome browser test. Everything ran fine when there were only three livestreams, although once I hit six, I noticed a slowdown. Livestreams were slow to load. It took a few seconds before the Stealth 16 could play the video as normal.\nStaying cool\nHeavy workloads do cause the Stealth 16 to heat up a bit, but high temperatures were never an issue. Heat vents are strategically placed above the keyboard, on the side of the laptop, and on the bottom, so your hands are never at risk of touching a hot keyboard. In fact, the keys stayed nice and cool the entire time. Unfortunately, this means you can't place the computer on your lap; otherwise, your legs will be blasted by hot air.\nThis ability to stay cool under duress is thanks to the Cooler Boost 5 cooling system, which consists of two large fans and five heat pipes directing hot air out through the vents. This system is also on the vastly more powerful MSI Raider 18 HX.\nUnsurprisingly, MSI's Stealth 16 is not designed to be away from its charger for long. You can push its endurance by enabling ECO-Silent and Integrated Graphics Mode in the MSI Center app, and Best Power Efficiency in Windows, but even then, it will last around six hours on a single charge, depending on what you're doing.\nLike many gaming laptops with this kind of hardware, it may have power, but it lacks in stamina. For that reason, I'd suggest this for users who don't need an all-day battery kind of laptop, but are fine with a few hour stints throughout the day.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe MSI Stealth 16 AI is on sale at Best Buy for $2,030, which is a good price for a laptop with this kind of hardware. I recommend this device to anyone looking for an affordable gaming laptop that can also be used as a work machine. If you like this laptop but want to save some cash, its predecessor, the Stealth A16 AI+, is very similar and still relevant in 2025, retailing for $1,800.\nIf you want a more powerful graphic design computer, I suggest the Alienware 18 Area-51. It is a much more powerful gaming laptop that leaves every laptop I mentioned so far in the dust. I think it's one of the best for the year. It is, however, very expensive; my review unit cost $3,200."

Over at Lenovo's website, you can purchase the laptop for as low as $1,404, a nearly 50% discount.\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- After making calculated adjustments to last year's model, Lenovo's 12th-Gen ThinkPad X1 Carbon offers a more user-friendly experience starting at $1,759 for the 32GB, 1TB configuration.\n- It sports an 8MP webcam that allows for 4K video, a stunning 2.8K display, and a slightly redesigned keyboard.\n- Despite these changes, the laptop does have some performance quirks.\nSometimes, the most impactful changes in a laptop series are small improvements made over time, as collectively, they add more to the user experience than just one big upgrade. Case in point: the 12th-generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon. The 11th-gen model from 2023 is a fantastic laptop in its own right, so I had a hard time imagining what Lenovo could do to one-up it. But I'm happy to say the company found multiple ways, beginning with the display.\nAlso: The best Lenovo laptops of 2025: Expert tested and reviewed\nSimply put, it's better than before. The 12th-Gen ThinkPad X1 Carbon has a 14-inch 2.8K resolution (2,880 x 1,800 pixels) OLED display outfitted with image-enhancing software. It supports the entirety of the DCI-P3 gamut and HDR 500, delivering bright, vivid arrays of color rivaled only by the greatest monitors. Moreover, it's covered in an anti-glare (and anti-smudge) coating, maintaining its high quality even under bright sunlight.\nAll in all, it's a very nice display, but it's not what impressed me the most. The other changes made around the screen, like the webcam, ultimately felt more impactful. It's an 8MP camera capable of shooting video in 4K resolution (3,840 x 2160 pixels), with a lens housed inside a large finger tab jutting out from the top. You'll look great in video calls on this camera, even in bad lighting scenarios.\nThis ridge has two effects: one, it lets you easily open the lid with a single finger, and two, it enables smaller bezels. Shrinking the bezels allowed Lenovo to increase the surface area of the ThinkPad display, giving it the appearance of a bigger screen despite being 14 inches on both the 11th and 12th-Gen models. This is a perfect example of a small change that makes a big difference.\nAlso: This $95 Lenovo tablet is fantastic for mobile entertainment - and I'm tempted to buy two\nThe keyboard has not changed much compared to the older devices. It's covered in a matte-like material that's smooth to the touch, and each key has a slight indentation that alleviates hand stress when typing. But when I looked closer, I began to see the tiny tweaks.\nFor starters, the FN and Ctrl keys have switched places, falling in line with mainstream keyboard layouts (and reducing the chance that you'll hit the wrong button). Additionally, Lenovo placed more tactile bumps near the FN and Enter keys for easier touch typing. The Page Up and Page Down keys have different shapes, so you can tell where they are, and the arrow keys are located with a slight touch. The fingerprint reader stands out from the crowd thanks to its new glassy covering.\nLike other ThinkPads, the second-generation Lenovo ThinkPad Z13 also has a TrackPoint between the G, H, and B keys. What's interesting about it is that double-tapping it opens a floating toolbar, giving you quick access to some of the ThinkPad tools, like the microphone and Voice Typing.\nAlso: This Lenovo ThinkPad gets my recommendation for remote workers - and it's on sale\nBefore I forget, I should mention the trackpad because it has its fair share of improvements. For starters, it's bigger now, measuring 4.72 inches across. Above it are three buttons that function similarly to those found on a mouse. Personally, I prefer using these over pressing down on the trackpad as they offer better haptic feedback and a satisfying \"click.\" You can still push down on the trackpad itself, but it's a lot more mushy. It all comes down to preference, and if you prefer having the haptic feedback on the trackpad itself, you may feel a touch disappointed.\nMy review unit came with the Intel Core Ultra 7 155H processor, which allowed the laptop to work really well for the majority of the time. I was able to have multiple windows and tabs open at the same time without having a major performance drop. However, I did experience a performance drop when I tried waking up the ThinkPad and opening Google Chrome. The laptop would sometimes take an abnormally long time to wake up or launch an app to the point where I worried I had broken something.\nAlso: Why this Lenovo Yoga is my pick for best MacBook Air alternative (and it's $300 off)\nThese problems extended to the battery, too. I performed my usual battery test of playing a 720p YouTube video non-stop at 50 % brightness to see how long it lasts. I do this to simulate an average day of work. On battery saver, the ThinkPad X1 Carbon lasted around five hours before dying. That's not very long. With the quirky performance in mind, all this leads me to believe that the ThinkPad's hardware isn't well optimized.\nZDNET's buying advice\nI would recommend the 12th-generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon to just about everyone: casual users, professionals, programmers, and creators. There are a myriad of different ThinkPads out there, but this one stands out for its thoughtful attention to detail and improved design. Like all ThinkPads, it's durable, utilitarian, and light enough to commute to and from the office with. If you're someone who takes a lot of video calls, you'll love the webcam.\nYou can choose a few different configurations for this machine, which will raise or lower its price. The base model normally retails for $2,649, but it does go on sale.\nWhat are the tariffs in the US?\nThe recent US tariffs on imports from countries like China, Vietnam, and India aim to boost domestic manufacturing but are likely to drive up prices on consumer electronics. Products like smartphones, laptops, and TVs may become more expensive as companies rethink global supply chains and weigh the cost of shifting production.\nCNET: Tariff Pricing Tracker: We're Watching 11 Products You Might Need to Buy\nLaptops and PCs are also hit hard by the new US tariffs, with import duties potentially increasing prices by up to 35%. Many major brands still rely on Chinese and Vietnamese factories for assembly, meaning consumers could soon pay significantly more for everything from budget Chromebooks to high-end gaming rigs.\nThese tariffs may accelerate efforts to move production to regions like Mexico or India, but shoppers can expect higher costs and fewer discounts in the short term."

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nI answered the million-dollar question about buying laptops - here's the ultimate guide\nChoosing the right laptop can feel overwhelming -- even for someone like me who's lived and breathed laptops for years. You get all these options, configurations, and feature lists that it's impossible not to know up from down. So, to make things easier for you, I'll be breaking down laptops and their essentials using three broad usage categories: school, work, and gaming.\nAlso: The best laptops you can buy: Expert tested\nMost laptops fall into one of these buckets, and while there is some crossover regarding hardware, each type is designed with a specific purpose in mind. Below, I walk through what defines each category, highlighting key features to look out for and providing example products along the way.\nKeep in mind, this advice is based on my own experience and expertise. Ultimately, the best laptop is the one that fits your needs best.\nHow to pick a laptop for school\nWhen choosing a school laptop, you'll want to focus on two things: battery life and durability. Students should get something that can last through a full day of classes and afternoon study sessions. Ideally, look for laptops capable of running for 12 hours or more. I also recommend a sturdy 13- or 14-inch laptop that's lightweight but tough enough to handle the occasional bump or drop.\nAlso: The Dell laptop I recommend to most college students is $350 off at Best Buy\nPerformance is secondary, especially if you're going to be using it for writing papers and browsing the web. They're not built for heavy tasks like 3D rendering or gaming (although lightweight titles like \"League of Legends\" after class will run on almost anything).\nOne great school laptop is the Dell Inspiron 14 Plus, which offers up to 21 hours of battery life, solid performance from the Snapdragon X Plus chipset, and a vibrant Quad HD display -- all for about $600.\nIf you like a fast and efficient Chromebook, the Lenovo Chromebook Plus has a gorgeous 2K OLED touchscreen display and marathon battery life -- ideal for students who work out of Google's suite of apps.\nAnother solid pick is going with a refurbished laptop like the M1 MacBook Air, currently down to $599 at Walmart. The M1 MacBook Air's thin and light frame might not be durable enough for everyone, but it definitely is easy to carry around.\nHow to pick a laptop for work\nWork laptops cover a wide range of devices, but one thing is true for all of them: they need to be powerful. Unlike school laptops, work computers need to be able to handle more demanding tasks like video conferencing, video editing, software programming, data analysis, and graphic design.\nAlso: One of my favorite budget OLED laptops for work just got even more affordable\nSo, start by looking for laptops with more powerful processors like Intel's \"Lunar Lake\" chip or a CPU from AMD's Ryzen AI 300 series. These are the companies' latest chipsets built for demanding workloads. A good example of such a device is the Lenovo ThinkPad X9 Aura Edition, an ultraportable laptop powered by the Intel Core Ultra 7 258V processor that we really love.\nIf the ThinkPad isn't your style, there are plenty of alternatives. Want a larger screen and top-tier power? Check out the Dell Premium 16. It has a stunning 4K touchscreen and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070, which is a fantastic graphics card for 3D rendering.\nOr maybe you want a laptop that can handle high-quality video calls? I recommend the HP EliteBook Ultra G1i. It has a 9MP webcam capable of 1440p video. The 2.8K OLED display with 120Hz refresh rate offers a premium experience, with solid hardware to support it.\nHow to pick a gaming laptop\nWhen it comes to gaming laptops, the two most important factors are performance and display. Don't worry too much about battery life -- these machines are power-hungry by design and, speaking from personal experience, they won't last unplugged for long.\nStrong performance is crucial for smooth gameplay, so you'll want a device with competitive hardware for an immersive experience without graphical issues and slowdowns. I recommend opting for gaming laptops carrying an RTX 50-series graphics card, however, older-gen components still definitely hold up in 2025.\nAlso: I recommend this Windows laptop to creatives and professionals - even if it's meant for gamers\nFor displays, I prioritize high refresh rates over high resolutions. A 120Hz refresh rate, for example, delivers smoother visuals, less motion blur, and lower input lag than a 60Hz screen. And you need that speed for competitive play. I'm perfectly satisfied with a simple 1080 display, but if you want the best, there are plenty of 1440p and 4K options out there -- just be prepared to pay a premium for them.\nThe downside to all this powerful hardware is that they generate a lot of heat, and high temperatures kill laptops. Brands have been putting a lot of effort into the cooling systems of their gaming laptops. The problem here is that computers with robust cooling are very expensive. If cost is an issue, I recommend buying a laptop cooling pad.\nI've tested a lot of gaming laptops in recent months, and my favorite, without a doubt, has been the Alienware 18 Area-51. It performs incredibly well, has a vibrant display, and a sleek design, with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 GPU. Just keep in mind that weighs nearly 10 pounds.\nAnother fantastic option is Lenovo's Legion Pro 7i -- a 16-inch gaming behemoth with everything you'd want in a gaming rig: a brilliant 16-inch 240Hz OLED display, 32GB of RAM, (upgradable to 96GB), and a 24-core Intel Core Ultra 9 processor with Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080. Not to mention some sweet RGB lighting.\nIf you're looking for something a little more low-key, Asus' ROG Zephyrus G14 brings a smaller, lighter form factor to the game. You've got an AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS CPU and Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 along wth 16GB of memory and a gorgeous 14-inch OLED display. Plus, while you're not gaming, this laptop looks a lot more like something you could take to the office.\nIs there a laptop that can do all three?\nAs a matter of fact, yes. While specialized laptops can do one thing really well, there are definitely versatile models out there that can do a little bit of everything.\nIt goes without saying that the MacBook Pro M4 makes for a fantastic laptop for work, school, or gaming. Gaming on a Mac has blown up over the last few years, with support for more games, and better performance thanks to MetalFX upscaling and support for ray tracing. When it comes to work and school, the MacOS 26 ecosystem is unrivaled for productivity, creative tasks, and integration within Apple's ecosystem of products.\nAnother versatile laptop is the new Dell 14 Plus, released earlier this year. It's not going to compete with the gaming laptops on this list when it comes to the latest titles, but if you're a casual gamer who likes to play some \"League\" every now and then, this laptop's Intel Core Ultra 7 or 9 processor and up to 32GB of RAM carry some solid performance. Plus, it's competitively-priced at just around $1,000.\nLastly, another affordable option that's versatile enough for most purposes is the Acer Swift 16 AI. This thin, light, and battery-efficient laptop has a gorgeous 3K OLED display at 120Hz and commendable power under the hood: an Intel Core Ultra 7 or 9 \"Lunar Lake\" processor. It's great in the office, light and efficient enough for school, and can handle a variety of games.\nWhy should you trust me?\nI've been writing about both software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years now, and in that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office, and the backyard. The remote experience has made me extremely selective about what I make as my main computer, as I want to make sure the devices I use are able to handle my day-to-day tasks. I'm on my computers all day, practically every day of the week.\nAlso: Is a refurbished MacBook worth it? I did the math, and here's my buying advice\nI'm also at a point where I've tried just about every type of laptop on the market. I know what makes laptops from key categories worthwhile purchases -- and which are best left alone.\nThe advice that I have given are not hard and fast rules. They just aim to provide a foundation of what you should look for in a laptop. Like I always say, what is best for you depends on your needs."

It is nearly identical to its predecessor in terms of design and purpose, as the laptop is meant for creative professionals looking for a high-performance machine. It sticks with what worked last time, making a few key adjustments.\nAlso: The best laptops for graphic designers: Expert tested\nFirst off, the ProArt P16 has a lightweight physical design, making it easy to carry around. I found the keyboard to be too mushy for my liking. It doesn't have a great typing feel, but the keycaps are quiet, so that's a plus. The touchpad takes up a large portion of the wrist rest, enabling better comfort and ease of use. On either side of the keyboard is a pair of Harman/Kardon speakers delivering strong audio output.\nSo far, things are looking good for the ProArt P16, and things get even better once you look inside.\nA creative powerhouse\nMy review unit came loaded with some solid hardware, indeed. It houses an AMD Ryzen AI HX 370 processor, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 graphics card, and 32GB of RAM. Yes, you can game this; no, I don't recommend doing so. It overheats fast, and the display only has a refresh rate of 60Hz. Large heat vents are located at the bottom, expelling hot air. I do not recommend placing the computer on your lap unless you want your legs to be cooked.\nAlso: Finally, an ultraportable Windows laptop I'd use at the office (even though it's for gamers)\nAsus' ProCreator Hub greatly contributed to my enjoyment, and it reminded me of MSI's Center app, which has a similar function. The app has various laptop features in one central location, one being the ability to instantly change how the device performs without having to go into BIOS. By making the right adjustments to the hardware, the ProArt P16 can exceed expectations for performance and battery life.\nBelow is a benchmark test results table comparing the 2025 ProArt P16 to its predecessor, as well as the M4 MacBook Pro and the MSI Stealth 16 AI, another laptop with a similar purpose. You'll notice that Asus' new machine outperforms most of its rivals across the various benchmark rendering tests. There are instances where it falls behind, but it isn't a large gap.\nIf you're looking for a powerful alternative to your old MacBook, this ProArt laptop is your best bet in 2025.\nCinebench 24 MC | Geekbench 6.2.2 SC | Geekbench 6.2.2 MC | |\nAsus ProArt P16 (2025) | 1,211 | 2,896 | 15,194 |\nApple MacBook Pro M4 | 906 | 3,823 | 14,849 |\nAsus ProArt P16 (2024) | 1,096 | 2,904 | 12,787 |\nMSI Stealth 16 AI | 1,129 | 2,687 | 15,883 |\nThe Creator Hub offers utility beyond tweaking performance. The WorkSmart tool lets you group multiple apps together. So when you click one of these groups, all those apps open simultaneously, saving you time. Color Control allows users to actively adjust the screen output on the fly. For example, you could tweak the blue light output so it's easier on your eyes or change which color gamut is being shown.\nYou might change the gamut to DCI-P3 to show off \"movie-grade colors\". Display P3 is best \"suited for displaying vivid colors on mobile devices and laptops.\" You don't have to mess with the output, since the screen is impressive on its own. Asus' ProArt P16 has a high-quality 16-inch 4K OLED display. Images are stunning as colors practically leap out. The screen had two downsides: the 60Hz refresh rate, as mentioned earlier, and the display's glossiness. So much light is reflected that it can be hard to see the screen under bright conditions.\nEditing on the ProArt P16\nUp in the upper left-hand corner of the touchpad is the DialPad, which allows you to customize your own controls in each app. The physical design offers more precise control than the touchpad, which makes cycling through different tools easier than you'd assume.\nI tried incorporating the DialPad into my workflow to edit a video on CapCut, a photograph on Pixlr, and render 3D models in Blender using the DialPad, and found out that it's best used in conjunction with the touchpad. It works best as an supplemental tool for quick access to change brush sizes or cycling through video clips, but it isn't designed to replace the touchpad or mouse altogether.\nAlone, it's great at executing delicate procedures, like cleaning up specific areas in a photo. The problem is that it lacks haptic feedback: pressing down doesn't result in the \"click\" you'd expect. So to click and drag an effect on a video's timeline or grab the corner of a model in Blender, you'll have to use the touchpad.\nFortunately, using both simultaneously isn't difficult. Your left hand can be the DialPad while your right is on the touchpad, and it all feels natural. Using just the touchpad is an option, but it's difficult to maintain the same level of accuracy.\nAlso: This ultraportable Asus laptop is my favorite MacBook Air alternative (and it's better in some ways)\nI also have to give credit to the hardware. Rendering 3D environments in Blender took very little time to complete. I was able to hop between my 4K editing and 20 different Chrome tabs without any hiccups. The only time I experienced any slowdown was when I was playing 10 different livestreams in 4K on YouTube -- but apart from niche cases, it's solid.\nZDNET's buying advice\nOver at Best Buy, the Asus ProArt P16 is on sale for $2,500, which is more than what I was expecting. Last year's ProArt is retailing for just $2,000. I recommend grabbing the 2025 laptop if you want the best of the best and don't mind paying a bit more. As shown in the performance tests, there is a sizable gap between the two devices.\nThat said, the 2024 version is definitely still competitive, so if you're looking for a powerful graphics-minded laptop and want to save some money, I'd highly recommend it, especially if it sees some additional price drops."

There's no TrackPoint, a noticeable lack of I/O, and a minimalist trackpad that looks nothing like the X1 Carbon -- its (significantly more expensive) older sibling.\nNow that I've been using it for several weeks, it's become one of my favorite laptops of the year for its versatility, brilliant display, and fantastic battery. In a sense, the X9 Aura Edition is a ThinkPad that has evolved to a new form, keeping some of what we love about the iconic lineup but elaborating on a new vision, as well.\nAlso: This 16-inch Dell laptop is a worthy rival to the MacBook Pro - and it's better in a few ways\nBut I should also mention that there is some friction here. First, if you're a ThinkPad enthusiast, it's easy to feel like Lenovo is abandoning the line's core features, but the X9 Aura Edition seems to be more of an experiment than a sweeping redefinition of the flagship family.\nThere's an obvious resemblance to the MacBook, and the Aura Edition features are definitely engineered to speak to the Apple user (or refugee). I've covered them extensively since the tap-to-share functionality spurred hordes of participants to slam their smartphones against the first Aura Edition laptops last year, and they're all still here, but more like bonus features rather than flagship headliners.\nAlso: The Lenovo ThinkPad I recommend to most hybrid workers has an impressive spec list\nBesides photo and file sharing capabilities designed to mirror Apple's AirDrop experience, Aura Edition laptops come with additional security features and 24/7 live chat support that allows Lenovo reps to see your device's exact specs, focus modes, battery usage profiles, and health alerts in the Intel Unison app.\nUltimately, though, the X9 is a ThinkPad, even though it doesn't look the part. Its price point positions it as a mid-tier+ device with a sleek, forward-thinking design and is notably more affordable than the X1 Carbon. The ThinkPad reigns supreme at the top in both hardware and performance.\nThe X9 Aura Edition's physical frame is sleek and thin, but it feels solid and well-made. It has a cool slate gray colorway and a ribbed bottom half of the clamshell. One of the first things you'll notice is the big bar running alongside the bottom of the device.\nLenovo calls this the \"engine hub,\" and it's where the two USB-C ports (one on each side), the HDMI port, and the headphone jack reside \u2013 an interesting design idea that consolidates I/O in a separate unit from the chassis.\nAlso: The best Lenovo laptops\nThe other thing you'll notice is the gorgeous OLED display, which is glossy but very efficient at mitigating glare and reflections. In fact, it's significantly better than the MacBook Air M4 (which doesn't come with Apple's nano-texture display) -- night and day when positioned side by side.\nThe integrated Intel Arc 130V GPU, combined with the 2.8K, 500nit 120Hz refresh rate display, makes for a gorgeous visual experience, whether gaming or spreadsheet surfing.\nBut this is still a ThinkPad, and it's well-positioned as a work machine. The redesigned keyboard utilizes newly designed, positively silent keys and a large haptic trackpad that replaces the usual right and left click buttons for a precise and minimal glass pad positioned right in the center of the device.\nThe 1080p webcam is also quite good, a relief for users who spend a lot of time in meetings. It's not exactly the 12MP sensor found on the M4 MacBook Air (which I've already argued is the best videoconferencing experience on a laptop this year), but it blows the 720p webcam on other ThinkPads like the E14 Gen 6 out of the water, offering a practical middle ground for the price.\nAlso: Why I recommend this budget Lenovo ThinkPad over laptops that cost twice the price\nPortability with the hybrid worker in mind is the general theme here, and this continues with the core hardware on the X9, which is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 5 or 7 (Series 2) processor, standard fare for a lightweight and affordable laptop in this price range.\nNow, let's talk about the battery life, which comes just shy of other flagship devices with Intel's \"Lunar Lake\"-series chips I've reviewed, like the Asus Zenbook S 14 and the Dell XPS 13. I got over 13 hours of battery life during my testing of this device, which, compared to the Zenbook (17 hours) and XPS 13 (16 hours), is the outlier. But keeping the big picture in mind, it is enough to last the entire work day.\nThe other thing I have to call out is that the X9 Aura Edition is certainly not the coolest-running laptop in the recent lineup of Lunar Lake devices or even Lenovo's latest ThinkPads. During heavy workloads, I found palpable heat generation along the bottom of the device near the engine hub.\nAlso: How to clear the cache on your Windows 11 PC (and why you shouldn't wait to do it)\nIn terms of pricing, there are some things to note here. The starting configuration with the Intel Core Ultra 5 comes with just 256GB of storage for $1,226. I understand that for users who live in the cloud, vast amounts of on-device storage aren't needed, but this is some of the lowest I've seen for a device in this price range.\nAdditionally, the version with a 1TB SSD, Intel Core Ultra 7, and 32GB of memory starts at $1,989, putting it on par with the Dell XPS 13, which features the same amount of RAM and storage but a more powerful Intel Core Ultra 9 CPU for a slightly cheaper price.\nThis isn't a deal-breaker or necessarily unusual for a high-design, experimental device that exists to break a mold, but it's certainly something consumers should be aware of. Basically, you have to be committed to the design here, as it's possible to get a little more for less elsewhere.\nThat being said, for all the reasons mentioned above, there's a lot to love, especially if you're attracted to the bold design, durable form factor, and gorgeous display.\nZDNET's buying advice\nUltimately, Lenovo's ThinkPad X9 14 Aura Edition is a sleek, gorgeous device that's a joy to use. The brilliant OLED display, redesigned keyboard, precise haptic trackpad, and experimental form factor result in a statement-making laptop with the hardware to back it up.\nIn terms of pricing, hardware, and targeted demographic, I would put Lenovo's X9 14 Aura Edition in the same ballpark as the Asus Zenbook S 14 and Dell XPS 13, two other \"Lunar Lake\" devices with a bold design streak.\nThe X9 stands apart, however, with a more down-to-business aesthetic and bearing the name of one of the most respected laptop families on the market. Despite the on-device storage being lower than I would expect for this laptop, I'd still recommend it for folks who work in the cloud, want a premium user experience, and prioritize a high-quality webcam."

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nI switched to the Dell 14 Premium for two weeks, and it made my XPS laptop look bad\nDell 14 Premium\nZDNET's key takeaways\n- Dell's latest high-performance laptop is currently on sale starting at $1,500.\n- It's superbly designed, with a sleek, modern build and powerful, but accessible, hardware.\n- It runs warm, and requires power management from the user to get the most out of the battery.\nDell's laptop rebrand may have resulted in some shuffling around of naming conventions, but the new Dell 14 Premium -- Dell's refreshed high-performance line of laptops -- looks a whole lot like the Dell XPS upon first glance.\nIf you're confused about this laptop's placement in Dell's product placement hierarchy, it's in the consumer category, and the highest-tier model in that group. This makes it a premium, but accessible, laptop for pro creatives, designers, and tech enthusiasts.\nAlso: I tested the Dell XPS' successor - here are the biggest upgrades (and what's the same)\nFrom the zero-lattice keyboard to the edge-to-edge OLED display and invisible trackpad, the Dell 14 Premium lives up to its name with a sleek, future-facing build. When sitting on a table, it gives the impression that it's hovering above the surface because of its clever recessed design.\nAppearances aside, Dell wants to emphasize that this laptop is not an XPS, but rather an evolution of the line into something new. The idea here was to take what worked on its high-end machines and improve on the things that users saw as pain points, and it does that to some degree, despite obvious comparisons it to its predecessor.\nIn terms of hardware, the Dell 14 Premium comes with the Intel Core Ultra 7 255H \"Lunar Lake\" processor, up to 32GB of LPDDR5X, 8400MT/s dual-channel RAM, and either an Intel Arc Graphics or Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 GPU.\nOpting for the 32GB of RAM and OLED display will bring the price up to $2,250 -- the upper limit of what could be considered \"accessible\" for a premium-tier laptop.\nThe review unit I tested had a different CPU than the retail version: an Intel Core Ultra 7 265H, available for consumers as a special order, but not standard on the machine. This resulted in a very slight performance boost compared to the retail version (a performance-core base clock speed of 2.2GHz vs the standard 2.0GHz).\nThe 14-inch OLED touchscreen is as gorgeous as you'd expect, with a 3.2K resolution, 400nit brightness, and variable refresh rate up to 120Hz. The display's thin bezels and seamless webcam module result in a clean and crisp design that gives the impression the screen is bigger than it is.\nAlso: This 16-inch Acer is a full-package value pick I'd happily replace my main laptop with\nAll in all, it's a gorgeous laptop. The keyboard looks fantastic, but there are some usability trade-offs associated with its design. The first being that, while it has good key travel, it doesn't feel as expressly ergonomic as some other laptops' keyboards like the HP EliteBook X G1a or even the Acer Swift 16 AI. If you're a fast typer, you may need some time to acclimate to the key layout here, as some might perceive it as a little cramped.\nThe LED function key row is also another thing that sacrifices usability for aesthetics. In previous reviews for the XPS, I've expressed my lukewarm reception for the feature, and it remains the same here. Personally, I find the always-on lighting a little distracting, but after a week with the laptop, I will say I've acclimated to it.\nThe invisible haptic trackpad is one of the most premium elements of the laptop's design. The texture is unlike any other laptop I've felt, with a smooth, silky texture that feels luxe. The haptic clicks are very subtle, requiring very little finger movement, allowing the user to glide across the surface unhindered by the trackpad's boundaries. This is a design trick, as the trackpad itself isn't necessarily larger than standard, but definitely feels as such.\nThis design does raise some concerns about durability, however, since this single glass sheet looks great, but a scratch or dent would mar the otherwise pristine surface. Luckily, Dell emphasizes its durability, saying it can withstand up to 1,200 drops.\nCompared to the XPS, port selection is streamlined with a little more options. You get three Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports (instead of two), an audio jack, and a microSD card slot. This is a welcome improvement that pushes the device firmly into pro creator territory and adds to the laptop's longevity, something I'm glad Dell decided to compromise on for the Premium line.\nAlso: Why I recommend this Asus laptop over the MacBook Pro to creators and professionals\nThe RTX 4050, while a competitive GPU, is limited to 30 watts of TDP (thermal design power) in the Dell 14 Premium, which puts a cap on its performance. The constraints of this laptop's cooling system is evident during extended, demanding workflows, when the device warms up and stays that way.\nThat being said, during everyday tasks, the laptop runs cool and quiet, and the 4050's performance delivers for video editing, photo rendering, and even gaming, but demanding workloads quickly raise the temperature, which is particularly felt on the wrist rest and keyboard.\nThe GPU here performs well for most games, but it's not particularly optimized for PC gaming because of said heat generation, and the laptop's design, which gets in the way of some gaming practicality. Specifically the LED function row, which, if you're playing a game that uses F1 keys, will need to be reconfigured.\nInstead of pounding at the keyboard, it's better suited toward video editing and graphic design, with multiple ports for connecting to an external monitor, hooking up peripherals, and utilizing the 32GB of RAM for large file transfers with the included microSD slot.\nFor that reason, I'd position this laptop more in the realm of pro creators and business realm than a gaming laptop, despite its ability to run games because of the 32GB of RAM and RTX 4050 GPU.\nSpeaking of, let's touch on the battery life here. This is a laptop that greatly benefits from active power management, as you'll want to be mindful of consumption to get the most out of the 69.5Whr battery.\nAlso: Dell's new Pro Max lineup offers top-tier laptops for sky-high prices\nDuring my testing, I found that the Dell 14 Premium responds to battery life in a way that parallels the heat generation. During everyday use: web browsing, productivity software, and multitasking across applications, battery life is very good, lasting to the eight hour mark and beyond. But once you shift gears to more demanding workflows, that battery life starts to drop off.\nYou'll get less than that if you're working on more power-hungry tasks and five hours or less if you stay in performance mode. For these reasons, I would say this is a laptop that requires some mindfulness of use, as opposed to a light and breezy device you can keep untethered from the charger and forget about.\nLastly, while we're on the topic, even though this laptop is sleek and compact, it weighs 3.66 pounds for the LCD display, and 3.79 for the OLED. This is by no means the heaviest laptop on the block, but a testament to its design for weighing more than it looks.\nZDNET's buying advice\nThe Dell 14 Premium lives up to its name as an aesthetic laptop that's committed to its future-forward design. This isn't a laptop that's made for everyone, and that's fine. Dell has successfully improved on elements of its design that don't compromise its vision with the expanded port selection and balance of hardware and cost.\nAs the highest-performing laptop in Dell's base tier of laptops, it's a premium, but accessible, machine that's well-suited toward professionals who need a balanced approach to performance. The luxe physical design makes a statement and is a joy to use, but users will need to be mindful of the hardware's power demands and heat generation."

If you see inaccuracies in our content, please report the mistake via this form.\nI've tested dozens of ThinkPads: Here's the Lenovo model I keep coming back to\nLenovo's 10th-generation ThinkPad X1 2-in-1 Aura Edition is a business-minded laptop with a few design perks to differentiate it from the crowd. We're talking a convertible form factor, pen support, ample I/O, and fantastic battery life to punctuate its identity as a portable device for the office.\nAlso: How to clear the cache on your Windows 11 PC (and why you shouldn't wait to do it)\nThe Aura Edition moniker comes from its Intel Core Ultra 5 or 7 Lunar Lake processor on board, and the core component behind its efficient battery life. Almost all of the Lunar Lake devices we've tested over the past year deliver impressive longevity, and the ThinkPad X1 is no exception.\nThis makes it a reliable laptop for common office tasks: booting up immediately, easy multitasking, and jumping between a dozen or more browser tabs, each loaded with spreadsheets and documents. However, the starting price of $2,400 places it in a premium category that won't win over everyone.\nAs with any ThinkPad, multiple configurations are available at the point of sale, ranging from 16GB to 32GB of RAM paired with the Intel Core Ultra 5 226V, Core Ultra 7 258V, or Core Ultra 7 268V Pro. Notably, its PCIe Gen4 SSD only comes with up to 512GB of storage.\nThe processor powers Intel's AI Boost with up to 47 TOPS, and pairs with the Intel Arc GPU on Xe2 architecture. The \"Aura Edition\" also includes a handful of Intel-specific software that I've touched on, and like any proprietary software, will be useful for some consumers and largely ignored by others.\nOne of the most useful features of the Aura Edition is Smart Share, powered by the Intel Unison app, which provides a user-friendly way to \"Airdrop\" files and images from your smartphone to your device and vice versa. Unfortunately, Intel is discontinuing this feature in the summer of 2025.\nIt also comes preloaded with Lenovo's \"AI Now\", an AI-powered assistant with a local chat option, cloud chat, and PC assistant. The cloud chat connects to an online LLM that provides some limited, if acceptable responses. But the local chat and PC assistant features did not work for even the simplest requests. Note that it's still in Beta.\nAlso: My favorite PC accessory keeps me productive on the go - and it's 50% off\nMoving to the laptop's physical build, it stays true to the classic ThinkPad design with the triple-button trackpad and the red TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard. The 85% PCC plastic keys are crisp and responsive, with a rough, matte texture that thoroughly resist fingerprints and are nice to type on. The trackpad is equally comfy -- with a haptic option -- and is utterly silent.\nThe speaker placement under the keyboard prevents the muffled effect that can sometimes happen with downward-firing speakers. Since this is a 2-in-1, when it's in tent form, sound is projected outward, which is better than speakers facing inward toward the back of the display, in my opinion.\nThe 14-inch, matte WUXGA (1920 x 1200) display also resists fingerprints quite well when illuminated, keeping with its professional physical appearance. The real reason behind this design, however, is its anti-glare abilities; a must for anyone beneath the persistent fluorescent glare of overhead office lighting.\nAlso: Ready to ditch Windows? 'End of 10' makes converting your PC to Linux easier than ever\nIt does so incredibly well, with almost no visible reflections at all. This, combined with the 60Hz refresh rate and max 500nit brightness, makes for a screen that looks good but is particularly power-efficient. You can opt for an OLED on this laptop, but doing so will reduce the battery life.\nOn that note, let's talk about the battery on this thing. Like other Lunar Lake laptops, I found it to have an absolutely marathon battery life, scoring over 21 hours of life in our video battery test over Wi-Fi at half brightness. Battery tests, like benchmarking, are not always representative of real-world performance, but this is an impressive number, ranking it as one of the longest-lasting laptops I've tested.\nSwapping to different performance profiles will give you more or less battery, but with sustained use, demanding workloads, and multiple video calls, you'll easily get a full day's worth of work on one charge. I took this laptop into the office multiple days in a row and regularly made it to around 30-40% each day.\nFor videoconferencing, the 1080p webcam provides a smooth, crisp image and includes a very subtle physical camera shutter at the top above the lens, a nice feature for consumers who are constantly hopping in and out of calls. Similarly, the mic quality is consistent and good.\nThe biggest drawback is the laptop's price, which puts it in direct competition with proven powerhouses like the MacBook Pro M4 or Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Carbon, which has double the RAM and storage capacity.\nAlso: This compact Windows PC outperforms the M4 Mac Mini in key areas - and it's on sale\nLenovo certainly succeeds in its intent, however: a premium business laptop with a marathon battery and reliable, snappy office performance. The ThinkPad X1 Aura Edition is a capable 2-in-1 with a smart set of features, but its price puts it up against some tough competition.\nZDNET's buying advice\nI'd recommend the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 2-in-1 Aura Edition to consumers who are already ThinkPad loyalists and want the reliability and performance of that lineup, as well as the fantastic battery life of Lunar Lake.\nIf you're a hybrid worker and want to commute without worrying about a charger, this is a fantastic choice. If you're looking for a laptop that's more geared towards creative workloads, there are other options in this price bracket, like the MacBook Air M4 or the HP EliteBook X G1a."
