  "title": "International group accuses major nations of withholding more than $400 million in life-saving funds: 'Every delay means ... more lives lost'",
  "description": "\"This should not be part of any criteria.\"",
  "content": "Developing countries are calling out wealthy nations for not following through on their promises to deliver climate damage aid.\n\nAs Climate Home News reported, rich countries pledged $789 million to the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage two years ago. However, they have collectively paid only $348 million so far, with no indication of when the remainder will be distributed.\n\nWhat is climate loss and damage funding?\n\nThe Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage addresses vulnerable communities' needs in developing nations that have been devastated by weather events fueled by the changing climate. The fund helps pay for initiatives to help these communities recover from extreme storms, rising sea levels, and other climate-related crises.\n\nA 26-member board oversees the fund, with 14 members serving from developing countries and 12 from wealthier nations.\n\nNations established the fund at the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference and operationalized it at the 2023 conference. The fund received initial pledges from 28 countries, 22 of which have signed contribution agreements.\n\nNations with the largest gaps between pledging money and delivering it include Italy, the United Arab Emirates, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Sweden.\n\nWhy is funding essential for victims of the changing climate?\n\nA 2024 study assessed that the changing climate causes approximately $395 billion in losses and damages annually. Developing countries bear the brunt of that financial burden because they lack the resources to rebuild after natural disasters.\n\nThere's no denying that addressing the effects of the changing climate is expensive. However, not addressing the devastating impacts as early as possible will result in greater costs in the long run.\n\nWith multiyear disbursement schedules rather than full upfront payments, the fund's board isn't able to spend the money effectively and where it's most needed.\n\nThere is a lack of predictability and transparency surrounding the delayed payments, too. The funds available aren't enough to complete proposed repair projects, leading the board to consider seeking private-sector financing.\n\nHowever, some board members, including Egypt's Mohamed Nasr, oppose leveraging private money because the fund's purpose is to help people suffering from the climate crisis \u2014 not provide investment opportunities.\n\n\"This should not be part of any criteria when we deal with loss and damage funding,\" Nasr said, per Climate Home News.\n\nPhilippines President Ferdinand Marcos emphasized the urgency of receiving these funds and said, \"Every delay means more families without shelter, more livelihood disrupted and worse \u2014 more lives lost.\"\n\nDespite the slow movement of funds, the board is still expecting to approve its first climate projects by early next year. There will be a call for proposals in October, and first approvals will be granted in February, according to Climate Home News.\n\nClimate aid is critical for poor communities because it helps them recover from disasters and boost their resiliency for subsequent storms. Climate projects in developing nations may focus on securing safe drinking water, relocating homeowners from flood-prone areas, and reviving economic growth.\n\nYou can support the needs of vulnerable communities in developing nations by contacting your elected officials and encouraging their support of climate action policies.\n\nYou can also learn more about the critical climate issues affecting people worldwide and reach out to organizations to offer donations or volunteer efforts.\n\nJoin our free newsletter for good news and useful tips, and don't miss this cool list of easy ways to help yourself while helping the planet.",

      "text": "Rich nations accused of delaying loss and damage fund with slow payments\nWealthy nations risk undermining the loss and damage fund\u2019s plan to deliver $250 million in aid next year to climate-vulnerable countries hit by extreme weather, board members from developing nations said this week.\nWhile rich nations have pledged $789 million, they have only transferred $348 million so far to the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD), which all governments agreed to set up two years ago under the UN climate talks and is now in its start-up phase.\nSpeaking on behalf of developing-country board members, Honduras\u2019s representative Elena Cristina Pereira Colindres expressed \u201cconcern\u201d during a press briefing, adding that \u201ctransparency and predictability\u201d on when the money would be paid is lacking.\nPereira did not name individual countries, but Italy, the European Union and Luxembourg are the three donors that have promised money but not said when it will be given.\nOther nations \u2013 like the United Arab Emirates, Australia and Sweden \u2013 are drip-feeding their promised pledges, only giving a part of them each year.\nPereira said that these \u201cmulti-year disbursement schedules\u201d severely limit the ability of the fund\u2019s board to determine how much money they can spend and reduces \u201coverall confidence in our partners\u2019 commitments to long-term capitalisation of the fund\u201d.\n\u201cLemonade-stand money\u201d\nWhile the fund\u2019s board has agreed to spend $250 million next year, Pereira said this \u201cmust not be used or considered as an indication of the future scale of the fund\u201d because the needs are in the \u201chundreds of billions\u201d.\nA 2024 study in Nature found that climate change is causing $395 billion of loss and damage each year. Developing countries have called for developed nations to provide $100 billion in loss and damage finance per year by 2030.\nOn Wednesday, Daniel Lund, Fiji\u2019s representative to the fund, told the FRLD board meeting in the Philippines that the amount the fund currently has is just \u201clemonade-stand money\u201d, adding that is about a quarter of what it costs to build a coal-fired power plant.\nScientists hail rapid estimate of climate change\u2019s role in heat deaths as a first\nThe fund\u2019s board is drawing up a plan to get more money \u2013 known as a resource mobilisation strategy \u2013 due to be ready by the end of 2025. \u201cIt is of crucial importance to the constituency that this fund that was established for all developing countries serves their collective needs at the scale that is needed,\u201d Pereira said.\nIn April, the fund approved a strategy for the initial $250 million start-up phase, in which it agreed to give out grants of between $5 million and $20 million to project proposals submitted by developing countries.\nPriority for private finance?\nWith funds scarce, the secretariat which runs the FRLD has proposed that projects that bring in extra sources like private-sector finance should be judged favourably by the board.\nBut some developing-country board members and climate campaigners pushed back at the board meeting against adding this practice, known as leveraging, into the mix.\nEgypt\u2019s representative Mohamed Nasr said he had \u201ca very strong concern\u201d about the idea. \u201cThis should not be part of any criteria when we deal with loss and damage funding,\u201d he said.\nThe head of Climate Action Network (CAN) International, Tasneem Essop, said she was worried that the fund\u2019s secretariat was pursuing \u201ctypical World Bank approaches\u201d. The World Bank was chosen to host the fund \u2013 at least on an interim basis \u2013 despite opposition from some large NGOs like CAN.\nNigeria\u2019s push to cash in on lithium rush gets off to a rocky start\nEssop said she opposed leveraging and derisking of investments. It\u2019s \u201cas if what we are setting up here is an investment fund,\u201d she said. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not \u2013 this is a solidarity fund. This fund needs to benefit the people that are suffering from the climate crisis.\u201d\nSpeaking after her, Nasr said he agreed. \u201cA fund is not a bank. Solidarity is different to investment. Loss and damage is different to development,\u201d he said.\nWhen will funds be given out?\nDespite funding constraints, board co-chair Richard Sherman said he expects the first projects to be approved by the FRLD early next year.\nSherman said he expects the fund to put out a call for proposals at the next board meeting in October and the first projects to be approved at the following meeting in February 2026.\nThe board is still working out the fund\u2019s financial architecture, meaning how the money is banked and disbursed to countries, Sherman said. If done correctly, he added, a unique fund will be set up to deliver a \u201crapid disbursement in time of disaster or extreme event\u201d.\n\u201cWe are working wholeheartedly to make sure that happens,\u201d Sherman told a press briefing, adding that he is striving for the fund to \u201calmost be a hotline for communities\u201d facing loss and damage events.\nIn a statement read out by a minister before the board meeting, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos called for urgency, saying that \u201cevery delay means more families without shelter, more livelihood disrupted and worse \u2013 more lives lost\u201d."
