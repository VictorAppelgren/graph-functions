      "summary": "Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) is named Zacks Bull of the Day, praised for its strong buy rating, robust earnings beats, and positive revisions that have driven a 90% YTD share rise amid a gold rally linked to a weakening U.S. dollar and upcoming Fed rate cuts. In contrast, Hormel Foods (HRL) is the Bear of the Day, flagged as a strong sell due to margin pressure, repeated earnings misses, and a sustained downtrend exacerbated by negative earnings revisions. The article highlights how gold miners can outperform the metal itself, while a consumer staples stock faces headwinds from commodity costs and competitive pricing. Overall, the piece underscores the divergent outlooks for a mining play versus a food producer in the current macro environment.",
