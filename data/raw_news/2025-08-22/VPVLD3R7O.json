  "title": "The Pixel 10 Pro XL Goes to Paris: Out of Hundreds of Photos, These Are My Favs",
  "description": "Google's new flagship takes great images and adds a few new surprises, even though the camera hardware hasn't changed much.",
  "content": "As a photographer, I see every new phone as a camera that also...happens to do other stuff. So when I got an early opportunity to use the Pixel 10 Pro XL in Paris, I was excited to see how its cameras would fare on a photo walk around the beautiful city. Even though Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL share most of the same camera specs as their predecessors, Google has imbued them with a Tensor G5 processor and various new AI tools. Don't miss any of CNET's unbiased tech content and lab-based reviews. Add us as a preferred Google source on Chrome.\n\nThe phone's hardware hasn't changed much from last year, with a 50-megapixel main camera, a 48-megapixel ultrawide camera and a 48-megapixel telephoto camera offering 5x optical zoom. With the new processor and a host of software improvements, Google says it's made its best camera phone yet. To test the company's boasts, I headed out onto the streets. I was testing the Pixel 10 Pro XL, which has an identical camera setup to the base Pixel 10 Pro. Note, too, that to reduce file sizes for display online, all images were first imported into Adobe Lightroom and saved as JPEGs at 3,000 pixels long on the longest edge. No other adjustments have been made unless otherwise stated.\n\nThe AI tool hasn't worked quite as well here, with the faint image of the plane in the original image (left) being turned into an odd jumble of sticks with a red nose in the AI image (right). But it does bring up an important question: If the phone is using generative AI to recreate details in a scene, is it really a photo that you're taking? Google is certainly trying to get ahead of some of the moral issues here in that it says this AI tool will not be applied to faces \"to prevent inaccurate representations.\"",

      "text": "The new Pixel 10 line will debut Wednesday at the Made by Google event, and it almost feels like we've already seen the phones revealed, thanks to a combination of official glimpses of the new phones from Google alongside a plethora of rumors.\nGoogle isn't hiding that the Pixel 10 is coming, as the company itself has posted multiple stylized shots of the phone to promote its launch event. However, Google is still keeping detailed specs and features of the Pixel 10 line to itself, so we won't get the full picture until the official reveal. Check out our Pixel 10 reveal liveblog for all the details.\nSeveral recent rumors suggest a lot of new life to the phone line, though. While we do expect the Pixel line to reflect the overall lineup of the Pixel 9 -- including a base Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro, Pixel 10 Pro XL and Pixel 10 Pro Fold -- rumors are pointing to significant changes to what's inside these phones to make them more feature-packed than ever.\nWe've rounded up the biggest rumors we've found so far about the Pixel 10 line here and will continue updating as we hear more ahead of the event.\nHow to watch the Made by Google event\nThe Made by Google event will begin at 1 p.m. ET (10 a.m. PT) Wednesday and Google will be streaming the Pixel 10 reveals with a livestream on YouTube. You can also tune into CNET's Made by Google preshow, starting at 12:30 p.m. ET (9:30 a.m. PT). The preshow will be hosted by CNET's Bridget Carey and PCMag's Iyaz Akhtar, and feature the final analysis and commentary for what we know about the phones. The preshow will transition directly into Google's event when it begins, and then afterward the postshow will dive into all of the new announcements.\nPixel 10, 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL's release date, pricing and cameras\nStarting with the three non-folding phones in the Pixel 10 line that are getting revealed Aug. 20, we expect the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL to look similar to the Pixel 9 line on the outside. This includes the same rounded camera bar on the back. The entry-level Pixel 10 will get a new third rear camera. While we can see the third camera in the photos Google posted of the Pixel 10, according to a chart posted by known leaker Evan Blass, this will be a 10.8-megapixel telephoto camera that will join a 48-megapixel wide-angle camera and a 13-megapixel ultrawide. This will help the Pixel 10 compare better with the base Galaxy S25, which also has a telephoto camera.\nThe 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL will continue to be differentiated from the standard Pixel 10 with a higher-specced camera system, which includes a 50-megapixel wide-angle, 48-megapixel ultrawide and a 48-megapixel telephoto, according to the same chart posted by Blass.\nThe colors for the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro phones also appear to have leaked, with Android Headlines reporting that the base Pixel 10 will come in obsidian, indigo, frost and lemonade editions. These names would roughly correspond to a black, blueish purple, light blue and yellow, respectively. The Pro models will also come in four colors, with Android Headlines reporting models named obsidian, porcelain, moonstone and jade. Those should roughly match up to black, white, gray and a light green. More photos of these phones were posted by Blass, purporting to be the Pixel 10 lineup from the front, back and side profiles\nDespite the concerns with tariffs, the Pixel 10 line is rumored to keep the same starting prices as the Pixel 9 line.\nPixel 10 line rumored prices\n| Phone | Storage | US Price |\n|---|---|---|\n| Pixel 10 | 128GB | $799 |\n| Pixel 10 | 256GB | $899 |\n| Pixel 10 Pro | 128GB | $999 |\n| Pixel 10 Pro | 256GB | $1,099 |\n| Pixel 10 Pro | 512GB | $1,219 |\n| Pixel 10 Pro | 1TB | $1,449 |\n| Pixel 10 Pro XL | 256GB | $1,199 |\n| Pixel 10 Pro XL | 512GB | $1,319 |\n| Pixel 10 Pro XL | 1TB | $1,549 |\nPixel 10 could support Qi2 magnetic charging\nThe Pixel 10 series could support magnetic accessories, making it one of the few Android phones that would work with many of the MagSafe accessories that were first built to work with Apple's iPhone. That's because the Pixel 10 is rumored to fully support Qi2 wireless charging, which supports magnetic alignment and has magnets built into the phone without needing a case.\nAn image posted by Blass appears to show a Pixel 10 with a circular wireless charger attached to the back, likely using magnets similar to how MagSafe works with the iPhone. If this is the case, it's a huge step for the Qi2 wireless standard, as the only other Android phone so far that supports magnetic accessories is the HMD Skyline.\nThis would allow the Pixel 10 series to natively work with magnetic phone chargers, wallets, mounts and other accessories. Google might also create its own branding for this feature, as an Android Authority report claims that official Pixel 10 accessories that magnetically attach would be called PixelSnap.\nIf this comes to be, it would also make it easier to swap accessories between the iPhone and the Pixel. In addition to the iPhone's support for charging over USB-C, this would mean that MagSafe accessories first purchased to use with an iPhone should work just as well when swapping over to a Pixel 10 phone.\nGoogle's Tensor G5 chip\nFollowing last year's Tensor G4 chip in the Pixel 9 lineup, we presume that the Pixel 10 phones will be powered by a (supposedly named) Tensor G5 chip. We've heard a few Tensor G5 rumors, including that it will be made on an industry-standard 3nm process by chip fabricator TSMC, according to an Android Authority March report.\nOther rumors are less promising, like a July report from WCCFTech suggesting that while the Tensor G5 is a significant upgrade on last year's Tensor G4, a leaked benchmark test claims it will run slower than the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor that's used in Samsung's Galaxy S25 line and the OnePlus 13. That Qualcomm processor might also soon be surpassed by the next Qualcomm silicon coming at Snapdragon Summit in September. That's not to imply the phone itself will perform slowly, as the same report says it will run faster than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor that powers\nWhether the Tensor G5 trails other mobile chips isn't as worrying as it might seem as the Tensor chips are built for Google's Pixel devices -- and those don't seem to be underperforming in daily use. As CNET Editor-at-Large Andy Lanxon said about the Tensor G4 powering the Pixel 9 Pro XL, \"On the one hand, it's disappointing not to see more of a tangible improvement over the predecessor. On the other hand, it doesn't feel like it's lacking in power in any major way.\"\nPixel 10 Pro Fold\nGoogle on Aug. 12 released a video that shows off what the Pixel 10 Pro Fold will look like. This peek only provides a look at the phone's design -- which seems to be similar to last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold -- saving a more detailed look at its specs and cameras for the Aug. 20 event.\nThe more iterative design makes sense, as last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold already debuted a larger overhaul that altered its design from the wider passport-size original Pixel Fold to a taller, narrower format similar to other foldables like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7.\nOne Pixel 10 Pro Fold rumor from WCCFTech only shared details about the supposed Tensor chip powering it. But a recent rumor from Blass suggests we could expect the usual upgrades: a new Tensor G5 chip, perhaps slight spec upgrades and maybe even similar camera or battery upgrades if they are announced for the Pixel 10 lineup.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold would presumably get Android 16 out of the box, but as that software upgrade has been released early (mere weeks after Google I/O 2025), last year's Pixel 9 Pro Fold already has that update.\nWe'll keep updating this roundup as we get closer to Google's Aug. 20 event for the Pixel 10 series."

      "text": "I've been testing the new Google Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, including extensively trying the 10 Pro XL's camera while roaming the streets of Paris. So far, I'm pleased with what I've seen.\nIf you're expecting a totally new generation of Google Pixel devices with the 10 Pro, you may be disappointed. The Pixel 10 Pro is an evolution of its predecessor rather than a complete overhaul. And that's fine.\nRead more: Everything Announced at Made by Google 2025\nGoogle's Pixel 9 Pro impressed me when it launched last year, and it certainly doesn't require a radical transformation just one generation later. The newest Pixel model keeps the 9 Pro's slick design and awesome camera system, while the latest Android 16 software brings a host of new updates. There's also the new Tensor G5 processor, which Google says is faster and more power-efficient than the G4 chip found in last year's model.\nYes, some of the Pixel 10 Pro's new features are based around various new AI tools. The camera, in particular, increasingly incorporates AI into the way you take pictures. Whether that's good or bad is up to you to decide. At least that triple rear camera array can take stunning images, as I found out.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro with 128GB of storage costs $999 (\u00a3999, AU$1,699), while the 10 Pro XL starts at $1,199 (\u00a31,199, AU$1,999) with 256GB of storage. Both go on sale on Aug. 28, but you can preorder them now. While it might seem that the XL's starting price is $100 higher than last year's model, Google eliminated the lower 128GB storage option. While you're paying more for the bigger screen, you're also getting double the storage.\nGoogle 10 Pro vs. 10 Pro XL: What's the difference?\nTo be honest, there's very little difference between the 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL. They look almost identical, except for the XL model being slightly bigger. The XL model incorporates a 6.8-inch display into its larger frame, giving a bit more space to play games or watch videos than the standard 6.3-inch 10 Pro. The extra size also allows for a marginally heftier battery (5,200 mAh versus 4,870 mAh), while the XL also offers slightly faster 45-watt wired charging.\nOtherwise, the core specs are basically the same. Both models share the same Tensor G5 chip and have 16GB of RAM. The camera hardware on the back and front is identical. The choice between the two comes down to whether you prefer big-screen phones for more immersive gaming or something more pocket-friendly.\nPixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL cameras: Solid performance with AI additions\nBoth Pro models use the same rear camera setup, which includes a 50-megapixel main camera with an f/1.68 aperture, a 48-megapixel ultrawide camera and a 48-megapixel telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom. While I haven't put the cameras through a full suite of tests, I took hundreds of photos with the 10 Pro XL in Paris, and I was impressed.\nPhotos from the main camera are bright, pin-sharp and vibrant. Exposure is handled extremely well, with bright skies kept under control and shadow detail clearly visible. Sometimes, images can look a little bit too HDR with unnaturally lightened shadows, but this is par for the course for most phone cameras, and I've certainly seen worse.\nThe ultrawide camera performs similarly well, with little to no color shift when swapping between lenses, which is good to see.\nThe 5x optical zoom remains an ideal sweet spot in terms of focal length, giving just enough zoom to help you find more creative compositions in whatever scene you're facing. Images are sharp and share the same spot-on handling of color and exposure as the main lens. If 5x zoom isn't enough for you, the Pixel lets you take things much further.\nYou can digitally zoom in to 10x, with the resulting image simply being slightly upscaled by the phone's software. Shots look great at this length, and continue to look decent up to 30x. Beyond this point, though, the AI takes over (Google calls it ProRes Zoom) and goes beyond simply upscaling the details. ProRes Zoom actually uses generative AI to try to recreate what it thinks should be in the scene.\nI took a variety of photos at 100x zoom, and the difference between the original image and the AI version is significant. Most of the time, it actually worked quite well, especially when I was just taking zoomed-in shots overlooking Paris, as the ProRes Zoom is optimized for static subjects like buildings and landscapes.\nI was a bit amused when I took a 100x shot of a plane going overhead. The AI recomposed it into an odd sort of bundle of sticks. However, I'm glad it didn't identify my blurry shot as a plane and simply superimpose a picture of a Boeing 737 over the top.\nThat does bring up an important question: if the phone is using generative AI to recreate details in a scene, is it really a photo that you're taking? Google is certainly trying to get ahead of some of the moral issues here in that it says this AI tool will not be applied to faces \"to prevent inaccurate representations.\"\nThe ProRes Zoom isn't the only place you'll find AI in the camera, either. Camera Coach uses AI to analyze the scene in front of you and give you a series of guided prompts on how to take a better photo. If you're taking a portrait, for example, it may suggest putting more of the person in the frame. I used it a few times on my photo walk through Paris, and I can see it being a fun tool for photography newbies to play around with. Still, it felt a bit slow and clunky to be of much use in a quicker photography scenario. Time will tell if Camera Coach becomes a genuinely useful resource for improving photography or not.\nThere's also the Auto Best Take feature, which automatically merges together the best shots of faces in a group to ensure none of your friends have their eyes closed or are squinting. Best Take was introduced on the Pixel 8 phones and required some manual work, whereas the new version does most of the work for you.\nNow, you can also use AI to edit your photos via text prompts like \"erase the crowds\" or \"fix the lighting.\" It remains to be seen how it handles my prompt to \"make me look ten years younger, slimmer, more handsome and wealthy, and also put cats everywhere.\"\nGoogle 10 Pro: Design and display\nThough the Pixel 10 Pro's design hasn't changed much since the Pixel 9 Pro, that's fine. The 9 Pro was a great-looking phone with a really slick feel, and these phones don't need to be revolutionized every single year. Google knew it had a good thing, so it's sticking with it for another generation at least.\nThe polished metal edges, frosted glass back and isolated camera bar continue to look and feel satisfyingly premium. The IP68 rating will help keep it safe from accidentally spilled drinks. The back of the phone is now magnetic, allowing its use with wireless chargers or other magnetic accessories. Google calls this Pixel Snap, but it's basically the same as Apple's MagSafe on the iPhone. It should be compatible with MagSafe and other Qi2-supported products.\nThe 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL's displays can now reach 3,300 nits peak brightness, and both looked bright and sharp during my hands-on time. While I only got to use the 10 Pro indoors, the XL's display was more than bright enough to let me take pictures under the shining midday Paris sun.\nGoogle 10 Pro: Android 16 and AI tools\nThe phones will launch with the latest Android 16, featuring various upgrades. Chief among these is the new Material 3 Expressive interface, with changes to animations, texts, icons, menu layout and other elements to give a more refined, easier-to-use experience.\nI already like the Pixel 9 Pro's stock Android look. As a result, I find the model extremely easy to use, and I'm excited by what I've seen of Android 16 so far. It's not a total overhaul, but it looks like there are a lot of subtle improvements to help make Android feel a bit more usable in everyday life. I'm looking forward to spending more time with it when I get the phone for the full review.\nAI is, unsurprisingly, a major part of the Pixel 10 Pro line, with various new AI tools being introduced. Magic Cue, for example, aims to automatically surface relevant information when you need it. Say you're texting a friend and they ask for details about the camping trip you have coming up. Magic Cue will see this request and can pull up relevant information from Gmail, such as confirmation messages for the campsite and details you two have discussed. It can share that without making you switch apps to find it yourself.\nCalling an airline to alter a booking? Magic Cue will recognize the phone number and automatically pull up your flight details so you have them ready. It certainly sounds like a helpful tool, though I do wonder exactly how useful it will be. Magic Cue only pulls info from certain Google apps (Gmail, Messages, Calendar and your screenshots), but not from third-party apps like WhatsApp or Instagram. So if you tend to mostly chat outside of Google services, its use might be more limited. As always, I'm excited to delve deeper when I get the phone in my hand.\nThere's a host of other new AI tools including a real-time voice translation tool when you're making phone calls. Existing tools like Gemini Advanced, Circle to Search and Pixel Studio (the generative-AI image maker) are also on board as standard.\nThe base Pixel 10, 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL all run the new Tensor G5 chip, but the two Pro models also get 16GB of RAM for some extra multitasking prowess, compared to 8GB on the standard Pixel 10. How this silicon performs on our suite of benchmark tests -- as well as for gaming and other demanding uses -- remains to be seen. Google has made various boasts of the G5 chip's significant power increase, both in the CPU and GPU.\nAccording to Google, all new Pixel 10 models will receive seven years of software and security updates. That means these phones will be safe to use until at least 2032, as long as you look after them properly.\nPixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL: Battery and Qi2 charging\nEach phone should provide at least a full day of battery life. You might expect a bit more longevity from the larger battery of the XL model, but bear in mind that it also has a bigger, brighter display to power, which will suck away more of the juice over the course of the day.\nBattery life on the 9 Pro was basically average, and to be honest, that's fine if that's the case again. As long as I can make it into the evening without desperately hunting for a charger to see me to bedtime, I'm happy. Almost all phones demand a full recharge every night, and I don't expect that to change here.\nWhat is different, though, is the implementation of Qi2 technology, the latest version of the wireless charging standard that promises faster charging times when used with a compatible charger (up to 25 watts). Wired charging is faster, too, with the 10 Pro supporting 30-watt charging and the 10 Pro XL taking that further to 45 watts. Google says the XL model will go from empty to 70% full in around 30 minutes, which will certainly come in handy if you're running low on power when getting ready for a big night out.\nPixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL: Are they worth buying?\nThe new Pixel 10 Pro series isn't a big overhaul from the last generation, so those of you with a Pixel 9 Pro don't need to consider upgrading. Probably ditto for anyone with the Pixel 8 Pro.\nIf, however, you have a much older Pixel model or other Android phone -- or if you're looking for a change from Apple -- you should consider Google's new phones.\nThe design of the Pixel 10 Pro series remains slick. The cameras performed well in our early tests, and the new AI-based tools like Magic Cue appear to be genuinely useful.
