      "feedback": "The draft is strong on macro grounding but fails the SECTION FOCUS at the format and signal level: tighten the four Movers into exactly 2 Up and 2 Down lines with crisp causal chains, ground every fact in first-principles logic, and prune extraneous sections so the piece reads as a scenario-driven Swing Trade anchored in the provided material. Actionable edits: (1) Rebuild Movers & Scenarios into four lines only—two Up and two Down—and delete the broader paragraph blocks; format each line as: Up/Down | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %; anchor each probability to explicit material (e.g., Up 0–3w around 60% per OGK8WLL69; Up 3–6m ~55–60%; Down 0–3w ~20%; Down 6–12w ~25%) with in-text citations only for asserting the facts (OGK8WLL69; GZ9VV1RV0; 22PL3Q360; NL5YYTLF2). (2) Replace the current mixed horizon narrative with a single, testable first-principles chain: policy stance/real-rate framework drives discount rates, which governs ETH/BTC pricing via staking yields, ETFs, and treasury demand; keep only crypto-relevant anchors (ETH near 4,900–4,955; BTC 110k–120k; ETF inflows ~$9.6b July–early Aug; Bitmine’s $45m purchase; one‑third staking) and cite them. (3) For the Swing Trade, provide one tradable-outlook line if ETH remains the tradable focus, with the exact required fields (Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence 0–100); ground Entry/Stop/Target to price anchors (e.g., entry near $4,900 with a structured stop and a defined upside, referencing the ~4,900–4,955 area and ETF/corporate demand signals from OGK8WLL69 and Scraped Source 6); ensure the Trigger is a concrete confirmatory close (e.g., daily close above a level) and assign a probability based on the source signals (e.g., 60% with 70 confidence). (4) Eliminate non-essential macro digressions (e.g., broad private-market signals, non-crypto wealth platforms, or unrelated regime maps) unless they directly feed ETH pricing through the policy-to-discount-rate channel; (5) Quantify all key assertions with precise ranges and keep every numeric claim tied to the IDs cited, e.g., ETH ETFs inflows, price anchors, and staking shares (OGK8WLL69; Scraped Source 4; Scraped Source 6). (6) Tighten invalidation rules to concrete policy or flow breaks (e.g., ETF inflow deterioration or staking economics reversal) and place them as explicit triggers in the lines. (7) Ensure formatting is strict: no stray lines, no trailing citation lists, and that all four movers and the single Swing Trade/outlook line conform to the exact field requirements. (8) After restructuring, re-check for internal consistency: same reference set across lines, no conflicting horizon claims, and probabilities calibrated to the material rather than opinion. (9) If you keep the broader horizon discussion, relocate it to an appendix or clearly separate “Base Case/Alternate Scenarios” sections, so the core four movers and the Swing Trade render as a clean, testable payoff matrix. (10) Finally, verify all citations are present only as IDs adjacent to the facts they support and remove any stray or non‑source statements to preserve strict sourcing discipline.",
