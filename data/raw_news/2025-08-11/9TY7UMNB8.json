  "content": "\u2022 Fraudulent TikTok Shops driving victims into fake portals designed to steal cryptocurrency and data\n\u2022 Scammers mimic trusted seller profiles and lure shoppers with unrealistic discounts across popular platforms\n\nCybercriminals are now making use of TikTok Shops to spread malware and steal funds from unsuspecting young users of the platform.\n\nThe campaign, revealed by security experts at CTM360, mimics the profile of legitimate ecommerce sellers to build its credibility, often using AI-generated content.\n\nIn addition to TikTok, these fake shops can also be found on Facebook, where their modus operandi is to advertise massive price cuts to lure potential victims.\n\nThe main target of these malicious actors is not only to defraud users, mostly in cryptocurrency, but also to deliver malicious software and steal login details.\n\nAt the moment, TikTok Wholesale and Mall pages have been linked to over 10,000 such fraudulent URLs.\n\nThese URLs, which look like official platforms, offer \u201cbuy links\u201d that redirect visitors to a criminal phishing portal.\n\nOnce users click the link and enter the portal, they will be made to pay a deposit into an online wallet or purchase a product \u2013 the online wallet is fake and the product does not exist.\n\nSome operations take the deception further by posing as an affiliate management service, pushing malicious apps disguised as tools for sellers.\n\nMore than 5,000 app download sources have been uncovered, many using embedded links and QR codes to bypass traditional scrutiny.\n\nOne identified threat, known as SparkKitty, is capable of harvesting data from both Android and iOS devices.\n\nIt can enable long-term access to compromised devices, creating ongoing risk even after the initial infection.\n\nThe malware is often delivered through these fake affiliate applications, turning what appears to be a legitimate opportunity into a direct path for account takeover and identity theft.\n\nBecause cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible, victims have little recourse once funds are transferred.\n\nA common thread in the campaign is the use of pressure tactics, with countdown timers or limited-time discounts designed to force quick decisions.\n\nThese tactics, while common in legitimate marketing, make it harder for users to pause and assess the authenticity of an offer.\n\nDomain checks reveal many of the scam sites using inexpensive extensions such as .top, .shop, or .icu, which can be purchased and deployed rapidly.\n\u2022 Make sure you check the website address carefully before entering your payment information. Every detail of the website should match the legitimate domain.\n\u2022 Ensure that you use secure HTTPS encryption\n\u2022 If the price cut feels too huge, follow your gut and stay away.\n\u2022 Do not allow a countdown timer to pressure you into making payment; this pressure is a common tactic my malicious actors\n\u2022 Always insist on the standard payment methods and avoid direct wire transfers or cryptocurrency, as these are harder to trace and often used in scams.\n\u2022 Install and maintain a trusted security suite that combines robust antivirus protection with real-time browsing safeguards to block malicious websites.\n\u2022 Configure your firewall to actively monitor and filter network traffic, preventing unauthorized access and blocking suspicious connections before they reach your device.\n\u2022 Pay close attention to alerts from reputable security programs, which can detect and warn you about known phishing sites or fraudulent activities in real time.\n\u2022 Remain cautious even when shopping on professional-looking platforms, as well-designed storefronts can still conceal sophisticated attempts at theft.\n\nYou might also like\n\u2022 These are the best AI website builders around\n\u2022 Take a look at our pick of the best internet security suites\n\u2022 OpenAI has new, smaller open models to take on DeepSeek - and they'll be available on AWS for the first time",

      "text": "Major new malware strain targets crypto users via malicious ads - here's what we know, and how to stay safe\nNew piece of malware went undetected on many antivirus products\n- Check Point finds thousands of ads promoting fake crypto apps\n- The apps come with an infostealer malware targeting users\n- The infostealer can bypass most antivirus protections\nCryptocurrency users are being targeted by a highly sophisticated, widespread cybercriminal campaign with the goal of deploying malware capable of grabbing exchange and wallet information, essentially robbing the people of their tokens, experts from Check Point have warned.\nApparently active since March 2024, what makes this campaign, dubbed JSCEAL by the researchers, unique is the use of compiled JavaScript files (JSC), which allows the malware to remain hidden from most traditional antivirus solutions.\nThe criminals created fake cryptocurrency exchange and wallet apps, which come with an infostealer. They also created websites to host these apps, and managed to purchase thousands of advertisements on the internet to promote the scam. Check Point says that just in the European Union (EU), 35,000 malicious ads were served between January and June 2025.\nJSCEAL malware\n\u201cThe use of Facebook\u2019s Ad Library enabled us to estimate the campaign\u2019s reach, while in a very conservative approach we can estimate the total reach of the malvertising campaign at 3.5 million users within the EU alone, and likely above 10 million users worldwide,\u201d the researchers explained.\nPeople who fall for the scam download an MSI installer which triggers \u201ca sequence of profiling scripts\u201d that gather critical system information. These scripts also use PowerShell commands to collect and exfiltrate data, in preparation of the final payload deployment.\nThis final payload is the JSCEAL malware, which steals crypto-related data such as credentials and private keys. The payload is executed through Node.js, it was said.\nWhat makes this malware particularly dangerous is the use of compiled JavaScript files.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\n\u201cThe JSCEAL campaign uses compiled V8 JavaScript (JSC) files, a lesser-known feature of Google\u2019s V8 engine that enables code obfuscation and evasion of static analysis,\u201d the researchers added.\n\u201cThis innovative technique allows attackers to bypass detection systems, making it extremely challenging to detect the malicious code until it executes. JSCEAL is notable for its scale, technical complexity, and persistence, having evolved significantly since its discovery.\u201d\nEven today, many versions of the malware remain undetected by common security tools.\nAnyone concerned their data may be under threat should ensure their antivirus protections are up to date - we've rounded up the best free antivirus software around - and for those who prefer using Apple technology, also the best Mac antivirus software.\nYou might also like\n- This dangerous new malware is hitting iOS and Android phones alike - and it's even stealing photos and crypto\n- Take a look at our guide to the best authenticator app\n- We've rounded up the best password managers\nSead is a seasoned freelance journalist based in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

      "text": "The best internet security suites for 2025: ranked and rated by the expert\nThe best internet security suites for PCs, Macs and mobile devices, reviewed by the experts\n- Top 3 internet security suites\n- Best overall internet security suite\n- Best internet security suite for families\n- Best internet security suite for multiple devices\n- Best internet security suite for beginners\n- Best value internet security suite\n- Best internet security suite with VPN\n- Best configurable internet security suite\n- Fastest internet security suite\n- Internet security suites FAQs\nThe best internet security suites are one of the best ways to protect a whole household of devices. Offering coverage across multiple platforms and operating systems, these comprehensive packages often provide the best antivirus, firewall protection, parental controls, a VPN, password manager, and so much more.\nMy team of experts here at TechRadar Pro have spent tens of thousands of hours testing and reviewing hundreds of security products, so we'd like to think we know a thing or two about what makes a good cybersecurity tool.\nIn our reviews, we look at AV-TEST scores for each antivirus package, before going on to examine just how each part of the internet security suite ticks. Whether its VPN server count, inclusion of ransomware protection, or insurance included with identity theft protection.\nBitdefender Total Security remains my top pick for most people, thanks to it's near-perfect scoring across multiple antivirus and security evaluations, attractive price point, and extra features.\nTop 3 internet security suites in 2025\nIn a hurry? Here are our top 3 picks for internet security suites:\n1. Bitdefender Total Security: best overall internet security suite\nOur top recommendation, Bitdefender Total Security offers the best-in-class security for you and your devices.\nFeatures include multi-layered ransomware protection, parental controls, firewall, a Wi-Fi security advisor, a secure browser for online banking, a file shredder, a vulnerability scanner and more.\nPlus with a 30-day free trial, you can give Bitdefender Total Security a go, risk-free.\n2. Norton 360 Deluxe: best internet security suite for families\nNorton 360 Deluxe is a great choice for families as it offers not only parental controls but also a VPN, online backup and dark web monitoring in addition to 50GB of online backup storage.\nNorton 360 Deluxe offers this top-class protection for to 5 devices, and has offerings for both iOS and Android.\n3. Avast One: a great all-round internet security suite\nAvast One offers protection against malicious software, webcam security and data breach monitoring, all wrapped up in one easy-to-use interface.\nNot only that, with Avast One you can protect up to 30 devices with web protection, a VPN, and Avast's Sensitive Data Shield, which adds an extra layer of protection to your private data.\nBest overall internet security suite\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a whole host of features.\n\u2714\ufe0f You use devices across a range of operating systems - Bitdefender can be used on iOS, Android, Mac and Windows.\n\u274c You have an older CPU as its performance may be impacted.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with advanced PC maintenance tools.\nBitdefender Total Security is the well-respected security firm\u2019s top-of-the-range package and tops the lot when it comes to all-singing all-dancing internet security suites.\nTotal Security is a suite that\u2019s positively bristling with features. You get \u2013 deep breath \u2013 standard antivirus tools plus impressively capable multi-layered ransomware protection, a firewall, a Wi-Fi security advisor, a secure browser (Safepay) for online banking, a file shredder, a vulnerability scanner (to check for missing apps and OS updates), password manager, email spam filter, parental controls, webcam and microphone defenses, and more besides including a superb web protection module for blocking malicious URLs.\nAs well as security features, Total Security provides various PC maintenance and optimization tools. These are somewhat useful in themselves, for cleaning out superfluous files and streamlining boot times \u2013 but more importantly, Bitdefender\u2019s flagship package also covers more than just Windows devices.\nIn fact, an app is provided for Mac users (the software is compatible with M1 Macs, and has been improved to run faster virus scans), as well as clients for iOS and Android mobiles. The Android app also has the capability to block more link-based mobile threats.\nAs it\u2019s only a bit more expensive than Bitdefender Internet Security \u2013 the firm\u2019s mid-tier security suite \u2013 I'd say it\u2019s certainly worthwhile upgrading to Total Security if you have multiple devices across various platforms to protect. (You can see what we think of the range in our full Bitdefender review).\nThere is further good news in that Bitdefender has a minimal impact on system performance, going by independent and my own testing (some rivals do a touch better in this department, but it\u2019s not a difference you\u2019ll ever notice in real-world use).\nFinally, it\u2019s worth noting that there\u2019s a 30-day free trial of this suite, with no payment details needed; you just have to supply an email address. That means you can try out Bitdefender for a full month before committing to buying and see first-hand for yourself exactly what\u2019s on offer here.\nBest internet security suite for families\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with an integrated VPN.\n\u2714\ufe0f You're looking for an internet security suite for the whole family.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite that doesn't use a lot of resources.\n\u274c You have more than 5 devices you want to use the internet security suite on.\nWhen I evaluated all of NortonLifeLock\u2019s security suite options, I picked out Norton 360 Deluxe as the best value all-around choice for anyone who\u2019s looking to protect more than a single device \u2013 which is likely the majority of folks.\nNorton delivers good basic protection \u2013 although some of the independent test lab results have been a little mixed \u2013 alongside a wealth of features, including webcam protection and dark web monitoring (for users in the US, Canada, UK, Australia and a few other countries), an impressively smart firewall, plus a system of parental controls.\nThe parental controls are top-notch, by the way, including in-depth monitoring systems to keep an eye on what your kids are doing online, and even GPS tracking for their mobile devices. Norton\u2019s very strong in this department.\nThere are some truly worthwhile extras included here, too, like a fully integrated Norton VPN that massively adds to the value proposition of this suite (assuming you don\u2019t have a VPN already, of course), and 50GB of cloud backup storage that's another handy bonus.\nAs for negative points, a flaw worth bearing in mind is that I found Norton 360 Deluxe had more of a drag on system performance than most internet security suites in my own testing. That said, it\u2019s rated as about average in this department by independent test lab AV-Comparatives, and odds are you likely won\u2019t even notice any impact on the speed of your system in everyday usage.\nNorton 360 Deluxe covers up to five devices, either Windows or Mac PCs, plus there are mobile apps for Android and iOS. Pricing is highly competitive compared to rivals, particularly given that bundled VPN, so you should definitely consider this Norton package (compare it to the company\u2019s other offerings with our guide to choosing your Norton plan) \u2013 especially for family usage with those very thorough parental controls.\nBest internet security suite for multiple devices\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a top-rated antivirus engine.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want your internet security suite to cover a lot of devices.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with a fast VPN service.\nAvast One is the trusted security outfit\u2019s revamped suite which offers an umbrella of protection across various bases. That means not just antivirus and ransomware defenses, but also a firewall, webcam protection, data breach monitoring, and a software updater to keep apps patched up with no need for user intervention.\nOn top of that, Avast One provides a full VPN (with unlimited data \u2013 although it\u2019s not the fastest I\u2019ve ever seen, by any means), and some device speed-up and maintenance tools.\nThere are also some more unusual features like a Sensitive Data Shield which scans drives for files that may contain sensitive info like passwords and phone numbers and stops other users of a device from accessing these. In short, you get a lot with the paid subscription of Avast One (there\u2019s a free version which is impressive, too, but it drops a number of features, and the VPN function is limited).\nAll this is wrapped up in a smart and easy-to-use interface which has been thoughtfully redesigned for Avast One, and the cherry on top is the strength of the protection delivered. Avast\u2019s antivirus engine is rated as excellent by the independent test labs, and its web protection is among the best around, too. Furthermore, system slowdown is negligible when running this suite.\nOverall, Avast One packs in a lot of features, and while some of these capabilities may not be as robust as the top performers in this roundup, the sheer weight of what you\u2019re getting means this is one of the best all-rounders out there.\nBest internet security suite for beginners\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with great ransomware protection.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a user-friendly interface.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with configuration options for experts.\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about Trend Micro\u2019s flagship security suite \u2013 Trend Micro Maximum Security \u2013 not the least of which is its polished and user-friendly interface, backed up by superb virus protection. Trend Micro is highly ranked by the independent testing labs, and it offers sterling multi-layered anti-ransomware defenses, too.\nThe package also gives you first-class URL filtering for safer web browsing, further bolstering the overall defenses provided here. That said, one slight weak point with Trend Micro\u2019s offering is that there isn\u2019t a huge amount of low-level control \u2013 such as virus scan options \u2013 so more demanding users may find it lacking here.\nMaximum Security provides parental controls, social media privacy features and PC maintenance tools, although the latter isn\u2019t its strongest suit. It also boasts data theft prevention countermeasures, a secure vault for storing sensitive files, and a decent integrated password manager.\nLess tech-savvy types will appreciate the ease-of-use here, which also goes for the capable mobile apps. There\u2019s a 30-day trial as well, so you can thoroughly check all this out for yourself before pulling the trigger on a purchase.\nBest value internet security suite\n5. McAfee Total Protection Multi-Device\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a high-quality spam filter.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want a good value internet security suite.\n\u274c You want a robust malware protection.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with an advanced VPN.\nAs the name suggests, McAfee\u2019s basic security product, Total Protection Individual, only covers one individual device. And if you\u2019re thinking of buying that, and you own more than just a Windows PC, then you\u2019re almost certainly better off purchasing McAfee Total Protection Multi-Device.\nFor not much more money at all you get a sound internet security suite which protects up to five Windows, ChromeOS, or Mac computers, and Android or iOS devices. US customers also benefit from a useful additional extra in the form of identity theft protection.\nMcAfee\u2019s interface is simple and streamlined, which keeps things easy for beginners, although it\u2019ll likely be too sparse for more experienced users. The UI also suffers from some annoying quirks, but nothing too frustrating.\nIndependent test lab reports suggest McAfee Total Protection offers solid enough defenses, if not class-leading. Indeed, evaluations of McAfee\u2019s antivirus engine vary, with some being more scathing than others.\nOverall, McAfee\u2019s suite represents reasonable value and a decent choice in the Multi-Device package, with some nifty extras for boosting web browsing and app performance, plus an integrated (but very basic) free VPN that\u2019s commendably user-friendly.\nBest internet security suite with VPN\n6. Avira Prime\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite that covers up to 25 devices.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a built-in VPN.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with robust cyber security features.\nThis is an interesting one in that Avira\u2019s top-level package is missing some of the core security features you might find in other internet security suites, but it more than makes up for this in other ways which might be tempting depending on your own personal needs and use case.\nSo, while a firewall and parental controls might be missing from Avira Prime \u2013 or a backup facility (save for a contacts backup feature on the iOS app) \u2013 you do get some nifty stuff instead. That includes a decent VPN and some seriously high-quality PC maintenance tools.\nIf you want those speed-up tools, and/or have been considering getting a VPN as well as a new security suite, then Prime could be a perfect fit. In fact, in the latter case, Avira Prime works out as storming value for money, providing a solid engine to keep you safe, and that Avira VPN on top to keep you safer still online. Others, however, may miss the aforementioned core suite features like parental controls, of course.\nBest configurable internet security suite\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite that is highly configurable.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with with cloud analysis that picks up undetected threats.\n\u274c You want an internet security suite with robust, powerful security features.\nESET Smart Security Premium packs in a lot of features including parental controls, webcam protection, network monitoring, additional network protection, and an anti-theft feature for Windows devices allowing for location tracking is an interesting bonus. Furthermore, Linux systems are covered here, as well as Windows and Mac computers.\nHowever, while ESET delivers lots of features, their quality can be variable. For example, the system of parental controls is very barebones, but the password manager is well fleshed out. ESET also offers plenty of configuration options, which will please experts, although computing novices may find it tricky to get to grips with in some respects.\nESET\u2019s antivirus protection seems solid, albeit with some mixed evaluations from independent testing labs. It\u2019s also worth noting that the suite\u2019s defenses have recently been bolstered with Live Guard, an extra layer of cloud analysis to detect newly emerged threats.\nSmart Security Premium provides some interesting extras, too, including the aforementioned password manager, and a secure, encrypted file vault to protect any sensitive data on your PC, which some folks will doubtless find very useful additions.\nThat said, unless you really want this additional functionality, it\u2019s not the best value for money internet security suite out there.\nFastest internet security suite\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite that covers up to 25 devices.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want an internet security suite with a built-in VPN.\n\u274c You want to use the it on iOS.\n\u274c You want top-of-the-range antivirus protection.\nWebroot majors in being incredibly lightweight and fast-performing. Indeed, it has a minuscule memory footprint, and takes up next to no space on your system drive, as the product\u2019s virus definitions are all stored in the cloud.\nYet despite this minimal impact on your machine, Webroot Internet Security Plus comes with plenty of features. There\u2019s online banking protection, an Identity Shield to prevent data theft from the likes of keyloggers, ransomware defenses, an accurate anti-phishing system, a smart firewall, plus a password manager as you get a LastPass subscription bundled.\nDownsides? Well, you might get lightning quick malware scans, but Webroot hasn\u2019t fared very well in recent antivirus testing by the independent labs (or at least one of them, as the other big players don\u2019t evaluate this product). The accuracy of its engine is mixed at best, so that\u2019s a somewhat worrying question mark at the time of writing.\nStill, Internet Security Plus is a well-rounded package, and as we pointed out in our review, Windows users could always run it alongside the free Microsoft Defender to get the benefit of Webroot\u2019s bonus features, while doubling up on protection. The company\u2019s 70-day \u2018no questions asked\u2019 money-back guarantee is also noteworthy, showing Webroot\u2019s confidence in its suite.\nFind the best deals on Webroot products with our Webroot promo codes.\nMarch 2025 Update - I have updated this guide to reflect accurate pricing and capabilities, alongside devices-per-license and compatibility. Bullguard Premium Protection used to appear on this list. However, Bullguard products were removed from the market on July 25, 2022 after the company was acquired by Norton. Kaspersky Total Security Anti-Virus used to appear on this list. Considering the current climate however, we've taken the decision to remove the provider. Although much of the company's core processes are now take place in Switzerland, the fact that its headquarters remain in Moscow and there have been previous allegations around government coercion, it feels prudent to use the provider with caution. And, when there are so many other excellent providers to choose from, it's impossible to whole-heartedly recommend Kaspersky at this time.\nInternet security suites FAQs\nWhat is the best internet security suite for 2025?\nWhile there are excellent internet security suites out there from names such as Norton, Avast and Trend Micro, we think Bitdefender Total Security is the best you can get right now.\nAvailable to use on up to 10 devices (including Windows, Macs, Android and iOS) Total Security combines super string virus protection with numerous extra features that genuinely add value to the package.\nFor example, a single subscription includes ransomware protection, firewall, Wi-Fi security advisor, secure browser. file shredder, vulnerability scanner, password manager, email spam filter, parental controls, webcam, microphone defenses and more!\nIt's also really easy to set up and use, while not even being that expensive.\nWhat should I look for in an internet security suite?\nAll of the products on this list offer effective capabilities, so the difference is in additional capabilities. If there is a particular type of threat that concerns you, such as ransomware or phishing, check to see if there are specific protections included.\nBanking safeguards, firewalls and parental controls are also areas you should consider \u2013 especially if there are multiple users on your computer. And of course, you should consider whether you need protection across multiple devices, such as smartphones.\nThe number of additional features and devices may impact cost though.\nFinally, think about usability and the impact on system performance. Do you want a high level of customization or do you want an easy-to-use interface and do you want a program that is capable of fast scans or one that requires minimal system resources?\nDo I really need an internet security suite?\nIt\u2019s certainly true that a good entry-level antivirus will deliver strong core defenses against malware, so why would you want to think about getting one of the best internet security suites?\nAfter all, don\u2019t all apps from the same vendor use the exact same antivirus engine, giving you the same fundamental protection \u2013 while a suite demands a heftier price tag?\nOf course, you\u2019ll get more features with internet security suites, but one perception is that these maybe aren\u2019t all that critical to protect your device. And in some cases, this is true; they\u2019re just nice extras to have.\nBut in other cases, you might get capabilities like secure file vaults for your sensitive data, or a secure browser with which to engage in the likes of online banking \u2013 all of which provide worthwhile additional safeguards. Then there are elements like a password manger, or bundled VPN, which again really bolster online security beyond core measures, if you don\u2019t already have these things.\nFeatures like a free VPN could add to the value proposition of an internet security suite in a big way \u2013 depending on your existing software and needs \u2013 and while we mentioned paying more for a suite compared to a basic antivirus, sometimes security vendors don\u2019t charge much more. Indeed, when deals and discounts come into play, it can be the case that there\u2019s barely any difference in price \u2013 and don\u2019t forget, internet security suites usually support a fair few more devices (which can be a major consideration if you need coverage for family members as well as yourself).\nWhat's the difference between antivirus and internet security suites?\nWhile antivirus software provides a basic level of protection for your system, full internet security expands on capabilities such as scanning files and software, activity monitoring and vulnerability search with features tailored for Internet use.\nIndeed, many internet security products are marketed as \u2018suites\u2019 because they contain several different programs that can be accessed by a single interface.\nThese might include a firewall, anti-spam controls, ad blockers, webcam protection, keylogger protection, parental controls and credit card safeguards. There might also be additional protection against web-specific types of malware such as spyware and adware.\nHowever running so many different types of program might mean that internet security suites use more of your system resources than conventional AV.\nCan I create my own free internet security suite?\nThere are many advantages to purchasing a premium internet security suite from a trusted vendor, but it is perfectly possible to create your own modular suite by picking the most suitable free products.\nWhile this might mean you save money, it does mean you have to do much of the work yourself. You will have to identify the best components, whether its virus protection, firewall or backup software, and fix any problems yourself.\nThe more components you introduce will increase complexity and system resource use. You will also suffer from the pitfalls of using free services such as frequent adverts urging you to upgrade.\nUsing a premium internet security suite means the vendor integrates several services into a single package that can be managed from a single interface. What\u2019s more, they might cover several different types of device and offer different tiers of protection.\nIf you do want to build out your own suite, then you can pick the best of individual components in the following advice guides:\n- Rescue disk\n- Encryption software\n- Anonymous browsing\n- Firewall\n- Cloud antivirus\n- Endpoint protection\n- Online cyber security courses\nIn our latest round of updates, we overhauled this page's layout and structure by adding a quick menu, boxouts to give you the pros and cons of the internet security suites on offer and clearer headings. We also double-checked the pricing, deals, server locations, and unblocking capabilities to make sure the information on this page was as accurate and up-to-date as possible.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nBenedict has been writing about security issues for over 7 years, first focusing on geopolitics and international relations while at the University of Buckingham.

Benedict updates and maintains a wide ranging collection of security guides on everything from Antivirus to ZTNA.\nThe Best Malware Removal of 2025 in Full:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best malware removal overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMalwarebytes is updated daily, so you can trust it to identify and remove new threats the minute they appear.\nThe first time you install Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, you\u2019re given a 14-day trial of the premium edition, which includes preventative tools like real-time scanning and specific protection from ransomware. After two weeks, it reverts to the basic free version. This has to be activated manually, but is still a top-notch security tool. We recommend running it at least once a week to check for any nasties that you haven't noticed, or if you notice that your web browser has suddenly started acting strangely (likely a result of adware).\nThe app also includes the Browser Guard extension (for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) that protects you from phishing scams, blocks annoying ads, and tracker and more. It\u2019ll also review the security settings of your operating system, and can check if credentials associated with your email address have been leaked as part of a known data breach.. Malwarebytes Premium starts at $7/year for the personal edition, and goes all the way up to $ 799.99/year for protecting 20 devices.\nMalwarebytes also offers AdwCleaner, which targets and removes annoying programs that hijack your browser by changing your homepage, resetting your default search engine, or adding unwanted toolbars. It\u2019s also available for free, and along with Anti-Malware, is a great addition to your security toolkit.\nRead our full Malwarebytes Anti-Malware review.\nBest malware removal for detection rates\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAvast offers one of the most competent internet protection suites out there. While the company is famous for providing free antivirus software, it's worth noting that this now comes bundled with an anti-malware feature that uses behavioral monitoring to spot rogue programs.\nWhat's even better is that not only are Avast's basic products free, but they are also available for mobile devices as well as for desktops, which makes Avast a particular ideal choice if you have multiple devices you need to check. The app can also optionally install the free Avast Secure Browser with built-in protection from online ads, phishing scams, and more.\nWhile the basic Avast service is second-to-none, the company also provides paid-for anti-malware software that includes things, such as fine-tuning your PC to run better, to anti-ransomware software and secure file shredding.\nFor business users, there are paid-for internet security options to cover a range of needs and options.\nFor home users, though, the Avast free antivirus should keep your PC very well protected, though do note you'll be periodically prompted to update for one of Avast's other services.\nBoth the Premium (phishing protection, and more) and Ultimate (VPN, and more) versions can protect up to 10 devices. They cost $69.48 the first year, following which Premium renews at $99.99/year and Ultimate at $139.99/year.\nRead our full Avast antivirus review.\nBest malware removal for money value\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTrend Micro Antivirus+ Security is a very capable package that's easy to use with above average anti-spam and an effective \u2018Folder Shield\u2019 module to block ransomware. And, it seems to get better as time goes on.\nHow good is it exactly? The top testing labs all rate it highly for protection, even though there\u2019s a bit of disagreement on the details. In particular, AV-Comparatives says it gives a high number of false positives, which could be a real nuisance. On the other hand, AV-Test reports high levels of accuracy and no issues with false positives at all.\nOur experiences with the product is that protection levels look similar to Bitdefender, false positives are only marginally higher, and the system itself doesn't slow down our system noticeably more than anything else.\nStandout features include ransomware protection, advanced AI learning, email scam safeguarding, and Pay Guard to protect financial transactions. It costs $19.95/year for one Windows computer. The app also includes a free browser extension (for Chrome, Edge, Firefox) that can block ads, protects against phishing attacks, and more.\nWe'd recommend running the trial for its full 30 days before you buy, then, to see if you notice any problems. But if you're unaffected, its high levels of detection and excellent bonus features make Trend Micro a good choice.\nRead our full Trend Micro Antivirus+ Security review.\nBest malware removal for ease of use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nF-Secure Internet Security is a great collection of antivirus tools, and while it's a bit pricier than some of the other antivirus software on this best of list, the number of features you get certainly makes that high price tag worthwhile.\nWith F-Secure Internet Security, you get the brilliant antivirus software from F-Secure, alongside banking protection for safe online shopping, a password manager, an unlimited VPN, and a device finder that lets you track your lost Android or iOS device, and if needs be, remotely lock or wipe it as well.\nThe package typically receives maximum marks for protection from AV-Test, and generally scores highly with AV-Comparatives. They also say it can generate significantly more false positives than most of the competition, but how that affects you will vary depending on how you use your computer.\nThe interface is a major advantage, as it's extremely easy to use, lightweight, and for the most part, you can just leave the app to work alone looking after your PC. The program has minimal effect on your system performance, and if you do need to intervene, you can generally solve any issues in a couple of clicks.\nAvailable for Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, F-Secure Internet Security remains an appealing package: fast, lightweight, and able to run alongside many other security tools without conflict. Standout features include banking protection, and ransomware protection.\nF-Secure Internet Security costs $49.99/year for one device, or $89.99 for two years. To protect three devices, you\u2019ll need to pay $64.99/year, or $114.99 for two years. Similarly, for up to five devices, the app costs $69.99/year or $124.99 for two years. Helpfully, there\u2019s a 30-day free trial to help you explore all the nooks and crannies of the app.\nRead our full F-Secure review.\nBest free malware removal\nBest free malware removal overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBitdefender Antivirus Free Edition is a straightforward security tool that offers essential protection without the complexity or clutter of a full security suite. Designed primarily for Windows users, you can use the free edition to protect up to three devices.\nThe app is very user friendly as it has a minimalistic interface, and an efficient background scanning engine. In fact, simplicity is one of Bitdefender Free\u2019s strengths. The interface is clean and the software requires little to no user intervention after installation. It scans files automatically, blocks suspicious activity in real time, and keeps out of the way unless a threat is detected.\nIn terms of malware protection, the free edition performs well since it shares the same core technology and signatures found in Bitdefender\u2019s paid products, which is a definite plus.\nOn the downside, the free edition doesn\u2019t have features, such as a firewall, a VPN, ransomware file recovery, secure browsing tools, and more, which are reserved for Bitdefender\u2019s paid products.\nOverall, Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition is a strong option for anyone who wants a set-it-and-forget-it style antivirus with solid malware protection and minimal hassle, backed by a trusted name in the antivirus market.\nRead our full Bitdefender Antivirus Free Edition review.\nBest free malware removal for feature variety\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nThe Avira Free Security Suite provides one of the most comprehensive free security packages available on the internet.\nAs well as providing the standard anti-virus protection, the Avira Free security suite also provides a software updater, as well as scanning your network for vulnerabilities and helps you fix them.\nThere are also safe browsing and safe shopping options, as well as a system optimizer to speed up your PC which is normally charged for in other packages.\nIf that's not enough, there's also a free VPN included for up to 500 MB per month, as well as a password manager (although we recommend using the best password manager for more advanced features) and privacy settings manager.\nHowever, you actually have a choice of which features you want to install. This is a great plus as while the Avira suite is generous some users may want to run one or more features through a different suite.\nThere is an upgrade option, of course, but this is priced toward installation across 5, or 25 devices, and involves such features such as removing the VPN limit.\nIf there's one negative, it's that there's no anti-ransomware protection, but aside from that the Avira Free Security Suite is a very generous package indeed.\nRead our full Avira antivirus review.\nBest free malware removal for configuration\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBacked by Avast, AVG Antivirus Free blends strong malware detection with a sleek, approachable interface that caters well to non-technical users. The app provides real-time protection against viruses, and other forms of malware.\nScans are reasonably fast, and it offers several of these including deep scans, USB scans, and performance scans. The performance scan though mainly functions as a teaser for its paid cleanup tool as many of the fixes it suggests require upgrading.\nAVG also includes web and email protection. It blocks dangerous links in browsers, warns about unsafe websites, and scans incoming and outgoing emails for malware.\nThe paid-for Pro model has more security options - it has more robust download protection, offers data encryption and includes a firewall - but the free version offers decent protection for most PC users. Most importantly though since AVG and Avast share backend technology, choosing between them often comes down to personal preference.\nRead our full AVG Antivirus Free review.\nBest free malware removal for portability\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nMost security software tries to stop malware and spyware getting onto your system. Emsisoft Emergency Kit doesn't: it's the 911 call of security software, the app you use when your PC's been poked by something unpleasant.\nUnlike traditional antivirus programs that run continuously in the background, Emsisoft Emergency Kit is entirely portable. The installation process actually just uncompressed it to a folder, which can be either on the local disk, or a portable USB one. Then you run the scanner manually. This makes the app especially useful for cleaning computers that are already compromised or sluggish due to malware.\nThe interface is minimal and utilitarian, and provides Quick, Malware, and Custom scan options. Once a scan is complete, you can quarantine or delete the detected threats.\nHowever, because it lacks real-time protection, scheduled scans, or automatic updates, the Emergency Kit is not a replacement for a primary antivirus solution. It also requires users to manually update the malware definitions, which can be a limitation if you're using it offline.\nRead our full Emsisoft Emergency Kit review.\nBest free malware removal for ease of use\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nSpybot Search & Destroy Free Edition is a long-standing anti-malware tool that specializes in detecting spyware, adware, and other privacy-invasive threats. A popular option in the early 2000s, Spybot has since evolved to include broader protection tools, though its core functionality in the free version remains focused on manual detection and removal of malware.\nThe Free Edition of Spybot is intended as a supplement to your main antivirus program, rather than a complete security solution. It doesn\u2019t offer real-time protection, automatic updates, or full antivirus capabilities. These capabilities are reserved for its paid versions.\nWhen you install the program for the first time, it asks you whether you want to manually adjust the settings or let the software automatically configure its settings. This flexibility is great for both beginners and experienced users.\nOne of its signature features, the Immunization module, modifies browser settings to prevent your system from accessing thousands of malicious or tracking websites.\nNote however that the last stable release of the app was back in 2021, and though there have been several incremental releases since, Spybot Search and Destroy isn\u2019t as regularly updated as its peers.\nRead our full Spybot Search & Destroy review.\nWe've also reviewed the best photo storage and sharing sites and the best free backup software.\nHonorable mentions\nThere are many vendors offering solutions to keep cyberattackers at bay, so that means there are a plethora of malware removal services to choose from. With that in mind, we took a look at many more tools than the ones listed above.\nHere are a few other honorable mentions that we tested and are worth considering:\n- ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware: Malware comes in many forms and ransomware is one of the most devastating. ZoneAlarm Anti-Ransomware focuses on this particular problem, detecting and eliminating ransomware attacks. It was even able to restore some of our files affected by ransomware during the detection period.\n- Webroot SecureAnywhere AntiVirus: One of Webroot's major strengths is its size. It consumes hardly any system resources because it is primarily cloud-based. Webroot monitors unknown programs, virtualizes their actions so they can\u2019t make permanent changes and decides based on that whether it's malware or not.\n- ESET NOD32: This may not be the cheapest malware removal tool on the market, nor the most user-friendly, but we did find that it delivered excellent detection results. It also works across multiple devices, with the Security Home Essential plan (starting at $59.99/year) allowing you to protect three devices per account.\n- Fortect: Although primarily a PC optimizer, Fortect also does a pretty good job at removing malware. It searches for and removes malware slowing your computer down and can even alert users if malware appears in newly downloaded files in real-time.\nBest malware removal FAQs\nWhat is malware removal?\nMalware refers to any software that is designed to disrupt the operations of your computer. It could cause many negative effects such as depriving you of access to information, leaking sensitive information to a third party, or causing your device to be unusable in its entirety.\nMalware removal is the process that scans your device to detect any malware and eliminate anyone that is found. There are specific software programs built for this process, and they make use of various processes to detect malware. Most software look for malware by checking for the signature of a known malware program on your device; the companies behind these tools have large databases of these signatures that their software runs checks against. The malware removal program scans all files on your device to detect the presence of any known signatures.\nLately, malware removal programs are also employing artificial intelligence and machine learning to fish out malware, especially the type that may get past the usual process.\nHow do I remove malware from my computer?\nThere are many guides for dealing with specific types of malware, so if you know what kind of specific malware you have, there are some handy guides on how to remove malware from your computer.\nThe easiest way, of course, is to use one of the services on our guide as they do all the hard work for you. If you're wondering how malware removal works, they often check a list of known malware variants and their likely hiding places within your system. When they conduct a scan, they will check all of the nooks and crannies that are the chosen habitats for even the most elusive of malware, and then place them in to quarantine to stop the infection.\nWhile hindsight is 20-20, the first line of defense for your device should be an antivirus service that can stop infections from happening. For example, they will warn you of malicious files hidden in downloads or email attachments.\nIs free malware removal good enough?\nFree malware removal is good for one time infections, however it is worth bearing in mind that if you've been infected once, it can always happen again. That's why having a malware removal service on hand is the best course of action. So is free malware removal worth it?\nEvery second spent trying to download another service to remove malware from your device is another potentially second spent by an attacker inside your files, photos, and personal information. Plus, paid services come with added features such as real-time scanning and protection to prevent an infection from happening in the first place.\nAnother bonus of premium malware removal services is that some will even scan your system for potentially unwanted programs that could be running in the background and slowing down your device without you knowing.\nWhat are the signs that my device is infected with malware?\nThere are several key signs that your device could be infected with malware.\nSome are fairly subtle, such as your device being slower than usual or your battery draining more quickly. Other signs that could indicate an infection include an abnormal level of data usage or the appearance of apps, browser extensions, or search engines that you don't remember installing.\nPrograms could be stuttering or crashing altogether or causing your device to overheat in normal use. You may also find than your usual security software is missing or disabled and you are locked out of your administrator account.\nThe best way to know for sure is to install a malware removal program and scanning for viruses.\nHow can I continue to keep my device secure after malware removal?\nAfter you have removed a virus, you are still just as susceptible to infection as you were before unless you use an antivirus program. There are numerous choices, such as the premium options we've ranked and reviewed in our guide to the best antivirus software, or the budget-friendly free antivirus.\nA device without any protection will be quickly infected again, as hackers use automated programs to distribute their viruses wherever they can.\nWhat does real-time scanning do?\nReal-time scanning checks common places that viruses could lurk to make sure no modifications or unwanted files have suddenly appeared.\nReal-time scanning will also check each of the files you download from the internet to check for malicious code or software hidden in otherwise legitimate downloads.\nOutside of real-time scanning, many malware removal tools and antivirus software will offer a 'deep scan' function that will check every single file on your device for malware.\nHow is malware removal different from antivirus software?\nMalware removal differs from antivirus software in several key ways.\nFirstly, malware removal is a tool most commonly used after a device has been infected to find the malicious file, isolate it, and remove it while restoring access to your device. Antivirus on the other hand is used to prevent infection in the first place.\nSecondly, malware removal sometimes doesn't offer scanning capabilities. Antivirus software will often check downloads and other online files for harmful software that could damage your device.\nFinally, malware removal is often a standalone tool, whereas antivirus software will often include a complete suite of security tools including a VPN, firewall, malware removal, antivirus, password manager, and parental control in one handy package.\nHow to choose the best malware removal tool for you\n| Header Cell - Column 0 | Paid or free? | Trial period | Compatibility |\n|---|---|---|---|\nMalwarebytes | Paid | 14 days | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nAvast | Paid | 30 days | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nTrend Micro Antivirus+ Security | Paid | 30 days | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nF-Secure SAFE | Paid | 30 days | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nBitdefender Antivirus Free | Free | N/A | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nAvira Free Security | Free | N/A | Windows, macOS |\nAVG Antivirus Free | Free | N/A | Windows, macOS, iOS, Android |\nEmsisoft Emergency Kit | Free | N/A | Windows only |\nSpyBot Search & Destroy | Free | N/A | Windows only |\nOur key buying criteria\nBudget\nMalware removal tools come in different grades. Some are free while others cost money. Among the paid ones, some are more expensive than others. Ensure you pick one that suits your budget.\nFor example, if you\u2019re a student with a tight budget, there are many free or affordable malware programs you can choose from. On the other hand, if you\u2019re a corporate worker entitled to a considerable security budget, it\u2019s wise to pick more expensive and sophisticated software. It\u2019s even more important for the latter because you might be handling sensitive data that\u2019s worth a lot to your employer; being infected by malware can cause considerable damage for corporate employees, so it\u2019s worth it to invest in a good removal program.\nEffectiveness\nA good malware removal tool should be able to detect and remove threats on your device with speed and accuracy. We don\u2019t advise this, but it\u2019s possible to test the program by deliberately infecting an unused computer with malware and seeing how good it is at identifying it. You can load many malware samples and measure how quickly each program you\u2019re testing identifies and removes the samples. Look out for important statistics like the number of files it caught and how well the program could recover a device after an infection. Another key metric is the CPU load of the software; does it consume considerable resources and slow down your computer?\nExtra Features\nMany malware removal programs include extra features to entice users. For example, some include a VPN service (virtual private network) that lets you surf the web privately and anonymously. You may also find a password manager to help you manage your online accounts or a tool that monitors the dark web for leaked credentials and reports back to you if your credentials have been compromised. Either way, it's preferable to choose a program that offers extra features than those that do not. This way, you may not have to pay separately for a VPN, password manager, etc.\nEase of Use\nIt's important for any cybersecurity program to be easy to use. Most users aren\u2019t technical people, so you must not be tech-savvy to know how to navigate your way around the program. When testing a program, try to cover all its features and see if you found it easy to navigate. If not, the program could give you problems in the future. Bitdefender was the most user-friendly out of the programs we tested, and you\u2019ll likely find it easy to use.\nCustomer Support\nThings can go wrong at any time, and you should be able to contact someone for help if that happens. A lot of cybersecurity programs have customer support teams that you can contact through email, telephone, and live chat. If you have the time, you can test multiple programs to measure their response times to support inquiries.\nNote that customer support is usually reserved for paid users which makes sense because support reps cost money to train and employ. If you\u2019re a free user, you\u2019ll likely only have access to FAQs, forums, and online communities for support, which can be also valuable.\nHow we test\nTo test for the best malware removal we first set up an account with the relevant software platform, whether as a download or as an online service.\nWe then tested the service to see how the software could be used for different purposes and in different situations. The aim was to push each platform to see how useful its basic tools were and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools.\nWe also referenced how well each platform scored for malware detection, and also for false positives.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nTested by\nMike is a lead security reviewer at Future, where he stress-tests VPNs, antivirus and more to find out which services are sure to keep you safe, and which are best avoided.\nGet in touch\n- Want to find out about commercial or marketing opportunities?

As a bonus, plans that include security tools such as antivirus or a VPN are highly recommended.\nSo, without further ado, these are my top three picks:\nIdentity theft protection: Top 3\nBest overall\nBest identity theft protection overall\nAura ticks all the boxes for identity theft protection, and offers great customer support options, a free trial, and much more, making it the best pick for most people.\nBest for families\nBest identity theft protection for families\nIdentityForce offers protection for two adults and an unlimited number of children, making it the best choice for families.\nBest for beginners\nBest identity theft protection for beginners\nExperian IdentityWorks is an easy-to-use service with extra alerts, making it the best pick for beginners - and offers excellent credit monitoring as a bonus.\nReader Offer: Save up to 78% on Aura identity theft protection\nTechRadar editors praise Aura's upfront pricing and simplicity. Aura also includes a password manager, VPN, and antivirus to make its security solution an even more compelling deal.\nPreferred partner (What does this mean?)\nBenedict has been writing about security issues for over 5 years, covering everything from international cyber incidents to ransomware attacks and data breaches. He has a profound interest in seeking out security tools that help keep people and businesses safe from cyber threats.\nThe best identity theft protection services of 2025:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest identity theft protection overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want all the bells and whistles: Aura has many features to protect your identity, and it also comes with a VPN, antivirus, and a password manager to boot.\n\u2705 You want to block unwanted calls: Its Call Assistant is included in all family plans, using AI to filter spam and scam calls for you.\n\u274c You're on a budget: Aura can be quite expensive, so cheaper alternatives such as ADT Identity Protection may be a better option if you're on a budget.\n\ud83d\udd12 Aura is a very comprehensive package that offers everything you'd need and more to protect you and your family's identity online. The more premium plans can be quite expensive, though. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nAura has made impressive strides to establish itself as one of the best identity theft protection service. Offering all the critical features you'd expect\u2014including $1 million insurance to cover the costs of identity restoration\u2014it simplifies the protection process through both basic and advanced functionalities.\nPartnering with Experian, Aura provides a credit lock feature for easy credit monitoring and a credit score tracker to monitor your progress over time. The platform features an updated graph that displays your credit score and offers personalized improvement tips. A central control panel lets you monitor your credit score, access identity theft protection tools, and safeguard your children's credit. I found this feature particularly useful for tracking which payments were causing the biggest changes in my credit score.\nAdditionally, Aura allows you to monitor your investment and bank accounts, set transaction limits, and guard your accounts against fraud attempts. It continuously scans the web for potential security breaches, automatically changes passwords, and combats tax refund fraud.\nREAD MORE ABOUT AURA \u25bc\nAura's proactive monitoring extends to data brokers, junk mail providers, and spam sources, with the option to remove your data from these entities. It keeps you informed through comprehensive alerts delivered via email or SMS. The Safe Browsing extension enhances web security, and the credit monitoring service provides a holistic package for protecting your identity.\nAura's pricing is tiered: individual, couples, and family. The individual tier is the most budget-friendly, while the couples and family tiers, though pricier, offer more extensive data tracking and unlimited child coverage\u2014ideal for larger families.\nThe recent design update has made it easier to access needed information with just a few clicks. While Aura focuses mainly on identity theft, bonus features require a bit more navigation. I particularly recommend Aura for its user-friendly interface and organized content, which made it easy to find what I was looking for, with help readily available on most screens and 24/7 support for additional assistance.\nI found the web interface to be modern and professional, and both desktop and mobile applications are well-designed. However, the Mac version could use more refinement. Aura's additional online security features should be seen as bonuses\u2014they don't offer the level of protection found in dedicated antivirus software or VPNs, but I found that Aura effectively covers basic security needs. The parental control app is outstanding, and the password manager, though improved, may still lag behind some free options.\nWhile Aura isn't the cheapest identity theft solution, I believe its comprehensive features and thoughtful pricing make it competitive. Flexible pricing plans and thorough protection ensure that Aura is a solid choice for those seeking identity theft protection services. Ultimately, the best option depends on your individual needs and budget.\nRead our full Aura review.\nBest identity theft protection for families\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You have a big family: IdentityForce supports an unlimited number of children, and has an add-on called ChildWatch that keeps you abreast of concerns relating to your child's identity.\n\u2705 You want to get rid of junk mail: IdentityForce has a useful junk mail opt-out feature that can save your inbox from getting clogged with useless spam.\n\u274c You want regular credit reports: Credit reports are only given each quarter with IdentityForce, so not great if you want to stay on top of your score.\n\u274c You want a good mobile app: Looking at the user reviews, both the iPhone and Android apps appear to need some improvement.\n\ud83d\udd12 IdentityForce provides multiple features including credit monitoring, bank fraud protection, and efficient ad and malware blocking, plus $1 million in insurance coverage. While the higher-tier plan provides broader protection, it does incur a higher monthly fee. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nIdentityForce provides identity theft protection services to individuals, families, and government organizations. The basic plan includes social media monitoring and a feature to eliminate junk mail. The top-tier plan adds credit monitoring from the three main credit bureaus, support for freezing your credit to prevent unauthorized accounts being opened in your name, and alerts for investment accounts.\nIn my testing, I found that the one big downside to IdentityForce is that credit reports are only delivered quarterly. It is also not the most affordable identity protection service available, though it does offer a 30-day free trial. If you prefer a cheaper alternative that also provides 3-bureau credit reporting and robust family protection, Complete ID is worth considering, especially for Costco members who are eligible for discounts. However, I found that Complete ID's interface is not as user-friendly as IdentityForce's.\nThe IdentityForce family plan offers additional child protection features, such as ChildWatch, and coverage for an unlimited number of children, making it my recommendation for large families.\nRead our full IdentityForce review.\n- To speak to an expert about how identity theft protection software can keep you secure online, call IdentityForce directly on this toll-free number 888-266-3930.\nBest identity theft protection for beginners\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want good credit monitoring: As expected of an Experian company, credit monitoring is offered by Experian itself, along with Equifax and TransUnion, ensuring comprehensive credit monitoring services.\n\u274c You want to cancel easily: IdentityWorks does offer a free week-long trial, but you have to buy it first, then cancel if you want your money back.\n\u274c You want apps: There are no mobile apps for IdentityWorks, so if these are important to you, then Aura, Norton LifeLock and myFICO are better choices.\n\ud83d\udd12 Experian IdentityWorks provides reliable credit monitoring, as one would anticipate from the company, but it falls short in other areas. The absence of mobile applications and a stringent cancellation policy may deter potential users from choosing this service.\u2605\u2605\u26051/2\nExperian IdentityWorks serves as an alluring gateway into the realm of identity protection. With its longstanding reputation in credit reporting, Experian extends its expertise to provide comprehensive credit monitoring services. This encompasses all three prominent credit bureaus: Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. By leveraging this expansive coverage, Experian IdentityWorks ensures that your credit information is meticulously scrutinized and protected.\nThe credit monitoring feature offered by Experian IdentityWorks enables you to keep a watchful eye on your credit reports, promptly detecting any suspicious activities or unauthorized changes. This proactive approach allows you to address potential threats swiftly, minimizing the risk of fraud or identity theft. Additionally, Experian IdentityWorks provides regular credit score updates, which were super helpful to help keep on top of my financial well-being and offered advice on making informed decisions regarding credit management.\nBeyond credit monitoring, Experian IdentityWorks offers an array of robust identity protection features. It includes dark web monitoring, which scans the hidden corners of the internet where personal information may be compromised or sold.\nREAD MORE ABOUT IDENTITYWORKS \u25bc\nThis feature helps safeguard your sensitive data from falling into the wrong hands and alerts you if any of your personal information is discovered on the dark web. In my testing, I was alerted to 8 potential data breaches that contained one of my emails (yikes).\nExperian IdentityWorks also provides identity theft insurance, offering financial protection in the unfortunate event that you become a victim of identity theft. This insurance coverage can assist with expenses related to restoring your identity, such as legal fees, lost wages, and fraudulent charges.\nWith this service, you get daily reporting and scoring, alerts for significant changes, and dark web monitoring to see if your personal data is exposed online. While the most basic plan is free, it includes minimal features like an Experian credit report, FICO score tracker, and dark web surveillance.\nThe premium plans offer a more comprehensive suite of features including three-bureau credit monitoring, alerts, and assistance in removing your personal info from certain people finder sites, making it one of the best identity theft protection services for beginners.\nRead our full Experian IdentityWorks review.\nBest identity theft protection package\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want great antivirus: Norton is perhaps best known to many for its comprehensive 360 antivirus suite, which is included with LifeLock.\n\u2705 You want other extras: A VPN and a password manager are also included with LifeLock.\n\u274c You want clear pricing: We found the pricing for LifeLock to be quite confusing, and prices even rise after the first year.\n\ud83d\udd12 Norton LifeLock is a good package, complete with the company's industry-leading antivirus suite, plus a VPN and password manager. The pricing isn't something we are too sure of, though. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nNorton's renowned 360 antivirus suite has solidified its position as a widely recognized name in the digital security landscape. However, Norton's capabilities extend far beyond antivirus protection. The LifeLock bundle takes Norton's security offerings to the next level, combining the robust antivirus suite with a comprehensive identity theft protection package.\nAt the core of LifeLock's identity theft protection lies its advanced monitoring system. This system continuously scans the dark web, credit reports, and other sensitive data sources for any signs of suspicious activity. In the event of a detected threat, such as unauthorized access to personal information or attempts at identity fraud, LifeLock promptly notifies the user, allowing for swift action to mitigate potential damage.\nFurthermore, LifeLock's identity restoration services provide invaluable assistance in the event of identity theft. Dedicated restoration specialists work closely with affected individuals to resolve identity-related issues, including restoring credit scores, removing fraudulent accounts, and contacting government agencies and financial institutions.\nREAD MORE ABOUT LIFELOCK \u25bc\nBeyond antivirus protection and identity theft protection, LifeLock also includes a password manager and a VPN. The password manager simplifies the task of creating and managing unique, strong passwords for each online account. This eliminates the need to reuse passwords, a common security vulnerability.\nThe VPN, or virtual private network, encrypts internet traffic, ensuring secure and private online communication. This feature is particularly beneficial when using public Wi-Fi networks or accessing sensitive information online.\nBy combining these powerful security tools into a single package, LifeLock provides users with an unparalleled level of protection against a wide range of cyber threats. Its comprehensive offerings encompass antivirus protection, identity theft protection, password management, and VPN services, making it an exceptional choice for individuals seeking the best overall security package.\nWhile the basic plan may lack some compared to the best identity theft protection services, it offers up to $1 million in identity theft coverage\u2014a baseline among many services. The plan includes easy-to-use credit locking and firm support if you lose your wallet or encounter identity fraud. However, LifeLock's pricing can be confusing, and prices rise after the first year. LifeLock offers three plans, with the basic one starting at $9.90 per month.\nRead our full Norton LifeLock review.\nBest identity theft protection for affordability\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a package of protection: McAfee Plus is a total package of services for online protection.\n\u2705 You want a top antivirus: As a antivirus provider, McAfee+ comes with one of the best antivirus solutions on the market.\n\u2705 You want to rid the web of your data: A full service personal data cleanup is offered on all plans.\n\u274c You want to pay monthly: McAfee+ identity protection can only be purchased as an annual plan.\n\u274c You just want more basic identity protection: The higher price of McAfee Plus, and the annual only payments may be more than some users want to spend for their identity protection.\n\ud83d\udd12 McAfee+ offers a great identity theft protection package for individuals and families. The name makes it easier to trust, but the lack of monthly payment options means it is not a flexible option. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nMcAfee Plus, a comprehensive security solution, safeguards your digital life from various online threats.

Our top pick, Aura, offers credit monitoring from the triumvirate even on its basic plan.\n\ud83d\udd12 Allstate provides good social media profile monitoring tools, but the lack of credit monitoring on the lower plans is a drawback. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nAllstate comes close to being one of the best identity theft protection services. Social media monitoring is included, along with the obligatory credit monitoring. However, on the latter, you only get monitoring from one agency - TransUnion - on the basic plans; you need to opt for the most expensive plan to get monitoring from Experian and Equifax too.\nThere are three plans in total, all of which offer financial fraud protection and identity monitoring. In addition to coverage for expenses you incur dealing with fraud - which maxes out at $2m for the top family plans - there is also a stolen fund reimbursement available up to a million dollars for the top tier plan, as well as 401K/HSA reimbursement up to $1m too.\nThis top plan also offers cybersecurity for your devices and something called family digital safety, which allows you to monitor content, manage screen time, and set location alerts for your loved ones.\nRead our full Allstate review.\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want FICO scores: As you might expect, FICO scores are a given with myFICO. So if you rely on these, then this could be a good option for you.\n\u2705 You want a good UI: the interface and the apps for myFICO are nicely presented, making it easier to navigate your way around them.\n\u274c You are on a budget: myFICO has no annual plans, making it one of the more expensive options out there.\n\u274c You want more identity protection features: Identity protection only comes with the more premium plans on myFICO. There are also no family plans.\n\ud83d\udd12 myFICO is a great service for those who want good credit monitoring and FICO scores, and there is no cap on wages lost either. But identity protection features are only available with the premium plans, and families aren't catered for, as they are with services like Aura. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nmyFICO gives you regular updates on your credit scores, and naturally this includes your FICO scores, which give you valuable knowledge as to what financial institutions look for when determining your creditworthiness. I also found the UI to be user friendly for desktop and mobile apps, making it easy to navigate.\nThe basic plan only covers credit score updates, while the Premier and Advanced plans give you identity protection features. You can also buy a single report for your FICO score if you wish, without having to commit to a subscription.\nHowever, I found that one of the glaring omissions from myFICO is the lack of family plans, and the premium plans are quite expensive. However, for those plans, claims for wage losses are uncapped (other services usually top out at $7,500). You can also get assistance with travel expenses and getting new documents, such as a passport or driving license. MyFICO is also underwritten by the American Bankers Insurance Company of Florida.\nRead our full myFico review.\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to know where your data is: Bitdefender Digital Identity Protection is excellent for monitoring your digital footprint and tracking down where your data is.\n\u274c You want more than identity theft protection: Bitdefender Digital Identity Protection offers little else in terms of security, lacking antivirus, VPN, and credit monitoring.\n\ud83d\udd12 Bitdefender Digital Identity Protection offers good digital footprint monitoring and is great at tracking down your data. However it does not offer a family plan, nor does it offer the range of security features that you can get from its competitors. \u2605\u2605\u2605\nBitdefender is an award winning name in the security world, however I can't help but feel let down by its offering for identity theft protection.\nTo start, there is no offer for family protection, limiting the plan to a single user which can quickly get expensive if bought for a whole household. Moreover, you aren't getting the same level of security and privacy protection as your do for other services at a similar price. The fact that Bitdefender offers standalone antivirus and VPN solutions, but does not include these as standard is curious.\nIf Bitdefender were to include more of its range of robust cybersecurity products within its plan, it may just make it on to our list of recommended identity theft protection solutions. Until then, however, it will have to remain as an honorable mention.\nProtect your devices with our Bitdefender coupons.

If any of these accounts are compromised, your sensitive details, including banking information, address, and potentially information about friends and family, could be stolen.\nConsidering the numerous accounts you have online, from banking and credit cards to social media and more, it's easy to understand why cybercriminals are so determined to steal and sell data.\nEffective identity theft protection services can alert you to potential breaches, identify compromised accounts, and monitor your digital footprint for signs of stolen information. They also often include credit monitoring to detect suspicious activity like fraudulent loans or credit cards opened in your name.\nBy receiving timely alerts, you can take swift action to cancel cards, amend accounts, and notify banks about fraudulent activity. Many identity theft protection services offer assistance throughout this process.\nHow does identity theft happen?\n\"Identity has become the key to accessing a wide range of goods and services, and in turn, has become a prime target for malicious actors,\" says Mike Tuchen, CEO of Onfido.\n\"Fraudsters are targeting unsuspecting individuals, convincing them to reveal personal information so they can impersonate them. Sophisticated fraudsters are even attempting to hack into identity databases that store the personal information of millions of consumers.\"\n\"It\u2019s no wonder that the frequency of data breaches has increased exponentially. In fact, in 2022 alone, identity theft reached a staggering $42 billion in the US,\" Tuchen concludes.\nIdentity theft is a growing concern due to technological advancements and sophisticated tactics employed by cybercriminals.\nData breaches, often resulting from ransomware attacks, are a common source of compromised personal information. When organizations choose not to pay ransoms, cybercriminals may sell stolen data on the dark web.\nThis stolen data can be used to access existing accounts or create fraudulent accounts for activities like obtaining loans and defaulting on them, leaving victims liable for the costs.\nWhat types of identity theft are there?\nFinancial Fraud: They may access your bank accounts, apply for fraudulent loans and credit cards in your name, and transfer funds to their own accounts. To protect against this, credit monitoring is essential.\nTax Fraud: Criminals can file false tax returns using your personal information. The IRS will typically contact you to investigate and inform you of the suspicious activity.\nHealthcare Fraud: They may use your medical insurance to cover their treatments, prescriptions, or claims. If you suspect this is happening, contact your healthcare provider to verify your medical records and dispute any unauthorized charges.\nHow can I identify signs of identity theft and protect my personal information?\nThere are several warning signs to watch out for that may indicate your identity has been compromised. One of the most common signs is suspicious charges or bills on your financial accounts. Another red flag is being contacted by debt collectors seeking payment for unknown debts. Cybercriminals are known for their cunning, so don't overlook seemingly small or unusual charges as they could be testing your vigilance.\nIn the event of a potential identity theft, prompt action is crucial. Contacting the appropriate organizations, placing locks on your credit, and setting up fraud alerts in your name are essential steps to safeguard your accounts and protect yourself from becoming a victim of identity theft. These measures help secure your financial information, minimize the risk of unauthorized access, and keep you informed of any suspicious activity.\nWhile some signs of identity theft may be evident, others are more discreet. For instance, not receiving a regular monthly bill or statement could signal that someone has altered the mailing address associated with your account. Signs of identity theft include new accounts opened in your name and a sudden drop in your credit score. These actions can indicate unauthorized access to your personal information.\nWhat are the steps to take to prevent my identity from being stolen?\nThe most effective way to protect yourself from identity theft is to take proactive measures. Strong cybersecurity practices are essential. This includes using unique, complex passwords and considering a reliable password manager to streamline password management, as well as using an authenticator app to ensure it is definitely you logging in to your accounts\nIf you suspect identity theft, take immediate action. Report the incident to both law enforcement and the affected organizations, such as financial institutions. Dispute unauthorized charges and place fraud alerts on your personal information.\nProtect your credit by freezing your credit report with all three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Freezing your credit prevents criminals from opening new accounts in your name.\nIf you would like more information about identity theft protection, take a look at our 5 tips for avoiding identity theft, as well as our guide on free identity theft protection.\nShould I get identity theft protection?\nFrom tiny tots to wise seniors, identity theft is an equal opportunity offender that shows no signs of slowing down. Protect yourself and your loved ones by considering these seven groups that could benefit from identity theft protection:\n1. Digital Doers - Anyone who spends a significant amount of time online or has numerous financial accounts is at higher risk for identity theft. Every account is a potential point of attack, so be wary of suspicious activity or messages.\n2. Senior Savers - Older Americans may have more money saved, but they're also less tech-savvy, making them prime targets for identity thieves.\n3. Family Firsts - Children and teens with clean credit histories can be attractive targets for fraudsters. Keep them safe by signing up for a family identity theft protection plan.\n4. Repeat Victims - If you've been hit by identity theft once, you're more likely to be targeted again. Stay ahead of the curve with reliable protection.\n5. Busy Bees - If you don't have the time to monitor your accounts constantly, identity theft protection services can help.\n6. Insurance Insureds - Don't risk losing everything. Protect your home, savings, and credit score with an identity theft insurance policy.\n7. Dark Web Dwellers - After a data breach, your account credentials could be floating around on hacker forums. Use Identity Guard's Dark Web scanner to keep an eye on any potential leaks.\nRemember, the more accounts you have, the more important it is to keep your identity safe.\nIs identity theft protection worth it?\nIf you frequently shop online and have shared your personal information with various online retailers, identity theft protection is a valuable investment.\nThese services continuously monitor your credit reports for signs of identity theft, offering a level of protection that traditional security software often lacks.\nThe decision ultimately depends on how much you value your identity and the lengths you're willing to go to protect it. While our guide includes more affordable options, they may not offer the same comprehensive features and protection as premium services.\nIt's important to note that according to the FTC, $10 billion was lost to fraud in the US alone in 2023. The costs associated with identity theft can be significant, making proactive protection a worthwhile consideration.\nIdentity Theft Protection vs Monitoring Services: What's the difference?\nAlthough identity theft protection and monitoring services have similarities, there is a significant distinction. Monitoring services primarily focus on providing insights into your credit rating and sending notifications if it changes. However, they offer limited protection for safeguarding your identity beyond this aspect.\nIdentity theft protection services go beyond to offer comprehensive safeguards. They actively monitor the dark web for your personal information, including sensitive details like Social Security numbers. In addition to detecting potential threats, many services provide insurance to cover financial losses resulting from identity theft. They also offer expert guidance and best practices to help you protect your identity and minimize risks.\nIf you would like to learn more about the differences, we have a dedicated guide to the differences between credit monitoring, credit protection, and identity theft protection services.\nHow to choose the best identity theft protection services\nWhen choosing an identity theft protection service, these are the key factors you should consider to help you find the right service for your needs:\n\u2022 Monitoring: Determining which aspects of your digital life require monitoring for you and your family is crucial. While many services offer credit report monitoring, not all of them do. Additional essential checks to consider include criminal and court records, as well as bank accounts. The speed and quality of alerts provided by these services will significantly impact their effectiveness.\n\u2022 Family protection: Whether you require individual protection or family coverage. If you reside with children who possess online devices, a family plan is recommended, as it extends protection to them. Bear in mind that family plans tend to be more costly compared to individual plans.\n\u2022 Customer support: In the event of identity theft, where prompt action is crucial, the quality of customer service and the user-friendliness of the service itself become paramount. To provide comprehensive information, we have thoroughly evaluated the services listed in this guide and detailed their performance across various fronts. Additionally, we highly recommend reading customer reviews when selecting any service or product, as they offer valuable insights and experiences from real users.\n\u2022 Insurance: Review your insurance policies to determine the extent of coverage you have in case of identity theft and associated financial losses. We have included this information, when available, in our recommendations for the top identity theft protection services.\n\u2022 Price: When considering identity theft protection services, it's crucial to factor in the price. Family plans are often more expensive than individual ones, and be wary of services that raise their charges after the initial year.\nYou can also read our in-depth guide on how to choose the best identity theft protection service for you.\nFeature | Aura | IdentityForce | Experian | Norton | McAfee+ | IDShield | Incogni |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\nPrice (per month) | $9 - $24 | $19.90 - $34.90 | $9.99 | $7.50 - $32.99 | $14.17 - $22.50 | $14.95 - $29.95 | $7.49 - $32.98 |\nInsurance | $1 million per adult | $1 million | $500,000 - $1 million | $1 million | $1 million | $1 million | $1 million |\nFamily Plan | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |\nCredit monitoring | Yes | Yes (on higher tiers) | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |\nDark web monitoring | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |\nAntivirus | Yes | No | No | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |\nVPN | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | No |\nHow we tested the best identity theft protection\nOur reviews of the identity protection apps in this guide looked at the features they offer, as well as their value for money and how well they compare to one another.\nIt is important to note that we did not deliberately compromise our own personal accounts and sensitive information to see how well each identity theft protection service worked.\nInstead, we made our choices based on each service's reputation, as well as a desire to include those with differing features, use cases and pricing. We were also on the look out for services that provided additional features, such as dark web monitoring, VPNs, password managers, antivirus, and credit monitoring at the best price. Customer support was also a key factor for deciding the top results, and services that offer a free trial or a discount if purchased annually were also a bonus.\nRead how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nWhen choosing the best identity theft protection, I recommend keeping these key features in mind:\n- Identity Theft Insurance: should be at least $1 million per adult\n- Credit Monitoring: very important for spotting the early signs of identity theft, such as credit fraud or score fluctuations\n- Family Plan: protection should be offered on a family plan to keep everyone protected\n- Dark Web Monitoring: your details can crop up on data breach sites before your identity is stolen, so dark web monitoring is essential\n- Antivirus: if your credentials are stolen, antivirus software can protect your devices from hackers looking to install snooping software or malware\n- VPN: helps to keep your internet traffic encrypted and hidden from hackers looking to steal your data\n- Customer Support: identity theft can happen at any time, so support should be offered on a 24/7 basis\nWhen ranking the best identity theft protection, I pay particular attention to the features that matter, such as insurance coverage, breadth of credit monitoring, and other security tools such as a VPN and antivirus services. Customer support is also a priority feature I consider to ensure that victims of identity theft can get the help they need immediately.\nTested by\nJohn's tech journalism career spans decades, and during that time he has covered many stories related to identity theft and reviewed numerous protection services.

Its real-time protection is even enabled from the get-go.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You want quick scans: initial and deep scans take almost an hour to complete (five times longer than other antivirus on average). Thankfully, you'll still be able to work, play, and browse when they're running.\n\u274c You need identity theft monitoring: Bitdefender has some monitoring tools to track online identities, but for real round-the-clock protection from identity theft, you'll want to check out Norton.\n\u274c You're already infected with malware: Bitdefender isn't as effective when it comes to removing threats already attacking your system. For current infections, try Malwarebytes.\nOur thoughts:\nBitdefender is more than just antivirus software - it can be a life security suite depending on the plan you choose. It consistently impresses with its ability to identify threats and stop them in their tracks and has scored very highly in our own testing and testing done by third-party laboratories.\nBitdefender Total Security includes parental controls, a VPN, vulnerability scanner, and a dedicated browser.

In our testing it detected all our sample files, and has consistent high sores across independent testing labs.\nNorton 360 with Lifelock goes beyond Norton's award winning malware protection and includes comprehensive identity theft protection - complete with insurance, credit monitoring, and identity & SSN alerts. If you are looking for family protection, you can protect up to 10 devices, store precious memories in the generous cloud backup, and use parental controls to ensure your children are safe online.\n\u25b6 Try Norton 360 with LifeLock and get a 60-day money-back guarantee\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\ud83d\udd12 Norton excels when it comes to basic malware protection and offers some awesome advanced tools\u2014like its LifeLock identity theft monitoring service.

McAfee has a solid reputation for antivirus protection, and consistently scores top marks.\nMcAfee+ goes beyond simple antivirus protection and includes a firewall, password manager, file shredder and unlimited VPN all in just the basic tier. The mobile apps are well crafted and easy to use, making it a top choice for those who want protection on the go. You can also use the Online Account Cleanup tool to check if any of your online accounts are having their data hoovered up by less than reputable sites, and help you delete them.\n\u25b6 Try McAfee+ with its 30 day money back guarantee\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd\n\ud83d\udd12 McAfee is undoubtedly expensive, but earns its spot in my top picks with standout mobile apps, advanced features, and its prioritization of identity protection.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Excellent protection and plenty of extra tools to help keep you secure | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Infrequent lagging, but not enough to interrupt what you're working on | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Mobile apps are pretty straightforward to use, desktop is a bit overwhelming when you first use it | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Many tools focus on protecting your identity including a VPN and personal data cleanup, but how well they work depends on what you're willing to pay | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Decent FAQs section on its website, and a support community, live chat is with a Virtual Assistant and not a live agent | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | One of the most expensive antivirus programs, but you can use it on any number of devices | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full McAfee review here.\nBest for Wi-Fi security\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You have a lot of smart devices: F-Secure has one of the best network protection tools to secure every gadget connected to your home internet.\n\u2714\ufe0f You value speed: scans balance speed with thoroughness without sacrificing either.\n\u2714\ufe0f You need a VPN: the F-Secure VPN does have its limitations, but it's a useful tool to have in a pinch.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You're new to antivirus: the dashboard is very text-heavy, which can be overwhelming, and it's not the easiest tool to install.\n\u274c You need Chromebook protection: unfortunately, F-Secure doesn't offer a Chromebook app\u2014meaning you'll have to look elsewhere.\n\u274c You don't want to be slowed down: you might experience slower load times when opening programs or browsing the web, leading to serious frustration.\nOur thoughts:\nI frequently write about smart devices being taken over by hackers, so F-Secure is a sight for sore eyes in this respect. While F-Secure doesn't quite rival the scores of other antivirus in testing - and occasionally throws up a few false alarms - it provides great protection for edge, IoT, and smart devices connected to your Wi-Fi network.\nOne of the standout features of F-Secure Total is the 24/7 live and remote support that can help you with any bugs or glitches you might experience - something very few providers offer. The network protection can even protect your on unsecured public networks while the built-in VPN keeps your traffic encrypted and private.\n\u25b6 Try F-Secure Total for 30 days free\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\ud83d\udd12 F-secure takes some getting used to, but all of the most important security and privacy tools are there\u2014including incredible network protection and 24/7 live support.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Excellent malware blocking and protects smart devices connected to your home network | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Some slowdown when launching programs or navigating the web | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Not the easiest to figure out, but the tutorials do help | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Not as many tools as other antivirus software, but the ones included are helpful | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Live support is available including remote support for difficult issues | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | First-time users get a great bargain, but the price jumps higher on renewal | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full F-Secure review here.\nBest for ad blocking\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You want a reliable ad-blocker: Avira includes a handy ad blocker to keep your browsing fast and hassle free.\n\u2714\ufe0f You'd like to try before buying: Avira's free plan is limited, but gives you a good taste of what to expect if you choose to upgrade.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want configurability: Avira gives users plenty of ways to tailor their security experience.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You use a lot of locally saved apps: during my testing, I found that Avira causes apps to launch more slowly.\n\u274c You need mobile protection: most of Avira's packages aren't available for mobile devices\u2014and those that are have a hefty price tag.\n\u274c You want optimal PC performance: Avira has a tendency to take a bit out of your device performance.\nOur thoughts:\nAvira performs really well in testing, being able to detect our own bespoke EICAR files and performing well against existing and new threats in tests done by third parties.\nA standout point is the included ad blocker which significantly improves web page load times and general user experience. Avira Internet Security also includes a handy bargain hunting tool to help you get the best deals when shopping online. While it does include a system optimizer tool and PUA shield to reduce PC slowdown, it does tend to take up a few more resources than we would like - but overall it is a solid antivirus solution.\n\u25b6 Try Avira antivirus for free\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\ud83d\udd12 Avira has a lot of handy tools that can be configured down to the last detail and a free plan you can use to try before you buy\u2014however, it's not the best pick for mobile devices.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | No problem stopping both known and new malware threats | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Slower at loading webpages and downloading software | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Dark mode interface that is intuitively laid out, but most tools, including ransomware protections, have to be turned on | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Includes some good advanced security tools, but not enough to be compared with other \"internet security\" suites | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Some basic help articles are online, the only way to contact a live agent is through the email form | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | Decent price point and has a monthly subscription available | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full Avira review here.\nBest for gamers\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You want the best malware protection: Avast came out on top in all of our malware-blocking tests.\n\u2714\ufe0f Gaming is your priority: block untrustworthy incoming connections with a handy gaming mode\u2014which is enabled by default.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want to try before buying: Avast's free plan has its limitations, but effectively showcases the product's capabilities.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You don't want to delete unwanted apps: Avast will do its very best to install its own internet browser and make it your new default, which is slightly frustrating.\n\u274c You need better VPN access: depending on your plan, you might experience bandwidth caps and a limited choice of servers\n\u274c You need clear warnings: at times, unwarranted warnings can pop up with no clear way to stop them\nOur thoughts:\nAvast is one of the best performing antivirus software providers, scoring top marks in our testing and achieving impressive results in testing performed by the third party pros.\nAvast One is designed to be a simple all-in-one app that does everything it says on the tin, and if you want it to do more, it can. The app automatically goes into gaming mode so that you can squeeze all the performance you need out of your device without your security taking a hit. Avast One comes with more features than I can list, but some notable inclusion are dark web monitoring, scam detection, and an advanced firewall to keep hackers out of your network.\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\ud83d\udd12 Avast One is a malware-blocking powerhouse that stops threats dead in their tracks.

In our own testing (and independent testing), it scored in the middle ground of what I would expect.\nBut, as I said, if you currently have malware lurking on your device then Malwarebytes is a solid tool for getting rid of it - and what Malwarebytes lacks in testing scores, it makes up for in features. The software will provide real time protection reports, scam protection, and even includes AI-powered protection. Some features are only available on the Windows app however.\n\u25b6 Get Malwarebytes free edition\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd\n\ud83d\udd12 Malwarebytes excels at removing malware already on your device, but can fall short in real-time protection.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Not as effective at blocking malware as it is at removing current infections | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Fairly light on resources, so not a problem to run it in the background | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Basic use is easy to figure out, but it gets harder when you need to customize settings | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Doesn't have the level of advanced features we'd expect in a Pro program | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | All support links redirect you to its extensive knowledgebase rather than provide live support options right away | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | Monthly subscription prices are about right for what is offered | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full Malwarebytes review here.\nBest for Mac\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You're a Mac user: Intego is designed specifically for Mac machines.\n\u2714\ufe0f You need parental controls: you won't find many other antivirus solutions for Mac that include configurable parental controls.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want to boost your Mac performance: Intego's Mac Washing Machine can spot vulnerable software and old apps and help clear them up.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You need mobile protection: unfortunately, this antivirus offering is only available for desktops.\n\u274c You're looking for powerful extras: Intego doesn't have the quantity, or quality, of advanced features as our other picks.\n\u274c You have a mixed device household: households with a mix of different operating systems won't all benefit from the same plan.\nOur thoughts:\nIntego scores well in testing across the board and is specially built to be friendly to Mac machines. In fact, it offers a Mac Washing Machine tool to keep your device free of vulnerable and outdated applications that could be a potential virus entry point.\nOutside of scoring though, there is a bit of a downside. Each of the five security applications included in the Intego Mac Premium Bundle X9 has to be installed individually, and while this is great for those looking to pick and choose what parts they use, many of the other providers have a single app that includes all the various protection tools. If you don't mind taking the time to install them, Intego makes an excellent Mac protection antivirus.\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u00bd\n\ud83d\udd12 Intego is a great pick for Mac machines, and can clean up your system to keep it running efficiently.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Misses a few threats, but does score higher than average for malware detection | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | We noticed a bit of lag with the app itself, but it didn't seem to affect our working and browsing too much | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | Each tool is a separate download with its own dashboard making it harder to navigate the entire package | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | A bit limited, but the system cleaner and parental controls are effective | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Lots of pages to navigate through the find the support email form, live chat is sometimes available | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | It's expensive, other Mac antivirus is available for cheaper and with more tools | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full Intego review here.\nBest for banking\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nUse if:\n\u2714\ufe0f You bank or shop online: PayGuard, Trend Micro's secure banking feature, is one of the best in the industry.\n\u2714\ufe0f You want web protection: Trend Micro has a robust URL blocker that will warn you if you stumble across a dangerous site.\n\u2714\ufe0f You don't want too many bells and whistles: Trend Micro offers a simple antivirus software without any overwhelming tools and options.\nDon't use if:\n\u274c You're an avid gamer: Trend Micro has a noticeable impact on device performance, and can interrupt gameplay (and streaming.)\n\u274c You want to customize your experience: if you're looking for an antivirus solution you can customize, you're better off with Bitdefender.\n\u274c You are looking for more than just antivirus: Trend Micro lacks the extra features to protect more than just your device.\nOur thoughts:\nTrend Micro sits in the middle ground in terms of antivirus protection, both in our own testing and testing done by the independent labs, but is near-unrivaled when it comes to banking protection.\nTrend Micro Antivirus+ Security offers a tool known as PayGuard, which helps keeps payments made through your browser secure and out of the clutches of any hackers that could be lurking online.

You get antivirus protection for one device, plus a firewall, banking protection, and a network shield to protect internet connected devices. So if you're looking for a feature-rich package, you will have to opt for the highest tier subscription. If you do, you can access an unlimited VPN, identity protection, and a password manager - but keep in mind many other brands provide these without breaking the bank.\n\u25b6 Try ESET Internet Security for 30 days free\nBottom line: \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\n\ud83d\udd12 ESET is easy to install, though a little more difficult to figure out once it's up and running. Plus, some important security features are reserved for its most expensive product.\nFeatures | Notes | Rating |\n|---|---|---|\nProtection | Slightly below average of the industry average in some independent tests, doesn't include new threat detection in all programs | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nPerformance | Definitely can feel the lag when using this antivirus | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nEase of use | The interface feels outdated with a lot of text that gives it an overwhelming, busy look | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nAdvanced tools | Missing some important tools like a password manager and data encryption, but the number of security features is impressive | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nCustomer support | Not the easiest to find answers to questions and even harder to figure out how to get a hold of a live person | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nValue | An overall good deal, though we wish more was included | \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 |\nRead our full ESET review here.\nTechRadar's antivirus rankings\nThere are more antivirus solutions on the market than we can count\u2014but only ten spots in our list of favorites. Below, you can check out our rankings at a glance, including some honorable mentions that just missed out on a spot in our shortlist.\nProvider | Summary |\n|---|---|\n1. Bitdefender | Sets the standard for all antivirus to reach for |\n2. Norton | Good protection and great identity theft services |\n3. Avast | Easy to use, great advanced security, excellent gaming mode |\n4. McAfee | Good for mobile, and decent on other devices, too, but expensive |\n5. F-Secure | Protects smart devices, such as TVs and Amazon Echo connected to your network |\n6. Trend Micro | Good protections for banking and shopping online |\n7. AVIRA | Decent tools with a good free antivirus available |\n8. ESET | Okay for basic protection, but feels outdated and falls behind better options |\n9. Malwarebytes | Not the best as a first defender malware blocker, but is excellent at removing threats already on your device |\n10. Intego | Specifically designed for Mac computers, does well at blocking threats, but awkward to use |\nHow to choose antivirus software\nHow do you decide on just one antivirus solution when there are dozens of viable candidates out there? The obvious answer is to consult our rankings\u2014our shortlist is the result of pooled expert knowledge, in-house testing, third-party security labs testing, and thorough, continually updated reviews of the top antivirus players.\nPerhaps more importantly, however, you need to consider your own needs and use case. Do you have a ton of devices to protect? Do you need advanced features or specific tools? Do you want a service with a built-in VPN to save money on subscription fees?\nThese considerations will vary from person to person and might mean that our number one pick isn't your match made in heaven. Our recommendations can point you in the direction of some stellar options, but you'll need to modify these based on your individual requirements.\nFor more thoughts on this, check out our article exploring how to choose the best antivirus.\nHow we test antivirus software - our review methodology\nTo get a clear, accurate, and thorough picture of each antivirus, I take a multi-faceted approach to my testing\u2014and I make sure I get hands-on experience with each product.\nThanks to our team's background in IT, we're able to create malware files for specific use in testing environments. We keep these files on a short leash and let them wreak a little havoc\u2014nothing that we can't control, of course\u2014but this is an important part of the process, seeing as they're new threats that no antivirus software will be familiar with.\nLots of antivirus developers provide a test file called 'EICAR' that simulates a threat that isn't a threat. The problem with relying on this file during testing is that antivirus companies have made sure that their software recognizes it. Using our own bespoke malware helps us evaluate how well these services deal with the unknown.\nWe don't rely solely on our findings, however. There are all sorts of ways to test antivirus and some fantastic labs out there that do it a lot more frequently than we do. That's why we refer to results from AV-Comparatives and AV-Tests to paint a broader picture of the antivirus software's capabilities and assign a fair protection score.\nPerformance is a critical consideration during our testing. We need to know how much slowdown is caused by installing and running the antivirus, and how much it's going to impact your day-to-day activities. After all, an antivirus that zaps every threat known to man, but slows your machine down to a crawl, won't be much use to anyone.\nWe know that resources will be used, seeing as the antivirus programs are saved locally on the device, but we still measure things like how long it takes to open a browser, navigate to a website, attach a file to an email, or how long it takes a webpage to load fully.\nOnline speed test websites give us a hand with this process by providing the nit-picky numbers to supplement our real-time testing. That way, we can balance solid statistics with our individual experiences, to get a real feel for how the antivirus behaves outside of a lab.\nAs you'd expect, real-time testing involves us installing and using antivirus programs on our home devices. We'll keep track of anything out of the ordinary, the highs and lows, and how easy the software is to navigate. This is also where we'll dig into the tools and settings to see if they do everything that they're supposed to do\u2014think password managers, file encryption, VPN add-ons, and parental controls.\nCustomer support is another important aspect of any review. Usually, it's easy enough to follow along with the on-screen instructions provided by the installation wizard when you download new antivirus software, but that doesn't mean there aren't times when you'll need a little extra help from an agent.\nWe evaluate each company's support options, ranging from the live chat support and email ticketing systems, if available, and the online library of resources. We measure how quickly agents respond to our inquries, how detailed their reply is, and how accessible the company's resources are\u2014particularly for new users.\nTested by\nMike is a lead security reviewer at Future, where he stress-tests VPNs, antivirus and more to find out which services are sure to keep you safe, and which are best avoided.\nSead is a seasoned freelance journalist based in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. He covers all things cybersecurity, including ID theft, ransomware, and data breaches, as well as laws and regulations related to the field.\nThe best antivirus FAQs\nWhat is the best antivirus of 2025\nI put all of today's top dogs to the test and found that Bitdefender is the best antivirus software in 2025.\nIt's a superb bit of kit\u2014from its entry-level Bitdefender Antivirus Plus and its cast-iron malware defenses, excellent threat detection and genuinely value-adding extra features, right up to its all-singing, all-dancing Total Security that adds an array of maintenance tools and can be used to protect your family's computers, tablets and phones.\nWhat does antivirus do? How does virus protection work?\nAn antivirus app sits on your device like a guard dog, watching over the entire system and sniffing out suspicious intruders. In short, it offers real-time defenses against viruses or other threats, which, if detected, are immediately dealt with, preventing them from carrying out their destructive payload. As well as this automated protection, you can run manual virus scans whenever you wish.\nAntivirus applications use what are called virus \u2018definitions\u2019 to catch intruders. Think of these as the fingerprints of malware, and if something is spotted coming onto your system that has a matching fingerprint, the antivirus leaps into action, quarantining the offender. As another line of defense, antivirus programs also use what are called \u2018heuristics\u2019 that look for any file or process exhibiting suspicious behavior\u2014this allows the app to potentially catch any freshly made malware that isn\u2019t yet in its definitions database.\nFor more details on this topic, see our full breakdown of exactly how antivirus software works.\nDo I really need antivirus in 2025?\nThe internet is jam-packed with threats, like ransomware, cooked up by cybercriminals willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want. Security breaches are commonplace, unfortunately, and hackers use malware to crack a company's system and make off with important files\u2014including customer information. Unfortunately, that means that you're the ultimate victim of these attacks, seeing as they can lead to identity theft.\nToday's best antivirus programs can help prevent identity theft by keeping an eye on the dark web, where all sorts of personal information is bought and sold. You'll also get protection against phishing scams, and block messages designed to trick you into handing over personal information to dodgy third parties.\nMore and more antivirus software includes a VPN, too, which will safeguard your browsing sessions regardless of the device you're using. You'll be able to bypass geo-restrictions and blocks, and avoid cookies, trackers, and invasive ads.\nYou may have heard arguments that if you\u2019re prudent about where you browse on the web, and what you download or click on, you\u2019ll be fine\u2014and that\u2019s true to a certain extent, but I really wouldn\u2019t risk it. Even well-known websites might occasionally be victims of malware being peddled via their adverts (in other words, the ad networks they work with), for example, so no matter how cautious and tech-savvy you are, it\u2019s worth having an antivirus app as a fall-back defense.\nFortunately, the best antivirus products are getting more and more affordable\u2014and free antivirus keeps improving, too.\nIs free antivirus enough?\nUnfortunately, there's not a simple yes or no answer to this question.\nA good free antivirus can boost your digital security, and a lot of folks will rely on Microsoft Defender to do the job. The good news is that Microsoft Defender is a decent option that'll cover all of the basics when it comes to putting a stop to viruses and malware.\nYou'll find that most free antivirus use the same protection engine (the central tech that monitors your device and thwarts threats) as their paid counterparts.\nHowever, premium antivirus programs offer extra features above and beyond the fundamentals. A robust system of parental controls could be a huge win for those with kids, for example. Or, a dedicated anti-ransomware layer of protection that only comes with the paid-for product could help catch one of the most dreaded infections and halt it in its tracks.\nGiven how cheap some premium antivirus apps are\u2014particularly with the various deals on offer\u2014it\u2019s well worth considering going this route instead to get extra features that could give you more peace of mind.\nFor more on this, read our full piece on whether free antivirus is enough to protect you.\nEditors' note: Kaspersky Anti-Virus used to appear on this list. However, considering the current climate, and the recent ban of the sale of Kaspersky software in the US, we've made the decision to remove the provider.\nAlthough much of the company's core processes now take place in Switzerland, the fact that its headquarters remain in Moscow, and that there are prior allegations around government coercion, it feels prudent to urge caution when considering the provider.\nWhat's more, with so many excellent alternatives to choose from, it's impossible to wholeheartedly recommend Kaspersky at this time.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nBenedict has been writing about security issues for over 7 years, first focusing on geopolitics and international relations while at the University of Buckingham.

Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of your site using a Wix domain.\n\u2705 You want a platform that\u2019s easy to use: Wix\u2019s beginner-friendly approach renders it really easy to use, especially if you tap into its AI-powered tool, Wix ADI.\n\u274c You don\u2019t want to pay over the odds for ecommerce: Although there\u2019s a free plan, this doesn\u2019t offer ecommerce tools; only the most premium options have ecommerce tools.\n\u274c You\u2019re a big business: Larger sites might not find Wix as useful as smaller ventures given Wix doesn\u2019t provide unlimited resources with any of its plans.\n\u274c You\u2019re constantly experimenting with your site\u2019s look: Wix\u2019s templates are useful, but you can swap them out for another once it\u2019s set. If you want to change template, you\u2019ll have to build your site again from scratch.\n\ud83c\udf10 Wix is one of the best site builders and worth checking out, despite the fact it\u2019s not perfect. It has something for everyone \u2013 whether you\u2019re launching a blog or a professional site to promote your business, but larger sites may wish to look elsewhere. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nWhat you need to know:\nWix is one of the best best all-in-one ecommerce platforms on the marker that\u2019ll equip you with everything you\u2019ll ever need to build a beautiful online store. It comes in the package with a web hosting service and a domain name, free or paid.\nWe found the ecommerce features on Wix simple and easy to use. Its simplicity makes it an ideal option for small businesses that want to quickly and easily upload products and start selling online.\nAlthough we didn't set up a large scale ecommerce store, it is clear Wix's limited resources may prove an issue in these circumstances. If you want a platform with fewer limits, BigCommerce is worth checking out.\nPlans and pricing:\nAlthough Wix offers one of the best free website builder plans and a low cost \u2018Light\u2019 plan ($17/mo), if you want to sell online you will need to opt for one of its more advanced plans.\nThe cheapest plan that will allow you to sell online is the \u2018Core\u2019 plan ($29/mo). This gives you all the basics you need to build your website along with ecommerce tools such as the ability to sell up to 50,000 products, accept online payments, send abandoned cart emails, and apply automatic discounts.\nTaking a step up to the \u2018Business\u2019 plan ($36/mo) will give you everything from the \u2018Core\u2019 plan along with unlocking reviews, advanced shipping options, and up to 5 additional currencies.\nBusiness Elite ($159/mo) takes this one step further, adding a loyalty program along with more advanced versions of many of the tools you get with the lower level plans.\nWix is a great option for building an ecommerce store, but it certainly isn't the cheapest. In our Wix vs Weebly study, we found that although Wix offers better ecommerce and website builder features, Weebly is a strong competitor and costs considerably less, with premium packages starting at just $10/mo.\nEase of use:\nBoasting its beginner-friendly approach, Wix is one of the easiest site builders to use, particularly if you don\u2019t mind putting your trust in its AI-powered tool Wix ADI. In a matter of minutes, Wix ADI will build a site for you, though a basic one. So, you\u2019ll still want to utilize the editor and touch up your newly created site.\nFeatures:\nWix offers a cloud hosting service and a domain name with its packages. All plans come with a free SSL certificate and bandwidth is unlimited on most plans too, but storage space is sadly capped on all packages. Its ecommerce features, available with Business Basic on upwards, cover all core functionality you\u2019d expect. Wix allows you to accept online bookings for appointments, schedule online services, manage your staff, stream videos, and much more.\nWix offers one of the best AI website builders on the market. Simply explain the online store you are looking to build and the AI will deliver a dedicated template complete with text and image. Of course, this requires some editing, but is sure to help you get your store online in no time at all. Alternatively, you can pick from one of Wix's templates and build your store out from there.\nAI is also integrated across the rest of the Wix platform including everything from an AI text writer to AI image editing - both of which are super helpful for online stores that are looking to upload a high volume of products.\nThe Wix App Market can also add extra features and functionality to your site, with more than 500 apps on offer.This is alongside the Wix Ascend all-in-one business solution for website owners, which includes tools like email marketing, branding and SEO.\nSecurity:\nKeeping your website secure is critical, and Wix makes it simple by handling the technical stuff for you. Every Wix site comes with an SSL certificate, ensuring your visitors can browse safely with an encrypted connection. Additionally, Wix is PCI DSS compliant, which means it securely handles credit card payments, a must for any serious online store.\nWix boosts account protection by offering two-step verification, which means you'll need to enter a special code along with your username and password to access your account. You can receive this code via email, SMS, or an authenticator app, adding flexibility and extra security. Plus, the Login History page also lets you monitor account logins, locations, and dates, helping you spot any suspicious activity.\nFor business sites, Wix\u2019s collaboration tool can be a lifesaver. It lets you share access with team members securely, assigning specific roles so they only have access to what they need. Plus, Wix has built-in DDoS protection, monitors your site round-the-clock, and keeps a history of your site versions, so you can easily revert to a previous version if something goes wrong.\nSupport:\nWix provides a 24/7 callback service and live chat support from Monday to Friday, 2 AM - 6 PM (ET). In addition to English, live chat is also available in ten other languages including French, German, and Italian. Wix Help Center offers lots of step-by-step guides you can browse via categories, or a search box \u2013 which we prefer.\nRead the full review: Wix review\nFind the best deals on Wix products with our Wix promo codes.\nThe best ecommerce platform for WordPress\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You\u2019re looking to make the most of templates: Bluehost makes it easy for people to build a website with a plethora of templates and media sources, with prebuilt designs for different components that make up the site.\n\u2705 You need performance guaranteed: We reported no outages during testing, and response times averaged 1.95ms, which is incredibly fast, given most providers average between 200-400ms.\n\u2705 You want to build a WordPress site: WordPress recommends Bluehost becaue of its customer service and expertise, and the platform has offered plans optimized for WordPress since 2014.\n\u274c You need an email account: Although there are great advantages to using Bluehost, you can\u2019t buy an email address with its various packages.\n\u274c You want to pay monthly: There\u2019s no monthly payment option for Bluehost\u2019s website building plans, and you have the option to commit to 12 months or 36 months.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for a novice-friendly eccomerce platform: Like most open-source solutions, WooCommerce isn\u2019t the most beginner-friendly and it isn\u2019t included in the base plan.\n\ud83c\udf10 Bluehost + WooCommerce work together extremely well to give you an ecommerce solution optimised for WordPress. You get complete control over your site and plenty of templates to help you get underway, alongside a great variety of ecommerce tools. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nWhat you need to know:\nInstead of being a standalone ecommerce platform, WooCommerce is a free plugin that can turn your WordPress site into a fully functional online store. Like most open-source solutions, WooCommerce isn\u2019t the most novice-friendly option around.\nFortunately, Bluehost simplifies the process by providing a ready-made WooCommerce platform with everything you need already installed, and that includes a shopping theme and essential plugins.\nAlthough building an online store on WordPress can be a little daunting, we found it pretty easy when using Bluehost. However, if you are a complete novice, another option (such as Wix) may make more sense. Even with our background in testing and using website builders, we found some elements of setting up and using the WordPress platform for online selling a little confusing.\nPlans and pricing:\nBluehost offers three plans for its website builder. The Basic plan is intended for personal websites and blogs, while the others are aimed at businesses and store owners. Priced at $2.95 per month, for a 12-month subscription, the Basic Plan renews at $10.99 per month. If you want to deploy an online store, you must choose between the Pro and Online Store plans. The Pro plan is priced at $9.95 per month, for a 12-month subscription and renews at $14.99 per month. The Online Store will similarly cost you $24.99 per month, and renews at $39.95 per month.\nEase of use:\nBluehost provides an easy to use, intuitive drag-and-drop builder that can help you assemble a website, as well as tweak it\u2019s appearance and add different elements in almost no time at all. The custom-built WooCommerce platform, integrated into Bluehost, also makes it as easy as possible to tap into the features that make WooCommerce so powerful.\nFeatures:\nAll packages include a bevy of useful hosting essentials such as free SSL and domain name, albeit for the first year only. Hosting is included, too. The basic plan also includes free CDM, alongside 50GB SSD storage space.\nThe Bluehost Website Builder is built on top of WordPress, and serves to provide a more streamlined and straightforward interface for building websites using WordPress. Novice users will appreciate the drag-and-drop online store builder which lets you assemble robust ecommerce websites without any technical know-how, coding skills, or even familiarity with WordPress.\nBluehost also now offers a full AI website builder. This tool can help you quickly build and populate a dedicated online store, helping you start selling and growing your ecommerce business faster than ever before.\nSecurity:\nBluehost provides solid security, starting with a free SSL certificate on every plan. For sites handling serious amounts of sensitive information, a premium SSL certificate is available for $49.99 per year.\nBluehost includes free security tools like Spam Assassin protection, hotlink protection, and Secure Shell access. While these cover core security needs, additional measures like SiteLock Find, which offers advanced security for ecommerce sites, can be added for $1.99/month (billed annually). These enhancements are essential for protecting an online business.\nUnfortunately, PCI compliance is not automatically supported on all Bluehost accounts. Shared hosting requires a full CDN solution like Cloudflare to achieve PCI compliance, while VPS and dedicated server customers can reach compliance through a PCI scan. Also, although the core WooCommerce plugin isn't PCI-DSS certified, it's built with security in mind, and achieving PCI compliance is seen as the store owner's responsibility.\nSupport:\nWhile our experience with billing and the customer support was satisfactory, a quick look at Trustpilot reveals a different story. At present, Bluehost scores a rating of 3.2 out of 5. Most of the reviews are from dissatisfied customers expressing frustration at their interaction with the technical support and questions about billing.\nBluehost used to offer a ticket-based support system but that\u2019s been discontinued. Your only options are phone support, live chat, or scavenging for a solution on the Knowledge Base. There\u2019s also a Knowledge Base with guides split across eight broad categories \u2013 with all guides including step-by-step instructions.\nRead the full review: Bluehost Website Builder review\nCheck out our Bluehost promo codes to save money on your purchase.\nThe best ecommerce software without limits\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want no limits: Shopify doesn\u2019t include nearly as many annoying limits or catches as you\u2019ll get with other platforms, including unlimited product, bandwidth and disk space \u2013 alongside a free SSL certificate.\n\u2705 You want a broad choice of extensions: The template-style builder is complemented with a rich variety of integrations and other apps, including shipping and inventory management.\n\u2705 You need advanced analytics: Shopify\u2019s built-in analytics offers an at-a-glance view of important business stats, with individual reports giving you more detail.\n\u274c You want to avoid paying a premium: Shopify\u2019s various plans, while rich with tools and features, are on the pricy side, with the most expensive tier priced at $299 per month.\n\u274c You want a basic or free plan: Although the basic plan is available for a reasonable monthly fee, it doesn\u2019t include gift cards or Shopify\u2019s monthly reports. There\u2019s also no free plan, but there is a 14-day trial for all plans.\n\u274c You\u2019re wary of transaction fees: Transaction fees are present throughout Shopify\u2019s packages, and apply to both credit card and in-person charges, but they scale down with more premium plans.\n\ud83c\udf10 Shopify represents an easier way to build and manage your web store, but there are more powerful platforms around and you need to pay a relative premium when you compare it to a number of competitors. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nWhat you need to know:\nShopify is perhaps the most well-known and top rated ecommerce platforms as we write and it came a long way since its inception in 2006. True to its word, to use Shopify to create a beautiful online store you don\u2019t require any technical or design skills.\nIt\u2019s a one-stop ecommerce platform that provides everything you need to build and grow your web store: a template-based online store builder, comprehensive product catalog, easy payment processing, automated fulfilment via shipping apps and other integrations, inventory management, powerful analytics and more.\nPlans and pricing:\nThe Basic Shopify plan is available for $29 (around \u00a322.70) a month, and includes a free SSL certificate, and no limits to bandwidth, disk space or products. The only penalties come in the way of only two staff users and 2.2% + 20p transaction fees for online orders and 1.7% + 0p for in-person payments.\nUpgrading to the $79 (around \u00a361.80) Shopify account cuts online credit card charges to 1.9% + 20p, and in-person ones to 1.6%. You also get gift cards, professional reports, up to five staff accounts, and five locations. The most expensive tier is the \u2018Advanced Shopify\u2019 at $299 per month (around \u00a3234). This cuts the online credit card charges down to 1.6% + 20p, in-person charges to 1.5%, gives you up to 15 staff accounts, and can handle 8 locations. Shopify also offers a free 14-day trial, with no credit card details required.\nShopify is purpose built to support online stores, but certainly isn't the cheapest option. If you are looking for something more budget friendly, Weebly is a more affordable alternative. You can get selling online for free with Weebly, although you will have a host of limitations. Paid plans start at just $10/mo.\nEase of use:\nThe Shopify interface does its best to keep options to a minimum. A left-hand sidebar organises features into straightforward categories - Orders, Products, Customers, Analytics, Marketing, Discounts, Apps - while the Dashboard highlights how you should get started (add products, then customise your store). It's all very clean and simple.\nOne problem with this minimalist approach is it's not immediately obvious where you should look to carry out a particular task. Fortunately, a well-designed search system is on hand to point you in the right direction.\nFeatures:\nShopify provides a full-fledged CMS users can use to manage site functionality and layout, which they can also do via Shopify\u2019s mobile apps. A live chat function allows you to have a real-time conversation with your customers, and there\u2019s built-in support for 3D models and videos. Plus, you get an option to create customizable storefronts on Facebook and Instagram.\nShopify also offers unlimited hosting for their stores, in-depth analytics of how visitors are using the store, and powerful marketing tools such as SEO optimization, discounts, a coupon engine, gift cards, and email marketing tools.\nAI has been rolled out extensively across the Shopify platform, with a focus on making it easier and faster to build and grow online stores. Shopify Sidekick offers store owners a dedicated AI assistant that can be used to quickly execute everyday tasks such as creating discount codes and checking stock levels. Shopify Magic sees AI being integrated across the platform, making it available for use in everything from writing product descriptions to editing product imagery.\nSecurity:\nWhen it comes to keeping your online store safe, Shopify has you covered. All Shopify plans include SSL security, which is crucial for protecting sensitive information, like payment details, from hackers and building trust with your customers.\nShopify is also Level 1 PCI DDS compliant, which means your store meets the highest security standards for processing credit/debit card details. In other words, you can be confident that your transactions are secure and your customers\u2019 information is safeguarded.\nOne of the best parts about using Shopify is that they handle all the security updates and core software maintenance for you. Your site is always up-to-date with the latest security patches without you lifting a finger. Plus, Shopify has a strong fraud detection system and sends alerts if there\u2019s any potential security threat, so you can swiftly take action to keep your store safe.\nSupport:\nShopify offers round-the-clock customer support via telephone line, live chat, and email. During testing we found support to be responsive and helpful, which can be mighty helpful when faced with a challenge in setting up, running, or growing your online store.\nRead the full review: Shopify review\nThe best ecommerce platform for big businesses\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want loads of built-in tools: The platform features customizable templates, integrated payment processing systems, built-in marketing tools, and more.\n\u2705 You want great customer support: You can access live chat support through its website, alongside phone support and an email address you can contact \u2013 with an agent getting in touch in under 24 hours.\n\u2705 You want to take advantage of analytics: BigCommerce offers real-time analytics, with access to experts qualified in both Google Analytics and Adwords who can offer advice.\n\u274c You\u2019re just starting out: Although BigCommerce is user-friendly, it isn\u2019t the most beginner-friendly platform out there and may seem overwhelmingly complex if you\u2019re just starting out.\n\u274c You want extensive customization options: Although there are a variety of templates you pick out and customize, these are limited when you compare it to those offered by competitors.\n\u274c You\u2019re looking for value-for-money: BigCommerce is fantastic if pricing isn\u2019t an issue for you, but with a number of expensive plans, those looking to making savings should probably shop elsewhere.\n\ud83c\udf10 BigComerce is a feature-rich ecommerce solution that\u2019s prefect for the large businesses and enterprises \u2013 that is, if pricing isn\u2019t an issue. With tools, customer interaction and integrations everywhere you look, you can build the perfect website to support your growing business. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\nWhat you need to know:\nLaunched in 2009, BigCommerce is today one of the leading ecommerce platforms providing a splendid level of scalability for online stores \u2013 meaning it can follow and shape your business\u2019 growth.\nMuch like Shopify, BigCommerce provides a variety of templates and themes to help stores look their best and get up and running quickly. Alternatively, users can design their own store or employ BigCommerce designers to do so. The platform incorporates a full-featured CMS that allows users to run an entire site, rather than just an online store.\nDuring testing we found that BigCommerce offers all the tools and features you would expect from a dedicated piece of ecommerce software.\nHowever, with a slightly higher level of complexity than the likes of Shopify, we also found that BigCommerce is better suited to established ecommerce brands that already have a basic understanding of how ecommerce platforms function.\nPlans and pricing:\nBigCommerce\u2019s Standard plan starts at $29.95/month and includes everything you need to get started. BigCommerce Plus plan starts at $79.95/month and includes all the features in the standard plan plus a number of others including customer groups and segmentation, abandoned cart saver, and more advanced reporting tools.\nThe Pro plan is BigCommerce\u2019s basic website builder package and starts at $299.95/month. It includes all the features of the Plus plan plus Google customer reviews, product filtering, and custom product filtering. It also offers online sales up to $400k per year.\nEase of use:\nBigCommerce offers a robust suite of features that make it easy to build a website from scratch. The drag-and-drop builder makes it easy for users to customize their site without needing any coding skills. The platform also offers plenty of features to help you manage your store once it's up and running. You can easily add products, manage orders, process payments, track inventory levels, and more. The only downside is it might not be suitable for beginners, given the breadth of tools and features available.\nFeatures:\nUsers can benefit from detailed and flexible product management, optimized search engine rankings, along with a variety of integrated marketing tools and analytics.\nPayments can be accepted via over 65 pre-integrated gateways, and shipping details can be customized as per the business's requirements. As of late, some new features have been added like support for Amazon Import and Link and Shopping in Instagram Stories.\nThe platform offers automated order processing, flexible tax rules depending on where orders are made and shipped, and support for over 140 currencies. One of the great tools that come with BigCommerce, meanwhile, is BitPay \u2013 the world\u2019s largest provider of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency payment services.\nSecurity:\nKeeping your BigCommerce store secure is the highest priority, and much of the heavy lifting is handled by BigCommerce itself. Features like PCI compliance, two-factor authentication, and SSL encryption are all in place to safeguard your site and transactions.\nHowever, one aspect you'll want to pay attention to is backups. BigCommerce doesn't automatically perform backups for you, so it's smart to have a backup process in place to safeguard your store data if anything goes awry.\nFortunately, BigCommerce offers a range of security settings for both site visitors and customers. From automatically logging out customers after a certain period to enabling reCAPTCHA, you have control over the security of your online store.\nSupport:\nBigCommerce offers live chat support directly from its website. If live chat is different from your style, BigCommerce also offers phone support for their customers. For those who prefer written communication, BigCommerce provides email support as well. All you have to do is fill out an online form on their website and one of their team members will get back to you within 24 hours (or sooner).\nRead the full review: BigCommerce review\nThe best ecommerce platform for physical stores\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want to integrate online and in-person sales seamlessly: Square's platform perfectly syncs your physical store inventory with your online store, making omnichannel selling effortless.\n\u2705 You need a user-friendly solution: Square's drag-and-drop website builder requires no coding knowledge, making it ideal for business owners who want to create a professional online presence quickly.\n\u2705 You're looking for built-in marketing tools: Square offers robust marketing features including email campaigns, social media integration, and customer engagement tools to help grow your business.\n\u274c You want extensive customization options: While Square offers customizable templates, its design flexibility is somewhat limited compared to competitors like Wix or Shopify.\n\u274c You need advanced ecommerce features: Square's platform may lack some sophisticated features that larger online-only businesses might require for complex operations.\n\u274c You're concerned about checkout experience: Square redirects customers to a different domain during checkout, which might affect the seamless shopping experience for your customers.\n\ud83c\udf10 Square offers an excellent ecommerce solution that bridges the gap between physical and online retail, making it perfect for businesses that already operate brick-and-mortar locations or use Square's POS system. With its straightforward approach and integrated payment processing, it provides everything needed to extend your physical store into the digital realm. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u00bd\nWhat you need to know:\nSquare Online is an adaptive ecommerce platform that has been especially designed with brick-and-mortar store businesses in mind. It particularly shines at making it simple to integrate online and offline business operations, which automatically sync up inventory, sales, and customer data across channels.\nThe platform provides all that is needed to create a professional webstore, from product management to inventory tracking to straight-through payment processing. Square's ecosystem model enables merchants to operate their entire business\u2014from point-of-sale to online orders\u2014within one platform.\nDuring our tests, we found that the Square website builder platform was best suited for retailers, restaurants, and service companies who already use the Square POS platform, who are now looking to expand their presence online without exposing themselves to complex integrations or learning essentially new systems.\nPlans and pricing:\nSquare provides an incredibly generous free plan with unlimited products, simple search engine optimization tools, inventory tracking, and multi-channel selling features. The plan imposes a 2.9% + 30\u00a2 transaction fee on each sale, making it an affordable option for new businesses to launch an online store.\nFor growing businesses, the Plus plan at $29/month (billed annually) includes all of the free stuff plus more site customization, customer accounts, personal ordering, and a free domain name for one year. The transaction fee remains 2.9% + 30\u00a2 per sale.\nThe $79/year Premium plan provides the best value and additional features, including lower transaction fees, live shipping estimates, and priority support.\nSquare's prices are clear and upfront with no hidden costs, although companies must consider that additional fees for certain templates, apps, and Square POS functions are possible depending on individual needs.\nEase of use:\nSquare's store builder features a simple drag-and-drop builder that anyone without a designing background can use to build a professional online store. The platform facilitates launch by walking you step by step through simple-to-understand instructions and intuitive templates.\nWe particularly liked the ease of importing existing inventory from a Square POS system, which populates your online store with products, descriptions, and images with no manual effort. It significantly reduces the time it takes to set up an online store for businesses already committed to Square's ecosystem.\nFeatures:\nSquare Online has features that are specifically meant for both online and offline stores. The website has feature-rich product management where you can add unlimited products with various images, in-depth descriptions, and variations.\nThe inventory sync feature automatically synchronizes the inventory levels in all the sales channels, preventing over-selling and providing real-time inventory visibility. Square also accommodates customizable types of fulfillment like shipping, local pickup, and curbside pickup.\nMarketing features encompass Facebook and Instagram Shop integration, email marketing, and customer engagement. Square's artificial intelligence features enable personalized shopping experiences with product suggestions to customers and simplified reordering features.\nFor foodservice businesses, Square provides specialized functionality including online ordering, QR code menus, and delivery management capabilities that can easily be integrated with kitchen operations.\nSecurity:\nSecurity receives the highest priority with Square. SSL certificates are a default feature of every Square Online site, encrypting customer data and keeping it secure when making a transaction.\nYour website stays PCI compliant, ensuring industry standards for the secure handling of credit card data. Square's payment processing system has fraud detection and prevention features integrated into it so businesses are safe from fraudulent transactions.\nSquare also offers secure customer accounts that allow customers to save payment information securely for faster checkout procedures. Two-factor authentication adds a layer of security for store owners when accessing the backend system.\nSupport:\nSquare offers good support facilities too. The knowledge base contains detailed guides, tutorials, and troubleshooting information on each aspect of how to install and operate an online shop.\nAll users have email support backing them, with phone support available for Plus and Premium subscription holders. Additionally, Square also maintains a forum where users can interact with each other on ideas and solutions.\nFor businesses on Premium plans, Square provides priority support with faster response times and dedicated handling of more complex problems. Support personnel are generally familiar with the online platform as well as how it integrates into Square's broader product line.\nRead the full review: Square website builder review\nBest ecommerce platform for small business\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You're a small business owner seeking an intuitive website builder with robust ecommerce capabilities: Weebly's beginner-friendly drag-and-drop builder and a solid collection of themes make it easy to create a professional website without any coding expertise.\n\u2705 You're looking for a platform with transparent pricing and guaranteed uptime: Weebly offers upfront pricing and a solid 99.99% uptime guarantee, ensuring your website stays accessible at all times.\n\u2705 You want a solid forever-free tier: Weebly provides access to all features on the free plan, making it an excellent option for those looking to explore the platform without committing to a paid subscription.\n\u274c You require extensive customization options: While Weebly offers a range of tools suitable for small businesses, larger ones may find its capabilities lacking.\n\u274c You anticipate large fluctuations in sales volume: Weebly's plans come with sales limits, and exceeding these limits may result in automatic upgrades to higher-priced plans, which will increase costs considerably.\n\u274c You prefer platforms with maximized storage space: Weebly's paid plans have limitations on storage, which may not be suitable for businesses requiring ample storage space.\n\ud83c\udf10 Weebly is a top choice for small businesses and solo entrepreneurs seeking a hassle-free website-building experience. With its intuitive drag-and-drop interface and extensive library of mobile-friendly themes, Weebly makes it easy to create stunning websites without any coding knowledge.\nWhile it may not offer as many customization options as some other platforms, Weebly's simplicity and affordability make it an ideal choice for small businesses looking to establish a professional online presence quickly and efficiently.\nWhat you need to know:\nLaunched in 2006, Weebly has made its mark as a well-liked website builder, striking a balance between simplicity and functionality. Its drag-and-drop interface allows you to customize your site with ease, while its robust ecommerce tools make it a smart choice for an online store.\nWeebly is a fantastic option for budget conscious online stores. However, it comes with customization, product, and storage limitations. Large, growing, and ambitious online stores are likely to be better off with a dedicated ecommerce software such as Shopify or BigCommerce.\nPlans and pricing:\nWith Weebly, you\u2019ll find several subscription plans for different business needs. The Personal plan, starting at $10/month billed annually or $13 month-to-month, provides essential features for individuals and small businesses. The Professional plan, available at $12/month billed annually or $18 month-to-month, offers additional ecommerce capabilities and priority support.\nFor businesses looking for advanced features, the Performance plan, priced at $26/month billed annually or $29 month-to-month, includes PayPal integration, abandoned cart recovery, and much more.\nEase of use:\nNavigating Weebly's website-building process is a breeze, thanks to its drag-and-drop interface. Whether you're a tech whiz or just getting started, you'll find it easy to customize your site with Weebly's intuitive design and helpful how-tos along the way.\nFeatures:\nWe've explored Weebly's toolkit extensively, and while we've found plenty to love, there are a couple of areas where it doesn't quite hit the mark for us. We're big fans of its selection of mobile-responsive themes and essential features like SEO optimization and ecommerce tools.\nHowever, we have to admit that some of the available templates didn't quite meet our expectations in terms of quality. Likewise, while Weebly offers a decent level of customization, we found that it falls short compared to some other platforms we've tried.\nSecurity:\nWeebly's got your back when it comes to website security. With just a click, you can get a free SSL certificate, keeping your visitors' data safe and sound. Plus, Weebly ensures compliance with PCI standards for secure transactions, so you can rest easy knowing your customers' payment information is under protection.\nBut that's not all.

We particularly enjoyed its vast array of beautiful templates and its intuitive interface, which made the whole website-building process a breeze.\nWhile it might not offer as much customization as some other platforms, Squarespace more than makes up for it with its comprehensive feature set and reliable support. So, if you're in the market for a website builder that prioritizes design and user-friendliness, Squarespace is worth a shot.\nWhat you need to know:\nSquarespace is a one-stop solution for all things website-related. Whether you're looking to catch a domain, host your site in the cloud, or build a stunning online store, Squarespace has got your back. What's best is that you don't need to be a tech whiz to make a beautiful yet professional website - their user-friendly system and drag-and-drop interface make it surprisingly simple.\nAlthough Squarespace offers some of the most stunning website templates on the market, there are limits on how far these can be customized. In our Wix vs Squarespace study, we found that Wix is a better option if the ability to edit and change your website's look and feel is important.\nPricing and plans:\nWhen it comes to pricing, Squarespace offers four distinct plans, starting from $16 and going up to $53/month, with options for annual billing for those who prefer it. However, you can save big on these by using one of our Squarespace promo codes at checkout. Regardless of the plan you choose, you'll get essential features like unlimited bandwidth and storage, along with a complimentary custom domain.\nIt's worth noting that the \"Business\" plan carries a 3% transaction fee on sales, which could impact businesses with growing sales volumes. However, if you opt for the Commerce (whether Basic or Advanced version), you'll enjoy the benefit of no transaction fees, which makes it a solid choice for businesses focused on sales.\nEase of use:\nSquarespace prides itself on its user-friendly approach, making website building a breeze for both beginners and seasoned pros. With its drag-and-drop interface and a wide selection of pre-designed templates, crafting a professional-looking website is as simple as it gets.\nHowever, if you're thinking of switching templates down the line, be prepared to start from square one, as there's no way to seamlessly transition between them.\nFeatures:\nAs we delved into Squarespace's feature set, we were glad to discover a wide array of tools designed to elevate your website. From media marketing functionalities to seamless ecommerce integrations, Squarespace truly has it all. Plus, the robust analytics tools provided allow you to stay on top of your site's performance without much effort.\nSquarespace's Blueprint AI website builder can help you quickly create a stunning website via the power of AI, helping you to get selling faster than ever before.\nIt's worth mentioning that while you have the freedom to add unlimited products to your online store and leverage SEO and social media marketing features, some functionalities, such as manual payments and multi-currency selling, may not be as comprehensive as those offered by competitors like Shopify.\nSecurity:\nSquarespace will keep your website and its visitors safe with a robust lineup of security features. Each Squarespace site comes equipped with SSL certificates, two-factor authentication, a defense against denial of service (DoS) attacks, page passwords, and a login activity panel. We should note that the login activity panel won't single-handedly shield your site but it provides insights into any suspicious login attempts.\nTo ensure round-the-clock protection, Squarespace's security team monitors all sites for potential threats and vulnerabilities. If you run into a potential vulnerability, you can report it to the security team, who will promptly investigate the matter.\nAdditionally, Squarespace Payments and its payment processors - Stripe, PayPal, and Square - comply with applicable PCI standards, ensuring secure transactions for both you and your customers.\nSupport:\nIf you ever find yourself in need of assistance, rest assured that Squarespace has your back with a range of support options. Whether you prefer reaching out via live chat, email, or social media channels, help is always just a click away.

However, it's worth noting that if you prefer resolving issues over the phone, this option isn't currently available.\nRead our full review: Squarespace website builder review\nBest ecommerce platform for beginners\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 If you're a startup eager to get your online store up and running swiftly: GoDaddy's user-friendly ADI tool makes the process a breeze.\n\u2705 You\u2019re seeking simplicity and convenience: GoDaddy's ADI feature lets you create a website by answering a few questions, which is perfect for those who want to skip the complexities of extensive customization.\n\u2705 You want built-in marketing tools to boost your online presence effortlessly: GoDaddy's got you covered with great options for email campaigns and performance analysis.\n\u274c You crave full control over your website's design and layout: GoDaddy's ADI approach will likely feel limited in terms of creative freedom.\n\u274c You seek advanced ecommerce features: While GoDaddy's platform is easy to use, it may lack the depth and customization options found in competitors like Squarespace and Shopify.\n\u274c You want a seamless checkout experience for your customers: GoDaddy's ecommerce solution redirects customers to a different domain during checkout, which could raise trust and branding concerns.\n\ud83c\udf10 GoDaddy's website builder, powered by ADI, offers a quick and easy way for startups and small businesses to establish an online presence. We appreciated its intuitive interface and handy marketing tools, making it a solid choice for those looking for simplicity.\nHowever, we found its limitations in creative control and ecommerce features might not suit everyone's needs, particularly those with more complex requirements or larger-scale businesses.\nWhat you need to know:\nFounded in 1997 and renowned for its domain registration, GoDaddy also offers a rock-solid website builder solution. With a user-friendly interface and competitive pricing, this website builder is an attractive option, especially for newcomers diving into the world of online presence creation.\nWhether you're already a GoDaddy customer or exploring options for your website, we believe GoDaddy's easy-to-use website builder is worth considering. However, if you need extensive ecommerce tools and feature, an alternative such as Shopify may be a better fit for you.\nWe have also compared Wix vs GoDaddy. Our tests found that although Wix certainly offers a more complete and editable platform, GoDaddy delivers all the features you need to create a simple, yet effective online store - all at a significantly more budget friendly price.\nPricing and plans:\nFrom individuals to small businesses and all sizes of ecommerce ventures, GoDaddy offers flexible options. We also appreciated the inclusion of a free plan, allowing users to test the platform before committing to a paid subscription.\nStarting at $10.99/month, the Basic plan includes essential features such as SSL, custom domain connection, and customer support. If you need more flexibility, the Standard plan, priced at $10.49/month, offers increased email and social media limits, along with built-in SEO options.\nFor those seeking even more features, the Premium plan, priced at $14.99/month, supports unlimited social media platforms and posts, along with appointment scheduling and reminders. Meanwhile, the Ecommerce plan, starting at $16.99/month, provides solid features for online selling, including product listings, flexible payments, and promotional tools.\nIt is worth noting that the rates we quote above are introductory rates and will increase once your plan automatically renews, so it is worth checking what you will pay after the introductory period is over.\nHowever, while GoDaddy's pricing is competitive, we found that some features may be lacking compared to other providers in the market.\nEase of use:\nOur experience with GoDaddy's website builder revealed its user-friendly nature, making it ideal for individuals with limited website-building experience. Powered by artificial design intelligence (ADI), GoDaddy simplifies the website building process, guiding users through customization options effortlessly.\nHowever, we did notice that the use of ADI limits creative freedom, and the design templates may feel somewhat rigid for users seeking more customization options.\nFeatures:\nGoDaddy's website builder offers a solid suite of business tools, including appointment scheduling, email marketing, social media management, graphic design, and CRM functionalities. We particularly liked how these integrated tools made it easier to manage different aspects of our website and marketing efforts in one place.\nHowever, it's important to note that while these tools are effective for basic needs, users requiring more advanced features may find them lacking compared to specialized platforms. Additionally, we found that the builder's design customization options are somewhat limited, which may restrict users seeking a high level of creative control over their websites.\nMoreover, we observed that the availability of app integrations is relatively restricted, which could pose challenges for users looking to extend the functionality of their sites beyond the built-in features. Despite these limitations, we found GoDaddy's website builder to be a user-friendly option for start-ups and small businesses seeking a comprehensive online solution.\nGoDaddy Airo is another great solution for beginners. This platforms helps small businesses leverage the power of AI to create a full set of business assets, including logos, social media plans, and a fully populated website.\nSecurity:\nGoDaddy prioritizes strong security across its plans, providing robust features such as SSL encryption to safeguard customer transactions and data privacy. All website builder plans include SSL certificates, which encrypt data transmitted between the server and the visitor's browser, keeping it confidential.\nThe Ecommerce plan includes PCI-compliant solutions such as GoDaddy Payments, Online Store, and Online Appointments, enhancing security. Adhering to PCI standards ensures that customer payment information is protected, building confidence and credibility.

Owain has also built several online stores, including a Scandi-inspired homeware store.\nHow to choose the best ecommerce platform for you\nIn today's fast-paced online marketplace, finding the perfect ecommerce software can be your business's best buddy. However, with so many choices out there, it's critical to think about what you really need to ensure this platform aligns with your business goals and needs. To cut to the chase, here are a few things you'll want to consider before selecting an ecommerce platform for your business:\n1. Tools and functionality\nWhen evaluating ecommerce solutions, keep an eye out for essential tools like SSL certification, fraud prevention, data backups, and PCI compliance. These are the foundation stones that ensure your customers' data remains safe and secure.\nTo boost your site's visibility, seek out platforms that offer SEO-friendly features such as customizable meta descriptions, integrated blogging capabilities, and customer review functionalities. Additionally, prioritize platforms that embrace responsive web design, ensuring seamless access across all devices.\nTo steer your business in the right direction, look for platforms that provide built-in analytics features, allowing you to track store performance and spot emerging trends. Consider platforms that support multiple selling channels, from social media platforms like Facebook Messenger to established marketplaces like Amazon, to expand your market reach and revenue streams.\nLastly, opt for platforms that offer extensive integrations and plugins, empowering you to customize and enhance your store's functionality as your business evolves. Also, having active community support can provide ongoing improvements and swift issue resolution to keep your ecommerce venture ahead of the curve.\n2. Price and costs\nWhile open-source software may appear budget-friendly upfront, it's crucial to weigh in other expenses like the fees of the best web hosting providers, security compliance, and ongoing maintenance. Also, keep an eye on transaction fees, as they can significantly spike up your overall costs.\nOn the flip side, subscription-based platforms may require a monthly fee, but they often include maintenance and support services, making them a cost-effective option in the long run. Don't forget to consider your budget and future growth plans when evaluating the pricing models of ecommerce software.\n3. Security\nWith the increasing prevalence of online threats, security is more important than ever, especially for ecommerce software. When selecting a platform, it's crucial to prioritize security features like SSL encryption, data encryption, and tools to prevent fraud. Make sure the platform you choose is committed to protecting your customers' data and regularly updates its security measures to keep up with evolving threats.\nAfter all, safeguarding your business from cyber threats is crucial for building trust and maintaining a successful online presence.\n4. Ability to grow your store\nScalability is essential for the long-term success of your ecommerce business. Choose a platform that offers features tailored to accommodate your business's expanding needs, such as flexible infrastructure, customizable designs, and seamless integrations with third-party applications.\nAdditionally, consider platforms that support omnichannel marketing strategies, which will allow you to reach customers across multiple channels and boost sales.\nAll in all, picking the best ecommerce software is a bit like putting together a puzzle - you need to find the pieces that fit perfectly. By considering your needs and priorities, you'll be able to pick out a platform that helps your online business grow and thrive.\nHow we tested the best ecommerce platforms\nTesting out website builders thoroughly is our mission, and here's how we test ecommerce platforms to find the best one:\nSign up for the ecommerce platform\nWe begin by signing up for the chosen ecommerce platform, in this case, Square One. This initial step allows us to gain access to the platform's dashboard and explore its features and functionalities firsthand. During the signup process, we pay close attention to the ease of registration and any initial setup requirements.\nBuild a test site\nOnce signed up, we go on to build a test site on the platform. This involves creating a simplified version of an ecommerce website to check the platform's ease of use and customization options. We examine available templates, elements, and page layouts to rate the flexibility and creativity offered by the platform's builder.\nExplore and test ecommerce features\nNext, we delve into the ecommerce features offered by the platform. This includes examining payment options, product management tools, checkout processes, shipping settings, and more.\nDesk research\nAside from our hands-on testing, we also dive into desk research to gather more insights into the platform. This means looking into its pricing plans and any potential hidden fees or limitations. We also explore the platform's security measures, such as SSL certification and PCI compliance.\nIn the end, we compare the platform to its competition, focusing on ease of use, features, pricing transparency, customer support, and scalability. Our recommendations and insights aim to help you choose the right ecommerce platform for your online business.\nBest ecommerce platforms: Summary\nIn our search for the best ecommerce platforms, we've discovered that simplicity, functionality, and standout design are crucial.\nWix stands out as an all-in-one solution, perfect for newcomers with its intuitive interface and comprehensive features.

If you\u2019re ready to dive in, explore your top picks with free trials or money-back guarantees to find the perfect match for your online project.\nBest ecommerce platforms FAQs\nWhat is an ecommerce platform?\nAn ecommerce platform is a piece of software that allows individuals and businesses to create and manage online stores, enabling them to sell products and services across the internet. These platforms handle everything from displaying your products to processing payments and managing orders, making it easier for your online store to prosper among many competitors.\nAdditionally, these platforms come packed with tools for website design, marketing campaigns, and tracking analytics, empowering businesses to create a compelling online presence and attract customers.\nWhat types of ecommerce platforms are there?\nWhen it comes to picking an ecommerce platform, you've got three main types to choose from:\n1. Open-source software: If you possess technical know-how with an in-house development team, this option gives you complete control and flexibility.\n2. Software as a service (SaaS): These platforms are perfect if you want to hit the ground running without dealing with software building or maintenance. They're beginner-friendly but also pretty flexible for your in-house techies and often come with handy API libraries.\n3. Headless ecommerce: With these types of platforms, you can separate the shopping cart from the content management system, offering you tons of flexibility for future front-end changes. It's a popular choice right now because it gives you control over marketing, sales, and product assets while still offering flexibility on the front end.\nEach type of platform has its pros and cons and is suited to different business needs. So, consider your requirements carefully before making a choice.\nWhich ecommerce platforms are like Shopify?\nShopify is a purpose built platform for ecommerce websites. If you are looking for something dedicated like Shopify your best options are BigCommerce or Square. Both of these platforms are also purpose built for ecommerce businesses, offering plenty of tools and features for managing stock, promoting your store, and taking payments.\nSquare is more affordable and integrates well into Square\u2019s Point Of Sale (POS) system, making it one of the best small business website builders. In contrast, BigCommerce tends to appeal more to enterprise level businesses, with advanced analytics and collaboration tools.\nWhat hidden fees do ecommerce platforms have?\nHidden fees can seriously impact your business profits. Taking some time to research potential hidden fees will help you better plan and budget.\nAlmost all ecommerce platforms will charge a transaction fee when you make a sale. Usually, this will be a percentage of the sale along with a small flat fee (such as 2.5% + $0.20). Some platforms will adjust the amount they charge based on the plan you are on, this can often make more expensive plans cheaper in the long run for stores that make a high volume of sales.\nThird party payment processors such as PayPal will also charge you a fee when you take a payment through its platform. This may be in addition to fees charged by the ecommerce platforms. However, this isn\u2019t always the case. For example, when you take a PayPal payment through Wix, you are only charged a fee by PayPal, not Wix. If you sell internationally, you will also want to understand any currency conversion fees.\nEcommerce platforms are generally transparent about what you get with each plan. However, you will sometimes find specific features and tools behind a paywall that you didn't expect. For example, almost all ecommerce platforms will offer a level of website analytics in all plans, but once you dig a little deeper you may find that more advanced plans offer a much greater level of data collection and insight.\nApp stores and third-party plug-ins are a great way to extend the functionality of your store. Although many of these will come with a free trial or a basic free plan, to unlock advanced features you will likely need to sign up to a subscription. For most apps and plug-ins these subscriptions are very affordable, but can add up when multiple apps are added at one time.\nAlthough some ecommerce platforms will offer you a free custom domain with your website plan, the fee-free period typically only lasts one year. Upon renewal, you will be charged for your domain, so it is important to build this into your financial planning.\nSome additional fees you may incur when using an ecommerce platform include fees for additional bandwidth or storage, security and compliance costs, and refund or chargeback fees.\nAll of these fees are to be expected when running an ecommerce business. However, failure to note and understand them can lead to an unforeseen impact on your business profit over the years.\nHow long does it take to launch an ecommerce website?\nIf you're aiming for a simple online store with standard features and a template-based design, you might be up and running within a few weeks to a couple of months. However, if you're dreaming of a fully customized website with unique design elements, advanced functionality, and many integrations, be prepared to invest anywhere from three to six months or more. If you're tackling a large-scale enterprise project with complex requirements, it could take over a year to bring your idea to life.\nIn short, the time needed to build an ecommerce website depends on multiple factors, including its complexity, required features, chosen platform, and customization level.\nWhat are the best ecommerce platforms?\nWix is the best ecommerce platform for most online stores. It offers a huge range of powerful ecommerce solutions as well as a helpful AI website builder and other AI-powered tools that help you get your store online and growing quickly. Plans with ecommerce plans start at $29/mo, making it very affordable.\nLarger online stores may benefit from opting for a dedicated ecommerce platform such as Shopify or BigCommerce. Both of these will let you sell online from $29/mo and deliver a larger range of ecommerce tools, although also come with a steeper learning curve.\nWill I be charged transaction fees?\nYou may be charged a fee for each sale you make using some of the ecommerce platforms we recommend above. However, transaction fees are typically only charged on free and low-cost plans. If you opt for a higher level plan this will usually also include the benefit of the removal of transaction fees.\nWhether a lower priced/free plan with transaction fees or a premium plan without transaction fees is right for you will depend on how much you plan on selling through your website. Almost all dedicated online stores will benefit from paying a higher subscription fee to remove transaction fees.\nWhat level of customer support is available with ecommerce platforms?\nEach ecommerce platform will offer different types of customer support. This usually includes one, or several methods of communication, including forums, email, phone, and live chat.\nYou may also find that different plans from the same ecommerce platform come with different levels of support. For example, you may get email support on a basic plan, but get 24/7 phone support on a top of the range plan.\nIt is important to understand what support you will be able to access before picking a plan. Even though premium support usually costs more, if you are a beginner, or you run a fast paced ecommerce store, being able to access top quality support quickly can pay dividends in the long run.\nIn this guide, we provide you with a brief overview of the types and level of support each ecommerce platform offers.\nWhat are potential challenges I should be aware of when launching/running an ecommerce website?\nLaunching and running an eCommerce website comes with its set of challenges you should be aware of:\n1. Choosing the right products or services: Selecting the right products to sell online is crucial for ecommerce success. This step covers researching market demand, analyzing competition, and identifying profitable niches.\n2. Identifying your target audiences: Understanding your target audience's needs, preferences, and behavior is critical for coming up with effective marketing strategies.\n3. Developing effective sales and marketing messages: Crafting compelling sales and marketing messages that resonate with your target audience can help drive traffic and sales to your online store.\n4. Allocating digital marketing budgets: Determining how to allocate your digital marketing budget across various channels such as social media, search engine optimization (SEO), and paid advertising is essential for maximizing your return on investment (ROI).\n5. Building social proof for your business: Building trust and credibility with potential customers through social proof elements such as customer reviews, testimonials, and social media engagement can help increase sales and conversions.\n6. Designing an eye-catching yet user-friendly online store: Creating a user-friendly and intuitive ecommerce website design that provides a seamless shopping experience for customers is a must.\n7. Increasing conversions: Implementing conversion rate optimization (CRO) strategies such as optimizing product pages, improving checkout processes, and offering personalized recommendations can help boost conversions and sales.\n8. Improving customer retention: Implementing strategies like loyalty programs, personalized communication, and splendid customer service is crucial for long-term ecommerce success.\n9. Mastering logistics management: Effectively managing inventory, order fulfillment, and shipping logistics to ensure timely delivery and customer satisfaction is essential.\n10. Keeping your ecommerce site secure: Ensuring customer data protection, fraud prevention, and transaction security through SSL encryption, PCI compliance, and regular security audits is crucial for maintaining customer trust and credibility in the long run.\nWhile it\u2019s impossible to foresee everything, by considering these common challenges in ecommerce, you'll be better prepared to navigate the complexities of running a successful online store.\nCan I create my own ecommerce solution?\nOf course, if you want complete control over every aspect of your new online store, building each page yourself will be the best course of action.\nHiring someone to code your website is one option. If you decide to do this, follow these steps:\n1. Ask the company for live examples of their work to look at;\n2. Write a detailed brief of the site you want to be created. The more detail the better to avoid confusion;\n3. Ensure you understand the price you are being charged and how many revisions this price includes;\n4. Always have a signed agreement or contract before work commences;\n5. Ask whether the designers will host your site and if you will be able to make updates yourself or if all updates must go through the design agency at an additional cost;\n6. Ask for the copyright of your design to be assigned to your company, as your website is an important part of your business' intellectual property;\n7. Put into your contract, details of how the agreement can be amicably dissolved if things go wrong.\nAlso, you don't have to build your site completely from scratch. Buying a template can give you all the basic pages your site needs. You can then either modify them yourself using an application like Dreamweaver or hire a coding expert to make the changes. Website templates are available from a number of vendors including Template Monster.\nIf you already have a website and want to add ecommerce functionality, this can be easily achieved with applications such as XCart, Kryptronic, and CubeCart.\nSign up to the TechRadar Pro newsletter to get all the top news, opinion, features and guidance your business needs to succeed!\nOwain has been building websites and online stores for his own and his client's businesses for over 8 years.

      "text": "Best Firewall Software of 2025: Top Picks Reviewed, Rated, and Ranked\nThe best firewall software to stay protected online, free and paid\nA firewall is a protective barrier between your network and your device which can spot malicious files and intrusions and stop them in their tracks.\nHere at TechRadar Pro, my team of security software experts have been testing the best firewalls for over a decade, looking at intrusion detection rates, malicious file blocking, quarantine speed, ease of use, and value for money.\nBitdefender offers the best firewall for most people, with Norton and Avast also offering excellent firewall software that will keep your device free from infection.\nI would recommend coupling a firewall with the best antivirus, and then encrypting your internet traffic with one of the best VPNs. I also have a guide to the best cloud firewalls.\nHere are my top recommendations for the best firewall:\nFor Linux users, we've featured the best free Linux firewalls and the best Linux firewall distro.\nThe Best Firewall Software of 2025:\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBest firewall software overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nBitdefender Total Security is a powerful internet security suite that offers a firewall among a range of featured security protections. There's also anti-virus protection, but its multi-layered malware protection also protects against ransomware.\nOther features include anti-phishing, anti-fraud, and anti-theft options, as well as a performance optimizer. A wide range of privacy protection options include anti-tracking, file shredder, parental controls, as well as protection for microphones and webcams to prevent them from being used by third party apps without your consent. It also offers a built-in VPN with a reasonable limit of 200MB/day/device.\nBitdefender Total Security isn't just for protecting Windows users either, but can also be used to protect against attacks on Android, macOS, and iOS as well. Even better, a single product license allows you to use the software on up to 5 different devices, so you can use Bitdefender Total Security for your home PCs as well as smartphones.\nOverall, Bitdefender Total Security pretty much does what its name suggests, offering a very wide range of security protections that goes beyond just a firewall. It costs $59.99 when paid for a year or $129.99 when paid for two.\nProtect your devices with our Bitdefender coupons. Get top-notch cybersecurity at a discounted price and keep your online activities safe.\nRead our full Bitdefender Total Security review.\nBest multi-feature firewall software\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nNorton 360 Deluxe offers an even richer and more feature-packed internet security suite than just providing a firewall. While it provides antivirus and standard anti-malware protections it dares to go further.\nAdditional features in the Norton 360 Deluxe include a secure VPN, parental controls, a password manager (although you may want to use the best password manager instead), and online cloud backup. There's also a feature for dark web monitoring so you can be alerted if any of your details appear for sale on the dark web.\nNorton 360 Deluxe costs $49.99 for the first year, but then renews at $119.99/year, making it more expensive than some of the other solutions listed here, like Bitdefender Total Security. But just like Bitdefender Total Security, Norton 360 Deluxe runs on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android, and a single license covers up to 5 devices in all.\nIf you want to add identity theft protection you can upgrade to Norton 360 with Lifelock, which provides additional identity protection and credit monitoring as well as insurance provision in the event that your personal information is misused.\nRead our full Norton 360 Deluxe review.\nBest multi-platform firewall software\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nAvast Premium Security is another paid-for full-featured internet security suite that you can either buy for a single device, be it Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android, or as a package that covers up to 10 devices, regardless of the platform.\nAs with Bitdefender, and Norton, this means that you can protect both a home PC as well as mobile devices. However, because there's an option to protect up to 10 devices it means you can use a single license to protect the family as well.\nAs well as a firewall for all devices, Avast Premium Security also provides anti-ransomware protection, and file shredder options. There are also anti-phishing and anti-fraud protections for safer online banking, and there's also protection against the unauthorized use of your webcam.\nOverall, Avast Premium Security is another solid and reliable internet security suite, but one thing that does let it down is the constant pop-up ads pushing on cross-sell for PC tune-up and other software, something people who have paid for a license should not have to constantly deal with.\nAlso, unlike some of its peers, Avast Premium Security doesn\u2019t include a VPN. It confusingly shows up in the dashboard, but requires a separate subscription.\nFor one device, Avast Premium Security costs $49.08/year for the first year, and renews at $77.99/year. For 10 devices, it costs $69.48/year for the first year, and $99.99/year for subsequent years.\nRead our full Avast Premium Security review.\nBest value firewall software\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nFirewall, real-time malware detection, USB scanning, Wi-Fi protection, phishing protection: Panda Dome Essential has all the essentials \u2013 not to mention, the goodies \u2013 you'd expect from the best antivirus software.\nAnd, that's just the beginning. Panda Dome is brimming with added extras that some of the other plans on this list can\u2019t match including a dark web scanner, and an integrated VPN. However, it also lacks some features you\u2019ll get with the other products in this guide. For instance, there are no parental controls, nor protection against ransomware that you get with the others.\nLike its peers, Panda Dome Essential protects not just Windows PCs, but also macOS, as well as Android and iOS smartphones and tablets.\nAnother undoubted advantage here is the price - Panda Dome Essential is one of the best value programs out there. And, you even have the option of paying a little more and upgrading to cover an unlimited number of laptops, phones, tablets, and desktops with a single subscription.\nFor a single device, Panda Dome Essential costs $34.99/year, or $69.99 for two years. You can cover up to 3 devices for $41.99/year, 5 devices for $48.99, 10 devices for $69.99, or any number of devices for $83.99.\nRead our full Panda Dome Essential review.\nBest lightweight firewall software\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nJust about every antivirus tool claims to be \u2018lightweight\u2019, but Webroot Essentials is really the only one to deliver on this front. It has a minimal impact on system resources, which makes it a good option for older or less powerful computers.\nWebroot provides protection against a wide range of threats, including viruses, malware, ransomware, and phishing attacks. It also includes features like a firewall, and a password manager. But just like Panda Dome Essential, Webroot Essential also lacks a VPN, and parental controls.\nIt's not easy to compare Webroot's accuracy with the competition, as the big testing labs rarely evaluate the company's products. However, when they are reviewed, they generally score high, and our own tests show solid and reliable protection.\nAnother positive is that the product supports Windows, and macOS computers, as well as Android, and iOS smartphones and tablets. You can buy Webroot Essentials to protect either a single device, 3 devices, or 5 devices.\nTo protect 1 device you\u2019ll have to pay $37.49 for 1 year, $43.74 for 2 years, or $45.83 for 3 years. Similarly, for 3 devices, it\u2019ll cost $52.49 for 1 year, $61.24 for 2 years, and $64.16 for 3 years. The 5 device protection plan costs $67.49 for 1 year, $78.74 for 2 years, and $82.49 for 3 years.\nThere's a lot to love about Webroot Essentials, and the 70-day 100% money-back guarantee suggests the company is confident in the product as well. If you're sick of overly complex and bloated engines, Webroot is a worthy contender for you.\nFind the best deals on Webroot products with our Webroot promo codes.\nBest Free Firewall of 2025\nBest free firewall software overall\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nZoneAlarm Free Antivirus, also known as ZoneAlarm Free Antivirus + Firewall, aims to provide more than basic malware protection. Positioned as a lightweight security suite for Windows users, it combines classic antivirus tools with firewall functionality and a handful of extra features.\nAt its core, ZoneAlarm offers antivirus and antispyware protection designed to detect a wide range of threats including viruses, bots, worms, and trojans. It offers two types of scans, namely Critical Scan, which is faster and only scans critical areas of the file system and OS, and the Full Scan, which combs through the entire file system on the local disk as well as on any attached USB devices.\nIt also features a two-way firewall that monitors traffic coming into and going out of your network, makes your PC invisible to hackers, and stops spyware from broadcasting your personal data.\nZoneAlarm comes in both Free and Pro versions. The former lacks several features, including expert rules, anti-phishing protection, web monitor, threat emulation, and more. What it will do is identify and block potentially unsafe traffic, hide open ports, and allow you to block any app from connecting to the internet.\nRead our full ZoneAlarm review.\nBest lightweight free firewall software\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nTinyWall is actually designed to be used with Windows\u2019 built-in Defender firewall, so its performance impact is minimal.\nTinyWall will actively block trojans, viruses, worms, and other forms of malware, and prevent the modification of Windows firewall\u2019s settings by malicious programs. And it will do all of this without you needing to know about ports, protocols, or application details.\nBut probably its most appealing feature is its no-popup approach. Most firewalls will display a popup asking you what you want to do whenever an application is trying to access the internet. Not only is this annoying, but eventually you\u2019ll just start granting access to everything to get rid of the popups, which isn\u2019t very secure.\nTinyWall gets around this problem by expecting you to whitelist programs that you actually want to be able to access the Internet. When you find a program has been blocked, it\u2019s easy to add it to the whitelist, and then you can continue with what you were doing.\nRead our full TinyWall review.\nBest basic free firewall software\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nIf you have a PC running a version of Windows more recent than XP, then you already have a free firewall installed, and unless you\u2019ve changed any settings, it\u2019s already active and running.\nKnown as Windows Defender since the release of Windows 10, the firewall is part of a suite of security tools included by default with Windows installations. Microsoft recommends that you leave the Defender on, even if you\u2019re also using another firewall.\nTo manage its settings, simply search for 'security' in Windows and select the Security app. When it opens, set the Windows Defender Firewall toggle to on. Turning it off again simply involves clicking the same button.\nYou can also configure the firewall to allow a certain app through the firewall. From the same place as where you turn it on/off, you can select \u2018Allow an app through firewall\u2019 and then choose the app in question.\nRead our full Windows Defender review.\nBest designed free firewall software\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\nGlassWire is a network monitoring and firewall tool known for its polished interface and user-friendly design. Its free edition is a good option for anyone who wants more visibility into their internet activity without navigating complex firewall configurations.\nOne of the key features in the free version is its ability to visually track real-time and historical network activity. You can see which apps are using bandwidth, what servers they're connecting to, and how much data is being transferred. This info can help you identify bandwidth-heavy apps or even detect unexpected network behavior.\nIn terms of firewall functionality, the free version includes a basic click-to-block feature that allows you to block up to two apps from accessing the internet. However, many of the more advanced features are only available in the $2.99/month Premium edition. For instance, the free version does not include the ability to detect new or unfamiliar devices on your local network, nor will it let you create multiple firewall profiles for different networks.\nThis is why it\u2019s best to use GlassWire Free in tandem with Windows Firewall, using it more as a network traffic monitor rather than a firewall.\nTake a look at our full GlassWire review.\nWe've also listed the best endpoint protection software.\nBest firewall FAQs\nHow to choose the best firewall\nWhen deciding which firewall to download and use, first consider what your actual security needs are. Sometimes free and budget software may only provide basic options, so if you need to use advanced tools you may find a paid platform is much more worthwhile. Additionally, higher-end security software suites can usually cater for every need, such as providing other tools such as as a built-in VPN, antivirus, and malware protection, so do ensure you have a good idea of which features you think you may require from your firewall.\nIt's also important to consider the differences between a VPN and a firewall when choosing the best service for your needs.\nHow we test the best firewalls\nTo test for the best firewall we first set up an account with the relevant platform, then we tested the service to see how simple and easy it was to set up, configure, and use. The aim was to see how useful the basic tools of each firewall were, and also how easy it was to get to grips with any more advanced tools. Additionally, we needed to make sure that each of the firewalls worked as intended.\nRead more on how we test, rate, and review products on TechRadar.\nDo I need a firewall and antivirus software?\nFirewalls and antivirus software have two different roles in cybersecurity.\nA firewall acts as a barrier between your network and the wider internet, detecting threats that try to get through and blocking them. They can be hardware or software based which I will explain further down. In theory, firewalls can protect your network from any type of threat: malware, ransomware, trojans and viruses can all be stopped. Firewalls work by checking incoming 'packets' of data for malicious files.\nAntivirus on the other hand is a software based protection that prevents malicious files from being executed, or 'run', on your device. As the name implies, antivirus is designed to protect your device against viruses. Antivirus works by checking software and executables for viruses.\nYou can read more about the differences between antivirus and firewalls here.\nWhat are the key differences between software and hardware based firewalls?\nA software based hardware is a program that sits between your network and the outside internet and scans the packages that pass through it for anything out of the ordinary or malicious.\nA hardware based firewall is a physical device that all network traffic routes through before reaching your network, and it does the same thing.\nThe key differences stem from the networks they are used in. Software-based firewalls are typically used by individuals and small teams as they can run on a laptop or desktop without hindering device performance too heavily. Software-based firewalls also work well for virtualized or hybrid environments.\nHardware-based firewalls are typically used by enterprises that require very fast internet speeds without any interruptions from the firewall. In this case, the firewall will have its own dedicated high-performance hardware that it uses to check files. Typically a hardware-based firewall will be used to protect the network within an office of on-site workers, or to protect data centers and servers.\nWill a firewall slow down my device or internet connection?\nDepending on how a firewall is configured, it can either kill your internet speed or barely affect it.\nA misconfigured firewall that is heavily restrictive will usually check all of the packets travelling through it, including those from trusted local connections or internal networks that already operate within a firewall. In this case, safe packets that have already been checked are being checked again unnecessarily.\nIf the device the firewall is operating on is outdated or doesn't offer the required hardware, the firewall may take extra time to check packets resulting in your internet connection only being as fast as the firewall's checking speed.\nWhat's more, if you have many devices trying to operate through the firewall, it may be much slower as it has more internet traffic to scan. In this case, it may be worth opting for a premium firewall that offers a greater throughput and better features.\nShould I use a free firewall or a premium firewall?\nFor personal use, the best free firewalls can offer a good amount of protection. But keep in mind that you won't get the same level of configurability or extra features offered by their premium counterparts.\nHowever, for small teams, businesses, or even if you work from home, a premium firewall is always a good idea to not only protect your own data on the network, but also important business data.\nFree firewalls may also come with speed or data restrictions, or lack the ability to work with a VPN without upgrading.\nAre there firewalls for small businesses and teams?\nYes. There are dedicated firewall solutions tailored to small businesses and teams that offer specialized features for business environments.
