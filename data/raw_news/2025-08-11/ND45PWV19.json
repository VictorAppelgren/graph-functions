  "description": "Former NBA great Jayson Williams is leading a Nassau Country rehabilitation program that has given nearly a dozen formerly incarcerated men and women a new lease on life with careers as truck drive\u2026",
  "content": "From the bright lights to headlights.\n\nFormer St. John\u2019s standout and NBA great Jayson Williams is leading a Nassau Country rehab program that has transformed nearly a dozen formerly incarcerated men and women \u2014 giving them a new lease on life as truck drivers.\n\n\u201cWhen I was up there getting the diploma, man, I almost cried. \u2026 I worked hard for this day,\u201d Timmy Jones, 39, told The Post after Monday\u2019s graduation ceremony at Nassau Community College.\n\nJones, who served more than 15 years for manslaughter, was a member of Rebound on the Road\u2019s first Long Island class.\n\n\u201cYou got family members that won\u2019t give you another chance after coming home from prison during a long term, so this meant a lot,\u201d he said.\n\nThe eight-week initiative is the brainchild of the ex-New Jersey Net, who himself was locked up for 27 months after the accidental 2002 shooting of his limo driver, Costas Christofi.\n\nWilliams, once a ferocious rebounder on the hardwood, is now using that passion to attack this latest venture.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here seven days a week \u2014 at least. I think Sundays are probably ten hours a day, everything else about 13,14 hour days,\u201d said Williams, who has devoted his life to helping others since his release.\n\n\u201cI love it. I really do. You see the difference it makes \u2026 and we put out a good product.\u201d\n\nBeyond skills behind the wheel of a big rig, Williams prioritizes life lessons and mental health for his students as they get ready for what he calls not a second chance, but another chance.\n\nClassmates who don\u2019t say good morning get sent home, while Williams also invested in boxing gloves, which he calls the \u201csuggestion box,\u201d to air out grievances.\n\nHe also takes the class jet skiing, prioritizes prayer and requires those who can to skydive as a way of breaking through their comfort zones.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do skydiving outside of the program, so I\u2019m actually really excited about that,\u201d said recent grad Clayrone Garner, who is yet to plunge from the plane.\n\n\u201cIt gives you something more to work towards.\u201d\n\nThe faith Williams puts into his students isn\u2019t lost on Jones either, who said that the apprentices pay it back in their work ethic.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been out here going hard from sunup to sundown since the program opened,\u201d he said of the group that bonds over barbecues and a vegetable garden they grow near the truck lot on campus.\n\nGarner, who also went away for a violent crime, said the garden grows watermelon and squash \u2014 and has turned into a mental health metaphor about treating oneself.\n\nCall it the garden of dreams.\n\n\u201cThe garden teaches you life\u2019s value a little bit more from growth \u2026 the more you know, the more knowledge you put into your mind, the more good things you put into the atmosphere, the better off you are,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost like a home away from home,\u201d Garner added of the program.\n\nWilliams, meanwhile, touts success on the students\u2019 desire for positive change.\n\n\u201cIt only works because of the energy,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been out of the schools and other programs where people just come in like they\u2019re doing you a favor. Here, they come in and they\u2019re thirsty.\u201d\n\nNassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman knew right away things would move a mile a minute when Williams first pitched him on the program a few months ago.\n\n\u201cWe believe in law and order,\u201d Blakeman said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re the safest county in America. But just putting people in jail is not the sole solution to the problems.\n\n\u201cWe have to get people to reinvent their lives in a productive way, to be good citizens and good members of society.\u201d\n\nNassau initially poured $1 million into Rebound on the Road and recently pledged another $300,000 after seeing the success of the first graduating class.\n\n\u201cIn the long run, this makes us safer because these people won\u2019t get back into crime,\u201d Blakeman said.\n\n\u201cIt brings down our recidivism rate \u2014 and it gives them hope.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, it\u2019s given Williams a dream job for life on Long Island.\n\n\u201cIf Saint John\u2019s called me up and asked me to coach, I would say no,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI want to be helping people with their lives, not score more points.\u201d",

      "text": "Country music star Spencer Hatcher\u2019s mom stabbed to death in home invasion\nThe mother of an up-and-coming country star was stabbed to death after a stranger broke into her Virginia home and attacked her and her husband, according to authorities.\nHolly Hatcher, 62, whose son is music artist Spencer Hatcher, was murdered in her home north of Harrisonburg last Sunday by 41-year-old Kevin Moses Walker, WTVR reported.\nHer husband, Michael Hatcher, 65, was also wounded in the terrifying attack just before midnight Aug. 3, but managed to shoot Walker dead after retrieving a handgun from his vehicle.\n\u201cThis is a highly unusual, apparently completely random [attack] with an individual with no known history of violent behavior of any kind, or even criminal behavior of any kind,\u201d Rockingham County Sheriff Bryan Hutcheson told a press conference.\nTwo days before the killings, Walker, of Pikesville, Maryland, rented a campsite at Endless Caverns in New Market, Va., and bought a large knife at a nearby Walmart, according to investigators.\nThe day before the killing, Walker\u2019s abandoned vehicle was discovered near Endless Caverns by Virginia State Police after cops say he rammed into the store there, but didn\u2019t steal anything.\nPatrol vehicles and a drone were deployed, but there was no sign of him, and police had no idea of the horror that was about to unfold.\n\u201cThere was no indication of any violence or potential for any violence from the offender that the Virginia State Police became aware of throughout that investigation,\u201d Hutcheson said at the press conference.\nFirst responders found Michael Hatcher outside his home with visible injuries, while Walker was lying deceased in the driveway.\nHolly Hatcher was discovered inside the house with fatal stab wounds.\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be questions that will never be answered, but all I can tell you is we\u2019ve cried, we\u2019ve hurt, and we\u2019ve hugged, and we have found more love than we have ever known has existed between us, and between you,\u201d Michael Hatcher told the press conference in an emotional statement.\nSpencer Hatcher, who also appeared at the press conference beside his father, announced on social media he was canceling several upcoming shows.\n\u201cIt is with a heavy heart and overwhelming sadness that \u2014 due to a monumental loss in our family \u2014 I must cancel my upcoming shows at VOA Country Music Fest in Butler County, OH (8/8) and at Rockingham County Fair in Harrisonburg, VA (8/11 & 8/12),\u201d he said in the Instagram post.\nAuthorities are still investigating a motive for the slaying, Hutcheson said.\nHolly Hatcher has been remembered as a beloved teacher in the rural Virginia community where she worked for the past 19 years.\n\u201cShe poured her heart into her work, positively impacting countless students and colleagues. Her loss is deeply felt by the entire Rockingham County Public Schools (RCPS) family,\u201d a tribute on Facebook read."

      "text": "Nassau County partners with ex-NBA star Jayson Williams to help recovering addicts get truck-driving jobs\nNassau County has partnered with former NBA star Jayson Williams to help those suffering from addiction get their commercial driver\u2019s license \u2014 and secure well-paying truck driving jobs that will hopefully keep them on the right path.\nThe new program \u201cchecks a lot of boxes to make sure that people are healthy,\u201d Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman said at a Wednesday morning press conference in Mineola, announcing the collaboration with Williams\u2019 organization, Rebound.\nCounty officials say the joint program \u2014 which will be funded in part by $200,000 from opioid lawsuit settlements \u2014 will lend a hand to downtrodden, formerly addicted people and help them steer their lives in the right direction.\n\u201cThe program is you come in, you get drug tested and you meet with over 40 different carriers because there\u2019s 800,000 jobs needed right now in the tractor trailer industry,\u201d Williams said.\n\u201cSo you get a job right when you get in. All you have to do is finish the program successfully, and you\u2019re off. And at this point, you are making a starting salary at $65,000 a year.\u201d\nThis will give them a solid paycheck, benefits and keep them busy \u2014 which will hopefully prevent recidivism, Blakeman added.\n\u201cIt keeps them productive, it gives them self-esteem, it gives them a sense of purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cThey wake up in the morning and they have something to do.\u201d\n\u201cWe have people that are coming out of jails and prisons throughout the United States, and if they don\u2019t have a productive job, they\u2019re going to go back to a life of crime,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis will \u2026 give people a second chance to lead a productive life.\u201d\nWilliams is no stranger to second chances.\nThe 56-year-old former NBA star \u2014 who spent most of his 11 seasons with the then New Jersey Nets \u2014 frequently found trouble in his personal life, and served a 27-month sentence for the 2002 accidental shooting of his limo driver, Costas Christofi.\nHe also had other, more minor scrapes with the law, including an alleged 2009 suicide attempt in New York City, a North Carolina bar fight, accusations that he fatally shot his Rottweiler after losing a bet and a drunken car accident that put him in Rikers Island for nearly a year.\nHe also pleaded guilty to cocaine possession in 2007, and struggled with addition to alcohol and prescription drugs \u2014 eventually being forced into rehab by pals Charles Oakley, the legendary New York Knicks forward, and Curtis Martin, the famed New York Jets running back, according to The Palm Beach Post.\n\u201cI had no purpose,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI was like a ship without a rudder. Nobody would give me the opportunity to get back on TV or to do the things I wanted to do. I ballooned up to about 316 pounds. My life was just a mess.\u201d\nHe has since recovered, and started Rebound with the intention of helping others.\nOn Wednesday, Williams said he\u2019d been around trucking his whole life \u2014 his dad drove tractor-trailers, and he\u2019d sometimes go along.\n\u201cWe\u2019d pull from Elizabeth, New Jersey \u2014 we\u2019d pull Budweiser down, and then we\u2019d pull shrimp back,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I\u2019ve been in this industry a long time. It\u2019s a passion of mine.\u201d\nGetting ex-addicts away from the drugs and into the trucks is a \u201cperfect mix\u201d that will give those in recovery \u201cthe opportunity to get themselves together and see some of the world,\u201d he added.\n\u201cThey just want a job,\u201d Williams continued. \u201cYou give a man a job, you give him hope, and he\u2019s got self-esteem and self-respect, and he can go out in this world and change it. That would help the recidivism. You know, it really does.\u201d\nBlakeman echoed this, and said helping those in need is \u201cwhat government should be about.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a Republican thing. It\u2019s not a Democrat thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about helping people. We have an opioid crisis in this country. We\u2019ve got to get serious about helping people, and I think that the opioid funds that we\u2019re dedicating today will be put to good use.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re very, very honored that you pick Nassau County to start this program.\u201d"

      "text": "Trump takes control of DC police, deploying National Guard in historic capital crime crackdown \u2014 and warns NYC could be next\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump announced a sweeping crime crackdown in DC on Monday, placing the city\u2019s police department under federal control and deploying the National Guard to patrol the streets \u2014 while warning New York City could be next.\n\u201cI\u2019m announcing a historic action to rescue our nation\u2019s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse. This is liberation day in DC and we\u2019re going to take our capital back,\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\u201cOur capital city has been overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged-out maniacs and homeless people. And we\u2019re not going to let it happen anymore. We\u2019re not going to take it.\u201d\nTrump vowed to \u201cclean it up real quick,\u201d \u201clike we did on the southern border\u201d with illegal immigration.\nThe Home Rule Act, which granted DC self-governance in 1973, allows the president to assert emergency control of the Metropolitian Police Department (MPD) for 30 days. Congress can pass a joint resolution extending the authority.\nDocuments formalizing the takeover were transmitted to Congress Monday afternoon and DC police officials set up a meeting later in the day with White House officials to discuss the new arrangement.\nTerry Cole, administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, will temporarily lead the 3,400-officer MPD under the supervision of Attorney General Pam Bondi.\nIt was not immediately clear how the National Guard deployment will proceed \u2014 including numbers and neighborhoods where they will be sent \u2014 but members of that force historically assist law enforcement in a supporting role and do not have the ability to make arrests.\nJustifying his action Monday morning, the president displayed a chart showing that DC has more murders per capita than the capital cities of cocaine-exporting Columbia, cartel-plagued Mexico, and terrorist hub Iraq.\n\u201cWe doubled up on Baghdad,\u201d Trump commented.\n\u201cYou people are victims of it too. You are reporters and I understand a lot of you tend to be on the liberal side. But you don\u2019t want to get mugged and raped and shot and killed. And you all know people, friends of yours, where that\u2019s happened.\u201d\nTrump cited many high-profile recent crimes in the capital, including the Aug. 3 attack on former Department of Government Efficiency staffer Edward Coristine, 19, during an alleged attempted carjacking and the June 30 murder of congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, 21, in a drive-by shooting.\nTrump also mentioned the 2023 carjacking of Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), the near-fatal stabbing of an aide to Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) the same year by a \u201cdemented lunatic\u201d and the shooting death of a three-year girl in July.\nThe president described criminals lawlessly cruising about town on unauthorized ATVs and motorbikes and said he planned to beautify the District by fixing road medians, broken marble and potholes.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums too\u2026I know it\u2019s not politically correct,\u201d Trump said, teasing apparent plans to get rid of public housing in high-property-value DC.\n\u201cWe\u2019re getting rid of the slums where they live.\u201d\nHomeless encampments will also be removed from all public places, including in parks and underpasses, the president vowed, while the US Park Police \u2014 under the control of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum \u2014 will be responsible for the removal of graffiti.\nDC officials say they won\u2019t resist\nDistrict Mayor Muriel Bowser, an elected Democrat, confirmed Monday afternoon that she would comply with the federal takeover.\n\u201cI\u2019m going to work every day to make sure it\u2019s not a complete disaster, let me put it that way,\u201d Bowser said at her own press conference, at which she called Trump\u2019s move \u201cunsettling and unprecedented.\u201d\n\u201cThe main point is this: Everybody should follow the law, the police and the community. And that\u2019s the case now, it was the case last week and it was the case the week before,\u201d she said.\nThe mayor added that she was particularly concerned that \u201call law enforcement be identifiable by uniform, a badge, a jacket, so that people know that they are law enforcement.\u201d\nTrump first ordered federal officials, including members of the FBI, DEA and Border Patrol, onto the streets of DC the night of Aug. 7-8.
