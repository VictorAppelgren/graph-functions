      "feedback": "Actionable upgrade in one paragraph: tighten the 0–3 week view by making the causal chain explicit and testable, then codify near‑term catalysts and a crisp monitor plan around three anchors. First, collapse the autos tariff channel into a testable model: policy moves (tariffs cut from 27.5% to 15%) raise US cost input for Japanese automakers; management commentary has suggested most price moves have been seasonal, yet Nikkei data indicate firms are “passing some of the expense … to American car buyers,” implying near‑term price pressure and possible margin compression (S15934PBQ). Ground this with concrete near‑term anchors: Ford says autos/parts tariffs will cost >$2B this year; Toyota NA earned a loss in North America despite a $5.8B quarterly profit elsewhere; U.S. tariff relief has not fully erased cost pain (S15934PBQ). Translate to a near‑term reaction function: if pass‑through is ongoing, expect sticky or rising headline/core auto inflation and slower auto demand/margins; if relief or demand is weaker than feared, some cooling could appear in CPI/PCE prints. Catalysts to watch over the next 2–3 weeks include auto price signals from earnings calls, CPI/PCE autos components, and any further tariff policy signals. Bring in a second channel with numbers from credit markets and lending behavior to frame consumer resilience: personal‑loan pricing hinges on broader policy/inflation; fixed vs. variable terms and origination fees drive true borrowing costs, with APR ranges from roughly 8.99%–35.49% and soft pulls advised to avoid score impact (S7M6BJSRT). Invalidation triggers include any CPI/PCE prints showing autos prices rolling over or a material disruption to tariff pass‑through (or an official tariff rollback signaled by policy makers), plus any evidence that automakers capex/shifts to U.S. production materially slows or accelerates. Finally, resolve conflicts (eg, management comments denying price hikes vs Nikkei pass‑through) by presenting a transparent, triangulated view: cite the Nikkei signal as the near‑term push, the management statements as potential offsets, and Ford/Toyota margin data as sentiment/real‑economy checks; structure the write‑up as Base/Bull/Bear near‑term paths with explicit levels to monitor (auto price trajectory, CPI autos component, and tariff policy updates) and clearly cite only S15934PBQ, S7M6BJSRT, and U1KRCQOYR.",
