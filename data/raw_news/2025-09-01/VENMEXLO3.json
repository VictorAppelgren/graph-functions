      "text": "- A new study found four-day workweeks without pay cuts boost well-being.\n- The study tracked 2,896 employees across six countries, who reported less burnout and better sleep.\n- Many countries, including Belgium and Iceland, have been rolling out four-day workweeks.\nIf you ever feel like the five-day workweek leaves you burned out, you may not be imagining it.\nA new global study led by Boston College researchers Wen Fan and Juliet Schor found fresh evidence that four-day workweeks \u2014 without a pay cut \u2014 are beneficial for employees' well-being.\nOver a six-month period, the researchers tracked nearly 2,896 employees across 141 organizations in the US, UK, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. They also tracked a control group of 300 people working a traditional five-day workweek.\nThese organizations voluntarily participated in the four-day workweek trials and were given eight weeks ahead of time to restructure their workflows to maintain productivity. Some chose to eliminate activities such as unnecessary meetings to meet their new goals.\nResearchers asked questions such as \"How would you rate your mental health?\" to evaluate workers' well-being two weeks before the trial started, and again six months into their new schedule.\nAccording to the study's results, after six months of only working four days a week, workers self-reported less burnout, better sleep, and higher job satisfaction.\nSchor, an economist and sociologist at Boston College, told Business Insider that six months into their new schedule, 67% of workers reported reduced levels of burnout, 41% said their mental health improved, and 38% experienced fewer issues with sleep. The control group of workers did not show a meaningful change in any of the metrics.\nWhile the study did not specifically measure productivity \u2014 and the responses were self-reported \u2014 when compared to before the change in schedule, 52% of workers said they became more productive despite working fewer hours.\nEmployees who saw their work time reduced by at least eight hours a week experienced the biggest gains in mental and physical well-being, but even smaller reductions delivered measurable benefits across all metrics, compared to workers at 12 companies that stuck with the traditional five-day schedule.\nThe new findings add to a growing body of evidence in favor of the four-day model.\nA widely cited 2022 trial in the UK tracked 3,300 workers at 73 companies who shifted to a four-day workweek, and most supervisors of those workers reported either stable or boosted productivity.\nBelgium introduced a law in late 2022 allowing workers to compress their 40-hour week into four longer days without losing pay, while Iceland is taking a similar approach for most workers by simply reducing hours.\nLithuania allows public sector workers with young children to work 32-hour weeks at full pay, and Dubai is trialing a temporary four\u2011day week for public sector employees throughout the summer."

      "text": "- Average commute times vary for workers across the US.\n- The US Census Bureau measured states' mean commute times from 2019 to 2023.\n- Workers in New York State have the worst commute, at an average of 32.8 minutes.\nWhile commuting may be a thing of the past for remote workers, it's still a daily task for the majority of Americans in the workforce.\nAccording to a July 2024 report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 73% of the workforce did some or all of their work from their workplace in 2023, compared to just 35% who did some or all of their work from home.\nAnd with RTO mandates in place for major companies like Amazon, AT&T, and Starbucks, it seems commuting isn't disappearing anytime soon, despite some workers' protests.\nBut what state you work in can play a significant role in how long your commute will take, data from the US Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) 5-Year Estimates shows.\nThe data was collected from 2019 to 2023 and included a section dedicated to learning more about participants' journeys to work, with questions relating to their workplace's location, how they traveled there, if they carpooled, what time they left for work, and how long it took to commute.\n\"Commuting patterns and characteristics are crucial to planning for improvements to road and highway infrastructure, developing transportation plans and services, and understanding where people are traveling in the course of a normal day,\" the report said.\nSo, whether you're eyeing a job in a new state or are curious about how your commute compares to those of your peers across the country, here's a look at the 10 worst states for commuters, based on longest average commute times.\n10. Washington\nWorkers in Washington can expect to spend an average of 27 minutes commuting.\nAccording to the survey, nearly 65% of workers drove alone for their commute via car, truck, or van, while 8.7% carpooled.\nAn additional 4% used public transit (excluding taxis), 3.1% walked, and 1.9% used another mode of transportation.\n9. Virginia\nVirginia workers spend an average of 27.6 minutes commuting.\nOf the state's 4.31 million workers ages 16 and above, 2.98 million, or 69.2%, reported driving to work alone for their commute.\n8. Florida\nIt takes workers in Florida an average of 28 minutes to commute.\nDriving alone is the most popular method of transportation, as 72.1% of workers ages 16 and older reported doing so to get to work.\nMeanwhile, 9% carpooled, 1.4% walked, and 1.2% used public transit (excluding taxis).\n7. Illinois\nWorkers in Illinois have the seventh-longest average commute time at 28.1 minutes.\nLike other states, driving alone was the preferred method of transit for 67.3% of commuters.\n6. Georgia\nIn Georgia, the average commute time is 28.3 minutes.\nAlmost three-quarters of workers drove to work alone while 9% carpooled, 1.3% used public transit, 1.3% walked, and 1.8% used other means.\n5. California\nThe average commute time in the \"Golden State\" is 29 minutes.\nOf the 10 states with the longest commutes, California had the largest population of carpoolers, at 9.5%.\nMeanwhile, 67.1% drove alone, 3.2% used public transit, 2.4% walked, and another 2.4% used alternate means.\n4. Massachusetts\nIn Massachusetts, the average commute time is 29.3 minutes.\nMore than 62% of workers drove alone, while 6.9% carpooled, 7% used public transit, 4.2% walked, and 2.5% used other means of travel.\n3. New Jersey\nThe average commute time in the \"Garden State\" is 30.9 minutes.\nOf the state's 4.5 million workers ages 16 and older, 2.9 million drove to work alone.\nPublic transit was the second most popular mode of transit, accounting for 387,422 commuters, or 8.5% of commuters.\n2. Maryland\nMarylanders spend an average of 31.5 minutes commuting.\nNearly three quarters of commuters drove or carpooled, while 4.9% used public transportation, 2% walked, and 1.9% used other methods.\n1. New York\nAnd finally, New York workers have the longest average commute in the country, at 32.8 minutes.\nWhile nearly half of commuters drove alone, around 22% reported taking public transit, the highest percentage of any state. Meanwhile, 6.3% carpooled, 5.7% walked, and 2.6% used another form of transportation."
