      "summary": "On Thursday the U.S. dollar weakened as markets awaited signals from the Federal Reserve at the Jackson Hole symposium, while concerns over the central bank’s independence were heightened by President Trump’s request for Fed Governor Lisa Cook to resign. The dollar’s decline was offset by a modest 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, keeping the euro and pound largely unchanged, and the yen fell 0.3%. Expectations for an upcoming Fed rate cut fell slightly to 79%, and analysts warned that a dovish Powell stance could trigger a sharp Treasury sell‑off and a stronger dollar.",
