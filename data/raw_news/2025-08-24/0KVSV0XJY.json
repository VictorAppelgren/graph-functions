  "title": "Apple\u2019s leaked AirPods Max plans paint a disheartening picture",
  "description": "Apple reportedly has no immediate plans for a next-gen AirPods Max, and it's pretty odd because rivals from the likes of Sony are now offering more for less.",
  "content": "Apple\u2019s foray into the domain of premium over-the-ear headphones with the AirPods Max was fairly well-received. The company delivered a solid noise cancellation and transparency experience, paired with rich sound output and a standout design.\n\nHalf a decade into their shelf life, Apple rolled out an update that enabled lossless, ultra-low latency audio, alongside the ability to mix and create Personalised Spatial Audio with head tracking enabled. Simultaneously, Apple switched them away from the Lightning port to a USB-C inlet when it introduced a modest refresh earlier this year.\n\nIf you, however, have been waiting for a meaningful product update for Apple\u2019s flagship headphones, be prepared for a long winter. Writing in the latest edition of his PowerOn newsletter, Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman notes that Apple currently isn\u2019t working on the next-gen AirPods Max, as the immediate focus is locked on the M5 Mac and iPad refresh, new iPhones, an updated HomePod, and an external display.\n\n\u201cIt makes more sense for the company\u2019s audio team to focus on cranking out new in-ear AirPods annually, as well as supporting speakers and microphones in other products. That means fans of the AirPods Max will probably have to keep waiting,\u201d says the report.\n\nThe AirPods Max continue to be one of the best-sounding premium headphones you can buy right now, especially if noise cancellation and transparency are top priorities. They look unique, and going by Apple\u2019s philosophy, it\u2019s not surprising to see the fundamental design persist even after five years.\n\nBut if you look at the competition, you will realize that rivals have since leapfrogged the AirPods Max in a few crucial areas. Take, for example, the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones. At just 8.96 ounces, they are dramatically lighter than the AirPods Max at 13.6 oz, and offer a fantastic foldable design with a lovely build quality, as well.\n\nThe flagship Sony cans last 30 hours on a single charge with noise cancellation enabled, a healthy 50% more than the Apple headphones. The former also wins with custom EQ settings and plenty of customization options in the companion app, which works equally well on Android and iOS.\n\nFor audiophiles, one of the biggest perks of going with Sony\u2019s headphones is support for the LDAC codec for streaming high-resolution audio, while the AirPods Max are limited to the lower-bandwidth SBC and AAC codecs. And let\u2019s not forget the asking price.\n\nDespite the generation-over-generation price jump, the Sony WH-1000XM6 are still $100 cheaper than the AirPods Max, which Apple continues to sell at a steep $549 in the US market. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra, Sonos Ace, and the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless also cost less but offer a well-rounded package.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what Apple has in the pipeline for its next over-the-ear headphones, but if the company has a long-term vision chalked out for it, a lighter build and deeper audiophile capabilities should be on the upgrade agenda. Will they latch on to the wearable AI trends, as well? Only time will tell.",

      "text": "- Premium materials and design\n- Excellent comfort\n- Best-in-class noise canceling\n- Natural-sounding transparency\n- Impressive spatial audio\n- Hi-res compatibility\n- Tricky volume control\n- ANC can't be turned off\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nBose fans can breathe a sigh of relief. The new Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are a return to form for the company after its four-year experiment with the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700. I say experiment because the NCH 700\u2019s design was a significant departure from the company\u2019s previous efforts and not everyone fell in love with the new direction.\nThough very light and comfy, the NCH 700 could only fold flat, had middling battery life, introduced touch controls, and didn\u2019t necessarily move the needle in the right direction on sound quality.\nBy contrast, the QC Ultra (which have replaced the NCH 700) fold flat and fold up, they (mostly) ditch the touch controls. And Bose has gone to great lengths to put these new cans on par with (or even ahead of) wireless headphones from Sony, Apple, and Sennheiser with its version of spatial audio called Bose Immersive Audio, plus support for lossless and hi-res audio. Their price reflects that effort: the QC Ultra are $429, a $30 price hike over the NCH 700.\nAfter spending over a week with the new QC Ultra, I think Bose has delivered a fantastic set of wireless noise-canceling cans that can stand toe-to-toe with the other flagships.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones: design\nWhether you get them in black, white, or sandstone, the QC Ultra are classic Bose in all the right ways. In addition to the welcome return of the dual-folding design, Bose has upped the luxe factor by fabricating the headband sliders and earcup forks from aluminum. This might offer small benefits in terms of durability, but it definitely adds an element of class, especially as buyers compare them to the all-plastic build of the Sony WH-1000XM5 and the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless.\nIronically, despite the critiques that were thrown at Bose for its fold-flat design of the NCH 700 \u2014 which Sony, Sennheiser, and Apple all copied \u2014 when you compare the zippered travel cases of the QC Ultra and NCH 700 side by side, there isn\u2019t a big difference in size. The QC Ultra\u2019s case is narrower than the NCH 700\u2019s by an inch or so. Inside, you still get a USB-C cable and a 2.5mm to 3.5mm analog cable, though these are now stowed inside an elastic internal pocket instead of the slick hidden compartment that graced the NCH 700\u2019s case.\nThe headband has been widened from the NCH 700\u2019s dimensions, and the soft rubber has been replaced with even softer and better-cushioned synthetic leather, which is also used on the ear cushions.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones: comfort, indeed\nThe QC Ultra are essentially identical to the NCH 700 and Sony XM5 in weight at 8.96 ounces, which keeps them among the lightest noise-canceling headphones you can buy. On your head, they feel solid and balanced, with a clamping force that\u2019s just strong enough to keep everything where it should be, and no more. Compared to the NCH 700, you notice two things right away: the Ultra\u2019s headband does a better job of distributing pressure, and they hug your head more securely. For me, that makes them more comfortable than their predecessors, especially across the top of my head. Overall, I think I still prefer the Sony XM5 (they just feel lighter) and Sennheiser Momentum 4 (cozier), but I\u2019d take all three over the AirPods Max in terms of comfort any day of the week.\nThe headband sliders are very grippy. Once you set their length, they don\u2019t budge at all. This also makes them tricky to adjust. The technique that usually works best on many headphones \u2014 expanding the headband to its biggest size, putting the earcups on your ears, then reaching up with your fingers to pull the headband down to the right size \u2014 won\u2019t work with the QC Ultra. There\u2019s just too much resistance.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones: controls and connections\nTouch controls can be great, and I\u2019ve had good experiences with them on Sony, Sennheiser, and Bose headphones in the past. But I just prefer physical buttons. They work predictably, you know exactly where to press with your thumb or fingers, and they don\u2019t care if you\u2019re wearing gloves.\nSo am I happy with the QC Ultra\u2019s controls? Mostly, yes. Bose has managed to consolidate three buttons, plus touch controls on two earcups on the NCH 700 down to just two buttons and one touch control on a single earcup on the QC Ultra. The heavy lifting is performed by the multifunction button, which controls playback, ANC modes, and call management.\nNCH 700 users might miss having a dedicated button for ANC \u2014 I kind of miss it myself \u2014 but that\u2019s tempered by my huge relief at not needing to cycle between three different ANC modes every time I press it.\nPerhaps the biggest change is the elimination of the voice assistant button. Not only is the assistant button gone, but so is the assistant. The NCH 700 gave iPhone users a choice between a button-activated Siri and a voice-activated Amazon Alexa, while Android users could choose between Google Assistant and Alexa. The QC Ultra is strictly BYOA (bring your own assistant), and if you want to access it, you\u2019ll need to enable the shortcut option (a long press on the volume touch control) and select voice assistant access as your preferred shortcut. The other options are to hear the battery level announced, change immersive audio mode, and Spotify Tap.\nI\u2019m not a big voice assistant user when it comes to earbuds and headphones. But there\u2019s no denying the convenience of being able to summon one hands-free, so it\u2019s a shame to see this convenient feature disappear.\nThe combo power/Bluetooth button is self-explanatory, which just leaves volume control \u2014 a raised 1.5-inch line that sits a little farther out from your head than the buttons. Because it sits in the valley of the earcup, it\u2019s easy to find with your thumb. But it suffers the same fate as many touch controls \u2014 it\u2019s inaccurate. Intuitively, you might think you would begin at the bottom of the line and slide your thumb upward or downward gradually to slowly increase or decrease the volume as though it were a real slider. But no \u2014 you need to use small, swiping gestures instead. These can shift volume a little or a lot, and it\u2019s hard to master the difference between these extremes. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no setting in the Bose Music app to help you out. You either figure it out, or you remain vaguely frustrated by it, as I have been.\nStill, Bose partially redeems itself by giving the QC Ultra the wear sensors that the NCH 700 lacked, so now you can automatically pause your tunes when you remove the headphones. In fact, when you remove them, you can choose to have them enter a standby state after a certain amount of time to save power. They\u2019ll power back up as soon as you put them on again.\nAs with Bose\u2019s other headphones (though notably, not its wireless earbuds), the QC Ultra support Bluetooth Multipoint for two simultaneous connections. To get the most out of it, the QC Ultra let you see and manage those connections in the Bose Music app, and they also announce the connected devices when you power them on, which can be very handy. If you find it annoying, you can also turn it off.\nTransitioning between connected devices is seamless. Unlike some Multipoint devices, which make you choose between running a hi-res codec like aptX Adaptive or using Multipoint, the QC Ultra have no such restrictions.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones: sound quality and spatial audio\nThe QC Ultra may be a throwback in terms of design, but their sound quality is decidedly evolutionary. The NCH 700\u2019s sound signature is centered on Bose\u2019s energetic approach to high frequencies, putting a lot of \u2014 some might argue too much \u2014 sparkle into vocals, while taking a conservative approach to bass. The QC Ultra step the sparkle back just a smidgen, but they add copious amounts of low-end. This puts them closer than ever to Sony\u2019s more bass-forward tuning, such that the Sony WH-1000XM5 and QC Ultra now sound like slightly different interpretations of the same sound signature.\nFor me, it\u2019s a move in the right direction \u2014 I happen to enjoy Sony\u2019s sound a lot \u2014 but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some Bose fans find it too thick through the low end.\nIf you don\u2019t love it, the Bose Music app provides EQ presets that deemphasize that extra bass. You can also manually adjust the low, mid, and high EQ sliders. But, maddeningly, Bose still doesn\u2019t let you save those tweaks as your own presets.\nAccording to Bose, its CustomTune technology automatically adapts the sound of the QC Ultra to your ears every time you put them on. You\u2019ll hear the same zoomy Bose startup sound that the company uses on its other headphones, but this time, that sound is used to analyze the shape of your ears. Does it work? It\u2019s impossible to say \u2014 Bose doesn\u2019t give you the option to turn it off.\nOwners of select Android handsets can take advantage of the QC Ultra\u2019s adoption of Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon Sound platform, which \u2014 depending on your phone \u2014 can deliver lossy hi-res audio at up to 24-bit/96kHz or lossless CD-quality audio at 16-bit/48kHz, via Qualcomm\u2019s aptX Adaptive Bluetooth codec.\nIf you\u2019re a Spotify junkie, there\u2019s probably zero benefit to be had. But those who have jumped on the lossless and hi-res lossless train via services like Amazon Music, Apple Music, Qobuz, and Tidal will be able to hear a more nuanced rendition of their favorite tracks. Thanks to the QC Ultra\u2019s Bluetooth Multipoint, I was able to place my iPhone 14 side by side with a Snapdragon Sound-equipped Motorola ThinkPhone and perform reasonably quick A/B comparisons using Apple Music.\nBoth sounded great. But where the iPhone delivered thick, meaty sound, especially in the lower-mids and bass, the ThinkPhone offered a more refined, precise, and detailed performance.\nWhere things get really interesting is the QC Ultra\u2019s new support for spatial audio. There are two distinct versions of spatial audio. When a track has been recorded in an 3D format like Dolby Atmos Music and is then played back using software that can render multichannel 3D sound into just two channels for headphone listening (like Apple Music), I consider it \u201cnative\u201d spatial audio. Native spatial audio will work on any set of headphones.\nBut you also can apply computational audio to good ol\u2019 stereo recordings to create a simulated 3D sound either in an app or in hardware like the QC Ultra. I think of this as \u201cvirtual\u201d spatial audio.\nTraditionally, attempts at virtual spatial audio have had mixed results. It can sound fake or forced. And it can have a damaging effect on some frequencies as the software tries to widen the sound field. In short, it can sound bad enough that you revert to regular stereo and never look back.\nWith its Immersive Audio, Bose has created the best virtual spatial audio I\u2019ve heard so far. It gives you a genuine alternative to stereo that doesn\u2019t sound cheesy or forced. It preserves detail and frequencies better than any competing system and, depending on the track, you may actually prefer it to the original recording.\nThe QC Ultra also provide sensor-based head tracking that lets the Immersive Audio mode untether your music from your headphones, giving you the sense that the music is being played from stereo speakers mounted in front (and slightly above) your listening position. Turning your head does the same as it would in real life \u2014 it sounds like you\u2019ve turned away from the source of the music and it happens in perfect sync with your head movement.\nNot everyone will like Bose\u2019s Immersive Audio \u2014 just like not everyone will like native spatial audio tracks in Dolby Atmos Music. But for those who do, it\u2019s a killer feature.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones: noise canceling and transparency\nHere\u2019s what you really want to know: the QC Ultra cancel noise more effectively than the Apple AirPods Max and the Sony WH-1000XM5. If you want better noise cancellation, you\u2019ll have to switch to wireless earbuds like the Bose QuiteComfort Ultra Earbuds or the Sony WF-1000XM5. But when it comes to wireless headphones, the QC Ultra Headphones are the current king of quiet.\nThe QC Ultra provide impressive levels of hush in a variety of scenarios. I haven\u2019t had a chance to put them to the quintessential ANC test of an airplane cabin during flight. But given how they perform in other locations like noisy city streets, riding a transit bus, or working in a busy coffee shop, I have every reason to think they\u2019ll ace the cabin test too.\nThey\u2019re also insanely good for transparency. Until now, the transparency gold standard has belonged to the AirPods Max, and deservedly so. They\u2019re excellent. But the QC Ultra sound more natural. The AirPods Max put a slight emphasis on higher frequencies \u2014 arguably a smart move that helps you hear voices more clearly \u2014 while the QC Ultra have a more neutral sound. Since both headphones give you roughly equal amounts of situational awareness, it\u2019s going to come down to personal preference, and I prefer the QC Ultra.\nPlus, Bose actually one-ups Apple via the QC Ultra\u2019s Active Sense \u2014 an option when you\u2019re in transparency mode that listens for loud noises and automatically kicks the cans into ANC mode to protect you hearing. Apple has this technology, too, but only on its AirPods Pro Gen 2 wireless earbuds. The AirPods Max (for now) lack this feature. It works well, but there can be up to 2 seconds of lag between a loud sound (like an emergency vehicle siren) beginning and Active Sense kicking in. On the AirPods Pro, it\u2019s almost instant.\nBose also has rethought the way you work with ANC on the QC Ultra. On the NCH 700, you could reach into the Bose Music app and manually adjust the amount of noise cancellation at any time. But the headphone controls required that you cycle through three favorite ANC settings. Those settings could be any amount of ANC you wanted, but you couldn\u2019t choose to use just two of them \u2014 a limitation I never understood.\nOn the QC Ultra, favorites have been replaced by Modes, and they\u2019re far more flexible. You can create as many modes as you like, and each mode can have its own level of ANC, or you can select a wind block option that overrides ANC control. But the best part is that you can then pick which of these modes will be your favorites, as long as there are at least two favorites at any given time. Want to switch between maximum ANC and maximum transparency? Just select the default Quiet and Aware modes as your two favorites. Want to toggle between transparency and wind noise mode? Create a mode that uses wind noise and then select it as a favorite along with Aware mode and make sure Quiet mode is deselected.\nIt\u2019s a great system with just one flaw: you can\u2019t create a mode in which ANC is simply turned off to preserve battery life. In fact, there\u2019s no way to turn off ANC at all \u2014 you can choose how much you want (or you can pick transparency), but there\u2019s no setting to eliminate both.\nThere\u2019s also a somewhat idiosyncratic aspect to Modes. Bose includes a default mode for Immersive Audio, which is illogical. Immersive Audio can be enjoyed whether you\u2019re using full ANC or transparency \u2014 it\u2019s a layer on top of your ANC preference, not its own thing.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones: call quality\nIf we lived in a world where Apple had never created the AirPods Max and Sony had never created the WH-1000XM5, I\u2019d be telling you that the Bose QC Ultra Headphones are the best wireless headphones for call quality. It wouldn\u2019t be hard to defend that statement. Even in noisy conditions, the QC Ultra all but erase environmental sounds, leaving just your voice. And when you\u2019re in transparency mode, you can hear your own voice very clearly as well.\nHowever, the QC Ultra struggle at times to keep your voice from wavering or sounding echoey as it strives to eliminate those unwanted background noises. Sony and Apple do a better job with this balancing act, keeping your voice sounding more consistently audible regardless of what\u2019s going on around you.\nBut just to be clear: The QC Ultra are still excellent for calls \u2014 especially indoors. And if you have a Snapdragon Sound-equipped phone, your voice will sound richer and fuller thanks to aptX Voice. It\u2019s just that the AirPods Max and XM5 are better for folks who need to take their calls in a wide variety of conditions.\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones: battery life\nBose, like Apple, seems to believe that no one really needs their wireless headphones to last more than about 20 to 24 hours between charges, and maybe it\u2019s right. But given that companies like Sennheiser and Sony have proven that far more juice than that can be packed into a set of wireless cans (up to 60 hours in the case of the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless), it\u2019s a bit difficult to commend the QC Ultra for their 24-hour stamina \u2014 a number that drops to 18 hours when using immersive audio and ANC \u2014 especially when there\u2019s no longer an option to extend that time by disabling both modes.\nThere is a quick-charge option: 15 minutes will buy you an extra 2.5 hours of playtime (2 hours in immersive audio mode), so even if 24 hours isn\u2019t quite enough, you\u2019ve got a Plan B.\nOne thing to keep in mind with the battery is that you\u2019ll need it even for wired listening via the included analog cable. If the battery is totally dead, you can power it directly using the USB cable, at which point you can listen wired or wirelessly, but the QC Ultra can\u2019t recharge simultaneously.\nI\u2019ve managed to find some minor nits to pick with the Bose QC Ultra Headphones, but overall, these wireless headphones are seriously impressive. They cost a bit more than their predecessors, but make up for the extra investment by delivering a better design and tons of features. Some of those features, like Immersive Audio, noise canceling, and transparency mode, represent the current state of the art and are reason enough to consider upgrading from the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700.\nAnd if you\u2019re contemplating your first set of serious wireless headphones? I\u2019m confident you won\u2019t regret going with the Bose QC Ultra."

And something of a disappointment.\nAs the company\u2019s first set of wireless headphones, the $449 Sonos Ace hit almost every note you could ask for. They\u2019re sleek. They\u2019re comfortable. They sport very effective noise cancellation. They\u2019re compatible with both wired and wireless lossless audio connections. They offer a spatial audio experience that, in some respects, is unique. Plus they boast a battery life that surpasses two of the biggest players in this space: Apple and Bose.\nAnd if the Ace were made by almost any other company, I\u2019d be unreserved in my admiration for these noise-canceling headphones.\nBut they\u2019re not just wireless headphones made by any other company. They\u2019re made by Sonos, which makes the most popular ecosystem of wireless speakers on the planet. That brings with it an additional set of expectations. Expectations that didn\u2019t quite materialize.\nWishing for Wi-Fi?\nLet me address one very important aspect of the Ace before I dig into the overall experience of using them.\nDespite bearing the Sonos brand, these are not Wi-Fi headphones (as many had hoped they would be). They\u2019re Bluetooth headphones, and with the exception of one special feature (which I\u2019ll get to in a moment) they work just like any other wireless headphones you can buy. Once the Ace are paired to your phone, simply open up any audio app and hit play.\nA lack of Wi-Fi means the Ace do not behave like Sonos\u2019 other products. You can use the Sonos app to adjust certain Ace-specific settings \u2014 like EQ, ANC, and spatial audio \u2014 and for this kind of thing the app works well enough. But you can\u2019t stream audio to the Ace from music sources you\u2019ve added to the Sonos app. You can\u2019t group them with other speakers or enable things like alarms or timers. And any hopes you had of being able to wander freely around your home or office, listening wirelessly through your Wi-Fi network (instead of being tethered via Bluetooth to your phone or computer), remain just hopes. At least for now.\nThis was an intentional decision on the part of the company, but I think it\u2019s a missed opportunity. Sonos\u2019 portable speakers (the Move, Move 2, Roam, and the new Roam 2) are designed to move seamlessly from Wi-Fi to Bluetooth and back again, and I think the Ace should be able to do so, too.\nMoreover, I think the Sonos app should work the same way whether you\u2019re at home or not. Why spend time setting up favorites, playlists, and other customizations if you have to give them up when you\u2019re out of Wi-Fi range?\nIronically, this lack of full Sonos integration might just be the one thing that keeps Ace buyers from ripping the headphones from their heads in frustration: The newly redesigned Sonos app remains a chaotic mess of unsupported features and terrible performance, despite a stream of updates aimed at fixing it.\nBut ultimately this raises a very important question: If the Ace don\u2019t play nicely with the rest of Sonos\u2019 products, why buy them instead of one of the many superb alternatives?\nTV Audio Swap for Sonos soundbars\nSonos\u2019 answer to that question is the Ace\u2019s one unique feature. If you own a Sonos Arc soundbar, you can set up TV Audio Swap, which lets you pipe full Dolby Atmos spatial audio from the Arc to the Ace. Eventually, TV Audio Swap will work with Sonos\u2019 other current soundbars, too. Curiously, Audio Swap uses Wi-Fi, not Bluetooth, which suggests there may be the possibility of greater Sonos integration at some point.\nA long-press on the Ace\u2019s multifunction button and any TV audio that was playing on the Arc shifts seamlessly to the headphones. As the name suggests, TV Audio Swap doesn\u2019t let the two devices play simultaneously \u2014 it\u2019s one or the other \u2014 so you won\u2019t be able to use it to help one member of the family while everyone else listens to the soundbar.\nAudio Swap\u2019s big selling point is its ability to deliver a spatial audio listening experience that (when listening to Dolby Atmos content with head tracking turned on), replicates what it\u2019s like to sit in a room with a full 7.1.4 sound system. Even when the content isn\u2019t Dolby Atmos, the spatial audio setting will do its best to \u201cupmix\u201d stereo or 5.1 sound into a 3D-like presentation.\nIt\u2019s very convincing and makes for a far more engaging movie and TV experience than you\u2019d get with a standard set of wireless headphones.\nIt\u2019s also not quite as realistic or cinematic as Apple\u2019s version of TV Audio Swap, which lets you send head-tracked spatial audio to a set of Apple AirPods Max or AirPods Pro when connected to an Apple TV 4K. This may improve when Sonos releases its TrueCinema feature later this year, which attempts to mimic your room\u2019s real-world acoustics.\nStill, Sonos\u2019 version is more versatile than Apple\u2019s as it works with any TV audio coming through the Arc soundbar, and not just audio that originates from the Apple TV 4K. And if you don\u2019t like how spatial audio (and/or head tracking) sound, you can disable them and listen in standard, two-channel stereo instead.\nFor all of Sonos\u2019 fanfare around the feature, Audio Swap feels like it still needs some polish. Volume levels aren\u2019t always preserved \u2014 if the Arc is set to 75% when you swap to the Ace, it will retreat back to 15% when you swap back, even if you tell the system you want it louder. Sometimes it worked, mostly it didn\u2019t.\nI couldn\u2019t get the Ace to get loud enough. Levels 1-45 were almost inaudible, while levels 46-99 sounded more like what I would have expected from 1-45.\nSometimes, swapping from the Arc to the Ace resulted in a crackling, staticky audio on the headphones. Attempting the swap again usually fixed it. And sometimes, the Ace\u2019s audio would fall out of sync, by as much as a second. When this happened, only restarting the show or movie proved to be a reliable solution.\nI\u2019m also peeved that Sonos has chosen to restrict Audio Swap to HDMI content. You read that right: If you\u2019re streaming music from the Sonos app or AirPlay to the Arc, Audio Swap is unavailable.\nAs fun as Audio Swap is (when it works), you not only need a Sonos Arc to take advantage of it, you also need a reason to use it. For me, there are hardly any times when I\u2019m watching our main TV (the one with the Arc) and I don\u2019t want to be listening out loud.\nInspired design\nNormally when we say \u201cthat\u2019s an inspired design,\u201d we mean that the design is inspirational, and while that could be said of the Sonos Ace, I mean it literally: You can clearly see where Sonos took inspiration specifically from Apple\u2019s AirPods Max and Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM5. It\u2019s as if Sonos grabbed these two products and created a hybrid of both, then infused it with its own DNA.\nThat sounds like it could go sideways really fast, but Sonos\u2019 designers have an unerring sense of simplicity. And the Ace are, in my humble opinion, gorgeous. In some ways, the Sonos Ace are more Apple than Apple and more Sony than Sony.\nThe matte-finish plastic (in your choice of black or soft-white) resists fingerprints better than Sony\u2019s, and the color-matched, tubular stainless steel headband sliders combine reassuring strength with high-end looks. The magnetically attached ear cushions (which Apple also uses) is a nice touch.\nSome have complained that the XM5 don\u2019t make their owners feel like they just spent $400. The Ace manage the opposite feat (and even more considering they cost an additional $50), with materials and build quality that go well beyond what we\u2019ve become accustomed to.\nThese extra ingredients come with additional weight, but Sonos seems to have made some very intentional choices: The Ace weigh 11.18 ounces. That\u2019s not quite as featherweight as the XM5 (8.82 ounces), but it\u2019s still about 17% lighter than the AirPods Max (13.6 ounces).\nThe fold-flat design, while not loved by all, makes the Ace very travel friendly whether you use the provided hard-shell case, or you simply slip it beside your laptop. That\u2019s mostly thanks to the ultra-low-profile earcups. They don\u2019t just look good on your head \u2014 combined with the Ace\u2019s 1-inch-wide headband, they create a thinner package than either the XM5 or AirPods Max.\nGreat comfort\nBalancing clamping force so that a set of headphones exert just enough pressure to stay put, yet not so much that they cause discomfort (plus engineering a headband that simultaneously provides grip and cushioning), is something that even the most experienced headphone brands occasionally get wrong.\nWhile not quite as comfy for me as the Sony XM5, I wore the Sonos Ace for hours at a stretch, and they remained pressure-free, even while wearing glasses. The ear cushions provide an excellent acoustic seal and yet never make my ears feel too hot. Or at least, they don\u2019t get hot during normal use \u2014 exertion like running or working out will definitely push the limits of comfort. Side note: Sonos says the Ace will survive such activities, but they do not carry an official IPX rating for water or sweat resistance.\nSmart, simple controls\nSonos has almost entirely shifted to touch controls on its speakers, including a new gesture-based volume slider on the Move 2, Era 300, and Era 100. But one of the hallmarks of good design is knowing when to keep an existing approach for the sake of consistency, and when to change course for the sake of usability.\nFor the Ace\u2019s controls, Sonos went with three physical buttons. The right earcup has a button for switching between active noise cancellation (ANC) and transparency modes (and triggering voice assistants), and a clever multifunction button/slider for playback, volume, and call management.\nThe only other control is a small button for power and Bluetooth pairing that sits on the bottom edge of the left earcup. Each control can be used while wearing gloves.\nSupplementing these controls is a pair of wear sensors in each earcup that can be used for auto-pause and auto-resume of music when you take the Ace off your head or replace them.\nThe multifunction control works seamlessly. Press once for play/pause, twice to skip forward, and three times to go back. Sliding it up or down once (it\u2019s spring-loaded) bumps volume up or down one increment, while holding it in one of these positions provides a continuous change. The gestures produce subtle feedback tones to let you know everything is going as expected.\nBetter yet: The multifunction button has an entirely different tactile feel from the ANC button. My thumb never failed to find the right control at the right time.\nThe ANC button is slightly less effective. To avoid loud clicking sounds inside the earcups, Sonos has used a soft-touch mechanism. It\u2019s perfectly silent. But sometimes \u2014 even though I thought I had pressed it deeply enough to trigger the mode change \u2014 I needed to press it again a little harder.\nWhen the presses are recognized, the shift from ANC to transparency happens very quickly.\nIf there\u2019s one thing I would change, it would be to add a control for turning head tracking on and off without using the Sonos app.\nANC and transparency\nSonos says it developed a proprietary solution for the Ace\u2019s noise management system, and it shows.\nThough it can be hard to nail down precise numbers without calibrated measurement gear, my time comparing the Ace to its rivals has convinced me that Sonos has once again threaded the needle between Apple, Sony, and in this case, Bose too.\nThe Ace are more effective at masking external sounds than the AirPods Max, and at times, they even seemed to surpass Sony\u2019s XM5 \u2014 an astonishing accomplishment. Only Bose\u2019s class-leading QuietComfort Ultra Headphones outflanked the Ace in the silence department, and even then it was a close call.\nI recently returned from a trip to Scandinavia, and the Ace proved to be superb travel companions, killing almost all unwanted cabin noise inside the aircraft. Even the loud crying of a baby seated two rows behind me was reduced to the point where it was a mild background sound that could be ignored if I wanted to.\nThe one area where the Ace trails the competition is wind noise. Even a very light breeze could be heard despite the ANC system\u2019s best efforts to squash it.\nTransparency also was excellent, though in this category there is Apple and then there\u2019s everyone else.\nWhich is to say the Ace provide very clear reproduction of your surroundings. From that point of view, it really doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re wearing headphones. The only telltale sign is when listening to your own voice, which doesn\u2019t sound quite as natural as the AirPods Max. But we\u2019re really talking about small differences. Unless you repeatedly put on the Ace and then the Max, you probably wouldn\u2019t notice.\nThat Sonos sound\nSonos speakers sound great \u2014 it\u2019s one of the chief reasons the company has become so popular. The Ace follow suit, with a sound signature that is very pleasing and balanced, right out of the box. I think they\u2019re also the first Sonos product that hasn\u2019t inspired me to immediately reach for the EQ adjustment to increase bass.\nThere\u2019s very good clarity across the frequencies, and plenty of detail in the midranges, where it counts. Bass is warm-toned and carefully controlled, providing a strong, grounding presence without stomping on the mids or muddying the highs. The Ace aced my usual torture test of playing Billie Eilish\u2019s bad guy at 75% to 80% volume, letting Eilish\u2019s whispery vocals make their way to my ears without being trampled by the song\u2019s insistent and powerful bass notes.\nAudiophiles may feel underserved by the Ace\u2019s limited EQ options \u2014 they get the same bass/treble sliders in the Sonos app as all of Sonos\u2019 other products \u2014 but for most folks, that\u2019s plenty of control to achieve the specific sound they\u2019re after. Pushing the bass slider to its maximum, for instance, provided more low-end boost than I\u2019d ever want or need.\nWhat you don\u2019t get is an especially wide or detailed soundstage for stereo listening. Some headphones (especially open-back models) can create a sense of openness, reproducing the sensation of listening to stereo speakers in a room. The Ace tend to keep things closer to your head. It\u2019s not a bad thing, just something to be aware of if you have strong preferences in this area.\nSonos has equipped the Ace with the usual SBC and AAC codecs, which work with vast majority of Bluetooth devices, but it has also included Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon Sound technologies, for use with compatible Android smartphones. Among the enhancements is support for lossless, CD-quality sound via aptX Adaptive. With wireless earbuds, I can usually hear the subtleties that Qualcomm\u2019s codecs reveal, but with the Ace, they were less apparent.\nWhat I did notice, however, was an improvement in detail and compression when I connected the Ace using its two wired options: USB-C and 3.5mm analog. USB-C is the perfect option for Android phones (and iPhones 15 and newer) when you want to get the best possible sound quality, although the supplied cable is far too short to make this comfortable. Fans of dedicated headphone amps and DACs may prefer the analog connection, despite the fact that the Ace re-digitizes that analog signal before finally converting once more to digital.\nThe Ace compare very favorably to other wireless headphones at this price. While not as punchy or vibrant as Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM5 or as clear through the mids as the AirPods Max or Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless, the Ace are a great listen, whether for music or video content.\nSpatial audio and head tracking\nSonos\u2019 approach to spatial audio on the Ace is unusual and requires a bit of an explanation.\nEarlier, I told you about how you can get a spatial audio experience when using the Ace with the Sonos Arc and TV Audio Swap. Sonos considers this a discrete feature because the computational heavy lifting required to take a true 7.1.4 Dolby Atmos soundtrack and render it for headphone listening is done by the soundbar, not the Ace.\nIt\u2019s why, in the Ace\u2019s settings inside the Sonos app, you\u2019ll see Spatial Audio and Head Tracking as separate options under a TV Audio Swap heading (if you have a Sonos Arc).\nJust above that section, under Sound, is a second Head Tracking option. This one is purely for Bluetooth audio. The key difference between them is that Sound Head Tracking won\u2019t add any additional spatial audio processing. If you\u2019re listening to stereo, it\u2019s still stereo. If you\u2019re listening to Dolby Atmos, via Apple Music or Amazon Music as examples, it\u2019s still Dolby Atmos. The only thing that changes when you enable Head Tracking is your relationship to the sound as your head moves.\nWhen enabled, the main components of your audio (vocals, lead instruments, etc.) stay fixed in space directly in front of you, giving you that listening-in-front-of-a-stage feeling. When disabled, your music moves with you, as it would on any regular set of headphones.\nSonos says this head-tracking option has been optimized to work best with Dolby Atmos content, which makes sense given that Dolby Labs helped with the technology. It\u2019s hard to argue: If you like Dolby Atmos Music, the Ace\u2019s head tracking makes the immersive listening format sound even more lifelike. But I was equally impressed by just how good Dolby Atmos Music sounds on the Ace, even when head tracking isn\u2019t in use.\nCall quality\nI really like making calls on the Sonos Ace indoors. Voice pickup is excellent. And if you switch to transparency mode, you\u2019ll get the same benefit as I described earlier: hearing yourself clearly, which is the key to reducing fatigue when using earbuds or headphones for calling.\nEven in the busy hubbub of a crowded coffee shop, your callers will be blissfully unaware of your surroundings.\nOutdoor settings can prove more challenging. Traffic noises tend to be a lot louder than any sounds you get inside. The Ace almost entirely eliminates them, but doing so can take a toll on voice pickup. At times, your voice may simply disappear as the algorithms fight to suppress unwanted sounds while keeping your voice audible.\nBattery life\nSonos states the Ace get 30 hours of playtime with ANC engaged, and considerably more when it\u2019s off. So far, that seems to be accurate. My only hesitation is that Sonos has historically had trouble with battery life not quite living up to expectations. The Sonos Roam, for instance, initially tested well, hitting close to its 10-hour rating. However, over the following months, many users reported dramatically lower battery life.\nStill, even if the Ace end up lasting less than the advertised 30 hours, it won\u2019t be a total deal-breaker. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones top out at 24 hours and Apple\u2019s AirPods Max only get 20 hours of life. I suspect for most people, that\u2019s enough.\nThe verdict\nFor a company that has never produced a wearable product in its entire 22-year history, the Sonos Ace headphones are a remarkable achievement. In one fell swoop, Sonos has created a product that easily goes toe-to-toe with best wireless cans you can buy, and in some cases exceeds what they can do.\nThe Ace don\u2019t push the envelope on sound quality \u2014 I suspect some very critical listeners will still prefer Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM5, Bose\u2019s QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, or Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum 4 Wireless. And yet, by any measure, they sound great. If you\u2019ve resisted spending this kind of money on a set of wireless cans until now, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be disappointed.\nWith noise-canceling and transparency modes that are unqualified successes, and tons of wireless and wired connection options, the Ace feel like they\u2019re future-proofed for years of enjoyment. And their exclusive TV Audio Swap feature, while still a bit clunky and in need of refinement, will no doubt win many fans within the Sonos community over time, especially as Sonos adds its non-Arc soundbars to the private-listening party.\nWhere the Ace truly shine, however, is their comfort and simplicity. At the end of the day, they\u2019re simply one of best-designed sets of wireless headphones on the market. Software can be incrementally improved over time. How a set of headphones fit and feel is much harder to change.\nNone of this changes the fact that the Sonos Ace fall short of their full potential. They don\u2019t take advantage of their built-in Wi-Fi connection to create the kind of seamless experience Sonos fans were hoping for. And while that\u2019s a blessing in disguise at the moment given the current sorry state of the Sonos app, it prevents Sonos owners from seeing the Ace as a must-have complement to their existing home audio system."

Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nIn some ways, Sony didn\u2019t need to update its flagship wireless headphones. Even as of May 14, 2025, one day before the official launch of the WH-1000XM6, you\u2019d have been hard pressed to find a list of the best wireless headphones (including here at Digital Trends) that didn\u2019t put Sony\u2019s WH-1000XM5 in first place. This, despite the fact that the XM5 are now three years old, and virtually all of their competitors have been update during that time. That\u2019s how good they still are.\nBut we all have a tendency to gravitate towards the newest, shiniest object, and besides, for all of its merits, the XM5 did have one or two areas that needed improvement. So here we are.\nLet me cut right to the chase. The WH-1000XM6 are amazing. Stellar. The best. And if I\u2019m being honest, you should just buy the WH-1000XM5 while they\u2019re still available. Here\u2019s why.\nDesign\nIf you\u2019re looking for an excuse reason to buy the $450 WH-1000XM6, look no further than their updated design. Sony may claim otherwise, but this is where you\u2019ll find the biggest difference between them and their predecessors.\nI\u2019ve always liked the look of the XM5, but now that I\u2019ve laid my eyes on the XM6, I can\u2019t unsee the areas where the XM5 feel a little cheap. For the XM6, Sony has found a plastic formulation that doesn\u2019t look or feel like plastic at all. It\u2019s more like synthetic stone, and it gives these cans an upscale vibe that the XM5 were aiming for, but never quite hit.\nThe earcups are now seamless, solid shells, their matte surfaces interrupted only by the eight microphone openings. But even these are beautifully crafted, with flush-mounted metal grilles instead of gaping holes. The earcushions are now much easier to remove.\nThe hinges are also remarkable. When you look at the AirPods Max, Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, or the WH-1000XM5, you realize that when you connect a headband to a set of earcups via a single point of contact (instead of the usual yoke approach), you tend to sacrifice the ability to fold up and fold flat, leaving a less compact shape.\nSony\u2019s new hinges bring back that missing second axis of movement without resorting to the older, yoke-style architecture \u2014 which Bose opted for on its QuietComfort Ultra Headphones.\nThe other significant change is the headband. It\u2019s now wider, better padded, and asymmetrical. The first two are all about enhanced comfort, but Sony hopes the asymmetrical shape will help folks figure out the headphones\u2019 orientation a little faster. Sonos did the same thing on the Ace headphones, but in both cases, I find it easier to just look at the earcups (if the two control buttons are in my left hand, I know they\u2019re the right way \u2018round).\nOh, and let\u2019s give Sony some serious props for giving the XM6\u2019s travel case a quick-release magnetic closure. So much better than a zipper!\nSony WH-1000XM6 specs\n| Price | $450 |\n| Weight | 8.96 ounces |\n| Form factor | Closed-back, over-ear |\n| Noise cancellation | Yes |\n| Battery life | 40 hours per charge (ANC off), 30 hours (ANC on) |\n| Charging | USB-C |\n| Voice assistant | Native smartphone access Hands-free Google Assistant (Android only) |\n| Multipoint | Yes |\n| Spatial audio | Yes (with head tracking, Android only) |\n| Hi-res audio | Yes (wired/wireless) |\n| Fast pairing | Google Fast Pair |\n| Bluetooth/codecs | BT 5.3 with AAC, SBC, LC3, LDAC |\n| Auracast | Yes (Android only) |\nComfort, controls, and connections\nThe headband isn\u2019t the only change for comfort\u2019s sake; the earcushions are also more generously padded. Sony has upped the clamping force, too, and the result is a more secure fit that remains very comfortable, even for several hours in a row. I don\u2019t really get the whole full-size over-ear headphones thing at the gym or while running, but I know there are many who do. If that\u2019s your thing, the XM6 are a better choice than the XM5. Just remember, they have no official IP rating for water or sweat resistance.\nI\u2019d be remiss if I didn\u2019t point out that the XM6\u2019s clever new hinge design relies partly on a spring-loaded mechanism, similar to the one Apple uses on the AirPods Max. This puts the pivot point where the hinge meets the earcup, as opposed to the XM5\u2019s mechanism, which puts it at the midpoint of the earcup.\nFor me, it creates a small but perceptible gap between the bottom of the earcup and my head, unless I extend the headband sliders more than feels normal. It\u2019s not a deal-breaker by any means, it\u2019s just something to be aware of.\nThe XM6\u2019s controls are almost identical to the XM5. The right earcup gives you physical buttons for ANC mode selection and power/pairing, while the left is touch sensitive for playback and volume gestures. The one difference is that you can now enable a microphone mute function via the ANC button while on a call.\nIt\u2019s a very intuitive setup and works brilliantly. The only drawback is that XM6\u2019s controls aren\u2019t cold-weather friendly unless you have capacitive-compatible gloves.\nStill, unlike the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones and Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless Headphones (which also use touch-based gestures for some or all controls), Sony gives you an alternative: hands-free voice commands. If you enable them in the Sound Connect app, you can say, \u201cHey, Headphones,\u201d followed by \u201cplay song,\u201d \u201cpause song,\u201d \u201craise the volume,\u201d etc. Basically, everything you can do with a gesture or button, you can do with your voice, and it\u2019s seamless. The one caveat is that you must choose between Sony\u2019s voice commands or button-based access to your phone\u2019s voice assistant (or hands-free Google Assistant on Android).\nSony\u2019s Bluetooth connections are always rock solid, and the WH-1000XM6 are no exception. When using an Android phone, Google Fast Pair makes pairing very easy (plus it adds the XM6 to Find My).\nMultipoint lets you keep the cans connected to two devices simultaneously, and the Sony Sound Connect app makes managing those devices a breeze.\nSound quality\nOne of the biggest reasons Sony\u2019s 1000X series has dominated lists of the best headphones over the years is their sound. These cans have always provided powerful, precise, full-frequency sound, with plenty of detail. The XM6 are no exception.\nWhat these new cans bring to the table are subtle improvements in clarity, especially through the midrange \u2014 traditionally the hardest part of the frequency spectrum to achieve additional detail.\nYou can think of it as peeling back another layer of onion skin.\nWhen Sony introduced the XM5, it shifted slightly away from the XM4\u2019s bass-forward balance to a more neutral tuning. Curiously, even though the XM6 is a twin to the XM5 when it comes to sound signature, that added level of detail and nuance helps low-end bass feel tighter. It\u2019s not more prominent \u2014 again, the balance is almost identical \u2014 but you can hear the improvement in separation from the lower mids.\nSony offers a variety of EQ presets and customization options in the Sound Connect app as well as its \u201cFind My EQ\u201d personalization test, but I ignored them all \u2014 the company\u2019s factory tuning is that good.\nAll of this to say, if you like the XM5, I think you\u2019ll like the XM6 even more when listening critically, particularly if you have an Android phone and take advantage of Sony\u2019s LDAC Bluetooth codec.\nAnd if you\u2019ve never tried any of Sony\u2019s flagship headphones, prepare yourself to be wowed. They\u2019ve always been a top-notch choice, and the XM6 are the best so far.\nThe one thing I wish Sony had included is USB Audio. In this price range, it\u2019s nearly ubiquitous \u2014 even Apple added it to the AirPods Max, and that company has a track record of being slow to adopt new tech. USB Audio would give the XM6 a truly lossless connection with support for hi-res audio up to whatever Sony\u2019s built-in DAC can handle (likely 24-bit/96kHz or better). For such a great-sounding set of cans, this feels like a real oversight.\nSpatial audio\nNew for the XM6 is the ability to spatialize any stereo sound using the Sound Connect app\u2019s listening mode settings. Sony calls it 360 Reality Audio Upmixing and has decided that it should be all about making video content more immersive. It even calls the spatial audio mode \u201cCinema.\u201d\nDespite the name, it works on any audio \u2014 not just movies or TV \u2014 and in typical Sony fashion, it\u2019s masterfully executed. The soundstage opens up, getting wider, deeper, and even a little taller, and there\u2019s a greater sense of spatial separation between audio elements like vocals and instruments. Most importantly, Sony\u2019s processing mostly avoids the unpleasant level changes that lesser spatial systems often produce. In the worst versions, bass can become smeared, and vocals lose much of their presence. Sony\u2019s Cinema keeps things focused. Stereo purists aren\u2019t going to love it \u2014 there\u2019s no avoiding the sensation that you\u2019re listening to processed sound \u2014 but if you dig that more immersive sound, Sony\u2019s version is a lot of fun.\nSadly, iPhone users will have to satisfy themselves with a \u201cstatic\u201d spatial presentation. The XM6\u2019s head tracking is only enabled via Android 13 or higher. For music, I don\u2019t think it matters. For Sony\u2019s cinematic ambitions, however, head tracking is the key that unlocks the sensation of sitting in a home theater. It keeps the relative position of each virtual 5.1 speaker locked in space \u2014 turning your head makes it feel like you\u2019ve turned away from the central source of dialogue right in front of you.\nIt\u2019s not as effective as Apple\u2019s version using the combo of an iPhone or Apple TV 4K with a set of AirPods Max or AirPods Pro, and it\u2019s currently limited to just a few services like Netflix and YouTube.\nNoise cancellation and transparency\nActive noise cancelling (ANC) on the XM5 is already excellent. In fact, the only headphones that can beat them are Bose\u2019s QuietComfort Ultra Headphones. For the XM6, Sony went all out to change that ranking, giving the new cans more microphones (12 vs 8) and seven times faster ANC processing.\nThese changes give the XM6 an edge over their predecessors, and I\u2019d even go so far as to say that in certain circumstances, where external noises tend to be highly variable, they do a slightly better job than the QuietComfort Ultra. But for pure, brute-force destruction of constant droning sounds like in an airplane cabin or on public transit, the QuietComfort Ultra still reign supreme.\nHowever, if you\u2019re very sensitive to ANC side effects (some people report an unpleasant, sucking sensation), you may be better off with the WH-1000XM6. Sony\u2019s ANC system may not cancel quite as much noise as Bose\u2019s, but it\u2019s also gentler on your ears.\nTransparency mode is also excellent, giving you a nearly perfect reproduction of the outside world. Are the WH-1000XM6 better than the AirPods Max and QuietComfort Ultra? No, but you may still prefer Sony\u2019s version, which slightly boosts the higher frequencies associated with speech, instead of going for a completely natural passthrough.\nI think what I like most about Sony\u2019s ANC and transparency is how quickly you can shift between them \u2014 it\u2019s nearly instant.\nYou can also turn on Sony\u2019s Speak-to-Chat feature, which switches to transparency mode automatically when it detects you speaking. It\u2019s very clever but your mileage may vary: I couldn\u2019t find a setting that reliably detected my voice without being triggered by false positives like clearing my throat.\nCall quality\nAt the risk of sounding repetitive, calling on the WH-1000XM6 is also a subtle improvement over the XM5, which were already pretty darn great. I\u2019d say the biggest difference is that the XM6 preserve more of your voice\u2019s natural sound. There\u2019s better tonality and less sibilance on all of those ess-sounds.\nThe XM6\u2019s ability to cancel background noise remains top-notch. Your callers will likely never know you\u2019re walking past a construction site.\nFor the first time, Sony has added a mic muting option, which is very handy. Just keep in mind that your phone app probably won\u2019t reflect these mode changes (the iPhone doesn\u2019t), so you\u2019ll have to remember which mode you\u2019re in.\nYou can switch to transparency mode at any time to hear your own voice more clearly and Sony includes a specific voice boost option in the app to help with that if you need it.\nThe only wireless headphones that are better for calls are JBL\u2019s Tour One M3.\nBattery life\nThis might be the one area where Sony has made no improvements at all. Playtime with ANC on is rated at 30 hours and 40 when it\u2019s off. One minute of charging buys you an extra hour of operation, but a full charge still takes about 3.5 hours.\nDoes it matter? I doubt it. When it comes to battery life, more is always better, but I think most folks can get through 99% of their lives on 40 hours or less.\nThe one big improvement is that you can now charge and use the XM6 simultaneously, something no previous 1000X series can do.\nExtras\nThe XM6 are the first of their kind to support Auracast, which is great. Unfortunately, it requires manually shifting to LE Audio within the Sound Connect app, then switching to the Android Bluetooth menu to find and connect to a local Auracast broadcast, which is a pain in the butt. Also, iPhone users are out of luck.\nThis is disappointing to me. Much like Sony\u2019s spatial audio feature, it feels like a half-measure. Moreover, we know that better is possible \u2014 JBL\u2019s Tour One M3 suffers from none of these limitations.\nSony has given its Adaptive Sound Control feature (which turns ANC on/off based on activity) a boost with its new scenes feature. You select from different scenes like running or going to the gym, and then choose the time and place associated with these activities and what you\u2019d like to listen to (on an iPhone, your choices are Apple Music, Spotify, or Endel). I appreciate that Sony wants to build some intelligence into the listening experience, but I don\u2019t find these features especially useful.\nConclusion\nSony\u2019s WH-1000XM6 are a meaningful upgrade from the company\u2019s WH-1000XM5, and take their place as the best overall wireless headphones I\u2019ve ever tested. They\u2019re not perfect \u2014 no USB audio, a bizarrely awkward Auracast setup, and spatial audio that can only be used to its fullest on Android, are drawbacks that must be considered, especially given that Sony has increased the price of its flagship cans to $450.\nI acknowledge that none of these issues stopped me or anyone I know from enjoying the XM5, and in all of the other areas that matter (sound, ANC, design, and comfort), the XM6 are a stellar choice.\nBose is still better overall for noise canceling, but the XM6\u2019s real competition comes from its own predecessor. Now that Sony has discounted the XM5, and will likely keep prices low until it runs out of stock, you\u2019d be well advised to consider that model before buying."

      "text": "- Amazing battery life\n- Outstanding sound\n- Effective wind noise reduction\n- Comfortable\n- Effective ANC\n- No auto-off function\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nSennheiser has been making premium headphones for decades. As technology has evolved, its headphones have kept pace by including that new technology. But when it comes to style, Sennheiser has always stuck to its guns. Its headphones have always had a distinctive, classy designer look to them \u2014 case in point are the Sennheiser Momentum 3 Wireless.\nWith the new Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless \u2014 up for preorder on August 9 and available in full on August 23 \u2014 Sennheiser has taken a more conventional approach. In fact, looking at the Momentum 4 Wireless, it\u2019s impossible not to think that Sennheiser is taking direct aim at Sony\u2019s wildly popular XM-series headphones.\nThat was a smart move, and I think Sennheiser has done a terrific job with the Momentum 4 wireless. These headphones have all the latest features, incredible battery life, and sound better than the Sony XM-series headphones. But should you buy them?\nLet\u2019s see if we can figure that out together.\nVideo review\nAll-new style\nAs these photos make clear, Sennheiser has pivoted from a design made for headphone enthusiasts to a design that will appeal to a massive audience spanning those who work from home to those who work on airplanes. The Momentum 4 Wireless look like they mean business when it comes to doing business. They won\u2019t call too much attention while taking a Zoom call, and they\u2019ll fit right among all the Sony and Bose headphones you see folks wearing on airline flights these days.\nThe Momentum 4 Wireless are remarkably comfortable. I initially was worried about the scant amount of padding underneath the headband. But after wearing the Momentum 4 Wireless for over 100 hours at this point, I can tell you that between the cushy earcups, perfect clamping force, and generally light weight, the Momentum 4 Wireless are a pleasure to wear for long periods of time. No pinched crown, no ear sweats, no other fatigue-inducing elements, just all-day (or all-flight) comfort.\nThe Momentum 4 Wireless case is exactly what you\u2019d expect: a zippered, reinforced soft-sided affair that cradles the headphones, a USB-C charging cable, headphone cable, and my old, increasingly irrelevant friend, the airline adapter. The case material matches the exterior of the headband\nThe Momentum 4 Wireless do not collapse completely down. Like the Sony WH1000-XM5, the earcups simply rotate in for a flatter profile, and that\u2019s it. As such, the case is a bit larger than those that accompanies more compact headphones, though I have not found this to be an annoyance.\nMomentum 4 features\nThe Momentum 4 Wireless have just one button. A short press calls up your phone\u2019s digital assistant. Press for three seconds to turn the headphones on or off, or press for five seconds to put them in pairing mode. Even though I think it\u2019s silly that two commands are separated by two seconds of pressing, it ended up being a nonissue thanks to the headphones\u2019 Bluetooth auto-pairing feature.\nThe rest of the controls for music and calls are found on the surface of the right earcup. Tap the earcup to play/pause, swipe back and forth to advance or go back a track, and swipe up and down for volume control. The gestures relevant to phone calls kick in when you receive or are on a call.\nThe Momentum 4 Wireless have industry-leading battery life.\nThe left earcup does nothing but produce excellent sound.\nUnfortunately, it doesn\u2019t seem that the Momentum 4 Wireless have an auto-off feature that triggers after, say, 15 minutes of being them not being worn. I know this because I packed them up in my backpack, tossed the backpack in the back of my car, drove home, and had constant Bluetooth connection issues with my car stereo because the Momentum 4 Wireless kept trying to connect to my phone during the drive. When I arrived at my destination, I noticed that my phone was still connected to the headphones. And when I pulled my backpack out of the trunk, I heard the headphones blaring away from within. I found this odd because the headphones have an excellent sensor inside the earcups that prompts them to pause music when they are removed from the head.\nIt turns out the sensor is so sensitive that it can be fooled into thinking the headphones are pressed against a head when they are sandwiched in their case. As such, it is probably a good idea to turn them off manually, though it\u2019s not the end of the world if you don\u2019t because the Momentum 4 Wireless have industry-leading battery life.\nAs you might expect, there is an app you can use with the Momentum Wireless 4, and it offers decent functionality. Set the ANC to automatically adjust to your environment, or manually control how effective the ANC is, from block-it-all-out mode all the way to transparency mode. You can also create and name \u201czones,\u201d so the headphones adopt a custom ANC and/or EQ setting based on areas you frequent. As for that EQ control? It\u2019s a very basic, three-band affair, with basic bass, midrange, and treble adjustments. Frankly, I never felt a need to adjust the EQ.\nMomentum 4 specs\nThe Momentum 4 wireless use Bluetooth version 5.2 with AAC, AptX and Aptx Adaptive codec support. I found the Bluetooth connection to be both remarkably stable and impressively long-range. I was able to walk about 100 feet from my phone without so much as a blip in the music I was listening to. It was only after I took a turn around a corner and placed several walls between myself and the headphones that I experienced any signal dropout. In other words, the Momentum 4 Wireless\u2019 connection strength is best in class.\nWhat about battery life? Dig this: 60 hours \u2014 and that\u2019s with ANC turned on. With ANC off, they\u2019ll go even longer. To put things in perspective, that\u2019s double the battery life of the Sony XM5. I\u2019ve been putting that battery life claim to the test, and after 63 hours of listening with active noise-canceling engaged, I still have battery to spare. Frankly, I think that\u2019s incredible. Well done, Sennheiser.\nMomentum 4 noise-canceling\nWhile Sony and Bose still offer the most effective noise reduction available in headphones today, Sennheiser is catching up quickly. The Momentum 4 Wireless\u2019 ANC is so good that, when playing music, I was unable to detect a difference between them and the Sony XM5 in a head-to-head comparison. It wasn\u2019t until I turned my music off and used the ANC on its own that I was able to hear the Sony XM5 cutting down a broader spectrum of noise to a slightly quieter level than the Momentum 4 Wireless.\nStill, while the Sony XM5 (as well as the XM4) may technically have slightly superior noise canceling, I think the Momentum 4 Wireless\u2019 ANC is, in practice, good enough to make most listeners extremely happy.\nMomentum 4 call quality\nI would characterize the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless\u2019 call quality as very good. During my testing, the person on the other end of my phone calls reported that my voice came through very clearly. That is until I walked onto a busy street with noisy cars and buses passing by. At that point, some of the noise around me did bleed into the call. This is typical of most headphones, however, though it is worth noting that the Sony XM5, Bose NC 700, and Apple AirPods Max all do a slightly better job of filtering out noise around you when making calls.\nAnother area of improvement for call quality would be the manner in which the user\u2019s voice is piped into the headphones. When I made calls, I struggled to hear my own voice as well as I do with the aforementioned competing headphones, so I had to monitor how loudly I was speaking.\nOne area in which the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless are unmatched for call quality, though, is wind-noise reduction. I\u2019ve never heard wind noise so effectively canceled by any of the other headphones I have tested over the past few years.\nMomentum 4 sound quality\nLet\u2019s not mince words here: The Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless have better overall sound quality than the Sony XM5, Bose QC45. Bose NC 700, and Apple AirPods Max. Granted, appreciation for sound quality is highly subjective, but for my money, the Momentum Wireless 4 offer a level of refinement, detail, and bass presence that I feel is unmatched by the competition.\nMore bass? Yes. But also better bass.\nBass performance is what stood out most prominently when I first started listening to music on the Momentum 4 Wireless. Now, to be clear, the Momentum brand has always had more pronounced bass than most of Sennheiser\u2019s other headphone offerings; however, the bass in the Momentum Wireless 4 isn\u2019t just pronounced (aka, bass-forward) it is deep, tuneful, and poignant in a way that outclasses competing models from Sony, Bose, and Apple. It\u2019s more bass, yes, but it\u2019s also better bass.\nOnce I got past my delight at the bass performance, I noticed a very open, spacious soundstage. With the Sony Xm5, the audio image seems to manifest inside your head. With the Momentum 4 Wireless, though, the soundstage seems to be set up all around you. There is depth, precise instrumental placement, and other elements of sonic holography that I\u2019ve typically heard only in the most high-end wired headphones I\u2019ve tested.\nAlso, I feel the treble is better refined than most competing headphones, with detail, articulation, and texture that is sure to please audiophiles. I also enjoyed the clarity of vocals a great deal, with transparency that is more akin to an open-backed headphone than a closed-back design, never mind one which is employing active noise canceling and digital sound processing to achieve its sonic signature. To me, this is especially remarkable.\nMore broadly speaking, I simply have more fun listening to music on the Momentum 4 Wireless. There\u2019s more to dig into. More to notice. If you\u2019re more of a passive listener, some of the depth and detail may not register, but it doesn\u2019t take an audiophile to hear how superb the Momentum 4 Wireless headphones sound.\nOur take\nThe Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless are a fantastic set of headphones with very effective noise canceling, solid call quality, and tremendous sound quality. If Sennheiser\u2019s mission was to make a model competitive with the features of Sony\u2019s vaunted XM4 and XM5 headphones, but with better sound fidelity, then I\u2019d say: mission accomplished.\nIs there a better alternative?\nThe Sony XM4 and XM5, Bose QC45 and NC 700, and Apple AirPods Max all offer marginally superior noise canceling and call quality. Those for whom headphones are as much a tool for business as they are for enjoyment may find one of those alternatives to be more suitable. However, for anyone who places sound quality and battery life at the top of their priorities list, the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless will be the better choice.\nHow long will it last?\nGiven their build quality and ability to receive updates, the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless should last well into the future.\nWarranty\nSennheiser offers at two-year warranty on the Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless.\nShould you buy them?\nYes. The Sennheiser Momentum 4 Wireless are among the best-featured and best-sounding headphones on the market and are sure to delight anyone looking for the best combination of modern features and excellent sound quality."

      "text": "- Best-in-class ANC\n- Amazing transparency mode\n- Excellent build quality\n- Excellent sound quality\n- Top-notch call quality\n- Charges via Lightning cable\n- Heavy on head\n\u201cWhy you can trust Digital Trends \u2013 We have a 20-year history of testing, reviewing, and rating products, services and apps to help you make a sound buying decision. Find out more about how we test and score products.\u201c\nI\u2019m a headphone geek and have been for almost two decades now. And without a doubt, the $550 Apple AirPods Max are the most fun headphones I\u2019ve reviewed in 10 years \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you should buy them.\nI\u2019ve heard a lot about these headphones over the past few weeks, and now that I\u2019ve gotten a pair for myself, I have to be frank: I don\u2019t agree with a lot of what I\u2019ve heard. I want to dig into these headphones from the perspective of not only someone who has tested gobs of headphones over the years, but as a studio musician, a fan of high-end sound, and a person who likes to make smart purchases with hard-earned money. Let\u2019s examine what\u2019s good, what\u2019s great, and what\u2019s not-so-great about the AirPods Max and, of course, toss in some comparisons to the Sony WH-1000XM4 and the Bose ANC 700.\nBuild quality\nWhen beholding the AirPods Pro, the most striking design element is their metal earcups. They feel great in your hand \u2014 in fact, every part of this set of headphones feels great to the touch. The fabric material in the headband has a cool springiness to it, the telescoping portion of the headband has a satisfyingly smooth movement, the earcups are squishy and covered with a lush textile, and even the oversized digital crown and noise-cancellation/transparency mode toggle button feel great to twist and press. It\u2019s really astonishing just how enjoyable they are to hold.\nBut for as satisfying as they are to the touch, they aren\u2019t called handphones \u2014 they\u2019re called headphones, and they need to feel great on your head. Now for some users, the AirPods Max may feel perfectly fine. Deep earcups, breathable ear cushions, and well-balanced clamping force help a bit. But the problem is that there\u2019s a lot of weight to compensate for. Too much weight in my opinion. These materials are nice. They make the AirPods Max feel super-luxurious, but practically speaking, I feel like these headphones may be too heavy for some folks. Especially if you wear your headphones for hours at a time as I do.\nTo be clear, Apple did an impressive job of reducing strain on the crown and ears by using clever engineering and materials, but there\u2019s a reason headphones like the Sony XM4, Bose ANC700, and even the Bowers and Wilkins PX7 Carbon Edition are made with high-grade plastics and composite materials rather than metal: Because they work well for acoustics, and they are lightweight and comfortable.\nConnectivity\nAs you might expect, the AirPods Max work best with Apple products. Not only do they connect immediately, but they can also switch from one Apple device to another in a snap. Another benefit is that you can use an iOS device to turn ANC off in the headphones section of the control panel, AND you can actually toy with the digital signal processor (DSP) through the accessibility section \u2014 which I will mention again later when we talk sound quality. Unfortunately, if you are an Android user, you lose all of that. There\u2019s no turning ANC off as far as I can tell, and no adjusting the DSP without an Apple device. So for connectivity, AirPods Max win for Apple users, while Sony and Bose, which both have apps for both platforms with lots of adjustability, win for everyone.\nThe oversized digital crown is fantastic.\nControls/interface\nWhen it comes to controls, I have to give it to the AirPods Max. The oversized digital crown is fantastic. It\u2019s easy to find when wearing the headphones, and the volume control is strangely satisfying to turn \u2014 you even hear a little clicking sound as you adjust the volume. The digital crown is also extremely accurate and granular. I had no problem reaching my loudness sweet spot, whereas with other headphones and phone volume controls, I find I\u2019m always one click away from the volume being too loud or too soft.\nAlso, having an almost comically large button just for toggling ANC and transparency mode is actually a feather in the AirPods Max\u2019s cap. Again, finding the button while wearing the headphones is no problem, and the satisfying button press is a far better experience than holding your hand over the right earcup on Sony\u2019s XM4s or searching for whichever button may be the right one on the Bose ANC 700. I used to think the swipe control thing was cool, too, but I\u2019m kind of over it now. The AirPods Max have straightforward controls on the headphones that I want to use. This is the kind of stuff Apple just gets right.\nWhere\u2019s the power button?\nOn the topic of battery life, charging times, and the fact that there is no power button \u2014 this may surprise you: I\u2019ve got zero problems with any of it. Hear me out.\nSome feel the fact that the AirPods Max don\u2019t have a power button and can\u2019t really be shut completely off is ludicrous. I don\u2019t think it is.\nThe AirPods Max go into a low-power mode after a short period when you set them down. In fact, I set them down on my desk at about 8 p.m. and picked them back up at 7 in the morning the next day and they had discharged a measly 7%. I can get that power loss back plus lots more with five minutes of charging, which nets you 1.5 hours of listening time.\nIf the AirPods Max sit unused for about 72 hours, they go into an ultra-low-power mode of sorts, sipping even less power. Practically speaking, with such slow power loss, it is hard to imagine a scenario where needing a power button is absolutely necessary. Perhaps if you keep them around your neck unused all day as a fashion accessory? But even then, it\u2019s not as if they are draining quickly and bound to die on you that day.\nAs for the claimed 20-hour battery life, I\u2019ve found that rating to be conservative. I got closer to 25 continuous playing hours with ANC on, and that\u2019s enough to get through a couple of days of use before you have to think about charging. So I\u2019m good with the battery life, even if the rating is about half that of the Sony XM4 \u2014 in real life, it\u2019s perfectly sufficient.\nI think what\u2019s valuable about this always-on-standby strategy is that if you get a phone call or a Zoom call, they are immediately ready to go. Just put them on and click to answer. I love that \u2014 it\u2019s far better than having to long-press a power button and wait around for the headphones to boot up while the phone continues to ring.\nWhat I don\u2019t love is the USB-C to lightning cable included with the headphones. I think it was a mistake to go with lightning when USC-C is a much more sensible choice.\nThat\u2019s not a case\nOne area in which I agree with other reviewers and commenters is the so-called \u201ccase\u201d that comes with the AirPods Max. Since there are plenty of others trashing this \u201cnot-a-case\u201d as I\u2019ll call it, I don\u2019t feel the need to pile on with more vitriol. It\u2019s not a case, it isn\u2019t protective, and if it weren\u2019t for the magnets inside it, which are needed to activate ultra-low-power-mode, I\u2019d say toss it.\nTransparency mode is amazing.\nANC and transparency mode\nI want to start with transparency mode because it is amazing \u2014 perhaps the AirPods Max most impressive feature. It\u2019s as close to NOT wearing headphones as I\u2019ve ever heard. Everything else pales in comparison.\nI\u2019m also looking forward to checking out the active noise canceling on a flight one day because, from what I can tell, the AirPods Max may just rule the skies. Since I\u2019m not getting on planes just yet, to test the headphones, I tried the AirPods Max, Sony XM4, and Bose ANC 700 near some loud fans and an HVAC system. The AirPods Max did extremely well compared to the best noise-canceling headphones I\u2019ve tested.\nThe AirPods Max do even better with every day sounds like the hammering of a mechanical keyboard, slurping of coffee, and other annoying stuff. I wore them into a coffee shop and was surprised by how little I heard coming from the espresso machine and general barista noises. Is it the best noise canceling on the planet? I can\u2019t say yet. I really need to get on a plane to be sure, but it is darn close. Close enough that I can\u2019t just call the Sony XM4s the reigning champ any longer, as there\u2019s now another big dog on the hill. I will say, however, that the AirPods Max won\u2019t leave anyone wanting for more noise canceling.\nCall quality\nThe AirPods Max are outstanding for making calls and taking video meetings \u2014 even better than the Bose ANC700, which are excellent in their own right. I found that surrounding noises were very well muted, while voice clarity was superb. The AirPods Max are also very adept at handling wind noise.\nSound quality\nBefore I get into fidelity, I do want to mention that I did some testing with Spatial Audio, which if you are unfamiliar, is a 3D sound technology that lets Apple make its headphones compatible with formats like Dolby Atmos Music. I think it is fun for watching movies, but I\u2019m less enthusiastic about its implementation for music. It\u2019s a cool feature, but not a selling point for me.\nWhen it comes to audio fidelity, the AirPods Max sound very good. In particular, I think the midrange has gorgeous presence and clarity \u2014 something that you don\u2019t get as much of from the Sony XM4 since they have have a bump in the midbass that tends to crowd the vocal range.\nThe Sony\u2019s midbass bump is also notable because it lends the XM4 more punch, so when compared directly to the AirPods Max, the Apple cans seem less impactful. That doesn\u2019t mean the AirPods Max lack solid bass. They actually get very deep \u2014 deeper than the Sony XM4 or Bose ANC 700 \u2014 so tonally everything is there. I just noticed that the bass guitar in many of the tracks I like to listen to was less prominent and the kick drum had a little less punch than with the XM4 and Bose headphones. But, as mentioned before, the more balanced midbass allows for the Max\u2019s excellent midrange response.\n\u201cI found Apple Music sounded better than Spotify with the Apple AirPods Max.\u201d\nAs for the treble region, there\u2019s a good amount of sparkle in cymbals and brass instruments, which I enjoyed quite a bit \u2014 sibilance or harshness is not an issue here. However, I didn\u2019t note particularly well-executed instrumental separation, and as far as soundstage and imaging go, I think the AirPods Max fare about average.\nIn general, I feel a little closer to the music when listening to the Sony XM4 and the Bose ANC700, but I feel like I hear more detail with the AirPods Max, which are certainly the most balanced of the three headphones I compared.\nAn interesting note: I found Apple Music sounded better than Spotify with the Apple AirPods Max, and I suspect that\u2019s because Apple\u2019s default streaming quality is higher than Spotify\u2019s.\nI\u2019ve noted that some have said the AirPods Max sound better with the ANC turned off. I did not find that to be the case. Perhaps the frequency response is flatter, but I feel like the music loses some of its life. I also heard that making adjustments to the DSP through the accessibility menu in iOS could improve the sound, but frankly, I like the way they sound out of the box with the balanced setting and the slight boost setting.\nSo from an audio perspective, I enjoy the AirPods Max very much, and I want to continue to listen solely to the AirPods Max a bit longer because I\u2019m guessing my penchant for punch may subside a bit over weeks and months, but for right now, I tend to prefer the Sony XM4 sound signature. That\u2019s a deeply personal preference, though. I can see why someone might prefer the sound of the Max over the long haul, and I\u2019ll adjust this review if I change my tune. They sound very good. Good enough to lend some justification to their $550 price tag.\nIn terms of cool factor, there\u2019s no doubt the AirPods Max have it in spades, and there\u2019s no doubt they are one of the most fun headphones I\u2019ve gotten to test in many years.\nOur take\nThe AirPods Max are darn-near perfect, with best-in-class noise canceling, the most remarkable transparency mode I\u2019ve ever heard, balanced and detailed sound with plenty of deep and musical bass, and a very premium feel. My chief complaints are their weight, which I worry may not work for multi-hour use, and the lack of a proper carrying case.\nIs there a better alternative?\nFor a higher level of comfort, I would suggest considering the Sony WH-1000XM4, which offer competitive sound quality and noise-canceling, and superior battery life in a lighter-weight headphone. The Sony also come with a legit carrying case and are more portable. With that said, the AirPods Max are a wonderfully premium headphone with unmatched build quality.\nHow long will they last?\nGiven the outstanding build quality I just mentioned, I imagine the AirPods Max will last as long as their rechargeable battery will allow them to. They come with Apple\u2019s standard one-year warranty against manufacturer defects.\nShould you buy them?\nIf you don\u2019t mind a heavier headset with a premium price tag, then absolutely yes."

      "text": "Apple\u2019s first over-the-ear headphones have stirred quite a polarizing debate over minimalist looks and a familiar brutalist industrial design language. You can\u2019t quite call them artsy, or a piece of art, for that matter. But if you\u2019ve ever wished to give them such a makeover, casemaker Casetify went straight for the summit with its headphone cover.\nThe company calls it \u201cGirl with a Pearl Earring Collectible Headphone Cover,\u201d and has listed it at a sweet $199, enough to buy a pair of half-decent noise-cancelling headphones. The ambitions are so high that the accessory maker won\u2019t entertain any promotional coupons or discounts for this AirPods Max cover.\nIt seems that sky-high premium for a fabric cover has little to do with any uber exotic fabric material or technical wizardry, and more about the inspiration behind it. To be specific, the cover is modeled after the famous \u201cGirl with a Pearl Earring\u201d painting by famed Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer.\nThe fancy headphones cover borrows the signature blue cover and silky look from the 17th-century painting, and even has pearl earrings dangling from each side. It\u2019s quite a sight to behold, but I\u2019m not sure if an average person would like to go out wearing them, unless their name is Rihanna or Mariah Carey, and the venue is a red carpet in Milan.\nThis won\u2019t be the first such adventure of its kind for Casetify. The company recently collaborated with The Metropolitan Museum of Art and released cases featuring famous paintings from the collection, alongside the Jacques-Louis David \u201cThe Death of Socrates\u201d Limited Canvas Edition Premium Set Box.\nThe company also launched protective gear in partnership with the National Museum of Korea, and hear me out, the Museum of Ice Cream. Interestingly, this won\u2019t be the first time that the brand has made cool headphone gear. The limited edition DRAGON BALL Z SCOUTER Collectible Headphone Case was quite a sight to behold. Take a look:\nThe latest AirPods Max cover from Casetify is part of a collaboration with The Mauritshuis Museum in The Hague. You can check out the entire collection featuring protective cases for iPhones, phone charms, and watch bands here.\nIf art is not your thing, Casetify has also partnered with entertainment franchises such as Dragon Ball-Z, One Piece, Smurfs, Peanuts, Squid Game, Harry Potter, BMW, NBA, and more. Of course, K-pop, too. You can check out all the Casetify Co-Lab products on the brand\u2019s hub."

  "argos_summary": "Apple\u2019s AirPods Max remain a premium over\u2011the\u2011ear option with strong ANC, transparency, and a luxurious build, but Apple has not released a next\u2011gen model and the company is focusing on other products. Sony\u2019s WH\u20111000XM6 updates the flagship with lighter weight, better battery life, and improved spatial audio, while Bose\u2019s QuietComfort Ultra offers superior comfort and ANC in a more affordable package. Sonos\u2019 Ace introduces a TV audio\u2011swap feature that leverages Dolby Atmos, though it lacks Wi\u2011Fi integration, and Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum\u202f4 Wireless delivers exceptional sound quality and long battery life. Together, these competitors highlight the gaps in Apple\u2019s offering and suggest that future AirPods Max updates may need to address weight, battery, and feature parity to stay competitive.",
