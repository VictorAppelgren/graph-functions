  "title": "The Surprising Reason Leaving the Office Earlier Is Fine, But Showing Up Late Is Not",
  "description": "Corporate America is trying to drag the workplace back towards pre-pandemic norms. Some things have changed for good.",
  "content": "Remember the dread you used to feel when you were fractionally late for school, and you had to race to get to class on time or face trouble from your teacher?Now, sitting at your office desk, glancing over at the corner office, that uneasy sensation of being pressured to be on time never went away, did it? That feeling is supported by a recent study that shows that showing up late to work is still highly frowned on, the Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nBut that same study also found that in our post-pandemic working world, where hybrid arrangements still persist, it\u2019s getting easier to leave the office a little earlier, on occasion. This is not a sign that corporate America working norms have softened, however. And if you look under the surface of the trend, it\u2019s not as much an indicator of pro-mental health attitudes as it seems to be. The study was carried out by Chicago-headquartered commercial real estate giant JLL, which used anonymized cellphone data to determine when people arrived and left an office space. The study only covered its own buildings, since this is where it could access this data, but as the Journal notes, \u201cthe firm\u2019s scale and range of tenants make the findings a decent proxy for broader trends.\u201d The data show some geographic variations. In New York, JLL workers were heading home an average 13 minutes a day earlier than they left the office in 2019\u2014nearly a quarter of an hour, or (if you\u2019re getting statistical about it), 1/32 of a full work day. But in Dallas, Texas, workers are leaving a full 18 minutes later than in 2019. And in San Francisco, until recently a bellwether for progressive workplace attitudes? A decent 26 minutes later. Nearly half an hour! What luxury!\n\nBefore you think people are shirking their duties, it\u2019s not the case. Even if companies are more flexible about letting employees clock off a little early to deal with their kids\u2019 extracurricular activities, or hit a restaurant with friends or tackle personal issues, there\u2019s still an expectation that workers will log on a little later on in the evening and check what\u2019s happened so that they\u2019re up to speed for the next morning. There\u2019s a little grain of guilt glistening inside that last paragraph. And there are others, too. One worker the Journal spoke to started Zooming colleagues in Europe as soon as her kids were on the school bus, just before 7 a.m., but if the meetings delayed her physical arrival in the office until 10 o\u2019clock, she felt bad as she walked in. \u201cI still have this sense like it\u2019s weird that I\u2019m getting in now because the day\u2019s already up and running,\u201d she said. All of this speaks to an issue that pervades U.S. workspaces, the Journal says: Productivity theater.\n\nThink of trends like \u201ccoffee badging,\u201d where staff arrive in the morning, say hi to a few people, grab a cuppa joe, then disappear. Or the Gen-Z trend of \u201ctask masking,\u201d making conspicuous, deliberate attempts to look busy in the office even if you\u2019re not\u2014a trend fueled by worries over being replaced by an AI. And then there\u2019s \u201cclock botching,\u201d which is the most damaging form of productivity theater. Here workers string out simple tasks for multiple hours not because they\u2019re skipping work, but because they\u2019re masking the fact they\u2019re right on the edge of catastrophic emotional burnout. Even the American trend of shunning vacation time has been in the headlines recently, with many workers refusing to use their allotted days (even if they have them in the first place) on the grounds they feel guilty for letting people down. Why should you care about this, though?\n\nBecause it\u2019s possible that your workers have different ideas about the importance of how much time is time spent actually working while at work than you do, as a leader. It\u2019s also very easy for \u201cunofficial\u201d habits to fall into place \u2014 be they \u201cshow up early to impress the boss\u201d or \u201cit\u2019s ok if you scoot off five minutes early to catch the bus.\u201d If you have strong feelings about how and when your workers actually work, then communicating this openly and honestly is probably a good idea. It shows workers where you stand, and it may even relieve some of the mental stresses that being late or needing to leave early can cause your staff. Because real life is real life, no matter how many tasks are on the office to-do list. And remember: Gen-Z is shunning the 9-to-5 grind for a reason, and we may have lots to learn from them.",
