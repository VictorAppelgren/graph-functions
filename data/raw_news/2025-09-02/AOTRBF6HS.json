  "description": "Researchers used a simulator to enduce dozens of brave participants with motion sickness and study their brain activity.",
  "content": "Normally, I\u2019d start this sort of article by saying something along the lines of, \u201cEveryone knows how horrible it is to feel motion sick.\u201d But that\u2019s not entirely true\u2014plenty of people can text, read, and do all sorts of things in a moving vehicle without feeling the slightest bit nauseous. If that sounds like you, you\u2019ll have to trust me\u2014a chronic sufferer of motion sickness\u2014when I say that it wholeheartedly sucks.\n\nPlus, many drugs used for motion sickness come with an unwanted side effect: drowsiness. While that\u2019s useful for a long-haul red-eye, it definitely kills the mood on a road trip. That\u2019s why researchers have looked into whether music can help people recover from carsickness, and they might be onto something.\n\n\u201cMotion sickness significantly impairs the travel experience for many individuals, and existing pharmacological interventions often carry side-effects such as drowsiness,\u201d Qizong Yue, a researcher at Southwest University in China, said in a statement. \u201cMusic represents a non-invasive, low-cost, and personalized intervention strategy.\u201d\n\nIn a study published today in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience, Yue and colleagues induced carsickness in study participants with a driving simulator (you couldn\u2019t pay me enough to get into that) and then played different types of music while monitoring them for potential recovery. According to their results, soft and joyful music best supported recovery. Perhaps surprisingly, even sad music was worse than doing nothing.\n\nThe team divided the 30 participants, who had reported moderate levels of previous carsickness, into six groups\u2014four who listened to music as they recovered from motion sickness, one who didn\u2019t, and one whose simulations stopped before the participant became carsick.\n\nEveryone wore electroencephalogram (EEG) caps\u2014tools that measure electrical activity in the brain. The researchers hoped to identify brain signals indicative of carsickness by comparing the neural activity of the first five groups with that of the sixth group\u2014the one for which the simulation stopped before participants could become nauseous (ok, maybe you could pay me to be in group six).\n\nThe researchers first measured each participant\u2019s EEG signals as they sat still in the simulator. The participants subsequently underwent a driving task and communicated their level of carsickness. At the end of the task, some participants listened to music for 60 seconds.\n\nThe team then asked them how carsick they still were. The participants reported that joyful music reduced carsickness by 57.3%, soft music reduced it by 56.7%, and passionate music by 48.3%. While those who didn\u2019t listen to music reported 43.3% fewer carsickness symptoms after the 60 seconds, participants who listened to sad music reported a reduction of just 40%.\n\nThe researchers suggest that soft music might relax tensions that worsen carsickness, and joyful music may provide a distraction by triggering brain reward systems. Sad music could aggravate negative feelings and, as a result, worsen a person\u2019s general discomfort.\n\nInterestingly, the EEG data revealed changes in participants\u2019 occipital lobe brain activity when they said they were carsick. Specifically, the device recorded less complex activity when participants reported feeling significantly nauseous. As they recovered, brain activity in this area gradually returned to normal levels.\n\n\u201cBased on our conclusions, individuals experiencing motion sickness symptoms during travel can listen to cheerful or gentle music to achieve relief,\u201d Yue explained. \u201cThe primary theoretical frameworks for motion sickness genesis apply broadly to sickness induced by various vehicles. Therefore, the findings of this study likely extend to motion sickness experienced during air or sea travel.\u201d\n\nHowever, \u201cthe primary limitation of this study is its relatively small sample size,\u201d the researcher added. \u201cThis constraint results in limited statistical power.\u201d What\u2019s more, one\u2019s brain might react differently to a simulation than real-life conditions. In other words, more research with larger samples is needed to confirm both the carsickness brain activity patterns and to continue investigating the impact of music on motion sickness.\n\nMoving forward, the team will study different types of motion sickness and the influence of music taste. And if any of the researchers are reading this article, I\u2019d like to suggest investigating the anecdotal evidence of how singing helps prevent and/or recover from motion sickness. It would finally prove to my family that I literally need to belt out the lyrics to all of Taylor Swift\u2019s songs when we hit those windy roads.",

      "text": "- Science News\n- Featured news\n- Happy music could help you recover from motion sickness\nHappy music could help you recover from motion sickness\nCould listening to the right music help you conquer carsickness? Scientists induced motion sickness in participants using a driving simulator, then played them different kinds of music while they tried to recover. Participants listening to joyful or soft music reported feeling better than participants listening to passionate music, while sad music resulted in a less effective recovery than not listening to any music. The scientists also found that participants\u2019 experience of motion sickness was reflected in electroencephalogram data, pointing to a potential future quantitative measure of motion sickness.\nScientists studying ways of improving motion sickness have found that playing different types of music may help people recover more effectively. Using a specially calibrated driving simulator, they induced car sickness in participants and then played different types of music while they tried to recover. Soft and joyful music produced the best recovery effects, while sad music was less effective than doing nothing at all.\n\u201cMotion sickness significantly impairs the travel experience for many individuals, and existing pharmacological interventions often carry side-effects such as drowsiness,\u201d explained Dr Qizong Yue of Southwest University, China, corresponding author of the article in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience. \u201cMusic represents a non-invasive, low-cost, and personalized intervention strategy.\u201d\nControlling carsickness\nFor those who get carsick, there\u2019s nothing worse \u2014 and feeling tense in anticipation of possible sickness can trigger a physical reaction, bringing sickness on more quickly. Because music can be used to alleviate tension, Yue and his team wondered if it could help people who get carsick.\nThe researchers started by developing a model to induce motion sickness. They recruited 40 participants to screen routes on a driving simulator and select the best route for making people feel carsick. They then screened a group of participants for their previous susceptibility to carsickness and selected 30 who reported moderate levels of past carsickness.\nThese participants wore electroencephalogram (EEG) caps, to try to identify quantifiable signals of carsickness in the brain\u2019s activity. They were divided into six groups \u2014 four that received a music intervention, one that received no music, and one whose simulators were stopped when they started to report that they might feel slightly carsick. The last group acted as a comparative sample for the EEG data. They\u2019d received the same stimuli as the other 25 participants, but weren\u2019t allowed to become nauseous, so the difference between their brain activity and the other participants\u2019 should help identify signals characteristic of carsickness.\nFirst, the participants sat still in the simulator for a few minutes to capture baseline EEG signals from their brains. Then they performed a driving task and reported their level of carsickness to the scientists. Once they stopped driving, the participants in the music groups were played music for 60 seconds, and then asked to report how sick they felt.\nRead and download original article\nAll in your head?\nThe scientists found that joyful music alleviated carsickness the most, reducing it by 57.3%, very closely followed by soft music, at 56.7%. Passionate music reduced motion sickness by 48.3%, while playing sad music turned out to be slightly less effective than doing nothing. The control group reported a reduction of carsickness symptoms by 43.3% after their rest, while those who listened to sad music reported a reduction of only 40%.\nThe EEG data, meanwhile, showed that participants\u2019 brain activity in the occipital lobe changed when they reported carsickness. The EEG measured less complex activity in this brain region when participants said they felt quite sick. The better recovering participants said they felt, the more the activity measured by the EEG returned to normal levels. It\u2019s possible that soft music relaxes people, relieving tension which exacerbates carsickness, while joyful music might distract people by activating brain reward systems. Sad music could have the opposite effect, by amplifying negative emotions and increasing overall discomfort.\nHowever, the scientists pointed out that further work is needed to confirm these results. \u201cThe primary limitation of this study is its relatively small sample size,\u201d explained Yue. \u201cThis constraint results in limited statistical power.\u201d\nMore research with larger samples will be needed to validate EEG patterns as a quantitative indicator of motion sickness, and to improve our understanding of the impact of music on motion sickness. The researchers also call for studies under real-life conditions, which could impact the brain differently compared to simulated roads. They plan to follow up these experiments with investigations of different forms of travel-sickness and the role played by personal musical taste.\n\u201cBased on our conclusions, individuals experiencing motion sickness symptoms during travel can listen to cheerful or gentle music to achieve relief,\u201d said Yue. \u201cThe primary theoretical frameworks for motion sickness genesis apply broadly to sickness induced by various vehicles. Therefore, the findings of this study likely extend to motion sickness experienced during air or sea travel.\u201d\nREPUBLISHING GUIDELINES: Open access and sharing research is part of Frontiers\u2019 mission.

      "text": "Overview\nEEG brain activity\nEEG brain activity\nAn EEG records the electrical activity of the brain through electrodes put on the scalp. EEG results show changes in brain activity. This may help diagnose brain conditions such as epilepsy and other seizure conditions.\nAn electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures electrical activity in the brain. This test also is called an EEG. The test uses small, metal discs called electrodes that attach to the scalp. Brain cells communicate via electrical impulses, and this activity shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording. Brain cells are active all the time, even during sleep.\nAn EEG is one of the main tests to help diagnose epilepsy. An EEG also can play a role in diagnosing other brain conditions.\nWhy it's done\nAn EEG can find changes in brain activity that might aid in diagnosing brain conditions, especially epilepsy or another seizure condition. An EEG also might be helpful for diagnosing or treating:\n- Brain tumors.\n- Brain damage from a head injury.\n- Brain disease that can have a variety of causes, known as encephalopathy.\n- Inflammation of the brain, such as herpes encephalitis.\n- Stroke.\n- Sleep conditions.\n- Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.\nAn EEG also might be used to confirm brain death in someone in a coma. A continuous EEG is used to help find the right level of anesthesia for someone in a medically induced coma.\nMore Information\nRisks\nEEGs are safe and painless. Sometimes seizures are intentionally triggered in people with epilepsy during the test, but appropriate medical care is provided if needed.\nHow you prepare\nTake your usual medicines unless your care team tells you not to take them.\nOther precautions\n- Wash your hair the night before or the day of the test, but don't use conditioners, hair creams, sprays or styling gels. Hair products can make it harder for the patches that hold the electrodes to stick to your scalp.\n- If you're having a sleep EEG, you may be asked to sleep less or not to sleep the night before your EEG.\n- If you might have a sedative before the EEG, plan to have someone drive you home after the test.\nWhat you can expect\nDuring the test\nEEG electrodes\nEEG electrodes\nDuring an EEG, flat metal discs called electrodes are attached to the scalp. In a high-density EEG, shown here, the electrodes are close together. The electrodes are connected to the EEG machine with wires. Some people wear an elastic cap fitted with electrodes instead of having the adhesive applied to their scalps.\nYou feel little or no discomfort during an EEG. The electrodes don't transmit any sensations. They just record your brain waves.\nHere are some things you can expect to happen during an EEG:\n- A technician measures your head and marks your scalp with a special pencil to indicate where to attach the electrodes. These spots on your scalp might be scrubbed with a gritty cream to improve the quality of the recording.\n-\nA technician attaches discs called electrodes to your scalp using an adhesive. Sometimes, an elastic cap fitted with electrodes is used instead. The electrodes are connected with wires to an instrument that amplifies the brain waves and records them on computer equipment.\nOnce the electrodes are in place, an EEG typically takes between 20 and 40 minutes. For certain conditions, you need to sleep during the test. Tests that require you to sleep can be longer.\n- You relax in a comfortable position with your eyes closed during the test. The technician might ask you to open and close your eyes or ask you to perform a few simple calculations. You may be asked to read a paragraph, look at a picture, breathe deeply or look at a flashing light.\n- Video is routinely recorded during the EEG. Your body motions are captured by a video camera while the EEG records your brain waves. This combined recording can help your healthcare professional diagnose and treat your condition.\nAn ambulatory EEG, also known as an aEEG, allows for longer monitoring outside an office or a hospital setting. But this type of EEG isn't always an option. This test can record brain activity over several days, which increases the chances of recording during seizure activity. However, compared with inpatient video EEG monitoring, an ambulatory EEG is not as good at determining the difference between epileptic seizures and nonepileptic seizures.\nAfter the test\nThe technician removes the electrodes or cap. If you didn't have a sedative, you typically feel no side effects after the procedure. You usually can return to your typical routine.\nIf you used a sedative, it takes time for the medicine to begin to wear off. Arrange to have someone drive you home. Once you're at home, rest and don't drive for the rest of the day.\nResults\nDoctors trained to analyze EEGs interpret the recording and send the results to the healthcare professional who ordered the EEG. You might need to schedule an office appointment to discuss the results of the test.\nIf possible, bring along a family member or friend to the appointment to help you remember the information you're given.\nWrite down questions to ask your healthcare professional, such as:\n- Based on the results, what are my next steps?\n- What follow-up, if any, do I need?\n- Are there factors that might have affected the results of this test in some way?\n- Will I need to repeat the test?\nClinical trials\nExplore Mayo Clinic studies of tests and procedures to help prevent, detect, treat or manage conditions.\nThe Mayo Clinic experience and patient stories\nOur patients tell us that the quality of their interactions, our attention to detail and the efficiency of their visits mean health care like they've never experienced. See the stories of satisfied Mayo Clinic patients.\nBack to basketball after seizure surgery\nStudy shows advanced imaging, expert review improve diagnosis of encephaloceles The sound of a basketball bouncing, the squeak of shoes on a fast break, the swish of the net \u2014 basketball has been a constant for Parker Shanks \u2014 from youth leagues to high school and college teams, to pickup games at his local gym.
