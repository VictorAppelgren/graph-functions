  "description": "",
  "content": "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act has stirred up plenty of conversation. Financial expert Suze Orman recently detailed some of its key benefits on her \"Women & Money\" podcast.\n\nWhile she acknowledges there are many parts of the bill she hates, she encourages her listeners to focus on the practical perks that can help you keep more of your money or save on taxes.\n\u2022 Would You Have Invested in eBay or Uber Early? The Same Backers Are Betting on This Vacation Home Platform\n\u2022 \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\n\nOne of the standout features of the bill is the expanded child tax credit, which Orman highlights as a vital lifeline for parents raising children under 17.\n\n\"Right now, the child tax credit gives you up to $2,200 per child,\" she explains. Even if you owe no taxes, up to $1,700 of that amount is refundable \u2014 meaning if your tax bill is zero, the IRS will still send you a check for that portion, rather than just reducing what you owe.\n\nThe credit phases out for higher earners \u2014 starting at $200,000 modified adjusted gross income for singles and $400,000 for married couples filing jointly. Importantly, the child must be a U.S. citizen living with you for more than half the year.\n\n\"Do not leave money on the table,\" Orman advises, encouraging parents to claim this benefit if eligible.\n\nTrending: Named a TIME Best Invention and Backed by 5,000+ Users, Kara's Air-to-Water Pod Cuts Plastic and Costs \u2014 And You Can Invest At Just $6.37/Share\n\nUp to $10,000 Deductible on Personal Car Loans\n\nAnother notable perk is the new deduction for interest on personal auto loans. \"You can now deduct up to $10,000 per year in interest on a personal auto loan as long as \u2013 there's always a catch, isn't there \u2014 the car is assembled in the United States,\" Suze notes.\n\nThis deduction applies only if the loan is in your name and the vehicle isn't leased or used for business purposes.\n\nThis benefit is good through 2028, giving car buyers a significant tax break if they finance a qualifying vehicle. Orman cautions, \"Just ask, does this car qualify or not,\" to make sure you're taking advantage of this opportunity.\n\nSee Also: Jeff Bezos-Backed Arrived Homes Hits A Big Sale On Charlotte Property \u2013 Investors Earning A 34.7% Return\n\nTax-Free Tips: Up to $25,000 Exempt From Federal Income Tax\n\nFor workers relying on tips, such as servers or hairdressers, the bill offers a new exemption on tip income. Up to $25,000 in tips can now be excluded from federal income taxes annually. Orman calls this \"one of the biggest tax breaks you're gonna ever see,\" but stresses the importance of accurate record-keeping.\n\n\"This really is a gift,\" Orman says, but reminds tip earners to track their tips, report everything honestly, and file taxes carefully. This exemption phases out for singles earning more than $150,000 and married couples filing jointly above $300,000.\n\nNote that this only applies to federal income tax; some states are considering similar exemptions, while others still tax tip income.\n\nWhat This Means for You\n\nOrman isn't the first to say she dislikes this new legislation, but if it's happening, she says you might as well take advantage of it. \"You first have to be able to take advantage of the things that you can take advantage of and not waste money,\" she says.\n\nThe bill's various benefits mostly expire in 2028, coinciding with a new presidential term, but until then, Orman says there are several smart moves taxpayers can make to boost their bottom line.\n\nRead Next: Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years \u2014 This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It",

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nThree of the same VC firms that backed Uber, Venmo, and eBay, respectively, are all investing in another private company: Pacaso.\nVenture backing in companies like Pacaso is nothing new. After all, early-stage companies often have the potential to deliver the most outsized returns.\nBut, recent regulatory updates have opened the door for individual investors to invest alongside these venture capitalists. Normally, everyday investors have to wait for a company to go public before they can invest, missing out on that early gain potential. Now, some companies are opening up investment opportunities to the public.\nThis type of investing has already seen some great success stories. For example, in 2016, 433 people invested an average of $2,730 in a private startup named Revolut. Fast-forward to today, those $2,730 stakes are worth over $1 million, up 89,900%.\nToday, thousands of investors have joined big-name VCs in taking a chance on Pacaso. It's no surprise, considering Pacaso's resum\u00e9:\n- The company has made $110M in gross profits to date\n- Pacaso's co-founder sold his last company to Zillow for $120M\n- They operate in over 40 vacation destinations across the US, Mexico, UK, and France\n- The company reserved the Nasdaq ticker PCSO\nBut the growth potential is where the excitement is. Below we'll reveal more about how Pacaso has ramped up and built a competitive moat so quickly, and how you can share in their growth.\nNext-Generation Co-Ownership\nAfter his $120M exit and subsequent role as a Zillow executive, Austin Allison created Pacaso\u2019s game-changing co-ownership model. Powered by proprietary tech and an innovative structure that eliminates the headaches of traditional vacation home ownership, it\u2019s already leaving a mark. Here\u2019s how:\n- Seamless Transactions: Clients easily buy, finance, and resell, shares of luxury homes through Pacaso\u2019s intuitive platform\n- Turnkey Ownership: Pacaso handles maintenance, scheduling, and furnishing; owners simply enjoy their vacation homes\n- Maximized Value: Homes that once sat empty up to 90% of the year now stay occupied nearly year-round, benefiting owners and local economies\nThe demand for their services and expertise is real. In top destinations, co-ownership is growing 21% annually in the US, and Pacaso homes have appreciated nearly 10% since 2021 \u2013 roughly double the growth of the broader luxury market.\nScaling Into 10 New International Destinations\nPacaso is already leading the charge in the $1.3 trillion US vacation home market, combining real estate innovation with tech-driven efficiency to generate multiple revenue streams. These include transaction service fees on every sale, recurring property management fees, and exclusive financing options tailored to co-owners.\nNow, the platform\u2019s global reach is growing quickly, and they\u2019re already seeing strong returns in the $500B global market. In 2024, they set records in Paris and London. Meanwhile, Cabo (Mexico) is the #3-most-searched destination on their platform. No surprise Europe and Mexico have accounted for 22% of their revenue over the past two years.\nNow, they\u2019re taking international expansion to an entirely new level. They recently announced 10 new international destinations will be added to their platform, spread across Italy, the Caribbean, and Mexico. That means Pacaso\u2019s unique model is poised to dominate a combined $1.8T in vacation home markets.\nWhy Investors Are Paying Attention\nThere are many reasons why firms managing a combined $180B+ in assets, and 10,000+ individual investors have already backed Pacaso, including:\n- Proven Leadership: Allison is joined by executives with decades of real-estate and startup experience.\n- Strong Growth Metrics: Full-year 2024 financials showed a 21% YoY increase in gross real estate volume and a 24% improvement in adjusted EBITDA.\n- Surging Demand: 40% of Americans want to buy a vacation home in the next year (Coldwell Banker)\nAfter impressive full-year earnings showed gross profit grew 41%, and with continued growth and expansion ahead, Pacaso is really hitting their stride.\nPacaso is offering securities through the use of an Offering Statement that has been qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Tier II of Regulation A. A copy of the Final Offering Circular that forms a part of the Offering Statement may be obtained from: invest.pacaso.com. Reserving the ticker symbol is not a guarantee that the company will go public. Listing on the Nasdaq is subject to approvals.\nDon\u2019t Miss Your Chance to Become an Early Investor in Pacaso:\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

      "text": "Not earning a paycheck doesn't mean you have to miss out on building your own retirement savings. In a recent blog post, personal finance expert Suze Orman points to a little-known strategy \u2014 the spousal IRA \u2014 as a powerful way for stay-at-home partners and caregivers to grow wealth for the future.\nToday's Best Finance Deals\nWhat Is a Spousal IRA?\nA spousal IRA isn't a special account type \u2014 it's a way for a working spouse to contribute to an individual retirement account in the name of a non-working or low-earning spouse. Normally, you need earned income to put money into an IRA. The spousal IRA rule makes an exception, allowing the couple to use the working spouse's income to fund both partners' accounts.\nDon't Miss:\n- The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market \u2014 and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n- \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\n\"You must be married and file a joint federal tax return,\" Orman explains. \"That joint tax return must show earned income from earnings of the other spouse.\"\nEach IRA is held in one person's name \u2014 there are no joint IRAs \u2014 but both can benefit from the combined savings in retirement.\nHow It Works\nTo qualify for a spousal IRA, you must:\n- Be married and file a joint federal tax return.\n- Have earned income from the working spouse that equals or exceeds the total contributions made to both IRAs.\nIn 2025, contribution limits are:\n- $7,000 per person under age 50.\n- $8,000 per person age 50 or older; this includes the $1,000 \"catch-up\" contribution.\nIf your joint modified adjusted gross income is under $236,000 in 2025, you can contribute the full amount to a Roth IRA. Above that, contribution limits begin to phase out.\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\nRoth IRA Advantages\nOrman is a strong advocate for using a Roth IRA when eligible. With a Roth:\n- Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so you won't get a tax deduction now \u2014 but withdrawals in retirement are tax-free, as long as the account is at least five years old and you're 59\u00bd or older.\n- You can withdraw the contributions \u2014 but not earnings \u2014 at any time, tax- and penalty-free, which can offer emergency flexibility.\n- Roth IRAs don't have required minimum distributions, giving you more control over when to use your savings.\n\"I hope you won't touch the money you contribute to a Roth IRA until you are retired,\" Orman says. \"But I also want you to understand the rules, because in a bona fide emergency, the ability to use contributions to a Roth IRA without tax or penalty can be a valuable option.\"\nThe Long-Term Payoff\nOrman notes that a stay-at-home spouse who invests $8,000 annually for 10 years, with a 7% annualized return, could see the account grow to more than $230,000 in 20 years \u2014 all potentially tax-free with a Roth.\n\"A spousal IRA is a fantastic way for a caregiver (kids, elderly parents) not currently in the workforce to help build household retirement security,\" she writes.\nSee Also: Have $100k+ to invest? Charlie Munger says that's the toughest milestone \u2014 don't stall now. Get matched with a fiduciary advisor and keep building\nGetting Started\nOpening a spousal IRA is similar to setting up any other IRA. You choose between a traditional IRA, with upfront tax deductions for some households, or a Roth IRA, with tax-free withdrawals later, and then pick a bank, brokerage, or credit union to hold the account.\nFrom there, you'll decide how to invest the funds \u2014 such as in mutual funds, ETFs, or individual stocks \u2014 based on your goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.\nWhy It Matters\nFor many couples, one partner steps out of the workforce to raise children, care for aging relatives, or manage the household. Without earned income, that spouse may miss out on years \u2014 or even decades \u2014 of retirement contributions. A spousal IRA helps close that gap, ensuring both partners build their own nest egg for the future.\nRead Next: In a $34 Trillion Debt Era, The Right AI Could Be Your Financial Advantage \u2014 Get Your Demo\nImage: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nFirst-time real estate investors can face several hurdles when trying to get started: high upfront costs, dealing with tenants and maintenance, finding and closing on a suitable property, and the fear that your initial investment won\u2019t see a return, just to name a few.\nNow, there\u2019s a company that handles all the grunt work and provides a money-back guarantee on your initial investment.\nIntroducing mogul, the simplest way to own income-producing blue chip real estate.\nFounded by former Goldman Sachs executives who have closed more than $10 billion in deals, they handle the sourcing, underwriting, and day-to-day management of every property.\nTo remove first-time jitters, mogul gives new investors their First-$10k Protection Guarantee: If your initial investment of up to $10,000 loses value in the first year, mogul refunds every lost dollar.\nInvestors in mogul portfolios have earned an average annualized return of 18.8%, paid out as monthly rental income plus appreciation.\nStart building a diversified property portfolio in minutes while mogul absorbs the downside.\n\u2018If we ever brag about a 4% IRR, I will quit\u2019\nAlex Blackwood and Joey Gumataotao, mogul\u2019s co-founders, routinely surpassed 15-20% annual returns when closing deals at Goldman Sachs. When they looked at other real estate investment platforms at the time, they found those companies would often brag to those investors about 4% annual returns on billions of dollars.\nAs Alex says on mogul\u2019s website, \u201cIf we ever brag about a 4% IRR, I will quit immediately.\u201d\nTo date, properties in mogul\u2019s portfolio have generated an average 10-12% annual cash-on-cash yield that hit users\u2019 accounts as rent dividends each month. When long-term appreciation is included, historical performance rises to an 18.8% annualized returns, giving investors both regular income and capital growth\nPart of their success is due to the fact that mogul mogul approves fewer than one percent of properties reviewed. Each candidate asset must clear a 12% bear case hurdle rate before moving to the next level of diligence.\nYou can browse eligible properties on mogul\u2019s website and buy part or all of a house in under 30 seconds, or use the same data and tools available to top real estate firms to underwrite any property across the U.S.\nRent collections are aggregated and distributed to investors every month. At the same time, independent third-party valuations refresh inside your dashboard, letting you watch equity climb in real time while still enjoying depreciation and other pass-through tax advantages unique to real estate.\nMore than $1.2 million was invested on mogul last month.\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nCollect passive income from real estate without taking on the headaches of being a landlord. You can buy shares of rental properties with as little as $100 thanks to this investment platform backed by Jeff Bezos.\nIn a major success for real estate investors, The Centennial, a single-family home near Charlotte, NC, delivered a total return of 34.7% \u2013 or 11.2% annually \u2013 following its sale in August 2024. This impressive outcome highlights Arrived's expertise in leveraging market opportunities, strategic management and dividend-driven passive income.\nArrived's Q3 2024 report underscores the broader success of its investment strategy. During the quarter, investors earned over $1.54 million in dividend income, marking a 25% increase from Q2 2024. Across 354 individual properties, single-family residential investments averaged 3.7% annualized dividends, while vacation rentals provided an average return of 2.8%. These consistent results demonstrate the platform's ability to balance income and appreciation across its portfolio.\nLIMITED TIME FOR JUST $100\nThe Byers House\nOwn a piece of the Byers House, a vacation rental located at the iconic home of Joyce, Jonathan, and Will Byers, featured in Stranger Things and located in Fayetteville, GA, just 20 minutes from Hartsfield Jackson International Airport. This property was used to film the exterior scenes in the actual show and influenced the design for the interior sets, which were filmed in a nearby studio.\nFrom its October 2021 IPO through its sale in 2024, The Centennial maintained 100% occupancy. Before the IPO, Arrived secured a two-year lease, ensuring immediate income for investors. Subsequent rent increases, such as a 9% boost in the second year, further bolstered returns.\nArrived's professional management team also ensured a seamless experience for investors by handling all property upkeep and tenant needs. Repairs, like a washing machine leak in May 2022, were swiftly resolved, maintaining the property's value and tenant satisfaction. Over its holding period, The Centennial generated 14.5% in dividend returns (4.7% annually), providing steady income alongside appreciation.\nArrived's decision to sell The Centennial after under three years demonstrates the company's knack for strategic timing. While typical hold periods range from five to seven years, Arrived capitalized on strong market conditions to secure a sale price of $351,000, resulting in 20.2% appreciation (6.5% annually). Negotiation tactics, including counteroffers and inspection adjustments, ensured maximum value.\nThe Future of Fractional Real Estate\nThe success of The Centennial reflects the strength of Arrived's investment approach: selecting high-growth markets, delivering consistent dividend income and strategically timing sales to maximize returns. As Q3 results show, this model is replicable across diverse asset classes.\nWith over $1.54 million paid in dividends this past quarter, Arrived allows individuals to invest in shares of rental properties for as little as $100, providing the potential for monthly rental income and long-term appreciation without the hassles of being a landlord. With over $1 million in dividends paid out last quarter and a growing selection of properties across various markets, Arrived offers an attractive alternative for investors seeking to build a diversified real estate portfolio.\nLooking for fractional real estate investment opportunities?

      "text": "Retirement, ideally a period of relaxation and enjoyment after years of hard work, is often envisioned as a time to pursue hobbies, travel or simply unwind. But without a solid financial plan, many Americans worry they\u2019ll outlive their money. This fear is often more acute among married couples, who face the added complexity of planning for two people with varying financial needs.\nIf you're 50 or older and have over $100,000 in investable assets, now is the time to take retirement planning seriously.

The disparity in average household retirement savings by age group further illustrates this issue:\n- Under 35: $49,130 (median: $18,880)\n- Ages 35 to 44: $141,520 (median: $45,000)\n- Ages 45 to 54: $313,220 (median: $115,000)\n- Ages 55 to 64: $537,560 (median: $185,000)\n- Ages 65 to 74: $609,230 (median: $200,000)\nThese figures show a significant gap between average and median savings, pointing to a broad spectrum of financial preparedness across different age groups. Those nearing retirement, especially those with $250,000 or more in retirement savings, stand to benefit most from expert, fiduciary guidance.\nTo guide couples in their retirement planning, T. Rowe Price, a reputable global investment management firm, provides savings benchmarks as multiples of income, varying by household income and marital status.\nFor example, a dual-income married couple with an annual income of $75,000 at age 55 should have retirement savings equal to five times their income, which should increase to 8.5 times by age 65. These benchmarks scale up for higher-income brackets, and for those with $250,000 or more in assets, strategic investment planning becomes especially important.\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\nIf you\u2019ve worked hard to build a nest egg of $100,000 or more, WiserAdvisor can connect you with a trusted, independent fiduciary advisor who understands the unique financial needs of pre-retirees and retirees.\nFiduciary advisors are legally required to put your interests first.

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nYou see a shocking number of ads daily \u2013 researchers estimate between 6,000 and 10,000 and 375 to 625 per waking hour. In the modern age, most of them come from social media apps whose entire business model revolves around constantly showing you ads and keeping 100% of the revenue. But what if users got a share? That company might just grow its revenue by 32,481% in three years, help users earn and save $325 million and be named Deloitte's fastest-growing software company in North America. That\u2019s what Mode Mobile did. You can still get in for just $0.30 per share.\nReaching Financial Stability One Tap at a Time\nMost Americans can\u2019t afford a $1,000 emergency bill. That means many are one car breakdown or ER visit away from serious financial trouble. There's no quick fix to such a big financial challenge that over 50% of Americans face. However, it's safe to bet that the masses will flock to any good solutions. Mode Mobile created one such solution years ago by allowing people to earn money doing what they already spend a third of their waking hours on \u2013 tapping, scrolling and looking at their smartphone screens.\nMode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. However, users can earn income on their existing devices as well. This extreme competitiveness has allowed Mode Mobile to attract over 50 million registered beta users. Launching the finalized version could bring in millions more, helping the company reach its goal of $150 million in annual revenue within three years.\n6,955,000,000 Users to Go\nCurrently, seven billion smartphones worldwide provide functionality or entertainment but take all the profits. Mode Mobile\u2019s disruption offers the same benefits but allows users to earn money at a time when the prices of goods are skyrocketing. Just like Airbnb lets users earn extra cash by renting out their bedrooms and Uber allows users to make money on their rides back home from work, Mode Mobile wants to enable its users to make money from their phones. However, its total addressable market is much larger than Airbnb\u2019s and Uber\u2019s \u2013 currently at over $1 trillion.\nYou can invest in Mode Mobile at $0.30 per share with a minimum investment of $4,950. Plus, the company is offering the chance to earn up to 120% in bonus shares, if you invest more. All funding rounds open to non-accredited investors, including Mode Mobile\u2019s, are limited in time. So, if you\u2019d like to be part of the future it's building, consider acting soon.\nDisclaimer:\nAN OFFERING STATEMENT REGARDING THIS OFFERING HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE SEC.

      "text": "- Mortgage refinancing is suddenly easier to get, with rejection rates dropping to their lowest level in years.\n- The latest New York Fed data shows U.S. consumers are having more success applying for auto loans and mortgage refis.\n- Get the latest proven ETF strategies to target and profit from summer volatility before the next big market swing.\nAfter more than a year of tight lending and high borrowing costs, there are some early signs that access to credit might be loosening. For investors watching consumer resilience, this could offer a small but notable shift in the broader economic picture. Mortgage refinancing, in particular, saw a big move last month, giving potential borrowers a reason to reengage.\nRejection rates dropped to 15% in June, down from 42% in February. That February figure was the highest on record going back to 2013. Auto loan rejections were also down, falling to 7% in June from 14% earlier in the year.\nA Look at Consumer Expectations\nThe data comes from the Fed's Survey of Consumer Expectations, which tracks how households feel about credit access, inflation, and their financial outlook. Fewer people reported holding back from applying for credit because they expected to be turned down. That share, often referred to as discouraged borrowers, dropped from 8.5% in February to 7.2% in June.\nAt the same time, people said they'd be more likely to face a surprise $2,000 expense, but also felt more capable of covering it. Overall debt burdens remain a concern in other parts of the Fed's data, but consumer financial conditions still look relatively stable, especially given the impact of elevated interest rates.\nWhile it\u2019s too soon to call this a trend, the June survey offers a snapshot of slightly easier credit conditions that investors watching household spending may want to track.\nHow this plays out over the next few months will depend on a mix of consumer behavior, lender confidence, and broader economic signals. Credit conditions often shift gradually, and even small changes can influence how people spend, save, or borrow. For now, the latest data suggests a subtle shift worth monitoring.\nRead Next:\nPhoto: Shutterstock\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice. All rights reserved."

  "argos_summary": "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act has generated discussion, particularly regarding its financial benefits highlighted by expert Suze Orman on her podcast. Key features include an expanded child tax credit of up to $2,200 per child, a new deduction for personal auto loan interest up to $10,000, and a tax exemption for up to $25,000 in tip income for workers. Orman encourages taxpayers to take advantage of these benefits before they expire in 2028, despite her criticisms of the bill.",
