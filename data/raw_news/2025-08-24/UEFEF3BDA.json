  "content": "But the summer months are also the peak season for bike thefts in Boston.\n\nSummer is for watching free concerts at the Hatch Shell, kayaking on the Charles River, and traveling to Cape Cod.\n\nThefts have hit high levels between July and September every year since 2016, based on crime incident data from the Boston Police Department. More Bostonians are biking as the state and city have invested in bike lanes in major transit areas including the Mass. Ave Bridge and on South Huntington Avenue in Jamaica Plain in recent years.\n\nReno Sarge, 29, knows the high cost of bike theft well.\n\nHis Himiway D3 Cruiser, which cost around $1,000, was stolen in Back Bay this Juneteenth. Sarge was enjoying his day off and stopped by his office at the John Hancock Tower to pick up something. He usually parked in a garage but decided to lock the bike at a rack at 140 Clarendon Street with a cable lock because he knew he wouldn\u2019t be in the office long.\n\n\u201cThat was a big mistake,\u201d Sarge said, \u201cWhen I got back, it was gone.\u201d\n\nLast year, there were 628 reported bike thefts in Boston, according to police data. This number is in line with the number of bike thefts annually in the city, save for 2020, when the number of stolen bikes reached 1,006.\n\nThe number of bikes reported stolen totaled 57 this July, 59 in July 2024, and 68 in July 2023.\n\nBike thefts aren\u2019t just a problem in Boston. Last year, Cambridge reported 500 thefts and Somerville reported 160, according to police data from the two cities.\n\nMost of the Boston bike thefts occurred in Back Bay, downtown Boston, Dorchester, Fenway, Jamaica Plain, and the South End, according to a Globe analysis of Boston Police Department reports from January 2023 to July 2025. According to the department, location data in the reports can sometimes correspond to the police station where the victim reported the theft, even if it occurred in another neighborhood.\n\nA review of the Boston Police Department\u2019s crime incident reports since 2015 revealed which intersections were the biggest targets for bike thieves over the last decade \u2014 and the worst places to park your bike. The top spot for bike thefts was an intersection between the Downtown Crossing and Park Street MBTA stations, where 67 bikes were stolen within a 160-foot radius. A collection of intersections in Back Bay, such as one near the Boston Public Library and in Fenway, were also among the top ten spots for theft.\n\nWorth Smith, who runs NEMO, a service similar to AAA for bike repairs, thinks bike theft is underreported.\n\nBefore NEMO, Smith worked at the electric scooter company Superpedestrian and was planning to start a business selling bike insurance with a GPS tracker to help people recover their bikes when they were stolen. He conducted 25 interviews with people whose bikes had been stolen and found that most victims felt dejected about being able to recover their bikes.\n\n\u201cA lot of people wouldn\u2019t even report theft to the police because they feel hopeless about it,\u201d Smith said.\n\nMost people also underestimated the risk of theft until it happened to them. Smith said that the people he interviewed also didn\u2019t report theft because they were reluctant to tell people that they had used cheap locks.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of victim-blaming when it comes to bike theft,\u201d Smith said, \u201cand most people aren\u2019t willing to pay for bike insurance or better locks until their bike gets stolen.\u201d\n\nSergeant Robert \u201cBob\u201d Reardon Jr. of the Cambridge Police Department urged people to report their stolen bikes.\n\n\u201cPictures, serial numbers or anything that can help differentiate your bike from others can help us do our jobs,\u201d Reardon said. \u201cWe really want the public to report and help us make a record of these thefts.\u201d\n\nFree, public bike registries such as Bike Index allow bicycle and e-scooter owners to register their vehicle\u2019s serial number along with photos and contact information in case of theft. Before buying a used bike, you can check if it\u2019s been reported stolen by looking up the serial number on Bike Index and other online registries. City-run registries such as Somerville\u2019s WRAP antitheft program are also used by police to more easily identify a bike and return it to its owner.\n\nSarge, the bike rider whose bike was stolen on Juneteenth, reported the theft to the police that night. He heard from the police a week and a half later. They said they looked at the building\u2019s security footage, but he hasn\u2019t heard anything since.\n\n\u201cBike theft is kind of low priority for them,\u201d Sarge said.\n\nLily Cowper can be reached at lily.cowper@globe.com.

      "text": "Extra News Alerts\nGet breaking updates as they happen.\nNot long ago, riding a bike down a stretch of South Huntington Avenue in Jamaica Plain was only for the brave. Navigating the sliver of pavement between cars whizzing by on their left and drivers opening their doors on their right, bikers did their best to avoid getting run over or \u201cdoored.\u201d\nNow, riders can cruise next to the curb on the right side, protected by a row of parked cars from the hazards of the narrowed lane left for drivers.\nThis stretch of road from Centre Street to Heath Street has recently joined a growing number of miles of Boston streets with bike lanes meant to protect bicyclists, slow down drivers, reduce the risk of crashes, and ultimately get more people to feel comfortable biking. The theory \u2014 bolstered by studies and experiences from similar cities \u2014 is that if there is a safe path for biking, more people will take it, in turn reducing climate change-causing emissions, traffic deaths, and mind-numbing congestion.\nThere\u2019s reason to believe it\u2019s starting to work in Boston, with the city aiming to expand the bike lane network so that half of residents live within a 3-minute walk of a safe and connected bike route by the end of next year.\nThe city monitors how many people are biking by counting the number of bikes and cars at dozens of locations over a few days four times per year. The Globe analyzed the most recent data available from the fall counts at three of those locations where the city or state has added bike lanes. On the Boston side of the Mass Ave. bridge, where the state added bike lanes in 2021, the city has tallied a significant increase in the daily average number of bikes in the fall.\nAt two areas where the city has more recently added bike lanes, the average daily counts for the fall slightly increased.\nBikers interviewed by the Globe said new bike lanes across the city have made them feel safer and even allowed some to opt for biking instead of driving to work, day care, the grocery store, and to run other errands or visit friends.\nBut, challenges remain. Many projects face vocal opposition to ceding valuable street real estate to bikes. And other issues, such as the prevalence of large trucks, and lingering gaps in the bike network, make biking more dangerous than most would like. Take South Huntington Avenue \u2014 the safe 0.7 mile stretch gives way on either end to busy, car-filled streets where bikes are forced back into traffic.\nWhen Srikanth Sundaresan moved from California about two years ago, he immediately started traveling by bike around Greater Boston. But it wasn\u2019t until about a year ago, once he was familiar with the bike lanes, that he decided to use his bike to take his 2-year-old to day care on his way to work.\nNow, Sundaresan, 41, straps his son into the seat above his back wheel and pedals down Boylston Street in Jamaica Plain from his home in Egleston Square to the Emerald Necklace. From there, it\u2019s a patchwork of riding in the street with car traffic and on bike lanes to his son\u2019s day care in Brookline, onward to his office in Kendall Square, then back to day care and home in the evening.\nThe new lanes, especially one on Boylston, he said, \u201cmake a huge difference.\u201d\n\u201cYou can stop thinking about the traffic,\u201d he said. \u201cI can actually enjoy the ride.\u201d\nThere is an area of his commute, however, that is under construction near Kenmore, forcing him to share a lane with large trucks.\n\u201cThat section I don\u2019t do with my child,\u201d he said. \u201cIf that section was before my drop off or after my pick up, I wouldn\u2019t do this. It feels super unsafe.\u201d\nNearby, in West Roxbury, Rich Esposto, 34, began to make the one-mile trek between his home and his 3-year-old\u2019s day care by bike about one year ago. The main draw: convenience.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to put her in the bike trailer than it is driving,\u201d he said. \u201cWe still do it by car predominantly, but we do it by bike when we can. We\u2019re conscious of trying to reduce those trips when it\u2019s such a short distance.\u201d\nThe new bike lanes on Centre Street, installed by the city last year, make the day care trips feel \u201cmuch safer,\u201d Esposto said.\nInfrequent and slow MBTA service is what nudged Holly Eisenberg, 26, to begin traveling almost exclusively by bike about one and a half years ago. She commutes from her home in Back Bay to her office downtown, some of the way through newly-added bike lanes, and uses her bike to visit friends around Greater Boston.\n\u201cYou can get from point A to point B in max 40 minutes; that\u2019s a great feature of Boston,\u201d she said. \u201cThe traffic here is horrible, doing whatever you can do to avoid it helps everyone.\u201d\nCars and delivery scooters are Eisenberg\u2019s top concern. A driver opened a door into her on a street in Roxbury that did not have bike lanes in 2021, sending her flying. She said she would like to see more traffic lights with signals for bikes and protected turns for bike riders, among other improvements.\n\u201cI was lucky, I had a metal basket in the front of my bike that almost acted like an airbag. It got smushed,\u201d she said.\nAt the three locations with new bike lanes analyzed by the Globe, the results show varying degrees of progress.\nSince MassDOT installed bike lanes on the Mass Ave. bridge in 2021, the average number of bikes counted by the city on the Boston side over a few days in the fall has increased each year. Last year, the city counted a daily average of 6,160 bikes there, a 51 percent increase since 2021.\nOn South Huntington Avenue in Jamaica Plain, where the city added bike lanes in 2023, the average number of daily bikes counted in the fall increased slightly from the previous year, from 228 to 301. This is still below the record high reached for this location in 2017, when the average number of daily bikes counted in the fall was 369.\nOn Cambridge Street in Allston, where the city added bike lanes between Harvard Avenue and Soldiers Field Road in summer 2022, the average number of bikes counted that fall increased by 12 percent to 414, then dipped slightly the following year.\nAnother telling metric on Boston\u2019s bike culture: The number of trips on Bluebikes, Greater Boston\u2019s bike share system, has steadily increased since it started in 2011, with a spike in 2022 to nearly 3.8 million trips, largely attributed to the Orange Line shutdown.\nSundaresan, Esposto, and Eisenberg were all experienced bikers before they started doing day care shuttling and commuting by bike. It\u2019s going to take a lot more bike lanes to get those still on the sidelines to join them, said Vivian Ortiz, a transportation advocate in Mattapan who is Boston\u2019s first bicycle \u201cmayor\u201d, a cycling ambassador of sorts named by the Amsterdam-based biking advocacy group BYCS.\n\u201cPeople say they want to ride to work, but they don\u2019t want to ride on the street,\u201d she said.\nOrtiz, 61, knows firsthand what a difference a protected lane can make. When the city installed temporary bike lanes on Cummins Highway in Mattapan, one of the most crash-prone streets in the city, in 2020, Ortiz said, she cried with happiness when she tried them out.\n\u201cThat was the first time I had ever ridden on Cummins Highway and felt safe,\u201d she said.\nConnectivity is top of mind for Boston\u2019s chief of streets, Jascha Franklin-Hodge, who uses an electric bike to transport his kids. Building a connected bicycle network will take time, he said, but the progress is encouraging.\n\u201cWhen I look at a map, and I see these gaps . . . I see future projects, I see the puzzle pieces that we are stitching together year by year,\u201d he said.\nThe enthusiasm for biking is there, nationwide and in Boston, according to a report last year from StreetLight Data, a transportation analytics company. StreetLight found that the average daily number of bike trips per 1,000 people in the Boston metro area grew from 26 in 2019 to 35 in 2022.\nThe way to keep up the momentum: more bike lanes. Last year, the city said it built around nine miles of these lanes, on par with its goal. More are planned for construction this year and next, including in Allston-Brighton, Back Bay, Downtown, Jamaica Plain, Kenmore, and Mattapan, the city said, with more on the way, including extending the South Huntington Avenue lanes.\n\u201cAll these projects are to slow down drivers and get some of these folks to realize that you can do some of these trips on a bus, walking, or on a bike,\u201d said Ortiz, the bike mayor. \u201cIt\u2019s getting people to think differently. That\u2019s very hard to do.\u201d\nGet breaking updates as they happen.\nStay up to date with everything Boston.

  "argos_summary": "Boston sees a surge in bike thefts during the summer, with July\u2013September consistently recording the highest numbers since 2016, and many thefts occurring in Back Bay, downtown, and other popular neighborhoods. Despite the rise in bike infrastructure, theft remains underreported, with victims often reluctant to file police reports due to hopelessness or victim\u2011blaming, though services like Bike Index and city registries aim to aid recovery. The city\u2019s expansion of protected bike lanes\u2014such as on the Mass Ave Bridge, South Huntington Avenue, and Allston\u2019s Cambridge Street\u2014has increased daily bike counts and encouraged more residents to commute by bike, yet challenges like truck traffic and incomplete connectivity persist. Overall, Boston\u2019s growing bike culture is buoyed by new lanes and data\u2011driven monitoring, but theft prevention and infrastructure gaps still need attention.",
