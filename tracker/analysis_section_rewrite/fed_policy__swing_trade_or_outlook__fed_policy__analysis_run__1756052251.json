      "feedback": "The draft fails the SECTION FOCUS in two critical ways: it presents 5 mover lines (3 Up/2 Down) instead of exactly 4 (2 Up, 2 Down), and it blends a swing-trade line into the mover block rather than keeping a separate, concise Swing Trade/Outlook Plan as required. To upgrade to world-class: 1) reduce movers to 4 lines with 2 Up and 2 Down, using strict structure: Up | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability % (anchored to evidence and cited with IDs). Choose 0–3 weeks and 3–6 months so the horizon is clearly split between near-term catalysts and medium-term regime dynamics; phrase drivers in first-principles terms and tie each to a single, coherent regime thread (Regime 1 hawkish/inflation-hot, Regime 2 disinflation easing, Regime 3 growth-constrained). 2) for each line, replace generic phrasing with explicit catalysts and invalidation triggers (e.g., “inflation prints vs target, wage momentum, or policy guidance” as triggers, and a concrete invalidation like “two consecutive inflation prints above target” or “policy path materially tightening”). 3) ensure all probabilistic statements are sourced and bounded by the material (attach IDs to asserted facts/numbers; resolve any conflicting signals by selecting a single, most-warranted reading per horizon and cite it). 4) separate the Swing Trade/Outlook Plan from the movers into its own 1-line plan (since ACMR is tradable, provide a single Swing Trade line with Direction | Horizon | Entry | Stop | Target | R/R | Invalidation | Trigger | Probability % | Confidence %), and keep it strictly actionable with explicitly derived triggers (e.g., ACMR’s N2 tool ramp or WFE demand signal) and a defined exit/invalidations. 5) audit coverage of sources so every critical pillar (policy regime, inflation/wage dynamics, Chips Act/Intel, auto cycle via Ford, and semis/WFE) is represented across the mover lines and the plan, reconcile conflicts by selecting the most robust interpretation for each horizon, and prune any extraneous lines or IDs that don’t map to the four-macthing movers. After restructuring, present four concise mover lines (2 Up, 2 Down) and a single Swing Trade plan line, with clean, traceable citations only where facts are asserted.",
