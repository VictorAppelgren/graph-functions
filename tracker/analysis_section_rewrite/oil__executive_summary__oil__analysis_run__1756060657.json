      "feedback": "The draft is data-rich and well anchored, but to reach world-class you should compress it into a 4–6 sentence/point executive brief and tighten the causal chain from macro balance to equity implications; replace the sprawling, horizon-spanning prose with a formal Regime A/B/C framework anchored to explicit numbers and probability weights, and attach a crisp set of catalysts and invalidation triggers. Actionable edits: (1) deliver a single base-house view with explicit price paths and ranges under each regime (e.g., Regime A: supply-led overhang with 2025 supply +2.5 mbpd, 2026 +1.9, demand 0.68–0.70 mbpd, refinery runs 85.6 in 2025 and 83.6–84.0 in 2025–26, Brent mid-60s, WTI low-60s); Regime B: reaccelerating/stagnant demand with firming or drift higher if runs stay near capacity; Regime C: sanctions-driven tightness with risk premia and spikes; assign coarse probability weights to each regime); (2) quantify the fundamental transmission to equities (e.g., capex responses, cash flow, and multiples) with concrete ranges rather than qualitative statements; (3) add 2–3 catalysts and 2–3 explicit invalidation points per regime (e.g., balance revisions crossing a threshold, refinery utilization deviating meaningfully, sanctions news turning materially more/less restrictive); (4) prune non-core content (SLB cash‑yield framing, GQG inflows, and unrelated “Simply Wall St” references) or relocate to an appendix, keeping the main brief focused on regime logic and asset implications; (5) ensure all claims cite IDs only from SOURCE MATERIAL (avoid Scraped Source 2, minimize duplicate anchors, and attach citations after the relevant facts); (6) trim the 0–3 week geopolitics section to 1–2 risk-focused bullets tied to risk premia rather than narrative, and (7) present the final output as 4–6 concise bullets or sentences that state the base case, the regime-driven price/valuation paths, the catalysts, and the watch-list with explicit invalidation criteria.",
