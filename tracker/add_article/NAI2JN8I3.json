Brent and WTI futures rose modestly to $67.79 and $63.75 respectively. The uptick was supported by expectations of a U.S. interest‑rate cut and a risk‑on market sentiment, while U.S. officials noted Russia's concessions in the Ukraine war. Fires at the Ust‑Luga terminal and Novoshakhtinsk refinery highlighted the growing threat to Russian oil exports.",
