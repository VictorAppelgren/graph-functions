      "feedback": "The draft is overly verbose, repeats the Fed‑yield‑spx causal chain, and drifts into generic “risk‑on” language that lacks explicit mapping to canonical handles. Tighten the narrative to a single, clear thesis: *Fed dovish pivot → 10‑yr UST rise 20–30 bp → spx +1–2 % over 3–6 mo*. Replace every “risk‑on” sentence with a concrete handle link (spx, ust10y) and a signed magnitude (e.g., “spx up 1.5 % if ust10y climbs 25 bp”). Consolidate data‑release discussion into a concise watch‑list: August 30 PCE, August 31 NFP, August 15 CPI, September Fed meeting. For each, state the directional impact on ust10y, DXY, and spx with a single numeric range and cite the ID. Remove redundant paragraphs that re‑state the same point. Add a short “risk” section that lists only the three catalysts with clear invalidation conditions (e.g., “Fed hawkish → ust10y falls 10 bp → spx down 1 %”). Ensure every claim has an inline citation; eliminate any sentence that does not directly tie back to spx, ust10y, or DXY. The final output should be a 4–5 sentence paragraph, each sentence ending with a citation, and no extraneous commentary.",
