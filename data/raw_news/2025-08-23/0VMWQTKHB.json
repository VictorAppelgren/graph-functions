  "content": "Below is Validea's guru fundamental report for BECTON DICKINSON AND CO (BDX). Of the 22 guru strategies we follow, BDX rates highest using our P/E/Growth Investor model based on the published strategy of Peter Lynch. This strategy looks for stocks trading at a reasonable price relative to earnings growth that also possess strong balance sheets.\n\nBECTON DICKINSON AND CO (BDX) is a large-cap growth stock in the Medical Equipment & Supplies industry. The rating using this strategy is 54% based on the firm\u2019s underlying fundamentals and the stock\u2019s valuation.

Not all criteria in the below table receive equal weighting or are independent, but the table provides a brief overview of the strong and weak points of the security in the context of the strategy's criteria.\n\nDetailed Analysis of BECTON DICKINSON AND CO\n\nAbout Peter Lynch: Perhaps the greatest mutual fund manager of all-time, Lynch guided Fidelity Investment's Magellan Fund to a 29.2 percent average annual return from 1977 until his retirement in 1990, almost doubling the S&P 500's 15.8 percent yearly return over that time. Lynch's common sense approach and quick wit made him one of the most quoted investors on Wall Street. (\"Go for a business that any idiot can run -- because sooner or later, any idiot probably is going to run it,\" is one of his many pearls of wisdom.) Lynch's bestseller One Up on Wall Street is something of a \"stocks for the everyman/everywoman\", breaking his approach down into easy-to-understand concepts.\n\nAbout Validea: Validea is aninvestment researchservice that follows the published strategies of investment legends.

Full Disclaimer\nSince 2003, this portfolio has returned 1,360.6%, outperforming the market by 810.1% using its optimal monthly rebalancing period and 20 stock portfolio size.\nGet the Top Ten Rated Stocks From Our Peter Lynch Portfolio\nGet StartedValidea used the investment strategy outlined in the book One Up On Wall Street written by Peter Lynch to create our P/E/Growth Investor portfolio.\nLynch's approach centers on a variable that he is famous for developing: The price/earnings/growth ratio, or \"PEG\". The PEG divides a stock's price/earnings ratio by its historic growth rate to find growth stocks selling on the cheap. Lynch's rationale: The faster a firm is growing, the higher the P/E multiple you should be willing to pay for its stock. Lynch is known for saying that investors can get a leg up on Wall Street by \"buying what they know\", but that's really just a starting point for him; his strategy goes far beyond investing in a restaurant chain you like or a retailer whose clothes you buy. Along with the PEG, he focused on fundamental variables like the debt/equity ratio, earnings per share growth rate, inventory/sales ratio, and free cash flow. It's important to note that Lynch used different criteria for different categories of stocks, with the three main categories being \"fast-growers\" (stocks with EPS growth rates of at least 20 percent per year); \"stalwarts\" (stocks with growth rates between 10 and 20 percent and multi-billion-dollar sales); and \"slow-growers\" (those with single-digit growth rates and high dividend payouts). He also used special criteria for financial stocks."

  "argos_summary": "Validea\u2019s P/E/Growth Investor model, based on Peter Lynch\u2019s PEG concept, rates Becton Dickinson & Co (BDX) at 54%, indicating moderate attractiveness but below the 80% threshold for strong interest. The strategy seeks stocks trading at a reasonable price relative to earnings growth and strong balance sheets, and BDX\u2019s fundamentals meet many of these criteria. Validea\u2019s model has delivered an average annual return of 12.9% since 2003, outperforming the S&P 500\u2019s 8.8% over the same period. The report includes extensive performance history, risk metrics, and a detailed explanation of Lynch\u2019s investment philosophy and Validea\u2019s methodology, with repeated disclaimer that model returns are hypothetical and not guaranteed.",
