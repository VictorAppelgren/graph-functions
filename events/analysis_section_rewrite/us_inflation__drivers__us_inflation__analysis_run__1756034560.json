      "feedback": "Actionable edits to upgrade to world-class quality (tight, numbers-driven, and testable): rebuild the piece around a crisp, explicit causal chain anchored in the sourced figures (AI/cloud uplift via Azure 39%, backlog 368B → durable revenue growth and margin leverage from a no‑code moat with switching costs/network effects; Shopify H1 metrics GMV 163B, Rev ~5B, OpInc up ~51% illustrate platform resilience feeding the S&P 500 thesis) and explicitly connect that chain to valuation (lower discount rates from policy easing) with exact references after each claim (0G3A676BP; GX057ADL7; SK994CBWR; TN66GHPAT); reorganize into base-case plus a short scenarios framework with clear catalysts and invalidation points (catalysts: Sept rate cut, 10Y around 4.23%, ACMR 2025 rev 850–950m, GM ~49%, D/E ~23%; IBM hiring pause as productivity proxy; J99EM2TPZ; 4LQD15CFU); add rigorous, source-backed watchlist of decisive signals (policy move priced in; 10Y yield trajectory around 4.0–4.3% with 4.23% anchor; ACMR updates; IBM hiring stance; oil price path per IEA: 2.5mbpd supply growth in 2025; US-China tariff truce extension 90 days per RHXDOHQQX; EU MFN ~15% on ~70% of goods per US tariffs); quantify every claim with the exact numbers and ranges from sources rather than qualitative statements, and explicitly reconcile conflicts (oil oversupply vs inflation risk; tariff truce vs escalation risk); ensure complete citation coverage of all critical sources (0G3A676BP, GX057ADL7, SK994CBWR, TN66GHPAT, 4LQD15CFU, J99EM2TPZ, RHXDOHQQX) and attach IDs after each fact; fix tone to first-principles discipline (discount-rate/long-duration cash flow logic) and add a one-sentence primer on the mechanism before the base-case; format should be a single tight paragraph with a short, clearly labeled watchlist and a concise set of invalidation points to meet the SECTION FOCUS without extra fluff.",
