  "title": "The U.S. Open is the strangest Grand Slam. Can Jannik Sinner tame it?",
  "description": "No man has defended the U.S. Open title in 17 years. Sinner, who has been unruffled on court the past year, is next in line.",
  "content": "FLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. \u2014 For a couple of hours Saturday afternoon, even the unflappable Jannik Sinner looked as though he was about to enter a long line of reigning U.S. Open champions to be thwarted. Denis Shapovalov, the firecracker Canadian, had Sinner down 0-3 in the third set with a point for 0-4. But Sinner, as he so often does, recognized that there was a lot of tennis to play and asked Shapovalov if he could play it, too. Sinner prevailed, 5-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.\n\nIn an era of men\u2019s tennis in which one or possibly two players have tended to lock up each individual major, the U.S. Open stands apart. Not since 2008 has a man successfully defended the title here, when Roger Federer won the last of his five U.S. Opens. All of the other majors have been successfully defended far more recently \u2014 either this year or last year, by Sinner or Carlos Alcaraz.\n\nSince 2008, Novak Djokovic has gone on winning streaks of three in a row at the Australian Open (twice) and four in a row at Wimbledon. Rafael Nadal went on runs of five in a row and four in a row at Roland Garros. And Djokovic, who might have been expected to dominate here like he did in Melbourne and in London at his peak, has never managed to do so.\n\nSunday night in New York he recalled his 2012 title defense being disrupted when a tornado warning saw his semifinal against David Ferrer abandoned for the day, with spectators sent home. A shoulder injury ended his title defense in 2019; in 2020 he was defaulted for striking a line judge with a ball, and in 2021 he was overwhelmed by the emotion of being one match away from tennis\u2019 holy grail: the calendar Grand Slam.\n\nDaniil Medvedev, once \u2014 and still \u2014 a pantomime villain in New York known for taunting the crowd, embraced the chaos to beat Djokovic in that final.\n\nThe last 11 editions of the U.S. Open men\u2019s singles tournament have included eight different winners. Three of them lifted their only major title here. In the same period, there have been five winners at the Australian Open and Wimbledon, and four at the French Open.\n\nAll of which sets up the week ahead as the clash between the player who typifies calm and control and the venue that exudes chaos. Sinner, who is also the world No. 1 and who has won the last three hard-court Grand Slams, takes on a player with the opposite temperament, the mercurial and unpredictable No. 23 seed Alexander Bublik, on Monday at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center.\n\nTennis can overindex on these kinds of statistics, searching for a unifying theory of chaos where one does not exist. But at the U.S. Open, several players said that what feels like randomness and unpredictability actually has its roots in the very time and place of the tournament.\n\nMadison Keys, who was so fresh when she won the Australian Open in January, admitted that she allowed bad habits to return during her first-round defeat to Renata Zaraz\u00faa because she did not have the energy to stop them. Every four years, the Olympics takes place just before the U.S. Open, leaving players even more emotionally and physically exhausted coming into the year\u2019s final major. Witness Djokovic and Alcaraz both bombing out early last year, after their emotional gold medal match a few weeks earlier.\n\nAlexander Zverev, who reached his first Grand Slam final here in 2020, only to lose to Dominic Them, who lifted the only major title of his career, said its place in the schedule was \u201cthe biggest reason\u201d for the U.S. Open\u2019s unpredictability.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the Masters events, the most unpredictable tournament is Paris Bercy, the last Masters event of the year,\u201d Zverev said, before the No. 3 seed exited this year\u2019s event at the third-round stage to Felix Auger-Aliassime, who had previously never beaten a top-five player at a major.\n\nThe last player to successfully defend the men\u2019s singles title at the U.S. Open before Federer was Pat Rafter. The Australian won his two Grand Slam titles in New York, in 1997 and 1998. His strategy was to embrace the madness and let other players fall apart amid distractions and uncertainty.\n\n\u201cI was always one of those people that liked it when other people were uncomfortable, because I knew I had an advantage,\u201d he said in a video interview last week. \u201cI\u2019d sit there and know they\u2019re not enjoying this. It\u2019s too loud, or the smells of the hot dogs are p\u2014ing them off. Or the planes going overhead and the wind. The people talking through points.\u201d\n\nBublik, who thrives on chaos of his own creation on the court and that of the crowd off it, will tap into that dynamic against the metronomic Sinner.\n\nNaomi Osaka, the only multiple women\u2019s winner from the last 11 editions, joked on Saturday that New York brings out her best behavior, rather than irritation. This year in New York, various players have had run-ins with each other and with umpires, among them Medvedev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Jelena Ostapenko.\n\nJessica Pegula, last year\u2019s beaten finalist, referenced this ahead of the tournament. \u201cWe have seen a lot of those stories over the years on the men\u2019s and women\u2019s side where the crowd gets behind somebody, or like Medvedev when he flipped the crowd that one year (2019),\u201d she said. \u201cThere are so many storylines I think of the crowd kind of taking people and carrying them through in whatever way you kind of embrace them. I don\u2019t think you get that at the other Slams.\u201d\n\nAnother factor, according to several players, is New York itself. Sinner identified this in his pre-tournament news conference.\n\n\u201cWe are sleeping in the city, it takes one hour to come in,\u201d he said. The commute from Manhattan to Queens is in stark contrast to the other majors. At Wimbledon, players generally cocoon themselves in a house, a short walk from the All England Club and well away from the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough to keep consistent, because you have to deal with the traffic, you have deal with the city,\u201d Tsitsipas, who was knocked out of this year\u2019s event by Daniel Altmaier in a typically fractious late-night New York affair, said in an interview.\n\n\u201cSmall things,\u201d Sinner said. \u201cBut I feel if you don\u2019t handle them very well, then it\u2019s also very difficult to play the best possible tennis.\u201d\n\nIga \u015awi\u0105tek, who won the title in 2022 but did not succeed in defending it, has spoken of how the city affects her natural routines on several occasions. She prefers day sessions over the famed Arthur Ashe Stadium nights.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be the calmest slam and the one that is, like, focused on players that much, because it\u2019s more focused on entertainment and the show. So we kind of need to adjust to that and accept that. It\u2019s always kind of tougher to be in a bubble here,\u201d she said.\n\nSo, can Sinner bring order to the most chaotic major?\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe Djokovic hasn\u2019t won twice in a row here,\u201d said Brad Gilbert, the former world No. 4 who coached Andre Agassi and Andy Roddick to U.S. Open titles, in a phone interview last week. \u201cBut this guy [Sinner] is amazing on a hard court and, I wouldn\u2019t be shocked over the next seven, eight years, if he wins five of them.\u201d\n\nOne element that could help Sinner is the absence this year of one of the tournament\u2019s usual variables: the weather. The sweltering heat and oppressive humidity of late summer in New York can wipe out a tournament favorite \u2014 Federer looked to be drowning in his own sweat against the unseeded John Millman in 2018 \u2014 but the conditions are relatively clement this year. This is especially helpful for Sinner, who has at times struggled in the heat.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t look like we\u2019ll have it this year but that can be a variable that can really throw things upside down,\u201d said Jim Courier, the former world No. 1 and Tennis Channel analyst at the U.S. Open, said in an interview.\n\nCourier, a four-time Grand Slam champion, is another who could never tame the New York beast.\n\nSinner himself said that at the U.S. Open \u201cit changes a lot if you play at night or if you play (during the) day.\u201d It was a day match against Shapovalov on Saturday, as it was against Holger Rune at the Australian Open earlier this year, when he struggled in the conditions and was given a reprieve when a broken net enforced a short delay in play.\n\nSinner, who in his own words likes to \u201cdance in the pressure storm,\u201d knows he is not immune to the chaos. That should make for an interesting second week, as well as a compelling encounter with the engimatic Bublik.\n\nAs Sinner put it on Saturday after getting past Shapovalov, he is not a machine.",

      "text": "ROLAND GARROS, PARIS \u2014 At the end of a match in Miami four years ago, Jannik Sinner and Alexander Bublik met at the net and had a short conversation. Sinner, 19 at the time, had just won a tight quarterfinal 7-6(5) 6-4, but he was astonished by the performance of his opponent. In just the fourth game, Bublik had edged forward to return a serve from halfway between the baseline and the service line, chipping a forehand at Sinner\u2019s feet and then flicking away a half-volley drop shot at the net.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYou\u2019re not human,\u201d a laughing Sinner said.\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Bublik replied. \u201cYou\u2019re not a human, man. You\u2019re 15 years old, playing like this.\u201d\nThe exchange \u2014 and match \u2014 encapsulated why Bublik, who will face the now-world No. 1 Sinner again in a French Open quarterfinal on Wednesday, is one of the most fascinating players on the ATP Tour.\nBublik, 27, is a proud nonconformist, a richly talented maverick from Kazakhstan who, on his day, can beat anyone, but who insists he will not sacrifice his health and his work-life balance to maximise his talents. Whether it\u2019s hitting shots with the handle of his racket in a final, smashing rackets, trying to throw a bottle up and getting it to land during a change-of-ends, chatting to spectators mid-match or serving a whole game of aces, Bublik is magnetic. He\u2019s also the king of the underarm serve, hitting six in a single game on more than one occasion.\nHe has been ranked as high as No. 17, but is currently No. 62 after losing motivation last year when he cracked the top 20 for the first time in May. He said a few years ago after beating former Roland Garros champion Stan Wawrinka in Monte Carlo, Monaco that: \u201cI hate clay, I hate this surface.\u201d And yet here he is, in his first Grand Slam quarterfinal on his least favourite surface.\nAfter bamboozling world No. 5 Jack Draper to reach the last eight, Bublik spoke about how he doesn\u2019t fit the mould of the modern, hyper-focused tennis player, a subject that he has discussed throughout the tournament.\n\u201cRight now, everybody is like robots, and they\u2019re just crazy, crazy performance guys,\u201d he said in a news conference prior to that match.\nSinner embodies that sentiment: someone who works phenomenally hard to maximise his talents. Someone whose biggest vice, according to a recent YouTube video, is driving golf karts quite fast around Melbourne Park or eating a burger after winning a Grand Slam.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI\u2019m the guy you can see having a nice time down the street in Paris in the evening before the match,\u201d Bublik said. \u201cNot to go crazy, but I\u2019m social. I can skip the practice if I don\u2019t feel like it.\n\u201cIn my opinion, I\u2019m super normal, and they make me feel different.\u201d\nBublik\u2019s musings pose a fundamental question. Who is normal in elite tennis: a player like Bublik, or a player who sacrifices every part of their life for the sake of reducing the number that comes after their name?\n\u201cI prioritize tennis and the life in equal ways,\u201d Bublik said after beating Draper on Monday.\n\u201cSo, for me, it\u2019s a 50-50 relationship. If I can\u2019t walk at the age of 40, it\u2019s OK? No, it\u2019s not.\n\u201cI prioritize health and my lifestyle, because I have a family and I\u2019m a father (Bublik has a two-year-old son, Wassily), and I have to do the father duties.\u201d\nBublik insists that he does work hard, but not heedlessly. If he wants to miss a practice, he will. His style of tennis makes it easier for him to do that than most, because as with other mercurial players on the tour like Nick Kyrgios, he is blessed with skills that practice can groove but not create.\nLike most crafty players, he has incredible hands and an innate understanding of how points work and how to turn them upside down. Unlike most crafty players, he also has a 140mph serve, liquid power on his forehand and backhand and a large wingspan at 6 feet 5 inches tall. He doesn\u2019t have to work as hard as his peers to be a top-50 player.\nHe is also quite calculated and knows how much he needs to do to stay at that kind of level. It was his dropping to No. 80 in March this year that prompted him to apply himself on the clay, having had a wretched record on it for most of his career. He has interests outside of tennis, like investments in real estate and a curiosity about cryptocurrency. He is a reader.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe\u2019s very bright and quite worldly,\u201d said a staff member \u2014 speaking on the condition of anonymity to protect relationships \u2014 who worked with him on the Ultimate Tennis Showdown exhibition circuit.\n\u201cI think that can come across as a little cynical but my impression is that actually he\u2019s just experienced and smart enough to understand how things work.\u201d\nBublik\u2019s claims about his work ethic at the French Open have also exposed something fundamental about the expectations fans and players have about normality in elite sport. In any other walk of life, work-life balance is held up as essential. If a friend or family member were doing nothing but pushing themselves relentlessly in their job, at the expense of everything else, people would be expected to check that they were OK.\nIn sport, it\u2019s the opposite. Utter dedication to a chosen craft is fetishized. The hours spent refining the forehand, or the swing, or the shot. The Olympic rower who woke up at 3 a.m. every day for four years in pursuit of a bronze medal. Doing otherwise is framed as a waste of talent.\nBublik does not deem this normal.\n\u201cIf you want to sleep, you just sleep,\u201d he said in a news conference at Roland Garros.\n\u201cI mean, we are top athletes. Someone made like 100 million, 25 titles, and he still wants to go for more. For me, that\u2019s not normal, in my opinion. But they make me feel like this.\n\u201cNowadays sport makes me feel like this, that I\u2019m different, which I don\u2019t believe so because I think I\u2019m just normal guy that was playing tennis and made it.\u201d\nBublik\u2019s long-time agent and manager Corrado Tschabuschnig, who started working with him at 17, gave a window into his psyche during an interview at Roland Garros on Tuesday.\n\u201cIf a player arrives late because he has a delay and he sleeps just five hours instead of eight hours, often he feels he cannot perform the next day because mentally he\u2019s completely destroyed,\u201d Tschabuschnig said.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cAlex can sleep one hour and he goes to the court and he says, \u2018Let\u2019s see what happens. If I\u2019m tired, I just tank a set and sleep and then I play the third one.\u2019\n\u201cHe\u2019s less bound to circumstances around him that he cannot control.\u201d\nSomething striking about Bublik\u2019s run at the French Open has been his speed of play between points. When he is losing, it looks like he wants out, but when he is winning, opponents get sucked into a vortex of aces and drop shots. Tschabuschnig said that Bublik is now serving and playing with such speed because he wants to win, not just because he wants to get off the court quickly.\nHe has constantly changed his goals, from getting to the top 50 to the top 20, to winning an ATP 500 title, to beating a top-10 player. All of which he\u2019s done \u2014 but without compromising on who he is.\n\u201cHe was not very keen on authority and discipline when we first met and he was not going to be the person who follows instructions,\u201d Tschabuschnig said.\n\u201cIt was clear that he was going to be one of those players that needed to fall and stand up, that you could not prevent from falling. But you can advise him what to do in case he doesn\u2019t want to fall the second time.\u201d\nBublik has made some concessions as he seeks to rebuild his ranking, playing fewer of his most ludicrous trick shots \u2014 the underarm tweener serve, the shots with the racket handle, the dummied smash that turns into a drop shot \u2014 but he showed no mercy in scrambling Draper\u2019s brain with his variety.\n\u201cI don\u2019t play many matches where I feel like it\u2019s almost out of my control what\u2019s going on, and he made that happen today,\u201d said Draper after the match. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\nTschabuschnig said that Bublik\u2019s apparently random approach is actually entirely planned. \u201cHe has no other option than to hit winners, to play with risk, to play drop shots and to come to the net \u2026 But it doesn\u2019t mean that you do it because you don\u2019t care. You do it, because you think that\u2019s the way to win.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cBecause if he practices well for six months, he\u2019s going to face a Medvedev who practised well for 11 years. So what are we going to tell him? Or a Sinner who\u2019s practiced for 15 years.\u201d\nIn a scintillating return game that decided the fourth set and ultimately the match against the Brit, Bublik broke to love with a backhand winner, a forehand passing shot, a drop shot winner and a service return winner. He also looked at his box and gave them a wink in the third set, when a clearly frazzled Draper hit a double fault.\n\u201cHe loves to get in his opponent\u2019s head,\u201d Tschabuschnig said. \u201cAnd when he\u2019s in there, he doesn\u2019t let go. It\u2019s like he\u2019s got a drill in there.\u201d\nBublik is plenty relatable for someone whose tennis talents are so otherworldly. He likes to wake up at 9 or 10 a.m. and finds early starts hard. During his five-set win against the ultra-professional No. 9 seed Alex de Minaur in the second round, his mind wandered to the logistics of getting home when he was two sets down.\nHis turning point for his change in attitude this year wasn\u2019t a great training block or match, but a blowout in Las Vegas with his coach.\nHe can be a difficult customer, too. His racket smashes and propensity to give up in difficult circumstances can put people off, while he can be brusque off the court, giving little truck to questions or topics that he doesn\u2019t view as interesting. When asked by this reporter in a one-on-one interview to talk about his underarm serves, Bublik was unimpressed.\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be a big deal \u2014 it\u2019s just a stupid shot that gives a player an advantage,\u201d he said.\nHe is also open about his bewilderment at how tennis has changed. During a defeat to rising teenager Jakub Men\u0161\u00edk earlier this year, Bublik bemoaned the concentration of talent that is moving down the tennis ladder.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cRemember when tennis was easy, eh?\u201d he said to umpire Mohamed Lahyani.\n\u201cLike five years ago, it was super easy to play tennis, huh? Yeah, bunch of random people in the top 50, barely moving.\u201d Pointing to Men\u0161\u00edk, he expressed his disbelief at the Czech not being a top-five player. But his peers hold his style and recent exploits in high regard.\nAryna Sabalenka, the women\u2019s world No. 1, said on Tuesday of Bublik\u2019s performance against Draper: \u201cThat was crazy. If he would play the way he played against Draper every time he\u2019s out there, I think he would be in the top 10.\u201d\nTommy Paul, the American world No. 12, said in a news conference at Wimbledon last year that Bublik\u2019s huge power on serve, coupled with the fact that he can chuck in an underarm one at any moment, means that when he is serving \u201cyou have to keep your eyes on him at all times. You actually cannot take your eyes off of him.\u201d\nBublik\u2019s team believe he has the talent to win a Grand Slam, and could one day win Wimbledon on the grass where his game is best suited. He won his only 500-level title, two levels below the Grand Slams, on grass at the Halle Open in Germany two years ago.\nFor now though, the focus is absolutely on the clay, a surface Bublik previously detested. He\u2019s loved at Roland Garros, helped by speaking decent French. During an emotional post-match speech after beating Draper, in which Bublik described the win as the best moment of his life, he was given the kind of loud and heartfelt ovation that is generally reserved for home players.\nIn the interview room, Bublik then insisted that the experience won\u2019t change his approach. \u201cThe good thing about this question is you mentioned that you \u2018might get,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\u201cWill I put my life and health on the line to have a \u201cmight\u201d? A maybe? No.\u201d\nAgainst Sinner, a December conversation with Ga\u00ebl Monfils, another mercurial talent, may feel pertinent.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI was complaining. I was losing. I was on a losing streak,\u201d Bublik explained Saturday. I said, \u2018Ga\u00ebl, it was so easy. (But now) everyone is playing so good.\u2019\n\u201cGa\u00ebl said: \u2018You wait for your chances. You have your chances, you use it. If you waste it, it\u2019s your problem.\u2019\u201d\nEven if Bublik does waste his chance against Sinner, it won\u2019t be the end of his world.\n(Top photo: Andy Cheung / Getty Images)"

      "text": "Follow live updates from Day 8 of the U.S. Open on The Athletic\nDaniil Medvedev has split with Gilles Cervara, his coach of eight years, following his ignominious first-round exit from the U.S. Open.\nThe Russian former world No. 1 and his longtime French coach have finally parted ways after almost a decade together. Even Medvedev himself appears to have lost track of the time, judging from his post on social media announcing the split after another dispiriting first-round loss in a Grand Slam.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThank you Gilles,\u201d Medvedev wrote with a heart emoji. \u201cAmazing 8-10 years together, 20 titles, world number 1 but most importantly a lot of fun moments and memories that will stay with us forever. I am grateful to you for guiding me through all these years and let\u2019s see what life brings us in the future.\u201d\nAs tennis partnerships go, the relationship between Medvedev and Cervara lasted an eternity.\nWhen Cervara and Medvedev first got together, Medvedev was a teenager considered the least promising of a young crop of Russian talent that included Karen Khachanov and Andrey Rublev. He has turned out to be the best of the lot, one of a small group of players since the Big Three of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal to both win a Grand Slam title and hold the No. 1 world ranking. Medvedev captured the U.S. Open title in 2021, with a win that deprived Novak Djokovic of the calendar Grand Slam.\nMedvedev, who is as analytical off the court as he is temperamental on it, has fallen on tough times since then. His once reliable and often lethal serve has become attackable as it has lost velocity and quality, while his counterpunching approach to the game \u2014 which once redefined baseline strategies, and made Djokovic and Rafael Nadal evolve their own strategies \u2014 appears somewhat out of step with a new generation of players who are experts at first-strike tennis.\nFor the second consecutive Grand Slam, Medvedev lost in the first round to Benjamin Bonzi, a middling French player, in a match that made headlines last week when the 29-year-old threw a tantrum on match point in the third set when Bonzi was awarded an extra serve. Medvedev then staged a dramatic comeback from a two-set deficit but lost in five and sat motionless on the side of the court as Bonzi gave his post-match interview.\nAdvertisement\nHe flew home to Monaco the next day and did some soul-searching with his wife about what it might take to regain his form and return to the top of the sport, ultimately coming to a conclusion that everyone on the team had been pondering as the sub-standard results piled up..\nIn addition to parting ways with Cervara, Medvedev is also in the market for a new fitness trainer. He will no longer work with Eric Hernandez, another member of his team who has been with him for the better part of a decade. Medvedev has not named any replacements. He plans to speak with numerous candidates before making a choice. He will be outside the top 15 when he returns to the tour, his lowest spot since 2019.\n(Photo: Elsa / Getty Images)"

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of the 2025 U.S. Open\nFLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. \u2014 Novak Djokovic did something important Friday night at the U.S. Open.\nAfter wandering through his first two matches in something like a daze, devoid of nearly all his intensity and passion and looking like he didn\u2019t care all that much about the outcome, he found his mojo.\nAdvertisement\nDjokovic, 38, spent his first two matches looking like he wanted to be anywhere but Flushing Meadows. He appeared downright disinterested during his first-round win over the young American Learner Tien on the opening night of the tournament. He faced some real jeopardy in the next round against another young American, Zachary Svajda, who took the first set and was up a break in the second. Djokovic barely bothered with the usual protocol of his off-nights and slow days, when he badgers his coaches and sometimes snaps a racket to fire himself up.\nSvajda ultimately succumbed as Tien had done, partly due to cramping. Through both matches, Djokovic barely acknowledged the thousands of fans that packed Arthur Ashe Stadium to get their fill of the 24-time Grand Slam champion before he drifts over the rainbow,\nBut after two cranky sets against Cameron Norrie on Friday, which included a medical timeout after an awkward twist at the net, Djokovic got his groove back. He served as well as he ever has at the U.S. Open, with 18 aces. He defended all across the baseline. He chased down drop shots, pumped his fists, roused the crowd for big noise after his best shots, and even wriggled a few slinky dance steps after a massive, roaring forehand gave him match point for a four-set win.\nBut as he moves into the second week of a Grand Slam for the 69th time in his career, Djokovic comes face-to-face with a question that he hasn\u2019t had to confront in a long time, if ever: Does it matter?\nDjokovic plays Jan-Lennard Struff of Germany on Sunday. At 35, Struff is a rare contemporary of Djokovic. He\u2019s 0-7 against the Serbian. If Djokovic makes it 0-8, he will get the winner of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Mach\u00e1\u010d and Taylor Fritz. Fritz, last year\u2019s beaten singles finalist, is 0-10 against Djokovic; Mach\u00e1\u010d, a preternatural Czech talent with some of the best pure strokes on the planet, beat Djokovic last year in Geneva.\nAdvertisement\nBut that was in three sets, with Djokovic still recovering from accidentally being struck on the head with a metal water bottle at the Italian Open. Mach\u00e1\u010d crumbled in the crucible of Grand Slam pressure in Australia this January, losing in three sets in 2 hours and 22 minutes.\nIf he gets through those two matches, he will once again be just two wins from a 25th Grand Slam title. But, in all likelihood, Carlos Alcaraz, 22, and Jannik Sinner, 24, will be looming on the final weekend. Djokovic knows of the potential hopelessness that those two players give opponents more than perhaps anybody else.\nHe spoke his truth at Wimbledon in July, after losing to Sinner in a major semifinal for the second time in five weeks. On both occasions, the Italian\u2019s victory clinched a final against Alcaraz.\n\u201cThey\u2019re definitely several levels above everyone right now,\u201d Djokovic said.\nThen he essentially disappeared for five weeks for an extended vacation with his family. They generally spend the weeks between Wimbledon and the hard-court swing in North America in Montenegro, before he reappears in Mason, Ohio, for the Cincinnati Open.\nDjokovic skipped that, opting to rest his mind and his body and extend the family time. After that loss on the grass to Sinner, he said that this year of tennis had introduced him to a new, undesirable pattern. At all three Grand Slams, he arrived at the business end of the tournament with his gas tank half-empty. His mind said go. His body said no.\nIn Melbourne, he injured his hamstring in his feverish quarterfinal win over Alcaraz and retired after one set of his semifinal match against Alexander Zverev.\nIn Paris, he came out flat against Sinner, fell behind quickly and spent the rest of the evening trying to catch up. By the time he found some rhythm and a second or third wind in the third set, Sinner had the finish line in sight. Djokovic had to play perfect tennis, which he very nearly did, but it was already too late.\nAdvertisement\nAt Wimbledon in July, he fell hard on the Centre Court grass on one of the final points of his quarterfinal win over Flavio Cobolli, injuring his hip. He was able to play his semifinal against Sinner, but his movement was limited and he lost in three sets.\nSince then, he has been trying to solve one more fitness riddle. Djokovic had mastered surviving two weeks of five-set tennis, over a two-decade career that has seen him win 24 of the most important titles in his sport, more than any man in the modern era.\nThen two generational talents came along. They require a different form of mastery from the one that contemporaries Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray demanded.\nFor going on two decades, Djokovic has been willing to try just about anything if it will provide his body a tenth of a percentage point improvement.\nHe eats and drinks like an ascetic, though he doesn\u2019t see it that way. He forgoes alcohol and tries as often as he can to eat produce from high-quality soil.\nHe has locked himself inside egg-shaped hyperbaric chambers to mitigate recuperation from competition and training. He has worn mysterious patches on his chest when he plays. His post-match gym sessions sometimes look harder than other players\u2019 off-season fitness training.\nAnd yet he knows it might be all for nothing.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there is much more that I could do than what I\u2019m doing now, to be honest,\u201d Djokovic said after the win over Norrie. This is not the easiest thing for anyone to accept, especially someone who has never confronted a mountain he could not climb or an obstacle he could not overcome on the tennis court.\nNow he is running into time and the realities of growing older, the walls that anyone who has ever played a sport eventually fails to blast through. He\u2019s playing a game he knows he\u2019s unlikely to win, one he\u2019s ultimately going to lose, maybe even in a few days, even if he does have a couple more moments against the likes of Fritz, Struff and Mach\u00e1\u010d.\nAdvertisement\nThere are some buzzsaws waiting on the other side. And even if he finds the four-leaf clover in the vast meadow and manages one last win over one of the two best players in the world, he\u2019s likely going to have to beat the other one, too.\n\u201cIf the body doesn\u2019t listen to me when I go deep in the Grand Slam tournaments, as it was kind of the case the last few Slams, then that\u2019s a hard one to swallow for me,\u201d he said after beating Norrie.\n\u201cI know the amount of hours I\u2019m putting in daily to care for my body, but at the same time, you know, biological age is not something that you can reverse, and it is what it is. The wear and tear on the body all these years is taking a toll, and I\u2019m aware of it, but I\u2019m resisting it.\u201d\nSometimes that goes better than others. For two and a half matches during the first week of his 81st Grand Slam, it wasn\u2019t going well at all, and Djokovic didn\u2019t even try to hide how he felt about it. He promised his on-court demeanor was only a result of his frustration with his level of play, and not a reflection of not wanting to be in New York competing, knowing that if he played well and advanced, he was going to miss his daughter Tara\u2019s birthday on Sept. 2, which he was not happy about.\nIn his on-court interview after beating Norrie, he pointed down the camera like a supervillain in a film, warning any rivals watching that he would not reveal his physical secrets.\nHe knew there was a risk in coming in cold, though he had trained seriously in the three weeks leading up to the tournament. The Masters 1000 events like Cincinnati, which now stretch to nearly two weeks, are too long for him, he said.\nCompetition, physicality, endurance \u2014 those were no problem. The problem was that he wasn\u2019t playing well.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a motivation thing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just like me being a bit frustrated with my game, and then I kind of go through stuff internally that you don\u2019t want to know the details of what I\u2019m going through and telling myself. I\u2019m just trying to be locked in. Just trying to solve the riddle once I\u2019m on the court.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThen came the physical problems early in the match against Norrie. Leading 5-3 in the first set, Djokovic twisted awkwardly for a volley as he ran across the court and appeared to tweak his lower back. He left the court for a medical timeout and received treatment for about five minutes before resuming play.\nDjokovic served out the first set but faltered in the second, unable to get the required torque to effectively execute his ground strokes. He received further treatment after the third game of that set, swallowed some painkillers, and embarked on a familiar routine of trying to keep the match close and buy time as the medication began to work, which usually takes 30-45 minutes.\nAt 4-4, in the second set, he moved sharply to his right to chase down a ball and jarred his body as he planted his feet to push back toward the middle of the court. He stumbled to the ground and rose slowly.\nLeading 4-1 in the third set after Norrie had drawn even, Djokovic came up gingerly after a quick move to his right, sustaining some pain in his right foot that forced him to essentially concede the next three points.\nFor Djokovic, it looked like it was about to become the third Grand Slam of the year that ended with his body failing him. But then came the mojo, and the fist pumps and the playing to the crowd. The full-bore, first-strike tennis which has supplanted the mastery of baseline attrition that he made his trademark clicked into gear. Norrie had little answer to any of it, but Djokovic\u2019s body continued to ask his brain plenty of questions.\nNow he has to figure out the answer to the biggest ones of all: How far it can take him; how long he wants to try to work through that puzzle and whether or not the payoff he needs is even attainable. As long as he can convince himself, he wants to keep trying. He says he still enjoys the competition and the challenge, but there is an ongoing conversation with himself about how long this ride keeps going.\nHe\u2019d prefer not to find that out this week, but he knows he can only push it off for so long.\n\u201cI try to focus my thoughts and my attention to this very present moment of what needs to be done,\u201d he said. \u201cI might get a little more philosophical again when I finish the tournament.\u201d\n(Top photo: Charly Triballeau / AFP via Getty Images)"

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of the 2025 U.S. Open\nIn early June, Jannik Sinner suffered the sort of defeat that could cause years of psychological damage. He squandered three match points in the fourth set of the French Open final, before losing a fifth-set tiebreak to his nearest and only rival at the top of tennis, Carlos Alcaraz.\nAdvertisement\nSo he went home. Sinner retreated to Sesto, the tiny Alpine village in northeast Italy where he was raised, seeking the comfort of his family. His parents and his grandfather still live there.\nFive weeks later, Sinner won Wimbledon, beating Alcaraz after dropping a first set that Alcaraz had won with the kind of impossible stolen point that he has used to crush the spirits of opponents, including Sinner. A Wimbledon title is the kind of life-changing triumph that has sent previous winners\u2019 heads and hearts into the clouds. Sinner, a tall and handsome 24-year-old who has already amassed a nine-figure fortune in prize money and endorsement deals, could satisfy nearly any desire with a few taps of his phone.\nHe went home.\nSinner slept in his brother\u2019s old bedroom because his is filled with other stuff now. He went for walks. He played cards and board games with his close relatives and played some golf with his dad, when his father didn\u2019t have to work at the local restaurant where he is a chef. He caught up with some old friends and drove around the picturesque mountain roads.\n\u201cWe take success and defeat the same way,\u201d Sinner said in a rare one-on-one interview at the Cincinnati Open earlier this month. \u201cThe most important thing is that we are healthy, that we are having a nice time together.\u201d\nHe paused for a moment, before noting the obvious.\n\u201cOf course everyone is more happy if I win,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut at the same time, even if I lose, they\u2019re happy that I come back, that I want to see them, that I have a great time with my friends, and people I really, really care about. So it was something very, very nice in both ways.\n\u201cI believe in important moments to come back home to see the people I love.\u201d\nOver the years, the kings and queens of tennis have assumed all sorts of identities. Club-hopping partiers. Celebrity titans who enjoy rubbing shoulders with the royalty of fashion and finance. Sinner appears dead-set on the identity that appears to come naturally to him, at least for now.\nAdvertisement\nHe desperately just wants to remain a simple guy from a simple family, the son of a cook and a waitress and the brother of a firefighting instructor, who more often than not \u2014 and even when he\u2019s let a Grand Slam slip through his fingers \u2014 finds his way toward a kind of amenable stoicism.\n\u201cWe always speak about the champion mentality, you know,\u201d Sinner\u2019s main coach, Simone Vagnozzi, said during a recent interview. \u201cThe champion\u2019s mentality is going out in the difficult situation.\u201d\nLast August, Sinner went out to New York in the most difficult situation of his career. The tennis anti-doping authorities had just announced what appeared to be the conclusion of an anti-doping investigation into Sinner, after he twice tested positive for clostebol, a banned anabolic steroid, in March 2024.\nAn independent tribunal convened by the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) accepted the explanation that Sinner\u2019s physiotherapist, Giacomo Naldi, used a first-aid cream containing the substance on a cut finger, then gave Sinner massages through which he contaminated the player. It ruled that Sinner bore \u201cno fault or negligence\u201d for the two positive tests, as well as finding that he did not intentionally dope.\nThat announcement went public a few hours before Sinner\u2019s plane touched down in New York City. He headed to the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center to face players and journalists seeking an explanation of what had been going on in secret during the first five months of Sinner\u2019s reign atop the sport. Sinner continued to play because he quickly and successfully appealed the provisional suspension that he received for each positive test, in line with ITIA protocol.\nA U.S. Open media official tried to shut down questions during his opening news conference. There was uproar. Sinner overruled him and tried to explain what had transpired. Two weeks later, when he won the tournament, he spoke of the dark journey the tournament had been, a struggle more than a triumph. Still, it appeared to be over.\nAdvertisement\nIt was not. The World Anti-Doping Agency appealed the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and sought what would have been a career-derailing ban of two years, arguing that Sinner should bear responsibility for having an illegal substance in his system, even though it agreed that he did not intentionally dope. Sinner\u2019s tennis future remained in jeopardy for six months, even as he won the season-ending ATP Tour Finals, the Davis Cup, and the Australian Open.\nIn the end, WADA reached a case resolution agreement with the Italian. Sinner received a three-month ban, which he did not want to accept, between the end of the Australian Open in January and the start of the Italian Open in May. He returned to a hero\u2019s welcome, met tennis fan Pope Leo just days after his elevation, and got on with winning tennis matches when just about anyone not named Alcaraz stood on the other side of the net.\nThen, five weeks after Alcaraz completed the epic Roland Garros comeback that solidified their rivalry as the apotheosis of men\u2019s tennis, Sinner beat him on Centre Court at Wimbledon, the sport\u2019s grandest stage. He arrives in New York about as far removed from 2024 as he could be.\n\u201cLast year was a much more stressful situation because of the timing before a Grand Slam. It was difficult to handle everything. Also for me, you know, I\u2019m still young, so it was not easy,\u201d he said in a news conference on Friday.\nHe could say he used to dream that his life might be like this, but that would be a lie. In the tiny mountain town of Sesto, Sinner the boy never bothered to dream of something so ridiculous as being a Wimbledon champion. And don\u2019t look for his parents in New York. They\u2019re back home in Italy, at work.\n\u201cToo far, too busy,\u201d he says.\nHe says this in the most commonsensical way, even though the parents of so many other stars always find their way into their children\u2019s courtside boxes and onto television screens. Sinner\u2019s dad, Hanspeter, missed the French Open final. During U.S. Open fortnight, which occupies the last weeks of summer tourist season in the Dolomites, he has many shifts at the restaurant where he works.\nAdvertisement\nHis mother, Siglinde, no longer waits tables but manages a few small apartments his family owns. She was courtside during his run to the finals in Rome, Paris, and, thankfully, London. She has become something of an avatar of the Sinner experience in recent months, watching her son endure the most stressful moments of his on-court career. Sinner is the duck\u2019s back, water sliding off; Siglinde is the feet whirring below the surface, shock and awe etched on her face.\nShe had promised to come if he ever played a final in Europe, though she finds it so stressful that she prefers to watch on television. After he dropped the first set in his semifinal against Tommy Paul at the Italian Open, she had to leave the stadium.\nSinner says he has pleaded with her to maintain her perspective, which is really his. It\u2019s just a tennis match, he tells her. The worst thing that can happen is that he loses. They still get to live this unbelievably fortunate existence the next day.\nIt\u2019s the sort of message the parent is supposed to deliver to the child, not the other way around. In some ways, the French Open loss may have been the exact kind of exposure therapy his mother needed.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the worst thing that happens,\u201d Sinner said. Then a deep breath and a shake of the head. \u201cParents, I guess.\u201d\nOne day, perhaps, they will come around to his way of thinking. \u201cYou cannot live this sport stressfully for 20 years, 15 years. So I always said, we are good, we\u2019re healthy, I\u2019m playing the biggest tennis match in this moment. So even if I lose, sometimes you lose, and sometimes you win.\u201d\nSinner wasn\u2019t always so zen about his results. He did not always possess that tennis poker face, where it\u2019s nearly impossible to tell whether he\u2019s putting on one of his absurd ballstriking clinics or having one of his once-in-a-blue-moon off days. There was a time around his mid-teens, when he was first starting to play professional matches and losing a lot of them, that he took the defeats hard, sometimes losing his temper when his game would unravel.\nAdvertisement\nHe knew why. His parents were spending just about every extra euro they had on his tennis development, and they didn\u2019t have many extra euros. Worse, he knew how hard they worked. Restaurant work is not for the faint of heart: his dad, on his feet in a hot kitchen all day and into the night; his mother on her feet, in and out of that hot kitchen, all day and into the night. On a good day during his childhood, Sinner would see them for a couple of hours.\n\u201cThey were tired, and I had to sleep early because I had school,\u201d he said.\nAll of a sudden, he was traveling around, losing tennis matches and their money. His parents never complained, but he hated what was happening.\nEverything changed, he said, when he was 18. He won enough matches, including the ATP Next Gen Finals, a year-end tournament for the most promising players under 21, to break into the top 100. Now he had his own money to spend on his career.\nThe next year, he made the quarterfinals of the French Open. Money has never been a concern since. Given the lengthy list of blue-chip endorsement deals, with a combined reported value in the hundreds of millions and nearly $50 million in prize money, it should never be again, assuming he doesn\u2019t lose it all on the golf course to his other coach, Darren Cahill.\nThey play often. Cahill is the far superior golfer, so superior that he allows Vagnozzi and Sinner to team up and gives them a stroke on every hole. Sinner and Vagnozzi also get to play scramble style, which means they play both their balls from the better location on each shot, and record the best score on each hole.\nSinner and Vagnozzi recorded a rare win earlier this month in Mason, Ohio, where the Cincinnati Open is held. Cahill said that whatever grace and composure Sinner usually shows on the tennis court went out the window on the final green of the day, as he danced around with his arms in the air like he\u2019d won The Masters.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt was actually funny,\u201d Sinner says. \u201cI never played like this.\u201d\nNeedless to say, he does not rate himself as much of a golfer. Cahill, who has been playing the game for decades, has been trying to teach him. He describes Sinner as eminently coachable and willing to embrace a change, sometimes even in the middle of a match, though it\u2019s safe to say he\u2019s had more success on the tennis court than the links. He has convinced his charge to embrace a data-driven approach to improving his game.\nCahill was at the forefront of embracing analytics in tennis. He has said it was his not-very-secret weapon when he was helping Lleyton Hewitt, Andre Agassi, and Simona Halep reach the No. 1 ranking.\nHe, Sinner and Vagnozzi embarked on a long-term process of gaining more power on his serve, more topspin on his forehand, and more variety on his backhand. Sinner used to almost always hit his backhand crosscourt. Opponents knew what was coming.\nDuring the past year, he said, Sinner\u2019s ability to pull the trigger on a backhand down the line has been a complete game-changer. They use the data to study opponents, too, with Cahill combing tendencies the evening before a match, then boiling down his findings to a 10 to 15-minute chat.\nBefore a recent match in Cincinnati against the rising Canadian Gabriel Diallo, they noticed that Diallo struggled when opponents returned his second serve from inside the baseline, even when they attacked his forehand, which is Diallo\u2019s strength. Sinner followed the plan and Diallo made error after error on his stronger side\n\u201cIt\u2019s always in the numbers,\u201d Cahill said. \u201cSometimes they just don\u2019t make sense at the time. You have to trust your gut a little bit as a tennis player. You have to be right in the moment.\u201d\nAfter the famous loss to Alcaraz in Paris, Sinner, Vagnozzi and Cahill spoke about how Sinner could have been slightly more courageous in the big moments, even as he and Alcaraz played at a ridiculously high level through the final set and into the sixth hour of the match. Then they moved on.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s tennis, it is a game and you have to enjoy it,\u201d Vagnozzi said. \u201cTo lose in the final like this, to be part of an unbelievable match, was something good in the end. It was not just bad, and for us, the goal is to give the 100 percent that we have.\n\u201cSo we went away from Paris with, not a smile for sure, but we knew that we gave 100 percent, so it was in peace.\u201d\nAnd then they went back to work, preparing for the grass. They focused heavily on raising the quality of Sinner\u2019s running forehand, something Alcaraz exploited throughout the French Open final.\nThat made sense to Sinner, because the grass rewards a big forehand more than the slow clay, the ball sliding through the slick court as Sinner skis down mountains. It worked. Alcaraz kept trying to break the sideline on Sinner\u2019s forehand side and drag him off the court. Sinner responded with crackerjack balls down the line and on sharp angles.\nEven the point in which he conceded the first set, thanks to the absurdly low backhand slice pickup that Alcaraz has made his trademark on the grass, included a running forehand that would have taken most players out of the rally.\n\u201cWe always have to improve because people, they catch up,\u201d Sinner said. \u201cThey know how I play now.\u201d\nThey know how he lives, too. Win or lose, he will be back in Sesto before too long.\n(Top photo: Claudio Lavenia / GC Images)"

      "text": "This story has been updated to reflect Rafael Nadal\u2019s announcement that he will retire from professional tennis in November 2024.\n\u201cHe makes you suffer. First he takes your legs, then your mind.\u201d\nCasper Ruud is describing what it\u2019s like facing Rafael Nadal on Court Philippe-Chatrier at Roland Garros: the court where Nadal has won 14 French Open titles. Ruud was the beaten finalist for the most recent of those triumphs, in 2022. When asked to relive the experience of facing Nadal there, his eyes widen and he lets out a small laugh.\nAdvertisement\nThis was a pretty typical reaction of the dozen-or-so players The Athletic spoke to in an attempt to understand exactly what it\u2019s like playing Nadal on clay \u2014 a surface on which he has a 90.9 percent winning record over a career that has spanned more than two decades. He has won 484 ATP matches on clay, losing just 51.\nAt Roland Garros, that figure is a ludicrous 96.6 percent. Played 116, won 112, lost four.\nThe players we heard from, including Novak Djokovic, almost unanimously described playing Nadal on clay as \u201cthe toughest test in tennis\u201d. Others, like Ruud, went as far as saying it was the toughest test in any sport. \u201cHe is the ultimate clay-court player,\u201d says Gael Monfils, the one-time world No. 6, who has been beaten by Nadal in all six of their meetings on the surface.\nSome players don\u2019t even think it\u2019s real. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like playing against someone on a PlayStation because every ball comes back,\u201d is the view of Karen Khachanov, a two-time French Open quarterfinalist.\nRuud\u2019s words call to mind Andy Roddick\u2019s famous \u201cfirst your legs, then your soul\u201d description of Novak Djokovic, so what exactly makes playing Nadal specifically so terrifying?\nFrom the size of the Chatrier court and the feeling that it\u2019s impossible to get the ball past him, to the heaviness of his ball, to the mental torture he is able to exert, those who have faced him explain exactly what it\u2019s like playing Rafael Nadal on clay.\nLet\u2019s start with the ultimate, ultimate test \u2014 playing Nadal on Chatrier. Since he won his first French Open in 2005 at 19, this has become his court. He knows its dimensions perfectly; he knows how the ball will bounce in any spot; he knows how to inflict the maximum amount of damage on his opponents. Sometimes a player and a court become so intertwined that it feels as though the venue were made for them. Roger Federer and Centre Court, Serena Williams and Arthur Ashe, Djokovic and the Rod Laver Arena.\nAdvertisement\nFirst up, the man who has inflicted half of his defeats on the court and who has played him there more (11 times, including the Olympics) than anyone else \u2014 Djokovic.\n\u201cThe court is bigger,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is more space, which affects visually the play a lot and the feeling of the player on the court. He likes to stand quite far back to return. Sometimes when he\u2019s really in the zone and in the groove, not making many errors, you feel like he\u2019s impenetrable. He\u2019s like a wall.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really a paramount challenge to play him in Roland Garros. He\u2019s an incredible athlete. The tenacity and intensity he brings on the court, particularly there, is something that was very rarely seen I think in the history of this sport.\u201d\nUntil 2024, the only other player to beat Nadal at Roland Garros was Robin Soderling, in 2009.\nIn an interview with this writer for the Daily Telegraph in 2018, he said that aggression was the key.\n\u201cTo beat Rafa on clay, especially in best of five sets you have to be aggressive and dictate the points. That\u2019s how I played naturally so it was maybe a bit easier for me. But I also tried to be a bit more aggressive than normal and also take a few more risks,\u201d he said.\nSoderling won 6-2, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, staving off Nadal\u2019s winning the second set. It was one of the biggest results in recent tennis history, and nine years on, Soderling suggested that other, higher-ranked players than him were too cowed by Nadal\u2019s presence.\n\u201cI get the feeling even guys in the top five don\u2019t really believe. They\u2019re there to see what happens. Their focus is just to go off the court with their head high,\u201d he said.\nRuud, who is a clay-court specialist and has been ranked as high as No. 2, was thumped in straight sets in the Roland Garros final against Nadal two years ago. \u201cHe reads the game so well, as well as him being one of the best movers of all time.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n\u201cIt\u2019s like Novak said, winners don\u2019t come easy against him on Chatrier,\u201d he added.\nTo reach that final, Nadal beat Alexander Zverev in the semifinal. In a very strange match with lots of breaks, Zverev had to retire with an unfortunate ankle injury in the second set while trailing 6-7, 6-6. He had somehow failed to win the first set, despite holding four consecutive set points, and the way he talks about it now underlines how much the match has stayed with him. The way he describes Nadal conjures up the image of trying to escape from the Terminator in the classic Arnold Schwarzenegger film.\n\u201cHe becomes different,\u201d says Zverev, who has lost five of his seven matches against Nadal on clay. \u201cHis ball all of a sudden becomes a few kilometres an hour faster. His footwork and foot speed become a lot faster.\n\u201cIt\u2019s more difficult to hit a winner, especially on Philippe Chatrier, which is a massive court, so he has a lot more space. It is very difficult. It\u2019s probably the biggest challenge in tennis playing Nadal on that court.\n\u201cYou have a feeling that you just can\u2019t put him away. I think the first set that I played against him (in that 2022 semifinal) basically describes it to perfection. I mean, I won that set I don\u2019t know how many times against any other player and I still somehow managed to lose it in the tie-break.\n\u201cI was up 6-2 in the tie-break. He aced me I think for the first time in the entire match. Then he hit one of the most ridiculous passing shots I\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life.\n\u201cSomehow you feel like you\u2019re winning, but then somehow you end up not. It\u2019s just something you only feel against him on that specific court.\u201d\nZverev did finally get his Roland Garros win against Nadal, beating him on Court Philippe-Chatrier in the first round of the 2024 tournament \u2014 Nadal\u2019s last French Open.\nGO DEEPER\nAlexander Zverev keeps winning. But nobody wants to talk about his domestic abuse trial\nSebastian Korda, America\u2019s world No. 19, won just four games when he faced Nadal on Chatrier four years ago, losing 6-1, 6-1, 6-2 in a fourth-round shellacking. He feels Nadal\u2019s comfort and experience on the court adds to the feeling for opponents that no situation could unsettle him there.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe\u2019s as comfortable as someone can be on a tennis court and once someone gets comfortable on a court, it becomes extremely difficult to play them,\u201d Korda says.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been through pretty much every situation on that court so plays as free as anyone can on a court.\n\u201cYou feel like you can\u2019t get the ball past him.\u201d\nKhachanov, the big-hitting Russian world No. 25, was thumped by Nadal 6-3, 6-2 in their only meeting on clay \u2014 in Monte Carlo six years ago.\n\u201cIt was a bit like playing against someone on a PlayStation because every ball comes back,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes you have trouble winning one point. And you can feel like you do everything right and you don\u2019t win the point.\n\u201cYou serve well and open the angle, the ball comes back. That\u2019s why he\u2019s unique and the best ever to play on that surface.\u201d\nThe feeling that whatever you do isn\u2019t enough ties into Ruud\u2019s description that \u201cfirst he takes your legs and then your mind\u201d.\nThere\u2019s worrying about what to do when you\u2019re hitting the ball. There\u2019s the growing sense that whatever you do, it won\u2019t be enough.\nThen there\u2019s the fact that for every ball you hit, Nadal\u2019s ball is about to come for you.\nHis ball on clay is known to be so full of spin that players struggle to comprehend it until they experience it first-hand. This can be quantified to some extent by looking at the extremely high revolutions per minute on Nadal\u2019s shots, especially the forehand, but even that doesn\u2019t fully do it justice, his opponents say.\n\u201cHis ball? It\u2019s\u2026 heavy,\u201d says Ruud, who was also the French Open runner-up in 2023. \u201cAnd I think if you haven\u2019t played tennis yourself it\u2019s maybe hard to know what heavy means. I guess it\u2019s the spin and rotation of his ball. The more RPMs he has on his ball, the quicker it will bounce up towards you. And when the ball bounces up at you, the more RPMs it has, the heavier it comes up at you compared to a ball that\u2019s coming at you really flat.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHe has mastered that more than anyone else.\u201d\nWorld No. 55 Miomir Kecmanovic lost to Nadal in straight sets in Madrid a couple of years ago and says: \u201cHis ball was different. Different in the way you know it\u2019s Rafa behind the ball. Sometimes even if it\u2019s not as good you still feel the pressure because you know it\u2019s him. It\u2019s completely different when you play him.\u201d\nKhachanov says it\u2019s the variety of Nadal\u2019s ball when playing him on clay that really struck him. \u201cIt\u2019s always different,\u201d Khachanov says. \u201cHe finds different angles, different trajectories, he always pushes you back when he opens the court. He has so much variety and the ball speed. So whenever he wants to be aggressive, he goes aggressive, and if he wants to be more defensive, he can take a step back. It\u2019s like chess tennis \u2014 with the pieces, the shots he has in his arsenal. He is always trying to make you have trouble.\u201d\n- If you\u2019d like to follow our fantastic tennis coverage, please click here.\nSuch a kind person off the court, there\u2019s no doubt that Nadal has a sadistic streak on it. He seeks out opponents\u2019 weaknesses and exploits them mercilessly \u2014 especially on clay, where the high bounces suit the violent topspin he puts on the ball. Roger Federer could be forgiven for still having nightmares about those French Open finals when Nadal would loop topspin forehands to force him to hit one-handed backhands from shoulder height again and again.\nThe punishment was so severe that Federer eventually remodelled the entire shot.\nGrigor Dimitrov, the world No 10 and three-time Grand Slam semi-finalist, is another gifted shotmaker with a single-handed backhand. He has faced Nadal six times on clay and lost all six meetings \u2014 winning just one set in the process.\nHe recalls Nadal making his life as awkward as possible. \u201cIt was no fun. No fun at all,\u201d Dimitrov says.\n\u201cI played him at his absolute peak on clay and how can I explain? It\u2019s just very uncomfortable. It\u2019s very difficult for a one-hander to play him on any surface, but clay especially. The direction on the ball is very different. You have to move a bit extra. You can\u2019t make any cheap mistakes. Overall there\u2019s so little margin for error and then if you can\u2019t put him in an uncomfortable position, there\u2019s not a lot you can do.\u201d\nOne of Nadal\u2019s characteristics is that he never takes things for granted. No matter the opponent or the event, he will always show every match the utmost respect. Part of that is properly researching his opponents and knowing how to exploit any holes in their game.\nAdvertisement\nThat was the impression that Zizou Bergs, the world No. 73, had when he was beaten by Nadal in Rome earlier in 2024. \u201cHe was hitting such a high ball with lots of spin,\u201d Bergs says. \u201cPlaying my weaknesses. You can tell his team did their homework on me, on what I don\u2019t like.\n\u201cThe intensity he can give sometimes with his forehand and backhand, it\u2019s brutal.\u201d\nThe feeling of being put under relentless pressure is draining and eventually, it becomes overwhelming. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult physically, tactically to handle his speed, his angle, the way he puts you under pressure,\u201d says Monfils.\nCorentin Moutet, the world No. 72, played Nadal at the French Open two years ago. He shakes his head as he remembers trying to reconcile the fact he felt he gave a good account of himself but still lost in straight sets. \u201cI played well that day,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd left the court thinking I\u2019ve played a really good level here but it\u2019s still not enough.\u201d\nOne of the biggest challenges about playing Nadal on clay is the mental aspect. Trying to go into the match not fearing what is about to come.\nAnd playing Nadal on Chatrier can do strange things to people. Ahead of their first-round match at Roland Garros five years ago, the German player Yannick Hanfmann was so frazzled that after the customary photo at the net, he stuck his hand out to Nadal as if it was the end of the match. A slightly bemused Nadal didn\u2019t leave him hanging and politely shook it.\n\u201cThat was weird. I don\u2019t know what I was doing, to be honest. I was a bit out of it there,\u201d Hanfmann said afterwards. \u201cI saw him shaking this kid\u2019s hand and the ref\u2019s hand and I then stuck out my hand. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d\nThis is an extreme example, but there\u2019s no denying that players struggle not to be overawed by the prospect of facing Nadal on clay.\n\u201cI think the fear shouldn\u2019t be a factor,\u201d Dimitrov says. \u201cBut the way certain players are, and him on clay, with a 97 percent winning percentage, it\u2019s already difficult enough. But I think the mindset is really important. You have to really believe that you can play well enough to have a chance.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nAs time has gone on, there\u2019s also the challenge that many players who face Nadal grew up idolising him. How do you switch off the part of your brain that is so full of admiration for him and listen only to the one that tells you you need to go and, metaphorically speaking, kick the living daylights out of him?\n\u201cIt\u2019s about being out there, having tonnes of respect for Rafael Nadal, but also seeing him as your opponent you want to beat and not just want to play,\u201d says Bergs, who led Nadal by a set in Rome before succumbing in three.\n\u201cSometimes you lose because you don\u2019t really believe.\u201d\nRuud was one of the players who grew up with Nadal as their childhood hero and then trained at the Spaniard\u2019s academy. There was a feeling that he was overawed by facing Nadal in their final in 2022, which ended with a one-sided 6-3, 6-3, 6-0 scoreline and was happy enough just to be there.\n\u201cOf course, I wish I could make the match closer and all these things,\u201d he said afterwards. \u201cBut at the end of the day, I can hopefully one day tell my grandkids that I played Rafa on Chatrier in the final.\n\u201cI\u2019m probably going to enjoy this moment for a long time.\u201d\nKorda had a similar situation when he faced Nadal at Roland Garros in 2020, describing him as his \u201cidol\u201d in the lead-up to the match and having named the family cat after him growing up. Korda admits it was strange playing him in Paris having watched thousands of his matches growing up. \u201cHe was my favourite player, so nothing really surprised me,\u201d Korda says. \u201cBut it still felt pretty strange seeing him on the other side of the net.\u201d\nEven older, more experienced players, confess that at times they had to grapple with the feeling of being honoured to share the Chatrier court with Nadal.\nFabio Fognini, 37 now, was a top-10 player and clay-court specialist. He has played Nadal eight times on clay, winning three of those meetings \u2013 including the most recent one, a 6-4, 6-2 hiding in Monte Carlo five years ago.\nAdvertisement\nBut he admits that during their one meeting at Roland Garros, he was too happy just to be there. Nadal won the match \u2014 a third-round contest in 2013 \u2013 7-6, 6-4, 6-4. \u201cI\u2019m happy I was one of the 1,000 players who got to play at the same time as them,\u201d he says. \u201cBeing in the second week of a grand slam was a party for me.\n\u201cI played with all three and Andy. I played Rafa at Roland Garros, Roger at Wimbledon, Nole (Djokovic) in Australia, Andy at Wimbledon. They were all incredibly tough.\u201d\nWhen the then-37-year-old Nadal battled to compete at one last French Open, it felt as though we had come full circle. With the announcement of his tennis retirement, that is confirmed.\nNadal\u2019s biggest opponent since his 14th title two years ago has always been his creaking body, which forced him to miss the 2023 French Open. His last Grand Slam appearance would, however, be in Paris, ending in that first-round defeat to Zverev.\nNadal finally has some insight into what his opponents have faced all these years. The doubts and fears that consume them. How tough has that been, suddenly having to manage your vulnerability? \u201cYeah, it\u2019s tough,\u201d he told The Athletic in Rome earlier this year, where he exited the Italian Open early to Hubert Hurkacz. \u201cBecause I have to do the things very step by step, trying to make small improvements day by day.\n\u201cI need to try to play at my hundred percent. It\u2019s not easy because I need to lose a little bit of fear that I have in some shots, for example.\u201d\nBeating Nadal at Roland Garros was for so long been the toughest task in tennis, possibly any sport. But in his return from injury in 2024, Nadal\u2019s physical issues meant he was nowhere near as formidable on the surface as he once was when Zverev dispatched him in three close and valedictory sets. Would a fitter, stronger Nadal have won that match? It\u2019s impossible to know. But perhaps it\u2019s fitting that the only person who has properly got the better of Nadal on clay is Rafael Nadal himself.\n(Top photos: Left and right: Mike Hewitt; centre: Mateo Villalba/Getty Images; design: Dan Goldfarb )"

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of the 2025 U.S. Open\nWelcome to the U.S. Open briefing, where The Athletic will explain the stories behind the stories on each day of the tournament.\nOn Day 4, Carlos Alcaraz vanquished bad memories, the city\u2019s tennis diasporas turned out and perhaps the best sports photo of the year came to the fore.\nCarlos Alcaraz vanquishes demons of last year\nA year on, Carlos Alcaraz\u2019s second-round U.S. Open loss to Botic van de Zandschulp looks like the most overindexed result in the sport.\nAdvertisement\nAt the same stage of this year\u2019s competition, Alcaraz posted a performance and result Wednesday night far more illustrative of who he is as a player. He destroyed Italy\u2019s Mattia Bellucci 6-1, 6-0, 6-3 to set up a third-round meeting with No. 32 seed Luciano Darderi, delivering a display at odds with the alleged flakiness and inconsistency with which the Van de Zandschulp match has become synonymous.\nIn reality, that defeat last year was an anomaly: the only time in 11 Grand Slams that Alcaraz has failed to reach the quarterfinals, against the backdrop of his mentally and physically exhausting defeat to Novak Djokovic in the Paris Olympics\u2019 gold-medal match three weeks earlier. Alcaraz\u2019s tennis can be volatile during matches, but he is now 31-1 in his last 32.\nAfter routing the world No. 65, he spoke of the impact of last year\u2019s upset on his tournament this year. He admitted that he had thought more about his shock exit to Van de Zandschulp than his U.S. Open title win in 2022, and added: \u201cI thought about last year when I stepped on the court. Some bad thoughts. I was nervous about it, like thinking: \u2018OK, I don\u2019t want to do the same thing as I did last year, losing in the second round.\u2019\n\u201cI wanted just to improve from the experience. I think when I lost in the second round last year, it was one of those moments when I learned a lot how to deal with some situations, how should I have done things much better. I think I\u2019ve just done it this year much, much better.\u201d\nThe confidence and energy that coursed through Alcaraz last night underlined how the win could not have been in starker contrast to that monumental, if overindexed, defeat a year ago.\nCharlie Eccleshare\nRising tennis stars bring their fans from all over New York City\nAfter three wins in the first round, three rising Southeast Asian tennis nations prepared to bring their support to the Billie Jean King Tennis Center from all over New York City once again.\nAdvertisement\nAnd while Wednesday did not extend the runs of Janice Tjen of Indonesia and Alex Eala of the Philippines, the diaspora populations concentrated in the city\u2019s nearby Elmhurst and Woodside neighborhoods respectively once again came out to support the players making history for their countries. Tjen lost handily to Emma Raducanu of Great Britain, who beat her 6-2, 6-1, jumping on anything remotely short and crowding Tjen on her backhand side to stop her from unleashing her heavy inside-out forehand. The 2021 U.S. Open champion was simply too much for Tjen, who upset No. 24 seed Veronika Kudermatova in the first round and has won 100 of her last 113 matches on the third tier of professional tennis. She\u2019s also the first Indonesian player to win a main-draw match at a Grand Slam since 2004.\nThen it was Eala\u2019s turn to carry the torch for the Philippines again, having made tennis history for her archipelago most of the past year. But she ran into Cristina Bus\u00e7a of Spain, who beat her 6-4, 6-3. Eala had some chances to draw even in the second set, but couldn\u2019t find enough consistency. Still, her win in the first round over the No. 14 seed Clara Tauson, a wild match decided by a third-set tiebreak that Eala won 13-11, made her the first Filipino player to win a Grand Slam match in the modern era of tennis, which goes back more than 50 years.\nColeman Wong of Hong Kong is last to go. A close friend of Eala\u2019s from the Rafael Nadal Academy in Mallorca, Spain, Wong plays Adam Walton of Australia Thursday, having beaten Aleks Kovacevic of the U.S. in the first round.\nMatt Futterman\nThe subject and snapper of the best photo in sports this year meet\nTennis photographs more beautifully than many sports. The athleticism, the ball on the strings, the back and forth of the players.\nBut one of the sports pictures of the year so far has nothing to do with any of that.\nAdvertisement\nNo. 7 seed Jasmine Paolini\u2019s first-round match against Destanee Aiava of Australia was a fairly straightforward win for the Italian, who last year made two Grand Slam finals and has held steady in the top 10 in 2025. But it produced a split-second alignment of player and racket so perfect that it defied belief. So perfect that capturing it was on the verge of improbable.\nStep forward, Ray Giubilo, who delivered a work of art:\nView this post on Instagram\nThe photo went around the internet.

      "text": "FLUSHING, N.Y. \u2014 In late summer, professional tennis lands in opposite world in New York City.\nDon\u2019t go looking for hushed tones, decorous silence or the other traditions of a sport whose roots exist on the hallowed lawns of polite society. At the U.S. Open, music blares from speakers. A near-constant buzz rises from every crowd, interrupted only by bursts of exuberance. Trains rumble behind the main stadiums, Arthur Ashe and Louis Armstrong, while planes approaching and departing from La Guardia Airport bring their stomach-churning roars.\nAdvertisement\nThe Billie Jean King Tennis Center opens for business and a lot of basic tennis etiquette takes a break. This is an amped-up, raucous version of the sport.\nOn day one of the 2025 tournament, 2021 champion Daniil Medvedev provided a signal example by inciting the crowd to delay his match against France\u2019s Benjamin Bonzi for six minutes \u2014 while he was down match point. A photographer walked onto the court between Bonzi\u2019s first and second serves. Umpire Greg Allensworth ruled that Bonzi should get a first serve. Irate, Medvedev approached Allensworth\u2019s chair, whipping up the crowd to boo and chant. After berating Allensworth, Medvedev returned to the baseline. Bonzi got ready to serve. The crowd didn\u2019t stop.\nThis was extreme. But all the players know that they are in for a ride.\n\u201cYou know if you\u2019re playing on Ashe it\u2019s going to be loud, especially a night match,\u201d said Madison Keys, the Australian Open champion. It\u2019s so loud that she often can\u2019t hear her coaches, or the sound of the ball off the opponent\u2019s strings, which is a key cue for players at the elite level. \u201cYou have to learn sign language pretty quickly, and sometimes you fail.\u201d\nWhen night gives way to day, the sun continues to rise and the sport goes on. The world gets a glimpse of what some players wish tennis would be all the time: a noisy rumble that looks a lot more like basically every other sport, in which self-expression, celebration and trash talk are welcomed as entertainment enhancements rather than affronts to common decency. Most of the majors have made small adjustments, like music at changeovers, light shows at night, and letting crowds move more freely, especially higher up in larger stadiums. But needle and drama remain unembraced, even when they are taken as normal in the hyper-competitive world of other elite sports.\nAdvertisement\nThat is especially true for Americans, who get celebrated in New York more than anyone else. They\u2019ve grown up watching the NBA and the NFL and even baseball, where jawing and showboating are pro forma. They are not really sure why they have to behave like they are at a funeral.\n\u201cI understand respect and respecting your opponents and the traditions of tennis,\u201d said Ben Shelton, who has become a crowd favorite across the globe for his big-time game and exuberance to match, after opening the tournament for 2025 on the biggest stage in tennis.\n\u201cAt the same time, I think that people get called out for little things or the wrong things. It\u2019s like: \u2018Really? We\u2019re going to give someone a hard time about that?\u2019\n\u201cHaving a simple conversation with somebody, is, like, looked down upon.\u201d\nShelton has no shortage of company.\n\u201cI personally have always been on the side of the rules should be more lax towards letting players express themselves on the court because I think it adds more excitement, more things happen,\u201d said Taylor Fritz, a finalist here last year.\nFritz, who rode a sufficiently raucous crowd on Louis Armstrong Stadium to a first-round win over compatriot Emilio Nava, doesn\u2019t understand why players get fined for breaking a racket, as long as they don\u2019t endanger anyone else.\n\u201cEven if some people don\u2019t like it, it still sparks a reaction and more eyes. Most people break a racket and hand it to a kid and it makes a kid\u2019s year probably. We should move more in that direction, as much in that direction as we can while still keeping the core principles of tennis the same.\u201d\nTaylor Townsend told Jelena Ostapenko, the Latvian world No. 26, that she doesn\u2019t need to apologize for a net cord \u2014 when a shot hits the top of the net but stays in play \u2014 after beating Ostapenko 7-5, 6-1 in the second round.\nAdvertisement\nOstapenko responded by appearing to tell Townsend that she has \u201cno education,\u201d before issuing a statement on social media that said that Townsend had been \u201cvery disrespectful\u201d and that \u201cif she plays in her homeland it doesn\u2019t mean that she can behave and do whatever she wants.\u201d\nIn an on-court interview with ESPN, Townsend alleged that Ostapenko also said that she has \u201cno class,\u201d and commented on what would happen if they played outside the U.S. Townsend recalled that she had beaten Townsend in Canada, which is outside the U.S.\nIn tennis, as in other sports, the tension between old standards and new approaches can emerge as one generation takes the spotlight from another and a sport becomes more diverse. Baseball worked through its behavioral debate during the past decade, as a new generation of players brought an exuberance and some pretty fun post-home run bat flipping to the game that so-called traditionalists found disrespectful. The NFL, long known as a the \u201cNo Fun League,\u201d finally loosened its rules about touchdown celebrations eight years ago, though taunts and violent gestures can garner unsportsmanlike conduct penalties.\nIf there is one place that most tennis players will draw a line, it\u2019s noise during points. At the top level, the noise of racket on ball is a crucial indicator of the speed, spin and depth with which it will approach. Taking away that cue makes playing much more difficult.\nStill, something of an evolution is taking place, with the pressure to adopt courtliness on the wane. Medvedev, the demonstrative and colorful Russian, has been waiting for this moment for nearly a decade, though what he delivered Sunday night into Monday morning \u2014 including questioning Allensworth over whether he was \u201ca man,\u201d crossed the line. Bonzi said that the Russian \u201cput oil on the fire.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m getting a big fine,\u201d Medvedev said in a news conference after a five-set defeat that would likely have been a three-set one without his intervention. In the end he was fined $42,500.\nStill, the distinction between basic etiquette and what might be considered showboating or taunting can shift from week to week and tournament to tournament, depending on the locale. The Australian Open has the air of a festival. The French Open crowd is famously touchy, especially when one of their own is involved. Then there\u2019s Wimbledon, where the most frequent noise is likely to be a \u201cssshhhhh\u201d rippling across Centre Court when someone yells out of turn.\nAdvertisement\nThat principle of change according to context goes for fans, too. As Alex Eala got on her way to making more history for the Philippines by beating No. 14 seed Clara Tauson, the huge Filipino diaspora, concentrated just a few minutes away by train in Woodside, Queens, backed its woman to the hilt. The Filipino fans cheered her every move. They cheered Tauson\u2019s every error. The Dane, frazzled and exasperated, let Eala back in from 5-1 down in the third set, before the archipelago\u2019s new sporting hero won the deciding tiebreak 13-11.\nIn New York, just about anything goes.\n\u201cYou can definitely go for it, get the crowd involved,\u201d said Emma Raducanu, who rode the love through qualifying and all the way to the title four years ago, in her news conference.\n\u201cThe crowd love it if you\u2019re getting pumped and celebrating a lot.\u201d\nSometimes, players learn they\u2019re taking things too far. Shelton is plenty familiar with that.\nHe is a product of college tennis, an atmosphere that is as rowdy as it gets in the sport, in which no amount of fist-pumps or celebratory screams are considered over the top. Even now, three years removed from that college career, he only holds back so much.\nThere are moments in just about every match Shelton plays that he does something ridiculous, whipping the crowd into a frenzy. Sunday, it was a running forehand around the net post late in the second set that got it going. He twirled his index finger right around his ear, signaling the crowd to give him a little more. The 20,000-or-so fans in the biggest stadium in tennis more than obliged.\n\u201cI think I\u2019m an entertainer at heart,\u201d Shelton said ahead of the tournament. \u201cI\u2019m never going to be the guy who just, like, is able to robotically go about my business and not change expression or show any emotion. I think that I play better when I do show some emotion.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nHe\u2019s still learning where the sweet spot is. Just two years ago, during his first run to a Grand Slam semifinal, Shelton\u2019s post-match celebration included hanging up the phone on his beaten opponent.\nWhen Novak Djokovic beat him in straight sets to end what was an upstart run, he hung up the phone right back, sending the message that Shelton had crossed a line between celebrating and showing up an opponent. Shelton gave him a death stare at the net during the handshake and said afterward that he believed players should be free to celebrate however they want.\nHe has not hung up the phone since, though sometimes he can\u2019t resist letting out a high-decibel \u201cYEAH\u201d when an opponent sends a ball out or into the net during a key rally. Most players largely celebrate their own successes, rather than their opponents\u2019 errors, and antics like those supposedly violate the sport\u2019s unwritten behavioral codes.\nAndrea Vavassori, one half of the U.S. Open mixed doubles champions with Sara Errani, scolded Shelton for hitting him with a close-range shot early in a men\u2019s doubles match this spring, though the shot was completely legitimate.\n\u201cSo soft,\u201d Shelton was heard saying to his partner Rohan Bopanna as they gathered their gear after beating Vavassori and his partner Simone Bolelli.\nShelton had a disagreement with Flavio Cobolli over a gesture the Italian made toward the end of their three-set semifinal in Toronto earlier this month. Shelton, who is 6 feet 4 inches, with the chiseled physique of a prize fighter, was shirtless as they talked things out. He stood up, moved in close with his arms crossed, putting Cobolli\u2019s eyes about even with his chin.\nIt was the sort of face-off that happens multiple times in every NFL game. But because it was tennis, it became a social media moment that zipped around the internet, with some debate about whether Shelton crossed some nebulous celebratory line with his emotions.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cHaving a younger crowd in tennis is really important in attracting younger fans, the future fans of our sport,\u201d he said. \u201cThe kids love the flair and the excitement and the competition.\u201d\nBut both Shelton and Cobolli quickly attempted to stifle any potential fallout from the incident, defaulting to decorum as fast as they could. They insisted they had settled the matter in the locker room and didn\u2019t want to talk about it any more. That\u2019s the way things are supposed to happen in this sport.\nIt was not so dissimilar from the events following the French Open women\u2019s final, when Aryna Sabalenka dissed Coco Gauff in defeat after Gauff came back to beat her in three sets. Sabalenka blamed the conditions and herself, saying that Gauff hadn\u2019t won \u2014 she lost. Gauff took some issue with this, but with the title in hand, she didn\u2019t need to be too bothered.\nSabalenka posted an apology within days, after bearing the brunt of a major, understandable backlash. By the time they showed up at Wimbledon, a peacemaking effort was underway. They filmed a TikTok dance video on Centre Court, to prove they buried the hatchet. But then Wimbledon itself promoted the video, because in tennis peace must prevail, even if sporting rivalries so often benefit from some genuine needle.\nNow contrast those events with the eye-catching confrontation between Noah Lyles and Kenny Bednarek at last month\u2019s U.S. Track and Field Championships. Lyles stared down Bednarek as he crossed the finish line of the 200 meters, ahead of his rival. Bednarek didn\u2019t like it and gave Lyles a shove as they slowed down. There were words, and for a couple of days fans and non-fans alike were talking about nothing else.\n\u201cBonkers,\u201d Frances Tiafoe, America\u2019s top tennis showman, said of the incident.\nBut athletics didn\u2019t tie itself in knots trying to produce a detente. The two are due to face each other in September at the World Track and Field Championships in Tokyo. The sport\u2019s leaders and everyone who follows it can\u2019t wait, including Shelton, who is a track nut.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cSomething is on the line and everyone is tuning in,\u201d Shelton said.\nIt\u2019s exactly the sort of stuff that Tiafoe said he\u2019d like to see more of in tennis, rather than the automatic reversion to the unwritten codes of this supposed genteel game. He\u2019d like to act that way himself at the end of some matches.\n\u201cI\u2019d love to be like, \u2018I don\u2019t like you,\u2019\u201d he said ahead of the tournament, where he has become a master of leading the crowd on Arthur Ashe like a conductor guiding an orchestra. \u201cI wish there was a lot more of that, because, I mean, like you lose a tough match. \u2018Oh, man, I\u2019m so happy for you.\u2019\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re not. Like, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re just not.\u201d\nTiafoe, an obsessive NBA and NFL fan, watches his comrades trash talk their way through game after game and wishes tennis could be that way. It might even be good for business. The NBA and the NFL are pretty successful entities. Still, he doesn\u2019t have high hopes for the scrapping of more than a century of decorum. A fortnight of sound and fury in New York will have to do. Thanks to Medvedev, the festivities started early.\n(Top photo: Angela Weiss / Getty Images)"

      "text": "This article is part of our New York Court Classics series, a special feature produced by The Athletic looking back at classic U.S. Open performances, iconic athletes and timeless moments.\nThe Athletic has live coverage of the 2025 U.S. Open\nFLUSHING MEADOWS, N.Y. \u2014 James Scott Connors, the battler from Belleville, Ill., won eight Grand Slam titles during a 24-year career.\nAdvertisement\nHe is a five-time U.S. Open champion, a two-time Wimbledon champion, and a leading man of the first golden age of professional tennis in the 1970s and 1980s.\nJust don\u2019t look for him at the tennis \u201cStar Wars\u201d bar that every Grand Slam turns into, with old legends of the sport all over the grounds. They are in front of television cameras and behind the closed doors of corporate suites, where they receive generous checks for popping in, shaking some hands and telling some stories, before heading off to the next appearance.\nLet them have their fun and their appearance fees. Connors will keep his distance. His relationships with them were always a little spicy. Connors, known to the world as Jimmy and now 72, called his memoir \u201cThe Outsider,\u201d so maybe staying away is for the best. His two artificial hips, one of which required a second surgery, and his wife of 47 years, Patti, are happy to stay at home near Santa Barbara.\nHe golfs with a regular bunch of buddies, plays tennis several times a week and does a podcast with his son, Brett. They talk about the worlds of tennis and gambling. He\u2019s made some good investments. Money is not of concern. Getting to choose how to spend his time is his reward.\nConnors, who was, is and surely will be full of surprises for the rest of his life, saved his biggest one for his home major. Even with all those Grand Slam titles, and his record 109 tour titles, Connors may be best known for a fourth-round match he played on Louis Armstrong Stadium at the U.S. Open, on Labor Day in 1991. He woke up on his 39th birthday in the last 16 of his favorite tournament, a supposedly over-the-hill legend of the sport engaging in one of his last dances at his home Slam.\nIt\u2019s the match that U.S. Open broadcasters used to show during rain delays, back before the advent of roofs at Grand Slams made their virtual storage closet of classic matches obsolete.\nAdvertisement\nConnors had undergone wrist surgery less than a year before. He entered the U.S. Open as a wild card, ranked No. 174. He was facing Aaron Krickstein, a once and future top-10 player 14 years his junior. Krickstein, 24, was in his athletic prime and on his way back to the top of the sport. The first week had been brutally hot, sapping players far younger than Connors of their energy, leaving them depleted ahead of the business end of the tournament.\nSomeone forgot to mention all that to Connors. The crotch-grabbing exhibitionist, whose profane tirades rubbed much of the tennis establishment the wrong way, was never much for following conventional wisdom.\nKrickstein didn\u2019t know what to think of the matchup. He\u2019d never beaten Connors, winless in five tries. He\u2019d played Connors two months before at Wimbledon. Connors had dumped him in three sets, 6-3, 6-2, 6-3.\nUnlike a lot of players on the tour, Krickstein liked Connors. They had known each other for nearly a decade; they were friends. Krickstein didn\u2019t really like playing against his friends. Especially this one, who could act like his soulmate off the court before transforming into the most mercilessly vindictive soul on the planet once the first ball went over the net. He would make the crowd despise his foes. He would bully the umpires and linesmen into what looked like makeup calls. If fans got so riled up that they started to yell through every shot, he would not stop them.\nStill, this was Krickstein\u2019s favorite tournament, too. It was the site of his 1983 breakout run to the fourth round, when he was just 16. There, he produced an epic comeback from two sets down to defeat Vitas Gerulaitis, a hometown favorite and matinee star of the era with his flowing blond hair and Studio 54 personality.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason that Aaron Krickstein at 24 shouldn\u2019t beat 39-year-old Jimmy Connors if I can stay mentally focused and play up to my standards,\u201d Krickstein said during an interview this summer from Florida, where he is the director of tennis at the St. Andrews Country Club in Boca Raton.\nAdvertisement\nAs match day approached, he figured the New York summer heat would give him an assist and prove too much for his opponent, given the scorchers they had been living through.\n\u201cAnd then of course Labor Day was nice and cool and no humidity,\u201d Krickstein said.\nStill, when the match started, Krickstein felt like it was going according to his plan. It was a day match. They played the first set while much of the crowd was eating lunch. Krickstein did what he had to do, keeping Connors back, winning the longer rallies, not offering much to get excited about. He won it 6-3.\nThen Connors started to find his rhythm, lacing balls across the net and charging in behind them to finish points. He surged to a 5-1 lead in the second set, only to lose it as Krickstein pushed proceedings into a tiebreak. At 7-7, Connors cracked an overhead that appeared to nick the sideline. The line judge called it in. The chair umpire, David Littlefield, overruled him. Krickstein\u2019s meticulously constructed bulwark against any kind of chaos had collapsed.\nConnors rushed the chair. The crowd howled. Littlefield told Connors the ball was clearly out, even though he was on the opposite side of the court. Connors unleashed, pointing at Littlefield, taunting him, calling him a bum and likely some obscenities, inaudible through the din. Connors told Littlefield that he couldn\u2019t see balls beneath his feet, much less across the court. Littlefield sat silently atop the chair like a stoic.\nThe howls went on and on. Connors relished all of it. He won the next point with a stinging volley and pointed at Littlefield. Two points later, the match was even.\n\u201cThat was the start of a crazy match,\u201d Krickstein said. \u201cWho knows if I pulled that out or we didn\u2019t have that altercation or him screaming at the umpire \u2026 I would have been up two sets.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cProbably history would be a lot different.\u201d\nIronically, Krickstein reset and cruised through the next set 6-1 before letting Connors back into the match in the fourth set. Littlefied overruled another call, and Connors unleashed once more, calling him \u201can abortion.\u201d More stoicism from Littlefield. No penalties.\nKrickstein grabbed a 5-2 lead in the fifth set, and that\u2019s when Connors hit the afterburners. Suddenly, he started sprinting across the court, catching up with balls that a 29-year-old might struggle to get, much less someone a decade older than that.\nNow the crowd was really going. Krickstein remembers serving for the match and pushing an easy forehand approach off of a low, chipped drop shot beyond the baseline. The errors started piling up. The crowd got louder with every point Connors won, even on some of the Krickstein errors.\nKrickstein had been in hostile environments before. He often performed well in them. This one was different.\n\u201cI was kind of in a fog in the last four to five, six games,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t able to really focus like I normally do in those pressure situations at the end of a match.\u201d\nHe noticed Connors stalling between points to regain his wind. He thought about complaining, but figured it would make things worse. There was no way Littlefield was going to default Connors in front of his baying faithful.\n\u201cThey would have burned the place down,\u201d Krickstein said.\nOn match point, Connors got into the net and stabbed a backhand volley into the open court. He raised his arms and pumped his fists, pointing at every side of the stadium. After four hours and 41 minutes of tennis, his work for the holiday was done.\nFor Connors, whose run ended in the semifinals with a three-set defeat to Jim Courier, it was the last great win of a great career. He would play one more season, and beat Krickstein one more time before retiring at the end of 1992.\nFollowing that Labor Day barnburner, the two men did not speak for 23 years.\nConnors declined to be interviewed for this story. Brett Connors, a producer with Tennis Channel, said his dad \u2014 \u201cPops\u201d to his son \u2014 wasn\u2019t crazy about some things that were written about him in recent years, so he decided just not to talk publicly anymore. It\u2019s a source of some frustration to Brett, who feels like his father doesn\u2019t get his due in the tennis pantheon, perhaps because he\u2019s not sitting behind a television desk, handing out trophies or glad-handing and working the celebrity appearance circuit.\nAdvertisement\nConnors plans to come to New York with a friend around the final days of this year\u2019s U.S. Open, mostly to visit the city and have some dinners with his son. He plans to fly back on the early side of Sunday, Sept. 7, the day of the men\u2019s singles final.\nWill Pops visit the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center?\n\u201cTruth be told, I wish he would,\u201d Brett said. \u201cI\u2019d like him to get his due.\u201d\nJimmy did do a little television work in retirement. It was fine. He coached Andy Roddick for a little while. He liked that. There were also limited stints with Maria Sharapova and Eugenie Bouchard.\nBrett said his father still loves the game and the life it gave him. But Jimmy also learned early, after a series of losses to his buddy Ilie N\u0103stase, that he couldn\u2019t be friends with guys he needed to beat. So he wasn\u2019t. Not with John McEnroe, not with Bj\u00f6rn Borg and not with Ivan Lendl. Gerulaitis, who uttered the famous \u201cnobody beats Vitas Gerulaitis 17 times in a row\u201d quote after breaking a long losing streak to Connors, was a friend. Eddie Dibbs, a solid pro nowhere near Connors\u2019 level, remains a buddy to this day.\n\u201cThey talk all the time,\u201d Brett said. \u201cHe loves Dibbs.\u201d\nAs for everyone else, they do their thing, lapping up the attention four times a year. Jimmy does his. Until recently, many of his old trophies and other baubles had been in a storage unit in Illinois since his mother died 18 years ago. Brett said that when they retrieved them not so long ago, his father tossed much of it in the trash, especially the runner-up ones.\nKrickstein and Connors, meanwhile, reunited in 2015. Krickstein invited Connors down to his club in Florida for a fundraising exhibition \u2013 a reunion match, so to speak. Given that Krickstein might be best known as the guy who lost to Connors in that epic, he obliged, despite having two artificial hips.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cI kept the balls pretty much in the center, but he was still playing well,\u201d Krickstein said. \u201cI was playing well, and obviously in a lot better shape.\u201d\nKrickstein won 8-4. Jimmy Arias, another 1980s hotshot, worked as the chair umpire. About 750 people showed up to watch. Connors stayed until 11 p.m., talking to members, posing for pictures, doing all the things he rarely does.\nKrickstein has moved on plenty, too. For the first five or six years after the loss, Krickstein would catch glimpses of it during those rain delays and turn away. He didn\u2019t want to hear about it, talk about it, or see it.\nWith age, perspectives can change. He\u2019s fine with it now.\n\u201cIt is an iconic match,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople who saw it still think of it as one of the best tennis matches of all time, even though it wasn\u2019t the finals and even though it wasn\u2019t one of the greatest tennis matches as far as level of play. It had a little bit of everything.\u201d\nThe New York Court Classics series is presented by Ralph Lauren.\nThe Athletic maintains full editorial independence.

      "text": "MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 With another crazily brave surge at the end in Melbourne, Madison Keys became a 16-year overnight success.\nThe wrenching struggle to meet the expectation that arrived when she won her first WTA Tour match at 14. The heartache and regrets she weathered for the seven years that have passed since her only other appearance in a Grand Slam final.\nAdvertisement\nIt all dissipated in a flurry of crushing groundstrokes that rolled over Aryna Sabalenka, the world No. 1 and the two-time Australian Open champion who has been rolling over just about everybody else for the past year. With an inside-out forehand that attached itself to the corner of the court, Keys was free and into one of the great tear-filled hugs \u2014 with her husband and coach, Bjorn Fratangelo \u2014 that this tournament has ever seen.\nOn a breezy night on Rod Laver Arena, Keys, 29, beat Sabalenka 6-3, 2-6, 7-5 to win the first Grand Slam title of a career that once looked like it would be full of them.\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted this for so long,\u201d she said as she clutched the silver trophy, a major winner at last.\nAll these years later, there is a whole generation of tennis fans who weren\u2019t alive or can\u2019t remember the breathless buzz that was spreading about the girl from the Midwest honing her game at Chris Evert\u2019s academy in South Florida in 2008.\n\u201cFrom 10 years old, she had more power than anyone her age, easy power,\u201d Evert wrote in a text message Saturday morning. \u201cOn a good day, she could beat anyone, but on a bad day would make lots of errors. Hadn\u2019t figured out how to harness the power yet. At 14, in her first pro tournament, she beat a top 80 player.\u201d\nEvert can still see the 114mph ace she hit. Then, Keys was coming for tennis. Instead, tennis sort of came for her. At first, the buzz empowered her, but then it became something like a panic.\n\u201cIf I don\u2019t do it, am I considered a failure?\u201d she said in her news conference of what she had wondered for many of those 16 years until the final ball Saturday night.\nThere were big moments on the way. She made the semifinals of this tournament a decade ago, when she was still a teenager; two years later she made the U.S. Open final and entered the court as a solid favorite. She was playing against Sloane Stephens, a childhood friend she grew up with at Evert\u2019s academy. Keys was there, but not really. Tight and tentative from the start, she won three games in all and lost the second set 6-0.\nTwo years ago, she was twice within a tiebreak of getting back to the final in New York. Sabalenka was the brave one that night, breaking Keys\u2019 heart once more.\nAdvertisement\nLast summer she appeared to be cruising into the Wimbledon quarterfinals, leading 5-2 in the deciding set against Jasmine Paolini. Then her hamstring popped. As the years passed and as her 30th birthday ticked closer, she began to confront the challenge of being content with a career that might end without a Grand Slam title, the one thing she and every other player want more than everything else.\n\u201cAs I had gotten older and gotten close and it didn\u2019t happen\u2026 It was almost a panic,\u201d Keys said.\nFratangelo asked her what she wanted out of the rest of her career. Easy answer, of course. But she understood that was far beyond her control. In every Grand Slam, there are going to be as many as seven other players who will have a lot to say about whether a player will win or lose.\nTogether they came upon the mindset that there was something that mattered more than that. Leaving the court with no regrets after every match, the reward for playing with the kind of courage and conviction that allows someone to sleep at night no matter what the scoreboard shows.\nEarlier in the week, Fratangelo explained how they had landed on her approach to the game. For years, she and other coaches had been trying to harness her power, reining it in with some control. That worked a decade or so ago, but now almost everyone has big power. Maybe the best path to the waterfall was to make hers even bigger, and if that meant living with some errors and some losses, so be it.\n\u201cIt had to be up to her to kind of buy into that,\u201d he said. \u201cShe did, and now it looks amazing.\u201d\nGO DEEPER\nMadison Keys wins the Australian Open on her terms\nWhen Keys reflected on not having to wait anymore, she knew she had to go through all of the adversity to understand what it had and had not meant. What ended with the final started back in Florida, at Evert\u2019s academy, but to realize it all Keys had to go through it. She entered therapy, she said. In Melbourne, she went through three of the best in the world.\nAdvertisement\nHere\u2019s what her scoreboard ended up showing:\nA fourth-round match against Elena Rybakina, the 2023 Australian Open finalist, was even midway through the third set after Keys saved multiple break points in its second game. Keys blasted away and knocked off the 2022 Wimbledon champion.\nA semifinal against Iga Swiatek, the No. 2 seed, five-time Grand Slam champion and the best female player through the past three years, was even closer. Down 8-7 in a deciding tiebreak having been match point down in normal time, Keys hit an ace and an unreturned serve before claiming her own match point with a final big swing that Swiatek couldn\u2019t return onto the court.\n\u201cAfter that match, I told myself I could actually win on Saturday,\u201d she said.\nAnd then the final against Sabalenka, everyone\u2019s favorite all tournament. Keys played the first set from the moon, blasting serves and groundstrokes to overwhelm her opponent. Sabalenka, who has built her own big-match toughness in the last year, recovered to seize the momentum and win the second.\nAfter a third set with no quarter, Keys was a game from the trophy with Sabalenka trying to prolong the match into a deciding tiebreak. Before the final, Keys spoke of her admiration for Sabalenka\u2019s ability to lean into the tennis she wanted to play in the biggest moments. Facing her on the other side of the net, Keys leaned in as she never had before.\nEvery serve that came at her she pounded back. She missed one long; she barely got her strings on another. But all the others sent Sabalenka scrambling, especially the last one that landed an inch from the baseline. Keys took control of the point, waiting for that last forehand that was past Sabalenka before she could even move for it.\nWhen it was over, Keys had knocked off three top-10 seeds consecutively. She had beaten three of the four best players of the past two years, and far and away the two best in the world in consecutive matches.\n\u201cBear with me, I\u2019m absolutely going to cry,\u201d she said as she began to speak to some 14,000 fans in the packed stadium.\nAfter 16 years, the overnight sensation was ready for her success.\n(Top photo: Vincent Thian / Associated Press)"

Renata Zaraz\u00faa, the world No. 82 from Mexico, came from a set and 3-0 down to stun the No. 6 seed 6-7(10), 7-6(3), 7-5 in bright sunlight on Arthur Ashe Stadium.\nZaraz\u00faa also became the first Mexican woman to ever beat a top-10 opponent at the U.S. Open.\nAdvertisement\nKeys, who prevailed in a twisting first-set tiebreak and then took the first three games of the second set at a clip, appeared to have quelled Zaraz\u00faa\u2019s fight for good. But Zaraz\u00faa\u2019s offspeed balls, and her ability to redirect Keys\u2019 flat power with variation in height and spin, drew error after error from the American\u2019s racket. Though they went down on the stats sheet as mistakes, a significant number of the 80-plus unforced errors that Zaraz\u00faa drew from Keys\u2019 racket were in reality the product of accumulated pressure.\nIn this way, the match had shades of Keys\u2019 Wimbledon exit to Laura Siegemund of Germany, though Siegemund and Zaraz\u00faa\u2019s styles of tennis are different.\nTodas las emociones \ud83d\udc9a\nRenata Zarazua of Mexico notches the biggest win of her career, rallying from 7-6 3-0 down to stun Keys! pic.twitter.com/NDtoZl6M4F\n\u2014 US Open Tennis (@usopen) August 25, 2025\nHaving been behind for much of the match, Zaraz\u00faa all of a sudden found herself 5-3 up and serving for the biggest win of her career by ranking in the third set. Keys instead broke the 27-year-old\u2019s serve, and dragged the decider to 5-5 after again alternating between blasted winners and errors into the net.\nBut after missing a string of returns in the next game, Keys blasted yet another forehand into the net after a lengthy rally and the patterns of the match recurred. Another error gave Zaraz\u00faa match point, and one final netted forehand ended the match.\nKeys\u2019 exit opens up world No. 3 Coco Gauff\u2019s section of the draw \u2014 they were slated to meet in the quarterfinals had the top seeds in their quarter progressed.\n(Photo: Maddie Meyer / Getty Images)"

      "text": "The Athletic has live coverage of the 2025 U.S. Open\nLOUIS ARMSTRONG STADIUM \u2014 It\u2019s been a while since Felix Auger-Aliassime had a night like this on a tennis court: under the lights, in a raucous atmosphere, rolling to a stunning win.\nThe Canadian did something he had never done Saturday, recording his first win over a top-five player at a Grand Slam by beating No. 3 seed Alexander Zverev at the U.S. Open in front of a packed Louis Armstrong Stadium. What better place to do it than at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, the site of his maiden Grand Slam semifinal in 2021?\nAdvertisement\nAfter losing the first set, the 25-year-old saved a set point to go down 2-0 before edging out Zverev in a second-set tiebreak. For Auger-Aliassime, winning the tiebreak opened the door he needed to play with more freedom and aggression. He got onto the front foot and stayed there, against a player whose passivity in big moments continues to compress the trajectory of his career, triumphing 4-6, 7-6(7), 6-4, 6-4 in three hours and 48 minutes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a great boost of confidence, for sure,\u201d Auger-Aliassime said in his news conference. \u201cEncouraging for myself, my team, everybody that\u2019s been supporting me.\u201d\nAs the match went on, the extraordinary shots started to flow freely for Auger-Aliassime. He hit his forehand with such pace and authority, particularly in the third set, where he had eight winners. Zverev became frustrated, talking to his box and throwing his racket as the set drew to a close. Auger-Aliassime was the better player in the tight moments, and he snatched the set from the German 6-4.\nIn the fourth set at 3-3, Auger-Aliassime started the game with two blazing forehand winners. Then, at 0-40, he forced Zverev to dump a backhand into the net, giving the Canadian the break. Fans erupted with cheers and \u201clet\u2019s go Felix\u201d chants as Auger-Aliassime fist-pumped while walking to his chair. As he won the match in four sets, he raised his arms and flashed the number one with his pointer finger, asking the crowd to cheer louder. The fans stood and roared in response.\nIt was Auger-Aliassime\u2019s first win against a top-three player anywhere in three years, as well as his first over a top-five player at a major. Auger-Aliassime, ranked 27th in the world entering the U.S. Open, has two titles in 2025 at the Adelaide International in Australia and the Montpellier Open in France. But he\u2019s struggled with consistency at the big tournaments. At the three previous majors this year, his best result was the second round at the Australian Open. At the Canadian Open in Toronto, his home tournament, Auger-Aliassime lost in the opening match.\nAdvertisement\nDespite the results, Auger-Aliassime was confident in the practice and training. He moved on from the Toronto loss to Cincinnati, where he reached the quarterfinals. Auger-Aliassime believed that the work he was putting in off court would set him up for a potential breakthrough moment, even though success in tennis is never guaranteed.\n\u201cI try to always stay ambitious, professional, and to take care of every detail throughout the years,\u201d Auger-Aliassime said. \u201cIt can be frustrating when it\u2019s maybe not paying off as much, but that\u2019s the life of most players. You have to accept it and I think be humble in losses.\n\u201cYou have to be patient and trust that if you have clear intentions in your practice and when the match comes that results like this will come.\u201d\nThe moment was well worth the wait. He\u2019s back into the second week of a Grand Slam, with what feels like an entire country behind him.\nThe result compounds a dismal year for Zverev, who has won plenty of matches without making a meaningful dent at the top of the ATP Tour. He started the year by reaching the Australian Open final, where he lost to Jannik Sinner. Since then, the world No. 3 has won a title and reached two more finals, but the gap between him and the top two, Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, has only grown.\nAfter a first-round defeat to France\u2019s Arthur Rinderknech at Wimbledon, Zverev said he felt \u201cvery alone,\u201d and that he was \u201clacking joy in everything\u201d he did. On the eve of the U.S. Open, the German said he was on \u201cthe right path\u201d after seeking professional support for his mental health.\nZverev has lost three Grand Slam finals, including at the U.S. Open five years ago, and is considered by many to be the best player not to have won a major. He is the leading member of the sandwich generation in men\u2019s tennis, a group of players born in the 1990s who ran into Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic on their way up through the sport and then found Alcaraz and Sinner waiting for them several years later.\nAuger-Aliassime moves on to play Andrey Rublev, the No. 15 seed, in the fourth round.\n(Photo: Charly Triballeau / AFP via Getty Images)"
