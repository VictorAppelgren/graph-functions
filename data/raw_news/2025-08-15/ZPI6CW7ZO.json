  "content": "Three months after Liverpool celebrated a record-equalling 20th title, the Premier League is back.\n\nThe reigning champions get the ball rolling when they host Bournemouth at Anfield on Friday night, before Manchester City travel to Wolverhampton the folllowing day.\n\nA new-look Manchester United host title contenders Arsenal on Sunday afternoon, while Leeds kick off life in the Premier League when they host Everton a day later.\n\nFrom Liverpool\u2019s summer spending spree to a new era at Everton and from Arsenal\u2019s latest title bid to Ruben Amorim\u2019s first full campaign in charge of United, there is plenty of intrigue surrounding the new season.\n\nHere is what to keep an eye out for as the Premier League makes its return.\n\nChampions at a canter last time out, Liverpool have embarked on the kind of spending spree the most dominant teams in the Premier League seldom indulge in.\n\nThe Reds set a new club transfer record by signing Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen for $158 million (\u00a3116 million), while Hugo Ekitike was nabbed from under Newcastle\u2019s nose.\n\nThe signings of Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong, meanwhile, revamped Liverpool\u2019s options at full-back following the departure of Trent Alexander-Arnold, the headline exit of a host of sales which also included Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez.\n\nLiverpool\u2019s summer spending already exceeds $340 million and could rise even further, should they land Alexander Isak, who has effectively gone on strike to force a move out of Newcastle.\n\nIf there is an area of concern for Liverpool, aside of how they will cope with the grief following the tragic passing of Diogo Jota, is their defence which remains overly-reliant on Virgil Van Djik.\n\nSecond for the past three seasons, Arsenal have strengthened in all the required areas as they Mikel Arteta looks to deliver the Premier League that has been missing since 2004.\n\nViktor Gyokeres has arrived from Sporting Club for $86m where he scored 54 goals in 52 matches in all competitions last season and Arsenal will hope he can be the elite striker they have been crying out for.\n\nKai Havertz scored just nine goals last term, yet he was the Gunners\u2019 top scorer in the Premier League. Gyokeres should address that.\n\nElsewhere, Martin Zubimendi is an upgrade on Thomas Partey in midfield, while Noni Madueke bolsters Arteta\u2019s attacking options.\n\nLike Arsenal, Manchester City have also been aggressive in the transfer market, spending north of $200m on Tijjani Reijnders, Rayan A\u00eft-Nouri, James Trafford and Rayan Cherki.\n\nFor the first time in his nine years in the Premier League, Pep Guardiola faces a delicate rebuild after ending last season empty-handed.\n\nArsenal and City have spent well, but it may not be enough to catch Liverpool.\n\nOver the summer, Rubem Amorim indicated he sees himself being at Manchester United for the next two decades. It was a bold claim and not just because longevity is an increasingly rare luxury in football and United have churned through five permanent managers since Sir Alex Ferguson left Old Trafford 12 years ago.\n\nIn his first season in charge, Amorim oversaw a historically dismal campaign. United finished 15th in the Premier League with 42 points, their lowest position since they were relegated from the old First Division in 1974.\n\nTheir 18 defeats were also a club record high in the Premier League era, while their 40 goals pointed an impotent attack. A limp defeat to Tottenham in the Europa League final denied United a back door entry in the Champions League and the $120 million cash injection it would have generated.\n\nAmorim arrived in England in November as one of European football\u2019s most exciting managers, but has become under intense scrutiny because of the lack of results and his near-dogmatic 3-4-3 approach.\n\nThere are, of course, mitigating factors. The Portuguese took over a squad that was a collection of years of poor recruitment, an issue exacerbated by a club drifting off the field.\n\nSir Jim Ratcliffe\u2019s new regime has doubled down on Amorim, insisting last season\u2019s pain was a necessary medicine to restore the patient to health.\n\nMatheus Cunha, Briam Mbeumo and Benjamin Sesko have arrived for a combined $270 million, a significant outlay for a club that continue to face significant financial headwinds.\n\nUnited remain interested in Brighton midfielder Carlos Baleba, who would provide an immediate upgrade on the options currently at Amorim\u2019s disposal and a new goalkeeper to replace the erratic Andre Onana should also be a priority.\n\nA season of consolidation may be Amorim\u2019s best hope, but he needs to show tangible improvements if he is to survive.\n\nFor the past two seasons, the three newly-promoted clubs in the Premier League have swiftly returned to the Championship at the first time of asking.\n\nThe gap between English football\u2019s top tier and the second division is an ever-growing chasm, which is increasingly difficult to bridge.\n\nThat is the challenge awaiting Burnley, Leeds and Sunderland this season. Of the trio, Sunderland have arguably done the best business this summer, while in Daniel Farke Leeds have a manager with Premier League experience - albeit a brief one, as his Norwich City side were relegated at the first time of asking.\n\nThen there is Burnley, who won promotion last season on the back of conceding just 16 goals in 46 matches in the Championship.\n\nThat kind of defensive solidity should serve them well in the Premier League, but the departure of James Trafford for Manchester City is a tough blow.\n\nTrafford kept 30 clean sheets last season and while Martin Dubravka is a dependable replacement, he will face an altogether different challenge.\n\nIt\u2019s out with the old and in with the new at Everton as they move into their new home at Hill Dickinson Stadium after 133 years at Goodison Park.\n\nHaving flirted with relegation more or less closely for the past four seasons, the Toffees will be hoping the move to their new ground can coincide with an upturn in fortunes.\n\nDavid Moyes, however, has not had an easy summer. Everton have missed out on top targets Francisco Conceicao and Johan Bakayoko and are no closer to signing Tyler Dibling from Southampton.\n\nThierno Barry will serve as understudy to Beto at least initially as Everton look to address their chronic shortage of goals, while Jack Grealish has joined on an expensive loan deal from Manchester City.\n\nGrealish\u2019s arrival is intriguing. The former Aston Villa captain lost his way under Pep Guardiola and never lived up to the hype of being British football\u2019s first $135 million man.\n\nWith a World Cup on the horizon, Everton should represent the perfect opportunity for Grealish to reignite his career. On the flip side, the midfielder turns 30 in September and may never recover the form he showed at Villa.\n\nWhat else is new in the Premier League?\n\nQuite a lot, actually. For a start, Puma has replaced Nike as the official ball supplier after 25 years, with its Orbita Ultimate ball set to make its debut on Friday in the season opener.\n\nNew laws have also been introduced, chief among them one which will see goalkeepers concede a corner if they hold onto the ball with their hands for longer than eight seconds.\n\nThe semi-automated offsides will return from the beginning of the season after making their debut back in April and fans in the stadiums will be able to hear referees explaining the outcome of VAR reviews.\n\nThe cameras referee worn at the Club World Cup will be trialled from the opening weekend for about six weeks and managers can be interviewed at half-time from now on.\n\nFinally, for viewers in the USA all 380 matches will be shown on NBC, with almost half of them streamed exclusively on Peacock and the remainder split between an NBC channel or USA Network.",

      "text": "As he addressed the crowd after Manchester United\u2019s final game of the season last month, Ruben Amorim promised Old Trafford that the \u201cgood days are coming\u201d.\nIt seemed a curious message for the Portuguese to deliver, considering he had just apologized for a \u201cdisaster season\u201d.\nUnited did indeed endure a nightmare campaign, finishing 15th in the Premier League - its lowest-ever position since the league was launched in 1992 - and losing the Europa League final against Tottenham.\nOverall, it was the club\u2019s worst season since 1974, when United was relegated to what was then the Second Division.\nDespite a historically poor campaign, United stood firmly behind Amorim, who replaced Erik ten Hag in November, and has wasted no time to back him in the transfer window so far.\nThe trading period only began on June 1, but United has already completed the signing of Matheus Cunha from Wolverhampton Wanderers after triggering his \u00a362.5m ($83.7m) release clause.\nThe Brazilian, who signed a five-year deal with the option of a further year, could soon be joined by Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo.\nUnited has tabled an opening offer of \u00a355m ($74.6m) for the Cameroon international, who has one year left on his contract.\nBetween them Cunha and Mbeumo scored 35 goals and delivered 14 assists in the Premier League and would immediately upgrade Amorim\u2019s attacking options after United scored just 44 goals in the league last term.\nBut while signings are crucial if Amorim is to succeed, and a striker and central midfielder are arguably still needed, selling players this summer is just as important for United.\nThe reasons for that are two-fold. First and foremost, failure to qualify for European competitions this season means United will only have the Premier League, FA Cup and the Carabao Cup to contend with.\nThat could effectively mean a 40-game season if United was to get knocked out of both domestic cups straight away.\nWith fewer games on the calendar, a smaller, more streamlined squad would be enough to compete on three fronts with United playing just once a week - aside from Carabao Cup commitments.\nManchester United needs a clearout\nFar more importantly, United needs to sell players to finance any spending and to comply with the Premier League\u2019s Profity and Sustainability Rules (PSR), which allow clubs to lose a maximum of \u00a3105m ($142m) over three seasons.\nIn March, United\u2019s part-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe told The Times and BBC Sport that the club was in danger of going bust by Christmas, had it not been for drastic cost-cutting measures.\nThat came after in January the club had admitted being \u201cin danger of failing to comply with PSR/FFP [Financial Fair Play] requirements in future years\u201d.\nBut in the same round of interviews, Ratcliffe also insisted the club was \u201cnot going to breach PSR\u201d, allaying fears United may be hamstrung in the transfer window.\nAll the same, selling players who are surplus to requirements would allow Amorim to spend even more this summer, without falling foul of the Premier League financial rules.\nMarcus Rashford, Antony, Tyrrel Malacia and Jadon Sancho will all be returning to Old Trafford after spending last season - or part of it, in the former trio\u2019s case - on loan.\nOf the quartet, Antony is likely to be the more in-demand this summer. The Brazilian scored nine goals and registered five assists in 29 games in all competitions for Real Betis after joining the LaLiga club on loan in January.\nAn \u00a386m ($116m) signing from Ajax in the summer of 2022, Antony is the second-most expensive player in United\u2019s history but never showed signs of living up to his price-tag.\nThe Brazilian scored eight goals in 44 games in all competitions in his first season, but his output dropped to three goals in 38 appearances the following term.\nLast season, he started only three of his 14 appearances before United shipped him out on loan.\nThe spell at Real Betis has revived Antony\u2019s career, with the LaLiga club hoping to sign him permanently. Bayer Leverkusen is also said to be among the suitors, with ten Hag keen to be reunited with a player he managed at Ajax and United.\nWhile Antony\u2019s stock has risen on loan, the situation is far more complex when it comes to Rashford, the 13th-most prolific goalscorer in United\u2019s history with 138 goals, and Sancho.\nWhere next for Marcus Rashford?\nThe former moved to Aston Villa on a temporary transfer in January, scoring four goals and providing six assists in 17 appearances in all competitions and returning to the England squad in March.\nRashford started each of the four Champions League fixtures he played at Villa, but was in the starting XI in only four of his 10 appearances in the Premier League.\nA hamstring injury brought his season to a premature end at the beginning of last month, further complicating his future.\nVilla has an option to buy Rashford for \u00a340m ($50.3m), but failure to qualify for the Champions League and its precarious financial position in terms of PSR mean they may have to sell before they buy.\nThe terms of the loan deal, however, do not preclude another club from buying him for the same price, should it struck a deal with both United and the player.\nRashford is under contract with United until June 2028 and earns about \u00a3365,000 ($495,000) a week, wages which could prove to be a stumbling block from most clubs outside of the Premier League.\nStill only 27, the England international should in theory be at the peak of his powers.\nConversely, he hasn\u2019t hit the double-digit mark in terms of Premier League goals in the past two seasons.\nMore significantly, Amorim criticized his contribution and questioned his commitment.\n\"Imagine a talent like Rashford, our team should be so much better with him, but he has to change,\" he said in January.\n\"If he changes, we are more than welcome to include him, and we need it. But in this moment we have to set some standards. We are waiting for Rashford, if he wants it really bad.\u201d\nJadon Sancho faces Manchester United exit\nSancho faces a similar predicament after his loan spell at Chelsea ended this week.\nThe Blues signed the 25-year-old on a temporary transfer last summer with an obligation to buy worth up to \u00a325m ($33.7m).\nHowever, after failing to agree terms with Sancho, Chelsea opted to pay a \u00a35m ($6.7m) penalty charge to pull out of the deal.\nSancho was considered one of European soccer\u2019s outstanding talents when he joined United from Borussia Dortmund in the summer of 2021 for \u00a385m ($115m), a fee which remains the fourth-highest ever paid by the club.\nBut he never reached the same heights at Old Trafford, scoring a combined 12 goals in all competitions in two seasons despite starting 56 of his 79 appearances.\nHe was loaned back to Dortmund in the summer of 2023 after he publicly fell out with ten Hag, who had questioned his commitment.\nSancho joined Chelsea at the beginning of the season, scoring five goals and providing ten assists in 42 games in all competitions as the Blues secured Champions League qualification and won the Europa Conference League.\nAccording to The Athletic, Sancho has options in England and abroad and will make a decision on his future this summer.\nThe winger earns north of \u00a3250,000 ($340,000) a week and his contract runs out in 12 months, with United unlikely to trigger its option to extend the deal by a further year.\nUnited could also consider offers for Rasmus Hojlund, who has scored just 14 goals in two Premier League seasons after signing from Serie A side Atalanta in a deal worth up to \u00a372m ($97.7m) in the summer of 2023.\nThe Danish striker has been an unmitigated disaster for United, albeit partly due to having to feed off scraps in a team that doesn\u2019t create enough chances.\nA return to Italy has been mooted, with Inter Milan and Juventus both interested to sign the striker on loan.\nUnited will look very different once the season starts in August. Whether it will be enough to deliver the \u201cgood days\u201d Amorim promised, remains to be seen."

      "text": "Throughout their barren decades in the 1990s and 2000s, Liverpool were often ridiculed as a club living in the past.\nWith success on the pitch proving frustratingly elusive, reflecting on the glory days was all there was left at Anfield.\nThere were, of course, notable exceptions. The Reds won the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup - the precursor to the Europa League - under Gerard Houllier in 2001 and lifted the second of those trophies again in 2003.\nTwo years later, under Rafael Benitez Liverpool won the Champions League in the most dramatic of circumstances, beating AC Milan on penalties after trailing 3-0 at half-time. Another FA Cup followed a year later, again on penalties and again after a late comeback.\nBut those exceptions were exactly that, exceptions. After winning the old First Division in 1990 for the 18th time, Liverpool came second just five times in the next three decades, until they finally got their hands on the league title again in 2020.\nNostalgia has since been replaced by success, with trophies coming almost as regularly as they did during the club\u2019s dominant run in the 1970s and 1980s.\nThe Premier League title the Reds lifted in May was their eighth major trophy since they won the Champions League in 2019 under Jurgen Klopp.\nThe current iteration of Liverpool is very much a team living in the present and planning for the future, as underlined by the signing of Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen last week.\nFlorian Wirtz is a statement signing for Liverpool\nAt up to \u00a3116m ($158m) - \u00a3100m in transfer fee with a potential \u00a316m in add-ons - the German is both a club record signing and the most expensive player ever signed by a British club, beating the record set by Chelsea\u2019s deal for Moises Caicedo two years ago.\nThe price tag is unlikely to face Wirtz, who has dealt with attention from the moment he became the youngest player in Leverkusen\u2019s history aged 17. Less than a month later, he wrote his name in the history books as the club\u2019s youngest goalscorer.\nBy the time Leverkusen won their maiden German title 12 months ago after going unbeaten in the Bundesliga, Wirtz was a pillar of Xabi Alonso\u2019s side, which also won the German Cup and reached the Europa League final.\nWirtz was named Bundesliga player of the season for the 2023-24 season, after scoring 18 goals and registering 20 assists in 49 matches in all competitions.\nLast season, he scored 16 goals and registered 15 assists in 45 games as Leverkusen finished second to Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga and were knocked out in the Round of 16 of the Champions League.\n\u201cI feel very happy and very proud. Finally it\u2019s done and I was waiting for a long time,\u201d Wirtz told Liverpool\u2019s website.\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited to have a new adventure in front of me. This was also a big point of my thoughts: that I want to have something completely new, to go out of the Bundesliga and to join the Premier League.\n\u201cI will see how I can perform. I hope I can do my best. I spoke also with some players who played [at Liverpool] and they told me that it\u2019s perfect for me and every pitch is perfect, you can enjoy every game. I\u2019m really looking forward to playing my first game.\n\u201cI would like to win everything every year. First of all, we have to do our work, I have to make my work. In the end, we want to be successful.\n\"Last season they won the Premier League so my goal is for sure to win it again and also to go further in the Champions League. I\u2019m really ambitious.\u201d\nA modern No10, the Germany international is a high-intensity player and should fit seamlessly into Arne Slot\u2019s brand of fast, attacking football.\nLiverpool remained over-reliant on Mohamed Salah last season, but Wirtz\u2019s arrival will immediately upgrade their front three and broaden the range of options at Slot\u2019s disposal.\nThe German\u2019s arrival also underlines a significant change in dynamic for Liverpool, who have been outside of the top 10 spenders on player signings in the Premier League since 2019.\nSalah, Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Alexis MacAllister have all proved hugely successful buys, but they all fell in the \u201cMoneyball\u201d category, albeit to various degrees.\nThe Reds last spent big on elite players seven years ago when Virgil van Dijk signed for Southampton for \u00a375m in January 2018, with Alisson arriving from Roma for \u00a365m seven months later.\nBoth signings proved to be transformative and Slot will hope Wirtz can have a similar impact.\nA busy summer for Liverpool\nThe 22-year-old\u2019s arrival on his own would be a major statement of intent from the reigning Premier League champions, but even more so coming alongside the signings of fellow Bayer Leverkusen wing-back Jeremie Frimpong and Bournemouth left-back Milos Kerkez.\nLiverpool activated Frimpong\u2019s \u00a329.6m release clause and have reached an agreement with the Cherries to sign Kerkez for around \u00a340m.\nThe Hungary international has established himself as one of the best defenders in the Premier League after joining Bournemouth from Dutch side AZ Alkmaar for \u00a315m two years ago.\nKerkez made 67 appearances for the Cherries in two seasons and started all of his team\u2019s 38 league fixtures last term, scoring six goals and providing two assists.\nLike Wirtz, Frimpong was a key player for Leverkusen under Alonso, scoring 30 goals and recording 44 assists in 190 appearances in all competitions after joining the Bundesliga side from Celtic in January of 2021.\nThe Dutch international is expected to be a direct replacement for Trent Alexander-Arnold, who joined Real Madrid ahead of the Club World Cup.\nFederico Chiesa was the Reds\u2019 only major signing last summer, along with Valencia goalkeeper Giorgi Mamardashvili, who stayed with the LaLiga club for another season.\nSlot, however, made clear he wanted the club to build on the Premier League title.\n\"It will be just as tough or even tougher next season because the clubs we've competed with this season have always invested a lot of money and they will probably do so this summer as well,\" he said in May.\n\"We just want good players. Ideally you sign them as soon as you can but it is not always easy.\"\nNext May, it will be 42 years since Liverpool last retained the title, claiming the old First Division for the third time in a row.\nDefend their crown successfully and they will move one clear of Manchester United and onto a record 21 league titles.\nHistory, at long last, appears to be again a source of inspiration rather than a burden at Anfield."

      "text": "Champions of England for a record-equalling 20th time in May, Liverpool could well bring the confetti out again in nine months as they begin the Premier League season firmly as the team to beat.\nPredictions are always a fool\u2019s errand, but it feels a fairly safe bet to suggest the Reds could retain their crown and pull one clear of Manchester United\u2019s tally of titles.\nThe reasons for such confidence are two-fold.\nLiverpool were the best team in England by a long distance last term and triumphed at a canter, finishing 10 points clear of Arsenal.\nArne Slot\u2019s debut season at Anfield was meant to be one of adjustment as he stepped into the nigh-on impossible role of replacing Jurgen Klopp.\nInstead, Liverpool hit the ground running under the Dutchman, winning 11 of their first 12 games, and never looked back.\nIn the process Slot became the first Liverpool manager to win the title at the first time of asking after club legends Joe Fagan and Sir Kenny Dalglish.\n\"To replace Jurgen is a big job and the manager did it in his own way and deserves a lot of credit,\" Virgil van Dijk said of Slot after Liverpool swept Tottenham aside to clinch the title at the end of April.\n\"I don't think anyone from the outside world thought we would be Premier League champions.\"\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Reds\u2019 triumph, Slot suggested the summer would hold an evolution rather than a revolution.\n\u201cRadical changes, you will probably not see,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThat [radical changes]\nwould be a bit weird if you won the league.\u201dBut radical changes have followed over the past three months or at least as close to radical as possible for a team that won the league with such ease.\nWill Liverpool\u2019s summer spending spree pay off?\nThe Reds set a new club transfer record by signing Florian Wirtz from Bayer Leverkusen for $158 million (\u00a3116 million), while Hugo Ekitike was nabbed from under Newcastle\u2019s nose.\nThe signings of Milos Kerkez and Jeremie Frimpong, meanwhile, revamped Liverpool\u2019s options at full-back and the arrival of Giovanni Leoni from Serie A side Parma will bolster Slot\u2019s options at centre-back.\nLiverpool\u2019s summer spending already exceeds $340 million, a staggering amount in any circumstance, even more so for the reigning champions. It marks the first time since 2018 and only the second since the turn of the century that the Reds have been the biggest spenders in the Premier League.\nAnd more may still be to come if the Reds are successful in landing Alexander Isak from Newcastle.\nNewcastle\u2019s stance has hitherto been that the Sweden international is not for sale, but their resolve is being tested.\nIsak, who is under contract for two more years with the Magpies, did not travel on their pre-season tour to Singapore and South Korea and has told the club he intends to explore new options.\nNewcastle have already knocked back a $150m offer from Liverpool and maintain they want north of $200m for the striker.\nThe changes at Anfield have not been limited to arrivals, with several significant departures this summer.\nTrent Alexander-Arnold left for Real Madrid in time for the Club\u2019s World Cup in June and was followed out of the door by Luis Diaz and Darwin Nunez, who joined Bayern Munich and Al-Hilal respectively.\nJarrell Quansah moved to Bayern Leverkusen, while Caoimhin Kelleher left for Brentford.\nOverall, Liverpool recouped $226 million from player sales and the figure could rise further if Harvey Elliott, Federico Chiesa and Kostas Tsimikas are moved on before the transfer window shuts on September 1.\nWhile a stellar transfer window does not always immediately translate into stellar performances on the pitch, the early signings are promising.\nWirtz has looked excellent in pre-season and assisted Ekitike\u2019s goal four minutes into the Community Shield on Sunday.\n\u201cLast season, we had a lot of ball possession, but that didn\u2019t always lead to promising situations,\" Slot said after Liverpool were beaten by Crystal Palace on penalties.\n\u201cWe are better in creating and getting promising situations than we were, in my opinion, throughout the whole of last season.\u201d\nThat Liverpool ultimately lost the season\u2019s traditional curtain raiser at Wembley will not be a major worry for the Dutchman.\nOf far greater concern will be the fact that despite their summer spending spree, the Premier League champions remain somewhat light of options at centre-back.\nVan Dijk and Ibrahima Konate may be one of the best defensive partnerships in the Premier League, but the former is 34 and the latter is in the final year of his contract.\nThe fitness of both players must be managed carefully, particularly as Joe Gomez, their most obvious replacement, has made only 48 starts in the past five Premier League seasons.\nAgainst that backdrop the signing of 18-year-old Leoni is as much about bolstering Slot\u2019s options as it is about future-proofing. Slot has indicated he intends to rotate his team more this season than he did last term, but defence is one area where he may not be able to do so.\nStellar Mo Salah remains key to Liverpool\u2019s plans\nIf Liverpool are short at centre-back, they have plenty of attacking weapons at their disposal, none more lethal than Mohamed Salah.\nThe reigning Premier League Player of the Year, the Egyptian enjoyed a stellar campaign last term, scoring 29 goals to win a fourth Golden Boot as the league\u2019s top scorer, equalling Thierry Henry\u2019s record in the process.\nSalah also registered 18 assists, matching the Premier League record for the most goal involvements in one season which was jointly held by Andy Cole and Alan Shearer.\nAt 33 years of age, Salah may be approaching the winter of his career, but he remains crucial to his team\u2019s chances of retaining their title and chasing a seventh Champions League triumph.\nArguably the biggest question mark around Liverpool centres on how they will cope with Diogo Jota\u2019s tragic passing in a car crash.\nHow the Reds deal with the devastating impact of such a tragedy remains to be seen.\nVan Dijk has spoken of the players\u2019 desire to honour Jota and to \u201ccarry on his legacy\u201d and retaining the Premier League title would be a fitting way for Liverpool to do so."

      "text": "Manchester City chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak vowed the club would be \u201caggressive\u201d in this summer window after ending last season empty-handed.\nSo far, City has lived up to al-Mubarak\u2019s words and then some.\nIn nine days since the transfer window opened, City has already completed the signings of AC Milan and Netherlands midfielder Tijjani Reijnders for \u00a346.3m ($62.7m) and Wolverhampton left-back Rayan A\u00eft-Nouri for \u00a331m ($42m).\nA deal for Olympique Lyon attacking midfielder Rayan Cherki, meanwhile, has been all but finalized.\nAs per The Athletic, Cherki will move to England for \u00a333.7m ($45.6m).\nCity must register their new signings by 7pm BST (2pm EST) on Tuesday to have them available for the Club World Cup, which begins next week.\nThe significance of City\u2019s spending spree is two-fold. First and foremost, it comes with a verdict into alleged breaches of the Premier League\u2019s financial rules still hanging over the club.\nIn February 2023, City was formally charged with breaking financial fair play rules between 2009 and 2018 and with failing to co-operate with Premier League investigations into their finances.\nThe club\u2019s hearing in the case against the Premier League began on September 16 last year and ran until December 6 in front of a three-person independent commission in London.\nBack in February, Pep Guardiola admitted he expected the verdict \u201cwithin a month\u201d.\nHis forecast has proved to be wide of the mark, with the commission yet to return a judgment six months after the hearing ended.\nBy comparison, it took UEFA just two days to find City guilty of financial manipulation in January 2020, a verdict which was subsequently overturned on appeal.\nWith a judgment still pending, City has wasted no time in reshaping its squad after spending $245m on players in the January transfer window.\nOmar Marmoush joined from Eintrach Frankfurt, while Savinho and Nico Gonzalez arrived from Troyes and Porto for respectively and centre-back Abdukodir Kushanov signed from Lens.\nThe spending spree was not enough to prevent City from finishing without any silverware for the first time since the 2016-17 season, Guardiola\u2019s first campaign in the Premier League.\nCity has won the Premier League six times in the past eight seasons, but finished third 13 points behind eventual champions Liverpool last season and never looked like retaining its crown.\nThe Champions League brought an elimination at the hands of Real Madrid in the Round of 16 and there was heartbreak in the FA Cup final for the second consecutive year with defeat to Cyrstal Palace.\nIn that respect, the arrivals of Reijnders, A\u00eft-Nouri and Chekri point to a clear desire to refresh the squad.\nReijnders can be the answer to City\u2019s midfield issues\nDespite the $67.8m arrival of Gonzalez from Porto in January, City\u2019s midfield lack of physicality and running power was badly exposed both domestically and in Europe.\nThe issue was exacerbated by the absences of reigning Ballon d\u2019Or winner Rodri, who missed almost the entire season with a knee injury, and Mateo Kovacic.\nReijnders\u2019 arrival should go some way towards addressing the lack of dynamism in City\u2019s engine room.\nThe Dutch international was arguably AC Milan\u2019s player of the season, with 10 goals and four assists in Serie A. Among midfielders, only Scott McTominay, had more goal involvements with 16.\nCity\u2019s new signing, who turns 27 next month, also ranked fifth for through balls and ninth for forward passes in Serie A last season.\nMilan signed Reijnders from Dutch side AZ Alkmaar in the summer of 2023 for $22.8m, but he netted only four goals in 50 appearances across all competitions \u2013 a figure that should have been much higher.\nWhen he met him in Saudi Arabia in January for the Italian Super Cup, former Milan manager Stefano Pioli teased him about his frequent shots off target.\nTwelve months on, Reijnders found the same promising positions but now with newfound composure, leading to a significant increase in his goal tally.\nHis shots on target more than tripled last season (from 0.25 to 0.87 per match), while his conversion rate more than doubled, soaring from 10% to 23%.\nWith Kevin De Bruyne leaving the Etihad Stadium as a free agent after 10 trophy-laden years and Ilkay Gundogan and Bernardo Silva approaching the winter of their careers, Reijnders could become a key figure in City\u2019s midfield.\nIs A\u00eft-Nouri the answer for City at left-back?\nJust like the Dutchman, A\u00eft-Nouri\u2019s arrival addresses a glaring weakness in Guardiola\u2019s squad.\nAccording to Opta stats, in the season just ended among defenders only Trent Alexander Arnold had more goal involvements per 90 minutes than A\u00eft-Nouri, with 0.34 to 0.32 respectively.\nThe prototypical modern full-back, who can use his athleticism to burst forward and is comfortable with the ball at his feet, the Algeria international is a versatile player.\nA\u00eft-Nouri played at left wing-back under Vitor Pereira following the Portuguese\u2019s arrival at Wolves in December.\nPereira switched between a five-man defense and a 3-4-3 formation, with the 24-year-old operating as an attacking wing-back in both circumstances.\nThe Algeria international played in the same role under Gary O\u2019Neill, Pereira\u2019s predecessor, when he was also deployed further forward as a left midfielder.\nA French maverick for Guardiola\nBut of the trio of signings, it is arguably Cherki who is the most intriguing.\nThe 21-year-old is coming off a breakout season, with 12 goals and 20 assists in all competitions and made his France debut last week, scoring in the 5-4 defeat against Spain in the Nations League semi-final.\nCherki also scored in both legs of the Europa League quarter-final against Manchester United and was named in the Europa League Team of the Season.\nData from Opta shows he outperformed City\u2019s attacking midfielders - Phil Foden, Jeremy Doku and Savinho - in all but one category last season, shots per 90 minutes.\nCherki and Doku both took 2.2 shots per game, while Savinho and Foden took 2.8 and 3.0 respectively.\nThe Frenchman, however, led the quartet in goals per 90 minutes with a 0.4 figure, compared to Foden and Doku\u2019s 0.3 and Savinho\u2019s 0.1.\nCherki\u2019s 0.6 assists per game were the high watermark in the category, when compared with Doku\u2019s 0.4, Savinho\u2019s 0.3 and Foden\u2019s 0.2 and he was also significant better in terms of creating opportunities.\nThe Lyon midfielder set up 3.7 chances per 90 minutes, comfortably ahead of Savinho and Foden with 2.3 and Doku with 2.1.\nA versatile player who can operate either as attacking midfielder or on the wing, Cherki is gifted with superb technique and looks ready to fill the void left by De Bruyne.\nFormer Arsenal striker and current CBS analyst Thierry Henry said he has \"never seen a player in history who dribbles as quickly as him\".\nHigh praise indeed. The Premier League has been warned."
