  "content": "Rapper Lil Nas X was arrested and briefly taken to a hospital for a suspected overdose Thursday after Los Angeles police say he charged at officers responding to a report of a naked man walking on a busy boulevard.\n\nLil Nas X, whose legal name is Montero Lamar Hill, was booked on suspicion of misdemeanor obstructing an officer and was being held in jail.\n\nOfficers found him walking on the normally very busy Ventura Boulevard in the Studio City neighborhood shortly before 6 a.m., Los Angeles police spokesman Officer Charles Miller said.\n\nAfter charging at arriving police, he was taken into custody, but the officers, suspecting a drug overdose, took him to a hospital first, Miller said. There was no further word on his condition, but he was released from the hospital and taken to jail after just a few hours.\n\nVideo obtained by TMZ appeared to show him on the street wearing only underwear and boots.\n\nHe was being held at Valley Jail in Van Nuys, near where the police found him.\n\nMessages to Lil Nas X representatives seeking comment were not immediately answered.\n\nThe 26-year-old rapper and singer from Atlanta is best known for his huge hit from 2018, \u201cOld Town Road,\u201d which merged country and hip-hop. It spent a record 19 weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nKnown for his genre-bending, innovating sounds and style, his first full studio album, 2021's \u201cMontero,\u201d went to No. 2 on the Billboard album chart and was nominated for a Grammy for album of the year.",
