      "feedback": "The analysis draft provides a solid overview of the current macroeconomic landscape, but it lacks depth in articulating the causal chains and market transmissions. To elevate the analysis to world-class quality, consider the following actionable edits: \n\n1. **Enhance Depth and Clarity**: Expand on the causal relationships between inflation, interest rates, and corporate debt levels. For instance, explain how rising interest rates could specifically impact companies with high debt-to-equity ratios like Progress Software, potentially leading to defaults or reduced investment capacity.\n\n2. **First-Principles Grounding**: Integrate first-principles analysis by discussing the implications of real rate differentials and terms of trade on inflation and corporate profitability. This will provide a more robust framework for understanding the economic dynamics at play.\n\n3. **Scenario Structure**: Develop a clearer scenario structure by outlining potential outcomes based on different inflation trajectories and Fed responses. For example, what might happen if inflation remains above 3% versus if it falls back to 2%?\n\n4. **Specificity of Catalysts**: Identify specific catalysts or triggers that could influence the economic outlook, such as upcoming Fed meetings, key inflation reports, or significant geopolitical events. \n\n5. **Quantification and Use of Data**: Incorporate more quantitative data and specific ranges to support your claims. For instance, when discussing the implications of the CPI increase, provide historical context or comparisons to previous inflationary periods.\n\n6. **Citation Density and Coverage**: Ensure that all critical sources are cited correctly and that any conflicting information is reconciled. For example, clarify how the differing perspectives on inflation from various analysts or institutions align or diverge.\n\nBy addressing these points, the analysis will not only align better with the multi-year structural focus but also provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the economic landscape.",
