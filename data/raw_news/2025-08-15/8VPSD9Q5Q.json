  "title": "Faster Social Security disability claims now cover 300 serious conditions",
  "description": "The Social Security Administration has expanded its expedited disability claims process to 300 conditions, adding 13 serious diagnoses to the list.",
  "content": "The Social Security Administration has added 13 new diseases and conditions to its list of disabilities, which earn those suffering serious medical issues a faster benefits application process.\n\nThose applying for Social Security Disability Insurance or Supplemental Security Income who have conditions on the Compassionate Allowances list, or CAL, have their applications processed more quickly, the agency says. Since the program started in 2008, more than 1.1 million people with severe disabilities have been approved via the expedited process, the SSA said in a news release dated Aug. 11.\n\n\u201cWe are constantly looking for ways to improve our disability programs and serve the public more effectively,\u201d said SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano in the news release. \"This is part of our broader commitment to making the disability determination process as responsive and compassionate as possible.\u201d\n\nThe addition of the 13 conditions brings the Compassionate Allowances list to 300 serious diseases and conditions that warrant an expedited benefits process. Here are the new conditions added:\n\n\"By adding these 13 conditions to the Compassionate Allowances list, we are helping more people with devastating diagnoses to quickly receive the support they need,\" Bisignano said.\n\nWho can apply for Social Security disability benefits?\n\nPeople who have been unable to work for a year (12 consecutive months) or more because of a disability can apply for Social Security Disability Insurance, the SSA says. Those whose disabilities are on the Compassionate Allowances list, will have their applications processed more quickly. Typically, SSDI applicants have a 5-month waiting period before payments begin in the sixth month after the agency approved an applicant's disability.\n\nSupplemental Security Income provides benefits for those with limited income or resources, those aged 65 or older and those who are blind or have a qualifying disability. Children with a qualifying disability can also get SSI, according to the agency's website. Applicants typically wait six to eight months for an initial decision after submitting their application, federal officials says.\n\nDuring the process of determining whether to approve benefits, the SSA must get applicants' medical records. In the case of CAL applicants, the agency will attempt to use technological means including electronic medical records to more quickly process the claim.\n\n\"The CAL initiative acts as a fast-track to those benefits for individuals who need them most,\" reported financial news site Investopedia.\n\nBut the expanse of the list runs counter to some other moves the Trump adminstration has made in regards to Social Security, said Jessica Mason, senior policy analyst for economic justice for National Partnership for Women & Families.\n\n\"Changes that help ease disabled people's access to their benefits can be beneficial. But in the bigger picture, this administration is laying off Social Security staff and just signed a budget law that goes after Medicaid and food assistance that disabled people rely on,\" Mason said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"In that context, tweaking the Compassionate Allowances list is a bit like rearranging deck chairs while setting the ship on fire. For disabled people and all of us to thrive, we need Social Security to have not only better processes but real investments in staffing and infrastructure, and to be paired with a stronger safety net across the board.\"\n\nMike Snider is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "Testing planned after TB case emerges at Santa Paula elementary school\n- Close contacts who were likely exposed will be tested.\n- A community meeting will be held Aug. 18.\n- Contagious period may have started before school let out for summer.\nA person at a Santa Paula elementary school has tested positive for tuberculosis disease, spurring public health and school efforts to determine who may have been exposed.\nThe case of the highly contagious, airborne disease involves McKevett Elementary Academy of Visual and Performing Arts, Ventura County public health officials said Aug. 14. They said they received the positive test result on Aug. 11, the first day of the school year.\nThe person was not at school on opening day but the symptoms started months earlier, raising concerns he or she could have been contagious before school let out for summer, said Ventura County Health Officer Dr. Uldine Castel.\n\"We don't know when they were initially infected,\" Castel said. She declined to identify whether the case involved an adult or a student, citing patient privacy laws. She also released no information on the person's condition.\nFamilies and staff at the school were notified of the possible exposure by the Santa Paula Unified School District.\nA public health team is working to identify students and staff who had close contact with the person. Testing is set to begin next week. School district officials said not everyone at McKevett will require testing.\nA community meeting to talk about testing and answer questions about TB will be held at 6:30 p.m. on Aug. 18 at Isbell Middle School, 221 South St., Santa Paula.\n\"We understand that hearing about any illness in a school community can be concerning,\" Santa Paula Unified School District Superintendent Jeffrey Weinstein said in a message to the school community. \"Please know that all classrooms and facilities at McKevett underwent deep cleaning this past summer. We want to assure you that the safety and well-being of our students and staff remain our highest priorities.\"\nTuberculosis can take as long as several months to emerge. It is a serious, treatable and slow-growing bacterial disease. It usually affects the lungs but can also affect other parts of the body. It is transmitted through microscopic droplets that enter the air when a person coughs or sneezes.\nPublic health officials emphasized the difference between tuberculosis infection and active disease. People with the disease are sick from germs that are active in their bodies. They can spread the infection. Their symptoms can include frequent coughing, fever, weight loss, night sweats and fatigue.\nPeople who are infected but don't have the disease are not ill and cannot spread the TB germ. About 1 of 10 people with the infection become sick with disease at some time in their life. The disease can be treated with oral medications.\nCastel said exposures at schools are fairly rare but have happened, citing cases involving Oxnard schools in 2018.\n\"Obviously when kids are involved, it is more concerning and everyone's alerts are up more,\" she said. \"But we are prepared and have everything in place to help everybody.\"\nPeople with questions can call a public health hotline at 805-385-9444.\nThe public can also find information at www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/TBCB.aspx or at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at www.cdc.gov/tb/index.html.\nTom Kisken covers health care and other news for the Ventura County Star.

Eugene's favorite jam band has played at Autzen a total of 10 times; their most recent return was in 2018, continuing the band's tradition of making music in the stadium.\nFor the game, The Duck Store has released a line of merch in conjunction with Class Trip, a company that specializes in Grateful Dead college merch. Tie-dye, \"steal your face\" logos, and dancing bears abound in the collection, appealing to Dead fans young and old.\n\"As far as I know, we've never done a collaboration with the Dead themselves,\" Alex Lyons, chief information officer of The Duck Store, said. \"We've had tie-dye in the past with our mascot, but this is the first collection we've done in tandem.\"\nHighlights include a green and yellow shirt with a dancing bear and Oregon Duck walking to Autzen, a green tie-dyed \"grateful ducks\" shirt, and a black UO dancing bear sweatshirt, all of which are available to order or pre-order at The Duck Store online.

      "text": "Young people always worry about Social Security. Older people are joining them.\nAmericans are worrying more about Social Security, and the Trump administration may be partly to blame.\nIn an AARP survey released July 22, only 36% of Americans voiced confidence in the future of the retirement trust fund, down from 43% in 2020.\nAnother July survey, from the nonprofit Alliance for Lifetime Income, found that 58% of older Americans fear Social Security cuts because of recent news about potential changes to the program.\n\u201cThese fears are not new. But I do think they are growing,\u201d said Jean Chatzky, an education fellow with the Alliance\u2019s Retirement Income Institute and CEO of HerMoney.\nHow soon will Social Security run out of money?\nFears of a Social Security shortfall have loomed for decades. Lately, though, the agency\u2019s fiscal plight seems to be getting worse.\nNew federal projections, released in June, show the combined Social Security trust funds will run short in 2034. That date is one year earlier than the Social Security Administration reported a year ago.\nThe Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, which pays benefits to retirees and their families, is fully funded only until 2033.\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s close enough in the viewfinder for even older people to think, \u2018Holy moly, what\u2019s going to happen to me?\u2019\u201d Chatzky said.\nAmericans young and old worry about Social Security\nYounger Americans tend to worry more about Social Security than older Americans. In the new AARP survey, 25% of people ages 18-49 voiced confidence in the program\u2019s future, compared with 48% of those 50 and older.\nThe new report from the Alliance for Lifetime Income is striking, because it shows heightened Social Security fears among older Americans.\nThe industry group enlisted IPSOS to conduct a nationally representative survey of 3,502 adults ages 45-75. Among the findings:\n- One-third of older Americans said they are thinking of claiming Social Security earlier than planned, in light of recent news\n- 52% of older consumers said they are less confident in Social Security now than five years ago. Only 6% are more confident.\n- 30% of retirement-age working adults, ages 61 to 65, said they are thinking of postponing retirement because of the current political and economic environment\nTrump, DOGE cuts have disrupted Social Security\nSocial Security has been in the headlines all year, and not just because of the coming shortfall.\nThe Trump administration has thrown the agency into upheaval, with a cascade of staff cuts, rule changes, website outages and leadership shuffles, a routine that played out across the federal bureaucracy under the cost-cutting eye of Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency. (Musk himself eventually bowed out.)\nBoth Trump and Musk sowed doubt in the integrity of the venerable benefits program. In a March speech before Congress, Trump spoke of \u201cshocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud\u201d in Social Security. Around the same time, Musk told podcaster Joe Rogan that Social Security was \u201cthe biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\u201d\nTaken together, the events seemed to shake public confidence. New benefit claims were up by more than 15% in March, compared with the same month a year ago.\n\u201cFearmongering has driven people to claim benefits earlier, \u2018cause they\u2019re afraid they\u2019re not going to claim benefits at all,\u201d said Leland Dudek, acting Social Security commissioner at the time, in a March public meeting.\nIs Trump undermining public faith in Social Security?\nSome Social Security watchdogs say the Trump administration has eroded public faith in the program.\n\u201cI think there\u2019s really been a sea change since January 20,\u201d said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting and expanding Social Security. \u201cI\u2019ve been working on this for half a century, and I\u2019ve never seen this kind of chaos and undoing of the administration of the program.\u201d\nThe notion that Social Security faces a shortfall suffuses the national conversation about retirement. Older Americans wonder if their monthly checks will go down, rather than up, during their golden years. Many younger Americans have doubled down on retirement savings, partly for fear that Social Security won\u2019t fully support them.\n\u201cWhat we find is, whenever Social Security is in the headlines, it strikes fear and anxiety into the hearts of so many, especially those who rely so heavily on Social Security,\u201d said Ramsey Alwin, CEO of the nonprofit National Council on Aging.\nFaith in the future of Social Security hinges partly on political party. The new AARP survey found that Republicans were more likely than Democrats to express confidence in the program\u2019s future, by a margin of 44% to 32%. During the Obama administration, by contrast, AARP found that Democrats voiced more faith in Social Security than Republicans.\nSocial Security administrators, for their part, have sometimes blamed the news media for stirring up public doubt about the agency\u2019s stability. In March, they took the unusual step of posting a press release to contradict media reports about the closure of Social Security field offices.\nAARP issued a rare rebuke of Social Security administrators\nBut not all reports of Social Security instability have come from the news media. In February, AARP, the powerful interest group for older Americans, issued a rare public rebuke of the agency.\n\u201cAARP is hearing from thousands of older Americans confused and concerned about their Social Security payments, the status of Social Security field offices, and inexcusably long wait times on the phone to get their questions answered,\u201d said Nancy LeaMond, AARP executive vice president.\nIn March, AARP members peppered Congress with 2 million messages and calls about their Social Security concerns.\nAARP leaders touched on that nerve in a July 22 press conference about the new survey, released to coincide with Social Security\u2019s 90th anniversary.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t afford for politicians to play games with the future of Social Security,\u201d said Myechia Minter-Jordan, CEO of AARP. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll fight as hard and as long as we need to, to ensure that Social Security remains the economic bedrock of retirement for generations to come.\u201d"

      "text": "2026 Social Security COLA estimated at 2.7%. Why seniors still fall behind.\nSocial Security recipients are still forecast to see a 2.7% bump in their monthly checks next year, the same as last month's estimate, based on the latest inflation report, a new analysis showed.\nThe Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), the index used to calculate the annual adjustment to Social Security benefits, increased 2.5% in July. Overall inflation rose 2.7%, flat from June. The Federal Reserve's inflation goal is 2%.\nThe annual adjustment, also known as the cost-of-living-adjustment (COLA), to Social Security benefits is meant to help seniors maintain their purchasing power over the years, but that hasn't always worked, said Mary Johnson, an independent Social Security and Medicare policy analyst.\n\"Prices on the items that older Americans use the most remain elevated,\" she said. Categories that see higher levels of inflation than the overall rate include housing, medical costs, transportation and groceries.\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 most recent weighting for older consumers, these categories when added together comprise more than 85% of household budgets of consumers age 62 and older.\nWhy is July COLA estimate important?\nThe actual Social Security COLA that the Social Security Administration typically announces in October is based on inflation data in the third quarter, or July, August and September. So July is the first month that will be considered for the 2026 COLA calculation.\nHere's how COLA is calculated: CPI-W for July, August and September are averaged, and then compared against the average of the same three months in the prior year. The percentage of difference is what the Social Security Administration uses to determine the annual COLA adjustment.\nCPI-W largely reflects the broad index the Labor Department releases each month, although it sometimes differs slightly. Last month, the overall consumer price index rose 2.7% and the index for urban wage earners increased 2.5%.\nSocial Security's future\nThe Social Security Office of the Chief Actuary estimates President Donald Trump's tax package moves the insolvency date for the Social Security trust fund forward by about three months from 2033 to 2032.\nPart of that is due to the increase in the standard deduction for those age 65 and older from 2025 through 2028. The higher standard deduction means less overall tax liability for most Social Security beneficiaries, but it also means lower revenues received by the Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds from the taxation of benefits.\n\u201cCongressional legislators did not include any provision to replace these program funds that were formerly earmarked for the payment of current Social Security and Medicare benefits,\u201d Johnson said.\nAccording to Social Security Trustees, a 25.8% cut in 2034 benefits would be necessary. Johnson calculates a 25.8% reduction could cut lifetime Social Security income for beneficiaries at an average age of 65 in 2025 by $176,400 over a 25-year retirement.\nHow many people receive Social Security benefits?\nIn July, 74.36 million people received Social Security, according to the Social Security Administration. These beneficiaries include retired workers, disabled workers, survivors of deceased workers and those receiving Supplemental Security Income.\nThe average monthly benefit was $1,863.12 in July.\nMedora Lee is a money, markets, and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

The initiative is intended to expedite the process of obtaining disability Social Security benefits for individuals with the most serious afflictions.\nThe newly added conditions are:\n- Au-Kline Syndrome\n- Bilateral Anophthalmia\n- Carey-Fineman-Ziter Syndrome\n- Harlequin Ichthyosis \u2013 Child\n- Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation\n- LMNA-related Congenital Muscular Dystrophy\n- Progressive Muscular Atrophy\n- Pulmonary Amyloidosis \u2013 AL Type\n- Rasmussen Encephalitis\n- Thymic Carcinoma\n- Turnpenny-Fry Syndrome\n- WHO Grade III Meningiomas\n- Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim Syndrome\nThe CAL list now includes 300 conditions, including cancers, early onset Alzheimer's disease, and ALS. Over 1 million people with severe disabilities have been approved through this process since the CAL initiative began in 2008, according to an agency press release.\n\u201cBy adding these 13 conditions to the Compassionate Allowances list, we are helping more people with devastating diagnoses to quickly receive the support they need,\u201d said SSA Commissioner Frank Frank J. Bisignano in the release.\n\u201cThis is part of our broader commitment to making the disability determination process as responsive and compassionate as possible.\u201d\nIt typically takes three to five months for the SSA to make a disability benefits decision once paperwork is submitted, according to the agency. The CAL initiative acts as a fast-track to those benefits for individuals who need them most.\nIn order to be eligible for CAL, an individual\u2019s disability must make them unable to work, is expected to last at least 12 months and will result in death.\nSocial Security must obtain medical records from those applying for disability benefits in order to make an accurate determination. SSA can accept electronic medical records through the Health IT program to speed up the claims process."
