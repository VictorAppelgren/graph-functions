      "feedback": "Your draft fails the acceptance gate because it centers on **Tesla equity (TSLA)**, which is not a canonical handle in the Argos system. To meet the criteria, re‑frame the view around a canonical asset that Tesla’s legal risk materially affects—**S&P 500 (spx)** or **Nasdaq 100 (ndx)**—and explicitly state the sign and magnitude. For example: “spx is likely to decline 3–5 bp over the next 0–3 weeks (negative bias) due to the 2025‑08‑29 Miami verdict (LJZYDXVL3) and the NHTSA inquiry (LJZYDXVL3); a favorable settlement or regulatory ruling would invalidate the downside and lift spx by 1–2 bp.” Include the catalyst window (verdict announced 2025‑08‑29, NHTSA inquiry same day, next earnings late September) and an invalidation trigger (settlement or favorable ruling). Remove all references to “Tesla equity” as a standalone asset, add the required canonical handle mapping, and cite the source IDs (LJZYDXVL3, B1KYJ1GPU) for the price impact. This will satisfy the mapping, catalyst, and quantitative requirements while keeping the analysis concise and actionable.",
