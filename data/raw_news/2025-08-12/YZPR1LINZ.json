  "title": "Emmerdale's Joe Absolom hints he's leaving soap after just two months",
  "description": "ITV Emmerdale actor Joe Absolom has hinted that he could be about to leave the soap after just two months playing villain Ray",
  "content": "Emmerdale newcomer Joe Absolom has hinted that he could be departing the ITV soap very soon. The 46-year-old former EastEnders star joined the cast as drug dealer antagonist Ray, making his on-screen debut in June. Thus far, limited details have emerged about the latest villain to arrive in the Dales, though audiences have witnessed him engaging with Dylan Penders (Fred Kettle), who recently returned following a rehabilitation period. Ray appears to have targeted April Windsor (Amelia Flanagan) as she grows closer to Dylan, but it seems the character may not remain for an extended period. During Tuesday's (August 12) edition of GMB, presenter Richard Madeley observed: \"We all know television is changing a lot.\", reports the Daily Star.\n\n\"Viewing figures across the board are well down to what they were when you were on EastEnders. \"You know, 15, 16 million a night. What is it now? Two million a night? It's really changed. Do you think soaps have got a long term future?\". Suggesting his Emmerdale contract concludes shortly, Joe quipped: \"Well, I hope they do until November but I think its a very good point. \"They way we watch television is different. When I did EastEnders there wasn't anything else to do. \"I've got kids now and they won't sit down at 7pm and watch telly in the same way I did and my friends did.\n\n\"I think there's a duty to find where television now fits into the world and it is changing. \"With streaming and stuff like that, I don't know if it's going to go on forever because that does get a little boring.\" Kate Garraway, the presenter, chimed in: \"Maybe it will come back around again.\" Joe retorted: \"I think there will ok and there will always be a place for it but whether it's where it once once was I don't know.\"\n\nThe actor boasts an impressive portfolio of television, theatre and film roles, including appearances in Doc Martin, The Bay and most recently portraying Braden Moore in Code of Silence. He portrayed Matthew Rose in EastEnders from 1997 until 2000, becoming embroiled in one of the most talked-about soap storylines of the 90s. In February 1999, Steve Owen (Martin Kemp) murdered his girlfriend, Saskia Duncan (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor), and Matthew was wrongfully accused of the crime. This storyline gripped the nation, with media outlets initiating nationwide campaigns for Matthew's release as he was convicted of manslaughter. The character has never made a comeback to Albert Square. Emmerdale airs weeknights on ITV1 at 7.30pm and available to stream from 7am on ITVX and Good Morning Britain airs weekdays on ITV1 and ITVX at 6am",
