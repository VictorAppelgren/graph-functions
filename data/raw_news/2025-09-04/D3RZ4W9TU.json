  "description": "Shares of American Eagle closed Wednesday at $13.62, then shot up higher after-hours and in early Thursday trading following strong quarterly results.",
  "content": "American Eagle stock soared by more than 24% higher in pre-market trading Thursday after the clothing chain credited a risqu\u00e9 Sydney Sweeney ad campaign with supercharging sales \u2014 even as the spots sparked outrage online and in Washington.\n\nExecutives told Wall Street analysts that the campaign featuring the \u201cEuphoria\u201d star \u2014 billed as \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans\u201d \u2014 drove record traffic and unprecedented new customer sign-ups.\n\n\u201cSweeney is a winner, and in just six weeks, the campaign has generated unprecedented new customer acquisition,\u201d chief marketing officer Craig Brommers said on the company\u2019s earnings call.\n\nShares of American Eagle Outfitters closed Wednesday at $13.62, then shot up higher after-hours and in early Thursday trading following strong quarterly results.\n\nAmerican Eagle said the Sweeney collaboration sold out in a week, with some items gone in a day. Her denim ads have racked up more than 150 million social media views, turning her into the face of the brand\u2019s revival.\n\nBut the campaign also ignited a political firestorm. One spot shows Sweeney in front of a billboard reading, \u201cSydney Sweeney has great genes,\u201d with the word \u201cgenes\u201d crossed out and replaced with \u201cjeans.\u201d\n\nAnother ad features her quipping: \u201cGenes are passed down from parents to offspring. My jeans are blue.\u201d\n\nSome online critics blasted the gimmick as racially coded, accusing the company of celebrating Sweeney\u2019s white heritage as a beauty ideal.\n\nThe backlash spilled into partisan warfare, with Republicans rushing to her defense.\n\nPresident Donald Trump jumped in on Aug. 4, praising Sweeney on Truth Social.\n\n\u201cSydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the HOTTEST ad out there,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s for American Eagle, and the jeans are \u2018flying [off] the shelves.\u2019 Go get \u2019em Sydney. Being WOKE is for losers, being Republican is what you want to be.\u201d\n\nVice President JD Vance mocked liberals on the \u201cRuthless\u201d podcast, saying: \u201cMy political advice to the Democrats is continue to tell everybody who thinks Sydney Sweeney is attractive is a Nazi. That appears to be their actual strategy.\u201d\n\nNo prominent Democrats have weighed in, but social media brawls over the ads dominated X and TikTok in August, keeping American Eagle front and center in a crowded retail landscape.\n\nThe publicity paid off at the cash register. American Eagle reported second-quarter earnings of 45 cents a share, up 15% year-over-year, with operating profit rising 2% to $103 million.\n\nThough total revenue dipped 1% to $1.28 billion, executives said the campaign offset weak foot traffic and boosted brand awareness across Gen Z shoppers.\n\n\u201cThe fall season is off to a positive start,\u201d CEO Jay Schottenstein told investors.\n\n\u201cFueled by stronger product offerings and the success of recent marketing campaigns with Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce, we have seen an uptick in customer awareness, engagement and comparable sales.\u201d\n\nThe company said its partnerships with Sweeney and Kelce had generated a staggering 40 billion impressions to date. The Kelce collaboration \u2014 announced just one day after his engagement to Taylor Swift became public \u2014 also helped juice attention, though Wall Street credited Sweeney as the breakout driver.\n\nInvestors cheered the strategy. The stock\u2019s double-digit surge was among the biggest retail pops this earnings season, signaling traders see American Eagle\u2019s celebrity gambits as paying off even amid broader retail weakness.\n\nAmerican Eagle executives are leaning in to the trend, saying they are already planning more projects with Sweeney later this year \u2014 betting her star power will keep denim sales hot into the holiday season.\n\nThe Post has sought comment from American Eagle, Sydney Sweeney and her representatives.",

      "text": "Boar\u2019s Head is secretly paying out millions to dozens of victims of last year\u2019s listeria outbreak\nBoar\u2019s Head has paid $4 million to a Long Island widow after her husband died from eating tainted liverwurst \u2014 one of dozens of hush-hush payouts tied to a deadly listeria outbreak at the company\u2019s Virginia plant, The Post has learned.\nRobert Hamilton, 73, was rushed to Nassau University Medical Center on July 12, 2024, with stomach pains, diarrhea and high fever \u2014 just days after eating a Boar\u2019s Head sandwich. He died six days later.\nNow, his wife of 55 years, Kathleen Hamilton, is among a growing number of grieving families and victims who have gotten a fat check from the iconic deli meats brand \u2014 as the 120-year-old company scrambles to put the scandal behind it.\n\u201cThey want to keep the internal factors and root cause of this outbreak quiet,\u201d said food safety lawyer Brendan Flaherty, whose firm has secured payouts in over a dozen cases. \u201cThey may also realize they need to take responsibility for the lives that have been shattered.\u201d\nThe deadly outbreak has been linked to grossly unsanitary conditions at Boar\u2019s Head\u2019s shuttered Jarratt, Va. facility \u2014 where federal inspectors found mold, flying insects, rusting equipment, clogged drains, and condensation dripping on food prep areas.\nAt least 61 people across 19 states were infected \u2014 and 10 died, including Hamilton.\n\u201cThe facts in this case are explosive,\u201d said food safety attorney Ron Simon, who represents several victims. \u201cEvery day they don\u2019t put this behind them, it hurts their brand.\u201d\nBehind the scenes, Boar\u2019s Head and its insurers have been cutting quick settlements with victims \u2014 including pregnant women, elderly customers, and spouses who lost their loved ones \u2014 in a desperate bid to keep the lawsuits and headlines from piling up.\n\u201cI am not to comment,\u201d said Sue Fleming, an 88-year-old, retired psychotherapist from High Ridge, Missouri who last year had spoken to the Associated Press after she fell ill from eating her favorite Boar\u2019s Head liverwurst sandwich \u2013 \u201con bread with lettuce, a little mayo, a slice of pickle.\u201d\nFleming \u2013 who spent nine days in the hospital and 11 days in rehabilitation last summer after what doctors confirmed was a listeria infection \u2013 declined to confirm to The Post whether she had settled.\n\u201cBoar\u2019s Head has taken a number of steps to responsibly address last year\u2019s recall, including a series of concrete, organization-wide initiatives to further strengthen our food safety processes and protocols. This also includes working to reach agreements with consumers who were affected,\u201d a company spokesperson said in a statement to The Post.\nDespite the deaths, Boar\u2019s Head also recently confirmed that it\u2019s preparing to reopen the Jarratt facility, which has been closed for more than a year.\n\u201cOur dedication to food safety is unwavering, and we continuously invest in our processes and facilities to uphold standards of quality and safety for our consumers,\u201d the spokesperson added.\nIn Hamilton\u2019s case, a $4 million settlement was filed in federal court but wasn\u2019t sealed \u2014 despite a request by her attorney, the high-profile food safety lawyer Bill Marler, to protect her privacy. The widow had originally sued for $20 million.\nMarler, who represented Hamilton, has secured 11 confidential settlements tied to the outbreak. He declined to comment on specifics.\nIn another case, the company \u2013 a privately-owned business with an estimated $3 billion in yearly revenue \u2013 quietly forked over $3.1 million to some 66,000 customers who never got refunds for products recalled after the outbreak.\n\u201cIt settled even before the court certified our case as a class action,\u201d the lead attorney Jason Sultzer told The Post.\nBoar\u2019s Head\u2019s race to resolve the cases isn\u2019t typical, according to lawyers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s very unusual for a company this large to settle quickly,\u201d said Flaherty. \u201cMost big companies make you jump through hoops. Boar\u2019s Head seems to want these gone \u2014 fast.\u201d\nStill, dozens of cases are unresolved, and more are trickling in as the statute of limitations for food-borne illness claims ticks on. By some estimates, half of the 61 confirmed victims haven\u2019t filed lawsuits yet.\n\u201cSome [victims] are elderly and they might call many months after the fact,\u201d said Flaherty. \u201cWe just signed a 19-year-old woman who was undergoing cancer treatment when she got sick.\u201d\nSimon, who represented the family of Gunter Morgenstein \u2014 another high-profile fatality \u2014 said the company is clearly motivated by damage control.\nOther remaining cases include that of 68-year-old Angel Cloughly, of Monmouth County, NJ, who ate a Boar\u2019s Head liverwurst sandwich in July 2024. She was hospitalized for weeks and now requires daily injections for life, according to her lawsuit.\nJeffrey Scott Cox of Huntsville, Ala., ate a bologna sandwich in June 2024 and ended up in the hospital, eventually placed on a ventilator. The 58-year-old father of six \u2013 also a grandfather to four children \u2013 died in February, six months after his suit was originally filed.\nMeanwhile, 73-year-old Robert Renavitz of Clifton, NJ passed away in June 2024 after eating Boar\u2019s Head liverwurst. His wife of 51 years is suing not only Boar\u2019s Head but Stop & Shop, where her husband bought the tainted meat."

      "text": "Sydney Sweeney reacts to online fodder after American Eagle ad backlash\nThe internet may not always be a euphoric place for Sydney Sweeney, but the 27-year-old star knows that keeping up on the online chatter is sometimes necessary.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to have a finger on the pulse of what people are saying, because everything is a conversation with the audience,\u201d Sweeney told The Wall Street Journal about navigating internet feedback in an interview published Wednesday, Aug. 20.\nIn June, the \u201cAnyone But You\u201d actress faced backlash for her partnership with Dr. Squatch. At the time, Sweeney released a limited-edition line of bar soaps made from her bathwater.\n\u201cIt was mainly the girls making comments about it, which I thought was really interesting,\u201d she explained to the publication. \u201cThey all loved the idea of Jacob Elordi\u2019s bathwater.\u201d\nThe \u201cEuphoria\u201d actor, 28, starred in \u201cSaltburn\u201d opposite Barry Keoghan in 2023. In one scene, the Irish actor\u2019s character Oliver drinks bathwater after Elordi\u2019s Felix had pleasured himself in the tub.\nFans ended up creating a \u201cBathwater Candle\u201d inspired by the moment.\nSweeney\u2019s bathwater, however, didn\u2019t garner the same kind of response.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s more fun to see everyone else talk about it,\u201d she told E! News at the time, noting that the product came to be because \u201cI pitched it.\u201d\nLast month, Sweeney found herself enthralled in another controversial moment following an American Eagle partnership.\nThe \u201cEcho Valley\u201d vet\u2019s \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans\u201d campaign sparked a debate about race and beauty standards.\nCritics focused on the use of the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed star.\nMany social media users felt the ad promoted eugenics.\n\u201cGenes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color,\u201d Sweeney said in the American Eagle video. \u201cMy jeans are blue.\u201d\nMarcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, revealed how the controversy should have been handled.\n\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional. Either one of the three aren\u2019t good,\u201d he told the Associated Press.\n\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\u201d Megyn Kelly wrote on X of the controversy.\nAmerican Eagle quickly defended the company\u2019s campaign.\n\u201c\u2018Sydney Sweeney has great jeans\u2019 is and always was about the jeans,\u201d the clothing brand wrote in an Instagram statement on Aug. 1. \u201cHer jeans. Her story. We\u2019ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone.\u201d\nWhile the young starlet has yet to address the drama, Sweeney did talk about her partnership with the brand.\n\u201cI am a sweats girl,\u201d she confessed to People in July. \u201cBut yesterday I wore a pair of American Eagle jeans on a plane, and I was like, \u2018Oh, this is great. They\u2019re so comfy.'\u201d\nFinding out she was the new face of American Eagle\u2019s latest denim campaign was a surreal moment for Sweeney.\n\u201cI was freaking out because I was like, \u2018This is perfect,\u2019 and I was so excited,\u201d Sweeney gushed, adding that she\u2019s been a lifelong fan of their jeans. \u201cWhen they were like, \u2018We want it to be a denim campaign,\u2019 I was through the roof. I was like, \u2018This is it. This is Syd. I will be able to bring this to life. You have no idea.'\u201d"

      "text": "Paramount in talks to buy Bari Weiss\u2019 Free Press for up to $200M, give her senior editorial role at CBS News\nParamount is preparing to shell out as much as $200 million for Bari Weiss\u2019 buzzy media venture, The Free Press \u2014 and hand her the keys to help steer CBS News \u2014 in a move that\u2019s rattling an already shaken news division still reeling from the $8 billion Skydance-Paramount mega-merger.\nWeiss, the former New York Times opinion page editor who launched The Free Press in 2022, is reportedly in line for a senior editorial role at CBS News as part of a deal that would fold her outlet into the new Paramount, according to the Puck newsletter.\nParamount declined to comment, but Puck media reporter Dylan Byers pegged the potential purchase price between $100 million and $200 million, with sources saying the talks are in their final stages.\nThe deal comes on the heels of last month\u2019s blockbuster merger between David Ellison\u2019s Skydance Media and Paramount Global, which ended decades of Redstone family control and put CBS and CBS News firmly under Ellison\u2019s watch.\nThe FCC signed off on the transaction after Ellison agreed to sweeping changes at CBS News, including installing an ombudsman to police bias, dismantling DEI programs and promising to elevate \u201cviewpoint diversity.\u201d\nThose concessions have already rattled the newsroom. One CBS insider told Fox Business that the new ombudsman amounted to a \u201chall monitor,\u201d while former anchors have publicly warned that CBS News\u2019 tradition of independent reporting could be in jeopardy.\nNow the prospect of Weiss \u2014 a sharp-tongued critic of progressive orthodoxy who quit the Times after blasting the paper\u2019s \u201cilliberal environment\u201d \u2014 stepping into a leadership role has only heightened tensions, according to reports.\nWeiss has carved out a reputation for challenging both the left and the right, building The Free Press into a high-profile, subscriber-driven platform that publishes essays, interviews and investigative work outside the traditional media lanes.\nHer potential arrival at CBS News would mark her most prominent mainstream role since leaving the Times.\nThe timing is no accident. As part of the Skydance-Paramount merger, Ellison has been under pressure to prove he can modernize CBS News and reverse years of ratings decline.\nHis $8 billion takeover was billed as a bet on revitalizing Paramount\u2019s content pipeline, but CBS News \u2014 long the crown jewel of American broadcast journalism \u2014 became the flashpoint in Washington during the regulatory review.\nFCC officials grilled Ellison\u2019s team over CBS\u2019s coverage, ultimately conditioning approval on the creation of the ombudsman\u2019s office and the elimination of DEI mandates.\nThe Paramount-Skydance merger was approved after Paramount agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by President Trump against CBS News over a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with Kamala Harris that he says was deceptively edited.\nParamount has not commented on the talks, and Weiss has kept quiet publicly.\nThe Post has also sought comment from Weiss."

      "text": "American Eagle \u2018almost paralyzed by body positivity\u2019 before it launched \u2018sultry\u2019 Sydney Sweeney ads\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters has made a bold, divisive bet on its \u201csultry\u201d Sydney Sweeney ads \u2014 but only after its commitment to the \u201cbody positivity\u201d movement started to falter, experts told The Post.\nA decade ago, the mall-based chain\u2019s 20-year-old lingerie brand Aerie famously took off as millennials shunned Victoria\u2019s Secret and its leggy, angel-winged supermodels in favor of Aerie\u2019s ads featuring ordinary women and diverse body types.\nBut recently, American Eagle\u2019s flagging sales show that \u201cinclusive fashion\u201d has its limits \u2014 especially after the election of President Trump, experts say.\n\u201cThey were almost paralyzed by their body positivity movement and were cautious about coming across too sexy,\u201d according to retail analyst Gabriella Santaniello, who heads up A-Line Partners.\nIn recent months, the retailer has been pivoting to more provocative looks \u2014 even before the Sweeney campaign rocked the internet late last month, Santaniello said.\nString bikinis and \u201ccheeky bottoms\u201d that expose more of women\u2019s butts, for example, were previously only available on American Eagle\u2019s website, but started cropping up in its stores earlier this year, she noted.\nSusan Scafidi, director of the Fashion Law Institute, has likewise noticed \u201cedgier\u201d looks and \u201cmore sultry styling. \u201cThis means featuring fewer boxy t-shirts and more cropped camisoles,\u201d she said.\nWhat\u2019s more \u2014 unlike competitors including Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister, and the Gap \u2014 some pages on American Eagle\u2019s website have lately shown models going braless under various tops \u2014 and they aren\u2019t always subtle about it.\n\u201cAll of the teen retailers shy away from the nipple,\u201d Santaniello said. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so odd that they\u2019re going for it.\u201d\nThen, in late July, came the Sweeney spots. In one video, the \u201cWhite Lotus\u201d and \u201cEuphoria\u201d star tinkers under the hood of a vintage Mustang GT350 before slamming it shut, wiping her hands on the butt of her jeans \u2014 and peeling off in a cloud of burning rubber.\nDays later, President Trump gushed that the ads were \u201chot\u201d and \u201cfantastic\u201d after he learned Sweeney was a registered Republican. The company\u2019s shares surged 23% on Trump\u2019s comment, drawing comparisons to meme stocks.\n\u201cThey had to do something different,\u201d said Hitha Herzog, a fashion management professor at Parsons School of Design. \u201cWe have a conservative president in office and we are seeing conversations that skew away from body positivity, inclusion and diversity.\n\u201cAmerican Eagle has always been good about knowing where the conversations are going,\u201d Herzog added.\nTraffic to American Eagle\u2019s US website soared following the campaign\u2019s rollout on July 23, rising more than 60% on July 28 compared to the same day last year, according to data and insights company Consumer Edge.\nMeanwhile, however, left-wing critics seized upon the campaign\u2019s tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans\u201d. In one clip, Sweeney explains that genes \u201coften determin[e] traits like hair color, personality and even eye color,\u201d before declaring, \u201cMy jeans are blue.\u201d\nAn ensuing fracas claimed the ads were promoting Nazi ideology, calling for boycotts of the 48-year-old company. According to a survey this week by Axios and Generation Lab, 39% of young women and 42% of Democrats said the ads made them less likely to buy American Eagle jeans.\nIn the week of Aug. 3, foot traffic at American Eagle stores dropped 8.9% on top of a 3.9% decline the previous week \u2014 far steeper than drops at rival chains including Abercrombie and the Gap, according to Pass_by.\n\u201cWhen a brand sees momentum stall so sharply, it often reflects a reputational or cultural factor,\u201d said James Ewen, vice president of marketing for Pass_by.\nAmerican Eagle posted its only message about the ad so far on Aug. 1 on its Instagram account.\n\u201cSydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story. We\u2019ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone,\u201d the company said."

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.

      "text": "American Eagle\u2019s \u2018good jeans\u2019 ads with Sydney Sweeney spark a debate on race, beauty standards\nU.S. fashion retailer American Eagle Outfitters wanted to make a splash with its new advertising campaign starring 27-year-old actor Sydney Sweeney. The ad blitz included \u201cclever, even provocative language\u201d and was \u201cdefinitely going to push buttons,\u201d the company\u2019s chief marketing officer told trade media outlets.\nIt has. The question now is whether some of the public reactions the fall denim campaign produced is what American Eagle intended.\nTitled \u201cSydney Sweeney has great jeans,\u201d the campaign sparked a debate about race, Western beauty standards, and the backlash to \u201cwoke\u201d American politics and culture. Most of the negative reception focused on videos that used the word \u201cgenes\u201d instead of \u201cjeans\u201d when discussing the blonde-haired, blue-eyed actor known for the HBO series \u201cEuphoria\u201d and \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d\nSome critics saw the wordplay as a nod, either unintentional or deliberate, to eugenics, a discredited theory that held humanity could be improved through selective breeding for certain traits.\nMarcus Collins, an assistant professor of marketing at the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business, said the criticism could have been avoided if the ads showed models of various races making the \u201cgenes\u201d pun.\n\u201cYou can either say this was ignorance, or this was laziness, or say that this is intentional,\u201d Collins said. \u201cEither one of the three aren\u2019t good.\u201d\nOther commenters accused detractors of reading too much into the campaign\u2019s message.\n\u201cI love how the leftist meltdown over the Sydney Sweeney ad has only resulted in a beautiful white blonde girl with blue eyes getting 1000x the exposure for her \u2018good genes,\u2019\u201d former Fox News host Megyn Kelly wrote Tuesday on X.\nAmerican Eagle didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.\nA snapshot of American Eagle\nThe ad blitz comes as the teen retailer, like many merchants, wrestles with sluggish consumer spending and higher costs from tariffs. American Eagle reported that total sales were down 5% for its February-April quarter compared to a year earlier.\nA day after Sweeney was announced as the company\u2019s latest celebrity collaborator, American Eagle\u2019s stock closed more than 4% up. Shares were volatile this week and trading nearly 2% down Wednesday.\nLike many trendy clothing brands, American Eagle has to differentiate itself from other mid-priced chains with a famous face or by saying something edgy, according to Alan Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy Metaforce.\nAdamson said the Sweeney campaign shares a lineage with Calvin Klein jeans ads from 1980 that featured a 15-year-old Brooke Shields saying, \u201cYou want to know what comes in between me and my Calvins? Nothing.\u201d Some TV networks declined to air the spots because of its suggestive double entendre and Shields\u2019 age.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same playbook: a very hot model saying provocative things shot in an interesting way,\u201d Adamson said.\nBillboards, Instagram and Snapchat\nChief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told industry news website Retail Brew last week that \u201cSydney is the biggest get in the history of American Eagle,\u201d and the company would promote the partnership in a way that matched.\nThe campaign features videos of Sweeney wearing slouchy jeans in various settings. She will appear on 3-D billboards in Times Square and elsewhere, speaking to users on Snapchat and Instagram, and in an AI-enabled try-on feature.\nAmerican Eagle also plans to launch a limited edition Sydney jean to raise awareness of domestic violence, with sales proceeds going to a nonprofit crisis counseling service.\nIn a news release, the company noted \u201cSweeney\u2019s girl next door charm and main character energy \u2013 paired with her ability to not take herself too seriously \u2013 is the hallmark of this bold, playful campaign.\u201d\nJeans, genes and their many meanings\nIn one video, Sweeney walks toward an American Eagle billboard of her and the tagline \u201cSydney Sweeney has great genes.\u201d She crosses out \u201cgenes\u201d and replaces it with \u201cjeans.\u201d\nBut what critics found the most troubling was a teaser video in which Sweeney says, \u201cGenes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.\u201d\nThe video appeared on American Eagle\u2019s Facebook page and other social media channels but is not part of the campaign.\nWhile remarking that someone has good genes is sometimes used as a compliment, the phrase also has sinister connotations. Eugenics gained popularity in early 20th century America, and Nazi Germany embraced it to carry out Adolf Hitler\u2019s plan for an Aryan master race.\nCivil rights activists have noted signs of eugenics regaining a foothold through the far right\u2019s promotion of the \u201cgreat replacement theory,\u201d a racist ideology that alleges a conspiracy to diminish the influence of white people.\nShalini Shankar, a cultural and linguistic anthropologist at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, said she had problems with American Eagle\u2019s \u201cgenes\u201d versus \u201cjeans\u201d because it exacerbates a limited concept of beauty.\n\u201cAmerican Eagle, I guess, wants to rebrand itself for a particular kind of white privileged American,\u201d Shankar said. \u201cAnd that is the kind of aspirational image they want to circulate for people who want to wear their denim.\u201d\nA cultural shift in advertising\nMany critics compared the American Eagle ad to a misstep by Pepsi in 2017, when it released a TV ad that showed model Kendall Jenner offer a can of soda to a police officer while ostensibly stepping away from a photo shoot to join a crowd of protesters.\nViewers mocked the spot for appearing to trivialize protests of police killings of Black people. Pepsi apologized and pulled the ad.\nThe demonstrations that followed the 2020 killing of George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis pushed many U.S. companies to make their advertising better reflect consumers of all races.\nSome marketers say they\u2019ve observed another shift since President Donald Trump returned to office and moved to abolish all federal DEI programs and policies.\nJazmin Burrell, founder of brand consulting agency Lizzie Della Creative Strategies, said she\u2019s noticed while shopping with her cousin more ads and signs that prominently feature white models.\n\u201cI can see us going back to a world where diversity is not really the standard expectation in advertising,\u201d Burrell said.\nAmerican Eagle\u2019s past and future\nAmerican Eagle has been praised for diverse marketing in the past, including creating a denim hijab in 2017 and offering its Aerie lingerie brand in a wide range of sizes. A year ago, the company released a limited edition denim collection with tennis star Coco Gauff.\nThe retailer has an ongoing diversity, equity and inclusion program that is primarily geared toward employees. Two days before announcing the Sweeney campaign, American Eagle named the latest recipients of its scholarship award for employees who are driving anti-racism, equality and social justice initiatives.\nMarketing experts offer mixed opinions on whether the attention surrounding \u201cgood jeans\u201d will be good for business.\n\u201cThey were probably thinking that this is going to be their moment,\u201d Myles Worthington, the founder and CEO of marketing and creative agency WORTHI. \u201cBut this is doing the opposite and deeply distorting their brand.\u201d\nMelissa Murphy, a marketing professor at Carnegie Mellon University\u2019s Tepper School of Business, said she liked certain parts of the campaign but hoped it would be expanded to showcase people besides Sweeney for the \u201csake of the brand.\u201d\nOther experts say the buzz is good even if it\u2019s not uniformly positive.\n\u201cIf you try to follow all the rules, you\u2019ll make lots of people happy, but you\u2019ll fail,\u201d Adamson said. \u201cThe rocket won\u2019t take off. \u201d"

The campaign, featuring a pun on \u201cgenes/jeans,\u201d sparked political backlash and social media debate, with Trump and other Republicans praising it while critics accused it of racial messaging. The ad\u2019s success, combined with a broader push for celebrity partnerships, has positioned American Eagle as a high\u2011profile retail play amid a weak retail environment.",
