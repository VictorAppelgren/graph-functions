  "title": "Police chief orders more cooperation with immigration agents as federal activity takes root in D.C.",
  "description": "The police chief\u2019s order establishes that Metropolitan Police Department officers may now share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody.",
  "content": "The changes, which raise collaboration between the two forces in notable ways, erodes the district\u2019s long-standing policy against cooperating with civil immigration enforcement. They are effective immediately.\n\nThe police chief\u2019s order establishes that Metropolitan Police Department officers may now share information with immigration agencies regarding people not in custody \u2014 such as someone involved in a traffic stop or checkpoint. MPD officers may also provide \u201ctransportation for federal immigration employees and detained subject,\u201d the order states.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Washington, D.C., police chief stepped up cooperation between her officers and federal immigration officials as President Donald Trump\u2019s law enforcement takeover of the nation\u2019s capital took root Thursday. National Guard troops watched over some of the world\u2019s most renowned landmarks and Humvees took up position in front of the busy main train station.\n\nMayor Muriel Bowser, walking a tightrope between the Republican White House and the constituency of her largely Democratic city, was out of town Thursday for a family commitment in Martha\u2019s Vineyard but would be back Friday, her office said.\n\nIn a city tense from days of ramp-up toward federal law enforcement intervention, volunteers helped homeless people leave long-standing encampments \u2014 to where, exactly, was often unclear. Trump told reporters that he was pleased at how the operation \u2014 and, now, its direct link with his immigration-control efforts \u2014 was unfolding.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a very positive thing, I have heard that just happened,\u201d Trump said of Police Chief Pamela Smith\u2019s order. \u201cThat\u2019s a great step. That\u2019s a great step if they\u2019re doing that.\u201d\n\nFor an already wary Washington, Thursday marked a notable \u2014 and highly visible \u2014 uptick in presence from the previous two days. The visibility of federal forces around the city, including in many high-traffic areas, was striking to residents going about their lives. Trump has the power to take over federal law enforcement for 30 days before his actions must be reviewed by Congress, though he has said he\u2019ll re-evaluate as that deadline approaches.\n\nThe response before Thursday had been gradual and, by all appearances, low key. But on Wednesday night, officers set up a checkpoint in one of D.C.\u2019s popular nightlife areas, drawing protests. The White House said 45 arrests were made Wednesday night, with 29 people arrested for living in the country illegally; other arrests included for distribution or possession of drugs, carrying a concealed weapon and assaulting a federal officer.\n\nTroops were stationed outside the Union Station transportation hub as the 800 Guard members who have been activated by Trump start in on missions that include monument security, community safety patrols and beautification efforts, the Pentagon said.\n\n\u201cThey will remain until law and order has been restored in the District as determined by the president, standing as the gatekeepers of our great nation\u2019s capital,\u201d Pentagon press secretary Kingsley Wilson said. \u201cThe National Guard is uniquely qualified for this mission as a community-based force with strong local ties and disciplined training.\u201d\n\nWilson said the troops won\u2019t be armed and declined to give more details on what the safety patrols or beautification efforts would entail or how many Guard members have already been sent out on the streets.\n\nNational Guard Major Micah Maxwell said troops will assist law enforcement in a variety of roles, including traffic control posts and crowd control. The Guard members have been trained in de-escalation tactics and crowd control equipment, Maxwell said.\n\nThe White House said Thursday that Guard members aren\u2019t making arrests but are \u201cprotecting federal assets, providing a safe environment for law enforcement officers to make arrests, and deterring violent crime with a visible law enforcement presence.\u201d\n\nAlthough the current deployment is taking place under unprecedented circumstances, National Guard troops are a semi-regular presence in D.C., typically being used during mass public events like the annual July 4 celebration. They have regularly been used in the past for crowd control in and around Metro stations.\n\nTrump on Thursday denied that the federal law enforcement officials he sent into Washington\u2019s streets to fight crime have been diverted from priority assignments like counterterrorism. Asked if he was concerned about that, Trump said he\u2019s using a \u201cvery small force\u201d of soldiers and that city police are now allowed to do their job properly amidst his security lockdown.\n\nMeanwhile, about a dozen homeless residents in Washington packed up their belongings with help from volunteers from charitable groups and staffers from some city agencies. Items largely were not forcibly thrown out by law enforcement, but a garbage truck idled nearby.\n\nSeveral protesters held signs close by, some critical of the Trump administration. Once the residents had left, a construction vehicle from a city agency cleared through the remains of the tents.\n\nThe departures were voluntary, but they came in response to a clear threat from the Trump administration. Advocates expect law enforcement officers to fan out across D.C. in the coming days to forcibly take down any remaining homeless encampments. In Washington Circle, which still contains a few tents, city workers put up signs announcing \u201cgeneral cleanup of this public space\u201d starting at 10 a.m. Monday.\n\nFor two days, small groups of federal officers have been visible in scattered parts of the city. But more were present in high-profile locations Wednesday night, and troops were expected to start doing more missions Thursday.\n\nAgents from Homeland Security Investigations have patrolled the popular U Street corridor, while Drug Enforcement Administration officers were seen on the National Mall, with Guard members parked nearby. DEA agents also joined MPD officers on patrol in the Navy Yard neighborhood, while FBI agents stood along the heavily trafficked Massachusetts Avenue.\n\nAssociated Press journalists Jacquelyn Martin, Mike Pesoli, Darlene Superville and David Klepper contributed to this report.",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 As National Guard troops deploy across her city as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to clamp down on crime, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser is responding with relative restraint.\nShe\u2019s called Trump\u2019s takeover of the city\u2019s police department and his decision to activate 800 members of the guard \" unsettling and unprecedented \" and gone as far as to cast his efforts as part of an \u201cauthoritarian push.\u201d\nBut Bowser has so far avoided the kind of biting rhetoric and personal attacks typical of other high-profile Democratic leaders, despite the unprecedented incursion into her city.\n\u201cWhile this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can\u2019t say that, given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we\u2019re totally surprised,\u201d Bowser told reporters at a press conference responding to the efforts. She even suggested the surge in resources might benefit the city and noted that limited home rule allows the federal government \u201cto intrude on our autonomy in many ways.\u201d\n\u201cMy tenor will be appropriate for what I think is important for the District,\u201d said Bowser, who is in her third term as mayor. \u201dAnd what\u2019s important for the District is that we can take care of our citizens.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nThe approach underscores the reality of Washington\u2019s precarious position under the thumb of the federal government. Trump has repeatedly threatened an outright takeover of the overwhelmingly Democratic city, which is granted autonomy through a limited home rule agreement passed in 1973 that could be repealed by Congress. Republicans, who control both chambers, have already frozen more than a $1 billion in local spending, slashing the city\u2019s budget.\nAdvertisement\nThat puts her in a very different position from figures such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom or Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, Democrats whose states depend on the federal government for disaster relief and other funding, but who have nonetheless relentlessly attacked the current administration as they lay the groundwork for potential 2028 presidential runs. Those efforts come amid deep frustrations from Democratic voters that their party has not been nearly aggressive enough in its efforts to counter Trump\u2019s actions.\n\u201cUnfortunately she is in a very vulnerable position,\u201d said Democratic strategist Nina Smith. \u201cThis is the sort of thing that can happen when you don\u2019t have the powers that come with being a state. So that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing right now, the mayor trying to navigate a very tough administration. Because this administration has shown no restraint when it comes to any kind of constitutional barriers or norms.\u201d\nA change from Trump\u2019s first term\nBowser\u2019s approach marks a departure from Trump\u2019s first term, when she was far more antagonistic toward the president.\nThen she routinely clashed with the administration, including having city workers paint giant yellow letters spelling out \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d on a street near the White House during the George Floyd protests in 2020.\nThis time around, Bowser took a different tact from the start. She flew to Florida to meet with Trump at Mar-a-Lago after he won the election and has worked to avoid conflict and downplay points of contention, including tearing up the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d letters after he returned to Washington in response to pressure from Republicans in Congress.\nThe change reflects the new political dynamics at play, with Republicans in control of Congress and an emboldened Trump who has made clear he is willing to exert maximum power and push boundaries in unprecedented ways.\nAdvertisement\nD.C. Councilmember Christina Henderson said she understands Bowser\u2019s position, and largely agrees with her conclusion that a legal challenge to Trump\u2019s moves would be a long shot. Trump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act in his executive order, declaring a \u201ccrime emergency\u201d so his administration could take over the city\u2019s police force. The statue limits that control to 30 days unless he gets approval from Congress.\n\u201cThe challenge would be on the question of \u2018Is this actually an emergency?\u2019\u201d said Henderson, a former congressional staffer. \u201cThat\u2019s really the only part you could challenge.\u201d\nHenderson believes the city would face dim prospects in a court fight, but thinks the D.C. government should challenge anyway, \u201cjust on the basis of precedent.\u201d\nTrump told reporters Wednesday that he believes he can extend the 30-day deadline by declaring a national emergency, but said \u201cwe expect to be before Congress very quickly.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna be asking for extensions on that, long-term extensions, because you can\u2019t have 30 days,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna do this very quickly. But we\u2019re gonna want extensions. I don\u2019t want to call a national emergency. If I have to, I will.\u201d\nLimited legal options\nBowser\u2019s response is a reflection of the reality of the situation, according to a person familiar with her thinking. As mayor of the District of Columbia, Bowser has a very different relationship with the president and federal government than other mayors or governors. The city is home to thousands of federal workers, and the mass layoffs under DOGE have already had a major impact on the city\u2019s economy.\nAdvertisement\nHer strategy has been to focus on finding areas where she and the new administration can work together on shared priorities.\nFor now, Bowser appears set to stick with her approach, saying Wednesday that she is focused on \u201cmaking sure the federal surge is useful to us.\u201d\nDuring a morning interview with Fox 5, she and the city\u2019s police chief argued an influx of federal agents linked to Trump\u2019s takeover would improve public safety, with more officers on patrol.\nPolice chief Pamela Smith said the city\u2019s police department is short almost 800 officers, so the extra police presence \u201cis clearly going to impact us in a positive way.\u201d\nBut Nina Smith, the Democratic strategist, said she believes Bowser needs a course correction.\n\u201cHow many times is it going to take before she realizes this is not someone who has got the best interests of the city at heart?\u201d she asked. \u201cI think there may need to be time for her to get tough and push back.\u201d\nDespite Trump\u2019s rhetoric, statistics published by Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police show violent crime has dropped in Washington since a post-pandemic peak in 2023. A recent Department of Justice report shows that violent crime is down 35% since 2023, reaching its lowest rate in 30 years."
