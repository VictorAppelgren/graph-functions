  "content": "IS A LIVING, SIMPLIFYING REGISTRATION, THESE REFORMS HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT WITH A FOCUS ON THE COMMON MAN. HASLINDA: INDIA CUTS TAXES ON HUNDREDS OF CONSUMER GOODS, FROM SOAPS AND CARS TO INSURANCE, TO BOOST SPENDING AND SOFTEN THE BLOW FROM TRUMP'S PUNISHING TARIFFS. THIS IS \"INSIDE\" WITH HASLINDA AMIN WHERE WE DIVE DEEPER INTO STORIES THAT REQUIRE CRUCIAL ANALYSIS. INDIAN STOCKS WILL BE IN FOCUS WHEN MARKETS OPEN IN ABOUT 45 MINUTES, BUT GLOBALLY, INVESTORS ARE WATCHING FOR CLUES ON THE FED'S NEXT MOVE. TEMPLETON GLOBAL INVESTMENT'S CIO WILL JOIN US WITH HIS STAKE ON THE BIGGEST MARKET DRIVERS. WE WILL ALSO SPEAK WITH MOODY'S ABOUT HOW INDIA'S TAX CUT COULD IMPACT GOVERNMENT FINANCES, AND LATER WILL BE JOINED BY THE MANAGING PARTNER AT A VC FIRM SPECIALIZING IN HIGH-GROWTH CONSUMER BRANDS IN INDIA. HERE IS A LOOK ACROSS THE ASIA TRADING SESSION. CHINESE MARKETS TAKING A BIT OF A HIT. TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF THE CSI 300 INDEX, DOWN ALMOST 2% AFTER A BLOOMBERG'S GROUP ON CHINESE REGULATORS WEIGHING COOLING MEASURES FOR STOCKS AFTER A 1.2 TRILLION DOLLAR RALLY FROM THE START OF AUGUST. THE CSI 300 DOWN MORE THAN 2% FOR ITS BIGGEST SLIDE, BY THE WAY, SINCE APRIL. WE ARE ALSO KEEPING AN EYE ON LONG DATED BONDS, INCLUDING A 30-YEAR GOVERNMENT AUCTION IN JAPAN. GLOBAL LONG BONDS ARE UNDER PRESSURE FROM PHYSICAL AS WELL AS INFLATION WORRIES. ALSO WATCHING INDIAN STOCK FUTURES AS WE COUNT DOWN TO THE INDIA OPEN LATER THIS HOUR. INDIA IS CUTTING CONSUMPTION TAXES ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO BOOST LOCAL DEMAND AND SUPPORT THE ECONOMY IN THE FACE OF PRESIDENT TRUMP'S 50% TARIFFS. THE CUTS WILL COME INTO EFFECT SEPTEMBER 22 AND WILL AFFECT MOST EVERYDAY ITEMS ALONG WITH INSURANCE PREMIUMS AS WELL AS VEHICLES. OFFICIALS, HOWEVER, WILL RAISE TAXES ON SIN GOODS SUCH AS CIGARETTES, CHEWING TOBACCO, AND LUXURY CARS. WE SPOKE WITH MORGAN STANLEY'S CHIEF ASIA AND EM EQUITY STRATEGIST ON OPPORTUNITIES HE SEES IN INDIA. HAVE A LISTEN. IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT EARNINGS WILL SWING UP ON A CYCLICAL BASIS FROM HERE AND VALUATIONS WILL COME DOWN QUITE A BIT. IT IS STILL QUITE AN EXPENSIVE MARKET, BUT DESERVEDLY SO GIVEN THE TREND EARNINGS GROWTH, BUT IT HAS DERATED BY ESSENTIALLY FIVE FORWARD P/EIGHT POINTS FROM THE TOP FROM A YEAR AGO, SO IT IS AN INTERESTING MARKET TO LOOK AT. HASLINDA: LET'S GET MORE ON THE MARKET IMPLICATIONS OF INDIA'S CONSUMPTION TAX CUT. BLOOMBERG'S CHIEF ASIA EQUITIES REPORTED JOINS US NOW. THIS MUST BE MARKET POSITIVE. ABSOLUTELY. BUT YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND THE CONTEXT. PRIME MINISTER MODI SPOKE ABOUT DURING HIS INDEPENDENCE DAY SPEECH. SINCE THEN, A BUNCH OF STOCKS HAVE ALREADY DISCOUNTED THIS OPTIMISM. CONSUMER STAPLES, AS A THEME, HAS DISCOUNTED, BUT CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING-RELATED STOCKS ARE YET TO PRICE THIS IN. THE IMPACT IS NOT JUST BECAUSE THE TAXES HAVE BEEN CUT AND RATIONALIZED. IT HAS ALSO BEEN CUT IN A MANNER WORTHY MARKET IS MORE FROM UNORGANIZED PLAYERS TO ORGANIZE ONES, AND MOST OF THE ORGANIZED ONES, A HOST OF THEM ARE LISTED IN THE STOCK MARKET, SO IT IS DEFINITELY WAY MORE POSITIVE FOR THE MARKET, AND AS JONATHAN WAS SAYING, THIS MIGHT SO THE SEEDS OF AN EARNINGS UPGRADE CYCLE OR AT LEAST THE BOTTOMING OF EARNINGS WE HAVE SEEN IN INDIA. I WAS TALKING TO A BUNCH OF STRATEGISTS BEFORE I CAME ON THE AIR, AND WHAT I GOT IS THAT IT DEFINITELY ADDS TO MONETARY AS WELL AS FISCAL MEASURES THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN CARRYING OUT OVER THE PAST FEW QUARTERS. PUT TOGETHER, THIS MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO PUT A FLOOR IN EARNINGS AND MAYBE START A NEW UPGRADE CYCLE FOR INDIA EQUITIES. HASLINDA: OF THE FISCAL CONCERNS, IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOND MARKET, WE SAW YIELDS SEARCH ON THE BACK OF THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE CONCERNS INDIA WILL HAVE TO ISSUE MORE BONDS TO SUPPORT SPENDING. THAT'S RIGHT. IT WOULD BE A CONCERN ON THE FISCAL SIDE, BUT IT IS NOTHING ONE SHOULD WORRY ABOUT. OUR REPORTING AND MY TALKS WITH A VARIETY OF MARKET PARTICIPANTS, SOME SUGGEST THIS IS PRETTY MUCH MANAGEABLE. IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD PUT THE CREDIT RATING OR PROFILES IN DANGER. IT WAS EITHER THESE KIND OF MEASURES THAT SUPPORT THE MARKET OR SUPPORT THE ECONOMY OR TAKING TARIFFS WITH A PINCH OF SALT, AND THAT CAN IMPACT THE MARKET'S PSYCHE EVEN MORE. WE HAVE BEEN POINTING OUT THAT INDIA HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MAJOR MARKETS TO UNDERPERFORM THIS YEAR, AND SIGNIFICANTLY, MONEY HAS BEEN ROTATING OUT. GLOBAL INVESTORS HAVE BEEN EXITING THE MARKET ON FEARS OF VALUATIONS AND EARNINGS NOT PICKING UP AS EXPECTED. IN THIS BACKDROP, IT WAS WAY MORE IMPORTANT TO TAKE CARE OF THESE THINGS BEFORE THINKING ABOUT FISCAL PROFILE, AND IT IS MANAGEABLE. IF YOU TALK TO BOND INVESTORS AND MARKET PARTICIPANTS. HASLINDA: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. LET'S GET INSIGHT ON WHAT THIS MEANS FOR LONG-TERM INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN INDIA. THE CIO OF TEMPLETON GLOBAL INVESTMENTS JOINS US NOW. GOOD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. WE HEARD FROM THE FINANCE MINISTER SHE SAYS IT IS VERY POSITIVE FOR GDP, BUT HOW MUCH CAN IT COUNTER 50% TARIFFS FROM THE U.S.? HAVE TO CONSIDER A FEW THINGS. FIRST OF ALL, HOW LONG WILL THIS 50% TARIFF BE IN PLACE FOR BACK ON IS IT THE SHORT TERM, THE MEDIUM-TERM, OR BEYOND? ONCE WE SEE THE RUSSIA-UKRAINE SITUATION RESOLVED, WHICH WE ARE PROBABLY CLOSER TO THE END THAN THE BEGINNING, THEN I THINK THE PRESSURE ON INDIA WITH RESPECT TO WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP FEELS ON OIL IMPORTS FROM RUSSIA, THAT PRESSURE EASES, SO YOU HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF IF THE TARIFFS ARE HERE FOR A VERY LONG TIME OR NOT. IN TERMS OF THE TAX CUTS, I THINK IT IS VERY POSITIVE. IF YOU LOOK AT SOMETHING LIKE PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND IN INDIA COMPARED TO THE U.S. OR CHINA, IT IS MUCH HIGHER IN INDIA GIVEN THE PROFILE OF THE AVERAGE CONSUMER -- LOWER INCOME AND SO ON. THE LAST TIME TAXES WERE ADJUSTED IN 2019, YOU DID SEE A MEANINGFUL IMPROVEMENT IN DEMAND, ESPECIALLY FOR CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY ITEMS. I WOULD ARGUE THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT, AND ON THE FISCAL SITUATION, IF YOU LOOK BACK IN 2019, NET-NET, IT WAS POSITIVE FOR THE FISCAL POSITION BECAUSE THE INCREASE IN DEMAND MORE THAN OFFSET THE REDUCTION IN TAXES, SO I THINK ALL OF THAT IS POSITIVE, AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE INFLATION PICTURE IN INDIA, IT HAS BEEN FAIRLY WELL BEHAVED. YOU HAVE A NEW CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BANK WHO IS FAIRLY DOVISH. HE HAS BEEN EASING ON A TERRY POLICY. WHEN YOU PUT THAT TOGETHER, AND EASING MONETARY POLICY PICTURE, MARKET SENTIMENT PRETTY POOR, EXPECTATIONS LOW GIVEN WHAT HAS HAPPENED WITH TARIFFS, I THINK THIS IS A POSITIVE CATALYST FOR THE MARKET. HASLINDA: POSITIVE, BUT DOES IT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE VIEW OF THE INDIAN MARKET? I THINK YOU HAVE TO SPLIT THE SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM. IN THE SHORT TERM, SOME PEOPLE WHO DO NOT FULLY APPRECIATE WHAT IS GOING ON IN INDIA ARE FOCUSED ON THE TARIFF INCREASES, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE LONG-TERM DYNAMICS OF INDIA, THE SECULAR GROWTH, THE DEMOGRAPHICS, THE TALENT, NONE OF THOSE STORIES HAVE CHANGED, AND I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INDIAN MARKET OVER THE LONG, THESE CORRECTIONS IN TIME HAVE PROVEN TO BE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES. I WOULD ARGUE THE FUNDAMENTAL SECULAR DRIVERS HAVE NOT CHANGED . IN THE SHORT TERM, YOU MIGHT STILL SEE SOME LOSS THANKS TO TARIFFS, THANKS TO THE UNCERTAINTY BROUGHT ABOUT BY TARIFF POLICY OUT OF WASHINGTON, BUT IN THE MEDIUM TO LONGER TERM, WE ARE STILL VERY CONSTRUCTIVE. HASLINDA: SO PURCHASE INDIA AND PURCHASE CONSUMPTION PLACE? CONSUMPTION WILL BE A SHORT-TERM BENEFICIARY FROM THE POLICY CHANGES, BUT IF YOU LOOK BROADLY ACROSS THE MARKET, THE NUMBER OF OTHER SECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN BEATEN UP BECAUSE OF THE TARIFF SITUATION, AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE VERY STOCK SPECIFIC. THE THING ABOUT THE TARIFF SITUATION IS THAT COMPANIES THAT HAVE PRICING POWER, COMPANIES THAT ARE A SECURE PART OF THE VALUE CHAINS, THOSE ARE THE ONES THAT WILL BENEFIT. HASLINDA: WHAT IS THE BIGGEST RISK FOR INDIA? WE TALKED ABOUT THE 50% TARIFFS, AND YOU QUESTION HOW LONG THAT WILL BE. THE SIGNS ARE NOT REALLY POSITIVE RIGHT NOW. I THINK WE NEED TO FOCUS ON WHAT THE AGENDA IS OUT OF WASHINGTON. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING ON THE AGENDA FOR PRESIDENT TRUMP IS THE TRADE DEAL WITH CHINA. HE IS FOCUSED ON THAT. THE CHINESE ARE FOCUSED ON THAT. THEY DO NOT WANT ANYTHING TO GET IN THE WAY OF THAT BECAUSE OF HOW IMPORTANT THAT ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP IS. ONCE YOU GET THAT OUT OF THE WAY, I BELIEVE THE NEXT ONE WILL BE RUSSIA/UKRAINE. THAT ISSUE NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED. WE ARE CLOSER TO THE END THAT THE BEGINNING. EUROPEANS HAVE NOT COME TO THE TABLE YET. THEY NEED TO. ONCE THAT PRESSURE COMES OFF -- AND IT WILL HAVE TO COME OFF BEFORE 2026 MEANINGFULLY BEGINS BECAUSE AT THAT POINT, PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BE FOCUSED ON MIDTERM ELECTIONS, WHICH ARE VERY IMPORTANT FOR HIM, ESPECIALLY NOW, AND I THINK THAT THE FOCUS BECOMES ON WHAT ELSE HE CAN DO. ONCE THE PRESSURE IS OFF WITH RESPECT TO RUSSIA, I THINK YOU CAN SEE SOME AVENUES WHERE INDIA AND THE U.S. FIND A WAY OF COMING BACK TO THE TABLE. RIGHT NOW, IT IS A LONG WAY AWAY, BUT BEAR IN MIND, THE APPROACH OUT OF D.C. HAS BEEN FAIRLY TRANSACTIONAL BASED ON THE ISSUE OF THE DAY IN THE EYES OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION, SO I THINK WE SHOULD NOT WILL THAT OUT. HASLINDA: THE OTHER ISSUE INVESTORS ARE FOCUSING ON IS JANE STREET. NOW IT SAYS IT IS PUSHING BACK ON THE MANIPULATION IMPOSED ON A. HOW ARE YOU LOOKING AT THAT SITUATION? WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS BROADLY? I THINK REGULATORY SITUATIONS IN ANY JURISDICTION ARE TRICKY, AND I'M NOT PRIVY TO THE SPECIFICS OF JANE STREET, BUT I'M SURE THEY WILL WORK IT OUT OVER TIME. I THINK CITY HAS ALWAYS BEEN FOCUSED ON WHAT INSURERS A LONG-TERM LIQUID MARKET AND WHAT WORKS FOR ALL SEGMENTS OF INDIAN SOCIETY IN TERMS OF INVESTORS IN THE MARKET, SO I THINK THEY WILL BE FOCUSED ON THAT. THE OTHER THING I WILL SAY IS THAT I DON'T THINK THIS WILL BE RESOLVED IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. HASLINDA: BUT THIS IS A HIGH-STAKES LEGAL BATTLE, IN A WAY, RIGHT? YES. HASLINDA: IT COULD SET THE FUTURE FOR FOREIGN INVESTORS IN INDIA, RIGHT? IT IS DIFFICULT TO SPECULATE, BUT WHEREVER YOU LOOK IN THE WORLD, THERE HAVE BEEN REGULATORY SITUATIONS WHICH HAVE LOOKED TRICKY AT A POINT IN TIME, BUT OVER TIME, THEY GET RESOLVED. HASLINDA: THE BROADER MARKET IS ABOUT THE FED, HOW MUCH IT WILL CUT AND WHAT THEY WILL DO. WHAT IS CRUCIAL IS THE DATA COMING OUT ON FRIDAY. IF THE DATA COMES IN A WEEK, MIGHT 50 BE ON THE CARDS FOR SEPTEMBER -- IF THE DATA COMES IN WEAK? WHO KNOWS? NONFARM PAYROLLS ARE A VERY VOLATILE DATA SERIES. WE ARE COMING AT THE END OF THE SUMMER IN THE U.S., WHICH HAS BEEN A VERY ACTIVE SUMMER. THE WEATHER HAS PLAYED A BIG PART IN THINGS, SO IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT WHAT THE SHORT-TERM NUMBERS WILL BE. HAVING SAID THAT, I BELIEVE THAT OVER THE NEXT TO NINE MONTHS, CHAIRMAN POWELL WILL BE THINKING ABOUT THE LEGACY HE LEAVES BEHIND FOR HIS TERM AT THE FED. THERE WILL BE LIKELY A DOVISH NEW FED CHAIRMAN THAT WILL COME IN. CURRENTLY, MARKETS ARE EXPECTING SOMETHING IN THE REGION OF 150 BASIS POINTS BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF NEXT YEAR. I WOULD ARGUE THAT IS EXCESSIVE. IF YOU LOOK AT INTEREST RATE FORECASTS OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS, THEY HAVE BEEN PRETTY INACCURATE IN TERMS OF PREDICTING AND EASING MONETARY POLICY CYCLE, AND I THINK THE SAME WILL HAPPEN THIS TIME. I THINK WE WILL SEE EASING. I WOULD BE VERY SURPRISED IF WE SEE 150 BASIS POINTS BY THIS TIME NEXT YEAR. IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT IS HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD, THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS, IF YOU LOOK AT THE COMMENTS FROM SECRETARY BESSENT ON HOW MUCH THE U.S. IS PULLING IN FROM TARIFFS, IT IS ANNUALIZING AT ABOUT $330 BILLION. THAT IS A BIG NUMBER. IF YOU LOOK AT, SAY, PERSONAL CONSUMPTION, EXPENDITURE IN THE U.S., THE CHANGE YEAR ON YEAR IS ABOUT 1.5 TRILLION, SO $333 BILLION IS A BIG NUMBER. THAT NUMBER HAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE. THE TWO THINGS I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING OUT FOR ARE INFLATION NUMBERS PERHAPS SPIKING, REFLECTING THOSE TARIFFS, AND THAT COULD BE CAUSE FOR CONCERN FOR THE MARKET SHORT-TERM, AND ALSO THE OVERALL DEMAND PICTURE. WE HAVE SEEN EVIDENCE THAT DEMAND HAS BEEN PULLED FORWARD EARLIER IN THE YEAR GIVEN TARIFFS, SO COMPANIES, CONSUMERS HAVE BEEN PULLING FORWARD DEMAND SO THEY DO NOT HAVE TO PAY UP FOR TARIFFS, SO IT IS LOGICAL WE WILL SEE SOME FOLLOW-UP FROM THAT IN TERMS OF SLOWDOWN, SO I THINK THOSE ARE A COUPLE OF THINGS TO LOOK OUT FOR WHICH CAN SPOOK MARKETS IN THE SHORT TERM. HASLINDA: NEUTRAL, 3%, HOW QUICKLY MIGHT WE GET THERE? I THINK IT WILL TAKE LONGER THAN PEOPLE EXPECT. I DO NOT THINK WE GET THERE BEFORE THE END OF NEXT YEAR AS MARKETS ARE EXPECTING. HASLINDA: GIVEN THAT THE MARKETS ARE PRICING IN DEEPER RATE CUTS THEN WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING, IS THERE TOO MUCH OPTIMISM IN THE STOCK MARKET RIGHT NOW? TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE. WE ARE CONSTANTLY TESTING NEW HIGHS. AGAIN, THERE'S THE HEADLINE AND WHAT IS HAPPENING UNDERNEATH. IF YOU LOOK AT THE HEADLINE, MARKETS ARE UP SIGNIFICANTLY. IF YOU LOOK AT MARKETS, FIVE STOCKS ACCOUNT FOR THREE QUARTERS OF THE S & P 500. THE S & P 500 IS LOOKING AT DOUBLE-DIGIT RETURNS YEAR TO DATE, BUT THE MEDIAN STOCK IS PROBABLY LOW SINGLE DIGITS, SO THERE IS A REAL BIFURCATION IN THE MARKET BETWEEN THE AI WINNERS IN THIS ARMS RACE BECAUSE THE MARGINAL RETURNS FROM AI INVESTMENT ARE STILL SUPERNORMAL RIGHT NOW, AND THE MARKET IS GIVING THOSE COMPANIES AND LOT OF CREDIT WITH THE INVESTMENT THEY ARE MAKING, AND THEN THERE IS THE REST OF THE MARKET WHERE THERE IS UNCERTAINTY, WHERE THEY TARIFFS ARE HAVING AN IMPACT, WHERE THERE IS EVIDENCE OF A SLOWDOWN IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE LOGISTICS COMPANIES. THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT A SLOWDOWN. IF YOU TALK TO TRADITIONAL ADVERTISING COMPANIES, THERE IS EVIDENCE OF A SLOWDOWN, SO YOU DO HAVE THIS BIFURCATED ECONOMY, BIFURCATED MARKET. HEADLINES SUGGEST A VERY HEALTHY S & P 500, BUT THAT AGAIN IS CONCENTRATED IN A SMALL NUMBER OF COMPANIES AS IT WAS LAST YEAR. I THINK THERE IS SCOPE FOR DISAPPOINTMENT IN THAT SPACE. HASLINDA: SO WE COULD SEE A CORRECTION OF 10%, 20%? I THINK A 10% CORRECTION IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO EXPECT GIVEN HOW STRONG THIS MARKET HAS BEEN AND THE AMOUNT OF PROFITS THERE ARE OUT THERE TO TAKE, BUT I WOULD SAY THAT ANY CORRECTION WOULD PROBABLY BE SHORT-LIVED BECAUSE YOU HAVE GOT SUCH A LARGE SEGMENT OF THE MARKET THAT HAS LAGGED, AND WHERE VALUATIONS ARE NOT AS DEMANDING AS THE VERY LARGE COMPANIES, SO THERE IS NOT A LOT OF OPTIMISM THERE. THERE'S VERY LOW EXPECTATION. HASLINDA: TO YOUR POINT, THE CONCENTRATION RISKS ARE THERE. HOW BEST TO YOU PLAY, AND WHAT ARE THE MAJOR CHANGES TO YOUR PORTFOLIO THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO SHARE? WE TAKE A LONG-TERM VIEW, I THINK. THE AI STORY IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST STORIES IN OUR LIFETIME, AND THAT WILL CHANGE THE WAY ALL BUSINESSES OPERATE. IT IS HAPPENING ALREADY, SO I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE IN THAT STORY. WHERE YOU POSITION YOURSELF IS IMPORTANT, AND I THINK THE SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANIES, INCLUDING THOSE IN ASIA, ARE REAL BENEFICIARIES OF THAT. SOME OF THE HYPERSCALERS ARE EXECUTING EXTREMELY WELL, SO I THINK YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL, BUT YOU HAVE TO BE POSITIONED WITHIN THAT. OUTSIDE OF THAT AREA, I THINK YOU ALSO HAVE TO LOOK AT SOME OF THE PLACES THAT HAVE LAGGED. SOME OF THE AREAS THAT HAVE LAGGED IN THE U.S. HAVE BEEN AREAS LIKE HEALTH CARE AND SOME CONSUMER DISCRETIONARY AREAS, SO VALUATIONS HAVE BEGUN TO LOOK A LOT MORE ATTRACTIVE THERE. WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE AREAS TO TAKE AWAY SOME OF THE STEAM AWAY FROM THE BIGGER STOCKS IN THE MARKET. HASLINDA: CHINA HAS BEEN A RED HOT MARKET, AND TODAY WE HEAR THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IS POSSIBLY LOOKING AT SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS. YOUR TAKE ON WHERE THE MARKET IS HEADED. I WOULD COME BACK TO THE BIG PICTURE AGAIN. THE MOST IMPORTANT FOCUS FOR BEIJING RIGHT NOW, AS IT IS FOR WASHINGTON, I WOULD ARGUE, IS THIS TRADE DEAL BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S., AND THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP DOES NOT WANT TO SEE ANYTHING DISTRACT OR GET AWAY FROM THAT. SO ANY SIGNAL TO THE U.S. THAT THE CHINESE MARKET IS LOOKING THROUGH THAT RISK IS INTERPRETING THE OUTCOME OVERLY POSITIVELY I THINK IS SOMETHING THEY WOULD LIKE TO AVOID, AND WHEN YOU COME BACK TO PRESIDENT XI JINPING'S AGENDA, IT HAS BEEN THE CASE SINCE HE HAS STEPPED UP INTO HIS ROLE. COMMON PROSPERITY HAS NOT GOT AWAY. IT IS ABOUT ALIGNMENT, ABOUT ENSURING THAT DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CHINESE POPULATION BENEFIT FROM GROWTH, BENEFIT FROM THE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE SAME WAY. DOMESTIC DEMAND HAS NOT REALLY PICKED UP IN CHINA THIS YEAR, DESPITE SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS -- HASLINDA: AND PROPERTY SECTOR HAS NOT EITHER. THAT HASN'T. THAT RALLY HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY VERY CHEAP VALUATIONS, SOME EXPECTATION THAT WE ARE PAST THE BOTTOM IN CHINA, WHICH IS PROBABLY FAIR, BUT THEY WANT TO TAKE THE STEAM OUT OF THE MARKET, SO IT IS SOMETHING WE HAVE TO WATCH CLOSELY. HASLINDA: BUT THE AI PLAYS IN CHINA ARE ATTRACTIVE, NO? CHINA IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST BENEFICIARIES OF AI. NOT ENOUGH ATTENTION IS BEING PAID BY GLOBAL INVESTORS RIGHT NOW, AND I THINK THAT WILL BE THE CASE FOR YEARS TO COME, SO IT IS AN AREA WE LIKE A LOT. HASLINDA: ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO HAVE YOU WITH US. STILL AHEAD, MOODY'S RATING SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FOR CREDIT STRATEGY WILL BE JOINING US FOR ANALYSIS OF INDIA'S DEBT MARKETS AND ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AHEAD OF THE NEW TAX CUTS. KEEP IT WITH US. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. HASLINDA: WELCOME BACK. THE INDIAN PRIME MINISTER IS HAILING THE GST COUNSEL'S DECISION TO LOWER THE NATIONWIDE CONSUMPTION TAX. THE TAX CUTS ARE EXPECTED TO PUT MORE DISPOSABLE INCOME IN THE HANDS OF CONSUMERS, TO LIFT CONSUMPTION, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR 60% OF INDIA'S GDP. FOR MORE, LET'S BRING IN OUR SALVATION ECONOMY EDITOR. WE HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE TIMING OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT. ABSOLUTELY. IN FACT, THIS IS COMING IN RIGHT AHEAD OF THE MAIN FESTIVE SEASON IN INDIA, DIWALI PAIR THAT HAPPENS TO BE IN THE MONTH OF OCTOBER. A LOT OF CONSUMERS HAD MADE PURCHASES IN THE RUN-UP TO THE FESTIVAL AND HOPING CUTS FAR AND WIDE WILL REDUCE THE PRICES OF A LOT OF GOODS, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED. WE NOW HAVE ONLY TWO RATE SLABS, WHICH IS THE 5% TAX CATEGORY AND THE 18% TAX CATEGORY AND MORE THAN 400 PRODUCTS RANGING FROM TOOTHPASTE TV. THE GST RATES HAVE BEEN REDUCED ON THAT. ALSO REMEMBER, THIS CONSUMPTION TAX CUT IS COMING AT A TIME WHEN INDIA'S ECONOMY IS EXPECTED TO GET A BIG HIT FROM THE PUNITIVE TARIFFS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPOSED BY U.S. PRESIDENT TRUMP. IF YOU LOOK AT THE LAST GDP FIGURES, WE DID SEE GOOD GROWTH, BUT THE EXPECTATION IS THAT GOING FORWARD, WE MAY SEE SOME SORT OF TAPERING OF GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY, TAPERING OF EXPANSION IN THE ECONOMY, AND THIS IS WHAT THE CONSUMPTION TAX IS AIMED TOWARD. THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THERE WILL BE MORE BRILLIANCY AND WE WILL SEE MORE PEOPLE GETTING INTO THE MARKETS, BUYING PRODUCTS. THIS WILL SUPPORT CONSUMPTION. THAT ACCOUNTS FOR ALMOST 60% OF INDIA'S GDP. HAVING SAID THAT, IT WILL COME AT A COST OF 480 BILLION RUPEES FOR THE EXCHEQUER, SO THAT IS SOMETHING ONE HAS TO LOOK AT AS TO HOW THE GOVERNMENT WILL FILL THIS BIG HOLE AND ALSO HOW THE STATES WILL BE COMPENSATED BECAUSE THE STATES HAVE SAID THAT THERE IS SOME SORT OF REVENUE LOSS THAT THEY WILL BE FACING AS WELL, BUT FOR NOW IN THE INTEREST OF CONSUMPTION, THEY HAVE GIVEN IT A GO AHEAD. WHAT NEEDS TO BE SEEN, HOW COMPENSATION SETS FOR VARIOUS STATES WILL BE WORKED OUT BY THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT. HASLINDA: WHAT ARE SOME OF THE OPTIONS? WHAT MIGHT THE GOVERNMENT DO TO ENSURE ITS COFFERS ARE STILL FILLED? AS FAR AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED, WE ALREADY KNOW THERE IS A BIG BONANZA THAT CAME IN EARLIER THIS YEAR FROM INDIA'S CENTRAL BANK. THAT IS GOING TO SUFFICIENTLY KEEP THE GOVERNMENT A KITTY INTACT. ON TOP OF THAT, THERE IS EXPECTATION THEY WILL BE PRIVATIZATION THAT WILL HAPPEN THIS YEAR WHICH WILL ALSO GIVE SOME SUBSTANTIAL CHUNK OF MONEY TO THE GOVERNMENT. ALL IN ALL, SO FAR, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS SAYING THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO STICK TO THEIR FISCAL DEFICIT TARGET FOR THIS YEAR, BUT REMEMBER THE BORROWING PROGRAM FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE FISCAL YEAR KICK STARTS FROM THE FIRST OF OCTOBER. WE WILL BE HEARING FROM THE GOVERNMENT ON THEIR PROPOSED PLANS VERY SOON, BUT THERE WAS A RISK THAT VARIOUS MARKET PARTICIPANTS SAW IN TERMS OF IF THERE WILL BE ANY FISCAL SLIPPAGE BECAUSE IT IS NOT JUST THE GST CUTS. REMEMBER, THE GOVERNMENT IS ALSO TALKING ABOUT SOME SORT OF INCENTIVES THAT MAY COME IN FOR EXPORTERS AND WHAT WILL THAT MEAN FOR THE CENTRAL EXCHEQUER IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND WATCH OUT FOR. HASLINDA: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT PERSPECTIVE. INDIA'S TAX CUTS HAVE A NET IMPACT OF AROUND 5.5 BILLION U.S. DOLLARS OF THE GOVERNMENT'S REVENUES, WHICH THE COUNTRY'S REVENUE SECRETARY SAYS IS FISCALLY SUSTAINABLE. LET'S GET THE HEAD OF ASIA CREDIT POSITIONING AT MOODY'S CREDIT RATINGS. THANK YOU. I THINK THIS IS SIMILAR TO BASICALLY WE ARE LOOKING AT 80 BILLION RUPEES WORTH OF TAX CUTS OR REVENUE LOSS, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO 0.14% GDP, SO THAT IS A RELATIVELY SMALL AMOUNT. WE ARE EXPECTING THE GOVERNMENT TO BE ON TRACK, BUT DON'T FORGET, I THINK THERE WAS ALSO PUT IN THE BUDGET THE WHOLE THING WAS TRYING TO STIMULATE OR BOOST MORE CREDIT CONSUMPTION, WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN THE GROWTH FOR THE ECONOMY ON THE BACKDROP OF 50% TARIFFS COMING FROM THE U.S. SIDE, AND THIS IS A CONTINUATION OF THE GOVERNMENT'S SUPPORTIVE MEASURES IN ADDITION TO THE INCOME TAX CUT THAT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND PUT INTO THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2025 TO FISCAL YEAR 2026, BUT IN OUR ESTIMATE, GIVEN THAT INDIA IS A LARGE CONSUMER-DRIVEN ECONOMY, THAT 50% TARIFF WILL TAKE A TOLL , SO IT IS A LOWER ESTIMATE AND WE ARE STILL GETTING TO A 7% FULL CALENDAR YEAR. HASLINDA: BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME CONCERNS OUT THERE. WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THE BOND MARKET, HOW YIELDS SURGE BECAUSE THERE ARE CONCERNS THAT PERHAPS THE GOVERNMENT WILL HAVE TO ISSUE MORE DEBT TO SUPPORT ITS SPENDING PLANS. IS THAT SOMETHING YOU ARE LOOKING AT? YES, INDEED. WE ARE LOOKING AT A BALANCED VIEW OF HOW THE GOVERNMENT WILL FUND THIS, BUT ON THE RELATIVE SIZE PERSPECTIVE, RELATIVE TO WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS PUTTING ON THE TABLE, I DON'T THINK THAT'S GOING TO HAVE A BIG DENT TO THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTINUED FISCAL CONSOLIDATION AT THIS POINT. HASLINDA: SO JUST TO BE CLEAR, THE TAX CUTS, ARE THEY SUSTAINABLE OR NOT? AT THIS POINT, IT IS A SMALL PORTION AND WHAT WE HOPE TO SEE IS MORE GROWTH COMING FROM THE TAX CUT, ESPECIALLY FOR PRIVATE CONSUMPTION, WHICH AS WE NOTED, 60% OF INDIA GDP, BUT IN RECENT YEARS, I DON'T THINK THE HOUSEHOLD IS SUFFERING FROM HIGH INFLATION, SO THAT IS WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO RESOLVE AT THIS POINT. HASLINDA: JUST HANG TIGHT. WE HAVE SEVERAL HEADLINES TO TELL OUR VIEWERS ABOUT. WE HAVE BEEN KEEPING AN EYE ON THE BOND THAT COVER RATIO. WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT HOW THE 30-YEAR SEEMS TO BE PRETTY MUCH UNLOVED DURATION. IN TERMS OF YIELDS, THEY HAVE CLIMBED FROM 2.3% TO 3.3%. AGAIN, JAPAN'S 30-YEAR BOND AUCTION WHICH WE HAVE BEEN KEEPING AN EYE ON, THE RECOVERED RATIO WAS 3.31. COMING BACK TO OUR CONVERSATION, IN TERMS OF CREDIT RATINGS, WE HAVE SEEN SOME CONCERNS, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO DEVELOPMENTS IN INDONESIA, THOSE VIOLENT PROTESTS WE HAVE SEEN. ARE YOU REASSESSING INDONESIA'S CREDIT RATING? WE ARE MONITORING CLOSELY WITH THE PROTEST IS TAKING US, BUT AT THIS POINT, THE PROTEST CAME ON THE BACKDROP OF A LOT OF CONCERNS IN JOB PROSPECTS AS WELL AS INCOME DISPARITY IN THAT SENSE. WE ARE STILL EXPECTING 4.7% GDP GROWTH THIS YEAR AND NEXT, BUT IF THE UNREST IS SUSTAINED, IF THE HEIGHTENED POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY IS SUSTAINED IN THAT SENSE, WE WILL SEE SOME DOWNSIDE RISK TO THAT. I THINK THE FIRST HALF OF GDP GROWTH IS FAIRLY DECENT IN A WAY, BUT THEY GROWTH PATTERN IS A LITTLE BIT CONCERNING AND RAISING CONCERNS AMONG THE PUBLIC. THAT IS THE GROWTH DRIVER MAINLY COMES FROM GOOD PRODUCTION OUTPUT FROM AGRICULTURE SECTORS AS WELL AS THE DOWNSTREAM PROCESSING SECTORS. HOWEVER, GROWTH IN THOSE SECTORS WERE NOT ABLE TO OFFSET THIS. THAT IS CAUSING WIDE CONCERNS ABOUT DISPARITY IN GROWTH, AND THAT HAS IMPLICATION ON THE WEAKENING OF LEADING STANDARDS. HASLINDA: DO YOU SEE A RISK THAT IT COULD REACH THE 3% TARGET? WE WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW THINGS EVOLVE IN PARTICULAR FOR THIS YEAR, BUT WE ARE ASSESSING THE SITUATION AS IT GOES. HASLINDA: WHAT IN PARTICULAR ARE YOU LOOKING OUT FOR BEFORE DECIDING AND THERE COULD BE A DOWNGRADE IN THE CREDIT RATING? THIS IS A SITUATION WHICH HAS BEEN BREWING FOR MONTHS. YEAH, AND I WOULD NOT BE SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE EXPERTS. OUR HOLISTIC APPROACH IS LOOKING AT MANY ASPECTS OF FUNDAMENTALS OF THE CREDIT STRENGTHS OF SOVEREIGN ISSUERS INCLUDING ECONOMIC STRENGTHS, FISCAL STRENGTHS, AS WELL AS EXTERNAL RISKS OR VULNERABILITIES. A SLEW OF THINGS HAVE TO COME TOGETHER FOR US TO TAKE RATING ACTION. HASLINDA: I GUESS WHEN IT COMES TO ASIA-PACIFIC IN PARTICULAR, THOSE TARIFFS FROM THE U.S. HAVE A BEARING ON HOW THE ECONOMIES WILL FAIR FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR IN THE COMING YEARS. HOW ARE YOU WEIGHING THOSE TARIFFS AND HOW THE ECONOMY WILL FAIR? OVERALL, WE READ ABOUT 25 SOVEREIGN ISSUERS IN THE REGION AND WE ARE LOOKING AT THE GDP-WEIGHTED GROWTH RATE OF 4.1 PERCENT THIS YEAR. THIS IS SLIGHTLY DOWN FROM WHAT WE HAD LAST YEAR IN THE REGION, SO IN RELATIVE TERMS, THE TARIFFS ARE HIGHER, TARIFFS ARE REAL, BUT RELATIVELY SPEAKING, THE REGION'S ECONOMY IS RELATIVELY RESILIENT TO THIS TARIFF SHOCK, IF YOU WILL. WE ARE ALSO LOOKING FOR GROWTH TO SLOW DOWN FOR THE REGION IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AS WELL GIVEN THE TARIFF UNCERTAINTY WILL PERCOLATE INTO DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THE ECONOMY INCLUDING BUSINESS DECISIONS, BUSINESS INVESTMENTS, AND CONSUMER SENTIMENT. HASLINDA: HOW ABOUT IN TERMS OF CHINA'S CREDIT RATING? SOME SAY IT'S CREDIT CONDITIONS ARE PRETTY STABLE AT THIS POINT IN TIME. IT IS NOT A FAIR ASSESSMENT? WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CREDIT CONDITIONS, WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A LOT OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN THE ECONOMY. AS WE ALL KNOW, CHINA IS FACING EXTERNAL CHALLENGES BECAUSE OF UNCERTAINTIES IN TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE U.S. DOMESTICALLY, WE ARE ALSO LOOKING AT AN ECONOMY THAT REMAINS TO BE EXPERT DRIVEN DUE TO FRONTLOADING, BUT MONETARY POLICY AND SUPPORTIVE MEASURES FROM FISCAL SUPPORT IS ALSO HELPING THE HOUSEHOLD IN TERMS OF EXPANDING CONSUMPTIONS ON SOME OF THE HOUSEHOLD ITEMS, INCLUDING EV'S, ELECTRONICS AS PART OF TRADE AND SUBSIDY SCHEME . HOWEVER, LOOKING UNDER THE HOOD, SO TO SPEAK, THERE HAS BEEN NO BROAD-BASED RECOVERY OF PRIVATE CONSUMPTION. WE ARE STILL LOOKING AT VERY MUTED RETAIL SALES GROWTH FOR THE FIRST HALF, WHICH ALSO CAME DOWN TO 3.7% IN JULY. THE INVESTMENT SENTIMENT IS STILL VERY LOW. PRIVATE INVESTMENT REMAINS IN A CONTRACTION AREA, AND THIS IS MAINLY BECAUSE OF MUTED CONSUMER SENTIMENT DUE TO WEAKENED INCOME GROWTH PROSPECTS AS WELL AS JOB PROSPECTS ALONG WITH THE CONTINUED DRAG FROM THE PROPERTY SECTOR. AGAIN, THE MOMENTUM THAT IS HAPPENING IN THE FIRST HALF, WE ARE EXPECTING THAT THEY PULL AHEAD FROM THE EXPORT SECTOR WILL WEIGH IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. WE ARE EXPECTING TO SEE FOUR-YEAR GROWTH OF 4.7% THIS YEAR, BUT NEXT YEAR, IT WILL COME FURTHER DOWN TO 4% IN THE ABSENCE OF ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORT. HASLINDA: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT. SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF CREDIT STRATEGY AND RESEARCH GROUP AT MOODY'S RATINGS. STILL TO COME, WE WILL FOCUS IN ON INDIA'S SALES TAX CUTS' IMPLICATIONS. KEEP IT HERE WITH US. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a HASLINDA: INDIA HAS BEEN TRADING FOR ABOUT A MINUTE NOW. IT IS GREEN PRETTY MUCH ACROSS, ADDING TO THE GAIN JUST YESTERDAY AND NOT SURPRISING THAT INDIAN STAPLES, AUTO STOCKS ARE RALLYING AFTER THE CONSUMPTION TAX CUTS ANNOUNCED JUST YESTERDAY. TAKE A LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF THE NFT 100, ALSO HIGHER BY .8%. THE REVAMP OF INDIA'S CONSUMPTION TAX MARKS THE FIRST MAJOR CHANGE SINCE ITS IMPLEMENTATION IN 2017. REFORMS HAVE LONG BEEN SOUGHT BY INVESTORS WHICH HAVE ALSO BEEN -- OFTEN STRUGGLED SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION. UNDER THE OLD RATE STRUCTURE, SPICED OR SALTED POPCORN SALT LOOSE WITH TAX AT 5%, BUT IF THE EXACT SAME PRODUCT WAS SOLD PREPACKAGED AND LABELED, IT WAS TAXED AT 12%. IF YOU HAD A SWEET TOOTH AND OPTED FOR THE CARAMEL VERSION, WHICH I WOULD, THE TAX RATE JUMPED TO 18%. THANKFULLY, THINGS ARE EXPECTED TO GET A BIT EASIER NOW. WHAT WE ARE STILL WAITING FOR THE FINE PRINT, THE NEW REGIME IS SET TO TAX SALTED OR SPICY POPCORN AT 5% REGARDLESS OF IF IT IS SOLD LOOSE OR PACKAGE. SADLY, THE RATE WILL STILL BE 18% FOR THOSE WITH A SWEET TOOTH AS CARAMEL POPCORN FALLS UNDER THE SUGARY TREATS CATEGORY. BAD NEWS FOR ME. WHEN TERRY PARTNERS IS A SINGAPORE-BASED PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM INVESTING IN CONSUMER BRANDS ACROSS INDIA AND SOUTHEAST ASIA. THE FIRM RAISED $150 MILLION IN THE FIRST CLOSE. LET'S GET INSIGHTS FROM THE MANAGING PARTNER AT VENTURI PARTNERS. FIRST OFF, YOUR REACTION TO THE CONSUMPTION TAX CUT? IT IS GOOD FOR OUR FOLIO COMPANIES. WE HAVE A PORTFOLIO COMPANY THAT OPERATES IN THE VERY SPACE. IT IS DEFINITELY A NET POSITIVE. I THINK ALL AROUND, IT IS DEFINITELY GOOD FOR BOOSTING CONSUMPTION. TAKING A STEP BACK, I THINK THIS IS INDIA'S STRATEGIC SORT OF STEP IN TRYING TO BALANCE DOMESTIC ECONOMIC CONSUMPTION TOGETHER WITH EXTERNAL SHOCKS, AND WHILE WE ARE YET TO SEE THE SECOND ORDER EFFECTS IN TERMS OF HOW FISCAL DEFICIT GETS IMPACTED, AND I THINK TO THAT EXTENT, INDIA IS PLAYING THE THIN LINE OF TRYING TO BALANCE BOTH, THEY DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE A BIT OF FISCAL FLEXIBILITY TO BOOST CONSUMPTION, SO THIS HOPEFULLY SHOULD BE A NET POSITIVE, BUT THE SECOND ORDER IMPACT IS YET TO BE ASSESSED COMPLETELY. HASLINDA: NET POSITIVE. IS IT THE SAME FOR URBAN AND RURAL CONSUMERS? KNOW, AT LEAST LOOKING AT WHERE THE CUTS HAVE COME FROM, IT IS LIKELY TO BOOST MORE VERBAL CONSUMPTION, BUT I THINK GIVEN HAVE DEMOCRATIZED INDIA IS NOW BECOMING IN TERMS OF CONSUMPTION PATTERNS, YOU ALSO HAVE AN INDIA THAT IS VERY VALUE-SEEKING, I THINK THERE IS A SLIGHTLY MORE THIN LINE COMPARED TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE, SO TO THAT EXTENT, THERE WILL DEFINITELY BE POSITIVE EFFECTS FOR URBAN INDIA AS WELL. HASLINDA: WE TALKED ABOUT HOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE HEADLINE, IT IS MARKET POSITIVE, BUT IF YOU LOOK AT IMPLICATIONS AS SEEN FROM THE BOND MARKET, THE CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING TO SELL MORE BONDS TO BACK SPENDING, WHAT ARE THE MAJOR CONCERNS? WHAT ARE THE RISKS THAT YOU SEE? I THINK THE RISKS ARE LINKED AROUND WHERE THE GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE UP THIS FISCAL DEFICIT OR THIS EXTRA REVENUE LOSS THAT THEY WILL INCUR. THERE STOCKS OF PRIVATIZATION FROM BANKS THAT WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO GENERATE A LITTLE BIT OF REVENUE FOR THEM. THE BOND MARKETS, LIKE YOU SAID, BUT IT ISNOT STRAIGHTFORWARD. I THINK ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT IN THE NEAR TERM, THEIR TARGET OF 5% MIGHT GET PUSHED TO 5.3% AND 5.4%, AND IF THEY ARE ABLE TO STICK, FISCAL YEAR 2027 IS WHAT WE NEED TO SEE. THE OTHER RISK IS THAT THIS BASKET TO FIRST STATE TO STATE, AS WE DISCUSSED, SO WHAT IS THE STATE LEVEL IMPACT OF SOME OF THESE CHANGES? YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME STATES THAT DEPEND A LOT MORE ON CERTAIN CATEGORIES WHERE RATES HAVE BEEN CUT. I THINK THAT IS THE OTHER SECOND ORDER IMPLICATION THAT WE DON'T KNOW YET. HASLINDA: GIVEN THE PERSPECTIVE YOU HAVE JUST SHARED WITH US, DOES IT IMPACT, SHAPE, OR INFLUENCE THE WAY THAT YOU LOOK TO INVEST IN COMPANIES? NOT REALLY, SIMPLY BECAUSE OUR MANDATE HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOING AFTER DOMESTIC PRIVATE CONSUMPTION, SO ALL THE COMPANIES WE HAVE INVESTED IN HAVE LITTLE TO NO REVENUE COMING FROM OUTSIDE OF INDIA, SO TO THAT EXTENT, PURELY FROM A PORTFOLIO PERSPECTIVE, THIS WILL BE A NET POSITIVE AS LONG AS CONSUMPTION KICKS OFF IN THE WAY THE GOVERNMENT AND THE REST OF THE ECONOMY EXPECTS IT TO HAPPEN. FOR OUR PORTFOLIO, IT IS DEFINITELY A NET POSITIVE AT THIS POINT. HASLINDA: AND YOU DON'T SEE MUCH OF A RISK COMING FROM THAT? NO. HASLINDA: IN TERMS OF THE TIMELINE FOR YOUR PREPARING FOR AN EXIT, WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT GAP WHAT ARE SOME OF THE CONSIDERATIONS? WE ARE EXPECTING THE FIRST EXIT TO COME NEXT YEAR. THIS WILL BE A 5.5-YEAR OLD PERIOD, SO VERY MUCH IN SYNC WITH WHAT WE PROMISED TO INVESTORS. IT WILL LIKELY BE A PUBLIC MARKET EXIT, AND I THINK THAT IS THE BEAUTY THAT INDIA HAS OVER THE ADVANTAGE INDIA HAS TODAY, THAT EVEN THE LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET IS SO DOMESTIC-DRIVEN THAT THE PUBLIC MARKETS ARE, ONE WOULD ARGUE, OPERATING AT ALL-TIME HIGH MULTIPLES, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY ARE SEEING ENOUGH LIQUIDITY FOR COMPANIES TO BE ABLE TO EXIT EFFECTIVELY. HASLINDA: THE OTHER IS THAT YOU SEE THE RISK OF IT BEING A DOMESTICALLY DRIVEN MARKET. FOR US, 60% OF GDP IS DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION. THAT WILL NOT CHANGE TOMORROW. FOR US, THIS REFORM IS BENEFICIAL NOT ONLY TO OUR COMPANIES BUT TO OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL. IF THE RUPEE WERE TO DEPRECIATE, WHAT WITH THE IMPACT BE? OUR PORTFOLIO IS INSULATED FROM THAT BECAUSE LIKE I MENTIONED, WE DO NOT HAVE TOO MUCH EXPECTATION ON EXPORTS ARE OUR COMPANIES DO NOT SELL OUTSIDE INDIA, SO THEY COULD BE AN IMPACT FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE HIGHLY EXPORT-DRIVEN. WHAT HAPPENS IF TRUMP DECIDES TO PLACE TARIFFS ON SERVICES IN INDIA? THOSE RISKS ALWAYS EXIST. HASLINDA: YOU'RE LOOKING TO RAISE EVEN MORE. WHERE ARE YOU WITH THAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT YOU WILL POSSIBLY EVEN EXCEED PERHAPS? YOUR FIRST CLOSE TARGET WAS $125 MILLION AGAINST WHICH WE RAISED $150 MILLION, SO VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE RECEIVED A LOT OF BACKING FROM OUR EXISTING INVESTORS AS WELL AS NEW INVESTORS. THE MARKETS ARE OBVIOUSLY NOT EASY SIMPLY BECAUSE DPI'S HAVE COME DOWN IN THE U.S. AND OTHER DEVELOPED MARKETS. NEW ALLOCATIONS ARE THE ONES THAT SUFFER THE MOST WHEN THAT HAPPENS. HAVING SAID THAT, INDIA AS A MARKET IS NOW ON EVERYONE'S MIND FROM A DIVERSIFICATION PERSPECTIVE, FROM A SIZE OF GEOGRAPHY PERSPECTIVE. WE ARE ACTUALLY SEEING POSITIVE INTENT, AND WE FEEL FAIRLY CONFIDENT THAT WE WILL GET TO 225. HASLINDA: WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT SOUTH ASIA, SOME OF THE MARKETS HERE ARE ALSO DOMESTICALLY DRIVEN. INDONESIA, CASE IN POINT. UNFORTUNATELY, WE HAVE SEEN RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, VIOLENT PROTESTS. DOES THAT AFFECT HOW YOU LOOK AT THAT PARTICULAR MARKET? WHEN WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT OF OUR DOMESTIC MANDATE, WE HAD HOPED TO DO 50% SOUTHEAST ASIA AND 50% IN INDIA, BUT WE HAVE BECOME OVERWEIGHT ON INDIA OVER TIME. OUR DEPLOYMENT IS NOW 70%, 75% INDIA AND SLIGHTLY MORE OPPORTUNISTICALLY TOWARD SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND THE MAIN REASON IS I THINK THE EXIT LANDSCAPE HAS BEEN NOT AS STRONG AS IT HAS BEEN EITHER ON M & A OR ON THE PUBLIC MARKET SIDE. THERE IS NO ONE SINGLE MARKET HERE, SO FROM A REGULATION PERSPECTIVE, IF YOU ARE BUILDING A CONSUMER BUSINESS, YOU HAVE TO BUILD INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES ACROSS DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. FROM A CONSUMER MINDSET PERSPECTIVE, AND THEN EACH OF THESE GEOGRAPHIES IS SEEING THEIR OWN POLITICAL CHALLENGES WITH CORRUPTION BECOMING A FRONT AND CENTER IN INDONESIA AND THE PHILIPPINES, SO TODAY, WHILE WE HAVE TWO VERY LARGE INVESTMENTS IN THE PHILIPPINES, IT HAPPENS THAT'S THE ONLY MARKET WE HAVE INVESTED IN AND WE HAVE NOT REALLY DIPPED OUR FEET INTO INDONESIA YET. HASLINDA: THANK YOU FOR YOUR PERSPECTIVE TODAY. MANAGING PARTNER AT VENTURI PARTNERS. BEFORE WE GO, HERE IS A LOOK AT OUR SHOW FOR TOMORROW. WE KEEP THE FOCUS ON EMERGING MARKET STOCKS, PLUS WE DISCUSSED GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN INDIA'S CHIPS INDUSTRY. KEEP IT HERE WITH US. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a",

  "summary": "India has celebrated its decision to reduce tax on hundreds of consumer goods, including soaps and car, to stimulate spending and soften the blow from President Trump's tariffs. The move is part of a broader effort to boost local demand and support the economy in the face of the 50% TARIFFS, which will come into effect on SEPTEMBER 22. However, officials will increase taxes on certain items such as CIGARETTES, CHEWING TOBACCO, and LUXURY CARS. The CSI 300 INDEX dropped nearly 2% after a group of Chinese Regulators began Weakering MEASURES for Stock Stock. Meanwhile, investors are looking for clues on the Federal Reserve's next move. The article also discusses the impact of the TEMPLETON GLOBAL INVESTMENT'S CIO on the biggest market drivers in India.",
