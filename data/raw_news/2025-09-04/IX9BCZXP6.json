  "description": "Mary Coyne: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.  In the second quarter, sales trends sequentially improved month over month, enabling us to deliver total sales down less than 1% and an adjusted EBITDA of $25.6 million.  Improved traffic, both online and in stores, supported this performance, as well as increased promotional activity, which we leveraged to better align inventory to sales trends as we entered the back half of the year.",
  "content": "With respect to product, we need to widen the appeal of our assortment to attract new customers while continuing to deliver newness that is relevant and versatile to fit her lifestyle. Our new Chief Merchandising Officer, Courtney O\u2019Connor, has been partnering closely with Creative Director Elliot Staples and the Design Merchandising and Planning team to develop a compelling assortment for spring 2026, while making subtle refinements in the product assortments and presentations for fall and winter this year. We are going to focus on delivering a stronger, more cohesive product assortment moving forward, eliminating redundancy to incorporate new styles that serve more of the customer's lifestyle needs to capture a greater share of her wardrobe.\n\nTo do this, we must expand our customer file, attracting a significant number of new customers, re-engaging those who have shopped with us before, and continuing to delight our existing loyal customer base. In the near term, we plan to move quickly but thoughtfully, testing new initiatives and leaning into those that work to deliver on our objectives, and widening the aperture of our focus to appeal to a broader audience. Concentrating on driving customer growth, we will execute immediately on three areas: one, evolving our product assortment; two, enhancing the customer journey; and three, improving the way we work.\n\nImproved traffic, both online and in stores, supported this performance, as well as increased promotional activity, which we leveraged to better align inventory to sales trends as we entered the back half of the year. I am energized by what I see, having had 100 days to assess this business. We serve a growing and valuable demographic. We have a deep understanding of this customer segment and have therefore developed a loyal customer base. We operate with discipline, which has allowed us to consistently deliver high margins and generate significant free cash flow. We will continue to lean into these strengths and position the brand to drive long-term profitable growth.\n\nMary Coyne: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With my first full quarter as CEO of J.Jill completed, I want to begin by thanking our team for their dedication and support. Since joining in May, I've had the opportunity to dive deeper into all aspects of our business, and I remain confident in the significant opportunities ahead, despite navigating some near-term challenges. In the second quarter, sales trends sequentially improved month over month, enabling us to deliver total sales down less than 1% and an adjusted EBITDA of $25.6 million.\n\nAs we make these enhancements, we will also be leaning into expansion opportunities in areas such as accessories, building on what is currently a small but highly scalable business. Moving to our second area of focus, enhancing the customer journey, we are evaluating ways to expand our reach to capture the full marketing funnel: top, middle, and bottom. We just recently completed a small test with television advertising, and for the back half of this year, we made adjustments to the marketing mix, enabling greater flexibility to engage a wider audience.\n\nIn addition, as we evaluate the right balance across our marketing channels, we have reshot certain imagery for the second half of the year that you will begin to see across digital media, catalogs, in stores, and online soon. We run highly profitable stores, which also serve as a great marketing vehicle for the brand. They allow us to tell our product story to both new and existing customers, and we are excited for our upcoming store openings later this fall. We are confident in our long-term goal to open 50 stores by the end of 2029.\n\nAs we execute on this objective, we are constantly evaluating opportunities for store locations focused on driving productivity, welcoming new customers, and increasing brand awareness. We know the opportunity that is in front of us, and it is one that our whole organization is rallying around. To support this, we are focused on improving the way we work, leaning into technology capabilities that will enable us to work smarter, faster, and more effectively. This includes building a strategic technology roadmap, incorporating opportunities for AI implementation in order to accelerate growth, gain efficiencies, and improve the customer experience.\n\nWe're fostering a corporate culture that isn't just about process improvement, but about the agility and urgency needed to capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us. The team did a great job in executing the implementation of Order Management System (OMS), and we are pleased to share that we launched the new ship-from-store capabilities well ahead of plan and in time for the fall and winter season launches. As we continue to evolve the brand and progress forward, we are in the office collaborating with one another. There's a palpable energy across the organization.\n\nIn summary, I believe through the actions and strategies we are putting in place, we are addressing the right priorities, enabling us to build on the strengths of our proven operating model while capitalizing on the areas that will drive sustainable, profitable growth. With that said, we are continuing to operate in a very dynamic and uncertain environment, particularly as it relates to inflation and tariffs. In response, our team is leveraging our strong relationships with vendor partners and staying nimble and responsive as we navigate the evolving macro landscape. As we look toward 2026 and beyond, we are excited to write the next chapter, building a stronger, more agile business to deliver enhanced shareholder value.\n\nI look forward to updating you on our progress. Now, I'll turn it over to Mark for a detailed review of our financial performance.\n\nMark Webb: Thank you, Mary Ellen, and good morning, everyone. Following a challenging start to the second quarter, we were encouraged that sales trends stabilized and improved into June and July. We remained committed to our disciplines during the quarter, assessing slow-moving inventory units and taking action when necessary, resulting in improved end-of-quarter inventory levels compared to the end of Q1. We rolled out ship-from-store, our first omnichannel capability post-OMS Go Live, extending it to the entire fleet during the month of July. Our operating model continues to demonstrate its strength and resilience, generating $17 million of free cash flow in the quarter, resulting in end-of-quarter cash on the balance sheet of $46 million.\n\nNow, let me provide more details on our second quarter results. Total company sales for the quarter were about $154 million, down 0.8% compared to Q2 2024. Total company comparable sales for the quarter were down 1%. Store sales for Q2 were up 0.4% compared to Q2 2024, driven by three net new stores in the quarter compared to last year. Direct sales, which represented about 46% of total sales in the quarter, were down about 2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. As mentioned, sales trends improved each month of the second quarter.\n\nThis was in part due to positive customer response to the summer sale in July, which helped clear markdown goods and end the quarter with clean inventories. Q2 total company gross profit was about $105 million, down about $4 million compared to Q2 2024. Q2 gross margin was 68.4%, down about 210 basis points versus Q2 2024, driven primarily by a higher mix of markdown sales and higher full-price promotional rates as we took action and successfully moved the liable inventory we carried into the quarter. Gross margin rate was also pressured by approximately 50 basis points related to tariffs. SG&A expenses for the quarter were about $89 million compared to approximately $86 million last year.\n\nThe increase was driven by higher store expenses, driven by net new stores and higher occupancy costs on lease renewals, higher shipping expenses, non-recurring costs, and higher marketing expenses, partially offset by lower management incentive accruals and OMS-related costs, which were slightly below last year at about $300,000 for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $25.6 million in the quarter compared to $30.2 million in Q2 2024. Interest expense was $2.7 million in Q2 compared to $3.7 million last year. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.81 compared to $1.05 last year, which reflected an average weighted diluted share count of 15.3 million shares this year versus 15.1 million shares last year.\n\nWe repurchased 68,000 shares for approximately $1 million in the second quarter, bringing year-to-date repurchases to 255,000 shares for $4.5 million, resulting in approximately $0.01 benefit to reported second quarter adjusted diluted EPS. As of September 3, we have approximately $20 million remaining on the $25 million share repurchase authorization. We also paid our quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share on July 9, and as announced on August 27, our board approved payment of the Q3 dividend on October 1 to shareholders of record as of September 17. Please refer to today's press release for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nTurning to cash flow, for the quarter, we generated about $19 million of cash from operations, resulting in ending cash of about $46 million. Looking at inventory, we successfully cleared excess inventory units during the quarter, ending the second quarter with inventories about flat to last year, excluding the incremental costs associated with tariffs, including the costs of tariffs in both on-hand and in-transit inventory. Total reported inventory is up about 5% compared to the end of the second quarter last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were about $3 million compared to $2 million last year.\n\nInvestments were focused primarily on stores and the project to launch ship-from-store capabilities, which rolled out during the quarter and are now active in all stores across the fleet. We are excited to have this omni-capability enabled. It will help drive sales growth and support gross margins as previously unfulfillable demand is fulfilled. With respect to store count, we closed two stores during the second quarter. We did not open any new stores in the quarter, resulting in an end-of-quarter store count of 247 stores compared to 244 stores at the end of Q2 last year. Now, turning to our outlook.\n\nUnder the current global trade agreements, we now have more visibility to the impact of tariffs on our cost of goods sold and are working levers to mitigate the impact as much as possible. While there remains some uncertainty with how all of these actions by us and others across the industry will impact the U.S. consumer, we are providing certain guidance metrics for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, as detailed today in our press release. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $18 to $22 million.\n\nThis range assumes sales will be about flat to down low single digits for the quarter, and comps will be down in the low to mid-single digits. Gross margins are assumed to be down compared to last year, more than experienced in Q2, driven primarily by tariff pressure. With respect to tariffs, rates for our largest sourcing countries have landed on average around 20%, with India now at 50%. This compares to our prior assumption of 10% on all countries and 30% on China. Given these elevated rates, our guidance for the third quarter assumes approximately $5 million of incremental impact from tariffs, net of vendor-negotiated offsets.\n\nWe would assume a similar level going forward on a quarterly basis should current tariff policies remain in place. As Mary Ellen mentioned, we are working multiple levers to mitigate the impact as much as possible, including negotiating savings offsets with our vendors, adjusting on-order quantities, and strategically reviewing promotion and pricing strategies to drive higher average unit retails. With respect to capital expenditures for the year, we continue to expect spend of between $20 and $25 million. Regarding store count, we still expect to open between one and five net new stores this year, with two new stores planned to open toward the end of the third quarter.\n\nAs demonstrated year to date, the business continues to generate strong free cash flow, and we remain committed to our strategies to support total shareholder returns, which includes paying our dividend, repurchasing shares, and paying down debt. As previously mentioned, we announced our quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share payable on October 1 to shareholders of record on September 17. We have repurchased approximately 255,000 shares year to date, including the repurchase of 68,000 shares in Q2 for about $1 million. We will continue to opportunistically repurchase shares under the remaining $20 million of our $25 million authorization.\n\nWith funded debt currently sitting at $70 million on the balance sheet, with plenty of term remaining, we have ample flexibility and will continue to opportunistically evaluate refinancing options. Importantly, as Mary Ellen mentioned in her remarks, we are encouraged by the opportunities in front of us. We will continue to operate the business with discipline and are committed to making strategic investments this year to sharpen our brand voice through evolved and focused product assortments and a refined marketing approach to build our customer file and drive profitable growth. Thank you. I will now hand it back to the operator for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. Your first question today comes from the line of Jonna Kim from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\n\nJonna Kim: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Would love additional color around what drove the improvement in June and July. Mark, on tariffs, how should we think about sort of the annualized tariff impact next year as you mitigate some of the impact that you have this year? Would love additional color there. Thank you very much.\n\nMark Webb: Great. Thanks, Jonna. I'll jump in and maybe also provide some color as needed. The performance in Q2 was really driven by clearance activities coming out of the sort of slowdown we saw at the end of Q1, beginning of Q2, and really committing to our discipline to drive markdowns and promos as necessary. We saw a good customer response to that, really good response to the sale in July. That was what was behind the trends that we saw in Q2. Underneath that, traffic improved a little bit, conversion improved a little bit, which is not uncommon with elevated levels of promotion and markdown at the end of Q2.\n\nTariffs, what we've indicated, Jonna, is that tariffs really net of vendor-negotiated offsets of about $5 million in Q3 we expect will roll forward for the most part in the quarters to come. I think there's, without giving the specific answer, the annualized portion of the $5 million annualizing closer to $20 million. That's probably the best math at this point. Of course, we're working other levers around the on-order adjustments, as well as strategic pricing and promotions that over time may mitigate the absolute dollar amount of that tariff hit on a quarterly basis.\n\nJonna Kim: Got it. Just one question. In the second half, do you expect promotional level to be in line or elevated versus last year? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you so much.\n\nMark Webb: Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, the landscape from here forward somewhat changes from the landscape through the first half because now we're in sort of the tariff part of the year. Our expectation is, as we mentioned previously, our unit receipts in the back half are bought down closer to the mid-single digits. The sort of supply side is adjusted. The expectation would be that our strategic pricing actions, as well as tighter promotions, help to offset some level of those tariffs. We stand ready.\n\nIn all honesty, the guidance range that we provided for Q3 assumes a range of outcomes with specific respect to the receptivity of the customer to those pricing actions that we're taking, knowing that we're not the only ones. That level of macro uncertainty is what's sort of coloring the range of guidance, the low end being low receptivity to our pricing increases and the high end being a more receptive customer to the price increases.\n\nJonna Kim: Got it. Thank you.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Corey Tarlowe from Jefferies. Your line is open.\n\nCorey Tarlowe: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Mary Ellen, could you maybe talk a little bit about kind of 100 days into the business at this point, where you see opportunity for change, where you see opportunity to accelerate innovation, what's working in the business, and then maybe other areas or trends you've seen quarter to date that you might want to shed some light on? Thanks so much.\n\nMary Coyne: Good morning, Corey. Yes, super excited after 100 days and having had a moment to assess the business. I'm very pleased to report that we are already seeing cultural shifts within the organization, ship-from-store being the most recent example where the team's work together, greater sense of urgency and purpose, and delivered results well ahead of schedule. We are excited to see that in terms of the momentum and the team efforts here. As we look forward, our focus is on growing the customer file. That is truly what our goal is. There are three immediate areas of focus that we know we need to do that.\n\nIt's the product, it's the customer journey, and it's the way we work that I just referenced. Changes and innovation that we're working on right away are around marketing mix and attracting more customers. We know that we have an incredible demographic. She holds the largest wealth in this country. It's a growing segment. She's incredibly loyal to the brand she loves, and she wants to look more stylish today than ever. We are very excited that we have a base of a loyal customer, and the opportunity ahead of us immediately is to really think about the marketing mix that will add to that customer file.\n\nIn terms of what's working right now, we are in the back half of this year making slight refinements to our presentations, both in-store and online, and to our assets that will be shared, both catalog and digital. The focus really is on 2026 and how we drive compelling assortments to attract this customer.\n\nCorey Tarlowe: Great, thanks so much. Mark, could you maybe walk us through some of the puts and takes in margin? Obviously, tariffs was one that was already addressed and talked about, but are there any other considerations in the back half of this year? How do you see the path to kind of the high teens EBITDA margin continuing and sustaining over the long term? What do you think the key drivers are to get you there?\n\nMark Webb: Yeah, Corey, good questions. Look, I think in the back half of the year, the primary margin story comes down to tariffs. Part of that is the strategy that we're deploying on the strategic pricing and selective pricing. The goal really is to offset the dollar amount of the tariffs versus trying to mark it up and maintain the rate. That carries with it, out of the gates, full receptivity to the pricing increases margin pressure. As I mentioned, we're providing the closer-in outlook for Q3 that has a range of expectations around that receptivity. That's the primary.\n\nUnderneath the covers, there are some opportunities to offset that through the level of promotions executed in the business, the fact that the inventories are bought, as I mentioned, down in the back half of the year, which we feel is a prudent way to position the inventories.\n\nThat is enabling us to continue to manage the business with the discipline of the operating model on display, still cash-generative, and allowing us to make these investments, which to your last question is really the path for us going forward to invest, as Mary Ellen said, in expanding the customer file, the breadth of the assortment, the appeal of the assortment, and the marketing mix is really the opportunity to drive profitable growth deliberately in the coming year, which will be the kind of the go-forward story to drive that performance back into the business.\n\nIn the meantime, we continue those investments and continue to generate the cash and distribute the cash in support of our TSR strategies, as evidenced by the dividend and the share repurchase activity to date.\n\nCorey Tarlowe: Great, thanks so much, and best of luck.\n\nOperator: Again, if you'd like to ask a question, press star one on your telephone keypad. Your next question comes from the line of Janine Stichter from BTIG. Your line is open.\n\nJanine Stichter: Hi. Good morning. Mary Ellen, I just wanted to get your thoughts on the state of your consumer. I know your consumer tends to be pretty headline sensitive, and they weren't feeling great at the start of Q2. Outside of some of the noise you saw from promotions in Q2 that did drive sequential improvement, how is she feeling today?\n\nMary Coyne: Good morning, Janine. Thanks for the question. What we're seeing is the consumer slowly return. We saw that, again, sequentially month over month in Q2, and we're optimistic as we're heading into Q3. I believe as the tariff noise has settled, we have seen our comeback into the business, which is very exciting for us.\n\nJanine Stichter: Great. I just wanted to clarify around the back half promotional levels. Inventory is clean, but obviously, your consumer still is selective and price sensitive. Would you expect promotions to be up year over year in the back half, down, or is that still part of the range of outcomes you're contemplating?\n\nMary Coyne: As Mark said earlier, that will really depend on the consumer acceptance with our brand as well as our peers of the price increases. The range that we've put out there, sort of the high end is she's very accepting because we were strategic and thoughtful about where we increased prices. On the low end is that she is more resistant to the overall cost of purchases moving forward.\n\nJanine Stichter: Great, thanks so much, and best of luck.\n\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro from The Retail Tracker. Your line is open.\n\nMarni Shapiro: Hey, guys. Nice improvements here, at least in getting some traffic back in the stores. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit. You upgraded your POS systems. Will you, I guess, upgrade, modernize, change anything with inspired rewards? I think you have a pretty loyal customer, as far as I recall. Will you use that to sort of expand your base of customer? I just have one follow-up on that, if you wouldn't mind.\n\nMary Coyne: Sure. Marni, yes, we are very happy to have POS and Order Management System (OMS) implementations behind us. The team is currently working on drafting a reward program that is non-tender because, as you know, right now, the GACC, our own credit card program, is highly penetrated to our sales and a very loyal audience. We do have many programs for them. As I said, the team is working on one that's non-tender and one that we will have rolled out in the back half of the year.\n\nMarni Shapiro: Fantastic. You said you were going to launch, you launched some TV or you were testing some television. I'm curious what your thoughts are on social media content in real-life events. I feel like your customers, when I'm in your stores, they're all talking to each other. I'm curious what you think about those two aspects to grab people into your stores.\n\nMary Coyne: Great question. We are very clear that we need to get our message out to more people to drive awareness, all levels of the funnel. We would say particularly really looking at top and middle, as we've been converting very well on the bottom to grow the customer file. The television test was very small, and it was very local. It is super exciting for us because it did have a tremendous impact. As we look forward to changing the marketing mix, we will absolutely be looking to what you were talking, you know, more digital, more direct interaction. That mix going forward will be very different.\n\nHonestly, we'll be testing strategically in the back half of the year to really understand how we can free up some resources to really engage these new to brands and react, as opposed to focusing only on our existing file.\n\nMarni Shapiro: Fantastic. Can I sneak in just one more? I don't know if I'm projecting onto your stores, but in the last, I think, two weeks, even last week and a half, the stores already look different. They look cleaner. The front of the store looks different. I don't want to say younger, maybe more modern, the way things are paired. Am I projecting onto it, or have you already made changes in the merchandising without changing the product?\n\nMary Coyne: Marni, I love this question. Yes, for the back half of the year, as we have said, because the product was already locked in, what we have done is change the presentation. Both in stores and online, and to your point, making it much easier for the customer to shop, cleaner color stories. Honestly, we've rethought what we're doing in windows to make them more compelling. Yes, we are seeing a positive response so far. Very glad to hear that people are noticing. Thank you.\n\nOperator: That concludes our question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mary Ellen Coyne for some final closing remarks.\n\nMary Coyne: Thank you all for joining us today. We are focused and committed to executing on our objectives, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our next earnings call.\n\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.\n\nThe Motley Fool\u2019s analysts are tracking a massive shift in U.S. tech.

      "text": "Trump\u2019s Tariffs Just Launched A Potential $1.5 Trillion Opportunity\nNVIDIA is about to be \u201cMade in America.\u201d\nDo you know which stock we\u2019re talking about?\nDon\u2019t wait to find out.\nSimply click below to sign up and learn about this investment opportunity.\nThen act fast!\nSimply click below to sign up and learn more about this investment opportunity.\nThank you. You will be redirected momentarily\u2026\nFollowing a major tariff policy shift, a new AI Gold Rush is taking shape.\nIt\u2019s already being measured in trillions, and what we\u2019re witnessing could be a once-in-a-lifetime reshoring of America\u2019s tech infrastructure.\nBest of all: Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner is predicting there will be one stock that could be a clear winner.\nConsider this\u2026\nEarlier this year NVIDIA announced something unbelievably bold.\nEvery supercomputer would be built entirely in the USA - for the first time ever.\nThe total investment in America: $500 billion over four years.\nThat number should already have investors drooling with anticipation, but if you\u2019ve been paying attention, the story gets even better\u2026\nThat\u2019s because NVIDIA\u2019s announcement - while historic on its own - is just one of many dominoes we expect to fall in the near future.\n- Apple is furiously working to move production out of China, and recently announced $500 billion invested in the USA over the next four years.\n- And ChatGPT-creator OpenAI recently unveiled its \u2018Stargate\u2019 project that aims to invest $500 billion entirely in the United States in the next four years.\nAdd that up and it's already at $1.5 trillion.\nKeep in mind, NVIDIA was the first to act, announcing a bold $500 billion commitment to U.S. expansion almost immediately after the policy shift.\nSince then, we\u2019ve seen a growing wave of companies following in NVIDIA\u2019s gigantic footsteps\u2026 and all signs point to more on the way.\nWhat we\u2019re seeing is something that could be a once-in-a-lifetime reshoring of America\u2019s dominant technology companies.\nAll announced in what could be as short as a 90-day window. America\u2019s high-tech is now \u2018Made in the USA.\u2019\nHere\u2019s the best part: every media headline is focused on how bad tariffs are\u2026. And certainly, many companies will be losers.\nOnce again, we believe this is a once-in-a-lifetime shift happening rapidly before our eyes\u2026\nYet, almost no one is focusing on the fact that this multi-trillion dollar reshoring could mean potential MASSIVE gains for a small group of companies.\nThink of the companies that need to build trillions of dollars of factories, data centers, and other technology flooding back into America.\nLegendary investor and Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner just identified a small - less than 1/100th the size of NVIDIA - American company (headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut!) that does exactly this.\nIt specializes in the construction of massive technology projects and could soon become the \u2018story stock\u2019 of the potential Made in the USA boom.\nSo while some investors are content to sit and watch their net worth whittle away as tariff story after tariff story hits the news\u2026.\nWe believe we\u2019ve found something completely different.\nA stock that could become the next big winner of this possibly Made in the USA boom.\nBut \u2026. Tick, tick, tick\u2026 The clock is winding down. If you want to get invested before the next wave of technology companies announces their own Made in the USA plans\u2026\nYou need to consider acting now.

      "text": "Welcome to The Motley Fool! We hope you'll enjoy being a part of our Foolishness -- such as Fool.com, our subscription newsletters and their special websites, our discussion boards, CAPS, and whatever else we come up with (each a \u201cService,\u201d and collectively, the \"Services\"). But first things first: By using the Services, you're agreeing to be bound by these Terms and Conditions (\u201cTerms and Conditions\u201d or \u201cTerms\u201d) INCLUDING THE BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER DETAILED IN SECTION 13. These Terms govern your use and access to the website and all our Services. We may change these terms at any time, but we will post a notice on this website of any material changes. Your continued use of The Motley Fool and its Services means that you accept any new or modified terms and conditions. So please check back here from time to time.\nSome Services are works in progress. We reserve the right to change or even eliminate them with no notice, at our sole discretion.\n1. Registration\nExcept as expressly provided in these Terms and Conditions, members may only maintain one active registration with The Motley Fool. In other words, it's one registration per person. The only exception to this rule is if you wish to create more than one CAPS profile, in which case you may have a corresponding number of registrations. Any other use of multiple accounts or aliases on our Services, including attempts to mislead, defraud, confuse, or otherwise trick us or our members, is a breach of these Terms and Conditions.\nIf you subscribe to one of our premium Services, you will be asked to create a password, which you'll need to access the Service. Should you wish to post a message on the discussion boards or comment on an article or a blog, you'll also be required to choose a user name.\nAs a registered user, you can update your account settings, including your email address, by going to the My Fool tab up top. There, you can also change your password at any time and your user name up to three times in a calendar year. Also, if you forget either your password or user name, you can go to this page for help.\n2. Premium Services\nWhen subscribing to a premium Service such as one of our newsletters, you will need to provide us with your name, email address, and billing and shipping addresses, as well as your credit card information. You agree to pay the applicable subscription fee as set forth on this site. Sales taxes may be charged in addition to the subscription fee. BY PLACING YOUR ORDER, YOU PROVIDE YOUR ELECTRONIC AUTHORIZATION FOR FUTURE CHARGES AGAINST YOUR CREDIT CARD ON FILE UNLESS YOU CANCEL.\nYou certify that all information you provide is accurate. You also agree to maintain and update your information as necessary so that it remains accurate and current. In the event that any information you provide is inaccurate or not up to date, The Motley Fool reserves the right to cancel your subscription.\nWe reserve the right to refuse or discontinue the supply of a Service to any user at any time at our sole discretion.\nUnless stated otherwise, membership to any Service is for online and/or electronic access only. Certain promotions may offer features that are issued in physical form. Shipping of any goods or service associated with these promotions is limited to the U.S./APO. Physical fulfillment of goods or services not specifically mentioned in a promotion is at the sole discretion of the Fool.\nOur Services generally deliver their content via email including trade alerts or recommendations, recent actionable investing guidance, Best Buys Now, and other important stock news. There is no opt-out choice available for these emails (unless you cancel your subscription). Of course, you can always opt out of our marketing emails on the settings page.\nTrial Terms, Automatic Billing and Cancellation Policy\nSome Services may provide a free trial or introductory offer. If such an offer is provided, only one per person or household is allowed at any given point in time. In addition, there is a limit of one trial per person and household in any given six-month period unless otherwise stated in the offer.\nUpon signing up for a free trial, you will have access to the Service for the promotional trial period. If you cancel prior to the end of the promotional offer period, your credit card will not be charged. If you don't cancel your subscription within the trial offer period, we will charge the primary credit card you provided during the sign-up process. You may contact Member Support at [email protected] to terminate your trial enrollment.\nYour membership will automatically renew at the then-current rate, until you notify us of your decision to terminate your membership. Many subscriptions will renew for one-year or one-month terms, regardless of the offer under which the subscription was initiated. For subscription terms greater than three months we will email you about the length and price for your renewal before we charge you. Monthly subscription terms will be notified annually regarding future renewals. Automatic renewal term lengths are subject to change and we will email you about the length and price for your automatic renewal before we charge you. If you would like to turn off automatic renewal, or extend your subscription for additional years, please contact Member Support. BY ALLOWING FOR YOUR RENEWAL, YOU PROVIDE YOUR ELECTRONIC AUTHORIZATION FOR FUTURE CHARGES AGAINST YOUR CREDIT CARD ON FILE OR APPLE PAY. Accordingly, you agree that your membership fee or subscription will be billed automatically at the beginning of each renewal period at the then-current rate (plus sales tax, if applicable) to the credit card you used in your most recent transaction with us. Any subscription purchased using Apple Pay will continue to renew on Apple Pay.\nThe Motley Fool reserves the right to increase a Service's fees or institute new charges upon reasonable notice. Service fees are due in advance.\nEnrollment Fees\nFrom time-to-time, we may offer enrollment fee based products which may include an ongoing monthly fee. There is no refund offered for the enrollment fee under these terms. Based on the specific terms of the offer under which you buy the product, the fee may be refundable or eligible for a credit transfer. Please see full offer terms for your product or service for more details.\nRefunds\nDifferent Services (and sometimes specific offers) have different refund policies (including some that offer no refunds, or some that offer different pricing depending on availability of refunds). Please review the specific terms of your offer before signing up as you are agreeing to be bound those terms. If you are unsure of your cancellation rights, please contact Member Support.\nPlease note that most refunds are only available to first-time subscribers. If you subscribe to a Service that allows for refunds beyond 30 days, and cancel (and receive a refund) and then subscribe again, you will not receive a refund after the first 30 days.\nFrom time to time, The Motley Fool offers its premium services through third-party vendors. In such cases, the vendor\u2019s refund policy would apply and may differ from your Service (or specific offer).\nTransfer; Discontinuing a Service\nYou cannot transfer your subscription to someone else, except through bequeathment or by a court order. In the event a subscription is transferred, it will continue through the end of its term and can be renewed at the then-current price and conditions. For assistance in this situation, please contact Member Services.\nIn the event that we discontinue a Service, you agree that The Motley Fool may transfer your subscription to another Service of equal or greater value.\n3. Credits, Transfer Credits, and Bonus Credits Information\nSome of our services provide the option to transfer some or all of the purchase price towards a different Motley Fool service, (a \u201cTransfer Credit(s)\u201d). Depending on the terms of your purchase, you may be allowed to transfer the full or pro-rated credit from your purchase into a Transfer Credit. Most services eligible for a Transfer Credit will allow an exchange for a different service using the Transfer Credit within 30 days of the initial purchase, and there are services that do not allow for credits of any kind.\nIf you are unsure whether or not your service is eligible for a Transfer Credit please contact [email protected].\nIf you take advantage of a Transfer Credit guarantee, please also note that you will lose access to any product(s) and benefits included in the original promotional offer, including additional services or reports that may have been included as a bonus or incentive for taking advantage of the offer.\nIf the list price of the service you would like to transfer into is more than the amount of Transfer Credits you have, you will receive a partial term of the service. If the list price of the service you would like to transfer into is less than the amount of Transfer Credits, you will be given a service extension such that all Transfer Credits are consumed. In both cases the usual automatic renewal notice will be emailed a month prior to the adjusted end-date.\nWhen using a Transfer Credit, the term length of the service being transferred into cannot extend beyond three years. In the event your Transfer Credit would result in a service term greater than three years, your subscription will be extended to three years and the remaining Transfer Credits will immediately expire.\nSome purchases may include a temporary bonus credit (the \u201cBonus Credit\u201d) that can be applied to a future purchase. These Bonus Credits are valid for 30 days from the date of purchase, and multiple Bonus Credits may be combined for a single purchase. If any Bonus Credits is used on a purchase, the remaining value of all active Bonus Credits immediately expires. Bonus Credits may not be used to early renew a service or extend an existing subscription.\nTransfer and Bonus Credits may be combined for a single purchase. In the event they are combined, the combined credit may only be used for a single purchase, after which all Transfer and Bonus Credits will immediately expire.\nProducts obtained using Transfer Credits and Bonus Credits must be obtained at the list price of the product being transferred into, and cannot be combined with any promotional offers or discounts. Products and services obtained using Transfer or Bonus Credits of any kind are not eligible for exchange, refund, swaps, or any other action that would result in the creation of any Bonus Credits.\nThe Motley Fool reserves the right to disallow Transfer Credits, discounts, or Bonus Credits into certain services depending on insufficient credit, product openings, investment timelines, a member's history of transfers or prior refunds, or for any other reason at The Motley Fool\u2019s sole discretion.\nAt certain times we may offer subscriptions or upgrades to services that may contain components of other services you might currently subscribe to. These offers may include prorated Transfer Credit value for your existing subscriptions. If you purchase one of these subscriptions or upgrades the prorated Transfer Credit value from any existing subscription(s) on your account will be used in its entirety towards the purchase, and the prior-existing subscription will be cancelled upon purchase of the new subscription.\n4. Affiliate Marketing Programs\nSome of our brands such as Motley Fool Money, review various products and services. We may be compensated by third parties whose products we review. This compensation may impact where reviews and offers appear, with higher paying partners appearing higher on a page or in a more prominent position. None of our brands can or does promise to be comprehensive with their reviews of any particular marketplace, and the companies covered may heavily tilt towards partners.\nThat being said, we take try to make sure that our editorial opinions are not affected by our compensation, and no partner or advertiser will review, edit, endorse, or approve editorial content. We also make sure that the editorial teams of any brand remains distinct from the editorial team writing content for Fool.com or our premium services.\nNo reviews of products or services should be construed as an endorsement or guarantee of any kind. We do the best we can to make sure that the information we rely upon for our reviews is true and current, but we cannot and will not warranty that it actually is, or that we have not been confused or misled before or after publication.\nAny service or product not offered by The Motley Fool is subject to its own terms and conditions, including about how they may use the information you provide to them, which should be provided by the company through which you are receiving the product or service, and any use of a product or service not offered by The Motley Fool is done so at your own risk.\n5. Additional and Third-Party Terms of Use\nPlease note that certain individual Services or products may have their own, or additional, terms and conditions. In the event of a conflict, the terms for the individual Service will control with respect to the Service in question. So please be sure to review any additional terms and conditions with respect to any specific Service before subscribing.\nSome portions of our site use Google Maps APIs, or other Google APIs. If you use those parts of our site, you are also bound by the Google Terms of Service. If you do not wish to be bound by these terms, or any of the terms contained within these Rules, please do not use our site.\n6. CAPS\nCAPS is The Motley Fool's service that allows you to make predictions about stocks, see others' predictions, aggregate community opinions, and track their accuracy. By putting together lots of information from a variety of sources, we hope to provide participants with a way to a) have fun and b) learn to make better investment decisions.\nYou should not assume that the opinions that people express in CAPS are the opinions of The Motley Fool or anything other than the opinions of the individuals expressing them.\nWhen you look at other people's predictions, you should remember that those people may have interests in the stocks that they're making predictions about. For example, some people may hope a company's stock will go up because they own many shares of it; others may hope that it will rise because they (or their sister) work for the company; others may hope that the stock will rise because that will increase their CAPS score and their international prestige. When you review people's predictions (or the stock tips you see on television or hear in the supermarket), you should not assume that the person making a prediction is unbiased or independent. One of the beauties of CAPS, though, is that you can see the performance of people's predictions over time and, we hope, distinguish sound analysis from self-serving nonsense.\nMotley Fool employees may participate in CAPS and they may have interests in the stocks about which they make predictions. Employees display their positions in their online TMF profiles at Fool.com. Any predictions made by Fool employees are their own. They are not speaking on behalf of our company and these predictions are not Motley Fool recommendations.\n7. Intellectual Property\nAll of the Content on our websites and any Service we provide is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws and is the property of The Motley Fool and/or providers of the content under license. By \"Content\" we mean any information, mode of expression, or other materials and services found on The Motley Fool. This includes message boards, blogs, CAPS picks, ratings, podcasts, chats, software, our writings, graphics, videos, and any and all other features. You can find out more information on copyright law and the Internet at www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html.\nYou may make one copy of the Content for your personal, non-commercial use, provided that any material copied remains intact and includes the following notice: \"Copyright 1995-2018 [or whatever the current year is] The Motley Fool. All rights reserved.\" Any other copying, distribution, storing, or transmission of any kind, or any commercial use of our Content, is prohibited without The Fool's prior written permission. That means you may not sell, auction, transfer or barter your subscription or any individual publication. You can make or end your own CAPS picks at any time, but those picks, their scoring history, your scoring history, and data aggregated by CAPS remain the property of The Motley Fool.\nYou also may not republish, post, transmit, or distribute the Content to online bulletin and message boards, blogs, chat rooms, intranets, or anywhere else without our consent. You further agree not to create abstracts from or scrape our Content, including CAPS ratings, for use on another website or service (including our own personal forums and blogs). In short, you may not post our Content anywhere else online. Aside from opening yourself up to liability, distributing our premium Services, stock picks, and performance data to other sites and forums is unfair to our members who pay good money to receive our Content. So please don't do it.\nPlease note that notwithstanding the foregoing, when you post content (such as a message-board post or CAPS pitch), you are not somehow surrendering your copyright in your expression, but you are granting us an unlimited license to use it. Specifically, by posting content, you agree that The Motley Fool has an irrevocable, perpetual, and worldwide license to use republish, distribute, reproduce, display, communicate to the public, adapt, perform, store, translate, sublicense, and promote anything you post on our websites. This includes the rights to syndicate and make derivative works out of your content. If you don't want us to use or republish your content, then please don't post it on our websites. We'll only republish your content in context, and we'll credit you as author (unless we're using small quotations). We won't republish your posts in advertising without your permission. And we promise not to mock you unless it would amuse us.\nWe also ask that you only upload or include on our Services materials you have the right to use. While we don\u2019t mind if Peter Parker posts photos he\u2019s taken on our platform, we do ask that he not repost images he\u2019s already sold or licensed to The Daily Bugle. If you have a good faith belief that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please notify our Copyright Agent.\nYou agree not to display any of The Motley Fool's trademarks or use them in any manner without our express written permission. You can find the list of our trademarks here.\nSome features of our site are patented under U.S. Patent No. 7,813,986 and U.S. Patent No. 7,882,006.\n8. Conduct\nThe Motley Fool champions active and open debate among our members. All we ask is that it's done in a lawful and civil manner -- be it posting on our boards, commenting on blogs or articles, replying to CAPS pitches, or using our system to contact a fellow member in any way.\nAccordingly, you agree to use The Motley Fool for lawful purposes only. You may not use or allow others to use your Fool membership to:\n- Post or transmit any content that is disruptive, uncivil, abusive, vulgar, profane, obscene, hateful, fraudulent, threatening, harassing, defamatory, or which discloses private or personal matters concerning any person;\n\u2022 Post or transmit any material that you don't have the right to transmit under law (such as copyrights, trade secrets, or securities) or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as nondisclosure agreements);\n\u2022 Post, transmit, or link to sexually explicit material;\n\u2022 Impersonate any person, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity;\n\u2022 Post or transmit any advertising, promotional materials, or other forms of solicitation, including chain letters and pyramid schemes;\n\u2022 Violate any applicable law or regulation while accessing and using our sites, including, without limitation, the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the national or other securities exchanges (especially and including the rule against making false or misleading statements to manipulate the price of any security);\n\u2022 Offer, sell, or buy any security;\n\u2022 Post or transmit any file that contains viruses, corrupted files, \"Trojan Horses,\" or any other contaminating or destructive features that may damage someone's computer;\n\u2022 Forge headers or manipulate identifiers or other data in order to disguise the origin of any content transmitted through our sites or to manipulate your presence on our sites;\n\u2022 Use any automated means, including, without limitation, agents, robots, scripts, or spiders, to access, monitor, copy or harvest data from any part of our sites;\n\u2022 Take any action that imposes an unreasonably or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure or disrupts the functioning of our systems or Services; and\n\u2022 Take any action that damages or disrupts the functioning of our systems or Services.\nUnauthorized access of our sites is a breach of these Terms and Conditions and a violation of the law. You agree not to access our sites by any means other than through the interfaces we provide for use in our accessing our sites.\nThe Motley Fool may at any time, without prior notice and at our sole discretion, remove any post, terminate any membership, remove any individual CAPS picks, delete any CAPS players, remove any CAPS scorecards, or take any action for violating the above (and, if we may say so, sensible) provisions or otherwise taking an action disruptive to a Service. In the event TMF terminates your premium Service, you will receive a prorated refund at our discretion.\nYou are responsible for statements made and actions taken through the use of your password, so please maintain the confidentiality of your password. You agree to immediately notify Member Support of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your username and password. We will not be responsible for any loss to you arising from unauthorized use of your data. For more information on posting, please see our Posting Guidelines.\nIf you see something that you feel is a violation of the Fool's Rules, please notify us by emailing [email protected].\n9. No Personalized Advice\nWe want to help you make money. However, The Motley Fool is not in the business of rendering personalized investment advice. We can't know all the relevant facts about you and your individual needs, and we cannot claim or represent that any particular Services are suitable for you. Accordingly, you agree that any recommendation or action taken by a Service does not constitute a recommendation that a particular security, strategy, or action is suitable for you. If you want personal advice, then you should seek a registered investment advisor.\nThe Motley Fool may partner with third parties in order to make buying our Services' recommendations easier for you. We will not, and cannot, trade on your behalf at your brokerage. Only you can decide whether or not a stock is right for you and you agree to be liable for any trades you initiate at your brokerage using tools that we or our partners provide.\nAffiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no nonpublic knowledge of our affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates\u2019 personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published.\n10. You Bear Responsibility for Your Financial and Investment Decisions\nOne of the principal tenets here at the Fool is that the best person to handle your finances is you. By your use of our Services, you're agreeing that you bear responsibility for your own investment research and investment decisions. You also agree that The Motley Fool, its directors, its employees, and its agents will not be liable for any investment decision made or action taken by you and others based on news, information, opinion, or any other material published through our Services.\n11. Disclaimer of Warranties and Liabilities\nPlease read The Motley Fool's Disclaimer, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe Motley Fool provides a very broad range of information and commentary via its many Services. Consequently, as a result of the diverse opinions of our staff, a Fool Service may, from time to time, take actions or issue recommendations with regard to specific securities that are different from those taken or issued by another Service we provide.\nThe Motley Fool does not warrant the completeness or accuracy of the Content found in our Services or its usefulness for any particular purpose. And although we have the hardest-working, most talented techies in the business, The Motley Fool makes no promises that our content or any of the Services will be delivered to you on an uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free basis. In fact, we're not making any promises or warranties except that we'll do our best to provide interesting and helpful information, education, and entertainment. Other than that, we reserve the right to be wrong, stupid, or even foolish (with a small \"f\").\nNow what does all this mean? It means that you agree that under no circumstances will The Motley Fool, its employees, or its agents be liable for direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, or any other type of damages resulting from your use, purchase, or downloading of any material on our Websites, or arising from or related to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. This includes, but is no way limited to, loss or injury caused in whole or in part by our negligence or by stuff beyond our control in creating or delivering any of our Services. This disclaimer of liability does not apply in New Jersey.\nThe Fool relies on various sources of information that we believe to be accurate and reliable. There are also literally thousands of contributors here -- most, we believe, with incredibly interesting and insightful information and opinions to share. But we can't and won't take responsibility for, or make any claims or representations about, the accuracy, completeness, or even the truth of every bit of data, information, and opinion provided through our Services. Remember: All information and content provided on or by The Motley Fool is to be used on an \"as is, with all faults, we're not perfect\" basis.\nObligatory Capitalized Disclaimers of Liability:\nEXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE INAPPLICABLE OR PROHIBITED BY LAW, THE WEBSITE AND PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CONTAINED AND OFFERED ON THE WEBSITE ARE PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d AND ON AN \u201cAS AVAILABLE\u201d BASIS.

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

You will be redirected momentarily\u2026\nFollowing a major tariff policy shift, a new AI Gold Rush is taking shape.\nIt\u2019s already being measured in trillions, and what we\u2019re witnessing could be a once-in-a-lifetime reshoring of America\u2019s tech infrastructure.\nBest of all: Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner is predicting there will be one stock that could be a clear winner.\nConsider this\u2026\nEarlier this year NVIDIA announced something unbelievably bold.\nEvery supercomputer would be built entirely in the USA - for the first time ever.\nThe total investment in America: $500 billion over four years.\nThat number should already have investors drooling with anticipation, but if you\u2019ve been paying attention, the story gets even better\u2026\nThat\u2019s because NVIDIA\u2019s announcement - while historic on its own - is just one of many dominoes we expect to fall in the near future.\n- Apple is furiously working to move production out of China, and recently announced $500 billion invested in the USA over the next four years.\n- And ChatGPT-creator OpenAI recently unveiled its \u2018Stargate\u2019 project that aims to invest $500 billion entirely in the United States in the next four years.\nAdd that up and it's already at $1.5 trillion.\nKeep in mind, NVIDIA was the first to act, announcing a bold $500 billion commitment to U.S. expansion almost immediately after the policy shift.\nSince then, we\u2019ve seen a growing wave of companies following in NVIDIA\u2019s gigantic footsteps\u2026 and all signs point to more on the way.\nWhat we\u2019re seeing is something that could be a once-in-a-lifetime reshoring of America\u2019s dominant technology companies.\nAll announced in what could be as short as a 90-day window. America\u2019s high-tech is now \u2018Made in the USA.\u2019\nHere\u2019s the best part: every media headline is focused on how bad tariffs are\u2026. And certainly, many companies will be losers.\nOnce again, we believe this is a once-in-a-lifetime shift happening rapidly before our eyes\u2026\nYet, almost no one is focusing on the fact that this multi-trillion dollar reshoring could mean potential MASSIVE gains for a small group of companies.\nThink of the companies that need to build trillions of dollars of factories, data centers, and other technology flooding back into America.\nLegendary investor and Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner just identified a small - less than 1/100th the size of NVIDIA - American company (headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut!) that does exactly this.\nIt specializes in the construction of massive technology projects and could soon become the \u2018story stock\u2019 of the potential Made in the USA boom.\nSo while some investors are content to sit and watch their net worth whittle away as tariff story after tariff story hits the news\u2026.\nWe believe we\u2019ve found something completely different.\nA stock that could become the next big winner of this possibly Made in the USA boom.\nBut \u2026. Tick, tick, tick\u2026 The clock is winding down. If you want to get invested before the next wave of technology companies announces their own Made in the USA plans\u2026\nYou need to consider acting now.

With my first full quarter as CEO of J.Jill completed, I want to begin by thanking our team for their dedication and support. Since joining in May, I've had the opportunity to dive deeper into all aspects of our business, and I remain confident in the significant opportunities ahead, despite navigating some near-term challenges. In the second quarter, sales trends sequentially improved month over month, enabling us to deliver total sales down less than 1% and an adjusted EBITDA of $25.6 million.\nImproved traffic, both online and in stores, supported this performance, as well as increased promotional activity, which we leveraged to better align inventory to sales trends as we entered the back half of the year. I am energized by what I see, having had 100 days to assess this business. We serve a growing and valuable demographic. We have a deep understanding of this customer segment and have therefore developed a loyal customer base. We operate with discipline, which has allowed us to consistently deliver high margins and generate significant free cash flow. We will continue to lean into these strengths and position the brand to drive long-term profitable growth.\nTo do this, we must expand our customer file, attracting a significant number of new customers, re-engaging those who have shopped with us before, and continuing to delight our existing loyal customer base. In the near term, we plan to move quickly but thoughtfully, testing new initiatives and leaning into those that work to deliver on our objectives, and widening the aperture of our focus to appeal to a broader audience. Concentrating on driving customer growth, we will execute immediately on three areas: one, evolving our product assortment; two, enhancing the customer journey; and three, improving the way we work.\nWith respect to product, we need to widen the appeal of our assortment to attract new customers while continuing to deliver newness that is relevant and versatile to fit her lifestyle. Our new Chief Merchandising Officer, Courtney O\u2019Connor, has been partnering closely with Creative Director Elliot Staples and the Design Merchandising and Planning team to develop a compelling assortment for spring 2026, while making subtle refinements in the product assortments and presentations for fall and winter this year. We are going to focus on delivering a stronger, more cohesive product assortment moving forward, eliminating redundancy to incorporate new styles that serve more of the customer's lifestyle needs to capture a greater share of her wardrobe.\nAs we make these enhancements, we will also be leaning into expansion opportunities in areas such as accessories, building on what is currently a small but highly scalable business. Moving to our second area of focus, enhancing the customer journey, we are evaluating ways to expand our reach to capture the full marketing funnel: top, middle, and bottom. We just recently completed a small test with television advertising, and for the back half of this year, we made adjustments to the marketing mix, enabling greater flexibility to engage a wider audience.\nIn addition, as we evaluate the right balance across our marketing channels, we have reshot certain imagery for the second half of the year that you will begin to see across digital media, catalogs, in stores, and online soon. We run highly profitable stores, which also serve as a great marketing vehicle for the brand. They allow us to tell our product story to both new and existing customers, and we are excited for our upcoming store openings later this fall. We are confident in our long-term goal to open 50 stores by the end of 2029.\nAs we execute on this objective, we are constantly evaluating opportunities for store locations focused on driving productivity, welcoming new customers, and increasing brand awareness. We know the opportunity that is in front of us, and it is one that our whole organization is rallying around. To support this, we are focused on improving the way we work, leaning into technology capabilities that will enable us to work smarter, faster, and more effectively. This includes building a strategic technology roadmap, incorporating opportunities for AI implementation in order to accelerate growth, gain efficiencies, and improve the customer experience.\nWe're fostering a corporate culture that isn't just about process improvement, but about the agility and urgency needed to capitalize on the opportunities ahead of us. The team did a great job in executing the implementation of Order Management System (OMS), and we are pleased to share that we launched the new ship-from-store capabilities well ahead of plan and in time for the fall and winter season launches. As we continue to evolve the brand and progress forward, we are in the office collaborating with one another. There's a palpable energy across the organization.\nIn summary, I believe through the actions and strategies we are putting in place, we are addressing the right priorities, enabling us to build on the strengths of our proven operating model while capitalizing on the areas that will drive sustainable, profitable growth. With that said, we are continuing to operate in a very dynamic and uncertain environment, particularly as it relates to inflation and tariffs. In response, our team is leveraging our strong relationships with vendor partners and staying nimble and responsive as we navigate the evolving macro landscape. As we look toward 2026 and beyond, we are excited to write the next chapter, building a stronger, more agile business to deliver enhanced shareholder value.\nI look forward to updating you on our progress. Now, I'll turn it over to Mark for a detailed review of our financial performance.\nMark Webb: Thank you, Mary Ellen, and good morning, everyone. Following a challenging start to the second quarter, we were encouraged that sales trends stabilized and improved into June and July. We remained committed to our disciplines during the quarter, assessing slow-moving inventory units and taking action when necessary, resulting in improved end-of-quarter inventory levels compared to the end of Q1. We rolled out ship-from-store, our first omnichannel capability post-OMS Go Live, extending it to the entire fleet during the month of July. Our operating model continues to demonstrate its strength and resilience, generating $17 million of free cash flow in the quarter, resulting in end-of-quarter cash on the balance sheet of $46 million.\nNow, let me provide more details on our second quarter results. Total company sales for the quarter were about $154 million, down 0.8% compared to Q2 2024. Total company comparable sales for the quarter were down 1%. Store sales for Q2 were up 0.4% compared to Q2 2024, driven by three net new stores in the quarter compared to last year. Direct sales, which represented about 46% of total sales in the quarter, were down about 2% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024. As mentioned, sales trends improved each month of the second quarter.\nThis was in part due to positive customer response to the summer sale in July, which helped clear markdown goods and end the quarter with clean inventories. Q2 total company gross profit was about $105 million, down about $4 million compared to Q2 2024. Q2 gross margin was 68.4%, down about 210 basis points versus Q2 2024, driven primarily by a higher mix of markdown sales and higher full-price promotional rates as we took action and successfully moved the liable inventory we carried into the quarter. Gross margin rate was also pressured by approximately 50 basis points related to tariffs. SG&A expenses for the quarter were about $89 million compared to approximately $86 million last year.\nThe increase was driven by higher store expenses, driven by net new stores and higher occupancy costs on lease renewals, higher shipping expenses, non-recurring costs, and higher marketing expenses, partially offset by lower management incentive accruals and OMS-related costs, which were slightly below last year at about $300,000 for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $25.6 million in the quarter compared to $30.2 million in Q2 2024. Interest expense was $2.7 million in Q2 compared to $3.7 million last year. Adjusted net income per diluted share was $0.81 compared to $1.05 last year, which reflected an average weighted diluted share count of 15.3 million shares this year versus 15.1 million shares last year.\nWe repurchased 68,000 shares for approximately $1 million in the second quarter, bringing year-to-date repurchases to 255,000 shares for $4.5 million, resulting in approximately $0.01 benefit to reported second quarter adjusted diluted EPS. As of September 3, we have approximately $20 million remaining on the $25 million share repurchase authorization. We also paid our quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share on July 9, and as announced on August 27, our board approved payment of the Q3 dividend on October 1 to shareholders of record as of September 17. Please refer to today's press release for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.\nTurning to cash flow, for the quarter, we generated about $19 million of cash from operations, resulting in ending cash of about $46 million. Looking at inventory, we successfully cleared excess inventory units during the quarter, ending the second quarter with inventories about flat to last year, excluding the incremental costs associated with tariffs, including the costs of tariffs in both on-hand and in-transit inventory. Total reported inventory is up about 5% compared to the end of the second quarter last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were about $3 million compared to $2 million last year.\nInvestments were focused primarily on stores and the project to launch ship-from-store capabilities, which rolled out during the quarter and are now active in all stores across the fleet. We are excited to have this omni-capability enabled. It will help drive sales growth and support gross margins as previously unfulfillable demand is fulfilled. With respect to store count, we closed two stores during the second quarter. We did not open any new stores in the quarter, resulting in an end-of-quarter store count of 247 stores compared to 244 stores at the end of Q2 last year. Now, turning to our outlook.\nUnder the current global trade agreements, we now have more visibility to the impact of tariffs on our cost of goods sold and are working levers to mitigate the impact as much as possible. While there remains some uncertainty with how all of these actions by us and others across the industry will impact the U.S. consumer, we are providing certain guidance metrics for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, as detailed today in our press release. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $18 to $22 million.\nThis range assumes sales will be about flat to down low single digits for the quarter, and comps will be down in the low to mid-single digits. Gross margins are assumed to be down compared to last year, more than experienced in Q2, driven primarily by tariff pressure. With respect to tariffs, rates for our largest sourcing countries have landed on average around 20%, with India now at 50%. This compares to our prior assumption of 10% on all countries and 30% on China. Given these elevated rates, our guidance for the third quarter assumes approximately $5 million of incremental impact from tariffs, net of vendor-negotiated offsets.\nWe would assume a similar level going forward on a quarterly basis should current tariff policies remain in place. As Mary Ellen mentioned, we are working multiple levers to mitigate the impact as much as possible, including negotiating savings offsets with our vendors, adjusting on-order quantities, and strategically reviewing promotion and pricing strategies to drive higher average unit retails. With respect to capital expenditures for the year, we continue to expect spend of between $20 and $25 million. Regarding store count, we still expect to open between one and five net new stores this year, with two new stores planned to open toward the end of the third quarter.\nAs demonstrated year to date, the business continues to generate strong free cash flow, and we remain committed to our strategies to support total shareholder returns, which includes paying our dividend, repurchasing shares, and paying down debt. As previously mentioned, we announced our quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share payable on October 1 to shareholders of record on September 17. We have repurchased approximately 255,000 shares year to date, including the repurchase of 68,000 shares in Q2 for about $1 million. We will continue to opportunistically repurchase shares under the remaining $20 million of our $25 million authorization.\nWith funded debt currently sitting at $70 million on the balance sheet, with plenty of term remaining, we have ample flexibility and will continue to opportunistically evaluate refinancing options. Importantly, as Mary Ellen mentioned in her remarks, we are encouraged by the opportunities in front of us. We will continue to operate the business with discipline and are committed to making strategic investments this year to sharpen our brand voice through evolved and focused product assortments and a refined marketing approach to build our customer file and drive profitable growth. Thank you. I will now hand it back to the operator for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad to raise your hand and join the queue. If you would like to withdraw your question, simply press star one again. Your first question today comes from the line of Jonna Kim from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJonna Kim: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Would love additional color around what drove the improvement in June and July. Mark, on tariffs, how should we think about sort of the annualized tariff impact next year as you mitigate some of the impact that you have this year? Would love additional color there. Thank you very much.\nMark Webb: Great. Thanks, Jonna. I'll jump in and maybe also provide some color as needed. The performance in Q2 was really driven by clearance activities coming out of the sort of slowdown we saw at the end of Q1, beginning of Q2, and really committing to our discipline to drive markdowns and promos as necessary. We saw a good customer response to that, really good response to the sale in July. That was what was behind the trends that we saw in Q2. Underneath that, traffic improved a little bit, conversion improved a little bit, which is not uncommon with elevated levels of promotion and markdown at the end of Q2.\nTariffs, what we've indicated, Jonna, is that tariffs really net of vendor-negotiated offsets of about $5 million in Q3 we expect will roll forward for the most part in the quarters to come. I think there's, without giving the specific answer, the annualized portion of the $5 million annualizing closer to $20 million. That's probably the best math at this point. Of course, we're working other levers around the on-order adjustments, as well as strategic pricing and promotions that over time may mitigate the absolute dollar amount of that tariff hit on a quarterly basis.\nJonna Kim: Got it. Just one question. In the second half, do you expect promotional level to be in line or elevated versus last year? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you so much.\nMark Webb: Yeah, it's a good question. I mean, the landscape from here forward somewhat changes from the landscape through the first half because now we're in sort of the tariff part of the year. Our expectation is, as we mentioned previously, our unit receipts in the back half are bought down closer to the mid-single digits. The sort of supply side is adjusted. The expectation would be that our strategic pricing actions, as well as tighter promotions, help to offset some level of those tariffs. We stand ready.\nIn all honesty, the guidance range that we provided for Q3 assumes a range of outcomes with specific respect to the receptivity of the customer to those pricing actions that we're taking, knowing that we're not the only ones. That level of macro uncertainty is what's sort of coloring the range of guidance, the low end being low receptivity to our pricing increases and the high end being a more receptive customer to the price increases.\nJonna Kim: Got it. Thank you.\nMark Webb: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from a line of Corey Tarlowe from Jefferies. Your line is open.\nCorey Tarlowe: Great. Thanks. Good morning. Mary Ellen, could you maybe talk a little bit about kind of 100 days into the business at this point, where you see opportunity for change, where you see opportunity to accelerate innovation, what's working in the business, and then maybe other areas or trends you've seen quarter to date that you might want to shed some light on? Thanks so much.\nMary Coyne: Good morning, Corey. Yes, super excited after 100 days and having had a moment to assess the business. I'm very pleased to report that we are already seeing cultural shifts within the organization, ship-from-store being the most recent example where the team's work together, greater sense of urgency and purpose, and delivered results well ahead of schedule. We are excited to see that in terms of the momentum and the team efforts here. As we look forward, our focus is on growing the customer file. That is truly what our goal is. There are three immediate areas of focus that we know we need to do that.\nIt's the product, it's the customer journey, and it's the way we work that I just referenced. Changes and innovation that we're working on right away are around marketing mix and attracting more customers. We know that we have an incredible demographic. She holds the largest wealth in this country. It's a growing segment. She's incredibly loyal to the brand she loves, and she wants to look more stylish today than ever. We are very excited that we have a base of a loyal customer, and the opportunity ahead of us immediately is to really think about the marketing mix that will add to that customer file.\nIn terms of what's working right now, we are in the back half of this year making slight refinements to our presentations, both in-store and online, and to our assets that will be shared, both catalog and digital. The focus really is on 2026 and how we drive compelling assortments to attract this customer.\nCorey Tarlowe: Great, thanks so much. Mark, could you maybe walk us through some of the puts and takes in margin? Obviously, tariffs was one that was already addressed and talked about, but are there any other considerations in the back half of this year? How do you see the path to kind of the high teens EBITDA margin continuing and sustaining over the long term? What do you think the key drivers are to get you there?\nMark Webb: Yeah, Corey, good questions. Look, I think in the back half of the year, the primary margin story comes down to tariffs. Part of that is the strategy that we're deploying on the strategic pricing and selective pricing. The goal really is to offset the dollar amount of the tariffs versus trying to mark it up and maintain the rate. That carries with it, out of the gates, full receptivity to the pricing increases margin pressure. As I mentioned, we're providing the closer-in outlook for Q3 that has a range of expectations around that receptivity. That's the primary.\nUnderneath the covers, there are some opportunities to offset that through the level of promotions executed in the business, the fact that the inventories are bought, as I mentioned, down in the back half of the year, which we feel is a prudent way to position the inventories.\nThat is enabling us to continue to manage the business with the discipline of the operating model on display, still cash-generative, and allowing us to make these investments, which to your last question is really the path for us going forward to invest, as Mary Ellen said, in expanding the customer file, the breadth of the assortment, the appeal of the assortment, and the marketing mix is really the opportunity to drive profitable growth deliberately in the coming year, which will be the kind of the go-forward story to drive that performance back into the business.\nIn the meantime, we continue those investments and continue to generate the cash and distribute the cash in support of our TSR strategies, as evidenced by the dividend and the share repurchase activity to date.\nCorey Tarlowe: Great, thanks so much, and best of luck.\nMark Webb: Thanks.\nJonna Kim: Thank you.\nOperator: Again, if you'd like to ask a question, press star one on your telephone keypad. Your next question comes from the line of Janine Stichter from BTIG. Your line is open.\nJanine Stichter: Hi. Good morning. Mary Ellen, I just wanted to get your thoughts on the state of your consumer. I know your consumer tends to be pretty headline sensitive, and they weren't feeling great at the start of Q2. Outside of some of the noise you saw from promotions in Q2 that did drive sequential improvement, how is she feeling today?\nMary Coyne: Good morning, Janine. Thanks for the question. What we're seeing is the consumer slowly return. We saw that, again, sequentially month over month in Q2, and we're optimistic as we're heading into Q3. I believe as the tariff noise has settled, we have seen our comeback into the business, which is very exciting for us.\nJanine Stichter: Great. I just wanted to clarify around the back half promotional levels. Inventory is clean, but obviously, your consumer still is selective and price sensitive. Would you expect promotions to be up year over year in the back half, down, or is that still part of the range of outcomes you're contemplating?\nMary Coyne: As Mark said earlier, that will really depend on the consumer acceptance with our brand as well as our peers of the price increases. The range that we've put out there, sort of the high end is she's very accepting because we were strategic and thoughtful about where we increased prices. On the low end is that she is more resistant to the overall cost of purchases moving forward.\nJanine Stichter: Great, thanks so much, and best of luck.\nMary Coyne: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Marni Shapiro from The Retail Tracker. Your line is open.\nMarni Shapiro: Hey, guys. Nice improvements here, at least in getting some traffic back in the stores. I'm curious if you could talk a little bit. You upgraded your POS systems. Will you, I guess, upgrade, modernize, change anything with inspired rewards? I think you have a pretty loyal customer, as far as I recall. Will you use that to sort of expand your base of customer? I just have one follow-up on that, if you wouldn't mind.\nMary Coyne: Sure. Marni, yes, we are very happy to have POS and Order Management System (OMS) implementations behind us. The team is currently working on drafting a reward program that is non-tender because, as you know, right now, the GACC, our own credit card program, is highly penetrated to our sales and a very loyal audience. We do have many programs for them. As I said, the team is working on one that's non-tender and one that we will have rolled out in the back half of the year.\nMarni Shapiro: Fantastic. You said you were going to launch, you launched some TV or you were testing some television. I'm curious what your thoughts are on social media content in real-life events. I feel like your customers, when I'm in your stores, they're all talking to each other. I'm curious what you think about those two aspects to grab people into your stores.\nMary Coyne: Great question. We are very clear that we need to get our message out to more people to drive awareness, all levels of the funnel. We would say particularly really looking at top and middle, as we've been converting very well on the bottom to grow the customer file. The television test was very small, and it was very local. It is super exciting for us because it did have a tremendous impact. As we look forward to changing the marketing mix, we will absolutely be looking to what you were talking, you know, more digital, more direct interaction. That mix going forward will be very different.\nHonestly, we'll be testing strategically in the back half of the year to really understand how we can free up some resources to really engage these new to brands and react, as opposed to focusing only on our existing file.\nMarni Shapiro: Fantastic. Can I sneak in just one more? I don't know if I'm projecting onto your stores, but in the last, I think, two weeks, even last week and a half, the stores already look different. They look cleaner. The front of the store looks different. I don't want to say younger, maybe more modern, the way things are paired. Am I projecting onto it, or have you already made changes in the merchandising without changing the product?\nMary Coyne: Marni, I love this question. Yes, for the back half of the year, as we have said, because the product was already locked in, what we have done is change the presentation. Both in stores and online, and to your point, making it much easier for the customer to shop, cleaner color stories. Honestly, we've rethought what we're doing in windows to make them more compelling. Yes, we are seeing a positive response so far. Very glad to hear that people are noticing. Thank you.\nMarni Shapiro: Fantastic. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: That concludes our question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Mary Ellen Coyne for some final closing remarks.\nMary Coyne: Thank you all for joining us today. We are focused and committed to executing on our objectives, and we look forward to speaking with you again on our next earnings call.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."
