  "description": "Featuring one-of-a-kind jewelry from independent designers plus bejeweled objects and fine art, the Argyle & Valentine gallery opens September 3 in Venice, CA.",
  "content": "Flowering with fine art, handmade jewelry, luxury clothing, exclusive home accessories and nature-based fragrances, Argyle & Valentine is jewelry designer Kathy Rose\u2019s newest boutique/gallery that\u2019s opening September 3, 2025 in Venice, CA. at 1415 Abbot Kinney Blvd. This treasure house of a gallery is Los Angeles\u2019s only luxury emporium to embody ideals of the Arts and Crafts movement that shaped European and USA culture from the 1890s through the 1930s. During that era, proliferation of machine-made; mass-produced goods inspired designers, artists, fine artisans and architects to improve standards of design, decoration and handcraft in everything from handmade jewelry to leather goods to houses and home furnishings. Arts and Crafts adherents believed that standards of applied art, fine art and quality of human life were degraded by aesthetically and technically inferior mass-produced items. Were they to teleport into 2025, Arts and Crafts artisans would doubtless feel at home. The gallery abounds in jewels and other functional objects, plus fine art that embodies Nature-inspired forms, natural materials and exquisite artisanship that are reminiscent of Arts and Crafts ideals and creations.\n\nAppropriately enough, Argyle & Valentine is housed inside an historic redwood Craftsman-era bungalow. Located next door to Gjelina, a restaurant specializing in locally sourced, sustainably grown produce and other earth-friendly foods, Argyle & Valentine, Rose explained, \u201cIs where I offer jewels, fine art and other goods chosen for their original designs and rarity, fine artisanship and creative use of precious natural materials.\u201d In her quest for artisanal excellence, Rose is continuing work started by her parents, Pari and Albert Azarmi, who operated a Santa Barbara, CA. art gallery for many years. That space carried Pari Azarmi\u2019s oil paintings, hand-knotted Persian rugs, hand-painted vintage and antique imported tiles from Isfahan, Iran, along with one-of-a-kind furniture and sculptures.\n\nSpecializing in one-of-a-kind and limited-edition jewels, Argyle & Valentine features independent designers and makers from around the world. \u201cI do my utmost to highlight the unique visions and talents of jewelry artists,\u201d Rose observed. \u201cThe gallery serves the universal human need to experience and feel art and jewelry, whether it adorns the home and office or lives on the body to soothe the soul.\u201d For example, Rose\u2019s eponymous collection of jewels includes 18-karat gold and diamond rings inspired by the soaring grace and strength of eagles, graceful serpent cuffs and natural diamond jewelry. While Georgina Yvonne\u2019s hand-carved, 18-karat gold lockets embody precise handiwork and interior storage space for tiny precious objects, Cultus Artem high luxury jewels designed by Holly Tupper are set with important colored gemstones and diamonds. Works on offer from other renowned female jewelers include Jess Maharry, Ourobouros, Clio Saskia, Jaine K and Mariella Pilato.\n\nSome of Argyle & Valentine\u2019s luxury jewelry designers and goldsmiths are longstanding allies: Both K. Brunini and Karma El Khalil have been with Rose since 2000. \u201cKarma El Khalil and K. Brunini make jewels that are highly collectible,\u201d Rose observed. \u201cI always carry Karma\u2019s classic pieces in addition to her latest designs.\u201d Although Rose is too discreet to trumpet her A-list celebrity following, Rose has for several years been designing and or supplying jewels for singer-songwriters like Madonna, Rihanna and Alanis Morrisette. As Morrisette said, \u201cKathy has been a sister, a mentor, an inspiration and a shaman compatriot for many years and I feel blessed to know her and to be able to be anywhere near her orbit.\u201d Madonna\u2019s stylist Rita Melssen said, \u201cArgyle and Valentine is my go-to for one-of-a-kind jewelry and metaphysical pieces that are beautiful yet also feel like a form of protection for the wearer. Kathy creates such a sacred space for these precious pieces to exist as art,\u201d she continued, \u201cand her talent for finding gorgeous, protective pieces is unmatched.\u201d\n\nRihanna\u2019s Creative Director and stylist Jahleel Weaver enthused, \u201cKathy has always had an eye for pieces that are sculptural and rare. Every time we\u2019ve worked together, I find pieces that stand apart. Argyle & Valentine is the perfect evolution of her vision: refined, soulful, and deeply curated.\" While the actor Marisa Tomei noted, \u201cIn Argyle & Valentine, I love what Kathy has created\u2026a sacred special place, another luminary for whom Rose designs is Kristian Nairn, a lead actor in the fantasy television series, \u201cGame of Thrones.\u201d As Nairn explained, \u201cThere's so much more to the jewelry pieces that Kathy curates and creates [than adornment]. They are talismans, pieces of art with stories behind them.\u201d he said. \u201cHer space is an oasis of calm and creativity.\u201d One of the many ways that Rose fosters serenity is through ceremoniously serving a special cacao and edible gold leaf drink in golden dragon cups to gallery visitors. (Ayurvedic practitioner Katie Grossman of The Keie custom blends the restorative cacao-gold and herbal treat.)\n\nThe Native American jeweler Stormie, whose new collection of beaded hatbands and labradorite, ruby and sapphire jewels is exclusive to Argyle & Valentine, is another jeweler who Rose has grown with over decades. Delhi-based designer Hanut Singh, who has been with Rose for 12 years, creates jewels that pulse with colored gemstones, diamonds, kinetic grace and a soulful, timeless style. Singh reaffirmed his and Rose\u2019s shared aesthetic. \u201cKathy Rose\u2019s curation of Argyle & Valentine gallery communicates magic and wonder, craft and celebration,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHer space contains an enveloping sense of Nature, mysticism and vibrancy that\u2019s heady\u2026\u201d\n\nAlong with high luxury, design-driven jewelry, Argyle & Valentine showcases fine art and handmade highly textured applied art objects, beginning with the hand-stitched leather door handles that are like jewelry for doors. These and leather-stitched journals are the work of Chris Kelly of Topanga Creek Outpost; they echo the sublime hand-sewn leather goods and home furnishings produced during the golden age of the Arts and Crafts movement. While Laura Ball\u2019s watercolors of spider webs and forests glow with crumbled colored gemstone pigments, Lara Porzak\u2019s tintypes portray the life force of horses and the fragile beauty of butterflies. A Manny Sayes mural of gold bears and hawks portrays the two prototypically California creatures in motionless perfection and Charlie Walker\u2019s five-foot by five-foot mica, pumice and gold leaf triptych paintings of the Colorado mountains are majestic. Robbie Conal\u2019s acrylic and glitter surfing skeleton painting reminds us to live in the here and now, and in a more upbeat vein, Rafael Perez\u2019s oil paintings of gemstones and doughnuts communicate delicious sensuality.\n\nIza Leigh\u2019s detailed cosmic drawings, Alison Van Pelt\u2019s equine paintings plus art works by Jessylyn Gislig, Mary Ellen Loc, Ryder Skolfield, Sye Williams and Kuger Peterson infuse artistic gravitas into Argyle & Valentine\u2019s environment. Bracelets from Danielle and Gemma Levy of Moio project add texture, color and festivity to the mix. While sculptural lamps by Maria Loram illuminate the gallery, Pierre Khoury\u2019s and Anthony Quinn\u2019s bronze sculptures burnish the scene and Natalia Fedner\u2019s crocheted 14-karat gold and steel dresses and candelabra-style lamps further brighten the space. A capsule collection of meticulously hand-beaded, Japanese-inspired clutch purses by Dagmar Zaragoza are exclusive to Argyle & Valentine. Like so many other pieces here, the artistic skill and labor-intensive handiwork embodied in Zaragoza\u2019s purses reaffirm a handmade and precious tradition of artisanal excellence.\n\n\u201cAlong with varied fine art and exclusive gowns from Emil Gampe, One Moon Cashmere wraps and silk maxi dresses from SunChild,\u201d Rose related, \u201cArgyle & Valentine also offers objets d\u2019art like House of Ravn\u2019s hand-carved sterling silver chess set.\u201d As Rose observed. \u201cGemologist Mike Kroeger and jeweler Angela Kroeger, the makers behind House of Ravn, also design and hand-fabricate high luxury jewels that are showcased here in the gallery.\u201d While Mike Kroeger selects unusual colored gemstones and diamonds of superb quality, Angela\u2019s masterful carving skills create incomparably beautiful and precise designs.\n\nSingh\u2019s on target in every respect, as Argyle & Valentine abounds with artfully fragranced, essential oil candles plus naturally derived skin care products. For starters, there\u2019s the gallery\u2019s eponymous crushed gemstone candle collection, which includes an essential rose oil and crushed rose quartz crystal candle that smells exceptionally uplifting. The skin care range from Shiva Rose is made with Ayurvedic herbs, flowers, fruits and organic oils that reduce inflammation and replenish skin. (Shiva Rose products contain essential oils and formulae that Ayurvedic practitioners believe can exert mood-elevating effects and perhaps even open the energy centers of the body.)\n\nSince antiquity, the realm of luxury goods has forever owed its existence to artisans whose skills are developed through years of apprenticeship to a master who trains them to design and make handmade goods of enduring beauty and superior quality. Argyle & Valentine continues this tradition while expressing Kathy Rose\u2019s aesthetic ideals. (The Argyle & Valentine website, it should be noted, panoramically presents the gallery\u2019s eclectic offerings.) \u201cI feel fortunate and inspired to work with the artists and artisans who co-create Argyle & Valentine,\u201d Rose said. \u201cThey cultivate a vision and express it masterfully, whether in fine art, jewelry, or other objects that make life worth living.\u201d",

I'd done it when I was 14 and didn't think I'd have to do it again.

      "text": "warrior tradition & perspective\nI created 'the keie' out of deep respect and reverence for the powerful warrior traditions, teachings, and lineage of wisdom holders, that have preserved these practices for thousands of years. I strive to honorably and mindfully share this ancient tradition of self-care with the world, to support the warrior that lives within each and every one of us.\nOur nervous system contains the wisdom of our life experiences. When the nervous system is strong and healthy, it is adaptable and we can digest food, emotions, information, and experiences easily. When the nervous system is overloaded, stressed, and compromised, we become overly vulnerable to our environment, and can experience chronic stress and major disruptions in our health. Ancient Warriors knew that possessing the sharpest reflexes and having a keen ability to process and digest emotions and experiences, was vital to survival. Conditioning the nervous system to promote alertness and improve the capacity to take on pressure prior to battle was just as important as pulling stress out of the nervous system post battle.\nAncient Warriors were masterful at self care because they had to be. Their core mission and function in society was to provide protection from threats to peace. Their brains, bellies, and bodies, needed to work flawlessly in order to fulfill their task. They were also the most at risk of enduring injury and trauma to their brains, bellies, and bodies due to battle. The practices and philosophies that are offered here are rooted in the traditions that the ancient warriors of India relied on for protection, balance, and strength.\nmeet katie\nI combine the wisdom of my experience with the knowledge of the healing systems that I study to offer holistic support with a focus on embodiment. As a student of life I value the ongoing process of learning, evolving, and growing and I am always exploring new and creative ways to share what I learn with others.\nI have been working in the wellness space since 2011. I grew up navigating my own chronic health challenges from an early age which led me on an unconventional path exploring holistic and integrative healing.\nAlong my self-healing journey I obtained my bachelors degree in Social Work and became a certified yoga instructor, reiki master, and energy medicine practitioner. Then through a 7.5 year apprenticeship I became a warrior Ayurveda and Marma specialist. I am also a singer/songwriter with a passion for using music as medicine.\neducation & training\nSince 2010, I have worked, studied, practiced and apprenticed in the healing arts. I received extensive (10,000+ hrs) field practice and training in a tribal warrior tradition of Ayurveda (ancient science of metabolism), Marma Chikitsa (acupressure), and pranic healing in America and India. I have conducted workshops, lectures, mentorships, and supported private clients, in NY, Los Angeles, Northern California, Oregon and internationally.\n-\nBachelors degree in Social Work, University of Vermont\n-\nHealing Touch (Energy Medicine) Level 1& 2, Vermont\n-\nYoga 200 RYT, Vermont\n-\nLevel 1, 2, and 3 of Usui Reiki, NY"
