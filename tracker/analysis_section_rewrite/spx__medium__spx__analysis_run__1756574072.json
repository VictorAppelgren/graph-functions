      "feedback": "The draft stays on Netflix and its 3–6‑month valuation path, but a few statements drift from evidence‑based, cited claims and introduce generic modeling language. Remove or re‑write the sentence about a “2–3 bp lift in the implied discount rate” unless you can cite a source for the Fed’s effect on term premium (or replace it with a clear, model‑based assumption). Add a citation for the 40–45× P/E compression range or replace it with a more conservative, sourced estimate (e.g., reference typical P/E compression in maturing streaming firms). Include a concise alternative scenario (e.g., Fed holds rates, ad‑tier underperforms) and quantify the upside/downside (e.g., –10 % vs +10 %). Explicitly reference the canonical handle NFLX and, where relevant, link to spx/ndx to satisfy the handle‑mapping rule. Ensure every quantitative claim (13.1% CAGR, 51.7× P/E, 15.9% revenue lift, 86.9% FCF jump) carries a citation (A88B7V8PY or FAN5RYW6T). Trim generic phrasing (“potentially eroding the premium”) and keep the focus strictly on Netflix’s valuation trajectory, with clear catalysts, risks, watch signals, and confidence levels.",
