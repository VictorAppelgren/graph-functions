  "content": "NORMAL, Ill., Sept. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- McBeath Financial Group, a Registered Investment Advisory firm focused on delivering comprehensive financial planning, investment management, and tax strategies for the Bloomington-Normal area, is proud to announce the addition of two new Financial Planning Assistants, Ian Cavallo and Nathan Sandon. The expansion reflects the firm's continued growth and commitment to delivering personalized financial planning, investment management, and tax strategy services for high-net-worth individuals.\n\nWith a growing client base and an increasingly sophisticated planning process, the firm set out to expand its team by adding new roles to support the financial planning work that happens behind the scenes.\n\n\"As our client base continues to grow and our dedication to delivering individualized service deepens, we recognized the need for additional support to ensure every client continues to receive the highest level of care,\" said Julie Karstens, CFP\u00ae, Director of Financial Planning. \"During the interview process, two candidates stood out. It became clear that each of them could strengthen our planning support today, with the hope of growing into a valuable, long-term role with our team. We made the decision to bring both on board and immerse them in our training program so we can continue to provide the very best service to our clients.\"\n\nThe Financial Planning Assistant role was created to support advisors with meeting preparation, team coordination, and financial planning software navigation. It offers a unique opportunity to learn and grow as part of a fast-paced, dynamic team, while supporting the financial advisors responsible for oversight of the client relationship.\n\nIan Cavallo, a 2022 Finance graduate from Illinois State University with a minor in Economics, brings over four years of experience in commodities trading and broker support at a local trading firm. His background includes client service, position management, and financial operations. He holds the FINRA Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) certification and is known for his precision, collaboration, and strong grasp of financial systems.\n\nNathan Sandon, a recent graduate of Illinois State University with a B.S. in Finance and a minor in Financial Planning, adds academic training through CFP\u00ae-accredited coursework along with hands-on experience in banking, student financial mentorship, and financial education. He is eMoney certified, giving him direct experience with advanced financial planning software widely used in the industry to build and manage detailed client plans.",
