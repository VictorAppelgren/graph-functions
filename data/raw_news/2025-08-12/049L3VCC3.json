  "title": "Family sues for wrongful death in deadly listeria outbreak",
  "description": "The family members of the victim said they were never told their loved one died due to the outbreak, their lawyer, Bill Marler, said.",
  "content": "A California family is suing for wrongful death in the wake of a listeria outbreak caused by nutrition shakes that led to the deaths of 14 people this year, including their relative.\n\nIn February, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced an investigation into an outbreak linked to Lyons ReadyCare and Sysco Imperial brand frozen supplemental shakes. At the time, Lyon Magnus LLC, the parent company, recalled 17 affected products. The contaminated shakes, distributed to long-term care facilities and hospitals, were produced by a Prairie Farms Dairy Inc. facility in Fort Wayne, Indiana.\n\nThe FDA and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) declared the outbreak over on May 16. The agency reported 42 cases of listeriosis, or listeria poisoning, across 21 states, resulting in 41 hospitalizations and 14 deaths.\n\nThe illnesses and deaths, which overwhelmingly (90%) occurred in people in care facilities or those who had been hospitalized before they became infected, were confirmed through whole genome sequencing as being caused by the outbreak strain associated with the shakes.\n\nThe CDC began monitoring the outbreak of the disease as early as 2018, food safety lawyer Bill Marler told USA TODAY. At the beginning, epidemiologists were unable to identify the source of the illnesses.\n\nNow, with the outbreak technically over, some families are just beginning to find out their loved ones were victims, Marler said.\n\nMarler of the Marler Clark law firm said he's filed the first lawsuit related to the outbreak on Thursday, Aug. 7. It says the outbreak spanned multiple years and was likely the result of conditions within one of the manufacturing and packaging facilities. Marler said that the family who sued was not informed until July that their relative's death was caused by the outbreak.\n\nThe wife and children of John Wills Sr. of Richmond, California, sued Lyon, the distributor of the shakes, and Prairie Farms Dairy Inc., the manufacturer. Their suit said Wills was recovering from a slip-and-fall injury in a local care facility when, on July 20, 2024, he was given a contaminated shake. Wills, who was previously able to move with the assistance of a mobility device, to participate in physical therapy and eat meals normally, soon developed a fever, pain and had difficulty speaking, according to the suit.\n\nAfter multiple hospitalizations and monitoring for infectious disease, Wills died of \"complications related to his Listeria infection and other comorbid conditions\" on Feb. 22, 2025. His relatives are seeking damages and payment of Wills' medical and legal fees.\n\nMarler criticized the CDC and FDA for their reporting practices, telling USA TODAY and explaining in a blog post that victims like Wills underwent various tests \u2013 including blood and spinal fluid draws \u2013 and underwent investigations that involved family interviews and reviews of purchase histories. However, they were never informed by the agencies about the cause of their illness or death.\n\n\"I spoke with a family today to inform them that their husband/father died after suffering a Listeria infection,\" Marler said in a recent blog post shared with USA TODAY, which he confirmed was referencing Wills. \"Until today, the family did not know the cause of his infection despite (the) fact that it has been known by local, state and federal officials for over a year.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the CDC and FDA for comment.\n\nA total of 21 states had known listeria outbreaks related to this recall: Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and West Virginia.\n\nThe 14 deaths occurred in nine states: California, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, New York, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington.\n\nWhich Lyons ReadyCare and Sysco Imperial shakes were recalled?\n\nAll recalled products had \"best buy\" dates between 02/21/25 and 02/21/26, according to Lyons Magnus. All the contaminated products are believed to have been destroyed, the FDA notice said.\n\nWhat is listeriosis or listeria poisoning?\n\nListeriosis, or listeria poisoning, is a foodborne bacterial infection most commonly caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes. It is considered a serious condition and can be dangerous or life-threatening, especially to older adults, people with weak immune systems and pregnant people.\n\nSigns and symptoms of listeriosis may not appear until weeks after consumption. Persons in the higher-risk categories who experience flu-like symptoms within two months after eating contaminated food should seek medical care and tell their health care provider about eating the contaminated food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nAccording to the USDA, symptoms include:",

Three of the environmental swabs collected from the processing area tested positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Whole Genome Sequencing analysis determined that the Listeria detected in these samples is closely related to the strain of Listeria that is causing illnesses in this outbreak.\nFDA\u2019s investigation is ongoing, and more information will be provided as it becomes available.\nFebruary 21, 2025\nThe FDA and CDC, in collaboration with state and local partners, are investigating illnesses in a multistate outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes infections linked to Lyons ReadyCare and Sysco Imperial Frozen Supplemental Shakes.\nOn November 25, 2024, FDA was notified about an outbreak of Listeria monocytogenes in the United States, with many ill people residing in long-term care facilities (LTCF) prior to illness onset. FDA\u2019s traceback investigation identified that each of the LTCF who supplied invoice information for review from 2024 to present received a frozen supplemental shake of either Lyons ReadyCare or Sysco Imperial brand. As part of this investigation, FDA collected environmental samples and found the outbreak strain of Listeria.\nAccording to CDC, this outbreak includes cases dating back to 2018, with 20 cases across 2024 and 2025, and is currently ongoing. Epidemiologic evidence in previous investigations were unable to identify a source of the outbreak. As of February 21, 2025, a total of 38 people infected with the outbreak strain of Listeria monocytogenes have been reported from 21 states. Of the 38 people for whom information is available, 37 people have been hospitalized. Eleven deaths have been reported.

The company warns that \"people with a nut allergy or severe sensitivity to hazelnuts run the risk of serious or life-threatening allergic reactions\" if they consume the bread.\nHartford Bakery said it had removed all products linked to the six affected production lots.

The outbreak has left four people hospitalized, but no deaths have been reported.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clarified that there have been no illnesses reported in connection with this specific batch, but CDC officials are urging everyone not to eat, serve or sell the recalled items.\nThe risk of salmonella contamination was discovered during routine FDA testing. The Chetak LLC Group has completely suspended production of the frozen sprouted beans until an investigation can determine the source of the problem, according to the FDA.\nWhich sprouted beans were recalled?\nThe following frozen sprouted bean packets with the specified lot codes have been recalled:\n- Deep Sprouted Mat (Moth) 16-ounceLot codes: 24330, 25072, 25108, 24353, 25171, 24297, 25058, 25078, 24291, 25107, 24354 and 24292\n- Deep Sprouted Moong 16-ounceLot codes: 24330, 25072, 25108, 24353, 25171, 24297, 25058, 25078, 24291, 25107, 24354 and 24292\nThe lot codes could be found printed on the back side of the bag.\nWhat to do with recalled beans?\nThe CDA is urging anyone with the recalled products to either throw them away or return them and ask for a refund.\nAdditionally, product holders should wash any items and surfaces the recalled products may have touched with hot soapy water or a dishwasher.\nAnyone who experiences severe salmonella infection symptoms should contact a healthcare provider immediately.\nWhat are salmonella infection symptoms?\nSalmonella is a bacterium that can cause severe and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail and elderly people, as well as those with a weakened immune system.\nSymptoms in healthy individuals include fever, diarrhea (occasionally bloody), nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain, according to the FDA.\nIn rare circumstances where Salmonella enters the bloodstream, infection can cause more serious conditions such as arterial infections (i.e., infected aneurysms), endocarditis and arthritis, the federal agency said."

Lyons ReadyCare and Sysco Imperial Frozen Supplemental Shakes due to the potential for the products to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes. Lyons Magnus is taking this action in response to a recall of the products by their manufacturer, Prairie Farms Dairy, Inc. (\"Prairie Farms\") from the Prairie Farms facility in Fort Wayne, Indiana.\nListeria monocytogenes is an organism which can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems. Although healthy individuals may suffer only short-term symptoms such as high fever, severe headache, stiffness, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, Listeria infection can cause miscarriages and stillbirths among pregnant women.\nLyons Magnus handled distribution of the recalled products, which were manufactured and supplied to Lyons Magnus by Prairie Farms. The recalled products were distributed primarily to long-term care facilities and were not available for retail sale. As soon as Lyons Magnus learned of the issue, it took immediate action to halt the purchase of all products from the affected Prairie Farms facility, notify customers, and ensure that impacted products were removed from distribution nationally. Lyons Magnus' utmost concern is protecting consumers.\nThe recalled products were distributed throughout the United States and packed in 4 oz. cartons under the Lyons ReadyCare and Sysco Imperial brand names. The top of the carton has printing that identifies the Lot Code and Best By Date for these products. A chart listing all recalled products is provided below.\nThe recall is being conducted in cooperation with Prairie Farms, Sysco, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. According to a statement from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, there have been 38 illnesses associated with the strain of Listeria monocytogenes that may have contaminated these products, including 11 deaths.\nAnyone who has a recalled product in his or her possession should quarantine the recalled products.
