I've been in and out of traditional therapy my whole life,\" Jurlando said, \"and sometimes I felt like I just didn't want to talk. I just wanted to do something that was calming, or, you know, talk about things in the lens of surfing.\"\n\nJurlando says surf therapy can help people who struggle with anxiety and depression, PTSD, women who've experienced sexual trauma, and even children who've experienced loss. Sessions include a land component that encompasses art, discussions and a yoga-like warmup before hitting the waves.\n\n\"Even getting to the beach sometimes can be a challenge for people dealing with certain mental health issues,\" surf therapy facilitator Ashley Fallon said. \"We talk about challenging yourself when you're in this program, as you're comfortable, and that's what these programs can be as a way to kind of move past any blocks that you might be having.\"\n\nFor Sharon Lew, Mick Arieta, and Narisara Vanichanan, one recent session was a day of warm sand, soft rolling waves, restorative movement and supportive affirmations.\n\n\"I really had this, like, mental, like, clarity that I hadn't had in a very long time,\" Lew said.\n\n\"I struggle with depression. I don't always get a chance to get out the door, right? I feel like it's in a safe space in a community that's not judgmental,\" Arieta said.\n\n\"It just kind of helps wash away, you know, some of the all these other emotions,\" Vanichanan added.\n\u2022 Read more: Mental health resources in the social media age - A Breaking the Stigma special\n\n\"It's just like a switch that turns on\"\n\nTherapists say surf therapy should not be a first line treatment for mental health issues, but add research supports that being in and around water does provide positive changes in social connectedness and depressive symptoms.\n\n\"At the end of the session, I feel like just more calm. It's just like a switch that turns on,\" Arieta said.\n\n\"It sounds corny, but feel one with it. There is just a sense of peace that happens,\" Lew said.\n\n\"It stays with you, for me, the rest of the day, you know? Into my relationships, into my work. I think it's part of healthy self care, which, you know, doesn't get talked about enough,\" Vanichanan added.\n\nThere are mental health practitioners, surf therapy facilitators and safety volunteers at all sessions. Ride the Tide has locations in Rockaway and Asbury Park, New Jersey, and a sliding scale of fees ranging from pay-what-you-can to $75 for a private, two-hour session.",

You are the entire ocean in a drop.\"\n- Rumi\nWhat exactly is surf therapy?\nThe International Surf Therapy Organization defines surf therapy as \"the use of surfing as a vehicle for delivering intentional, inclusive, population-specific, and evidenced-based therapeutic structures to promote psychological, physical, and psychosocial well-being.\"\nMore holistically, surf therapy can be defined as anything that uses somatic, trauma-informed, eco, play, and community therapy models to best support the holistic healing of communities. You don't need to surf to explore the benefits of a surf therapy program!\nOur Offerings\nSURF THERAPY SESSIONS\nSurf Therapy sessions are facilitated group or individual sessions with a focus on grounding yourself in nature, and coming back to oneself in the present.

      "text": "Mental health resources in the social media age - A Breaking the Stigma special\nNEW YORK - Evidence is emerging about the detrimental effects of social media, particularly for young people, from overuse, and harmful and addictive messaging.\nThere are currently strong pushes for regulation, especially as it pertains to kids. For example, in New York City, Mayor Eric Adams and Chancellor David Banks are pursuing a cell phone ban in schools.\nGovernor Kathy Hochul recently signed the SAFE For Kids Act (Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation) to combat addictive social media feeds.\nThe U.S. Surgeon General has called for warning labels on social media, and finally, the Senate overwhelmingly passed a kids online safety bill that has been sent to the House for approval.\n\"We have seen the damage being on social media does to people of all age groups,\" tech expert and Digimentors CEO Sree Sreenivasan said. \"It's affecting our ability to see beyond what's on the screen, to see what is meaningful in life.\"\n\"Every age group, whether it's preteen or teen, who use social media, more are reporting more symptoms of anxiety, depression, and worrying as a whole,\" New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Ashwin Vasan said.\n\"It can be something that can improve life, obviously... but it can also be something like everything else, where if used too much... it can make mental health worse,\" said Dr. Justin Kei, psychiatrist and director of outpatient mental health at Hackensack Medical Center.\n\"There is no world in which we're gonna get rid of social media. It's a part of our reality. It's about incorporating it into our lives in safer ways,\" Vasan said.\nWatch our full special in the video player above, and check out these links for additional resources:\n- Kids Online Safety Act\n- Hochul Online Safety Legislation\n- Internet safety and cyberbullying\n- Tools for keeping kids safe online\n- Resources for students, parents and educators\n- Youth mental health and social media usage\n- Mothers Against Media Addiction\n- New York City Charter School of the Arts\n- Independence High School\n- Senior Planet\n- NYC Gaymers\n- Quad Gods\n- Entertainment Software Association"

      "text": "Resources to overcome addiction and substance dependence\nNearly 50 million over the age of 12 reportedly have substance use disorders, which can include addictions to alcohol or drugs. Other issues that affect millions - such as gambling, shopping, gaming, and porn - have also been classified as addictions and mental health disorders.\nAll of these can be personally devastating, and sometimes life threatening.\nAddiction can take many forms\nExperts say about 5% of the population has a compulsive shopping disorder, buut there is less research in this area of addiction than that of drugs and alcohol for example. What is clear however, is the financial and emotional implications are very real.\n\"I have ADHD. I've had it, you know, I take medication for this. So, so the dopamine thing is an issue there,\" one compulsive shopper told CBS News New York. \"It's kind of like, it, what, when you're on a roller coaster and you go really high, and then you come down, that feeling that you get when you're coming down. It's like, you just want to keep going with that feeling.\"\n\"People that are reaching for substances, or gambling, or shopping or sex, there's a seeking. They're seeking to fill some need,\" Rachel Wallace of Hackensack Meridian Health Carrier Clinic said. \"What people are encouraged to do is find their own concept of spirituality... when people get outside and they feel that that connection with nature. Meditation is another concept... breathwork, music, dance, poetry, journaling.\"\nFrom gambling to recovery\nAccording to the New York State Gaming Commission, nearly $58 billion in bets have been placed in the three years since New York legalized mobile sports wagering. They add that bankruptcies have sharply increased, as well as incidents involving domestic violence.\nRob Sackowitz says he owed hundreds of thousands of dollars and tells a harrowing tale of his compulsive gambling, the lies it fostered, the financial devastation to him and his family and how it nearly ended his life.\n\"More gamblers commit suicide than drug addicts and alcoholics combined, and that's because they're in their brain, the only way out of their problem... because they owe so much money, is continuing to gamble,\" Sackowitz said.\nFor a dozen years, Sackowitz says he's been free of drinking, drugs and gambling. In 2022 he and his wife opened their own clinic called Right Choice Recovery, in Dayton, N.J. which offers a variety of programs and therapies.\n\"I would wake up when bank transfers in the middle of the night, what I know would clear,\" former compulsive gambler Scott Desch said. \"It was controlling a lot of my thoughts, a lot of my time. It was hurting. It was hurting me, and then ultimately it hurts others.\"\n\"One of the one of the requirements of our of our program is that we engage in family therapy,\" adolescent therapist Allen Gabriel of Right Choice Recovery said. \"I always do is encourage parents to set aside what I call talk time every week with your child, and that is just you spending an hour or two with your child and a place away from home where you guys have a conversation and there's absolutely no judgment. It's just creating a safe a safe space for them to be able to talk and really allow you to kind of understand the world as they see it.\"\nGabriel says asking for help is a sign of strength.\nAlcohol and other substances\nNearly 30 million people struggle with alcohol use disorder, according to the National Institutes of Health. The effects of this disease are devasting and can impact nearly all aspects of a person's life - relationships, jobs, finances, and health, just for starters. As negative repercussions add up, the outcomes are often catastrophic. There are hundreds of treatment facilities in our area, but as we've come to understand from those who have lived through the throes of alcoholism and addiction, you have to be ready to receive help.\n\"If they don't see it as a problem, that it's one of the hardest things to, kind of, progress on what to do,\" addiction psychiatrist Dr. Tony Issac of Raritan Bay Medical Center said. \"They're saying, you know, but I don't drink at work, right? But if they're still kind of having the physical withdrawal, by definition, that means you have a physical dependency on the alcohol.\"\nIssac outlined some issues that can occur during the withdrawal process.\n\"With alcohol withdrawal tremors, it can progress to more severe alcohol withdrawal states, like alcohol withdrawal hallucinosis, where you start seeing things, hearing things, feeling things other people might not experience. It can progress to withdrawal seizures or delirium tremens, which are both medical emergencies,\" Issac said. \"Reach out for help, whether that's your primary care doctor, whether it's family or friends, whether it's like a local psychiatrist, really, anyone... you want to encourage that conversation to kind of really bolster yourself in order to address whatever has to be addressed.\"\nOvercoming addiction\nSubstance use disorder is recognized as a disease, and there is a range of effective treatment. There's inpatient rehabilitation, outpatient counseling, and a multitude of programs from 12 step, to cognitive and behavioral therapies, art, music, yoga - even spiritual healing. There are effective medications to block opioid cravings. There is also peer counseling, which provides an important connection and understanding, ultimately helping the user, and the counselor as well.\nDelvoris Bryant is a peer counselor working at Carrier Clinic in New Jersey. She says she's been clean and sober for 12 years\n\"I'm a member of the community, so I'm able to help quite a few people that just may not know which way to turn, how to go about it,\" she said.\nShe found her way into hard drugs and an even harder life.\n\"And I had nothing left, but my mother, and I was watching myself kill her day by day with my drug abuse,\" Bryant said. \"I could not live with that.\"\nNow she continues to navigate her drug-free life, helping herself while she helps others.\n\"Addiction devastates families like no other illness or disease does... the behavioral elements of addiction can be really difficult to understand. Why people would steal from a loved one, why people would drive under the influence with children in the car, why someone who's pregnant would continue to use substances,\" Wallace said. \"It's not a choice. Remember that their brain has been hijacked. They're in a significant progress state of addiction and without support and intervention.\"\nResources\n- Debtors Anonymous of Greater New York\n- Right Choice Recovery\n- Gamblers Anonymous\n- Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\n- Alcoholics Anonymous\n- Retreat and Recovery at Ramapo Valley\n- Carrier Clinic\n- Raritan Addiction Care\n- Mount Sinai Bridge Program\n- National Alliance on Mental Illness/New York City\n- 988 Lifeline"
