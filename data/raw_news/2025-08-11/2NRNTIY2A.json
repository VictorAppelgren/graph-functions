  "content": "Investors can approximate the average market return by buying an index fund. While individual stocks can be big winners, plenty more fail to generate satisfactory returns. For example, the TMC Life Sciences Berhad (KLSE:TMCLIFE) share price is down 34% in the last year. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 2.3%. Longer term shareholders haven't suffered as badly, since the stock is down a comparatively less painful 21% in three years. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 13% in the last 90 days.\n\nSince shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nWhile TMC Life Sciences Berhad made a small profit, in the last year, we think that the market is probably more focussed on the top line growth at the moment. Generally speaking, we'd consider a stock like this alongside loss-making companies, simply because the quantum of the profit is so low. It would be hard to believe in a more profitable future without growing revenues.\n\nIn just one year TMC Life Sciences Berhad saw its revenue fall by 8.6%. That's not what investors generally want to see. Shareholders have seen the share price drop 34% in that time. That seems pretty reasonable given the lack of both profits and revenue growth. It's hard to escape the conclusion that buyers must envision either growth down the track, cost cutting, or both.\n\nYou can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).\n\nBalance sheet strength is crucial. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, TMC Life Sciences Berhad's TSR for the last 1 year was -31%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nWhile the broader market lost about 2.3% in the twelve months, TMC Life Sciences Berhad shareholders did even worse, losing 31% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 3% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Even so, be aware that TMC Life Sciences Berhad is showing 2 warning signs in our investment analysis , and 1 of those can't be ignored...",
