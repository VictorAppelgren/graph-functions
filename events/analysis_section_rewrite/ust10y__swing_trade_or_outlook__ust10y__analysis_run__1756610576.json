      "feedback": "The draft conflates multiple assets (mortgage rates, spx, dxy, ust10y) and mixes up driver‑catalyst logic, violating the “single‑asset focus” rule. Remove all lines that reference spx, dxy, or ust10y unless they are explicitly linked to the mortgage‑rate outcome via a clear causal chain (e.g., Fed cuts → lower term premium → mortgage drop). Re‑structure the “Up/Down” list to contain only four lines that map directly to mortgage‑rate movements: 1) Up (higher rates) driven by a Fed rate hike or inflation spike; 2) Up (higher rates) driven by a Fed tightening stance; 3) Down (lower rates) driven by a Fed rate cut or CPI decline; 4) Down (lower rates) driven by a Fed cut coupled with a widening term premium. Each line must include a precise catalyst window (e.g., “Sept 25 FOMC” or “April CPI”) and a probability that is grounded in the cited IDs (e.g., 97MD1FHW8, U21K4ALYQ). The swing‑trade plan should focus on a tradable proxy for mortgage rates (e.g., 30‑yr fixed‑rate index or a mortgage‑related ETF) and specify entry, stop, target, R/R, and invalidation signals, all tied to the same catalyst windows. Ensure every claim has an inline (ID) citation; eliminate any generic statements or duplicated content. Finally, trim the plan to the required 4‑line “Up/Down” section and a single 1‑line swing‑trade/outlook line, preserving the concise, actionable format mandated by the guidelines.",
