      "text": "Topline\nAfter trading barbs online with former Russian leader Dmitri A. Medvedev, President Donald Trump has ordered nuclear submarines to be positioned in \u201cthe appropriate regions\u201d near Russia \u201cjust in case.\u201d\nKey Facts\nTrump on Friday announced the movement of the submarines on Truth Social after sparring online for several days with Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council, who he called a \u201cfailed former President of Russia.\u201d\nMedvedev on Monday accused Trump of \u201cplaying the ultimatum game\u201d after Trump said he was shortening a 50-day deadline he set for Russia to end its war in Ukraine or be hit with secondary tariffs.\nMedvedev said \"each new ultimatum is a threat and a step towards war,\u201d and Trump responded by telling Medvedev to \"watch his words,\" warning he was \"entering very dangerous territory.\"\nThe Russian official then, on Thursday, responded to Trump\u2019s \u201cthreats\u201d by saying he should remember \"how dangerous the fabled 'Dead Hand' can be,\" a reference to Soviet-era nuclear strike capabilities of last resort.\nIn response, Trump on Friday said he\u2019d ordered the movement of the submarines \u201cjust in case these foolish and inflammatory statements are more than just that. Words are very important, and can often lead to unintended consequences, I hope this will not be one of those instances.\u201d\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines.

Medvedev at the time said that Russia \u201cdidn\u2019t care\u201d about the threats. On Monday, Trump shortened that deadline, and said he would give Russia 10 to 12 days to end the war before imposing \u201csanctions and maybe tariffs, secondary tariffs,\u201d meaning he would impose tariffs on countries that trade with Russia. The U.S. and Russia \u201cdo almost no business together,\u201d per Trump. One day later, the president told reporters he wasn't sure such sanctions would make a difference or influence Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying \"I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to affect Russia, because he wants to, obviously, probably keep the war going. But we\u2019re going to put on tariffs and the various things you put on. It may or may not affect them. But it could.\u201d Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said Tuesday that the Kremlin \"took note\" of the new deadline, but Putin has otherwise shown no indication it will impact his moves in Ukraine.\nTangent\nIn his inauguration speech, Trump said he would be a \"peacemaker and a unifier\" and promised speedy ends to both the Israel-Hamas war and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but Trump\u2019s views on the latter have flip- flopped since he took office. He first suggested he would be able to end the conflict by appealing to Putin and striking a deal, and accused Ukraine of starting the war. He publicly clashed with President Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office in February, accusing Zelensky of \"gambling with World War III\" and not being grateful enough for the support of the United States. Since then, he has praised Ukraine for its courage and said he would assist in the fight against Russia. Trump has repeatedly threatened to punish Russia for its continued attacks in Ukraine but hasn\u2019t followed through. Several weeks ago, Trump said he would help Europe send more weapons to Ukraine and set the 50-day deadline."

      "text": "Topline\nLabor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer on Friday confirmed the firing of Biden-area appointee Erika McEntarfer, the commissioner of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, after a weak jobs report showed a steep drop off in positions added in July and eliminated hundreds of thousands of previously reported gains.\nKey Facts\nTrump ranted against McEntarfer in a Truth Social post and lodged accusations that she manipulated the jobs numbers during the 2024 election to benefit Democratic candidate Kamala Harris.\nThe president has long criticized the Bureau for its jobs data and revisions, specifically pointing to a revision made Friday that cut a combined 258,000 jobs from the counts of the two months prior, indicating a weaker market than previously thought.\nHe also called out two revisions made in 2024, one in March that revised numbers over the 12 months prior down more than 800,000, and one made just before the election that wiped out a combined 112,000 jobs across August and September of 2024.\nIt's not at all uncommon for the BLS to revise numbers as additional payroll data becomes available and initial estimates rarely tell the full story\u2014the Bureau's third and final revision is considered the most accurate.\nTrump said McEntarfer will be replaced with someone \"much more competent and qualified.\"\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines.

Jerome \u201cToo Late\u201d Powell is no better! But, the good news is, our Country is doing GREAT!\u201d\nKey Background\nFriday's jobs report showed that only 73,000 nonfarm jobs were added last month, well below economists' projections, and that the unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%. June and May totals were also revised sharply lower, dropping to 14,000 from 147,000 in June and to 19,000 from 125,000 for May. An average of 130,000 jobs added per month this year is the weakest since the January to June period in 2010, in the wake of the Great Recession. An average of 168,000 jobs were added per month last year. A report from earlier this week from the career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas blamed job losses on tariffs, implementation of artificial intelligence and cuts made within the federal government.\nWhat To Watch For\nIf the weak report pushes the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The Fed on Wednesday voted to hold rates in place, despite harsh and constant criticism from the president, but the new numbers could push officials to make a change when they meet in September."

The season is off to a slow start so far, with only four named storms, but the National Weather Service has predicted an above-normal season for this year thanks to warm ocean temperatures. NOAA estimates there will be between 13 and 19 named storms this year, with six to 10 developing into hurricanes. So far, systems named Andrea, Barry, Chantal and Dexter have been strong enough to be classified as tropical storms. Andrea and Dexter did not make landfall. Tropical Storm Barry caused flooding in southeastern Mexico and its remnants played a role in devastating floods that hit Central Texas in July, killing more than 130 people. Chantal led to severe flooding in North Carolina, causing dams to fail and culverts to crumble. Two deaths in North Carolina were blamed on the flooding.\nTangent\nMuch of the northeast and some of the midwest is under air quality alerts Monday as smoke from hundreds of wildfires in Canada drifts across the border. Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island are under alert, as are northern Connecticut and Pennsylvania. Canada is experiencing its second worst wildfire season on record, NPR reported, with more than 700 active fires burning on Sunday and more than 500 burning out of control."

      "text": "Topline\nThe Better Business Bureau issued a warning to online shoppers after dozens of people reported they've fallen for scams when trying to buy popular Labubu dolls online and, in some cases, lost hundreds of dollars.\nKey Facts\nThe BBB Scam Tracker has 76 reports from people who thought they were purchasing authentic Labubus, but they turned out to be counterfeit dolls known as Lafufus, or they didn\u2019t receive anything at all.\nSome customers say they realized their mistake almost immediately after placing their orders and reached out to the seller only to be told it was too late to cancel, or to be ghosted and later find the website from which they ordered no longer existed.\nMany of the customers reported they made their purchases on websites they found through ads on social media, largely TikTok and Instagram, which the BBB warns against as sponsored ads are a common way scammers look to trick online shoppers.\nA customer who lost almost $500 in July said the website that scammed them used images and descriptions from the website of Labubu maker Pop Mart, \"giving the impression the products were authentic.\"\nThe most commonly reported scam sellers were Kawaii Room, Cult Neo, Bubulands, Bears R Us and Labubu Fantasy.\nThe BBB warns customers to be wary of too-good-to-be-true deals, read customer reviews, search any new website on the BBB Scam Tracker and use traceable payment methods, like credit cards, instead of peer-to-peer payment apps.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines. Text \u201cAlerts\u201d to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here: joinsubtext.com/forbes.\nHow To Know If A Labubu Is Authentic\nThe easiest way to ensure the purchase of an authentic Labubu is to shop directly through the Pop Mart Amazon store of popmart.com, which does provide advance warning of new product drops but the dolls often sell out quickly. If shopping elsewhere, Alyssa Parker with the Better Business Bureau of Eastern Carolinas told ABC7 what to look for: \"One of the telltale signs is the fact that the real Labubu has nine teeth. Their face is a specific color and actually has an authenticity stamp on the bottom of their foot,\" she said. \"The fake ones will not have that; they may have a different number of teeth in their face, maybe a little bit of a different color.\" Authentic toys also have a QR code on both the box and the wash label, which will direct owners to a verification page when scanned. Authentic packaging also has a 3D, holographic sticker with \"POP MART\" clearly printed on the box, while fake ones may have flat, dull, or poorly printed holograms, along with blurry or misaligned QR codes.\nKey Background\nLabubus are small plush toys, often worn as key chains, that have been made by Pop Mart since 2019. Labubus have skyrocketed in popularity thanks, in part, to endorsements from celebrities like Lisa from the K-pop group Blackpink, Rihanna and Dua Lipa, and also through TikTok \u201cunboxing\u201d videos that shot them to viral fame. Labubus typically sell for $20 to $30 in \u201cblind boxes\u201d so the buyer doesn\u2019t know what color or design the doll has until the box is opened. Much-more-valuable \u201csecret\u201d Labubus, which consumers have a 1-in-72 chance of buying, have popped up on resale sites for thousands of dollars. Fans have lined up at Pop Mart stores and vending machines for hours, even traveling overseas to get their hands on one. And while some people are buying knock-off Labubus by accident, others are knowingly looking to buy Lafufus and the counterfeit market is booming. Customs offices in China seized nearly 49,000 suspected Lafufus in recent weeks, the Washington Post reported, and another 200,000 fake Labubu goods were seized in Ningbo in April. TikTokers are going viral by showing off their Lafufu hauls, and counterfeit dolls have shown up in boutiques and gift shops around the world.\nBig Number\n149%. That's how much search for 'Lafufu' has risen in the last month, USA Today reported.\nSurprising Fact\nPop Mart pulled the dolls from all U.K. stores following reports of customers fighting over them earlier this year.\nForbes Valuation\nWang Ning,the 38-year-old founder of toy maker Pop Mart International Group, has an estimated net worth of $22.9 billion. He joined the ranks of China\u2019s top 10 billionaires for the first time in June. Pop Mart went public in Hong Kong in 2020."

      "text": "Topline\nAlmost 90% of American adults say they're stressed about the cost of groceries, a new poll out Monday shows, as the price of food rises and items like poultry, ground beef and eggs see the biggest cost jumps.\nKey Facts\nMore than half of Americans (53%) see grocery prices as a major source of stress and another 33% see it as a minor source of stress, according to a new poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.\nMore people were concerned about grocery prices than any other financial concern brought up in the poll, but more than half of respondents also said they were at least somewhat stressed about their salaries, the cost of housing, the amount of money they have saved, their credit card debt and the cost of health care.\nThe Consumer Price Index shows the price of food has risen 3% in the last 12 months\u2014groceries have risen 2.4% while dining out is 3.8% costlier than it was 12 months ago.\nFrom June 2024 to June 2025, groceries got more expensive in every category tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics: meats, poultry, fish and eggs rose in price by 5.6% (egg prices alone rose 27.3%); nonalcoholic beverages are 4.4% more expensive; fruits and vegetables rose in price by 0.7%; and both cereals and bakery products and the index for dairy products rose 0.9%.\nAt 3%, the cost of food is rising faster than the overall inflation rate as measured by the Consumer Price Index, at 2.7%.\nAfter groceries, the price of housing had the highest number of people reporting it as a major stressor in Monday\u2019s poll (47%), followed by the amount of money saved (43%), salary (43%) and the cost of health care (42%).\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines.

That's how much the price of chicken breast increased, per pound, from July 2024 to July 2025, according to NBC News, making it the largest price hike among the six staple items tracked by the outlet. The cost of ground beef increased 67 cents per pound, while eggs grew 64 cents more expensive per dozen.\nAre Grocery Prices Up More This Year Than In Past Years?\nWhile food prices are up despite President Donald Trump's campaign promise to \"immediately bring prices down,\u201d 3% is nowhere near the double-digit jumps earlier in the decade. Food inflation was 10.4% in 2022 and 6.3% in 2021. This year is so far slightly above, but largely in line, with price increases in 2023 (2.7%) and 2024 (2.5%).\nAre Tariffs Going To Make Groceries More Expensive?\nProbably. The Budget Lab at Yale estimates that tariff price increases will raise food costs by about another 3%. Fresh produce could initially jump in price by almost 7% before stabilizing long-term at 3.6% higher, and processed rice is expected to rise in price by 10.2% in the long term. Other items expected to cost more include beverages, cereal and grains, sugar, meat and dairy products, Yale said. Grocery products imported from other countries, like bananas, beer, wine and cheese, will face additional tariffs. In 2024, the U.S. imported about $221 billion in food products, 62% of which came from five countries: Mexico, Canada, the EU, Brazil and China, according to the Tax Foundation. Trump has agreed to pause higher tariffs on Mexico for 90 days, and has agreed to a 15% tariff on goods from the EU. The White House said Canada will face a 35% tariff rate\u2014up from an earlier 25%\u2014for goods not covered under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). Trump has threatened a 50% tariff on Brazil due to the ongoing criminal prosecution of his ally and the country\u2019s former president, Jair Bolsonaro, and the average tariff on Chinese exports is currently 55%."

While most symptoms usually resolve within two weeks, the \u201cdebilitating\u201d joint pain can persist for months or years, according to the World Health Organization. The joint pain is the calling card of chikungunya and, without it, people with the virus can easily be misdiagnosed as having dengue or Zika, making it hard to know exactly how many people are infected. Chikungunya was first detected in southern Tanzania in the 1950s. The name comes from a word in the Kimakonde language of southern Tanzania that means \u201cthat which bends up,\" meant to describe the contorted posture of people with severe joint pain.\nHow Does Chikungunya Virus Spread?\nChikungunya can only be transmitted to a person through the bite of an infected mosquito, but people can transmit it right back to the insect. So if a non-infected mosquito bites a person with the chikungunya, it can contract the virus and infect the next healthy person it bites. It is not contagious or transmittable person to person.\nIs There A Chikungunya Vaccine?\nYes. There are two approved for use in the United States: IXCHIQ, a live-attenuated vaccine, is approved for people 18 and older and VIMKUNYA, a virus-like particle vaccine, is approved for those 12 and older. The CDC only recommends the vaccine to people traveling to an area with a chikungunya outbreak.\nIs There Chikungunya Virus In The United States?\nYes, but it's not common. In the U.S., chikungunya is primarily found in travelers who've been infected in other countries and a locally acquired case hasn't been reported since 2019. But travel-associated cases are on the rise. Chikungunya was rarely found in the U.S. before 2006, but as many as 28 people per year tested positive from 2006 to 2013. Nearly 3,000 travel-associated cases were identified in 2014 but that number steadily decreased down to 36 in 2021 before slowly climbing again. There were 199 cases found in 2024 and, in 2025, there have been 46 cases so far.\nWhere Chikungunya Virus Most Commonly Found?\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warn that U.S. travelers visiting Brazil, Columbia, India, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Thailand and the Philippines are at an elevated risk of exposure. The CDC also issued a Level 2 travel alert for Foshan city, and recommends any traveler to the area be vaccinated. People who do visit are encouraged to prevent mosquito bites by wearing insect repellent, long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Pregnant women are advised not to travel to the region.\nWhat To Watch For\nMore infections. Hong Kong reported its first case of chikungunya in a 12-year-old boy Monday."

      "text": "Topline\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday said he's ordered the Department of Commerce to change how it conducts the decennial census, pushing to no longer include undocumented immigrants in its count of U.S. residents.\nKey Facts\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump said the commerce department has been ordered to start working on a \"new and highly accurate CENSUS based on modern day facts and figures\u201d that will not count \u201cPeople who are in our Country illegally.\u201d\nThe census, which takes place every 10 years and is constitutionally mandated, counts all people living in the United States, including citizens and non-citizens, whether they are in the country legally or not.\nThe census data is used for various purposes including deciding the number of U.S. Representatives each state gets, drawing electoral district boundaries and allocating government resources.\nThe next census is scheduled for 2030.\nThis is a developing story and will be updated.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines. Text \u201cAlerts\u201d to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here: joinsubtext.com/forbes.\nKey Background\nArticle I, Section 2 of the Constitution establishes how representatives are allocated for the U.S. House and calls for a census every 10 years to determine the population of each state. Non-citizens have never been excluded from the count, whether they are legal residents or not. In his first term, Trump tried to add a question about citizenship to the census with the goal of ultimately excluding undocumented immigrants from the count deciding how many representatives each state gets, but the Supreme Court blocked the move. The attempt was slammed by critics who said it would lead to underrepresentation for certain states and discourage people from participating in the census. Researchers found that noncitizens who pay taxes but are ineligible to have a Social Security number would be less likely to fill out the census questionnaire, exacerbating undercounts of some groups. After the Supreme Court ruling, Trump instead issued a memorandum demanding \"illegal aliens\u201d be excluded from apportionment and put out an executive order telling government agencies to produce \u201cadministrative records\u201d to determine the number of non-citizens, but President Joe Biden revoked both of those decisions before the 2020 census data was released.\nWhat Information Does The Census Gather?\nThe census gathers demographic data on people's age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status and household composition. It also asks about employment status, occupation and level of education, and about housing units, occupancy status, number of rooms and rent prices. Questions on birth, place of residence and migration patterns help track population movement.\nWhat Is The Census Used For?\nLots of things. Most notably, it finds how many people live in each state and that number is used to determine how many representatives each state gets in the U.S. House. The results are also sent to state legislatures and redistricting commissions to adjust or redraw electoral districts based on where populations have shifted. Billions of dollars in federal funding is allocated based on the results of the census, including through programs like Medicaid, Head Start and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP. The data also informs decisions on where to build hospitals and schools, and how to allocate public safety services like those provided by police and fire departments. The census is used by private business owners looking to make decisions based on where to open new storefronts, where to recruit employees and what services to offer.\nWhat Would Change If Undocumented Immigrants Were Not Longer Counted?\nHow many representatives each state has. The Pew Research Center used government records to analyze what states would be impacted back when Trump first floated this idea, and found California, Florida and Texas would each have one less seat than they would have been awarded based on population change alone. Alabama, Minnesota and Ohio would each have held onto a seat they otherwise would have lost.\nWhat To Watch For\nLawsuits. Trump\u2019s first attempt to change how immigrants were counted was swiftly met with court action, including from the the American Civil Liberties Union and several immigrants' rights groups. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled the Trump couldn\u2019t add the citizenship question, largely on procedural grounds."

      "text": "Topline\nThe National Weather Service has reportedly been given the OK to hire 450 new meteorologists, hydrologists and radar technicians months after roughly 600 employees were either fired or took the buyouts offered to millions of federal workers.\nKey Facts\nThe new hires were authorized directly by the Office of Personnel Management, CNN reported, citing an unnamed National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration official, after the NWS lobbied strongly to be exempt from the federal hiring freeze that started when Trump took office.\nThe agency claimed a public safety exemption in its plea to hire new people after the Department of Government Efficiency cut 11% of NOAA's workforce, about half of which came from the NWS.\nThe agency lost about 600 people\u2014roughly 100 probationary employees were fired and 500 took buyouts pushed by President Donald Trump\u2014which represents 17% of the NWS\u2019 workforce.\nIt\u2019s unclear if the agency will be making all new hires or re-hiring some of the employees that were let go in the DOGE cuts.\nCuts to the National Weather Service have been among the Trump administration\u2019s most criticized, particularly after staffing shortages were revealed at the two local forecasting offices closest to the deadly flash floods that killed more than 130 people in Texas in July.\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines.

That's how many vacancies there were out of 49 positions at NWS forecasting offices in central Texas. The San Antonio office had six vacancies out of 26 positions and the San Angelo office had four vacancies out of 23 jobs. While experts said the positions being filled likely wouldn\u2019t have made flood warnings more timely or accurate, some former NWS officials told The New York Times it may have impacted the agency\u2019s ability to communicate with local authorities after the warnings were issued.\nCrucial Quote\n\u201cHow much time/money is it going to cost to train a bunch of new people when we had already-trained people in place?\u201d one unnamed NOAA official said to CNN.\nTangent\nThe hiring announcement comes at the start of what has historically been the busiest part of the Atlantic hurricane season and one week after the Department of Defense rolled back plans to stop publicly providing satellite data needed for hurricane forecasting and sea ice monitoring. The Atlantic hurricane season lasts from June 1 to Nov. 30 but August, September and October are usually the most active months. NOAA has predicted a slightly above-normal season for this year, in part due to warmer-than-average ocean temperatures, estimating there will be 13-19 named storms this year, with six to 10 developing into hurricanes. NOAA in June said it would stop providing satellite data it has made available since 1962, citing \u201csignificant cybersecurity risk,\" but on July 30 confirmed to The New York Times the program will keep running indefinitely.\nWhat To Watch For\nThe National Hurricane Center is monitoring two systems with the potential to develop. The NHC says there is a 40% chance a disturbance off the coast of South Carolina will develop into a tropical depression in the next week, and a 50% chance of a tropical depression forming from a disturbance moving over the central tropical Atlantic. Systems are named when they reach tropical storm strength (sustained winds of 39 mph or higher) and become hurricanes when sustained winds reach at least 74 mph."
