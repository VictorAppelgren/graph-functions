  "description": "President Trump attacked NBC and ABC News late Sunday, deriding them for their \u201cbiased\" coverage and said he would be in favor of the FCC revoking their licenses.",
  "content": "President Trump went on a late-night attack against NBC and ABC News on Sunday, deriding them for what, in his view, was \"biased\" coverage and said he would be in favor of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revoking their licenses.\n\nThe Republican president said the news outlets had given him negative coverage on \"97%\" of stories.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear from where Trump was citing the \"97%\" figure. A study released earlier this year by the conservative media watchdog group, Media Research Center (MRC), found that coverage of the president\u2019s first 100 days in office was \"92% negative.\"\n\n\"IF THAT IS THE CASE,\" Trump wrote in his characteristic use of all caps, \"THEY ARE SIMPLY AN ARM OF THE DEMOCRAT PARTY AND SHOULD, ACCORDING TO MANY HAVE THEIR LICENSES REVOKED.\"\n\nBROADCAST BIAS: NETWORKS SNOOZE AS TOP BIDEN AIDES TAKE THE FIFTH ON BIDEN-DECLINE SCANDAL\n\nTrump said he would be \"totally in favor\" of the move because \u2013 according to him \u2013 these outlets are \"so biased and untruthful, an actual threat to our Democracy.\"\n\nThe president followed up with another post attacking both outlets as \"FAKE NEWS\" and \"two of the absolute worst and most biased networks anywhere in the world.\"\n\nTRUMP TAKES AIM AT CNN AND NEW YORK TIMES OVER IRAN STRIKE COVERAGE, BUT JOURNALISTS ARE SHRUGGING\n\nTrump questioned why both entities aren\u2019t \"paying Millions of Dollars a year in LICENSE FEES.\"\n\n\"They should lose their Licenses for their unfair coverage of Republicans and/or Conservatives, but at a minimum, they should pay up BIG for having the privilege of using the most valuable airwaves anywhere at anytime!!!\" Trump wrote. \"Crooked \u2018journalism\u2019 should not be rewarded, it should be terminated!!!\"\n\nFox News Digital has reached out to both ABC and NBC News for a response to Trump\u2019s posts.\n\nBeing national networks, ABC and NBC News do not hold FCC licenses for news content but provide programming for local affiliates across the country \u2013 which are regulated by the FCC and require licensing to operate in the U.S.\n\nTRUMP THRASHES CNN AS \u2018GUTLESS LOSERS\u2019 FOR COVERAGE OF US STRIKES ON IRAN\n\nTV stations pay fees and annual regulatory fees based on station type and market, while cable outlets pay their own regulatory fees. Only congress has the authority to impose and collect such fees, which are deposited in the U.S. Treasury.\n\nAny move to revoke licenses based on real or perceived news bias would run afoul of First Amendment protections. Similar attempts in the past have been struck down by the courts.\n\nThis is not the first time Trump has attacked broadcast outlets or threatened to strip their licenses. Last year, Trump settled a defamation suit against ABC for $15 million, and he famously hosted \"The Apprentice\" on NBC before entering the world of politics.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd earlier this year, Paramount Global and CBS agreed to pay out a settlement over the president\u2019s election interference lawsuit against the network.",

      "text": "President Donald Trump ripped what he terms \"fake news\" media outlets on Tuesday morning.\nWhile answering questions about Israel's war with Iran as he departed the White House, Trump hammered CNN and MSNBC after accusing them of downplaying the success of the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities last weekend, calling CNN in particular \"scum.\"\n\"You're gutless losers,\" he said. \"I say that to CNN because I watch it. I have no choice. I've gotta watch that garbage. It's all garbage. It's all fake news. But I think CNN is a gutless group of people.\"\nMISDIRECTION AND 'DECEPTION' LIKELY KEY IN TRUMP ADMIN\u2019S SURPRISE IRAN STRIKE\nThe U.S. military on Saturday carried out massive precision strikes on three key nuclear sites in Iran, including Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. Long-range B-2 stealth bomber aircraft dropped 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs on the locations in an attack that Trump called \"a spectacular military success.\"\n\"Iran's key nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated,\" Trump stated in an address to the nation that night.\nWhile speaking with reporters on Tuesday, Trump recounted the success of the mission and savaged outlets that questioned whether the three nuclear facilities were destroyed. Trump officials have hailed the mission as experts continue to assess how much Iran's nuclear ambitions have been set back.\nCLICK HERE FOR ISRAEL-IRAN LIVE UPDATES\nAfter one reporter asked if Iran could rebuild its nuclear program, the president said, \"That place is demolished. The B-2 pilots did their job. They did it better than anybody could even imagine. They hit late in the evening. It was dark with no moon. And they hit that target with every one of those things. And that place is gone.\"\nHe then mentioned mainstream outlets, saying, \"But when I see CNN, all night long, they're trying to say, \u2018Well, maybe it wasn't really as demolished as we thought.' It was demolished. You take a look at the pinpricks, and you see that place is gone. And I will say, I think CNN ought to apologize to the pilots of the B-2s. I think that MSDNC [MSNBC] ought to apologize. I think these guys, really \u2013 these networks, and these cable networks are real losers. You really are.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\nTrump continued to dig in on CNN and MSNBC, criticizing the former for the changes in the network\u2019s leadership in recent years.\n\"And the people that run it, nobody even knows, it's been sold so many times,\" Trump said. \"But the people that run it ought to be ashamed. MSDNC \u2013 a guy named Brian Roberts \u2013 he heads it. He's a disgrace. He's a weak, pathetic disgrace.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCNN declined to comment on Trump\u2019s remarks. MSNBC didn't respond to a request for comment."

      "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s latest crusade against the media has focused on CNN and The New York Times, but journalists say they\u2019re unfazed despite legal threats from the commander-in-chief.\nTrump, who has a decades-long history of litigation that long predates his time in politics, has launched major lawsuits in the past year against CBS News, ABC News, The Des Moines Register, and the Pulitzer Prize board, while threatening other news organizations and suggesting reporters will be pressured to reveal their sources on stories about the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities.\n\"These days, threats from the president have become business as usual for journalists. It won\u2019t stop us from doing our jobs,\" New York Times White House correspondent Peter Baker told Fox News Digital.\nTRUMP GOES AFTER CNN, NY TIMES FOR \u2018FAKE NEWS\u2019 ABOUT STRIKES ON IRANIAN NUCLEAR FACILITIES\nTrump repeatedly criticized CNN and The New York Times in recent days for reporting what he called \"fake news\" about the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, with reports from both outlets suggesting they did not effectively destroy the country\u2019s nuclear programs. A personal attorney for the president called the Times\u2019 reporting \"false,\" \"defamatory\" and \"unpatriotic,\" while threatening legal action. He also threatened to sue CNN over its reporting.\n\"It\u2019s not affecting my day at all,\" a CNN journalist told Fox News Digital.\nWhile Trump told \"Sunday Morning Futures\" host Maria Bartiromo that he wants to see people prosecuted for the leak of a classified early U.S. intelligence assessment used by CNN and the Times, Baker believes covering the strike on Iran was critical.\n\"It\u2019s hard to think of anything more central to our journalistic mission than to report on the effects of a war involving a nuclear program,\" Baker added, directing Fox News Digital to a letter Times senior vice president David McCraw, who serves as the paper\u2019s lead newsroom attorney, penned last week.\nNEW YORK TIMES ATTORNEY TELLS TRUMP NO APOLOGY COMING FOR COVERAGE OF IRAN STRIKES\n\"It\u2019s a pretty good summation of our view,\" Baker said.\nMcCraw shot down the notion that any apology or retraction is on the horizon and said that Americans deserve to know whether the attack on Iran was a success.\n\"We rely on our intelligence services to provide the kind of impartial assessment that we all need in a democracy to judge our country\u2019s foreign policy and the quality of our leaders\u2019 decisions. It would be irresponsible for a news organization to suppress that information and deny the public the right to hear it,\" McCraw wrote. \"We told the truth to the best of our ability. We will continue to do so.\"\nMeanwhile, Trump scored a victory in his lawsuit against CBS News late Tuesday night, as Paramount Global settled to the tune of $16 million. That amount will cover legal fees, costs of the case, and contributions to his library or charitable causes, to be determined at Trump\u2019s discretion. There is an expectation that there will be another allocation in the eight figures set aside for advertisements, public service announcements, or other similar transmissions, in support of conservative causes by the network, Fox News Digital has learned.\n\"60 Minutes\" correspondent Scott Pelley previously said a settlement would be \"very damaging to CBS, to Paramount, to the reputation of those companies.\" Other high-profile CBS journalists, such as Lesley Stahl, were vehemently against a settlement.\n\"The unanimous view at \u201860 Minutes\u2019 is that there should be no settlement, and no money paid, because the lawsuit is complete bulls---,\" one veteran \"60 Minutes\" producer told Fox News Digital last month.\nHowever, Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder who recused herself from settlement discussions in February, made clear that she wanted to settle Trump's lawsuit in hopes of clearing the pathway for Paramount's multibillion-dollar planned merger with Skydance Media, which needs approval from the Trump administration's FCC.\nTrump also received $15 million from ABC last year to settle a defamation lawsuit brought when its top anchor, George Stephanopoulos, falsely asserted that he was found \"liable for rape\" in a civil case during a contentious interview with Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., in March.\nIn 2018, USA Today investigative reporter Nick Penzenstadler examined what he called Trump\u2019s \"I\u2019ll sue you\" effect.\n\"The threats can be effective,\" Penzenstadler wrote at the time. \"Even the possibility of a lawsuit by a rich, powerful opponent raises the specter of years of expensive and time-consuming litigation.\"\nA longtime media industry executive with a history of overseeing newsrooms feels \"Trump has shown that there\u2019s actually bark to his bite\" over the past few years, and it would be wise for news organizations to attempt fairness when covering the administration.\n\"He will go after these media companies that have never been held accountable before for bias. He files the lawsuits in the south, where the New York media organizations are at a disadvantage,\" the media executive told Fox News Digital.\n\"ABC and CBS were easy marks because their parent companies had more important business with Trump than coddling the egos of George Stephanopoulos and Scott Pelley. In the case of the Times and CNN, however, especially with CNN being spun off, these smaller news organizations may be willing to fight harder and longer,\" they continued. \"But they should gear up for a drawn-out, ugly battle in a southern courtroom with embarrassing discovery processes and unsympathetic judges and juries.\"\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTrump also nodded along on Tuesday as Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said she was working with the Justice Department to see if CNN can be \"prosecuted\" for a recent segment about an app that tracks the location of ICE agents. CNN has said there is \"nothing illegal\" about reporting on the existence of an app.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nCNN has also stood by its reporting on the Iran strike.\n\"CNN stands by our thorough reporting on an early intelligence assessment of the recent strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, which has since been confirmed by other news organizations. The White House has acknowledged the existence of the assessment, and their statement is included in our story,\" a CNN spokesperson told Fox News Digital."

He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate.

      "text": "FIRST ON FOX -- Evening newscasts on ABC, NBC and CBS have slapped President Donald Trump with 92% negative coverage as the 100th day of his second term approaches, according to the Media Research Center (MRC).\nThe MRC analyzed ABC\u2019s \"World News Tonight,\" \"NBC Nightly News\" and \"CBS Evening News\" from Jan. 20 through April 9 and found 899 stories that discussed President Trump or the Trump administration. The media watchdog group found that 92.2% of the coverage was negative compared to only 7.8% positive.\n\"Just 100 days into President Donald Trump\u2019s second term, the broadcast evening news landscape is even more lopsided than it was eight years ago, when Trump was besieged with relentlessly hostile coverage,\" researcher Rich Noyes wrote.\n'60 MINUTES' PRODUCER'S ABRUPT EXIT FUELS DRAMA AT CBS NEWS AS NETWORK BATTLES TRUMP LAWSUIT\n\"Eight years ago, using the identical methodology, we found Trump was blasted with 89% negative coverage at the hands of these networks during the first weeks of his first term,\" Noyes added.\nThe study revealed a stark contrast to coverage of former President Joe Biden\u2019s first 100 days in office, which was 59% positive, according to the MRC.\n\"Yet despite the overwhelming negativity of their coverage, the networks found Trump irresistible as a news subject, at least compared with Biden. From January 20 through April 9, 2017, the networks saturated their newscasts with 1,900 minutes of Trump news; during the same time period this year, we tallied a massive 1,716 minutes of coverage. But in 2021, evening news viewers saw only 726 minutes of Biden coverage during these same weeks, less than half of the airtime devoted to either of the new Trump administrations,\" Noyes wrote.\nThe MRC explained that it determined the spin of coverage by tallying \"all explicitly evaluative statements\" about President Trump from either reporters, anchors or non-partisan sources such as experts or voters. Partisan sources, such as elected officials, were not included.\nTOP '60 MINUTES' PRODUCER RESIGNS FROM SHOW, CITES LACK OF INDEPENDENCE\nWhile Trump\u2019s personal controversies dominated much of the coverage during his first term, the MRC found that coverage of the first 100 days of his second term has been largely spent on policy issues. Tariffs were covered for 361 minutes to lead the way, followed by DOGE receiving 301 minutes of coverage and immigration received 233 minutes of airtime on ABC, NBC and CBS\u2019 evening newscasts, the study found.\n\"The networks\u2019 spin on Trump\u2019s tariffs faced 93% negative coverage, while the DOGE cutbacks to government were greeted by 97% negative spin,\" Noyes wrote when detailing the findings.\n\"Even on immigration, the issue where the public gives the President his highest ratings, the networks\u2019 spin was 93% negative,\" he continued. \"Out of nearly four hours of evening news airtime devoted to immigration, these newscasts spent just 3.5 minutes letting viewers know just how much Trump has reduced border crossings.\"\nTrump\u2019s top associates haven\u2019t exactly received glowing coverage, either.\nTRUMP DEFAMATION SUIT AGAINST ABC, STEPHANOPOULOS OFFICIALLY DISMISSED AFTER $15 MILLION SETTLEMENT\nThe study found that HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. faced 89% negative coverage, DOGE\u2019s Elon Musk was hit with 96% negative coverage, and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth received a unanimous 100% bad press from ABC, NBC and CBS evening newscasts.\nABC, NBC and CBS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTrump has a significant history with each network. He is currently seeking $20 billion in a lawsuit against CBS, alleging election interference over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\nLast year, Trump settled a defamation suit against ABC for $15 million, and he famously hosted \"The Apprentice\" on NBC before entering the world of politics.\n\"The mainstream media continues to portray President Trump\u2019s historic accomplishments negatively, even though 77 million Americans voted for his policies. Americans know the President is doing what is best for the country, which is why the legacy media\u2019s ratings continue to drop and people are finding new ways to consume the news,\" a White House spokesperson told Fox News Digital."

      "text": "The evening news shows on the broadcast networks these days aren\u2019t always fixated on politics. They often lead their half-hours with frightening weather footage, and turn to Washington about 10 minutes later. But ABC, CBS and NBC can still determine what political scandals should be considered important, and what scandals should be buried and not acknowledged as scandals.\nThe networks blatantly demonstrate their partisanship by treating Republican scandals as urgent matters loaded with historical weight, and dismissing Democrat scandals as either nonexistent or as desperately partisan misinformation.\nWhen Democrat and then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stacked a \"special committee\" on the January 6 riot with only two personally picked Republicans who would obey all of her commands, that was \"historic\" and nonpartisan. All of its hearings were aired live on the broadcast networks every minute, even in prime time. When Republican House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer investigates anything about former President Joe Biden and the Democrats, these networks act like all of their Capitol Hill reporters were laid off.\nREP. JAMES COMER MOCKS NBC STORY EQUATING HIS DIGITAL SIGNATURE WITH BIDEN'S AUTOPEN SCANDAL\nOne major scandal of historical import is Biden\u2019s mental decline throughout his presidency, and especially at the end, as Democrats refused to consider any primary opponents, trying to push him into another four incapable years.\nIn May, an online national I&I/TIPP Poll found 58% of those surveyed were in favor of hearings (or even criminal proceedings) on the Biden-decline scandal, and only 30% picked \"do nothing, it\u2019s just politics as usual.\" All of the so-called scandal cops at the networks are in the minority.\nThe networks failed to move on Monday morning when The New York Times published an eye-opening front-page story. The headline was bland \u2013 \"Biden Says Autopen Clemencies Were All His\" \u2013 but within, you could see that Biden was letting his staff make decisions for him. NBC offered 34 seconds on Monday night. The others did not.\nBROADCAST BIAS: HOW NETWORKS BURIED A BOMBSHELL SENATE HEARING ON BIDEN'S MENTAL FITNESS\nEarly on Monday, NBCNews.com published a ludicrous article with the Democrat spin that Rep. Comer has used digital signatures in committee correspondence \u2013 as if that\u2019s anything like a president being unaware if he pardoned a cocaine dealer. That story was so lame that NBC didn\u2019t even put it on \"Today\" or \"Nightly News.\" It was just MSNBC bait.\nOn Wednesday, Comer\u2019s committee dragged in subpoenaed top Jill Biden aide Anthony Bernal. He\u2019s a major figure in \"Original Sin,\" the Alex Thompson-Jake Tapper book on hiding Biden\u2019s cognitive decline. \"Biden\u2019s aides would say that she was one of the most powerful First Ladies in history, and as a result he became one of the most influential people in the White House,\" wrote Thompson and Tapper. They touted Bernal as the \"loyalty police\" and one of the \"protectors of the myth.\"\nBernal is still loyal: he took the Fifth Amendment. \"Well, unfortunately, that was quick,\" said Comer after the deposition ended. \"I believe the American people are concerned. They\u2019re concerned that there were people making decisions in the White House that were not only unelected but no one to this day knows who they were.\"\nBROADCAST BIAS: THE NETWORKS ADORED TRUMP 'TELL ALL' BOOKS, BUT DOWNPLAY BOOKS WITH BIDEN SCOOPS\nABC, CBS and NBC failed to devote one second to this story. If it pleases President Donald Trump, it\u2019s not getting touched. Taxpayer-funded PBS and NPR had no segment. (Fun fact: neither did Jake Tapper on his CNN show that day.) These networks didn\u2019t offer that judgment when Trump aides took the Fifth before the Pelosi-picked panel on January 6. That showed rotten contempt for the public!\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION\nBernal was not alone: on July 9, Biden\u2019s personal doctor Kevin O\u2019Connor repeatedly took the Fifth. In that case, \"NBC Nightly News\" offered a story. The other networks did nothing.\nThis week, the broadcast networks properly devoted stories to Trump\u2019s new diagnosis of a \"chronic veinous insufficiency,\" but that is a routine diagnosis for older people. It in no way compromises his capacity to be president, unlike Biden\u2019s growing enfeeblement.\nBROADCAST BIAS: NETWORKS' TAKE ON TRUMP\u2019S 100 DAYS WAS 100% SHOCKING, 0% SURPRISING\nIn May, an online national I&I/TIPP Poll found 58% of those surveyed were in favor of hearings (or even criminal proceedings) on the Biden-decline scandal, and only 30% picked \"do nothing, it\u2019s just politics as usual.\"\nOf course, there was a Trump scandal to push at these networks this week: a fight between Trump supporters over what would be released by the Justice Department about the late child-sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. Among them, the Big Three evening newscasts devoted 20 minutes and eight seconds to Trump\u2019s Epstein problems from Monday through Thursday, more than half of it (11 minutes, 43 seconds) on ABC.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nABC\u2019s Rachel Scott performed the classic spin at the end of her story on Thursday: \"And as much as the president wants to turn the page, behind the scenes, this is consuming a lot of time at the White House. His advisers [are] meeting about this, trying to figure a way to move past it, but many Republicans [are] making it clear this is not going away.\"\nScandals are \"not going away\" when the liberal networks want to inflict headaches on the Republicans. With Democrat scandals, they can\u2019t \"go away\" when they never arrived."

      "text": "FIRST ON FOX \u2013 Paramount Global and CBS agreed on Tuesday to pay President Donald Trump a sum that could reach north of $30 million to settle the president\u2019s election interference lawsuit against the network.\nTrump will receive $16 million upfront. This will cover legal fees, costs of the case, and contributions to his future presidential library or charitable causes, to be determined at Trump\u2019s discretion.\nThere is an anticipation that there will be another allocation in the eight figures set aside for advertisements, public service announcements, or other similar transmissions, in support of conservative causes by the network in the future, Fox News Digital has learned. With these considerations, CBS would pay well in excess of the $15 million ABC paid Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit last year. Current Paramount management disputes the additional allocation.\nSources close to the situation told Fox News Digital that CBS has agreed to update its editorial standards to install a mandatory new rule. Going forward, the network will promptly release full, unedited transcripts of future presidential candidates\u2019 interviews. People involved in the settlement talks have referred to this as the \"Trump Rule.\"\n\"With this record settlement, President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit. CBS and Paramount Global realized the strength of this historic case and had no choice but to settle. President Trump will always ensure that no one gets away with lying to the American People as he continues on his singular mission to Make America Great Again,\" a spokesperson for Trump\u2019s legal team told Fox News Digital.\nTrump was seeking $20 billion in his lawsuit against CBS over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing the network of election interference leading up to the 2024 contest. CBS is not acknowledging any journalistic wrongdoing with the settlement.\n\"The settlement will include a release of all claims regarding any CBS reporting through the date of the settlement, including the Texas action and the threatened defamation action,\" parent company Paramount said in a statement.\nThe lawsuit alleged CBS News deceitfully edited an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't \"listening\" to the Biden administration. Harris was widely mocked for the \"word salad\" answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\nHowever, when the same question aired during a primetime special on the network, Harris had a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of deceitfully editing Harris' \"word salad\" answer to shield the Democratic nominee from further backlash leading up to Election Day.\nThe raw transcript and footage released earlier this year by the FCC showed that both sets of Harris' comments came from the same response, but CBS News had aired only the first half of her response in the \"Face the Nation\" preview clip and aired the second half during the primetime special.\nCBS News had long denied any wrongdoing and stood by the broadcast and its reporting.\nParamount and Trump\u2019s legal team had agreed to mediation designed to help the sides reach a settlement. It was widely believed that Paramount Global controlling shareholder Shari Redstone wanted to settle the suit ahead of a planned multi-billion-dollar merger with Skydance Media in hopes of preventing potential retribution by Trump's FCC, which has the authority to halt the transaction.\n\"This lawsuit is completely separate from, and unrelated to, the Skydance transaction and the FCC approval process. We will abide by the legal process to defend our case,\" Paramount said in a previous statement on the Skydance transaction.\nA source familiar with Paramount\u2019s current leadership told Fox News Digital that only the initial $16 million was sanctioned by the official mediator and they had no knowledge of any deal Trump made with incoming ownership.\nSkydance Media CEO David Ellison, who would control CBS after the planned merger, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nA Redstone spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nTrump confidently declared the case against CBS a \"winner\" in April.\n\"They cheated and defrauded the American People at levels never seen before in the Political Arena. Kamala Harris, during Early Voting and, immediately before Election Day, was asked a question, and gave an answer, that was so bad and incompetent that it would have cost her many of the Votes that she ended up getting,\" Trump posted on Truth Social ahead of mediation, going on to accuse the newsmagazine of perpetrating a fraud on the American people.\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and eight Democratic colleagues sent a letter to Redstone in May asking her not to settle the lawsuit against CBS News, which they called an \"attack on the First Amendment.\" They called the potential settlement a \"grave mistake\" and \"a blatant attempt to intimidate the media and those who speak out against him, President Trump.\"\nThe letter also stated \"presidents do not get to punish or censor the media for criticizing them\" in the United States.\nTRUMP, CBS PARENT COMPANY SET FOR MEDIATION IN $20 BILLION \u201860 MINUTES\u2019 LAWSUIT\nEarlier this year, FCC Chair Brendan Carr ordered CBS News to hand over the unedited transcript as part of its probe into whether the network violated the FCC's \"news distortion\" policy after a complaint was filed. CBS had refused to release the unedited transcript until the FCC got involved.\nTOP '60 MINUTES' PRODUCER RESIGNS FROM SHOW, CITES LACK OF INDEPENDENCE\nTrump's attorneys amended their lawsuit to include multiple excerpts from the unedited transcript in hopes of bolstering their case that CBS News withheld unflattering exchanges in order to help the Democratic nominee.\nThe saga emerged as a distraction inside CBS News and longtime \"60 Minutes\" executive producer Bill Owens walked away from the job in April because he wasn\u2019t able to make the \"independent decisions\" needed for the program to thrive. Owens, who had insisted CBS did nothing wrong with the Harris edit, was vehemently against offering any sort of apology to the president.\nThe settlement does not include a statement of regret. No amount will be paid directly or indirectly to President Trump personally.\nParamount\u2019s annual stockholders meeting is set for Wednesday, July 2 at 9 am E.T.\nCBS News President and CEO Wendy McMahon, who is believed to have been against settling with Trump, announced on May 19 that she was stepping down in another stunning move for the embattled company.\n\"It\u2019s become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward. It\u2019s time for me to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership,\" McMahon told staffers in a memo that was obtained by Fox News Digital.\n\"60 Minutes\" correspondent Scott Pelley previously said a settlement would be \"very damaging to CBS, to Paramount, to the reputation of those companies.\" Other high-profile CBS journalists, such as Lesley Stahl, were vehemently against a settlement.\n\"The unanimous view at \u201860 Minutes\u2019 is that there should be no settlement, and no money paid, because the lawsuit is complete bulls---,\" one veteran \"60 Minutes\" producer told Fox News Digital last month.\nABC also settled a defamation lawsuit in December with then-President-elect Trump for $15 million, after anchor George Stephanopoulos repeatedly and incorrectly asserted Trump had been found \"liable for rape\" in a civil trial last year. ABC additionally paid $1 million for President Trump\u2019s legal fees.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nFox News Digital\u2019s Brooke Singman contributed to this report."
