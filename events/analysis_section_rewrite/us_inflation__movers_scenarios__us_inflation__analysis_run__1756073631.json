      "feedback": "Actionable edits to upgrade to world-class quality: tighten the causal chain by mapping a single, testable mechanism from AI-driven unemployment risk through policy design to labor demand and asset pricing, and add explicit regime-specific invalidation points (Finland UBI results as a falsification anchor) with NL5YYTLF2; align with the SECTION FOCUS by delivering exactly 2 Up and 2 Down lines, each one sentence long, with crisply stated triggers and bounded horizons (0–3 weeks; 3–6 months; 6–12 months; Aug 2025–Jan 2026) and anchored catalysts (0J41Q7KTX, STBVARD8F, 22PL3Q360, W2622L6WW) to justify the probabilities; strengthen first-principles grounding by tying Regime A to productivity trajectories and real-rate differentials, Regime B to policy-design drag on demand, and Regime C to an unprofitable EV transition, with explicit probability bands (e.g., A 40–60%, B 25–35%, C 15–25%) and clear invalidation signals; improve quantification by ensuring all numbers come from sources and by reconciling conflicts across Ford, Nvidia, ACMR, and oil/semiconductor frameworks (SGB2PAZGK, STBVARD8F, 22PL3Q360, NL5YYTLF2); enhance citation discipline by attaching only in-text IDs to facts/numbers, and provide a concise watchlist and explicit path to recalibration if core inputs diverge.",
