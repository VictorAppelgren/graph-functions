  "description": "The NFL and NIKE have rolled out new uniforms for eight teams in 2025 meant to tie in with those clubs' local personalities.",
  "content": "\u2022 The NFL and Nike unveiled eight new \"Rivalries\" uniforms for the AFC East and NFC West teams.\n\u2022 The uniforms celebrate local traditions and team legacies with unique designs.\n\u2022 The uniforms will be worn once during the 2025 season in a divisional rivalry game.\n\nAfter four months of anticipation, particularly among those who fancy themselves football fashionistas, the NFL and Nike revealed their new \u201cRivalries\u201d uniforms Thursday morning \u2013 kits that make a departure from the fairly conservative looks the league has featured for most of its hundred-plus years of existence.\n\nEffectively cousins to the NBA\u2019s popular \"City Edition\" uniforms or Major League Baseball\u2019s \"City Connect\" jerseys, the \"Rivalries\" unis present looks \u2013 if ones that may not be embraced by more traditional fans \u2013 that will make the AFC East and NFC West teams that wear them this season pop for viewers while celebrating the local ethos of those clubs.\n\n\"Everyone loves good rivalries, which have the power to connect and transform athletes, fans, teams and entire communities,\" Nike relayed in a press release regarding the uniforms it first teased on the second day of the 2025 NFL draft.\n\n\"The 2025 Rivalries uniforms will celebrate storied local traditions and unite fan communities with designs unique to select cities and teams.\n\n\"The designs are rooted extensively in the legacies and inspirations true to each team, serving as authentic, competitive expressions of community pride while giving athletes and fans an opportunity to connect like never before.\"\n\nNFL UNIFORM POWER RANKS: Which teams are dressed best? Worst?\n\nThe new uniform for each team \u2013 and they all had direct input into their customized threads \u2013 will be worn once this season during a home game against a division rival (details below). They will then become part of the club\u2019s uniform closet for the next three years.\n\nThe league\u2019s other 24 teams will get their own \"Rivalries\" uniforms in future years, two additional divisions to be added to the rotation annually through the 2028 season.\n\n\"Rivalries will bring fresh energy to the field with each new uniform, while providing a platform to amplify the community and hometown pride that is rooted in each NFL fan,\" said Taryn Hutt, the NFL\u2019s vice president of club marketing, said in a statement.\n\nThe new \"Rivalries\" jerseys and associated gear and apparel will be available at nike.com, NFLshop.com and fanatics.com starting Sept. 10.\n\nThe league will literally look quite different in 2025 as eight teams \u2013 the Bills, Browns, Steelers, Chargers, Commanders, Packers, Saints and Buccaneers \u2013 previously revealed new throwback and/or alternate uniform looks earlier this summer.\n\nBut the \"Rivalries\" uniforms definitely demand a ranking of their own, so here goes \u2013 from best to worst:\n\nDid you hear about the haboob (better known as a dust storm) that engulfed Phoenix on Tuesday? Apparently it also sand-blasted the Cards\u2019 new uniforms \u2013 to nice effect.\n\nThe unis appear pockmarked by sand and feature a reimagined state flag on the shoulder. The flag and jersey number are adorned with copper trim, an ode to the official metal of Arizona. Literally a gritty look, the official theme of the Cardinals\u2019 Rivalries unis is \u201cBuilt to Last.\u201d\n\nThey\u2019re a close second, mainly because \u2013 I think \u2013 going with an even lighter gray than the team normally uses for the jerseys and pants might be a slight miss. But a \u201cHigh-Decibel Zone\u201d theme meant to honor the team\u2019s loud, proud, vocal fans is pretty sweet \u2212 Pearl Jam, Nirvana and Seattle's other legendary bands also surely proud. A soundwave pattern ripples across the shoulders and down the pants, appropriate given this team has set off seismometers in Seattle amid playoff touchdowns, like Marshawn Lynch\u2019s epic one in a 2011 wild-card upset of New Orleans.\n\n\u2018Hawks fans are further honored with \u201c12s\u201d embedded throughout the uniform including a cascade of them within the jersey numbers. The \u201cBeetle Green\u201d trim is a nice change from the typical \u201cAction Green.\u201d\n\nBut the best part appears to be a two-tone green and blue helmet that\u2019s been much better executed than the black-and-gold domes the Jaguars wore a few years ago.\n\nNike\u2019s hype video will make \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fans wonder if the Bills will be now playing north of the Wall (they do have a new stadium under construction after all, but unclear if it\u2019s rising in Westeros).\n\nAs for the uniforms, they\u2019re quite iced out \u2013 similar to the Vikings\u2019 \u201cWinter Warrior\u201d look. Buffalo\u2019s are called \u201cCold Front,\u201d and fans will be thrilled to see \u201cBills Mafia\u201d stitched inside the collar. But the coolest element is the silvery, texturized charging buffalo logo on the sleeve.\n\nIf the Bills are north of the Wall, then the Pats seem based near the Iron Islands. Their \u201cNor\u2019Easter\u201d uniforms feature a \u201cStorm Blue\u201d jersey \u201cinspired by the New England fog.\u201d The shoulder and pants striping and a new \u201cNE\u201d shoulder logo feature reflective silver material \u201cdesigned to represent beams of light shining off the lighthouse connected to Gillette Stadium.\u201d\n\nThe collar is busy but not in a bad way, ringed by six red stars representing each state in New England. \u201cWe Are All Patriots,\u201d which owner Robert Kraft declared after the team\u2019s first Super Bowl win in 2002 \u2013 just five months after 9/11 \u2013 is written inside of it. Solid.\n\nThey clearly want you to know their fan base is known as the \u201cFaithful,\u201d the word written in gold script above the jersey numbers while \u201cFaithful to the Bay\u201d lines the collar. The red jersey numbers are presented in a slick \u201csaloon font\u201d and trimmed in a vibrant gold the team has never really featured aside from its helmets.\n\nGiven how the team has incorporated a cream color into its color palette recently \u2013 noticeably on its website and social accounts \u2013 it is a bit disappointing the Niners went with a mostly black uniform. But this \u201cFor the Faithful\u201d version is the team\u2019s best homage yet to the California gold rush for which it\u2019s named.\n\nSadly, its best feature \u2013 \u201cGotham City Football Club\u201d written in Gothic font and topped by the Jets\u2019 plane logo \u2013 rests inside the neckline. The colors (\u201cEmpire Green,\u201d black and gray) are meant to serve as a callback to Hall of Fame QB Joe Namath, who led the NYJ to their only Super Bowl nearly 57 years ago. The graphics on the sleeves and chest logo are a whiff. We\u2019ll continue to wish this team would go whole hog on military airframes or, if Gotham is going to be theme, give us something more Batman-adjacent.\n\nFeels like we\u2019re reverting to the 1990s \u2013 it was a better time, right? \u2013 with more teams wanting a black uniform palette in their closet. Miami\u2019s \u201cDark Waters\u201d unis are meant to convey speed and South Florida\u2019s night life in what\u2019s officially a \u201cdark pitch-blue\u201d uniform with hits of \u201cTurbo Green,\u201d and the club\u2019s standard aqua and orange. Meh, we\u2019re not fooled. Missed opportunity not pivot to something closer to a \u201cMiami Vice\u201d feel.\n\nNike can be forgiven given a team that\u2019s played in Cleveland, L.A. (twice), Anaheim and St. Louis doesn\u2019t have especially deep roots. So the Rams\u2019 \u201cMidnight Mode\u201d really just renders them yet another team with a black alternate, along with hits of midnight blue on the sleeve \u2212 though those do a better job highlight the team\u2019s iconic horns. \u201cRams House\u201d is stitched inside the collar \u2013 even though SoFi Stadium is notoriously often overrun by visiting teams\u2019 fans.\n\nWhen will the 'Rivalries' uniforms be worn in 2025?\n\n\u25b6 New England Patriots: Nov. 13 vs. New York Jets\n\nAll NFL news on and off the field.

      "text": "NFL uniforms ranked: Where do Chargers, Buccaneers land after revealing new alternates?\nWith full-blown training camp practices still a few weeks away, the NFL is enjoying what should be the laziest portion of its calendar.\nBut talking about America\u2019s most popular sports league never goes out of fashion \u2013 even if you simply want to talk about its fashion. And while none of the 32 teams unveiled a significant uniform overhaul for 2025 \u2013 the Commanders did reveal a new alternate Tuesday morning and some other teams will follow suit in the coming days \u2212 that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t see some fresh originality this season.\nNot only will the league allow clubs to wear alternate or throwback uniforms from their \u201ccloset\u201d (\u201ckits\u201d are for soccer, football fashionistas) up to four times this season \u2013 previously, the max utilization was three times per year \u2013 restrictions that previously prevented them from combining alternate helmets with classic uniforms are being loosened. For example, we might now see the Bengals\u2019 white tiger helmet worn with their black jerseys, a combo heretofore verboten.\nThere\u2019s more.\nNike is launching \u201cRivalries\u201d uniforms and gear this year for AFC East and NFC West teams. And while details are currently under lock and key, USA TODAY Sports has learned it would be accurate to say the new threads will generally be adjacent to the NBA\u2019s popular \u201cCity Edition\u201d uniforms or Major League Baseball\u2019s \u201cCity Connect\u201d jerseys. Along with the uniform, the \u201cRivalries\u201d look will also mean another helmet in the closet for those eight teams in 2025 and the following three years, according to a person familiar with the rollout. That person requested anonymity given the NFL\u2019s and Nike\u2019s desire for secrecy around the unis ahead of their launch.\nPer the NFL, \u201cEach participating team will wear a unique Rivalries uniform with designs rooted extensively in local community insights during a single home game against a division rival. The designs have been brought to life by pulling inspiration from the history of each market and the aspects of the community that only that team\u2019s city embodies.\u201d\nThe other 24 teams will incrementally be added in groups of eight to the program through the 2028 season.\nUSA TODAY Sports will bring you more on this front in the coming weeks and looks forward to reviewing and assessing the new looks. But the July interlude seemed like a good time to roll out our annual uniform power rankings, listed from worst to best (previous rank in parentheses):\n32. Cleveland Browns (30)\nThe hardest-core purists will disagree ... and I suspect most of them live in northeast Ohio. But the colors are ugly, and the logo-less uniforms are boring. Full stop. And unless the soon-to-be-revealed alternate helmet features the Dawg Pound insignia fans and players picked two years ago \u2212 and fat chance of that \u2212 then why bother?\n31. Carolina Panthers (31)\nNot only do they look outdated, as most 1990s get-ups do, the Panthers just can\u2019t stop tinkering \u2013 literally using 10 different uniform combinations in 2024. Talk about a lack of identity. Interesting fact about the logo: it\u2019s meant to resemble the fused outline of North and South Carolina. It also looks better recessed like a shadow into the team\u2019s alternate black helmets \u2013 Panthers thrive with camouflage, y\u2019all. Otherwise? Keep the color scheme but reimagine everything below the neckline.\n30. Washington Commanders (32)\nBeen a turbulent few years, the franchise mothballing its long-worn uniforms \u2013 which it was finally compelled to do \u2013 in favor of the barebones \u201cWashington Football Team\u201d interim versions and then the semi-disastrous rollout of the Commanders rebranding. The current road jerseys with the gradient numbering remain eyesores. The original black Commanders alternates are pretty slick, the D.C. flag on the sleeves a nice detail, but many fans think it\u2019s too similar to the Steelers. Personally, I've never minded that the franchise retained its traditional colors, including the return of gold pants in 2024, to keep some linkage to its glory days \u2212 though some believe it would have been best to make a complete break from its 87-year run using a nickname that's defined as a racial slur.\nLittle chance of such a pivot now, the team essentially readopting the uniforms from its glory years Wednesday. The only noticeable difference in the new alternates, which resemble what the team wore in its four Super Bowl appearances between the 1982 and '91 seasons is the current Commanders \"W\" logo standing in for the former Indian head insignia.\n29. Tennessee Titans (23)\nWhile teams like the Panthers are something of a mess, the Titans seem to at least understand less is more \u2013 though even that\u2019s problematic to a degree. They wore seven combinations in 2024, most notably the glorious Houston Oilers throwbacks, but had several more permutations at their disposal. However the Oilers unis won\u2019t come out of the closet this season \u2013 yes, the Titans left Texas in 1997 and took their branding with them \u2013 and \u201cTitans Blue\u201d will become the primary home color (instead of navy). The whole thing is probably moot given a major redesign seems to be coming in 2026.\n28. New England Patriots (29)\nI\u2019d venture most NFL fans \u2013 and certainly those in the Boston market \u2013 would like to see them go back to \u201cPat Patriot\u201d full time and relegate the \u201cFlying Elvis\u201d logo to the Tom Brady era, though the slightly more understated contemporary version is preferable to the one TB12 wore. The Pats\u2019 \u201cRivalries\u201d unis have a chance to be distinctive given the wealth of American history that\u2019s occurred in the region.\n27. Jacksonville Jaguars (27)\nThough now well past that disastrous two-tone gold and black helmet, they suffer \u2013 to a lesser degree \u2013 from the same issues as the Panthers, whom the Jags entered the NFL with in 1995. Jacksonville had eight separate uniform combinations last season, adding a white helmet to their closet \u2026 for whatever reason. The addition of the \u201cProwler Throwbacks,\u201d a nod to the club\u2019s early years was nice. Suggestion: what might make the contemporary unis nicer would be a little feline spotting as part of the striping pattern.\n26. Arizona Cardinals (26)\nThey swung the pendulum from excessively busy uniforms to fairly boring ones two years ago \u2013 though low key is definitely the preferable side of that spectrum. Admittedly, there\u2019s only so much creative space when you\u2019re stuck with a non-threatening bird that subsists on insects and (non-playoff) seeds as your mascot \u2013 yet it\u2019s worth noting the St. Louis Cardinals have long been one of MLB\u2019s best-looking squads. Here\u2019s hoping the football Cards\u2019 \u201cRivalries\u201d look has some kind of nod to former DB Pat Tillman nearly a quarter-century after he played his final game for the club.\n25. Baltimore Ravens (28)\nI\u2019ve long contended they look like bruises \u2013 which is somehow apropos given the tough guy football identity this franchise has almost always had. And when you\u2019re mainly adorned in black and purple, that\u2019s going to happen. The Maryland flag baked into the shoulder crest remains the best detail. And give them credit for trying the \u201cPurple Rising\u201d look last season, which featured a forward-facing bird on the helmet. But meh.\n24. Atlanta Falcons (25)\nThey just about nailed it at their inception point in 1966 \u2013 uniforms that now serve as their throwbacks \u2013 featuring their best logo and the red, black, white and gold color combination that served as a dual tip of the cap to the University of Georgia and Georgia Tech. In later years, they tried silver pants and then black helmets \u2013 and it\u2019s fair to say anything Deion Sanders wore in his five-year stint (1989-1993), including the Jerry Glanville and MC Hammer days, would look awesome now. But the Falcons have been steadily degrading with a pair of ugly rebrands this century \u2013 though, thankfully, their gradient \u201cATL\u201d jerseys haven\u2019t been seen since 2022. Though, more amazingly, the team hasn\u2019t worn red ones of any kind since 2019. It\u2019s high time the Falcons got back to basics in a more permanent way.\n23. New York Giants (19)\nThankfully their 100th season is over \u2026 and we won't have to see those ancient throwbacks featuring Montreal Canadiens jerseys paired with khaki-colored pants, which they wore (just once) last season. Their 1980s retro uniform remains their best look, and the bland red-and-white roadies (which inexplicably lack any blue notes) remain problematic.\n22. Miami Dolphins (20)\nThe aqua and orange is distinctly South Florida, though the dolphin logo introduced in 2013 \u2013 time flies, right? \u2013 has never eclipsed its forebear, the aquatic mammal wearing the white helmet adorned with an orange \u201cM.\u201d Who knows what their \u201cRivalries\u201d look will entail, but I\u2019d venture something akin to a \u201cMiami Vice\u201d or \u201cVice City\u201d theme would be wicked. The current avatar on the Dolphins\u2019 X account provides reason to hope.\n21. Denver Broncos (24)\nThey retooled behind center in 2024 with the arrival of rookie QB Bo Nix and retooled their look, too. And while Nix was pretty much an unqualified success, the jury remains out on the unis \u2013 which are better than the previous iteration and attempt to incorporate Colorado charm, prevalent triangular \u201csummit markers\u201d on the jersey and back of helmet plus \u201c5280\u201d to reference the number of feet the Mile High City is above sea level. Another team determined to work a white helmet shell into its rotation, here\u2019s hoping the Broncos make more use of the 1977 \u201cOrange Crush\u201d throwbacks they rocked twice last season.\n20. Chicago Bears (21)\nClassic, traditional and lacking flash ... their fantastic suite of socks notwithstanding. The \u201cGSH\u201d on the sleeve has always been a nice touch honoring founder George Halas. The alternate orange helmets look like pumpkins but maybe they\u2019ll only appear half as bad now that they can be worn with the navy jerseys. More monochromatic combinations might help \u2013 Chicago hasn\u2019t gone white on white, which takes you back to Walter Payton\u2019s heyday, since 2009. And it would be especially nice if a team that likes to use the Michigan-esque throwbacks instead went with a white \"C\" on the helmet in a nod to the Halas-Butkus-Sayers days.\n19. Detroit Lions (18)\nThe altered number fonts and uniform striping last season were upgrades. And who\u2019s to say if the all-black alternates coach Dan Campbell wanted back helped the NFC North champs to a franchise record 15 regular-season wins? Shame, though, that they didn\u2019t keep the \u201cHonolulu Blue\u201d helmet with the throwback logo and Ford Mustang striping used to celebrate the club\u2019s 90th season in 2023. Gone, too, are the \u201cWCF\u201d initials on the sleeve that honored former owner William Clay Ford \u2013 perhaps apropos given he didn\u2019t win championships like Halas did.\n18. Buffalo Bills (17)\nNot sure how you responsibly incorporate \u201cMafia\u201d into the \u201cRivalries\u201d uniform, but Nike can doubtless figure it out. (And, please, don\u2019t be tempted by buffalo wings.) Still, some flair doesn\u2019t hurt here. The charging buffalo logo is nifty, yet it\u2019s a bummer that the AFL-era grazing buffalo hasn\u2019t made an appearance in four years. The Bills seem pretty content to wear their conservative blue jerseys and white pants (or the inverse) as often as possible.\n17. Green Bay Packers (11)\nOne of the league\u2019s oldest teams has remained pretty firmly rooted in tradition \u2013 rarely making changes to its classic look since the 1960s, when it was perhaps the greatest dynasty in NFL history. But the Pack has sported a nice green-over-green alternate since 2021 and introduced an all-white (helmet included) \u201cWinter Warning\u201d look in 2024. (Sigh.) Maybe the new throwbacks that are coming this year, per Sportslogos.net, will somehow spice things up a bit more \u2026 though spice isn\u2019t usually part of this brand\u2019s formula.\n16. Houston Texans (14)\nIt tracks that the NFL\u2019s youngest team \u2013 the Texans are entering their 24th season \u2013 is the only one to never change its primary helmet logo, the bull\u2019s head featuring the design of the Texas state flag an underrated one. And whether or not you liked the results, give Houston credit for taking a big swing last year by tweaking its primary home and road uniforms while rolling out two drastically reimagined alternates for their closet. Again, here\u2019s hoping the oh-so-sweet Oilers uniforms get returned to Houston at some point.\n15. Los Angeles Rams (22)\nWe owe them a debt as their iconic horns became the first logo to adorn an NFL helmet back in 1948 \u2013 and the modern iteration has settled in even if there was never much reason to mess with it. However the remainder of their present look is a mixed bag. The new-ish roadies have allowed the Rams to move away from the \u201cbone\u201d uniforms initially intended for that role \u2013 but LA only wore them twice in 2024. And the gradient jersey numbers on the blue home jerseys have got to go. Given the civic history, their \u201cRivalries\u201d look could go any number of ways \u2013 but hopefully it truly smacks of Los Angeles, as some of the Clippers\u2019 alternates have in recent years. And throwbacks would be nice, preferably navy jerseys and helmets with white ram horns. Do it for Deacon Jones.\n14. Kansas City Chiefs (15)\nThey\u2019ve long sported a classic look, crowned by the interlocking \u201cKC\u201d in the arrowhead helmet logo \u2026 and that\u2019s about it. And, hey, it\u2019s certainly been working for them in recent years, and it\u2019s not like it makes sense to wear their Dallas Texans uniforms from the 1960s. Their somewhat problematic team name also limits their creative space. Still, feels like there\u2019s some room for variance, but owner Clark Hunt hasn\u2019t been open to it. And, heck, maybe he\u2019s right. No one\u2019s begging for gold pants or jerseys here for the only team in the league without an alternate or throwback option.\n13. San Francisco 49ers (16)\nThey\u2019ve long sported a classic look, crowned by the interlocking \u201cSF\u201d in the helmet logo, and even their throwbacks tend not to deviate much. Even their black alternates have been mothballed since a three-year trial apparently ended following the 2017 season. (But at least San Francisco tries new things, so we'll give them the nod over the Chiefs ... for once.) Here\u2019s hoping the Niners are willing to go a little further afield with this year\u2019s \u201cRivalries\u201d unis \u2013 we\u2019d definitely be down for a helmet featuring the Golden Gate Bridge and/or Alcatraz \u2026 even if the team now lives in Silicon Valley (no microchips, please). However, they seem to be teasing some fundamental changes that pay homage to Northern California, 19th century western history and possibly more utilization of the gold palette and introduction of cream-colored elements.\n12. Dallas Cowboys (13)\nLove them or hate them, the league\u2019s most visible club sports an iconic, clean look. \u201cAmerica\u2019s Team\u201d has traditionally worn white at home for decades, legendary former team president Tex Schramm wanting his home fans to experience different color visuals provided by visiting teams wearing their traditional home jerseys. White also kept the Cowboys a bit cooler in Texas' heat. Personally, I always thought their dark blue jerseys looked better, but they also evidently bring bad luck \u2013 a theory floated long before the club\u2019s current three-decade Super Bowl drought. Their pair of alternate white helmets and throwback look has never been especially inspiring. The coolest thing the Cowboys do is add a red stripe to their helmet in recent years during the NFL\u2019s Salute to Service program, a touch used to honor the military, veterans and Medal of Honor winners. (Prior to 2021, the red stripe was only worn during the 1976 season, which coincided with America\u2019s bicentennial celebration.)\n11. Indianapolis Colts (12)\nIf ever there was a team that should just stick to its basic uniform, it might be this one \u2013 and the Colts, signature helmet horseshoe and all \u2013 have largely done exactly that. Even they seem to know it, breaking out their \u201cIndiana Nights\u201d alternates with the ugly black helmet just once each of the past two seasons \u2013 naturally for 1 p.m. ET kickoffs.\n10. New York Jets (10)\nThey finally (and wisely) adopted their 1980s look as their primary uniform last season \u2026 for all the good it did Aaron Rodgers and Co. Their Super Bowl 3 era throwbacks and all-black alternates with the black helmet are generally fine, if not home runs. Hard to say what Nike will draw upon when designing the Jets\u2019 \u201cRivalries\u201d look for this season, but there does seem to be an opportunity for some kind of exhilarating \u201cTop Gun\u201d type of treatment \u2013 especially given how staid the Giants tend to be \u2013 particularly given New York\u2019s annual Fleet Week celebration. A unique \u201cRivalries\u201d design for the helmet would mark the Jets\u2019 sixth different-looking crown over a three-season span.\n9. Minnesota Vikings (9)\nThe horns they\u2019ve sported on their helmets since the franchise\u2019s inaugural season in 1961 have long been one of the league\u2019s slickest logos. Their current uniform has another nice Norse touch with the sleeve stripes that evoke the image of a Viking longboat. The club further embraced its Scandinavian \u2013 which is to say local \u2013 heritage be debuting its all-white \u201cWinter Warrior\u201d duds in 2024, a nice way to imply snow given the Vikings have rarely played outdoor home games since vacating Metropolitan Stadium after the 1981 season.\n8. Cincinnati Bengals (8)\nThey earned beaucoup points (and their first Super Bowl berth) in 1981 when they stopped looking like Browns knock-offs \u2013 gross \u2013 and literally changed their stripes. They\u2019ve unnecessarily monkeyed with the jerseys and pants over the years and last season\u2019s monochrome orange debut \u2026 nah. But the primary uniform is in a good place, and the white tiger alternates are as good as anyone\u2019s \u2013 though that helmet doesn\u2019t actually need to suddenly be mixed into other combinations.\n7. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (7)\nOne must be careful before conferring too much credit on the 1970s and \u201880s Bucs \u2013 remember, starting in 1976, this was an organization that lost its first 26 games. But if you were a kid who grew up drawing NFL logos when you got bored in class, then you know \u201cBucco Bruce\u201d had some swag and offered a much more satisfying challenge than the Bears or Packers, for examples, offered up. And the \u201cFlorida Orange,\u201d aka \u201cCreamsicle,\u201d brought a unique dash to the league, even if you wouldn\u2019t be caught dead in it. After an absence of more than a decade due to since-relaxed helmet rules, the Creamsicles have been back since 2023, and the original road version is returning this season, the club's 50th. Yet the less-celebrated aspect of the Buccaneers is that they, like their expansion brethren Seahawks, have evolved so nicely over the years \u2212 the digital alarm clock number fonts and messy unis worn from 2014-19 the notable exception. If only the Panthers and Jags, who appeared two decades later, could say the same.\n6. Seattle Seahawks (5)\nI\u2019ve long considered them the recipients of Nike\u2019s best rebrand \u2013 and (coincidentally or not) the \u2018Hawks have basically been a near-perennial contender since debuting their current look in 2012. And, given the franchise\u2019s relative youth \u2013 Seattle is also about to embark on its 50th season \u2013 why not be something akin to the NFL version of the University of Oregon? And even if you don\u2019t like the updated osprey totem logo or feathers on the pants, collars and subtly tapering down the centerline of the helmet, almost everyone can agree that the return of the Seahawks\u2019 original uniforms \u2013 largely at the expense of their highlighter green alternates \u2013 is another huge win. The white roadies the team wore for most of the 1980s and \u201890s are also returning in 2025, per SportsLogos.net. And don\u2019t be surprised if their \u201cRivalries\u201d presentation \u2013 whether it includes the Space Needle, coffee beans, Sasquatch, the Pacific Northwest wilderness, a Pearl Jam tribute or whatever else \u2013 is likely to be bold and maybe polarizing, which is just fine for this kind of uniform treatment. (But let\u2019s not bring back the mess of blue-ish hues the team used when it first moved into Lumen Field in 2002.)\n5. New Orleans Saints (4)\nThey\u2019ve got all the ingredients. Few colors are better paired than black and gold, though the deeper \u201cOld Gold\u201d the team favored in yesteryear might be a touch preferable to the lighter, contemporary shade. Few teams can boast a logo better civically intertwined than the Saints\u2019 fleur-de-lis, which looks especially cool running down the center of the club\u2019s alternate black helms. And those lids might look even better atop what could be all-black monochromatic looks this season. And entering the repertoire Wednesday is an alternate white helmet with the logo and gold and something akin to a vanilla ice cream pattern on a shell adorned in black flecks. But I still think what the Saints should do is develop one starkly different uniform from what\u2019s already in their closet \u2013 namely a version with a purple, green, and gold scheme as a nod to Mardi Gras. Honestly, why has it taken this long?\n4. Philadelphia Eagles (6)\nThe return of their classic \u201cKelly Green\u201d and silver uniforms as throwbacks two years ago was long overdue, their absence forced by the league\u2019s formerly restrictive rules and then the extra time Nike needed to replicate the look once it was reinstated. And while some of the team\u2019s fans would probably like to see the (not Chip) Kelly look restored as the primary one, the \u201cMidnight Green\u201d threads the team has mainly worn since 1996 are not only underrated but now inextricably linked with the most successful era in club history \u2013 three Super Bowl trips and two titles over the past eight seasons. Winning almost always, ahem, looks better. The black helmet the team occasionally uses seems extraneous, particularly given how dark their typical helmets already are.\n3. Pittsburgh Steelers (3)\nSorry, Saints, but no team is more seamlessly linked to its hometown than the Steelers. Black and gold, also worn by Major League Baseball\u2019s Pirates and the NHL\u2019s Penguins, is inescapable throughout the \u2018Burgh, where even the bridges are gold. And the Steelmark symbol used by the American Iron and Steel Institute with the trio of hypocycloids on the right side of the helmet is identifiable to both the team and city. The Steelers\u2019 Dark Knight Color Rush always looks sharp. They will also debut a new throwback for their October 26 game \u2212 too cold for bumblebees \u2212 against new QB Aaron Rodgers\u2019 former team, the Packers. (But what's up with the practice jerseys, guys?)\n2. Las Vegas Raiders (T1)\nThe colors, the logo, the clean simplicity of the pants and jersey \u2013 it\u2019s close to a perfect football uniform. The Silver and Black\u2019s only sartorial sin remain not embracing their inner (and outer) Darth Vader. Why can\u2019t we see the helmets and pants go primarily black with silver trim to complete a seriously menacing look? It\u2019d be a serious commitment to football fashion excellence.\n1. Los Angeles Chargers (T1)\nThe colors, the logo, the suite of combinations \u2212 including three new variations for the 2025 season \u2013 it\u2019s close to a perfect football uniform. The Bolts\u2019 only sartorial sin of late has been their reliance on white helmets while changing up the color of the lightning emblem depending on whether they\u2019re wearing white, \u201cPowder Blue,\u201d navy or royal. Personally, I prefer the Junior Seau-era navy helmets with white lightning, which are now back \u2013 and it\u2019s worth noting the Chargers were 0-6 in their now-retired navy Color Rush. Others might like a return of the royal dome and gold bolt honoring the Air Coryell teams, though the team will do that with an all-gold look in the interim. Overall, a team that\u2019s become increasingly watchable is now more fun to look at, too.\nAll NFL news on and off the field. Sign up for USA TODAY's 4th and Monday newsletter."

      "text": "Minnesota Vikings unveil 'Winter Warrior' alternate uniforms as 'coldest uniform' in NFL\nWinter is coming \u2026 though it remains to be seen if the Minnesota Vikings will be kings in the north in 2024.\nRegardless, the Vikes became the latest team to unveil an alternate uniform, Thursday's rollout coming with a bit of a \"Game of Thrones\" vibe for the club's icy \"Winter Warrior\" look.\nThe unis will feature a white helmet with silver stripe, both firsts in the franchise's 63-year history. A silver stripe also adorns the legs of the pants. Gold has been stripped from this version. The number font includes \"dripping icicle serifs\" and the neckline has a new \"Nordic knot\" as part of a presentation the team deems the \"coldest uniform in the league.\" Per the club, the knot \"includes three shields as a nod to Head Coach Kevin O\u2019Connell\u2019s mantra: 'Our Way. Our Team. Our Process.'\"\n\"This uniform celebrates Minnesota and Nordic Vikings,\" said Jackie Ramacher, the Vikings' art manager.\n\"Minnesotans are battle tested, resilient and tough. We are not only bonded by our harsh, cold winters, but we embrace them, so it\u2019s fitting that the Vikings wear the coldest uniforms in the NFL.\"\n2024 NFL uniform power rankings: Jets make a jump\nMinnesota began wearing white jerseys and white pants (with the traditional purple helmets) in 2022 as part of a \"Winter Whiteout\" theme, much to the fans' glee. Now, they've become the latest team to capitalize on the league's relaxed uniform standards, which allow for multiple helmets and alternate themes.\nThe change coincides with an organization in transition following the departure of quarterback Kirk Cousins and arrival of presumed replacement J.J. McCarthy in the draft.\nThe \"Winter Warrior\" uniforms debut Dec. 16, a \"Monday Night Football\" contest when the Vikings will host the NFC North rival Chicago Bears. Per league rules, it can also be worn a second time this season.\n***\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on X, formerly Twitter @ByNateDavis."

      "text": "A massive haboob hits Phoenix, leaving the city dusty and dark. Then came a monsoon.\nA giant cloud of dust known as a haboob swallowed up the Phoenix area and was quickly followed by a monsoon that left thousands without power and flights grounded the evening of Aug. 25.\nPhotos and videos of the haboob, a huge dust storm caused by strong winds from a thunderstorm, show the cloud consuming homes as it moved over Phoenix and surrounding areas. The dust darkened the sky in an almost apocalyptic scene.\nA monsoon storm followed the wall of dust and knocked the power out for thousands of people in Arizona, according to the Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network. Flights were also delayed, and the storm caused damage to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.\nHere's what to know.\nWhere did the storm hit?\nThe monsoon hit San Tan Valley, Arizona, which is located about 47 miles southeast of Phoenix, at 5 p.m. local time. It reached downtown Phoenix within the hour.\nWorkers ending their days in downtown Phoenix shrieked in a mix of delight and fright as they ran for the cover of parking structures as winds whipped debris across wet streets, the Republic reported.\nFlood advisories and downed branches\nVideo shows street signs trembling from the wind as the storm picked up debris and flung it around the streets in Phoenix.\nDowned branches also littered sidewalks, and a flood advisory was issued.\nThousands knocked into darkness\nAbout 41,000 customers of the Arizona utility company Salt River Project were left without power after the storm, and an additional 7,400 Arizona Public Service customers experienced an outage, the Republic reported.\nThe majority of people in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, had their power restored by the morning after the storm, according to USA TODAY power outage data.\nStorm disrupted travel at Phoenix airport\nOperations were halted at Phoenix Sky Harbor, where 104 flights were delayed and three flights were canceled, according to the airport's website.\nThe storm caused leaks and damage at the airport, and crews were assessing the damage.\nOperations at the airport have since been resumed.\nWhat is a haboob dust storm?\nA haboob is an incredibly strong dust and sand storm that moves through hot and dry regions and is commonly found in the Sahara desert, the Arabian Peninsula, North Africa and the Gulf of Guinea, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nThe storms can also crop up in the Southwestern United States in states including Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. They form when a traveling thunderstorm cell causes air to be forced down and pushed forward, dragging with it dust and debris and creating a blowing wall as high as 10,000 feet.\nHaboobs can arrive suddenly, reducing visibility to zero with the wall of dust that can be miles long. They can last a few minutes or up to a few hours.\n\"Blinding, choking dust can quickly reduce visibility, causing accidents that may involve chain collisions, creating massive pileups,\" the National Weather Service said.\nHaboob is derived from the Arabic language, in which the word haab means wind or blow.\nContributing: Julie Mendes, Hayleigh Evans, Jose R.
