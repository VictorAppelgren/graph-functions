  "title": "At Alaska summit, Trump has one play for Ukraine peace: Call Putin\u2019s bluff",
  "description": "It\u2019s time to end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine \u2014 with a Trumpian update on Ronald Reagan\u2019s doctrine of peace through strength.",
  "content": "The upcoming Alaska summit between Presidents Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin is another sleight-of-hand victory for the Russian dictator \u2014 but when they sit down at the negotiating table Friday, it\u2019s Trump who holds the cards.\n\nWith Trump\u2019s peace deadline imminent, Putin promised a summit, seemingly avoiding any consequences for yet again ignoring a US timeline.\n\nExpect Putin to flatter Trump at every opportunity, while repeating his oft-cited lies about Ukraine\u2019s history and his canard that Russia was forced into his \u201cspecial military operation.\u201d\n\nPutin never lets facts stand in his way.\n\nHe will reportedly offer Trump a \u201ccease-fire\u201d in exchange for a portion of eastern Ukraine and global recognition of Russia\u2019s territorial claims.\n\nFor an expert negotiator like Trump, this should be a non-starter.\n\nFirst, after more than three years of fighting Russia does not control all of eastern Ukraine \u2014 and in the past two years of non-stop, full-scale offensive warfare Moscow has gained less than 2% of Ukraine\u2019s overall territory.\n\nAgreeing to his territorial demands would hand Putin his biggest victory of the war.\n\nSecond, as President Volodymyr Zelensky has made clear, most Ukrainians oppose huge territorial concessions, and his nation\u2019s constitution prohibits him from agreeing to such a proposal without a national referendum.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian economy and military are buckling under the strain of the war \u2014 and the nation simply cannot continue fighting at this pace for much longer.\n\nThe conflict has dramatically accelerated Russia\u2019s demographic disaster, with more than 2 million Russians dead, wounded or fleeing the country.\n\nIn short, Putin cannot afford to continue this war militarily, economically or demographically, putting him in an extremely weak negotiating position.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a larger reason for Trump to be wary of falling for Putin\u2019s cease-fire trap: Such an agreement only works if both sides honor it.\n\nPutin says Russia will adopt a law barring future attacks on Ukraine in the event of a deal. But Putin broke numerous international laws and treaties when he attacked Ukraine in the first place.\n\nThe rule of law does not exist in Russia today. Putin is the only law.\n\nBut while Putin\u2019s quarter-century in power shows without question that he cannot be trusted \u2014 ever \u2014 he also knows he cannot continue his invasion.\n\nSo when he finally meets with Trump, after rejecting all peace proposals for the last six months, he\u2019s going to turn on the charm.\n\nEvery American president for the past 25 years has initially been snookered by Putin\u2019s act, believing they could trust him and hoping for the best.\n\nMy former boss, President George W. Bush, famously looked into Putin\u2019s eyes and thought he saw a man he could work with.\n\nPresident Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declared a \u201creset\u201d of Russian-American relations.\n\nBut all of them eventually realized that Putin is a murderous thug running a mafia state, opposed to almost everything we value \u2014 including democracy and our basic freedoms of speech, the press, assembly and religion.\n\nEven Russia\u2019s closest allies have learned they cannot trust the autocrat. In recent months, when the brutal dictator of Syria and Iran\u2019s ayatollahs pleaded with Putin for military assistance, Putin said \u201cNyet.\u201d\n\nHe had used their regimes for decades to make trouble for the United States and our allies. But he abandoned them both, given the weakness of his Ukraine position.\n\nWe in the West cannot delude ourselves. Vladimir Putin does not care about us or our values.\n\nHe wants only to fulfill his self-appointed destiny: to reunify \u201cGreater Russia\u201d \u2014 and Ukraine is the next step in his quest.\n\nWe need to believe what Putin says about himself and his chosen aims, not the short-term promises he may make to buy time for his grandiose mission.\n\nTrump, the master negotiator, needs to call Putin\u2019s bluff.\n\nRussia\u2019s economy and population are declining rapidly. Its military has lost over a million soldiers killed or wounded, over 4,000 tanks and almost 300 military aircraft.\n\nTrump can use Putin\u2019s weak position to bring lasting peace to Ukraine by imposing a deal with real security guarantees.\n\nPutin has never attacked a NATO nation \u2014 and with good reason.\n\nGive Ukraine NATO security guarantees, impose a cease-fire with NATO boots on the ground, and the carnage will end.\n\nIt\u2019s time to end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine \u2014 with a Trumpian update on Ronald Reagan\u2019s doctrine of peace through strength.\n\nGregory W. Slayton is a former senior US diplomat, chairman of Slayton Capital and author of \u201cPortraits of Ukraine a Nation at War.\u201d",

DISPUTE RESOLUTION, AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE, AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (\u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d) CAREFULLY. THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A LAWSUIT IN COURT.\n19.1 APPLICABILITY OF ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. You agree to the following dispute resolution provisions of this Section 19 with respect to any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Services, to any Services sold or distributed through the Website, or to any aspect of your relationship with the Company (\u201cDispute\u201d) and any lawsuit, arbitration or other proceeding that may\narise out of such Dispute (each, an \u201cAction\u201d).\nThe terms of Section 19 apply to all Disputes, even if the actions or relationship giving rise to such Disputes occurred prior to this version of the Terms (or such modification). However, these Dispute Resolution terms do not apply to any Dispute as to which you have personally initiated a lawsuit or arbitration prior to agreeing to these Terms.\nEach provision of this Section 19 applies to the maximum extent permitted by law.\nCovered Disputes. If you live in the United States, any Dispute between You and the Company (collectively, the \u201cParties\u201d) is a Covered Dispute, with the following exceptions: (1) to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate our intellectual property rights, our suit to enforce such intellectual property rights including by injunction; or (2) any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000.\nIf a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users (as described in Sec 19.3 below) apply. If there is any dispute between the Parties as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, that dispute shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\n19.2 DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS APPLICABLE TO ALL USERS\nCLASS ACTION AND JURY WAIVER. THE PARTIES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION IN ANY DISPUTE. EACH PARTY MAY PROCEED AS TO ANY DISPUTE ONLY IN THAT PARTY\u2019S INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION, MASS ACTION, GROUP ACTION, REPRESENTATIVE ACTION, AND/OR COLLECTIVE ACTION.\nApplicable Law. These Terms and your use of the Services are governed by, construed and enforced in accordance with the internal substantive laws of the State of New York, United States, regardless of the State\u2019s conflict of laws provisions. However, any question as to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute (as defined above) and/or whether a Dispute is subject to the Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is to be decided by applying the provisions of the Federal Arbitration Act, Title 9 of the U.S. Code (\u201cFAA\u201d).\nChoice of Venue. For any Action allowed to proceed in court (including but not limited to any claim that involves an amount in controversy that is equal to or greater than $75,000, any claim related to whether a Dispute is a Covered Dispute, or any suit to enforce our intellectual property rights including by injunction), or to enforce the terms of this Agreement, the Parties agree to exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue in the state or federal courts located in the County of New York.\nInformal Dispute Resolution Required. Before initiating an Arbitration (as defined below) or any other type of Action or adversary proceeding, the Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to settle any Covered Dispute (as defined above) directly through consultation and good faith negotiations according to the following process (\u201cInformal Dispute Resolution Process\u201d), which shall be a precondition to either Party initiating an Arbitration.\n| i. | If you have a Covered Dispute with us, you must send an individualized, written notice describing the Covered Dispute to us to NYP Holdings, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 1211 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10036. If we have a Covered Dispute with you, we will send a written notice to you using the contact information we have for you. |\n| ii. | Promptly following receipt of such notice, we will personally meet, via telephone or videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to resolve informally any Covered Dispute covered by this Agreement. |\n| iii. | If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference personally. Likewise, if we are represented by counsel, our counsel may participate in the conference as well, but we agree to have a company representative fully participate in the conference. |\n| iv. | The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the Parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Process required by this paragraph. |\n| v. | If the Covered Dispute is not resolved within 60 days of the opposing Party receiving the notice, then either you or we may proceed in accordance with the below Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions. |\n| vi. | Failure to complete the Informal Dispute Resolution Process is grounds for dismissal of any Arbitration (as defined below) and the Party initiating such Action will be required to pay any reasonable costs and fees of the other Party. |\n19.3 MANDATORY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISIONS FOR U.S. USERS\n| i. | Agreement to Arbitrate Covered Disputes. Any Covered Dispute that the parties cannot resolve through the Informal Dispute Resolution Process (as defined above) must be brought on an individual basis and will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration (\u201cArbitration\u201d) before an arbitrator mutually selected by the Parties (the \u201cArbitrator\u201d). The Arbitrator must have experience with the subject matter of the Dispute, and be a former federal or state court judge. The Parties intend the FAA to apply to ensure enforcement of these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users. Your agreement to these Mandatory Dispute Resolution Provisions for U.S. Users is material to Company offering the Services, as Company could not offer the Services for free or at the price charged without the cost savings provided thereby |\n| ii. | Arbitrator Selection. The parties will meet and confer in good faith to select an arbitrator. For purposes of this Section, good-faith meet-and- confer efforts require that each party propose at least three arbitrators who meet the qualifications described in these Terms. If, after 60 days of good faith meet and confer efforts, the Parties are unable to agree on an arbitrator, either Party may petition the state or federal courts located in the County of New York to appoint an arbitrator meeting the requirements herein from the arbitrators proposed by the parties. |\n| iii. | Rules Selection. The Arbitration shall be administered pursuant to JAMS\u2019 Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures or other comparable rules to which the parties agree. The selection of JAMS rules does not mean that JAMS will administer the Arbitration or appoint the Arbitrator. |\n| iv. | Conduct of Arbitration. The Arbitration shall be conducted via electronic or telephonic means. If the Party seeking Arbitration fails to appear at the administrative conference regardless of whether such Party\u2019s counsel attends, the Arbitrator will administratively close the Arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless such Party shows good cause as to why they were not able to attend the conference. |\n| v. | Arbitration Costs. If the Arbitrator finds that the costs and fees of an Arbitration you initiate will be prohibitive for you as compared to the costs of litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the Arbitration as the Arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the Arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the Arbitration, unless the Arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. If we initiate an Arbitration against you, we will pay all costs associated with the Arbitration (other than your attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses unless permitted to be recovered under the arbitration rules or applicable law). |\n| vi. | No Opt Out Rights. You do not have the right to opt out of the Dispute Resolution section. Rather, your sole remedy if you do not accept these Terms of Use (including this Dispute Resolution section) is to stop using the Services. |\n| vii. | Company Right To Terminate Mandatory Dispute Resolution Program. At any time, Company may terminate its agreement to Section 19.3. That termination will not affect any Action that has already been initiated. |\n| viii. | Arbitration Agreement Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Company. |\n20. Miscellaneous. These Terms contains the entire understanding and agreement between you and Company concerning the Services and supersedes any and all prior or inconsistent understandings relating to the Services and your use thereof. These Terms cannot be changed orally, nor may these Terms be modified except as expressly authorized in these Terms. If any provision of these Terms is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, this shall not affect any other provisions and these Terms shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to make it legal, valid and enforceable. Any provision that must survive in order to allow us to enforce its meaning shall survive the termination of these Terms. The failure of Company to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.\n21.

      "text": "Russia won\u2019t be able to afford troops in Ukraine past 2026 as economy struggles, experts say\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Russia could be forced to end the war in Ukraine because it will run out of money to pay its troops, according to experts at the DC-based Institute for the Study of War.\nThe country has burned through roughly half of its $106 billion liquid sovereign-wealth fund, which is used to pay troops\u2019 salaries and new recruits bonuses, experts said.\nMoscow can likely only afford another 12 to 16 months of fighting at its current pace, with about 30,000 to 45,000 Russian troops killed or injured in Ukraine each month since its 2022 invasion began, ISW\u2019s Russia team lead George Barros told The Post.\n\u201cThe system for generating fighters worked for 2.5 years but it\u2019s starting to fail,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cRussia is constrained by the laws of economics, scarce resources, and there isn\u2019t an endless manpower resource in Russia.\u201d\nThe Kremlin\u2019s cash has dwindled as troop salaries and recruiting bonuses balloon amid staggering inflation, according to Russian Finance Ministry data.\nEven President Trump weighed in on Moscow\u2019s prospects Friday, noting in a Truth Social post that \u201cRussia has to get moving\u201d on ending its war because \u201ctoo many people (are) DYING, thousands a week.\u201d\nThat reality could create an opening for the US to push Russian President Vladimir Putin harder for a peace deal. Putin has been stalling negotiations after rejecting Trump\u2019s full cease-fire proposal \u2014 a deal Ukraine already agreed to \u2014 a month ago.\n\u201cThe United States can use the enormous challenges Russia will face in 2025 as leverage to secure critical concessions in ongoing negotiations to end the war by continuing and even expanding military support to Ukraine,\u201d ISW\u2019s Christina Harward wrote in a recent report.\nReluctant fighters\nFaced with a nation of reluctant warriors, Russia has had to pile on the signing bonuses for new recruits so much that, \u201cIt seems to us that the Russians are not going to be able to recruit [enough] replacements per month,\u201d Barros said.\n\u201cThey\u2019re either going to have to up the prices to go after that shrinking demographic [of untapped troops] or the money is going to be a constraint, at which point it will have to face hard decisions about doing another round of mobilization.\u201d\nAs the war drags on, Moscow has been forced to offer increasingly higher incentive bonuses to attract new troops despite inflation rates in Russia of more than 10%, roughly four times higher than that of the US.\n\u201cRussia\u2019s protracted war and high losses on the battlefield are already causing major economic issues in Russia, and these economic problems will likely mature within another 12 to 18 months,\u201d Harward wrote in the ISW report.\nThough Russia has other areas from which they can pull funding for its war aside from its dwindling sovereign wealth fund, it is the easiest place to find quick cash to finance the conflict, Barros said. Plus, \u201cit would be a massive embarrassment\u201d if Moscow depletes \u201cthis nest egg that they built for two decades,\u201d possibly risking Russia\u2019s domestic support for Putin and his war.\nThe general reluctance of Russians to join the fight is only fueling the economic bleed.\nFor example, the country\u2019s Samara region in January offered a record $40,000 to join high-risk assault squads in Ukraine that reportedly have a survival rate of 1 in 20 soldiers, the independent investigative news website Vyorstka wrote at the time.\nSuch dramatic recruitment campaigns \u201csuggest that the Russian recruitment rate has been declining\u201d as sign-up rates slow \u2014 and casualty rates soar, according to the ISW report.\n\u201cRussia\u2019s current reported monthly recruitment rate is either just equal to or just below the quantity needed to replace Russia\u2019s monthly casualty rate one-to-one,\u201d Harward wrote.\nBut that rate is likely even lower, as Russia lost more than 48,000 troops both in December and in January, according to the latest data, while Russian Security Council Deputy Chairman Dmitry Medvedev claimed in late December that Moscow recruited an average of 36,600 new recruits per month in 2024.\nSoaring casualties\nMoscow is currently suffering upwards of 1,200 casualties per day, a rate that began to increase late last year \u201cas Russian forces made gradual, creeping advances in eastern Ukraine,\u201d according to the ISW report.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine \u2014 which relies on modern, live-preserving military technology instead of Russia\u2019s soviet-era systems \u2014 has a loss rate of roughly one casualty per four Russian losses.\nEven if Russia somehow manages to find the funds to continue boosting recruitment bonuses and troop salaries, \u201cever greater financial incentives in the future are unlikely to dramatically increase recruitment,\u201d according to the report.\nThe Post in March interviewed dozens of Russian troops captured by Ukrainians who said they enlisted in the military for the money \u2014 with very few having mentioned joining out of a sincere patriotic duty \u2014 and none could communicate a reason or need for the war.\nAnother indicator is Moscow\u2019s increasing reliance on recruiting foreign troops, as North Korea sent up to 12,000 soldiers to fight late last year and intends to send another roughly 4,000. And Ukraine also discovered, this week, that more than 150 Chinese citizens are serving in the Russian military.\nBut it\u2019s nearly not enough as the total sent by North Korea would only \u201coffset nine to 12 days of theater-wide Russian losses at current rates,\u201d according to ISW.\nTaking advantage\nMoscow\u2019s economic crunch presents a prime opportunity for the US to pressure Russia into finally complying with Trump\u2019s push for peace. That can be done through continued military aid to Ukraine as long as Putin continues to delay cease-fire efforts, so Kyiv can keep up its campaign that is wiping out Russian troops at unsustainable levels.\n\u201cUkraine \u2014 with Western aid \u2014 can accelerate the timeline on which Putin feels the strain on the Russian economy and military, forcing Putin to face hard choices sooner than he would like,\u201d Harward wrote.\n\u201cThe United States should call Putin\u2019s bluff and force him to pay the costs of the war for which he has mortgaged Russia\u2019s future.\u201d\nRussia is currently banking on the assumption that the US will not provide further military aid to Ukraine, Barros said. Without continued aid, Moscow\u2019s untenable casualty rates will reduce, and allow it to keep up its war even longer.\n\u201cThe center of gravity for this war is the continued international support for Ukraine,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be a military solution to the conflict \u2014 it just depends on, will it be a Russian victory in some form, or Ukrainian victory in some form?\u201d\nWith time and resources not in Russia\u2019s favor though, Barros further warned the White House against cutting a quick deal over an optimal one with Moscow.\n\u201cTrump can extract them the best deal if he lightens up a little bit on the timeline that he imposed on himself (of ending the war within 100 days of inauguration.) \u2026 There\u2019s really no reason why you couldn\u2019t say, \u2018We\u2019re going to end this thing, but we\u2019re going to end it on the maximum, best terms\u2019 \u2014 and that includes letting Russia mature in the vice they put themselves.\u201d"

      "text": "Nuclear winter would bring mass starvation and death for years post-war, startling new study reveals: \u2018We must be prepared\u2019\nIt would be a-crop-alyptic.\nAmid rising tensions around the world, Penn State University scientists have revealed what the fallout would be from a nuclear war \u2014 with an unfathomable famine, mass deaths and a particular impact on an important crop after the bombs went off.\nAccording to the dystopian study, published in the journal Environmental Research Letters, the destruction would \u201cextend well beyond the blast zones\u201d because of nuclear winter, a catastrophic theoretical scenario in the wake of a nuke conflict.\n\u201cNuclear wars would cause an unfathomable loss of life and genetic resources, but also a prolonged nuclear winter that would reduce agricultural area and productivity for years,\u201d the team wrote.\nDuring this apocalyptic aftermath, smoke and soot from the firestorms would blot out the sun, causing global cooling that would devastate agriculture worldwide, per a release from Penn State. This could last for more than a decade, leading to widespread famine among the survivors of the initial conflict.\nTo determine the exact extent of this devastation, the research team simulated the effects of nuclear winter on the global production of corn \u2014 the most widely grown grain crop in the world.\n\u201cWe simulated corn production in 38,572 locations under the six nuclear war scenarios of increasing severity \u2013 with soot injections ranging from 5 million to 165 million tons,\u201d explained Yuning Shi, a plant scientist and meteorologist at the university. The team conducted six simulations in total.\nThe team found that a full-scale nuclear war would send a frightening 165 million tons of soot into the atmosphere, prompting an 80% plunge in corn yields per year.\nEven a regional nuclear war, which would launch just 5.5 million tons of soot sky-high, would still cause the worldwide corn output to dip by 7%.\nIn addition to shooting soot into the air, nuclear war would also trigger a spike in UV-B radiation \u2014 a type of ultraviolet radiation that, among other effects, can mitigate photosynthesis in plants \u2014 by disabling the ozone\u2019s ability to shield the amount of radiation the Earth receives from the sun.\n\u201cThe blast and fireball of atomic explosions produce nitrogen oxides in the stratosphere,\u201d explained Shi. \u201cThe presence of both nitrogen oxides and heating from absorptive soot could rapidly destroy ozone, increasing UV-B radiation levels at the Earth\u2019s surface. This would damage plant tissue and further limit global food production.\u201d\nThis radiation would peak around six to seven years following a nuclear conflict, reducing corn yields by another 7% and bringing out a food crisis of global proportions.\n\u201c\u2018As the climate recovers, high UV\u2013B radiation could further damage crops, with effects manifesting years after the nuclear conflict,\u201d the team wrote.\nDepending on the severity of the war, it could reportedly take between seven and 12 years for global corn production to rebound to pre-apocalyptic levels.\nFortunately, humans can help accelerate the recovery by planting hardy crops that can grow under colder conditions and during shorter growing seasons.\nThe researchers estimated that this could boost global crop production by 10% compared to using less-resistant strains \u2014although they noted that limited seed availability could result in a \u201cbottleneck to adaptation.\u201d\nThe best way to facilitate a regrowth, per the team, would be to plan ahead by compiling \u201cagricultural resilience kits\u201d that contain these specialized seeds before the apocalypse hits.\n\u201cThese kits would help sustain food production during the unstable years following a nuclear war, while supply chains and infrastructure recover,\u201d said Armen Kemanian, who spearheaded the development of these scary simulations. \u201cThe agricultural resilience kits concept can be expanded to other disasters \u2013 when catastrophes of these magnitude strike, resilience is of the essence.\u201d\n\u201cIf we want to survive, we must be prepared, even for unthinkable consequences,\u201d said Shi, per the Daily Mail.\nThis study comes as experts warn that a nuclear threat could be looming. In May, Pakistan Defense Minister Khawaja Asif cautioned nuclear war threat was \u201cclear and present\u201d in light of escalating tensions with India.\nOn Aug. 1, President Donald Trump announced that he had ordered two nuclear submarines moved closer to Russia in response to \u201chighly provocative statements\u201d by Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia, amid the nation\u2019s ongoing conflict with Ukraine.\nTrump plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska on Friday, Aug. 15.\nIn June, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard warned of a potential \u201cnuclear holocaust\u201d caused by increasingly volatile international politics.\n\u201cThis is the reality of what\u2019s at stake, what we are facing now,\u201d Gabbard said in a controversial video posted following the politician\u2019s recent visit to Hiroshima, Japan, which was destroyed in an atomic attack in 1945. \u201cBecause as we stand here today, closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever before, political elite warmongers are carelessly fomenting fear and tensions between nuclear powers.\u201d"

      "text": "Considering Russian President Vladimir Putin was only using the 50-day deadline as an excuse to unleash more destruction on Ukraine, President Trump is right to shorten it to a little over a week.\nTrump is also correct that, if Putin doesn\u2019t agree to peace, sanctions can deal as strong a blow against Russia as missiles.\nDespite the claims of Russia apologists, the war is bringing the country to its knees. Signs point to an economic catastrophe in the next 12 to 18 months.\nEven senior Russian officials are issuing stark warnings. Russia\u2019s Minister for Economic Development Maxim Reshetnikov recently warned that Russia faces recession.\nBut the reality is far worse. With the official inflation rate above 10% per year and the real inflation rate double that, prices of basic goods like potatoes, a staple for Russian families, are up three to four times since the Russian invasion in February 2022.\nGovernment spending on defense is officially over 40% of the national budget and in reality more like 50% \u2014 crowding out on education, infrastructure and health care.\nWhile war spending has propped up the economy in the short term, in the long term it is burning billions of rubles in an ever-deepening pit: There is no benefit whatsoever to the average Russian consumer.\nGovernment tax revenues are falling due primarily to lower prices for Russian oil and natural gas, as well as the widespread destruction of key infrastructure such as refineries by Ukrainian drones.\nRussia\u2019s National Wealth Fund, which has been used to help underwrite the war, is estimated to have fallen from over $110 billion in early 2022 to just over $30 billion today. Swedish economist Anders Aslund, a former fellow at the Atlantic Council, believes the fund will be out of money by year\u2019s end.\nMeanwhile, international sanctions have made everything from aircraft parts to computer chips much more costly and hard to find outside the black market. Without China\u2019s supply of massive quantities of dual-use technologies, both Russian industry and the Russian military would be paralyzed today.\nThe Russian invasion also accelerated the biggest long-term driver of Russia\u2019s economic downturn: an ongoing demographic disaster. According to official statistics, which are almost certainly underestimates, Russia lost almost 600,000 people in 2024 and deaths now outnumber births by 5 to 3.\nBy 2030, the country is projected to face a labor shortage of 11 million people.\nThese dynamics have the Russian economy hurtling toward economic meltdown. Personal and commercial indebtedness are at all-time highs. A surge in consumer and business loan defaults has caused three of Russia\u2019s largest banks to recently request government bailouts, with more such requests coming.\nACRA, a Russian credit rating agency, warns that as much as 20% of the loans on the books of Russian banks will be nonperforming by the end of this year, with the problem growing significantly worse in 2026.\nEntire industries, especially those outside the military-industrial base, face widespread bankruptcies. Russia\u2019s Deputy Energy Minister Dmitry Islamov stated recently that over 25% of Russia\u2019s coal companies are insolvent, with many more facing forced consolidation.\nUnsurprisingly, the tourism industry has been devastated, with a 95% reduction in foreign tourists since 2022.\nAlso, Russia\u2019s factories are being converted from consumer goods such as cars and washing machines to produce drones or tanks. These conversions are expensive and often ineffective. They also gut the future of Russia\u2019s non-military industrial base.\nRussia\u2019s semiconductor industry, years behind the West even before the invasion, is also now in dire straits. The outmigration of more than 1 million young people since February 2022, many well-educated professionals in the technology sector, has had an enormous impact.\nNow the very real threat of 500% US tariffs on countries that support Russia\u2019s war effort (such as China and India, which together buy more than 80% of Russian crude oil exports) may push the Russian economy over the edge.\nThe Russian Tariff Bill has 85 Senate co-sponsors and a solid bipartisan majority in the House.\nIf Putin rejects Trump\u2019s 10- to 12-day deadline, as he has every other ultimatum, signing the Russian Tariff Bill into law is the single best thing Trump could do to bring peace to Ukraine\nIt will force Putin into a binary decision: Make peace or face a national economic catastrophe.\nThis is the choice Ronald Reagan forced Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to make back in the late 1980s. Reagan understood that peace only comes through strength. He would tell us, \u201cSign the sanctions bill.\u201d\nGregory W.

      "text": "Lindsey Graham says Trump\u2019s goal is to prevent third invasion of Ukraine, wants Zelensky \u2018to be part of the process\u2019\nOne of President Trump\u2019s core objectives heading into negotiations with Russian tyrant Vladimir Putin will be to prevent a third invasion of Ukraine, according to Sen. Lindsey Graham.\n\u201cI am here to tell you that President Trump will end this war in a way to prevent a third invasion and not to entice China to take Taiwan,\u201d Graham (R-SC), who went golfing with Trump on Saturday, told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re not out to humiliate Putin, we\u2019re out to get a deal to make sure there\u2019s no third invasion.\u201d\nGraham didn\u2019t shed light on how Trump might go about trying to prevent a future invasion of Ukraine, but called for Kyiv to get security guarantees from European countries. Top Russian officials have previously been critical of the idea of Europe providing Ukraine with security.\nRussia infamously annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and began its current, brutal invasion in February of 2022.\nThe South Carolina Republican also suggested that the US should continue working to ensure Ukraine\u2019s military remains strong after the war concludes in order to deter future aggression.\n\u201cMilitarily, we need to keep Ukraine strong, keep flowing them strong and modern weapons, and security guarantees with European forces on the ground as trip wires to prevent a third invasion,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe want to end this with the sovereign, independent, self-governing Ukraine, and a situation where Putin cannot do this the third time without being crushed. This is really a dress rehearsal for Taiwan.\u201d\nTrump is set to meet with Putin in Alaska on Friday.\nThat meeting comes after Putin purportedly made offers to special envoy Steve Witkoff, though details about what the Kremlin tyrant put on the table are murky.\nPrior to the supposed breakthrough between Witkoff and Putin, Trump had threatened to impose steep secondary sanctions or tariffs against Russia.\nThe president gave Moscow a deadline of last Friday to either take steps towards peace with Ukraine or else he would pull the trigger on those economic penalties.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has worked to patch things up with Trump since their February Oval Office shouting match, has publicly argued that decisions on how to broker peace cannot be made without Ukraine. Zelensky has also cast doubt on territorial concessions to Russia.\n\u201cI do hope that Zelensky can be part of the process. I\u2019ll leave that up to the White House,\u201d Graham said of the upcoming talks between Trump and Putin.\n\u201cI have every confidence in the world that the President is going to go to meet Putin from a position of strength, that he\u2019s going to look out for Europe and Ukrainian needs to end this war honorably.\u201d\nThe White House has reportedly toyed with the idea of having Zelensky attend the meeting with Putin. But Trump has made it clear publicly that he is willing to meet Putin without Zelensky.\nGraham also floated the division of Berlin as a model to settle the conflict between Russia over time.\n\u201cThink about East Berlin and West Berlin as the way a conflict can be settled, at least for a period of time. North Korea and South Korea [are] in a state of truce. There\u2019s never been a final settlement,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI want to be honest with you. Ukraine\u2019s not going to evict every Russian, and Russia\u2019s not going to keep [everything]. So there will be some land swaps at the end,\u201d he added. \u201cThe goal for me, and I think President Trump, is to end it [the war] forever.\u201d"

      "text": "Reprinted with permission from Discourse Magazine, an online journal published by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, where Martin Gurri is a visiting fellow.\nThe structures that bind the nations of the world together are breaking down before our eyes.\nTwo savage wars are raging in volatile regions, either of which might at any moment blow up to involve additional belligerents and the potential use of nuclear weapons.\nThe UN, established to prevent such disasters, has become a plaything of dictators: Iran, one of the bloodiest regimes on earth and a proud sponsor of terrorism, has just assumed the chair of the UN\u2019s Human Rights Council.\nChina has greatly accelerated production of nuclear warheads \u2014 and the Chinese media has begun to issue threats about \u201cwar on a global scale.\u201d\nThe erratic Kim regime in North Korea has the bomb and the aforementioned Iranians, who have promised to annihilate Israel, are about to get theirs.\nThe Venezuelans are threatening to invade Guyana, which would disrupt the energy markets.\nUnder the Taliban, Afghanistan is once again a potential staging area for terrorist attacks; but many additional locations are on offer \u2014 Yemen, Syria, Libya, Pakistan, whole swaths of the Sahel.\nMeanwhile, waves of escapees from impoverished and conflict-ridden nations batter democratic societies and roil democratic politics.\nThis global implosion is a consequence of the failure of American leadership, most particularly in the Obama-Biden years.\nThis is not to let their predecessors off the hook.\nGeorge W. Bush, for one, was handed a bipartisan consensus on foreign policy after 9/11, which he proceeded to squander during the invasion and occupation of Iraq.\nBush made a fetish of promoting democracy abroad until free elections put Hamas in control of Gaza.\nA weakened Bush was unable to do much about Vladimir Putin\u2019s bullying of Georgia, his first excursion outside Russia\u2019s borders.\nEach of these failures bore bitter fruit.\nBut Bush left office 15 years ago.\nFor 11 of those years, the government has been in the hands of either Barack Obama or Joe Biden, and the doctrines governing our relations with the world have made a virtue of escapism and retreat.\nAs the US has tiptoed away from crises, aspiring powers like Russia, Iran and China, vectors of violence and disorder, have rushed in to fill the void.\nIt\u2019s important to tease out the peculiar worldview, largely shared by both presidents, that has brought us to this point.\nDuring his presidency, Barack Obama disdained the deployment of US power on behalf of our national interest.\nThe whole concept was simply absent from his rhetoric.\nObama held a dark view of history, which he judged to be a mindless zero-sum struggle for supremacy. The talk of interests was a cloak for tribal selfishness.\n\u201cFor human history has often been a record of nations and tribes, and, yes, religions subjugating one another in pursuit of their interests,\u201d he admonished at Al-Azhar University in Cairo.\nSmarter than thou\nObama was persuaded that he had cut the Gordian knot of great power politics.\nThis breakthrough depended less on old-fashioned strategic maneuvers than on a cluster of personal attitudes and attributes, none more important than \u201csmart.\u201d\nHillary Clinton, his first secretary of state, called the new approach \u201csmart power.\u201d\nObama himself, being power-allergic, preferred to speak in terms of \u201ca smart foreign policy\u201d and \u201ca smarter kind of American leadership.\u201d\nSince history always favored the smart, foreign policy needed only one operating principle: Avoid mistakes.\nTo dive back into Obama\u2019s presidential statements is to encounter a mind preoccupied to the point of obsession with the mistakes of the past.\nThe \u201cpainful chapter in our history\u201d that was Vietnam, the \u201coverthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government\u201d and, hovering over everything, the \u201cdumb war\u201d in Iraq\u2014his administration\u2019s prime directive for dealing with the world was never again to indulge in such a toxic cocktail of ignorance and aggression.\nOr, in the more concise foreign policy mantra of the age of Obama: \u201cDon\u2019t do stupid s\u2013t.\u201d\nThe logical conclusion of this outlook was utter inaction.\nThe Obama administration remained determinedly passive in the face of events that shattered the old strategic landscape and began the descent into the vortex.\nDue to the turmoil that followed Donald Trump\u2019s election to the presidency, not much attention has been paid to the consequences of the Obama foreign policy.\nThis is a serious oversight.\nHis tenure was a prolonged bet on the proposition that globally, for the US, there can be no such thing as a sin of omission.\nIn every instance, that bet was lost. Hundreds of thousands died as a result \u2014 but the slaughter took place in obscure countries like Syria and Libya, while the news media looked in the other direction.\nFrom Russian aggression to North Korean nuclear truculence, the troubles that torment us today were loosened or at least given free rein at this time \u2014 but the only foreign affairs question that seemed to matter after 2016 was the extent to which Putin controlled the sitting president\u2019s brain.\nThe Obama doctrines turned out to be an exercise in self-delusion.\nHistory hadn\u2019t really entered a new era of benevolence.\nThat was just wish fulfillment.\nObama himself didn\u2019t possess prophetic vision or Einsteinian intelligence.\nThat was just vanity.\nAmerican meekness\nWhen events began to rain down on his administration, the response lacked any semblance of coherence.\nFaced with the crisis of the Egyptian regime in the 2011 \u201cArab Spring,\u201d for example, the administration never worked out whether to back old ally Hosni Mubarak, the telegenic protesters in Tahrir Square, the democratically elected Islamist Mohamed Morsi or ultimate winner Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi.\nEach player in turn felt betrayed by the vacillations of the U.S. government.\nAfter a brief flirtation with democracy, the Egyptians, left to their own devices, succumbed once again to authoritarianism.\nIn the brutal Syrian civil war, the Obama team made no effort either to broker a peace or to support those seeking to overthrow anti-U.S. dictator Bashar al-Assad, creating a geopolitical vacuum quickly filled by fanatical Islamists.\nPresident Obama eventually did best himself to warn of \u201cenormous consequences\u201d if the Assad regime crossed his \u201cred lines\u201d on the use of chemical weapons.\nA few months later, the Syrians did just that.\nThe red lines were trampled on; the president dithered.\nIn the end, the consequences were almost invisibly small \u2014 the outsourcing of the problem to Putin, Assad\u2019s patron.\nFor the first time in 50 years, the Russians were back in the eastern Mediterranean, bombing the Syrian rebels without mercy.\nThe conflict continues to this day; estimates of deaths run as high as 600,000.\nOur posture in the Libya intervention was famously described by the White House as \u201cleading from behind.\u201d\nThe phrase captured the Obama spirit well.\nDeliberate half-heartedness allowed the conflict to drag on for months and gave Gadhafi time to wreak vengeance on his opponents.\nThe objective of the operation was to save lives, but up to 25,000 were killed on both sides.\nLibya today remains a broken country and a spawning-ground for terror.\nThe confusion of wish with fact was impressive.\n\u201c[W]e\u2019re leaving behind a sovereign, stable, and self-reliant Iraq,\u201d Obama asserted in December 2011, as he withdrew the last U.S. troops from that country.\nHe was mistaken.\nThe Iraqi government collapsed before the haphazard forces of the Islamic State \u2014 and American troops were back to stay.\nObama had dismissed ISIS as the \u201cJV\u201d team, in contrast to the more muscular al-Qaida varsity.\nHe was wrong about that too.\nThe aspiring caliphate was the most successful and destructive of any Islamist group, inflicting beheadings, crucifixions and the genocide of unapproved minorities on a territory the size of Great Britain.\nSmart diplomacy seemed remarkably blind to cause and effect.\nFailure to engage in Syria had opened the door to ISIS, which in turn caused the near-disintegration of an Iraq forsaken by U.S. forces.\nI find no evidence that either Obama or his high-IQ advisers understood these simple linkages between events.\nThe administration was unrelentingly hostile to Israel, our strongest ally in the region, but indulgent with Iran, our most determined enemy \u2014 and, to the Obama mind, a test of his transformational powers.\nWhen massive anti-regime protests rocked Iran, President Obama, leader of the free world, uttered not a single word of encouragement.\nWhen captured U.S. Navy sailors were photographed kneeling before gun-toting Iranians, secretary of state John Kerry expressed our \u201cgratitude\u201d for their eventual release.\nThe reward for American meekness was the nuclear deal struck with Iran: a triumph of desire over experience.\nThe Iranians received billions.\nWe got a lot of promises.\nNothing in the now-defunct agreement would have stopped the regime from building its bomb, and we, their chief target, had somehow blessed the project.\nRelations with Russia began with Hillary Clinton bringing a literal \u201creset button\u201d to Moscow, token of a new and wiser era.\nIt all ended with the Russians conquering Crimea and attacking Ukraine \u2014 the direct precursor of the current war.\nWith China, the administration sought \u201ca new model of relations\u201d\u2014meaning it would look the other way as the Chinese lay claim to more and more of the South China Sea and built fortified artificial islands there.\nToward North Korea, which boasted it could now reach American shores with its missiles, Obama advocated \u201cstrategic patience,\u201d meaning he planned to kick the problem down the road.\nNot a single initiative I can think of during Obama\u2019s eight years in office made the US stronger or safer.\nAllies were left wondering how long they could depend on American friendship.\nNations that do not wish us well made their plans on a perception of American passivity.\nI have hammered on these developments at some length to make a point: We inhabit today the wounded world left behind by the Obama presidency.\nThe Obama dreamworld fit neatly into the former president\u2019s estimation of his personal attributes.\nJoe Biden has inherited the dream but is an entirely different person.\nThe worship of the new just doesn\u2019t work when the high priest is an octogenarian.\nFor Biden, probably, \u201cnew\u201d is something that happened in the \u201990s.\nThe glorification of smart also lacks credibility.\nAt his peak, Biden was never a towering intellect, and his cognitive capacities have declined to the point where it\u2019s unclear who is actually making the decisions in the White House.\nMoreover, foreign affairs haven\u2019t exactly been the president\u2019s strong suit.\n\u201cI think he has been wrong on nearly every foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades,\u201d judged former defense secretary and CIA chief Robert Gates.\nBarack Obama had a pithier assessment: \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate Joe\u2019s ability to fuck things up.\u201d\nWhile this may be unfair, it is evidently a widely held opinion among the elite class. Obama\u2019s policies shipwrecked the world but his narrative survived intact.\nIn the person of Joe Biden, we come to something like narrative collapse.\nOn Biden\u2019s watch, the transformational mission has settled into an automatic reflex.\nDespite the unwavering enmity of the ayatollahs, Biden has been desperate to renew the nuclear deal, which lapsed during the Trump years.\nInertia & dementia\nThis is policy inertia, with typically baffling consequences.\nThe Iranians train and supply Hamas.\nHamas recently massacred 1,200 Israelis, igniting a war in Gaza.\nThe Biden administration supports Israel in the conflict \u2014 but, for unfathomable reasons, it just released $10 billion to Iran.\nPresumably, the money can be turned around to kill more Israelis, on whose side we are on.\nThe explanations offered were nonsensical.\nThis was policy dementia.\nMuch has been said about Biden\u2019s Afghanistan disaster, not least by me.\nThe episode revealed a persistent inability of the president and his people to grasp what was happening.\n\u201cThere is going to be no circumstance in which you see people lifted off the roof of an embassy,\u201d Biden reassured us in a spectacular display of self-deception.\n\u201cThe likelihood that you\u2019re going to see the Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely.\u201d\n\u201cWe are not withdrawing, we are staying, the embassy is staying, our programs are staying,\u201d insisted Secretary of State Antony Blinken, even as helicopters hovered over the US Embassy in Kabul.\nWhen asked about a possible collapse by our Afghan allies, Blinken replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be something that happens from a Friday to a Monday.\u201d\nIn fact, Kabul fell to the Taliban in 24 hours.\nAfter 13 Americans had died and thousands were left behind, with horrific scenes of panic at Kabul Airport and the country in our enemy\u2019s hands, President Biden surveyed the wreckage and pronounced the whole thing an \u201cextraordinary success.\u201d\nWe can be sure that agents of chaos like Putin and Hamas were listening.\nThe United States isn\u2019t the world\u2019s policeman but it is the only truly global power.\nWhen the president perceives defeat as extraordinary success, the temptation to repeat the experience can become irresistible.\nA large and significant anomaly to the administration\u2019s brain-dead Obamaism needs to be explained.\nOn the outbreak of their respective wars, the US swiftly sided with Ukraine and Israel and acted decisively to support these allies.\nI find it hard to picture Barack Obama doing the same: It would have violated the historicist narrative.\nBiden, immersed in narrative collapse, may have stumbled closer to reality than his mentor ever did.\nThe president has always been a transactional politician, reacting to situations according to two guiding principles.\nOne is the conventional wisdom of Democratic Party grandees; this can turn problematic when the elites are divided, as they are today on Israel.\nThe other is his sense of self-importance. Biden is probably the neediest president in our history.\nHe rarely waits for others to praise him \u2014 he\u2019ll get there first himself.\n\u201cThey tell me I\u2019m the first American president to travel to [Israel] during a war.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m told I was the first American president to enter a war zone [Ukraine] not controlled by the United States military since Lincoln.\u201d\nA shaky identity seems to inspire the neediness: Biden has been caught inventing personal anecdotes and plagiarizing the words of other political figures.\nWhile these aren\u2019t flattering traits, they have opened a path out of inaction.\nIf Obama owned the golden future, Biden presides over a moment of terrible peril, an \u201cinflection point\u201d in which the forces of democracy, in retreat since Trump\u2019s election, are making a stand against advancing authoritarians.\nAt stake is \u201cthe direction of our future for generations to come.\u201d\n\u2018Masterpiece Theater\u2019\nBoth Ukraine and Israel, democracies under attack, deserve the full measure of US support.\nThe Ukrainians fight for freedom \u201cagainst Putin\u2019s brutal war.\u201d Hamas has \u201cunleashed pure unadulterated evil in the world.\u201d\nIn this cosmic struggle, only the US, \u201cthe essential nation,\u201d can rally the world to the cause of democracy \u2014 and, it\u2019s strongly implied, only President Biden, who began his tenure by defeating Trump, can credibly lead the US in the crusade against authoritarianism.\nThere\u2019s truth in all of this.\nUkraine and Israel merit assistance.\nIt would be good for the world if Putin and Hamas were permanently defeated.\nThat won\u2019t happen without US involvement.\nBut we get nothing beyond glittering generalities \u2014 no articulation of our interests, no stacking of priorities, no hint of what we would do if, say, Ukraine were to succumb.\nWe discover, in Biden\u2019s words, a strong performative element: When he refers to the US as \u201cthe arsenal of democracy,\u201d he seems to be auditioning for the part of Franklin Roosevelt in a \u201cMasterpiece Theater\u201d series.\nAnd the suspicion arises that, instead of a conversion to realism, we are looking at a new and more personal calculus of delusion.\nThe words certainly portray two very different wars.\nUkraine gets unconditional love.\nZelensky is a media hero, while Putin, the man who purportedly got Trump elected, is the ultimate villain to progressives.\nBiden can bask in the popularity of the war among the Democratic base, the sort of people who hang Ukrainian flags next to their \u201cHate Has No Home Here\u201d signs.\nOpposition to funding the war by congressional Republicans just confirms the rightness of the cause.\nIsrael, conversely, has been weighed down with conditions. Israelis \u201cmust not be blinded by rage,\u201d the president cautioned.\nProgressive backlash\n\u201cThere must be no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, no reoccupation, no siege or blockade, and no reduction in territory,\u201d he asserted.\nBoth Biden and Blinken have demanded the unification of Gaza with the West Bank, presumably under the Palestinian Authority.\nIt would be suicidal \u2014 and delusional \u2014 for Israel to accede to most of these requests.\nThe war in Gaza is deeply unpopular with progressives, young people and other segments of the Democratic coalition.\nAccording to the identity creed revered by Democratic elites, the Palestinians are the eternal victims while Israel is the colonizing oppressor.\nBenjamin Netanyahu is seen as the Israeli Trump\u2014he has yet to receive an invitation to the Biden White House.\nIsrael\u2019s war to exterminate Hamas will be long and gruesome.\nEvery civilian death, real or imagined, will be vividly captured and sensationalized by the media.\nTo his credit, President Biden so far has accepted the need for Israel to push on, but I wonder whether he will be able to withstand the growing pressure from his political left flank for a \u201cpermanent cease-fire.\u201d\nMy guess is that he won\u2019t.\nNow that the recent cease-fire to exchange hostages has collapsed, expect him to call for another: There are always reasons.\nAt a minimum, we will see a return to the Obama doctrine that equates passivity with peace.\nWorst case, if his political prospects continue to plummet in an election year, Biden could well find some pretext to pick a loud and gratifying fight with Netanyahu.\nHow responsible are the Obama-Biden policies for the proliferating troubles in the world?\nSince we lack alternate histories, the question is impossible to answer with any precision.\nBut we do have the Trump interval: four years we can treat like the control group in an experiment.\nNeither Trump nor his surrogates possessed a grand strategic outlook.\nTrump himself fixated on trade grievances with countries like China and Mexico, but beyond that he improvised much as Biden has done \u2014 except on a different intuition of the world.\nThat difference, I believe, might shed some light on the question of responsibility.\nWhat jumps out from any review of the Trump years is that they were parentheses.\nA lot happened before and after, but inside the brackets there was relative quiet.\nRussia is a striking example.\nObama saw the Russians return to the Mediterranean, swallow Crimea and attack Ukraine; Biden has had to deal with a full-scale invasion aimed at Ukraine\u2019s destruction.\nTrump\u2019s main concern with Russia was the accusation that he was Putin\u2019s puppet.\nMany factors unrelated to Trump\u2019s policies could explain this, but the divergence is undeniable.\nThe same holds true for Iran, the Middle East and the Muslim world in general. Obama waffled the response to the Iranian street protests and tolerated Iran\u2019s capture of a US Navy boat so he could obtain his questionable nuclear deal.\nHe left Iraq wide open to ISIS, abandoned Syria to the Russians and devastated Libya.\nBiden severely botched the withdrawal from Afghanistan, managed to alienate both Saudi Arabia and Israel, then had to contend with the Hamas atrocities and the war in Gaza.\nTrump\u2019s legacy in the region, by contrast, is the Abraham Accords between Israel and the Gulf emirates.\nI could go on. A similar pattern can be detected in our relations with China and Europe, for example.\nBut my intention here isn\u2019t to lead a cheer for Trump, who was an inexperienced and inattentive foreign policy leader surrounded by an ever-shifting cast of mediocre appointees.\nI\u2019m interested in the question of responsibility, which now dissolves into a simpler query: Why didn\u2019t the world fall apart under Trump?\nThe answer could be dumb luck. History, to the analyst\u2019s despair, has a tendency to play favorites.\nBut there\u2019s another possibility.\nTrump, the populist outsider, was forced to rely on institutional and political processes that, however decadent, were still grounded in experience.\nHis wisdom was of the negative kind: In foreign affairs, he lacked the ambition, and probably the imagination, to reinvent reality according to his fondest desires.\nAgainst the grain of his personal and rhetorical excesses, Trump dealt with the world straight up.\nThe lesson would be a truism in less obtuse times.\nFor an American president to have a shot at success among the nations, friend and foe alike, a necessary precondition might just be the avoidance of willful blindness."

      "text": "A Trump-Putin peace deal would mean nothing without Ukraine at the table\nVice President JD Vance said Sunday that the White House is working on scheduling a trilateral meeting among Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. This is good news.\nTrump obviously is frustrated with the situation in Ukraine, a war he\u2019s saddened by and wants desperately to end.\nEarly in his term, he took out that frustration on Zelensky, culminating in that Oval Office UFC match.\nBut then the president rightly noted that Putin was \u201ctapping us along\u201d \u2014 that the dictator offered smiles and compliments, then targeted civilians with missiles and drones.\nRelations between Ukraine and Trump improved. Ukraine signed an agreement with the US to set up a reconstruction investment fund, and Europe agreed to pay for US weapons on behalf of the country. Trump gave Putin 50 days to come to the table, then shortened the deadline to this past Friday when the bombardment didn\u2019t stop.\nThen \u2026 the record scratch.\nOn the day of the deadline, rather than hit Russia with new sanctions, Trump agreed to meet Putin face to face, this Friday in Alaska.\nWhat changed? Some reporting suggests that Putin has dropped his requirement of regime change in Ukraine. But he\u2019s still demanding one-third of the country, including land he\u2019s been unable to take on the battlefield, such as Ukraine\u2019s \u201cfortress belt\u201d that\u2019s been blocking Russian advances since 2014.\nMore likely is that Trump, facing more months of killing even with sanctions, jumped at the chance when his envoy, Steve Witkoff, said Putin was open to discussion.\nBut any agreement forged between Trump and Putin in Alaska means nothing if Ukraine isn\u2019t involved.\nFirst, despite the claims of anti-Ukraine podcasters, Putin is not coming into this meeting from a position of strength. His vaunted \u201csummer offensive\u201d is inching along, with little hope of winning the areas Putin\u2019s demanding as part of a deal.\nBy sheer population advantage, Russia can grind out some progress, but at a tremendous cost: 250,000 soldiers dead, 1 million casualties so far. The Russian economy is fraying.\nUkraine has pulled off some stunning victories \u2014 including using a drone ploy to destroy long-range bombers on the other side of Russia.\nPutin is in no position to dictate terms. He has not vanquished his foes; they humiliated him.\nAh, the podcasters continue, but this would only be possible with US weapons.\nCertainly American arms have played a key role, but it is not Americans who are dying. Ukraine has defended itself while hobbling a geopolitical foe and making the world a safer place.\nThink of how emboldened and dangerous Putin would have been had Ukraine capitulated quickly. Where would he be looking now? The Balkans? Eastern Europe?\nHow many more battles would the United States be facing? The Ukrainians don\u2019t owe us; we owe them a debt of gratitude.\nFor these reasons and more, a treaty cannot be imposed upon the people of Ukraine. They will fight on. Even if American arms dry up, the Europeans will help.\nThey understand that Putin can\u2019t be trusted: Any agreement that doesn\u2019t include hard provisions for Ukraine\u2019s future security \u2014 and automatic, severe sanctions if Moscow doesn\u2019t live up to its word \u2014 just gives time for Russia to rearm, regroup and then invade again.\nAll that said, the fighting is a horrifically destructive near-stalemate, and Ukraine may need to make concessions. But these are concessions Kyiv must help negotiate.\nDon\u2019t let Alaska go down as one of history\u2019s notorious giveaways. Make sure Ukraine has a seat at the table, Mr. President: It\u2019s the only way to get to a fair and lasting peace."

      "text": "Vance says only Trump can decide when to bring Putin and Zelensky together for peace talks\nVice President JD Vance said Sunday that the US is working on getting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky together with President Trump and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin for crucial peace talks.\nVance confirmed that the US is negotiating to get the leaders together for the first time in 3.5 years of war after Zelensky and European leaders expressed concerns that the peace talks were moving forward without Kyiv\u2019s involvement.\n\u201cOne of the most important logjams is that Vladimir Putin said that he would never sit down with Zelensky,\u201d Vance told Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re at a point now where we\u2019re trying to figure out, frankly, scheduling and things like that around when these three leaders could sit down and discuss an end to this conflict,\u201d he added.\nThe vice president\u2019s remarks come after European leaders backed Trump\u2019s peace efforts, but emphasized the need to include Ukraine in the talks.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, UK PM Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen all agreed that the \u201cpath to peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Ukraine.\u201d\n\u201cWe are convinced that only an approach that combines active diplomacy, support to Ukraine and pressure on the Russian Federation to end their illegal war can succeed,\u201d the leaders wrote in a joint statement issued on Saturday.\nVance, however, suggested that Zelensky\u2019s presence, if forced, could railroad such peace talks, saying that it would be up to Trump to decide on how best to progress the negotiations.\n\u201cI think, fundamentally, the president of the United States has to be the one to kind of bring these two together,\u201d Vance said.\n\u201cThis is something where the president needs to force President Putin and President Zelensky to really sit down to figure out their differences,\u201d he added.\nVance did not detail when a meeting with the three world leaders could take place, including whether it is likely on Friday, when Trump is scheduled for a historic one-on-one with Putin in Alaska.\nThe White House has reportedly toyed with the idea of having Zelensky attend the meeting with Putin. But Trump has made it clear publicly that he is willing to meet Putin without Zelensky.\nPutin has repeatedly stated that he does not recognize Ukraine\u2019s \u201canti-Russian\u201d government, slamming Zelensky as an illegitimate leader since presidential elections were suspended in the face of Moscow\u2019s invasion.\nVance emphasized that the goal for the Trump administration remains ending the war.\n\u201cWe, of course, condemn the invasion that happened. We don\u2019t like that this is where things are, but you have got to make peace here,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd the only way to make peace is to sit down and talk.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t finger-point. You can\u2019t wag your finger at somebody and say, \u2018You\u2019re wrong. We\u2019re right.\u2019 The way to peace is to have a decisive leader sit down and force people to come together,\u201d he added.\nZelensky has been adamant that any peace deal inked without Ukraine \u201cwon\u2019t work\u201d and has seemingly pumped the brakes on the notion that Kyiv will make territorial concessions to Russia.\nMoscow has repeatedly stated that a cease-fire will only take place if it\u2019s allowed to keep the land its military is currently occupying, which amounts to 20% of Ukraine\u2019s territory.\nBoth Ukraine and Europe slammed the condition as a non-starter.\n\u201cWe\u2019re, of course, going to talk to the Ukrainians,\u201d Vance insisted. \u201cI actually spoke with the Ukrainians this morning. [Secretary of State] Marco [Rubio] has been talking to them quite a bit.\u201d\nThe vice president has also been meeting with European and Ukrainian officials in the UK over the weekend as preparations unfold for the high-stakes summit in Alaska on Friday.\nTrump has made ending the bloody war in Ukraine a top foreign policy priority of his second term in office.\nThe president has also departed from his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, by attempting to position himself as a mediator between warring Russia in Ukraine.\n\u201cWe have a lot of economic points of leverage. And we\u2019re willing to use those to bring about peace. And that was a big thing that happened,\u201d Vance explained, appearing to credit Trump\u2019s ultimatum against Russia for the breakthrough.\n\u201cAmericans, I think, are sick of continuing to send their money, their tax dollars to this particular conflict. But if the Europeans want to step up and actually buy the weapons from American producers, we\u2019re OK with that.\u201d\nMeanwhile, in Moscow, Russian officials are celebrating the upcoming meeting with Trump and Putin as a victory for the Kremlin.\nRussia\u2019s special economic envoy Kirill Dmitriev hailed the meeting as a path to normalize US-Russian relations, citing the location of the summit, Alaska, as a symbol of the two nations\u2019 bond.\nThe US had purchased the territory from Russia in 1867 for about $7.2 million."

      "text": "Trump says he\u2019ll tell Putin to end Ukraine invasion, vows Zelensky will be in \u2018next meeting\u2019\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Trump said Monday that he plans to tell Russian President Vladimir Putin to stop his invasion of Ukraine when they meet Friday in Alaska \u2014 and that he will include Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the \u201cnext meeting.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be telling him, \u2018You\u2019ve got to end this war,\u2019\u201d Trump said at a White House press conference where he announced plans to federalize local police as a part of a crime crackdown in Washington, DC.\nTrump confirmed that Zelensky would not be included in this week\u2019s summit \u2014 but promised that he would call Kyiv and European leaders after meeting with Putin if the sitdown goes well.\n\u201cThe next meeting will be with Zelensky and Putin, or Zelensky, Putin and me,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI want to arrange a meeting between the two leaders.\u201d\nLast week\u2019s announcement that Putin would agree to a summit on US soil came as a surprise to foreign policy observers, some of whom had floated Hungary, Switzerland, Turkey or the United Arab Emirates as possible locations.\n\u201cI thought it was very respectful that the president of Russia is coming to our country, as opposed to us going to his country or even a third place,\u201d Trump said Monday.\nThe president reaffirmed Monday that any peace deal to end the 41-month-old invasion by Moscow would include changes to territorial lines that Ukraine has bitterly resisted.\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be some swapping, there\u2019ll be some changes in land,\u201d he said, adding \u201cwe\u2019re going to try to get some of that territory back for Ukraine.\u201d\nUnder Kyiv\u2019s constitution, the ceding of territory must be approved by a nationwide referendum, a fact that Trump expressed frustration with Monday.\n\u201cI was a little bothered by the fact that Zelensky was saying, \u2018Well, I have to get constitutional approval,\u2019\u201d Trump groused.\n\u201cI mean, he\u2019s got approval to go into war and kill everybody, but he needs approval to do a land swap.\u201d\nIn a separate remark, Trump told reporters that \u201cI get along with Zelensky, but you know, I disagree with what he\u2019s done, very very severely\u201d \u2014 without specifying what the Ukrainian president had done to cause offense.\nTrump also noted he spoke to Russia-friendly Hungarian President Viktor Orban about the possibility of Ukraine winning a war against Russia \u2014 a theory the Hungarian leader scoffed at.\n\u201cHe looked at me like, \u2018What a stupid question,\u2019\u201d Trump said of his conversation with Orban, who the US president called a \u201cvery, very smart man.\u201d\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Russia is a massive country, and they win their country, and they win their life through wars,\u2019\u201d Trump went on.\nThe Alaska meeting will be the first time Trump has seen Putin in his second term, and the first time a US president has spoken to the Russian leader face-to-face since his invasion of Ukraine.\nWhile Trump said he has gotten \u201calong with Putin,\u201d he also reiterated his exasperation at the Russian leader for not backing up his claim that he wants to end the war with actions.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been disappointed, because I\u2019d have a great call with him, and then missiles would be lobbed into Kyiv or some other place, and you\u2019d have 60 people laying on a road dying.\u201d\nTrump predicted he would know \u201cwithin two minutes\u201d whether the summit would be a success, and promised that he could walk away from negotiations altogether if the meeting goes awry.\n\u201cNow I may leave and say, \u2018Good luck,\u2019 and that\u2019ll be the end. I may say, \u2018This is not going to be settled.\u2019\u201d\nThe mission, Trump said, is to see what Putin \u201chas in mind\u201d for a deal, hopefully one that other leaders can get on board with.\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get it done. I\u2019d like to see a cease-fire very very quickly, very quick.\u201d\n\u201cThey\u2019re not doing well, their economy is not doing well right now because it\u2019s been very well disturbed by this,\u201d Trump went on, claiming Putin had initially broached the possibility of a summit.\nThe president noted that he was imposing a 50% tariff on India as Russia\u2019s second largest energy importer \u2014 behind only China \u2014 and that that economic hit \u201cwas a big blow.\u201d\n\u201cI was all set to do things far bigger than that, but I got a call that they\u2019d like to meet, and I\u2019m going to see what they want to meet about. I\u2019d like to see a cease-fire. I\u2019d like to see the best deal that could be made for both parties,\u201d he said.\nTrump said several times in his comments he would be \u201cgoing to Russia,\u201d but appeared to be misspeaking about going to Alaska, as no plans of him going to Russian territory have been announced.\nThe White House did not immediately respond to inquiries from The Post Monday."

      "text": "Douglas Murray: Putin\u2019s playbook is the same a quarter-century later \u2014 peace talks are pointless\nPresident George W. Bush famously underestimated Vladimir Putin.\nAsked about his impressions of the Russian president after a brief meeting in 2001, the then-US president claimed that he had \u201clooked into Putin\u2019s eyes\u201d and \u201csaw his soul.\u201d\nIt is odd that Bush imagined he had some mystical ability to divine the soul of his Russian counterpart.\nHis secretary of state, Colin Powell, had a different reaction.\nPowell said that he, too, had looked into Putin\u2019s eyes \u201cand I saw the KGB.\u201d\nAlmost a quarter of a century has passed since then.\nUS presidents have come and gone.\nBut Putin remains, still perplexing his US counterparts.\nBush found out what was behind Putin\u2019s eyes a little too late.\nToward the end of Bush\u2019s second term, in 2008, Putin\u2019s Russia invaded the neighboring country of Georgia.\nAlthough Putin didn\u2019t get everything he wanted from that conflict, his brutal invasion did allow him to purge Georgians from South Ossetia and Abkhazia and install Russian forces in those regions.\nLesson of history\nIt was a relatively small war, but one that many people in the West seem to have forgotten.\nEver since Putin repeated his Georgian maneuver on a much grander scale in Ukraine in 2022, there are still people who like to pretend that Ukraine is all that Vladimir Putin wants.\nTo think this is to repeat a historic mistake.\nIn general you can weigh up world leaders in two ways: what they say, and what they do.\nPutin is by turns open and sphinx-like about what he wants.\nSpeaking to the Russian people, he can be explicit about the expansion he wants \u2014 including the reconstruction of the Soviet Empire.\nTo others he can play a subtler game, bamboozling ignorant foreign interviewers and running rings around them.\nBut it is by his actions that you can really know Putin.\nAnd just consider his actions lately.\nThis week he ordered some of the largest aerial assaults to date on the people of Ukraine.\nPresident Trump, who believed that he was in the middle of a cease-fire negotiation with the Russian president, finally seemed to have lost patience.\n\u201cAbsolutely crazy\u201d was among the things that Trump labeled Putin\u2019s latest assault on his neighbor.\nPutin\u2019s spokesman responded by dismissing Trump\u2019s comments as \u201cemotional.\u201d\nBut Trump is right to be angry about what Putin is doing.\nBecause at the same time as dragging out negotiations \u2014 postponing meetings, reneging on promises \u2014 he is deliberately dragging out the war that he started.\nAnd there are few signs that he is ready to stop that war anytime soon. In the past three years he has restructured the whole Russian economy onto a wartime footing.\nWith arms production on overdrive and billions of dollars being spent on the wartime economy, he has few reasons to stop the war even if he wanted to.\nRussia is good at sitting out long conflicts, and its people are used to hardship.\nCompare that to the Western powers who say they want to stand up to Putin.\nTrump has rightly insisted that this country\u2019s European allies step up to the moment and increase their share of defense spending.\nHe is absolutely right in that \u2014 and his pressure is already having positive results.\nGermany\u2019s mistake\nWhen Angela Merkel was chancellor of Germany, she made a set of catastrophic policy decisions relating to Russia.\nNot least was her enthusiasm for importing cheap Russian gas through the Nord Stream 2 project.\nWorse was that during her chancellorship, Germany\u2019s defense spending dropped to just 1% of GDP.\nToday, since Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Germany has realized that it is going to have to step up.\nUnder pressure from Trump, Chancellor Friedrich Merz is promising to up his country\u2019s defense spending to 5% of GDP.\nWhich is double the baseline spending commitment expected of NATO members.\nBut the question of when that military spending will turn into military reality is another question.\nIn reality we might all be dead of natural causes before Germany manages to increase its arms production and army recruitment processes.\nPutin knows that. He knows that with a US which doesn\u2019t threaten him, and a Europe that can\u2019t get its act together, the cards are largely in his hands.\nIt is another reason why it seems that he can afford himself little treats, as well as monumental snubs.\nThe snubs include his repeated claims that he is committed to peace while bombing the hell out of Ukraine.\nThe little treats include some very knowing nods to the Soviet past.\nThis week a new monument was unveiled in the Moscow subway system.\nBut the new statue was of an old leader.\nIt is an ugly Soviet frieze-like monument of Joseph Stalin surrounded by statues of adoring works and children. Flowers were placed on the monument shortly after it was unveiled.\nThe sculpture tells its own tale.\nIt is part of a concerted effort by Putin and his regime to rehabilitate the Soviet dictator who was responsible for more deaths and misery than any other Russian leader.\nAs well as being responsible for the deaths of millions of his own countrymen, Stalin stands out as one of the most blood-thirsty, cunning and expansionist leaders in Russian history.\nAmong some serious competition.\nDreams of empire\nSo why would the authorities in Moscow go back to celebrating him now?\nBecause Russia is on a war footing, and every stop is being pulled out to persuade the Russian people of the virtue of that war.\nMany Russians still revere Stalin \u2014 in spite of the gulags and purges \u2014 because he helped Russia get through and help win the Second World War.\nPutin wants to draw on those same Russian reserves.\nAnd he wants to persuade his people that his war in Ukraine is absolutely similar to Stalin\u2019s war against the Nazis.\nHe is drawing on the deepest and darkest reserves that he can in order to keep his war in motion.\nIt is up to the West to decide whether the darkness that Vladimir Putin draws on is something we should just observe.\nOr a force that we can deter."

  "argos_summary": "The upcoming summit between Presidents Trump and Putin is seen as a potential opportunity for Trump to leverage Putin's weakened position due to Russia's economic struggles and military losses in Ukraine. Experts suggest that Russia may only sustain its war efforts for another 12 to 16 months, creating a critical moment for the U.S. to push for a peace deal that includes Ukraine's involvement. However, there are concerns that any agreement reached without Ukraine's participation would be ineffective, as Putin has historically used negotiations to buy time while continuing military aggression.",
