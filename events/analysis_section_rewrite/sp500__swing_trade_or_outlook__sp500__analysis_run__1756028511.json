      "feedback": "Strong start, but to hit world‑class you should compress to the required four-mover lines plus a tight Swing Trade/Outlook and kill the surrounding prose that dilutes the signal. Actionable edits: (1) reframe to exactly 4 movers (2 Up, 2 Down) using crisp time windows and first‑principles drivers anchored to the material; place one‑line drivers that map cleanly from the cloud/AI upcycle or policy signals to stock/sector outcomes (no extraneous Intel narratives unless you use them as a separate, clearly labeled trigger). (2) make each mover line strictly: Direction | Time window | Driver/Mechanism | What to watch | Probability %; anchor each numeric claim to a source ID (e.g., 21.2% CAGR from 48JXC9VDP, Azure 39% YoY from 0G3A676BP, etc.) and keep probabilities in a defensible band (e.g., 50–65% for Ups, 30–45% for Downs) with citations only after the numbers. (3) Include a single Swing Trade or Outlook line if the asset is tradable; otherwise an Outlook line; keep it to 1 line for tradables or 1 line max for non‑tradables, with: Direction | Horizon | Entry/Levels or Expected path | Trigger | Invalidation | Probability % | Confidence. (4) eliminate the long, multi‑page narrative and replace it with a compact regime map (Regime A/B/C) and a minimal 2–3 watch‑points that tie directly to the movers. (5) ensure all critical facts with numeric support are cited (IDs) and reconcile any conflicts across sources (e.g., CAGR path vs. macro dial) in a brief reconciliation note tucked into watch items or the invalidation line, not as separate text. (6) deliver a clean four‑line mover block like: Up | 0–3 weeks | Policy/govt onshore impulse (Intel stake) | Vesting cadence and term disclosures | 55% (XQWTVR71K); Up | 5–7 years | Cloud/AI capex upcycle led by MSFT Azure; MSFT/SHOP fundamentals; Watch: Azure margin, cloud spend trajectory | 60% (0G3A676BP)(48JXC9VDP); Down | 0–3 weeks | Intel governance risk if disclosures stall | Cadence of disclosures; governance assurances | 45% (XQWTVR71K); Down | 0–3 months | AI leadership breadth narrows; policy/reg risk | Breadth signals and valuation repricing risk | 40% (0G3A676BP)(5S9GJV2O3). (7) append a single, concise Swing Trade line if appropriate, e.g., Up | 2–6 weeks | Intel term disclosures trigger entry; Stop 6%; Target 12–18%; R/R 2x; Invalidation: no disclosures by week 3 | Trigger: milestone disclosures | 60% | 70. This will produce a tight, verifiable, evidence‑driven outline that meets the SECTION FOCUS and maintains high analytic integrity.",
