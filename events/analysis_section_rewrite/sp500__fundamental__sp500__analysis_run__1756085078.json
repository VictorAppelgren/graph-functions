      "feedback": "Strong start, but to reach world‑class, tighten the logic into an explicit multi‑year regime map anchored by first principles and then braid the Ford example through that map with precise, source‑backed numbers. Edit guidance: 1) Build a clear horizon ladder (base case, then regime A: resilience/reshoring tariff regime with baseline tariffs around 10% and targeted China/India levies up (e.g., 34% on China, 50% discussed for some partners; 145%/baseline 10% framing appears in Fox/Trump‑tariff coverage), plus regime B: détente or swift tariff rollback). Tie these regimes to invariant anchors (first‑principles: ROIC vs cost of capital, capital intensity, productivity, terms of trade, and net external position) and to policy reaction functions (SGB2PAZGK; ROIC/Cost of Capital framework from FOOL ROIC articles). 2) Specify the causal chain with discipline: tariffs/reshoring lift domestic capex in strategic sectors, rewire sourcing, raise risk premia in energy/capital‑intensive bets, and tilt equity prices toward cash‑flow stability; quantify sensitivity where possible using the available numbers (SGB2PAZGK; O4ZEED2EB). 3) For Ford, present a base case and an alternative path: base case—EV losses persist (EV segment loss around $1.3B in Q2) with Ford Blue profitability, 4.3% adjusted operating margin, and 10.1% ROIC; stock at roughly 8x forward P/E with a ~5.18% dividend yield, and 5‑year total return lag vs S&P 500 (~33% vs ~267%) (65UUBU0OR; S 22PL3Q360); contrast with growth‑oriented peers (e.g., Tesla/Alphabet discussions in the same car‑stock literature) and reconcile with Robinhood/income narrative (22PL3Q360). 4) Include a conflict map and reconciliation: the Fox/Trump tariff‑centrism (SGB2PAZGK) versus The Motley Fool’s income‑play framing for Ford (65UUBU0OR) and the “total return” framework (D4 sources) to show how risk premia and dividend yields could price differently under each view; specify probabilities, ranges, and how each would alter base‑case pricing. 5) Elevate diagnostics: replace generic statements with quantified triggers and invalidation points (e.g., if EV profitability turns positive or if tariffs escalate beyond cited levels, reprice capex, ROIC, and equity risk premia; if Ford’s EV losses widen beyond $1.3B or ROIC falls noticeably below WACC, revisit). 6) Polish structure and alignment with SECTION FOCUS: separate subsections for first‑principles anchors, regime states, transmission to markets, base case vs scenarios, catalysts/invalidation, risks, what to watch, and confidence; ensure every substantive claim has a source tag (SGB2PAZGK, O4ZEED2EB, 65UUBU0OR, 22PL3Q360, etc.). 7) Tighten readability and avoid duplicative引用: remove redundant Ford paragraphs, quote or paraphrase numbers precisely, and present a concise base‑case paragraph plus a short bulleted scenario appendix if needed (all citations after the relevant clause). This will yield a world‑class, reproducible, source‑driven causal narrative that meets multi‑year horizon requirements while providing actionable risks and triggers.",
