  "content": "Saturday was a day game after a night game. It was expected. Monday was different \u2014 Monday marked the second time in three games Austin Wells was on the bench.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been struggling a bit, obviously, offensively. A part of it is I want to keep Ben [Rice] in there and I think Ben has done a really good job behind the plate, too,\u201d manager Aaron Boone said before the Yankees beat the Twins 6-2 to open a three-game series in The Bronx. \u201cThere\u2019s that. That also allows [Paul] Goldschmidt to be in the lineup. It\u2019s just trying to get the best grouping out there day in and day out to give us chance to win a game.\u201d\n\nCould it be a trend? Could Wells see less playing time moving forward? Boone wasn\u2019t ready to go there. Wells, he insisted, is too important to the Yankees\u2019 success. He\u2019s too valuable.\n\nThe manager still believes in him, but he felt it was worth giving him a breather to get both Rice and Goldschmidt in the lineup.\n\nIt was understandable, considering Wells\u2019 lack of production of late. He is in the midst of a 5-for-47 drought. He has just one homer and three extra-base hits since July 8.\n\nHis OPS has fallen to a meager .679, and his batting average sits at an anemic .208.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of production in there, too: 15 homers, [56] RBIs. He\u2019s had some big hits for us, he\u2019s had some good stretches for us,\u201d Boone said. \u201cBut it feels like over the last month, it\u2019s been a grind for him. Kind of working on different things, all to try to get that feeling. Because I do feel like he is such a capable and good hitter, we got to get him there where he is a key figure for us. Because he really lengthens our lineup when he\u2019s right, with the at-bats he gives and the power he has at the bottom of the order.\u201d\n\nWells believes he\u2019s close, that he\u2019s just missing his pitch. He likes how he has approached his at-bats more of late, even if the production isn\u2019t there.\n\u2022 CHECK OUT THE LATEST MLB STANDINGS AND YANKEES STATS\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just off the barrel on a lot of breaking balls. So I\u2019m trying to put my body in position to hit those as well as fastballs,\u201d the 26-year-old catcher said. \u201cI think I know I\u2019m getting a lot of off-speed [pitches], too, and I\u2019m seeing it well, it\u2019s just a matter of getting my body in the right position to hit a little harder and not at people. I like the process. I can recognize the pitch and I know I\u2019m going to get it. It\u2019s just making sure it\u2019s in the right spot that I want it to be.\n\n\u201cIt can be frustrating, especially when you don\u2019t get results. Working on it for a couple of weeks, and I know it\u2019s just going to continue to happen until I make an adjustment. But making the adjustment but not getting the results, it\u2019s frustrating.\u201d\n\nOne adjustment Wells is trying to make is to trust his hands more, and not be out in front as much. So far, it hasn\u2019t translated into results.\n\n\u201cThe most important thing for me is to make sure he gets his confidence and feels good about himself,\u201d hitting coach James Rowson said. \u201cThis guy can hit, and I believe in him and everybody on this team believes in him. But he wants to perform. He wants to go out there and he wants to get some hits and he wants some things to happen.\u201d",
