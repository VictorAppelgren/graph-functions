  "description": "Hey,\n\nSome time ago my wife got an Intel NUC (11th gen, purchsed in March 2022) that comes with the on-board Intel i225-V (3) network adapter (the [3] is how it shows up in Device Manager). She connects to the internet with a hardwired connection at gigabit speeds, and this is mostly fine...",
  "content": "\u2022 Check internet connectivity. This has not been the problem. I have internet in my office right next door, we are on the same network, etc. It's not the internet service.\n\u2022 I notice that her connection isn't automatically punting to WiFi when her hardwired connection goes off line. Usually Windows (she's on Windows 11) prioritizes connections and switches to WiFi. For instance, if you physically UNPLUG from the wired connection, it punts over to WiFi and connects that way. Plug back in, and it switches back to the hard-wired connection. In her case, it does not switch to WiFi when she loses internet. This makes me think that Windows is not considering the wired connection as \"down\" and therefore doesn't allow WiFi to take over. So that's maybe a clue as to what's going on, but I don't know what to make of it.\n\u2022 When her internet is down, I've gone into Device Manager, disabled her i225-V network adapter, waited a beat, then enabled it again. This restores her connectivity.\n\u2022 I just now updated the drivers with a July 2025 driver pack from Intel. It has only been like 20 minutes with the new driver, so no idea yet on that.\n\nHey,Some time ago my wife got an Intel NUC (11th gen, purchsed in March 2022) that comes with the on-board Intel i225-V (3) network adapter (the [3] is how it shows up in Device Manager). She connects to the internet with a hardwired connection at gigabit speeds, and this is mostly fine.What isn't fine is that her internet disconnects periodically, seemingly at random. She loses connectivity, and because she does a lot of work \"in the cloud,\" this is especially problematic.My problem is that I don't know how to troubleshoot WHY her connection is dropping. Here's what I know, and things I've tried.Is there a way I can find out what might be happening to cause her to lose connectivity to the internet? I have a pfSense router so can maybe look into things on that end, and a Unifi switch, but I honestly don't even know where to look. Hence this post!Is there any other information here that I can provide that would be useful?I appreciate it!",
