  "content": "President Donald Trump on Sunday blasted the Senate\u2019s \"blue slip\" tradition, calling it an unconstitutional affront to his appointment power and alleging that his rights have \"been completely taken away from me in States that have just one Democrat United States Senator.\"\n\nThe president is referring to his ability to nominate judges and U.S. Attorneys, accusing the custom of essentially giving Democrats veto power over his nominees.\n\nU.S. Sen. Chuck Grassley is defending the century-old process, saying he views it as a norm worth preserving for balance and state input.\n\nGRASSLEY REBUKES TRUMP'S PRESSURE TO 'HAVE THE COURAGE' TO SPEED UP NOMINATIONS\n\nBlue slips are a long-standing tradition but are not a codified law, and constitutionally he is only allowed the power to nominate while the Senate ultimately approves or rejects that nomination.\n\nTrump\u2019s frustration with the Senate\u2019s blue slip practice isn\u2019t new. In July, Trump called the tradition a \"hoax\" and a \"scam\" used by Democrats to block his nominees and demanded that Grassley stop supporting them.\n\n\"Put simply, the president of the United States will never be permitted to appoint the person of his choice because of an ancient, and probably unconstitutional, \u2018CUSTOM,\u2019\" his post said.\n\nALINA HABBA SAYS SHE 'WON'T BE INTIMIDATED' AFTER SENATE CUSTOM HINDERS US ATTORNEY NOMINATION\n\nIn his first term, Trump was able to appoint 234 federal judges, including three Supreme Court justices and 54 appellate court judges. However, this term he has only confirmed five in the first seven months.\n\nTrump went on in his post to suggest he was willing to apply pressure and that Grassley shouldn't acquiesce.\n\n\"The only candidates that I can get confirmed for these most important positions are, believe it or not, Democrats! Chuck Grassley should allow strong Republican candidates to ascend to these very vital and powerful roles, and tell the Democrats, as they often tell us, to go to HELL!\" he wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump's comments come after U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann recently ruled that Alina Habba had been unlawfully serving as acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey beyond the 120-day limit allowed for temporary prosecutors and that the administration had been using an unusual maneuver to keep her in the role.\n\nTrump\u2019s pressure campaign could shape how many judicial vacancies he can realistically fill in the months ahead.",

[Chuck] Grassley is upholding effectively prevents anybody in a blue state from going through to the Senate to then be voted on,\" Habba told \"Sunday Morning Futures\" host Maria Bartiromo, slamming the process as an unfair blockade.\nTRUMP EXPLOITS LOOPHOLES TO KEEP ALINA HABBA IN US ATTORNEY ROLE, TRIGGERING COURT CLASH\n\"Senator Booker and Senator Kim had absolutely every right to vote no for me for the U.S. attorney position, but I had the right, as the nominee, to get in front of Senate and to be voted on, to be vetted. I never even got there,\" Habba said.\nNew Jersey\u2019s Democratic Sens. Cory Booker and Andy Kim both objected to Habba being in the role, meaning her nomination would not likely move forward.\nGRASSLEY REBUKES TRUMP'S PRESSURE TO 'HAVE THE COURAGE' TO SPEED UP NOMINATIONS\nJudiciary Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has defended the custom and refused to back down, drawing ire from both Habba and Trump.\n\"Chuck Grassley, who I got re-elected to the U.S. Senate when he was down, by a lot, in the Great State of Iowa, could solve the \u2018Blue Slip\u2019 problem we are having with respect to the appointment of Highly Qualified Judges and U.S. Attorneys, with a mere flick of the pen,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post in late July. \"Democrats like Schumer, Warner, Kaine, Booker, Schiff, and others, SLEAZEBAGS ALL, have an ironclad stoppage of Great Republican Candidates.\"\nGrassley responded to Trump's criticism and calls for the blue slip tradition to be \"abandon[ed]\" last month, saying he was \"disappointed\" by Trump\u2019s posts regarding the custom.\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\"I was offended by what the president said,\" Grassley said during opening remarks at a Judiciary Committee meeting.\n\"And I\u2019m disappointed that it would result in personal insults.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHabba has pointed out that the blue slip tradition is not \"law\" and therefore does not have to be honored."

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump. Trump was previously married to Ivana Trump in 1977, with whom he had three children: Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, and Eric Trump. Ivana passed away in 2022. Trump married Marla Maples in 1993, and they have one daughter, Tiffany Trump.\nDonald Trump Jr., the eldest child of President Trump, has five children: Kai Trump, Donald J. Trump III, Tristan Trump, Spencer Trump, and Chloe Trump.

      "text": "President Donald Trump pressured the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee to end a longstanding practice in the Senate to expedite his nominations to district courts and U.S. attorney\u2019s offices, but the lawmaker isn't budging.\nTrump late Tuesday night demanded that Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, \"have the courage\" to end the \"blue slip\" tradition in the Senate, which effectively gives senators the ability to veto district court and U.S. attorney nominees in their home states.\nKEY TRUMP NOMINEES STALLED BY SENATE DEMS PUTS PRESSURE ON GOP LEADERS\nHe charged that the practice was \"probably unconstitutional,\" and lamented that a president would \"never be permitted to appoint the person of his choice\" because of it.\n\"Chuck Grassley, who I got re-elected to the U.S. Senate when he was down, by a lot, in the Great State of Iowa, could solve the \u2018Blue Slip\u2019 problem we are having with respect to the appointment of Highly Qualified Judges and U.S. Attorneys, with a mere flick of the pen,\" Trump said in a lengthy post on his Truth Social platform.\nTRUMP'S CDC PICK CONFIRMED\u2014BUT HER PRO-VACCINE STANCE MAY CLASH WITH RFK JR.'S AGENDA\n\"Democrats like Schumer, Warner, Kaine, Booker, Schiff, and others, SLEAZEBAGS ALL, have an ironclad stoppage of Great Republican Candidates,\" he continued.\nThe 91-year-old Grassely, who has been a member of Congress since 1975 and in the Senate since 1981, handily beat his previous opponent by over 12 points three years ago.\nThe longtime lawmaker addressed Trump\u2019s comments during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday that he was surprised to see the president \"go after me and Senate Republicans over what we call the 'blue slip.'\"\nWOUNDED VET CONFIRMED TO VETERANS AFFAIRS ROLE AS GOP SLAMS DEMS FOR SLOW-WALKING TRUMP PICKS\n\"Now, to people in the Real America \u2014 not here in Washington, D.C., an island surrounded by reality \u2014 the people in Real America don't care about what the 'blue slip' is, but, in fact, it impacts the district judges who serve their communities and the U.S. Attorneys who ensure law and order is enforced,\" Grassley said. \"I was offended by what the President said, and I'm disappointed that it would result in personal insults.\"\nTrump\u2019s fury comes as Senate Republicans are working to ram as many of his nominees through Senate Democrats\u2019 blockade as possible. Currently, lawmakers are working on a deal to get more low-hanging fruit nominations, like ambassadors, through in a large group rather than eating away at floor time.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nOne instance where Democrats have opted to block some of Trump\u2019s nominees came earlier this year when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., used his blue slip privileges to nix Trump's U.S. Attorney nominees for the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York.\n\"Donald Trump has made clear he has no fidelity to the law and intends to use the Justice Department, the U.S. Attorney offices and law enforcement as weapons to go after his perceived enemies,\" Schumer said at the time.\n\"Such blatant and depraved political motivations are deeply corrosive to the rule of law and leaves me deeply skeptical of Donald Trump\u2019s intentions for these important positions,\" he said."

  "argos_summary": "President Donald Trump has blasted the Senate\u2019s blue\u2011slip tradition, calling it an unconstitutional barrier that lets Democrats veto his judicial and U.S. attorney nominees, and has urged Senate Judiciary Chair Chuck Grassley to abandon the practice. Grassley defended the long\u2011standing custom as a necessary check that balances presidential appointment power and protects state input. The dispute has intensified amid a recent court ruling that declared New Jersey U.S. Attorney Alina Habba\u2019s acting appointment unlawful, prompting Habba to vow she will not be intimidated by Senate opposition.",
