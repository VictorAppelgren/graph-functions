      "feedback": "Your draft is too verbose and mixes unrelated details (e.g., “Fed dovish stance” without a citation). Tighten it to 4–6 sentences or bullets, each with a clear causal link to dxy, an explicit sign/magnitude, a dated catalyst, and a watch‑list or risk. Remove any sentence that does not end with a canonical handle (e.g., “Fed dovish stance” → add (fed_policy) or delete). Add the missing IDs: (dxy) for the index, (ust10y_ust2y_spread) for the spread, (tariff_policy) for tariff escalation, (fed_policy) for the September cut, (us_cpi) for the CPI release, (fed_minutes) for the minutes, (eurusd) and (usd_jpy) for cross‑currency exposure, and (cook_lawsuit) for the lawsuit status. Condense the narrative to: 1) dxy falls ~‑2 % in Aug as the 29 Aug spread steepening (+0.5‑1 %) and tariff escalation (+0.5‑1 %) outweigh the Fed’s dovish stance (fed_policy). 2) In Sep, the 16‑17 Sep cut (+0.5‑1 %) and a sticky 12 Sep CPI (+0.5‑1 %) lift dxy, but a resolved Cook lawsuit or tariff rollback would blunt gains. 3) Watch: Fed minutes, 12 Sep CPI, 15 Sep lawsuit, 29 Aug spread, EURUSD, USDJPY. 4) Risk: lower CPI, lawsuit resolution, tariff rollback. End with a confidence rating (“moderate‑high”) and cite all IDs. This keeps the brief concise, evidence‑driven, and aligned with the asset‑centric mandate.",
