  "title": "This Penny Stock Is Betting Big on the Animecoin Crypto. Should You Buy It Here?",
  "description": "GameSquare buys $2.5M in Animecoin and gets agency fees; treasury upside exists, but crypto swings make this a risky bet.",
  "content": "Penny stocks often offer high-risk, high-reward opportunities for investors willing to bet on emerging trends before they hit the mainstream. These low-priced shares can deliver explosive gains if the underlying company executes well and capitalizes on a fast-growing market. One such intriguing play right now is GameSquare (GAME), which is making a bold pivot into the world of cryptocurrency and Web3.\n\nThe company recently announced it will add Animecoin (ANIME-USD), a digital asset tied to anime production and Web3 strategy, to its treasury as part of a $2.5 million revenue agreement. In addition, GameSquare will serve as the agency of record for the Animecoin Foundation, helping to expand its global reach and strengthen its presence in the gaming sector.\n\u2022 Peter Thiel-Backed Bullish Is About to IPO. Should You Buy BLSH Stock?\n\u2022 As the Glacier Drop Rolls Out, Should You Buy the Cardano Crypto Here?\n\u2022 The Crypto-Famous Winklevoss Twins Are Betting Big on This 1 Bitcoin Stock\n\u2022 Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n\nFor investors seeking speculative upside in digital assets and niche entertainment markets, GAME\u2019s latest move could be worth a closer look.\n\nBased in Texas, GameSquare is a small-cap media and technology company focused on reaching Gen Z and Millennial audiences through gaming and entertainment channels. It owns assets like FaZe Clan (a major esports team) and Stream Hatchet (a live-stream analytics firm) and operates an Ethereum-based (ETHUSD) treasury program to earn on-chain yields.\n\nGameSquare is a highly speculative penny stock, hitting a low of $0.50 in April 2025 before rebounding to around $0.90\u2013$0.95 by mid-August. Shares remain volatile, with a 48% drop over the past month, still up 12% YTD.\n\nHowever, the company valuation looks pretty attractive for now, with a Price/Sales ratio of 0.32. That's significantly less expensive than the sector median of 1.27. This suggests the stock is undervalued compared to its peers.\n\nWhat This Partnership Means for GAME\u2019s Web3 Push\n\nGameSquare's new Animecoin Foundation strategic partnership will be fundamental in expanding its Web3 presence. The company will purchase up to $2.5 million in Animecoin and act as the token\u2019s marketing \u201cagency of record\u201d for one year, receiving $2.5 million in Animecoin for creative and promotional services. Valued at about $180 million fully diluted, Animecoin targets fans of both anime and gaming. The deal provides GameSquare with immediate revenue, diversifies its digital asset holdings, and offers upside if Animecoin\u2019s value rises.",
