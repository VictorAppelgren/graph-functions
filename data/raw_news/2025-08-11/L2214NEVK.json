  "content": "President Donald Trump's trade policies are rapidly becoming a nightmare for the coffee industry, Todd Carmichael, co-founder of the coffee retailer La Colombe, in The Washington Post on Monday. Coffee already began to surge in price from , in anticipation of his tariff threats. But things are starting to get even worse, wrote Carmichael. \"In February, the global price of arabica coffee reached $4.41 per pound, the highest price in recorded history, surpassing the and the ,\" wrote Carmichael. \"That milestone occurred before any tariffs were announced, and though the price has since receded, it remains at . As of June, a pound of nearly 13 percent more than it did a year earlier.\" With the tariffs now kicking in, he continued, \"a wave of panic is rippling through the global coffee trade.\" \"Coffee, much like bananas, is a tropical fruit,\" Carmichael wrote. \"But coffee is even pickier: It doesn\u2019t just need the heat and humidity of the tropics; it can typically grow only at tropical altitudes. These conditions are found almost exclusively in a narrow band around the equator, often referred to as the 'coffee belt.' Within the United States, only a tiny fraction of land in Hawaii and Puerto Rico meets these requirements, making domestic coffee farming extremely limited.\" For decades, U.S. policymakers understood this, which was why coffee was largely exempt from tariffs. But this is all changing under , who has charged taxes on imports across the board except for a very few large companies that have . New coffee tariffs put an industry of millions of U.S. jobs dependent on the imports at risk, he wrote, and threatens to undermine access in the world's largest coffee market. \"Surely, coffee is too essential and too global to put at the center of a geopolitical chess match,\" Carmichael concluded. \"Whether the tariffs deliver diplomatic wins remains uncertain, but their effect on the daily cup of coffee is already being felt and will get much worse. Things are beginning to get very dark: for the consumer, the countless coffee roasters, coffee importers and the 1.7 million people who work in the trade.\"",

      "text": "Arabica coffee futures extended their rally, surpassing $3.15 per pound, their highest since June 24, on concerns over declining Brazilian exports and tightening inventories amid US tariff pressures. Data from Brazil\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Trade showed that unroasted coffee exports fell 20.4% year-over-year in July. This decline coincides with ICE-monitored arabica inventories falling to a 13-month low of 738,095 bags as of August 8. Dealers noted that although the Brazilian harvest is nearly complete, many producers are deliberately holding back their beans. This strategy is largely driven by heightened political and commercial uncertainty, as well as significant production setbacks, with yields falling between 15% and 30% in several key areas. Adding to the market\u2019s volatility is the fact that the US has maintained a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports, not exempting coffee. This has raised doubts over export prospects and led US importers to pause negotiations pending further clarity.\nCoffee rose to 319.82 USd/Lbs on August 11, 2025, up 3.38% from the previous day. Over the past month, Coffee's price has risen 4.62%, and is up 32.24% compared to the same time last year, according to trading on a contract for difference (CFD) that tracks the benchmark market for this commodity. Historically, Coffee reached an all time high of 440.85 in February of 2025. Coffee - data, forecasts, historical chart - was last updated on August 11 of 2025.\nCoffee rose to 319.82 USd/Lbs on August 11, 2025, up 3.38% from the previous day.

      "text": "President Donald Trump has backed off his threatened trade war with Colombia, but that hasn't stopped one of that country's cheap exports from surging in price.\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that arabica coffee prices hit a \"record level\" on Monday as futures for the commodity \"rose 0.8% to $3.50 a pound in midday trading in Europe, having reached as high as $3.56 earlier in the session.\" This tops the previous record set back in December of $3.48 when concerns arose about this year's coffee harvest in Brazil.\nThe Journal's report also highlights a research note from analysts at JPMorgan who write that the increase in coffee futures should be seen in the context of Trump's threatened tariffs against Canada and Mexico, which are the United States' two largest trading partners.\nALSO READ: All Senate Dems unite to send damning message to Trump\n\u201cPotential tariffs on imports from these countries could be much more impactful to both complex-wide pricing and U.S. price differentials more specifically,\u201d the JPMorgan analysts said.\nCoffee isn't the only staple grocery facing upward pricing pressure, as the price of eggs has also hit a record high in recent days due largely to the impact of bird flu.\nWhile presidents typically have little or no power to lower grocery prices, Trump nonetheless vowed to voters that he would get prices to come down quickly after taking office.\nWhat's more, many experts say that two of Trump's signature policy ideas -- tariffs and mass deportations that could impact undocumented farm workers -- are more likely to increase the price of groceries."

      "text": "The price of a cup of coffee is likely to go up further as coffee prices have topped $3 a pound for the first time in more than 34 years. Poor harvests of high-grade arabica coffee beans and a growing taste for gourmet coffee among burgeoning middle classes in China, Brazil, Indonesia and India are behind the sharp rise.\nNew York's July arabica contract hit $3.025 (\u00a31.85) a pound on Wednesday, the highest since 1977 when prices fell in the aftermath of a devastating frost two years earlier in Brazil, the world's biggest producer, which accounts for a third of all coffee. Coffee futures inched lower to $2.94 on Thursday.\nInvestors have been encouraged to buy arabica beans by a weaker dollar, which makes dollar-denominated assets less expensive to buyers in other currencies. They are also buying commodities as a hedge against inflation. Coffee prices have more than doubled in the past seven months. Supplies are running low because heavy rain led to worse than expected harvests in Colombia, the second-largest producer of arabica beans after Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico and Vietnam.\n\"We expect prices to hit further highs on production downgrades, the decline in global stocks and supply tightness that should keep markets fearful of any disruptions,\" said Sudakshina Unnikrishnan, commodities analyst at Barclays Capital. \"This is likely to be reflected in higher retail prices which operate with a lag.\"\nSupermarket coffee prices have been going up around the world. In Britain, a 227g bag of ground filter coffee cost \u00a32.60 in March, compared with \u00a32.28 a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics. A 100g bag of instant coffee was \u00a32.47, up from \u00a32.27. Most of the coffee drunk in Britain is instant.\nExperts believe that supermarket prices will continue to rise, while the cost of a latte or cappuccino at a coffee shop is expected to increase less \u2013 only a small part comes from coffee, while the rest mostly reflects rental and staff costs.\nCosta Coffee owner Whitbread claims the price of a small cappuccino (\u00a32.10) has not gone up for two years, apart from the impact of the recent VAT increase. However Starbucks has started charging more for packaged coffee.\n\"Globally, you will see increases in all coffee-based product prices,\" said Paul Rodin, head of supply chain and procurement at Caf\u00e9direct, which buys coffee from cooperatives.\nSmall farmers are benefiting from higher wholesale prices. \"They will be getting a lot more if they have coffee to sell. It is good news for farmers who were affected by natural disasters and lost their crops. But if more people are planting coffee, in two to three years prices will inevitably come down.\"\nThe latest surge in coffee prices comes only days after the International Coffee Organisation, which represents producers and consumers, warned that scarce supplies of arabica beans continued to \"support high price levels\". The London-based group does not expect that coffee stocks, which are at their lowest level for 50 years, will build up this year.\nDemand is likely to outstrip supply again this year \u2013 the fifth consecutive deficit. The arabica harvest is about two weeks away in Brazil, while picking of robusta beans is already under way."

There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia. Violent crime in DC reached historic 30-year lows last year, and is down another 26% so far this year. We are considering all of our options and will do what is necessary to protect the rights and safety of District residents.\u201d\nOthers have raised the specter of martial law and authoritarianism.\n\u201cTrump watched the insurrection from the White House and thought it was fine, but now he wants to put DC under martial law,\u201d noted Naveed Shah, political director of the progressive veterans group Common Defense.\n\u201cMake no mistake: federalizing the police and deploying the National Guard to DC isn\u2019t about a non-existent crime wave.

This is the stuff of a wannabe tinpot Stuart king.\u201d\nDemocratic Illinois Governor JB Pritzker took another tack: mocking the President.\nSee his remarks and watch the video below or at this link."
