  "content": "The yellow school buses, crisp spiral notebooks and cramped dorm rooms are still around \u2013 but students and parents can expect an element of uncertainty and confusion this school year.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s second administration has used the power of the presidency to pressure university and K-12 schools to retreat from diversity, equality, and inclusion initiatives and support for transgender students; pull back funding from research universities; throttle K-12 funding sources; and crack down on immigrants and foreign students.\n\nThe US education system faces further upheaval due to Trump\u2019s signature \u201cBig Beautiful Bill,\u201d which will upend student loans, school voucher programs and university endowments in the coming years.\n\nAnd then there are the broader economic, technological and cultural changes affecting schools, such as concerns about tariffs and inflation, the rise of artificial intelligence in classrooms and the growing movement to ban cell phones during the school day.\n\nTaken together, the theme of this back-to-school season is uncertainty, education experts told CNN.\n\n\u201cWhile there have been some new policies and a rash of executive orders, I think there\u2019s still a lack of clarity around what that actually means for school districts and for universities,\u201d said Kris DeFilippis, clinical professor at New York University\u2019s Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development. \u201cThere is this sort of chaos and confusion that is leading to a lot of this, even around funding.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe biggest theme that I hear when I talk to people who work in schools is a feeling of uncertainty,\u201d said Erica Meltzer, the national editor at Chalkbeat, a nonprofit news organization covering education.\n\nStill, the US education system is so localized, particularly on the K-12 level, that many students, parents and teachers may not see much change at all.\n\n\u201cFederal law essentially says the federal government cannot direct curriculum instruction, they can\u2019t shape what happens day-to-day in schools. That is still the case,\u201d said Jon Valant, director of the Brown Center on Education Policy at The Brookings Institution, the nonprofit think tank. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be that extreme because it\u2019s just not the federal government that controls that stuff for the most part.\u201d\n\nDEI by another name?\n\nOne of the most notable changes to education under the new Trump administration is its effort to pressure schools to retreat from so-called \u201cwoke\u201d policies, such as initiatives for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, or DEI.\n\nOn Trump\u2019s second day in office, he signed an executive order calling out institutions of higher education for using the \u201cdangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called \u2018diversity, equality, and inclusion (DEI).\u2019\u201d\n\nTo enforce these changes, the administration has in some cases withheld federal funds from schools, citing violations of civil rights law.\n\nDue to the pressure, many universities and schools have changed or disbanded their DEI programs. But experts said the term DEI remains a bit vague, and it\u2019s unclear if schools have moved away from certain policies or whether they\u2019ve just changed their names to something less controversial.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that work has gone away. In some cases it\u2019s required by law,\u201d said Jon Fansmith, a senior vice president at the American Council on Education. \u201cYou have to support students based on all sorts of reasonable accommodations that they\u2019re entitled to under civil rights laws. In addition, no school wants to be an unwelcoming or unfriendly place to their students.\u201d\n\nMeltzer, the Chalkbeat editor, said there\u2019s a lot of variation in how school districts are responding to the increased scrutiny on DEI programs.\n\n\u201cDoes a school have a luncheon to celebrate Black students or Native American students at graduation time? Is there a Future Black Engineers club at a high school? Is there a mentorship program for younger teachers of color?\u201d she said. \u201cThese are some of the types of programming that are under scrutiny and that people aren\u2019t sure will they or won\u2019t they get in trouble for that kind of thing.\u201d\n\nThe first year of the Trump administration has also featured a reversal of support and accommodations for LGBTQ students \u2013 transgender ones in particular.\n\nAn executive order on Trump\u2019s first day back in office, titled \u201cDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\u201d directed the government to use the term \u201csex\u201d instead of \u201cgender\u201d and said that humans are either male or female, determined by biology at conception.\n\nIn February, Trump signed an executive order titled \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports\u201d with the goal of banning transgender women and girls from competing in women\u2019s and girls\u2019 sports. The NCAA subsequently announced an overhaul of its transgender athlete policy to limit transgender women from participating in women\u2019s sports.\n\nLast month, faced with the prospect of losing $175 million in federal funding, the University of Pennsylvania agreed to block transgender women athletes from female sports teams and erased the records set by swimmer Lia Thomas in 2022. On the K-12 level, the Department of Justice has filed lawsuits against California and Maine over their policies on transgender students\u2019 sports participation.\n\nDeFilippis, who worked as a middle and high school teacher, said he was worried for LGBTQ students trying to understand their own identities in this new environment.\n\n\u201cThe executive branch has signaled that LGBTQ students and trans students are generally less safe than they were to exist as who they are in school districts,\u201d he said. However, he noted that it depends on the individual school district and state law.\n\nCompared to K-12 schools, universities and colleges typically rely more heavily on federal dollars, so the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to cut funding and scientific research grants have had a more significant impact.\n\nMost prominently, Ivy League schools Columbia and Harvard have faced the biggest challenges, with the federal government threatening to withhold funding and research grants of all kinds due to what the Trump administration says are violations of civil rights law on campus \u2014 in particular, accusations of antisemitism during protests over the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nColumbia agreed last month to pay the government over $220 million to resolve several federal probes into allegations that the university had violated anti-discrimination laws. The university did not admit to any wrongdoing, but the settlement was crafted to \u201callow our essential research partnership with the federal government to get back on track,\u201d acting university president Claire Shipman said in a statement, citing hundreds of millions of dollars at stake.\n\nMeanwhile, the government has frozen $2 billion in funding for Harvard, leading the university to file a lawsuit to claw those funds back. That case remains open.\n\nThe Trump administration has similarly frozen funding for UCLA \u2013 about $584 million is suspended and at risk, the chancellor said \u2013 as part of what the administration has termed efforts to crack down on antisemitism and protect civil rights.\n\nThe cuts to federal research funding \u2013 whether frozen, cancelled, or never allocated \u2013 have hit higher education of all kinds, from Ivy League institutions to local colleges, Fansmith said. The federal cuts especially targeted research touching on issues of gender or race.\n\n\u201cStudents in those fields who are looking to come back to campus and hoping to pursue research work and pursue that as part of their academic studies are going to find a different environment that will vary from school to school \u2026 but everybody is going to be impacted,\u201d Fansmith said.\n\nA delay in the release of federal funds for K-12 schools has had its own costs, too.\n\nNearly $7 billion of funding was supposed to go to the states for K-12 education programs on July 1, but a day beforehand, the Department of Education sent a letter saying the money would be frozen pending a review. The funds, which were approved by Congress, were expected to go toward school districts and nonprofits that run free enrichment programs, such as teacher education and recruitment and English language programs.\n\nThe White House Office of Management and Budget claimed at the time that \u201cmany\u201d of these programs \u201chave been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.\u201d\n\nWeeks later, the Trump administration unfroze the funds and released the money to the states. \u201cGuardrails are in place to ensure these funds will not be used in violation of Executive Orders or administration policy,\u201d an OMB official said.\n\nEven though the money has since been sent out, the pause in releasing those funds led to a scramble among school districts and cutbacks in budgets.\n\n\u201cThe only rational response to an uncertain funding stream is to not budget it into your spending,\u201d said Chase Christensen, the superintendent of Sheridan County School District 3 in Wyoming.\n\nDeFilippis also said budget uncertainty has consequences: \u201cSo I know a lot of districts have just entirely paused things until they figure out exactly what they\u2019re going to get (and) when they\u2019re going to get it.\u201d\n\nValant said the government\u2019s decision to back down from its freeze shows that federal funding for K-12 education still has bipartisan support.\n\n\u201cThey have broad support across the American public and across Congress,\u201d he said. \u201cThose funds are used everywhere.\u201d\n\nThough not directly education-related, the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on immigration has sparked fear among immigrant families of schoolchildren in the US and a decline in foreigners coming to the US to study, experts said.\n\nFor K-12 schools, immigrant families may be more wary of attending community events due to ICE\u2019s aggressive immigration enforcement. In Los Angeles, for example, parents like Anna Bermudez and her husband noticed other parents were absent from first day of school drop-offs compared to previous years.\n\n\u201cIt sucks, and it\u2019s horrible and heartbreaking,\u201d she told CNN last week. \u201cIt should be a happy day, and bringing our kids to school feeling safe. But the fact that you don\u2019t feel safe, even dropping them off, you know? It\u2019s very emotional.\u201d\n\nValant said the fear could impact attendance as well as the learning environment in some school districts with heavy immigrant populations.\n\n\u201cA lot of people are nervous about what the general threat of ICE and immigration raids and enforcement could mean for attendance rates, say, of undocumented kids or kids with undocumented relatives,\u201d he said.\n\nAs for higher education, a record 1.1 million international students studied in the US during the 2023-2024 academic year, with India the top country of origin, according to the Institute of International Education. However, universities and colleges are expecting a significant drop in international students this coming year, Fansmith said.\n\n\u201cWhat you get is \u2013 both for students on American campuses already from foreign countries and students abroad considering it \u2013 they just don\u2019t know how safe they feel committing to coming to the United States to study,\u201d he said.\n\nThe \u201cBig Beautiful Bill,\u201d the name for the massive tax and budget bill signed into law by President Trump, makes significant changes to the US education system in the coming years, including:\n\nThough the exact details are still to be determined, the legislation has already pushed universities to make cuts to their budgets and pressed schools to consider the potential loss of enrollment.\n\nYale University, for example, said it will pay an estimated $280 million in the first year of the increased endowment tax. The university cited that cost in announcing a 90-day hiring freeze and 5% budget cut in non-salary expenses.\n\nDeFilippis, the NYU professor, said the uncertainty and confusion around the changes has meant students are much less willing to take out loans, unsure of what type of support they\u2019ll get from the federal government.\n\nSome of the biggest changes this school year stem from broader cultural, technological and economic trends, far removed from politics.\n\n\u201cSchools don\u2019t operate in a vacuum where they\u2019re only affected by education policy and education programs,\u201d Valant said. \u201cThey\u2019re really integrated with everything else in American society.\u201d\n\nFor one, at least 31 states have passed bans or restrictions on cell phone usage during school hours over the last few years, according to a tally from Education Week. Spurred in part by Jonathan Haidt\u2019s bestselling book \u201cThe Anxious Generation,\u201d the bans reflect a recognition that cell phones and social media distract from a safe and open learning environment.\n\nThe crackdown on cell phones also comes amid the rise in artificial intelligence, which threatens to upend school education. Will this new technology enhance student learning or just make it easy for them to quickly \u201cwrite\u201d a 500-word essay? Will AI help teachers spend more time with their students, or will it replace them altogether with a chatbot? Schools are quickly having to answer those questions as the technology gains mainstream adoption.\n\nFinally, schools are sensitive to economic downturns or higher prices due to tariffs and inflation. A recession this year could lead to cutbacks or reduced budgets for schools, with broader effects on the public.\n\n\u201cThey are part of the economy, they are part of the community, often they are very large employers,\u201d Meltzer said. \u201cTo the extent that they feel constrained in their budget, that has a lot of ripple effects.\u201d",

  "summary": "The second administration of President Donald Trump has been in control over the US education system under uncertainty and confusion this year. The administration has pressured university and K-12 schools to retreat from diversity, equality, and inclusion initiatives and support for transgender students, among other measures. This includes pulling back funding from research universities, cutting K-2012 funding sources, cracking down on immigrants and foreign students, and potentially disrupting student loans, school voucher programs, and university endowments. The changes have been made in response to concerns about tariffs and inflation, the rise of artificial intelligence in classrooms, and the growing movement to ban cell phones during the school day. However, the federal government may not see much change in the US educational system, particularly on the K-11 level, as federal law prevents it from direct curriculum instruction.",

      "text": "Diversity, equity and inclusion programs have come under attack in American boardrooms, state legislatures and college campuses \u2013 and now broadly across the federal government.\nPresident Donald Trump hours after swearing in this week began making good on promises to wage a war against such policies, inking an executive order banning efforts such as \u201cenvironmental justice programs,\u201d \u201cequity initiatives\u201d and DEI considerations in federal hiring.\nThe fledgling Republican White House also ordered employees of federal diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility offices to be put on paid administrative leave. And DEI is in the crosshairs of Trump\u2019s new Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire Elon Musk, who last year called DEI \u201cjust another word for racism.\u201d\nThe changes come as wealthy corporate leaders, including billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman and conservative activist Robby Starbuck, have decried diversity programs on social media. In step, some US companies \u2013 including the nation\u2019s largest employer, Walmart \u2013 have backpedaled on some DEI initiatives, including racial equity training programs for staff and evaluations designed to boost supplier diversity.\nDEI has also been used to criticize and discredit high-ranking lawmakers and local officials. Most recently, in the wake of the deadly Los Angeles County wildfires, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley came under attack for her focus on DEI efforts in the department including recruiting a more diverse force.\n\u201cDEI means people die,\u201d Musk said in an X post, resharing a local news story about Crowley being the department\u2019s first female chief.\nScott Jennings, a CNN political commentator, also condemned Crowley.\n\u201cWe have DEI, we have budget cuts and yet I\u2019m wondering now, if your house was burning down, how much do you care what color the firefighters are?\u201d Jennings said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNews Night with Abby Phillip.\u201d\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris also became a target for conservatives.\nLast July, Tennessee Republican Rep. Tim Burchett suggested President Joe Biden selected Harris as his running mate because she was Black. \u201cOne hundred percent she is a DEI hire,\u201d Burchett said. \u201cHer record is abysmal at best.\u201d\nAmid the rising right-wing pressure, US workers in November viewed DEI more negatively than they did the prior year: While 52% said focusing on increasing DEI was mainly a good thing, 21% said it was a bad thing \u2013 a 5 percentage point increase from 2023 \u2013 a Pew Research Center survey found.\nStill, 52% of employed US adults said in 2023 they had DEI trainings or meetings at work, and 33% said they had a designated staff member who promotes DEI, a Pew survey that year found.\nCritics say DEI programs are discriminatory and attempt to solve racial discrimination by disadvantaging other groups, particularly White Americans. But supporters and industry experts insist the decades-old practice has been politicized and is widely misunderstood.\nWhat is DEI?\nAmong seven DEI experts and industry leaders CNN has interviewed, most had a shared vision for what constitutes the concept:\n- Diversity is embracing the differences everyone brings to the table, whether those are someone\u2019s race, age, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, physical ability or other aspects of social identity.\n- Equity is treating everyone fairly and providing equal opportunities.\n- Inclusion is respecting everyone\u2019s voice and creating a culture in which people from all backgrounds feel encouraged to express their ideas and perspectives.\nDEI was created because marginalized communities have not always had equal opportunities for jobs or felt a sense of belonging in majority-White corporate settings, said Daniel Oppong, founder of The Courage Collective, a consultancy that advises companies on DEI.\n\u201cThat is the genesis of why some of these programs exist,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an attempt to try to create workplaces where more or all people can thrive.\u201d\nWhen did workplaces start embracing DEI?\nThe backlash against DEI may feel like a pendulum swing from 2020, when the nation faced a racial reckoning after Black father George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis by a White police officer.\nBut the DEI practice has been around for decades.\nThe origins of DEI programs date to the Civil Rights Movement, which played a pivotal role in accelerating efforts to create more diverse and inclusive workplaces, said Dominique Hollins, founder of the DEI consulting firm W\u0112360.\nThe Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed employment discrimination based on race, religion, sex, color and national origin. It also banned segregation in public places, like public schools and libraries. And Title VII of the Civil Rights Act established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, or EEOC, which works to eliminate employment discrimination.\nIn the 1960s and \u201970s, employees began filing discrimination lawsuits with the EEOC, and many companies started incorporating diversity into their business strategies by providing diversity training, according to a 2008 report published in the Academy of Management Learning & Education.\nThese diversity training efforts emerged around the time affirmative action began by executive order from President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat. Although the concepts may seem similar, affirmative action is different from DEI as it required federal contractors by executive order to treat applicants and employees equally based on race, color, religion and sex.\nColleges and universities also used affirmative action to boost enrollment of students of color at majority-White schools. But the US Supreme Court in 2023 gutted affirmative action, ruling race-conscious college admissions were unconstitutional.\nSome diversity efforts lost momentum after GOP President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s backed corporate deregulation policies asserting companies should address discrimination internally, Hollins said. In the coming decades, many companies kept pushing for DEI-focused jobs and training in a \u201cpiecemeal\u201d fashion, rather than by creating ongoing programs and dedicated teams, she said.\nOther companies didn\u2019t have the staffing or resources to sustain DEI efforts, Hollins said.\nThen, Floyd\u2019s murder renewed the push for DEI leadership roles and initiatives at major corporations. Between 2019 and 2022, chief diversity and inclusion officer roles grew by 168.9%, a LinkedIn analysis found.\nNow, though, some of those efforts have been rolled back and DEI roles abandoned because leaders didn\u2019t feel fully supported, Hollins said: Companies \u201cwere giving the appearance of commitment without actually doing the right work for that commitment to be sustainable.\u201d\nWhat does DEI look like at work?\nDEI in the workplace can be a mix of employee training, resource networks and recruiting practices, said Kelly Baker, executive vice president and chief human resources officer at Thrivent, an organization that provides financial advice.\nIn 2023, 61% of US adults said their workplace had policies focusing on fairness in hiring, promotions or pay, a Pew study that year found.\nThrivent, for example, has resource groups for women in leadership, young professionals, Black employees, Hispanic employees and military veterans, among others, Baker told CNN in a previous interview.\nIts DEI trainings teach employees how to understand and bridge cultural differences in the workplace, she said, adding Thrivent also seeks job candidates with diversity in their race, geography, gender and industry background.\nMany corporations tie DEI to their business strategies, experts told CNN.\nDiversity \u201cis related to our business growth strategy,\u201d Baker said. \u201cIt\u2019s pragmatic and essential and critical for us to ensure that our client base reflects the world that we are in and the world that we are going to be in.\u201d\nWhat are critics saying?\nIn recent years, DEI has become a social and political lightning rod for lawmakers, corporate leaders and conservative activists who have sought to cast such initiatives as unfair and even racist, with some emboldened by the Supreme Court\u2019s gutting of affirmative action.\n\u201cThese are not neutral programs to increase demographic diversity; they are political programs that use taxpayer resources to advance a specific partisan orthodoxy,\u201d outspoken DEI critic Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, wrote in a 2023 New York Times op-ed.\nIndeed, the ideology behind DEI is \u201cfundamentally anti-American,\u201d said Ryan P. Williams, president of The Claremont Institute, a conservative think tank.\n\u201cThe words that the acronym \u2018DEI\u2019 represent sound nice, but it is nothing more than affirmative action and racial preferences by a different name, a system that features racial headcounts and arbitrarily assigned roles of \u2018oppressor\u2019 and \u2018oppressed\u2019 groups in America,\u201d Williams said in an emailed statement. \u201cIf we continue to do democracy this way, it will only end in acrimony, strife, resentment, and American collapse.\u201d\nSome critics argue DEI programs on college campuses have failed to protect Jewish students and faculty from antisemitic bullying and harassment. A 2024 Stanford University report highlighted a case in which Jewish staff reported being pressured to join the DEI program\u2019s \u201cwhiteness accountability\u201d affinity group.\n\u201cThey alleged that the program erased Jewish identity,\u201d the report said. \u201cThere was no space for these Jewish employees to share their lived experience, to raise their concerns about anti-Semitism.\u201d\nAckman, the billionaire investor, last year posted a 4,000-word opus on X criticizing DEI as \u201cinherently a racist and illegal movement in its implementation even if it purports to work on behalf of the so-called oppressed.\u201d Musk, the Trump confidant and billionaire Tesla and SpaceX CEO, later reposted it on X, which he owns.\n\u201cDEI is just another word for racism. Shame on anyone who uses it,\u201d Musk wrote, later doubling down: \u201cDEI, because it discriminates on the basis of race, gender and many other factors, is not merely immoral, it is also illegal.\u201d\nTesla since then omitted all language regarding minority workers and outreach to minority communities in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.\nWho\u2019s defending DEI practices?\nNot every business leader agrees: Mark Cuban, billionaire and minority owner of the Dallas Mavericks, pushed back on Musk\u2019s posts in a thread defending DEI.\n\u201cThe loss of DEI-Phobic companies is my gain,\u201d Cuban wrote. \u201cHaving a workforce that is diverse and representative of your stakeholders is good for business.\u201d\nCompanies turning their backs on strategies to promote diversity will limit equal opportunities for people who face disadvantages because of their skin color, the neighborhood they grew up in, the quality of schools they attended and other forces beyond their control, two Black pioneering business leaders \u2013 former Merck CEO Ken Frazier and former American Express CEO Ken Chenault \u2013 told CNN.\n\u201cAt its best, DEI is about developing talent, measuring it in a fair way and finding hidden talent and disadvantaged talent in a world where not everybody has an equal chance to exhibit their abilities,\u201d Frazier said.\nCNN\u2019s Michelle Krupa, Donald Judd, Katelyn Polantz, Dakin Andone and Nathaniel Meyersohn contributed to this report."

Why are you crying, mom?\u2019\u201d\nShe has been crying, she said, because she knows that the glue that keeps it all together \u2014 a nonprofit program that allows her son to have a safe place to stay, warm meals and a chance to learn English \u2014 is being targeted by the Trump administration. She declined to give her last name, citing privacy concerns amid the current political climate.\nAspire Afterschool Learning, where Gabriel spends his days during the summer school break in Arlington, Virginia, is one of more than 10,000 summer and after-school programs across the country that has been pushed into a state of perilous uncertainty after the Department of Education abruptly paused the grant it depends on to keep things running.\nThe fund, called 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC), is a federal program that was among a huge swath of nearly $7 billion of education grants that the department suddenly froze this month, with little notice. An OMB spokesperson told CNN on Saturday, after the publication of this article, that the programmatic review is over for 21st CCLC.\n\u201cFunds will be released to the states. Guardrails have been put in place to ensure these funds are not used in violation of Executive Orders,\u201d the OMB spokesperson said without providing other details on the freeze or the other grant money that was frozen.\nThe halt came amid a review that alleged the money was being used to promote \u201cleftwing\u201d ideologies. It comes as the Trump administration is seeking to dismantle the Department of Education, with mass layoffs underway and severe funding cuts under consideration.\nMuch of the money goes towards programs that serve some of the US\u2019 poorest children.\nOn Monday, some two dozen Democratic-led states sued the Department of Education in federal court to release the funds, which had already been approved by Congress and were supposed to have been disbursed to the states on July 1st.\nBut the squeeze is already forcing many summer programs to scramble to stay open, even as schools and educational schemes are bracing for deeper impacts in the fall.\nSudden freeze, immediate impacts\nThe paused funding for K-12 programs included money for teacher education and recruitment, English language programs, student enrichment and nonprofit learning centers that partner with schools, among other initiatives.\nThey are delivered through grant programs like 21st CCLC, with state education agencies distributing the money to grantees, including school districts and nonprofits that run free enrichment programs or work with schools to put on programming throughout the year.\nOne day prior to the date the funds were to be released, the Department of Education instead sent a letter saying that money is not coming, pending a review.\n\u201cThe Department will not be issuing Grant Award Notifications obligating funds for these programs on July 1 prior to completing that review,\u201d it said. \u201cThe Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President\u2019s priorities and the Department\u2019s statutory responsibilities.\u201d\nThe impact of the freeze is already being felt as it has caused many programs to question whether they will be able to stay open this summer.\n\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re punishing a whole lot of students,\u201d said Paula Fynboh, who runs Aspire, which provides programming throughout the year.\nShe is cobbling together money to keep the summer school running through student-run lemonade stands and other fundraising efforts. But if the money continues to be withheld come the fall, she will have to tell 25 families now in the program that their children will not be able to return.\nMany nonprofits are facing similar odds. \u201cThey can try and keep their doors open an extra few days and extra few weeks and maybe if they\u2019re lucky they have rainy day fund but you know that\u2019s a Band-Aid that isn\u2019t going to last forever,\u201d said Jodi Grant, executive director of the Afterschool Alliance, a national nonprofit advocacy organization.\n\u201cIf these funds are blocked, the fallout will be swift and devastating,\u201d said Jim Clark, president and CEO of the Boys & Girls Club of America, the nation\u2019s largest after-school youth program. Many sites are also in the midst of running their summer camps and programs, and nearly a fifth (17%) of the Boys and Girls Club network is funded by the 21st CCLC grant, according to the Afterschool Alliance.\nUp to 926 Boys & Girls Club centers, serving more than 220,000 kids, could be forced to close if the funds are not released, Clark said. Many of them are from underserved communities, and \u201cwill lose access to essential supports like healthy meals, caring mentors, and safe spaces during the most vulnerable hours of the day,\u201d he added.\nAddie Nardi, who runs a Boys & Girls Club in a rural part of Maryland about 90 minutes from Washington, DC, said the sudden funding freeze this month felt like \u201ca kick to the gut\u201d\u2014 but the shock was \u201csecondary, almost, to the concern of how we were going to be able to continue to serve these kids.\u201d\nIf the funds don\u2019t come through, the site will likely permanently close, leaving elementary students and their families without one of their only options for support in the area, Nardi said.\nThere is no timeline for when the Department of Education review will be completed and if the money will ever start up again.\nThe impetus for the pause came from the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which described it as part of an \u201congoing programmatic review of education funding.\u201d\nIn a statement, OMB raised concerns about how some of the funds may have been used by schools.\n\u201cInitial findings show that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda. In one case, NY public schools used English Language Acquisition funds to promote illegal immigrant advocacy organizations. In another, Washington state used funds to direct illegal immigrants towards scholarships intended for American students. In yet another, School Improvement funds were used to conduct a seminar on \u2018queer resistance in the arts.\u2019\u201d\nOMB did not provide documentation about their claims when asked by CNN.\nGrant, of Afterschool Alliance, says the move feels extreme.\n\u201cNobody even knows what they\u2019re reviewing,\u201d Grant said, \u201cIf there\u2019s a specific program that they\u2019re concerned about, they should be investigating that program but not holding up funding for all of these other kids across the country.\u201d\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers union, said the freeze of funds already approved by Congress for this summer is particularly damaging. The Department of Education\u2019s move is \u201churting children and creating chaos,\u201d she said.\nMore troubles ahead\nBeyond the immediate threat to summer schools vying to stay open now, school districts and nonprofit education programs are bracing for more hardship into the school year.\nAccording to an analysis by the New America Foundation, a Washington, DC, think tank, school districts will lose an average of $220,289 if the funds continue to be withheld. Some stand to lose millions, with the poorest districts suffering the most.\n\u201cDistricts serving high-poverty student populations (those where over 25 percent of children live in poverty) will lose over five times as much funding per pupil as low-poverty school districts (those where fewer than 10 percent of children live in poverty),\u201d according to New America\u2019s analysis. \u201cThe 100 school districts facing the biggest cuts on a per-pupil basis have an average child poverty rate of 24.4 percent, much higher than the national average of 15.3 percent.\u201d\nMany school districts work with outside organizations to use federal grants to run after-school care or offer academic support for children from low-income families.\nAspire in Virginia, for example, runs after-school programs at a community center and two local schools that serve many low-income families. Ninety-nine percent of Aspire\u2019s students are from families of color, and more than 90% are living below the poverty line. Over three-quarters speak a language other than English at home.\nColorful posters line the walls at the community center where Aspire holds its programs, available to kids from 3rd to 8th grade. In one room, an arts and crafts project making masks was taking place, and in another, it was \u201cpirate day\u201d where teachers dressed as pirates were fielding questions.\nSome students and former students who have come back as volunteers are serving snacks: On the day CNN visited, it was pineapples and blueberry muffins.\nThe program regularly wraps up and discreetly sends home any leftovers to families in the program who would otherwise go without food.\nKids who participate in the program earn points for academic and social achievements \u2014 and the difference it makes shows. \u201cI feel, like, happy because I now, I know how to read,\u201d shared Monserrat, a little girl from Bolivia who is entering 4th grade in the fall.\nShe joined Aspire a year ago, when her family moved to the US. She likes Aspire more than her regular school, she said, because she feels more competent and gets extra support.\nApril, a rising 4th grader, said that Aspire helped her with her English, and now, she even helps translate for her parents. (April and Monserrat\u2019s parents asked that their last names not be used to protect their privacy.)\nWhen asked for thoughts on their experiences at Aspire, the girls raised both arms high above their heads, with two enthusiastic thumbs-up, flashing wide smiles.\nThe states suing the Department of Education are asking the court to issue a preliminary injunction to unfreeze the funds immediately in at least some states.\nFynboh said she fears the day Aspire will have to close.\n\u201cWalking by an empty classroom every day is going to be hard,\u201d said Fynboh. \u201cWe know these kids and we know their parents, their faces, their names, their stories, their gifts, their talents, and we know which ones are going to lose access to the program. And that\u2019s just heartbreaking.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

      "text": "The Justice Department is suing Maine over its refusal to comply with President Donald Trump\u2019s ban on transgender athletes in high school sports, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced Wednesday.\nThe lawsuit, which alleges that Maine is violating Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination at schools that receive federal aid, is the latest action in a public feud between the Trump administration and Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat.\n\u201cWe have exhausted every other remedy,\u201d Bondi said Wednesday of the suit. \u201cWe tried to get Maine to comply. We don\u2019t like standing up here and filing lawsuits, we want to get states to comply with us.\u201d\n\u201cThe undeniable physiological differences between males and females provide boys with inherent advantages in strength, speed, and physicality that pre-determine the outcome of athletic contests,\u201d the lawsuit, filed in federal court in Maine, reads.\nIt continues, \u201cthe results are stark: girls are displaced from podiums, lose opportunities for advancement to regional and national competitions, and miss out on critical visibility for college scholarships and recognition.\u201d\nEarly in his administration, Trump threatened to strip Maine of its federal funding should the state not comply with his directive, entitled \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports. Bondi sent letters soon after to Maine, California, and Minnesota earlier this year, saying that the Justice Department \u201cwill defend women and does not tolerate state officials who ignore federal law.\u201d\nMaine has faced the challenge on several fronts. Last month, the US Department of Education concluded the Maine Department of Education violated Title IX by allowing transgender girls to participate on girls\u2019 sports teams. The US Department of Education referred its findings to DOJ, Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said Wednesday.\nThe Justice Department this month also pulled more than $1.5 million in federal grants from the state\u2019s department of corrections, according to DOJ, over a transgender woman\u2019s placement in a women\u2019s correctional facility. And Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said earlier this month that the Department of Agriculture was pausing some funds for Maine educational programs because of what she described as Maine\u2019s failure to comply with the Title IX law.\nStill, the state has not backed down from its policies. Mills has also rebuffed threats of continuing lawsuits, telling the president: \u201csee you in court.\u201d\nThe state last week secured an emergency court order requiring that USDA unfreeze the funding \u2013 which supported the state\u2019s Children Nutrition program \u2013 with the court finding the administration failed to go through the proper regulatory procedures in its mauver against Maine.\nAt Wednesday\u2019s news conference announcing the suit, Bondi said that the DOJ is also asking a judge to \u201chave the titles return to the young women who rightfully won these sports,\u201d adding that the department is also \u201cconsidering whether to retroactively pull all the funding that they have received for not complying in the past.\u201d\nThe news conference also featured Riley Gaines, a former college athlete and outspoken critic of the inclusion of trans women in women\u2019s sports. Gaines tied transgender swimmer Lia Thomas for fifth place in the women\u2019s 200-meter freestyle final at the 2022 NCAA swimming and diving championships.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

The administration previously announced the release of $1.3 billion of the frozen funds.\n\u201cGuardrails are in place to ensure these funds will not be used in violation of Executive Orders or administration policy,\u201d the official added.\nThe nearly monthlong pause in critical funding set off a scramble in schools as they prepare for the fall and summer camps, which faced immediate impacts, with many worried about being able to keep their doors open for the duration of the summer.\nThe funding for K-12 programs included money for teacher education and recruitment, English language programs, student enrichment and nonprofit learning centers that partner with schools, among other initiatives.\nMuch of the money goes towards programs that serve some of the US\u2019 poorest children.\nA day before the funds were to be released, the Department of Education instead sent a letter to programs, saying that money was being held, pending a review.\n\u201cThe Department will not be issuing Grant Award Notifications obligating funds for these programs on July 1 prior to completing that review,\u201d the email to recipients said. \u201cThe Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President\u2019s priorities and the Department\u2019s statutory responsibilities.\u201d\nThe administration alleged the money was being used to promote \u201cleftwing\u201d ideologies and was conducting a review. It comes as the Trump administration is seeking to dismantle the Department of Education, with mass layoffs underway and severe funding cuts under consideration.\nLast week, after much outrage at summer camps and non-profits like the Boys and Girls Club that were facing immediate impacts of the frozen funds, the Office of Management and Budget decided to release the hold on $1.3 billion of the nearly $6 billion in funding that goes to 21st Century Community Learning Centers (21st CCLC) \u2013 affecting summer camp and after-school programs.\nBut the rest of the funds were still frozen, until now.\nEarlier this month, some two dozen Democratic-led states sued the Department of Education in federal court to release the funds, which had already been approved by Congress."

      "text": "For more than a decade, Chinese students have flocked to the United States, drawn by the prestige of an overseas education and the glamor of the American Dream. Education consultancies flourished across China, with parents paying big bucks for tutors and classes that promised to send their children abroad.\nBut that\u2019s changing now \u2013 and recent statistics suggest the allure may be wearing off.\nDuring the last academic year, students from India became the largest group of international students in American higher education \u2013 knocking China off the top seat for the first time since 2009, according to figures released Monday by the US State Department and the nonprofit Institute of International Education.\nChina was still a major source, making up one fourth of all international students, compared to India\u2019s 29%, the report found.\nBut experts say the decline reflects significant shifts in both policy and public perception, with many Chinese students and families worrying about safety, racism and discrimination, and immigration difficulties \u2013 especially as more options open up in other countries, including in China itself.\nMeanwhile, India overtook China as the world\u2019s most populous country last year, and more than 40% of Indians are under 25 \u2013 prompting hopes of a youthful new engine for the global economy just as China\u2019s population begins to dwindle and age. There were more than 331,600 Indian students in the US last academic year, according to the State Department.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing from both sides, Chinese students studying in America and American students studying in China, the numbers are going down,\u201d said Mallie Prytherch, a researcher at the University of Hong Kong\u2019s Centre on Contemporary China and the World, who interviewed Beijing university students on their views toward the US during the pandemic.\nFor many Chinese students, \u201ctheir parents, their teachers, had said, \u2018Go to America, study, maybe you can even stay \u2013 you\u2019ll get a good job, have a good life,\u2019\u201d she added. But the \u201conslaught\u201d of racism and anti-Asian hate crimes during Donald Trump\u2019s first presidency and the Covid-19 pandemic meant students became \u201cdisillusioned with this idea of the American Dream,\u201d she said.\nA changing China\nIt was a different world in the late 2000s and early 2010s, when Chinese students first began surging overseas.\nAt the time, China was rapidly transforming from a poverty-stricken nation to an economic superpower, thanks to an \u201copening up\u201d initiative that began in the late 1970s and saw sweeping reforms.\nIt also changed China\u2019s relationship with the world. After China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001 and hosted a tremendously successful Olympic Games in 2008, \u201cthere was this upturn in US-China relations \u2013 everyone had a really optimistic view of what China could be,\u201d said Prytherch. \u201cSo there was a lot of openness in accepting students into America.\u201d\nMany Chinese families were also newly wealthy in this flourishing economy. There was a feeling of \u201copening and moving out, and a chance to really go somewhere different,\u201d Prytherch said.\nThe State Department\u2019s figures reflect this trend \u2013 with the number of Chinese university students in the US rising from about 98,200 in 2009 to a record high of 369,500 in 2019. That also meant China became an increasingly lucrative market for American universities, who stepped up efforts to attract students from the nation.\nBut attitudes began changing by 2016 as Trump was in his first run for office, Prytherch said. US-China relations tanked in the following years, as the two countries engaged in a trade war and finger-pointing during the pandemic.\nThe downward spiral was reflected in policy, too: Trump imposed an executive order canceling the US\u2019 Fulbright exchange program with China, then introduced a ban that effectively prevents graduate science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) students from several Chinese universities from gaining visas to the US, the world\u2019s biggest research hub.\nIn 2020, the US revoked visas for more than 1,000 Chinese students and researchers deemed security risks. When President Joe Biden took office, many of those Trump-era policies were kept in place \u2013 making it difficult for Chinese grad students and researchers to secure a visa.\nIn January this year, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a briefing that \u201cdozens of Chinese nationals, including international students, have been forcibly deported by the US each month.\u201d He decried it as \u201cdiscriminatory,\u201d urging the US to protect the rights of Chinese students abroad.\nLi Jing, a research assistant at Tsinghua University in Beijing with a master\u2019s degree in cybersecurity, told CNN in June he tried to attend an academic conference in the US but was denied a visa three times, costing him nearly $690 in the process.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s my academic background that renders the visa denials,\u201d he said.\nThe Covid years\nThe number of Chinese students in the US plunged during the pandemic and hasn\u2019t rebounded since.\n\u201cThe total number of students from China has decreased in the last three years, primarily at the undergraduate level,\u201d said Mirka Martel, research head at the Institute of International Education, at a briefing Monday announcing the latest figures.\nOne education consultancy, Education First, has seen a 10% decline in the number of Hong Kong and Macau students wanting to attend college in the US, according to general manager Steven Hon.\nThe State Department\u2019s figures didn\u2019t come as a surprise to many on Chinese social media platforms. \u201cSince the economic sanctions and tech restrictions started in 2018, many (Chinese) students have been sent back home,\u201d one user wrote on Weibo. Another user wrote: \u201cThe only reason I don\u2019t want my child to study in the US is safety \u2014 issues like violence, robbery, gun violence, and drugs.\u201d\nConcerns about safety have only risen since the pandemic brought a wave of anti-Asian racism and hate crimes. And while gun violence has always posed a worry for overseas families, the increased use of social media during the pandemic also meant attacks circulated more widely online, reaching more eyes in China, said Prytherch.\nThe US government\u2019s handling of the pandemic also shook students in China, she added. Although many were also unhappy with Beijing\u2019s strict zero-Covid policy and the chaotic end of its lockdown years, they still largely preferred that to the sense of Covid running rampant in the US \u2013 viewed not only as a failure of the government, but of democracy.\nDuring her research in Beijing, one student told Prytherch: \u201cIn America, they say you\u2019re free, but if you can\u2019t walk safely on the street, how is that freedom?\u201d\nHowever, Hon said, the decline didn\u2019t mean there was necessarily less appetite for an overseas education \u2013 just that there were more choices besides the US now.\n\u201cThe reason why we\u2019ve seen a slight drop in the US is because there have been more immigration-friendly policies in other nations, like Canada, the UK and Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cParents have a lot more options to choose from in terms of where they want to go, and what universities are willing to accept their children.\u201d\nOne of those options is simply staying in China, where universities are growing in prestige, said Prytherch. Many Chinese professors previously based in the US are now returning to teach in China \u2013 partly because of the difficult conditions they faced in the US, but also because of the improvement in Chinese educational quality, she said.\nIn that context, many students no longer think an American education automatically grants them a competitive edge in the Chinese market unless they attended an Ivy League or a similar top university, she added. In fact, with more Chinese students eyeing the stability and benefits of government jobs, some even wonder if an overseas education might damage their chances of such a career.\nAll that said, the US is still a highly popular destination for students, said Hon, from Education First \u2013 especially graduate students in AI and tech, since the top schools and research grants in those fields are still largely American.\nAnd despite the tightening of immigration rules under the last two administrations, some US officials are still trying to encourage the flow of students.\n\u201cI want to confirm that we very much welcome students from China to the US. We have the largest number of Chinese students studying outside of China here. We do know that US universities are continuing to value Chinese students,\u201d said Marianne Craven of the State Department in a briefing this week, according to state-run outlet China Daily.\nWhether Chinese students believe that is another question.\n\u201cA lot of (Chinese students) want families in the future, and they\u2019ve begun to think that China is the best place to do that,\u201d said Prytherch. \u201cThey think, you know what, China is not too bad anymore. At least it\u2019s safe.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Joyce Jiang contributed reporting."

      "text": "The Trump administration filed another lawsuit Wednesday challenging state policies that allow transgender students to play on sports teams of their choice \u2013 this time against California.\nThe lawsuit against the state board of education and the state\u2019s governing body for school sports, alleges that a state law violates Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex-based discrimination at schools that receive federal aid.\nThat state law, the Sex Equity in Education Act, prohibits California public schools from blocking transgender students who want to be on school teams aligning with their gender identity.\n\u201cDespite Title IX\u2019s equal opportunity mandate, Defendants have adopted and implemented policies that force girls to compete against boys \u2013 despite the real physiological differences between the sexes \u2013 if the boy asserts that he is a girl,\u201d the federal lawsuit reads.\nIt continues, \u201cand despite Title IX\u2019s mandate, Defendants have adopted and implemented policies that allow boys to invade sensitive female-only spaces, endangering girls\u2019 privacy, dignity, and safety and causing a hostile educational environment that denies girls educational opportunities.\u201d\nIt is the latest move against states and public schools by President Donald Trump and the Justice Department, who have repeatedly threatened to pull federal funding from educational institutions whose rules run afoul of the administration\u2019s priorities.\nDOJ has filed a similar suit in Maine and threatened another against Minnesota.\nSince the spring, the administration has publicly threatened legal challenges in California over its policies allowing transgender athletes to participate on girls\u2019 teams.\nIn May, Trump threatened to withhold federal funding from California over one athlete\u2019s participation in a track and field competition. Just a day later, the Justice Department sent a letter to state\u2019s attorney general and the superintendent of public instruction, as well as the California Interscholastic Federation and the Jurupa Unified School District warning of an investigation.\n\u201cWhen given the opportunity to stand up for women, to stand up for their civil rights here in California, he refused to comply,\u201d Bill Essayli, the US Attorney for the Central District of California, said of Gov.

      "text": "Part of the massive domestic policy bill currently moving through Congress known as the \u201cBig Beautiful Bill,\u201d includes an unprecedented $5 billion national school voucher program. Republicans have long advocated for so-called school choice, but critics have labeled the initiative a tax cut for the wealthy.\nSending public dollars to private schools has long been the subject of partisan divide and controversy. It has many powerful advocates, most notably former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who served under Trump during his first term. And it has fierce critics, particularly on the left.\nBut congressional Republicans\u2019 proposal, known as the Educational Choice for Children Act (ECCA), goes beyond any previous efforts, not just by creating the first nationwide program but also by creating an unusual federal tax credit for anyone wanting to donate toward the cause.\nFamilies making up to 300% of area median income would be able to apply for, and receive, scholarships to use toward private school tuition, homeschooling books or tutoring, for example. The money would be given out by third-party scholarship granting organizations (SGOs) certified by the US Treasury and IRS.\nDonors would be the ones to reap the tax benefits, though. Anyone across the country \u2013 with or without kids \u2013 would be able to donate to one of these SGOs as they would to any charity.\nBut unlike donating to a church or food bank, where tax-deductible contributions help lower total taxable income, SGO donations would result in a full tax credit, dollar for dollar, up to the greater of $5,000 or 10% of one\u2019s income. For example, $1,000 donated to an SGO would result in $1,000 taken off one\u2019s tax bill.\nAdvocates say these incentives would strongly encourage taxpayers to contribute and that the opportunities could change the lives of kids stuck in failing public schools.\n\u201cWe have what might be a once-in-a-generation opportunity this year to capitalize on what has been a real movement at the state level for school choice by creating a pathway to supercharge school choice in every state in our nation through a school choice tax credit,\u201d wrote Tommy Schultz, CEO of American Federation for Children, in an email to CNN.\nCarl Davis, research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, says the program is generous \u2013 to say the least. \u201cA dollar-for-dollar charitable donation tax credit is unprecedented at the federal level,\u201d he told CNN in an email.\nFurthermore, House Ways and Means committee staff verified to CNN that stocks would be accepted as donations in this proposal. Donors would receive a tax credit for the value of those stocks, without having to pay capital gains taxes that would have been required had the stock been sold instead.\n\u201cThis is unbelievable,\u201d said Sasha Pudelski, director of advocacy for AASA, The School Superintendents Association. \u201cIt\u2019s weaponizing the tax code to destroy our public schools.\u201d\nBut Schultz said, \u201cThese concerns are not in good faith unless those raising them have also been calling to overhaul 501c3 giving overall.\u201d\nOn the state level, there are similar existing tax credits for donors contributing to state school voucher programs. An ITEP study showed that for three states providing data, Arizona, Louisiana and Virginia, more than half of all voucher tax credits are flowing to families with annual incomes over $200,000.\nThe House narrowly passed the bill, and it is now in the hands of the Senate, where its future is uncertain. If passed, the ECCA would go into effect after December 31 and would cap annual tax credits to $5 billion, with the option of increasing the cap by 5% each year. The program would sunset at the end of 2029, unless Congress renews it.\nWhat research shows \u2013 and doesn\u2019t show\nFamilies do need more educational choices, said Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education (CRPE), a nonpartisan research organization affiliated with Arizona State University.\nOf the various studies on school choice CRPE has done in the last 30 years, Lake said results can be mixed. She said study evidence is weak that vouchers result in better academic achievement for participating students. But Lake said there are more positive outcomes when looking at graduation rates and parent satisfaction \u2013 when school choice is done right.\nLake described the pillars that make school choice most effective, which don\u2019t happen overnight: a supply of high-quality schools, incentives and startup funds for great school proposals, a pipeline to develop great educators, and accountability.\n\u201cFolks in the private school world can bristle at the idea of regulation, but in order for families to really take advantage of choice programs, they need to have some kind of information about how the schools are working,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I would argue that if public funds are going to support these schools, there\u2019s also a responsibility for some public accountability as well.\u201d\nAccountability has become crucial, with recent investigations like one in Florida by WESH-TV, showing that 8,400 students had received reimbursements for theme park tickets through the state-funded vouchers.\n\u201cCritics are quick to point to examples of isolated waste being caught and addressed but are more hesitant to discuss the massive scope of fraud and waste documented and often unaddressed in the public education system \u2013 or the fact that public schools caught up in this type of waste often just keep getting more taxpayer dollars,\u201d Schultz said.\nAs written, the ECCA leaves accountability to the SGOs, who would verify and grant the use of scholarship dollars. SGOs would have to be certified by the US Treasury and IRS and would be subject to independent audit.\nParents divided\n\u201cNothing is ever clean, right?\u201d said Bridgette Garcia, a mother of four children who all graduated from St. Genevieve Parish Schools in the Los Angeles area. \u201cNone of these different tax programs or programs within the government are (on the) up and up. But if somebody can actually benefit,\u201d she said she would love to see that happen for families like hers, where she and her husband worked multiple jobs to afford tuition.\nGarcia\u2019s youngest child just graduated from St. Genevieve this June. She jokes that with tuition payments all done, her family can finally get a new car after driving the same 2007 Mercury and 2005 Torres for about 20 years.\nShe wanted her children to have a Catholic education, \u201cwhere it\u2019s ok to say I believe in God and pray at the beginning of the day.\u201d She was also concerned about the safety of their local public schools.\nNext year\u2019s tuition for St. Genevieve high school students is $13,475; elementary school tuition will be $7,550, prices Garcia says she couldn\u2019t afford if she didn\u2019t have scholarships provided by the school.\nBut parents who are invested in their local public schools see this voucher program as a threat.\n\u201cIt is sort of an abandonment of public schools,\u201d said Maria Clark, whose two daughters are part of Daviess County Public Schools in Kentucky.\nClark, who is on the board for the district foundation, said these vouchers would only exacerbate educational disparities, allowing some students to leave the public system while others may not be able to. Many private schools do not have resources to accommodate special needs students or may require certain testing or grades to be able to enroll. Some public school students, including those who are lower income \u2013 without transportation, for example - cannot simply switch to a private school if given a voucher.\nTo those who say parents should be granted resources to put their children in better-performing private schools, Clark says, \u201cMy argument is we can make all of those (good) things happen at public schools, and we should, because we already have money in public schools.\u201d\nShe worries that public schools will lose per-pupil funding as kids leave, even as parents like her already donate buckets of classroom tissues and pencils at the start of every school year.\n\u201cWe have struggled to find bus drivers,\u201d Clark said. \u201cLast year\u2026 we had busses doing two runs, and some of those kids would get to school an hour and a half, two hours late.\u201d\nBut Schultz, the school choice advocate, said that \u201cfunneling more dollars into public schools in America does not equal improvement or make public schools the right fit for every kid.\u201d\nWiners and losers\nThe proposed ECCA would allow families making as much as 300% of area median income to receive scholarships.\nFor Daviess County, that means a family of four making under $195,969 per year could still be eligible to receive scholarships for private school, using the US Census Bureau\u2019s estimates for 2019-2023. For Los Angeles County, a four-person household making under $263,280 would still be eligible.\nIn the wealthiest county in the US, Loudoun County, Virginia, a family of four making under $536,121 could be eligible to receive scholarships for their children.\nThe ECCA does not limit how much an SGO can give a family in scholarships.\nIn some Democratic-leaning states like California, voters have already rejected the idea of voucher programs. If a nationwide program were to exist, it would be the first opportunity for parents in states like California to use vouchers to send children to private schools.\nThe ECCA\u2019s donation process also benefits donors. Typically, someone who donates to a food bank or pet rescue would receive no more than 35 cents in tax savings for each dollar donated, according to ITEP. But someone who donates to private voucher groups would receive a full reimbursement for the donation, dollar for dollar. And stock donations could open up a way for wealthy donors to avoid paying capital gains taxes.\nITEP estimates the bill would reduce federal tax revenue by $23.2 billion and state income taxes by $459 million over the next 10 years as currently drafted.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a danger that politicians will increasingly pick and choose which kinds of donations get the best tax breaks and if your values don\u2019t align with theirs, well then you\u2019re out of luck,\u201d ITEP\u2019s Davis wrote to CNN.\nPublic school systems may also lose money, depending on how many students leave the district.\nDr. Darin Brawley, superintendent of Compton Unified School District, said his district has already seen a 4% annual decline in enrollment as people leave the state, shrinking his budget by about $8 million per year.\n\u201cFrom the initial look at our enrollment trends for next year, we\u2019re already significantly behind,\u201d Brawley said.\nIf more students leave, Brawley worries about an 8% decline, which would result in the loss of $21.12 million and therefore layoffs, hiring freezes and bigger class sizes."

Her hair nestled alongside the medal around her neck as a blue University of Pennsylvania jacket hung from her broad swimmer\u2019s shoulders.\nInside Harvard University\u2019s Blodgett Pool, not far from a large banner reading \u201c8 Against Hate,\u201d referring to the Ivy\u2019s eight schools, her victories in the 500-yard freestyle on Thursday, the 200-yard freestyle on Friday and the 100-yard freestyle on Saturday showed a star athlete going about her business. The crowd of family and friends cheered politely, and Thomas posed for photos with Penn teammates and shook the hands of her closest competitors.\nBut outside these chlorine-splashed walls, her season-long quest for success in NCAA women\u2019s swimming has been pulled into a whirlpool of controversy and backlash.\nWith each victory, Thomas, a transgender woman who previously swam for Penn\u2019s men\u2019s team, has brought renewed attention to the ongoing debate on trans women\u2019s participation in sports and the balance between inclusion and fair play.\nHer face has been prominently featured on Fox News and right-wing news sites critical of society\u2019s changing views on sex and gender. In the past couple of years, Republican-led states across the country have passed laws to keep trans women and girls from participating in girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports in the name of \u201cfairness,\u201d and Thomas quickly became the personification of those fears. Last week, a Republican Senate candidate in Missouri featured Thomas in a campaign ad and asserted that \u201cWomen\u2019s sports are for women, not men pretending to be women,\u201d a transphobic trope belittling trans women.\nYet Thomas\u2019 success has vexed even those who say they support her transition, including some of her fellow swimmers. An anonymous letter purportedly written on behalf of 16 of her 40 Penn teammates earlier this month criticized what they saw as her \u201cunfair advantage,\u201d saying they supported her gender transition out of the pool but not necessarily in it.\nSwimming star Michael Phelps, too, expressed his hesitations on the topic in an interview with CNN in January.\n\u201cI believe that we all should feel comfortable with who we are in our own skin, but I think sports should all be played on an even playing field,\u201d he said when asked about Thomas. \u201cI don\u2019t know what that looks like in the future. But it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s hard. It\u2019s a really \u2026 honestly \u2026 I don\u2019t know what to say,\u201d he said, stumbling over his words. \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated.\u201d\nPhelps is one of many athletes and regulatory bodies struggling to figure out how to include and accommodate transgender athletes in an elite field where tenths of seconds can mean the difference between winning and losing. Amid Thomas\u2019 success, the NCAA even moved to change its policies toward transgender athletes, though not until after the season.\nThomas has unambiguous supporters, too, including from Penn Athletics and the Ivy League, which said she properly followed the NCAA\u2019s rules for trans athletes.\n\u201cThe Ivy League reaffirms its unwavering commitment to providing an inclusive environment for all student-athletes while condemning transphobia and discrimination in any form,\u201d the Ivy League wrote in a statement last month.\nIn addition, over 300 current and former swimmers, collegiate and elite, signed their names to an open letter defending her ability to compete. One of her most vocal supporters said there was no room for compromise.\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a middle ground,\u201d said Schuyler Bailar, who is a trans man. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to slice me in half and be like, \u2018Yes, you are a man here but not here,\u2019 or, \u2018Yes, Lia is a woman but not here.\u2019 We don\u2019t exist in parts. Our transness is not something we can just take off and put over here. We are whole people.\u201d\nThomas has not spoken publicly since an interview with the SwimSwam podcast in December. In that interview, she nodded in the direction of the controversy but did not engage.\n\u201cWe expected there would be some measure of pushback by some people. Quite to the extent that it has blown up, we weren\u2019t fully expecting,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t engage with it. It\u2019s not healthy for me to read it and engage with it at all, and so I don\u2019t.\u201d\nThrough an Ivy spokesperson, she and Penn coach Mike Schnur declined to be interviewed for this story, as did several of her closest competitors on other teams.\nA swimmer since age 5\nThomas first launched into the public eye with a stunning performance at the Zippy Invitational in Ohio in December.\nThere, she dominated the women\u2019s field in the 200-yard freestyle, 500-yard freestyle, and 1,650-yard freestyle races, beating the second place finisher by about 7 seconds, 15 seconds and 38 seconds, respectively. Her times in the 200 and the 500 in particular set pool and meet records, qualified her for the NCAA championships, and remain the best women\u2019s time in the nation this season.\nThat the victories came at three different lengths was all the more remarkable because Thomas previously excelled primarily at longer distances.\nThe Austin, Texas, native began swimming at 5 years old and was a star athlete long before her gender transition. Thomas arrived to Penn in 2017 and quickly made a mark on the men\u2019s team as a freestyle distance swimmer in the 500-yard, 1,000-yard and 1,650-yard races.\nAs a freshman, Thomas set a time of 8 minutes and 57.55 seconds in the 1,000-yard freestyle, the 6th-fastest men\u2019s time in the country. Her times in the 500-yard freestyle and the 1,650-yard freestyle were among the top 100 in the country. The next year, Thomas took second place at the 2019 Ivy League championships in the men\u2019s 500-yard, 1,000-yard and 1,650-yard freestyle, shaving seconds off her earlier times.\nYet the improvements in the pool belied internal turmoil. Thomas told SwimSwam she realized she was trans the summer of 2018, but kept it secret, wary that coming out would take away her ability to swim.\n\u201cI was struggling, my mental health was not very good. It was a lot of unease, about basically just feeling trapped in my body. It didn\u2019t align,\u201d she said.\nShe started on hormone replacement therapy in May 2019 and came out as trans that fall, yet she still had to compete on the men\u2019s team. It was awkward and uncomfortable, she said, and her speed suffered as her muscles weakened from the hormone therapy.\nAt the time, the NCAA required that transgender athletes have one year of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to be cleared to participate. So after a year of HRT, Thomas submitted medical documentation and was approved to compete for the women\u2019s team for the 2020-21 season, she said.\nShe took the year off of school and competitive swimming due to the pandemic and returned for this season on the women\u2019s team, after about 2 and a half years of HRT.\nDespite her success this year, her raw times are significantly slower than they were before her transition. Still, she said she was in a better head space after coming out.\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling confident and good in my swimming and in my personal relationships, and transitioning has allowed me to be more confident in all of those aspects in my life where I was struggling a lot before I came out,\u201d she told SwimSwam.\nA history of scrutiny in women\u2019s sports\nThomas is not the first athlete to be the focus of debate about who is allowed to participate in women\u2019s sports.\nSince at least the 1930s, the bodies of elite women athletes have been publicly scrutinized, leading athletic bodies like the International Olympic Committee to implement various forms of sex testing to determine if women were eligible to compete. In the 1990s, both the International Association of Athletics Federations and the IOC ended mandatory sex testing but continued to conduct medical evaluations on a case-by-case basis.\nSome of these examples have become particularly high-profile. In the 70s there was Ren\u00e9e Richards, the trans ophthalmologist and tennis player who successfully sued to compete in the women\u2019s category at the US Open. Competing in her 40s, she rose to become the 20th-best woman tennis player in 1979.\nIn more recent years, the South African runner and Olympic champion Caster Semenya, a woman with naturally high levels of testosterone, has been in a decade-long legal battle over her eligibility for some events in the women\u2019s field.\nNancy Hogshead-Makar sees eligibility rules as vital to the continued success of women\u2019s sports. The three-time gold medalist swimmer, civil rights lawyer and CEO of the non-profit advocacy group Champion Women has become a spokesperson of sorts for frustrated Penn swimmers and their parents.\nLast month she wrote the letter, purportedly on behalf of 16 unnamed Penn swimmers, who said Thomas had an unfair advantage. The identities of the teammates were not revealed, and CNN has not been able to independently verify the number of teammates.\nThe letter also indicated they believe sex should be considered separately from gender identity during competition.\n\u201cWe fully support Lia Thomas in her decision to affirm her gender identity and to transition from a man to a woman. Lia has every right to live her life authentically,\u201d the letter says. \u201cHowever, we also recognize that when it comes to sports competition, that the biology of sex is a separate issue from someone\u2019s gender identity.\u201d\nIn a phone call with CNN, Hogshead-Makar said it\u2019s important to consider why we have women\u2019s sports in the first place.\n\u201cThe gap between men\u2019s and women\u2019s athletic performance was so big that if you didn\u2019t give women a special team \u2013 their own team \u2013 that they would not have opportunities in sports,\u201d she said.\n\u201cI want trans people to be loved and accepted and be productive in society and be their true selves,\u201d she added. \u201cI\u2019m talking a small slice of competitive sports.\u201d\n\u2018We express our support for Lia Thomas\u2019\nThe anonymous teammate letter did not go unanswered. Days later, over 300 current and former NCAA swimmers put their names on a supportive letter in response.\n\u201cWith this letter, we express our support for Lia Thomas, and all transgender college athletes, who deserve to be able to participate in safe and welcoming athletic environments,\u201d the letter said.\nThe letter was organized by the organization Athlete Ally and Schuyler Bailar, a former Harvard swimmer who became the first transgender man to compete on a NCAA Division I men\u2019s team in 2015.\nBailar told CNN he organized the message of support because he felt the anonymous open letter was irresponsible and bullying.\n\u201cI read that and I cried,\u201d he told CNN on Friday morning at a coffee shop in Somerville, Massachusetts.\nWhen Thomas first decided to come out, she reached out to Bailar on Instagram for guidance about how to move forward with her swimming career, Bailar said. They have remained in contact, though he declined to go into detail on their conversations.\nA trans rights activist, Bailar said the outrage against Thomas\u2019 inclusion on the team was not really about questions of sporting fairness.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about fairness. It\u2019s about policing women\u2019s bodies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about transphobia.\u201d\nHe pointed out that trans people are actually underrepresented in sports. For all the fear of trans people excelling in women\u2019s sports, there have been only a few Olympians who publicly identify as trans among the tens of thousands of athletes who compete every two years.\nHow the NCAA deals with transgender athletes\nBecause there are so few elite trans athletes, there is very little hard data comparing performance between transgender athletes and cisgender athletes.\nIndeed, a 2017 literature review of studies published in the journal Sports Medicine found \u201cno direct or consistent research\u201d of trans people having an athletic advantage over their cisgender peers.\n\u201cIn relation to sport-related physical activity, this review found the lack of inclusive and comfortable environments to be the primary barrier to participation for transgender people,\u201d the authors wrote.\nFor over a decade, the NCAA has required transgender women to be on testosterone suppression treatment for a year before they are allowed to compete on the women\u2019s team.\nYet in January, a month after Thomas\u2019 record-setting pace at the Invitational, the NCAA said it would take a sport-by-sport approach to its rules on transgender athletes\u2019 participation and defer to each sport\u2019s national governing body.\nUSA Swimming then released a set of stricter guidelines that require elite trans woman athletes to have three years of hormone replacement therapy and to prove to a panel of medical experts that they do not have a competitive advantage over cisgender women.\nThe new rule threatened to make Thomas ineligible to compete at NCAA championships in March. However, the NCAA said those rules will be instituted in a phased approach over the coming seasons rather than in the middle of this season.\nDespite the out of pool controversy, Thomas showed no outward signs of stress or frustration at the Ivy League\u2019s women\u2019s swimming championships this week. With a calm and cool demeanor, she did precisely what was expected of her. She cheered on and high-fived teammates, chatted with coaches and fellow swimmers and sped past the competition on her way to three individual titles.\nShe is not even the lone trans athlete to win a race in the same pool at Harvard. Yale\u2019s Iszac Henig, a transgender man, won the 50-yard freestyle in a pool-record 21.93 seconds on Thursday and came in a close second to Thomas in the 100-yard freestyle. The NCAA allows trans men to compete on the women\u2019s team so long as they have not had hormone therapy.\nOn the far side of the pool, Thomas closely watched the end of the 50-yard freestyle race and clapped in excitement upon Henig\u2019s win, a rare display of enthusiasm from Thomas at the meet. A day later, Henig and Thomas struck up a conversation at the far end of the pool, chatting and laughing as they leaned against the pool ropes.\nThey spoke for a few minutes until Thomas took off to get back to her work. She had more laps to swim.\nCNN\u2019s Elizabeth Wolfe contributed to this report."

      "text": "The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, CNN has exclusively learned, marking the latest effort by the White House to shape higher education and extract significant concessions from universities.\nLast week, the Trump administration began freezing millions in funding to UCLA, with the school\u2019s chancellor Julio Frenk saying in a letter to the university community this week that $584 million \u201cis suspended and at risk\u201d and warning of \u201cdevastating\u201d consequences to its research mission.\nOfficials from UCLA have now returned to the negotiating table, a source familiar with the matter said, and have made clear they would like to reach a deal to restore that funding. The Trump administration, in turn, is laying its marker for a high-dollar settlement.\nUniversity of California President James B. Milliken responded to the proposed deal in a statement Friday afternoon, saying that the school is reviewing the document from the Department of Justice but casting the settlement figure as a nonstarter that would \u201cdevastate\u201d the university.\n\u201cEarlier this week, we offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the Department to protect the University and its critical research mission. As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country\u2019s greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians,\u201d Milliken said.\nA draft of a proposed agreement sent to the school Friday and obtained by CNN requires UCLA to pay the federal government $1 billion over multiple installments, along with a $172 million claims fund for people impacted by violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex or national origin.\nThe agreement the administration is proposing \u2013 which, if agreed to, would mark the biggest settlement it\u2019s received from a higher education institution \u2014 requires a resolution monitor to oversee the school, as well as a new senior administrator who will be focused on compliance with anti-discrimination laws.\nThe proposed agreement prohibits overnight demonstrations and calls on the school to revise its policies and procedures on protests. It also requires UCLA to discontinue race and ethnicity-based scholarships and provide the resolution monitor with admissions data.\nThe proposal would ensure single-sex housing for women on campus and ensure athletic recognition for female athletes in women\u2019s sports. The UCLA hospital and medical school will also be expected to stop providing gender-affirming care.\nIn return, UCLA\u2019s funding would be restored and the school would be eligible for future federal grants and contracts.\nThe Trump administration has targeted UCLA, along with other schools, as it cracks down on alleged antisemitism on college campuses. The school is currently under an antisemitism investigation by the Department of Justice.\nUCLA in March launched its own initiative to combat antisemitism and last week settled a lawsuit that accused the university of letting Jewish students get targeted during 2024 pro-Palestinian protests on campus.\nThe proposed deal comes as President Donald Trump and his team have pushed for policy changes at colleges and universities, including over diversity, equity and inclusion and other initiatives. The Trump administration has heralded multi-million-dollar deals in recent days with Brown University and Columbia University, and it remains engaged in a pair of lawsuits with Harvard University.\nCalifornia state Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat, lambasted the proposed agreement with UCLA as \u201cmorally unacceptable\u201d and \u201cmob boss behavior\u201d by Trump.\n\u201cIn California, we support trans people, we welcome immigrants, we celebrate our beautiful diversity, and we uphold academic freedom. We do not bow to fascist tactics,\u201d Wiener said in a statement to CNN.\nWiener, who co-chairs the state\u2019s Legislative Jewish Caucus, acknowledged that there have been \u201cserious antisemitism issues at UCLA\u201d but said the school is taking steps to address it and has \u201cmade progress.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional developments."

      "text": "The Trump administration has released $175 million in previously frozen federal funding to the University of Pennsylvania, a White House official told CNN on Wednesday, following an agreement on how the university would handle transgender athletes.\nThe funding release comes after the school reached an agreement with the federal government to block transgender athletes from female sports teams and erase the records set by swimmer Lia Thomas.\n\u201cWe told them that institutions that violate federal civil rights law could lose their federal funding \u2026 So UPenn came back to the table and asked us what they can do to make it right,\u201d Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in remarks announcing the UPenn agreement Tuesday.\n\u201cWe said, \u2018You have to completely rewrite your institutional policy.\u2019 They signed on the dotted line,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cWe said, \u2018You have to take these steps with records and reporting so this never happens again.\u2019\u201d\nCNN has reached out to UPenn for comment.\nThe agreement comes as part of the Trump administration\u2019s broader restrictions on transgender people, as it steps up its efforts to ban transgender athletes from competing in women\u2019s sports nationwide and serving in the military.\nThomas, a UPenn graduate, won the 2022 NCAA championship in the women\u2019s 500-yard freestyle. Thomas is a transgender woman.\n\u201cPenn has always followed \u2014 and continues to follow \u2014 Title IX and the applicable policy of the NCAA regarding transgender athletes,\u201d UPenn President J. Larry Jameson said in a news release Tuesday.\nIn February, the NCAA announced an overhaul of its transgender athlete policy to limit transgender participation in women\u2019s sports in response to Trump\u2019s executive order.\nThe White House in March cut off $175 million in federal funds for Penn related to the issue of transgender athletes.\nThe funds had been supporting \u201clifesaving and life-improving research\u201d at the university, including on preventing hospital-acquired infections, drug screening against deadly viruses and protections against chemical warfare, Jameson said in a statement in March.\nThomas\u2019 records have been removed from a UPenn list of all-time school records in women\u2019s swimming. A note at the bottom of the document reads, \u201cCompeting under eligibility rules in effect at the time, Lia Thomas set program records in the 100, 200 and 500 freestyle during the 2021-22 season.\u201d\nCNN has reached out to the NCAA for comment regarding the agreement.\nThe US Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights said in a statement Tuesday that an investigation found UPenn violated Title IX by \u201cpermitting males to compete in women\u2019s intercollegiate athletics and to occupy women-only intimate facilities.\u201d\nTitle IX prohibits sex-based discrimination at any academic institution that receives federal funding.\nUPenn also agreed to issue a statement specifying that it \u201cwill adopt biology-based definitions for the words \u2018male\u2019 and \u2018female\u2019 pursuant to Title IX\u201d and consistent with two executive orders on transgender athletes from President Donald Trump, according to the Department of Education.\nThe school says it will also apologize to female student athletes who lost to Thomas during the 2021-2022 swim season. \u201cWe recognize this and will apologize to those who experienced a competitive disadvantage or experienced anxiety because of the policies in effect at the time,\u201d Jameson said.\nTrump\u2019s ban on female trans athletes\nIn February, Trump signed an executive order titled \u201cKeeping Men Out of Women\u2019s Sports\u201d with the goal of banning transgender women from competing in women\u2019s sports.\n\u201cWith this executive order, the war on women\u2019s sports is over,\u201d the president said during a signing ceremony surrounded by dozens of women and some young girls in athletic uniforms.\nSome critics claim transgender athletes have an unfair advantage in sports, but that\u2019s not what the research shows.\nWhile research is limited and ongoing, a 2017 review in the peer-reviewed journal Sports Medicine found \u201cno direct or consistent research\u201d showing trans people have an athletic advantage.\nA more recent October 2023 review of the research concluded that sex differences do develop following puberty, but many are \u201creduced, if not erased, over time by gender affirming hormone therapy.\u201d\nPhysical attributes that could work in a trans girl\u2019s favor, like height or limb length, for example, appear to be \u201cless malleable,\u201d the study said, but it also pointed out that there are no efforts to restrict cisgender athletes who are taller than average or exceptionally gifted physically in any other way.\nThe executive order is two-pronged, leaning on compliance with Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in education programs or activities that receive funding from the federal government, as well as federal engagement with the private sector.\nAhead of the signing, a White House official said that the new action would take the opposite position on Title IX from the Biden administration, which established a rule that schools are violating Title IX when they ban transgender students from participating on sports teams.\nThe Trump administration\u2019s position on Title IX, the official previously said, is \u201cif you\u2019re going to have women\u2019s sports, if you\u2019re going to provide opportunities for women, then they have to be equally safe, equally fair, and equally private opportunities, and so that means that you\u2019re going to preserve women\u2019s sports for women.\u201d\nThe debate on transgender athletes\nThomas became the first transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I title in 2022 after finishing first in the women\u2019s 500-yard freestyle event.\nA former swimmer on the men\u2019s team at UPenn, Thomas has come to personify the ongoing debate on trans women\u2019s participation in sports and the balance between inclusion and fair play.\nThomas previously told the SwimSwam podcast she realized she was trans the summer of 2018, but kept it to herself, wary that coming out would take away her ability to swim.\n\u201cThe very simple answer is that I\u2019m not a man,\u201d she told Sports Illustrated in March. \u201cI\u2019m a woman, so I belong on the women\u2019s team. Trans people deserve that same respect every other athlete gets.\u201d\nIn February, three former athletes at UPenn\u2019s women\u2019s swimming program sued the school, the Ivy League Council of Presidents and athletics organizations, claiming they violated federal law to allow Thomas to compete against them.\nThomas has not commented publicly on the latest lawsuit. Despite her expressed intention to keep swimming competitively after college, Thomas has been barred from international events by the rules of World Aquatics, which only qualify transgender athletes who have not experienced biological puberty.\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport denied Thomas\u2019 challenge to the rule, making her ineligible for most elite competitions, including the 2024 Olympics.\nCNN\u2019s Nicquel Terry Ellis contributed.\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

      "text": "College is the place where many students entering adulthood find their voice. But when it comes to addressing the White House\u2019s ongoing battle with elite higher education, many institutional leaders seem to have lost theirs.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how many calls you have to make to get one (university) president to call you back,\u201d President Michael S. Roth of Wesleyan University told CNN. \u201cThe fact that I can, you know, name the people and count them on my hand, it\u2019s clearly an effort to keep one\u2019s head down and hope that your school will not suffer.\u201d\nRoth is one of relatively few top university leaders who still openly criticizes the Trump administration for its monthslong campaign to pull funding from schools that don\u2019t toe its line on a host of issues, from diversity programs to transgender athletes and pro-Palestinian protests.\nWhile most students and professors were away from campus over the summer, the administration spent the season racking up wins against many of its top targets, with settlements from major universities that have promised a combination of fines, donations and policy commitments in line with Trump priorities.\n\u201cIt\u2019s so much worse, I think, than I anticipated,\u201d said Danielle Holley, president of Mount Holyoke College and another outspoken Trump critic who began warning about threats from the administration before Inauguration Day.\nOnly Harvard University has taken on the White House directly in court, although the school has quietly pursued settlement possibilities on the side, a source familiar with the discussions told CNN.\nFor those who have stayed on offense publicly, it\u2019s an increasingly lonely fight.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt about it that the severe tactics being used by our federal government are being highly effective,\u201d acknowledged Holley, a civil rights attorney who became the leader of Mount Holyoke, the small western Massachusetts liberal arts college, in 2023.\nPresident Trump has made dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion programs \u2013 known as DEI \u2013 a top priority in his second term, focusing especially on transgender athletes in sports.\n\u201cInstitutions of higher education have adopted and actively use dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called \u2018diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI),\u2019\u201d stated an executive order President Trump signed on his second day in office. In a speech to a joint session of Congress, Trump called DEI \u201ctyranny.\u201d\nThe administration\u2019s first major college settlement this year was with the University of Pennsylvania, whose swimming program became a lightning rod after Lia Thomas, a transgender athlete who had previously competed on the men\u2019s team, set several women\u2019s records in 2022 on her way to dominating the Ivy League championship.\n\u201cWe acknowledge that some student-athletes were disadvantaged by these rules,\u201d UPenn President Larry Jameson said in a statement on July 1 announcing the agreement. \u201cWe recognize this and will apologize to those who experienced a competitive disadvantage or experienced anxiety because of the policies in effect at the time.\u201d\nThat apology was worth $175 million to the university, as the White House released federal funding frozen three months earlier.\nWhile many universities have reconfigured, renamed, or scrubbed entirely any DEI references from their materials, Mount Holyoke \u2013 with just over 2,000 students \u2013 still has a dedicated DEI page on its website.\n\u201cDiversity, equity and inclusion efforts extend beyond specific departments and are embedded in all areas of the College,\u201d the page states.\nHolley says continuing to speak out against the government\u2019s efforts to curtail DEI is not a matter of obstinance \u2013 but is critical to the mission of the 188-year-old college, one of the historic \u201cSeven Sisters,\u201d and the first of that group to accept transgender students.\n\u201cAt Mount Holyoke, we are a women\u2019s college, and because of that, we are built on diversity, equity and inclusion,\u201d said Holley.\nMore major universities cut deals\nSince the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s settlement, the deals between universities and the government have gotten more costly and the institutions more prominent.\nColumbia University signed a landmark $221 million settlement agreement with the administration last month to regain access to its federal grants.\nActing President Claire Shipman acknowledged the pressure they faced at the loss of so much money but bristled at the idea that Columbia was surrendering to government intimidation.\n\u201cI actually think that the narrative that paints this as a kind of binary situation \u2013 courage versus capitulation \u2013 is just wrong. It\u2019s too simplistic,\u201d Shipman told CNN Kate Bolduan on July 24. \u201cThis was a really, really complex problem.\u201d\n\u201cWe could have faced the loss of any future relationship in the coming years with the federal government,\u201d added Shipman, \u201cand that would have effectively meant an end to the research mission we conduct as we know it.\u201d\nThe Columbia deal includes an \u201cindependent monitor\u201d to resolve any ongoing disputes with the government over admissions and hiring, an idea that distresses Holley at Mount Holyoke.\n\u201cThe idea that an American university would have a government monitor, not related to what they have been found to be in violation of, but related to their academic departments and the way that they hire people,\u201d said Holley, \u201cI think everyone in the United States should be deeply concerned with the idea that our federal government is attempting to run private universities and attempting to tell those universities who to hire; what they should be teaching in their classrooms.\u201d\nOne week after the administration\u2019s deal with Columbia, Brown University, another elite Ivy League school, signed its own settlement with the government that included a ban on \u201cunlawful DEI goals\u201d and banned transgender women from women\u2019s housing. The university also pledged $50 million to workforce development groups in Rhode Island, where Brown is located.\n\u201cThe Trump Administration is successfully reversing the decades-long woke-capture of our nation\u2019s higher education institutions,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement announcing the deal.\n\u201cWoke is officially DEAD at Brown,\u201d President Trump crowed on social media.\nAs the flurry of legal agreements in the past month has made clear, institutions of higher education are not going to hang together in a unified defense against the government\u2019s demands. While he continues to speak strongly against the administration, Roth says he understands why other college leaders would cut their own deals.\n\u201cThe fear I think many schools have is that the federal government is willing to not obey the laws as anyone has understood them before, and so the lawless federal government is very frightening,\u201d said Roth.\n\u201cIf someone pays a ransom to get their kid back from a kidnapper, I don\u2019t criticize the parents for making a deal,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s the kidnappers that deserve our criticism.\u201d\nHarvard takes strategy of public fights and private talks\nThe Trump administration has been fighting a two-pronged civil rights battle against colleges and universities \u2013 demanding an end to DEI programs that the government says are discriminatory while also accusing several institutions of antisemitism in their handling of pro-Palestinian protests on campus in 2024.\nIn court filings involving Harvard, one of the last major holdouts, the Department of Education has pointed to the university\u2019s own report on antisemitism to claim the school ignored rampant discrimination against Jewish students and faculty members.\n\u201cProtestors followed and verbally harassed some Jewish students, vandalized Harvard\u2019s campus, and posted swastika stickers near Harvard Hillel\u2019s Rosovsky Hall,\u201d a government brief says, citing Harvard\u2019s investigation.\nThe university also released a report on discrimination against Palestinians and Muslims on campus \u2013 an issue not mentioned in the Department of Education\u2019s complaints.\nThe Trump administration says Harvard has been talking to them behind the scenes about finding a way out of their legal standoff, which includes a second lawsuit in response to the administration\u2019s attempt to cancel Harvard\u2019s international student program, a move a court indefinitely put on hold in June.\n\u201cWe\u2019re still in negotiations,\u201d McMahon told Fox News last week. \u201cWe are closer than we were. We are not there yet.\u201d\nBut Harvard President Alan Garber has told faculty that retaining its academic freedom without government-monitored \u201cintellectual diversity\u201d \u2013 a major sticking point in early dealings with the administration \u2013 remains nonnegotiable, according to the student-run Harvard Crimson newspaper.\n\u201cNeither Harvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by the federal government,\u201d Garber wrote in April when the school first filed suit against the government over more than $2 billion in frozen research funding.\nThe fight continues to be costly for Harvard. A federal judge has not yet decided whether to order the government to turn the money spigot back on, causing budgetary pressure that prompted Garber to take a voluntary 25% pay cut.\nWhat university presidents have said\nThe administration\u2019s intense pressure on higher education programs and students has not been met with complete silence. An open letter signed by more than 600 college presidents in April called Trump\u2019s actions \u201cunprecedented government overreach.\u201d\n\u201cWe are open to constructive reform and do not oppose legitimate government oversight,\u201d said the letter.\n\u201cHowever, we must oppose undue government intrusion in the lives of those who learn, live, and work on our campuses.\u201d\nBut Roth, one of the presidents who signed the letter, doesn\u2019t believe putting out one statement is enough.\n\u201cI was glad that they did, but I don\u2019t see many people sounding the alarm that this is an assault on the integrity of one of the most successful systems in America, the higher education system,\u201d Roth said.\nPrivate organizations also wary of upsetting Trump\nAlthough not as prominent as Harvard or Columbia, Mount Holyoke is classified by the Carnegie Foundation as a research institution with a billion-dollar endowment, and Holley says its focus on women\u2019s issues has been a double whammy for its funding.\n\u201cIf you are a researcher in this country, doing work on women\u2019s health, or doing work on women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math), doing work on women in leadership, any research that has to do with women is being caught up in those government searches and is being canceled,\u201d she said.\n\u201cWhen one of our research grants was cut, the wording from the federal government was that this kind of work related to gender is not beneficial and not scientific.\u201d\nBut the cuts have not only come from the Trump administration, according to Holley. She said some private funding sources are also stepping back and cutting grants because they are afraid to associate themselves with a school that might run afoul of the president.\n\u201cI would say that the estimate is about $2 million (in lost research funding), and that\u2019s both cancelations from the federal government directly and cancelations from private funders who fear what the federal government might do,\u201d Holley said.\nReworking DEI, or dropping it entirely\nAt Wesleyan University \u2013 an institution in Middletown, Connecticut, with about 3,000 students \u2013 responding to the administration\u2019s policies and executive orders has meant reconfiguring some DEI programs. A summer camp program aimed at middle school girls in Middletown who were interested in STEM studies is now open to boys, as well.\n\u201cThe fact is that girls weren\u2019t signing up for STEM as much as boys, so that\u2019s why we had that program,\u201d said Roth. \u201cBut it seemed to some boys \u2013 big boys, I guess \u2013 to be reverse discrimination.\u201d\nWith many other schools eliminating DEI programs or making them all but invisible, Holley believes that the quick moves to roll back those commitments, even without an immediate and direct legal threat, says as much about the schools as it does about the government.\n\u201cI think it is a representation of the fact that many organizations maybe did not believe in these principles as strongly as they said that they did, and the government has provided them with an out,\u201d she said.\nAdministration continues fight with new targets\nAfter encountering limited pushback from its Ivy League targets, the Trump administration is moving on to public institutions, starting with freezing hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to the University of California, Los Angeles.\nUCLA is now actively negotiating with the Trump administration over a possible settlement. A government draft proposal would have the university pay $1 billion dollars, CNN has learned.\n\u201cThere is a possibility that this administration, once they are done kind of dealing with Harvard and some of the larger institutions that they may begin to turn to the small liberal arts colleges,\u201d said Holley.\nDespite the millions of dollars at stake in a fight with an administration flush with recent victories, Holley insists her criticism won\u2019t be muted.\n\u201cMy mom was raised in the Jim Crow South, you know, both of my parents survived the Jim Crow era in this country, and I\u2019m a student of the civil rights movement,\u201d Holley said. \u201cIn these moments, I would never think of not speaking up.\u201d\nCorrection: A photo caption in a previous version of this story misstated the month that Mount Holyoke College President Danielle Holley is seen speaking. The photo was taken in May."

      "text": "Seniors, students, taxpayers, children, parents, low-income Americans and just about everyone else will be affected by the massive tax and spending bill being hashed out in real time on Capitol Hill.\nRepublicans call it President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cOne Big Beautiful Bill Act,\u201d but there have been several versions. The latest passed the Senate on Tuesday with Vice President JD Vance\u2019s tie-breaking vote.\nSenate Republicans\u2019 version of the bill differs in key ways from what the House passed in May. Both chambers will ultimately have to pass the same version to send the package to Trump\u2019s desk by his desired July Fourth deadline.\nBut the general contours of the massive piece of legislation are known. It extends Trump\u2019s first-term tax cuts, funds his vision for a border wall, and offsets some of that revenue loss and additional spending with cuts to federal support for the social safety net that helps Americans afford food and health insurance.\nHere\u2019s what we know about how the Senate bill will affect \u2026\n\u2026 people on Medicaid: millions will lose coverage\nFor many Medicaid enrollees, the biggest impact would be the new work requirement. Certain able-bodied Americans ages 19 to 64 who are enrolled through the Medicaid expansion would have to work, volunteer, attend school or participate in job training at least 80 hours a month. The mandate would also apply to parents of children ages 14 and older.\nRead more from Tami Luhby here.\nIn addition, expansion enrollees would have their eligibility reviewed more frequently and would have to pay up to $35 for certain care.\nOverall, Medicaid enrollees could face other changes, since states would receive less federal funding for the program. This could force some states to eliminate certain benefits or tighten enrollment, among other alterations.\nPlus, many enrollees would face more paperwork and verification requirements, which could make it harder for some to apply for and maintain their benefits. The bill would delay the implementation of some provisions in two Biden administration rules aimed at streamlining enrollment and renewing coverage.\nNearly 12 million more people would be uninsured in 2034, with many of them losing coverage because of the Medicaid provisions in the bill, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis published Sunday, before subsequent changes to the bill that the Senate ultimately passed.\n\u2026 people who need help affording food: fewer will get it\nMore Americans who receive food stamps would have to work to keep their benefits. The bill would broaden the existing work mandate to enrollees ages 55 to 64 and parents of children ages 14 and older, as well as to veterans, former foster youth and people experiencing homelessness.\nEnrollees in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, the formal name for food stamps, may also face other changes: Many states would also have to cover part of the benefit costs for the first time and pay more of the administrative costs, both of which may force them to tighten benefits, cut eligibility or make other alterations, including potentially withdrawing from the safety-net program. Also, the growth of food stamp benefits would be limited in the future.\nRead more from Tami about an earlier iteration of the Senate bill\u2019s food stamp changes here.\n\u2026 people with Affordable Care Act policies: more difficulty getting covered\nAmericans looking for coverage on the Obamacare exchanges could have a tougher time enrolling in plans and receiving federal subsidies to help pay their premiums. The bill would increase verification requirements and would effectively end automatic reenrollment. The CBO estimates that millions of people would lose their Obamacare coverage.\n\u2026 people who aren\u2019t on Medicaid, Obamacare or SNAP: may still feel the cuts\nJust because you aren\u2019t on Medicaid doesn\u2019t mean your health care wouldn\u2019t be affected by the bill. Hospitals are warning that the steep cuts to Medicaid could force some hospitals \u2014 particularly in rural locations \u2014 to close their doors, limit services and reduce staff.\n\u201cThe real-life consequences of these reductions will result in irreparable harm to access to care for all Americans,\u201d Rick Pollack, CEO of the American Hospital Association, wrote in a letter to senators Sunday.\nThe bill could also affect those who don\u2019t receive food stamps. A trade group for independent grocers warned that cutting federal support for the program could hurt local food retailers, which increase access to groceries, provide jobs and help local economies \u2014 particularly in rural and underserved areas.\n\u2026 state governments: would have to pick up the slack\nState lawmakers would likely have to make tough decisions since they would face massive reductions in federal support for Medicaid and food stamps. They could try to limit the cost of the programs by cutting benefits or eligibility, but they might also decide to try to save money in other areas, such as education or infrastructure.\nThe bill would reduce the amount of taxes that state and local governments can levy on providers, notably hospitals, which is a key source of funding for states. Also, it would require many states to start paying for part of the food stamp benefits and shoulder more of the administrative costs.\n\u2026 taxpayers: might not notice the tax cut extensions\nMany taxpayers would continue to benefit from the array of individual income tax cuts from the 2017 Trump tax package that are set to expire at year\u2019s end. The current bill would permanently extend essentially all those tax breaks, including the lower individual rates and a near-doubling of the standard deduction.\nBut a lot of those taxpayers may not notice this tax relief because it would be a continuation of provisions that have been in place since the 2017 law was enacted. Some, however, may benefit from the larger child tax credit and temporary increase in the cap on state and local tax deductions, as well as other new tax breaks in the bill.\nHouseholds would see their taxes reduced by $2,900, on average, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis of the tax provisions in the bill. But that figure varies widely depending on taxpayers\u2019 income. More on that later.\n\u2026 senior citizens: would get a temporary tax break\nSenior citizens would receive a $6,000 boost to their standard deduction from 2025 through 2028. The benefit would start to phase out for individuals with incomes of more than $75,000 and couples with incomes double that amount.\nThis tax break is in lieu of Trump\u2019s campaign promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits.\nSome lower-income seniors enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid, however, could be affected by the Medicaid cuts in the bill. They could lose their Medicaid coverage, which helps them cover their Medicare premiums and out-of-pocket costs. They could also lose benefits they receive through Medicaid, such as long-term care and dental services.\n\u2026 people with student loans: would see some big changes\nNew caps would be placed on the amount students can borrow in federal student loans for graduate school and how much parents can borrow to help pay students\u2019 tuition. There would be fewer opportunities for deferments or forbearance. There would also be limits on lending for part-time students and a much more limited set of repayment options, veering away from the loan forgiveness programs of the Biden era.\n\u2026 private colleges with big endowments: would see a big tax hike\nA primary focus of the bill is tax cuts, but not everyone who pays taxes will pay less. Private universities are generally tax-exempt, although they do pay a 1.4% tax on income from their endowments. This bill would jack up that endowment income tax to a top rate of 8% for colleges whose endowments exceed $2 million per enrolled student. We\u2019re talking about schools like Harvard, Yale, Stanford, MIT and Princeton.\n\u2026 someone buying a car: could deduct interest payments\nGood news for anyone buying a new American-made car with a loan: This bill will allow up to $10,000 in interest to be deducted from taxable income.\nBad news for anyone wanting to buy an electric vehicle: EV tax credits, which ranged up to $7,500 and were enacted by Democrats under President Joe Biden, would end at the end of September. They had been scheduled to last through 2032.\n\u2026 parents: will get a bigger tax credit for each of their children\nMany parents would get a larger tax break: The legislation would permanently beef up the child tax credit to $2,200 per kid, up from the current $2,000.\nSingle parents earning up to $200,000 and married couples earning up to $400,000 would qualify. The credit would phase out for those with higher incomes.\nHowever, other parents could lose out on government assistance since many of those with children ages 14 and older would have to work to continue receiving Medicaid and food stamps.\n\u2026 babies: would get a nest egg from the government\nIn a three-year pilot program, every American baby born between 2025 and 2028 would get a $1,000 nest egg from the government to be invested in an index fund. Parents could then add $5,000 each year to those accounts and watch the interest grow during childhood. No deductions would be allowed until the child turns 18. Originally called a \u201cbaby bonus,\u201d or a \u201cMAGA account,\u201d the name was changed to \u201cTrump accounts\u201d over the course of this year. It bears some similarities to proposals put forward by Democrats, including Sen. Cory Booker. Read more from CNN\u2019s Jeanne Sahadi.\n\u2026 workers who receive tips or overtime pay: would get a temporary tax break\nMany workers who receive tips or overtime compensation would get a tax break through 2028.\nEmployees who work in jobs that traditionally receive tips could deduct up to $25,000 in tip income from their federal income taxes, while workers who receive overtime could deduct up to $12,500 of that extra pay.\nThe tax break phases out for individuals with incomes above $150,000 and for married couples with incomes above $300,000.\n\u2026 people planning on solar and wind tax credits: will have to hurry\nThe bill speeds up the end of tax incentives for renewable energy projects to 2027.\n\u2026 immigrants: may no longer qualify for benefits\nThe bill would limit eligibility for federal benefits \u2014 including food stamps, Medicaid, Affordable Care Act premium subsidies and Medicare \u2014 to a smaller set of noncitizens.\nSome immigrants, such as refugees, asylees and victims of domestic violence and sex trafficking, would no longer qualify.\nIn addition, immigrants would have to pay new or higher fees to apply for various programs, including asylum, work authorization, humanitarian parole and Temporary Protected Status, as well as for most immigration court filings.\n\u2026 the wealthy, generally: will get wealthier\nWealthy Americans would benefit far more from the tax package than those lower on the income scale, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis of the Senate bill.\nWhile all households would see their taxes reduced, some 60% of the benefits would go to those making $217,000 or more (the top 20%). These folks would receive an average tax cut of $12,500, or 3.4% of their after-tax income, in 2026, the analysis found.\nBut the lowest-income households, who earn about $35,000 or less, would receive an average tax cut of only $150, less than 1% of their after-tax income. Middle-income households would see their taxes reduced by about $1,800, or 2.3% of their after-tax income, on average.\nThis analysis does not take into account the historic cuts to the nation\u2019s safety-net program, which would hurt lower-income Americans. They would see their income reduced after factoring in the changes to Medicaid and food stamps, according to a report from the Budget Lab at Yale.\n\u2026 millionaires who lose their jobs: could no longer collect unemployment\nIt\u2019s hard to believe, but according to a Congressional Research Service report, thousands of people who made $1 million or more claimed unemployment benefits in 2021 and 2022. This bill puts an end to that.\n\u2026 Elon Musk in particular: not happy\nMusk is furious about the bill and howling about it on social media. Not only does he disagree with the deficit-exploding tax cuts, he would also prefer more spending cuts.\nThe Tesla CEO also vehemently opposes the abrupt end to EV tax credits.\n\u201cIt gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future,\u201d he wrote on X. He predicted \u201cpolitical suicide\u201d for Republicans if they turn this bill into law.\n\u2026 people worried about the national debt: also not happy\nThe bill would increase the deficit by $3.3 trillion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office report published Sunday. Republicans have embraced a budget gimmick to argue the impact of the bill is much smaller. But nobody should expect the roughly $36 trillion national debt to shrink as a result of the package.\nThe legislation would also raise the debt ceiling by $5 trillion to allow the Treasury Department to borrow more to pay the bills that have already been incurred.\nMany Americans could feel the consequences of the nation\u2019s ever-growing debt in their wallets. The bill would increase interest rates, according to a CBO analysis of the House version. That could make mortgages, car loans and credit card payments more expensive.\nRead more from CNN\u2019s Matt Egan here.\n\u2026 Trump\u2019s border wall: could finally be built\nThe money Trump could not secure for a border wall during his first term is in this bill. It allocates $46.5 billion for border wall construction and $45 billion for the detention of undocumented people apprehended by Immigration and Customs Enforcement."

      "text": "Hours after Harvard University faced the Trump administration in court for the first time in its push to restore more than $2 billion in blocked federal funding, the nation\u2019s oldest and wealthiest college made a symbolic bow to White House demands, renaming its diversity, equity and inclusion office.\nThe change was announced Monday in an email to the campus community from the head of what had been the Office for Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging. It nods to a sweeping effort by President Donald Trump to eliminate DEI practices \u2013 designed to advance racial, gender, class and other representation in public spaces \u2013 he decries as \u201cillegal and immoral discrimination.\u201d\n\u201cWe must sharpen our focus on fostering connections across difference, creating spaces for dialogue, and cultivating a culture of belonging \u2013 not as an abstract ideal, but as a lived experience for all,\u201d Harvard\u2019s Sherri Ann Charleston wrote. \u201cTo capture this emphasis and this mission, our office will become Community and Campus Life, effective immediately.\u201d\nHarvard further announced Monday it would no longer host or fund affinity group celebrations during commencement, reported the school\u2019s student-led newspaper, The Harvard Crimson, citing an email Charleston sent that day to affinity groups. The decision was made after the Department of Education threatened funding cuts if Harvard did not cancel graduation celebrations that could separate students based on race, it reported.\nThe Trump administration on Monday also announced it was launching investigations into the Harvard Law Review, saying authorities have gotten complaints about race-based discrimination.\n\u201cHarvard Law Review\u2019s article selection process appears to pick winners and losers on the basis of race, employing a spoils system in which the race of the legal scholar is as, if not more, important than the merit of the submission,\u201d Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said in a statement.\nThe student-edited law journal is one of the most venerable and influential in the US legal profession. It has had several students of color as presidents, including former President Barack Obama, but the review only had its first Black woman and first Muslim presidents elected in 2017 and 2021, respectively. The Trump administration says it is investigating whether authors who submitted writing to the law review were favored based on their race.\nCNN reached out Tuesday to the Harvard Law Review for comment.\nMonday\u2019s developments expanding Harvard\u2019s multifront battle with the White House came the same day lawyers for both sides met in court for the first time since the school sued over a $2.2 billion freeze in its federal research funding, the largest of such pauses also in place at other elite US colleges amid the White House\u2019s crackdown over political ideology in higher education.\nHarvard\u2019s president in an April 14 open letter had said the school would not make broad policy changes the White House demanded of colleges across the country, including eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion programs. \u201cThe University will not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights,\u201d Alan Garber wrote.\nAdvocates for education independence have praised Harvard\u2019s refusal of the Trump administration\u2019s lengthy list of demands, which also includes changing university policies on protests and admissions, tightening antisemitism efforts and requiring of \u201cviewpoint diversity\u201d in hiring.\nHarvard\u2019s funding freeze is likely to remain in place at least through midsummer and until a federal district judge makes her final decision in the case. The school has not asked for emergency relief, and oral arguments are set for July 21.\nThe White House also has threatened to rescind Harvard\u2019s tax-exempt status and its eligibility to host foreign students.\n\u2018Right time to adjust\u2019 DEI titles, Harvard says\nMonday\u2019s letter from Charleston announcing the change to the name of her office was released along with an internal survey conducted last fall that seeks to gauge the climate around inclusion and belonging of the campus community.\n\u201cIt seemed like the right time to adjust my title to better reflect what the offices under my direction do for our campus community,\u201d Charleston wrote.\nThe new Pulse survey \u2013 with more than 10,000 respondents from among Harvard\u2019s students, faculty and staff \u2013 showed only about half of Jewish students who responded said they felt comfortable expressing their opinions to others at Harvard. Among Muslim students who took the survey, 51% said they felt comfortable sharing their opinions.\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly cited antisemitism on campus as the main reason for making new demands of Harvard. While the Anti-Defamation League and Harvard\u2019s Hillel chapter have expressed appreciation for the administration\u2019s focus on antisemitism, they have decried funding cuts as overreach with the potential to harm Jewish students.\n\u201cWe will also continue to comply with Students For Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which ruled that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act makes it unlawful for universities to make decisions \u2018on the basis of race,\u2019\u201d Garber wrote this month.\nThe letter from Charleston also cited a reference from Garber\u2019s April 14 statement regarding the need to be in compliance with the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark 2023 decision ending affirmative action in American colleges. A case at the heart of that ruling involved Harvard and was decided by the same judge now presiding over the funding dispute.\nCharleston, who was hired in 2020 as Harvard\u2019s first chief diversity and inclusion officer, did not immediately respond CNN\u2019s questions about the DEI office announcement. The Harvard website on Tuesday morning still called the office by its old name and still listed Charleston, who said her new title is Chief Community and Campus Life Officer, by her former title.\nCharleston has been the subject of conservative criticism in the past, facing allegations that much of her academic writing was plagiarized from her husband, LaVar Charleston. Earlier this year, he was removed from his position as the head of the Division of Diversity, Equity and Educational Achievement at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nThe Charlestons did not respond to requests for comment about the allegations. An automated email response said LaVar Charleston is \u201cout of the office on leave.\u201d\nHarvard did not respond to CNN\u2019s request Tuesday for an update on the plagiarism complaint filed against Charleston last year. Harvard spokesperson Jason Newton previously told the Harvard Crimson they \u201cdo not comment on individual cases or on the existence of investigations related to research misconduct allegations.\u201d\nHarvard\u2019s decision to rebrand its DEI office follows similar reorganizations at government agencies, schools and companies across the country amid Trump\u2019s crackdown on such programs. In a January executive order, the president condemned DEI practices as \u201cdangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences.\u201d\nHarvard argues in its lawsuit the funding freeze measure is the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cattempt to coerce and control Harvard\u201d while disregarding \u201cfundamental First Amendment principles\u201d and claims Washington violated an arcane 1946 law governing administrative policies.\nIn particular, the Administrative Procedure Act \u201crequires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside any final agency action that is \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u2019\u201d the Harvard lawsuit says.\nTrump administration attorneys have not responded to the allegations in the lawsuit, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said April 22: \u201cThe president has made it quite clear that it\u2019s Harvard who has put themselves in the position to lose their own funding by not obeying federal law, and we expect all colleges and universities who are receiving taxpayer funds to abide by federal law.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Ray Sanchez, Kara Scannell, Nicki Brown, Taylor Romine and Lauren Mascarenhas contributed to this report."

      "text": "Columbia University announced on Wednesday that it has reached a deal with the Trump administration following months of negotiation to restore federal funding to the school, in a move described by the administration as a \u201cseismic shift\u201d in its fight with elite higher education.\nUnder the terms of the deal to resolve several federal probes into allegations that it had violated anti-discrimination laws, Columbia did not admit to wrongdoing but agreed to pay the government a $200 million settlement over three years and an additional $21 million to settle US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigations.\nIn exchange, the university said in its statement, \u201ca vast majority of the federal grants which were terminated or paused in March 2025 \u2014 will be reinstated and Columbia\u2019s access to billions of dollars in current and future grants will be restored.\u201d\nColumbia said the agreement also codifies policy changes it announced in March following the revocation of $400 million in federal funding over campus protests, including restrictions on demonstrations, new disciplinary procedures and immediately reviewing its Middle East curriculum.\n\u201cWhile Columbia does not admit to wrongdoing with this resolution agreement, the institution\u2019s leaders have recognized, repeatedly, that Jewish students and faculty have experienced painful, unacceptable incidents, and that reform was and is needed,\u201d the university said.\nAn independent monitor will oversee the agreement\u2019s implementation.\n\u201cThe settlement was carefully crafted to protect the values that define us and allow our essential research partnership with the federal government to get back on track,\u201d acting university President Claire Shipman said in a statement. \u201cImportantly, it safeguards our independence, a critical condition for academic excellence and scholarly exploration, work that is vital to the public interest.\u201d\nStill, the university has agreed to provide the Trump administration with access to \u201call relevant data and information to rigorously assess compliance with its commitment to merit-based hiring and admissions,\u201d a senior White House official said.\nThe agreement, the official added, \u201cmandates a comprehensive review of Columbia\u2019s portfolio of programs in regional areas, starting with those relating to the Middle East.\u201d\nAnd the school agreed to review its admissions process and \u201cstrengthen oversight of international students,\u201d according to the official. Columbia will \u201cassess applicants\u2019 reasons for wishing to study in the U.S., sharing relevant data with the Federal Government,\u201d the official said.\nPresident Donald Trump celebrated the agreement in a post on Truth Social Wednesday evening, where he thanked Education Secretary Linda McMahon for her work on the deal and commended Columbia \u201cfor agreeing to do what is right.\u201d\n\u201cNumerous other Higher Education Institutions that have hurt so many, and been so unfair and unjust, and have wrongly spent federal money, much of it from our government, are upcoming,\u201d he added.\nColumbia faced financial headwinds\nShipman noted in a message to the Columbia community on Wednesday evening that the financial pressures on the school extended beyond the $400 million funding freeze.\n\u201cWe have seen not only $400 million in federal grants frozen, but also the majority of our $1.3 billion a year in federal funding placed on hold. The prospect of that continuing indefinitely, along with the potential loss of top scientists, would jeopardize our status as a world-leading research institution,\u201d she said in the letter.\nIn her first interview since the deal was announced, Shipman framed the federal funding freeze as an existential threat to the university that needed to be resolved, saying finding an agreement with the White House was the \u201cresponsible path.\u201d\n\u201cThis resolution is really going to allow us to turn a page on a period of deep instability for our institution,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan Thursday.\nShipman defended the school from accusations that it capitulated to the Trump administration.\n\u201cThe narrative that paints this as a kind of binary situation, courage versus capitulation, is just wrong. It\u2019s too simplistic. This was a really, really complex problem, and I will argue over and over again that choosing to listen, choosing to try to solve the problem with everything that we had at stake is not capitulation. It was extraordinarily difficult,\u201d Shipman said.\nShipman said her team weighed the possibility of taking the Trump administration to court but determined that the threat of long-term damage was too severe.\n\u201cWe did carefully at that, and we saw we could have some short-term victories, but we worried we would have long term damage. For example, we could have faced the loss of any future relationship in the coming years with the federal government, and that would have effectively meant an end to the research mission we conduct as we know it,\u201d she said.\nThe acting president cast the agreement as a \u201creset\u201d for Columbia\u2019s relationship with the federal government, describing \u201cdeep deliberation and almost word-by-word negotiation\u201d with the White House over months \u2013 a process that, she said, \u201ctook longer than anticipated.\u201d\nLast month, Shipman described the financial pressures that university was facing because of the administration\u2019s campaign as \u201cincreasingly acute.\u201d\n\u201cColumbia\u2019s top scientists are facing the decimation of decades of research. Graduate students, postdocs, mid-career researchers, and established, celebrated scientists, have all had their breakthroughs lauded by the world one minute and defunded the next. We\u2019re in danger of reaching a tipping point in terms of preserving our research excellence and the work we do for humanity,\u201d Shipman said.\n\u2018Roadmap for elite universities\u2019\nThe Trump administration believes that the deal could serve as a blueprint for other schools.\nMcMahon heralded the outcome as a \u201cseismic shift in our nation\u2019s fight to hold institutions that accept American taxpayer dollars accountable for antisemitic discrimination and harassment\u201d and said the school\u2019s reforms mark \u201ca roadmap for elite universities that wish to regain the confidence of the American public by renewing their commitment to truth-seeking, merit, and civil debate.\u201d\n\u201cI believe they will ripple across the higher education sector and change the course of campus culture for years to come,\u201d McMahon said.\nElite schools like Columbia and Harvard University, among others, have faced intense pressure from the Trump administration to crack down on antisemitism on their campuses \u2013 or face the possible loss of significant federal funding. The effort is part of a broad administration push for policy changes at universities \u2013 including over Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and other initiatives \u2013 that Trump sees as a winning political issue. But it is one that raises major questions about academic freedom and the role of the federal government on college campuses.\nThe White House official touted the $21 million settlement of US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigations as \u201cthe largest employment-discrimination public settlement in almost 20 years.\u201d That money, according to the official, will \u201cresolve alleged civil rights violations against Jewish Columbia employees that occurred on its campus following the October 7, 2023, Hamas terror attacks.\u201d\nThe $200 million will go to the US Treasury, a senior administration official told CNN on Thursday.\nPressed for specifics, the official said, \u201cThis is money that is going to be sort of residing in the US Treasury, but there would need to be a specific appropriation in order to, like, spend it on something,\u201d later adding that the policy focus for the money would be on trade schools and apprenticeships.\nCNN reported last month that the administration was nearing an agreement with Columbia, and the school\u2019s board met in early July to review the terms of the deal, according to a source familiar with the process.\nThe university, which was facing an investigation into its handling of antisemitism on campus, had taken a less confrontational approach than Harvard while it sought to reach a deal, and a source familiar with the matter told CNN that the administration was more amenable to Columbia\u2019s proposed terms in behind-the-scenes negotiations. In June, the Trump administration threatened to pull the university\u2019s accreditation over policies it said violated discrimination laws, the source said.\nAsked about the state of talks, Trump told CNN earlier this month, \u201cI think we\u2019re going to probably settle with Harvard. We\u2019re going to probably settle with Columbia. They want to settle very badly. There\u2019s no rush.\u201d\nAsked how much money the settlement would entail, Trump said, \u201cA lot of money.\u201d\nA source involved in universities\u2019 response to the administration told CNN last month that the White House has been looking to strike a deal with a high-profile school.\n\u201cThey want a name-brand university to make a deal like the law firms made a deal that covers not just antisemitism and protests, but DEI and intellectual diversity,\u201d this person said at the time.\nAsked if any of the schools are inclined to make such a deal, the source said, \u201cNobody wants to be the first, but the financial pressures are getting real.\u201d\nThe settlement was met with support from the school\u2019s Hillel.\n\u201cThis announcement is an important recognition of what Jewish students and their families have expressed with increasing urgency: antisemitism at Columbia is real, and it has had a tangible impact on Jewish students\u2019 sense of safety and belonging and, in turn, their civil rights. Acknowledging this fact is essential, and along with the new path laid out by the President and Trustees, I am hopeful that today\u2019s agreement marks the beginning of real, sustained change,\u201d Brian Cohen, executive director of Columbia/Barnard Hillel, said.\nThis story has been updated with additional details."

      "text": "By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:\nSection 1. Purpose. Longstanding Federal civil-rights laws protect individual Americans from discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. These civil-rights protections serve as a bedrock supporting equality of opportunity for all Americans. As President, I have a solemn duty to ensure that these laws are enforced for the benefit of all Americans.\nYet today, roughly 60 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, critical and influential institutions of American society, including the Federal Government, major corporations, financial institutions, the medical industry, large commercial airlines, law enforcement agencies, and institutions of higher education have adopted and actively use dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences under the guise of so-called \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d (DEI) or \u201cdiversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility\u201d (DEIA) that can violate the civil-rights laws of this Nation.\nIllegal DEI and DEIA policies not only violate the text and spirit of our longstanding Federal civil-rights laws, they also undermine our national unity, as they deny, discredit, and undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system. Hardworking Americans who deserve a shot at the American Dream should not be stigmatized, demeaned, or shut out of opportunities because of their race or sex.\nThese illegal DEI and DEIA policies also threaten the safety of American men, women, and children across the Nation by diminishing the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work, and determination when selecting people for jobs and services in key sectors of American society, including all levels of government, and the medical, aviation, and law-enforcement communities. Yet in case after tragic case, the American people have witnessed first-hand the disastrous consequences of illegal, pernicious discrimination that has prioritized how people were born instead of what they were capable of doing.\nThe Federal Government is charged with enforcing our civil-rights laws. The purpose of this order is to ensure that it does so by ending illegal preferences and discrimination.\nSec. 2. Policy. It is the policy of the United States to protect the civil rights of all Americans and to promote individual initiative, excellence, and hard work. I therefore order all executive departments and agencies (agencies) to terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs, activities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and requirements. I further order all agencies to enforce our longstanding civil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities.\nSec. 3. Terminating Illegal Discrimination in the Federal Government. (a) The following executive actions are hereby revoked:\n(i) Executive Order 12898 of February 11, 1994 (Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations);\n(ii) Executive Order 13583 of August 18, 2011 (Establishing a Coordinated Government-wide Initiative to Promote Diversity and Inclusion in the Federal Workforce);\n(iii) Executive Order 13672 of July 21, 2014 (Further Amendments to Executive Order 11478, Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government, and Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity); and\n(iv) The Presidential Memorandum of October 5, 2016 (Promoting Diversity and Inclusion in the National Security Workforce).\n(b) The Federal contracting process shall be streamlined to enhance speed and efficiency, reduce costs, and require Federal contractors and subcontractors to comply with our civil-rights laws. Accordingly:\n(i) Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965 (Equal Employment Opportunity), is hereby revoked. For 90 days from the date of this order, Federal contractors may continue to comply with the regulatory scheme in effect on January 20, 2025.\n(ii) The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs within the Department of Labor shall immediately cease:\n(A) Promoting \u201cdiversity\u201d;\n(B) Holding Federal contractors and subcontractors responsible for taking \u201caffirmative action\u201d; and\n(C) Allowing or encouraging Federal contractors and subcontractors to engage in workforce balancing based on race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin.\n(iii) In accordance with Executive Order 13279 of December 12, 2002 (Equal Protection of the Laws for Faith-Based and Community Organizations), the employment, procurement, and contracting practices of Federal contractors and subcontractors shall not consider race, color, sex, sexual preference, religion, or national origin in ways that violate the Nation\u2019s civil rights laws.\n(iv) The head of each agency shall include in every contract or grant award:\n(A) A term requiring the contractual counterparty or grant recipient to agree that its compliance in all respects with all applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws is material to the government\u2019s payment decisions for purposes of section 3729(b)(4) of title 31, United States Code; and\n(B) A term requiring such counterparty or recipient to certify that it does not operate any programs promoting DEI that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.\n(c) The Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), with the assistance of the Attorney General as requested, shall:\n(i) Review and revise, as appropriate, all Government-wide processes, directives, and guidance;\n(ii) Excise references to DEI and DEIA principles, under whatever name they may appear, from Federal acquisition, contracting, grants, and financial assistance procedures to streamline those procedures, improve speed and efficiency, lower costs, and comply with civil-rights laws; and\n(iii) Terminate all \u201cdiversity,\u201d \u201cequity,\u201d \u201cequitable decision-making,\u201d \u201cequitable deployment of financial and technical assistance,\u201d \u201cadvancing equity,\u201d and like mandates, requirements, programs, or activities, as appropriate.\nSec. 4. Encouraging the Private Sector to End Illegal DEI Discrimination and Preferences. (a) The heads of all agencies, with the assistance of the Attorney General, shall take all appropriate action with respect to the operations of their agencies to advance in the private sector the policy of individual initiative, excellence, and hard work identified in section 2 of this order.\n(b) To further inform and advise me so that my Administration may formulate appropriate and effective civil-rights policy, the Attorney General, within 120 days of this order, in consultation with the heads of relevant agencies and in coordination with the Director of OMB, shall submit a report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy containing recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI. The report shall contain a proposed strategic enforcement plan identifying:\n(i) Key sectors of concern within each agency\u2019s jurisdiction;\n(ii) The most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners in each sector of concern;\n(iii) A plan of specific steps or measures to deter DEI programs or principles (whether specifically denominated \u201cDEI\u201d or otherwise) that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences. As a part of this plan, each agency shall identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars;\n(iv) Other strategies to encourage the private sector to end illegal DEI discrimination and preferences and comply with all Federal civil-rights laws;\n(v) Litigation that would be potentially appropriate for Federal lawsuits, intervention, or statements of interest; and\n(vi) Potential regulatory action and sub-regulatory guidance.\nSec. 5. Other Actions. Within 120 days of this order, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Education shall jointly issue guidance to all State and local educational agencies that receive Federal funds, as well as all institutions of higher education that receive Federal grants or participate in the Federal student loan assistance program under Title IV of the Higher Education Act, 20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq., regarding the measures and practices required to comply with Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, 600 U.S. 181 (2023).\nSec. 6. Severability. If any provision of this order, or the application of any provision to any person or circumstance, is held to be invalid, the remainder of this order and the application of its provisions to any other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby.\nSec. 7. Scope. (a) This order does not apply to lawful Federal or private-sector employment and contracting preferences for veterans of the U.S. armed forces or persons protected by the Randolph-Sheppard Act, 20 U.S.C. 107 et seq.\n(b) This order does not prevent State or local governments, Federal contractors, or Federally-funded State and local educational agencies or institutions of higher education from engaging in First Amendment-protected speech.\n(c) This order does not prohibit persons teaching at a Federally funded institution of higher education as part of a larger course of academic instruction from advocating for, endorsing, or promoting the unlawful employment or contracting practices prohibited by this order.\nSec. 8. General Provisions. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\n(i) the authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or\n(ii) the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\n(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\n(c) This order is not intended to and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\nTHE WHITE HOUSE,\nJanuary 21, 2025."

      "text": "From the first day of his second term, President Donald Trump has used a whole-of-government approach not only to limit the transgender community\u2019s rights but even to deny their existence.\nTrans people make up less than 0.6% of the United States population ages 13 and older, according to the Williams Institute, a public policy research center focused on sexual orientation and gender identity at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law, and some experts are concerned that the Trump administration\u2019s efforts are only the lead-up to widespread crackdowns on all Americans\u2019 personal and medical choices.\nMany of the new policies are tied up in the courts, and a full accounting of the administration\u2019s actions is difficult to pin down. But they have included:\n- Removing trans people from the military\n- Sending the FBI and the Justice Department to investigate hospitals that offer particular medical services for trans children\n- Eliminating any mention of trans people on federal websites; stopping data collection on health issues\n- Removing trans people from hate crime surveys\n- Suing states for allowing trans athletes to play on high school sports teams\n- Dropping Fair Housing investigations\n- Ending reimbursements by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission for state and local agencies that investigate gender identity claims\nEven unexpected agencies such as the Department of Energy, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Transportation have issued transgender-specific communications and policies.\nA recent AP/NORC poll found that more Americans approve of Trump\u2019s handling of trans issues than his overall performance as president, with about two-thirds also saying that whether someone is a man or a woman is determined by the sex assigned at birth. But a Pew Research Center survey found that more than half of adults support policies that protect trans people from discrimination.\nAsked why the all-government effort is such a priority, White House Deputy Press Secretary Kush Desai said in an email to CNN: \u201cThe American people voiced a resounding Election Day mandate to restore common sense and reject the radical ideology that paved the way for irreversible child mutilation procedures and the undermining of girls\u2019 sports by biological men across our country. The Trump administration is committed to delivering on this mandate.\u201d\nThere is some precedent for such government-wide efforts, said Dr. Benjamin Ginsberg, chair of the Center for Advanced Governmental Studies at the Johns Hopkins Krieger School of Arts & Sciences.\nPresident Joe Biden used similar methods to promote environmental justice and labor unions, and to tackle gun violence. During World War II, an executive order from President Franklin D. Roosevelt mobilized multiple agencies to incarcerate about 120,000 Japanese people, many of them American citizens.\nWhat\u2019s different now \u201cis a real change in how American government works,\u201d Ginsberg said. Although the framers created a Constitution that had a separation of powers, power has been consolidated into the presidency.\n\u201cYou could say the president has all the power and the new separation of powers is the president has all the power, and Congress is separated from it,\u201d he said.\nTrump is also bolder and more aggressive than any president since FDR, Ginsberg said, and he\u2019s \u201cstacked the agencies with loyalists and is prepared to fire anybody.\u201d\nThe administration wants to \u201ccreate a country where transgender people are not welcome and have no protection,\u201d said Shannon Minter, vice president of legal for the National Center for LGBTQ Rights, an advocacy organization for LGBTQ+ people. It\u2019s an agenda unlike any the country has seen before, even in more conservative states, he said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clearly a very comprehensive agenda,\u201d Minter said. \u201cThey\u2019ve been very clear that they want to eliminate any recognition or legal protection for transgender people in any area of life or law, health care, schools, employment, housing, homeless shelters, medical research. They\u2019re going after universities and businesses that offer any recognition or protection to transgender people. They\u2019re very committed to this.\u201d\nThe effort isn\u2019t just about appealing to Trump\u2019s base, said Brad Sears, the associate dean of public interest law at UCLA and the Rand Schrader Distinguished Scholar of Law and Policy at the Williams Institute. \u201cRather, this is a comprehensive attempt to eliminate trans people from public life, and so every department seems to be trying to wipe out representation and space for trans people in the country. They are true believers in binary gender and, I think, in traditional gender roles and are very aggressively trying to implement this agenda.\u201d\nSome experts fear that the endgame is about more than just trans people.\n\u201cI think these attacks on trans Americans are really just the canary in the coal mine for broader civil rights rollbacks. When we have the government stripping protections from one group, no one\u2019s rights are secure,\u201d said Kel O\u2019Hara, senior attorney for policy & education equity at Equal Rights Advocates, an organization that fights for gender justice in workplaces and schools. \u201cThese attacks on transgender Americans, particularly transgender youth, they are using the community as a political pawn in a broader culture war and using that as a way to stage more sweeping attacks on marginalized communities.\u201d\nErasing transgender Americans\nMany of the policy changes involving transgender people stem from an executive order that Trump signed on his first day back in office.\nTitled \u201cDefending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\u201d the order redefined gender as \u201csex\u201d and said that humans are either male or female, determined by biology at conception.\nSexes are \u201cnot changeable,\u201d the order says, and gender identity is \u201cdisconnected from biological reality\u201d and \u201cdoes not provide a meaningful basis for identification and cannot be recognized as a replacement for sex.\u201d\nExperts say this order \u2013 and others like it \u2013 ignores existing science that shows the issue is much more complicated.\nResearch has found that sex and gender are different things that map differently on the brain. Saying there are only two sexes also doesn\u2019t account for people who are born intersex, meaning their sexual or reproductive anatomy doesn\u2019t fit a male/female binary.\nAfter the order was signed, the US Office of Personnel Management sent a memo to all government departments requiring them to terminate any programs, contracts and grants that \u201cpromote or inculcate gender ideology.\u201d\nPages that mentioned trans people were quickly removed from government websites, including at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the US Department of Health and Human Services. Mentions of trans people were removed from the National Park Service website about the National Monument at Stonewall, commemorating the start of the modern LGBTQ+ civil rights movement, an effort initially led in part by trans people.\nThe State Department suspended applications for gender changes on passports. Federal prisons were instructed to stop offering medical care specific to a transgender person\u2019s needs. The Department of Homeland Security eliminated a ban on surveillance based on someone\u2019s gender identity or sexual orientation. Government workers were forced to remove their pronoun identifiers in their email signatures.\n\u201cThis administration isn\u2019t just rolling back protections for trans folks, it is fast-tracking a really deliberate and comprehensive campaign to erase transgender Americans from public life,\u201d O\u2019Hara said.\nLimiting and criminalizing health care\nThe Trump administration took several steps to restrict trans and nonbinary children\u2019s access to gender-affirming care, which Trump has repeatedly described as \u201cchild abuse,\u201d including encouraging states to limit such care within their Medicaid programs.\nGender-affirming care is the umbrella term for the individualized approach to caring for trans people based on their age and other aspects. Major mainstream medical associations including the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics have backed the practice and say that it\u2019s the gold standard of clinically appropriate care that can provide lifesaving treatment for children and adults.\nThe Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services issued a news release telling states that \u201cMedicaid dollars are not to be used for gender reassignment surgeries or hormone treatments in minors,\u201d though studies show that such surgeries are exceptionally rare among trans children, and major medical associations do not recommend hormone treatment for children.\nThe administration also paused foreign aid to trans-inclusive health care programs backed by USAID.\nHundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants to study issues that included transgender people were terminated, but in April, Trump ordered the National Institutes of Health to study feelings of regret after transitioning and detransitioning among the community, which studies suggest are rare.\nIn February, one of Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s first moves as HHS secretary involved issuing guidance for the federal government that offers a narrow definition of sex, similar to Trump\u2019s executive order, as well as a video focused on why trans women shouldn\u2019t play on women\u2019s sports teams.\nIn March, the Department of Veterans Affairs issued guidelines to VA hospitals saying that the system would phase out treatment for gender dysphoria, the official diagnosis given to some people who identify as transgender.\n\u201cFrankly, this commonsense reform should have been made years ago, but only President Trump and VA Secretary Doug Collins had the courage to do it,\u201d VA press secretary Pete Kasperowicz said in an email to CNN on Thursday. \u201cVA has received almost no criticism in response to this decision \u2013 proof that the vast majority of Veterans and Americans support it.\u201d\nIn May, Kennedy sent a letter to health systems across the US, telling them that care of trans children should rely on a highly critical and controversial review of the science that Trump had ordered. The review said it wasn\u2019t explicitly guidance and made no specific clinical recommendations, but it seemed to favor a version of a discredited kind of therapy meant to give children tools to essentially manage and decrease their feelings that they are transgender. Most research shows that this therapy doesn\u2019t work and can be harmful.\nThat same month, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services sent letters to hospitals that provide care for transgender children, demanding data on quality standards and finances and claiming that hospitals were performing \u201chigh-risk procedures\u201d on vulnerable children, \u201coften at taxpayer expense.\u201d\nIn June, at the start of Pride month, the FBI tweeted that it was looking for whistleblowers on service providers who offer certain kinds of care for transgender children. At the beginning of this month, the Department of Justice had issued subpoenas to more than 20 providers of this kind of care, whom it has not named.\nAn HHS spokesperson says its focus on transgender issues is\u201drestoring integrity, biological reality, and common sense across health policy. Secretary Kennedy is proud to lead a department that puts children\u2019s safety, data accuracy, and accountability ahead of ideology. Our approach is guided by science, transparency, and a focus on ensuring federal health policy aligns with the Trump Administration\u2019s commitment to medical integrity, the well-being of American families, and evidence-based decision-making.\u201d\nEducation and sports\nA large part of the administration\u2019s efforts has centered on keeping trans students out of sports competitions. It\u2019s a popular topic for political rhetoric, said Sears, the UCLA dean, since it is an issue where one group of people\u2019s rights \u201care framed as interfering with another group\u2019s.\u201d\nAn executive order issued by Trump banned transgender women and girls from competing on sports teams not aligned with their assigned sex at birth. The administration sued states like Maine for being inclusive of trans athletes.\nUSDA Secretary Brooke Rollins sent a letter to Maine in April that said the state needed to \u201cdemonstrate compliance with Title IX which protects female student athletes from having to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males.\u201d The agency sent a similar letter to California\u2019s governor.\nA USDA spokesperson told CNN in an email that the agency \u201chas brought about positive changes, reversing Biden Administration policies and practices that wrongly discriminated on the basis of race or sex. USDA going forward will endeavor to ensure that its policies and taxpayer-funded programs do not wrongfully discriminate on the basis of race or sex.\u201d\nThe Department of Education says it is working with the Department of Justice to create a Title IX Special Investigations Team focused on keeping trans women and girls off sports teams and out of women\u2019s restrooms.\nAnother Trump executive order required schools to inform a student\u2019s parents or guardian if the student asked to use a different name or pronoun. In June, the administration threatened California\u2019s state funding because the state\u2019s sex education program includes gender identity.\nSuicide hotline\nOn Thursday, the administration ended services on the 988 hotline that made available experts familiar with LGBTQ+ issues available to phone users, although some state support continues. That part of the hotline project handled 10% of all 988 contacts, according to KFF, a health research organization. Studies show that more than 82% of trans people have considered suicide, and 40% have attempted suicide, with suicidality highest among trans youth.\nEliminating these specially trained workers will hurt the community, said Jackson Budinger of the Trevor Project, which had been helping with the suicide prevention efforts.\n\u201cIf a Spanish speaker goes to the doctor because they are having heart problems and the doctor does not speak Spanish, they\u2019re going to spend the entire time fighting to communicate,\u201d said Budinger, the nonprofit\u2019s senior director of communications.\nThe Trevor Project will still offer its crisis services, making counselors available to answer calls, chats or texts for free around the clock to help LGBTQ+ people who are thinking about suicide. But the loss of a multimillion-dollar grant from the federal government means it will serve far fewer people, Budinger said.\nOther agencies get involved\n\u201cAgencies writ large have been directed by the Trump administration to do something about trans people,\u201d said Caleb Smith, director of LGBTQI+ Policy at the Center for American Progress, an independent nonpartisan policy institute.\nOver the objections of some Federal Trade Commission employees who sent a joint letter to Congress, that agency held a daylong session about how medical care for transgender people was a dangerous fraud. The Trump administration has largely focused on children\u2019s access to some trans-specific health care, but the conference featured anti-trans activists who called for the end of medical care for transgender adults, as well.\nThe Department of Energy also took action, Smith said, issuing a suggested regulation in May that would limit trans people from playing sports and eliminate sex discrimination protections for students in education programs. One of the agency\u2019s offices ensures Title IX compliance at institutions that receive federal funding or grant money.\nPutting this change through the Department of Energy could make it happen faster, Smith said, because it doesn\u2019t have as many policies on transgender people as a department like HHS.\n\u201cBecause they have to go through less of a process, because, well, they don\u2019t really deal with sports and trans folks in sports, so they can get that out quicker than, say, the Department of Education or Department of Health can get something out,\u201d he said.\nBut for now, the rule remains proposed. DOE spokesperson Ben Dietderich told CNN that the agency \u201creceived significant comments on each of the direct final rules referenced. For this reason, DOE is extending the effective date to consider comments submitted in response to these direct final rules.\u201d\nTaking so many actions so quickly is partially intended to offer \u201ccheap political wins,\u201d Smith said.\n\u201cSome of it is content generation that is as easy as possible for them to do,\u201d Smith says. \u201cSome of this is just misuse of agencies.\u201d\nUsing every tool available can also \u201cexhaust folks and confuse folks,\u201d Smith added.\nRebecca Minor, who provides counseling for transgender patients and has written a book on raising transgender children, says she\u2019s been discouraged by the all-agency approach to limiting trans rights. Anti-trans laws have real-world consequences, she says. A 2024 study showed that more teens attempted suicide after their states passed anti-trans laws.\n\u201cAgencies that are focused on agriculture shouldn\u2019t be paying any attention to trans youth,\u201d Minor said. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a scary time.\u201d\nMinor says many of her patients and families are deeply afraid of what the Trump administration has been doing. Some are even asking if it\u2019s safe for them to leave their home state on a family vacation.\n\u201cAnd the even bigger question is, they ask, \u2018How will we know when it is time to leave the country?\u2019 \u201d Minor said.\nThe endgame\nLawsuits will continue to keep some of the new policies on hold. But for the transgender community to thrive under the Trump administration, Smith said, institutions will have to be \u201creally ruthless about not giving the administration what it wants, which is preemptive compliance.\u201d\nMinter, of the National Center for LGBTQ Rights, believes that anti-trans policies may be a kind of Trojan horse created to undermine protections for cisgender women, too. Trans people, he says, \u201care just an easier political target.\u201d\nIf the Trump administration can legally control what kind of health care a clinician provides a trans patient, Smith says, it can regulate other personal decisions that may not fit with a certain agenda, such as birth control, IVF, interracial marriage or same-sex intimacy.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really about bodily autonomy,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen over the past couple of years is anti-trans sentiment being used as a foothold into other issues.\n\u201cIf they can use this as a weapon, if they can use fear as the weapon here successfully, to curtail a population from existing and thriving publicly, then they will use that tool of fear elsewhere,\u201d Smith added."

      "text": "Get inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple. Sign up for CNN\u2019s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.\nSocial psychologist Jonathan Haidt probably has become a pretty unpopular guy among teenagers over the last few weeks.\nHis new book, \u201cThe Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness,\u201d essentially calls for a revolution in how parents administer smartphones and social media to their teens.\nPut simply, Haidt writes that kids should have little to no access to either until they turn 16.\nWhile some have questioned the science behind Haidt\u2019s thesis, Haidt argues the perspective is informed by years of research \u2014 investigations that depict climbing mental health struggles among American tweens and teens, and statistics that indicate many teenagers in the United States already are depressed or anxious in some way.\nThe American Psychological Association echoed his concern in a new report that calls out social media platforms for designs that are \u201cinherently unsafe for children.\u201d The APA\u2019s report, released Tuesday, says that children do not have \u201cthe experience, judgment and self-control\u201d to manage themselves on those platforms. The association says burden shouldn\u2019t be entirely on parents, app stores or young people \u2014 it has to be on the platform developers.\nBut parents probably can\u2019t count on developers, which leads to Haidt\u2019s jarring conclusion: We\u2019re at a tipping point as a society, and if grown-ups don\u2019t take action, they could risk the mental health of all young people indefinitely.\nHaidt, the Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership at New York University\u2019s Leonard N. Stern School of Business, has spent countless hours publicizing the book\u2019s message since its March 26 release. CNN recently talked with Haidt about his data, the book and what lies ahead for parents and teens alike.\nThis conversation has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\nCNN: How did we get ourselves into this predicament?\nJonathan Haidt: Kids always had play-based childhoods, but we gradually let that fade away because of our growing fears of kidnapping and other threats in the 1980s and 1990s. What arose to fill all that time was technology. In the 1990s, we thought the internet was going to be the savior of democracy. It was going to make our children smarter. Because most of us were techno-optimists, we didn\u2019t really raise alarms when our kids started spending four, five, six and now seven to nine hours a day on their phones and other screens.\nThe basic argument of the book is that we\u2019ve overprotected our children in the real world and we\u2019ve under-protected them online. And for both halves of that, you can see how we did that thinking that it was going to be OK. We were wrong on both points.\nCNN: What is some of the most startling data you found?\nHaidt: The one that comes immediately to mind was the discovery that teenage boys used to have by far the highest rates of broken bones before the great rewiring of childhood. Before 2010, teenage boys were much more likely than any other group to go to a hospital because they broke a bone. Once we get to the early 2010s, their rates of hospitalization plunge, so that now teenage boys are slightly less likely to break a bone than are their fathers or grandfathers. They\u2019re spending most of their time on their computers and their video games, and so they\u2019re physically safe. But I would argue that this comes at the cost of healthy boyhood development.\nCNN: Does this mental health crisis affect boys and girls differently?\nHaidt: The basic facts about gender differences are that when everyone got a smartphone in the early 2010s, boys went for video games and YouTube and Reddit, while girls went more for the visual social media platforms, especially Instagram, Pinterest and Tumblr.\nA second difference is that girls share emotions more than boys do. They talk about their feelings more, and they\u2019re more open to each other. Girls\u2019 levels of anxiety go up a lot in this period (the tween and teen years), as soon as they get hyper-connected to each other via social media.\nSelf-harm is a way that some girls have historically coped with anxiety, and those rates also went way up in the early 2010s. It used to be that (self-harm) was not a thing that 12- and 13-year-olds were doing, it was more older girls. In the 2010s, hospital emergency room visits (for self-harm) for 10 to 14-year-old girls nearly tripled. That\u2019s one of the biggest increases in markers of mental illness that we see in all the data that I\u2019ve reviewed.\nCNN: You\u2019ve said we\u2019re at a tipping point in this crisis? Why?\nHaidt: I think that this year is the tipping point for several reasons. In 2019, the debate was really getting started. Then Covid-19 happened, and that obscured previous trends. Now we\u2019re a few years past Covid-19, past the school closures, past the masks, and what has become clear to everyone is that kids are not all right. And the data on rates of mental illness shows us that most of the increase was in place long before Covid-19 arrived.\nNowadays, in families across America, one of the biggest and most prevalent dynamics is fighting over technology. What I found since the book came out is that almost everybody sees the problem. Parents are in a state of despair. They feel like the genie is out of the bottle. They say, \u201cYou can\u2019t put toothpaste back in a tube, can you?\u201d To that, I say, \u201cIf you really have to do it, you\u2019ll do it.\u201d\nWhen you look at the wreckage of adolescent mental health and you look at the increases in self-harm and suicide, you look at the declining test scores since 2012 in the United States and all around the world, I think we have to do something. My book provides clear analysis of the multiple collective action problems and of the four simple norms that will solve them.\nCNN: What are the norms that will solve this crisis?\nHaidt: No. 1: No smartphones before high school. We must clear them out of middle school and elementary school. Just let kids have a flip phone or phone watch when they become independent.\nNo. 2: No social media until 16. These platforms were not made for children. They appear to be especially harmful for children. We must especially protect early puberty since that is when the greatest damage is done.\nNo. 3: Phone-free schools. There\u2019s really no argument for letting kids have the greatest distraction device ever invented in their pockets during school hours. If they have the phones, they will be texting during class, and they will be focused on their phones. If they don\u2019t have phones, they will listen to their teachers and spend time with other kids.\nNo. 4: More independence, free play and responsibility in the real world. We need to roll back the phone-based childhood and restore the play-based childhood.\nCNN: Rethinking smartphone privileges is a huge departure for many families. How do you convince parents to buy in?\nHaidt: Elementary school is easy. If you\u2019ve already given your kid a phone or their own iPad, you can take it away. Just be sure to coordinate with the parents of your kid\u2019s friends so that your kid feels they\u2019re not the only one. They can still have access to a computer; they can still text their friends on a computer. But if your kids are in elementary school, just commit to not giving them these things until high school.\nMiddle school is harder. Most middle school kids are entirely enmeshed in smartphones and social media. The key in middle school is to have some very severe time restrictions. The problem is the move from a couple hours of access a day to potentially having access all day long. That\u2019s what does a lot of the kids in. Half of all American teens say they\u2019re online almost constantly. If your kids already have these devices, I think you want to make some strict rules about when they have access to them.\nCNN: What do you think will happen if we don\u2019t change soon?\nHaidt: Given that the rates of mental illness and self-harm and suicide are still going up, we don\u2019t know where the limit is. We don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s possible to have 100% of our kids be depressed and anxious. We\u2019re already getting close to half for the girls; we\u2019re already in the ballpark of 30% to 40% having depression or anxiety, and about 30% currently say they\u2019ve thought about suicide this year. Things are already really bad, and the levels could just continue to rise to the point where the majority of kids are depressed, anxious and suicidal.\nThis has enormous social implications, too. Because kids are somewhat sex-segregated online (they interact less with kids of the opposite sex), the situation is unconducive to heterosexual dating and marriage. I think the separation between boys and girls and their rising rates of anxiety are going to drive rates of marriage and heterosexual childbearing down much faster than they\u2019ve been going \u2014 and they\u2019ve been dropping for decades.\nLastly, I think there could be huge economic implications. Already, you have dozens of state attorneys general suing Meta and Snapchat because of the sheer amount of money that the states spend on psychiatric emergency services for adolescents. Another economic implication is that if we have one or two or three anxious generations where young people are afraid to take risks, our free market economy, our entrepreneurial culture, all the things that make the American economy so vibrant and dynamic will suffer. That\u2019s why I think we have no choice. We (must) put a stop to this now.\nMatt Villano is a writer and editor based in Northern California. Learn more about him at whalehead.com."

      "text": "The University of Michigan will immediately end its diversity, equity and inclusion program after months of discussion about potential rollbacks to the initiatives, which galvanized hundreds of students, staff and faculty to protest last year.\nThe university will close its office of diversity, equity and inclusion and the office for health equity inclusion, and will discontinue its DEI 2.0 strategic plan, which laid out a blueprint for diversity initiatives through 2028.\nAs part of the changes, funds will be reallocated to increase investments in financial aid and mental health resources. Further, university attorneys will conduct a review to ensure \u201call policies, programs and practices comply with federal law and guidance,\u201d according to a university news release.\nFunds will also be redirected to improving advising and counseling services as well as \u201cinnovative approaches\u201d such as a personal AI assistant \u201cfor every member of the community.\u201d Investments will also be made in maintaining student common areas and \u201ccelebrating cultural and ethnic programs,\u201d the release said.\n\u201cThese decisions have not been made lightly. We recognize the changes are significant and will be challenging for many of us, especially those whose lives and careers have been enriched by and dedicated to programs that are now pivoting,\u201d reads a joint statement from President Santa J. Ono and other university leaders.\nThe elimination of the program comes after President Donald Trump\u2019s expansive executive order banning DEI programs, effectively ordering agencies to \u201calign\u201d with the White House\u2019s policies and guidance.\nThen, in February, the Department of Education threatened the federal funding of any academic institution engaging in DEI initiatives, which prompted many to scrub DEI mentions from websites, shutter programs and some to lose funding for scholarships.\nIn the past, many DEI initiatives have been credited as beneficial and studies have shown college students exposed to more diversity have greater levels of cultural awareness and political participation.\nIn a statement to CNN, Kay Jarvis, director of public affairs, told CNN: \u201c\u2026 The university announced it will reallocate funding away from administrative functions and toward student-facing initiatives that directly enhance student success and foster a sense of belonging for all members of our community.\u201d\nThe university said the decision was a culmination of monthslong discussions among university leadership and the board of regents about potential changes to its DEI initiatives, which led to further deliberation \u201cin tandem with the early months of the new presidential administration when executive orders and federal guidance \u2014 including several that broadly criticized DEI programs \u2014 began to reshape higher education.\u201d\nThe university faced scrutiny last year over potential rollbacks in the initiatives. Hundreds of students and faculty members in December protested on campus amid concerns the board of regents was defunding the DEI program entirely, and thousands of people signed a petition defending it.\nBan on faculty diversity statements now expanded universitywide\nThe joint statement from Ono and other university leaders cited \u201cimportant progress\u201d made since the launch of the DEI strategic plan in 2016, including a 46% increase in first-generation undergraduate students, \u201cdriven in part\u201d by the success of its diversity programs.\n\u201cSome in our campus community have voiced frustration that they did not feel included in DEI initiatives and that the programming fell short in fostering connections among diverse groups,\u201d the message further stated.\nAt the rallies last winter opposing changes to the program, speakers representing students, staff and faculty from various backgrounds spoke about the importance of DEI and \u201cin some instances, speakers shared personal anecdotes about how DEI has positively impacted their lives,\u201d University of Michigan professor Kevin Cokley, also the associate chair for diversity initiatives, previously told CNN.\nThe board of regents did not vote to defund the program at a December 5 meeting but agreed to roll back a requirement for faculty to submit diversity statements as part of hiring, promotion and tenure following a recommendation from an eight-member faculty group, the university said in December.\nAs part of the new actions announced Thursday, the use of diversity statements will be banned universitywide, adding: \u201cstatements related to a person\u2019s commitment to DEI will no longer be solicited or considered\u201d in admissions, hiring or otherwise.\nIn June 2024, Provost Laurie McCauley assigned the faculty committee \u201cto explore the use of diversity statements in faculty hiring and promotion\u201d at the university, the release said.\nThe group reviewed nearly 2,000 responses to a survey, which revealed most faculty members \u201cagreed that diversity statements put pressure on faculty to express specific positions on moral, political or social issues.\u201d\n\u201cSlightly more disagreed than agreed that diversity statements allow an institution to demonstrate a commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion by cultivating DEI in the faculty,\u201d the release said.\nIn a November 27 letter to deans, McCauley said many community members were concerned about the state of DEI at the university: \u201cThose concerns have grown because of recent claims that the university is considering fully defunding these types of programs.\u201d\nShe continued: \u201cTo be clear, those claims are incorrect.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Andy Rose and Maria Aguilar Prieto contributed to this report."

      "text": "The NCAA changed its participation policy for transgender athletes on Thursday, limiting competition in women\u2019s sports to athletes assigned female at birth only.\nThe move came one day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order intended to ban transgender athletes from girls\u2019 and women\u2019s sports. The order gives federal agencies latitude to withhold federal funding from entities that do not abide by Title IX in alignment with the Trump administration\u2019s view, which interprets \u201csex\u201d as the gender someone was assigned at birth.\nThe NCAA policy change is effective immediately and applies to all athletes regardless of previous eligibility reviews. The NCAA has some 1,100 member schools with more than 500,000 athletes, easily the largest governing body for college athletics in the U.S.\n\u201cWe strongly believe that clear, consistent, and uniform eligibility standards would best serve today\u2019s student-athletes instead of a patchwork of conflicting state laws and court decisions,\u201d NCAA President Charlie Baker said. \u201cTo that end, President Trump\u2019s order provides a clear, national standard.\u201d\nThe NCAA policy that went into effect in 2022 adopted a sport-by-sport approach, where transgender participation was determined by the policy of the sport\u2019s national governing body. In sports with no national governing body, that sport\u2019s international federation policy would be in place. If there is no international federation policy, previously established IOC policy criteria would take over.\nOver the past year, however, transgender athletes have been targeted by critics who say their participation in women\u2019s sports is unfair and a potential safety risk. It became a major talking point in Trump\u2019s re-election campaign even though there is believed to be a very small number of transgender athletes; Baker last year said he knew of only 10 transgender athletes in the NCAA.\nThe NCAA\u2019s revised policy permits athletes assigned male at birth to practice with women\u2019s teams and receive benefits such as medical care. It is not uncommon, for example, for women\u2019s basketball teams to practice against fellow students who are male.\nRegardless of sex assigned at birth or gender identity, an athlete can practice and compete with a men\u2019s team assuming they meet all other NCAA eligibility requirements.\nHowever, the NCAA said an athlete assigned female at birth who has begun hormone therapy (testosterone, for example) can practice with a women\u2019s team but cannot compete on a women\u2019s team without risking the team\u2019s eligibility for championships.\nMember schools remain responsible for certifying athlete eligibility for practice and competition. The NCAA also said schools are subject to local, state and federal legislation and such legislation supersedes NCAA rules.\nThe NCAA policy change was announced hours after the Trump administration said it was investigating potential civil rights violations at two universities and a high school sports league that allowed transgender athletes to compete on women\u2019s teams. The Education Department said it had opened reviews of San Jose State University, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association.\nSan Jose State\u2019s women\u2019s volleyball team drew headlines last season over unconfirmed allegations that the roster included a transgender player. As for Penn, three former teammates of transgender swimmer Lia Thomas have sued the NCAA, Ivy League, Harvard and the school over Thomas\u2019s participation at conference and national championships, saying it violated Title IX provisions.\nThe NCAA said its Board of Governors had directed staff to help all member schools foster respectful and inclusive collegiate athletic cultures, noting it has recently updated its mental health guidance.\n\u201cThe updated policy combined with these resources follows through on the NCAA\u2019s constitutional commitment to deliver intercollegiate athletics competition and to protect, support and enhance the mental and physical health of student-athletes,\u201d Baker said. \u201cThis national standard brings much-needed clarity as we modernize college sports for today\u2019s student-athletes.\u201d\nThe NCAA policy now mirrors that of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics, which governs sports at 241 mostly small colleges across the country. Last April, the NAIA unanimously approved a policy allowing only athletes whose sex assigned at birth is female and have not begun hormone therapy to compete."

      "text": "Jennifer Cortez stood outside an elementary and middle school in East Los Angeles, carrying a sign while greeting her students and their families on the first day of classes.\n\u201cThis is a safe space for immigrants,\u201d the teacher\u2019s red sign with white and yellow lettering said.\nAs summer comes to an end, more than 500,000 students in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation\u2019s second largest district, began a new school year Thursday with concerns and fear amid the ongoing immigration raids, and only a few days after a 15-year-old boy was detained outside one of the district\u2019s high schools.\nParents like Anna Bermudez and her husband arrived at Brooklyn Avenue School with their children and noticed many parents were absent compared to previous years.\n\u201cIt sucks, and it\u2019s horrible and heartbreaking,\u201d said Anna Bermudez, whose son attends eighth grade at the school. \u201cIt should be a happy day, and bringing our kids to school feeling safe. But the fact that you don\u2019t feel safe, even dropping them off, you know? It\u2019s very emotional.\u201d\nWhile immigration agents have not detained anyone inside a school, Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Alberto Carvalho has acknowledged the families\u2019 trepidations and announced the district will offer strengthened safety measures, expanded mental health resources and free legal resources for families.\n\u201cOur schools are safe spaces, I guarantee it. No one will have entry into our schools without a judicial order. We will protect our kids, we will protect our communities,\u201d Carvalho told reporters Thursday while visiting 24th Street Elementary School.\nTeen was detained outside high school this week\nIncreased immigration raids started as the school year was coming to an end this past spring and continued through the summer. Shortly before classes resumed in Los Angeles this week, enforcement actions took place outside a school.\nNathan Mejia, a 15-year-old with special needs, was pulled from the passenger seat of his mother\u2019s car and handcuffed by federal immigration agents outside Arleta High School in northern Los Angeles on Monday, CNN affiliate KCBS reported.\nCarvalho confirmed the boy was detained and noted he was released after a bystander intervened in the case of \u201cmistaken identity.\u201d\n\u201cThis is the exact type of incident that traumatizes our communities; it cannot repeat itself,\u201d the superintendent said in a Monday news conference.\nIn a statement to KCBS, Customs and Border Protection officials denied allegations that immigration agents targeted the school and said they were searching for a Salvadoran national with \u201cprior criminal convictions in the broader vicinity\u201d of the high school.\nNathan\u2019s mother, Andreina Mejia, told KCBS the agents showed her a picture of a person who resembled her son, but it wasn\u2019t actually him.\n\u201cSo they were like, \u2018We\u2019re looking for somebody. Your son looks like somebody.\u2019 and they showed me the picture and I\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s not my son,\u2019\u201d she said.\nAfter being handcuffed in front of onlooking students and parents, Nathan, who is a US citizen, doesn\u2019t want to live in Los Angeles anymore, he told KCBS.\n\u201cI cannot sleep or anything,\u201d he told KCBS.\nDistrict tries to alleviate fears\nSchool officials said they have been working to \u201cprotect and defend\u201d students and families as they plan their return to classes, highlighting the launch of the \u201cWe Are One\u201d campaign, which offers resources for \u201call students and families, regardless of immigration status.\u201d\nEarlier this week, Carvalho also said he urged immigration authorities not to conduct enforcement activity within a two-block radius around schools, starting an hour before the school day begins and until one hour after classes let out, the Associated Press reported.\nThe superintendent said that while staffers and district police officers cannot interfere with immigration enforcement and do not have jurisdiction beyond school property, they have had conversations with federal agents parked in front of schools that resulted in them leaving.\nThe district has also partnered with local law enforcement in some cities, forming a \u201crapid response\u201d network to disseminate information about the presence of federal agents, Carvalho said.\n\u201cWe want no one to stay home as a result of fears,\u201d he assured in the news conference Monday.\nTeachers plan to stand up for their students\nLike school administrators, teachers expressed their commitment to protect students and their families.\nCortez, the teacher at Brooklyn Avenue School, said she believes every child in their district has the right to the education offered there, \u201cno matter what.\u201d\n\u201cWe want to make sure that everyone is getting the education that they deserve. We want to make sure that they don\u2019t miss school, that they\u2019re here, that they know they\u2019re welcome,\u201d Cortez told CNN. \u201cWe want to teach everybody.\u201d\nIn April, administrators at two elementary schools denied entry to officials from the Department of Homeland Security, the AP reported.\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary for the children,\u201d said a teacher from a nearby elementary school, dropping off her own children at Brooklyn Avenue. \u201cThey see these ICE agents coming in, all covered up, with their face and all, and it\u2019s scary for the students, and it\u2019s a shame that they have to experience this.\u201d\nThe teacher, who has been an educator for 20 years, said she has never seen immigration raids unfolding the way they have been this year, but her priority hasn\u2019t changed.\n\u201cAs teachers, our priority is keeping the children safe, and we\u2019re not going to let them come and bother our parents, or bother our students,\u201d the teacher said. \u201cOur responsibility and our priorities are our students, and we\u2019re going to be there - whatever it takes.\u201d\nCNN\u2019s Gonzalo Alvarado contributed to this report."

      "text": "The Trump administration is still optimistic about the possibility of reaching a deal with Harvard University after it announced a $200 million settlement with Columbia University on Wednesday.\n\u201cWhile there\u2019s a lawsuit pending with Harvard, and I\u2019m sure that lawsuit will play out, I do hope that Harvard will continue to come to the table with negotiations. Those talks are continuing, and we\u2019d like to have a resolution there, outside of the courts,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a phone interview with CNN on Thursday.\nHarvard faced off with the Trump administration in court on Monday, arguing that the administration\u2019s $2 billion freeze in federal funding for research was in violation of the school\u2019s First Amendment rights. The case has become a flashpoint in a major clash over academic freedom, campus oversight and federal funding. The judge has not made a final ruling in the case, but Harvard has asked for a decision to be made no later than September 3, when it says some of the funding cuts could become more permanent.\nA small circle of Trump administration officials and officials from Harvard have been engaged in talks toward a potential deal for months, but a source familiar with the discussions told CNN earlier this week those conversations have largely stalled.\nOn Thursday, McMahon pointed to some recent actions taken by Harvard as positive steps, including the departure of the heads of the Middle Eastern Studies center. She described the current state of talks with the university as \u201congoing\u201d but declined to provide additional details. She also declined to provide information about the scale of any settlement the administration hopes to achieve with Harvard, which has a larger endowment than Columbia.\nIn a statement shortly after the Columbia deal was announced, McMahon described the move as a \u201cseismic shift\u201d for higher education that could serve as a \u201croadmap\u201d for other schools. She said that \u201cother universities are already looking at\u201d the template provided by the Columbia agreement.\n\u201cColleges and universities are understanding at this particular point that they have some issues they need to address, and I think that they are coming to the table to do that,\u201d she said.\nMcMahon added that there are \u201cother investigations that are going on\u201d and that the Trump administration has sent letters to some other universities \u201cletting them know that we are investigating \u2026 but I would prefer that we will not go public with those right now.\u201d\nPresident Donald Trump indicated a deal with Harvard was within reach last month, saying in a social media post that the school had \u201cacted extremely appropriately\u201d and that a deal could be announced \u201cover the next week or so.\u201d But those talks appeared to subsequently derail.\nThe administration escalated its battle with the university days later, announcing that an investigation found the school in \u201cviolent violation\u201d of the Civil Rights Act. The administration warned in a letter in late June that a failure to immediately institute change \u201cwill result in the loss of all federal financial resources and continue to affect Harvard\u2019s relationship with the federal government.\u201d\nAnd days after that, the Department of Homeland Security sent the school administrative subpoenas regarding its Student Visitor and Exchange Program certification, seeking all relevant records, communications and other documents about Harvard\u2019s enforcement of immigration laws.\nOn Wednesday, Secretary of State Marco Rubio escalated things further \u2013 announcing the administration was opening an investigation into Harvard\u2019s \u201ccontinued eligibility as a sponsor for the Exchange Visitor Program.\u201d\nHarvard has sent some signals it is willing to work with the Trump administration, including earlier this month when The Harvard Crimson reported that websites for Harvard College centers serving minority and LGBTQ students and women disappeared. The White House welcomed that development, viewing it as a goodwill gesture that one official described as \u201cgood news.\u201d\nThis story has been updated with additional information."

  "argos_summary": "The Trump administration has intensified its crackdown on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives across federal agencies, higher education, and sports. Executive orders and federal guidance now require agencies to align with the White House\u2019s anti\u2011DEI stance, threatening funding for institutions that maintain DEI programs. The NCAA has revised its policy to restrict transgender athletes in women\u2019s sports to those assigned female at birth, mirroring the administration\u2019s broader agenda. In education, the administration has frozen federal research funding for Harvard and is investigating other universities, while also threatening to withhold funding from schools that do not comply with Title\u202fIX interpretations of \u201csex.\u201d Immigration enforcement actions near schools in Los Angeles have heightened fears among immigrant families, prompting district officials to enhance safety measures and mental\u2011health resources. Overall, the administration\u2019s policies aim to reshape higher education and public schools by limiting DEI efforts, restricting transgender participation in sports, and tightening immigration enforcement around educational institutions.",
