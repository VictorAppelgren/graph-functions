  "content": "A band headed to one of the biggest rural music festivals has suffered a travel nightmare after Virgin Australia lost their luggage.\n\n19-Twenty were left devastated on Friday when they touched down in Broken Hill for the Mundi Mundi Bash and discovered their instruments hadn't been put on the flight.\n\nBand members Kane Dennelly, Jeremy Berg, and John Gwilliam took to social media shortly after to detail their appalling experience in a fake press release, titled 'Innovation in Inconvenience'.\n\n'Virgin Australia is proud to unveil their brand-new premium service: The Gearless Gig Experience,' they began on the band's official Instagram page.\n\n'Launched exclusively TODAY at the Mundi Mundi Bash with 19-Twenty, this groundbreaking package ensures your band arrives at the venue completely separated from your instruments.\n\n'Why bother with double basses, guitars, pedals or cables when true artistry is found in sheer panic?' the phony statement continued.\n\nElsewhere in their 315-word put-down, the band members revealed that Virgin had 'thoughtfully' cancelled the group's first flight.\n\nThey were offered a second, later flight, but unfortunately their gear, including four guitars, was left behind in Sydney.\n\n'...nothing screams 'rock 'n' roll' like begging strangers in a desert for a guitar slide,' the band joked.\n\nThe group also created a 'Virgin Australia spokesperson' to put the boot in further to the airline over the inconvenience.\n\n'We're proud to strip live music back to its rawest form: three sweaty men, no gear, and the crushing weight of failure. Honestly, it's art,' read the statement.\n\nThey finished their fake press release with the words, 'Virgin Australia looks forward to expanding The Gearless Gig Experience to ruin many more artists' experiences in the near future'.\n\nThe band signed off their missive, 'Virgin Australia - Because you didn't need your instruments anyway.'\n\nDaily Mail has reached out to Virgin Australia for comment.\n\nThe group's post was soon inundated with comments in support.\n\n'The best unwanted exposure for a gear less gig that you could ever not ask for and yet you still make the worst band experience into a well written novel!' one follower commented, adding, 'If only it was fiction not fact.. Big love Fellas.\n\n'This, although absolutely heartbreaking\u2026\u2026is the most well written and funny thing I've read for aaaages,' wrote another.\n\n'Ohh noooooo! Clever post though. Glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humour!' added a third user.\n\nThe band were set to play this weekend at the sold out Mundi Mundi Bash alongside Oz Rock favourites Missy Higgins, The Angels and the Hoodoo Gurus.",
