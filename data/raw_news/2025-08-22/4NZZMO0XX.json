  "content": "MINNEAPOLIS - SharpLink Gaming, Inc. (Nasdaq:SBET), currently valued at $2.51 billion with shares trading at $18.04, announced Friday that its Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion of the company\u2019s common stock. According to InvestingPro analysis, the stock has shown remarkable momentum with a 237% gain over the past six months.\n\nThe program is designed to provide the company with flexibility to repurchase shares when the stock trades at or below the net asset value (NAV) of its Ether (ETH) holdings, according to the company\u2019s statement. InvestingPro data shows the company maintains strong liquidity with a current ratio of 6.83, though its overall financial health score indicates potential risks.\n\n\"Should there exist periods where our stock trades at or below the net asset value of our ETH holdings, it would be dilutive on an ETH per share basis to issue new equity through our capital raising efforts,\" said Joseph Chalom, Co-Chief Executive Officer of SharpLink.\n\nThe company stated that repurchases may be made through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or other means permitted under applicable securities laws. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend on market conditions, share price, trading volume and other factors.\n\nSharpLink, which describes itself as one of the world\u2019s largest publicly traded companies to adopt Ether as its primary treasury reserve asset, is not obligated to repurchase any specific number of shares, and the program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\n\nThe company noted that the stock buyback program aims to provide enhanced support to the market, optimize capital allocation and reinforce its long-term commitment to driving stockholder value.\n\nBased on information from the press release, SharpLink Gaming focuses on online gaming solutions and maintains Ethereum cryptocurrency as a significant treasury asset. For deeper insights into SBET\u2019s valuation and financial metrics, investors can access the comprehensive Pro Research Report, available exclusively on InvestingPro, which covers over 1,400 US stocks with detailed analysis and actionable intelligence.\n\nIn other recent news, SharpLink Gaming reported a significant decline in revenue for the second quarter of 2025, with figures dropping to $700,000 from $1,000,000 a year earlier. The company also posted a substantial net loss of $103.4 million, largely attributed to non-cash accounting impairments and stock-based compensation. Additionally, SharpLink Gaming increased its Ether (ETH) holdings by purchasing 143,593 ETH, bringing its total to 740,760. The company paid an average purchase price of $4,648 per ETH during this period. To support its activities, SharpLink raised $146.5 million through its At-the-Market facility and secured an additional $390 million from a registered direct offering. These financial maneuvers reflect the company\u2019s ongoing efforts to bolster its balance sheet. Despite the revenue decline, these developments indicate SharpLink\u2019s strategic focus on cryptocurrency holdings and capital raising.\n\nThis article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
