  "title": "Rod Stewart, Cheap Trick Sizzle As \u2018One Last Time\u2019 Tour Hits Indy",
  "description": "Rod Stewart performed for just shy of two hours following a one hour opening set by Midwest rockers Cheap Trick as Stewart's \"One Last Time\" North American tour continues",
  "content": "\u201cIt\u2019s Saturday night!\u201d shouted Rod Stewart on stage just outside Indianapolis, early in the set as his \u201cOne Last Time\u201d tour arrived at Ruoff Music Center. \u201cWe had a wonderful crowd last night - but tonight you\u2019re gonna beat them!\u201d\n\nStewart, 80, proved to be an engaging host and energetic frontman on stage in Noblesville, Indiana, remaining in fine voice Saturday night for just shy of two hours alongside fellow classic rock stalwarts Cheap Trick.\n\nWhile known for his work as part of both the Jeff Beck Group and Faces, it\u2019s the solo material that sold best, with Stewart moving more than 120 million records globally as one of the best selling artists of all time.\n\nReleasing It Had to be You: The Great American Songbook in 2002, the first in what would become an uber-successful five album series of pop standards, Stewart would settle on a successful formula, continuing a pivot toward covers which has largely guided his career over the last 25 years.\n\nCovers made up the majority of Saturday\u2019s set on stage in the Circle City, with Stewart and company wasting no time getting to them. \u201cHere\u2019s a song from Bonnie Tyler!\u201d asserted the singer early, with two violinists soon driving \u201cIt\u2019s A Heartache.\u201d\n\nOpening with \u201cInfatuation,\u201d Steward headed to his right, carrying the mic stand overhead as he strutted and pranced.\n\nA 12 piece backing group featured a trio of backing singers and three more multi-instrumentalists in addition to live guitar, keys, bass, saxophone and dueling percussion.\n\n\u201cLast week, we were in Mississippi - the birthplace of one of my heroes growing up,\u201d Rod began to explain, noting a tour that runs into mid-September ahead of a six night Las Vegas residency (Caesars Palace starting September 24) and international dates taking him into mid-December. \u201cSo, I\u2019d like to pay tribute to Muddy Waters.\u201d\n\nStewart headed left to explore the stage\u2019s furthest reaches as cowbell and violin rang out early, offering up a bit of air guitar late as the ensemble worked up the Hambone Willie Newbern-penned cut \u201cRollin\u2019 and Tumblin,\u2019\u201d which Waters himself covered 75 years ago.\n\nA slight miscommunication found Stewart readying \u201cForever Young\u201d as the band began Kim Weston\u2019s \u201cIt Takes Two.\u201d Stopping on a dime to start again proved this show was taking place live and in the moment, a welcome deviation in an era of live performance often defined by the use of pre-recorded backing tracks at the expense of actual, authentic on stage moments.\n\nStewart sent \u201cForever Young\u201d out to recently deceased rocker Ozzy Osbourne, soon shouting out Tina Turner, with whom he collaborated on a cover of \u201cIt Takes Two\u201d in 1990.\n\nViolin and live mandolin drove a lovely take on \u201cMaggie May\u201d that more closely resembled Stewart\u2019s sort of stripped down MTV Unplugged take on his original 1971 recording.\n\n\u201cNext stop, 1976!\u201d yelled Stewart excitedly, with live harp resplendent on a warm night in Indy. Synths rang out moments later as Stewart more talked than sang his way through \u201cYoung Turks.\u201d\n\n\u201cA little sweaty,\u201d said Stewart, understating the evening\u2019s high temps. \u201cSweating my ears off!\u201d he continued. \u201cCarry on, Rod,\u201d mused the singer with a smile. \u201cHere\u2019s a song I love doing. Did this with my dear old buddy Ronnie Wood,\u201d Stewart continued, looking back upon the 1972 sessions for his fourth solo album Never a Dull Moment, one which found Wood backing him as he put his spin upon Etta James\u2019 \u201cI\u2019d Rather go Blind,\u201d ultimately dedicating the track to Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Christine McVie.\n\nA long sax solo cooked with the band stretching out late on the James cover. \u201cHow about these guys?\u201d said Stewart midway through, glancing left at his terrific band while guitar and saxophone rang out.\n\nFollowing \u201cDowntown Train,\u201d the band got a chance to work up an even greater head of steam as Stewart left the stage for the night\u2019s first costume change, diving into Chaka Khan\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m Every Woman,\u201d a trend which would continue during Stewart breaks with the stellar band later tackling Creedence Clearwater Revival via \u201cProud Mary.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you see there really is a full moon?\u201d asked Stewart, gesturing out toward the venue\u2019s general admission lawn setting and up as the crowd in front turned to gaze.\n\nDelicately plucked acoustic guitar and harp drove the early moments of \u201cYou\u2019re in my Heart (The Final Acclaim)\u201d while upright bass, piano and slow but deliberate violin enhanced the live presentation of Van Morrison\u2019s \u201cHave I Told you Lately.\u201d\n\nDistributing signed soccer balls throughout the seated pavilion, a pulsing bass and disco beat brought the capacity crowd to its feet as Stewart and company danced their way through \u201cDo Ya Think I\u2019m Sexy,\u201d with the crowd supplying the closing chorus.\n\n\u201cI used to be in a band called the Faces,\u201d said Stewart, recalling a more rollicking period which featured a future Rolling Stone on guitar as he again referenced Ronnie Wood. \u201cSo, a tribute now to my friends in the Faces!\u201d he said, finally revisiting his former band via \u201cStay With Me\u201d as Saturday\u2019s show entered its final moments via scorching slide guitar.\n\n\u201cI want to thank you very, very much from the bottom of my heart,\u201d said Stewart, wrapping up with \u201cSome Guys Have All the Luck\u201d and his take on The O\u2019Jays\u2019 \u201cLove Train.\u201d\n\nFor just about one hour on stage Saturday in Indianapolis, mighty midwestern rockers Cheap Trick set the stage for Stewart, pulling most heavily from classic albums like Dream Police and In Color.\n\n\u201cJust in case you were unsure, we are the one and only Cheap Trick! Accept no substitute,\u201d declared guitarist Rick Nielsen on stage Saturday at Ruoff. \u201cWe are thrilled to be here in Indiana with Rod,\u201d said the guitarist, introducing \u201cHe\u2019s A Whore.\u201d\n\nBookending their 60 minutes appropriately enough via \u201cHello There\u201d and \u201cGoodnight,\u201d Cheap Trick got to the hits early, working through Fats Domino\u2019s \u201cAin\u2019t That a Shame\u201d en route to one of their biggest.\n\nSirens wailed as red and blue lights flashed, setting the stage for a raucous early take on \u201cDream Police\u201d which featured drummer Daxx Nielsen joining frontman Robin Zander with a backing vocal as his father flicked picks by the dozen to lucky fans in front.\n\nNielsen noodled his way through a fun, meandering solo that ultimately gave way to \u201cCalifornia Man,\u201d with Zander initiating a classic late call and response vocal approach with the audience midway through.\n\n\u201cWhat a fine looking bunch we have here this evening\u2026\u201d deadpanned Rick Nielsen, sense of humor in check as he set up his punchline. \u201cThe girls look gorgeous - and the guys are here,\u201d joked the guitarist, introducing a Dream Police deep cut via \u201cThe House is Rockin\u2019 (With Domestic Problems).\u201d\n\nPrefacing it with a few quick lines from \u201cIt All Comes Back to You,\u201d Zander kicked off \u201cThe Flame\u201d solo acoustic shortly after a thumping but melodic Tom Petersson bass solo. \u201cOh yeah?\u201d responded Zander as the crowd reacted to the hit ballad. \u201cWell, I want you to want me!\u201d\n\nClosing with a murderer\u2019s row of hits, Zander smiled wide as he leaned into his mic stand, with Rick Nielsen shredding away on a saxophone-shaped guitar nearby as \u201cI Want You to Want Me\u201d gave way to \u201cSurrender\u201d late in Saturday\u2019s opening set.\n\n\u201cThank you, Rod Stewart for having us!\u201d shouted Rick Nielsen as Cheap Trick closed up in Indianapolis. \u201cGood night!\u201d",

      "text": "Throughout the 1960s, British Invasion artists hugely influenced culture in the United States, absorbing America\u2019s rich, but then oft-forgotten, blues tradition and sending it back via pop and rock music with massive crossover appeal.\nWhite British groups like the Beatles and Rolling Stones were covering black American artists like Chuck Berry and Willie Dixon and tallying massive hits, creating marketable stars that would impact everything from music and art to fashion and politics on both shores.\nGuitarist Ronnie Wood began carving out his niche in 1967, first in the Jeff Beck Group before moving to the Faces, ultimately landing in the Rolling Stones, overshadowed at times throughout by the virtuosity of Beck, searing vocals of Rod Stewart and even in the Stones by the iconic presence of Glimmer Twins Mick Jagger and Keith Richards.\nIn the new documentary Ronnie Wood: Somebody Up There Likes Me, Oscar-nominated director Mike Figgis (Internal Affairs, Leaving Las Vegas) traces Wood\u2019s story from his humble beginnings in Hillingdon, west London through the ups, downs and addiction that marked much of the guitarist\u2019s journey, focusing on the impact that the creation of both music and art have had on the sobriety and family life that have come to define Wood, 73, in recent years.\n\u201cI was always an admirer of the Rolling Stones. But they were in parallel narrative with the Beatles at some point. In my opinion, the Beatles were infinitely advanced songwriters and complex musicians on a level of no other band, at that time or maybe even since. But they had a very brief lifespan as an ensemble\u201d said Figgis via Skype earlier this month. \u201cWhereas the Stones was something I was very familiar with: south side Chicago blues. But, at that time, there were a bunch of really powerful blues bands. So the Stones were part of a very healthy British blues movement,\u201d said the director. \u201cI really didn\u2019t get how great they were until I made this documentary. The respect for what they do and how they maintain that energy. And the fact is, they\u2019re still here! To go out and do that stuff and stay in tune and stay in time with each other? Unbelievable.\u201d\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nFiggis is a perfect fit as director of the new Wood documentary, now available to stream through October as part of an Eagle Rock Entertainment virtual cinema release (DVD, Blu-ray and deluxe hardback book are scheduled for release October 9).\nMoving as a child from East Africa, the director grew up in the north of England and music became a steadying force. His father, a fanatical jazz fan and pianist, encouraged him and Figgis picked up trumpet at 11, guitar at 14 and more.\n\u201cI have to say, that gave me a center - socially and in many other ways. I loved it. So I absorbed it. I loved learning, and learning to improvise, and finally going to music school, formally writing music and the rest of it. And it became the center of my creative concept of how things work,\u201d explained Figgis. \u201cThe structure of music, for me, always has been the template. I guess I\u2019m conscious of that. I put it on everything. There\u2019s the counter-melody, there\u2019s the bass - it\u2019s how things work. There\u2019s this unity. So, even when I started making films, I think I started looking at film structure in that way as well. I think it informs everything that I do.\u201d\nEarly on, Figgis worked alongside future Roxy Music singer and songwriter Bryan Ferry. In 1968, Rolling Stones drummer Charlie Watts produced an album by The People Band, which featured Figgis on trumpet and guitar, recorded at famed Olympic Studios. Later, the director became acquainted with Jagger on a number of levels, working with him on potential film projects as a producer.\nIn 2003, Figgis directed Red, White and Blues, part six of Martin Scorsese\u2019s seven part PBS documentary film series The Blues, examining the relationship between UK blues/pop exports and culture in America.\n\u201cSometimes one has forgotten the roots. I used to go and see all of these bands when I was in my teens. There was a famous blues club in Newcastle called Club A\u2019Gogo. And everybody came. But you constantly had to remind yourself where these people came from. They became big stars and made much more sophisticated, kind of mainstream albums. But, most musicians, you trace them back and, at a certain point, there\u2019s a kind of raw edge there. It\u2019s such a privilege to be able to find the footage to remind people of that,\u201d said Figgis, noting performances that appear in the new documentary like film of the Faces taking on \u201cStay With Me\u201d live in 1971.\n\u201cI think his impact is huge. Because he\u2019s a catalyst. He\u2019s an ensemble man. So his love of ensemble and his ability, for example in Beck\u2019s group, to say, \u2018OK. I\u2019ll play bass.\u2019 Well, it turns out he\u2019s a really good bass player. That really impressed me. And made me really respect his musicianship that much more,\u201d said Figgis, looking back at an early Jeff Beck Group moment which saw Wood willingly move from guitar to bass. \u201cThe fact that he doesn\u2019t get bent out of shape in terms of his ego by having to play that role - he\u2019s comfortable with that role. And then you see him fronting his own band in one of the clips. He\u2019s so good as a frontman. And he\u2019s a really good singer,\u201d he continued, noting Wood\u2019s versatility, on display in the film as he handles lead vocal on a solo acoustic rendition of Faces\u2019 \u201cOoh La La\u201d and again during his own \u201cMystifies Me.\u201d\nIn addition to musicians like Stewart, each of Wood\u2019s Rolling Stones bandmates appears in conversation with Figgis during the film.\n\u201cThis band works on two guitars and it\u2019s very important who they are. It was almost as if it was predestined,\u201d says Richards during the film of Wood finally joining the Stones. \u201cIt\u2019s very finely crafted. It ain\u2019t sloppy. The sound that we\u2019ve created depends on those two guitars and how they weave together - the ancient form of weaving.\u201d\n\u201cPredestined\u201d certainly seems to be the perfect word to describe Wood\u2019s eventual role in the Rolling Stones. \u201cI want to be in that band. And one day I will be. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s gonna happen but I will be,\u201d he says in the film. Taking over for Mick Taylor 13 years into the group\u2019s career, Wood has acted as a stabilizing force now for the Stones in the 45 years since.\n\u201cThe solos became very important. He added beautiful melodic lines,\u201d adds Jagger in the documentary, noting Wood\u2019s playing. \u201cThe arena shows became slightly more humorous because of him. They became more fun.\u201d\nWhile Rolling Stones fans tend to focus on the weaving, and the on stage relationship between Richards and Wood, Figgis drills down on the bond between Jagger and Wood. During his interview, Watts singles it out too, stressing Jagger\u2019s unflinching role across decades as Wood fought for sobriety.\n\u201cHe really wanted to be a sober person. But it\u2019s very difficult to do,\u201d said Jagger. \u201cHe\u2019s better and more creative sober. Sharper. Being sober has pushed him somewhere else,\u201d concurred Wood\u2019s wife Sally.\n\u201cHe\u2019s an amazing piece of film. And he\u2019s a great raconteur. He\u2019s never short of something to say. But he thinks about what he\u2019s saying. He\u2019s really quick. And he can turn on a dime. You have to really be awake to interview him or talk to him as well,\u201d said Figgis of conversing with Wood during making of the new film. \u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is he clearly inspires enough love. He says himself, when he creates a bad situation, his first desire is to fix it - so it will go away. Self-protection meets humanity in some way. But, clearly, he inspires people enough to go that extra mile for him. He\u2019s a seriously liked person. For the most part, he\u2019s very loved.\u201d\nGrowing up, Wood was exposed to jazz and R&B by his brothers, seizing upon artists like Louis Armstrong, Fats Domino, Howlin\u2019 Wolf and Jimmy Reed. Throughout the film, the guitarist quotes everyone from John Lennon to Bobby Womack in normal conversation and it\u2019s clear that, unlike so many artists of his stature, Wood has never lost that fan connection with the music.\n\u201cWithout naming names, that\u2019s something you won\u2019t see in a lot of famous musicians. His ability to comfortably be a catalyst and a team player is tied in with this idea of respect for all kinds of of odd things,\u201d said Figgis. \u201cI think Ronnie is not in any way a snob about music. He will happily sit down with, say, a flamenco guitarist and jam - without any self-consciousness. He\u2019ll find some way of relating,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis ability to be so eclectic - because it connects to his brother and connects to his dad and the music that he was exposed to - he was identifying it all as being a source that comes together and creates a new form. I think that defines him. And makes him a healthier human being psychologically in that way.\u201d\nUltimately, Wood is clear throughout the film of his desire to learn from his mistakes and live life on his own terms without regret, a concept that comes to define the guitarist as much as any other in the documentary. \u201cSomebody up there likes me,\u201d he jokes after quitting smoking and beating lung cancer.\n\u201cSo many people - and I mean so many people - regret. And then spend time regretting. They ponder over their regret. I think the idea that defined him for me pretty early on was the idea that, \u2018I\u2019m still going forward.\u2019 Because the minute you become a regretter, you become old I think. He also says, \u2018In my mind, I\u2019m 29.\u2019 And I think that\u2019s true. He\u2019s still behaving that way!\u201d said Figgis. \u201cI hate to use the word \u2018feel good\u2019 but there is a certain positive energy about him and the story. I think it\u2019s realistic. It doesn\u2019t pull any punches. But it\u2019s positive. And there is this hope.\u201d"

We humans are losing faith in ourselves.\u201d\nThe Backlash Against Generative AI Continues\nGenerative AI has been controversial since release\u2014it\u2019s an energy-intensive invention built on the output of artists without their consent, threatening the livelihood of workers and polluting the internet with machine-made content.\nRecent concerns about AI involve the altering of real video and imagery, such as the reshaping of The Wizard of Oz to fit the Las Vegas Sphere.\nLately, AI enthusiasts have been using the technology for a more unsettling purpose, posting pictures of their deceased relatives that they have \u201canimated\u201d using AI, old photographs imbued with the appearance of life.\nMany commentators react to these re-animated clips with visceral disgust and horror, often citing works of fiction that warn against meddling with memories, or attempting to reanimate the dead.\nThe AI-generated Ozzy Osbourne tribute feels like a step toward the normalization of such practices, trivializing the memory of the deceased with images and videos that do not feature their true self, but a machine-made echo of their likeness.\nIt wasn\u2019t long ago that generative AI crossed a technological boundary, capable of creating convincing video of anyone, doing anything\u2014now, it\u2019s forcing the dead to smile for the camera."
