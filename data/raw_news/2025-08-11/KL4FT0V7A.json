  "title": "Palestinian reporters killed and foreigners barred in Israel\u2019s battle for Gaza narrative",
  "description": "Reporters and influencers covering devastation are being silenced despite protection under international law",
  "content": "Israel is running two Gaza campaigns: one for military control of the strip; another for narrative control of how the world understands what happens there.\n\nIn theory, Palestinian journalists and social media influencers documenting starvation, mass killing and other Israeli war crimes in Gaza are protected civilians under international law.\n\nBut those paper protections have meant little on the ground in Gaza, by far the most dangerous place in the world to be a reporter, where more than 180 Palestinian journalists were killed in 22 months of war, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.\n\nEven though it is illegal to target journalists, the CPJ said that over the same period 26 reporters were victims of targeted killings, which it described as murders. The most recent was the 28-year-old Al Jazeera correspondent Anas al-Sharif, killed on Sunday in his makeshift newsroom outside a hospital, along with four colleagues.\n\nPress freedom groups and journalists say those killings are part of a campaign of intimidation to shut down vital reporting, which Israel has justified internationally with smears and false claims that the targets were undercover Hamas fighters.\n\nWith international reporters barred from independent reporting in Gaza \u2013 a handful have been allowed in under Israeli military escort, but they are not allowed to move freely or speak to Palestinians \u2013 the work done by journalists in Gaza is critical.\n\n\u201cI have no doubt that the prevention of international access, the killings of journalists, the targeting of media facilities, the punishment of [Israeli] outlets like Haaretz is part of a deliberate strategy on the part of Israel to conceal what is happening inside Gaza,\u201d said the CPJ chief executive, Jodie Ginsberg.\n\nShe pointed to a recent incident when a BBC crew reported from a Jordanian military plane dropping humanitarian aid into Gaza \u2013 but was barred by Israel from filming the devastation below.\n\n\u201cWe had the example of the international news crews being allowed to film the airdrops but not the devastation when the doors opened.\u201d\n\nIn July, al-Sharif, one of the most prominent journalists still working in Gaza, went viral on social media when he broke down on air covering starvation. Passersby urged him to keep going because he gave Gaza a voice.\n\nSoon after, an Israeli military spokesperson revived allegations \u2013 first aired in 2024 \u2013 that he was a militant, including accusing him of faking mass hunger in a \u201cfalse Hamas campaign on starvation\u201d.\n\nThe CPJ issued a stark warning that those Israeli claims were a death threat.\n\n\u201cThese latest unfounded accusations represent an effort to manufacture consent to kill al-Sharif,\u201d CPJ regional director Sara Qudah said at the time. \u201cThis is not the first time al-Sharif has been targeted by the Israeli military, but the danger to his life is now acute.\u201d\n\nAl-Sharif had also anticipated his own death and described it as retaliation for his reporting in a statement released on social media. \u201cIf these words reach you, know that Israel has succeeded in killing me and silencing my voice,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIsrael has published a dossier of documents it says were recovered from Gaza and link al-Sharif to Hamas. They end in 2021, two years before the war began, and do not even attempt to address his regular appearances live on camera.\n\nA role as one of the most prominent journalists in one of the most closely surveilled places on Earth would be strikingly difficult to combine with command of a Hamas unit during an all-out war.\n\nDocuments Israel published after killing another Al Jazeera journalist last year claimed Ismail al-Ghoul was given a military rank when he was 10 years old.\n\nWhile they marshalled contradictory and unconvincing evidence, the existence of those files reflected Israeli concerns about pressure from western allies, and the need for at least the appearance of compliance with international law.\n\nDespite international pressure, Israel has not offered any explanation for the deaths of al-Sharif\u2019s four colleagues, protected civilians killed in their workplace. Ginsberg said she feared that was a warning that already unimaginable risks had escalated further.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s astonishing to me is they\u2019ve not even attempted to justify the other killings,\u201d she said. \u201cSo they\u2019re admitting to murdering those journalists, knowing they were journalists.\n\n\u201cI think this is deliberately intended to have a chilling effect to show that Israel can do what it likes, and nobody will take any action.\n\n\u201cIf we are now at a stage where Israel can so brazenly target an entire news crew, what does that mean for the safety of any of the other journalists who are operating there. Who is next?\u201d\n\nFrench historian Jean-Pierre Filiu, given rare permission to enter Gaza for academic research during the conflict, said a month researching there had also convinced him that Israel is trying to silence reporting from Gaza.\n\n\u201cNow I understand why Israel is denying the international press access to such an appalling scene,\u201d he said in an interview with Haaretz after the trip. \u201cEven though I have been in a number of war zones in the past, from Ukraine to Afghanistan, via Syria, Iraq and Somalia, I have never, but never, experienced anything like this.\u201d",

      "text": "New York, July 24, 2025\u2014The Committee to Protect Journalists is gravely worried about the safety of Al Jazeera Arabic\u2019s Gaza correspondent Anas al-Sharif, who is being targeted by an Israeli military smear campaign, which he believes is a precursor to his assassination.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee has stepped up his online attacks on al-Sharif, by falsely alleging that he is a Hamas terrorist, since the journalist cried on air while reporting on starvation in Gaza. The 28-year-old journalist has been a key source of news from Gaza for international audiences since the war began more than 650 days ago.\n\u201cWe are deeply alarmed by the repeated threats made by Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee against Al Jazeera\u2019s Gaza correspondent Anas al-Sharif and call on the international community to protect him,\u201d said CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah. \u201cThis is not the first time Al-Sharif has been targeted by the Israeli military, but the danger to his life is now acute. Israel has killed at least six Al Jazeera journalists in Gaza during this war. These latest unfounded accusations represent an effort to manufacture consent to kill Al-Sharif.\u201d\nThe IDF have made unsubstantiated claims that many of the journalists they deliberately killed in Gaza were terrorists, including four Al Jazeera staff \u2014 Hamza Al Dahdouh, Ismail Al Ghoul, Rami Al Refee, and Hossam Shabat. CPJ classifies such cases as murder.\nAl-Sharif was one of six Al Jazeera journalists that the IDF accused in October 2024 of involvement with Hamas or Islamic Jihad militant groups, a claim that the Qatari-based channel rejected as \u201cbaseless.\u201d Shabat was later killed and Talal Al Arrouqi was injured.\nTwo other Al Jazeera staff journalists \u2013 Samer Abu Daqqa and Ahmed Al-Louh \u2014 have been killed during the Israel-Gaza war, as well as eight journalists who freelanced for the channel, according to CPJ data.\n\u2018Real-life threat\u2019\n\u201cAdraee\u2019s campaign is not only a media threat or an image destruction; it is a real-life threat,\u201d al-Sharif told CPJ. \u201cAll of this is happening because my coverage of the crimes of the Israeli occupation in the Gaza Strip harms them and damages their image in the world. They accuse me of being a terrorist because the occupation wants to assassinate me morally.\u201d\nIsrael is coming under increasing pressure to stop shooting Palestinians at aid distribution points and allow more food in, amid global alarm over reports of deaths from hunger and images of emaciated children.\nIn a July 24 video, Adraee accused al-Sharif of being a member of Hamas\u2019 military wing, Al-Qassam, since 2013 and moving during the war \u201cto work for the most criminal and offensive channel.\u201d\nIn a July 23 video, Adraee described Al Jazeera\u2019s reporting on starving Palestinians as \u201ca fabricated drama starring Anas al-Sharif, who sheds crocodile tears,\u201d while playing a clip of the journalist crying while reporting on July 20.\nIn a July 20 video, Adraee played the same footage of al-Sharif crying and accused him of \u201cpropaganda\u201d and being part of a \u201cfalse Hamas campaign on starvation.\u201d\nOn July 12, responding to al-Sharif\u2019s post calling for a ceasefire, Adraee described the journalist as \u201ca mouthpiece for intellectual terrorism.\u201d\n\u2018My family is also in danger\u2019\n\u201cI live with the feeling that I could be bombed and martyred at any moment. My family is also in danger, and I have already paid the price before,\u201d al-Sharif told CPJ.\nIn December 2023, al-Sharif\u2019s 90-year-old father was killed by an Israeli airstrike on their family home, weeks after the journalist received multiple telephone threats from Israeli army officers instructing him to cease coverage and leave northern Gaza.\nIn August 2024, Adraee accused al-Sharif of \u201cpresenting a lie\u201d in his coverage of an Israeli airstrike on a school that killed dozens of displaced Palestinians.\n\u201cThis feeling is difficult and painful, but it does not push me back. Rather, it motivates me to continue fulfilling my duty and conveying the suffering of our people, even if it costs me my life,\u201d said al-Sharif.\nIsrael has banned Al Jazeera from operating inside the country and in the West Bank.\n\u201cThese threats constitute clear incitement and an attempt to assassinate my voice, either through bombing or moral distortion. However, I will not stop conveying the truth,\u201d al-Sharif said.\nIn response to CPJ\u2019s email query, the IDF\u2019s North America Media desk referred CPJ to Adraee\u2019s July 24 video.\nEditor\u2019s note: This text was updated in the sixth paragraph on August 11, 2025, to correctly identify all of the eight Al Jazeera freelancers killed as journalists."

      "text": "A prominent Al Jazeera journalist who had previously been threatened by Israel has been killed along with four colleagues in an Israeli airstrike.\nAnas al-Sharif, who was one of Al Jazeera\u2019s most recognisable faces in Gaza, was killed while inside a tent for journalists outside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on Sunday night. His funeral was held on Monday morning.\nSeven people in total were killed in the attack, including al-Sharif, Al Jazeera correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa, according to the Qatar-based broadcaster.\nThe Israel Defense Force admitted the strike, claiming the reporter had \u201cserved as the head of a terrorist cell in the Hamas terrorist organisation and was responsible for advancing rocket attacks against Israeli civilians and IDF forces\u201d.\nIt claimed it had intelligence and documents found in Gaza as proof but rights advocates said he had been targeted for his frontline reporting on the Gaza war and that Israel\u2019s claim lacked evidence.\nCalling al-Sharif \u201cone of Gaza\u2019s bravest journalists,\u201d Al Jazeera said the attack was \u201ca desperate attempt to silence voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza.\u201d\nLast month Israeli IDF spokesperson Avichai Adraee shared a video of al-Sharif on X and accused him of being a member of Hamas\u2019 military wing. At the time the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, Irene Khan, called it \u201can unsubstantiated claim\u201d and a \u201cblatant assault on journalists\u201d.\nIn July, al-Sharif told the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) that he lived with the \u201cfeeling that I could be bombed and martyred at any moment\u201d.\nAfter the attack, the CPJ said it was \u201cappalled\u201d to learn of the journalists\u2019 deaths.\n\u201cIsrael\u2019s pattern of labelling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom,\u201d said CPJ regional director Sara Qudah.\n\u201cJournalists are civilians and must never be targeted. Those responsible for these killings must be held accountable.\u201d\nThe Palestinian Journalists\u2019 Syndicate condemned what it described as a \u201cbloody crime\u201d of assassination.\nIn January this year, after a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, al-Sharif drew widespread attention when, during a live broadcast, he removed his body armour while surrounded by dozens of Gaza residents celebrating the temporary halt in hostilities.\nA few minutes before his death, al-Sharif posted on X: \u201cBreaking: Intense, concentrated Israeli bombardment using \u2018fire belts\u2019 is hitting the eastern and southern areas of Gaza City.\u201d\nIn a final message, which Al Jazeera said had been written on 6 April and which was posted to al-Sharif\u2019s X account after his death, the reporter said that he had \u201clived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification.\u201d\n\u201cAllah may bear witness against those who stayed silent, those who accepted our killing, those who choked our breath, and whose hearts were unmoved by the scattered remains of our children and women, doing nothing to stop the massacre that our people have faced for more than a year and a half,\u201d he continued.\nThe 28-year-old leaves behind a wife and two small children. His father was killed by an Israeli strike on the family home in Jabalia refugee camp in Gaza City in December 2023. At the time al-Sharif said he would continue to report and refused to leave northern Gaza.\nAnother Al Jazeera journalist in Gaza, Hani Mahmoud, said: \u201cThis is perhaps the hardest thing I\u2019m reporting about the past 22 months. I\u2019m not far from al-Shifa hospital, just one block away, and I could hear the massive explosion that took place in the past half an hour or so, near al-Shifa hospital.\n\u201cI could see it when it lit up the sky and, within moments, the news circulated that it was the journalist camp at the main gate of the al-Shifa hospital.\u201d\nAl-Sharif and his colleagues have been reporting from Gaza since the beginning of the conflict.\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to highlight that this attack is just a week after an Israeli military official directly accused Anas and directly ran a campaign of incitement on Al Jazeera and correspondents on the ground because of their work, because of their relentless reporting on the starvation and the famine and the malnutrition,\u201d Mahmoud added.\nIsrael has killed multiple Al Jazeera journalists and members of their families, including Hossam Shabat, who was killed in March, and Ismail al-Ghoul and his cameraman Rami al-Rifi, who were killed in August.\nChief correspondent Wael al Dahdouh\u2019s wife, son, daughter and grandson were killed in October 2023 and he himself was injured in an attack weeks later that killed Al Jazeera cameraman Samer Abu Daqqa.\nIsrael, which does not allow foreign journalists into Gaza and which has targeted local reporters, has killed 237 journalists since the war started on 7 October 2023, according to Gaza\u2019s government media office. The Committee to Protect Journalists said at least 186 journalists have been killed in the Gaza conflict. Israel denies deliberately targeting journalists.\nWith Reuters and Agence France-Presse"

      "text": "Ismail al-Ghoul's killing: targeted and discredited, Palestinian journalists suffer double punishment in Gaza\nOn 31 July, Al Jazeera journalists Ismail al-Ghoul and Rami al-Rifi were killed while reporting in Gaza. The next day, the Israeli army claimed that al-Ghoul was part of the military wing of Hamas, with whom the IDF is at war. This is not the first time the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) have used this accusation to justify attacks against journalists without providing any substantial evidence. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) calls for an independent investigation of these killings and for Israel to stop targeting journalists. More than 130 media professionals have been killed in Gaza by the Israeli army since 7 October, including at least 31 while doing their job.\nWhen questioned about targeting journalists, the Israeli army usually replies that these accusations \u201care false,\u201d despite mounting evidence to the contrary. Yet the day after their attack on Ismail al-Ghoul\u2019s car, the army took responsibility for killing the 27-year-old, stating on X (formerly Twitter) that it had eliminated a \u201cterrorist\u201d and \u201cjournalist.\u201d Since then, the IDF\u2019s official position has consisted of accusations discrediting al-Ghoul \u2013 without mentioning his cameraman Rami al-Rifi, who was also killed in the attack \u2013 based on insufficient, questionable evidence, according to RSF\u2019s analysis.\nThe IDF identified al-Ghoul as a member of the military wing of Hamas, the militant Palestinian group governing the Gaza strip, claiming he was a \u201cterrorist\u201d working for Nukhba, Hamas\u2019 elite unit. The IDF alleges that took part in Hamas\u2019 attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. To back up these claims, the IDF publicly released a screenshot of a list of names that dates to 2021 and was \u201cfound on Hamas computers seized in the Gaza Strip,\u201d according to their official statement. The IDF claims this document shows that, in 2021, \u201cMr. al-Ghoul was an engineer in the Hamas Gaza brigade.\u201d When RSF asked for more details on the origins of this document, the IDF merely reiterated that the computer had been found in the Gaza Strip. When asked about al-Ghoul's role in \u201cdisseminating attacks against Tsahal [IDF] troops,\u201d the IDF replied that this was intelligence information. Nonetheless, the IDF continued to accuse al-Ghoul of participating in the attack on 7 October without providing any proof, merely stating that if someone is a member of Hamas\u2019 military wing, they are a legitimate target even if they are also a journalist for Al Jazeera.\nWithout sufficient evidence for these accusations, the deliberate strike on al-Ghoul\u2019s car is \u201can obvious war crime,\u201d according to Rafa\u00eblle Maison, a law professor at the University of Paris XI who specialises in international criminal justice. \"Even if this journalist had been an engineer for Hamas in 2021, it does not justify targeting him three years later. This document is clearly insufficient evidence for targeting him, as he was sporting the gear designed to protect journalists and was clearly engaged in journalistic activity,\" she explained. According to the Geneva Convention, al-Ghoul would have lost his rights to protection as a civilian and, more specifically, as a journalist, if he \u201ctook a direct part in hostilities during that period, which is clearly not the case,\u201d said Maison.\n\u201cThe targeted killing of Al Jazeera correspondent Ismail al-Ghoul is one of the most shocking examples of impunity we have witnessed in the war in Gaza. Israeli forces have acknowledged directly targeting a journalist - an act that constitutes a war crime - and justified this attack by accusing al-Ghoul of terrorism, without legitimate evidence. No acknowledgement or explanation has been given for the killing of cameraman Rami al-Rifi alongside al-Ghoul. This outrageous act brings the tally of journalists killed in Gaza even higher, and leaves even fewer able to continue doing their jobs reporting on the war. There must be accountability for these heinous crimes, and the endless slaughter of journalists must stop without delay.\nIsmail al-Ghoul, Palestinian correspondent for the Qatari channel Al Jazeera since November 2023, was one of the few journalists still present in the north of the Gaza Strip, which is inaccessible to foreign journalists. On 31 July, al-Ghoul had just finished a live report from outside the house of Ismail Haniyeh, a Hamas leader assassinated earlier that day in Tehran, when he contacted Al Jazeera\u2019s editorial team to inform them that he and al-Rifi were evacuating the area as they\u2019d heard a bombardment nearby, according to Raed Fakih, manager of input for Al Jazeera\u2019s news directorate. After several minutes without any news, the channel tried to contact al-Ghoul without success. \u201cOur other correspondent, Anas al-Sharif, reported that there were rumours Ismail had been targeted,\u201d Fakih told RSF.\nIn a video of the strike posted on social media, the panicked cries of freelance journalist Osama al-Ashi can be heard echoing down the street. Al-Ashi runs towards a smoking car where people begin to gather. \"I knew it was Ismail. I know his jacket and car by heart,\u201d al-Ashi told RSF. The camera then shows the inside of the vehicle, where the bodies of Ismail al-Ghoul and Rami al-Rifi are unrecognisable, decapitated by the force of the impact. Yet al-Ghoul\u2019s blue jacket bearing the word \u201cpress\u201d is clearly visible.\nNumerous inconsistencies\nA number of inconsistencies in the IDF\u2019s allegations, made the day following the attack, were quickly pointed out. Firstly, Fakih notes that al-Ghoul was held and interrogated for 12 hours in March 2024. Al-Ghoul reported that his arresting officer called him by name, \u201cmaking it clear that they knew they had arrested Ismail al-Ghoul,\u201d argued Fakih. \u201cIf he were indeed a terrorist, as they claim, why would they release him?\u201d When questioned about these events, the Israeli army denied the facts and stated that al-Ghoul had never been arrested.\nWhat\u2019s more, according to the IDF\u2019s screenshot of the list of names, al-Ghoul received a military rank on 1 July 2007, when he was 10 years old. Strangely, another column on the list shows that he was recruited in 2014. When asked about this, the Israeli army said it was not responsible for the inconsistencies in a Hamas document. According to Fakih, \u201cThe document also contradicts the initial claim that he was part of an elite force and states that he was part of the engineering group. A minor who is an engineer? But, anyway, was he a member of the elite force or an engineer at the age of 16-17?\"\nTwo political and academic experts on Hamas \u2013 who wish to remain anonymous \u2013 stressed to RSF that it seems unlikely for Ismail al-Ghoul to have been recruited at such a young age, even if he had joined the group in 2014. One expert explained that, while the movement created summer camps in the past, \u201cI don't believe that is a kind of recruitment or that you would become a member of Hamas.\u201d Joining an elite unit like the Nukhba involves several years of training and tests, and recruitment usually takes place around the age of 20, the two experts added.\nAs for the document's authenticity, one of the experts stated they had never seen a similar list in the history of their research on Hamas. This does not mean that no such documents exist, yet all the experts interviewed by RSF for this article shared the same conclusion: the document could be genuine but, without further details or contextual elements, these accusations are highly uncertain. \u201cWhen such documents are released with claims of membership in Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, etc., we seldom receive the entire document [...] or other types of documentation to corroborate and so on. In other words, we have to chose taking Israeli claims and alleged evidence at face value,\u201d one expert explained.\nIrene Khan, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression, strongly condemned the attack and the charge brought against al-Ghoul. \u201cThe Israeli military seems to be making accusations without any substantive evidence as a licence to kill journalists, which is in total contravention of international humanitarian law,\u201d she said in a statement published on 6 August.\nRecurring accusations\nThis is not the first time Israel has published poorly substantiated documents to justify the targeted killings of journalists. In January 2024, after the deaths of Hamza al-Dahdouh and Mustafa Thuraya \u2013 journalists for Al Jazeera who were killed when a drone attack targeted their vehicle while they were working in Rafah \u2013 the Israeli army claimed the reporters were affiliated with the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIF) and Hamas, respectively.\nAs in the case of al-Ghoul, Israel did not provide any further details about the document incriminating al-Dahdouh, and did not release the document incriminating Thuraya. \u201cIt's a pattern with the Israelis that, after targeting our journalists, they release conflicting accounts and make baseless accusations to justify their unjustifiable actions \u2014 killing journalists who are working to cover the realities on the ground. This was the case with Shireen Abu Akleh, Samer Abu Daqqa and Hamza al-Dahdouh,\u201d said Fakih.\nMore recently, Anas al-Sharif, another Al Jazeera correspondent who was close to al-Ghoul, - was condemned by an IDF spokesperson, who used the familiar claim that the Al Jazeera reporter was both a \u201cjournalist\u201d and a \u201cterrorist.\u201d On 10 August, on X, in the wake of the strike against the Tabi'een school in central Gaza that killed at least 80 people, the spokesperson accused al-Sharif of \u201ccovering up the crimes of Hamas and jihad terrorists hiding in schools,\u201d and that al-Sharif \u201cprobably knew many of the people killed in this school.\u201d Al Jazeera strongly condemned these accusations against its journalists.\nAl Jazeera has brought these cases to international courts, and hopes \u201cto obtain justice, reveal the truth, and ensure protection,\u201d according to Fakih. As no international media can access Gaza to cover the war, Al Jazeera is all the more determined to demand justice for the journalists who live and work there but cannot leave. \u201cAt this point, we can only strive to push Israel to adhere to its moral and legal obligations regarding the principle of press freedom and the protection of journalists,\u201d said Fakih.\nRSF has filed three complaints with the International Criminal Court (ICC) calling for investigations into crimes committed against Palestinian journalists. In a statement to RSF dated 5 January 2024, the ICC Prosecutor's Office assured RSF that \"crimes against journalists are being examined by the Prosecutor's Office, among other potential crimes, as part of the ongoing investigation into the situation in the State of Palestine, and RSF's objectives and actions must be supported and are of crucial importance in Gaza and elsewhere. Journalists are protected by international humanitarian law and the Rome Statute and must not under any circumstances be targeted in the exercise of their important mission.\u201d\nTo date, more than 130 media professionals have been killed by the Israeli army in Gaza since 7 October; at least 31 were killed while doing their job."

      "text": "New York, July 11, 2024\u2014More than 70 media and civil society organizations have signed an open letter urging Israel to give journalists independent access to Gaza.\nThe organizations\u2014which include the Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, BBC, CNN, The Guardian, The New York Times, and The Washington Post\u2014point out that no independent media access to Gaza has been permitted since the start of the war, increasing the pressure on domestic journalists, and creating a space for mis- and disinformation to flourish.\n\u201cMore than 100 journalists have been killed since the start of the war and those who remain are working in conditions of extreme deprivation. The result is that information from Gaza is becoming harder and harder to obtain and that the reporting which does get through is subject to repeated questions over its veracity,\u201d the organizations say in the letter, which was coordinated by the Committee to Protect Journalists.\nThe letter comes ahead of a planned visit by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the United States, where he is set to meet with U.S. President Joe Biden and address the U.S. Congress on July 24.\nCPJ CEO Jodie Ginsberg noted: \u201cPresident Netanyahu describes Israel as a democracy. His actions with regard to the media tell a different story. International, Israeli, and Palestinian journalists from outside Gaza should be given independent access to Gaza so they can judge for themselves what is happening in this war\u2014rather than being spoon-fed with a handful of organized tours by the Israeli military.\u201d\nIn addition to news outlets, the signatories\u2014who span more than 27 countries\u2014include professional groups and organizations dedicated to defending press freedom.\nAbout the Committee to Protect Journalists\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists is an independent, nonprofit organization that promotes press freedom worldwide. We defend the right of journalists to report the news safely and without fear of reprisal.\nRead the full letter below\nWe, the undersigned, request that Israeli authorities end immediately the restrictions on foreign media entering Gaza and grant independent access to international news organizations seeking to access the territory.\nNine months into the war, international reporters are still being denied access to Gaza except for rare and escorted trips arranged by the Israeli military. This effective ban on foreign reporting has placed an impossible and unreasonable burden on local reporters to document a war through which they are living. More than 100 journalists have been killed since the start of the war and those who remain are working in conditions of extreme deprivation. The result is that information from Gaza is becoming harder and harder to obtain and that the reporting which does get through is subject to repeated questions over its veracity.\nWe fully understand the inherent risks in reporting from war zones. These are risks that many of our organizations have taken over decades in order to investigate, document developments as they occur, and understand the impacts of wars the world over.\nA free and independent press is the cornerstone of democracy. We ask that Israel uphold its commitments to press freedom by providing foreign media with immediate, independent access to Gaza, and that Israel abides by its international obligations to protect journalists as civilians.\nSignatories\n- ABC News, United States\n- Agence France-Presse, France\n- Al-Araby Al-Jadeed\n- Alternative Press Syndicate, Lebanon\n- Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism\n- Asian American Journalists Association, United States\n- Associated Press, United States\n- Association for International Broadcasting, United Kingdom\n- Association of Foreign Press Correspondents, United States\n- Bangladeshi Journalists in International Media, Bangladesh\n- BBC News, United Kingdom\n- Bianet, Turkey\n- Bloomberg News, United States\n- CBS News, United States\n- CNN Worldwide, United States\n- CONNECTAS\n- Community Media Forum Europe, Belgium\n- CTV News, Canada\n- Daily Maverick, South Africa\n- Daraj, Lebanon\n- Denik Referendum, Czech Republic\n- European Broadcasting Union, Switzerland\n- European Federation of Journalists\n- Financial Times, United Kingdom\n- Forbidden Stories, France\n- fotosintesi.info, Italy\n- Free Press Unlimited, The Netherlands\n- Global Investigative Journalism Network\n- Global Reporting Centre, Canada\n- International Association of Women in Radio and Television\n- International Center for Journalists, United States\n- International Fund for Public Interest Media\n- International Media Support, Denmark\n- International News Safety Institute, United Kingdom\n- International Women\u2019s Media Foundation, United States\n- ITN, United Kingdom\n- Le Mauricien, Mauritius\n- McLatchy, United States\n- Media Development Center, Tunisia\n- Media Diversity Institute, United Kingdom\n- Middle East Eye\n- National Association of Hispanic Journalists, United States\n- National Press Club, United States\n- National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, The Philippines\n- NBC News, United States\n- Nieman Foundation for Journalism, Harvard University, United States\n- NPR, United States\n- Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project\n- Premium Times, Nigeria\n- Prospect Magazine, United Kingdom\n- Public Media Alliance\n- Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, United States\n- Rory Peck Trust, United Kingdom\n- RT\u00c9 News & Current Affairs, Ireland\n- Rural Media Network, Pakistan\n- Sky News, United Kingdom\n- SMN24Media, Sri Lanka\n- Somali Media Women Association, Somalia\n- Sveriges Radio, Sweden\n- The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, United Kingdom\n- The Foreign Press Association, Israel and the Palestinian Territories\n- The Guardian, United Kingdom\n- The Irish Times, Ireland\n- The New Arab\n- The New York Times, United States\n- The Washington Post, United States\n- Twala, Algeria\n- Vocento, Spain\n- VRT News, Belgium\n- Wattan Media Network, Palestine\n- World Association for Christian Communication\n- World Association of News Publishers (WAN-IFRA), Germany\n- Yle News and Current Affairs, Finland"

      "text": "The death of the prominent Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif, killed along with four colleagues in an Israeli airstrike on Sunday, prompted condemnation from around the world, as hundreds of mourners carried their bodies through the streets of Gaza City.\nSharif, one of Al Jazeera\u2019s most recognisable faces in Gaza, was killed while inside a tent for journalists outside al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City on Sunday night. Seven people were killed in the attack, including the Al Jazeera correspondent Mohammed Qreiqeh and the camera operators Ibrahim Zaher, Mohammed Noufal and Moamen Aliwa, according to the Qatar-based broadcaster.\nOn Monday, the Guardian visited the site where the journalists were killed. Wadi Abu al-Saud, a Palestinian journalist who was near the tent when the Israeli strike occurred on Sunday, said the attack happened at 11.22pm, just after he had finished filming his latest news bulletin.\n\u201cI entered the tent opposite theirs, raised my phone to make a call, and then the explosion occurred, Saud said. \u201cA piece of shrapnel hit my phone. I looked back and saw people burning in flames. I tried to extinguish them. Anas and the others had died instantly from the strike.\u201d\nIn two videos of the aftermath of the strike, Saud can be seen carrying the bodies of those killed. \u201cFrom now on, I will not continue the coverage,\u201d he said. \u201cI will return to my life as a citizen. The truth has died and the coverage has ended.\u201d\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) admitted carrying out the attack, claiming Sharif was the leader of a Hamas cell responsible for rocket attacks against Israel \u2013 an allegation that Al Jazeera and Sharif had previously dismissed as baseless.\nIt was the first time during the war that Israel\u2019s military has swiftly claimed responsibility after a journalist was killed in a strike.\nPro-Israel advocates on social media hailed the killing of Sharif and posted photos handed out by the IDF of photos the journalist took with the former Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, taken before Hamas\u2019s attack on 7 October.\nSara Qudah, the Middle East and north Africa director at the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), said: \u201cIsrael\u2019s pattern of labelling journalists as militants without providing credible evidence raises serious questions about its intent and respect for press freedom.\u201d\nIn July, Sharif told CPJ that he lived with the \u201cfeeling that I could be bombed and martyred at any moment\u201d.\nReporters Without Borders condemned the \u201cacknowledged murder by the Israeli army\u201d of Sharif in Gaza and called on the international community to intervene.\nKeir Starmer\u2019s spokesperson said: \u201cWe are gravely concerned by the repeated targeting of journalists in Gaza. Reporters covering conflicts are afforded protection under international humanitarian law and journalists must be able to report independently without fear, and Israel must ensure journalists can carry out their work safely.\u201d\nThe UN human rights office condemned the targeting of the journalists\u2019 tent, saying it was \u201cin grave breach of international humanitarian law\u201d.\nAl Jazeera said the attack was \u201ca desperate attempt to silence voices in anticipation of the occupation of Gaza\u201d and called Sharif \u201cone of Gaza\u2019s bravest journalists\u201d.\nPeople gathered at Sheikh Radwan cemetery in the heart of the Gaza Strip to mourn the journalists, whose bodies lay wrapped in white sheets at al-Shifa hospital before their burial. Friends, colleagues and relatives embraced and consoled one another.\nThe area where the attack took place was crowded with media workers on Monday, some speaking to cameras or mobile phones, others taking photos.\nIslam al-Za\u2019anoun, a news correspondent for Palestine TV and several Arab channels who participated in the funeral, said Sunday\u2019s attack was \u201ca turning point in the world of journalism\u201d.\nShe said: \u201cDespite all the threats he received and the Israeli media\u2019s incitement against him, al-Sharif continued reporting. Now one question haunts me: Who will be next on the list? Will it be me?\u201d\nBilal Abu Khalifa, a presenter at Al Jazeera, said he had met Sharif four days ago. \u201cHe told me he was in danger,\u201d Abu Khalifa said. \u201cI asked him not to go out or appear publicly too often. He gave me a very simple answer: Bilal, I will not leave Gaza except to the sky! I will not leave Gaza even if I am killed. I know I am on the assassination list, but I will continue to expose the crimes of the Israeli army against my people and show the world, and everyone who stands by them, the truth.\u201d\nIn a final message, which Al Jazeera said had been written on 6 April and which was posted to Sharif\u2019s X account after his death, the reporter said he had \u201clived through pain in all its details, tasted suffering and loss many times, yet I never once hesitated to convey the truth as it is, without distortion or falsification.\u201d\nHe continued: \u201cAllah may bear witness against those who stayed silent, those who accepted our killing, those who choked our breath, and whose hearts were unmoved by the scattered remains of our children and women, doing nothing to stop the massacre that our people have faced for more than a year and a half.\u201d\nAfter the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023, Israel barred international journalists from entering Gaza \u2013 one of the rare moments when international reporters have been denied access to an active war zone. Since then, the task of documenting the war has fallen heavily on Palestinian journalists, often at the cost of their lives \u2013 themselves caught in its devastation, displaced multiple times, their homes reduced to rubble, friends and relatives killed, and at times queueing for food at perilous distribution points.\nAccording to Gaza\u2019s government media office, 238 journalists have been killed by Israel since the war started. CPJ said at least 186 journalists had been killed in the Gaza conflict. Israel denies deliberately targeting journalists.\nIn a report released this year, the Watson School of International and Public Affairs\u2019 costs of war project said more journalists had been killed in Gaza than in both world wars, the Vietnam war, the wars in Yugoslavia and the US war in Afghanistan combined."

      "text": "The Israel-Gaza war has taken a catastrophic toll on Gazan journalists since Israel declared war on Hamas following its attack on Israel on October 7, 2023.\nAs of August 11, 2025, CPJ\u2019s preliminary investigations showed at least 192 journalists and media workers were among the more than tens of thousands killed in Gaza, the West Bank, Israel, and Lebanon since the war began, making it the deadliest period for journalists since CPJ began gathering data in 1992.\nCPJ is investigating more than 130 additional cases of potential journalists killings, arrests, and injuries, and damage to media offices and homes, cases that remain difficult to document and verify amid these harsh conditions and devastation.\nJournalists in Gaza face extreme, often fatal, risks as they try to cover the war, including relentless Israeli airstrikes, the destruction of most of the territory\u2019s infrastructure, the forced displacement of 90% of Gaza\u2019s population, trauma, and widespread famine.\n\u201cSince October 7, 2023, Palestinian journalists have been slaughtered with impunity, while the world watches. This is a direct, unprecedented assault on press freedom,\u201d said CPJ Regional Director Sara Qudah. \u201cJournalists cannot carry out their work \u2014 let alone survive \u2014 while being deliberately starved and denied life-saving aid. Israel must allow humanitarians, international media, and human rights investigators into Gaza at once.\u201d\nAs of August 11:\n- 192 journalists and media workers were confirmed killed: 184 Palestinian, two Israeli, and six Lebanese.\n- 129 journalists were reported injured.\n- 2 journalists were reported missing.\n- 90 journalists were reported arrested.\n- Multiple assaults, threats, cyberattacks, censorship, and killings of family members.\nMost Palestinian journalist killings \u2014 two-thirds \u2014 were caused by Israeli airstrikes. The second most frequent cause of death was by drone strike, with more than two dozen press members killed.\nIn the days surrounding the war\u2019s one-year anniversary on October 7, 2024, two journalists in Gaza were killed and three were injured, prompting CPJ to renew its call for an end to impunity in Israel\u2019s attacks on journalists.\nTargeted murder of journalists\nJournalists are civilians and protected by international law. Deliberately targeting civilians constitutes a war crime.\nTo date, CPJ has determined that a total of 26 journalists and media workers were directly targeted and killed by Israeli forces, cases that CPJ classifies as murders.\nThe 24 journalists murdered are: Ahmad Qalaja, Ahmed Mansour, Anas al-Sharif, Ayman Al Gedi, Fadi Hassouna, Faisal Abu Al Qumsan, Ghassan Najjar, Hamza Al Dahdouh, Hilmi al-Faqaawi, Hossam Shabat, Ismail Al Ghoul, Ismail Baddah, Issam Abdallah, Mahmoud Islim Al-Basos, Moamen Aliwa, Mohammad al-Khaldi, Mohammed Al-Ladaa, Mohammed Noufal, Mohammed Qreiqeh, Mustafa Thuraya, Rami Al Refee, Suleiman Hajjaj, and Wissam Kassem. The two media workers are Ibrahim Sheikh Ali and Mohammed Reda Ibrahim.\nCPJ continues to investigate at least 20 other cases that show signs of possible targeting.\nIsrael Defense Forces (IDF) officials have repeatedly told media outlets that the army does not deliberately target journalists. Shortly after the war started, the IDF also told news agencies that it could not guarantee the safety of journalists operating in Gaza. CPJ has called for an end to the longstanding pattern of impunity in cases of journalists killed by the IDF.\nThe list of killed journalists documented in our database includes names based on information obtained from CPJ\u2019s sources in the region and media reports. It includes all journalists* involved in news-gathering activity. It is not always immediately clear whether all of these journalists were covering the conflict at the time of their deaths, but CPJ has included them in its count as it investigates their circumstances.\nThe list is being updated on a regular basis, with names being removed if CPJ confirms that those members of the media were not working journalists at the time they were killed, injured, or went missing.\nThe lists below detail those injured and missing in the Israel-Gaza war:\nINJURED\nCPJ is aware that many Palestinian journalists have been injured during the war. CPJ counts the journalists\u2019 cases it has been able to document and continues to investigate others.\nJuly 27, 2025\nIsraeli forces shot and injured Abdul Hadi Farhat, a 27-year-old correspondent for the television channel Yemen Today, in the left thigh while he covered the entry of humanitarian aid in northern Gaza.\u201c\nI heard that Israeli forces had opened a humanitarian corridor to allow aid into the Al-Sudaniya area northwest of Gaza City. I went to document the scene, where thousands of starving Palestinians had gathered,\u201d Farhat told CPJ. \u201cI filmed the first aid truck arriving, and as the second came through \u2013 around 11 a.m. \u2013 soldiers opened fire and launched shells at us.\u201d\nFarhat, a father of two, told CPJ that he bled for a long time and had to administer first aid to himself before reaching Hamad Hospital in Al-Sudaniya. From there, he was transferred to Al-Shifa hospital in western Gaza City, where he waited for two hours without treatment due to overcrowding and shortages of medical supplies. Eventually, he went to Al-Sahaba Medical Complex, where the bullet was removed and the wound stitched. He has returned home to recover.\nOn November 9, 2024, Farhat was also wounded when Israeli airstrikes hit the courtyard of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah.\nJuly 24, 2025\nAhmad Hamdan, a 26-year-old freelance photojournalist who has worked with Agence France-Presse news agency, Qatari-funded media outlets Al-Araby TV, Al Jazeera, and AJ+, and Turkish state-owned Anadolu Agency, was injured in the leg and head after an Israeli drone struck his family\u2019s tent in western Gaza City. Several members of his family were also injured, and at least three \u2013 his uncle and two children \u2013 were killed.\nHis colleague Anas Al-Sharif, a reporter for Al Jazeera, told CPJ that Hamdan is originally from Beit Hanoun in northern Gaza and had been documenting life in the north, where few other journalists remained.\nFollowing the Israeli forces\u2019 destruction of his Beit Hanoun home, Hamdan and his family were displaced to a tented area near the Legislative Council building in western Gaza City, where the drone strike occurred. He was transferred to the city\u2019s Al-Shifa hospital for treatment.\nJuly 23, 2025\nGevara Safadi, a 38-year-old photographer, was injured by shrapnel from an Israeli airstrike in Gaza City\u2019s Sheikh Radwan neighborhood. He was at home when an Israeli warplane struck a neighboring house around 6 p.m., according to his wife, Sanaa Al-Safadi.\nSafadi, who works for the satellite broadcaster Al-Kofiya TV, affiliated with the Democratic Reform Current within the Fatah Movement, also contributes to the Turkish state-owned Anadolu Agency and is the father of three daughters.\n\u201cOur home was partially damaged, and Gevara was hit by shrapnel all over his body \u2014 most seriously in his right side,\u201d his wife told CPJ, adding that he was taken to a neighborhood clinic for treatment and discharged an hour later to recover at home.\nJuly 22, 2025\nOsayd Mdoukh\nOsayd Mdoukh, a 38-year-old camera operator for the satellite broadcaster Al-Kofiya TV, which is affiliated with the Democratic Reform Current within the Fatah Movement, told CPJ he was injured after being run over by an aid truck entering northern Gaza.\nMdoukh, a father of three, told CPJ he had not received his $400 salary for three months due to soaring commission fees charged by money changers \u2013 sometimes as high as 50%.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t feed my wife and children for nearly a month,\u201d Mdoukh said, explaining why he went to Zikim, near the border, where limited aid convoys were entering.\n\u201cAround noon, the trucks came in. As I reached them along with the crowds, I was run over. The truck drove over me, causing internal bleeding, fractures throughout my body, and a severe hematoma in my left thigh,\u201d Mdoukh said.\nHe was taken to the Palestinian Red Crescent\u2019s field hospital in central Gaza City and remained there in late July, without access to necessary treatment.\nJuly 17, 2025\nZahar Saleh, a 22-year-old Palestinian freelance photojournalist who contributes to Britain\u2019s Channel 4 News broadcaster, was injured by Israeli drone fire in central Gaza City.\nHe had been reporting on Israel\u2019s bombing of a church in Gaza\u2019s Old City that morning, the journalist\u2019s brother, Abdel Hakim Saleh, told CPJ.\n\u201cZaher went to document the aftermath,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter finishing his documentation, he went to a central Gaza location that offers internet access to send out his footage. Around noon, an Israeli drone fired on him, hitting him in the left thigh.\u201d\nSaleh was transported to Jerusalem Hospital in Gaza City\u2019s Tel al-Hawa neighborhood. He was treated for three hours and was scheduled to undergo surgery this following week, his brother told CPJ on July 17.\nJuly 15, 2025\nAkram Dalloul, a 40-year-old correspondent for the Lebanon-based broadcaster Al-Mayadeen, was injured by shrapnel from Israeli missile fire in Gaza City\u2019s eastern neighborhood Al-Zeitoun.\nDalloul, a father of four, had just finished filming a televised report in his neighborhood around 10:30 a.m. when the area came under fire, according to his colleague, Al-Mayadeen camera operator Wissam Baalusha.\n\u201cI went with Akram and our fellow cameraman Abdulaziz Al-Afifi to film a report for Al-Mayadeen in Al-Zaytoun, where Akram lives,\u201d Baalusha told CPJ. \u201cAfter finishing, Abdulaziz and I got into the car to leave, and Akram started walking toward his house. Moments later, Israeli artillery fired a shell. We rushed back and found Akram had been hit by shrapnel on the left side of his head.

  "argos_summary": "The article discusses the perilous situation for journalists in Gaza amidst the ongoing conflict, highlighting the targeted killings of reporters by Israeli forces, including the recent death of prominent Al Jazeera journalist Anas al-Sharif and four colleagues in an airstrike. Despite international laws protecting journalists, over 180 Palestinian journalists have been killed since the conflict escalated, with many being labeled as militants by the Israeli military without credible evidence. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and other press freedom organizations express grave concerns over the systematic targeting of media personnel, which they argue is part of a broader strategy to control the narrative surrounding the war.",
