  "description": "European markets were down on Friday following a mixed session in Asia ahead of an anticipated U.S. inflation report.",
  "content": "European shares were trading lower on Friday following a mixed session in Asia as investors awaited a key U.S. inflation report.\n\n\n\nEconomists expect the U.S. personal consumption expenditures index, due later in the day, to show inflation remained at about 2.6% in July.\n\n\n\nThe futures for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 0.3%. Oil prices were also lower.\n\n\n\nIn early European trading, Germany\u2019s DAX shed 0.6% to 23,901.77 as the latest figures showed unemployment remained at 6.3% in July, for a sixth straight month. Adjusted for seasonal factors, it topped 3 million for the first time in a decade.\n\n\n\nBritain\u2019s FTSE 100 lost 0.3% to 9,191.08 while the CAC 40 in Paris fell 0.7% to 7,712.11.\n\n\n\nDuring Asian trading, Tokyo\u2019s Nikkei 225 fell 0.3% to 42,718.47 after a slew of data released Friday showed Japan\u2019s factory output slumped in July as higher tariffs hit on exports to the United States. Inflation in Tokyo also slowed to 2.6% year-on-year, while the jobless rate fell to 2.3% in July from 2.5% in June.\n\n\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s Japanese data was mixed, with disappointing industrial production threatening third-quarter growth, while a tight labor market points to increased wages and underlying inflation remaining firm,\u201d ING Economics said in a commentary. \u201cWe still think October is the most likely timing for a Bank of Japan rate hike.\u201d\n\n\n\nHong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng index rose 0.3% to 25,077.62, while the Shanghai Composite index added 0.4% to 3,857.93. Shares in computer chipmaker Cambricon Technologies shed 6% after soaring 15.7% on Thursday, closing at 1,492.49 yuan (about $209) a share. But it remained the priciest stock on Shanghai\u2019s exchange after displacing Kweichou Moutai, whose shares gained 2.3% to 1,480 yuan ($207.50).\n\n\n\nChinese computer chipmakers have seen their share prices surge as the government provides heavy support to encourage wider manufacturing and use of chips made in China.\n\n\n\n\u201cHyper-growth in China\u2019s tech landscape is starting to feel like a zero-sum cage fight rather than a clean runway. Even Cambricon\u2019s AI chip story, this week\u2019s darling, is now flashing red lights, warning of trading risks after an 8% skid,\u201d Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.\n\n\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s KOSPI shed 0.3% to 3,186.01, while Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200 edged 0.1% lower to 8,973.10.\n\n\n\nTaiwan\u2019s TAIEX shed earlier gains and was down less than 0.1%, while India\u2019s BSE Sensex slipped 0.1%.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, the S&P 500 rose 0.3%, lifting the benchmark index to its second record high in a row. The Dow Jones Industrial Average reversed an early slide and gained 0.2%, enough to move past its record high set last Friday.\n\n\n\nThe Nasdaq composite closed 0.5% higher, finishing just short of its all-time high set two weeks ago.\n\n\n\nGains in the technology and communication services sectors offset losses elsewhere in the market.\n\n\n\nTech giant Nvidia fell 0.8% a day after reporting quarterly earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street analysts\u2019 forecasts, though the company noted that sales of its artificial intelligence chipsets rose at a slower pace than analysts anticipated.\n\n\n\nTraders also had their eye on new government reports on the job market and economy.\n\n\n\nThe Labor Department reported that applications for unemployment benefits fell last week, the latest sign that employers are holding onto their workers even as the economy has slowed.\n\n\n\nThe most recent government data suggests hiring has slowed sharply since this spring.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that U.S. gross domestic product \u2014 the nation\u2019s output of goods and services \u2014 grew at a 3.3% annual pace in the April-June quarter after shrinking 0.5% in the first three months of this year due to the fallout from the Trump administration\u2019s trade wars.\n\n\n\nStill, the sluggishness in the job market is a key reason that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled last week that the central bank may cut its key interest rate at its meeting next month.\n\n\n\nIn other dealings on Friday, U.S. benchmark crude lost 42 cents to $64.18 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, slid 41 cents to $67.57 per barrel.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. dollar rose to 147.00 Japanese yen from 146.95 yen. The euro fell to $1.1675 from $1.1684.",
