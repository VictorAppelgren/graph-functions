  "description": "While 'Bon App\u00e9tit Your Majesty' serves up plenty of chemistry between Lim Yoon-a and Lee Chae-min, the real star of this drama is the fine cuisine.",
  "content": "While Bon App\u00e9tit Your Majesty serves up some delicious chemistry between stars Lim Yoon-a and Lee Chae-min, the real star of this Korean drama may be the fine cuisine. Not since Dae Jang-geum has there been a k-drama so dedicated to satisfying a discerning royal palate. The sweet and thrilling love story between modern-day chef Yeon Ji-young (Lim) and feared Joseon-era tyrant Lee Heon (Lee), demonstrates the persuasive power of a well-prepared feast.\n\n\u201cWhat sets our drama apart is that it takes cooking seriously.,\u201d said director Jang Tae-you, who happens to know a lot about love stories, since he directed Painter of the Wind, Deep Rooted Tree, My Love from the Star, Hyena, and Lovers of the Red Sky. \u201cThe lead isn\u2019t just a chef in name\u2014food is at the heart of the story. A king who changes through food, the relationship between cuisine and politics, between food and romance. This is a story born from the hands of a chef.\u201d\n\nIn that sense Bon App\u00e9tit reminds the director of his past drama Painter of the Wind, where paintings weren\u2019t just props\u2014they were like main characters. Similarly, in Bon App\u00e9tit Your Majesty, every episode features one or two signature dishes created by Yeon Ji-young.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we got the script, we consulted with culinary professors to research, plan, and design each dish\u2014how to cook it and how to film it,\u201d said Jang at a recent press conference. \u201cWe even had a dedicated sub-team focused solely on food styling and preparation. A lot of effort went into making sure viewers could almost taste the dishes just by looking at them on screen. It was a real challenge, but also an incredibly fun one. Rather than focusing on the time-travel element itself, our main emphasis was on the clash between the greatest chef of the modern era and the greatest tyrant\u2014and gourmet\u2014of 500 years ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe theme of cooking was very intriguing,\u201d said Lim, also known simply as Yoona. \u201cI\u2019ve always been interested in cooking, and since this story revolves around it, I was drawn in. Yeon Ji-young is a character who returns to the past, constantly pioneers a new life, and chases her dreams, which felt hopeful and inspiring to me. I was captivated by her honesty and boldness, which is why I chose Bon App\u00e9tit Your Majesty.\n\nThe Girls Generation singer and actress spent months preparing for the role. Lim (King The Land, Big Mouth) attended a cooking academy for three months to learn basic knife skills and food preparation.\n\n\u201cI also learned some of the specific dishes featured in the drama from our culinary advisor,\" said Lim. \"I used to cook casually as a hobby, but now I\u2019m even familiar with professional cooking terminology. Knife work is still challenging, but I feel my skills have improved compared to before. That said, dishes requiring intricate knife techniques were the most difficult. Both knives and fire can be dangerous, but thanks to the crew\u2019s careful safety measures, I was able to cook safely throughout filming.\u201d\n\nFinding the right actress to play the chef was crucial to the drama\u2019s success. The actress needed to have historical drama experience and to fit the image of a successful chef.\n\n\u201cI wondered if any actress could embody this\u2014and I hoped maybe Yoona could,\u201d said Jang. \u201cFortunately, our schedules aligned, and it felt like fate. She amazed me by personally mastering so many aspects of the role with great dedication.\u201d\n\nLee Chae-min (Hierarchy, See You In My 19th Life) also spent months preparing for his role.\n\n\u201cLee Chae-min trained every day without fail, practicing horseback riding, archery, and physical conditioning,\u201d said Jang. \u201cAs you\u2019ll see in the drama, his character frequently shows his abs on screen, which is a very challenging role for an actor. But thanks to Lee Chae-min\u2019s dedication and hard work, I was able to film those scenes whenever I wanted. I\u2019m truly grateful and more than 120% satisfied with his performance. He not only prepared thoroughly but also delivered excellent results. You\u2019ll be able to see it on screen.\u201d\n\nHis character is very charismatic.\n\n\u201cI focused on faithfully bringing that to life through my performance, said Lee. \u201dI focused on playing the role with quiet confidence. The director also told me that charisma comes from having a sense of composure. So I tried to think, act, and deliver my lines with calmness and ease to express Lee Heon\u2019s charisma.\u201d\n\nLee appeared in almost every scene, said co-star Choi Guy-hwa (Squid Game, Revenant). Choi plays Prince Jesan, a member of the royal family.\n\n\u201cLee Chae-min had a huge number of scenes\u2014he was hardly ever off screen\u2014which must have been tough, but he pulled it off brilliantly,\u201d said Choi. \u201cEvery time I saw him, I found myself giving a thumbs-up because he was doing such a great job. The workload for both Lee Chae-min and Lim Yoon-a was immense, with a huge amount of dialogue and many demanding scenes, yet they barely had any NGs. Their stamina and passion was truly impressive.\u201d\n\nLim looked forward to working with Lee and their teamwork exceeded expectations.\n\n\u201cHe has incredible focus,\u201d said Lim. \u201cWe often talked about our characters together, which made filming very comfortable. When he appeared wearing the royal robes, he truly became King Lee Heon\u2014his voice, presence, and concentration were outstanding, and that helped me stay focused on my role as Yeon Ji-young.\u201d\n\nAs a fan of Lim\u2019s, Lee found it an honor to act alongside her.\n\n\u201cShe was always supportive and would adjust her lines with me so I could perform comfortably,\u201d said Lee. \u201cShe\u2019s also really skilled at cooking\u2014her movements were so precise that during the cooking scenes, she barely made any mistakes. It was impressive to watch.\u201d\n\nThe drama features 12 episodes\u2014as if serving a royal 12-dish meal. Each episode has its own flavor\u2014sometimes salty, sometimes sweet, said the director. So, how does this food-inspired love story compare to the director\u2019s past works?\n\n\u201cHonestly, I barely remember my past works compared to this one,\u201d said Jang. \u201cThe real joy of Bon App\u00e9tit, Your Majesty comes from watching the chemistry between these two. Since their love story is built through food, their chemistry had to be conveyed through taste, aroma, and atmosphere\u2014not just physical gestures. From the moment I saw them together, I felt they were a perfect match, like a beautiful picture. Even during the hug and kiss scenes, the staff told me their hearts fluttered watching them.\"\n\nThe drama also stars Kang Ha-na (Start Up, My Roomate Is A Gumiho) as Lee Heon\u2019s ambitious concubine. She\u2019s not fond of sharing the king\u2019s attention and will likely resent his appetite for the chef\u2019s dishes.\n\nBon App\u00e9tit Your Majesty is produced by Studio Dragon, the Korean entertainment studio behind the TV dramas Signal, Guardian: The Lonely and Great God, Mr. Sunshine, My Mister, Crash Landing on You, Sweet Home, Vincenzo, Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha, Yumi\u2019s Cells, Twenty Five Twenty One, Our Blues, Alchemy of Souls, Little Women, Under the Queen\u2019s Umbrella, The Glory, Crash Course in Romance, Marry My Husband, Queen of Tears, Jeongnyeon: The Star is Born, and Our Unwritten Seoul. The story is based on a web novel by Park Kuk-jae published via . It airs on Netflix.",

      "text": "Lee Jun-ho plays hotel executive Gu Won in the romantic comedy King The Land. It\u2019s a drama that has gained considerable attention for the romantic scenes between Lee and his co-star Im Yoona. Lee, known simply as Junho, plays the classic male k-rom-com lead\u2014perfect, aloof and yet no stranger to trauma. Yoona plays Sa-rang, a brightly optimistic employee at the King Hotel, which is run by Gu Won\u2019s family. Despite their obvious differences, they fall in love, but have to hide their affection from his potentially disapproving family as well as her curious co-workers and friends.\nIt\u2019s an upbeat comedy that\u2019s quite different from his previous drama The Red Sleeve where he played the real-life King Jeongjo. The Red Sleeve was a popular and critical success, winning Lee multiple awards.\n\u201cI think The Red Sleeve was a masterpiece that lingers in people\u2019s minds,\u201d said Junho. \u201cWhen it came to choosing my next work, I examined scripts with the hopes of having a different genre or atmosphere from my previous work. In that sense, I found King the Land a very easy-to-watch drama. It seemed like anyone could catch up on it even watching it from the middle of an episode. I decided to participate in this drama because I felt that it was like a small kind of healing that anyone could, at any time, turn on while eating or going somewhere and still enjoy it comfortably. Shooting The Red Sleeve gave me hope that a good atmosphere on the set creates good work. Maybe that\u2019s why I thought that if I took responsibility and worked together with the staff and actors on the set, we could produce an enjoyable drama, and, while shooting, I hoped viewers also could feel the atmosphere.\u201d\nTo play King Jeonjo in The Red Sleeve, the left-handed actor practiced right-handed chopsticks and learned calligraphy and horseback riding. He also lost 16 kilos (35 pounds) to make his character look more sensitive.\n\u201cFor King the Land, on the contrary, I tried to bulk up,\u201d he said. \u201cGu-won is a figure who despises smiles due to his wounds in the past and he has a cynical attitude. I wanted to express Gu-won\u2019s cynical side or overwhelming impression even when he says nothing.\u201d\nHe worked out with the aim of looking physically imposing even when his character wasn\u2019t wearing a suit.\n\u201cI tried to portray Gu-won as an unemotional and lifeless character, to show how he gradually finds his lost smile through Sa-rang,\u201d said Junho. \u201cI aimed to depict Gu-won\u2019s gradual change as the story develops.\u201d\nHis romantic partner in King the Land is an actress with a similar k-pop background. Film and TV drama star Yoona is also a member of a popular k-pop group Girls Generation. Along with Junho, she hosted the Korean music show Gayo Daejejeon in 2021 and 2022, but they knew each other long before that.\n\u201cSince long before we hosted MBC Gayo Daejejeon together, as a singer and an actor, we go back a long way, more than 15 years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt also applies in my younger days, but at this point in my career, if I meet someone, we become comfortable colleagues and friends wherever we meet. Since we both have careers as singers, we felt comfortable as colleagues and friends. But it was a different feeling to work together as an actor on the set. We approached the work professionally with each other\u2019s role and had fun shooting with good chemistry.\u201d\nTheir chemistry is noteworthy, but the romcom also features some hilarious buddy chemistry with actor Ahn Se-ha, who plays Gu Won\u2019s sassy assistant No Sang-ik. Junho notes that the actors had a great time helping and encouraging each other just like their characters.\n\u201cIt was my first time working with Ahn Se-ha, and I remember that every shoot was fun and games,\u201d said Junho. \u201cWe did our first shoot together and did a great tiki-taka from the very beginning. Gu-won and Sang-sik are very different, however, at the same time, hit it off with each other.\u201d\nAs well as being a popular actor, Junho is a singer, songwriter, dancer, composer and member of the k-pop band 2PM. He debuted as an actor in the film Cold Eyes and after that appeared in the dramas Good Manager, Rain or Shine, Wok of Love and The Red Sleeve. Idols are sometimes criticized when they attempt to transition to acting, but Lee\u2019s performances silenced criticism. He was the first idol actor to win Best Actor at Korea\u2019s PD Awards and also took home awards for Most Popular Actor and Best Actor - Television at the 58th Baeksang Arts Awards.\nAlthough Junho is now an in-demand leading man, he still performs with 2PM, which also includes singer-actors Ok Taecyeon, Nichkhun and Hwang Chansung. JYP Entertainment announced earlier this year that the band would do a Seoul concert in September to celebrate their 15th debut anniversary. While Lee may have debuted as a singer, acting always appealed to him.\n\u201cFrom the beginning, I had a dream of becoming an actor too,\u201d said Junho. \u201cThere was also the dream of becoming a singer. I think where I started my career doesn\u2019t matter. I just want to always act in all sincerity and become a versatile actor who can play different roles.\u201d\nHe\u2019s fond of romantic comedies. Comedy adds touches of realism to romance.\n\u201cI think many people like romcoms in that they can put their worries behind them while watching a drama,\u201d said Junho. \u201cAnd it makes their hearts flutter and gives them pleasure. As I wanted to do work that makes people enjoy and relax, I happened to meet this drama.\u201d\nThe SLL drama is currently airing on Netflix"

      "text": "Ahn Bo-hyun plays Seo-ha in the recently completed fantasy drama See You In My 19th Life. While Seo-ha has no memory of any past lives he is mired in his own past, unable to move beyond the tragic events that shaped him.\nWhen Seo-ha is approached by Ji-eum, played by Shin Hye-sun, she claims she can remember her past lives. She tells him that her most recent life involved loving and vowing to protect him. Naturally, it\u2019s hard for Seo-ha to believe. Although her claims are pretty fantastic, he does eventually recognize the person he lost and learns to love again. While Ahn\u2019s drama character is grateful for Ji-eum\u2019s ability to remember past lives, the actor isn\u2019t sure such an ability might be an advantage in real life.\n\u201cI thought about it multiple times,\u201d said Ahn. \u201cBut I believe the present is more important.\u201d\nWhile Ahn might not want to remember every detail of his past lives, he chose to appear in the Studio Dragon drama because he couldn\u2019t resist the story\u2019s romantic premise and hopeful message.\n\u201cThe fantasy element of reincarnation formed into a drama was intriguing and captivating,\u201d said Ahn. \u201cPersonally, I feel that the message is, \u2018broken hearts can be healed.\u2019\u201d\nSee You In My 19th Life is based on a Naver webtoon of the same name written by Lee Hey. It\u2019s not the first webtoon-inspired drama Ahn has appeared in, since he played a rich bully in Itaewon Class and Yumi\u2019s boyfriend in Yumi\u2019s Cells. Dramas based on webtoons are increasingly popular partly because the stories are so wildly creative.\n\u201cI don\u2019t necessarily prioritize webtoon-based shows, but there seems to be many interesting pieces with captivating themes and well-structured stories among them,\u201d said Ahn.\u201d I believe this is why it is gaining more popularity than before and more people want to see them.\u201d\nAhn\u2019s acting resume spans various genres. Last year he played a military prosecutor in the campy military legal drama Military Prosecutor Doberman and before that he was the gym owner second lead in Her Private Life. Whatever role he takes, Ahn admits to being a perfectionist.\n\u201cI usually do not allow myself to give up easily,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause of this, even after becoming an actor, I tend to be quite self-critical and set strict standards for myself.\u201d\nHis only goal as an actor is to continually deliver great performances. Ahn can also be seen in the film 2 O\u2019Clock Date, a romantic comedy, co-starring Im Yoon-ah. She plays a woman with a secret and Ahn plays her neighbor.\nSee You In My 19th Life airs on Netflix"

      "text": "In the Korean fantasy rom-com My Roommate Is A Gumiho, Jang Ki-yong plays a gumiho, a mythical nine-tailed fox that can transform into an irresistibly attractive human. Being attractive helps gumihos seduce humans so they can easily steal their energy, which gumihos need to stop being monsters. Unfortunately, the extraction process usually harms the person involved.\nJang has long dreamed of acting in a fantasy rom-com such as My Roommate Is A Gumiho.\n\u201cI was excited that I could act the part of a gumiho,\u201d said Jang. \u201cI was acting a role called Shin Woo-yeo, but I thought it\u2019d be fun to make it my own.\u201d\nAfter 999 years Woo-yeo is very close to becoming human. He needs just a smidgen more human energy. While Woo-yeo has coldly accepted his desired fate involves harming humans, he becomes oddly tenderhearted and overly concerned when he meets Lee Dam, played by Lee Hyeri. He could extract her energy and realize his goal, but he cares for her and wants to protect her. The scary gumiho of horror stories shows a softer side.\nJang is adept at creating layered characters that audiences can believe are both vicious and vulnerable. In 2018 he won a Best New Actor Award at the Apan Star Awards for his role in My Mister, playing a coldhearted loan shark who occasionally betrays his fragility. In 2019, in the drama Kill It, he played a veterinarian by day and a killer at night. In the 2020 drama Born Again, he played a character and his very different reincarnation. Striking the right balance with Woo-yeo took a while.\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy to understand Woo-yeo\u2019s emotions and situations at first,\u201d said Jang. \u201cBut the more difficult it was, the more I wanted to challenge myself. Also, I talked with the director a lot even before the shoot and started to fully understand my character.\u201d\nJang became an actor by chance. His interest in fashion first led to a modeling career that won him a few awards.\n\u201cI was working as a model and I got a chance to act in a music video and a web drama,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was fascinating and fun to express myself in front of a camera. That\u2019s why I continued my career in acting.\u201d\nAs well as pursuing a busy acting career he continues to model for high-profile brands such as Est\u00e9e Lauder and Lancome. Although he is comfortable around cameras, Jang admits to being quite shy. Appearing in films such as Sweet and Sour and dramas such as Come and Hug Me, and Search: WWW helped boost his confidence, yet stardom has not completely changed his personality.\n\u201cI\u2019m still very shy and I tend to get nervous most of the time,\u201d said Jang. \u201cBut it\u2019s definitely getting easier to express myself. I\u2019ve met really nice people through dramas, so I\u2019m learning a lot from them.\u201d\nAs well as the film Sweet and Sour and the drama My Roommate Is a Gumiho, Jang has signed on to another drama this year, Now We Are Breaking Up, a romantic story with co-star Song Hye-kyo. His popularity continues to surprise him.\n\u201cI got into acting because I liked expressing what I had inside of me and I was sure that I could show various sides of me,\u201d he said. \u201cI have more to show and I have more potential, so I\u2019m really grateful for all the opportunities that come my way.\u201d\nJang is also grateful to his fans for watching the drama.\n\u201cThank you so much for supporting me from afar,\u201d said Jang. \u201cI\u2019m really glad that our drama is doing really well. Everyone, including the actors and staff members, had so much fun while shooting it, so please support it until the end. I hope I can say thank you in person soon. Thank you!\u201d\nMy Roommate Is A Gumiho is iQIYI\u2019s first original Korean production."

      "text": "The students who attend the fictional Jooshin High School are not very nice to each other. The rich students, whose parents can pay for tuition, look down on the scholarship students, who are cautioned to keep their place in the hierarchy. Those who don\u2019t \u201cknow their place\u201d often face verbal and physical harassment. And so it continues until a new scholarship student arrives and refuses to be defined by anyone\u2019s expectations.\nThe students in the k-drama Hierarchy are played by a cast of talented young actors, that includes Roh Jeong-eui as Jung Jae-I, the daughter of a conglomerate family; Kim Jae-won as Kim Ri-an, the entitled heir to the Jooshin Group; and Lee Chae-min as Kang-ha, the scholarship student who transfers to Jooshin High School to solve a tragic mystery. Fortunately, the stars of Hierarchy did not share the negative high school experiences of their characters.\nAccording to Lee his school days were peaceful. \u201cInstead of being divided by hierarchy,\u201d said Lee. \u201cEveryone got along.\u201d\nKim attended a high school for the arts, studying theater and film. That\u2019s one reason his high school experience was completely different from attending Jooshin High School, where the uniform could indicate your social rank.\n\u201cThere was no such thing as hierarchy or class among friends,\u201d said Kim, with a laugh. \u201cWe also all wore ties of the same color.\u201d\nKim, who has worked as a a model since middle school, began dreaming of becoming an actor in high school. He liked modeling, but was drawn to the way acting would allow him to express himself.\n\u201cI was quicker than my friends in deciding my career when I was younger,\u201d said Kim. \u201cAnd I pursued my dream of becoming an actor while standing on the stage for a school play. I think the biggest difference was that my high school was one where students that attended the school dreamed of being in the field of arts, like myself.\u201d\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\nRoh notes that if she ever attended a school like Jooshin High, she would try to avoid attracting attention. \u201cI think I would have attended school very quietly, without being aware of the circumstances, while really enjoying school lunch,\u201d she said with a laugh.\nLee would also have kept to himself. \u201cI think rather than belonging to a certain group, I would have protected what belonged to me,\u201d said Lee. \u201cWhile studying quietly and not being interested in anyone else.\u201d\nKim would definitely not have lived like his character Ri-an, although he can understand where the character was coming from. \u201cIn terms of my actual personality, I am quite bright and active,\u201d said Kim. \u201cSo, I think I would have tried to get along with friends. I think Ri-an was more edgy in school because he had to equip himself with an attitude that was fit for an heir since his childhood.\u201d\nDespite being mean to each other on camera, the actors enjoyed hanging out when filming stopped. \u201cSince filming was just filming, we got along well with one another, comfortably,\u201d said Roh with a laugh. \u201cAfter the director shouted out \u2018cut\u2019, we played pranks on one another, shared fans when it was hot and also gathered together in front of the air conditioner. We had even more fun when the camera was rolling because we had each other.\u201d\nThe cast members enjoyed each others\u2019 company. \u201cWe normally had meals together and also talked a lot,\u201d said Lee.\nThe five actors in the main cast, which also includes Ji Hye-won and Lee Won-jung, were all close. Offscreen they shared snacks and monitored each other\u2019s scenes. Once shooting resumed, the actors renewed their fictional relationships..\n\u201cI thought the confrontational relationship between Ri-an and Kang Ha was crucial while shooting Hierarchy,\u201d said Kim. \u201cIn order to portray this, I believed the charisma of Ri-an in the drama series was a significant factor in persuading the viewers. I did my best to express this diligently with a sense of responsibility. So, when I was in a scene with Kang Ha, I tried to maintain an emotional line that was slightly sharper. In contrast, since this cold and edgy character had to love only one woman, I tried to depict a warm gaze as much as possible when I was shooting scenes with Jae-I.\u201d\nRoh, who previously appeared in the dramas Our Beloved Summer, 18 Again and The Great Show, really enjoys the whole process of creating a character and communicating with people as she acts. \u201cI want to continue to learn and mature through various pieces in the future as well,\u201d she said.\nFor Lee, who appeared in See You In My 19th Life and Crash Course in Romance, the process of examining and researching a character, studying and analyzing the life of that person, is what he loves most about acting.\n\u201cIt always feels novel to me and gives me immense joy,\u201d said Lee. \u201cI also feel a different sense of joy when I see the synergy that emerges from the cast members through acting featured through the camera. I would like to widen my acting spectrum by challenging myself to take on more diverse roles.\u201d\nWhat Kim likes best about acting is the ability to live various lives depending on the character that he portrays and the ability to freely express diverse emotions.\n\u201cThus, I want to try out different roles regardless of the genre,\u201d said Kim, who previously appeared in King The Land and Our Blues. \u201cAbove all, fans are the very people who motivate me, Kim Jae-won. When I think of my fans who always encourage me and show me affection, I am able to feel strong no matter how tiring or difficult the shooting was. I hope that I will always be able to humbly take in the love and encouragement provided to me by my fans and also be motivated by them.\u201d\nThey each had fun filming Hierarchy. What Roh liked the most were the people. \u201cFriends, directors and all the staff members were so marvelous,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone endeavored so the youths of \u2018hierarchy kids\u2019 could be well embodied. They helped us so that we could act in a comfortable setting. I am so grateful, and I was really happy.\u201d\nLee was thankful for the ability to grow as an actor.\n\u201cI could have fun while acting on the set, feeling the vibrant energy from the cast members similar in age to myself,\u201d said Lee. \u201cAnd I could also learn a lot while seeing and hearing various forms of acting on the set. I was infinitely thankful on site because I benefited so much as I gained elements that allowed me to grow as an actor.\u201d\nKim was happy to have met Ri-an, who was not similar to any character he played before. \u201cI did my utmost to live the life of Ri-an during the filming period that lasted for about six months in order to understand this edgy and cold-hearted person with a personality that is different from my true personality. By doing so, I think I could act naturally while being completely immersed and not mimicking someone else. This was an experience that was precious and valuable to me as an actor. In that aspect, I was very pleased because I could master the attitude that I should have as an actor on my own. I think it is a huge miracle that Hierarchy rose to No.1 globally. I want to express my sincere gratitude to viewers because it seems that viewers truly understand our efforts.\u201d\nHierarchy airs on Netflix.\nThis interview was edited for length and clarity."
