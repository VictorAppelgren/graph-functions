  "content": "Vladimir Putin is a savvy Trump-whisperer. He knows exactly what flavours of flattery to employ, what enticements to offer.\n\nThe US President is arguably the most powerful and influential leader in the world, but he craves the approval of his peers. He admires Putin\u2019s strong-man image and wants to be a member of that club.\n\nPutin is not the grandmaster of three-dimensional chess that some pundits make him out to be. But simply by setting foot on American soil today, he will be the winner in a high-stakes geopolitical game.\n\nThis is his first visit to the US since 2015, when Barack Obama was trying to isolate Russia from the rest of the world at the UN General Assembly.\n\nThat was a brutally awkward occasion for both leaders. This time, the Russian media is playing up the notion of a thaw in Russian-American relations, with the prospect of renewed business deals as well as peace talks.\n\nPutin is emphasising his credentials as an international statesman, the head of a superpower that commands fear and respect.\n\nThat strengthens his domestic standing, no matter what the outcome of the talks. He need make no concessions because he can afford to walk away from the table.\n\nHis opening position, therefore, will be aggressive and ambitious. This is the Russian way, and it is one Trump often deploys himself: begin with outrageous, intimidating demands in order to force the opponent on to the back foot. Then haggle and make a great show of give-and-take, without ever yielding a genuine compromise.\n\nTo outside observers, it might seem the most Russia could expect is to keep the 20 per cent of Ukraine it has occupied by military force over the past three-and-a-half years. But Putin wants much more.\n\nHe will almost certainly try to insist that Kyiv cede more territory, land that will otherwise be invaded and conquered yard by bloody yard.\n\nHe will want to impose limits on the size of Ukraine\u2019s standing army in future, to ensure his forces are met with less resistance if and when he renews his offensive.\n\nOf course, he will permit Ukraine to make no military alliances \u2013 membership of Nato is out of the question \u2013 although he has signalled that he would have no objections to it joining the European Union, presumably thinking this would bring economic and political disruption with it.\n\nAnd as a pre-condition for any ceasefire, he will ask for most of the US sanctions to be lifted, in return for access to Russian oil. In other words, Putin\u2019s conditions for a ceasefire will amount to total victory.\n\nThe chief danger is not that the US will refuse to comply. If talks reach an impasse, Putin will appear all the stronger, while Trump will have failed as a deal-maker \u2013 something his ego can never permit.\n\nBut it\u2019s possible that Putin, who has become Russia\u2019s absolute ruler during more than 25 years in power, will be tripped up by his own ego. He is surrounded by yes-men who don\u2019t dare tell him the truth \u2013 as evidenced by his initial conviction that the \u2018special operation\u2019 to annex Ukraine would be over within three days and that his troops would be greeted as liberators.\n\nHe sometimes displays a cringey lack of self-awareness \u2013 though not on the scale of Trump\u2019s inability to moderate his behaviour. When the Russian dictator agreed to be interviewed by fawning American broadcaster Tucker Carlson last year, Putin began with a long and rambling lecture about the historic status of Ukraine as a Russian province. If he repeats that performance, Trump will lose patience very quickly.\n\nBut it is impossible to envisage a meltdown from either man. Putin has a keen sense of how far to goad an opponent. At a meeting in 2015 at the Vatican, he kept Pope Francis waiting for over an hour \u2013 a tactic he uses against many political opponents as a none-too-subtle show of disdain.\n\nOn the other hand, he has never been late for a meeting with the far more powerful President Xi Jinping of China.\n\nSome of his gamesmanship is simple bullying. During talks in 2007 with Angela Merkel, then Germany\u2019s Chancellor, he notoriously had his labrador Konni brought into the room and casually allowed it to sniff her \u2013 knowing she was terrified of dogs.\n\nHe will not attempt such macho posturing with Trump. But he may well hint at an underlying contempt. He respects sober, serious politicians and, while Trump no doubt covets Putin\u2019s stolen billions (the Russian may, in fact, be the richest man in the world), he sees himself as the CEO of United States Incorporated, and other nations as real estate.\n\nPutin once described the US President as yarki. Told that this translated as \u2018bright\u2019, Trump was delighted. But in Russian the word actually means \u2018colourful\u2019, and that\u2019s an ambiguous compliment at best. As ever, what Putin says today, and what he really means, might be two very different things.\n\nMark Galeotti is honorary professor at the University College London School of Slavonic and East European Studies.",

      "text": "Vladimir Putin has used these identical tactics and trickery before when he sparked war in Georgia... the West must punish this thug as he rips apart another nation, writes IAN BIRRELL\nWhen Georgia was on the verge of joining Nato in 2008, Russia\u2019s president Vladimir Putin stirred up bitter separatist tensions, made baseless claims of genocide, and carried out military exercises nearby.\nHis proxies fired pot-shots over the border, then evacuated civilians from areas under their control, on the bogus pretext of saving them from aggression.\nThere was a short war that ended with Russian tanks 30 miles from the capital Tbilisi and two chunks of the country breaking away as self-declared republics.\nBut the former KGB chief denied he had any imperial ambitions, insisting Russia had \u2018no wish or grounds to encroach on the sovereignty of former Soviet republics\u2019.\nHow hollow those words sound now as history looks set to repeat itself, with this hateful dictator using identical tactics and trickery in Ukraine.\nJust as when he invaded and illegally annexed Crimea in 2014, he is operating through proxies to achieve his aims of corroding democracy and thwarting a sovereign nation\u2019s desire to find stability under the defensive shield of Nato.\nYet for all his talk of Western influence in Ukraine, Putin\u2019s real aim is simple: To prevent democracy from infecting his own blighted citizens and leading them to challenge his corrupt regime, one that has failed them so badly.\nVladimir Putin\u2019s real aim is simple: To prevent democracy from infecting his own blighted citizens and leading them to challenge his corrupt regime, one that has failed them so badly. Pictured: Putin addresses the nation on the recognition of independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics\nOnce again we see Putin\u2019s stooges in two breakaway republics \u2013Donetsk and Luhansk in the Donbas region of eastern Ukraine \u2013 fabricating attacks and evacuating civilians.\nAnd, once again, Putin makes phoney assertions of genocide, as well as lying about Ukrainian attacks on mother Russia.\nWith his customary twisting of the truth, the president claimed last night he had always treated his neighbour in an \u2018honest way and with respect to Ukraine\u2019s interests\u2019.\nThat could not be further from reality \u2013 especially as he signed the decree formally recognising the two republics, paving the way for a possible further invasion that might have cataclysmic consequences for our continent.\nThe current conflict began in 2014 when a corrupt Russian-backed president of Ukraine fled after pro-democracy protests erupted across the nation following his decision to abandon moves to sign a co-operation deal with the European Union.\nPutin reacted to the ousting of his ally by stealing Crimea \u2013 the first annexation of sovereign territory in Europe since the Second World War.\nHe then sent in his tanks and troops when it seemed Ukraine was on the point of crushing rebels that he supported in Donbas.\nThis led to full-scale fighting, followed by a peace deal known as Minsk 2 that resulted in a 173-mile frontline across eastern Ukraine between the Kiev regime and the two self-declared republics. The conflict, which left 14,000 people dead and two million people displaced, has flickered ever since.\nRussian and Belarus soldiers during joint exercises of the armed forces of Russia and Belarus as part of an inspection of the Union State's Response Force, at a firing range near Brest\nU.S. Army soldiers assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, deployed to Poland to reassure NATO allies and deter Russian aggression\nThe hastily-agreed peace treaty, backed by Putin and signed under pressure by Kiev, was imperfect and never fully implemented. It envisaged \u2018special status\u2019 for the two \u2019republics\u2019 \u2013 although their status and political structures were ill-defined \u2013 and would have given Russia control over Ukraine\u2019s future.\nNow Putin has torn up the treaty after a carefully-choreographed routine that began last Tuesday when the lower house of the Russian parliament voted to ask their puppet-master to recognise the separatist regions.\nThen the Russian leader called a meeting of his security council, at which ministers and security chiefs lined up to demand recognition of the \u2018republics\u2019. \u2018We were left with no choice,\u2019 claimed foreign minister Sergey Lavrov.\nSo what can we deduce from the latest manoeuvres?\nFirst, that Putin has effectively stolen another chunk of Ukraine and breached international law by undermining another nation\u2019s territorial integrity \u2013 even if those in charge of the \u2018republics\u2019 have not yet asked to formally join Russia as I write.\nHowever, they have signed a \u2018friendship and mutual assistance\u2019 treaty which means Putin can be asked to send in \u2018military assistance\u2019 or \u2018peacekeepers\u2019 \u2013 and last night, in an ominous move, it emerged he has already given an order to send his armed forces into the \u2018republics\u2019.\nGiven the forces massed on the border and his ceaseless lies about Ukrainian attacks and Nato aggression, this could lead to \u2018defensive\u2019 intervention elsewhere in the country.\nIndeed, if full-scale war erupts, the start might be dated to last Thursday when the shelling across the border was massively increased \u2013 from an average of five a day to 60 \u2013 66 on Friday, and more than 100 on Saturday.\nMeanwhile, Putin claimed last night that \u2018Ukraine\u2019s military strategy is nothing less than the preparation for military actions against Russia\u2019 \u2013 an absurd suggestion that would be suicidal for Kiev given the imbalance of forces between the two nations.\nWe must hope the West stands firm and imposes every possible sanction on this brutal thug to punish him as he rips apart a neighbouring nation based on specious historical arguments and makes preparations to invade again on utterly spurious grounds. Pictured: Boris Johnson on Monday\nYet this malevolent dictator \u2013 with four yachts and a billion-pound palace on the Black Sea \u2013 who has overseen the pillaging of his resource-rich nation by his band of patsy oligarchs, even had the cheek to argue that corruption had eroded Ukrainian \u2018statehood\u2019 and Kiev\u2019s politicians were robbing their people.\nHaving spent five weeks in Ukraine \u2013 and having previously been witness to the appalling events of 2014 \u2013 I can feel only sorry for all those decent people I have met and interviewed whose only desire is peace and security for themselves, their families and their friends.\nAnd my sorrow extends to a nation that has been struggling to escape the Soviet shadow in pursuit of democracy but is being dismembered by a despot who once worked for the Communist secret police and now seeks to protect himself and his thieving pals from his own people.\nWe must hope the West stands firm and imposes every possible sanction on this brutal thug to punish him as he rips apart a neighbouring nation based on specious historical arguments and makes preparations to invade again on utterly spurious grounds.\nMost watched News videos\n- Drunk passenger escorted off plane after hitting people with his belt\n- Family beats woman for complaining about their misbehaving child\n- Incredible moment dolphin joins family for morning swim in Dorset\n- New Oct 7 footage shows kidnapped Israeli led through Gaza by Hamas\n- Furious motorists complain over 13-inch high 'killer kerb'\n- Bodycam released of Sha'carri Richardson being arrested at airport\n- 'Frankenstein' rabbit seen with growths sprouting from its head\n- Man charged with felony for throwing a sandwich at police officer\n- Horned Frankenstein animals appear as rare virus spreads\n- Hunter Biden says Jeffrey Epstein introduced 'Melania to Trump'\n- Shocking moment wobbling plane's wing hits runway during landing\n- What is turning cute rabbits into horned creatures with black tentacles?"

      "text": "Angela Merkel accuses Putin of gleefully 'enjoying' her discomfort after Russian president brought his pet Labrador into meeting with German chancellor despite her having a fear of dogs\nAngela Merkel has accused Vladimir Putin of enjoying her discomfort after the Russian president brought his pet Labrador into a meeting despite her fear of dogs.\nFollowing the pair's first meeting in Sochi in 2007, the German Chancellor claimed that Putin had deliberately brought along his pet Connie in an attempt to intimidate and unnerve her.\nPutin, at the time, dismissed the claims and told German publication Bild: 'I did not know anything about that,' when quizzed on his intentions.\nThe incident became infamous in Germany with claims that that it was part of a power strategy by Putin to gain an advantage in their all-important first meeting.\nNow, speaking to The Times, Merkel has opened up on her relationship and history with the Russian leader, claiming he knew perfectly well that she was frightened of dogs.\n'I could tell from Putin's facial expressions,' she wrote, 'that he was enjoying the situation'.\nPutin purportedly asked Merkel at the beginning of the meeting when Connie entered the room: 'The dog does not bother you, does she? She's a friendly dog and I'm sure she will behave herself.\n'No, she doesn't eat journalists after all,' Merkel responded to Putin in his native Russian, in what was thought to be an attempt to make light of the situation.\nAngela Merkel claimed that Vladimir Putin had deliberately brought along his pet Connie to their first meeting in an attempt to intimidate and unnerve her, knowing she was scared of dogs\nShe has now claimed she believes Putin enjoyed her discomfort at the 2007 meeting in Sochi\nMerkel was pictured nervously smiling during the meeting as the big black Labrador sat by her feet\nWith her legs crossed and her hands firmly clasped together in her lap, Merkel was a picture of tension as she tried to disguise her longstanding fear of canines\nAlthough she was laughing during the conversation, images from the 2007 meeting show how hard the German politician was trying to hide her fear.\nPhotos show Merkel wearing a nervous smile as she looked down at the large black dog while it walks towards her.\nWith her legs crossed and her hands firmly clasped together in her lap, Merkel was a picture of tension as she tried to disguise her longstanding fear of canines.\nPutin said that Connie, who died aged 15 in 2014 and was a gift from Russia's Minister of Defence Sergey Shoigu, was a friendly dog.\nFollowing a tense first meeting, it seemed Merkel would keep up her reservations surrounding the Russian President for several years to come.\nIn 2022, Merkel defended her approach to Ukraine and Russia during her 16 years as Germany's leader, saying she had 'nothing to apologise for'.\nIn her first substantial comments since she left office, Merkel said there was 'no justification whatsoever' for the 'brutal' and illegal war of aggression, adding that Putin had made 'a big mistake'.\nShe warned the tyrant president wanted 'to destroy Europe' and urged the EU 'to stick together now'.\nIn her recent conversation with The Times, Merkel also went on to share her feelings about Donald Trump's first term as President of the United States of America.\nMerkel revealed in her book that she scolded herself for prompting Donald Trump to shake her hand in front of cameras when they met in 2017. Pictured: The pair attend the NATO summit at the Grove hotel in Watford, northeast London, on December 4, 2019\nIn her book, she revealed she scolded herself for prompting him to shake her hand in front of cameras when they met in 2017 before realising his rudeness was deliberate.\nHe wanted to create conversation fodder through his behaviour,' she wrote, while she was acting 'as though I were having a discussion with someone completely normal'.\nShe concluded from her Washington visit: 'There could be no cooperative work for an interconnected world with Trump.'\nBut she did explain how although the pair had experienced some mutual tension, she found herself agreeing with him on one issue.\n'There was a point that I have to accept: he said that our expenditure for defence was not enough,' she admitted.\nMerkel herself had argued for this, but failed to persuade coalition partners.\n'But, otherwise, just stay firm. You don't have to be especially friendly, but you don't have to be especially harsh. Just be however you are as a person. You have to make the best of the situation. And especially don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.'"

'They have no real idea what's happening in this region. But they should know, they're paying for much of it in ways they might not fully perceive.'\nIt's not clear when Carlson's video statement was taken or whether the interview has already happened. He did not say when the sit-down will air.\nTucker Carlson has announced that he has interviewed Vladimir Putin because 'Americans are not informed' about the war in Ukraine\nCarlson would be the first American to interview Putin since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022\nRussian state media outlet Sputnik aired footage on Monday which it said showed Carlson's car leaving the Kremlin.\n'Americans have a right to know all they can about a war they're implicated in,' Carlson added in the four-minute clip taken in Moscow.\nHe went on to call the world's English-language media corrupt, claiming they 'lie to their readers and viewers' and that 'it is his duty to inform' the public.\nCarlson repeated the unconfirmed claim that the Biden administration illegally spied on him three years ago to stop him from interviewing Putin. He then claimed the federal government 'did the same thing once again.'\n'But this time, we came to Moscow anyway,' he said, adding that he paid for the trip himself, 'and did not take money from any government or group.'\n'We are not here because we love Vladimir Putin. We are here because we love the United States and want it to remain prosperous and free,' Carlson claimed.\nThe commentator also stated that Elon Musk had 'promised not to suppress or block this interview.'\n'Western governments, by contrast, will certainly do their best to censor this video and other less principled platforms because that\u2019s what they do,' Carlson added.\nThe video statement comes after days of speculation over Carlson's trip to Moscow, and whether it would include an interview with the tyrant.\nPutin has not saw down with an American journalist since June 2021, when he spoke with NBC\u2019s Keir Simmons.\nVeteran journalist Christiane Amanpour responded to Carlson's video message, noting that western journalists indeed have made attempts to interview Putin.\nShe wrote: 'Does Tucker really think we journalists haven't been trying to interview President Putin every day since his full scale invasion of Ukraine? It's absurd -- we'll continue to ask for an interview, just as we have for years now.'\nRussian state media fueled the rumors on Monday, posting a video they claimed showed Carlson leaving the Russian Presidential Administration. The outlet, however, would still not confirm the interview took place.\nThe former Fox News star also kept his cards close to the chest on Monday, after Russian media showed pictures of him at several spots around Moscow, including at a box at the Bolshoi Theatre and eating at a hotel.\nFormer Fox News host Tucker Carlson (center), 54, was spotted in the Russian capital at a Spartacus performance in Bolshoi Theatre, according to media in Russia\nA picture of Carlson appears to show him at a Spartacus performance at the Bolshoi Theatre\n'It is beautiful,' Carlson said of Moscow in an interview aired by the Izvestia newspaper. 'I just wanted to see it because, you know, I have read so much about it but I have never seen it before.'\nWhen asked if he was in Moscow to interview Putin, Carlson said: 'We'll see' and smiled.\nThe Kremlin has also refused to confirm it Putin would be sitting down with the American podcaster.\nCarlson reportedly arrived in the capital on February 1 and was spotted at a Spartacus performance in the Bolshoi Theatre.\nBack in 2021, Carlson claimed the National Security Agency began 'spying' on him after he said he was trying to interview Putin.\nCarlson said that his communications were intercepted by the NSA, and that his identity - which should by law have been kept a secret - was 'unmasked' by senior intelligence officials.\nHe claimed that the content of his emails and texts was then disseminated, in a bid to discredit him.\nThe conservative, who has defended Putin in the past, has opposed America's support for Ukraine and suggested that the West is to blame for the invasion.\nHis show Tucker Carlson Tonight was once the most viewed cable news show in the US before it was taken off-air in April 2023.\nMost watched News videos\n- Drunk passenger escorted off plane after hitting people with his belt\n- Family beats woman for complaining about their misbehaving child\n- Incredible moment dolphin joins family for morning swim in Dorset\n- New Oct 7 footage shows kidnapped Israeli led through Gaza by Hamas\n- Furious motorists complain over 13-inch high 'killer kerb'\n- Bodycam released of Sha'carri Richardson being arrested at airport\n- 'Frankenstein' rabbit seen with growths sprouting from its head\n- Man charged with felony for throwing a sandwich at police officer\n- Horned Frankenstein animals appear as rare virus spreads\n- Hunter Biden says Jeffrey Epstein introduced 'Melania to Trump'\n- Shocking moment wobbling plane's wing hits runway during landing\n- What is turning cute rabbits into horned creatures with black tentacles?"

      "text": "Trump is no Russian agent - the abysmal truth is he's cosying up to Putin to make colossal amounts of money: DOMINIC LAWSON\nWhen Ukrainian civilians were being blown apart by intensified Russian bombardment at the weekend, after Washington had \u2018blinded\u2019 Kyiv by cutting off its access to US signals intelligence, a satisfied-looking President Donald Trump said Moscow was \u2018doing what anyone else would do\u2019.\nHe then emphasised his closeness to the man behind the slaughtering: \u2018I\u2019ve always had a good relationship with Putin \u2026 I think he\u2019s going to be more generous than he has to be.\u2019\nThis latest, callous, expression of Trump\u2019s partiality for the aggressor over the victim has caused renewed lurid speculation about the origins of his policies, which overturn more than 75 years of Western collective security.\nIn particular, it is being said once more that Trump is the Kremlin\u2019s agent, and that this derives from an incident in Moscow in the 1990s when he was secretly filmed in depraved activities with prostitutes. Kompromat, they call it.\nHowever, not only did the original propagator of this story \u2013 an ex-MI6 officer named Christopher Steele \u2013 fail to provide a shred of evidence for it, let alone the film itself, there are two other straightforward reasons for rejecting the claim that Trump is a Russian intelligence asset.\nFirst, the whole point about a secret agent is that he is not obvious about his allegiance: at all times, he must seek to disguise it.\nYet President Trump is completely open about his affection for the Kremlin\u2019s spymaster-in-chief, and spectacularly so during that grotesque baiting of Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office, when he yelled: \u2018Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phoney witch-hunt where they used him \u2013 and Russia, Russia, Russia.\u2019\nSecond, kompromat, or blackmail, in plain English, only works by exploiting the target\u2019s fear of shame \u2013 and Trump is a man incapable of shame.\nTrump divides the world into winners and losers - Putin, in his view, is an epic winner, writes DOMINIC LAWSON\nThis attribute is his greatest asset. It enables him to lie effortlessly (one might say that lying is his first language), and to declare today the opposite of what he said yesterday.\nNo, the truth is far less murky, but speaks much worse of Trump than if he were a victim of blackmail: he just thinks Vladimir Putin, the mass murderer, is altogether admirable.\nTrump divides the world into winners and losers. Putin, in his view, is an epic winner. And the fact that the Russian president uses the most brutal of methods to win, is a further reason for Donald Trump\u2019s infatuation: it means he is a \u2018strong guy\u2019.\nThis is also the basis of his admiration for China\u2019s Communist President Xi Jinping. As Trump simpered during the 2024 election campaign: \u2018He\u2019s a brilliant guy. He controls 1.4billion people with an iron fist.\u2019\nBut there is something else that makes Trump seek to be best chums with Putin. The occupant of the Kremlin is the richest man in Russia \u2013 maybe in the whole world. And Trump the businessman craves the company of the mega-billionaires (a status he has always aspired to).\nYou could see that in the way the richest men in the US \u2013 not just Elon Musk, but also Mark Zuckerberg of Meta and Jeff Bezos of Amazon \u2013 were given pride of place at Trump\u2019s inauguration in the Capitol.\nIt was Sir William Browder who first identified Putin as the richest man in Russia. Browder had himself been the biggest individual Western investor in post-communist Russia, until Putin\u2019s goons targeted his company.\nBrowder claims that after Putin jailed and expropriated the wealth of the previously richest Russian (Mikhail Khodorkovsky), the other, alarmed, oligarchs were given an offer they couldn\u2019t refuse: \u2018The deal was, you give me 50 per cent of your wealth and I\u2019ll let you keep the other 50 per cent. If you don\u2019t, he\u2019ll take 100 per cent of your wealth and throw you in jail.\u2019\nDuring his baiting of Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky in the Oval Office, Trump said: 'Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phoney witch-hunt where they used him \u2013 and Russia, Russia, Russia'\nOne reason the Kremlin poisoner repeatedly commissioned the elimination of Alexei Navalny (he got him in the end) was that the former Russian opposition leader had concentrated on exposing Putin\u2019s colossal wealth, notably with his 2021 film Putin\u2019s Palace: The Story Of The World\u2019s Biggest Bribe.\nIncidentally, the man conventionally measured as the richest in the world, Elon Musk, defers to President Putin in this matter. In a 2022 interview, Musk said: \u2018I do think that Putin is significantly richer than me.\u2019\nThe most revealing account of Trump\u2019s own admiration for Putin\u2019s extreme wealth extraction (at the expense, obviously, of millions of Russian \u2018losers\u2019), came from the US President\u2019s former personal attorney, Michael Cohen.\nAdmittedly, Cohen was convicted of violating campaign laws on Trump\u2019s behalf (buying the silence of a porn star called Stormy Daniels), but his account is still compelling. Cohen wrote that Trump identified Putin as \u2018the richest man in the world by a multiple\u2019.\nFurther: that above all, what Trump admired was how Putin had the ability \u2018to take over an entire nation and run it like it was his personal company \u2013 like the Trump Organisation, in fact\u2019.\nHis former boss\u2019s conception \u2013 of treating the United States of America as if it were a branch of the Trump Organisation \u2013 was made laughably manifest at the weekend, when Trump, speaking from the Oval Office, told the media: \u2018Our country, from an economic standpoint, from a financial standpoint, from a trade standpoint, has been absolutely ripped off by almost every country in the world.\u2019\nExcept the US President began the tirade with the words \u2018Our company\u2026\u2019 \u2013 and had to correct himself, having remembered that America is actually a country, rather than a subsidiary of the Trump Organisation.\nThe thing about US companies is that the person at the top gets financial rewards vastly greater than applies to their equivalents in other nations.\nSo no surprise, then, that (according to the US magazine Wired) those businessmen who would like to have a solo dinner with the President at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida are now being given the opportunity \u2013 for a personal fee of up to $5million.\nAnd no surprise that Donald Trump\u2019s initial \u2018deal\u2019 to take a 50 per cent stake in Ukraine\u2019s rare earth minerals was drafted not by government lawyers in Washington but by those working for private law firms in New York, home of the Trump Organisation.\nTrump is looking beyond his Presidency (not surprisingly, as the US Constitution prevents him running again when his second term ends in 2028). And he has for decades sought to establish his company in Russia \u2013 even to the bizarre extent, in 2007, of marketing Trump Super Premium Vodka in Moscow.\nA year later, his son Donald Jr said that: \u2018Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.\u2019\nAnd in 2015 \u2013 a year after Putin seized Crimea from Ukraine \u2013 Trump boasted of his attempts to launch businesses in Russia, saying that he had contacts with \u2018the top-level people, both oligarchs and generals, and top of the government people \u2026 I will tell you that I met the top people and the relationship was extraordinary\u2019.\nPresident Trump\u2019s relationship with the very top person in Russia is, indeed, extraordinary.\nAnd it is abysmally obvious that the Commander in Chief of the US Army and Navy \u2013 as the President is \u2013 hopes to monetise, for his own colossal gain, his special relationship with Vladimir Putin."

      "text": "Australian military expert reveals what Russia will do next after its bloody invasion of Ukraine - and says Putin DOES want to take over the country despite his claims he 'has no plans to occupy'\n- Malcolm Davies has explained the likely outcome of Russia's invasion of Ukraine\n- President Vladimir Putin said he only seeks to demilitarise Ukraine, not occupy it\n- But Dr Davies said he does not believe Putin's assertation based on use of force\n- The military strategist said Russia will advance and seize Ukrainian-held areas\n- He said only a rump in the west will be left to Ukraine, which lead to insurgency\nAn Australian military strategist has revealed what he believes will happen next after Russia's invasion of Ukraine - and says Vladimir Putin is hellbent on taking over the country.\nRussian troops launched a broad assault on Ukraine from three sides, an attack that began with explosions before dawn on Thursday in the capital Kiev and other cities.\nUkraine's leadership said at least 40 people had been killed so far in what it called a 'full-scale war' targeting the country from the east, north and south.\nUkrainians started fleeing some cities, and the Russian military claimed to have incapacitated all of Ukraine\u2019s air defences and air bases within hours.\nMalcolm Davies, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, disputed Putin's claims that he has 'no plans to occupy' the Ukraine.\nDr Davies said Russia will first seize regions in the nation's east.\nThen, he expects, it will claim cities along the southern border until troops have encircled areas in the north-west.\n'What we are seeing is the initial air and missile bombardment, lots of footage of cruise missiles hitting targets all over Ukraine, large artillery barrages coming off the Russia-held areas in the east, in the Donbass, in Luhansk, and Donetsk,' he told CNN.\nAustralian military strategist Malcolm Davies (pictured) has explained Russia's likely course of attack as it invades Ukraine\n'I think the next step would be Russian forces in that area would expand their offensive into Ukrainian-held territory, that's where you're likely to see intense fighting,.'\nDr Davies said Russia would soon head for Kiev, the country's capital, and would likely use naval force at southern port city, Odessa.\n'At the same time you're going to see Russian forces in Belarus advance south towards Kiev. I think that is a key area of access of advance that we need to focus on,' he said.\n'The third area is the south around Mariupol and potentially an amphibious operation against Odessa.'\nGiven the extent of force demonstrated within the past 24 hours, Dr Davies said he does not buy Putin's claims that he only wants to de-militarise Ukraine and not occupy it.\n'If he doesn't occupy the country and he withdraws, the Ukrainians will take back Russia's lost gains,' Dr Davies said.\nAn explosion lights up the night sky over Kiev in the early hours of Thursday, as Russia launched an all-out attack on Ukraine from north, south and east with bombs, cruise missiles and rockets raining from the skies\nA huge explosion is seen at Vinnytsia military base, in central Ukraine, as the country comes under all-out attack by Russia\nThe attack has come to Ukraine on all fronts, with bombs and missiles striking targets across the country, ground forces rolling in from Belarus, Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk, and paratroopers dropping on Kharkiv\n'I think certainly he does intend to use overwhelming brute force to physically destroy the Ukrainian military through massive artillery, rocket barrages, and air power assaults and so forth.'\nDr Davies said wars are only won when parties successfully hold and seize ground, which makes it unlikely Russia would invade only to retreat to separatist-region Donbass, in the south-east.\n'[Putin's] going for broke. He is really committing mass amounts of military force with the goal to dismember Ukraine and remove the democratically elected government and to put in place a regime that is loyal to Russia,' he said.\n'I think he will occupy key parts of Ukraine, including potentially going into Kiev. I have no doubt he will try to alter territorial borders through brute force as well.'\nDr Davies said Putin would see an opportunity to build a land bridge along the south coast from Mariupol in the east all the way through to Odessa in the nation's west.\nThe strategist said the access route would allow Russian forces advancing in Ukraine's east to meet up with their troops based in Transnistria, Moldova, which would seal off Ukraine's entire southern line.\nFootage shared on social media from Odessa appeared to show an amphibious assault\nHe said that would leave a rump Western Ukraine, around Lviv, where Ukranian forces would fight a war of insurgency of the army of occupation.\nIn the meantime, Dr Davies said smaller-military power Ukraine would fight as best as possible with its available resources before switching to insurgency and resistance once it is largely conquered.\n'They [Ukraine] lack the overwhelming fire power of the Russian military today, they lack the air, missile, and electronic power and all of those capabilities,' he said.\n'They will fight as best they can and will cause the Russians to pay a price then they will switch to insurgency -from the cities through the countryside - and try to reign the cost of any Russian occupation of Ukraine.'\nMissiles and bombs rained from the sky, tanks rolled across the border, troops parachuted down on eastern regions and explosions were seen across the country after Vladimir Putin gave the order to attack on Thursday.\n'Hundreds' of Ukrainian troops were killed in early clashes, and official said, as the fight came to them on all fronts at a moment's notice. Official figures put the death toll at 40, with 'dozens' wounded. Cruise missiles, guided bombs and GRAD rockets took out targets from east to west - aimed at airfields, military bases, ammo dumps, and command posts including in the capital.\nDr Davies said Russia would likely take control over Ukraine's entire southern line, cornering the north western region\nThis graphic shows the current position of Russian troops around Ukraine as armed forces invaded the country on Thursday\nSix Russian jets were shot out of the sky over the eastern Donbass region with 50 Russian troops killed, Ukraine claimed, before Moscow boasted of taking full control of the skies. Ukrainian border guards said they had come under attack by heavy artillery, tanks and troops from Russia and Belarus as Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko threw his forces into the fight - though he denied taking part.\nLuhansk, Sumy and Chernihiv in the east of Ukraine all came under attack, while tanks battled on the outskirts of Kharkiv after paratroopers dropped in. Blasts were also reported in the west - in Zhytomyr and Lviv, close to the border with Poland.\nExtraordinary video footage showed what appeared to be a Kalibur cruise missile slamming into Ivano-Frankivsk airport. An apartment block in Kharkiv was also struck, causing civilian casualties including a young boy. Video also appeared to confirm cruise missiles had been launched by Russian troops stationed in Moldova.\nMeanwhile pro-Russian rebel forces pushed out from the occupied Donbass region, capturing two villages and claiming to have shot two Ukrainian jets out of the skies. The port cities of Mariupol and Odessa, where Ukraine's main naval bases are located, were also attacked. Russian tankers appeared to have blockaded the Kerch Strait, leading from the Back Sea to the Sea of Azov, cutting off Mariupol.\nVolodymyr Zelensky, in an address to the nation on Thursday morning, said the history of Ukraine has now changed forever and that Russia has 'embarked on a path of evil'. But he defiantly vowed to fight back, saying the military has already inflicted 'serious losses' in the early hours.\nHe called on Ukrainian citizens willing to defend their homeland to step forward, saying guns will be issued to everyone who wants one. He also asked for civilians to give blood to help wounded troops. And he asked world leaders to impose the 'harshest sanctions possible' on Putin.\nVladimir Putin is pictured in the early hours of Thursday morning declaring war on Ukraine, in what he termed a 'special military operation'\nIt came after the Russian strongman gave an extraordinary address to the Russian nation - broadcast in the early hours during a UN meeting aimed at avoiding war - in which he declared a 'special military operation' to 'de-militarise' and 'de-Nazify' Ukraine in what amounted to a outright declaration of war. The video appeared to have been pre-recorded, around the same time as Putin's Monday address recognising Donbass as independent.\nPutin also issued a chilling warning to any country thinking of coming to Ukraine's aid, vowing 'consequences greater than any you have faced in history'. 'I hope I have been heard,' he said.\nThe mood on the ground in Ukraine was mixed. Some showed incredible resolve - heading to work via train and road even as the bombs dropped. Elderly women in the city of Kharkiv, under heavy attack, gathered in the street to pray. But for others, the sight of Russian attack was too much. Highways out of Kiev clogged with cars as people fled, while refugees began crossing the borders into Poland and Slovakia.\nThe invasion - a naked attempt to redraw the map of Europe by force - marks the most concerted attempt to up-end world order since the end of the Cold War, and risks sparking the bloodiest conflict in Europe since the end of the Second World War.\nUnderlining the gravity of the moment, Ukrainian Interior Ministry advisor Anton Herashchenko said: 'Starting today, the world has a new geopolitical reality. Either Ukraine and the world will stop the new Hitler now, or there will be a Third World War.'\nTanks can be seen, to the right of the image, rolling past a border post between Ukraine and Belarus in the early hours of Thursday\nWestern leaders lined up to condemn Russia's actions in the early hours, with security councils convened the world over to mount a response. Heavy sanctions are expected to follow, along with more shipments of military equipment to Ukraine - provided they can find a route in.\nBut NATO and the US have made it clear that no troops will be sent, leaving Ukraine's military - far the inferior of Russia - to hold off the assault alone. Few expect it to emerge victorious from what is almost certain to be a prolonged, bloody, and vicious war.\nNATO efforts are instead expected to focus on stopping the war from spilling over into neighbouring countries. Poland, a member of the alliance, shares an extensive land border with Ukraine. The Baltic states - Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, also NATO members - will now fear a Russian assault.\nMoldova, where some Russian ground troops are already based, is also at risk of falling to Putin. From there, he could strike out at Romania - another former Soviet state.\nUnconfirmed reports said that Russian forces had destroyed or rendered unusable the Ukrainian navy, and struck Boryspil Airport in Kiev. Access to the Black Sea and Azov Sea was cut off.\nPresident Joe Biden will address the nation at noon on Thursday, and on Wednesday night he condemned Russia's 'unprovoked and unjustified attack.' He was speaking to Ukraine's president.\nUkraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, posted a video message early on Thursday and urged Ukrainians to stay at home, and remain calm, telling them to have faith in their country\nBiden said in a statement: 'President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering.\n'Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way. The world will hold Russia accountable.'\nBiden said he will be monitoring the situation from Washington, DC, and will continue to get regular updates from his national security team.\nPutin justified it all in a televised address, asserting that the attack was needed to protect civilians in eastern Ukraine - a false claim the U.S. had predicted he would make as a pretext for an invasion.\nHe accused the U.S. and its allies of ignoring Russia's demands to prevent Ukraine from joining NATO and for security guarantees. He also claimed that Russia does not intend to occupy Ukraine but will move to 'demilitarize' it and bring those who committed crimes to justice.\nPresident Joe Biden, pictured on Wednesday, condemned Putin's invasion of Ukraine\nExplosions are seen in the early hours of Thursday in Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine\nBiden in a written statement condemned the 'unprovoked and unjustified attack,' and he promised that the U.S. and its allies would 'hold Russia accountable.' The president said he planned to speak to Americans on Thursday after a meeting of the Group of Seven leaders. More sanctions against Russia were expected to be announced Thursday.\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba described the assault as a 'full-scale invasion' and said Ukraine will 'defend itself and will win. The world can and must stop Putin. The time to act is now.'\nIn the capital, Kiev Mayor Vitaly Klitschko advised residents to stay home unless they are involved in critical work and urged them to prepare go-bags with necessities and documents if they need to evacuate. An Associated Press photographer in Mariupol reported hearing explosions and seeing dozens of people with suitcases heading for their cars to leave the city.\n'We are facing a war and horror. What could be worse?' 64-year-old Liudmila Gireyeva said in Kiev. She planned to head to the western city of Lviv and then to try to move to Poland to join her daughter. Putin 'will be damned by history, and Ukrainians are damning him.'\nThe Russian claims about knocking out Ukrainian air defenses and Ukrainian claims to have shot down several Russian aircraft could not immediately be verified. The Ukrainian air defense system and air force date back to the Soviet era and are dwarfed by Russia's massive air power and its inventory of precision weapons.\nThe Russian Defense Ministry said it was not targeting cities, but using precision weapons and claimed that 'there is no threat to civilian population.'\nMost watched News videos\n- Drunk passenger escorted off plane after hitting people with his belt\n- Family beats woman for complaining about their misbehaving child\n- Incredible moment dolphin joins family for morning swim in Dorset\n- New Oct 7 footage shows kidnapped Israeli led through Gaza by Hamas\n- Furious motorists complain over 13-inch high 'killer kerb'\n- Bodycam released of Sha'carri Richardson being arrested at airport\n- 'Frankenstein' rabbit seen with growths sprouting from its head\n- Man charged with felony for throwing a sandwich at police officer\n- Horned Frankenstein animals appear as rare virus spreads\n- Hunter Biden says Jeffrey Epstein introduced 'Melania to Trump'\n- Shocking moment wobbling plane's wing hits runway during landing\n- What is turning cute rabbits into horned creatures with black tentacles?"

      "text": "Is Vladimir Putin plotting to rule forever after two decades in power? Russia's longest serving leader since Stalin decides how to stay in charge even after term as president ends in 2024\n- Putin's current term will end in 2024 but it is likely he will stay at the helm\n- He has dodged the question about what he intends to do at the end of his term\n- He has hinted at constitutional changes and could rule as the prime minister\nAs Russian President Vladimir Putin marks two decades in power, he boasts about his achievements but remains coy about his political future - a reticence that fuels wild speculation about his intentions.\nPutin points to the revival of Russia's global clout, industrial modernisation, booming agricultural exports and a resurgent military as key results of his tenure that began on December 31, 1999.\nOn that day, Russia's first President Boris Yeltsin abruptly stepped down and named the former KGB officer his successor, paving the way for his election three months later.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is marking two decades in power but remains coy about his political future\nCritics accuse Putin of rolling back post-Soviet freedoms to establish tight control over the political scene, marginalise the opposition and stifle critical media.\nThey hold him responsible for tensions with the West after Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea, which bolstered his approval ratings but triggered U.S. and European sanctions.\n'Putin stopped the normal development of Russia as a normal market economy and a normal political democracy' and turned the country into a 'global spoiler,' said Andrei Kolesnikov, a researcher with the Carnegie Moscow Center.\nKremlin watchers are trying to predict what will happen after Putin's current six-year term ends in 2024. They agree on one thing: Putin, Russia's longest-serving leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, will likely stay at the helm.\nA fitness fan, the 67-year old Putin appears in good shape to stay on. He regularly practices judo, skis and plays ice hockey in a demonstration of his vigour.\nPutin points to the revival of Russia's global clout as a result of his tenure that began on December 31, 1999\nHe remains widely popular, although the propaganda effect of Crimea's annexation has worn off amid stagnant living standards, a rise in the retirement age and other domestic challenges.\nPutin can easily use the rubber-stamp parliament to scrap term limits, but most observers expect him to take a less straightforward approach. A law faculty graduate, the Russian leader prefers more delicate methods that have a democratic veneer.\nEarlier this month, Putin hinted at possible constitutional amendments to re-distribute powers among the president, the Cabinet and parliament.\nHe didn't specify what changes could be made, but the announcement may signal his intention to trim presidential powers and continue ruling the country as prime minister.\nOn that day, Russia's first President Boris Yeltsin (pictured) abruptly stepped down and named the former KGB officer his successor\nThere are other opportunities. Kazakhstan's longtime leader Nursultan Nazarbayev offered an example this year when he abruptly resigned and had his protege elected president in a snap vote. The 79-year-old Nazarbayev retained his grip on power by securing a prominent position as head of the nation's security council.\nThere is another, more dramatic option. Many in neighbouring Belarus fear that the Kremlin could push for a full merger of the two ex-Soviet allies to allow Putin to become the head of a new unified state.\nWhen asked recently if he was considering it, Putin dodged the question.\nEach of those potential options carries major risks.\nPutin moved into the prime minister's seat from 2008-2012 after eight years as president to observe a constitutional limit of two consecutive terms, allowing Dmitry Medvedev to take the top seat.\nPutin continued calling the shots under Medvedev, who obediently stepped down after one term. Putin benefited from his placeholder's move to extend the presidential term to six years, but still wasn't quite happy with the 'tandem rule.'\nA fitness fan, the 67-year old Putin appears in good shape to stay on. He regularly practices judo, skis and plays ice hockey in a demonstration of his vigour\nPutin was particularly critical of Medvedev's decision to let the United Nations give the go-ahead to a 2011 Western air campaign in Libya that helped oust longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi and plunged the country into chaos.\nAnd at home, the announcement of Putin's return to the presidency sparked massive protests in Moscow in 2011-2012 and caused a rift among elites. Putin's aides suspected some of Medvedev's lieutenants of prodding their boss to stay for a second term and encouraging the protests.\nPutin's statement this month about a possible change to the constitution to limit the president to just two terms altogether was widely interpreted as a signal that he was contemplating creating a new governing position for himself while trimming the authority of his successor.\nIf Putin chooses to become prime minister with new broad powers, it may raise other threats.\nBy empowering a parliamentary majority to name the prime minister, Putin would become more vulnerable because he will depend on the ruling party's performance. While Putin's approval ratings have remained high, the popularity of the main Kremlin-directed party, the United Russia, has plummeted and the president has kept it at a distance.\nCritics hold Putin responsible for tensions with the West after Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea\nA merger with Belarus to create a new leadership position has even greater risks. The prospect may excite some Russians who dream about revival of imperial glory, but it is certain to trigger strong resistance in Belarus and further antagonise the West.\nBelarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in office for more than a quarter-century, has vowed to uphold Belarus' post-Soviet independence. While the Kremlin has pressured him by raising energy prices and cutting subsidies, Lukashenko has remained adamant and even warned recently that Russia's attempt to take over his country could trigger a war with NATO.\n'The interest of Lukashenko is to be the dictator of his own nation state, not the person who will be dependent on the will of Putin,' Kolesnikov said.\nWhatever path Putin chooses, he's widely expected to keep his intentions secret until the last moment.\nPutin's statement this month about a change to the constitution was widely interpreted as a signal that he was contemplating creating a new governing position for himself\n'This uncertainty has its advantages - you can play groups of interests against each other, you can hold them in this situation of uncertainty,' said Moscow-based political analyst Yekaterina Shulman. 'But it can\u00b4t go on for too long because it provokes infighting within the elites.'\nShe noted that the Kremlin may call the parliamentary elections that are currently set for 2021 at an earlier date before approval ratings plummet.\n'It\u00b4s important to have a loyal majority in the parliament,' Shulman said. 'How to achieve this is a tricky question.'\nShulman argued that the Kazakhstan-style scenario appears the most likely. She said staying at the helm but sharing authority with his successor would allow Putin to temper an inevitable succession battle among his lieutenants.\n'The difficulty in the successor model is that the whole amount of power vested in the current president is untransferable indeed to any other person,' Shulman said. 'But if this power is redistributed, at least part of it, then it\u00b4s easier for the decision-makers to agree on the figure of the potential successor.'\nMost watched News videos\n- Drunk passenger escorted off plane after hitting people with his belt\n- Family beats woman for complaining about their misbehaving child\n- Incredible moment dolphin joins family for morning swim in Dorset\n- New Oct 7 footage shows kidnapped Israeli led through Gaza by Hamas\n- Furious motorists complain over 13-inch high 'killer kerb'\n- Bodycam released of Sha'carri Richardson being arrested at airport\n- 'Frankenstein' rabbit seen with growths sprouting from its head\n- Man charged with felony for throwing a sandwich at police officer\n- Horned Frankenstein animals appear as rare virus spreads\n- Hunter Biden says Jeffrey Epstein introduced 'Melania to Trump'\n- Shocking moment wobbling plane's wing hits runway during landing\n- What is turning cute rabbits into horned creatures with black tentacles?"

Clearly they can't sustain this war for years and their morale is so low that they cannot even keep up the supplies and logistics, so I wouldn't say that is a given whatsoever.\n'We're certainly not willing to give up any territory or talk about our territorial integrity.'\nEarlier, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Mr Putin's forces were abducting Ukrainian politicians, activists and journalists as Russia failed to meet its military objectives.\nShe condemned the 'abhorrent tactic' following work by Ukrainian human rights group ZMINA, which claimed to have identified dozens of individuals who had been abducted, with thousands more deported to Russia.\nMs Truss said Mr Putin was resorting to 'desperate measures'.\n'Putin continues to use abhorrent tactics against the Ukrainian people, including abducting innocent civilians,' she said.\n'He is not achieving his objectives and is resorting to desperate measures. Putin must fail in Ukraine.'\nMs Truss, in a statement to the House of Commons, later told MPs: 'We know that Putin is not serious about talks, he is still wantonly bombing innocent citizens across Ukraine and that is why we need to do more to ensure that he loses and we force him to think again.\n'We must not just stop Putin in Ukraine but we must also look to the long term. We need to ensure that any future talks don't end up selling Ukraine out or repeating the mistakes of the past.'\nIn their call on Monday, No 10 said Mr Zelensky provided Mr Johnson with an update on negotiations, adding that 'the two leaders agreed to co-ordinate closely in the days ahead'.\nThe Ukrainian president has signalled he is prepared to offer a series of concessions to Russia to end the fighting.\nUkraine could declare neutrality and offer guarantees about its non-nuclear status as part of a peace deal, Mr Zelensky suggested, but he stressed the desire to ensure the country's 'territorial integrity'.\nUkrainian government say they will be seeking compensation of \u00a3431.5BILLION (and counting) from Russia for damage it has done to the country during the devastating invasion\nThe Ukrainian government has estimated the total cost of damage of the Russian invasion now stands at over \u00a3430billion and declared it will seek reparations in the aftermath of the war.\nUkraine's deputy prime minister Yuliya Sviridenko declared today that an estimated $564.9billion (\u00a3431.5billion) worth of damage had been inflicted since Russian troops rolled across the border on February 24.\nIn a stunning Facebook post, Sviridenko, who is also Ukraine's minister of economic development and trade, said the damage to her nation's infrastructure alone totalled $119bn (almost \u00a391bn), even before the financial impact of the war on Ukraine's economy, trade and foreign investment had been calculated.\nShe went on to declare 'the numbers are growing every day' and that 'Ukraine will seek reparations from the aggressor despite all the obstacles'.\nHer promise to collect reparations comes after President Volodymyr Zelensky and the governor of Ukraine's national bank said their country 'should be rebuilt with Russian money' earlier this month.\nUkraine's deputy prime minister Yuliya Sviridenko declared today that an estimated $564.9billion (\u00a3431.5billion) worth of damage had been inflicted since Russian troops rolled across the border on February 24\nIn a stunning Facebook post, Sviridenko, who is also Ukraine's minister of economic development and trade, said the damage to her nation's infrastructure alone totalled $119bn (almost \u00a391bn) - damage in Mariupol pictured\nSviridenko said 'the numbers are growing every day' and that 'Ukraine will seek reparations from the aggressor despite all the obstacles' (damage in Mariupol pictured)\nThe Deputy Prime Minister's promise to collect reparations comes after President Volodymyr Zelensky (pictured) and the governor of Ukraine's national bank said their country 'should be rebuilt with Russian money' earlier this month\n'$564.9 billion. This is the sum of the losses that Ukraine has suffered since the Russian invasion,' Sviridenko announced today via her official Facebook page.\n'There are at least two methods for calculating the losses. The first is from direct destruction; the second is the calculation of losses from the overall impact of hostilities, including the deteriorating economic situation in our country, rising unemployment, blocking trade, declining consumer demand and more.\nThe finance minister went on to reel off a list of eye-watering sums she said were the estimated financial losses inflicted on Ukraine by Russia's invasion, before adding: 'It is worth noting that every day the numbers change and, unfortunately, they are growing.\n'That is why Ukraine, despite all obstacles, will seek compensation from the aggressor. Both by court decisions and by transferring to our state frozen assets of Russia.\n'Evil will inevitably be punished and Russia will feel the full weight of its own criminal actions on the territory of Ukraine,' Sviridenko promised.\nMany Ukrainian cities have suffered indiscriminate Russian bombing campaigns, but the southern port city of Mariupol has been utterly devastated by constant Russian missile attacks and airstrikes for almost a month.\nOn March 3, President Zelensky vowed that Ukraine will be rebuilt with Russian money, but the scale of the damage dealt to Mariupol and other cities since then is difficult to comprehend.\nMariupol's mayor Vadym Boichenko said this morning that the situation is so dire that the port city must be completely evacuated.\nBoichenko said 160,000 civilians trapped in the city are encircled by Russian forces, with ever-dwindling supplies of food, water and medicine, while hundreds of citizens have already perished.\nUkraine's Ministry of Foreign Affairs meanwhile said Russian troops are 'turning the city into dust', describing the situation in Mariupol as 'catastrophic' with people fighting to survive.\nLocal resident Valentina Demura, 70, stands next to the building where her apartment, destroyed during Ukraine-Russia conflict, is located in the besieged southern port city of Mariupol on Sunday\nKyrylo Shevchenko, the governor of Ukraine's national bank, said that Russia's foreign exchange reserves frozen by sanctions should be used to help Ukraine rebuild after the war\nThe governor of Ukraine's national bank, Kyrylo Shevchenko, also shares Zelensky and Sviridenko's sentiment that Russia should be made to pay reparations to Ukraine in the aftermath of the conflict.\nIn an interview earlier this month with the BBC, Shevchenko said some of the money for rebuilding could be supplied through multinational grants and foreign investment, but insisted that Russia should be forced to pay for the bulk of it.\nRussia is though to have hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of funds stashed overseas which have been subject to US and EU economic sanctions as punishment for its invasion of Ukraine.\nSchevchenko suggested these frozen funds could be funnelled towards the effort to rebuild Ukraine after the war.\n'The need for money will be huge,' he told the BBC. 'It could be fulfilled through loans and grants from multinational organisations and direct help from other countries.\n'However a large share of financing is needed to be obtained as a reparation from the aggressor, including funds that are currently frozen in our allied countries.'\nMost watched News videos\n- Drunk passenger escorted off plane after hitting people with his belt\n- Family beats woman for complaining about their misbehaving child\n- Incredible moment dolphin joins family for morning swim in Dorset\n- New Oct 7 footage shows kidnapped Israeli led through Gaza by Hamas\n- Furious motorists complain over 13-inch high 'killer kerb'\n- Bodycam released of Sha'carri Richardson being arrested at airport\n- 'Frankenstein' rabbit seen with growths sprouting from its head\n- Man charged with felony for throwing a sandwich at police officer\n- Horned Frankenstein animals appear as rare virus spreads\n- Hunter Biden says Jeffrey Epstein introduced 'Melania to Trump'\n- Shocking moment wobbling plane's wing hits runway during landing\n- What is turning cute rabbits into horned creatures with black tentacles?"

      "text": "Trump demands unconditional 30-day ceasefire between Russia-Ukraine\nDonald Trump has called for a 30-day 'unconditional' ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia. In an intervention that piles pressure on the two sides, the US President warned his country and its partners will impose further sanctions if the month-long truce 'is not respected'.\nIt comes just days after the Trump administration said it will step aside in peace negotiations in a bid to ensure Ukraine and Russia engage in direct talks. But the US President's latest remarks indicate America was willing to continue its role as a mediator. 'Talks with Russia/Ukraine continue. The U.S. calls for, ideally, a 30-day unconditional ceasefire,' Trump said on his Truth Social network shortly after speaking to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. 'If the ceasefire is not respected, the U.S. and its partners will impose further sanctions.'\nTrump said that 'both countries will be held accountable for respecting the sanctity of these direct negotiations' to halt the conflict that started when Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The US president said he wanted any ceasefire to then build to a 'lasting peace.' 'It can all be done very quickly, and I will be available on a moment's notice if my services are needed.' Trump opened talks with Russia's Vladimir Putin in February in a bid to end the war that he had previously pledged to end within 24 hours of starting his second term.\nBut he has shown growing impatience, first with Zelensky and more recently with Putin as the fighting has continued. Trump and other top US officials have stepped up warnings in recent weeks that Washington is prepared to walk away from its role as a broker if there is no progress soon. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he spoke with Trump today, adding that their telephone call went 'very well'.\nHe said his country was ready for talks on the war with Russia 'starting this minute' and 'in any format' but insisted that there first had to be a full ceasefire. The conversation lasted about 20 minutes and focused on 'diplomacy and the ceasefire' that the United States and Ukraine are trying to establish with Russia, a senior Ukrainian official. The official added that the two leaders also discussed a minerals deal ratified by the Ukrainian parliament.\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter), Zelensky wrote: 'Ukraine is ready for a full ceasefire starting right now, from this very moment \u2014 a 30-day silence. 'But it must be real. No missile or drone strikes, no hundreds of assaults on the front. The Russians must respond appropriately \u2013 by supporting the ceasefire. 'They must prove their willingness to end the war. This isn't the first time, we are offering this once again. 'Thirty days that could become the beginning of years of peace. A ceasefire, lasting and reliable, will be a real indicator of movement toward peace. 'America can help with this. The world needs America now just as it did eighty years ago.'\nRussian President Vladimir Putin for his part ordered a three-day ceasefire for Thursday's 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, for which Moscow threw a vast military parade attended by Chinese President Xi Jinping. Ukraine dismissed the ceasefire as theatrics and said that Russia had broken its own order after just a few hours.\nEarlier this week US Vice President JD Vance said Moscow was asking for too much from Ukraine. The US and Ukraine signed a minerals deal last week - just two months after the extraordinary Oval Office row between the countries' leaders. The agreement is based on access to Ukraine's natural resources, including aluminium, graphite, oil and natural gas, in exchange for ongoing military support.\nDays before the deal was signed, the White House said it will step back from mediating peace talks between Ukraine and Russia after a ceasefire deal was spurned by Vladimir Putin. Tammy Bruce, a spokesman for the State Department, said the US would no longer 'fly around the world at the drop of a hat'. Instead, she added, Washington will be leaving negotiations 'between the two parties'.\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail? Hit the follow button above for more of the news you need."

'And if it's a good meeting we're going to end up getting peace very quickly.'\nAsked if he felt Putin has a 'strong hand', Mr Trump said: 'Well, he came to our country.'\nHe said he believes the dictator 'would like to see a deal' adding: 'If I weren't president, in my opinion, he would much rather take over all of Ukraine but I am president and he's not going to mess around with me.'\nFor the first time, he suggested European leaders may also be present at any second meeting with Mr Zelensky.\nDonald Trump tonight insisted Vladimir Putin 'is not going to mess around with me' on the eve of their crunch summit\nThe eyes of the world will be on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska, where the two men are due meet at 8.30pm UK time on Friday.

This meeting sets up a second meeting, but there is a 25 per cent chance that this meeting will not be a successful meeting.'\nMaking clear that it will be down to Ukraine to decide its own fate, Mr Trump added: 'I'm not going to negotiate their deal. I'm going to let them negotiate their deal.'\nMr Trump has insisted on Mr Zelensky not being present at Friday's summit, fearing that he would be a distraction.

I think he's going to, and we're going to find out.'\nBut Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov tampered down expectations for a breakthrough, saying it would be a 'big mistake' to predict the results of the negotiations.\nMore details emerged of the summit on Thursday.\nThe two leaders will meet at 11.30am local time and have a one-on-one with only their respective translators present.\nAfter that delegations from each country will join for a 'working breakfast' before a press conference.\nThursday night flight radar showed the first of the Russian government planes landing at Anchorage International Airport in Alaska.\nAmerica had to temporarily lift certain sanctions on Russian transactions to allow them to visit the city which is the closest point from America to Russia, lying just 3 miles (4.8km) away.\nMr Trump has been leant on heavily by Europe to push for an immediate ceasefire at the start of negotiations, before territorial disputes.\nPutin will push to delay any end to hostilities as long as possible given his forces are gaining territory by the day.\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said there 'will have to be some conversation about security guarantees' in order to achieve peace.\nBut he added: 'I think the president's hope is to achieve some stoppage of fighting so that those conversations can happen.'\nWhile in recent days Mr Trump has been tempered by Western leaders, it remains to be seen the effect the former KGB man will have once he gets the US President on his own.\nOn Thursday Putin continued his charm offensive, praising the Trump administration for making 'quite energetic and sincere efforts to stop the hostilities'.\nThe two leaders will meet at 11.30am local time and have a one-on-one with only their respective translators present. Pictured: Vladimir Putin\nThe US President also vowed that there will be no peace deal without Volodymyr Zelensky present in a boost for Ukraine\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said there 'will have to be some conversation about security guarantees' in order to achieve peace\nHe also suggested that 'long-term conditions of peace between our countries, and in Europe, and in the world as a whole' could be reached under an agreement with the US on nuclear arms control.\nMr Trump's former top Russia advisor Fiona Hill warned that he is making a mistake meeting the tyrant one-on-one.\nShe told the Telegraph: 'Putin will lure you in in a moment. He likes to do the two guys chatting routine, but what he's really doing is making you complicit in all kinds of things he wants.'\nMs Hill counselled Mr Trump when he met Putin at the Helsinki Summit in 2018 and said it went so badly she contemplated faking a seizure to shut it down.\n'He was convinced that if he sat down with Putin, he'd sort things out, man to man, without the encumbrance of any pesky analysts or aides,' she said.\nThe meeting followed largely the same format as Friday, with a two-hour one-on-one followed by a press conference.\nWhen asked if he believed US intelligence agencies or Putin about Russian election interference, Mr Trump horrified his aides by responding: 'President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be.'\nMr Trump has insisted on Mr Zelensky not being present at Friday's summit, fearing that he would be a distraction, the Wall Street Journal reported.\nHe has admitted that the US must provide Ukraine with security guarantees as part of a peace settlement, but said this cannot involve NATO.\nOn Thursday, Mr Zelensky was seen embracing Sir Keir Starmer before they shared a cup of tea on a visit to Downing Street ahead of the crunch talks.\nThe Ukrainian said it was a 'good, productive meeting' where they 'discussed in considerable detail the security guarantees that can make peace truly durable if the United States succeeds in pressing Russia to stop the killings and engage in genuine, substantive diplomacy.'\nSir Keir said afterwards that the two leaders 'agreed there had been a powerful sense of unity and a strong resolve to achieve a just and lasting peace in Ukraine'."

  "argos_summary": "Vladimir Putin's upcoming visit to the U.S. marks a significant moment in U.S.-Russia relations, as he seeks to leverage his strongman image to gain favor with President Trump, who admires him. The meeting is expected to focus on aggressive demands from Putin regarding Ukraine, including territorial concessions and military limitations, while Trump aims to project himself as a capable deal-maker. Observers express concern that the talks may ultimately benefit Putin, especially if they fail to yield a compromise, potentially enhancing his domestic and international standing.",
