  "description": "$152 billion in annual catastrophe losses shows climate change is redrawing insurability\u2019s limits, threatening market stability and reshaping business strategy.",
  "content": "The global insurance industry has crossed a line that should give every boardroom pause. According to Verisk\u2019s just released 2025 Global Modeled Catastrophe Losses Report, insured losses from natural disasters have surged to an average annual baseline of $152 billion dollars, a 25% jump in just one year. Once dominated by rare megacatastrophes, the balance of risk is shifting to frequency perils such as severe thunderstorms, floods, and wildfires, which now account for nearly two-thirds of losses.\n\nThe shift is already visible in the data, explained Giovanni Garcia, senior vice president at Verisk\u2019s Extreme Events Solutions unit in an interview. \u201cThe $152 billion number, nearly two thirds of that is now made up of frequency perils. And what we\u2019ve also seen over the last five years is that the number of severe thunderstorms that cause a billion-dollar loss has increased by 59%.\" That pattern reflects a structural rise in baseline losses, not a statistical anomaly.\n\nThe New Normal Of Catastrophe Costs\n\nVerisk\u2019s analysis shows why the curve keeps bending upward. Four forces drive the increase: rapid urban expansion into hazard-prone areas, inflation pushing up asset values, continued migration into vulnerable coastal and metropolitan zones, and the growing climate signal itself. Together these dynamics are compounding risk faster than insurers can reprice it.\n\nIn the last five years, insured catastrophe losses averaged $132 billion annually, a figure itself from the $104 billion in the prior period. Verisk warns the industry should prepare for worse: there is a 90% chance that losses in at least one year this decade will exceed $250 billion dollars.\n\nThis year also marks the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, still one of the most consequential disasters in modern financial history. Katrina caused total economic losses of around $160 billion in 2005 terms, with insured losses reaching $105.5 billion. Adjusted for today\u2019s dollars, the bill would be roughly double, placing the storm in insured losses alone. That comparison underscores why Verisk\u2019s $250 billion warning is not hypothetical. A Katrina-scale event today would push insurers, reinsurers, and capital markets to their limits, with consequences not only for policyholders but for credit markets, mortgage lenders, and public budgets. That recognition is beginning to shift from insurers\u2019 balance sheets into central banks\u2019 risk frameworks\n\nClimate change accounts for only about one percent of year-on-year increases in modeled losses, but that figure understates its significance. Of the $152 billion only around 1% can be attributed to climate change but, Garcia explains, \u201cIf I was going to look at how the losses emanate from human behavior, that\u2019s 7% year on year exposure growth for 1% change in the loss estimate from climate change.\u201d\n\nThis contrast highlights climate\u2019s role as a risk multiplier. It does not always appear as the largest direct driver when compared with inflation or exposure growth, but it amplifies the impact of both. Rising temperatures and more volatile weather patterns make existing vulnerabilities more dangerous and magnify the cost of human and economic choices.\n\nBuilding into floodplains or wildfire zones is always risky, but rising temperatures, shifting rainfall patterns, and more volatile weather can turn those decisions into systemic threats that overwhelm local economies. Inflation raises the value of assets at risk, and when climate change shortens the return period between extreme events, recovery periods shrink until the economics of rebuilding no longer add up. Supply chains concentrated in vulnerable coastal or riverine regions suddenly become global choke points when a climate-driven disruption strikes.\n\nThe recognition of climate as a multiplier of other risks is now reshaping financial systems. In July, the European Central Bank announced that from the second half of 2026 it will into its collateral framework. The new mechanism will reduce the value assigned to corporate bonds and other assets used as collateral if they are judged to be more exposed to transition-related climate risks.\n\nThe adjustments will be based on three elements: sector-level vulnerability as revealed by ECB stress testing, issuer-specific exposure to transition pressures, and the maturity of the instrument. By applying a haircut to the collateral value of climate-exposed debt, the ECB is explicitly embedding climate risk into the eurozone\u2019s financial plumbing. In effect, the central bank is declaring climate not just an environmental threat but a financial hazard that must be priced into core monetary operations.\n\nThe consequences for insurers are already stark. A recent Nature study modelled how climate-driven hurricane damages could cut profitability for US homeowners insurers by between 11-100% depending on volatility and risk appetite. In some scenarios the market fails to reach equilibrium entirely, leaving regions effectively uninsurable without public intervention.\n\nWithout adaptation, profitability collapses and solvency risks rise. The study points to a way forward. Insurers could help preserve viability by directing investment toward adaptation and resilience. Stronger, more robust assets reduce expected losses, which in turn lower insurance costs and improve borrowing conditions. Resilience pays twice: first in reduced disaster costs and again in cheaper capital.\n\nInsurability As The New Credit Rating\n\nHowden\u2019s recent Insurability Imperative report made the link explicit. \u201cMaintaining insurability is fast becoming as important as maintaining a credit rating,\u201d said Isabelle Cadignan, chief commercial officer for Climate Risk and Resilience at Howden. \u201cBoards need to understand that insurability is not fixed \u2013 it\u2019s dynamic, shapeable, and critical in accessing affordable capital in the climate era.\u201d\n\nFor boards, this means treating insurability as a forward-looking credit rating for climate risk. If you cannot insure it, you cannot finance it. That holds true for real estate developments in wildfire zones, industrial projects in floodplains, and global supply chains tied to storm-prone ports. Catastrophe pools, parametric products, and regulatory experiments like California\u2019s PRID wildfire model approval, which requires insurers to provide credits for households that implement risk mitigation measures, show how markets are adapting under pressure.\n\nThe scale of the protection gap adds urgency. The number of billion-dollar disasters has soared, rising from just a handful annually in the 1980s to more than two dozen in recent years in the United States alone. In 2024, global economic losses from natural disasters reached $368 billion, yet less than half of that was insured. The shortfall leaves households, companies, and governments to absorb losses directly, slowing recovery and compounding systemic risk. Emerging economies are hit hardest, with protection gaps exceeding two-thirds of total losses, creating fault lines in global capital allocation as investors retreat from markets seen as uninsurable.\n\nFor companies the message is clear: insurability is no longer an afterthought, it is a strategic indicator of competitiveness. Businesses can and should use catastrophe models themselves to establish baseline risk profiles, stress-test scenarios, quantify protection gaps, and justify resilience investments.\n\nAs Shane Latchman vice president and managing director of Veriks\u2019s Extreme Event Solutions team explained in an interview, companies too often approach climate risk from the wrong angle saying, \u201cWe often get questions due to ESG requirements, has my risk changed? But it\u2019s interesting that often is not accompanied by what\u2019s my overall base risk?\u201d He noted that catastrophe models can also quantify the benefits of resilience measures, from building flood walls to reinforcing homes with hurricane tie-downs.\n\nWhat is emerging is not just an insurance issue but a financial stability challenge. When insurers absorb sustained losses without sufficient premium growth, solvency comes under pressure. When markets tip into uninsurability, as the Nature study suggests they may, the consequences ripple outward into mortgage markets, municipal bonds, and the cost of capital for entire regions, and central banks are already responding.\n\nThe introduction of a climate factor into debt pricing is a clear signal that environmental exposures will be priced directly into collateral and lending operations. Credit rating agencies are sharpening their focus on climate vulnerability, raising questions about whether sectors or sovereigns with large protection gaps could face higher borrowing costs. For institutional investors, the issue goes beyond individual companies. Capital markets must now price in whether entire sectors and geographies will remain financeable as protection gaps widen and climate risk is embedded into collateral frameworks. This is shifting climate resilience from a corporate responsibility issue to a fundamental investment screen.\n\nInnovation will be critical in keeping capital flowing. Catastrophe pools, parametric instruments, and PRID-style regulatory frameworks are not just about spreading risk, they are about preserving investability in high-risk regions and sectors. When adaptation investments lead to lower premiums, stronger collateral value, and continued financing, they become both resilience strategies and capital-preservation strategies.\n\nThe $152 billion warning is therefore about more than rising disaster costs. It is about whether global finance can adapt quickly enough to prevent climate risk from becoming a trigger for capital flight and systemic instability. The line between what is insurable and what is not will increasingly define which assets, companies, and economies remain bankable in the years ahead.",

      "text": "Abstract\nEvidence shows that climate change (CC) is increasing the frequency and intensity of natural catastrophes. However, progress in CC mitigation technologies lags the needed trajectories, largely due to capital constraints. This study presents a novel empirical investigation into the implications of CC-induced changes in hurricane damage for the U.S. Homeowners\u2019 insurance sector. Originally tailored to the agricultural insurance market, we enhanced and adapted the model to encompass the broader domain of property insurance. The revised framework was applied to a unique dataset of insurance market activity. The research integrates end-of-century climate-informed hurricane damage forecasts with a catastrophic risk model of the insurance market. The findings reveal that escalating damages attributable to CC and socio-economic growth could diminish insurers\u2019 expected utility (value) by a range of 11% to 100%, contingent upon damage volatility and risk aversion levels. Consequently, insurers are projected to elevate premiums and curtail coverage. The empirical estimation of CC effect on the insurance industry\u2019s financial results contributes to quantifying the cost of CC, while the assignment of these costs to the insurance sector highlights its potential as a financial aggregator for CC-related expenditures. This study suggests translating the anticipated decline in insurance sector profitability into an equivalent offset in greenhouse gas emissions to underscore the insurance sector\u2019s latent role in facilitating a transition to a sustainable economy. It illustrates that the projected emissions reduction proportion surpasses the insurance industry\u2019s share in the U.S. economy.\nSimilar content being viewed by others\nIntroduction\nClimate change (CC) poses increasing financial risks across industries, with the insurance sector standing at the forefront of climate-related economic exposure. As climate-induced disasters escalate in frequency and severity, insurers face rising claims and shrinking profitability, threatening the long-term stability of the market. At the same time, the climate finance gap - the shortfall between available and required capital to fund climate mitigation efforts - remains a major barrier to achieving global climate goals. While much of the discussion on climate finance focuses on government and multilateral funding, there is growing interest in the potential for private-sector actors, including insurers, to play a greater role in financing climate mitigation.\nCC is projected to exacerbate extreme weather phenomena, including, but not limited to, coastal flooding, hurricanes, high winds, tornadoes, lightning, and severe precipitation events (Seneviratne et al. 2021). Specifically, tropical cyclone damages were the costliest of all natural-hazards\u2019 damages during the period 1980\u20132005, with over 78% (211 billion 2008 USD) in the U.S (Barthel & Neumayer 2012), and the average normalized hurricane damage during 1900\u20132017 is estimated at just under 17 billion USD per year in the continental U.S (Weinkle et al. 2018). Theory and modeling results indicate that tropical storm activity is expected to intensify under a warming climate (Knutson et al. 2020). Furthermore, case analyses for recent storms indicate a significant anthropogenic influence on their intensity (Frame et al. 2020). In their 2016 report, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office (C.B.O.) estimates annual hurricane damage at USD 28 billion (0.16% of the national G.D.P.), and expected to rise to USD 39 billion (0.22% of the G.D.P.) by 2075 due to CC and coastal development (U.S Congressional Budget Office 2016).\nThe intensifying impacts of CC present an urgent need for innovative financial strategies to mitigate the resulting economic risks. The insurance industry, pivotal in distributing and managing catastrophe risks, finds itself at the intersection of private capital markets and public policy. This dual role highlights the industry\u2019s potential to act as a financial aggregator for CC-related costs and a catalyst for climate mitigation investments. By reallocating resources from profitability declines to emission reduction efforts, insurers could transform CC challenges into opportunities for market sustainability.\nNatural disasters have a long-term effect on individuals, industries, and societies. Characterized as low probability yet high impact, they stress the importance of insurance. Insurance products serve as instruments for risk transfer, allowing policyholders to allocate portions of their risk in line with their risk tolerance. Concurrently, insurers aggregate these risks from a broad societal cross-section and employ diversification strategies to mitigate the collective risk. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a research group established by the United Nations to provide policymakers with scientific assessments on climate change, cautions that escalating CC damages will diminish insurability despite the crucial role of insurance in post-disaster recovery (Arent et al. 2014; Surminski et al. 2016), as the correlation of risks is expected to rise and undermine the insurance industry\u2019s capacity to mitigate its exposure through diversification.\nThe insurance industry leadership considers CC a strategic business factor (Golnaraghi et al., 2021) and recognizes that increasing CC risks may result in unaffordable premiums and reduced insurability due to increasing climate-related risks (CRO Forum 2018). Learning from past experience (Mills, 2005), limited insurance availability may shift the burden of natural catastrophe damages to governments (Federal Insurance Office, US Department of Treasury 2015). A prime example of private insurance replaced by a public scheme, where commercial insurance has been made unavailable due to increasing catastrophic damages, is the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program (N.F.I.P., established in 1968). Designed to address low insurance availability in hazard-prone areas by offering subsidized flood insurance and accountable for tens of billions of USD in public deficit (Federal insurance Office, US Department of Treasury 2015), the program announced in September 2021 an upcoming change to its premium rates, reducing the subsidy to citizens living in locations at risk due to CC, with the declared goal to better internalize CC costs (U.S. Department of Homeland Security 2021).\nThe role of climate finance in facilitating mitigation efforts has become an urgent topic in both policy and academic discussions. The IPCC AR6 Report (Chapter 15.3) (Kreibiehl et al. 2021), as well as reports from The Climate Policy Initiative (Buchner et al. 2019) and the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment (Songwe et al. 2022), highlight the persistent gap between available and required financial resources to support global climate action. This study contributes to this ongoing discourse by providing an empirical estimation of how the financial exposure of the insurance industry to CC aligns with economic incentives for proactive mitigation investments. We suggest a pioneering empirical analysis illustrating how climate mitigation investments align with the strategic interests of the insurance industry. By quantifying the potential role of insurers in addressing the climate finance gap, this research underscores the industry\u2019s capacity to act as both a risk aggregator and a potential source of long-term climate mitigation financing.\nLiterature review\nAcademic studies of the insurance market under catastrophic risks are scarce. The insurance industry itself published reports of climate and catastrophic risks (Banerjee et al. 2024), in some cases in collaboration with academic research (Thistlethwaite et al. 2018). Research modeling the behavior of insurance markets under such conditions suggests a binary outcome: markets either achieve full coverage or collapse entirely, heavily influenced by the nature and consistency of government interventions (Charpentier & Le Maux 2014). Furthermore, an analysis from the supply-side perspective reveals that U.S. insurers, facing premium restrictions and increasing losses, resort to cross-subsidizing between states (Sen & Tenekedjieva 2021). This phenomenon, driven by regulatory differences and inelastic demand for insurance, is anticipated to accelerate price increases in less-regulated states. Demand-side analysis indicated that a rational homeowner might choose not to purchase insurance due to the combination of income constraints and the high premiums (Kousky & Cooke 2012). The risk correlation across geographies may limit reinsurance availability.\nWhile reinsurance is critical in addressing catastrophic risks, the current study excludes it due to data limitations and the complexity of modeling reinsurance market dynamics alongside primary insurance markets. Prior research (Gao et al. 2016) highlights the dynamics of reinsurance under catastrophic risks but stops short of fully integrating primary and reinsurance markets within a unified equilibrium framework. This study focuses on empirically applying a simplified model to the homeowners\u2019 insurance market while recognizing that future work could build on these foundations to incorporate reinsurance dynamics.\nCrop insurance is a well-founded, early case of property insurance sensitive to natural hazards (Lunt et al. 2016). Empirical analysis of crop insurance demand has revealed that cross-elasticity between insurance and savings plays a critical role in policy uptake (Hott & Regner 2021). This analysis of farmers\u2019 insurance decisions found that policyholders may prefer self-insurance (savings) over purchasing a policy when faced with high insurance costs. This substitution effect highlights the interplay between budget constraints, income elasticity, and risk mitigation strategies in catastrophic insurance markets. A model for the crop insurance market under catastrophic risk (Duncan & Myers 2000), recently applied to the Property and Casualty (P&C) insurance market (Wu 2020), serves as the primary analytical tool of the current study. Unlike common commodity markets, insurance is traded in a combination of quantity and price. The damage coverage rate and annual premium define short-term equilibrium in the insurance market. In the case of a long-term equilibrium, when firms are free to enter and exit the market, the number of active insurance firms is an additional feature defining the equilibrium. In the case of catastrophic risk, correlated with insured damages, the insurance firms are risk-averse and limited in their ability to reduce the risk by diversification. The assumption of homogeneity among insurers and the use of the first-order condition to identify equilibrium were adopted directly from the Duncan and Myers model cited in the manuscript. This assumption enables a tractable analytical framework while acknowledging that extending the model to incorporate heterogeneity among insurers represents an important avenue for future research.\nInsurance to finance climate mitigation\nThe insurance industry has long recognized that catastrophe losses are not entirely exogenous to its economic decisions (Doherty 1997). Since the Great Fire of London in the seventeenth century, insurers have employed risk management and loss prevention techniques to mitigate market risks while supporting business growth (Mills 2007). These strategies aim to reduce the impact of catastrophes on profitability, with insurers potentially investing in measures mitigating economic loss (M.M.L.), such as selecting low-risk locations, enhancing building standards, or retrofitting structures.\nIn the context of climate change (CC), Carbon dioxide removal (C.D.R.) technologies emerge as essential tools to limit global warming to 1.5 \u00b0C. However, private sector investors often overlook these technologies due to the long duration required for research and development. As CC-induced losses escalate, C.D.R. technologies can serve as M.M.L.s for CC risk, driving insurers to invest in these innovations as a way to offset future risks (Zilberman et al. 2012). Investment decisions in M.M.L.s, including C.D.R.s, are grounded in rigorous cost-benefit analyses. For instance, M.M.L.s for flood risk mitigation in the eastern U.S. were deemed too expensive relative to their financial benefits, illustrating the complexities of such analyses (Mendelsohn & Zheng 2020).\nLiterature on innovation and upscaling of C.D.R. technologies consistently identifies a lack of capital investment as a key barrier to deployment. This constraint stems in part from private investors\u2019 preference for shorter investment horizons, which conflict with the extended timelines required for C.D.R. technologies to achieve maturity (Nemet et al. 2018). As institutional investors, insurers possess a unique advantage, holding 10\u201315% of U.S. capital assets, predominantly in long-duration and low-volatility investments like corporate and municipal bonds (Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness 2019). This long-term perspective positions the insurance sector as a promising private funding source for climate mitigation initiatives.\nRecent developments, such as Swiss Re\u2019s partnership with Climeworks, highlight this potential. Swiss Re\u2019s ten-year contract with Climeworks supports the commercialization and cost reduction of C.D.R. technologies, creating opportunities while addressing CC risks (Swiss Re 2021). This initiative exemplifies the role insurers can play as global integrators of CC risks across economic sectors (Porrini 2011), leveraging their position to reduce losses and drive systemic change.\nMotivated by the financial needs of climate mitigation efforts, this study aims to quantify and assign CC costs to rational decision-makers, proposing the insurance industry as a key player in bridging this gap. The analysis highlights the industry\u2019s competitive advantage in long-term investments and infrastructure projects, making it less susceptible to present bias. Through the lens of U.S. homeowners\u2019 insurance under hurricane risk, the study explores the potential for insurers to reallocate resources from profitability declines to climate mitigation investments. This approach contributes to commercial loss reduction and reinforces the industry\u2019s broader role in facilitating a sustainable economy.\nBy refining and adapting a model originally developed for the agricultural risk insurance market (Duncan & Myers 2000), the research accurately reflects the dynamics of the homeowners\u2019 insurance market. Using a unique dataset compiled from diverse sources, the study evaluates the future risks associated with climate-driven hurricanes and their implications for the insurance market\u2019s stability and profitability. These findings emphasize the necessity for a dual approach- mitigating financial vulnerabilities while actively investing in long-term climate solutions.\nMaterials and methods\nTo examine the economic implications of climate change (CC) on the insurance sector, we quantify the impact of CC-induced hurricane damages on total producer surplus (profitability). Our methodology follows a structured approach: First, we develop a theoretical framework that simulates insurance market equilibrium in response to climate-related escalations in hurricane damage. This framework is informed by historical insurance market data, climate-economic projections (Dinan 2017; Duncan & Myers 2000), and socio-economic forecasts for the end of the century. Second, we employ a comparative static analysis to estimate the resulting changes in the insurance industry\u2019s profitability. Finally, to assess the potential role of the insurance sector in financing climate mitigation, we compare the projected decline in profitability with the share of global emission reduction targets. This final step provides an empirical basis for discussing the insurance sector\u2019s potential as a financial aggregator for climate change mitigation, a consideration expanded upon in the Discussion section.\nThe theoretical framework\nTo assess how climate change (CC) affects the equilibrium in the homeowners\u2019 insurance market, we employed a competitive equilibrium model initially developed for crop insurance under catastrophic risk (Duncan & Myers 2000), rooted in the Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976) framework, that accounts for correlated catastrophic risks among insureds. Recent applications of this model have extended its use to natural catastrophe insurance markets (Wu 2020), making it particularly relevant for this study.\nThe model characterizes a long-term equilibrium by the premium rate per policyholder w, the coverage level as a proportion of loss \\(\\varphi \\in \\left[0,1\\right]\\), and the number of policies sold by each firm n. The total number of insurers in the market can be expressed by \\(\\frac{N}{n}\\), where N is the total number of insurance policies sold, and n is the number of policies sold by each firm. The equilibrium is derived from the simultaneous solution of three equations: short-term demand, short-term supply, and long-term supply (Duncan & Myers 2000).\nFigure 1 presents the changes in a static, single-period setting. The demand (DB) and supply (SB) curves represent the pre-climate change equilibrium, whereas the climate-adjusted curves (DCC and SCC) reflect changes induced by increased damage caused by hurricanes. In this framework, Pins represents the premium price for a given insurance coverage, Qins. The supply curve (S) represents insurance costs per coverage unit, so as more potential damage is insured (higher coverage rate) Qins increases, so does the price per coverage unit, Pins due to heightened risk exposure. The demand curve (D) represents the utility insurers seek, and higher coverage levels typically lead to lower premiums per policyholder, as marginal utility diminishes. At equilibrium, the intersection of D and S determines the profitability of insurers (producer surplus), which is calculated as total revenue minus the area under the supply curve (representing costs).\nSeveral simplifying assumptions were made to focus on the market equilibrium. The product traded in the insurance market coverage is assumed to be homogeneous, while insurers\u2019 behavior is reflected in the demand function. This assumption is grounded in foundational economic models (Rothschild & Stiglitz 1976; Wilson 1977) and has been applied in more recent studies on insurance market dynamics (Djehiche & L\u00f6fdahl 2014; Kong et al. 2024). The assumption of homogeneity among insurers and using the first-order condition to identify equilibrium were adopted from Duncan and Myers and made in other previous works (Gao et al. 2016). These assumptions are crucial for analyzing market size and ensuring analytical tractability. While incorporating insurer heterogeneity could enhance the model\u2019s robustness, it would require extensive additional theoretical and empirical work, which is beyond the scope of this study but represents an important avenue for future research.\nAdditionally, all agents are assumed to be risk-averse (i.e., they tend to avoid risk), with preferences expressed through a mean\u2013variance utility function. The model does not include a liquid secondary reinsurance market, reflecting the absence of fully developed reinsurance mechanisms in the homeowners\u2019 insurance sector. The equilibrium prices are determined using a market-clearing condition. During the initial period, insureds and insurers optimize their portfolios to maximize expected utility, and the effects of these decisions are realized at the end of the period. The risk aversion values are independent of the expected values and variance of the loss. The latter two express the environmental changes as perceived by the market participants.\nThe demand for insurance coverage at the premium w is given by Eq. (1), where \u03bb is the insured\u2019s risk aversion factor, \\(\\bar{l}\\) is the expected loss, and \\({\\sigma }_{l}^{2}\\) is the variance of the loss.\nEquation (1) captures the inverse relationship between premium levels and insurance demand: as premiums increase, demand declines, but an increase in expected loss, risk aversion, or damage variance increases demand. The supply is given by Eq. (2), where c stands for the insurance costs per percentage of covered damage and \u03c8 is the insurer\u2019s risk aversion factor. In most insurance literature, firms providing insurance are assumed to be risk-neutral (Duncan & Myers 2000). All insurers face the same marginal probability distribution for l, but the losses of each pair may be correlated. \u03c1 stands for the correlation coefficient for any two insureds.\nThe supply of insurance coverage increases with premiums and declines with costs, expected loss, risk aversion, and variance of expected loss.\nGenerally, the long-run competitive equilibrium is characterized by zero profits achieved by the free entry and exit of firms. When risk is involved, long-run competitive equilibrium is described by zero expected profits if the producers are risk-neutral (Appelbaum & Katz 1986). The long-term competitive equilibrium, denoted by the superscript 0, is given by Eq. (3), where the reservation preference level of insurers, b, determines the entry or exit of risk-averse firms in the market:\nSolving Eq. (1) for w and substituting the result into Eq. (2), the equilibrium relationship between \u03c6 and n is given by Eq. (4):\nFor any given n, Eq. (4) provides the equilibrium with a coverage level that equates to the demand and short-run supply of insurance.\nTo enhance clarity, Table 1 provides a summary of the key parameters and variables used in the model, detailing their definitions and roles within the theoretical framework.\nData\nHistorical data\nGeneral\nTo assess the accuracy of our theoretical model in simulating market equilibria, we assembled a unique dataset spanning the years 1997\u20132017, incorporating information from multiple sources. The supplementary materials comprehensively outline detailed specifications of the model parameters and assigned values, variables, and data sources (Section SM1.1 and Table SM-1).\nResidual market\nNatural catastrophe insurance in the U.S. is traded, in addition to the commercial market, in the residual market. Residual markets are designed to provide insurance access to homeowners declined by the commercial markets in some high-risk regions. These insurance programs are backed by public funding and are, by definition, not acting as competitive markets. As the available NAIC reports included residual market data, we considered whether including residual market data would distort our analysis. To do that, we sampled data retrieved from the Property Insurance Plans Service (PIPSO). The data did not demonstrate any anomalies that might arise from including the residual market in this analysis, and hence, we carried out the analysis including the residual market data with no concerns of significant bias.\nProjected values\nThe projected values for the expected damage parameter are derived from the outcomes of three distinct models (Dinan 2017; Mendelsohn et al. 2011a), outlined in Table SM-2 in the supplementary material.\nModels A and B originate in the work of Mendelsohn et al. (2011), who estimated the additional annual expected hurricane damage resulting from CC in the U.S. by the end of the twenty-first century using four Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models to predict global warming scenarios under the IPCC A1B SRES emissions scenario. Two damage functions are used to estimate future values of hurricane damage. Model C originates in a follow-up study that accounted for two additional factors- coastal development and sea-level rise (S.L.R.)- in projecting changes in annual damage by the year 2075 (Dinan 2017).\nResults from both studies predicted that the annual hurricane damage will increase due to CC by 0.05% of the expected U.S. GDP for 2100 by model A (Mendelsohn et al. 2011a) and 0.06% for 2075 by model C (Dinan 2017). The projected frequency of storms of category 4\u20135 is predicted to nearly double over the Atlantic, as reflected in the expected average damage increase (Mendelsohn et al. 2011a). Based on the modeling predictions and market practices as reflected in the past data, we estimate the insured loss expected by the agents.\nSensitivity analysis values - equilibrium analysis\nThe variance in hurricane damage and risk aversion is pivotal for projecting market equilibria. However, predictions of their future values are not available in the literature and fall beyond the scope of this study. Therefore, we based our analysis on the observed values and complemented it with sensitivity analyses based on the following estimates.\nHurricane damage variance values for sensitivity analysis\nFor the hurricane damage variance, we chose 3 values that followed an upward trend identified in the 10-year hurricane occurrences variance. This trend is further supported by the strong correlation identified with global sea surface temperature trends (at R2 = 0.703), as illustrated in Fig. 2. The values for hurricane damage variability used in the sensitivity analysis are increases of 20%, 250%, and 400% relative to the most recent variability in damage. Data on Atlantic tropical cyclone occurrences were sourced from the National Hurricane Center hurricane database (H.U.R.D.A.T.), and mean sea surface temperature anomalies were obtained from NOAA Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST.v5).\nRisk aversion values for sensitivity analysis\nWe applied Arrow\u2019s theory of risk aversion by adjusting the observed risk aversion values for the insured. Arrow theorized that individuals\u2019 risk aversion declines as wealth increases relative to capital at risk (Arrow 1974b). While economic growth expectations are readily available as a central factor in public policy planning, the current values for risk aversion are not reported (see Supplementary Materials Section SM1.4. for further details). To estimate current values of risk aversion, we calibrated the theoretical model using observed equilibria data series. The calibrated risk aversion values for the insured population exhibited a declining trend, consistent with economic theory and economic growth, as depicted in Fig. 3. For reference, this figure also includes data on the occurrence of major hurricanes. To validate the accuracy of the range of the calibrated risk aversion values, we consider other relevant studies. For instance, studies of the Chinese crop insurance market (Shen & Odening 2013) and an experimental game design study in the E.U. (Mol et al. 2020), yielded similar values.\nTo estimate the model\u2019s ability to simulate equilibria and the derived producer utility, we conducted a three-stage validation test comparing model outputs to actual profit data. The model successfully validated the employed profit function, explaining 78% of the actual profits. A full description of the validation procedure is provided in the following subsection.\nEmpirical validation\nRisk aversion\nCalibrated values\nRisk-averse factors are of high importance in the insurance market equilibrium and are non-trivial to estimate. As these values are market-specific, they are not commonly available in the literature. We estimated these values by calibrating the theoretical model to reflect actual equilibria and loss expectations. The resulting values for the insurer's risk aversion ranged between 2.9 * 10\u22127 and 3.4 * 10\u22128, and for the insureds ranged between 0.01 and 0.022. Table 2 summarizes the calibrated values and literature references, brought in detail in the following subsection.\nReference values\nReference values from the available literature originated in other locations and are brought to put the calibration results into context. Relevant experimental evidence for insureds (Mol et al. 2020) referred to a 5.79 risk-averse factor (for all participant groups, including ones that did not purchase any insurance, who purchased insurance with or without additional funding, and more), as well as an estimation for Chinese farmers absolute risk aversion (Shen & Odening 2013) at \\(1.4 \\,* \\,10^{-5}\\). The 2020 estimation (Mol et al. 2020) should be interpreted in the context in which it was obtained- a designed game, based on Experimental Currency Units (ECU) and not actual currency. To reach an estimation of relative risk aversion (that corresponds to wealth), we adjusted the estimates by 2017 EU GDP per capita (33,008$) divided by the maximum worth of ECU payoff in the game (converted to USD), which resulted in an absolute risk aversion estimate of 0.139. Once adjusted, the estimation for the US homeowner\u2019s insurance market derived from past data is closer to the one estimated in developed countries, such as the EU, than it is to the one estimated for farmers in a developing country, with the remaining difference potentially resulting from different preferences or game design. Additionally, the scale differences between the two available literature references for insureds' risk aversion highlight the differences in the Chinese and European economies.\nFor insurers, available literature provides estimates depending on the status of the reinsurance markets in terms of capital availability (Tesselaar et al. 2020) (soft and hard markets), ranging from 0.4 to 0.7, and estimation of Chinese insurers absolute risk aversion (Shen & Odening 2013) at 1.4 * 10\u22129. The model calibration results are closer to the estimation for the Chinese market made at 1.4 * 10\u22129 than it is to the one made for the EU market.\nTheory of risk bearing\nTo further support the calibrated values, we turn to economic theory to confirm our estimations. The Theory of Risk Bearing (Arrow 1974b) indicates that absolute risk aversion is expected to decrease under increased wealth. As expected under economic growth, the calibrated values followed a similar clear decreasing trend for both insureds\u2019 and insurers\u2019 risk-aversion. Figure 3 illustrates this trend, as well as the count of major hurricanes during this period. As of the year 2005 (the hurricane season including hurricanes Katrina, Wilma, and Rita), the insurers\u2019 absolute risk aversion was found to be correlated with the number of over a billion-dollar hurricanes, suggesting that insurers annually adjust this parameter with experience.\nAlthough projecting future risk aversion involves many uncertain factors, we did our best to estimate it, for the demand side, by the Theory of Risk Bearing and economic growth expectations. This work theorized (Arrow 1974a) that individuals\u2019 absolute risk aversion results from their wealth and attitude towards risk, declining as wealth increases relatively to capital at risk. This implies that generally, the observed trend is expected to continue as a result of steady economic growth. Since both economic growth and capital at risk (property value) are influenced by population growth (Baker et al. 2005), to estimate the future risk aversion, we take one step forward. We break down the economic growth to its basic elements of labor, capital, and technological development (Sredojevi\u0107 et al. 2016). We make a simplifying assumption that population growth will increase the demand for housing, thus will be reflected in housing prices (Jud & Winkler 2002). As labor-induced (population) growth is reflected in the value of capital at risk, it will not affect absolute risk aversion. For this reason, we estimate the decline in future risk aversion by deducting the expected population growth rate from the total expected growth rate. Due to the significant uncertainty in projecting these trends by the end of the 21st century, this analysis used the last known absolute risk aversion value (see Table 2), followed by a sensitivity analysis of the future decreased absolute risk aversion, estimated as follows:\n-\nTo decrease future insureds\u2019 risk aversion, we used the U.S economic growth estimation by the year 2060 (longest available), 1.36%.\n-\nThe expected population growth rate is estimated at 0.49% by the year 2060.\n-\nThe difference between the total and population growth rate was compounded for the end of the century, and we decreased the risk aversion by the resulting factor.\nProfit estimation\nTo estimate the model\u2019s ability to simulate equilibria and the derived producer utility, modeling results were compared to actual profits in a three-stage test on a time series of annual industry\u2019s profits collected from NAIC\u2019s report \u201cStatistical Compilation of Annual Statement Information for Property/Casualty Insurance Companies\u201d :\n-\nTo validate our knowledge of the industry\u2019s profit function, we first calibrated the profit function with all known past data series. We calculated the profits based on past known equilibria and actual incurred losses. The calculated profits accounted for over 85% of actual underwriting profits (R2 = 0.854).\n-\nIn the second stage, we gradually move from calibration to making projections using the theoretical model. We used the theoretical model to simulate a time series of past equilibria based on the actual incurred loss, and not the loss expected by the agents. The time series of underwriting profit calculated by the simulated equilibria accounted for 78% of actual profits (R2 = 0.78), indicating the model captures well the industry\u2019s rational behavior.\n-\nFinally, at the third stage, we projected the profits based on equilibria simulated with expected loss (pre-estimated by agents\u2019 past experience, according to the 95% confidence level of a normal distribution) - in this case, 55% of the profit was explained by the model, indicating that profit is mostly dominated by the ability to estimate the expected loss.\nWhile actual financial results are volatile along financial years, spanning from 12 billion USD in loss to a 14 billion USD profit between 1997 and 2017 (with a standard deviation of 8.6 billion), the simulated results are much less volatile (with a standard deviation of USD 4.7 Billion in real prices), due to their dependence on a shorter past damage record.\nResults\nEquilibrium analysis\nWe start by simulating the future insurance market equilibrium under CC-driven hurricane damage and compare it to the scenario without the impact of CC. The perceptible effect of CC on hurricane damage is visible only gradually over long periods due to its slow, ongoing nature (R. Mendelsohn, personal communications, July 19, 2021). We, therefore, report the projections of loss in utility (profits) for a single year in the far future (2100). In our baseline scenario simulation, we incorporated solely socio-economic changes, while in the CC scenarios, we adjusted the mean damage based on climate impact projections sourced from existing literature (Dinan 2017; Mendelsohn et al. 2011b).\nFigure 4 depicts the simulated demand and supply curves for the end of the century for three models predicting hurricane damages under CC. For each model, we compare a baseline scenario (without CC) and a scenario incorporating CC-induced damage projections.\nThe demand curve slope follows the standard notion due to the decreasing marginal utility assumed in the model. The supply slope is almost horizontal due to the insurers\u2019 low risk-aversion, resulting in a supply level dominated mainly by the expected insurance costs (insured damage). The slope of the short-term supply function reflects the multiplication of the insurers\u2019 risk aversion, the damage variance, the number of insurers, and the damage correlation coefficient. In this case, the parameters assumed unattributable to CC (i.e., interannual variance, risk aversion, insured damage correlation coefficient) lead to the combined effect of the correlation coefficient and the count of insurers on the supply curve slope to be negligible. The combination of damage variance and insurers\u2019 risk aversion reflects the uncertainty and dominates the supply curve slope. As a result of the supply curve slope, the premium (Pins) is constant irrelevant of the share of insurance coverage (Qins).\nUnder all three models, the equilibrium (intersection point of supply and demand curves) for changing hurricane damages resulted in a reduced coverage rate and increased annual premium. The coverage rate is expected to decline from 10% (top panel) to 100% (bottom panel, referring to a damage model that includes sea-level rise). A 100% decrease indicates the equilibrium characterizes an incomplete market, as shown by the negative coverage rate. The premium is expected to increase by 6\u201310% to support the equilibria. The number of insurance providers is projected to grow by 11.5\u201341%.\nSensitivity analysis\nThe interannual variability of hurricane damage and risk aversion reflects the willingness of homeowners to pay for insurance. The interannual variability reflects the predictability of the damage, whereas lower variability means higher predictability, which reduces willingness to pay, and vice versa. Risk aversion reflects behavioral preferences.\nThe sensitivity analysis reveals that insurance premiums rise with interannual variability and expected damage, coverage rate increases with interannual variability but declines with expected damage, and the number of insurance providers diminishes with increasing interannual variability but expands with rising expected damage.\nThe combination of reduced risk aversion and a substantially increased interannual variability (250\u2013400%) is expected to lead in 2 out of 6 cases to an incomplete market as a result of CC. In four other cases, the coverage rate is expected to decrease by 6\u201351% and the number of insurance providers is expected to increase by as much as double to support these equilibria. The complete results and the sensitivity analyses are included in the supplementary material (Additional Results), while exemplary results are shown in Fig. 5.\nProjected change in producer utility\nTable 3 presents our projections of the annual total producer utility, often referred to as producer surplus or profit, based on shifts in market equilibria. These projections are expressed as relative changes from a simulated baseline, representing the annual utility without CC impacts. It should be noted that these baselines, set for the end of the century, vary due to differing assumptions about the impact of socio-economic growth.\nUnder the current level of risk aversion and no or relatively moderate increase in damage interannual variability (0\u201320%), the expected annual producer utility declines by 7%\u2013100% due to increased CC-induced hurricane damage.\nThe sensitivity analysis underscores that fluctuations in damage variability exert an opposite influence on producer utility compared to alterations in mean damage. Specifically, the impact of rising mean damage is counterbalanced by increased interannual variance, as illustrated across the columns within each panel. This pattern suggests that heightened interannual variability amplifies the attractiveness of insurance, with demand being more responsive to this variability than supply. Consequently, producer utility experiences an increase when compared to scenarios where CC affects only the mean damage.\nThe lower section of Table 3 outlines the projected changes in producer utility in the context of future risk aversion. Steady-state equilibria are only attained with a substantial (fourfold) increase in interannual damage variability, leading to an annual profitability reduction between 6% and 50%. A 2.5-fold increase in interannual variability yields a sustainable equilibrium solely under the most conservative mean damage estimates, resulting in a 14.4% reduction in producer profitability. A moderate escalation in interannual variability culminates in an incomplete home insurance market, where supply fails to meet demand irrespective of expected damage levels, precluding any transactions. It should be noted that this outcome is not definitively attributable to CC.\nDiscussion and conclusions\nOur research offers a comprehensive analysis of the financial vulnerabilities and opportunities of the homeowners\u2019 insurance sector in the context of climate change (CC). It is grounded on the premise, supported by prior research, that CC will intensify hurricane damages within the U.S., thus straining the availability of insurance and escalating community vulnerability. This paper distinguishes itself as the inaugural empirical exploration of these dynamics within the primary homeowners\u2019 insurance market and its financial repercussions. Our findings contribute to the existing literature on CC costs. We find that an increase in the mean hurricane damage, along with socioeconomic changes, is expected to cause a 10.5%\u2013100% reduction in the profitability of the primary homeowners\u2019 insurance market.\nPrevious studies have posited that CC will exacerbate hurricane damages in the U.S., thereby diminishing the availability of insurance and leaving communities increasingly vulnerable to risks, with governments stepping in for post-disaster relief. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis to empirically demonstrate this outcome and the resulting financial implications in the primary homeowners\u2019 insurance market.\nThe findings of this study contribute to the growing discourse on the financial vulnerabilities of the homeowners\u2019 insurance market under climate change. While the primary analysis quantifies the expected decline in insurers\u2019 profitability due to increased hurricane damage, these results also raise broader considerations regarding how insurers might proactively respond to climate risks beyond pricing adjustments and coverage reductions. Given the scale of projected losses, the potential role of insurers in financing climate mitigation efforts becomes increasingly relevant. While insurers have historically focused on risk management through pricing strategies and reinsurance mechanisms, an alternative approach involves leveraging their financial position to invest in mitigation measures that could reduce long-term climate risks. The following analysis explores this potential by examining the extent to which the homeowners\u2019 insurance sector could contribute to bridging the climate finance gap through targeted investments in emission reduction, aligning financial resilience with broader sustainability goals.\nClimate mitigation finance potential\nIt has long been argued that the insurance industry should include risk minimization in its investment decisions to protect its financial stability while responding to climate change, although regulatory restrictions might prevent it from doing so (CRO Forum 2018). We assert the critical positioning of the insurance industry at the intersection of short-term private capital markets and long-term policymaking. This unique positioning underscores the industry\u2019s potential role in facilitating CC mitigation through strategic investments, despite historical challenges and regulatory constraints that might have hindered such endeavors. Following its primary results, our research estimates the potential contribution the insurance sector could make towards achieving global emission reduction targets, measured against the reduction in the primary homeowners\u2019 insurance market profitability. This analysis quantitatively delineates the financial incentives for direct climate mitigation investments by the U.S. homeowners\u2019 insurance sector, contrasting potential profitability losses against the imperative to bridge the climate mitigation finance gap, as no causal link between responsible investments and an increased return has been consistently identified in the past (J\u00f3hannsd\u00f3ttir et al. 2012).\nFor this purpose, we extrapolate the achievable share of the global emission reduction target equivalent to the projected profitability decline resulting from CC. The profitability reduction is based on the 2020 annual profit for the homeowners\u2019 insurance industry. We set the baseline of producer utility as the 10-year average annual profit for 2020 (stands at USD 49.83 billion - as reflected in financial summaries provided by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), including investment gains as a primary source of profit (driven by premium revenues) and adjusted for socio-economic change. The study posits that insurers could channel resources equivalent to their profit reduction into emission reduction investments through the voluntary carbon market. Emission reductions are quantified using the market price for voluntary carbon credits, reflecting the cost of offsetting one tonne of CO2-equivalent emissions. While this redirection of resources would not sustain immediate profitability, it represents a strategic approach to ensuring the industry\u2019s future viability. By actively participating in climate change mitigation, insurers reduce long-term risks associated with climate-induced damages, ultimately preserving their market size. This trade-off between short-term profitability and long-term sustainability underscores the industry\u2019s potential role as a key player in the global transition toward a low-carbon economy. The required emission reductions are sourced from updated emissions data and UNEP\u2019s targets, which aim to limit global mean temperature increases to 1.5 \u00b0C. We account for two additional factors - the discount rate and the emission reduction price. Since projecting these future values is out of the scope of this research, we use present-voluntary market prices of emission reduction, and three potential discount rates to reflect the range between long-term private and social discount rates. Figure 6 illustrates the share of the annual emission reduction target potentially funded by the insurers\u2019 annual utility reduction, for each discount rate, r. In estimating the cost of mitigation, we take a conservative approach by not accounting for cost reduction through the learning effect.\nUnder existing levels of risk aversion, the U.S. insurance industry could contribute to as much as 85% of the global emission reduction target at a zero-discount rate (indicated by yellow bars), and up to 14% at elevated discount rates (represented by red and blue bars). The significance of the discount rate resides in its ability to articulate the societal trade-off between present and future resource allocation. A higher discount rate suggests elevated growth expectations, thereby elevating the present value of money and diminishing the present value of future benefits. The projection of discount rates involves both uncertainty and ethical considerations, making it a subject of extensive debate (Guo et al., 2006; Mendelsohn, 2006). When risk aversion is reduced, our analysis focuses solely on scenarios with increased interannual variability, as changes in equilibrium could not be definitively attributed to CC with interannual variability increased by less than 120%. Under these conditions, the achievable share of the emission reduction target ranges from 40% to 130% at a zero-discount rate and between 4% and 21% at higher discount rates.\nThis estimation assumes that eliminating a specific portion of emissions would correspondingly reduce losses in the insurance sector and that there is no free riding. We bring this evaluation as proof of concept that illuminates the substantial mitigation potentially realized, even if only insurers in developed nations were to act with similar incentives. It is important to note that the insurance industry\u2019s limited risk-bearing capacity exempts it from most regulations on market power, making it more cooperative compared to other competitive markets (European Commission. Directorate General for Competition & Europe Economics 2016; Malone 2020). Yet, we employ a conservative estimation methodology that does not account for cost reductions through technological advancements. Notably, under varying scenarios of risk aversion and discount rates, considering that the entire insurance industry constitutes approximately 3% of the U.S. economy (U.S. Bureau of Economic analysis, 2021), our findings reveal the insurance industry\u2019s potential to significantly exceed its proportional contribution to the U.S. economy in terms of emission reduction, highlighting its vital role in pooling financial resources for CC costs. This is particularly relevant for individuals facing increased financial vulnerabilities due to a dwindling supply of insurance and rising insurance premiums induced by CC. As profitability diminishes, the costs associated with CC are increasingly internalized by the insurance industry. This creates an incentive for the sector to invest in climate mitigation efforts as a strategy to offset the losses (Mills 2007). Future research assessing governmental interventions, such as subsidized premiums, would benefit policy implications. Government subsidies of insurance premiums shift the costs back to the public in ways that mask their cause. In that sense, the current U.S. policy ambition to set a risk-based N.F.I.P. premium is important in removing barriers to CC cost internalization.\nAvenues for future research\nThe discount rate is critical in estimating the long-term benefits of CC mitigation investments in terms of their present value. We used three different values to match the time preferences of different decision-makers. However, these are based on the current interest rate environment, and the discount rate itself is subject to the dynamics of capital markets. Excessive damages from natural catastrophes might affect the cost of capital in the global markets due to the recapitalization needs of reinsurers and the increase in the discount rate, which might cause a cascade when increasing return rates make investments in climate mitigation less rewarding.\nIt is important to recall that this analysis was made nationwide, due to the nature of the risk and the structure of the U.S. insurance market. Global factors influence both the risk and the capital market, and hurricane risk has broader implications beyond coastal regions due to the practice of cross-subsidizing insurance premiums across states. However, the global scale limits the ability to address the meaningful variability of vulnerability and the demand for insurance through risk aversion, and potentially leads to a mean effect. Therefore, we conducted our analysis for the entire U.S., as a relatively homogeneous domain in its economic activity, to analyze the whole market that is exposed to a dominant risk of hurricane damage.\nThe data retrieved from the EM-DAT database contains the cost of all hurricane damages, including the commercial and public sectors. However, we did not find substantial differences between including these data and using the homeowners\u2019 coverage rate alone as a proxy of covered damage. It is also worth noting that EM-DAT is not a complete database of all insured damages, and future research that builds on cooperating with the insurance industry itself can have a meaningful contribution to both research and the insurance sector.\nThe theoretical model emphasizes insurers\u2019 ability to diversify risk as a critical factor in the supply of natural catastrophe insurance, as expressed in the model through the correlation coefficient between any two insureds. In this analysis, we used the correlation between any two states as a proxy. We did not account for future changes in this correlation, as the literature lacks climatic predictions of CC effects on the geographical variation. Emerging climate research of CC-induced changes in storms\u2019 tracks may allow further research to address variation in the spatial distribution of hurricane damages and the resulting change in risk correlation.\nLimitations\nThe limitation of our model is its theoretical treatment of income elasticity. The model does not account for budget constraints or the availability of substitute products. As a result, the insureds are assumed to accept the insurance price even in scenarios where risks are fully correlated, negating any advantage that insurance might offer over simply saving money.\nData availability is another potential limitation, as it may be biased in describing solely the trend observed in this time frame, not capturing any trends or driving forces that may span other periods.\nDespite these limitations, the analysis presented in this study offers a perspective of CC implications for the homeowners\u2019 insurance market, relevant in estimating future climate change costs. Considering the potential costs against the mitigation finance gap aims to explore potential future trends rather than asserting current widespread investment by insurance firms in CDR. Nevertheless, we have provided evidence of initiatives by insurance companies like Swiss Re's collaboration with Climeworks (Swiss Re 2021). Present investments in emission reduction not only stand to enhance the insurance industry\u2019s resilience against future climate impacts but also contribute to the broader transition toward a sustainable, green economy.\nData availability\n1.

      "text": "As climate impacts intensify and financial markets adapt, two new reports \u2014Howden\u2019s Insurability Imperative and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development\u2019s 2025 Business Breakthrough Barometer\u2014 reveal a reality that diverges sharply from the prevailing narrative.\nDespite headlines about ESG backlash and net-zero retreats, companies are not abandoning climate goals. They are embedding them into core strategy, shifting from compliance to competitiveness. At the same time, insurers are redrawing the boundaries of investability, making insurability a frontline filter for capital allocation.\nThese trends mark a profound shift in how risk is understood, priced, and managed. Climate change is not tied to political cycles or market sentiment. Its impacts are structural and cumulative, reshaping both the physical world and global finance. As the Barometer notes, \u2018where governments lead with clarity, business capital follows\u2019. In the absence of coherent policy, insurers are stepping in to decide what can and cannot be financed. With governments falling short, markets are beginning to price in climate resilience \u2014and for many sectors, it\u2019s no longer optional.\nClimate Risk Is Market Risk\nThe Business Breakthrough Barometer underscores this shift. Despite public skepticism and ESG backlash, most companies are not abandoning their goals. Instead, they are reallocating capital based on a more immediate truth, that climate risk has become business risk\nAccording to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, we are on track to breach the 1.5 \u00b0C warming threshold within six years or less. This is not a future concern but a present financial reality. Record heatwaves, vanishing ice and billion-dollar disasters are reshaping how risk is modeled and priced.\nAs WBCSD president and chief executive Peter Bakker said in an interview: \u201cThe climate won\u2019t wait for the market to find consensus. It won\u2019t adjust itself to quarterly earnings. What it demands is system change, in how we price risk, share it, and design markets around physical realities.\u201d\nTraditional Planning Is Breaking Down\nThe economic transition is unfolding in ways that traditional business systems cannot manage. Companies still rely on linear models \u2014 forecasts, fixed returns, long timelines \u2014 while the net-zero shift is volatile, uneven and often misaligned with policy and consumer behavior.\nThis misalignment plays out across sectors. EV production is accelerating while charging infrastructure lags. Carbon capture projects are stalling amid weak demand signals, while the decarbonisation of buildings is slowed by outdated codes and permitting bottlenecks. In each case, technological readiness is colliding with systems that are not fit for transition.\nAs Bakker argues, sustainability must move from reporting to real governance, from targets to embedded decision-making. That means adopting robust frameworks like the ISSB\u2019s S1 and S2, aligning climate strategy with operational and financial reality.\nFrom ESG To Embedded Strategy\nThe Barometer reveals a decisive shift: 91% of companies surveyed have either maintained or increased their climate-related investments over the past year (as of May 2025). Crucially, 56% cited long-term competitiveness, not compliance, as the main driver.\nWhile high-profile exits from alliances like the Net-Zero Banking Alliance or corporate withdrawal and redesign of net zero targets dominate headlines, many firms are shifting focus. They are beginning to embed climate resilience into core business functions such as capital planning, supply chains and governance. \u201cWe\u2019ve got sufficient data to act,\u201d said Bakker. \u201cThe perfect mustn\u2019t delay progress.\u201d\nHowden\u2019s Warning: Insurability Now Dictates Investability\nNowhere is this financial recalibration more visible than in insurance markets. Howden\u2019s new Insurability Imperative report warns that insurability is becoming a prerequisite for investability. As climate risks escalate, insurers are withdrawing from high-risk zones and redlining regions. What cannot be insured cannot be financed, and what cannot be financed cannot scale.\nHistorical shocks have prompted similar responses: the Great Fire of London led to fire codes and insurance pools, while 19th-century boiler explosions catalyzed modern engineering standards. Today\u2019s escalating climate risks are driving a comparable redesign in how markets address risk particularly in infrastructure, agriculture, and real estate.\nInsurability now operates as an early indicator of systemic viability, determining which assets, sectors, and geographies remain viable. To secure capital companies must increasingly demonstrate resilience through adaptation planning, risk mitigation and long-term feasibility. \u201cResilience is investable,\u201d Bakker says. \u201cBut only if we build the conditions to make it so, together.\u201d\nThis marks a deeper shift in how risk is understood and priced. Unlike weather patterns, climate change isn\u2019t cyclical\u2014it brings long-term, structural disruption that\u2019s redefining business models and investment priorities. As the Barometer notes, where governments lead with clarity, capital follows. In the absence of coherent policy, insurers are stepping in to decide what can and cannot be financed. With governments falling short, markets are beginning to price in climate resilience and for many sectors, it is no longer optional.\nWhen Policy Stalls, Capital Retreats\nBakker argues that the climate transition depends on aligning three forces: policy, business, and finance. Policy sets direction, business delivers scale, and finance provides capital. When these pillars are aligned, markets function but when they are not, the system stalls.\nThis disconnect plays out across sectors and is creating tangible capital bottlenecks, with the misalignment especially visible in energy markets. While capital still flows disproportionately to low-risk, mature technologies like solar and wind, funding for capital intensive decarbonisation solutions like hydrogen and carbon capture are falling. In 2024, global investment in clean energy reached a record $2 trillion yet hydrogen investment declined by 42%, and carbon capture by 56%.\nThese bottlenecks are not down to a lack of ambition but rather structural weaknesses, including lack of regulatory certainty, underdeveloped infrastructure, and crucially a lack of offtake agreements to guarantee long-term market demand. \u201cThere must be offtake,\u201d said Bakker. \u201cThere must be market creation.\u201d\nFrom Risk Modelling To Risk Leadership\nPolicy must now evolve to enable markets, not just regulate them. Ninety-four percent of Barometer respondents said clear, consistent policy is essential to unlock climate investment but 54% no longer trust governments to deliver them. That credibility gap is already reshaping capital flows and creating geographic winners and losers.\nAccording to the Barometer, Asia and Europe are increasingly viewed as more attractive for investment than the United States. In the U.S., political volatility has undermined confidence in the Inflation Reduction Act contributing to nearly $15.5 billion in abandoned or scaled-back projects.\n\u201cMarkets need frameworks that translate ambition into investable pathways and real-world price signals,\u201d Bakker said. Insurability, investability, and effective regulation are now interdependent. Unless policy reflects the full scope of physical and financial risk, not just short-term political cycles, systems that look solid on paper may collapse under pressure.\nFrom Intent to Delivery At COP30\nThe growing pressure in insurance markets underscores the urgency as attention turns to COP30 in Brazil. \u201cWe don\u2019t need another moment of intent\u201d warns Bakker. \u201cWe need a moment of delivery.\u201d Two structural shifts are defining this new phase: implementation is moving from public to private actors, those who control supply chains, capital, and operations; meanwhile momentum is shifting from the Global North to the Global South, where climate vulnerability, economic growth, and industrial opportunity increasingly converge.\nThe climate transition can be profitable, resilient, and equitable if businesses, policymakers, and financial institutions can co-create markets grounded in both physical and financial realities. The markets that align around this are likely to shape the next era of economic leadership."

Since the Eurosystem\u2019s refinancing operations are a key instrument in maintaining price stability, the Governing Council has decided to introduce a \u201cclimate factor\u201d which could reduce the value assigned to eligible assets pledged as collateral, depending on the extent to which an asset can be impacted by these uncertainties. This acts as a buffer against the possible financial impact of uncertainties related to climate change. It will complement the Eurosystem\u2019s existing risk management toolbox by considering forward-looking climate scenario analyses and therefore improve the resilience of the Eurosystem\u2019s monetary policy implementation. The calibration of the measure will preserve adequate collateral availability.\nThe Governing Council has decided to introduce the climate factor focusing on marketable assets issued by non-financial corporations as well as their affiliated entities, and adverse events specifically associated with the green transition. The climate factor will apply to individual assets and its calibration will take into account sector-level data of non-financial corporation bonds in the 2024 climate stress test of the Eurosystem\u2019s balance sheet[1], the issuer\u2019s CSPP climate score and the asset\u2019s residual maturity.\nThis measure is due to be implemented in the second half of 2026. It will be regularly reviewed by the Governing Council to reflect the increasing availability of data and models, as well as relevant regulatory developments and advances in risk assessment capabilities.\nFor media queries, please contact Clara Mart\u00edn Marqu\u00e9s, tel.: +49 69 1344 17919.\nEuropean Central Bank\nDirectorate General Communications\n- Sonnemannstrasse 20\n- 60314 Frankfurt am Main, Germany\n- +49 69 1344 7455\n- media@ecb.europa.eu\nReproduction is permitted provided that the source is acknowledged.\nMedia contacts"
