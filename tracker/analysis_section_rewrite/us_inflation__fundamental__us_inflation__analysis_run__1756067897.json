      "feedback": "This draft already hits meaningful links between AI displacement, UBI debates, and cyclical auto exposure, but to reach world‑class level you need a tighter, regime‑based, first‑principles framework with explicit multi‑year anchoring, rigorous quantification, and precise sourcing. Actionable edits in one paragraph: 1) Add a formal multi‑year regime scaffold with invariant anchors (productivity growth gAI, real rate r*, terms of trade, BoP/net external position, and a policy‑reaction function) and define transition conditions (e.g., adoption of AI tech at scale, UBI/insurance design shifts, and tariff/semiconductor investment cycles); state how these drive risk premia, wage dynamics, and capital reallocation, then map to market pricing. 2) Build a transparent causal chain: AI productivity uplift → sectoral reallocation and wage pressure → policy responses (UBI or social insurance design) and fiscal space constraints → pricing of risk at asset and macro levels; tie each link to concrete, sourced numbers (e.g., 25% of US employment high automation exposure; 70% task content at risk; Finland UBI trial employment effects). 3) Quantify the base case and scenarios with explicit ranges: base‑case potential output and trend growth, auto/EV cycle sensitivity to rates, and tariff‑driven inflation effects; incorporate concrete numbers (Tariffs potentially cost around $3,800/year of purchasing power per household per Yale/Budget Lab framing; Ford Q2 EV losses of about $1.3B; Ford’s 5.18% dividend yield; 8–10x forward P/E; 17% YTD 2025 gain but limited long‑horizon upside). 4) Expand transmission channels beyond “policy signals”: include real‑income effects, debt/credit channels, capex cycles, and financial‑system implications of higher policy risk; treat auto sector as a cyclical risk barometer and as a clean proxy for policy/credit conditions. 5) Strengthen scenario structure: delineate Base, Upside (accelerated AI deployment with targeted policy design that mitigates identity costs), and Downside (policy mispricing, inflationary spillovers, or geopolitics) with explicit triggers (AI milestone, UBI pilot results, tariff escalations) and clear invalidation conditions (e.g., sustained wage/stability improvements vs. persistent unemployment). 6) Integrate critical meta‑costs from retirement literature (long‑term care, inflation, healthcare) with quantified ranges and watch metrics to illustrate household balance‑sheet risk; cite sources like the 3–6 month emergency fund rule, 3.7% safe withdrawal rate, and $3,800/year tariff impact where relevant (NL5YYTLF2; YVQU6QCY4; 6 Key Signs; 50+ retirement habits pieces). 7) Tighten citation discipline: attach each numerical claim to a source ID (e.g., automation exposure figures to NL5YYTLF2; Ford EV losses and margins to 22PL3Q360/W2622L6WW; tariff/purchasing power to SGB2PAZGK and Yale/Budget Lab notes; retirement cost/withdrawal stats to YVQU6QCY4 and 12/15 GO Banking Rates pieces), and reconcile conflicts (e.g., Ford as dividend income vs. growth skeptic, EV profitability trajectory, and the breadth of UBI empirical results). 8) Improve alignment with SECTION FOCUS by presenting a concise base‑case narrative, then a short list of watchpoints (policy announcements, tariff cadence, AI deployment progress, major capex announcements in semiconductors/energy, and long‑term care inflation), and finish with a calibrated confidence assessment and the specific probabilities or ranges used.",
