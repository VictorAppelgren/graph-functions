      "feedback": "The analysis draft provides a solid overview of the current macroeconomic landscape influenced by trade policies, but it lacks depth in articulating the causal chain and market transmission mechanisms. To elevate the analysis to world-class quality, enhance the clarity of reasoning by explicitly linking how tariffs impact consumer prices and inflation, using specific numerical examples or projections where possible. Ensure alignment with the multi-year horizon by discussing potential long-term effects on productivity and competitiveness, particularly in the semiconductor industry. Incorporate first-principles grounding by referencing real rate differentials and terms-of-trade implications. Additionally, improve scenario structure by outlining specific catalysts for potential policy changes and triggers for market reactions, such as consumer sentiment shifts or retaliatory measures from trade partners. Finally, increase citation density by integrating more sources to support claims and reconcile any conflicting viewpoints, particularly regarding the implications of deregulation on competition.",
