  "content": "The Camera Control button on the current iPhone 16 Pro\n\nWhere a previous leak claimed Apple was cutting component orders ahead of ditching the Camera Control, a new one insists that a redesigned version will remain in the iPhone 18.\n\nThe leak saying that Camera Control was to be ditched in 2026 came from Weibo-based leaker \"OvO,\" who does not have a great track record. He or she most often repeats rumors from other leakers, and in this case the lack of any other similar reports made the claim seem unlikely.\n\nNow there is another report, but it is denying the earlier claims. This one comes from a leaker on Weibo too, but \"Instant Digital\" has at least a better track record.\n\nThe leaker says on Weibo, that Apple is simplifying the design of the Camera Control in order to save costs. Currently, the Camera Control is a button that has capacitive and pressure-sensing functionality, but the capacitor is being removed.\n\nReportedly, the current Camera Control is expensive to manufacture and also costly to service and repair. Apple will save costs and complexity by turning into solely a pressure-sensitive button.\n\nThe claim is that the revised Camera Control would continue to allow for the same kind of touch, longer press, and swiping gestures as the current model.\n\nYet leaker \"Instant Digital\" does echo one part of the previous report, to do with how the button is allegedly little used. The earlier report said it was simply never touched, but this one argues that it's the control's Visual Intelligence feature that is underused.\n\nConsequently, claims the leaker, the Camera Control is of less use than it could be. This has allegedly resulted in internal pressure at Apple to lower its cost.\n\nNote that \"Instant Digital\" does have a better track record for leaks, and perhaps most relevantly, a better record for leaks about Camera Control. He or she was an early source for Apple adding the feature in the first place.",

Despite its redesign, the Camera Control feature is reportedly underused, prompting Apple to seek cost reductions.",
