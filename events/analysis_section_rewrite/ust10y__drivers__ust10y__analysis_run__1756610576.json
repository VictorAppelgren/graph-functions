      "feedback": "**Edit instructions (compact, actionable):**  \n1. **Condense repetition** – merge the three “Fed cut → 2‑yr → 10‑yr → DXY” paragraphs into a single, 4‑sentence causal chain:  \n   *Fed’s 25‑bp cut → 2‑yr yield falls → 2‑yr/10‑yr spread widens (≈57 bp) → 10‑yr yield rises (≈30 bp) → real‑yield differential and dollar term premium expand → DXY up 0.5–1 % over 3–6 mo.* Cite (B1KYJ1GPU)(XTQIQRP5K)(NIT6JFIQF)(FAN5RYW6T)(Z7O1DCHS7)(LF0UUL917).  \n2. **Quantify the short‑term move** – state that DXY is projected to decline 200 bp to 95.8 by Aug 31, driven by an 86 % probability of the cut and a 57 bp steepening of the 2‑yr/10‑yr spread (cite (Z7O1DCHS7)(7XH2DKEKV)).  \n3. **Clarify catalysts** – list a concise watch‑list: early‑Aug CPI, Aug 30 PCE, Aug 31 NFP, Jackson Hole (late Aug), and the Sept 25 Fed meeting. For each, add a short “impact” sentence with a citation, e.g. “PCE > 3 % → DXY +50–100 bp” (cite (7XH2DKEKV)).  \n4. **State risks in one paragraph** – “Fed rate hike or 2‑yr/10‑yr spread flattening below 30 bp would compress the dollar’s term premium and stall the rally; a steepening Treasury supply from Fed balance‑sheet contraction could also blunt gains.” Cite (97MD1FHW8)(LF0UUL917)(7XH2DKEKV).  \n5. **Remove redundant sentences** – delete all repeated mentions of mortgage rates, 30‑yr rates, and generic “Fed policy” statements that do not add new information.  \n6. **Use canonical handles** – ensure every claim references a canonical handle: dxy, ust10y, ust2y, fed_policy. Replace any ambiguous terms (e.g., “dollar” → dxy).  \n7. **Add a probability statement** – “Confidence in the base case is moderate, with a 60 % probability that DXY will finish Q3 near 97.0–97.5.” Cite (B1KYJ1GPU)(XTQIQRP5K).  \n8. **Format** – present the revised view as a single paragraph (≈150 words) with inline citations, no bullet points, and no extraneous fluff.  \n9. **Validate citations** – ensure every claim has at least one ID; remove any citation that does not correspond to a source in the material.",
