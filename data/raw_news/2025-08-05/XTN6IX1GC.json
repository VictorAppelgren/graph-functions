  "content": "The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics \u2014 strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. HNI Corp (Symbol: HNI) presently has an excellent rank, in the top 25% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most \"interesting\" ideas that merit further research by investors.\n\nBut making HNI Corp an even more interesting and timely stock to look at, is the fact that in trading on Wednesday, shares of HNI entered into oversold territory, changing hands as low as $48.40 per share. We define oversold territory using the Relative Strength Index, or RSI, which is a technical analysis indicator used to measure momentum on a scale of zero to 100. A stock is considered to be oversold if the RSI reading falls below 30. In the case of HNI Corp, the RSI reading has hit 28.3 \u2014 by comparison, the universe of dividend stocks covered by Dividend Channel currently has an average RSI of 43.9. A falling stock price \u2014 all else being equal \u2014 creates a better opportunity for dividend investors to capture a higher yield. Indeed, HNI's recent annualized dividend of 1.32/share (currently paid in quarterly installments) works out to an annual yield of 2.65% based upon the recent $49.74 share price.\n\nA bullish investor could look at HNI's 28.3 RSI reading today as a sign that the recent heavy selling is in the process of exhausting itself, and begin to look for entry point opportunities on the buy side. Among the fundamental datapoints dividend investors should investigate to decide if they are bullish on HNI is its dividend history. In general, dividends are not always predictable; but, looking at the history chart below can help in judging whether the most recent dividend is likely to continue.\n\nClick here to find out what 9 other oversold dividend stocks you need to know about \u00bb",

      "text": "The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. is a diversified financial company. Co. is engaged in retail banking, including residential mortgage, corporate and institutional banking and asset management, providing many of its products and services nationally. Co.'s retail branch network is located coast-to-coast. Co. has three segments: Retail Banking, Corporate & Institutional Banking, and Asset Management Group. Retail Banking provides deposit, lending, brokerage, insurance services, investment management and cash management products and services to consumer and small business customers.\nWhen researching a stock like PNC Financial Services Group, many investors are the most familiar with Fundamental Analysis \u2014 looking at a company's balance sheet, earnings, revenues, and what's happening in that company's underlying business. Investors who use Fundamental Analysis to identify good stocks to buy or sell can also benefit from PNC Technical Analysis to help find a good entry or exit point. Technical Analysis is blind to the fundamentals and looks only at the trading data for PNC stock \u2014 the real life supply and demand for the stock over time \u2014 and examines that data in different ways. One of those ways is to calculate a Simpe Moving Average (\"SMA\") by looking back a certain number of days. One of the most popular \"longer look-backs\" is the PNC 200 day moving average (\"PNC 200 DMA\"), while one of the most popular \"shorter look-backs\" is the PNC 50 day moving average (\"PNC 50 DMA\"). A chart showing both of these popular moving averages is shown on this page for PNC Financial Services Group. Comparing two moving averages against each other can be a useful visualization tool: by calculating the difference between the PNC 200 DMA and the PNC 50 DMA, we get a moving average convergence divergence indicator (\"PNC MACD\"). The PNC MACD chart, in conjunction with the chart of the moving averages, basically helps in visualizing how the moving averages are showing convergence (moving closer together), or divergence (moving farther apart). |"
