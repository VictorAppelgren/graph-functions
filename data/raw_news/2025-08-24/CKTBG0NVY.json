  "description": "Target Corp. named veteran Michael Fiddelke as its next chief executive officer, betting that the insider will revive the storied retailer struggling with weak sales.",
  "content": "Target Corp. named veteran Michael Fiddelke as its next chief executive officer, betting that the insider will revive the storied retailer struggling with weak sales.\n\nThe company said Wednesday the board unanimously elected Fiddelke, who currently serves as chief operating officer, to be CEO starting in February. He will also join Target\u2019s board, while current CEO Brian Cornell, who has led the big-box retailer since 2014, will transition to focus on his role as executive chair.\n\nTarget shares slumped after the announcement, an indication that Wall Street had been hoping for an outsider to take over the company\u2019s leadership.\n\nFiddelke, who started as an intern at Target in 2003, faces the immediate challenge of reversing an extended streak of weak performance and the loss of market share to competitors such as Walmart Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. His priorities include sharpening the company\u2019s focus on merchandise style and design while improving the shopper experience and streamlining operations with technology.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m stepping in with urgency to rebuild momentum and return to profitable growth,\u201d Fiddelke, 49, said on a call with reporters. \u201cI\u2019ve seen us at our best and I\u2019ve seen us when we are not at our best, and that informs my candid assessment of today where we have work to do.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s slump persisted in fiscal second quarter ended Aug. 2 with contractions in revenue and comparable-store sales, which measures results at locations open for more than 13 months. Both declines were less than the market expected, however, according to the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nFiddelke said recent efforts appear to be paying off. These include an initiative dubbed \u201cFun 101,\u201d which seeks to capitalize on the latest trends for products including sporting goods and electronics.\n\nWhile performance improved across all six of the company\u2019s product categories in the quarter, executives said consumers remain selective in their spending. Target maintained its full-year guidance.\n\nBloomberg Intelligence analyst Jennifer Bartashus wrote Wednesday that the rising CEO seems \u201cunlikely\u201d to change Target\u2019s turnaround playbook. While sales improvement is positive, the company needs to show a \u201cprolonged\u201d trend of improvement, she said.\n\nTarget said the board considered internal and external candidates for multiple years as part of its succession plan. With Fiddelke, the company is going back to promoting an internal executive as the top boss.\n\nHe had been seen as a potential successor to Cornell, along with Christina Hennington, who is leaving the company next month. Earlier this year, Fiddelke was also picked to lead a new initiative aiming to accelerate decision making.\n\nCornell, who joined as Target\u2019s first outside CEO from PepsiCo Inc., led the company through a recovery following its massive credit card breach. Target also exited its Canada business, an expensive endeavor that cost the retailer billions of dollars, early in his tenure.\n\nThe former Walmart and Safeway executive narrowed the retailer\u2019s focus to a handful of product categories like fashion, furniture and children products, while expanding store brands. Target opened more small-format stores in urban markets, though it\u2019s now reversing its focus back to larger locations.\n\nThe company previously said in 2022 that Cornell would stay as CEO for three additional years.\n\nUnder his leadership, Target\u2019s shares have gained 80% through Tuesday\u2019s close. That lags the roughly 230% advance of the S&P 500 Index over the same period. The stock soared during the pandemic years, when consumers stocked up on discretionary goods instead of spending on travel and experiences, but it has steadily declined since 2021 as spending patterns normalized.\n\nFiddelke\u2019s path to the top has touched nearly all of the company\u2019s operations, with roles in finance, store operations and merchandising. Prior to his current role as COO, which he assumed in February 2024, he was CFO for five years. As COO, Fiddelke has overseen the running of Target\u2019s nearly 2,000 stores as well as its global supply chain and enterprise operations.\n\nNew US tariffs under President Donald Trump have emerged as an obstacle to the company\u2019s turnaround. Target is estimated to have more exposure to tariffs than peers such as Walmart due to its mix of products. Price increases related to the levies have started to materialize on some products. The impact on consumers is expected to become more pronounced later in the year as companies\u2019 existing inventory is depleted.\n\nTarget is continuing to diversify its sourcing countries and work with suppliers to mitigate the tariffs, executives said in the recent call with reporters. Price increases will be a last resort, they said.\n\nEarlier this year, Target also announced it was pulling back on diversity initiatives as conservatives challenged the programs\u2019 legality following a Supreme Court decision to ban affirmative action in college admissions in 2023. While other companies have also curtailed their diversity programs, Target has been hit especially hard by consumer blowback since the company had made inclusivity a pillar of its corporate identity. In particular, Black shoppers have been vocal about boycotting Target, pointing to the retailer\u2019s historic support of the Black community and brands.\n\nTarget has said such calls have hurt sales, but that it\u2019s difficult to decipher by how much. Sales growth has bounced back since hitting a low earlier this year, according to Bloomberg Second Measure, which tracks debit and credit purchases, suggesting that the company is moving past the impact of boycotts.",

She was the lead reporter for The Times\u2019 coverage of the deadly \u201cRust\u201d shooting on a New Mexico film set in 2021, work recognized by the Pulitzer Prize board as a finalist in breaking news. A member of the Company Town team for two decades, James specializes in covering television, corporate media and investigative projects. She previously wrote for the Miami Herald and the Palm Beach Post. A native of Wyoming, she is a graduate of the University of Colorado and Columbia University.\n- Share via\n1\nWalt Disney Co.\u2019s bombshell news Sunday night that Bob Iger would return as chief executive sent shock waves throughout the Burbank entertainment giant, Hollywood and Wall Street.\nCEO Bob Chapek was bounced after nearly three years in the top job but less than a year after he ran the company solo. Now, his mentor is returning to the helm for two years to refocus the company on growth and to find a successor \u2014 an important mission that Disney has long struggled to get right.\nIn a seismic shock to Hollywood, former longtime Disney chief Robert Iger will return to lead the entertainment giant, the Disney board announced Sunday night.\nChapek\u2019s firing rattled some within the company, but those on the creative side were elated. Most expect Iger\u2019s first move will be to dismantle the controversial organizational structure that Chapek designed two years ago. Here are the prominent players, and by Monday afternoon, one major executive was out.\nBob Chapek, ex-CEO of Walt Disney Co.\nDisney\u2019s board lost confidence in Chapek just five months after extending his contract as CEO and lauding his management style. But insiders say that Chapek\u2019s financial-focused management style, a disastrous reorganization and a series of communications blunders proved to be his undoing.\nThey point to a call with Wall Street analysts earlier this month as the final straw. Chapek praised the company before it released underwhelming results and Wall Street responded with a sell-off. Disney fell short of expectations for profit and revenue in key segments but also warned that growth to the Disney+ streaming service could stall.\nSome insiders also questioned whether Chapek truly understood what made Disney special, citing a comment he made during an investor conference last month which seemed to be dismissive of the company\u2019s legacy in animation.\nBob Iger, newly appointed CEO of Walt Disney Co.\nThe company\u2019s charismatic leader of 15 years returns to Burbank to unwind the damage, boost morale and reassure Wall Street that Disney\u2019s strategy is to return to growth and not rely on cost-cutting to improve its financial fortunes. The board made it clear that Iger\u2019s mandate was also to find a successor \u2014 a challenge that has dogged Iger for years, only to see possible successors struggle to break out of his long shadow and leave the company.\nKareem Daniel, chairman of Disney media and entertainment distribution\nIt didn\u2019t take Iger long to resolve swirling questions over whether Daniel, who was Chapek\u2019s right-hand man, would be the next to go.\nTwo years ago, Chapek entrusted the former consumer products chief with one of the most powerful jobs in the company \u2014 chairman of Disney media and entertainment distribution. Daniel gained oversight of the company\u2019s global strategy for its streaming service, Disney+, Hulu and ESPN. But on Monday, Iger announced that Daniel had left the company.\nHe also oversaw programmers\u2019 budgets, which gave Daniel unprecedented latitude to help decide how Disney would spend its more than $32 billion annual content budget. The structure caused tensions because it took responsibility away from the entertainment division leaders, who had long had the power to make such key decisions about programs and budgets for the ABC network and the studios. He was also put in charge of global strategy for the company\u2019s streaming services.\nIger\u2019s first move is expected to be reversing that structure, according to knowledgeable sources, eliminating much of the power that Daniel currently has.\n\u201cOver the coming weeks, we will begin implementing organizational and operating changes within the company,\u201d Iger said in an email to staff. \u201cIt is my intention to restructure things in a way that honors and respects creativity as the heart and soul of who we are.\u201d\nDana Walden, chairwoman of Disney General Entertainment Content\nIn June, following the Peter Rice ouster, Walden took command over Disney\u2019s vast television entertainment content-producing units, which makes her one of the most important executives at the company.\nShe oversees the creation of original entertainment and news programming for the company\u2019s streaming platforms, Disney+, Hulu and Star, and its broadcast and cable networks. Her portfolio includes ABC Entertainment, ABC News, Disney Branded Television, Freeform, FX, Hulu Originals and National Geographic as well as Disney\u2019s television studios.\nWalden, who spent 25 years at 20th Century Fox Television and the Fox network, is known for her deft touch handling high-profile content creators and other talent. A former communications executive, Walden has an intrinsic feel for communications, marketing and brand strategy \u2014 areas where Chapek fell short. Walden\u2019s strong working relationship with Iger makes her a front runner to succeed him in two years.\nPeter Rice, former chairman, Walt Disney Television, and co-chair, Disney Media Networks\nChapek in June famously fired the British executive who came to Disney as part of the 2019 Fox acquisition, saying that Rice wasn\u2019t a good fit for the company\u2019s culture. Insiders have said that Chapek distrusted Rice, believing that the younger executive \u2014 a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Rupert Murdoch \u2014 was undermining his leadership by stealthy promoting his own credentials as a Hollywood insider who was better equipped to run Disney. (The Rice camp denied the allegations.)\nWhen Chapek was forced out on Sunday, Hollywood watchers immediately wondered if Iger would bring Rice back to fill an uber-creative role overseeing television and movies because he has experience in both.\nHowever, two Disney insiders said Monday that they doubted Rice would return because that would usurp the responsibilities of two respected high-level executives, including television chief Dana Walden, who some people believe is best positioned to succeed Iger as CEO. (Rice refused to comment.)\nJames Pitaro, chairman of entertainment and sports content.\nESPN has been a shining star in Disney\u2019s orbit for three decades. But Pitaro has his work cut out amid skyrocketing sports-rights fees, a soft advertising market and accelerating consumer cord cutting, which is shrinking Disney\u2019s longtime profit base \u2014 fees paid by cable and satellite TV operators to carry ESPN\u2019s fleet of channels.\nLast summer, an activist shareholder advocated that Disney should spin off ESPN, but later back-tracked on the suggestion.\nIger warned of a \u201cworld of hurt\u201d coming to companies that rely on linear cable channels. \u201cLinear TV and satellite is marching towards a great precipice and it will be pushed off,\u201d Iger said during Vox Media\u2019s Code Conference in Beverly Hills. Some interpreted the comments as suggesting that Disney itself might be on shaky ground.\nNow, Pitaro must help Iger navigate the uncertain and changing landscape."

      "text": "Target learns that bowing to anti-DEI backers can be costly, a lesson for those bowing to Trump\n- Share via\nHas any American company run away from a public commitment faster than Target?\nIn an Aug. 19, 2020, conference call, Target Chief Executive Brian Cornell forthrightly put his company in the forefront of the quest for racial and ethnic justice. George Floyd had been murdered by Police Officer Derek Chauvin, abetted by several other officers in Minneapolis, Target\u2019s home city, only about three months earlier. Calls for recognition of the racism exposed by the killing were still reverberating nationwide.\n\u201cOur team is passionately demanding equity and justice for our Black colleagues and guests,\u201d Cornell said. \u201cWe are united in that passion and committed ... to playing an active role in addressing the persistent racial injustices that have sparked protests around the world.\u201d\nIf the founding history of this country is any guide, those who stood up in court to vindicate constitutional rights and, by so doing, served to promote the rule of law, will be the models lauded when this period of American history is written.\n\u2014 Federal Judge Beryl Howell\nHe said Target would put its influence to work \u201cto determine actions and resources that will move us towards a more inclusive, equitable and just society.\u201d\nThe company ultimately committed to increase the racial diversity of its workforce and to spend billions of dollars with Black-owned suppliers.\nHow times change. This January, Target backed down. On Jan. 24 \u2014 just four days after President Trump launched his second term with a flurry of antidiversity executive orders \u2014 Target announced it was \u201cconcluding our three-year diversity, equity and inclusion goals\u201d and its \u201cRacial Equity Action and Change initiatives.\u201d (REACH was an initiative Cornell had announced in that 2020 call.)\nThe company also said it was withdrawing from \u201call external diversity-focused surveys,\u201d including a widely followed Corporate Equality index sponsored by the Human Rights Campaign, which tracks corporate policies on LGBTQ+ rights and inclusion. And it said it was \u201cevolving\u201d its \u201csupplier diversity team to \u201csupplier engagement.\u201d\nTarget may have thought it was tacking toward consumer preferences, or that DEI was a craze that had faded out.\nHiltzik: Columbia University\u2019s capitulation to Trump puts academic freedom at risk coast to coast\nAfter Trump threatened Columbia University with the loss of $400 million in federal funding, the university folded. But Trump\u2019s threat was almost surely illegal.\nBut here\u2019s the punch line: Target\u2019s sales have cratered, at least in part because consumers were angry about its reversals. The company\u2019s management has been a little vague about the impact of all this.\nAt a May 21 conference call with Wall Street analysts following its release of earnings for the first quarter ended March 31, Cornell alluded to the backlash without going into detail. He attributed the company\u2019s ugly performance \u2014 comparable-store sales down by 5.7% from a year earlier \u2014 to several factors, including \u201cthe reaction to the updates we shared ... in January.\u201d That was an obvious allusion to the dropping of DEI initiatives. But Cornell said \u201cwe can\u2019t reliably estimate the impact of each [factor] separately.\u201d\nIt\u2019s true that Target, like other big retailers, has had disappointing sales recently. In the last quarter, most have attributed any sales slump to consumer uncertainty about Trump\u2019s confusing tariff pronouncements. But the fact that Cornell felt obligated to mention the consumer reaction to Target\u2019s altered diversity policies is notable, and appears to be unique in the retail industry.\nTarget told me that it is \u201cabsolutely dedicated to fostering inclusivity for everyone \u2013 our team members, our guests and our supply partners\u201d and said it is \u201cproud of the progress we\u2019ve made since 2020.\u201d\nBut since Target had given its commitment to diversity a central role in its corporate persona, it\u2019s proper to take a closer look \u2014 not only at the company\u2019s experience, but also the course of corporate antidiscrimination policies more generally.\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that Target isn\u2019t the first institution to discover that abandoning principle isn\u2019t a sure path to material success or public esteem. That\u2019s been the experience of big law firms and major universities that kowtowed to Trump in his anti-DEI drive this year.\nSeveral major firms that were threatened with or hit with White House sanctions made deals with Trump that included confessing to misbehavior that may not even have occurred and committing to hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of pro bono work that may be dictated by Trump \u2014 a departure from pro bono tradition, which typically means providing underserved groups or individuals with free legal representation.\nWalmart, Ford and John Deere have scaled back their DEI efforts under conservative pressure, but Costco is resisting.\nThe firms may have thought that meeting Trump\u2019s terms would be the best way to keep clients who might have been rattled by Trump\u2019s attacks on their lawyers. As it happens, some clients have fled anyway, possibly concluding that big firms that won\u2019t fight Trump might not defend them aggressively against other adversaries. Some also have lost lawyers, dismayed by the pusillanimous behavior of their leaders.\nIt turns out that law firms that have steadfastly rejected Trump\u2019s threats have been winning in their lawsuits against the White House\u2019s allegedly illegal and unconstitutional threats and sanctions. Federal judges have granted the firms Jenner & Block, WilmerHale and Susman Godfrey temporary restraining orders against Trump\u2019s sanctions. Federal Judge Beryl Howell of Washington, D.C., ruled Trump\u2019s executive order targeting the firm Perkins Coie unconstitutional and granted the firm summary judgment against the government.\nHowell went further, taking a swipe at the firms that had capitulated to Trump. \u201cIf the founding history of this country is any guide,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthose who stood up in court to vindicate constitutional rights and, by so doing, served to promote the rule of law, will be the models lauded when this period of American history is written.\u201d\nUniversities such as Columbia are also discovering that the Trump administration has trouble taking \u201cyes\u201d for an answer. Columbia publicly bent its knee to Trump in March, but that didn\u2019t save it from being hit with more sanctions from the White House last week over its supposed violations of civil rights law through purported \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d toward harassment of Jewish students.\nThat brings us to the capitulation of American corporations to the partisan, ideological assault on diversity, equity and inclusion, and specifically to the fix Target is in.\nRick DeSantis and other conservatives are crowing about having killed off \u201cwoke\u201d policies. But their celebration is way premature.\nI\u2019ve written before about how corporate America is a thin reed to lean on as a counterforce to assaults from the political right wing on voting rights, women\u2019s access to reproductive healthcare and democracy itself.\nMany companies that once expressed a commitment to end or at least review their contributions to the 147 Republicans who voted against certifying the 2020 election soon resumed their contributions. Some made similar promises to oppose state laws restricting abortion or voting rights, or talked openly about reducing their activities in states enacting such measures.\nFor the most part, these pledges have been all talk, no action. When Republicans campaigned against \u201cwoke\u201d policies or DEI \u2014 an abbreviation that had the virtue for the GOP of being vague enough to serve as an all-purpose slogan for conservatives \u2014 Walmart, Ford, Anheuser-Busch and John Deere, among other companies, rolled back their initiatives.\nOne of the exceptions to take a strong stand on behalf of DEI is Costco Wholesale. In a response to a shareholder resolution proposed by the right-wing National Center for Public Policy Research insinuating that Costco\u2019s DEI program \u201cholds litigation, reputational and financial risks to the Company,\u201d Costco management reiterated its commitment to DEI. \u201cOur efforts at diversity, equity and inclusion remind and reinforce with everyone at our Company the importance of creating opportunities for all. We believe that these efforts enhance our capacity to attract and retain employees who will help our business succeed.\u201d\nThe anti-DEI resolution was rejected by 98% of shareholders voting.\nTarget seemed well placed to be another exception. It\u2019s one of America\u2019s biggest retailers, with more than $100 billion in annual sales. Early in 2023, Cornell boasted that \u201cour long-standing commitment to diversity, and equity, and inclusion ... has fueled much of our growth over the last nine years.\u201d In 2022, in fact, Target published a scorecard of its DEI progress\u2014a 33% increase in corporate officers of color, 62% increase in promotions for people of color, spending of $1.78 billion with \u201cdiverse suppliers,\u201d and so on. \u201cWe are never done,\u201d it pledged.\nAbout two weeks after Cornell\u2019s 2023 boast, the company capitulated to what I labeled a \u201cbraying mob of anti-LGBTQ+ reactionaries\u201d that had targeted Target during Pride Month, a celebration of LGBTQ+ communities every June.\nWhen anti-LGBTQ+ activists went after Target for selling Pride merchandise, they guessed the company would cave. They were right.\nEven though the company\u2019s stores had featured Pride-related merchandise for years, in 2023 it told personnel in many stores to reduce or even eliminate their Pride-themed displays or move the merchandise to less conspicuous sections of the stores. Some LGBTQ+ designers reported that their products have been taken off the shelves.\nThis year\u2019s retreat from DEI policies is merely a continuation of that craven approach. It has supplanted its straightforward commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, as Cornell expressed it in 2020, with a steamy helping of corporate-speak mush.\n\u201cBelonging for all is an essential part of our team and culture, helping fuel consumer relevance and business results,\u201d the company said in a publicly issued \u201cfact sheet\u201d in January. \u201cWe aim to create joyful experiences through an assortment of products and services that help all guests feel seen and celebrated, increasing relevance with consumers... . We build deep and lasting relationships with the communities we serve, driving impact, economic vitality and connection that fuels loyalty.\u201d\nThe communities most affected by the pullback didn\u2019t buy into these vague promises. Black pastors and others launched boycotts of the company; judging from Cornell\u2019s pained observation to the Wall Street analysts last week, the boycotts may have had an effect. Whether Target continues to see a slide in sales because of customer discontent isn\u2019t clear at this moment, and it\u2019s certainly possible that consumer concerns about Trump\u2019s tariffs and their consequent upward pressure on prices will wreak the most damage.\nBut this is a lesson on the shallowness of corporate character. Trump, it has become evident, is himself all talk, no action. He doesn\u2019t have the legal power to end DEI initiatives at private businesses, and the cadre of followers who respond to his culture warfare may be nowhere as large as they think they are. But that only makes the faintheartedness of corporate America all the more dispiriting.\nMore to Read\nInsights\nL.A.

      "text": "Jeff Bezos, Amazon\u2019s founder, will step down as CEO\n- Share via\nNEW YORK \u2014 Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon as an online bookstore and built it into a shopping and entertainment behemoth, will step down later this year as chief executive, a role he\u2019s had for nearly 30 years, to become executive chairman, the company announced Tuesday.\nBezos, 57, will be replaced in the fall by Andy Jassy, who runs Amazon\u2019s cloud-computing business.\nAmazon\u2019s settlement with the FTC comes nearly two years after the Los Angeles Times first exposed its tip-withholding practices.\nIn a blog post to employees, Bezos said he plans to focus on new products and early initiatives being developed at Amazon. He said he would have more time for side projects, including his space exploration company Blue Origin, his philanthropic initiatives and overseeing the Washington Post, which he owns.\nBezos, who is the company\u2019s biggest shareholder, will still have broad influence over Amazon.\n\u201cJeff is really not going anywhere,\u201d Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said in a call with reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s more of a restructuring of who\u2019s doing what.\u201d\nAmazon is one of the last of the biggest tech giants to have a founder as CEO. Google\u2019s co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, relinquished their executive positions in parent company Alphabet in 2019. Oracle\u2019s Larry Ellison stepped down as CEO in 2014. Bill Gates was Microsoft\u2019s CEO until 2000, kept a day-to-day role at the company until 2008 and served as its chairman until 2014. Gates left the board entirely last year to focus on philanthropy.\nLaunched in 1995, Amazon was a pioneer of fast and free shipping that won over millions of shoppers who used the site to buy diapers, TVs and just about anything. Under Bezos, Amazon also launched the first e-reader that gained mass acceptance, and its Echo listening device made voice assistants a more common sight in living rooms.\nAs a child, Bezos was intrigued by computers and interested in building things, such as alarms he rigged in his parents\u2019 home. He got a degree in electrical engineering and computer science at Princeton University, and then worked at several Wall Street companies.\nHe quit his job at D.E. Shaw to start an online retail business \u2014 though at first he wasn\u2019t sure what to sell. Bezos quickly determined that an online bookstore would resonate with consumers. He and his wife, MacKenzie Scott, whom he met at D.E. Shaw and married in 1993, set out on a road trip to Seattle \u2014 a city chosen for its abundance of tech talent and proximity to a large book distributor in Roseburg, Ore.\nWhile Scott drove, Bezos wrote up the business plan for what would become Amazon.com. Bezos persuaded his parents and some friends to invest in the idea, and Amazon began operating out of the couple\u2019s Seattle garage on July 16, 1995.\nAmazon has gone far beyond selling paperbacks. It now produces movies, makes sofas, owns a grocery chain and even has plans to send satellites into space to beam internet service to Earth. The company is one of the most valuable in the world, worth nearly $1.7 trillion.\nDuring the pandemic, Amazon was one of the few retailers to benefit as shoppers stayed clear of malls and shopped from their phones and computers. On the same day Amazon announced Bezos would step down, the company reported making a record profit in the last three months of 2020, and its quarterly revenue shot past $100 billion for the first time.\nBezos\u2019 riches have also swelled: His stake in Amazon is worth about $180 billion, making him one of the world\u2019s richest people. For years he stayed behind the scenes, running the company. More recently, he sometimes stepped into the spotlight, showing up at movie premieres and Hollywood parties. In November, he announced a $10-billion program of donations aimed at combating climate change.\nIn 2019, he announced he was divorcing Scott in a tweet, just before the National Enquirer published a cover story saying Bezos had an affair with a former TV host. Scott received a stake in Amazon after the divorce worth nearly $40 billion at the time. She has also become a leading philanthropist, giving away $4.2 billion to food banks and other organizations in a four-month period last year. She has pledged to give half her fortune to charities.\nAs Amazon has grown, so has scrutiny. Amazon and other tech giants have enjoyed light-touch regulation and star status in Washington for decades, but calls for greater regulation are growing. A report by the House Judiciary Committee in October called for possibly breaking up Amazon and others, making it harder for them to acquire companies and imposing new rules to safeguard competition.\nJassy, Bezos\u2019 replacement, is a longtime Amazon executive, having worked at the company since 1997. The cloud-computing business he runs powers video-streaming site Netflix and many other companies, and it has become Amazon\u2019s most profitable business.\n\u201cHe\u2019s deeply steeped in technology and a very seasoned executive in his own right,\u201d Gartner analyst Ed Anderson said.\nBut he will also face many challenges.\n\u201cAmazon\u2019s size makes some industries uncomfortable, some governments uncomfortable, and Andy Jassy will have to deal with the consequences,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThat will be some of the new era of his leadership.\u201d"

  "argos_summary": "Target Corp. has named veteran Michael Fiddelke as its new CEO, a move that saw shares dip as investors had hoped for an outsider; Fiddelke will focus on reviving sales, sharpening merchandise, improving the shopper experience, and navigating tariff pressures while addressing backlash over the company\u2019s recent rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.  Disney\u2019s board has reinstated former CEO Bob Iger to replace Bob Chapek, with Iger expected to dismantle Chapek\u2019s controversial reorganization and steer the company toward growth.  Target\u2019s retreat from DEI programs has sparked boycotts and a 5.7% decline in comparable\u2011store sales, illustrating the commercial cost of capitulating to political pressure.  Meanwhile, Amazon announced that founder Jeff Bezos will step down as CEO later this year, passing the role to long\u2011time executive Andy Jassy as Bezos shifts to executive chairman and focuses on new ventures.",
