  "title": "Micah Parsons\u2019 agent details his view of contract negotiations with Cowboys, Jerry Jones",
  "description": "'At no point did Micah believe that he was negotiating a contract,' Parsons' agent, David Mulugheta, said Tuesday on ESPN's 'First Take.'",
  "content": "Dallas Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones voiced his side of the story during contract negotiations with former Cowboys pass rusher Micah Parsons. Now, after Parsons was traded to the Green Bay Packers last week and received a monster contract extension, Parsons\u2019 agent, David Mulugheta, is sharing his side of what transpired.\n\nMulugheta joined ESPN\u2019s \u201cFirst Take\u201d on Tuesday morning to discuss the negotiations with the Dallas front office.\n\n\u201cI think the most important thing is that Micah wanted to be a Cowboy,\u201d said Mulugheta, president of team sports at Athletes First. \u201cHe grew up cheering for the Cowboys, wore the blue and white at Penn State, wore it in the NFL with the Dallas Cowboys. He wanted to be a Cowboy. We did everything we could for him to remain a Cowboy.\u201d\n\nMulugheta said his agency typically prefers to keep negotiation discussions out of the media spotlight. But Athletes First believed some things deserved clarification after so much information about this one became public.\n\n\u201cIf you look at many of these contracts that the Cowboys have done over the past few years, and the recent ones, the guarantees don\u2019t stretch much further than the first new year,\u201d Mulugheta said. \u201cIf you look at Micah\u2019s current deal, he has guarantees into four years from now. So again, there are certain things that have been put out in the media to make it look as though Micah turned down a fair or a great deal, but that\u2019s simply not the case.\u201d\n\nArguably the biggest point in question was Jones\u2019 claim that he had offered Parsons a deal in March that would make him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a loaded question,\u201d Mulugheta said. \u201cFrom an APY (average per year) standpoint, if you\u2019re just looking at the average that was offered to him, I believe it was $40.5 million was the offer, which would have made him, at the time, from an APY standpoint, the highest paid. That being said, the way the cash flow was structured, over his first three new years, he would not be paid as the highest-paid (non-quarterback) player in the NFL.\n\n\u201cAgain, that\u2019s why I say, the devil\u2019s in the details. Another important part of the contract was a four-year deal versus a five-year deal. When you look at that, that fifth new year can be a difference of $30 million or $40 million for the player. If you look at where the pass-rusher market was a year ago, it was at $35 million or so with Nick Bosa. Now, it\u2019s at $47 million in one year with Micah Parsons. Four years from now, where do you think that number is? It\u2019s probably closer to $65 million or $70 million per year, and if we lock in that fifth year, currently at $40 million, just that year alone is worth an additional $30 million to Micah, if not more.\u201d\n\nMulugheta said the difference between the deal the Cowboys had offered versus what Parsons got from the Packers could be a difference upwards of $60 million, when it\u2019s all said and done.\n\nAnother thing that was murky \u2014 with only one side of the story \u2014 was the meeting that took place between Jones and Parsons. Jones said that meeting is where a contract was agreed upon. In his public statement requesting a trade on Aug. 1, Parsons addressed that point briefly, saying that the meeting was advertised to him as a conversation about leadership, not a contract negotiation.\n\n\u201cAs far as Micah was concerned, he was out of the country,\u201d Mulugheta said. \u201cHe got a call from Jerry\u2019s assistant and was asked to come in to meet about leadership. So, when he got back from his vacation, he came in and he gave him a call and said that he was back and he was ready to meet. At some point during that meeting that was represented to him (as one that) was going to be about leadership, it turned into contract talk.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a 25-year-old football player and your boss who happens to be the most powerful person in the NFL starts talking about contracts, it\u2019s hard for you to end that conversation. So, they had a conversation, Micah nodded his head out of respect. Obviously, there\u2019s a power dynamic that\u2019s a little different there. One guy is the owner of the team, and the GM, and the other one is Micah Parsons, who is a young, 25-year-old football player. I\u2019m not sure if there was a miscommunication there by the time Micah walked out, but at no point did Micah believe that he was negotiating a contract.\u201d\n\nAt one point, Jones made a comment that when the Cowboys tried to send Mulugheta a completed contract, Mulugheta told the Cowboys to \u201cstick it up their ass.\u201d Mulugheta said that terminology wasn\u2019t used and clarified how it went from their side.\n\n\u201cIt was a misrepresentation of what I said,\u201d Mulugheta said. \u201cWhat I did tell them was if they believed that the contract was already finalized and they were sending it over to me to be rubber stamped, then they probably shouldn\u2019t send it over.\u201d\n\nAfter the messy nature of the negotiations, there were questions about how this may impact future negotiations between other Mulugheta clients and the Cowboys. That client list includes receiver George Pickens, who the Cowboys traded for this offseason and is entering the final year of his rookie deal.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing personal here,\u201d Mulugheta said. \u201cIt\u2019s a business transaction as far as the contract is concerned. If George Pickens does what we expect him to do, which is be one of the best receivers in the NFL this year, we\u2019ll have those conversations with the Cowboys. And if they\u2019re open to having that dialogue with us, and negotiating a long-term deal, then we\u2019d love for George Pickens to be a star with a star on his helmet. But if that\u2019s not the case, then obviously we\u2019ll see what else is out there for him. But again, this is not going to affect any negotiations moving forward for us.\u201d\n\nMulugheta also said that Parsons did not intend to sit out games this season, if an extension wasn\u2019t reached and Parsons had to play on the fifth-year option. Mulugheta said Parsons\u2019 back injury is a legitimate ailment for which he\u2019s taking medicine for \u2014 not a cover for a contract dispute \u2014 and he intended to get it further examined and play when the season began.\n\n\u201cMicah loves the game too much,\u201d Mulugheta said. \u201cHe was going to play no matter what. \u2026 He had a real injury, but at no point did he plan on that keeping him off the field. The Cowboys were never told that he would not play. He always intended to play football. He was going to be on the field Thursday to play against the (Philadelphia) Eagles.\u201d\n\nOne of the main things that led to the divorce between the Cowboys and Parsons was how the two sides viewed the March meeting between Parsons and Jones. Jones viewed it as a contract negotiation while Parsons and his camp did not.\n\n\u201cTo expect somebody like Micah Parsons to be one of the best defenders in the NFL, and also a great lawyer when it comes to contracts, I think is a bit unfair,\u201d Mulugheta said. \u201cHis job is to go out there and chase quarterbacks and our job is to go out there and chase commas for him. So, I\u2019m not sure exactly why it went this way, but we were always prepared and open to negotiate a contract with the Jones family.\u201d",

      "text": "Dallas Cowboys coach Brian Schottenheimer said Wednesday he\u2019s confident Micah Parsons will be on the field Week 1 against the Philadelphia Eagles. Judging by Jerry Jones\u2019 comments Thursday, there\u2019s a good chance that\u2019s without a new contract.\nWhile joining former Cowboys star wide receiver Michael Irvin on his YouTube channel, the Cowboys owner and general manager sounded completely committed to not renegotiating what he believes was already negotiated in March with Parsons. Jones said the offer would have made the All-Pro pass rusher the NFL\u2019s highest-paid non-quarterback in guaranteed money.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cThe world would know that I want Micah if they knew what I had offered him,\u201d Jones told Irvin. \u201cAnd he knows what I offered him.\u201d\nJones and Parsons met in March and negotiated without Parsons\u2019 agent, David Mulugheta, being present. Jones said Thursday that when they sent the contract details over, \u201cthe agent told us to stick it up our ass.\u201d\nParsons, who requested a trade Aug. 1, is entering the fifth and final year of his rookie deal. His 2025 salary is just over $24 million. The NFL\u2019s highest-paid non-quarterback in terms of average annual value is Pittsburgh Steelers pass rusher T.J. Watt at $41 million per year. Last month, he signed a three-year, $123 million contract extension with $108 million guaranteed, the most guaranteed money by a non-quarterback.\nWhen Parsons posted his trade request on X, his statement said, \u201cI no longer want to be held to close door negotiations without my agent present.\u201d Parsons included details about the March meeting, writing that it was about leadership. \u201cSomehow the conversation turned into him talking contract with me,\u201d Parsons added. \u201cYes I engaged in a back and forth in regards to what I wanted from my contract, but at no point did I believe this was supposed to be a formal negotiation and I informed Mr. Jones afterward my agent would reach out thinking this would get things done.\u201d\nJones continued to explain Thursday that Parsons is under contract for this season and the Cowboys can franchise tag him the next two seasons. The franchise tag number for a defensive end this season is $22 million. According to Over the Cap, the projected franchise tag number for a defensive end next season will be a little over $26.5 million.\n\u201cWe really got three years to work this thing out,\u201d Jones said, before explaining how he did the same thing with franchise quarterback Dak Prescott, who is the NFL\u2019s highest-paid player at $60 million per season. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t agree so Dak played the last year of his contract and then we franchised him. It\u2019s exactly what happened with Dak, so we moved forward and ultimately we got a contract, made Dak the highest-paid player in the NFL. So the precedent is handling it like Dak.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cBut in this particular case, then Micah comes in and plays this year under his contract. If he doesn\u2019t, then it\u2019s very costly, very costly for everybody.\u201d\nAfter Jones\u2019 comments emerged Thursday, Parsons removed all references to the Cowboys from his social media. He then posted a video on TikTok showing him waving goodbye, with audio from former NBA star Allen Iverson saying, \u201cImma win wherever I go. Wherever I go, imma win. I don\u2019t care where I go.\u201d\nParsons has been attending training camp practices, taking part in the walk-through portions and meetings. But he has not been practicing. It remains to be seen whether that will change next week as the Cowboys begin preparation for their season opener at the Philadelphia Eagles on Sept. 4.\nMicah Parsons is here pic.twitter.com/HLOZO4t6g8\n\u2014 Jon Machota (@jonmachota) August 20, 2025\nIt\u2019s unrealistic to expect a deal to get done without Jones and Mulugheta talking. That hasn\u2019t happened to this point. And judging by Jones\u2019 comments Thursday, it doesn\u2019t sound like he will be the one making the first call.\n\u201cMicah and I talked (in March) and then we were going to send it over to the agent,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe had our agreements on terms, amount, guarantees, everything. We were going to send it over to the agent, and the agent said don\u2019t bother because we have all that to negotiate. Well, I had already negotiated. I already moved off my mark in several areas. So the issue, very frankly, is we\u2019ve had the negotiation in my mind. And the agent is trying to get his nose in it right now and try to come in there and improve off the mark that we had already set.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got this deal resolved in my mind, for the Dallas Cowboys. We\u2019ve got it done. And if the agent wants to finish up the details, which he should, and do all the paperwork, he can do that. And we\u2019re ready to go. But as far as the amount of money, the years, the guarantees, all of that, we\u2019ve negotiated that.\u201d\nJerry Jones when asked on @FoxNews about how close the Cowboys are to getting a deal done with Micah Parsons pic.twitter.com/ckmJ9FqIJv\n\u2014 Jon Machota (@jonmachota) August 21, 2025\n(Photo: Stacy Revere / Getty Images)"

      "text": "FRISCO, Texas \u2014 The Dallas Cowboys traded star pass rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers on Thursday for defensive tackle Kenny Clark and first-round draft picks in 2026 and 2027 from Green Bay.\nParsons had been embroiled in a contract dispute with the Cowboys this offseason. While he attended the team\u2019s training camp in Oxnard, Calif., he did not practice and the more camp went on, the more contentious things got between him and owner/GM Jerry Jones. Parsons requested to be traded Aug. 1, but that didn\u2019t feel like a real option. Until it was \u2026 Thursday.\nAdvertisement\nSo why did Jones make the move?\n\u201cWithout being too broad, obviously, we did think it was in the best interest of our organization. Not only the future but right now this season, as well. We gained a Pro Bowl player in an area we had big concerns in on the inside of our defense,\u201d Jones said.\nThen Jones got more to the point of the matter.\n\u201cLet me go beyond your question. First of all, I want to tell you, I really like Micah. I appreciate the four years that we\u2019ve had him here. He\u2019s a great player. We are very appreciative of the fact that he\u2019s a great player. There\u2019s no question that I could have signed him in April. So we all know to have agreements, all parties have to agree, but this was by design. I did make Micah an offer. It wasn\u2019t acceptable, and I honored the fact that it wasn\u2019t done in the way that he wanted to do it through an agent. So he was made an offer. There\u2019s not an ounce of vindictiveness. There\u2019s no bad feelings on my part about the fact that we didn\u2019t come together on an agreement.\u201d\nJerry Jones said the requirement in trade offers for Micah Parsons was that they had to get a top defensive tackle in return pic.twitter.com/g7HRJePsgL\n\u2014 Jon Machota (@jonmachota) August 28, 2025\nJones discussed the offer he made to Parsons in April.\n\u201cWhen I offered Micah the contract that I offered him back in April, he flew in from out of the country,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe wanted to come right in, I said, no, get you a night\u2019s sleep and come on in the next day. When I did that, we offered him a contract to come play for the Dallas Cowboys and it was a good one. OK? It was more guaranteed than what\u2019s here now (that\u2019s) been reported. My point is, without getting into detail, that was a very genuine negotiation. We changed the amounts and then we left, and then he called back and talked to Stephen \u2014 Stephen negotiated amounts. We changed those amounts that he called back from.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cOf course, the rest is history when the time came to say, \u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d then he said, \u2018Let\u2019s start the negotiation.\u2019 Again, nothing in the world am I criticizing Micah about at all. That was every bit his right. Micah\u2019s never been anything but so pleasant for me to be around. I want to be real clear. \u2026 Things are good here.\u201d\nJones and Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones stressed the importance of adding Clark.\n\u201cWe have the highest-paid player in the NFL at quarterback, and we made that commitment last year and we\u2019re proud we made it,\u201d Jerry Jones said. \u201cIt had everything to do with this decision. Everything. It gives us every opportunity with Dak Prescott and (CeeDee) Lamb and the base that we\u2019ve got to win now. So all you need do \u2014 I\u2019m not so sure this would have been the result had we not had Dak. But the fact that we have Dak, we need to stop the run. We really do. We need to get the ball back.\u201d\n\u201cKenny Clark was a big part of this,\u201d Stephen Jones said. \u201cThat was a part of winning right now. We feel like when you look at the frustration, it\u2019s we haven\u2019t been able to win the big game in the playoffs, and we think it is a direct connection of not being able to stop the run and we think Kenny Clark is going to be a big piece to that. And we felt like, because of our depth on the edge, as well as the ability to scheme pressure, that we could make up for Micah \u2014 because obviously he\u2019s elite at rushing the passer.\u201d\n(Photo: Nick Cammett / Getty Images)"

      "text": "By Matt Schneidman, Dianna Russini and Zach Powell\nGreen Bay Packers linebacker Micah Parsons is managing a facet joint sprain in his back and may need an epidural injection to play on Sunday, a league source said.\nBefore Parsons, 26, was traded from the Dallas Cowboys to Green Bay last week, the Cowboys prescribed him a five-day plan of prednisone, a corticosteroid used to reduce inflammation around irritated nerves and tissues in his back. Dallas also had Parsons on a physical therapy program, according to the source.\nAdvertisement\nParsons is beginning his fifth season after a blockbuster trade landed him with Green Bay after a contract standoff with the Cowboys. Last week, he signed a four-year extension with the Packers worth $188 million and $136 million guaranteed. His average annual salary of $47 million makes him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history.\nThe star linebacker is practicing this week to prepare for the season opener against the Detroit Lions.\nCould Parsons miss Week 1 opener vs. Lions?\nWhile Parsons may have a legitimate back injury, he has not indicated he\u2019ll miss the Packers\u2019 Week 1 matchup. Parsons was asked during his introductory news conference on Friday about his physical condition and expectations for the season opener.\n\u201cPhysically, I\u2019m great,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cI think I can contribute a lot. I\u2019m going to team up with the doctors in creating a plan. We already talked about how we can ramp things up and get me into a flow where they feel comfortable and I feel comfortable. But my plan is to be here. They didn\u2019t give up what they gave up for me to sit on the sidelines and make this big of a risk and change for me to do that, so I\u2019m going to give them my all.\u201d\nPackers left tackle Rasheed Walker, Parsons\u2019 college teammate, said after Monday\u2019s practice that Parsons took some 11-on-11 reps but looked to be a limited participant.\n\u201cHe said he was gonna be more full-go Wednesday and Thursday, so yeah, he gon\u2019 have to come see me,\u201d Walker said.\nIf Parsons is indeed a full participant on Wednesday, Thursday or even Friday, that\u2019s a telling sign he\u2019ll play in the season opener on Sunday. Maybe he won\u2019t have a typical workload after not practicing all camp and nursing a back injury, but it would be a surprise if Parsons doesn\u2019t suit up at all. \u2014 Matt Schneidman, Packers beat writer\n(Photo: Tork Mason / USA TODAY NETWORK Wisconsin)"

The Cowboys host the Packers on Sunday Night Football on Sept. 28 at AT&T Stadium.\nWe have completed a trade to receive a 2026 first-round pick, a 2027 first-round pick, and Pro Bowler DT Kenny Clark from the Packers in exchange for Micah Parsons.\n\ud83d\uddde\ufe0f: https://t.co/7Hiwb2Nilj | @blockchain pic.twitter.com/NED5bHcHYT\n\u2014 Dallas Cowboys (@dallascowboys) August 28, 2025\nWhy Packers made the bold move\nOn the eve of the 2018 NFL regular season, the Packers lost out to the Bears for Khalil Mack, whom Chicago acquired from the Raiders for a king\u2019s ransom. In his first year as general manager, Brian Gutekunst showed a willingness to take a big swing for an edge rusher in the prime of his career. Seven years later, with his job potentially on the line under new team president Ed Policy, Gutekunst pulled out his driver once again for a similar move.\nThere are two players in league history with at least 12 sacks in their first four seasons: Micah Parsons and Reggie White. White is one of six players with his number retired on the Lambeau Field facade. Parsons will now call home the same stadium that one of the best players ever did.\nWhile the Packers gave up a three-time Pro Bowler and their longest-tenured player in defensive tackle Kenny Clark, they retained their No. 1 edge rusher (now No. 2) in Rashan Gary.\nGutekunst himself said Green Bay\u2019s pass rush was too inconsistent last season. It\u2019s part of the reason head coach Matt LaFleur fired defensive line coach Jason Rebrovich and replaced him with former Patriots defensive coordinator DeMarcus Covington. LaFleur also said that before defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley\u2019s first season calling the defense last year, he envisioned the Packers generating pressure on the quarterback by rushing a traditional four (like the Eagles effectively do). Instead, the Packers weren\u2019t able to and Hafley resorted to crafting exotic pressures with linebacker Edgerrin Cooper, safety Xavier McKinney and others to cause havoc.\nAdvertisement\nNow, the Packers should have an easier time generating pressure with four and dropping the typical seven into coverage (like LaFleur wanted last year) with Parsons and Gary coming off the edge, even if losing a healthy Clark up the middle is a big blow. That means more responsibility now falls on fourth-year defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt, a 2022 first-rounder whose fifth-year option the Packers exercised in May, and 2023 Day 3 picks Karl Brooks and Colby Wooden. Two rookie defensive tackles from Georgia, sixth-rounder Warren Brinson and undrafted signing Nazir Stackhouse, also made the Packers\u2019 53-man roster. \u2014 Matt Schneidman\nA stunning decision by Cowboys, Jerry Jones\nThis is a stunning trade by the Cowboys because Jerry Jones just doesn\u2019t make these types of moves. Jones falls in love with star players and doesn\u2019t let them leave the building in their prime. The other part is that Jones has become so conservative over the last decade that everyone just assumed he\u2019d do what he\u2019s done with every other star player \u2014 eventually give them a new massive contract. But maybe his recent Netflix documentary \u201cThe Gambler\u201d got him feeling nostalgic and looking to make a big splash. This would qualify.\nJones has always wanted credit for the Herschel Walker trade. That one set up the Cowboys\u2019 dynasty run of the 1990s. Maybe that\u2019s his hope here. Two first-round picks and Clark are far from what Jones got for Walker, but it\u2019s still very bold.\nThis deal is also surprising because no team has been a bigger thorn in Jones\u2019 side over the last 15 years than the Packers. They ended the Cowboys\u2019 seasons in 2014, 2016 and 2023. Dallas\u2019 best shots at making a deep postseason run. Definitely not the team anyone thought Jones would send his team\u2019s best player. \u2014 Jon Machota\n(Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)"

      "text": "If Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones could win Super Bowls as easily as he makes himself the center of conversation, he\u2019d have more rings than fingers and toes.\nJones is the topic du jour again these days after the stunning trade of outside linebacker Micah Parsons, arguably the best defensive player in football.\nAdvertisement\nJones apparently is counting on this trade having an outcome similar to the Herschel Walker trade of 1989 that helped build a dynasty. For that to happen, the Cowboys would have to draft like coach Jimmy Johnson did in the early 1990s.\nThe move was curious because the Cowboys had considered themselves Super Bowl contenders. They received defensive tackle Kenny Clark and two first-round picks in return for Parsons, but there is no way to argue they are better today than last week. And the message the trade sent to fans and players is they should not expect the 29-year championship drought to end anytime soon. It isn\u2019t the kind of deal expected from an 82-year-old owner/general manager.\nParsons isn\u2019t the only Cowboys star whose negotiations with Jones were thorny.\n\u201cSometimes Jerry will negotiate right down to the final dime with somebody,\u201d Jones\u2019 close friend Mike McCoy said in \u201cKing of the Cowboys: The Life and Times of Jerry Jones.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the point of proving that he can win. Then he\u2019ll turn right around when the bargaining is over and he\u2019ll give something back that you\u2019ve been negotiating over for days. Sometimes it\u2019s just like a game to him.\u201d\nIn the Netflix docuseries \u201cAmerica\u2019s Team: The Gambler and His Cowboys,\u201d Jones says, \u201cWe do it our way, baby.\u201d\nAnd the Cowboys\u2019 way is different than most.\nHowever, some of it is reminiscent of the way Bears founder George Halas and Raiders owner Al Davis conducted their business.\nHalas let future Hall of Famers Bronko Nagurski, George Blanda and Mike Ditka walk away rather than pay them. Nagurski, in fact, became a pro wrestler in 1938 over a $500 difference in negotiations.\nWhen Ditka was the best tight end in the NFL in the early 1960s, Halas wouldn\u2019t give him the salary he thought he was worth, and Ditka subsequently said Halas \u201cthrew around nickels like they were manhole covers.\u201d Halas, who had survived the Great Depression by taking money out of the piggy banks of his two children, responded, \u201cThat is correct.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nDitka was traded to the Eagles.\nDavis, unlike Halas and Jones, didn\u2019t have many notable contract disputes with players. But his parsimoniousness came out in the way he paid \u2014 or didn\u2019t pay \u2014 coaches.\nBy 2002, Jon Gruden \u2014 \u201cChucky\u201d as he was known to Raiders fans \u2014 was the brightest coaching star in the NFL. In the previous four years as coach of the Raiders, his record was 40-28. If not for a playoff loss to the Patriots, partly due to the famous \u201cTuck Rule\u201d play, the Raiders would have been in the AFC Championship Game for the second straight season. Gruden\u2019s success and popularity gave him negotiating leverage for a healthy raise.\nInstead of paying him, Davis traded him to the Buccaneers, who beat the Raiders in the Super Bowl the following season.\nJones, Davis and Halas took many arrows late in their tenures. They were easy targets. Halas coached until he was 73. Jones\u2019 Cowboys are 5-13 in the postseason since their last Super Bowl, with only one of the victories coming in the last six years. In the last eight years of Davis\u2019 life, his Raiders were 54 games below .500.\nJones\u2019 legacy is fascinating. Only one active owner \u2014 Robert Kraft of the Patriots \u2014 has more Super Bowl victories, and Jones has had a massive footprint on 31 teams besides his own. But perceptions of him have been colored by the Cowboys\u2019 inability to get back to the level they were in the \u201990s. The Parsons trade undoubtedly will color those perceptions further, one way or another.\nThe problem with being an owner/GM is that the owner has one less person to blame for failures.\nThe heat serves Jones well. It gives him fuel.\nDavis was thin-skinned and barked back at anyone who took issue with his decisions. When he was an old man using a walker, he tried to physically intimidate a media critic.\nSuccess shielded Halas from criticism for much of his long career, but the wolves started howling when he couldn\u2019t get his team over the hump in the 1950s. That\u2019s when he showed his cantankerous side.\nAttention was important to all three.\nJones, unabashedly, is a promoter. \u201cThe Cowboys are a soap opera 365 days a year,\u201d he said in \u201cAmerica\u2019s Team.\u201d \u201cWhen it gets slow, I stir it up.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nIn Halas\u2019 case, he used attention to grow the league during eras when the NFL played second fiddle to Major League Baseball and college football. Halas typed press releases and personally delivered them to newsrooms.\nBeing the face of his franchise was vital for Davis. When he had to pass a billboard with head coach Gruden on it on his way to work every day, he couldn\u2019t take it. The scenario was similar with running back Marcus Allen, who had become arguably the best running back in the NFL by the late 1980s and also the most popular Raider. At Davis\u2019 behest, Allen was moved to fullback and forced to take a back seat to Bo Jackson, Roger Craig and Eric Dickerson.\nJones and Davis differed in how they dealt with attention. Davis was a sphinx, reveling in the mystery of silence.\nJones is transparent. He\u2019ll answer all questions and is more available than any owner of anything in the history of everything.\nIf his Cowboys could control the ball the way their owner controls the news cycle, they\u2019d lead the league in time of possession every year.\nFor Halas, the motivation was love of the game. With Jones, there was also love of the fame.\nDavis was driven by love of the Raiders, his creation.\nJones has been criticized more than Halas or Davis for several reasons. Everyone is more criticized these days, given the growth of the game and the population of trolls. By talking so much, Jones exposes himself. And he was never afforded the credibility that Halas and Davis were because they were coaches.\nJones was an offensive lineman and captain for an Arkansas team that won the UPI national championship in 1964. He accumulated his wealth as a wildcatter and did his only coaching from his couch. But he has admitted to being a frustrated coach. He once told Sports Illustrated\u2019s Frank DeFord that he \u201ccould have coached the s\u2014 out of this (Cowboys) team.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nJones has often made his influence felt on the field by having a hand in the hiring of assistant coaches. When Barry Switzer took over for Johnson in 1994, he had to retain the assistants from Johnson\u2019s staff. Switzer was allowed to hire Mike Zimmer to coach the nickel defense. Partly because Zimmer had the respect of Jones, he was retained by head coaches Chan Gailey, Dave Campo and Bill Parcells and then brought back years later under Mike McCarthy.\nWhen Halas was coaching, he hired stellar assistants, including Ralph Jones, Luke Johnsos, Clark Shaughnessy, Hunk Anderson, George Wilson and George Allen. After stepping down as a coach, Halas still had a hand in the coaching staff. Six of the nine assistants on the 1985 Super Bowl Bears, including defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan and former Bears head coach Jim Dooley, were holdovers that Ditka agreed to retain at Halas\u2019 request.\nDavis famously hired many Raiders assistant coaches after he stopped formally coaching in 1966 to become the commissioner of the AFL. Some Raiders assistants, such as Fred Biletnikoff, Willie Brown and Art Shell, were former Raiders players. When Davis named Mike Shanahan head coach in 1988, Davis allowed him to bring in only three assistants: Alex Gibbs, Nick Nicolau and Pete Rodriguez. The rest were Davis hires. Shanahan fired two of Davis\u2019 old-guard assistant coaches only to have Davis reinstate them.\nJones can be headstrong, but the truth is, he\u2019s open-minded with his lieutenants. Johnson ran the fruitful drafts that laid the foundation for the Cowboys\u2019 dynasty of the \u201990s. When Parcells was the head coach of the Cowboys, he pushed for the Cowboys to draft tight end Jason Witten and pass rusher DeMarcus Ware. Jones allowed his son Stephen Jones, his personnel director, to talk him into drafting Zack Martin instead of Johnny Manziel in 2014.\nParcells said it was a misconception that Jones had to call all the shots.\n\u201cJerry is a good businessman and a good listener,\u201d he told Dallascowboys.com after he left the team. \u201cWhat you have to do is make sense to him. \u2026 If he thinks you\u2019re making sense, he\u2019ll alter his opinion.\u201d\nNeither Jones, Davis, nor Halas was concerned about living in harmony, however.\nAdvertisement\nJones might have won more if he could have co-existed with Johnson.\nDavis might have won more if he could have co-existed with Gruden.\nHalas might have won more if he could have co-existed with his defensive coordinator, George Allen, who left because of a contract fight.\nDavis was a mentor to Jones. During Jones\u2019 first year as owner of the Cowboys, Davis often called Jones during the team\u2019s struggles to offer encouragement.\nOver the years, Davis and Jones spoke on the phone two or three times a month, with many of their calls lasting an hour or more. Jones told the Dallas Morning News that before the Cowboys of the \u201990s started winning, he and Johnson considered trading wide receiver Michael Irvin and replacing him with Kelvin Martin. Davis told Jones he would be happy to trade for Irvin, but Jones needed to keep him.\nAn argument could be made that Jones would have benefited from Davis last week.\nFor Jones, it was a compliment to be compared to Davis. Both were drawn to splashy moves, and neither could resist a roll of the dice.\nIn 1982, Mike Haynes was one of the best cornerbacks in the NFL for the Patriots, a Pro Bowler and an All-Pro. The next season, he held out for a renegotiated contract. Davis acquired him in November for first- and second-round picks. The Raiders lost only one other game the rest of the season on their way to a Super Bowl championship, as Haynes and Lester Hayes became one of the greatest cornerback duos of all time.\nA similar scenario played out in Dallas 13 years later. The Cowboys had lost to the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game the year before, so Jones poached cornerback Deion Sanders from the Niners and made him the highest-paid defensive player in the NFL. The Cowboys won Super Bowl XXX that year.\nDavis was known for taking chances on players with histories that deterred other teams. Among those he acquired despite warning flags were Lyle Alzado, John Matuszak, Todd Marinovich and JaMarcus Russell.\nAdvertisement\nJones, meanwhile, has acknowledged being an ardent believer in what he considers player rehabilitation, and he\u2019s shown it in his transactions, acquiring Charles Haley, Pacman Jones, Terrell Owens, Greg Hardy and others who gave most teams pause.\nIn 1995, Davis was intent on drafting linebacker Derrick Brooks after selecting running back Napoleon Kaufman with the 18th pick. He thought Jones would trade him the 28th pick, according to the book, \u201cAl Davis: Behind The Raiders Shield.\u201d Instead, Jones took a better offer from the Bucs, who selected Brooks.\n\u201cThat one really surprised me because Al had an affinity for Jones,\u201d former Raiders scout Bruce Kebric said. \u201cOne time, I was in Al\u2019s office and Jones called. I remember Al saying to Jones. \u2018There are not many people that I call a friend \u2026 but you\u2019re one.\u201d\nJones had such respect for Davis that when he countersued the NFL in 1990 for the freedom to cut independent marketing deals, Davis was the only team owner who was omitted from the lawsuit.\nJones and Halas probably did more to expand the NFL\u2019s reach than anyone, except for former commissioner Pete Rozelle and current commissioner Roger Goodell. A plaque in Halas Hall, written by former team official Bill McGrane, reads: \u201cBy the sheer weight of enormous will, he (Halas) demanded that America pay attention to professional football.\u201d\nAs AFL commissioner, Davis made AFL teams competitive with their NFL big brothers, which helped convince NFL owners that a merger was the wisest choice. And an expanded NFL has been a more powerful NFL.\nBetween Halas, Jones and Davis, the teams they touched won 15 championships. They also have three busts in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which underscores the most prominent similarity between them \u2014 they were visionaries.\nIn light of the Parsons trade, some are pointing out that vision often deteriorates with age.\n(Top photo: Matt Winkelmeyer / Getty Images for Netflix)"

      "text": "GREEN BAY, Wis. \u2014 Micah Parsons strolled to the podium at Lambeau Field in a sweater with green and gold lines and a yellow beanie.\n\u201cI had this for a while,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cI don\u2019t buy clothes no more, so it\u2019s kind of like Adidas or whatever\u2019s in the closet.\u201d\nParsons wanted deep down for Dallas to be his home, but he dressed to fit in at his new one.\nAdvertisement\nHere are five things we learned from Parsons\u2019 first meeting with the media in Green Bay.\nReady for Week 1?\nParsons hasn\u2019t practiced yet this preseason as he held out in Dallas, and the Green Bay Packers host the Detroit Lions next Sunday. Parsons was also dealing with a back injury, which seems to have magically healed, as he said Friday, \u201cPhysically, I\u2019m great.\u201d But what are reasonable expectations for Parsons\u2019 participation in Green Bay\u2019s season opener?\n\u201cI think I can contribute a lot,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cI\u2019m going to team up with the doctors in creating a plan. We already talked about how we can ramp things up and get me into a flow where they feel comfortable and I feel comfortable. \u2026 They didn\u2019t give up what they gave up for me to sit on the sidelines and make this big of a risk and change for me to do that, so I\u2019m going to give them my all.\u201d\nParsons said he\u2019ll meet with defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley when he returns to Green Bay on Sunday to map out what the next six days before game day look like.\n\u201cHe says he\u2019s got a lot planned for me,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the scheme looks like. I just got my iPad today. I\u2019m going to look over it. I\u2019m super excited. I know about his creativity. I\u2019ve heard a lot. Obviously, I don\u2019t watch their defense a lot, but I\u2019m excited to learn. I\u2019m excited to get better and be a dominant player for them.\u201d\nCoach Matt LaFleur approached the topic of Parsons\u2019 Week 1 participation with slightly more caution.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to see where he\u2019s at,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe he\u2019s practiced, so we\u2019ve got to be very calculated with how we deploy him and just the number of snaps that he\u2019s going to get. The first part of that is you\u2019ve got to assess the situation, and in order to do that, you\u2019ve got to have some sort of physical movement \u2026 it\u2019s gonna be a lot of time spent together, I would say, and a lot of one-on-one time to try to get him up to speed as quickly as possible. But I think more than anything else, I\u2019m confident that will happen quickly \u2014 we just gotta see where he\u2019s at physically before we put him out there and he\u2019s playing 70 snaps a game.\u201d\nThe last time a Packers player wore No. 1 was Curly Lambeau 99 years ago.\n\"I'm going with No. 1,\" Micah Parsons said Friday night inside Lambeau Field.\nStory: https://t.co/5IN3NYSCvb\n\u2014 Matt Schneidman (@mattschneidman) August 30, 2025\nRasheed Walker\u2019s role\nParsons is friends with Packers left tackle Rasheed Walker since they were in the same recruiting class at Penn State and played three years together for the Nittany Lions.\nAdvertisement\nBefore Parsons officially decided to join the Packers, he contacted Walker.\n\u201cThat\u2019s my guy,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cHe\u2019s like, \u2018It\u2019s like Penn State. It\u2019s like home. It\u2019s like a brotherhood. It\u2019s safe. You focus on ball, and you keep everything the right thing.\u2019 It kind of gave me comfort, and it kind of gave me a better decision, like, \u2018OK, this is a place where I feel like I can take my next step and continue to have a great legacy here.\u2019\u201d\nParsons has been itching to play actual football, and Walker might feel the brunt of that pent-up energy being released next week.\n\u201cI told Rasheed, I said, \u2018Bruh, just go ahead and get ready for your best practice week because I ain\u2019t put my hands in somebody so long,\u2019\u201d Parsons said.\nMatt LaFleur\u2019s first impression\nLaFleur said game planning for Parsons makes him lose sleep. He\u2019s had to do it twice, once in the 2022 regular season and once in the 2023 playoffs. The Packers won both games.\nBut LaFleur\u2019s first impression of Parsons came while coaching him in the 2021 Pro Bowl.\n\u201cThe majority of the players in the Pro Bowl \u2014 I think it\u2019s well known that\u2019s why there\u2019s not a Pro Bowl game anymore \u2014 the majority of the guys looked like they were going through the motions,\u201d LaFleur said. \u201cExcept for one guy. And he was trying to wreck shop out there, and he was trying to win, and that\u2019s one thing, just having relationships with other coaches throughout the league that have worked with him, they\u2019ll tell ya. This guy\u2019s the ultimate competitor, and whatever it is you\u2019re playing, he\u2019s gonna wanna win, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019s very apologetic about that, which is so exciting as a coach to get a guy like that, and I think that just elevates everybody around him.\u201d\nParsons was asked about LaFleur\u2019s recollection, and his answer might make Packers fans find the nearest brick wall to run through.\nAdvertisement\n\u201cYou\u2019ll realize as I\u2019m here, I\u2019m probably one of the most authentic people you\u2019ll meet,\u201d Parsons said. \u201cI\u2019m probably going to say things I probably shouldn\u2019t say off emotion, and that\u2019s just me. I\u2019m going to do as I like because that\u2019s just me. All I know is go, and if I feel like you can\u2019t be around me because you\u2019re not on go, too, we probably shouldn\u2019t be friends or probably be in the same room, so I just don\u2019t be around you.\u201d\n1 of 1 pic.twitter.com/z2R0NVtI1b\n\u2014 Green Bay Packers (@packers) August 30, 2025\nBig swing\nGeneral manager Brian Gutekunst has noted in the past, when discussing hypothetical trades such as the one he just made for Parsons, that you better be confident in the player you\u2019re acquiring because of how much it\u2019ll cost in trade capital and a contract.\nSo what made Gutekunst go ahead with this seismic deal?\n\u201cThe picks and the financial part of it, that\u2019s always a lot,\u201d Gutekunst said. \u201cBut at the same time, like I said, this is a very unique player that rarely becomes available to us. So, a little bit like X (Xavier McKinney) and Josh Jacobs, there\u2019s just not a lot of these players at this point in their career where their best football is ahead of them, that become available \u2026 every opportunity that we have to improve the football team, now and in the future, we\u2019re going to take a look at. Certainly, this was something we were going to take a look at, and then we were just fortunate enough that we were able to get it across the finish line.\u201d\nNew Packers president Ed Policy has vowed to stay out of football decisions, though Gutekunst said his new boss was consulted before making such a big move.\n\u201cVery supportive,\u201d Gutekunst said of Policy during the process of acquiring Parsons. \u201cCertainly, with a move like this, it\u2019s certainly something that I would let him know that we were going down this road. When we\u2019re signing practice squad guys, we don\u2019t do that, but with something like this, the magnitude of the financial part of it, let him know that we\u2019re going down this road and make sure that the organization\u2019s prepared for it. Mark (Murphy) was exceptionally supportive during my time with him, and Ed was the same in this instance.\u201d\nFinancial future\nHere is a look at Parsons\u2019 contract breakdown, via Over the Cap.\n\u201cI really like the three-year cap numbers, the first three years,\u201d Gutekunst said. \u201cI think that\u2019s gonna give us the flexibility with a lot of really good players coming up that we\u2019re still gonna be able to keep those guys. There\u2019s no doubt when you acquire a player like this, who\u2019s gonna take up that much of the cap, that you\u2019re gonna have to make some choices. You always do. But again, looking at it right now, the cap numbers for \u201925, \u201926 and \u201927, I think, are pretty solid for us and we\u2019ll kind of see where that goes.\u201d\n(Photo: Jayden Mack / Getty Images)"
