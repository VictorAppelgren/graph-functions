  "title": "Everything Jimmy Fallon Helped Reveal at the Made by Google Event",
  "description": "At a star-studded event hosted by the late-night host, Google announced new phones, watches, earbuds and Android features.",
  "content": "Even though the Pixel 10 leaks and rumors felt as if they arrived in a steady firehose before today's Made by Google event \u2013 compelling the company to release a teaser video pre-announcing the new phone's existence a month ago \u2013 Google still delivered details it somehow managed to keep private until it was ready to share.\n\nSurprise, Google announced new phones! OK, this was the least surprising part of the event, but it still feels good to finally know what exists and when it's coming. Preorders for the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL begin today and will be in stores and shipping starting August 28.\n\u2022 None Pixel 10 Pro and Pro XL First Look: Familiar Design, New AI Tricks\n\nPixel 10 Pro Fold opens the next chapter of foldables\n\nFolding phones so far have shared an Achilles Hinge: small particulates like sand can get inside the case and really mess things up. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold is one of the first to have an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance, meaning you can take it to the beach.\n\u2022 None Forget the Pixel 10 Pro Fold. Foldables Should Look Like the Microsoft Surface Duo\n\nPixel Watch 4 talks to Gemini and is your new health coach\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 includes new fitness options like real-time guidance while exercising. And if you forgot to start a workout, the watch (with AI help) can detect the activity in the background It's also the only smartwatch that can detect a loss of pulse and call emergency services automatically.\n\u2022 None Well Played, Google: The Pixel Watch 4 May Give Apple Watch Loyalists a Wandering Eye\n\u2022 None Pixel Watch 4 First Look: Google Just Raised the Bar\n\nJoining the Pixel Buds 2 Pro in the market are Pixel Buds 2a, an affordable ($TK) pair of wireless earbuds that feature active noise cancellation, a smaller and lighter for all, and a twist-to-adjust stabilizer feature for setting a comfortable fit.\n\u2022 None Google's New Pixel Buds 2A Look a Lot Like the Pro 2, but Cost Way Less\n\nPixel Buds Pro 2 owners will see new features\n\nComing in a software update soon, Pixel Buds Pro 2 owners will be able to answer calls or send them to voicemail with a nod or shake of the head.\n\nMagic Cue is a Gemini assistant that pulls data from your correspondence\n\nThe new Gemini-based feature can look through your earlier messages, emails and photos to pull details about things like restaurant reservations and flight times. Magic Cue runs on the Pixel device itself, so sensitive data stays private and not shared to the cloud.\n\nThe Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL can zoom to 100x with AI help\n\nPro Res Zoom on the Pixel 10 Pro phones pushes zooming far beyond what would seem to be possible with typical small cameras. Usually when you zoom beyond the optical limits of the cameras, details get fuzzy as the software upscales the image. With Pro Res Zoom, when you go beyond 30x zoom, it uses generative AI to build a sharper version.\n\nCamera Coach uses AI to encourage better photos\n\n\"Camera Coach can train all the boys for us,\" said podcaster Alex Cooper after demonstrating the feature live by making a photo of event host Jimmy Fallon.\n\nThe Qi2 spec includes not just faster charging but also an array of magnets on the back for connecting to accessories. Sound familiar? The presenters mentioned Apple's MagSafe system, then paused with the realization that they probably shouldn't have name-checked it during the Google event. On the Pixel 10 phones, it's called Pixelsnap and should work with accessories made for Apple's ecosystem too.\n\nPixel 10 will be available in Mexico\n\nFor the first time, the Pixel 10 will be available for sale in Mexico.\n\nThis article is being updated; stay tuned for more.",

      "text": "Google's new Pixel Watch 4 may have dethroned its predecessor (at least on paper) as our favorite Android Watch, setting a new standard for the rest of the smartwatch world.\nThe company debuted its latest smartwatch at its Made by Google event alongside its new phone lineup and budget-friendly earbuds. With an AI-powered health coach, improved battery life, first-of-its-kind satellite connectivity and easier repairs, the $350 Pixel Watch 4 feels like it was pulled straight from my personal wishlist. If it can deliver on all those promises, it may even give the next Apple Watch a serious run for its money.\nCompared to decade-long veterans like Samsung's Galaxy Watch and Apple Watch, the Pixel Watch still feels like the new kid on the block. But from the start, it's nailed that sweet spot between stylish hardware, robust (Fitbit-powered) health features, and seamless integration with Google's ecosystem. Rather than coasting on what already works, Google keeps addressing pain points to make each Pixel Watch better than the last. Now the Pixel Watch 4 marks what the company calls the biggest overhaul since the product first launched.\nPixel Watch 4 pricing and availability\nThe Pixel Watch 4 is available for preorder starting Aug. 20 and in stores Oct. 9. Pricing starts at $349 for the 41mm Wi-Fi model and $399 for the larger 45mm. LTE versions add $100 across the board, at $449 and $499, respectively. Every LTE model also comes with two years of Google Fi data when purchased through the Google Store or Best Buy. The watch also will ship with 32GB of storage Google's latest Wear OS 6 and, as always, will be first in line for future updates.\nPixel Watch 4 screen upgrades\nAt first glance, the Pixel Watch 4 looks a lot like its predecessors. It has the same frameless circular domed screen that seems to bubble up from the center and a metal rotating crown that adds a touch of polish. You still get 41mm and 45mm sizing options but the screen itself is larger thanks to smaller bezels that are 16% thinner and add 10% more usable area.\nThe screen also looks better at a glance. Its more pronounced dome creates a wider viewing angle and brightness has jumped by 50%, hitting a 3,000-nit peak that makes it one of the brightest smartwatch screens. In theory, that means less squinting at your workout metrics when the sun's beating down your back.\nThe screen upgrades look especially nice combined with Material 3 Expressive, Google's latest UI update tailored specifically for the wrist. The display doesn't just look better, it behaves more fluidly. UI elements like buttons and tiles now hug the curve of the screen and colors adapt to match the watch face you chose.\nPixel Watch 4 AI coach\nThe feature I'm most excited to try -- and the one that could truly elevate this watch above the rest \u2013 is a new AI health coach built on Gemini (Google's AI voice assistant). Unlike Samsung's Running Coach or Apple's Workout Buddy, this isn't limited to workout data. It's designed to connect the dots across all your health metrics, offering a more holistic view of how activity, sleep and recovery work together.\nThe feature will roll out in October as a preview through Fitbit Premium in the redesigned Fitbit app and will also be coming to the latest Fitbit trackers and smartwatches. Fitbit says the experience will grow over time as they gather feedback, but at launch, you'll be able to interact with it directly and ask specific health questions like \"How do I improve my VO\u2082 max?\" or \"Should I get an extra hour of sleep or workout tomorrow morning?\" This could add a new layer of contextual guidance on top of the Pixel Watch's already helpful health tools, like its personalized running programs and a body-response sensor that flags potential signs of stress.\nExecution will be key, but if Google delivers, this could be the closest we've come to the true health concierge that I've been dreaming of on a smartwatch.\nThe Pixel Watch 4 will also be better at detecting workouts with new AI-powered activity recognition, which can retroactively flag a session in the app and ask you to confirm if you forgot to hit start. Cyclists can now stream ride stats to their phone as a heads-up display, and the upgraded temperature sensor tracks more detailed variations in skin temperature.\nThe Pixel Watch 4 brings Gemini to the wrist\nOutside of health, Gemini is fully integrated into the Pixel Watch 4 from day one, and it's a massive step up over any other voice assistant we've tried. A new gesture means you won't even have to say \"Hey Google\", just raise your wrist and start talking. An upgraded speaker and stronger haptic engine also makes Gemini's responses easier to hear and alerts harder to miss, so it feels more natural to use without pulling out your phone. Because Gemini processes everything in the cloud, you'll still need either your phone nearby or an LTE connection for it to work.\nPixel Watch 4 battery improvements\nBattery life has always been a weak spot for the Pixel watch, so there was a lot of room for improvement. The Pixel Watch 3 barely hit its 24-hour claim with the always-on display enabled, often falling short for overnight tracking. The Pixel Watch 4 addresses this with a dual-chip setup (Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 plus a Cortex-M55 co-processor) that Google says boosts battery life by 25%. That means up to 30 hours on the 41mm model, 40 hours on the 45mm, or as much as three days in low-power mode.\nJust as important: it now charges faster. You can get to 50% in just 15 minutes, or wait an hour for a full charge. That quick top-up could make a huge difference for 24/7 health tracking especially if you only have a few minutes to charge before starting the day or heading to bed. The secret behind the faster charging is a new side-mounted charging dock (included in the box), though you'll need a 30W or higher wall plug (not included) to take full advantage.\nEasier repairs\nIf the battery gives out completely and needs to be replaced, Pixel Watch 4 owners won't be out of luck. Google made the battery and display swappable, meaning accredited providers can handle repairs more easily (please don't try this yourself). That's a rarity in the smartwatch world, where cracking open the hardware for fixes is almost unheard of.\nPixel Watch 4 supports satellite SOS\nThe Pixel Watch 4 is the first smartwatch to support emergency satellite communication. That means even if you're completely off the grid (without a phone or cell service) the Watch 4 can still connect to a satellite to send an SOS message and share your location. It's a powerful addition to an already robust safety suite that includes fall detection, crash detection and loss-of-pulse alerts, and it could be a game-changer for outdoor athletes, frequent travelers or anyone living in areas with spotty coverage.\nUnlike Apple's Emergency SOS via satellite, which still requires an iPhone to relay messages, Google has cut out the need for a Pixel phone to be a middleman and instead handles all communication directly from the Pixel Watch 4\nLocation tracking also gets a boost thanks to dual-frequency GPS. This means more precise tracking in tough environments like dense cityscapes (where tall buildings can bounce signals) or deep wilderness trails. Satellite connectivity will be limited to LTE versions for now, while dual-band GPS will be available on LTE and Wi-Fi models."

      "text": "The Pixel 10 Pro Fold may not look too different from Google's previous foldable phone, but it does bring some key improvements to areas like battery life and durability, while maintaining perhaps the most important aspect: the price. The 10 Pro Fold starts at $1,799 and will be available starting Oct. 9.\nGoogle unveiled its latest foldable, along with the rest of the Pixel 10 series, at its Made by Google event in New York on Wednesday. The rest of the lineup includes the baseline Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, which have an earlier Aug. 28 release date. Like the 10 Pro Fold, the Pixel Watch 4 and Pixel Buds 2A hit store shelves on Oct. 9.\nPixel 10 Pro Fold build and durability\nPerhaps the most impressive feature on the Pixel 10 Pro Fold is its IP68 rating. That means the phone is completely protected against dust and can be submerged in up to a meter and a half of water for 30 minutes -- the same level of particle and liquid resistance as most other premium phones.\nFoldables typically have little -- if any -- protection against granular solids; the last Pixel Fold didn't even have a rating for that, only for keeping out liquids. Samsung has also only been able to muster an IP48 rating for its Galaxy Z Fold 7, which means that phone can handle solid particles bigger than 1 millimeter but not dust. That makes Google's feat all the more impressive -- and welcome. You can hopefully take your foldable to the beach and not worry too much about sand getting in and ruining your pricey new device.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is about the same size as last year's Fold, albeit with a slightly larger 6.4-inch cover screen. The internal display remains at 8 inches. The phone is one gram heavier than the 9 Pro Fold, clocking in at 258g. The gearless hinge is designed to be more durable, Google says. The phone's front and back are made with Corning's Gorilla Glass Victus 2, just like the 9 Pro Fold.\nBoth the cover and internal displays have a slightly higher 3,000 nits peak brightness, and a split screen mode makes it easier to multitask and quickly adjust app sizes with a tap. You can drag and drop media and files, like an image from Google Photos or a link from Chrome into Messages, essentially turning your Fold into a mini computer of sorts.\nPixel 10 Pro Fold cameras and AI\nThe camera specs match those on last year's Fold. There's a 48-megapixel wide-angle, 10.5-megapixel ultrawide and 10.8-megapixel telephoto camera, as well as 10-megapixel selfie cameras on the inner and cover screens. But the Pixel 10 Pro Fold leans heavily into new AI capabilities to boost images.\nOne of these new AI features, Camera Coach, taps Gemini to serve up tips on how to take a better shot. It might tell you to photograph your subject at a lower angle, or to work in more of the background, or even to switch to Portrait mode. I got to try out the feature at Google's campus in Mountain View, California, ahead of the Pixel 10 launch and was impressed with the tips it offered to really make subjects and architecture pop -- and I'd like to think of myself as an already good mobile photographer.\nAnother feature, Auto Best Take, builds on the feature Google debuted with the Pixel 8, but instead of manually selecting which expressions to piece together for an ideal group photo, AI will now automatically surface one image where everyone looks their best. This is the AI update I'm perhaps most excited about; when I tried the feature, I was impressed at how seamlessly it pieced together the winning shot on its own. And Add Me, which uses augmented reality and AI to seemingly include the photographer in the shot, now works on even bigger groups.\nPowering all of this is the new Tensor G5 chip. Google says it allows for a smoother user experience and boosts photo and video quality.\nIt's also what enables other on-device AI features like Magic Cue, which can pull up relevant information based on what you're doing. For example, if you're calling your airline, Magic Cue can show your flight details as soon as you dial or it might automatically bring up the address for your Airbnb when a friend asks for it.\nPixel 10 Pro Fold battery and charging\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold has a 5,015-mAh battery, a notable boost over the 9 Pro Fold's 4,650-mAh capacity. Google says the 10 Pro Fold can last more than 30 hours and can reach 50% charge in 30 minutes. That's something we'll be sure to check out in CNET's battery and charging tests, so stay tuned for our review.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold is also Qi2 certified if you'd rather go the wireless charging route. Magnets embedded in the phone, which Google calls PixelSnap, also make it easier to snap on wireless chargers, stands and other accessories -- much like the iPhone's MagSafe connector, though it's unclear if they're similar enough for magnetic accessories to work on both.\nAn eye on practicality\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold may not have as revolutionary a design as the super-slim Galaxy Z Fold 7, but it appears to focus on the more practical, core features of a phone. According to a recent CNET survey, the top considerations when buying a new phone are price, battery life, storage and camera features.\nThe 10 Pro Fold seemingly checks all those boxes. A $1,799 price tag isn't pocket change, but at least Google didn't hike the price, as Samsung did with its book-style foldable. The 10 Pro Fold also has a higher battery capacity than both last year's fold and the Z Fold 7. Google's new phone comes with a generous 16GB of RAM and either 256GB, 512GB or 1TB of storage. And while the camera specs match last year's Pixel Fold, a batch of new AI features help to elevate images.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro Fold comes with seven years of OS and security updates to help stretch your dollars, which is the high-water mark for software security these days (Samsung also guarantees seven years of updates for its phones).\nStay tuned to CNET's ongoing coverage of the full Pixel 10 lineup in the weeks to come.\nGoogle Pixel 10 Pro Fold specs vs. Pixel 9 Pro Fold, Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7, Oppo Find N5\n| Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold | Google Pixel 9 Pro Fold | Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 | Oppo Find N5 | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Cover display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.4-inch OLED; 2,364x1,080 pixels; 60 to 120Hz refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,424x1,080 pixels; 60 to 120 Hz variable refresh rate | 6.5-inch AMOLED, 2,520x1,080p, 1 to 120Hz refresh rate | 6.62-inch OLED; 2,616x1,140 pixels; 1 to120Hz variable refresh rate |\n| Internal display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 8-inch OLED; 2,152 x 2,076 pixels; 1 to 120Hz refresh rate (LTPO) | 8-inch OLED; 2,152x2,076 pixels, 1 to 120 Hz variable refresh rate (LTPO) | 8-inch AMOLED, 2,184x1,968p, 1 to 120Hz refresh rate | 8.12-inch OLED; 2,480x2,248 pixels; 1 to 120Hz variable refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | Cover: 408ppi; Internal: 373ppi | Cover: 422 ppi; Internal: 373 ppi | Cover: 422 ppi; Internal: 368 ppi | Cover: 431 ppi; Internal: 412 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | Open: 6.1 x 5.9 x 0.2 in; Closed: 6.1 x 3 x 0.4 in | Open: 6.1 x 5.9 x 0.2 in; Closed: 6.1 x 3 x 0.4 in | Open: 5.63 x 6.24 x 0.17 in; Closed: 2.87 x 6.24 x 0.35 in | Open: 6.3x5.77x0.16 in; Closed: 6.3x2.93x0.35 in |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | Open: 155.2 x 150.4 x 5.2 mm; Closed: 155.2 x 76.3 x 10.8 mm | Open: 155.2x150.2x5.1 mm; Closed: 155.2x77.1x10.5 mm | Open: 143.2 x 158.4 x 4.2mm; Closed: 72.8 x 158.4 x 8.9mm | Open: 160.87x146.58x4.21mm; Closed: 160.87x74.42x8.93mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 258g (9.1 oz) | 257g (9.1 oz) | 215g (7.58 oz.) | 229g (8.08 oz) |\n| Mobile software | Android 16 | Android 14 | Android 16 | Android 15 |\n| Cameras | 48-megapixel (wide), 10.5-megapixel (ultrawide), 10.8-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 48-megapixel (wide), 10.5-megapixel (ultrawide), 10.8-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 200-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (telephoto) | 50-megapixel (main), 8-megapixel (ultrawide), 50-megapixel (periscope telephoto) |\n| Internal screen camera | 10-megapixel (inner screen); 10-megapixel (cover screen) | 10-megapixel (inner screen); 10-megapixel (cover screen) | 10-megapixel (inner screen); 10-megapixel (outer screen) | 8-megapixel (inner screen); 8-megapixel (cover screen) |\n| Video capture | 4K | 4K | 8K | 4K |\n| Processor | Google Tensor G5 | Google Tensor G4 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy | Snapdragon 8 Elite |\n| RAM/storage | 16GB + 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | 16GB + 256GB, 512GB | 12GB + 256GB, 12GB + 512GB, 16GB + 1TB | 16GB + 512GB |\n| Expandable storage | None | None | None | None |\n| Battery | 5,015 mAh | 4,650 mAh | 4,400 mAh | 5,600 mAh |\n| Fingerprint sensor | Yes | Side | Yes | Side |\n| Connector | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C |\n| Headphone jack | None | None | None | None |\n| Special features | IP68 rating, gearless hinge, cover and internal screen 3,000 nits peak brightnes, Glass Victus 2 cover and back glass, Satellite SOS, ultra-wideband chip, Qi2-certified, free Google VPN. 7 years of OS, security and Pixel Drop updates | IPX8 rating, Satellite SOS, Wi-Fi 7, ultrawideband chip, Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover and back glass, cover screen peek brightness 2,700 nits, internal screen peek brightness 2,700 nits, 21W wired fast charging (Charger not included), Qi-certified, free Google VPN, Super Res Zoom, Add Me, Face Unblur, Made You Look, Magic Editor, Magic Eraser, Best Take, Video Boost. 7 years of OS, security and Pixel Drop updates | One UI 8, 25W wired charging speed, Qi wireless charging, 2,600-nit peak brightness, Galaxy AI, NFC, Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4, IP48 water resistance | IPX9 rating, 80W fast wired charging, 50W wireless charging, nanocrystal glass cover display, anti-reflective film on inner display, cover screen peek brightness 2,450 nits, internal screen peek brightness 2,100 nits, LTPO OLED display |\n| US price starts at | $1,799 (256GB) | $1,799 (256GB) | $2,000 (256GB) | $1,870 (512GB) |"

      "text": "I've been testing the new Google Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL, including extensively trying the 10 Pro XL's camera while roaming the streets of Paris. So far, I'm pleased with what I've seen.\nIf you're expecting a totally new generation of Google Pixel devices with the 10 Pro, you may be disappointed. The Pixel 10 Pro is an evolution of its predecessor rather than a complete overhaul. And that's fine.\nRead more: Made by Google Event 2025\nGoogle's Pixel 9 Pro impressed me when it launched last year, and it certainly doesn't require a radical transformation just one generation later. The newest Pixel model keeps the 9 Pro's slick design and awesome camera system, while the latest Android 16 software brings a host of new updates. There's also the new Tensor G5 processor, which Google says is faster and more power-efficient than the G4 chip found in last year's model.\nYes, some of the Pixel 10 Pro's new features are based around various new AI tools. The camera, in particular, increasingly incorporates AI into the way you take pictures. Whether that's good or bad is up to you to decide. At least that triple rear camera array can take stunning images, as I found out.\nThe Pixel 10 Pro with 128GB of storage costs $999, while the 10 Pro XL starts at $1,199 with 256GB of storage. Both go on sale on Aug. 28. While it might seem that the XL's starting price is $100 higher than last year's model, Google eliminated the lower 128GB storage option. While you're paying more for the bigger screen, you're also getting double the storage.\nGoogle 10 Pro vs. 10 Pro XL: What's the difference?\nTo be honest, there's very little difference between the 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL. They look almost identical, except for the XL model being slightly bigger. The XL model incorporates a 6.8-inch display into its larger frame, giving a bit more space to play games or watch videos than the standard 6.3-inch 10 Pro. The extra size also allows for a marginally heftier battery (5,200 mAh versus 4,870 mAh), while the XL also offers slightly faster 45-watt wired charging.\nOtherwise, the core specs are basically the same. Both models share the same Tensor G5 chip and have 16GB of RAM. The camera hardware on the back and front is identical. The choice between the two comes down to whether you prefer big-screen phones for more immersive gaming or something more pocket-friendly.\nPixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL cameras: Solid performance with AI additions\nBoth Pro models use the same rear camera setup, which includes a 50-megapixel main camera with an f/1.68 aperture, a 48-megapixel ultrawide camera and a 48-megapixel telephoto camera with 5x optical zoom. While I haven't put the cameras through a full suite of tests, I took hundreds of photos with the 10 Pro XL in Paris, and I was impressed.\nPhotos from the main camera are bright, pin-sharp and vibrant. Exposure is handled extremely well, with bright skies kept under control and shadow detail clearly visible. Sometimes, images can look a little bit too HDR with unnaturally lightened shadows, but this is par for the course for most phone cameras, and I've certainly seen worse.\nThe ultrawide camera performs similarly well, with little to no color shift when swapping between lenses, which is good to see.\nThe 5x optical zoom remains an ideal sweet spot in terms of focal length, giving just enough zoom to help you find more creative compositions in whatever scene you're facing. Images are sharp and share the same spot-on handling of color and exposure as the main lens. If 5x zoom isn't enough for you, the Pixel lets you take things much further.\nYou can digitally zoom in to 10x, with the resulting image simply being slightly upscaled by the phone's software. Shots look great at this length, and continue to look decent up to 30x. Beyond this point, though, the AI takes over (Google calls it ProRes Zoom) and goes beyond simply upscaling the details. ProRes Zoom actually uses generative AI to try to recreate what it thinks should be in the scene.\nI took a variety of photos at 100x zoom, and the difference between the original image and the AI version is significant. Most of the time, it actually worked quite well, especially when I was just taking zoomed-in shots overlooking Paris, as the ProRes Zoom is optimized for static subjects like buildings and landscapes.\nI was a bit amused when I took a 100x shot of a plane going overhead. The AI recomposed it into an odd sort of bundle of sticks. However, I'm glad it didn't identify my blurry shot as a plane and simply superimpose a picture of a Boeing 737 over the top.\nThat does bring up an important question: if the phone is using generative AI to recreate details in a scene, is it really a photo that you're taking? Google is certainly trying to get ahead of some of the moral issues here in that it says this AI tool will not be applied to faces \"to prevent inaccurate representations.\"\nThe ProRes Zoom isn't the only place you'll find AI in the camera, either. Camera Coach uses AI to analyze the scene in front of you and give you a series of guided prompts on how to take a better photo. If you're taking a portrait, for example, it may suggest putting more of the person in the frame. I used it a few times on my photo walk through Paris, and I can see it being a fun tool for photography newbies to play around with. Still, it felt a bit slow and clunky to be of much use in a quicker photography scenario. Time will tell if Camera Coach becomes a genuinely useful resource for improving photography or not.\nThere's also the Auto Best Take feature, which automatically merges together the best shots of faces in a group to ensure none of your friends have their eyes closed or are squinting. Best Take was introduced on the Pixel 8 phones and required some manual work, whereas the new version does most of the work for you.\nNow, you can also use AI to edit your photos via text prompts like \"erase the crowds\" or \"fix the lighting.\" It remains to be seen how it handles my prompt to \"make me look ten years younger, slimmer, more handsome and wealthy, and also put cats everywhere.\"\nGoogle 10 Pro: Design and display\nThough the Pixel 10 Pro's design hasn't changed much since the Pixel 9 Pro, that's fine. The 9 Pro was a great-looking phone with a really slick feel, and these phones don't need to be revolutionized every single year. Google knew it had a good thing, so it's sticking with it for another generation at least.\nThe polished metal edges, frosted glass back and isolated camera bar continue to look and feel satisfyingly premium. The IP68 rating will help keep it safe from accidentally spilled drinks. The back of the phone is now magnetic, allowing its use with wireless chargers or other magnetic accessories. Google calls this Pixel Snap, but it's basically the same as Apple's MagSafe on the iPhone. It should be compatible with MagSafe and other Qi2-supported products.\nThe 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL's displays can now reach 3,300 nits peak brightness, and both looked bright and sharp during my hands-on time. While I only got to use the 10 Pro indoors, the XL's display was more than bright enough to let me take pictures under the shining midday Paris sun.\nGoogle 10 Pro: Android 16 and AI tools\nThe phones will launch with the latest Android 16, featuring various upgrades. Chief among these is the new Material 3 Expressive interface, with changes to animations, texts, icons, menu layout and other elements to give a more refined, easier-to-use experience.\nI already like the Pixel 9 Pro's stock Android look. As a result, I find the model extremely easy to use, and I'm excited by what I've seen of Android 16 so far. It's not a total overhaul, but it looks like there are a lot of subtle improvements to help make Android feel a bit more usable in everyday life. I'm looking forward to spending more time with it when I get the phone for the full review.\nAI is, unsurprisingly, a major part of the Pixel 10 Pro line, with various new AI tools being introduced. Magic Cue, for example, aims to automatically surface relevant information when you need it. Say you're texting a friend and they ask for details about the camping trip you have coming up. Magic Cue will see this request and can pull up relevant information from Gmail, such as confirmation messages for the campsite and details you two have discussed. It can share that without making you switch apps to find it yourself.\nCalling an airline to alter a booking? Magic Cue will recognize the phone number and automatically pull up your flight details so you have them ready. It certainly sounds like a helpful tool, though I do wonder exactly how useful it will be. Magic Cue only pulls info from certain Google apps (Gmail, Messages, Calendar and your screenshots), but not from third-party apps like WhatsApp or Instagram. So if you tend to mostly chat outside of Google services, its use might be more limited. As always, I'm excited to delve deeper when I get the phone in my hand.\nThere's a host of other new AI tools including a real-time voice translation tool when you're making phone calls. Existing tools like Gemini Advanced, Circle to Search and Pixel Studio (the generative-AI image maker) are also on board as standard.\nThe base Pixel 10, 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL all run the new Tensor G5 chip, but the two Pro models also get 16GB of RAM for some extra multitasking prowess, compared to 8GB on the standard Pixel 10. How this silicon performs on our suite of benchmark tests -- as well as for gaming and other demanding uses -- remains to be seen. Google has made various boasts of the G5 chip's significant power increase, both in the CPU and GPU.\nAccording to Google, all new Pixel 10 models will receive seven years of software and security updates. That means these phones will be safe to use until at least 2032, as long as you look after them properly.\nPixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL: Battery and Qi2 charging\nEach phone should provide at least a full day of battery life. You might expect a bit more longevity from the larger battery of the XL model, but bear in mind that it also has a bigger, brighter display to power, which will suck away more of the juice over the course of the day.\nBattery life on the 9 Pro was basically average, and to be honest, that's fine if that's the case again. As long as I can make it into the evening without desperately hunting for a charger to see me to bedtime, I'm happy. Almost all phones demand a full recharge every night, and I don't expect that to change here.\nWhat is different, though, is the implementation of Qi2 technology, the latest version of the wireless charging standard that promises faster charging times when used with a compatible charger (up to 25 watts). Wired charging is faster, too, with the 10 Pro supporting 30-watt charging and the 10 Pro XL taking that further to 45 watts. Google says the XL model will go from empty to 70% full in around 30 minutes, which will certainly come in handy if you're running low on power when getting ready for a big night out.\nPixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL: Are they worth buying?\nThe new Pixel 10 Pro series isn't a big overhaul from the last generation, so those of you with a Pixel 9 Pro don't need to consider upgrading. Probably ditto for anyone with the Pixel 8 Pro.\nIf, however, you have a much older Pixel model or other Android phone -- or if you're looking for a change from Apple -- you should consider Google's new phones.\nThe design of the Pixel 10 Pro series remains slick. The cameras performed well in our early tests, and the new AI-based tools like Magic Cue appear to be genuinely useful. Throw in the faster charging speeds, long software support and promised upgrades to the overall performance, and the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL are shaping up to be superb flagship Android phones.\nGoogle Pixel 10 Pro specs vs. Pixel 10 Pro XL, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, Pixel 10\n| Google Pixel 10 Pro | Google Pixel 10 Pro XL | Google Pixel 9 Pro | Google Pixel 9 Pro XL | Google Pixel 10 | |\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.3-inch LTPO OLED;

      "text": "Samsung recently unveiled its \"fan-edition\" Galaxy Buds 3 FE earbuds ($150), a more affordable version of its flagship Galaxy Buds Pro 3 earbuds that leave off a few features. You can think about Google's Pixel Buds 2A ($130) in much the same way.\nEssentially a slightly stripped-down version of Google's highly rated flagship Pixel Buds Pro 2 ($229), they look very similar but don't offer quite the same performance or feature set for a more affordable price. Introduced at Google's Pixel 10 launch event, they're available now for preorder in hazel or iris and ship Oct. 9.\nRead more: Best Wireless Earbuds of 2025\nGoogle says the Pixel Buds 2A's design was \"inspired\" by the Pixel Buds Pro 2's design and, at first glance, it's not so easy to figure out what's different about them. While the Pixel Buds 2A are also powered by Google Tensor A1 chip, they're missing a microphone in each bud (they have two mics per bud while the Buds Pro 2 have three) and the Buds 2A leave off wireless charging, a voice accelerometer, head tracking for spatial audio and a ringtone speaker in the case for Find My Device.\nWhile the Buds 2A weigh exactly the same as the Buds Pro 2 (4.7 grams) and also have 11mm drivers, their battery life is rated for an hour less -- 7 hours instead of 8 with noise canceling on. They also feature Silent Seal 1.5 for noise canceling instead of Silent Seal 2.0, which presumably means their noise canceling isn't quite as good. Here's a full list of the differences between the two earbuds that I found.\nHow the Google Pixel Buds 2A are different from Pixel Buds Pro 2\n- Two microphones per bud instead of three\n- No wireless charging or ringtone speaker in the case for Find My Device\n- No voice accelerometer to help detect when you're talking\n- No Conversation Detection feature that automatically lowers volume when you speak and activates transparency mode so you can have a conversation\n- No motion-detecting accelerometer and gyroscope (no head tracking for spatial audio)\n- Silent Seal 1.5 for noise canceling instead of Silent Seal 2.0\n- Up to 7 hours of battery life instead of 8 (noise canceling on)\n- Charging case weighs 47.6 grams (with earbuds inside) instead of 65 grams\n- Made out of 41% recycled materials instead of 24%\nThe two models fit similarly, with the same stability wing on each bud and a twist-to-fit design. The buds are lightweight and compact and should fit most ears well but I had some trouble getting a tight seal with the Buds Pro 2's included ear tips (I ended up using my own tips) and I suspect I may have the same seal issue with these buds.\nAt the same time it revealed the Pixel Buds 2A, Google noted that the Pixel Buds Pro 2 will be getting some new features in October via a firmware update. These include an adaptive audio mode that \"intelligently adapts to your surroundings\" (similar to Apple's adaptive audio mode for the AirPods Pro 2 that softens loud noises as you encounter them to protect your hearing) and new Gemini features that will allow to speak to Gemini live in noisy environments. Gemini is Google's AI voice assistant.\nI'll let you know how the Pixel Buds 2A stack up performance-wise to the Buds Pro 2 and other earbuds in this price class, including the new Samsung Galaxy Buds FE, as soon as I get my hands on a review sample in early October. For now, here's a look at the Pixel Buds 2A's key specs, according to Google.\nGoogle Pixel Buds 2A key specs\n- IP54 dust-resistant and splash proof (case is IPX4 splash proof)\n- Weight: 4.7 grams per bud\n- Bluetooth 5.4\n- Google Tensor A1\n- Custom-designed 11mm dynamic speaker driver\n- Active noise cancellation with Silent Seal 1.5\n- Transparency mode\n- Active in-ear pressure relief\n- Bluetooth Super Wideband\n- Battery life: 7 hours with noise-canceling on with an additional 20 hours in the case\n- Clear Calling\n- Wind-blocking mesh covers\n- Two microphones per bud\n- Capacitive touch (tap) sensors for music, calls and voice-assistant controls\n- IR proximity sensor for in-ear detection to play and pause automatically\n- Hall Effect sensor for case open and close detection\n- USB-C charging\n- Colors: iris and hazel\n- Price: $130\n- Ship date: Oct. 9"

      "text": "The Pixel 10 has arrived. It has a bigger battery, support for faster charging, new AI-powered tools and new cameras including one with a 5x telephoto lens (the first on a non-Pro Pixel phone). After years of Google raising the price on its standard Pixel phone, it's nice to see the company pack the Pixel 10 with features while keeping the starting price at $799, the same as last year's Pixel 9.\nThe Pixel 10, announced at the Made by Google event, builds on last year's excellent Pixel 9 design by adding new tools, like an Gemini AI-powered Camera Coach, and expanding existing ones, like raising the maximum brightness of the 6.3-inch screen to 3,000 nits.\nBut something is different about the Pixel 10.\nInstead of being a scaled down version of a Pixel Pro that costs $200 less, like the Pixel 9, the Pixel 10 is a hybrid of Google's Pro line and budget series. It has a similar body and design as the $999 Pixel 10 Pro but the same main and ultrawide cameras as the $499 Pixel 9A. I think it's smart for Google to push the Pixel 10 closer to the Pixel 9A to help differentiate it from the Pixel 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL. But I will miss having those Pro cameras.\nThe Pixel 10 is available to preorder starting today and will be in stores starting Aug. 28.\nPixel 10 design, battery and processor\nThe Pixel 10 is nearly identical to the Pixel 9. The camera bar on the back defines the phone and keeps it from being a wobbly nightmare when it's laid flat on a table. The new Pixel comes in several colors: Frost, lemongrass, obsidian and indigo -- yes, that's the same deep blue hue that the original Pixel came in back in 2016. The frame is made from aluminum and has a satin finish that complements the Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 polished back. The screen is also covered in Victus 2.\nThe new Pixel has a bigger battery -- 4,970 mAh -- than last year's Pixel 9 which had a 4,700-mAh battery. It will be curious to see how much of a boost the larger battery gives. Last year's Pixel 9 easily got through a busy day on a single charge, but the Pixel 10 has a brighter screen and new AI features which might cancel out any gains. I look forward to testing it out.\nThe Pixel 10 supports Qi2 wireless charging up to 15W and has magnets on back to help it ensure the correct alignment with a charger. What's nice is like Apple's MagSafe for the iPhone those magnets, which Google calls Pixelsnap, can support magnetic accessories like a wallet or grip. In theory, you should be able to use iPhone MagSafe accessories, too. I got to try out Google's Pixelsnap Ring Stand, which is both a grip and a nifty stand, and I was enthusiastic about it.\nUS models of the Pixel 10 lack a physical SIM card and instead support two active eSIMs but can store eight more. The phone runs on Google's Tensor G5 chip (the same one found in the 10 Pro) and 12GB of RAM. It comes with Android 16 out of the box and the phone looks incredible with the Material 3 Expressive design overhaul. Let's just say it's got that quirky Pixel vibe down pat.\nPixel 10 cameras\nThe Pixel 10 has three new rear cameras. There's a trio of lenses: a wide-angle, an ultrawide and a 5x telephoto. On paper, the 48-megapixel wide-angle camera and the 13-megapixel ultrawide seem identical to the cameras on Pixel 9A. It's not that those cameras are bad -- I've gotten some wonderful images from the Pixel 9A -- it's that the Pixel 10 feels a bit less special without having the same wide and ultrawide cameras found on the Pixel 10 Pro. I should also remind myself that Google's photo processing pipeline has much more to do with the Pixel's reputation for taking excellent phone photos than the actual lens and sensor hardware.\nExpanding the phone's rear cameras from two to three should make a lot of people happy. This makes the Pixel 10 more competitive with Samsung's Galaxy S25 which also has three rear cameras. And it upstages the iPhone 16 which just has two rear cameras. More cameras aren't necessarily better, but I'm excited to see what it's like to use them.\nAround the front, is a 10.5-megapixel selfie camera.\nPixel 10 AI and Gemini\nGoogle's latest Pixel comes with a bunch of AI tools and goodies. There's a new Gemini-powered Camera Coach which can give you a mini step-by-step tutorial on how to take a better photo. It makes suggestions like having you step closer to your subject or changing your framing to help you grab a better image. This seems aimed at someone who wants to improve their photography skills or slow down and really concentrate on being in the moment and getting the best photo. There's even a Get Inspired option which really gave me some suggestions that I would have never thought to try.\nBest Take debuted on the Pixel 8 and uses a series of images of a group photo to find the \"best\" expression for each person in the picture. When I first tried it in 2023, I called it face swap, because that's what it's kind of doing. The idea is that friend who always has their eyes closed in a group shot can have their \"face replaced\" with another image in the series where their eyes are open. On the Pixel 10, this all happens automatically so you don't need to worry about having enough images to swap faces.\nThen there's Magic Cue which can pull up relevant information off your phone based on what you're doing. For example, if a friend is asking for the address for your Airbnb it will surface that info so you don't need to go digging for it. Out of all the AI features on the Pixel 10 series, I am most intrigued by Magic Cue. If it works as advertised I can see it being a valuable way to save time and minimize the stress of searching for things on your phone.\nLike the Pixel 9 series, the Pixel 10 has Gemini integrated into it. I half-joked last year that Google was going to change the name of its phones from Pixel to Gemini. The same is true this year. And I'm keen to see how it handles with the new Tensor G5 chip.\nGoogle Pixel 10 specs vs. Pixel 9, Pixel 9A, Samsung Galaxy S25\n| Google Pixel 10 | Google Pixel 9 | Google Pixel 9A | Samsung Galaxy S25 | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Display size, tech, resolution, refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,424x1,080 pixels; 60 to 120 Hz variable refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,424x1,080 pixels; 60 to 120 Hz variable refresh rate | 6.3-inch OLED; 2,424x1,080 pixels; 60 to 120 Hz variable refresh rate | 6.2-inch AMOLED; 2,340x1,080 pixels; 1 to 120Hz adaptive refresh rate |\n| Pixel density | 422 ppi | 422 ppi | 422 ppi | 416 ppi |\n| Dimensions (inches) | 6 x 2.8 x 0.3 in | 6 x 2.8 x 0.3 in | 6.1 x 2.9 x 0.4 in | 5.78 x 2.78 x 0.28 in. |\n| Dimensions (millimeters) | 152.8 x 72 x 8.5 mm | 152.8 x 72 x 8.5 mm | 154.7 x 73.3 x 8.9 mm | 146.9 x 70.5 x 7.2 mm |\n| Weight (grams, ounces) | 204 g (7.2 oz) | 198 g (7 oz) | 186 g (6.6 oz) | 162 g (5.71 oz.) |\n| Mobile software | Android 16 | Android 14 | Android 15 | Android 15 |\n| Camera | 48-megapixel (wide), 13-megapixel (ultrawide), 10.8-megapixel (5x telephoto) | 50-megapixel (wide), 48-megapixel (ultrawide) | 48-megapixel (wide), 13-megapixel (ultrawide) | 50-megapixel (wide), 12-megapixel (ultrawide), 10-megapixel (3x telephoto) |\n| Front-facing camera | 10.5-megapixel | 10.5-megapixel | 13-megapixel | 12-megapixel |\n| Video capture | 4K | 4K | 4K | 8K |\n| Processor | Google Tensor G5 | Google Tensor G4 | Google Tensor G4 | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy |\n| RAM + storage | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB | 8GB + 128GB, 256GB | 12GB RAM + 128GB, 256GB |\n| Expandable storage | None | None | None | None |\n| Battery | 4,970 mAh | 4,700 mAh | 5,100 mAh | 4,000 mAh |\n| Fingerprint sensor | Under display | Under display | Under display | Under display |\n| Connector | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C | USB-C |\n| Headphone jack | None | None | None | None |\n| Special features | Gorilla Glass 2 Victus cover glass; 3,000 nits peak brightness; Satellite SOS; Dual-eSIM; Wi-Fi 6E; NFC; Bluetooth 6; 30W fast charging (wall charger not included); Qi2 15W wireless charging; support for PixelSnap magnetic accessories; Google VPN; Super Res Zoom up to 20x; Camera Coach; Add Me; Macro mode; Face Unblur; Auto Best Take; IP68 rating for dust and water resistance; 7 years of OS, security, and Pixel Drop updates; Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 polished back with satin finish aluminum frame | Satellite SOS; 7 years of OS, security and Pixel feature drops; Gorilla Glass Victus 2 cover glass; IP68 dust and water resistance; 2,700-nit peak brightness; 27W fast charging (charger not included); 15W wireless charging with Google Pixel Stand (second gen); 12W wireless Qi-charging; Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 7; NFC; Bluetooth 5.3; dual SIM (eSIM + nano SIM); Add Me; Best Take; Magic Eraser; Magic Editor | 7 years of OS, security and Pixel feature drops; Gorilla Glass 3 cover glass; IP68 dust and water resistance; 2,700-nit peak brightness; 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio; 23W fast charging (charger not included); 7.5W wireless charging Qi certified; Wi-Fi 6E; NFC; Bluetooth 5.3; dual-SIM (nano SIM + eSIM); Add Me; Best Take; Magic Eraser; Magic Editor; Photo Unblur; Super Res Zoom; Circle to Search | 2,600-nit peak brightness; 7 years of OS and security updates; 5G (mmWave); IP68 water and dust resistance; wireless PowerShare to charge other devices; 25W wired charging (charger not included); Galaxy AI; Wi-Fi 7 |\n| US price starts at | $799 (128GB) | $799 (128GB) | $499 (128GB) | $800 (128GB) |"

      "text": "Google almost got it right with the first Pixel Fold.\nAs Google unveils its latest foldable, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold, at this year's Made by Google event, I keep thinking about the original Pixel Fold. Released in 2023, it was far from a perfect phone. It was underpowered, had a thick inner bezel and couldn't open completely flat. Even then, it was a beautiful device with a shiny stainless steel chassis that felt substantial in the hand. Not only that, it was wide. The passport-like form factor made it squat in comparison to slab-style iPhones and Galaxys, but when opened up, it had an almost TV-like 17:9 aspect ratio.\nThen, with the Pixel 9 Pro Fold the following year, Google threw out the Moleskine for Galaxy Z Fold-style safety.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold axed its predecessor's passport-like form factor for a slab that happened to fold open. Literally, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold had the same outer screen aspect ratio as the Pixel 9 Pro. Here, Google was folding (no pun intended) to industry trends, following similar form factors of the Galaxy Z Fold 6, OnePlus Open, Xiaomi's MIX Fold 4 and others.\nApart from the first Pixel Fold, the only other phone to go squat and wide was the first Oppo Find N from 2021. YouTuber Marques Brownlee went so far as to call it the best folding phone, in terms of form factor. Since then, Oppo dropped the passport for a folding slab, as can be seen with the Oppo Find N5.\nWhy all foldables look the same\nA major reason all foldable phone makers have adopted a similar form factor is app support. The outer display on the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7 has a more typical slab phone aspect ratio, meaning apps better conform to its standard smartphone-like screen. And when opened, loading up two apps side-by-side fits well on what's essentially a long rectangle.\n\"That's what led us to say, 'Hey, we need to make this a phone first in terms of design,'\" Claude Zellweger, Google's director of industrial design, said in a 2024 blog post about the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\nThe other issue is Android's limited app support for tablets. The iPad, which has strong support from Apple, sells well and gets plenty of app updates to support its wider form factor. The same can't be said for Android tablets. Many Android apps aren't optimized for wider tablet aspect ratios. It's a recurring complaint from fans and tech columnists. It doesn't help that Google hasn't put in a strong effort in the tablet space either, with the company axing its Pixel Tablet line after just one attempt.\nSo, when you tried to run Reddit or some other popular third-party apps on the Pixel Fold's wide screen, the app would have black bars on both sides, essentially running in the same aspect ratio as a typical phone. This problem persists on taller foldables as well; it just isn't as prominent.\nWho'll make a foldable that gets it right?\nDespite the anemic support for tablet apps, I'd love to see a foldable phone with the measurements of the Microsoft Surface Duo. Released in 2020, it was a half-step toward what foldable phones are today. Instead of having a foldable inner display, it was two screens bisected by a hinge. It really felt like holding a metal and glass Moleskine notebook. The inner two displays on the Surface Duo had a 4:3 aspect ratio, which is also square-like. This is largely due to its chunky inner bezels. Foldable screen tech has come a long way since. Assuming Microsoft were to make a true foldable in 2025 with minimal bezels, the inner display could have a wide 24:9 aspect ratio. It would be a beastly device for watching YouTube, Netflix or playing games. And rotating it would feed my eyes an endless scroll of Instagram Reels brainrot.\nThe likelihood of any foldable phone-maker bisecting a 16:9 or 21:9 screen is slim. Honestly, if any phone-maker could do something so daring, it'd be Apple. Rumors have been floating for some time that Apple is working on a clamshell-like foldable for 2027. If Apple does decide to jump into the world of book-style foldables, thanks to the iPad, a wide foldable iPhone would be ready to go without the need for developers to massively overhaul their apps. Assuming Apple does do a squat and wide foldable, that move would likely prompt the rest of the smartphone market to (again, I apologize for the pun), fold."
