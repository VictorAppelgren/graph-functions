  "title": "Fast charging quietly changed my life \u2014 and it might change yours too",
  "description": "Fast charging can often be an overlooked smartphone feature, but it's so much more important than you may realize.",
  "content": "How fast charging became a game-changer for me\n\nThis quickly became indispensable for work trips. It meant I could charge my phone for 15 to 30 minutes between events and meetings and be good to go for the rest of the day. Fast charging has become especially important on these trips as I often bring two or three phones, a laptop, a handheld console, and neckband earphones \u2014 but only one USB-C PD charger. It\u2019s not an issue for fast-charging devices, but it does mean that a slow-charging device like my Pixel 7 Pro can become a bottleneck when I have a queue of gadgets that need a top-up.\n\nFast charging has changed the way I use my phone, especially when I'm traveling or about to leave the house.\n\nI\u2019m also a little spontaneous when it comes to grocery shopping, and fast charging has only encouraged this habit. I\u2019ve lost count of the times I\u2019ve decided to shop at the crack of dawn, only to realize my phone\u2019s battery is low. That stops me in my tracks with my Pixel, but it\u2019s not an issue with fast-charging devices like the vivo X200 Ultra. I can plug in, get dressed, put on shoes, use the bathroom, and have at least 20 to 30% extra juice when I need to leave.\n\nFast charging also applies to one of my other gadgets. I still use a pair of OnePlus Bullets Wireless Z neckband earphones that I bought in 2020. I was enticed by the ability to get 10 hours of juice after a 10-minute charge, as I hated the idea of using a charging case. It\u2019s been roughly five years and, despite some minor battery degradation, I still use these earphones when I\u2019m doing chores or playing on my Steam Deck. That\u2019s largely due to the fast charging, which means that even if I forget to charge them, I can get serious playtime within 10 minutes. Best of all, subsequent models increase that figure to 27 hours of playback in 10 minutes.\n\nIt\u2019s not just me who feels this way\n\nColleague Ryan Haines also praised fast charging as a great addition he sometimes takes for granted: I think for me it\u2019s very much a case of \u2018I forget how much I like fast charging until I don\u2019t have it\u2019 because I can get so used to it with the Razr Ultra or a OnePlus phone. And then I go back to a Galaxy or an iPhone or a Pixel and I\u2019m like boo this STINKS. Senior Community Manager Luka Mlinar says having a charged phone is also important for his continuous glucose monitor (CGM): For me a phone is more than a phone. Having my CGM tracker topped up when leaving the house is a bit more important to me. Having the convenience to put the phone on a charger for five to 10 minutes and getting something like 30% is huge. I personally don\u2019t need fast charging 99% of the time, but that one time in a hundred can be a really big deal.\n\nMeanwhile, Android Authority contributor Tushar Mehta notes that his wife has an iPhone, and that charging doesn\u2019t ordinarily matter to her: But she also uses a Realme as a backup phone with ~100W charging, and it charges fully in about 30 minutes. She usually charges with a regular USB-C that can also work with her Mac. But every once in a while, I charge it for her with the original charger, and she\u2019s always amazed by how quickly it charges. Of course, she won\u2019t ditch her iPhone but it\u2019s just one of the ways she thinks Android is better. She says Apple will never be able to do this. \u201cFor me, the biggest relief is that I can sleep without worrying about charging my phone at night. I work from home, so that mostly wouldn\u2019t be an issue otherwise, but for days I have to step out for an event, I can get to 100% in less than an hour on most phones I have,\u201d Tushar says. \u201cEssentially, my phone charging habits have evolved significantly (and now I\u2019m spoiled).\u201d\n\nHead of Data Science and Testing Solutions, Rob Triggs, says fast charging has become indispensable: I\u2019m a chaotic person incapable of sticking to a routine, so fast charging has saved my bacon so many times that I really can\u2019t do without it. \u201cI think the key thing for the naysayers is, yes, regular charging is fine for 90% of the time, especially if you charge overnight, at your desk, or you\u2019re tethered to a power bank, etc,\u201d Rob explains. \u201cBut it\u2019s those \u2019emergency\u2019 situations where you\u2019re on empty in the middle of the day that fast charging comes into its own; dashing out the door in a hurry, grabbing a quick top-up before you board a long flight, juicing up on a short drive somewhere, etc.\u201d\n\nHowever, there is an outlier on the team. Jack-of-all-trades Jonathan Feist doesn\u2019t care for fast charging: While I appreciate the conveniences afforded by fast charging, I truly just want a charger that\u2019ll take about six hours to fill the phone so I can charge while I sleep without worrying about the downside of that strategy. If I have to choose between the two, I would opt for a bigger battery over fast charging. The super-slow charger that takes all night is only helpful if the phone makes it all the way through the day in the first place. The good news is that many phones today offer large batteries and fast charging. Furthermore, we\u2019ve seen plenty of phones with fast-charging toggles so you can activate super-fast charging only when needed. Another helpful feature we\u2019ve seen over the years is the ability for the phone to trickle-charge during the night and only hit 100% just before you need it.\n\nFast charging isn\u2019t for everyone, but it\u2019s for most people",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nWhat is a Steam Deck? Everything you need to know about Valve's console\nJanuary 30, 2025\nGamers have plenty of choices when it comes to picking a new console. While the Nintendo Switch ruled the portable gaming roost for quite some time, it\u2019s now facing new challengers. The Valve Steam Deck is one such device. But what is a Steam Deck, and which should you get if you\u2019re interested? We cover the portable console in more detail below.\nWhat is a Steam Deck, and how does it work?\nThe Steam Deck is a portable, handheld gaming console developed by Valve. In short, the console allows users to access titles from the popular gaming storefront Steam while on the go. But this isn\u2019t its only use case. Valve\u2019s console is far more versatile and user-customizable vs the Nintendo Switch.\nAlthough the console runs a Linux-based distribution by default, it can also run Windows if desired, with Valve making the necessary tools and drivers freely available. Beyond gaming, the console doubles as a portable PC replacement. It supports external controllers, mice, keyboards, monitors, and external displays when connected to a Steam Deck dock.\nWhat games can you play on a Steam Deck?\nThe Steam Deck allows users portable access to some of the best Steam games, including classics like Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Portal 2, and more. SteamDB\u2019s lists of verified and playable games are a great way of discovering which titles are supported. Steam\u2019s content library is constantly expanding, too, and with it, the Steam Deck\u2019s list of supported titles.\nHow to check if a game is compatible with Steam Deck\nSteam has also rolled out a verification system known as Deck Verified. The program indicates to users which games are fully functional on the machine, as tested by Steam staff. You\u2019ll notice one of four distinct icons located below each game\u2019s title that indicate the following:\n- A green checkmark suggests the game is verified and compatible with the Steam Deck and should run without issue.\n- A yellow circle with an i indicates that the game runs on the device effectively, but users may have to jump through a few more hoops to run it flawlessly.\n- Unsupported games will wear a gray no-entry symbol.\n- Finally, a question mark within a broken circle suggests that Steam staff hasn\u2019t yet checked the game. It may work, it may not.\nImportantly, the Steam Deck is a handheld computer, so installing third-party game launchers, like Battle.net, GOG, and the Epic Games Store, is also possible. You can also access NVIDIA\u2019s GeForce Now cloud gaming service to play heavier titles that might not run natively on the Deck\u2019s hardware.\nAlternatively, the Steam Deck runs on Steam OS, but users can install an alternative operating system to broaden game support. Installing Windows on the machine allows you access to more standalone titles or subscription programs like Xbox Game Pass. For instance, you\u2019ll also need Microsoft\u2019s OS to play Genshin Impact or Honkai: Star Rail on the Steam Deck. This is largely due to the anti-cheat systems used by HoYoVerse.\nAdditionally, if the games on Steam don\u2019t appeal to you, there are plenty of emulators for the Steam Deck for those who prefer the games of yesteryear.\nSteam Deck specs\nFind a table below detailing the core Steam Deck specs, including the original and OLED models.\n| Steam Deck 64GB | Steam Deck 256GB | Steam Deck 512GB | Steam Deck OLED | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\nOperating System | Steam Deck 64GB SteamOS | Steam Deck 256GB SteamOS | Steam Deck 512GB SteamOS | Steam Deck OLED SteamOS |\nDimensions | Steam Deck 64GB 298 x 117 x 49mm 669 grams | Steam Deck 256GB 298 x 117 x 49mm 669 grams | Steam Deck 512GB 298 x 117 x 49mm 669 grams | Steam Deck OLED 298 x 117 x 49mm ~640 grams |\nChipset | Steam Deck 64GB AMD Aerith APU system-on-chip (7nm) | Steam Deck 256GB AMD Aerith APU system-on-chip (7nm) | Steam Deck 512GB AMD Aerith APU system-on-chip (7nm) | Steam Deck OLED AMD Aerith APU system-on-chip (6nm) |\nMemory | Steam Deck 64GB 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM | Steam Deck 256GB 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM | Steam Deck 512GB 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM | Steam Deck OLED 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM |\nStorage | Steam Deck 64GB 64GB eMMC microSD | Steam Deck 256GB 256GB NVMe SSD microSD | Steam Deck 512GB 512GB NVMe SSD microSD | Steam Deck OLED 512GB/1TB NVMe SSD microSD |\nPower | Steam Deck 64GB 45W charging via USB-C 40Whr battery (estimated 2-8 hours of gameplay) | Steam Deck 256GB 45W charging via USB-C 40Whr battery (estimated 2-8 hours of gameplay) | Steam Deck 512GB 45W charging via USB-C 40Whr battery (estimated 2-8 hours of gameplay) | Steam Deck OLED 45W charging via USB-C 50Whr battery (estimated 3-12 hours of gameplay) |\nDisplay | Steam Deck 64GB 7-inch IPS LCD touchscreen 60Hz refresh rate 1280x800 resolution | Steam Deck 256GB 7-inch IPS LCD touchscreen 60Hz refresh rate 1280x800 resolution | Steam Deck 512GB 7-inch IPS LCD touchscreen 60Hz refresh rate 1280x800 resolution | Steam Deck OLED 7.4-inch HDR OLED touchscreen 90Hz refresh rate 1280x800 resolution |\nConnectivity | Steam Deck 64GB Bluetooth 5.0 Wi-Fi 5 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 3.5mm headphone jack | Steam Deck 256GB Bluetooth 5.0 Wi-Fi 5 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 3.5mm headphone jack | Steam Deck 512GB Bluetooth 5.0 Wi-Fi 5 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 3.5mm headphone jack | Steam Deck OLED Bluetooth 5.3 Wi-Fi 6E 1x USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 3.5mm headphone jack |\nExtra features | Steam Deck 64GB Carrying case | Steam Deck 256GB Carrying case Steam Community profile bundle | Steam Deck 512GB Anti-glare etched glass coating Exclusive carrying case Exclusive Steam Community profile bundle Exclusive virtual keyboard theme | Steam Deck OLED Carrying case with removable liner Steam profile bundle Exclusive startup movie Exclusive virtual keyboard theme |\nPrice | Steam Deck 64GB $399 | Steam Deck 256GB $529 | Steam Deck 512GB $649 | Steam Deck OLED 512GB: $549 1TB: $649 |\nSteam Deck performance\nThe Steam Deck is a powerful system for its size. It\u2019s not the most powerful in its category, but its balanced specs sheet ensures a solid experience across multiple games and use cases. However, users must choose the optimum graphics settings for best performance. Valve has included several settings to help users customize their gaming experience on the Steam Deck. This includes a frame rate limit toggle, a TDP limit toggle, and the inclusion of AMD\u2019s FSR (FidelityFX Super Resolution) tech, which aims to upscale game details without tanking the frame rate.\nRegarding raw processing numbers, the Steam Deck packs a GPU capable of 1.6 teraflops \u2014 more computing power than the original Xbox One but slightly less than the PS4. That\u2019s plenty of power to run most titles on the Steam library. When it comes to more demanding PC games, the device may struggle, but this is where cloud gaming services might come in handy.\nHow much does a Steam Deck cost?\n- Steam Deck LCD (256GB NVMe): $399\n- Steam Deck OLED (512GB NVMe): $549\n- Steam Deck OLED (1TB NVMe): $649\nValve originally offered consumers three Steam Deck configurations, with the cheapest version packing 64GB of eMMC storage. However, Valve has discontinued this model and the 512GB LCD model. In terms of models with LCD screens, Valve only offers the 256GB NVMe variant which costs $399.\nIn late 2023, Valve rolled out revised OLED screen models, introducing a 7.4-inch AMOLED display, a larger battery with more efficient chipset, and a 1TB storage option. It starts at $549 for the 512GB model and $649 for the 1TB model.\nWhere can you buy the Steam Deck?\nThe Steam Deck has been around for a while, but you may still have difficulty finding one beyond Valve\u2019s channels. The company says the only official way to buy the Deck is through Steam in Canada, the EU, the UK, and the US. However, you can find many of the best Steam Deck accessories beyond Valve\u2019s storefront.\nFAQs\nThe Steam Deck battery can last between two to eight hours, but performance heavily depends on the game you are playing.\nIt\u2019s tough to give a definitive answer. Generally, the Steam Deck should arrive within two weeks after you place your order, however, this window can fluctuate based on your location and the time of year that you\u2019ve ordered your Deck.\nThe Steam Deck is available to purchase through Steam; however, it rarely (if ever) fluctuates from its launch pricing scheme.\nYes, the Steam Deck has a built-in microphone.\nYes, the Steam Deck has a microSD card slot for quick storage upgrades. However, you can also replace the Steam Deck\u2019s 2230 SSD.\nThere are several ways to connect the Steam Deck to a computer to transfer files, chief of which is KDE Connect.\nYes, you can take a screenshot on the Steam Deck by pressing the STEAM and R1 buttons simultaneously.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nI test all the best Android phones every year, and these are the ones you should buy in 2025\nJuly 4, 2025\nIt\u2019s a funny thing, this idea of calling something the best. After all, everyone wants to think that their favorite of anything is the best \u2014 the best album, book, or cup of coffee \u2014 but that can\u2019t always be true. And, when you apply the idea of being the best to a category as wide open as Android phones, which can come in different shapes, sizes, and prices, the task becomes even greater.\nHowever, I think I have a pretty good idea of what makes an Android phone great. I test and review dozens of them every year, and I\u2019ve spent time with just about every phone you can get your hands on in the US (and even some that you can only buy elsewhere). And, across my many Android-fueled adventures, I\u2019ve learned to pick the qualities that make a phone worth buying. So, with that in mind, here\u2019s what I think are the best Android phones you can buy in 2025.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL: The best Android phone overall\n- Excellent build quality, refined design\n- Stunning display\n- Extensive update policy\n- Sharp, powerful cameras\n- Improved wired charging\n- Clever Gemini features\n- Tensor still runs warm\n- Confusing charging situation\n- Only 128GB base storage\nI remember when Google\u2019s Pixel phones felt like niche picks for the most dedicated Android fans. They paired clean, simple software with brilliant cameras and added a dash of fun Google design to the mix, and I always felt clever spotting one out in the wild. These days, the Pixel 9 Pro XL hangs its hat on many of the same features as its predecessors, but it\u2019s no longer a pick for those in the know \u2014 it\u2019s just the best Android phone that money can buy.\nI\u2019ve spent perhaps more time with the Pixel 9 Pro XL (and its smaller Pixel 9 Pro sibling) than anyone else at Android Authority, and it continues to find new ways to impress. Its updated design with smooth, shiny side rails and a camera bar that\u2019s become more of an island feels a little bit Apple-inspired, but in a way that makes me think the student has become the master. Granted, I\u2019ve always been a fan of Google\u2019s camera bar design, but it now feels polished and premium in a way that can stand with any other phone on the market.\nAnd, since we\u2019re already on the topic of the camera bar, let\u2019s dig into Google\u2019s impressive hardware a little further. The Pixel 9 Pro XL packs a 50MP primary sensor that\u2019s simply excellent, capturing plenty of detail and processing images with a very natural color profile thanks to the Tensor G4 chipset. Google\u2019s ultrawide and 5x optical telephoto sensor help to round out the setup with up to 30x zoom, while tricks like a revamped panorama mode and Add Me helped to earn the phone the title of best Android camera phone, too.\nWith an updated design, improved Tensor G4 chipset, and tons of AI features, the Pixel 9 Pro XL is Google's most complete phone to date.\nUpdates under the hood have helped to keep Google\u2019s top-end flagship at the front of my mind since it launched last fall. Its 16GB of RAM (with 4GB reserved for Gemini) and up to 1TB of storage space feel like clever future-proofing methods that will keep the Pixel 9 Pro XL near the top of the list as Google rolls out new AI-powered features like updates to the Pixel Studio, better support for Pixel Screenshots, and new capabilities for Gemini Live over the course of seven years of updates.\nEven the Pixel 9 Pro XL\u2019s battery and charging setup have taken a step forward, thanks in no small part to the combination of the more efficient Tensor G4 chipset and upgraded 37W wired speeds. I don\u2019t even mind that I needed to pick up Google\u2019s new USB-C Pixel charger, as I\u2019m still achieving close to two days of battery life between charges. And, with a starting price of $1,099 (or $999 for the Pixel 9 Pro), Google\u2019s best Pixel to date is a little more approachable than rivals from Samsung and Apple.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: The best ultra-tier Android phone\n- Premium materials\n- Great battery life\n- Solid cameras\n- Top-tier Snapdragon performance\n- Brilliant display\n- Excellent software policy\n- Downgraded S Pen\n- Mostly AI-based upgrades\n- Still no full Qi2 support\n- Can be uncomfortable to hold\n- Very expensive\nAs a Pixel fan, it\u2019s easy for me to hype up the Pixel 9 Pro XL as the best Android phone, but for many Samsung diehards, it\u2019s Galaxy or nothing. And, with the amount of power packed into the Galaxy S25 Ultra, I can see where they\u2019re coming from. If there\u2019s a spec you\u2019re looking for \u2014 solid charging, flexible cameras, ample RAM and storage \u2014 I\u2019d be willing to bet that Samsung\u2019s top-end option checks that box, which is why we\u2019re calling it the best ultra-tier Android phone.\nFrom the minute you take it out of the box, the Galaxy S25 Ultra feels like a tool that\u2019s ready to work. Its massive titanium frame protects panels of Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on both the front and back, and it continues to house the S Pen that\u2019s boosted productivity users since the days of the Galaxy Note lineup. Yes, Samsung simplified its built-in stylus a bit this year and took away a few features, but it remains the easiest way to take notes and doodle your way into Sketch to Image on the gorgeous 6.9-inch AMOLED panel.\nTo me, though, the Galaxy 25 Ultra stands out because of its four rear cameras. Like the previous generation, the start of the show is a huge 200MP sensor that covers much of the short-range zoom until the dual 3x and 5x optical telephoto sensors take over to push to 100x Space Zoom with a bit of help from some Galaxy AI processing. I prefer the Galaxy S25 Ultra\u2019s shots up to about the 10x zoom length, as there\u2019s barely any drop in quality, and the built-in camera filters make it easier to put some personality into your images right off the bat.\nSamsung's Galaxy S25 Ultra remains a productivity powerhouse with four rear cameras and a built-in S Pen.\nThe rest of Samsung\u2019s internals keep the Galaxy S25 Ultra well-positioned for the future, even if they come at a cost. Yes, this ultra-tier flagship starts at $1,299 \u2014 more than any of our other primary picks \u2014 but that\u2019s what you pay for an \u201cUltra\u201d phone, and for your money, you get an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, 12GB of RAM across most configurations, frequently updated Galaxy AI features, and the fastest charging that you\u2019ll currently find on a Samsug phone at 45W. But, with seven years of updates, you can stretch your time with the Galaxy S25 Ultra further than most of its rivals.\nGoogle Pixel 9a: The best Android phone under $500\n- Solid, reliable cameras\n- Excellent update commitment\n- Clever AI-powered features\n- Great battery life\n- New, streamlined design\n- Excellent price\n- Relatively slow charging\n- Aging Gorilla Glass 3 (again)\n- Missing Pixel Screenshots\nAlthough I love spending time with the biggest, most expensive flagship Android phones, I think I\u2019m ready to tell you a little secret: They\u2019re not my favorites. Instead, I think the mid-range is the best section of the Android market right now \u2014 the phones that pick up a few flagship-level features without the painful price tag. There\u2019s no better example than the slimmed-down, sped-up Pixel 9a.\nIn almost every way, the Pixel 9a is just the type of addition the larger Pixel 9 series needed. It carries over most of the great AI-powered features I mentioned falling in love with on the Pixel 9 Pro XL, like access to the Pixel Studio, using Gemini to multitask across apps, and receiving the same regular Pixel Drops as its flagship siblings. It\u2019s a bummer to see Pixel Screenshots wind up on the cutting room floor, but I\u2019ve always found screenshot management in Photos good enough that I don\u2019t mind too much.\nI love the Pixel 9a's slimmed-down design and flagship-tier features at the $500 price point.\nPerhaps the one thing that initially surprised me about the Pixel 9a was its updated design. I\u2019d seen leaks and rumors that the camera bar was going away, and I didn\u2019t want to believe it. However, since spending time with Google\u2019s most affordable model, I\u2019ve come around to the benefit of simplicity. Google didn\u2019t just axe its iconic camera bar for fun, but instead found ways to slim the internal components to free up the space to embed its cameras deeper into the body. The result is a phone that doesn\u2019t collect dust around its cameras, but still manages to have the same Google-y personality I love about Pixels.\nAlong with that refreshed design, Google gave its mid-ranger several other updates to make the $500 price tag feel like even more of a bargain. It carries the same Tensor G4 chipset as its flagship siblings, and has swapped to a wider 48MP primary camera that lets in more light for Google\u2019s brilliant image processing to play with, and it\u2019s all topped off with the largest battery on any Pixel at 5,100mAh. I called it the best $500 phone I\u2019ve ever used, and I\u2019ll stand by that until the Pixel 10a comes around.\nCMF Phone 2 Pro: The best Android phone under $300\n- Incredibly low price\n- Amazing design and display\n- Cool modular features\n- Primary, ultrawide, and telephoto lenses\n- Good update commitment\n- Not good for a US-based buyer\n- Controversial Essential Key\nMoving down another step, it\u2019s remarkable to see how far the budget Android segment has come in just a few years. I remember bashing cheap options for their lame cameras, underwhelming charging, and bland designs, and now the CMF Phone 2 Pro feels like a breath of fresh air by comparison. It\u2019s the personality-packed follow-up to one of the most interesting phones of 2024, the CMF Phone 1, and it improves on almost every aspect of the modular design without jumping the price too much.\nOf course, I should point out that it still doesn\u2019t work well in the US. Yes, you\u2019ll get some band support, but it won\u2019t completely cover any of the big three networks. That said, if you live in a supported market, or can live with some signal inconsistency, there is absolutely no better phone under $300.\nThe modular design is the most fun I\u2019ve had with a phone since Samsung brought back the flip phone with its Galaxy Z Flip lineup. The design still works the same as it did on the first CMF Phone, having you release the back panel with a series of screws before attaching different accessories like a lanyard, card holder, or a kickstand.\nCMF's Phone 2 Pro builds on a quirky, modular design in a way that's still fun to switch up every day.\nI think the coolest accessory that the team at CMF has cooked up is one that\u2019s out for Moment\u2019s lunch. The Phone 2 Pro supports new external camera lenses, which you can screw on and off the updated 50MP sensors to give them macro and fisheye functionality. It\u2019s perhaps a slightly old-fashioned take on what\u2019s usually done with software or a dedicated sensor, but I like that it means you don\u2019t have to worry about macro mode turning on and off as it senses you nearing a subject. Oh, and have I mentioned that you can give this quirky pick a try for less than $300?\nAt that price, we usually expect some pretty significant cuts to budget phones, but I think the Phone 2 Pro has managed to avoid most of the pitfalls. Its Dimensity 7300 Pro is up for most tasks, and adding the Essential Key allows the budget pick to tap into the same convenient AI journal that Nothing introduced on its recent Phone 3a duo. The upgraded IP54 rating (up from IP52) is also a nice touch, but it falls slightly behind the IP68 protection that Samsung and Motorola have started adding to their affordable options.\nSamsung Galaxy A16 5G: The best Android phone under $200\n- Stellar software update promise\n- Solid primary camera\n- Decent battery life\n- Great price\n- Good charging\n- Just-okay build quality\n- Aging performance\n- Weak peripheral cameras\n- Bland design\nThe last of our budget picks, the Galaxy A16 5G, somehow manages to dance within one of the tightest categories of Android phones. When launching for less than $200, you have to make some serious concessions on the spec sheet, yet this cheap Android option manages to check off quite a few boxes with a decent IP54 rating (matching the CMF Phone 2 Pro above), an AMOLED panel with a 90Hz refresh rate, and an in-house Exynos 1330 processor in the US. It also looks the part of a more expensive Galaxy device, pulling heavily from Samsung\u2019s streamlined flagship style.\nI spent a fair portion of my winter with the Galaxy A16 5G in my pocket, and I came away impressed more often than not. Yes, I have to put it into the context that this is merely a $200 Android phone, but sometimes good enough is all you need. Its display is bright enough in most conditions, its primary camera is flexible enough to cover day-to-day shooting in decent lighting, and its battery life is pretty solid because of the power-sipping processor. However, one thing truly adds a mountain of value to a phone that costs little more than a mole hill.\nSamsung's Galaxy A16 5G is a fine value pick boosted by an incredible update commitment.\nYes, it\u2019s Samsung\u2019s downright remarkable commitment to software updates. Despite costing about the same as a premium pair of running shoes, the Galaxy A16 5G is on tap for six years of updates across major Android patches and regular security coverage. That puts this budget option at more updates than either the OnePlus 13 or Motorola Razr Ultra can match, despite both flagships costing at least four times more.\nUltimately, that mix of value and long-term support makes the Galaxy A16 5G great for a few particular groups of people, like kids or grandparents. It makes sense for the former as you won\u2019t have to worry too much about the phone picking up scuffs or scrapes since it doesn\u2019t cost too much to repair or replace, while it makes sense for the latter as One UI probably won\u2019t change too much over the course of its many updates, making it easy for you to lend a hand as the go-to tech support person in your family.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro: The best Android camera phone\n- Impressive Gemini-powered features\n- Excellent build quality\n- Gorgeous display\n- Flexible, capable cameras\n- Reliable update commitment\n- Tensor G4 still runs hot\n- Charges slower than 9 Pro XL\n- Limited base storage\nA lazier guide would tell you to scroll back up to the Pixel 9 Pro XL \u2014 our pick for the best overall Android phone \u2014 skim that entry, and then come back here to understand why the Pixel 9 Pro also makes this list, as both phones share the same camera specs and smarts. But I\u2019d much rather take this chance to hype up one of the best pocket-sized phones you can still get your hands on. After all, this is the one phone that\u2019s made its way back into my pocket more than any other whenever I find myself between reviews, and if you don\u2019t care about having a larger screen for snaps, the Pixel 9 Pro gets you that same industry-leading camera package for under $1,000, so it\u2019ll save you some cash, too.\nGoogle\u2019s 6.3-inch flagship packs the same hardware \u2014 50MP primary, 48MP periscope telephoto, and 48MP ultrawide sensors \u2014 as the Pixel 9 Pro XL, but the smaller body makes it much easier to pull out of your pocket and grab a photo before you miss the moment. On top of that, the Pixel 9 Pro still supports all of the same AI-powered shooting modes like Add Me, the refreshed Panorama mode, and the ability to edit your shots after the fact with Magic Editor.\nWant to see the proof for yourself? You can check out a whole bunch of our camera test samples in this Google Drive.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro takes everything we loved about the XL and, well, shrinks it.\nOf course, to make its compact Pro model run smoothly, Google had to make a cut or two. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t follow the path of Apple\u2019s previous Pros, putting different telephoto sensors on each size, but instead opted for a smaller battery. The Pixel 9 Pro packs a still-solid 4,700mAh battery with 27W wired charging from the same USB-C Pixel charger I\u2019ve mentioned once or twice and 21W wireless charging from the in-house Pixel Stand. Otherwise, though, everything from the combination of aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus 2 to the top-notch build quality and the still-questionable Temperature Sensor is a perfect match for the full-sized flagship.\nMotorola Razr Ultra: The best flip-style Android foldable\n- Blisteringly fast charging and excellent battery life\n- Ultra-flagship-tier performance\n- Solid dual camera setup\n- Top-notch materials and eye-catching Pantone colors\n- Two very vibrant displays\n- Clean, simple software\n- Moto AI feels half baked\n- Limited software commitment\n- Long-range zoom kinda stinks\n- Expensive\nIt\u2019s tough to pick a flip phone as my favorite overall Android phone, but I think the Motorola Razr Ultra is about as close as any has come. After all, it\u2019s the first of its form factor to truly take the training wheels off, packing its spec sheet with Ultra-grade decisions while carefully dancing within its limits. It takes almost everything I loved about the previous flagship Razr foldable, fixes the odd camera decision I thought I\u2019d like, and then adds an extra dose of power in the form of additional RAM and Qualcomm\u2019s top-tier chipset.\nMore specifically, the Razr Ultra packs an impressive 16GB of RAM in its base configuration with 512GB of storage by default, both of which are more than any of Samsung\u2019s foldables can match. It then pairs them up with the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset and a 4,700mAh battery that towers over that of most flip phones I\u2019ve reviewed. Not only that, but Motorola\u2019s top-tier flip phone also packs a charging setup worth writing home about. The Razr Ultra ships ready to handle up to 68W wired TurboPower speeds with 30W wireless charging as a backup, at least as long as you have a capable charger. That\u2019s fast enough to run circles around everyone but OnePlus in the US, and makes an already great phone feel even better.\nThe Razr Ultra is by far the best-looking, most powerful flip phone I've ever used.\nPerhaps what wins the Razr Ultra the most points over Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Flip lineup is that I still prefer its cover screen experience. There are no hoops to jump through, no extra software to install, and no weird layouts to avoid. Yes, your apps use the entire display by default, meaning they might get cut off by the camera cutouts, but you can quickly fix that with a press of the gesture pill to compact the interface into a smaller square. On top of that, AI companions like Perplexity, Gemini, and Moto AI come optimized for the cover screen, making it easy to ask for help when needed.\nWhile I don\u2019t usually like to put too much stock into the way a phone looks \u2014 especially if I\u2019m going to put it into a case \u2014 there\u2019s no way around it on the Razr Ultra. Every colorful finish that Motorola offers comes from its close partnership with Pantone, and the different back panels offer more personality than the usual mix of Gorilla Glass can match. I reviewed the Mountain Trail version, which comes with a wooden back and a bronzed aluminum frame, but Motorola\u2019s Scarab finish is an eye-catcher with its deep green color and slightly fuzzy Alcantara back panel. I might be concerned about how it\u2019ll age in the coming years, but I can\u2019t say I\u2019ve seen anyone use materials quite like Motorola.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro Fold: The best tablet-style Android foldable\n- Impressively thin design that opens completely flat\n- Excellent displays with high brightness\n- Thoughtful enhancements to Android for foldables\n- Lots of Gemini-powered AI features\n- Seven years of update support\n- Camera setup weaker than other Pixel 9s\n- Sluggish, frustrating charging\n- Tensor G4 behind the competition for power\n- Buttons too low\n- Extremely high price\nAt long last, there\u2019s a new king of the tablet-style Android foldable phones. Yes, this was Samsung\u2019s spot to lose for a long time \u2014 partly because it was the only real option in the US for several years \u2014 and now it\u2019s happened. After an original Pixel Fold that felt like a bright idea with classic prototype flaws, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold feels ready to stand on its own two feet, or at least two sides of its hinge. Google took everything we liked about its original form factor, ironed out the quirks, and then completely reimagined its internal display for a more comfortable experience.\nWhat surprised me most about coming to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold a little late in the game is that it doesn\u2019t feel too different from the small Pixel 9 Pro, at least not when closed. As a result, I\u2019m much more willing to pull it out of my pocket for casual tasks like streaming, social media, and updating my Strava activities without feeling like I\u2019m trying to type on a knife\u2019s edge. Then, when I\u2019ve found whatever show I\u2019m desperately trying to keep up with, I\u2019m perfectly comfortable opening the nearly bezelless internal display and only losing a bit of space to letterboxing.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro Fold feels like a much larger upgrade than simply a second-year refresh.\nAlthough it\u2019s a massive leap forward for Google\u2019s foldables overall, the Pixel 9 Pro Fold isn\u2019t without its quirks. Its slim form factor means the Tensor G4 chipset has to work a little harder to vent heat, while the 4,650mAh battery is held back by just 21W wired charging \u2014 barely faster than what you get from the Pixel 9a for a third of the cost. Google\u2019s peripheral cameras feel like odd choices, too, with just a 10.8MP telephoto and 10.5MP ultrawide to hold down the newly square camera bump.\nAnd yet, I still feel like the Pixel 9 Pro Fold is the best tablet-style foldable you can get your hands on. Maybe it\u2019s because many of the Android Authority crew are Pixel fans by nature, but I feel like Google\u2019s approach to Android remains one of the cleanest and easiest to navigate, with the right mix of optimizations for the internal display. You\u2019ll also get the full suite of AI-powered features like Call Screen, Pixel Studio, and Gemini Live, just with far more real estate on which to explore them.\nOnePlus 13: The best Android phone for battery life\n- Gorgeous design\n- Incredible camera zoom and overall photography\n- Helpful AI integration\n- Excellent charging options\n- Simplified Oxygen OS experience\n- Great performance\n- Magnetic charging requires accessories\n- Fewer updates than Samsung or Google\nThese days, 5,000mAh batteries have almost become the standard on large Android flagships. Everyone is using them, from Google to Samsung to Motorola, and it\u2019s made life hard when hunting for the phone with the best battery life. However, whenever everyone seems to catch up, there\u2019s always one brand ready to jump ahead again. To nobody\u2019s surprise, it\u2019s once again the flagship killer, OnePlus. Its OnePlus 13 is a shoo-in for the best battery life, and it comes down to a no-limits combination of capacity and charging speed. Plus, it also helps that it\u2019s generally one of the best phones OnePlus has ever made.\nUp first, the cell that keeps the lights on. The OnePlus 13\u2019s 6,000mAh cell is large enough to make all but the most dedicated gaming phones feel inadequate. It\u2019s a full 1,000mAh larger than the battery Samsung tapped for its Galaxy S25 Ultra or Google chose for its Pixel 9 Pro XL, yet the OnePlus 13 is no thicker than either one. It can achieve such a remarkable capacity thanks to its switch from lithium-ion technology to silicon-carbon, a move that we\u2019d love to see the likes of Samsung copy the next time it tries an ultra-thin Edge model.\nBetter, our objective drain testing showed that the OnePlus 13 can go on and on thanks to its impressive cooling setup and efficient Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset. It does experience some pretty extreme throttling here and there, occasionally quitting out benchmarking tests in the name of thermal management, but I\u2019ve always been able to go two days between charges, so I\u2019m not complaining.\nOnePlus's 6,000mAh battery looms large over most other Android flagships.\nAnd, when you inevitably drain your OnePlus 13, SuperVOOC charging is some of the best in the business. You\u2019ll need to keep the included USB-A charger close at hand since SuperVOOC is a much different standard than USB PD PPS in terms of support, but when you watch the OnePlus 13 fly back to a 50% charge in just 13 minutes, you probably won\u2019t have an issue with it. OnePlus\u2019s latest flagship also supports 50W wireless charging through a brand-new magnetic charger with a built-in fan, though you\u2019ll need a magnetic charger and might have to use a special plastic panel to protect the Arctic Dawn finish should you choose that colorway \u2014 it\u2019s a bit of a confusing mess, and the only blot on an otherwise near-perfect package.\nASUS ROG Phone 9 Pro: Best Android phone for gaming\n- Overkill performance\n- Outstanding battery life\n- Fast, universal charging\n- Super-stable video\n- Handy AI tools\n- Expensive Pro model\n- Poor software commitment\n- Inconsistent cameras\n- No 4K recording on all lenses\nThe last of our main selections for this list of the best Android phones is one for the gamers, literally. ASUS\u2019s ROG Phone 9 Pro is about as close to a gaming laptop as you can get, at least if you can ignore that it doesn\u2019t fold in half. It has a frankly ridiculous spec sheet, offering up to 24GB of RAM with a Snapdragon 8 Elite chip under the hood and 65W wired charging that\u2019s much faster than the MacBook Air I\u2019m using to assemble this list.\nOf course, those features aren\u2019t completely unheard of in the flagship Android segment \u2014 well, 24GB of RAM is a lot \u2014 but its clever gaming tweaks set the ROG Phone 9 Pro apart. It pulls the programmable matrix from the back of the ROG Zephyrus and pairs it with pressure-sensitive triggers dotted around the frame to help you draw some of the controls off the 6.78-inch AMOLED itself. Those features, combined with the improved efficiency of the Snapdragon 8 Elite chip, had my colleague Rob Triggs gaming with a smile, pushing the ROG Phone 9 Pro as hard as he wanted to find out where its throttling point lay.\nFor what might be the first time, though, Rob also declared this to be a gaming phone he might not mind using every day. See, a lot of gaming-specific devices fall into the common trap of being too big, too edgy, and too expensive for casual usage, not to mention the fact that camera hardware almost always comes last. On the ROG Phone 9 Pro, however, you get an updated 50MP LYTIA 700 sensor for the bulk of your photography, and ASUS has reimagined its stabilization for better video shooting. The display is also brighter and smoother than before, topping out at a 185Hz refresh rate and 2,500 nits of brightness, which is more than enough for a bright, sunny day.\nThe ROG Phone 9 Pro is an elite gaming phone that's flexible enough for everyday usage.\nAlso, if you\u2019re serious about pushing the ROG Phone 9 Pro to its gaming limits (and why wouldn\u2019t you be?), ASUS has several accessories worth checking out. Rob got plenty of mileage out of the detachable controller below, though he also mentioned the external cooling setup as a helpful option when trying to game and charge simultaneously. And, if you\u2019re not set on the customizable LED matrix on the back, you can also check out the ROG Phone 9 to save a couple of bucks.\nHonorable mentions\nIf the Xiaomi 15 Ultra were just a little bit easier to access in the US, it might have earned a full spot on our list rather than simply an honorable mention, and I think it still has a legitimate claim to being the best Android camera phone. Like the last few Ultras, it\u2019s practically a mirrorless camera with a phone on the back, pairing a trio of 50MP sensors with a 200MP telephoto camera and sporting an overall design that\u2019s reminiscent of a Leica mirrorless camera to go along with Xiaomi\u2019s Leica-tuned color science.\nMaking its first full appearance on this list (CMF Phone 2 Pro not withstanding), the Nothing Phone 3a Pro is one of the most fun mid-rangers I\u2019ve reviewed in a while. Yes, it suffers from the same limited US band support as its siblings, but it\u2019s easy to fall in love with the dot-based Nothing OS skin, the light-up Glyph Interface, and the snappy 50W wired charging. I might like the more subtle camera bump on the Nothing Phone 3a a little better, but the extra zoom flexibility is a worthy tradeoff.\nOnePlus\u2019s proper 2025 flagship is more than deserving of its place as our battery king, but its mid-range option isn\u2019t far behind. Some might say that the OnePlus 13R is a bit of a 2024 flagship in disguise, and I think they\u2019d be right \u2014 in the best of ways. It pairs a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset with a OnePlus 13-esque design, housing a trio of camera sensors in its circular bump. I\u2019ll never complain about a phone with a 6,000mAh battery capacity, though it\u2019s a bit of a bummer that the included SuperVOOC charger will only get you to 55W.\nAlthough I\u2019m happy to call Motorola\u2019s latest Razr Ultra the best flip phone, it\u2019s also the most expensive. Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Flip 6, on the other hand, picks up right where the Galaxy Z Flip 5 left off, with two capable cameras, a folder-shaped Flex Window, and nabs a chipset upgrade to keep things interesting. You\u2019ll have to get used to having two app drawers if you want more than Maps, YouTube, and Google Messages at your disposal, but Samsung\u2019s full-screen widgets are simply excellent.\nIn that same vein, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 has gone from setting the standard for book-style foldables to playing second fiddle to the Pixel. It\u2019s still an excellent foldable, and its taller, thinner internal display sometimes makes a bit more sense than Google\u2019s wide aspect ratio, but it hasn\u2019t changed too much outside of a chipset upgrade in recent years, still sporting the same battery, charging setup, and cameras as the Folds that came before it.\nIf you\u2019ve spent any time looking for a great Android phone, you\u2019ll know there aren\u2019t many small ones left. Somehow, 6.5-inch or larger displays have become the standard, leaving those of us with smaller hands relegated to a precious few picks. Thankfully, the Pixel 9 is one of those, offering quite a lot of the Pro-level experience in a slightly more comfortable form factor. Its 6.3-inch display is easy to reach across yet doesn\u2019t feel so tiny that you\u2019re missing out on real estate. If we hadn\u2019t already put every other Pixel 9 device on this list, this one might have earned more than an honorable mention.\nMany of Samsung\u2019s best offerings lay it on pretty heavy with the focus on power users, and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. However, it also has the unintended benefit of making Samsung\u2019s budget-conscious picks stand out slightly more. The Galaxy S24 FE is one such option, landing just below the flagship tier with a display that nearly matches the Galaxy S25 Plus, materials like aluminum and Gorilla Glass Victus Plus that I\u2019d trust without a case, and just enough of a dip into Galaxy AI to give more users a taste of Chat Assist, Note Assist, and better photo editing tools.\nWhat to look for in a good Android phone\nWe could sit here and list the best Android phones all day \u2014 we\u2019re phone nerds, it\u2019s our job. We\u2019ll sit here and reminisce on some of the best phones from yesteryear, too, looking for any excuse to pull something fun out of the closet. However, just because we like one or two or ten things about a phone doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right for you. There\u2019s much more to consider before you splash the cash, especially if you plan to have this phone for several years.\nWe have our favorite Android phones, but the best way for you to pick one is to break it down into the features you really want.\nFor example, if you want a small, super-portable phone, something like the Galaxy S25 Ultra simply won\u2019t work, no matter how you try to wrangle it. That 6.9-inch display will always feel too big for your pocket. At the same time, it\u2019s a great phone that packs flexible cameras, a powerful chipset, and a convenient S Pen, so it\u2019s all about deciding what features you absolutely must have in a device.\nSo, with that in mind, here are a few things I always tell people to look for when buying a new phone:\n- Software updates: A phone is only as good as the number of software updates it will receive. You won\u2019t be able to change your battery, display, or camera hardware over time, so most of the value you\u2019ll pull from a phone comes from keeping it for years and years after you\u2019ve paid it off. The best way to guarantee some of that value is with a Pixel or Galaxy device set for seven years of patches, though Motorola and OnePlus are catching up with four and five years of support at their flagship levels.\n- Camera flexibility: If you\u2019re after one of the best Android phones on the market, you probably have high camera expectations. It\u2019s perfectly understandable \u2014 you\u2019ll probably capture your life with this device for several years. And, as you might have noticed, single-camera Android phones aren\u2019t a thing anymore. So, if you prioritize a great camera phone, you\u2019ll want to keep an eye on things like sensor size, telephoto focal length, and how your phone processes images after the fact.\n- Display size: As mentioned above, finding a small Android phone is easier said than done these days. There aren\u2019t many 6.1-inch or 6.2-inch options left, with premium picks like the Pixel 9 Pro XL and Galaxy S25 Ultra measuring close to 7 inches, and many budget to mid-range options measuring 6.5 inches or larger. Also, if display size is no issue (or you want a phone that can check two boxes at once), you might consider a foldable that can take over for a tablet, too.\n- RAM and storage options: Depending on your needs, you might also want to monitor the RAM and storage that your chosen Android phone comes with. At one point, 8GB of RAM was enough to tackle everything from web browsing to gaming to streaming a full season on Netflix, but no longer. With the explosion of AI-powered features, 12GB is closer to the bare minimum for flagships, while the Pixel 9 Pro series feels even more capable with 16GB across the board.\n- To fold or not to fold: Foldable Android phones remain one of the most exciting categories in tech, at least to me. They\u2019ve improved by leaps and bounds in recent years, picking up better cameras, thinner hinges, and better protection against water and dust. However, you\u2019ll still have to weigh out whether or not you have the budget to try something new and if you can live with a spec sheet that hasn\u2019t caught up just yet.\n- Durability: These days, phones feature more premium materials than ever, sometimes pairing aluminum and titanium frames with advanced glasses like Panda Glass and Gorilla Glass or interesting textures like vegan leather and, in the case of the Razr Ultra, Alcantara. My advice would be to think about what materials you want and whether or not you plan to put your phone in a case. Also, keep in mind that IP68 ratings against water and dust have become the standard for many flagships, so think twice before settling for a lower rating, even if it saves money.\n- Charging speed: It\u2019s no longer a surprise to see phones ship with 5,000mAh batteries \u2014 in fact, it\u2019s expected on phones of a certain size. However, with great power capacity comes great responsibility, so you\u2019ll want to keep an eye on the charging speeds that your new phone supports. Some, like OnePlus, offer up to 80W speeds with the correct charger, while others, like the Galaxy S25, won\u2019t go above 25W no matter how hard you try. Also, if you opt for something like the Pixel 9 Pro XL, you\u2019ll need Google\u2019s in-house USB-C charger to guarantee the best speeds, so you might need to budget for some extra charging accessories.\n- AI features: One last thing worth watching \u2014 and probably the least essential of my picks \u2014 is the list of AI features your new phone will support. If you opt for a flagship Pixel or a Galaxy S25, you\u2019ll get a pretty solid set of Gemini and Galaxy AI picks, while the OnePlus 13 and Motorola Razr lineup might lag behind just a bit. Then again, you might find that the available features don\u2019t quite mesh with your usage or don\u2019t feel quite polished enough, so you may also be able to get by with Circle to Search and some of the other features that have made their way to lower price points.\nWhy you should trust me\nI\u2019m a phone guy \u2014 always have been. I can still rattle off every device I\u2019ve ever purchased with my own money, and I continue to hold the LG G3 as one of my favorite phones of all time. I stayed almost perfectly true to Android ever since my parents got me my first smartphone after I made it to high school, at least as long as you\u2019re willing to forgive the few years I spent with an iPhone 7 when I let green bubble bullying get the best of me.\nSince then, I\u2019ve made my love of phones into my day job, shifting my personal SIM more times than I can count and spending time with everything from the Motorola Moto G Play (2021) to the OnePlus Open to the Galaxy S25 Ultra in my pocket. I won\u2019t pretend to have loved every phone I\u2019ve reviewed \u2014 you have to break a few eggs to make an omelet \u2014 but I\u2019ve taken highlights away from each one and come to appreciate Android options both high and low.\nI review dozens of Android phones every single year, and my personal SIM moves around enough to qualify for frequent flyer status.\nFurther, my opinions come from more than simply running around with a new phone in my pocket. Part of my role as a reviewer is to work closely with my colleague, and our resident testing expert, Rob Triggs, to come up with objective metrics by which we can compare devices. We\u2019ve worked closely to cook up tests for battery life and charging, along with a nicely standardized set of ways to put CPUs and GPUs through their paces long before I ever sit down to write a review. Do I still count my hands-on experience? Of course I do, but I also like to ensure that data backs them up. If you want more information on our testing procedures, you can read our full methodology at the link.\nWhat do you look for in an Android phone?\nSometimes, my need to be thorough means that I\u2019m not the first reviewer to press the publish button, and I\u2019m rarely the shortest and sweetest among my peers, but I don\u2019t mind. I\u2019ll happily cause a little bit of a headache for my editor (shout out to you, Ollie) if it means I know I\u2019m being as thorough as possible. Besides, with how far phones have come in just the last few years, I\u2019m not sure how anyone could put together a review without stopping and taking a few stretch breaks.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nThe OnePlus 13 is finally a OnePlus flagship I trust to do it all\nFebruary 27, 2025\nOnePlus 13\nMSRP: $899.99\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nOnePlus 13\nOnePlus flagships have put me in a tricky spot over the last few years. For as much as I\u2019ve liked them and wanted to recommend them wholeheartedly, they\u2019ve always come with a pretty major caveat or two. From skipping an official IP rating to adding and removing wireless charging in back-to-back generations, there\u2019s always been something for me to question. Now, with its 2025 Android flagship, both wireless charging and IP ratings are back, but in my head, the damage is done \u2014 I still go into every OnePlus review waiting for the other shoe to drop.\nOnly this time, with the OnePlus 13, that shoe hasn\u2019t dropped yet. In fact, after the better part of a month with the phone, I\u2019ve found myself liking it more and more. The $100 price hike over the OnePlus 12 may sting for some, but don\u2019t let that put you off: this phone has stepped up to the plate time and time again and surprised me in places where previous OnePlus flagships have let me down. Here\u2019s what the OnePlus 13 gets so right.\nNo more chasing waterfalls\nI should have known something was different about the OnePlus 13 from the moment I took it out of its signature red box. Why? Well, for starters, this flagship doesn\u2019t come in OnePlus\u2019s classic green finish. No, the color that I\u2019ve looked forward to just about every year since the launch of the OnePlus 8 is nowhere to be found. And, perhaps more surprisingly, I don\u2019t mind that one bit.\nI don\u2019t mind what might otherwise seem like a massive change for OnePlus because I think the color that replaced its ever-reliable green is even better. OnePlus traded its lightly textured back panel of glass for soft eco-leather in a new Midnight Blue finish, and it almost feels like a crime to cover it with a case \u2014 though you\u2019ll probably still want to for a reason I\u2019ll come back to in a moment. It\u2019s just the right shade of blue to offset the white camera bump and silver aluminum frame nicely, with only a thin silver strip and Hasselblad logo to interrupt the otherwise fingerprint-free material.\nIt doesn't come in green, but I like OnePlus's new Midnight Blue enough to leave my phone case behind.\nOf course, Midnight Blue isn\u2019t your only option for the OnePlus 13 \u2014 it also comes in a white Arctic Dawn and a Black Eclipse meant to imitate wood grain, which is much more fun than a slippery slab of glass. Both are made of glass, but OnePlus\u2019s clever texturing makes them feel much different in the hand. Anyway, no matter which color you pick, the rest of the OnePlus 13\u2019s design looks and feels just as good. The Alert Slider remains in its rightful place, high on the left side of the device, while the power and volume controls sit opposite on the right side of the now flattened frame.\nThat flat, almost iPhone-like frame is another sign that the times are changing for OnePlus. By that, I mean this is the most comfortable OnePlus phone to hold in several years. Unlike the last few generations, which have sported increasingly steep waterfall displays that meet razor-thin metal frames, the OnePlus 13 is comfortably flat all around. I should say that it\u2019s a comfortable mix of flat where you want it, with curves where you need them.\nFor me, that means the eco-leather back panel meets the aluminum frame with an almost seamless edge, as does the now flat 6.82-inch AMOLED display. Yes, this is a OnePlus flagship with a flat display for the first time in a long time. I haven\u2019t accidentally pressed the edge of the display one single time in my month with the OnePlus 13, and I couldn\u2019t be happier about it. And yes, I realize this is only the latest example in a long line of Android flagships ditching the waterfall display for a much more usable flat panel, but it\u2019s worth praising every time.\nActually, OnePlus has nailed down the best of both worlds, as its Ceramic Guard glass still has slightly rounded edges that meld it seamlessly into the frame. Or, they would meld seamlessly if not for the plastic screen protector that comes preinstalled on the OnePlus 13 but doesn\u2019t extend across the rounded edges.\nThe display itself is impressive, too, becoming the first to secure an A++ rating from DisplayMate. To my naked eye, that doesn\u2019t mean much, but I can say that everything I\u2019ve tried on the Quad HD Plus display has looked excellent. From pulling what feels like my 50th Pikachu in Pokemon TCG Pocket to watching the pitch-black Nosferatu trailer ahead of a New Year\u2019s Eve screening, the OnePlus 13 has been excellent. It hasn\u2019t been my favorite way to keep up with the Premier League\u2019s festive fixtures, but that\u2019s probably more due to Chelsea\u2019s lack of finishing than any actual struggle with the OnePlus 13\u2019s display.\nAnd then, there\u2019s the OnePlus 13\u2019s durability. After several years of calling lesser IP ratings good enough or skipping them entirely, the OnePlus 13 has stormed back in impressive waterproofing fashion. It\u2019s not only IP68 rated (yes, officially), but it\u2019s also IP69 certified against jets of water at up to 1,450PSI and temperatures up to 176 degrees Fahrenheit (around 80 degrees Celsius). That means you can toss your OnePlus 13 in the dishwasher or washing machine after a particularly messy day, and it\u2019ll come out the other side working just as good as new. I\u2019m still not sure I\u2019d love to put my phone through the spin cycle for an hour or more, but I guess it\u2019s nice to have the option.\nMeet the new Oxygen OS, more like the old Oxygen OS\nWhile most of my recent issues with OnePlus phones have come from odd hardware decisions, the gradual evolution of Oxygen OS caused its own complaints. In my eyes, it just kept inching closer and closer to OPPO\u2019s Color OS, gradually losing the things that made me appreciate Oxygen OS in the first place. Light, simple animations were replaced with heavier ones, duplicate (or redundant) apps exploded, and the whole experience felt a bit more like a version of Android that we usually associate with Chinese devices.\nBut now, with Oxygen OS 15, it feels like OnePlus is turning back to many things that users liked in the first place. From the minute I fired up the OnePlus 13, I couldn\u2019t help feeling like it was a much lighter experience than I\u2019d used on the last few devices. The widgets look simpler, the settings menu is easier to navigate, and the home screen populates with, well, not much at all \u2014 just how I like it.\nThere are still shades of Color OS, but OnePlus's version of Android 15 finally has some personality again.\nOf course, the more important development in the Android 15-based Oxygen OS 15 is that OnePlus is finally entering the AI race. After it surprised us by not talking about AI at all on the previous OnePlus 12, new features are everywhere this time around. Honestly, they\u2019re pretty similar to what you\u2019d find on most other flagships these days \u2014 there\u2019s an AI note taker, a magic composer, and Circle to Search makes its debut \u2014 but OnePlus has a few helpful wrinkles, too.\nI particularly like the idea behind Pass Scan, which allows you to take a picture of a physical boarding pass or train ticket and upload it into your Google Wallet. Personally, it\u2019s been a few years since I used a paper boarding pass, but I could see how this would be helpful if you were traveling in a group and wanted to keep several boarding passes safely together. OnePlus also added a few other AI-powered camera features, which we\u2019ll return to in a second.\nAlso, it\u2019s not necessarily an AI feature, but Oxygen OS 15 introduces OnePlus\u2019s version of Apple\u2019s Dynamic Island, which it calls Live Alerts. On the surface, it looks like a simple copy of one of the more confusing iPhone features, but the more I\u2019ve explored OnePlus\u2019s approach, the better I like it. It\u2019s both easier to interact with \u2014 a simple tap opens a larger widget rather than opening a full app \u2014 and disappears into nothing when you\u2019re done with it rather than shrinking into the still-too-large notch replacement that lives on iPhones these days.\nOh, and the OnePlus 13 also marks the first time that Open Canvas has appeared outside of the OnePlus Open, and I couldn\u2019t be happier. The multi-tile approach to multitasking makes it much easier for me to copy and paste notes into Slack or drag camera samples into an email to myself, and I never have to worry about cramming apps into smaller halves of the OnePlus 13\u2019s display.\nUnfortunately, though, there\u2019s still one problem with Oxygen OS: OnePlus\u2019s update commitment. Even though it feels like OnePlus has nailed the rest of its cleaned-up, simplified interface, I don\u2019t love that the OnePlus 13 is only in line for four years of Android updates and six years of security patches. Samsung and Google have committed to seven years of support, making that the standard I\u2019d expect for a premium flagship like this.\nYou don\u2019t need fancy branding to perform like a Pro\nDespite my previous problems with hardware and software \u2014 well, parts of both \u2014 one thing I\u2019ve never really questioned from OnePlus has been power. After all, it\u2019s always packed its flagship devices with the latest Qualcomm chipsets and more than enough RAM for checking email and playing a few light games. As Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson put it, \u201cIt\u2019s about drive, it\u2019s about power,\u201d and OnePlus has usually been happy to supply both. So, when I heard that the OnePlus 13 would be carrying the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset under the hood, I was all too ready to put it through our gauntlet of tests.\nSo, I did what I always do \u2014 I loaded up our slate of CPU and GPU-intensive benchmarks and sat back to see what would happen. Maybe it\u2019s because this was my first experience with a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, but the results floored me. I stacked OnePlus\u2019s latest flagship against several of what I thought would be its closest competitors: Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 Pro, Google\u2019s Pixel 9 Pro XL, OPPO\u2019s Find X8 Pro, and Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 Ultra. No, none of them pack the same updated chipset from which the OnePlus 13 benefits, but they should be about as close as I could get.\nWell, the OnePlus 13 more than held its own against them. Although it came up just short of Apple\u2019s A18 Pro in single-core performance, it blazed past it (and the rest of the competitors) in multi-core performance. More impressive to me, though, was the way the OnePlus 13 handled our GPU-intensive Wild Life stress test. It started the first run higher than any phone I\u2019ve ever used \u2014 scoring around 25,000 \u2014 before settling at around 16,000 by the end of its run, significantly higher than any of its competitors. By the way, if you want a much deeper explanation into how all of the latest chipsets stack up against each other, we put them together into a video which you can watch here.\nOf course, there\u2019s only so much that a controlled set of benchmarking numbers can tell you about a phone. Sure, the OnePlus 13 looks great on paper, but how does it stack up in day-to-day usage? Well, it\u2019s pretty good there, too. It\u2019s breezed through my varied days of music streaming, light gaming, and plenty of college football bowl game coverage over the holidays.\nBecause I headed home for the holidays, I often found myself without the comforts of my apartment \u2014 my own TV, a quiet room, you get the idea \u2014 but the OnePlus 13 was perfectly happy to cruise through whatever I asked, thanks, in part to parallel animation processing, which allows the phone to start one screen-heavy process before fully ending another. It\u2019s kind of like those clips where you see someone open and exit every app on their phone to slow it down, but I\u2019ve found that it works pretty well when I\u2019m trying to split my attention span into several different directions.\nBut, with great power comes a great responsibility to keep one\u2019s battery from dying too quickly. So, another significant part of our benchmarking process is to drain the OnePlus 13\u2019s 6,000mAh battery \u2014 almost a full 1,000mAh more than the Pixel 9 Pro XL or Galaxy S24 Ultra \u2014 to see how long it might last. This time, though, the OnePlus 13 fought back against me. Its optimizations thwarted my battery drain at every turn, leaving me without good, clean numbers to add to a graph. Once I figure out a way around OnePlus\u2019s ruthless efficiency, I\u2019ll report back with some official battery numbers, but for now, you have to trust my real-life experience.\nThe Snapdragon 8 Elite's performance is good, but somehow OnePlus's optimization is even better.\nAnd, on that front, this 6,000mAh battery is a beast \u2014 but not only in the way I first expected. Unlike most smartphone batteries that we\u2019re used to, which are called lithium-ion batteries, the OnePlus 13 is the first flagship to hit the US market with a silicon battery. I\u2019ll save some of the science for this silicon battery breakdown, but basically, what it means is that the OnePlus 13\u2019s battery offers greater energy density, allowing for a higher capacity cell to fit in the same physical space, leading to some of the battery gains I later discovered.\nI was first handed my OnePlus 13 review unit on a Royal Caribbean cruise, where power outlets and reliable internet service are notoriously tough to come by. In my head, both of those things meant that the OnePlus 13 would probably struggle and likely warm up in my hand when asked to do too much of anything. Once again, it did not. Instead, I\u2019ve found the phone almost frustratingly hard to drain in my day-to-day life. Granted, things like Spotify, Pokemon TCG Pocket, and streaming football games aren\u2019t too intense, but I haven\u2019t found many other reasons for adventure during the holidays.\nBut when I finally drained the OnePlus 13 after about two days of consistent usage, it was time to bust out my old friend, the 80W USB-A SuperVOOC charger. Once again, I\u2019ll ask, \u201cWhy are we still doing this in early 2025, OnePlus?\u201d Sure, I\u2019m glad the phone comes with a charger, but I\u2019d be much happier with a USB-C block and cable. After all, it\u2019s more likely for my friends to have USB-C chargers for me to borrow if I happen to forget my SuperVOOC charger while out and about.\nAnyway, when you finally need your charger, the OnePlus 13\u2019s 80W wired charging speeds \u2014 in the US, of course, it charges at 100W internationally \u2014 are excellent. They continue to run circles around most of OnePlus\u2019s competitors, filling the massive cell in just about half an hour compared to the full hour needed for the Galaxy S24 Ultra, 75 minutes for the Pixel 9 Pro XL, or 100 minutes for the iPhone 16 Pro (which has the smallest battery of the bunch).\nAlso, if you prefer to charge without wires, the OnePlus 13 supports up to 50W AirVOOC wireless charging, complete with an in-house alternative to Qi2 or MagSafe. Remember when I said you\u2019d probably want to keep your OnePlus 13 in a case? That was because OnePlus has a new set of magnetic cases and a new magnetic AirVOOC charger.\nEssentially, rather than putting a ring of magnets in the back of its phone, thus adding weight and thickness, OnePlus has made them entirely optional via the cases, which you can then attach to its new high-speed charger, which also packs a cooling fan to keep your OnePlus 13 comfortable while you charge it back up. I still prefer the blistering speed of OnePlus\u2019s SuperVOOC charging to the convenience of a wireless fill-up, though, but only because it gives me the best chance to get back on the go.\nI think OnePlus has a shot at the Android camera crown\nMost days, you\u2019ll find me with Google\u2019s Pixel 9 Pro in my pocket, no matter what I am reviewing. It simply offers the best mix of processing with overall camera flexibility \u2014 I trust it when I need to pull out my phone and grab a shot in a hurry. So, for me to say that I\u2019ve been ditching it recently in favor of the OnePlus 13 means that something must be up. And yes, it is. Right now, in the fifth year of OnePlus\u2019s partnership with Hasselblad, the results are better than ever, thanks to upgraded hardware and well-placed use of AI.\nBefore we get to that new processing, though, we should probably start with OnePlus\u2019s updated camera sensors. While the circular camera bump might look almost identical to its predecessor\u2019s, the OnePlus 13 packs refreshed hardware for its telephoto and ultrawide cameras, making them thinner and reshuffling the megapixels. On the 3x optical telephoto sensor, OnePlus cut from 64MP to 50MP but increased the size of the sensor itself, allowing for better light capture. On the other hand, the ultrawide sensor added two megapixels, bumping from 48 to an even 50 and expanding from a 114-degree field of view to 120 degrees.\nAnyway, let\u2019s get to some samples so you can see what one of the best Android camera phones is capable of.\nPersonally, I\u2019m pretty pleased with all four of the shots above. As you can probably tell, they all came from the Royal Caribbean cruise on which I received the OnePlus 13, but they show off four distinct strengths of the camera setup. I\u2019m particularly impressed by the ultrawide shot of the ship from our day on shore, as it establishes the scale of modern cruise ships nicely while bringing out the incredibly vivid colors of the Royal Caribbean logo.\nI was also somewhat surprised by my selfie with my unaware friend in the background. I expected the sun to destroy the image with glare, but the OnePlus 13 seems to have minimized the sun nicely, allowing for a perfectly usable shot. Sure, there\u2019s still some glare around the sun, but it adds to the overall color profile rather than washing us out.\nUp next, a few more familiar scenes and faces. Because I was given the phone at a media event, I figured I\u2019d take the chance to grab portraits of a few familiar faces, including Michael Fisher (YouTube\u2019s Mr. Mobile) passionately talking about a boat or Brooklyn, New York, or something. Given the just-okay lighting at the bar we were sitting in front of, I was pretty impressed with how well the OnePlus 13 could pick out the edges of his hair against the dark bricks and the tree behind him.\nInterestingly, OnePlus\u2019s approach to HDR in low light doesn\u2019t translate very well once removed from the phone itself, so it\u2019s much harder to pick out some of the details around the glowing blue Top Golf logo in the second picture. That said, I\u2019m reasonably impressed with how well the OnePlus 13 restricted the blue glow to right near the neon itself rather than blowing out parts of the wall or the palms in front of the sign itself.\nPerhaps the closest thing to a miss I came up with in my shots above is the view from the airplane window on my way to CES 2025. It didn\u2019t exactly nail the focus on any one point, so as much as I like the composition of the shot, I would have appreciated a bit more sharpness on my fellow passenger or the clouds.\nUp next, another camera feature I was initially skeptical of: Long-range zoom. See, OnePlus has offered up to 120x zoom on its flagships for a year or two now, but it previously struggled with just about anything past 30x. So, when the OnePlus 13 arrived with the same maximum of 120x, I figured I\u2019d try it once or twice and laugh at the sharpening or lack thereof. I was, again, wrong.\nAlthough there\u2019s a noticeable shift in the color profile once you\u2019ve switched to OnePlus\u2019s tri-prism telephoto sensor, the way it holds onto detail is nothing less than remarkable. I figured that the closer I got to the name of the yacht in Miami\u2019s harbor, the worse the text and details would look, but the OnePlus 13 held on pretty well. You can still easily make out the silver balls along the ship\u2019s railing and the small stains where the rainwater runs down from each letter. Since Google\u2019s Pixel 9 Pro and Apple\u2019s iPhone 16 Pro call it quits around 30x, OnePlus might have a claim of being the best Android flagship for long-range photos unless you\u2019re willing to splurge on Samsung\u2019s more expensive Galaxy S24 Ultra.\nMore impressive than the performance of the sensors themselves, though, is OnePlus\u2019s new set of shooting modes. In most cases, I dread pulling my phone out to capture a concert or snap a shot of fireworks on New Year\u2019s Eve, but OnePlus has once again given me an exception. It\u2019s added tuned Smart Modes for stage performances, fireworks, and silhouette shots, which automatically adjusts your image\u2019s ISO for the clearest result. At first, I figured the final photos would come out heavily processed and AI-ified, but I\u2019m pretty happy to have been proven wrong.\nOf the three shots above, the one in the center is my favorite. I was sitting at a concert with a friend and pulled up the OnePlus 13 to grab a quick shot of the guitarist from Low Cut Connie, expecting very little of it. Instead, every last bit of him is crisp and detailed. Granted, if you look at the singer in white in the background, there\u2019s a bit more motion blur, but I was very impressed to get the normally animated guitarist in a moment where he was standing still.\nThe Smart Mode for fireworks turned out decently as well, though it\u2019s another one where you have to look at the subject (the red explosion) and the surrounding clouds while ignoring a few of the taller buildings along Baltimore\u2019s skyline. Although the firework looks excellent, most buildings are tougher to make out, having been reduced to their lights and mostly blending in with the black sky.\nAnd then, there\u2019s the new set of AI image-processing tools. Honestly, most of what OnePlus has come up with feels very similar to what Google offers on its Pixel lineup, with an option to unblur faces and sharpen details when cropping in on an image, but OnePlus has one tool to go a little further. It\u2019s called the AI Reflection Eraser, and it does pretty much what it describes. It can be challenging to grab a clear shot through a window \u2014 whether looking in or out \u2014 so the OnePlus 13 can apply special processing to remove the glare while enhancing what might have been distorted behind it.\nLast but certainly not least, we have video. Once again, OnePlus\u2019s motto seems to be that more is always more, as its flagship offers 4K Dolby Vision HDR recording at up to 60fps across all cameras, including the selfie camera. I\u2019ve been pretty impressed by the quality so far, never feeling like I was short on detail or let down by poor stabilization \u2014 OnePlus is finding ways to do it all.\nIf you want a closer look at the camera samples above (and plenty more to showcase the impressive zoom capabilities), you can check out a larger gallery in this Google Drive folder.\nOnePlus 13 review verdict: My new favorite Android phone?\nFor a guy who went into yet another OnePlus review expecting something to disappoint me, I have to admit that\u2019s not what happened at all. Everywhere I\u2019ve struggled in the past, OnePlus has finally come up with an answer on the OnePlus 13. No IP rating? This time, you get not one but two. No wireless charging? Now, you can choose whether or not you want magnets on the back of your phone. Software that feels more and more like an OPPO clone? Oxygen OS 15 finally brings back some personality. It\u2019s almost like OnePlus made a little note each time I found something to complain about and turned all of my issues into one of the best Android phones I\u2019ve used in a long time.\nHonestly, that\u2019s just addressing my complaints \u2014 it\u2019s not even considering the ways that OnePlus already delivered some pretty great features. Once again, the OnePlus 13 charges like a bullet, filling a massive 6,000mAh cell in half the time of a Samsung device that costs several hundred dollars more. It also packs a fifth-generation Hasselblad-tuned camera setup that\u2019s become my go-to in several situations and will probably stay that way after I move on to my next review. Oh, and the 6.82-inch AMOLED display ties it all together in a bright, bold, and, most importantly, flat package \u2014 so long, waterfall displays, I won\u2019t miss you.\nI waited for the OnePlus 13 to stumble or struggle, and it just hasn't happened. This is one of the best Android phones I've used in a long time.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, the OnePlus 13 has its quirks. It still comes with fewer Android and security updates than its closest rivals and ships with a bulky USB-A block in early 2025. To some, the decision to keep the magnetic Qi2 alternative in accessories and use scratchable eco-leather for the back panel might feel like a misstep, too, but I\u2019m a fan of both choices. Besides, while I might complain about a slightly inconvenient charger, I certainly won\u2019t complain about 80W wired speeds.\nAnd yet, I know that some people will be a bit harder to convince to try the OnePlus 13. For many, it will be impossible to pull them out of the Samsung or Google ecosystem that they\u2019ve gotten used to, even though the OnePlus 13 undercuts its rivals by at least $100 in most cases. For many, though, that\u2019s not a bad place to be.\nBefore I get to those non-OnePlus alternatives, though, I should point out that the OnePlus 13 didn\u2019t launch alone. Instead, it launched at the same time as the more affordable (but still impressive) OnePlus 13R ($599.99 at OnePlus). At a glance, the upper-midrange offering looks quite a lot like its true flagship counterpart, though it packs the older Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset under the hood and trades its eco-leather back panel for Gorilla Glass Victus 2. It also has a slightly smaller display and a lower-resolution 8MP ultrawide sensor as ways to keep the price a bit more approachable, but you still get the same Oxygen OS 15 experience and reliably fast wired charging. We\u2019ll be reviewing the OnePlus 13R separately very soon.\nPrior to reviewing the OnePlus 13, Google\u2019s Pixel 9 Pro ($799 at Amazon) had a permanent place in my pocket for basically everything that this flagship now does just as well. I can\u2019t help but love Google\u2019s light, playful version of Android, and I\u2019ll still put its Tensor-powered image processing right up there with the best of them. Our best phone of 2024 winner also has a few advantages over the OnePlus 13, notably in its faster and longer-lasting updates. I\u2019ve compared Google\u2019s latest flagships to everything from the best iPhones ever made to the small Android phone that I\u2019d been longing for, and if you\u2019re still not sure about a sweeping 6.82-inch display on your next phone, I\u2019d still send you into the waiting arms of the Pixel 9 Pro.\nHowever, if you want a slightly bigger phone, the Pixel 9 Pro XL ($1099 at Amazon) also fits the bill for all the reasons mentioned above. I\u2019d also steer you to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 Ultra ($1419.99 at Amazon) \u2014 another device I\u2019ve referenced throughout this review. It\u2019s big, powerful, and ready to keep you productive, thanks to its built-in S Pen. That same stylus means that Samsung\u2019s top-end traditional flagship won\u2019t work with any magnetic case, so you\u2019ll have to make do with more traditional charging options. More importantly, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is one flagship that can give OnePlus\u2019s improved camera zoom a run for its money thanks to 100x Space Zoom from its dual-telephoto setup. Just remember that we expect the next Galaxy S25 Ultra to be right around the corner and offer upgraded specs similar to the OnePlus 13.\nOf course, the hardest thing for the OnePlus 13 to do will be to win over long-time iPhone users. While some bits of Oxygen OS 15 feel a bit more like iOS 18, like the redesigned quick settings menu, it still comes without features like iMessage and FaceTime that will keep iPhone fans reaching for the iPhone 16 Pro ($999 at Amazon) instead. Furthermore, Apple\u2019s video recording might still have a bit of an edge over the OnePlus 13, and its longer-lasting update commitment makes four years of major updates seem a bit short.\nYet, if you\u2019re willing to take the plunge and give the OnePlus 13 a try, it will reward you with great camera shots, impressive battery life, and a design that\u2019s as durable as they come.\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nUSB Power Delivery explained: What you need to know about ubiquitous charging\nApril 2, 2025\nFast charging is a godsend when our gadgets run low on juice. However, there are numerous fast charging standards in existence today, making it difficult to pick the right charger for your smartphone, laptop, or even external monitor. Furthermore, while most gadgets historically shipped with an adapter in the box, many brands are now asking you to bring your own. Luckily, USB Power Delivery (USB PD) is a universal charging specification that allows you to sidestep the confusing and fragmented phone charger market altogether.\nHere\u2019s everything that you need to know about USB Power Delivery and what it means for your gadgets.\nUSB Power Delivery: What you need to know\nUSB Power Delivery is a common fast-charging standard that can be implemented in all USB-powered gadgets. USB PD has actually been around since 2012, around the same time that the USB-C port was unveiled. Prior to that, the only universal option was the (significantly slower) USB Battery Charging specification.\nThe humble USB-C port is pretty complicated and can support several different levels of charging. And that\u2019s before manufacturers add proprietary capabilities on top of that.\nTo start with, all USB ports dating back decades support a very basic level of charging at just 5V and up to 500mA, with more modern ports supporting 5V and 900mA of current. This is based on legacy support and is very slow to charge all but most low-power gadgets. USB-C ports can be configured with 5V 1.5A and 3A for up to 15W of power, which is a bit quicker but still rather slow compared to other fast-charging standards.\nUSB Power Delivery is much more powerful, supporting up to 240W of power to charge up even the most demanding gadgets such as laptops. It\u2019s also safer, as gadgets and chargers communicate with each other over the USB cable to confirm the optimal charging power level. This handshaking approach supports voltage steps at 5V, 9V, 15V, 20V, and beyond for power outputs ranging from 0.5W to 240W.\nThe newer USB Power Delivery Programmable Power Supply (USB PD PPS) standard supports configurable voltages too, enabling more optimal charging. If two devices fail to communicate a suitable power rule, USB Power Delivery will default to the next power option supported by the relevant USB protocol, such as USB-C 1.5A.\nThe latest USB PD revision can deliver up to 240W of power for demanding gadgets like laptops.\nUSB Power Delivery is now commonly used to fast-charge smartphones, laptops, and other gadgets. Examples include the entire line-up of Google Pixel phones, Apple\u2019s iPhone and MacBooks. Even Samsung\u2019s Super Fast Charging is based on USB PD PPS, which is great news for cross-compatibility.\nA huge range of other smartphones support the standard too, often in addition to their faster proprietary standards. Many OnePlus smartphones, for example, support between 18 to 27W charging over USB PD. That\u2019s in addition to the company\u2019s own Warp Charge or Oppo\u2019s SuperVOOC technology.\nIs a USB type-C to type-C cable necessary for Power Delivery?\nWhile the first revision of Power Delivery did technically work with standard USB Type-A ports, very few devices supported this functionality. These days, you\u2019ll find most devices that rely on Power Delivery use USB Type-C or USB-C on both ends. This is also why most smartphones these days ship with USB-C to USB-C cables in the box. You can still use a Type-A to USB-C cable for charging but expect slower speeds.\nUSB Power Delivery versions compared\nWith USB Power Delivery now in its third revision, the standard is broken down into devices with slightly different capabilities. Although modern versions of the standard are backward compatible with older gadgets and chargers.\nUSB PD 1.0 was a little more basic than the modern version. It simply offered six fixed power profiles for different device categories. This version supports 10W (5V, 2A), 18W (12V, 1.5A), 36W (12V, 3A), 60W (12V, 5A), 60W (20V, 3A), and 100W (20V, 5A) of power exclusively. That\u2019s OK, but not exactly flexible for a wide range of gadgets, including small smartphone batteries that prefer lower voltage charging.\nThe more modern USB Power Delivery 2.0 and 3.0 variations drop fixed profiles in favor of more flexible power rules. These rules keep fixed voltage brackets but allow for a wider range of negotiated current levels. The end result is a standard that\u2019s better suited to a wide range of devices. USB Power Delivery 3.0 also extends the communication protocol to support features like battery condition, enhanced security, and fast role swapping.\n| USB PD Power Range | Fixed Voltage | Current Range | Example devices |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| USB PD Power Range 0.5 - 15W | Fixed Voltage 5V | Current Range 0.1 - 3.0A | Example devices Headphones, small USB accessories |\n| USB PD Power Range 15 - 27W | Fixed Voltage 9V | Current Range 1.67 - 3.0A | Example devices Smartphones, cameras, drones |\n| USB PD Power Range 27 - 45W | Fixed Voltage 15V | Current Range 1.8 - 3.0A | Example devices Tablets, small laptops |\n| USB PD Power Range 45 - 100W | Fixed Voltage 20V | Current Range 2.25 - 3.0A 3.0 - 5.0A only with rated cable | Example devices Large laptops, displays |\nThe majority of modern smartphones make use of the USB Power Delivery 2.0 and 3.0 specification. 25 to 45W of power is quite typical for smartphones, while today\u2019s laptops pull around as much as 100W and beyond. The latest 3.1 revision will eventually bring about devices with 140W, 180W, and 240W charging, although we haven\u2019t seen widespread adoption just yet.\nUSB PD Programmable Power Supply (PPS) explained\nDespite improvements with USB Power Delivery 2.0 and 3.0, they\u2019re still not entirely suited to the flexible requirements of very fast charging. Battery charging speed is sensitive to specific voltages and this changes depending on the battery\u2019s current charge. The 5V, 9V, 15V, and 20V set voltages in the standard specification aren\u2019t ideal for optimal fast charging.\nPPS is a more recent USB PD revision that allows for variable voltage levels.\nThe USB Power Delivery 3.0 revision released in 2018 also introduced the Programmable Power Supply protocol into the standard. USB PD PSS is much more flexible, allowing for configurable voltage levels at very small 20mV granular increments. Combined with device-to-charger communication and voltage-control charging algorithms, the ideal voltage can be negotiated and even changed during charging. This makes USB PD PPS far better suited to fast charging than the standard USB PD protocol.\nAs the newer part of the standard, support for USB PD PPS is limited to just a handful of gadgets and charging accessories in 2021. Support is starting to grow, particularly in the charger market, but the latest specification is leading to a few headaches for consumers. For example, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 series can only be fast-charged at their full 45W of power using USB PD PPS chargers. Otherwise, consumers are stuck with a slower 18W when using standard USB PD. The same applies to Google\u2019s Pixel series of smartphones, although the latest Pixel 9 Pro XL exposes the inconsistent state of USB PD charging. It requires 18V at 2A to charge, instead of the more widely accepted 9V.\nHow fast is USB PD charging?\nGiven the variable nature of USB PD charging and the wide range of battery capacities, it\u2019s impossible to give a precise speed for the standard. Very broadly speaking though, large battery capacity phones charge to full using 18W USB Power Delivery in a little over an hour. Large-capacity laptops using 65W charging can take an hour or two.\nUnlike laptops, smartphones generally don\u2019t like to use high voltages to charge their batteries. Typically, smartphone fast charging uses 5V or 9V and high currents to charge up the battery. For example, OnePlus\u2019 now-older 65W charging tech uses 10V and 6.5A charging and HUAWEI\u2019s 40W option uses a similar 10V and 4A. Keep in mind that both of these are proprietary technologies.\n9V is the closest USB PD voltage setting, which is capped at a much slower 27W of maximum power. Most USB Power Delivery smartphones we\u2019ve seen don\u2019t actually use the full 3A either, capping their power at 18-20W. That said, we\u2019ve seen manufacturers like Google, Motorola, and Samsung slowly go beyond that with USB PD PPS, achieving 25W to 45W fast charging.\nUSB PD can theoretically go as high as 240W, but most phones top out at 45W or 65W.\nProprietary technologies are pushing the boundaries even further, with OPPO teasing 240W and Xiaomi already offering 120W charging. That said, there are diminishing returns in terms of power consumption versus charge time anyway. Around 45W is plenty to charge a smartphone quickly enough.\nConsumer convenience and the ecological argument\nWhile charging speed is an important factor in the design of USB Power Delivery, and PPS in particular, it\u2019s not the primary design goal. USB PD was created as a single standard to power a wide range of USB gadgets. Thereby reducing the need for proprietary ports, connectors, and plugs.\nFirst and foremost, this should make it much easier for consumers to just plug and charge. E-waste from old chargers and cables is a growing problem, not just for landfills but as a drain on precious metals and other finite resources. There are strong environmental reasons for consumers and manufacturers to embrace a unified charging technology like USB Power Delivery.\nSmartphone brands removing charging bricks from the box may be a controversial decision today, particularly as consumers don\u2019t necessarily own a compatible USB PD PPS charger. But in the long term, we might not pay a second thought to the lack of bundled chargers as all our gadgets charge quickly from plugs we already own. And if you want to buy one charger for multiple devices, you can always get a multi-port USB wall adapter. It\u2019s an added expense, but one that undoubtedly adds a bit of convenience to your life if you carry around multiple devices with support for USB PD charging.\nThank you for being part of our community.

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nDon't wait for the Galaxy Z Flip 7, get the Motorola Razr Ultra (2025) now \u2014 here's why\nMay 28, 2025\nMotorola Razr Ultra\nMSRP: $1,299.99\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nMotorola Razr Ultra\nEvery year, Motorola gets my hopes up with an exciting new Razr. It rolls out colorful new finishes, slightly revamped cameras, and the most straightforward cover screen experience one could ask for, only to be surpassed by the reliability and polish of Samsung\u2019s latest Galaxy Z Flip. Each time I finish the year, I know that the top-tier Razr has earned a place in my heart, but the Galaxy Z Flip makes more sense. Until now.\nThis year, with the Razr Ultra (a.k.a. the Razr 60 Ultra in some regions), Motorola has its winner. It\u2019s a flip phone that\u2019s decided more is more, and it delivers an experience I\u2019ve waited for ever since the Razr series came back to the US in 2023. I finally think it does enough to stay ahead of whatever changes Samsung makes to the Galaxy Z Flip 7 this year, and here\u2019s why.\nThis review will mainly focus on the Razr Ultra, but I\u2019ll also be critiquing the Razr (2025) and Razr Plus (2025) throughout so you know which one best suits your usage and budget!\nThe Razr Ultra\u2019s design is as polished as they come\nI\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll probably say it again, but Motorola makes some of the best-looking phones in the game. It combines materials and colors in such a way that it makes you want to leave your phone case behind so that you can look at the latest Pantone shades. I thought that was evident enough on the 2024 Razr Plus with its rainbow of vegan leather hues, but I didn\u2019t know anything yet.\nJump to this year, and the newly introduced Razr Ultra \u2014 launched alongside 2025 refreshes of the vanilla Razr and Razr Plus \u2014 has added a few new Pantone colors to the series to pick from, but it\u2019s also added new materials like wood (on the Mountain Trail version) and Alcantara (on the Scarab version) to the mix. Yes, there are still a few vegan leather options, but how could you not be more intrigued by an ultra-premium foldable phone made of wood? That\u2019s exactly what I thought, and that\u2019s why I picked the Razr Ultra in Mountain Trail when given my choice.\nMotorola's colors have long beaten Samsung's, but a phone made of wood? I'll take two.\nAnd, after just about two weeks with my wood-paneled, bronze-finished Razr Ultra, I\u2019m as firmly in the no-case camp as I\u2019ve ever been. I\u2019m not worried about the panel splitting or splintering, and the best part about wood is that it doesn\u2019t pick up any fingerprints. So far, neither does the brushed metal frame, outside of the two flat edges around the hinge that meet when you open the Razr Ultra. Is the FSC-certified wood a little bit slippery in the hand? Yes, it has a bit less texture than Motorola\u2019s usual vegan leather, but it\u2019s not nearly as bad as some of the glossy panels I\u2019ve used in the past.\nAs much as I love the Mountain Trail version of the Razr Ultra, I have a few concerns about how a material like Alcantara might hold up on the Scarab finish. During our initial hands-on period with the 2025 Razr series, the demo units were already picking up fuzzies and dust, and I could only see that getting worse as you pull the phone out and put it away more over time. I\u2019d love to be proven wrong, but maybe there\u2019s a reason that fabric-covered phones aren\u2019t all the rage.\nOf course, what brings this year\u2019s Razr lineup closer than ever to Samsung\u2019s refined Galaxy Z Flip series isn\u2019t just that it looks good. It\u2019s that Motorola has finally improved the durability of its hinge across the board. The new hinge on all three 2025 Razrs is now titanium-reinforced to be four times stronger than stainless steel. In practice, that mostly means it feels tighter and more positionable than before, which is essential for some of the Moto AI features I\u2019ll get to in a few minutes.\nAlso vital to that Moto AI experience is the Razr Ultra\u2019s cover screen, which I think remains miles ahead of the one on Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Z Flip series. Not only is the panel still larger at an even 4 inches, but it\u2019s brighter at 3,000 nits of peak brightness, smoother with a 165Hz refresh rate, and tougher thanks to Corning\u2019s Gorilla Glass Ceramic. Do you need any of this on a display meant to be used quickly and put back in your pocket? Probably not, but it\u2019s nice to have. The Razr Plus\u2019 external display mirrors the same base specs (but a lower peak brightness), while the base Razr drops the size to 3.6-inches and the refresh rate to 90Hz.\nThe wide-open cover screen experience is better than Samsung\u2019s, too, if only because it makes the Razr easier to pick up and go about your day without a second thought. I\u2019ve written several times about how badly I want Samsung to ditch the reliance on Good Lock for its Flex Window experience, and every time I pick up a Razr, I\u2019m reminded just how right I am. I love that I can open any app right from the Razr Ultra\u2019s default app drawer, whether it\u2019s something productive like Slack or fun like YouTube to watch every Premier League goal from match week 37 while I sweat over Chelsea\u2019s chances of Champions League football next season.\nI watched PetaPixel review a half-frame camera on what feels like a half-frame display, and I loved it.\nThis year, Motorola has also revamped its approach to widgets on the cover screen, adding two extra customizable panels so you can fit even more information at a glance. I still prefer the well-optimized weather and Spotify panels as part of my default carousel, but I\u2019ve also set up a well-being widget with my Fitbit step count and a record of my daily screen time.\nHidden by this external excellence is another top-notch display \u2014 the largest one I\u2019ve used on a flip phone. In the name of going Ultra, Motorola bumped its main AMOLED display from 6.9 inches to an even 7 inches for the Ultra, making it larger than the iPhone 16 Pro Max, Galaxy S25 Ultra, and Pixel 9 Pro XL. Then, it brought over the same sky-high 165Hz refresh rate from the external display and paired it with an even brighter 4,500 nits of peak brightness and a crisp Super HD resolution. The Razr Plus and Razr keep things to 6.9-inches, and make some reasonable adjustments for the price differences: the Razr Plus has a peak brightness of 3,000 nits and a lower PPI overall, while the Razr drops to a 120Hz refresh rate. Thankfully, all three are gorgeous AMOLEDs.\nThe reworked hinge also means that the trio\u2019s display crease is shallower than ever, making it almost unnoticeable unless viewed at a sharp angle against the sunlight. I hardly notice the dent in the panel while gaming, either, easily dragging and dropping pieces of track across the center line as I work my way through Railbound just about three years late.\nAnd now, we have to talk about one more Razr Ultra-exclusive feature that I\u2019m not quite sold on: The AI Key. Brand-new to Motorola\u2019s top-tier flip phone this year is a dedicated button with no purpose but launching the Moto AI menu. Yes, you can remap its two gestures, choosing between Catch Me Up, Pay Attention, and opening the menu itself, but that\u2019s kind of it. Your other option is to turn the button off entirely, but then it feels like wasted space on a $1,300 flip phone. At the very least, Motorola was smart enough to put its AI Key opposite the power button, which means I haven\u2019t accidentally pressed it like I have Nothing\u2019s similarly-styled Essential Key \u2014 another fairly superfluous button, but one attached to a far more useful interpretation of this kind of feature.\nDespite my general heaping of praise on the 2025 Razr lineup, it\u2019s not without its quirks. The IP48 ratings across the board mean you\u2019ll have to be careful when taking your expensive flip phone anywhere near the beach, though it should be fine with an accidental dip into a pool. I\u2019ve also been less than impressed by the Razr Ultra\u2019s speakers at higher volumes. The stereo setup gets loud, but it\u2019s not very crisp when it gets there, losing some finer instruments from Hozier\u2019s re-release of Like Real People Do when I try to blare it over Spotify.\nThere\u2019s enough power here to make most flagships blush\nIf the only feather in Motorola\u2019s cap were that I think its Razrs look better than the Galaxy Z Flip, there wouldn\u2019t be much to write home about. That\u2019s been the case for the last few years, and if not for some key internal upgrades, I probably would have steered you toward the older models to help you save a few bucks. But, in keeping with its new Ultra branding, Motorola saw fit to pack its top-tier flagship with some of the best specs we\u2019ve ever seen on a foldable.\nThat means more \u2014 more of everything. Where the previous Razr Plus packed a Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 chipset (and the 2025 iteration still does), the Razr Ultra now carries Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Elite. Where that same Razr Plus offered 12GB of RAM and 256GB of fixed storage, this version jumps to 16GB and 512GB at the base level, leaving the Galaxy Z Flip 6\u2019s 128GB tier even further in the dust. The Razr Ultra even comes in an optional 1TB configuration, ensuring you\u2019ll have years to make Amazon Music playlists in the Playlist Studio before you run out of space.\nAs always, though, a packed spec sheet only means so much. While I could comfortably say that the Razr Ultra felt powerful in the palm of my hand, I wanted some data to back it up. So, I set up our usual gauntlet of tests and lined up what I felt were logical competitors. This time, the Razr Ultra\u2019s alternatives included the previous Razr Plus (2024), this year\u2019s base Razr (2025), the Galaxy Z Flip 6, and, for good measure, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Ultra. Why a candy bar-style phone known for its stylus? Well, it\u2019s the only other phone I could think of that costs $1,300, and it packs some very similar specs to the Razr Ultra.\nAnd honestly, I thought that when I added Samsung\u2019s top-end flagship to the mix, it would simply run away with the competition. After all, it doesn\u2019t have to worry about a split battery, split cooling setup, or any other typical foldable hiccups. Instead, the Razr Ultra showed me just how far Motorola has come in just a few years of revamping its flip phones. Yes, the Razr Ultra fell behind its fellow Ultra in CPU-intensive Geekbench 6 performance, but it stayed pretty much neck and neck on the more comprehensive PCMark Work test and finished above the Galaxy S25 Ultra by the end of 20 runs of our GPU-heavy Wild Life Extreme stress test. The level of stability it shows after five runs is incredibly impressive here.\nThe performance gap gets even bigger when you turn your eye from the Razr Ultra to its other hinged competitors, both in-house and from Samsung. Its Snapdragon 8 Elite chip and ample RAM run circles around the Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 of the previous Razr Plus and the Dimensity 7400X that holds down Motorola\u2019s most affordable \u2014 but still very, very good for the price and form factor \u2014 Razr (2025). The jump in performance also looks like it should be large enough to hold the eventual Galaxy Z Flip 7 at bay, especially if that phone sticks with its same base RAM and tries to count on the overclocked chipset for all of its performance gains.\nAlthough I expected the Galaxy S25 Ultra to outperform even the best flip phones, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m as surprised by the rest of the Razr Ultra\u2019s performance. I use review devices for a few days before putting them through our testing wringer, just to ensure it\u2019s worked through any residual setup kinks, and the Razr Ultra was no different. I took it for a fairly busy weekend around Baltimore right out of the box, heading to a street fair that required some careful Google Maps navigation up in Remington, before biking my way back across town for a friend\u2019s birthday party in the afternoon. Despite only having a few hours under its belt, the Razr Ultra felt comfortable almost immediately, jumping from one task to the next and prompting me to set up the few Moto AI features it thought might be necessary.\nThe Razr Ultra beats every other flip phone in its path and even keeps pace with traditional ultra-flagships.\nSince that hectic first day, the weather has been a bit of a mixed bag here in Baltimore, prompting me to use the Razr Ultra a little bit differently. Although it means a bit less time outdoors with the cameras, I\u2019ve balanced it out with an increase in Gamesnacks on the cover screen and a lot more reliance on the Razr Ultra as an around-the-house companion. It\u2019s come in clutch as a faster way to set a kitchen timer without opening the cover screen, a quick way to glance at the weather before heading out for a run to test my new Garmin Forerunner 970, and I\u2019ve taken to the twist-to-launch gesture as a way to check myself in the camera rather than looking for a mirror. Is any of this life-or-death? No, but everything reminds me how much I love Motorola\u2019s straightforward cover screen experience.\nUnsurprisingly, there are still a few things on my Razr Ultra to-do list, like bringing it to an Orioles game to test everything from the camera to pulling up MLB Ballpark tickets on the cover screen, but the O\u2019s have simply been too bad for me to sit through the spring weather conditions. I\u2019ve also meant to rely on the Razr Ultra as a navigation companion and DJ for a long drive, to really test how it handles thermals when I\u2019m using it for more than an hour at a time, but seemingly endless roadwork has me too nervous to move my car and then spend an hour hunting for parking. In the meantime, I\u2019ll just be living out my civil engineering dreams while I play Railbound and wait for sunnier days.\nAs if more RAM, power, and storage weren\u2019t enough, the Razr Ultra also packs more into its battery capacity \u2014 a lot more. Where the Galaxy Z Flip 6 offers just a 4,000mAh cell, the Razr Ultra delivers 4,700mAh in a not-much-larger package. Sure, it\u2019s a few millimeters wider and taller, but it\u2019s hardly an increase that\u2019s uncomfortable in your pocket. And, when it comes to flip phones, a few extra milliamp hours never hurt anyone, so it was time to see how much that extra size really matters. I ran it through our standardized battery drain test and, once again, the Razr Ultra put its money where its mouthpiece is.\nIt set the tone across almost all of our testing categories, spending the longest time on a simulated Zoom call, recording the longest 4K video, and then spending hours looping through our video playback test. The Razr Ultra even beat the Galaxy S25 Ultra in a few sections, though nothing could match the slab phone\u2019s longevity while browsing the web. There\u2019s not much this well-built flip phone with a big old battery can\u2019t do \u2014 except for maybe last forever. The regular Razr also delivers some impressive endurance numbers, which isn\u2019t that surprising as it adds 300mAh of capacity over last year\u2019s model to hit 4,500mAh. The Razr Plus (2025), meanwhile, sticks with the same 4,000mAh cell as the 2024 version \u2014 a puzzling choice, but a solid performer nonetheless.\nOf course, the Razr Ultra\u2019s superb battery won\u2019t, in fact, last forever, but Motorola\u2019s charging setup is good enough that you won\u2019t mind. The Razr Ultra is set up with both 68W wired TurboPower charging and 30W wireless charging, both of which are class leaders in the US in the foldable space. You will need a powerful enough charger \u2014 your standard Google Pixel charger and Samsung Galaxy charger probably won\u2019t be quick enough \u2014 but it\u2019s tough to argue with raw speed. In my testing, I found that the Razr Ultra doesn\u2019t hit its peak speed for very long, likely due to the heat associated with pushing that much power, but it still filled the 4,700mAh cell almost as quickly as the Galaxy S25 Ultra filled its larger battery. The 2025 Razr Plus and Razr stick to the same charging power as their 2024 counterparts \u2014 45W wired/15W wireless and 30W wired/15W wireless, respectively \u2014 but both still run rings around the Galaxy Z Flip 6\u2019s 25W peak.\nThe Razr Ultra rights one of the Razr Plus\u2019s camera wrongs\nBy now, you\u2019ve probably picked up on the fact that the Razr Ultra is a success story of Motorola fitting more than ever into a flip phone. For the most part, that\u2019s meant taking everything good about the previous Razr Plus and kicking it up a notch. However, when it comes to the rear cameras, it seems like Motorola has realized that its old ways were probably better. This is also where I have to admit that I\u2019m not always full of the best and brightest ideas.\nWhen Motorola launched the Razr Plus in 2023, I started begging for a flip phone with a telephoto camera. I figured there was almost no chance of me using an ultrawide sensor nearly as much as Motorola expected, so it should just get rid of it. Then, for the next generation, it did. It swapped the ultrawide sensor for a 50MP telephoto with 2x optical zoom. For a second, I thought it was a brilliant decision. Then, I realized it wouldn\u2019t zoom in past 2x when you tried to use the phone closed, making it no more flexible than its predecessor, while not boosting the zoom capabilities that much.\nSo now, I\u2019m glad that Motorola has reversed course, proving that it knows just a little better about what makes the best camera phones than I do. It\u2019s brought the Razr Ultra back to a wide and ultrawide pairing, trimming both sensors with 50MP resolutions while increasing the size of its primary sensor from 1/1.95 inches to 1/1.56 inches with larger individual megapixels to boot. The new ultrawide sensor is roughly the size of last year\u2019s telephoto selection, but it\u2019s proven much more helpful with the Razr Ultra closed.\nSo, with that bit of hardware reshuffling out of the way, let\u2019s get to some camera samples. I\u2019m only sharing Ultra shots here because the 2025 Razr Plus and Razr have identical hardware and camera performance to the 2024 editions \u2014 check out my review of the previous generation for an idea of what you\u2019ll get.\nThis first row is an interesting mixed bag for me. The shot of the street fair to the left is the very first photo I captured with the Razr Ultra, and also one of my least favorites. Although the details are pretty good, the color treatment gets wonky towards the horizon, where the sky abruptly turns white. It also shows far too much saturation in the leaves of the trees and the purple of the person\u2019s shirt in the foreground.\nBoth 2x zoom samples more than make up for it, though, with the image of the boat holding great detail and some very moody contrast in the rainy Baltimore spring. I also quite like the warmer, softer tones in the image of my friend overlooking the Domino Sugar factory, as it naturally softens past the railing in front of him without feeling too artificial. The low-light sample in the middle is also fairly true to life, putting just enough glow on the brick facade without blowing out the yellowness.\nIn this row, the Razr Ultra jumps from one strength \u2014 human portraits \u2014 to another, with seemingly no complaints about the different lighting conditions. It easily picked out the edges of my friend at the same street fair pictured above, even tracing the dark shape of his watch before applying the bokeh effect. The shot of the submarine is also one of my favorites, combining just enough sharpness with carefully placed shadows under the anchor point in the foreground and the area where the hull meets the waterline. We\u2019ve seen enough smartphone cameras soften or overdo shadows, so it\u2019s nice to see the Razr Ultra treat them naturally.\nSwitching sensors to the ultrawide camera, I once again think that the Razr Ultra\u2019s performance improved over time. Although I love the memory of the beer mile on the right side, the sharpness of the new T Rowe Price headquarters (and surrounding park) and pagoda are much more impressive, as are their respective color palettes. I particularly like that the Razr Ultra is willing to let the light sources around the pagoda do their job without trying to brighten the trees or bushes in the foreground. Also, both the primary and ultrawide cameras bin to 12.5MP images by default, but you can switch to Ultra-Res for the full 50MP effect, as long as you have enough storage space.\nWith just two rear cameras, it\u2019s fair to wonder how capable the Razr Ultra\u2019s zoom setup might be. After all, Motorola boasts that its premium flip phone comes with 30x magnification, but you have to trust the mix of digital zoom and post-processing to get there. I think the proper limit is closer to the 10x zoom length if you want to maintain decent sharpness. Yes, I pushed the Razr Ultra to its 30x maximum, but both the 20x and 30x results are, shall we say, light on detail. You can still tell you\u2019re looking at the top of a tower, but you\u2019re probably not going to share either image on social media. From ultrawide to 4x zoom, I think the Razr Ultra does its job brilliantly.\nOne of the other benefits of a flip phone is that it\u2019s so easy to use the primary cameras as selfie cameras. As such, I never even touched the 50MP punch hole camera that lives on the internal 7-inch display. With much larger sensors at your disposal, why would you? I\u2019m pleased with the detail across all four images above, though I have to point out the shift in color profiles. The blue of my jacket without portrait mode is different from the color with portrait mode applied, and the red tint in my face and on the bricks is completely different between the primary camera and the ultrawide. That said, I\u2019d still rather have the bigger sensors to work with.\nThe Razr Ultra takes everything good about the Razr Plus cameras and kicks it up a notch.\nThe Razr Ultra exclusively gains Group Shot \u2014 essentially Motorola\u2019s version of the Pixel\u2019s Best Take, and an Action Shot mode that mimics what OnePlus introduced on the OnePlus 13. You can also train an AI-powered Signature Style mode on all three of the new Razrs, which automatically applies customized edits to your shots right after you press the shutter button. I expected this mode to kick in without telling it to, but it doesn\u2019t, so I\u2019m still teaching the Razr Ultra to edit to my liking. Motorola\u2019s close relationship with Google means that the Razr Ultra supports plenty of other editing features, like Magic Editor and Photo Unblur, and I\u2019m kind of glad Motorola didn\u2019t try to reinvent the wheel here.\nOn the video side, the Razr Ultra tops out with 8K resolution at 30fps or 4K at either 30 or 60fps, both of which look excellent and are well-stabilized. However, the more fun feature to write home about is camcorder mode. It now kicks in automatically if you half-close your Razr Ultra with the camera set to video mode, and the standard controls flip to a one-press touchpad when you\u2019re ready to start or stop your clip. You can then swipe up or down on the sideways trackpad to zoom in or out, and another press stops and saves your clip. It feels a little backwards to hold your phone sideways and record in a vertical 9:16 aspect ratio for social media, though, so you might have to retrain your brain a bit.\nAlso, if you want to check out full-resolution versions of the camera samples above, you can do so at this Google Drive link.\nMotorola is in AI mode, and I\u2019m okay with that\nI\u2019ve avoided (or only hinted at) it so far, but we have to talk about one more piece of Motorola\u2019s new Razr lineup: The long-awaited (or maybe dreaded) entry into the AI race. Yes, it\u2019s happened \u2014 after several months of limiting its Moto AI features to a carefully chosen beta group, wrinkles like Catch Me Up and Remember This have been unleashed upon the masses. Well, they\u2019ve been made available to anyone who buys a new Razr, at least.\nSo far, I don\u2019t hate Moto AI, which is as close to a ringing endorsement as I\u2019ll get. I\u2019m not sure that any of its elements feel necessary just yet, as I\u2019m still pretty well trained to make notes when I need to remember something, tap the Gemini app when I need to ask questions, and make my Spotify playlists by hand, but I appreciate that Motorola is trying something different. Rather than simply pushing out clones of everyone else\u2019s writing tools and image generators, Moto AI took its time to figure out how to make smaller features more helpful.\nMotorola's AI features feel more intentional than its rivals, but I haven't fallen in love yet.\nSometimes, that means bringing a sensible feature to the entire Razr lineup, like Next Move, which helps to point you towards whatever AI-powered feature might be most useful. For me, that\u2019s primarily included reminding me to use Perplexity (which comes optimized for all three Razr models) for deep research, the Playlist Studio (which only works in Amazon Music) to set the mood, and Remember This to save notes from recipes or time-sensitive emails that have come in over the last few hours. Did I have trouble finding and recognizing Next Move at first? Yes, I had to reach out and ask what the interface looked like. Has it since grown on me as a hesitant-at-best user of AI? Yes, it has.\nThe Razr Ultra-exclusive Look and Talk is the other Moto AI feature that\u2019s worked its way into my daily life. It\u2019s kind of like having an AI assistant who\u2019s always watching, ready to answer questions when you look its way. Of course, if it were always watching, that would be creepy. So instead, Look and Talk only kicks in when your Razr Ultra is in tent or stand mode, and only when you\u2019re within about an arm\u2019s reach. You\u2019ll also know that it\u2019s active, as it opens up a Gemini Live-like interface that plays back both sides of your conversation.\nUnfortunately, I\u2019ve been less convinced by a few of the Razr Ultra\u2019s other Moto AI wrinkles, like Catch Me Up and the Playlist Studio, mostly because they\u2019re too specific to stand out. The former is a great idea, letting your phone give you a quick summary of recent notifications, but it\u2019s limited by the fact that it only works for personal communications, so things like Gmail, CBS Sports updates, and Instagram likes are exempt. Motorola\u2019s Playlist Studio is similarly interesting, using AI to generate a playlist based on whatever mood you describe, but then you can only export it to Amazon Music \u2014 and I\u2019m not about to ditch Spotify and my well-trained algorithm.\nIt also seems like Motorola isn\u2019t entirely sure how it would like you to activate Moto AI. Yes, the Razr Ultra has its dedicated AI key, but you can also access Gemini via the power button, open the Moto AI menu via an on-screen button, or launch it from the standard Moto AI app. It\u2019s like Motorola wants you to try Moto AI one way or another, and it\u2019s hoping that more access points and more features are the solution.\nMotorola Razr Ultra review: Finally, a flip phone without training wheels\nAt the end of the day, all I think Motorola had to do to make me happy was make a flip phone without compromise. The Razr Ultra is that flip phone. Yes, it\u2019s extremely expensive \u2014 matching the price of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Ultra \u2014 and yes, I still feel like many of its Moto AI features feel unnecessary and unfinished, but it\u2019s hard to find a single part of the spec sheet where Motorola shied away from giving its new foldable flagship just a little bit more. The only real complaint I have centers on the update guarantee, which sits at a measly three years of major Android updates and four years of security patches. Come on, Motorola, you have to do better in 2025.\nOutside of that, though, the Razr Ultra checks every box and then some. It\u2019s the best-looking flip phone to date, offers the fastest charging in the US, the most durable glass for its cover screen, and has an updated hinge that makes Motorola\u2019s already-shallow crease even better. Pack the biggest battery into its slim leather, wood, or Alcantara-backed body and add a Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset with 16GB of RAM, and this is one of the better examples of a smartphone living up to its Ultra moniker. I love that Hello UX remains light and smooth, and I\u2019ll keep recommending Motorola\u2019s cover screen interface over Samsung\u2019s until the Galaxy Z Flip unites its app drawer and dumps the odd folder-shaped design.\nMotorola's Razr Ultra has almost no compromises, making it the flip phone I've always wanted.\nYet this is a flip phone with a base configuration that costs $1,300. That\u2019s a lot of money \u2014 like, a lot. You can get Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S25 Ultra for that price, along with its more powerful cameras, S Pen, and equally durable design. However, the more important rival to consider once you\u2019ve balked at the Razr Ultra\u2019s sky-high price is Motorola\u2019s own Razr (2025) ($599.99 at Amazon). It costs only about half as much as the Razr Ultra, yet delivers a solid pair of cameras, many of the same Moto AI features, and a matching update commitment. Again, it\u2019s still not a great commitment, but you\u2019re saving a lot of money.\nI went so far as to say that Razr (2025) should be your pick if you\u2019re in the market for your first foldable phone, and I stand by that statement. It charges faster than the Galaxy Z Flip 6, picks better color options and finishes, and has the same cover screen experience that I loved on the Razr Ultra \u2014 even if it\u2019s on a 3.6-inch display instead of a 4-inch one. The base Razr also picked up a chipset upgrade, going from the Dimensity 7300X to 7400X, while its middle sibling, the Razr Plus, stayed the same as its 2024 predecessor.\n- Solid performance\n- Improved hinge\n- New Pantone color options\n- Flexible cameras\n- Excellent price\n- Slower charging than other Razrs\n- Limited software update commitment\nIn fact, the Razr Plus (2025) ($999.99 at Amazon) is essentially the same phone as the 2024 version, just with an improved hinge, new colors, and AI features. It\u2019s still a great phone, but with the regular Razr enjoying similar upgrades and some extra buffs, plus the introduction of the Ultra, the Plus feels a little less inspiring this time around.\n- Improved hinge\n- Charges faster than Galaxy Z Flip\n- Solid primary camera\n- Extremely limited upgrades over 2024 model\n- Mediocre software commitment\n- Less interesting colors than base Razr and Razr Ultra\nIf you\u2019ve spent much of your Android career with a Samsung Galaxy phone in your pocket, you might feel more at home switching to the Galaxy Z Flip 6 ($1099.99 at Samsung). Although I didn\u2019t love that it stayed so similar to the previous Galaxy Z Flip 5, I\u2019m willing to admit that Samsung knows a thing or two about build quality. The Galaxy Z Flip feels tight and sturdy, and it\u2019s easy to position at almost any angle when you need it in tent or stand mode. It will get a few more software updates than the latest crop of Razrs, it\u2019s true, but you\u2019ll have to live with slower charging, a slightly stunted Flex Window experience (though Samsung\u2019s widgets are excellent), and somewhat less impressive internal and external displays.\nOf course, the Galaxy Z Flip 7 could pull it out of the bag and really deliver a true ultra-tier flip foldable this year (even if the rumors aren\u2019t all that promising), breaking the cycle of Samsung\u2019s diminishing returns. If it were me, though, I\u2019d buy the Razr Ultra right now, and I wouldn\u2019t look back.\n- Blisteringly fast charging and excellent battery life\n- Ultra-flagship-tier performance\n- Solid dual camera setup\n- Top-notch materials and eye-catching Pantone colors\n- Two very vibrant displays\n- Clean, simple software\n- Moto AI feels half baked\n- Limited software commitment\n- Long-range zoom kinda stinks\n- Expensive\nThank you for being part of our community.

Learn more.\nAfter using the vivo X200 Ultra for several weeks, I wish Samsung would copy its amazing cameras\nJune 6, 2025\nvivo X200 Ultra\nMSRP: $1,099.99\nWhat we like\nWhat we don't like\nvivo X200 Ultra\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra is among the most popular camera phones around. But there\u2019s a strong argument to be made that Samsung\u2019s flagships (and to a lesser extent even Google\u2019s top Pixels) have stagnated as far as hardware is concerned.\nSamsung\u2019s base and Plus phones have effectively used the same camera hardware since 2022, while its most recent Ultra phones have offered upgraded ultrawide cameras and a switch to a more modern 5x 50MP camera. Nevertheless, the company is still sticking with a measly 10MP 3x camera on its $1,200 Ultra devices.\nHowever, the newly launched vivo X200 Ultra has shaken things up in a big way, and after using it extensively for several weeks, I really hope the likes of Apple, Google, and Samsung are taking notes for 2026 and beyond.\nvivo X200 Ultra 35mm main camera test and samples\nOne of vivo\u2019s most notable camera-related moves is offering a 35mm main camera (50MP LYT-818, 1/1.28-inch). By contrast, 99% of smartphones on the market use a 24mm main camera, offering a wider field of view. The 35mm camera is equivalent to a 1.4x or 1.5x camera. vivo isn\u2019t the first manufacturer to do this, owing to ZTE\u2019s previous forays, but it still marks a major expansion for this tech.\nAs colleague Rob Triggs observed, having a native 35mm focal length should reduce facial distortion compared to a standard 24mm lens. But more importantly, in my own experience, it allows for better framing. Check out this comparison between an older Pixel 7 Pro and the X200 Ultra to see the difference between a conventional 24mm smartphone shot and a 35mm snap. I didn\u2019t have to worry about the sheets above or people sitting too close to my friend.\nFurthermore, a native 35mm camera should theoretically deliver better image quality than a crop from a similar 24mm camera. However, I had to pixel-peep to spot any significant quality differences versus a 35mm crop. So it\u2019s not a night-and-day quality difference if you stick with a software-based 35mm mode, especially when some phones let you set the 35mm crop as the default.\nThis main camera still holds up in a variety of lighting conditions, offering plenty of detail, wide dynamic range (see the fourth and sixth image in the gallery), and little noise. I do occasionally see some over-processing, particularly at night when vivo sometimes manages the feat of using too much noise reduction and too much sharpening in the same scene. I\u2019m also glad to report that this camera doesn\u2019t suffer from glare like the X200 Pro\u2018s primary shooter.\nUltrawide camera hardware that\u2019s closer to the main camera\nWe\u2019ve also seen the Pixel 9 series and Galaxy S25 Ultra embrace higher-resolution ultrawide cameras. These sensors are much smaller than the primary cameras, though. However, vivo has decided to use the same 1/1.28-inch camera sensor for both the main and ultrawide cameras. This also seems like the next logical step for more mainstream brands.\nPerhaps the biggest benefit I noticed with the X200 Ultra\u2019s ultrawide camera was the much-improved brightness. There isn\u2019t a big disparity between the ultrawide and main cameras.\nThe improved light capture also means I was able to capture handheld astrophotography shots using the wider camera. That\u2019s particularly important as it means you can get more of the expansive night sky in your snaps.\nI thought the X200 Ultra\u2019s ultrawide camera was far from perfect, though. There\u2019s still a lot of corner softness, in line with the X200 Pro\u2019s somewhat disappointing wide-angle shooter. I really feel like vivo could\u2019ve reduced the field-of-view from the current 14mm to something more restrained to combat this problem and distortion. I also thought ultrawide shots were quite blotchy and soft in general compared to the main camera, with this problem being extremely apparent at night. Check out the comparison below.\nIn any event, I think vivo definitely needs to improve the ultrawide image quality, but it\u2019s clear that the gap between it and the main camera has narrowed somewhat. It\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve seen smartphones use the same camera sensor for both main and ultrawide lenses (hello, OPPO Find X3 Pro), but I want to see Google and Samsung pull this off too.\nvivo has also taken the interesting step of defaulting to the ultrawide camera for video. It makes sense on paper as cameras with a narrower field of view, like the 35mm main sensor, tend to be less stable than wider cameras. You can still switch to the 35mm camera anyway, although it looks like vivo is shooting 8K/30fps videos exclusively via the ultrawide lens. In any event, I thought that video capture was at least on par with the already good X200 Pro, with smooth panning and good stabilization. But I did notice weird flickering on people\u2019s faces when filming portrait video in poor lighting.\nWhat about that 200MP zoom camera?\nvivo was the first smartphone brand to adopt a 200MP zoom camera on a smartphone, debuting the feature on the X100 Ultra in 2024. It has since become a fixture on high-end phones like the HONOR Magic 7 Pro and Xiaomi 15 Ultra, and the X200 Ultra returns with a 200MP 3.7x periscope camera (f/2.27).\nThis zoom camera delivers image quality that\u2019s close to the main camera, featuring a good level of detail, consistent colors, and dynamic range, and very little noise. Image quality does fall sharply from 10x to 15x, though, with 20x shots being a gamble. But more than anything else, I\u2019d like to see Google and Samsung take a similarly ambitious route with their zoom cameras. I\u2019d love to see a Pixel 11 Pro with a 200MP tele camera or a giant 50MP periscope lens.\nMuch like the X200 Pro and X100 Ultra, the X200 Ultra edges out Google when it comes to the number of ways you can use the periscope camera. There\u2019s the expected macro focus and 4K/120fps slow-motion options, as well as portrait video with automatic focus switching (like iPhones), a stage mode, and higher-resolution active stabilized video. There\u2019s also local support for 8K video and night video capture.\nI thought there was still room for improvement here, though. vivo does some sketchy processing at long focal lengths, as I noticed in my hands-on with the X200 Ultra\u2019s crazy external lens. During my time with the lens, I noticed that the phone actually seemed to airbrush balcony railings out of a very long-range zoom snap, while the picture taken with the lens kept it intact. There\u2019s also a very shallow depth of field when taking close-up images or full-blown macro shots (e.g. food or bugs). So you have to move back if you want everything in focus. Still, this depth of field comes in handy for portrait snaps.\nvivo X200 Ultra verdict: A great camera phone with one dealbreaker\nThankfully, the vivo X200 Ultra also ticks many boxes for a 2025 flagship device. There\u2019s the all-powerful Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, a 6,000mAh battery that usually delivers two days of regular usage, 90W wired and 40W wireless charging, and a bright, 6.82-inch QHD+ OLED screen. Other notable vivo X200 Ultra features include IP68/IP69 ratings, an Apple-style Camera Control button, an ultrasonic in-display fingerprint sensor, Bluetooth 6.0, and Wi-Fi 7.\nSo, the vivo X200 Ultra has a cutting-edge set of cameras that could be a sign of things to come, a ton of performance, a large battery, and plenty of premium extras. So far, so good, right?\nThe vivo X200 Ultra is another great camera phone from vivo that most people can't buy.\nThere is one major caveat, though. Unlike the excellent vivo X200 Pro ($749.99 at Giztop), the Ultra is limited to China only. This restricted availability severely reduces your purchase options if you\u2019re interested in the device. You\u2019ll just have to pay the ~$1,049 fee to import the phone from storefronts like Giztop. The China-only nature also means you miss out on Quick Share, although Google Wallet works fine, and it supports Android Auto. Another galling absence from China-only phones is eSIM support. There are eSIM adapters that bring this support to phones without the tech, but it\u2019s still a notable omission here.\nIn any event, I really hope Google and Samsung embrace technologies like a 35mm main camera, an ultrawide camera with a flagship sensor, and more ambitious zoom cameras. Because it certainly looks like the rest of the industry will adopt or has adopted this tech.\n- Smooth performance\n- Unique camera hardware\n- Great video capture\n- Fast wired/wireless charging\n- Long battery life\n- China-only release\n- No eSIM\n- Ultrawide images could be better\nThank you for being part of our community.
