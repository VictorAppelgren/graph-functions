      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits (compact paragraph)**  \nYour draft outlines a plausible 0–3‑week view but falls short on the rigor required for a world‑class equity outlook. First, the causal chain is too vague: you mention “war‑risk premium” and “political risk” without quantifying how each factor translates into sector‑specific price moves. Replace generic statements with concrete numbers—e.g., “a 10 % rise in Brent would lift U.S. defense indices by ~4 % (source: Bloomberg, 2025‑08‑23) and push energy shares up 5–7 % (source: EIA, 2025‑08‑21).” Second, the analysis conflates unrelated events (Secret Service bonus, Trump‑sanctuary injunction) without explaining their market relevance; either remove them or tie them explicitly to sentiment indices (e.g., VIX). Third, you cite “FCA warning” but never reference the specific FCA press release (ID: 6) or the FCA’s 2025 “problem‑behaviours” report; add a citation ID and a brief quote. Fourth, the “base case” lacks a clear risk‑premium framework—state the implied risk‑premium (e.g., 15 bp) and how it would shift under each scenario. Fifth, the “key signals” list is too generic; replace with concrete watch items: (1) daily Brent and WTI prices, (2) any new sanctions or cease‑fire announcements from the UN (source: 7YQN9WX3K), (3) SEC/FCA guidance on gamified apps (source: 6), (4) any new Trump‑era immigration policy filings (source: U1KRCQOYR). Finally, ensure every claim is backed by a source ID from the provided material; avoid unreferenced statements. Incorporate these edits to tighten the narrative, improve quantification, and enhance citation density.",
