  "content": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products .\n\nSamsung just launched the Galaxy S25 FE smartphone at IFA. It's available right now, starting at $650. The handset is available in four colorways.\n\nThis is a midrange member of the Galaxy S25 family, after the company released the S25, S25 Plus and S25 Ultra back in January and the ultra-thin . The base-level S25 , so this is a slightly cheaper way to get in on all of that Galaxy action.\n\nThis phone actually ships with the company's One UI 8 operating system. The other S25 models shipped with One UI 7, but have since begun receiving software updates to bring them up to speed. This introduces a refreshed user interface with new icons and better animations, more AI integration and improved split-screen performance.\n\nIt features an Exynos 2400 CPU, which should get the job done but won't be quite as snappy as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite that ships with the rest of the lineup. There's a 6.7-inch AMOLED screen with up to 1,900 nits of peak brightness. The camera system is decent, with a 50MP main camera, a 12MP ultra-wide lens and an 8MP telephoto lens. There's also a 12MP front-facing camera.\n\nDespite being a bit underpowered when compared to the rest of the lineup, the S25 FE still accommodates all of those fancy Galaxy AI bells and whistles. This includes the company's Generative Edit photo software, an on-device assistant and more. So this is a relatively affordable entryway into that world.",

      "text": "Engadget has been testing and reviewing consumer tech since 2004. Our stories may include affiliate links; if you buy something through a link, we may earn a commission. Read more about how we evaluate products.\nEverything Samsung announced at the Galaxy S25 Unpacked event\nBehold, the Galaxy S25 series and loads of AI.\nSamsung\u2019s first Unpacked event of 2025 delivered the Galaxy S25 series \u2014 as expected. Although the phones don\u2019t have dramatically upgraded specs, the company stuffed \u2014 you guessed it! \u2014 more AI into the devices. This latest batch is more context-sensitive and predictive, and some of it even squeezes more out of the phones\u2019 mildly upgraded hardware.\nGalaxy S25 Ultra\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra is still the biggest, best and most expensive of the bunch. It has a 6.9-inch display and a more rounded edge for a \u201ccomfortable grip.\u201d Samsung says it\u2019s the \u201cslimmest, lightest, and most durable Galaxy Ultra device ever,\u201d rocking a titanium body with Corning\u2019s Gorilla Armor 2 for \u201cadvanced drop protection\u201d and scratch resistance.\nUnlike the two smaller models, one of the Ultra\u2019s camera sensors got a spec upgrade: Its ultrawide lens is now 50MP, up from the mere 12MP one in last year\u2019s model.\nLike its siblings, the S25 Ultra is powered by a customized version of the Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, which lets the trio of phones process many of their AI experiences on-device. Of course, that\u2019s better for privacy.\nAlthough the phone continues the tradition of including an S Pen (it\u2019s now essentially the long-retired Galaxy Note), Air Commands \u2014 which bridged the gap between the two \u2014 have bit the dust. Samsung told Engadget in a briefing that fewer than one percent of S Pen-toting customers used the feature. And those who did mostly used it as a camera shutter, which is easily replicated in other ways. Samsung says the removal let it shed some weight and boost the S Pen\u2019s durability.\nEngadget\u2019s Sam Rutherford got an early hands-on with the Galaxy S25 Ultra and said it \u201clooks like a good phone\u201d and described Samsung\u2019s AI suite as \u201cmuch more cohesive and easier to get into,\" but also felt the company \"could be doing more for its most expensive non-folding phone.\u201d\nThe Galaxy S25 Ultra has 12GB of RAM, and it ships in 256GB, 512GB and 1TB storage tiers. It\u2019s still quite the investment, though \u2014 starting at $1,300.\nGalaxy S25 and S25+\nThe Galaxy S25 and S25+ saw their RAM upgraded to 12GB (same as the Ultra), up from 8GB in their 2024 predecessors. It combines with the Snapdragon 8 Elite to better handle the phones\u2019 many AI features. (More in a minute.)\nThe rest of their hardware is remarkably similar to the S24 and S24+. They still have 6.2-inch and 6.7-inch displays, respectively. But Samsung\u2019s new ProScaler AI tool can upscale images in real time to perhaps make up for the unchanged specs. Samsung says it can boost the quality of what you see by 40 percent.\nEngadget\u2019s Mat Smith tried the Galaxy S25 and S25+ and praised the phones\u2019 \u201cpremium and solidly built\u201d slim designs and \u201cvivid, bright and gorgeous\u201d displays. However, he was skeptical of the phones\u2019 AI-centric focus. \u201cIn just a few years, Samsung has built up a substantial collection of artificial intelligence tricks, features and apps,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile some of them have been impressive, like live translation and annotation, others (often involving generative AI) aren\u2019t actually helpful \u2014 or notable \u2014 enough to warrant regular use.\"\nStorage is also unchanged from the S24 series: 128GB or 256GB in the Galaxy S25 and 256GB or 512GB in the Galaxy S25+. Fortunately, pricing is also unchanged. You\u2019ll pay $800 or more for the S25 and $1,000 and up for the S25+.\nGalaxy AI\nWith most hardware upgrades (apart from the Snapdragon chip) coming in soft this generation, Samsung is leaning hard on AI features to make you want to throw down hard-earned cash on the new models. This year, Samsung\u2019s One UI 7 on top of Android 15 combines to create what Samsung calls \u201ca new AI-integrated OS.\u201d It aims for a more personalized and context-sensitive AI, rather than just a series of one-off tools.\nAI plays a central role in the phones\u2019 camera features, with the Qualcomm chip making the phones better at analyzing noise \u2014 leading to what Samsung says is better low-light performance. Audio Eraser is a tool that Samsung claims will use AI to remove unwanted noises from videos like wind or a random stranger talking.\nSamsung gathers its new collection of on-device AI tools into what it calls the Personal Data Engine. The series of multimodal (text, images, video, audio) machine learning agents leads to features like AI Select, which builds on Samsung\u2019s legacy Smart Select tool. The new AI-powered version can scan your screen and suggest context-aware tasks \u2014 like creating a GIF from a YouTube video you\u2019re watching.\nYou could say the AI-powered Now Bar is Samsung\u2019s answer to the iPhone\u2019s Dynamic Island. The pill-shaped bar sits at the bottom of the lock screen and below the digital clock when the phone is unlocked. It generates a series of reminders based on context. Within the Now Bar is another AI feature, the Now Brief, which generates morning, midday and evening summaries of info it thinks will be relevant to you.\nSamsung\u2019s Sketch to Image tool has been rebranded as Drawing Assist, and Samsung says the feature is more polished and accurate. It also adds an option to import existing images for your prompt. The S25 series also adds an upgraded version of Google\u2019s Circle to Search (activated by long-pressing the home button). It can now recognize phone numbers, emails and URLs, letting you trigger their corresponding actions with a single tap.\nGalaxy S25 Edge\nWell, I hope you like being teased because, well, there isn\u2019t much to go on here. Much like it did a year ago with its grand reveal of a... render of the Galaxy Ring, Samsung gave Unpacked viewers a teeny-weeny glimpse of its rumored \u201cGalaxy Slim\u201d phone, which will instead be called the Galaxy S25 Edge.\nThe teaser shows a quick glimpse of a phone that\u2019s indeed slimmer, but the company showcased its vapor chamber, cameras and metallic frame more than the full-on handset. (And the engineers go wild.) We also don\u2019t know its price or release date. However, Bloomberg reports that it will use many of the same components as the S25 Ultra but cost less.\nSamsung Wallet updates\nThe company added two new payment features: Instant Installment and Tap to Transfer.\nAs its name suggests, Instant Installment is a \u201cbuy now, pay later\u201d service that lets you turn purchases into an offline payment plan experience. It\u2019s managed entirely on-device and available for Visa and Mastercard purchases.\nEngadget\u2019s Cherlynn Low was briefed by Samsung on the service. \u201cIt\u2019s not that Samsung is pivoting to becoming a credit provider and taking on loans,\u201d she wrote. \u201cInstead, it facilitates your purchases and turns your payments into what the company\u2019s rep said is \u2018the first offline payment plan experience.\u2019\u2019\nMeanwhile, Tap to Transfer is a peer-to-peer payment service, rivaling the likes of Apple\u2019s Tap to Cash. Like the iPhone equivalent, you only need to bump phones with someone you want to pay (or be paid by). But it isn\u2019t limited to Samsung Pay; you can use it with third-party apps, too, since it\u2019s instead tied to the associated card or account. Like Instant Installment, it works with Visa and Mastercard.\nGalaxy Watch for Kids\nThe Galaxy Watch for Kids may sound like a new piece of gear, but it\u2019s instead a new setup option for the cellular Galaxy Watch 7 (and likely future wearables). You know, kinda like Apple Watch for Kids.\nSamsung, which partnered with Google on the experience, says parents can set up a child\u2019s watch from their phone and activate its eSim. From there, the kid can use the smartwatch without a paired phone. As you\u2019d expect, parents can set up guardrails \u2014 like which apps are installed or a do not disturb status during school hours. Location sharing is optional, and Samsung and Google are offering new kid-focused apps and watch faces to keep things fun."

Read more about how we evaluate products.\nSamsung Galaxy S25 review: More powerful, but more of the same\nGalaxy Same 25.\nOver a year since it dipped into generative artificial intelligence, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S-series phones are now the vanguard for its gen-AI features. This year, we\u2019re getting even deeper hooks into Google\u2019s Gemini AI assistant and more built-in software tricks than ever before. At the same time, however, the Galaxy S25 arrives with marginal hardware upgrades over last year\u2019s S24.\nWhile there\u2019s a case of \u201cif it ain\u2019t broke, don\u2019t fix it,\u201d you\u2019ll need to stare hard at the spec sheets to spot the differences between this year\u2019s phone and the 2024 model. With the Galaxy S25, there\u2019s a triple-camera system, a 6.2-inch Full HD+ screen and support for the ever-improving Galaxy AI, which the company seems to be prioritizing this year \u2014 even if it isn\u2019t quite enough to carry an entirely new device.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S25 has useful AI features and impressive battery life, but the familiar hardware and unchanged price tag make for an unconvincing upgrade.\n- Solid build quality\n- Incredible battery life\n- Smoother Gemini AI experience\n- Powerful new processor\n- Same display as the S24\n- Same camera sensors as the S24\n- Same price as the S24\nHardware and design\nBarring a powerful new chip, the S25 is a massive serving of deja vu from a hardware perspective. You could revisit last year\u2019s S24 review to get the gist.\nSamsung decided thinner is the new direction this time around. Galaxy S25 Edge aside, this year\u2019s range has been slimmed down. I think the S25 is tangibly thinner \u2013 but that\u2019s because I was able to compare it with a Galaxy S24 side-by-side. It\u2019s less of a selling point when measuring a change of 0.4 millimeters.\nAfter several years of carrying around and testing phones with screens over 6.5 inches, having the S25 with me is refreshing. Even if the 6.2-inch screen is a little small for extensive Netflix or YouTube watching, like the 6.3-inch Pixel 9 Pro, it remains plenty big for pretty much everything else. The 2X AMOLED screen tops out at 2,600 nits, which is plenty bright enough, with variable refresh rates that top out at 120Hz.\nI received the Silver Shadow S25 with a frosted sheen, which I love. It\u2019s not the most eye-catching option, however. I think the rich Navy blue is my pick. But who are we kidding? Most of us throw our phones into cases \u2013 and I\u2019ll do the same once my case gets here.\nOddly enough, one of the upgrades with the S25 involves adding a case: support for faster Qi2 charging (and magnetic latching) is only possible through compatible cases. Those cases, however, weren\u2019t available for this review. My colleague Sam Rutherford explains it all here; but at least there\u2019s some compatibility, which was lacking in last year\u2019s Galaxy phones.\nCameras\nSamsung makes some of the best smartphones for photography, which is lucky because the S25\u2019s camera sensors appear identical to last year's. Which themselves are the same as the year before. Hmm.\nAs a refresher, that includes a 50-megapixel primary sensor, a 12MP ultra-wide shooter and a 10MP 3x telephoto camera with a front-facing 12MP camera. if you\u2019re looking for 5x zoom and high-res sensors, you should check out the Galaxy S25 Ultra (or the Pixel 9 Pro) \u2014 but the setup on the base S25 still works well, despite the aging sensors.\nI was pleasantly surprised with the S25\u2019s sheer consistency. Most of my photos were crisp and objects were in focus, although I preferred the iPhone 16\u2019s results in darker conditions. I found that the Galaxy S25 tends to process images differently between the telephoto and primary sensor, with some night-time shots coming out a bit amber-hued.\nSamsung\u2019s claims that the new Snapdragon 8 Elite would help low-light performance are also accurate. The company says that with the chip's power, the S25 series can better analyze noise, even detecting moving and static objects and processing them differently. Samsung\u2019s computational photography has also improved when it comes to difficult shooting conditions. Digital zoom, at 10x, seems crisper and offers more usable photos than its predecessors.\nIf you\u2019re willing to dip into a separate camera app, Samsung\u2019s Expert RAW features another new option: virtual aperture. I\u2019ve struggled to discern a tangible difference while shooting with the S25. It appears to be a more advanced version of Portrait mode, without requiring the phone to identify a person or subject to apply a soft bokeh to the background. The effect is moderately successful, but demands a good level of light. I found it struggled to apply a virtual aperture effect in dark environments.\nUnfortunately, the feature is hidden away in the experimental section of Samsung\u2019s Expert RAW camera app, which needs to be downloaded separately. This camera app is for power users who demand manual controls, and it\u2019s great that it\u2019s available. However, lots of (maybe most) prospective S25 buyers won\u2019t need it, or even know it exists\nAnother under-the-hood improvement is within S25\u2019s gallery, where the search feature has improved categorization and makes it generally easier to find what you\u2019re looking for. As I typed, it\u2019d suggest WhatsApp images, locations and more. Samsung says it\u2019s added 2.7 times more keywords, which is delightfully specific.\nWhile photography is still similar, spec-wise, on the S25, Samsung has substantially improved video for more seasoned cinematographers. This year\u2019s phones will also capture video in HDR by default, while a new Galaxy Log mode means you can capture log video for improved dynamic range. It\u2019ll also mean you can apply more accurate color grading if you like to edit videos and get in deep. Video is also recorded in 10-bit color, offering more latitude for editors. Still, like I said, this is for folks already neck-deep in using LUTs, with a compatible editing app at the ready.\nWith Audio Eraser. Samsung has caught up with Apple and Google. This is its own post-processing feature for recording video in louder environments. It taps into AI to nix specific environmental noises, like wind, water and traffic. The effect isn\u2019t quite as impressive in real life as during Samsung\u2019s S25 launch keynote, however.\nWhen faced with the erratic street traffic noise, Audio Eraser\u2019s automatic setting compressed the audio pretty severely, leaving my voice sounding a little gurgly and crunchy. It\u2019s similar to audio with noise cancellation on Google Meet and WhatsApp voice notes. I was definitely more audible \u2013 but it wasn\u2019t easy listening.\nThe upgrades are welcome, but given the iPhone 16\u2019s Camera Control button and the Pixel 9\u2019s latest software tricks like Add Me, Samsung\u2019s cameras have had a weaker showing than the competition.\nSoftware\nSoftware additions don\u2019t stop at the camera app. There\u2019s a scattering of new features across the board with the S25. The most immediately noticeable update is more of a duo: Now Bar and Now Brief. The Now Bar is a new lockscreen tile \u2014 part contextual info panel and part notification banner. With rolling Google Maps navigation instructions and media playing functions, we\u2019ve seen many of these ideas on the iPhone\u2019s Dynamic Island. Samsung\u2019s version is more limited, at least for now.\nEmbarrassingly, only eight apps (or features) can appear on the Now Bar, including the clock, sports notifications from Google and a voice recorder. It\u2019s underwhelming. If third-party app makers (or more Google apps) can make their way into the Bar, it could be more helpful, but as it is, it\u2019s barely more than a lock-screen widget.\nThe Now Brief, similarly, could use a little more meat. I hate to make another Apple comparison, but it\u2019s a more accessible version of the iPhone\u2019s summaries generated in Notifications. The Now Brief populates with relevant notifications, weather summaries and even traffic guidance, all of which is possibly most valuable in the mornings. It will also generate daily summaries accessible from a widget on the S25\u2019s home screen. I\u2019ll be strapping on a Galaxy Watch to see how these interact with fitness goals and wellness, so stay tuned for more insight here.\n(Sidenote: Google Discover, a swipe-left-from-home screen also offers a similar stream of news, notifications and other smartphone info. It has been around for years.)\nChanges elsewhere seem more like rebranded features. AI Select (once called Smart Select) resides in the pull-out Edge Panel (and the screenshot toolbar) and will offer up suggested actions once you select or circle something onscreen. It can offer clever suggestions when it contextually detects an event to add to your calendar or something that needs translating. I\u2019m not sure AI Select is noticeably better than Smart Select, but it\u2019s at least on by default. You had to enable the former in Settings for it to appear in the Edge Panel. While it\u2019s not completely straightforward, AI Select does work well as a shortcut, suggesting translation with foreign languages or offering to pull dates into your calendar with a tap.\nThis ties into Gemini AI upgrades, which appear first on the S25 series but will be coming to other Android phones that can run Gemini AI. With a long press of a button, your voice commands to Gemini can pull in information and then apply them to make a reminder, plan a route or send details through text message to a friend, or even a WhatsApp message. I\u2019m looking forward to Android adding further third-party apps and services, but I've been waiting for more effortless uses for AI assistants. This is a step in that direction.\nI\u2019m also not entirely writing off the Now Brief. It could improve over time, especially with Samsung\u2019s Personal Data Engine, which will attempt to join the dots between your smartphone interactions. As I finished this review, the Now Brief began offering audio highlights from The Guardian, even though I hadn\u2019t yet installed the news organization\u2019s app. However, Galaxy AI figured it out, it was the right choice: I don\u2019t read the Daily Mail Online. I wish Google and Apple News would work that out without me having to actively block news sources.\nPerformance and battery life\nHas Samsung solved our smartphone battery life woes? The Galaxy S25 clocked in at over 28 hours of video playback. That\u2019s almost four hours more than last year\u2019s S24, and given the hardware parity with the S25, it\u2019s a testament to the processor efficiency upgrades this year. With more typical use, I was recharging the phone every two days. That\u2019s not how often I usually have to charge smartphones during reviews \u2014 I\u2019m very impressed.\nWith the 3nm Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy, those gains aren\u2019t just in efficiency. The CPU multi-core performance hit 8,950 (up from 7,049 on the S24), while GPU scored 19,158, up from 15,082 last year. Not that there was that much need for such a leap.\nOnce again, the Galaxy S25 is fast and handled everything I threw at it effortlessly. However, back-to-back generative AI requests and shooting and uploading 4K video made the S25 heat up \u2013 it lacks the expanded vapor chamber that Samsung added to the S25 Ultra.\nWrap up\nWith the Galaxy S25, never has a Galaxy S series seemed more iterative. Fortunately, Samsung\u2019s premium smartphones are in a commanding position, so even with a screen (an cameras) that are now two years old, the Galaxy S25 isn\u2019t a bad smartphone. In fact, it\u2019s a very good one.\nI described the S25\u2019s cameras as consistent and I think that applies to the entire phone. The screen is bright, smooth and rich, the battery life is, frankly, incredible, while both performance scores and my experience with it prove this is a powerful flagship phone.\nI love the streamlined Gemini AI capabilities, which can take a voice command and easily turn it into a calendar entry, reminder and even plan my route. Even Galaxy AI diversions like the Portrait Studio offered more refined (and consistent) 3D cartoons and sketches of my portrait photos. I\u2019m not sure Samsung\u2019s features would warrant an AI subscription \u2014 I doubt many would pay for them as they stand.\nAnd that brings me to a bigger point: Besides a powerful new chip and AI tricks, why isn\u2019t the S25 cheaper? The Galaxy S25 is priced at $799 at launch, the same as the S24 and even the S23. The comparison you have to make isn\u2019t only with the latest iPhone, but also cheaper Android phones, like the $499 Pixel 8a. Or, unfortunately, the year-old Galaxy S24. Unless you\u2019re desperate for a bump in processing power and battery life, it would be wise to see how heavily last year\u2019s models get discounted in the coming months."

Honestly, I thought phone makers had gotten over their hunger for thinness nearly a decade ago. The quest to shave millimeters off devices resulted in worse battery life, extra heat and more limited features. So what gives?\nOn a certain level, just like fashion, older trends can over time become fresh and stylish again. Additionally, after phones made the transition to 5G \u2014 which required extra power, more complex modems and larger antennas \u2014 modern components have started shrinking again, essentially paving the way for the return of slimmer handsets. But then it hit me. While thinness may be the most striking thing about the Galaxy S25 Edge, that's not enough to justify the creation of a whole new device. Instead, I believe this phone is a part of a larger mission by Samsung to make the middle child of its flagship mobile lineup a more appealing member of the family. And when viewed in that light, I actually think it's largely a success.\nDesign\nWhile it suffers from a smaller battery and no telephoto lens, the S25 Edge is more than just a super sleek phone designed purely for extreme thinness.\n- Sleek design\n- Titanium frame\n- Big 200MP main cam\n- Bright OLED display\n- Smallest battery on any S25 phone\n- No telephoto lens\n- Mediocre wired charging speed\n- Not fully Qi2 compatible\nNow don't get me wrong, despite my gripes about how thinner phones are less practical, the S25 Edge is beautifully designed. At just 5.8mm thick (0.23 inches), it feels impossibly sleek. What might be even more impressive is that Samsung hasn't sacrificed durability to get here either. Just like the S25 Ultra, the Edge features a titanium frame, an IP68 rating for dust and water resistance and an even stronger Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 panel covering its display. The one difference is that the Edge's screen has a glossy finish instead of matte like on the Ultra because \u2014 and I kid you not \u2014 Samsung says an anti-reflective coating would have increased its thickness. Kudos to sticking to a strict design philosophy, because in terms of sheer feel and aesthetics, S25 Edge is undeniably enchanting.\nHowever, while the S25 Edge shares some characteristics with the Ultra, like its frame and main camera, at least when it comes to its overall size, it's really more of a refreshed take on the S25+. It has the same 6.7-inch OLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate that's just as vibrant and wonderfully colorful as before. Although it does weigh a bit less at 163 grams or 5.75 ounces versus the S25+ (190g or 6.7 oz).\nPerformance\nLike the rest of the S25 family, the Edge is powered by a Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip with 12GB of RAM and either 256GB or 512GB of storage. Despite the compact dimensions, Samsung still found room to squeeze a vapor chamber inside to prevent throttling and overheating. So even when pushed, the back of the phone rarely got more than lukewarm while delivering strong performance as I was gaming, multitasking or doing pretty much anything else you can think of.\nCameras\nThe other major departure from the S25+'s basic template is that the Edge features the 200MP main sensor from the Ultra, along with a 12MP ultra-wide cam. But there's no dedicated zoom. Now at first, I was a bit upset because I think any phone this expensive should have a telephoto lens. That said, the massive amount of pixels the Edge's primary sensor can capture means you have quite a bit of freedom to crop in without degrading image quality. You just need to remember to tell the camera to shoot in full 200MP mode instead of the standard 12MP setting. One other small change is that Edge features a slightly wider-angle 12MP selfie cam than the S25+ and Ultra, which allows you to fit more people in group shots, but that's really the main difference.\nIn general use, the S25 Edge takes great pics. Colors are rich and details are crisp, though you still get Samsung's slightly oversaturated hues and warmer tones. The same goes for low-light shots. For this review, instead of comparing it to a Pixel or iPhone, I pitted the Edge against the Motorola Razr Ultra. I feel like both are attempting to woo people who want a sleek and stylish device, but they are doing it in very different ways.\nWhat immediately jumped out is that foldable phones (at least the Razr) still lag behind more traditional glass bricks, even ones as thin as the Edge. In nearly every shot, Samsung's handset produced brighter, sharper and better-exposed images than Motorola's. So if you're the kind of person who wants a compact phone without needing to sacrifice image quality, the S25 Edge is a stronger pick.\nBattery life\nThe biggest trade-off when making a phone this skinny is having less room for its battery. As such, the S25 Edge has the smallest power pack in the family at 3,900 mAh, which is 100mAh less than what\u2019s in a base S25. This led to a time of just 25 hours and 59 minutes on our local video rundown test. That's not terrible, but it is three and a half hours less than what we got from the S25 Ultra (29:27) and two hours worse than a standard S25. For those who care a lot about longevity, you have been warned.\nThankfully, the S25 Edge still has support for wireless charging at an acceptable 15 watts, though its wired speeds are just average at 25 watts. However, as the phone is merely \"Qi2 ready,\" anyone who wants to use compatible magnetic wireless accessories will need to buy a case or an adhesive mount with a built-in magnet, because there isn't one inside the phone itself.\nWrap-up\nThe S25 Edge is a divisive phone. I still don't fully grasp the desire to make modern phones thinner than they already are. Particularly if you're like most folks and you throw the thing in a case as soon as you get it (even when accounting for Samsung's new super slim option). Shaving off an extra 1.5mm over the standard S25 doesn't really make a tangible difference in how you use it, unless you consider the phone's reduced battery life a good thing.\nBut as an alternative to the humdrum S25+, suddenly things get a lot more interesting. Samsung's previous middle child costs significantly more than a base S25, but it doesn't have the fancy features like a super high-res main camera or a titanium frame like you get on the S25 Ultra. Really, the S25+'s most attractive feature is a nicely-sized 6.7-inch screen.\nNow here's where the Galaxy S25 Edge comes in. It has all of those things alongside a super thin and wonderfully crafted chassis for the same $1,100 starting price as the S25+. Yes, Samsung sacrificed some battery capacity and the phone's dedicated zoom to get here, but those aren't straight-up dealbreakers. That's because with the Edge, the new in-between member of Samsung's flagship mobile family is more than just skinny \u2014 it has a stylish identity that can stand on its own."
