  "content": "HASLINDA: LIVE FROM SINGAPORE THIS IS HASLINDA ALMOND. CHINA'S MOST VALUABLE COMPANY IS SET TO REPORT EARNINGS AND INVESTOR FOCUSES ON TENCENT AND THEIR AI PUSH IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE MARKET. MEANWHILE BLOOMBERG LEARNS THAT BEIJING IS URGING LOCAL FARMS TO LIMIT THE USE OF NVIDIA'S H20 CHIPS SEEN AS CRITICAL TO CHINA'S AI DEVELOPMENT. I'LL ASK AND AI POLICY EXPERT WHETHER CHIPS FROM HUAWEI AND OTHERS CAN REALLY REPLACE NVIDIA AND AMD. AS STOCKS RALLY IN HOPES OF A FRED -- FED RATE CUT, WE SPEAK TO A CIO ABOUT WHICH ORCHIDS COULD BENEFIT MOST. PLUS, INDIA AND CHINA RESUMING DIRECT FLIGHTS AFTER MORE THAN FIVE YEARS AS BOTH SIDES THOUGH TO RESET TIES IN THE FACE OF THEIR SOURING RELATIONS WITH THE U.S. AI WILL BE A BIG FOCUS FOR INVESTORS TODAY AS CHINA'S MOST VALUABLE COMPANY REPORTS EARNINGS. TENCENT IS SET TO RELEASE ITS SECOND-QUARTER NUMBERS WITH ANALYSTS EXPECTING ITS LOWEST PROFIT GROWTH IN OVER A YEAR. THE COMPANY IS GRAPPLING WITH THE COMPANY IS GRAPPLING WITH A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES FROM SLOWING CONSUMER SPENDING TO ONGOING CHIP TENSIONS WITH THE U.S., BUT THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW THESE FACTORS ARE IMPACTING IT'S AMBITIOUS AI GROWTH STRATEGY. FOR MORE LET'S GO TO OUR CHINA CORRESPONDENT, MINMIN LOW IN HONG KONG. WHAT ARE WE ANTICIPATING? THERE ARE TWO REVENUE CENTERS FOR TENSION, ONE IS GAMING AND THE OTHER IS AD REVENUE. TENCENT IS RELATIVELY SHIELDED FROM THE TARIFF IMPACT BUT IT MIGHT FEEL THE IMPACT ON THE ECONOMY, IF IT IS DOWN THAT COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON ITS ADDRESS ANY. AI SPENDING IS SOMETHING TO WATCH, WHETHER IT TO INCREASED ADVERTISING REVENUE ON HIS VIDEO ACCOUNT SERVICES. IN TERMS OF THE GAMING PIPELINE, INVESTORS WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S IN THE PIPELINE FOR THE NEXT 6-9 MONTHS BECAUSE WE KNOW THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN SPEEDING UP THE APPROVAL OF GAMES AND WE KNOW IT HAS A NEW GAME DUE TO LAUNCH SOON, THE PC VERSION IS ALREADY OUT AND IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE GAMING SEGMENT REVENUE. IT'S PRETTY HOPEFUL, WERE LOOKING AT A DOUBLE-DIGIT INCREASE IN REVENUE, 11% IS THE FORECAST. IT WOULD BE THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE QUARTER OF DOWNWARD DIGIT REVENUE EVEN AS WE EXPECT EARNINGS TO NORMALIZE THIS YEAR, BECAUSE THE SHARE PRICES HAVE BEEN SO CHEAP IN TERMS OF VALUATION, YOU COMPARE IT TO ITS PEERS LIKE NINTENDO AND SONY, IS NOW TRADING ABOUT 17 TIMES PRICE TO EARNINGS CONSIDERED VERY CHEAP. THERE SOME HOPES THAT MAYBE TENCENT WOULD BE ABLE TO SEE ITS SHARE PRICES AT HISTORICAL HIGHS AFTER THE EARNINGS. YOU CAN TELL THIS CHART THE EARNINGS ARE HITTING A HIGHS BUT SHARE PRICES ARE STILL 25% BELOW THE PEAK SO THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR GROWTH THERE. HASLINDA: AND IT COULD BE A CATALYST FOR TECH. COULD WE SEE ANY GUIDANCE WHATSOEVER RELATED TO THE CURRENT CONCERNS OVER ACCESS TO? NVIDIA'S H20 CHIPS > > IS SOMETHING WE WILL BE LOOKING OUT FOR DURING THE EARNINGS CALL. WE KNOW THE EXPORT LICENSES ARE FINALLY COMING THROUGH BUT WE UNDERSTAND FROM REUTERS REPORTING THAT TENCENT WAS AMONG THE COMPANIES THAT HAD BEEN SUMMONED BY REGULATORS WHO WERE QUESTIONING THE COMPANIES, WHY ARE THEY CHOOSING TO BUY H20 CHIPS AS OPPOSED TO DOMESTIC HOMEGROWN SHIPS, AND WHETHER THEY NOTICE ANY SECURITY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. DOES IT MEAN THAT PRIVATE COMPANIES LIKE TENCENT WOULD CHOOSE TO REDUCE OR STOP THEIR PURCHASES OF H20 ALL TOGETHER, TO SWITCH TO LOCAL CHIPS, AND WHAT IS IT MEAN FOR THEIR AI DEVELOPMENT? SO FAR WE KNOW THAT THE H20 IS MY FOR THE MOST ADVANCED CHIPS THAT CHINESE COMPANIES CAN GET THEIR HANDS ON. LOCAL CHIPS ARE NOT AS VERSATILE WHEN IT COMES TO THE SPECIFIC WORKLOADS NEEDED FOR AI. THIS IS SOMETHING WE WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH, WHETHER OR NOT COMPANIES LIKE TENCENT ARE GOING TO SHIFT THEIR BUYING PATTERN WHEN IT COMES TO THE U.S. CHIPS BECAUSE IT COULD SET A PRECEDENT FOR OTHER TECH COMPANIES AS WELL. HASLINDA: GREAT REPORTING THERE, MINMIN LOW IN HONG KONG. AS INVESTORS FOCUS ON CHINA'S AI PROGRESS, SOURCES TELL BLOOMBERG BEIJING IS LOOK -- URGING LOCAL FIRMS TO AVOID AGE 20 ESPECIALLY FOR GOVERNMENT USE. IT'S NOT YET AN OUTRIGHT BAN. INDUSTRY ANALYSTS BROUGHT -- BROADLY AGREE CHINESE COMPANY STILL NEED NVIDIA CHIPS TO RUN SOME APPLICATIONS. THERE'S NO WAY AROUND. SO CHINA IS IN KIND OF A PICKLE, IT'S A STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE THE U.S. HAS IN TECHNOLOGY, WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE ALWAYS HAD. HASLINDA: OUR NEXT GUEST THINK THIS MOVE I CHINA SIGNALS THAT DOMESTIC ALTERNATIVES REMAIN IN ADEQUATE, EVEN AS IT PRESSES FORWARD SUPPLIERS. HIS RESEARCH FOCUSES ON ADVANCED AI SYSTEMS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON DEVELOPMENT AND SECURITY IMPLICATIONS. GOOD TO HAVE A WITH US. FOR ALL THE PUSHBACK WE ARE SEEING FROM CHINA IN TERMS OF AGE 20 CHIPS, CHINA NEEDS THESE CHIPS, AT LEAST FOR NOW. ABSOLUTELY THAT BEEN TRYING TO DO SO, BUT YOU LOOK AT THE BEST AI SHIP FROM HUAWEI, IT'S ONLY 80% AS GOOD AS NVIDIA'S CHIP THAT CAME OUT TWO OR THREE YEARS AGO. SO THEY ARE STILL LAGGING BEHIND IN TERMS OF HABIT THE CHIPS ARE. BUT MORE PORTLY, HAPPY CHIPS THEY CAN PRODUCE. IT WAS SAID WHILE I CAN ONLY PRODUCE 200,000 CHIPS WHERE WE'VE SEEN REPORTS OF THEM SELLING UP TO A MILLION H20'S. HASLINDA: SO IT IS A MATTER OF CAPACITY, HOW ABOUT A MATTER OF QUALITY? IT GOES HAND-IN-HAND. IF YOU CANNOT PRODUCE THAT MANY, JUST LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS, THERE IS WAY MORE THAN THERE IS NUMBERS. IF THEY SWITCH TO HUAWEI CHIPS, THEY NEED TO REDEVELOP SOFTWARE AND IT TAKES TIME. WE'VE HEARD ABOUT OVERHEATING ISSUES WITH THESE CHIPS, THE SOFTWARE ECOSYSTEM IS NOT AS MATURE AS THE CHIPS. YOU SAY THAT -- YOU SEE THE SAME IN THE U.S., IT'S A TINY MARKET SHARE, LESS THAN 5%. DESPITE ON PAPER PRODUCING REALLY GOOD CHIPS. HASLINDA: THE THING IS CHINA HAS ALSO EXPRESSED THE SAME KIND OF SECURITY CONCERNS US THE U.S., ON THAT VULNERABILITY CHINA, WHEN IT COMES TO USING THOSE H20 CHIPS FROM NVIDIA. I PERSONALLY THINK IT IS UNLIKELY, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TRIGGERED THIS INVESTIGATION IN THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT. THEY'RE ARE CURRENTLY DISCUSSIONS IN THE U.S., ABOUT A LOCATION VERIFICATION TECHNIQUE. THE IDEA WAS FOR CHIPS TO GO TO MALAYSIA TO MAKE SURE THEY DON'T END UP IN CHINA. THERE WAS NO -- NVIDIA THEMSELVES CAME OUT SAYING THEY COULD SECURE THE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE HERE. WE'VE SEEN CHINA BECOMING GENERALLY MORE SKEPTICAL AND PUSHING TO DOMESTIC ALTERNATIVES HERE. SO CREATING DOMESTIC DEMAND FOR THESE INFERIOR CHIPS BUT TO EVENTUALLY IN THE LONG RUN TO HAVE A TRANSITION. HASLINDA: U.S. HAS SAID IT IS MULLING OVER LOCATION TRIGGERS TO ENSURE THAT THERE CHIPS DON'T IN UP IN THE WRONG HANDS. I'M WONDERING HOW THIS MIGHT PLAY OUT. MY PLAYERS LIKE NVIDIA BE FORCED TO INCLUDE THIS IN THEIR CHIPS, AND WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS MIGHT BE. RIGHT NOW IT'S ONLY A PROPOSED BILL THAT IS BEING DISCUSSED ON THE HILL, AS WE SAY IN D.C.. IT IS THE CASE THAT THE AI ACTION PLAN WHICH CAME OUT, THEY SAID LOCATION VERIFICATION MAY BE ONE THING THEY WANT TO INCLUDE IN CHIPS, BUT THE IDEA IS TO PREVENT SMUGGLING. WHETHER THEY GO TO MALAYSIA, THE UAE OR OTHER COUNTRIES WHERE THE GOVERNMENT IS CONCERNED THEY MAY BE SMUGGLING HOTSPOTS AND THEY COULD VERIFIABLY IN UP IN CHINA AND THERE'S NOTHING YOU COULD DO ABOUT IT. SO THE SECURITY CONCERN HERE IS NOT ABOUT THE CHIPS GOING TO CHINA. THE LOCATION VERIFICATION, THE NEW PROPOSAL TALKS ABOUT CHIPS GOING TO CHINA. HASLINDA: HOW DO YOU DO THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE? DO YOU MAKE CHANGES TO THE CHIPS ITSELF? HELP SHED LIGHT ON HOW THIS CAN BE DONE. THERE ARE DIFFERENT PROPOSALS HERE, THE THING ABOUT GPS, IS CLEARLY NOT A GOOD IDEA BECAUSE IT CAN GET JAMMED AND CHANGE. THERE HAVE BEEN TECHNICAL PAPERS THAT PROPOSE SOMETHING, YOU LOOK AT DATA CENTERS SPREAD OUT AROUND THE WORLD, YOU CAN TRIANGULATE WHERE THE CHIP IS. WITHIN SOME YOU CAN TELL IF IT'S MALAYSIA OR IF IT ENDS UP IN CHINA. THEY ARE PRETTY CONFIDENT NVIDIA COULD IMPLEMENT THIS IF THEY WANTED A FIRMWARE UPDATE, YOU DON'T NEED TO CREATE NEW HARDWARE FOR THIS. HASLINDA: THERE'S SO MUCH TALK, AND PERHAPS QUESTIONS AROUND AI LEADERSHIP AND SOME SAY THAT CHINA IS CLOSING THE GAP. GIVE ASSISTANCE OF WHAT IS THE TRUE METRIC FOR AI LEADERSHIP, AND WHERE DOES CHINA STAND RIGHT NOW? AS A SCIENTIST I MUST SAY THERE IS NOT A SINGLE BEST METRIC. YOU LOOK AT BENCHMARK PERFORMANCE, HOW WILL DO LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS PERFORM, CLOSE TO THE BEST MODELS COMING OUT OF THE U.S.. THE METRIC I'VE BEEN PUTTING FORWARD, HOW MUCH ROOM IS EFFORT TRAINING? ? AND DEPLOYING AI MODELS IN THE U.S. IS CLEARLY LEADING. THERE CHIPS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER, THE RECENT STUDIES SOME COLLEAGUES OF MINE DID BASICALLY FOUND THAT THE U.S. HOST 70% HAVE AN ADVERSE IN A BALL AI COMPUTERS AROUND THE WORLD. THE U.S. IS CLEARLY IN THE LEAD HERE. STARTING IN THE FIRST TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND ENHANCED BY THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION. THEY CONTINUED STRUGGLING IN THE FUTURE, IT WILL DEFINITELY GET BETTER, BUT CATCHING UP WITH THE REST OF THE WORLD IS HARD IF THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE MOST CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY AND IF THEY CAN BUY THE BEST AI CHIPS. IT'S A REALLY GOOD CHIP FOR AI DEPLOYMENT. THIS WOULD MAKE COMPANIES LIKE DEEPSEEK AND OTHERS MORE COMPETITIVE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT SELL EXCESS FOR CHEAPER HERE. SO IT MAKES THE COMPANIES MORE COMPETITIVE. HASLINDA: IF YOU ARE RIGHT THAT THE U.S. IS LEADING BY A MILE, COULD THE U.S. BE OVERREACTING TO CHINA'S AI DEVELOPMENT? IT DEPENDS HOW FAR YOU WANT THE GAP TO BE. AGAIN, THERE ARE MANY PATRICK'S. IF YOU LOOK AT HOW GOOD INDIVIDUAL MODELS ARE, THE LEAD IS NOT THAT FAR. HALF A YEAR OR A COUPLE OF MONTHS, IF YOU LOOK AT THE BEST PERFORMANCE HERE. ONE NEEDS TO BE CAUTIOUS HERE AND TAKE ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT METRICS INTO CONSIDERATION. HOW MUCH ARE YOU DIFFUSING IT ACROSS THE ECONOMY? CHINA MIGHT BE BETTER AT DIFFUSING IT ACROSS THE ECONOMY. U.S. ENERGY WAS A BIG TOPIC IN CHINA IS CLEARLY A BETTER WITH MORE ENERGY CAPACITY WHICH HELPS TO FUEL MORE AI POWER IN THE FUTURE. BOTH ARE STRUGGLING HERE SO IT'S CLEARLY NOT OVER YET. THERE ARE MANY METRICS HERE AND SOME OF IT MIGHT MATTER. IT DEPENDS ON PEOPLE'S DIFFERENT OPINIONS. HASLINDA: TO THAT END, I SPOKE TO A WHITE HOUSE OFFICIAL JUST LAST WEEK AND HE DID SAY THAT THE NEXT TRAIL BRACING -- TRAILBLAZING BREAKTHROUGHS WILL BE MADE ON AMERICAN TECH. CAN YOU BE SO SURE OF THAT? I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY. THE MAJORITY WERE TRAINED ON NVIDIA. DEEPSEEK TRAINED ON NVIDIA. SO WE DON'T SEE LEADING MODELS BEEN TRAINED ON HUAWEI CHIPS. EVEN THOUGH THOSE CHIPS ARE STILL BEING BUILT ON MACHINES, THEY ARE BUILT ON TOP OF U.S. TECHNOLOGY. AGAIN, DEPENDS ON THE DEFINITION BUT IT IS ALL OVER THERE. PEOPLE STILL PUBLISH PAPERS AND GET NEW INSIGHTS, OR COME OUT WITH NEW MODELS. WE DON'T KNOW ALL THE DETAILS, BUT PEOPLE LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW MUCH THE MODELS COST IN THESE KIND OF INSIGHTS ALSO DIFFUSE IT, BUT ALSO THE OTHER WAY AROUND OF COURSE. HASLINDA: SO MUCH PERSPECTIVE THERE, THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY AND STICKING AROUND AS WE DISCUSSED THE IMPLICATIONS OF AIA'S PERPLEXITIES, THE MASSIVE OFFER TO BUY GOOGLE'S CHROME BROWSER. HSTECH HAS RELATIVES MUCH IS 2%. SOME SAYING TENCENT RESULTS COULD PROVIDE THE CATALYST FOR THE CURRENCY, ABOUT 2.2%. KEEP IT HERE WITH US. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a HASLINDA: WELCOME BACK TO INSIGHT. $35 MILLION BID TO ACQUIRE GOOGLE'S CHROME BROWSER, PERPLEXITY IS SEEKING TO LEVERAGE CRUMBS USER BASE TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE IN THE AI SURGE RACE. LET'S GET BACK TO LEONARD WITH GRANT. THIS IS A BOLD MOVE, A $35 BILLION MOVE. WHY WHEN PERPLEXITY ITSELF HAS ITS OWN WEB BROWSER? TO BE HONEST, IT FOR ME IT'S A FIRST TIME HEARING THIS. IT'S A MOST POPULAR BROWSER IN THE WORLD, AND EVERYBODY IS USING IT. IT SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY BOLD AND GOOD BUSINESS MOVE, TRYING TO INTEGRATE IT. I THINK THEY MIGHT TRY TO DO IT IN THIS CASE. HASLINDA: WOULD YOU SAY IT IS A LONG SHOT, LEONARD? IT SOUNDS LIKE A LONGSHOT. AGAIN, I'M NOT AN ANTITRUST LAWYER WHO SO I CAN'T BEAT TO THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING AND IF IT IS THE RIGHT CASE. PERPLEXITY IS A YOUNG COMPANY, AND CHROME HAS BEEN THERE A LONG TIME. APPLE, AMAZON, PROBABLY ALL OF THEM WOULD LOVE TO BUY APPLE -- LOVE TO BUY CHROME. IT WOULD BE A PERFECT WAY TO GET A USER BASE AND A PERFECT WAY TO INTEGRATE IT, BUT IT SOUNDS LIKE A LONG SHOT. HASLINDA: WHAT IS IN IT FOR PERPLEXITY? HOW DO YOU THINK IT MIGHT GAIN THE BENEFIT OF PAYING $25 BILLION FOR CHROME? WE SEE COMPANIES PUT OUT OF BROWSER TOOL, THE BEST EXAMPLE IS AI EDGE SOME POINT SHOULD BE ABLE TO PURCHASE MY FLIGHT TICKETS. I GET AI TO OPEN UP THE BROWSER, GO TO THE WEBSITE AND CHECK AROUND. THIS WOULD BE A HUGE WIN. IT MIGHT MAKE THE ANTITRUST CASE EVEN WORSE. INTEGRATING GEMINI EVERYWHERE ELSE, IF YOU START OPENING UP GOOGLE WORKSPACE AND START WRITING A DOCUMENT ON GOOGLE SHEET, GEMINI IS INTEGRATED IN THAT. AGAIN, THE BROWSER IS THE PORTAL TO THE INTERNET, AND HAVING AI THERE, THE CASE IS PRETTY CLEAR, IT'S A PORTAL TO THE FUTURE AND INTEGRATING AI THERE MIGHT ONLY HELP. HASLINDA: THE COURSE THE ALLEGATION HERE IS THAT IT'S ANTI-COMPETITION. I'M JUST WONDERING HOW GOOGLE MIGHT RESPOND TO IT, WHAT MEASURES CAN GOOGLE TAKE TO PERHAPS LET THOSE CONCERNS? GOOGLE RIGHT NOW IS NOT IMPLEMENTING AI DIRECTLY INTO THE BROWSER. I STILL NEED TO GO ON GO DOCKS AND THEN I SEE THE GEMINI APP THERE, IS NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ROUSER. IF GOOGLE COMES OUT TOMORROW THAT ALL THE PRODUCTS HAVE A WAY TO PROMOTE THEM ON THE SEARCH PAGE ART IMPLEMENTED AUTOMATICALLY, THIS WILL ONLY MAKE THE CASE WORSE. HASLINDA: WE KNOW THAT FOR A COMPANY LIKE PERPLEXITY, IT IS GAINING RECOGNITION IN THE AI SPACE. I'M JUST WONDERING, HOW AI MIGHT CHANGE THE FACE OF PERPLEXITY, WHAT ARE THE PROSPECTS OF THE COMPANY GOING FORWARD, DO YOU THINK? SINCE A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO IT HAS BEEN GOING DOWN. THE FIRST AI TOOL ALLOWED FOR SEARCH, IN THE PAST WE HAD THE PROBLEM WITH THE LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL, IT ONLY KNEW WHAT IT REMEMBERED, WHAT IT WAS TRAINED ON BUT IT COULD NOT READ THE NEWS OF THE DAY. TO GET THE NEWS OF THE DAY TO PUT IT TOGETHER AND WRITE A SUMMARY, IT WAS REALLY SLOW. GEMINI NOW SUPPORTS ALL OF THIS. I WOULD PERSONALLY EXPECT THE USER BASE OF PERPLEXITY ACTUALLY GOING DOWN AND THEN JUST FACING MORE COMPETITION. YOU CONTRACT WITH ONE OF THE BIG COMPANIES, SO THEY ONLY HAVE LIKE SOME SCAFFOLDING AROUND IT. BUT I COULD BE WRONG, I HAVEN'T CHECKED IT RECENTLY. HASLINDA: IN TERMS OF THEMES ARISING FROM AI, WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST ONES YOU ARE KEEPING AN EYE ON? AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE BEGINNING, WERE TALKING ABOUT CHIP EXPORT CONTROLS, AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF ITEMS WHERE EVERYBODY IS DESPERATELY WAITING TO LEARN MORE DETAILS. MORE DATA CENTERS, THERE'S DISCUSSION AROUND EXPORTING MORE AI TECH AROUND THE WORLD AND WE WILL SEE WHERE THIS EVENTUALLY WILL LAND. THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING, BUT MOST OF THE TIME OF THE LAST FEW DAYS AND HOURS, WITH THE H20 BEING SOLD IN RETURN FOR 50% -- THIS IS WHERE MY ATTENTION WAS AT AND I CAN'T WAIT TO HEAR WHAT WE LEARN NEXT. HASLINDA: IT'S ALSO INTERESTING TO SEE THAT AI STARTUPS LIKE PERPLEXITY MAKING SUCH A HUGE IMPACT IN THE WORLD. HOW DO YOU SEE ALL THE STARTUPS SHAPING THE AI SPACE 12-24 MONTHS FROM HERE? THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN BIG DISCUSSION IN THE AI STARTUPS SPACE ON USING AI'S MODELS OR SOMETHING AROUND IT. WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF TIMES AT THESE COMPANIES DID A LITTLE BETTER ON A SPECIFIC TASK, BUT ONLY A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER AI COMES UP AND PERFORMS WAY BETTER THAN ALL THESE COMPANIES. SO THESE COMPANIES HAVE IT REALLY HARD HERE BECAUSE THERE ARE BETTER AND BETTER MODELS. I THINK IS STILL A REALLY INTERESTING SPACE BUT WE WILL SEE UPS AND DOWNS. HASLINDA: GREAT STUFF, LEONARD, COMING UP WE TALK MARKET STRATEGY WITH B & B POWER BAR WEALTH MANAGEMENT INCLUDING THE FED'S RESPONSE ON THE ALLEGED INFLATION DATA. KEEP IT HERE WITH US. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a HASLINDA: WELCOME BACK. YOU ARE WATCHING INSIGHT. THE LATEST INFLATION RATINGS FOR JULY ARE LOOKING FOR THE FED TO CUT RATES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, WHILE CORE INFLATION DID ACCELERATE LAST MONTH. WITH AIRFARES, MEDICAL CARE, AND RECREATION COSTS RISING. LET'S DISCUSS THE POLICY DIRECTION AND ITS IMPACT ON ASIAN MARKETS WITH THE BNP PARIBAS WEALTH MANAGEMENT. THERE ARE STILL THINGS TO PLAY -- TO PLAY FOR BECAUSE WE HAVE PCE DATA AND EMPLOYMENT DATA AT THE BEGINNING OF NEXT MONTH. THOSE REVISIONS, 258,000 JOBS, THE CUT IS POSSIBLE. THE INFLATION DATA WE THINK WOULD PLAY OUT OVER MANY MONTHS BUT IN TERMS OF THE SERVICE INFLATION, IT IS STILL STICKY. WE SEE -- WE DON'T SEE 50 BASIS POINTS AS BEING REALISTIC AHEAD OF THE SEPTEMBER MEETING. HASLINDA: YOU SAY INFLATION CUT. WHY DO YOU THINK THEY ARE PUSHING FOR 50? HE THINKS THE FED SHOULD BE OPEN TO 50. THE FED SHOULD BE OPEN TO ANYTHING, INCLUDING RAISING RATES. THAT'S THE ASSUMPTION THE FED IS BEHIND THE CURVE. THEY HAVE A VIEW THE FED IS BEHIND THE CURVE. IF THEY HAVE VERY WEAK EMPLOYMENT DATA AT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER, THEN WE CAN START TO SAY THEY ARE TOO LATE AND THEY SHOULD HAVE CUT EARLIER. I THINK THE NONFARM PAYROLL WAS A BIG SURPRISE BUT THAT'S ONLY ONE MONTH. WHEN DOES NEXT MONTH,? THAT DEBATE WILL OBVIOUSLY INTENSIFY IF WE GET A NEGATIVE EMPLOYMENT NUMBER. SOME OF THE FED NUMBERS ARE LOOKING AT EMPLOYMENT MORE THAN INFLATION. AT THIS POINT THE LABOR MARKET IS NOT WEAK, THERE IS JUST LESS HIRING, NOT A GREAT DEAL OF FIRING. HASLINDA: THE S & P AT RECORD HIGHS NOW ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT CPI IS IN LINE WITH EXPECTATIONS , SUPPORTING THE NARRATIVE FOR A CUT. CPI IS REPORTING TO PERCENT PRICES, 0.5%. THAT IS NOT QUITE THE REASON TO BE CUTTING. SOME SAY YOU SHOULDN'T BE HAVING CUTS THIS YEAR AT ALL. IF THE PCE DATA ENDS UP BEING MORE RESILIENT END OF THE MONTH, IT DOESN'T LOOK AT THIS POINT. PAYROLL DATA IS POSITIVE AGAIN. STOCKMARKETS AT ALL-TIME HIGHS. THEY COULD BE PUSHED DOWN. WE ARE FINALLY BALANCED. A QUARTER-POINT CUT, DOES IT DRAMATICALLY CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF THE ECONOMY? NO. THE KEY THING IS TO LOOK AT THE LONG END OF THE CURVE. IF THEY CUT 25 AND THE 10 YEAR YIELDS INCREASE, THE BOND MARKET SAYS YOU ARE CUTTING TOO EARLY. RIGHT NOW THE BOND MARKET IS PRICING IN THE RATE CUT. POLICY BY CUTTING TOO EARLY AS TOO LATE. HASLINDA: THAT'S BEFORE THE TARIFF IMPACT COMES INTO PLAY. IT'S MAKING IT COMPLICATED FOR CENTRAL BANKS AROUND THE WORLD, NOT JUST THE FED. WE HAVE THE BOT COMING UP WITH ITS OWN DECISION TODAY, LIKELY TO CUT FURTHER. DO YOU SEE ASIAN CENTER BANKS HAVING TO DO THIS CUT IN ANTICIPATION? IT'S A GOOD POINT. THE GOOD NEWS IS THE DOLLAR IS WEAK. IT'S BEEN CYCLICALLY STRONG. ASIAN CENTRAL BANKS CAN'T CUT RATES IF THERE ECONOMY IS WEAK BECAUSE THEY ARE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR OWN CURRENCY AGAINST THE DOLLAR. THIS IS A LIFELINE FOR ASIAN CENTRAL BANKS. WHATEVER THE SCENARIO, THAT'S A SCENARIO WHERE THE DOLLAR SHOULD OUTPERFORM A LOT. THEY CAN RUN MONETARY POLICY MORE TO LOCAL CONDITIONS, NOT WORRY ABOUT FX OUTFLOWS. IN THE CASE OF THAILAND AND OTHER COUNTRIES, THEY HAVE MORE FREEDOM. WE HAVE SEEN GRADUAL CUTS THIS YEAR. THE WEAKER DOLLAR IS A LOOSENING OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS. HASLINDA: HOW MUCH CAN THE DOLLAR WEAKEN FROM HERE? WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE U.S. ECONOMY AS A WHOLE, IT DOES SEEM LIKE IT IS STILL RESILIENT FUNDAMENTALLY. WE DON'T HAVE A RECESSION CALL FOR THE U.S. WE HAVE SLOWING GROWTH. THE DOLLAR WAS CYCLICALLY STRONG. WE HAD A BIG RALLY IN THE DOLLAR. THIS IS ABOUT BRINGING DOWN THAT DOLLAR STRENGTH. WE HAD A 50% MOVE IN THE DOLLAR BETWEEN 2009 TO 2022. THE DOLLAR WEAKNESS IS A LITTLE EXAGGERATED BUT WE EXPECT MODEST WEAKENING FROM HERE TO THE END OF THE YEAR BECAUSE WE DO EXPECT MODEST RATE CUTS. A LITTLE BIT OF AN INSURANCE CUT BECAUSE OF THE EMPLOYMENT WEAKNESS. HASLINDA: HOW DO YOU PLAY THE U.S. MARKET? WE HAVE SEEN A NARROWING IN THE MARKET WHEN THAT HAS LED PERFORMANCE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. FOR IT TO GO MATERIALLY HIGHER, WE NEED A BROADENING OF THE MARKET. EARNINGS SEASON WAS STRONG, AVERAGE OF 7% BEAT. THE SECTORS THAT LOOK STRONGER HEALTH CARE. WE ARE WAITING FOR THE SECTOR TARIFFS. WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE POLICY RISK BUT A LOT OF THAT IS PRICED IN. THERE ARE SECTORS IN THE U.S. THAT HAVE LAGGED THIS MOVE OVERALL. HASLINDA: MAG 7, IS IT CONTINGENT ON NVIDIA, WHICH HAS YET TO REPORT EARNINGS? MAG 7 IS A GOOD WAY TO PHRASE IT HISTORICALLY. IT'S ALMOST LIKE MAG THREE VERSUS MAG FOUR. CLEARLY THE COMPANY IS OUTPERFORMING NOW ARE THE ONES THAT HAVE ANY CLOSENESS TO AI SEMICONDUCTOR SPENDING. THOSE ARE THE ONES BENEFITING THE MOST, WHILE OTHER SECTORS THAT ARE NOT RELATED ARE UNDERPERFORMING. I WOULD EXPECT GOING FORWARD MORE STOCKPICKING WITHIN THE MAG 7. CLEARLY THE EARNINGS POWER IS STILL STRONG, IT IS JUST CONVERGING WITH THE REST OF THE MARKET. HASLINDA: HOW CLOSELY ARE YOU WATCHING TRUMP POLICIES WHEN IT COMES TO AI AND TECH? WE ARE SEEING A LOT OF CHANGES OF LATE. HOW WILL THAT IMPACT THE WAY YOU LOOK AT YOUR APPETITE TO INVEST IN AI PLAYS? TWO THINGS. THERE IS THE FOREIGN POLICY RISK. THAT HAS BEEN THERE FOR SOME TIME WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP AND THE FOCUS ON SEMICONDUCTORS. THE WHOLE RE-SHORING UP THE SUPPLY CHAIN WILL CONTINUE BUT THAT'S A FIVE-YEAR STORY. TAKING AWAY THE POLITICAL RISK IS, WHAT'S THE ROI ON AI? RIGHT NOW WE KNOW ALL ARE GOING UP. A LOT OF THE HYPERSCALERS HAVE UPPED YEAR TO DATE EVEN AFTER WHAT WE SAW IT IN THE YEAR. CLEARLY THERE IS AN ROI. WE SEE PRODUCTIVITY BENEFITS IN U.S. CORPORATE BUT IS IT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY FURTHER UPGRADES? HASLINDA: THE BOND MARKET, HOW DO WE PLAY THIS? ARE A 10 YEAR YIELD FOCUSES FOR .25 AND WE HIT THAT. WE THINK WE ARE AROUND FAIR VALUE ON THE 10 YEAR. SO WE KIND OF THINK IT'S FAIR VALUE SO WE FAVOR THE SHORTER END OF THE CURVE, THREE TO SEVEN YEARS GIVEN THE RALLY WE HAVE SEEN IN TREASURIES. IF THERE IS YIELD PICKUPS -- THE TREASURIES HAVE BEEN IN A NARROW RANGE FOR 18 MONTHS. WHEN WE SEE THE 10 YEAR AGO FOR .5 TO 4.7%, WE WOULD LENGTHEN DURATION TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. SOME SAY WHEN IT COMES TO 10 YEAR YIELDS, 4.5 WOULD BE THE MINIMAL. IF ANYTHING WOULD BE ABOVE 4.5. IF YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE LONG-TERM INFLATION EXPECTATIONS WOULD END UP, WE ARE NOT SEEING A BIG CHANGE IN LONG-TERM INFLATION EXPECTATION. COULD BE 4.5% ON 10 YEAR BE REALISTIC? WE WOULD NEED BASICALLY PRODUCTIVITY AS WELL AS EMPLOYMENT GROWTH TO CONTINUE TO COME DOWN TO REALLY DRIVE BACK. LONGER TERM WHEN WE LOOK AT U.S. TREND GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY, IT'S ABOUT 2.5. HASLINDA: WE HAVE TO HIGHLIGHT THE BREAKING NEWS, JAPAN'S FIVE YEAR BOND AUCTION DRAWING THE WEAKEST DEMAND RATIO SINCE 2020 AGAINST A BACKDROP OF CONCERNS ABOUT POOR LIQUIDITY, VOLATILITY IN JAPAN'S DEBT MARKET, PERHAPS NOT SURPRISING. THE BOND VIGILANTES ARE OUT. IT'S SUMMERTIME, A HOLIDAY WEEK. THERE WAS A HOLIDAY EARLIER IN JAPAN. WE SAW ANOTHER OPTION EARLIER IN THE WEEK. THIS COULD CONTINUE. IN THE SHORT TERM THERE IS LESS DEMAND IN JAPAN FOR 10 AND 30 YEAR PAPER. PEOPLE ARE MORE NERVOUS GLOBALLY BECAUSE ALL COUNTRIES HAVE DEBT. AT THE SAME TIME, JAPANESE YIELDS ARE AT A LEVEL PREVIOUS TO THE HOLIDAY WEEK WHERE YOU ARE SEEING A TOPPING OUT OF THOSE YIELDS. IF WE SEE THE JAPANESE 30 YEAR GO WELL AND HOLD THAT, WE BECOME MORE ALARMED ABOUT BOND VIGILANTES. THE BOJ ALSO UNDER PRESSURE TO RAISE RATES WITH WAGE INFLATION PICKING UP IN JAPAN. HASLINDA: THE QUESTION IS WHETHER IT WILL END WHEN. THEY ACT VERY INCREMENTALLY. WE HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH POLITICS IN JAPAN, WAITING FOR THAT SHAKEOUT. WAGE INFLATION HAS PICKED UP, GROWTH IS REASONABLY STRONG. I THINK THEY WILL RAISE RATES, PERHAPS NOT ON THE PROJECT READ THE MARKET WANTS BUT IN THE UPCOMING MEETINGS. HASLINDA: FOR THE YEAR WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT? ANOTHER ONE TO TWO RATE RISES IS POSSIBLE IN JAPAN. HASLINDA: WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN FOR THE YEN? HOW DO YOU SEE THE YEN TRADING FROM HERE? STRONGER, CLOSER TO 140 AS WE GO THROUGH THE YEAR. BECAUSE OF THIS DELAY IN THE RATE HIKES IN JAPAN, WE HAVE HAD A LITTLE YEN WEAKNESS AND A DOLLAR REBOUND BECAUSE THIS -- BECAUSE THERE WAS SUCH EXCESSIVE DOLLAR WEAKNESS UNTIL A MONTH AGO. SIX TO 12 MONTHS OUT, WE THINK 140 ON DOLLAR-YEN. HASLINDA: I WONDER IF THE BOJ WOULD ALSO BE LOOKING AT THE FED, WHETHER IT MAKES THOSE CUTS OR NOT. OTHER CENTRAL BANKS TAKE THEIR CUE FROM THE FED. WHAT THE FED DOES IS ALSO IMPORTANT BEFORE THE BOJ ACTS. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN DOMESTIC ISSUES AND INFLATION IN JAPAN IS FINALLY WELL ABOVE 2%. HASLINDA: THE RISK FOR THE BOJ, YOU THINK. THIS IS A GENERATIONAL CHANGE FOR JAPAN, INFLATION ABOVE 2%. SOME YEARS AGO WE HAD A FEAR WE COULD EVEN GET TO 2% BECAUSE THEY COULD NOT FOR A LONG TIME. IT'S A BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT'S HAPPENING DOMESTICALLY. THE GOOD NEWS IS THE TARIFF SITUATION IS GETTING MORE CLARIFIED. JAPAN HAS A RATES. THAT PART OF THE UNCERTAINTY IS GONE, SO THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SEE WHAT IS THE FED DOING FOR THEIR OWN DOMESTIC ECONOMY? AND FLIPSIDE WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH OUR INFLATION. HASLINDA: HANG TIGHT, HE IS STICKING WITH US. LET'S LOOK AT INDIAN MARKETS AHEAD OF THE OPEN. WE HAVE THE RBIS STANDING PAT AND THAT IS PERHAPS EXPECTED TO BE A CATALYST FOR INDIAN STOCKS, LOOKING TO BE IN THE POSITIVE IN TERMS OF THE PREMARKET SESSION, UP ABOUT .3%. BENCHMARKS ALSO IN THE POSITIVE RIGHT NOW. KEEP IT HERE WITH US. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a HASLINDA: INDIA JUST KICKED OFF ITS TRADING. EARLY GET GO FOR THE MARKET, IT IS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE GREEN TODAY ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE REGION. SINCE X UP BY .4%. THE CPI PRINT AT THE LOWEST LEVEL IN ABOUT EIGHT YEARS. IT GIVES THE RBIS SCOPE TO CUT RATES EARLIER. IN TERMS OF THE INDIAN RUBY, 8762 IS THE LEVEL, UP ABOUT .2%. BNP PARIBAS WEALTH MANAGEMENT IS STILL WITH US. SINCE 2009, INDIA AFTER THE U.S. IS THE BEST-PERFORMING EQUITY MARKET. FUNDAMENTALS IN TERMS OF RETURN ON EQUITY, OBVIOUSLY THAT STORY IS CLEAR. THE ISSUE IS THE VALUATION LEVEL. THAT'S A 50 5% PREMIUM TO ASIAN EQUITIES. ASIAN EQUITIES JUST GOT A LITTLE TOO CHEAP. RELATIVE DISTINCTION UPSIDE IS NOT AS MUCH. YOU ARE SEEING A SLOWDOWN IN DEMAND. EARNINGS SEASON WAS ABOUT 10% GROWTH BY 2% MESON EXPECTATION. HASLINDA: THE RBIS COULD CUT RATES EARLIER. WE HAVE RETAIL INVESTORS ALL KEEN. LONG-TERM WE AGREED. THERE IS A DOMESTIC RETAIL BUYING OF THE MARKET. THE INFLATION DATA IN INDIA IS BETTER AND THAT OPENS UP A RATE CUT BETWEEN NOW AND THE END OF THE YEAR. IF YOU HAVE RELATIVE UNDERPERFORMANCE, WE HAVE SEEN A WRAP-UP. MAYBE COMING TO A DEAL THE NEXT COUPLE OF MONTHS. THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY TO PICK UP INDIA IN THE COMING MONTHS. HASLINDA: BUT NOT YET. IT'S A LITTLE EARLY BECAUSE WHAT WE STILL DON'T HAVE IS A TARIFF DEAL IS SOME WEEKS, MONTHS AHEAD. BUT MORE THE DOMESTIC SLOW DOWN AND THE FACT THE EARNINGS WAS FINE BUT DIDN'T BEAT MEANS THE DOMESTIC EARNINGS IS SLOWING. AS WE GET A D RATING, WHICH WE ARE STARTING TO SEE SOMEWHAT, THAT WILL OPEN UP THE OPPORTUNITY. HASLINDA: IS IT STILL A CONSUMPTION STORY FOR INDIA? IS THAT WHAT YOU BILL BE LOOKING OUT IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS? WHERE YOU WANT TO PLAY INDIA, DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION IS A LONG-TERM STORY WHICH IS VERY POSITIVE. THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO PLAY THAT THROUGH THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. HEALTH CARE I.T. ON THE EXPORT SIDE AS WELL. THERE IS A NUMBER OF SECTORS BUT IT'S BROAD-BASED. THE DOMESTIC STORY IS LONGER-TERM. HASLINDA: INDIAN STOCKS STILL LOOKING EXPENSIVE. CHINESE STOCKS A DIFFERENT STORY, LOOKING VERY CHEAP SOME SAY. PERHAPS SOME QUIET RESURGENCE WE ARE SEEING RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE BEEN OVERWEIGHT CHINA EVEN WHEN IT WAS UNFASHIONABLE THIS YEAR. WE GOT WAY TOO CHEAP AND PEOPLE WERE VERY UNDERWEIGHT FROM A POSITIONING PERSPECTIVE. THIS YEAR DEEPSEEK WAS A WAKE-UP MOMENT. EARNINGS DELIVERY IS OK BUT DOMESTIC SIDE, THE PROPERTY MARKET HASN'T BOTTOMED YET. TIER TWO AND THREE HAVE NOT BOTTOMED. WHEN THAT DOES, YOU GET A BIGGER BOUNCE. FROM A STOCKPICKING PERSPECTIVE, DOMESTIC BRANDS, SELECTED AREAS OF TECH. CLEARLY THEY GOT TOO CHEAP AND YOU ARE SEEING A RE-RATING BEFORE EARNINGS GROWTH PICKS UP. HASLINDA: YOU TALK ABOUT HOW THE PROPERTY SECTOR IS INITIATED. EVERGRANDE IS ABOUT TO BE DELISTED FROM THE HONG KONG EXCHANGE BECAUSE OF THE DEBT LEVEL. THAT SHOWS THAT THE HOUSING WOES ARE STILL NOT DONE. CORRECT, WE ARE STILL STAYING AWAY FROM FIXED ASSET INVESTMENT PROPERTY MARKET. MORE CONSUMPTION, TECH, TELCOS BECAUSE YOU GET DIVIDEND YIELD AND SHARE BUYBACK. THOSE AREAS WE FAVOR AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE LIKED AND THOSE AREAS HAVE DONE WELL. THE PROPERTY SECTOR, WE ARE NOT CONVINCED YET WE HAVE SEEN A BOTTOM. THERE IS MORE STIMULUS COMING, ANOTHER REASON THE MARKET IS OUTPERFORMING. IN CHINA IT'S INCREMENTAL OVER TIME AND UNTIL WE HAVE A TARIFF DEAL AND HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER 90 DAYS, YOU WON'T SEE A HUGE ONE-OFF STIMULUS. HASLINDA: THERE'S IS ALSO THE NATIONAL TEAM STORY. IT'S PUMPED IN A LOT OF MONEY TO PROVIDE THAT BOOST. SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED THIS IS A MARKET THAT'S BEEN PROPELLED BY DOMESTIC PLAYERS DESPITE HOW THE FUNDAMENTALS BOOK? THE KEY THING IS THAT WAS A REASSURANCE IN APRIL. WE SAW DOMESTIC BUYING LIKELY PICK OUT. MEDIUM-TERM WHAT'S INTERESTING IS HONG KONG IPO'S. THERE IS CAPITAL COMING IN FROM PRIVATE INVESTORS FROM MAINLAND CHINA INTO HONG KONG. THE DOMESTIC SUPPORT IS THERE. WE HAVE WENT THROUGH A VERY TOUGH PERIOD. WE ARE SEEING A CHANGE IN MENTALITY. THE HONG KONG CAPITAL MARKETS FRANKLY ARE PRETTY IMPRESSIVE YEAR TO DATE. IPO ACTIVITY IS A GOOD INDICATOR OF INVESTOR RISK APPETITE. HASLINDA: WHAT IS BEING UNDER LOOKED? WHAT SHOULD INVESTORS BE BUYING THEY HAVE NOT YET? CHINA WHEN WE HAVE THAT TURN TO THE PROPERTY MARKET YOU CAN GET MORE BULLISH OUTSIDE SOME SECTORS. THE OTHER THING IS WE HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT EXCESS CAPACITY. THE PROBLEM WITH CHINA IS GREAT COMPANIES BUT WE DON'T SEE THE PICKUP AND PROFIT MARGINS THAT YOU SEE IN THE U.S. IF WE SEE A MORE CONSIDERED MOVE TOWARD REDUCING CAPACITY, THAT'S POSITIVE FOR CHINA EQUITY MARKET PROFITS AND LONGER-TERM PROFITABILITY. THAT'S WHY INDIA AND THE U.S. HAVE A HIGH RETURN ON EQUITY. THAT'S WHY THE STOCK MARKETS RETURN MUCH BETTER. HASLINDA: GREAT HAVING YOU WITH US, ASIA CIO ACT BNP PARIBAS WEALTH MANAGEMENT. BLOOMBERG HAS LEARNED INDIA AND CHINA MAY RESUME DIRECT PASSENGER FLIGHTS AS SOON AS NEXT MONTH IN A MOVE TOWARD RESETTING POLITICAL TIES. IN KEY CITIES IT WAS SUSPENDED AFTER THE COVID PANDEMIC. LET'S BRING IN OUR INDIA AVIATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE REPORTER. INDIA AND CHINA HAVE ANNOUNCED RESUMPTION OF FLIGHTS IN THE PAST TWO. HAS IT MOVED BEYOND MERE ANNOUNCEMENTS THIS TIME? THERE HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCEMENTS IN THE PAST, JUNE OF THIS YEAR. NOTHING TRANSLATED INTO ACTIONS. THIS TIME IT LOOKS A LITTLE MORE SERIOUS THAN THOSE EARLIER ANNOUNCEMENTS. THE AIRLINES HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PREPARE THE INDIAN AVIATION REGULATOR. THEY MIGHT HAVE TO DEPLOY FLIGHTS ON A VERY SHORT NOTICE. THIS WHICH WE HAVE NOT SEEN IN JANUARY AS WELL AS JUNE OF THIS YEAR WHEN THERE WAS A FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT MADE BY THE TOP OFFICIALS OF INDIA AND CHINA. HASLINDA: WHEN MIGHT WE SEE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT? OUR SOURCES TELL US THE ANNOUNCEMENT MIGHT HAPPEN AT THE SUMMIT WHERE PRIME MINISTER MODI IS VISITING AND HE IS ALSO LIKELY TO MEET WITH THE CHINESE PREMIER AT THE SUMMIT BEING HELD IN CHINA. THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE FLIGHT LAUNCH ALONG WITH OTHER ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT MAY HAPPEN AT THE SUMMIT, WE ARE TOLD THERE ARE MEETINGS WITH THE GOVERNMENT IN INDIA. THE EXTERNAL AFFAIRS MINISTRY AS WELL AS OTHER MINISTRIES ARE DISCUSSING IT. THERE WILL BE A FINAL MEETING BEFORE PRIME MINISTER MODI LEAVES FOR THE SUMMIT, WHICH IS WHEN THESE DETAILS WILL BE FINALIZED. THE FINAL ANNOUNCEMENT IS LIKELY. WE EXPECT INDIAN AIRLINES TO START OPERATIONS DURING SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR HOPEFULLY , UNLESS SOMETHING HAPPENS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. SEPTEMBER IS LIKELY. HASLINDA: IS THERE A SENSE OF WHICH INDIAN AIRLINES ARE LIKELY TO LAUNCH FLIGHTS? THERE ARE TWO AIRLINES, TWO PRIMARY AIRLINES IN INDIA. ONE IS AIR INDIA AND THE OTHER IS INDIGO. BOTH HAVE BEEN ASKED TO PREPARE THEMSELVES FOR FLIGHTS TO CHINA. BOTH THESE AIRLINES ARE PREPARING FOR FLIGHTS TO CHINA AND WILL LAUNCH FLIGHTS TO CHINA NOW. AIR INDIA IS A BIGGER AIRLINE WITH MORE WIDE-BODY AIRCRAFT, SO THAT WILL BE THE AIRLINE WHICH WILL HAVE A LARGER SHARE IN THE INDIA-CHINA FLIGHT MARKET. INDIGO, WHICH DOESN'T HAVE SO MANY WIDE-BODY AIRCRAFT, WILL BE A SMALLER REPAIR. WE SEE A LARGE NUMBER OF FLIGHTS COMING FROM INDIA. FROM THE CHINESE CARRIERS, AT LEAST THREE AIRLINES WHICH USED TO OPERATE BEFORE THE FLIGHTS ARE LIKELY TO RESUME, INCLUDING AIR CHINA. ALL OF THEM MAY NOT START FLIGHTS AT THE SAME TIME. EXPECTATIONS ARE THAT IN SEPTEMBER WE MAY SEE SOME FLIGHTS, FLIGHT ANNOUNCEMENTS HAPPENING. HASLINDA: THANK YOU SO MUCH, OUR INDIA AVIATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE REPORTER. TAKING A QUICK LOOK AT ASIAN BENCHMARKS, WE ARE SEEING A RALLY FOR HSTECH IN PARTICULAR LIFTING THE HANG SENG INDEX BY ALMOST 2% RIGHT NOW. ALSO KEEPING AN EYE ON TENCENT EARNINGS. THAT IS IT FOR INSIGHT. HORIZONS MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA IS NEXT. KEEP IT HERE WITH US. THIS IS BLOOMBERG. \u266a",
