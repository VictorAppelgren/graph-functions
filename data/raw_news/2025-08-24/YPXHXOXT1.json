  "description": "It has been roughly six weeks since Novak Djokovic played a competitive singles match.",
  "content": "It has been roughly six weeks since Novak Djokovic played a competitive singles match.\n\nRather than take part in warmup hard-court events ahead of the U.S. Open, the 24-time major champion gave himself a breather, using the break to spend time with family and prepare for the final grand slam of 2025.\n\nHe looked like someone with some rust, struggling at times against unranked American teenager Learner Tien in a 6-1, 7-6 (3), 6-2 victory at Arthur Ashe Stadium on Sunday night.\n\nHe committed four double-faults and 34 unforced errors, miscues that could hurt him against a better opponent.\n\n\u201cI really was surprised how bad I was feeling in the second [set] physically,\u201d said the seventh-seeded Djokovic, who was treated for a blister on his big toe early in the third set. \u201cYeah, we had long exchanges, but also, I kind of dropped my level and made a lot of unforced errors and kind of got him back into the match. I\u2019m glad that I kind of reset myself after [the] second set. And the third one was \u2014 the third set was OK to finish up the match.\n\n\u201cThere are positives but also things that hopefully won\u2019t happen in terms of, like, how I feel on the court physically, the way I felt in the second set. Hopefully, that doesn\u2019t happen because then it makes my life on the court definitely much more challenging.\u201d\n\nNot at his best, Djokovic still did enough to advance without much drama.\n\nIt took him just 24 minutes to wrap up the first set, then Tien and his big groundstrokes gave Djokovic plenty of problems in the second.\n\nDjokovic needed to fight off four break points to stay in the set, eventually finding a way in the tiebreak after initially trailing by a mini-break.\n\nThe third set was like the first, quick and mostly easy, the former world\u2019s No. 1 wearing down his young opponent.\n\n\u201cIt was a strange kind of match. The first set was 20 minutes, and then the second one was one hour and 20, so quite the opposite sets we played,\u201d Djokovic said in his on-court interview after improving to 19-0 in the first round in Flushing. \u201cIt was key for me to hold my nerves in the second set and clinch it in a tie-break. After that, I started feeling better. I can always do better, but it\u2019s a great way to start this year\u2019s campaign.\u201d\n\nPrior to the start of the U.S. Open, Djokovic said his plan moving forward is just to play in the four majors because those tournaments are what motivate him and give him joy at the age of 38.\n\nIt remains to be seen if his time off ahead of this tournament will help him get back on top, and win his first major since claiming his fourth U.S. Open crown in 2023.",

      "text": "Emma Raducanu\u2019s smile is back.\nSo is her game.\nThe young Brit broke her three-year U.S. Open drought, winning her first match in Flushing Meadows since the breakthrough 2021 title that changed her life.\nRadacanu rolled past qualifier Ena Shibahara 6-1, 6-2 at Louis Armstrong Stadium with a 26-minute first set and a brisk one-hour domination.\nShe\u2019s cleared a huge mental hurdle, making New York her happy place for the first time in years.\n\u201cYeah, it has been on my mind,\u201d said Radacanu, 22. \u201cIt\u2019s been four years, and it\u2019s a very special tournament for me. I did feel different coming into it this year. I felt like I was doing the right things day to day, but still, it\u2019s in the back of your head. So I\u2019m just very pleased to have overcome that.\n\u201cIt\u2019s my first win here since 2021, so it\u2019s extra special. First rounds are always difficult and especially at a Slam. I\u2019m just so happy with the way I came through that.\u201d\nRadacanu won the 2021 U.S. Open as an 18-year-old qualifier, dazzling with not just her game but her megawatt smile.\nBut after her title defense ended with a first-round loss to Alize Cornet \u2014 making her just the fourth reigning U.S. Open champ ousted in the opening round \u2014 she missed 2023 due to injury and suffered another first-round exit last year to Sofia Kenin.\nShe acknowledged New York had become a mental hurdle.\n\u201cI really struggled when I came back in 2022. I didn\u2019t enjoy coming back here,\u201d Radacanu said. \u201cNow is the first time that I feel like I can come back to the U.S. Open and really enjoy the memories that I made here. I can be proud of that and see it as a happy place.\u201d\nRadacanu looked happy on the court Sunday, serving well and taking an aggressive return position.\nShe seemed confident, self-assured and in control.\nShe also seemed comfortable with her new coach, Francisco Roig.\nRafa Nadal\u2019s ex-coach, the Spaniard constantly gave loud positive reinforcement.\n\u201cI put a lot of trust in what I\u2019m doing with Francisco on the practice court,\u201d Radacanu said. \u201cWe\u2019re just working really well, doing the right stuff on the practice court, and I just feel like I\u2019m improving. To take confidence from what I\u2019m doing behind the scenes and not just have confidence because I\u2019ve won these matches on the tour.\n\u201cI\u2019m doing a lot day to day. It\u2019s going well, and I\u2019m enjoying it. I\u2019m enjoying getting better, and the process of feeling like, at the end of the day, I\u2019m satisfied I got a little bit better and just repeating it. That\u2019s probably the biggest success and reason why I feel the way I do right now.\u201d\nDespite being nervous beforehand, starting quickly helped Radacanu settle in.\nShe ended up with an encouragingly clean match, just six unforced errors \u2014 one in the second set \u2014 to 36 by her outmatched Japanese foe.\nRaducanu raced out to a quick 5-0 lead and cruised.\n\u201cI started off really well, and that helped relax me a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cEspecially serving first game, that was a confident start, and then I felt like I could keep going.\u201d\nNow, Raducanu has a chance to keep going.\nShe\u2019s provisionally up to world No. 33 in the live rankings after the win and well-placed to crack the top 30.\nWith No. 24 Veronika Kudermetova getting upset by Janice Tjen, Raducanu gets to face another qualifier.\nWith an extra day baked into the first round this year, she\u2019ll get some free time in New York, now a happy place again.\n\u201cMy nana \u2014 it\u2019s not my actual grandma, but I\u2019m like her adopted granddaughter, I\u2019d like to think \u2014 she\u2019s from New York, and she told me to go to the Frick Collection,\u201d Raducanu said. \u201cI\u2019ve been into my art a lot more recently, and it\u2019s reopened after I think four or five years of being under construction. That will be really exciting.\u201d"

There has been NFL domination by the Patriots and Chiefs over much of the past two decades. The Canadiens, Islanders and Oilers had deeds to the Stanley Cup for the better part of 20 years. First, the Celtics, then the Bulls and Lakers were lords of the NBA.\nBut there has never been a sport ruled by hegemony like the men\u2019s side of tennis since the 2003 U.S. Open, when Andy Roddick became the last American man to win a Grand Slam. A pro sport or pro sport league has never been more dynastic.\nFor while there have been 86 majors since Roddick\u2019s triumph, just 13 different champions have emerged, The Big Three of Novak Djokovic (24), Rafael Nadal (22) and Roger Federer (19) combining for 65 of them with Carlos Alcaraz (5) and Jannik Sinner combining for nine tiles and indeed all seven Slams over the past two calendar years."

It just gets more exciting.\u201d\nWhen Williams takes on 11th-ranked Karolina Muchova on Monday night in Arthur Ashe Stadium, it will be her record-extending 25th appearance in the U.S. Open.\nIt comes at the ripe age of 45, making her the oldest player to compete in singles at the U.S. Open since 47-year-old Ren\u00e9e Richards set the record in 1981.\n\u201cI love my job,\u201d Williams said. \u201cSo there\u2019s the joy right there.\u201d\nWhile Williams is one of the all-time greats, with seven Grand Slam singles titles, including in 2000 and 2001 here in Flushing Meadows, this was an unexpected comeback.\nShe got a wild-card entry after being ranked 610th in the world.\nIt comes following a 16-month layoff from tennis that included surgery for uterine fibroids.\nShe had just returned last month at the Washington Open.\n\u201cI want to be my best, and that\u2019s the expectation I have for myself, to get the best out of me. That\u2019s all any player can ask for,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI haven\u2019t played as much as the other players, so it\u2019s a different challenge when you\u2019re dealing with that. So I\u2019m just trying to have fun, stay relaxed and be my personal best.\u201d\nMonday\u2019s appearance comes 28 years after Williams\u2019 1997 debut at the U.S. Open, and she doesn\u2019t plan to stop swinging a racket anytime soon.\n\u201cI think I\u2019ll always play tennis. It\u2019s in my DNA. So it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s now or 30 years from now,\u201d Williams said. \u201cGod willing, I\u2019ll be here. We\u2019ll all be here. We\u2019ll all be hitting balls. But in any case, tennis will always be one of the most important parts of my life.\u201d\nJanice Tjen upset No. 24 Veronika Kudermetova 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 in her opener.\nIt made her the first Indonesian to advance here since 2003.\n\u201cYeah, it means a lot. I feel proud to be able to do this for my country. Hopefully, this \u2014 by me making [an] appearance here \u2014 will help, will inspire more tennis players, younger kids to play tennis, and also believing that they can be here, too,\u201d said Tjen, who came to the sport by chance.\n\u201cI started playing tennis because of my good friend. She\u2019s also on tour. Her name is Priska Madelyn Nugroho. \u2026She [was] like, \u2018Oh, do you want to try playing tennis?\u2019 My parents [were] like, \u2018Yeah, just go play the sport.\u2019 Just having exercise so I\u2019m not going to be in my room just doing nothing.\u201d\nTjen, who played at Pepperdine, won 30 points at the net and earned a second-round date against 2021 champ Emma Raducanu.\nTaylor Fritz beat Emilio Nava 7-5, 6-2, 6-3 and has won 22 of his past 27 matches since the end of the French Open, the most wins of any man on tour over that span.\nHe\u2019ll have two days off before playing Sebastian Baez or Lloyd Harris.\nNo. 6 Ben Shelton ripped Ignacio Buse 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 and faces either Pablo Carreno Busta or Pablo Llamas Ruiz.\nShelton \u2014 an entertainer whose celebrations seemingly vexed Novak Djokovic \u2014 was asked if he\u2019d like to see tennis ease up on the stoic decorum and etiquette, citing the attention the Noah Lyles-Kenny Bednarek beef in track and field has drawn.\n\u201cYeah, I understand respecting your opponents and the traditions of tennis. At the same time, people get called out for little things or the wrong things that it\u2019s, like, really? We\u2019re going to give someone a hard time about that?\u201d Shelton said. \u201cHaving a younger crowd in tennis is really important in attracting younger fans, the future fans of our sport. The kids love the flair and excitement and competition, and Bednarek shoving Lyles and them talking about it in the press conference afterwards, it\u2019s exciting.\n\u201cNow when they go to Tokyo for the World Championships, something\u2019s on the line and everyone\u2019s tuning in.
