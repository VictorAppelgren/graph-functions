      "feedback": "Remove the “Long” line (only 4 lines are allowed). For each of the 4 lines, collapse the driver and watch into a single, explicit causal chain: e.g., “Fed September cut” → “September payroll slowdown” → “S&P 500 up”. Keep the time window tight (e.g., “Sep 2025‑Mar 2026”), use one canonical handle per line (e.g., ust10y, spx), and attach a single probability that is grounded in the cited evidence (e.g., 55 % from FAN5RYW6T). Ensure every line ends with a single probability %, no extra text. Add inline citations only where a specific fact or number is asserted (e.g., (FAN5RYW6T) for the 5‑10 % downside). Verify that each driver has a clear transmission path to the asset (e.g., Fed policy → 10‑year yield → equity risk appetite). Finally, trim any redundant phrases (“strong Q3 tech earnings”) so the line reads: “Up | Sep 2025‑Mar 2026 | Fed September cut + payroll slowdown | September payrolls & Fed minutes | 55 %”. Repeat this structure for the two down cases, using the appropriate handles (e.g., ust10y, spx) and evidence (97MD1FHW8, 7XH2DKEKV). This will satisfy the format, provide causal clarity, and keep the analysis concise and actionable.",
