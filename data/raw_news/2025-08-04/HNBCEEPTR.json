  "title": "Boeing\u2019s second strike in less than a year begins at three defense plants",
  "description": "Boeing is being hit with its second strike in less than a year after 3,200 hourly workers walked off their jobs building military aircraft.",
  "content": "Boeing on Monday was hit with its second strike in less than a year, as 3,200 hourly machinists walked off their aerospace jobs in the St. Louis area.\n\nMembers of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) voted to authorize a strike at three defense plants starting Monday at 12:59 a.m. ET.\n\n\u201c3,200 highly-skilled IAM Union members at Boeing went on strike at midnight because enough is enough,\u201d the union wrote on X after the walkout began.\n\nThe union overwhelmingly rejected a tentative agreement a week ago that would have given many of the members raises of 40% over the four-year life of the contract. The members voted Sunday to reject a revised contract that removed scheduling provisions that had prompted objections from rank-and-file members.\n\n\u201cIAM District 837 members build the aircraft and defense systems that keep our country safe,\u201d IAM Midwest Territory General Vice President Sam Cicinelli said in a statement Sunday. \u201cThey deserve nothing less than a contract that keeps their families secure and recognizes their unmatched expertise.\u201d\n\nThe strike is the latest blow to Boeing, following six years of massive financial losses and setbacks in many areas of its business, including the defense and space unit affected by this strike. The company has rung up core operating losses of $42.2 billion since the second quarter of 2019. That was after the fatal crashes of two commercial 737 Max planes and the subsequent 20-month grounding of the model.\n\nThe company\u2019s problems in its commercial plane unit have, understandably, gotten the most attention. But Boeing Defense, Space and Security unit also logged nearly $11 billion in losses from late 2021 through the end of last year. That was largely due to Pentagon contracts that made the company responsible for cost overruns, including two new Air Force One jets. But so far this year, the unit has been profitable.\n\nThe workers in St. Louis and St. Charles, Missouri, and Mascoutah, Illinois, build such military aircraft as F-15 and F/A-18 fighter jets, the T-7A Red Hawk trainer, and the MQ-25 Stingray unmanned refueler. The F-47 stealth fighter jet, the Pentagon\u2019s next-generation fighter plane, is due to be built at a Boeing plant in the St. Louis area, though the company has not said which plant will build it or when production will start. Boeing also operates some nonunion plants in the area.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re disappointed our employees rejected an offer that featured 40% average wage growth and resolved their primary issue on alternative work schedules,\u201d said a statement from Dan Gillian, Boeing general manager and senior St. Louis site executive. \u201cWe are prepared for a strike and have fully implemented our contingency plan to ensure our non-striking workforce can continue supporting our customers.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Boeing said that a $5,000 signing bonus that was part of its offers to the union would be withdrawn if the members did not ratify a deal before the strike deadline.\n\nThe IAM negotiating committee had recommended that members ratify the deal presented last week.\n\n\u201cWith stronger pensions, real wage growth, and better work-life balance, we\u2019ve delivered a contract that meets the moment,\u201d the committee said at the time.\n\nBut less than 5% of the rank-and-file workers of IAM Local 837, which represents the defense workers, voted for that tentative agreement. The union did not give precise results in Sunday\u2019s votes.\n\nDespite years of serious financial problems, Boeing is still one of the nation\u2019s largest manufacturers, with contractors spread across all 50 states. It also has a huge backlog of contracts, for both commercial and military aircraft, that will keep it in business.\n\nBoeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said in the company\u2019s earnings call last week that he believes the company will be able to weather the costs of the strike, which he suggested would be far less than the cost of last year\u2019s strike of 33,000 commercial plane unit workers.\n\n\u201cThe order of magnitude of this is much, much less than what we saw last fall,\u201d he said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t worry too much about the implications of the strike. We\u2019ll manage our way through that.\u201d",
