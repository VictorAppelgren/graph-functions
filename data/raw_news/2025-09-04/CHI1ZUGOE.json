  "title": "EV sales were plummeting before Trump overturned California mandate",
  "description": "The future of EV\u2019s and other \u201calternative\u201d fuel vehicles is very much in question.",
  "content": "Under the plan imposed by Gov. Lujan Grisham and her handpicked Environmental Improvement Board, 43% of all vehicles sold in New Mexico were supposed to be electric by 2026. Fortunately for New Mexico car buyers, back in May the U.S. Congress (including New Mexico Democrat Rep. Gabe Vasquez) voted to eliminate California\u2019s exemption from federal clean air rules (and thus the ability of other states) to force unwilling buyers to purchase electric vehicles.\n\nA new report from the pro-EV trade group Alliance for Automotive Innovation indicates that as of the first quarter of 2025, adoption of EV\u2019s had begun to decline even before Congress acted. Perhaps the mere election of Donald Trump shifted consumer behavior back toward gas-powered vehicles, but the reason for this decline is unclear.\n\nWhat we do know is that according to the Alliance\u2019s data New Mexico\u2019s EV market share plummeted by 10% from 5.53% in Q4 2024 to 4.98% in Q1 2025. The report found that declines occurred in states whether they mandated EV\u2019s or didn\u2019t.\n\nGiven those low and dropping numbers there is no chance of New Mexico complying with the 43% EV sales target. But, rather than thanking Trump and Congress for averting a self-inflicted crisis, the Gov. instead criticized them for \u201cputting polluters over people and creating chaos for consumers and the market.\u201d New Mexico also joined California\u2019s lawsuit which amounts to a long-shot attempt to get the courts to overturn Congressional action and thus restore that State\u2019s federal waiver.\n\nThe decline in EV sales is likely a result of market saturation among a relatively niche group of people who are interested in buying them. Even as Congress killed off EV mandates numerous federal and state subsidies for EV\u2019s remain in effect. According to the New Mexico Environment Department:\n\nUnder current federal policy, tax credits of up to $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used EVs are available through Sept. 30, 2025.\n\nYou can also get a tax credit of up to $1,000 to help cover the cost of purchasing and installing a residential or commercial EV charging station. This federal tax credit is available through June 30, 2026.\n\nOn top of those federal subsidies, the State of New Mexico offers a tax credit of up to $3,000 for the purchase or lease of a new or used qualifying vehicle and a tax credit of up to $25,000 for the purchase and installation of clean car charging units.\n\nNew Mexico\u2019s subsidies and breaks will remain in effect and are augmented by recently-enacted building codes which require EV charging stations and/or charging infrastructure in all new houses and apartment construction.\n\nAll of these either take money out of the pockets of non-EV drivers or raise the price of housing which is already unaffordable in much of our state. While federal subsidies for EV\u2019s are on track to expire, for the time being New Mexico will continue to pump taxpayer dollars into EV\u2019s, charging stations, and other EV-related infrastructure that primarily benefit wealthy EV owners.\n\nThe future of EV\u2019s and other \u201calternative\u201d fuel vehicles is very much in question. Absent massive subsidies and mandates EV\u2019s appear to be a niche product in the United States. Perhaps new technology (like massive improvements in battery technology) will change that. But with the Trump Administration\u2019s \u201cdrill baby drill\u201d philosophy keeping oil and gas prices low it is unlikely that auto buyers (as opposed to politicians) will flock to EV\u2019s. Perhaps hydrogen or some other technology will prove superior to EV\u2019s?\n\nRegardless of what the future holds for the automotive market New Mexico\u2019s political leadership should reinstate true freedom of vehicle choice by eliminating subsidies and mandates, regardless of the technology. And, as long as the gas tax plays a role in funding road maintenance EV owners should also pay a fee of some kind to maintain the roads. It\u2019s only fair.\n\nPaul Gessing is president of New Mexico\u2019s Rio Grande Foundation.

      "text": "Upending norms, the Senate votes to undo California's EV rules\nUpending norms, the Senate votes to undo California\u2019s EV rules\nThe Senate has overruled the guidance of the parliamentarian, a nonpartisan staffer who interprets the Senate's rules, and voted 51 to 44 to overturn a waiver allowing California to set its own air pollution standards for cars that are stricter than national regulations. The Senate has only overruled its parliamentarian a handful of times in the 90-year history of the role.\nThe Senate also voted to revoke two waivers related to heavy-duty trucks. One allowed California to mandate zero-emission trucks, and the other permitted stricter emissions standards for new diesel trucks.\nCongress is using a law called the Congressional Review Act, or CRA, as a mechanism to revoke the federal waivers that allowed California to set these rules. The House previously approved three resolutions to revoke the waivers.\nBut there are significant questions about whether this use of the CRA is legal; the Government Accountability Office and the Senate parliamentarian, who serve as referees within the federal government, both determined that it is not.\nThe GAO's opinion is merely advisory. The parliamentarian's guidance is also non-binding, but the Senate has traditionally followed it. While disregarding this advice is not unprecedented, it's extremely rare. Historically, leaders of both parties have feared that if they act unilaterally to change the Senate's norms, the other party will do the same when they're in power. That's exactly what happened in 2013 and 2017, when first Democrats and then Republicans deployed the \"nuclear option\" to eliminate the filibuster for judicial nominees.\n\"Today it's all about California emission waivers. But tomorrow, the CRA could now be used to erase any policy from an agency that the Trump administration doesn't like at a simple majority threshold,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday evening as he tried unsuccessfully to derail the vote. He argued that the CRA could subsequently be used to repeal any policies the White House \u2014 including future administrations \u2014 doesn't support, including waivers related to Medicaid or reproductive health care. \"Republicans should tread carefully today,\" he said. \"What goes around comes around.\"\nRepublicans have embraced a legal argument that the CRA can be used in this case. Speaking Wednesday afternoon, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said that Republicans were not changing the Senate's broader rules or norms, and suggested other reasons for Democratic opposition. \"I think a lot of Democrats support an electric vehicle mandate,\" he said. \"In fact I think they're somewhat frantic at the prospect of losing this 'Green New Deal' policy.\"\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta says this use of the CRA is unlawful, and that California will challenge it in court. \"The weaponization of the Congressional Review Act to attack California's waivers is just another part of the continuous, partisan campaign against California's efforts to protect the public and the planet from harmful pollution,\" Bonta wrote in a statement.\nMeanwhile, California Gov. Gavin Newsom framed the vote as a national economic issue, arguing that rolling back the standards risks ceding the global EV market to China, where EVs make up a much higher share of production than in the U.S. \"The United States Senate has a choice: cede American car-industry dominance to China and clog the lungs of our children, or follow decades of precedent and uphold the clean air policies that Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon fought so hard for. Will you side with China or America?\" he wrote in a statement.\nA unique ability\nBecause of its long history of regulating vehicle emissions, California has the unique ability to establish rules that are more ambitious than the federal ones. Each rule requires a waiver from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and other states can choose to follow California's stricter standards if they want.\nCalifornia has used this ability to push the auto industry toward zero-emission vehicles for many years, both to protect human health and to reduce the transportation industry's contributions to climate change.\nIn the first Trump administration, the EPA withdrew a waiver that allowed California to set vehicle standards. A legal battle ensued. Some carmakers sided with the White House and others with Sacramento in the fight over whether that was legal. But the battle became moot after the Biden administration reinstated the waiver.\nSince then, California's mandates have become more aggressive, requiring a rapid acceleration in electric vehicle production, starting with 35% of new sales within the state in model year 2026 and reaching 100% of new sales by 2035.\nCritics have called that goal unrealistic, given that currently EVs make up about a quarter of new car sales in California, and about 10% of sales nationally. Supporters say that the rules are flexible enough to make them more achievable than they seem.\nSupporters also say that the state's standards are more important, the weaker federal rules get \u2014 especially with the Trump administration now poised to roll back federal environmental regulations, including on emissions standards.\nIn April, more than 100 public health and environmental groups sent a letter to Congress saying that blocking the California standards would mean \"more children suffering asthma attacks and missing school, more grandparents dying prematurely, and more death and destruction from extreme weather.\"\nThe use of the CRA to revoke the waiver is new; last time, Congress wasn't involved and the executive branch withdrew the waiver on its own. But just like during the first Trump administration, expect this decision to trigger a legal battle. Bonta, the California attorney general, has vowed to sue.\nIndustry allied against the regulations\nPresident Trump campaigned against \"EV mandates\" and \"gas car bans\" that would require gas cars to be replaced with electric ones. And while federal EV rules are not technically mandates, California's more aggressive rules do directly require companies to stop selling new gas vehicles (unless they can also run on electricity, like plug-in hybrids do).\nThe Trump administration has powerful allies in its fight against these rules. The oil industry has repeatedly sued to challenge California's stricter rules. The agriculture lobby, which favors biofuels over batteries, also opposes the California waiver. A group of more than 100 energy, agriculture and transportation trade groups issued a letter in mid-March urging Congress to disapprove the California waivers, arguing the three California rules would \"harm American economic and national security\" by increasing reliance on battery supply chains that are dominated by China.\nThe American Petroleum Institute has argued that electric vehicle mandates reduce consumer choice and raise the up-front costs of vehicles. In legal filings and public comments, the group also emphasizes it would cost the oil industry enormously.\n\"[An EV] mandate would produce widespread effects on the national economy, such as the reduced need for oil and gas production and gas processing, and changes to petroleum refining and distribution,\" the group wrote in one set of comments in 2024, describing the changes required to meet California's rules as \"extraordinary.\"\nAutomakers have also opposed the rule, although the issue is more complicated for the auto industry than for the oil industry. Carmakers would like some regulatory stability, since they need to plan vehicle production years in advance. In the name of stability, some automakers previously volunteered to keep following some California regulations during the first Trump administration, when they were disputed.\nOn the other hand, many traditional automakers think that California's current rules are unrealistic, particularly for the dozen or so states that have opted in to follow those standards. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, the major automaker trade group, says it would take a \"miracle\" to meet the rules, because demand for EVs is not as strong as California had hoped.\nThe auto industry has been lobbying California, and each of the states following its rules, to slow down, pause or soften their strict EV requirements, with some success. But carmakers have simultaneously been lobbying for the use of the CRA to eliminate the California rule altogether, and knock out all those state requirements at once \u2014 precisely what's happening now.\nGreen groups object, trade groups rejoice\nOn Thursday, environmental and EV groups assailed the votes, and in particular the move to revoke the waiver relating to passenger cars. \"This illegitimate move poses threats to public health, the economy and states' rights,\" the Union of Concerned Scientists wrote in a statement. The Zero Emission Transportation Association, which represents electric automakers, called the waiver repeal \"an extraordinary action that sets a dangerous precedent.\"\nIndustry groups are celebrating. The American Petroleum Institute and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers dubbed the repeal of that waiver \"a massive win for consumers and working families all across the country.\"\n\"The fact is these EV sales mandates were never achievable,\" the automaker trade group the Alliance for Automotive Innovation said in a statement, saying Congress deserves \"enormous credit\" for repealing California's rules."

That window is closing fast.\nThese savings apply at the time of purchase for eligible vehicles and income-qualified buyers, meaning you don't have to wait for tax season to benefit. It's real money back in your pocket, right when you need it.\nNeed a charger too? You can also get a tax credit of up to $1,000 to help cover the cost of purchasing and installing a residential or commercial EV charging station. But that time is limited: this federal tax credit is only available through June 30, 2026.\nIf you are considering an EV and/or charger, visit Plug in America's EV tax credit guide to see which vehicles qualify and whether you're eligible.\nThe savings don't stop there!\nNew Mexico's Energy Conservation and Management Division in the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department offers a tax credit of up to $3,000 for the purchase or lease of a new or used qualifying vehicle and a tax credit of up to $25,000 for the purchase and installation of clean car charging units. This program has helped over 700 New Mexicans save thousands of dollars as they transition to cleaner modes of transportation. Visit the Clean Car and Charging Unit Tax Credit webpage to see if your next purchase qualifies.\nWe're making tremendous progress in building a clean energy economy - and we don't want families in our state to miss out on the federal benefits while they're still available.\nDon't leave these savings on the table.\nLet's keep driving forward - together.\nQuestions?

      "text": "The latest on EV sales/mandates in New Mexico\nThe Rio Grande Foundation has continued in its efforts to both track and overturn MLG\u2019s electric vehicle mandates. These mandates take effect in model year 2026. Those cars will start appearing on dealer lots early this fall. Under the Gov.\u2019s mandate 43% of them will have to be electric.\nAccording to the Center for Automotive Innovation as of the fourth quarter of 2024 (the most recent information available) just 5.35% of all vehicles sold in New Mexico are currently electric. In other words, it is impossible that New Mexicans will willingly ramp up purchases of EV\u2019s by a factor of nearly 10 in the span of less than a year.\nSadly, despite the fact that some Democrats in New Mexico\u2019s Democrat-controlled Legislature oppose the Gov.\u2019s mandate they (again) did nothing to restore their policymaking power by eliminating this absurd EV mandate and prohibiting unelected bodies from imposing similar regulations. What will happen next?\nThe US House is poised to vote to overturn the Biden Administration\u2019s waiver which allows California to set its own EV mandates (and states like New Mexico to follow them). That may be the best option available at this point. MLG could choose to not enforce the mandate when it starts later this year due to the impossibility of achieving it, but it is impossible to say at this point. At this point I wouldn\u2019t want to own or work for a New Mexico car dealership."

  "argos_summary": "EV sales in New Mexico fell from 5.53% to 4.98% in Q1\u202f2025, a decline that coincided with Congress revoking California\u2019s waiver that allowed states to impose stricter EV mandates. New Mexico\u2019s 43% EV target for 2026 appears unattainable, and the state\u2019s government has criticized the federal action as harmful to consumers. Despite the rollback, federal and state subsidies for EV purchases and charging infrastructure remain in place until 2025\u20112026, while the Trump administration\u2019s low\u2011oil\u2011price stance may further dampen EV demand.",
