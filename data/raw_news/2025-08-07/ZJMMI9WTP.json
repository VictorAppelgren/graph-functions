  "title": "Open-Source Leadership: What\u2019s Really At Stake",
  "description": "Open source thrives on the inclusivity of different thoughts, code transparency and the meritocratic evaluation of contributions.",
  "content": "Kevin Dominik Korte: IT Innovation Strategist, Board Member. Expert in identity management, AI and open-source solutions.\n\nThe open-source software movement has long been a symbol of global collaboration, transparency and shared progress. Yet, as China rapidly ascends to a leadership position in open source, especially in AI and critical infrastructure, worries in the West are mounting.\n\nIt\u2019s a pivotal moment. While these broad concerns rightfully resonate with the public, politicians and the enterprise community, it\u2019s important not to be worried for the wrong reasons. We can\u2019t lose sight of what really is at stake here: the very real risks associated with technological dependence, security vulnerabilities and the shifting balance of digital power.\n\nIf the West wishes to maintain its influence over the future of digital infrastructure and uphold the values that made open source so powerful, it must respond to China's challenge not with fear, but with more resounding and strategic involvement in open-source development.\n\nChina's open-source surge is no accident. It\u2019s a calculated response to Western export controls and a strategic move aimed at reducing dependence on foreign technology.\n\nChinese tech giants, such as Alibaba, Baidu and Huawei, have become prolific contributors to open-source projects, and China now produces a significant share of the world's leading open-source AI models. This shift has enabled China to scale innovation rapidly and integrate itself within the global technology ecosystem, in the process becoming a force to be reckoned with.\n\nHowever, the risks extend beyond technological competition heating up and China building a leading position. Analysts have observed that some Chinese open-source large language models (LLMs) and code libraries may contain security exploits or biases that could be used for surveillance, manipulation or even the export of controlled narratives beyond the Chinese state.\n\nOften, these risks are subtle. They hide within the complexity of software and AI models. As such, it\u2019s difficult to detect them post-factum\u2014and even more challenging to eliminate them once end-users and companies have deployed those models.\n\nThere\u2019s more at stake here than mitigating inherent technological risks. The future of open-source development raises fundamental questions about trust, accountability and digital sovereignty.\n\nIf non-transparent or potentially adversarial actors shape the tools that underpin government, finance and public life, the integrity of those systems is at risk. Open source, when led by transparent and accountable communities, offers a path to digital autonomy and resilience.\n\nFor example, CLIMADA is a free, open-source software framework that enables climate risk assessment and appraisal of adaptation options, helping researchers, policymakers and businesses analyze the impacts of natural hazards and explore adaptation strategies. Thus, it enables us to evaluate climate risks transparently, without fear or political interference.\n\nBut if actors with different priorities take the lead, the very openness of the ecosystem can become a key vulnerability. Suddenly, open source will be only driven by the software being free, as in \u201cfree\u201d beer. Not by the desire to promote its freedom from undue influences, be they commercial, political or both.\n\nOpen source thrives on the inclusivity of different thoughts, code transparency and the meritocratic evaluation of contributions. For users, open-source software has democratized access to computers, enhanced privacy and provided us with powerful AI tools.\n\nYet, relative underinvestment in open-source AI and critical infrastructure, driven by fear and by a search for short-term profits, has created an opening for others to set standards, shape ecosystems and define the direction of future technologies. If this trend continues, Western nations risk becoming consumers, rather than creators, of the next generation of digital tools.\n\nLosing the leadership position is not just about prestige and control. Open-source projects often wield a different, more substantial type of influence over technical standards, security protocols and even the ethical frameworks that govern the use of technology.\n\nMoreover, the fragmentation of the open-source community along geopolitical lines, driven by techno-nationalism and export controls, threatens the collaborative spirit that made open-source successful in the first place. If Western companies and governments retreat from global projects out of fear or mistrust, the ecosystem could splinter, reducing innovation and creating regional silos that are less secure and less robust.\n\nTo address these challenges, Western tech companies must not only participate in open-source projects. Funding and leadership for critical projects, such as the Cloud Native Computing Foundation\u2019s Harbor, must represent its global user base.\n\nDiverse leadership enables us to establish high standards for transparency, security and ethical conduct. We must invest in local talent, support foundational projects and create incentives for sustained contributions and maintenance. It also requires governments and industry to collaborate in ensuring that open-source software remains a tool for empowerment rather than control.\n\nTransparency and explainability must become core principles, especially in AI. For this, we need rigorous audits, open governance models and shared codes of conduct that help build trust and accountability across borders. By fostering a diverse and inclusive community, open source projects can attract the talent and ideas needed to keep them vibrant and secure.\n\nAlready, strategic investment in open-source infrastructure ensures that critical systems remain under democratic control and are not subject to the whims of foreign actors or commercial interests. Approaches such as the EU's Sovereign Tech Fund strengthen digital sovereignty and reinforce the social contract that underpins the open-source movement.\n\nWe should not retreat into proprietary silos or walled-off and therefore subpar collaboration. Instead, we must renew engagement, investment and leadership. We must double down on the values that made open source a driver of global progress, transparency, inclusivity and shared innovation.\n\nOnly then can we ensure that the digital future remains open, secure and aligned with democratic principles.\n\nis an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.",

      "text": "We are in the early days of a seismic shift in the global AI industry. DeepSeek, a previously little-known Chinese artificial intelligence company, has produced a \u201cgame changing\u201d\u201c large language model that promises to reshape the AI landscape almost overnight.\nBut DeepSeek\u2019s breakthrough also has wider implications for the technological arms race between the US and China, having apparently caught even the best-known US tech firms off guard. Its launch has been predicted to start a \"slow unwinding of the AI bet\u201d in the west, amid a new era of \u201cAI efficiency wars\u201d.\nIn fact, industry experts have been speculating for years about China\u2019s rapid advancements in AI. While the supposedly free-market US has often prioritised proprietary models, China has built a thriving AI ecosystem by leveraging open-source technology, fostering collaboration between government-backed research institutions and major tech firms.\nThis strategy has enabled China to scale its AI innovation rapidly while the US \u2013 despite all the tub-thumping from Silicon Valley \u2013 remains limited by restrictive corporate structures. Companies such as Google and Meta, despite promoting open-source initiatives, still rely heavily on closed-source strategies that limit broader access and collaboration.\nWhat makes DeepSeek particularly disruptive is its ability to achieve cutting-edge performance while reducing computing costs \u2013 an area where US firms have struggled due to their dependence on training models that demand very expensive processing hardware.\nWhere once Silicon Valley was the epicentre of global digital innovation, its corporate behemoths now appear vulnerable to more innovative, \u201cscrappy\u201d startup competitors \u2013 albeit ones enabled by major state investment in AI infrastructure. By leveraging China\u2019s industrial approach to AI, DeepSeek has crystallised a reality that many in Silicon Valley have long ignored: AI\u2019s centre of power is shifting away from the US and the west.\nIt highlights the failure of US attempts to preserve its technological hegemony through tight export controls on cutting-edge AI chips to China. According to research fellow Dean Ball: \u201cYou can keep [computing resources] away from China, but you can\u2019t export-control the ideas that everyone in the world is hunting for.\u201d\nDeepSeek\u2019s success has forced Silicon Valley and large western tech companies to \u201ctake stock\u201d, realising that their once-unquestioned dominance is suddenly at risk. Even the US president, Donald Trump, has proclaimed that this should be a \u201cwake-up call for our industries that we need to be laser-focused on competing\u201d.\nBut this story is not just about technological prowess \u2013 it could mark an important shift in global power. Former US secretary of state Mike Pompeo has framed DeepSeek\u2019s emergence as a \u201cshot across America\u2019s bow\u201d, urging US policymakers and tech executives to take immediate action.\nDeepSeek\u2019s rapid rise underscores a growing realisation: globally, we are entering a potentially new AI paradigm, one where China\u2019s model of open-source innovation and state-backed development is proving more effective than Silicon Valley\u2019s corporate-driven approach.\nThe Insights section is committed to high-quality longform journalism. Our editors work with academics from many different backgrounds who are tackling a wide range of societal and scientific challenges.\nI\u2019ve spent much of my career analysing the transformative role of AI on the global digital landscape \u2013 examining how AI shapes governance, market structures and public discourse, and exploring its geopolitical and ethical dimensions, now and far in the future.\nI also have personal connections with China, having lived there while teaching at Jiangsu University, then written my PhD thesis on the country\u2019s state-led marketisation programme. Over the years, I have studied China\u2019s evolving tech landscape, observing firsthand how its unique blend of state-driven industrial policy and private-sector innovation has fuelled rapid AI development.\nI believe this moment may come to be seen as a turning point not just for AI, but for the geopolitical order. If China\u2019s AI dominance continues, what could this mean for the future of digital governance, democracy, and the global balance of power?\nChina\u2019s open-source AI takeover\nEven in the early days of China\u2019s digital transformation, analysts predicted the country\u2019s open-source focus could lead to a major AI breakthrough. In 2018, China was integrating open-source collaboration into its broader digitisation strategy, recognising that fostering shared development efforts could accelerate its AI capabilities.\nUnlike the US, where proprietary AI models dominated, China embraced open-source ecosystems to bypass western gatekeeping, scale innovation faster, and embed itself in global AI collaboration. China\u2019s open-source activity surged dramatically in 2020, laying the foundation for the kind of innovation seen today. By actively fostering an open-source culture, China ensured that a broad range of developers had access to AI tools, rather than restricting them to a handful of dominant companies.\nThe trend has continued in recent years, with China even launching its own state-backed open-source operating systems and platforms in 2023, to further reduce its dependence on western technology. This move was widely seen as an effort to cement its AI leadership and create an independent, self-sustaining digital ecosystem.\nWhile China has been steadily positioning itself as a leader in open-source AI, Silicon Valley firms remained focused on closed, proprietary models \u2013 allowing China to catch up fast. While companies like Google and Meta promoted open-source initiatives in name, they still locked key AI capabilities behind paywalls and restrictive licenses.\nIn contrast, China\u2019s government-backed initiatives have treated open-source AI as a national resource, rather than a corporate asset. This has resulted in China becoming one of the world\u2019s largest contributors to open-source AI development, surpassing many western firms in collaborative projects. Chinese tech giants such as Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent are driving open-source AI forward with frameworks like PaddlePaddle, X-Deep Learning (X-DL) and MindSpore \u2014 all now core to China\u2019s machine learning ecosystem.\nBut they\u2019re also making major contributions to global AI projects, from Alibaba\u2019s Dragonfly, which streamlines large-scale data distribution, to Baidu\u2019s Apollo, an open-source platform accelerating autonomous vehicle development. These efforts don\u2019t just strengthen China\u2019s AI industry, they embed it deeper into the global AI landscape.\nRead more: Putting DeepSeek to the test: how its performance compares against other AI tools\nThis shift had been years in the making, as Chinese firms (with state backing) pushed open-source AI forward and made their models publicly available, creating a feedback loop that western companies have also \u2013 quietly \u2013 tapped into. A year ago, for example, US firm Abicus.AI released Smaug-72B, an AI model designed for enterprises that built directly upon Alibaba\u2019s Qwen-72B and outperformed proprietary models like OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3.5 and Mistral\u2019s Medium. But the potential for US companies to further build on Chinese open-source technology may be limited by political as well as corporate barriers.\nIn 2023, US lawmakers highlighted growing concerns that China\u2019s aggressive investment in open-source AI and semiconductor technologies would eventually erode western leadership in AI. Some policymakers called for bans on certain open-source chip technologies, due to fears they could further accelerate China\u2019s AI advancements.\nBut by then, China\u2019s AI horse had already bolted.\nAI with Chinese characteristics\nDeepSeek\u2019s rise should have been obvious to anyone familiar with management theory and the history of technological breakthroughs linked to \u201cdisruptive innovation\u201d. Latecomers to an industry rarely compete by playing the same game as incumbents \u2013 they have to be disruptive.\nChina, facing restrictions on cutting-edge western AI chips and lagging behind in proprietary AI infrastructure, had no choice but to innovate differently. Open-source AI provided the perfect vehicle: a way to scale innovation rapidly, lower costs and tap into global research while bypassing Silicon Valley\u2019s resource-heavy, closed-source model.\nFrom a western and traditional human rights perspective, China\u2019s embrace of open-source AI may appear paradoxical, given the country\u2019s strict information controls. Its AI development strategy prioritises both technological advancement and strict alignment with the Chinese Communist party\u2019s ideological framework, ensuring AI models adhere to \u201ccore socialist values\u201d and state-approved narratives. AI research in China has thrived not only despite these constraints but, in many ways, because of them.\nChina\u2019s success goes beyond traditional authoritarianism; it embodies what Harvard economist David Yang calls \u201cAutocracy 2.0\u201d. Rather than relying solely on fear-based control, it uses economic incentives, bureaucratic efficiency, and technology to manage information and maintain regime stability.\nThe Chinese government has strategically encouraged open-source development while maintaining tight control over AI\u2019s domestic applications, particularly in surveillance and censorship. Indeed, authoritarian regimes may have a significant advantage in developing facial-recognition technology due to their extensive surveillance systems. The vast amounts of data collected through these networks enable private AI companies to create advanced algorithms, which can then be adapted for commercial uses, potentially accelerating economic growth.\nChina\u2019s AI strategy is built on a dual foundation of state-led initiatives and private-sector innovation. The country\u2019s AI roadmap, first outlined in the 2017 new generation artificial intelligence development plan, follows a three-phase timeline: achieving global competitiveness by 2020, making major AI breakthroughs by 2025, and securing world leadership in AI by 2030. In parallel, the government has emphasised data governance, regulatory frameworks and ethical oversight to guide AI development \u201cresponsibly\u201d.\nA defining feature of China\u2019s AI expansion has been the massive infusion of state-backed investment. Over the past decade, government venture capital funds have injected approximately US$912 billion (\u00a3737bn) into early-stage firms, with 23% of that funding directed toward AI-related companies. A significant portion has targeted China\u2019s less-developed regions, following local investment mandates.\nRead more: Three lessons the west can learn from China\u2019s economic approach to AI\nCompared with private venture capital, government-backed firms often lag in software development but demonstrate rapid growth post-investment. Moreover, state funding often serves as a signal for subsequent private-sector investment, reinforcing the country\u2019s AI ecosystem.\nChina\u2019s AI strategy represents a departure from its traditional industrial policies, which historically emphasised self-sufficiency, support for a handful of national champions, and military-driven research. Instead, the government has embraced a more flexible and collaborative approach that encourages open-source software adoption, a diverse network of AI firms, and public-private partnerships to accelerate innovation. This model prioritises research funding, state-backed AI laboratories, and AI integration across key industries including security, healthcare, and infrastructure.\nDespite strong state involvement, China\u2019s AI boom is equally driven by private-sector innovation. The country is home to an estimated 4,500 AI companies, accounting for 15% of the world\u2019s total.\nAs economist Liu Gang told the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s Global Times newspaper: \u201cThe development of AI is fast in China \u2013 for example, for AI-empowered large language models. Aided with government spending, private capital is flowing to the new sector. Increased capital inflow is anticipated to further enhance the sector in 2025.\u201d\nChina\u2019s tech giants including Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent and SenseTime have all benefited from substantial government support while remaining competitive on the global stage. But unlike in the US, China\u2019s AI ecosystem thrives on a complex interplay between state support, corporate investment and academic collaboration.\nRecognising the potential of open-source AI early on, Tsinghua University in Beijing has emerged as a key innovation hub, producing leading AI startups such as Zhipu AI, Baichuan AI, Moonshot AI and MiniMax \u2014 all founded by its faculty and alumni. The Chinese Academy of Sciences has similarly played a crucial role in advancing research in deep learning and natural language processing.\nUnlike the west, where companies like Google and Meta promote open-source models for strategic business gains, China sees them as a means of national technological self-sufficiency. To this end, the National AI Team, composed of 23 leading private enterprises, has developed the National AI Open Innovation Platform, which provides open access to AI datasets, toolkits, libraries and other computing resources.\nDeepSeek is a prime example of China\u2019s AI strategy in action. The company\u2019s rise embodies the government\u2019s push for open-source collaboration while remaining deeply embedded within a state-guided AI ecosystem. Chinese developers have long been major contributors to open-source platforms, ranking as the second-largest group on GitHub by 2021.\nFounded by Chinese entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng in 2023, DeepSeek has positioned itself as an AI leader while benefiting from China\u2019s state-driven AI ecosystem. Liang, who also established the hedge fund High-Flyer, has maintained full ownership of DeepSeek and avoided external venture capital funding.\nThough there is no direct evidence of government financial backing, DeepSeek has reaped the rewards of China\u2019s AI talent pipeline, state-sponsored education programs, and research funding. Liang has engaged with top government officials including China\u2019s premier, Li Qiang, reflecting the company\u2019s strategic importance to the country\u2019s broader AI ambitions.\nIn this way, DeepSeek perfectly encapsulates \u201cAI with Chinese characteristics\u201d \u2013 a fusion of state guidance, private-sector ingenuity, and open-source collaboration, all carefully managed to serve the country\u2019s long-term technological and geopolitical objectives.\nRecognising the strategic value of open-source innovation, the government has actively promoted domestic open-source code platforms like Gitee to foster self-reliance and insulate China\u2019s AI ecosystem from external disruptions. However, this also exposes the limits of China\u2019s open-source ambitions. The government pushes collaboration, but only within a tightly controlled system where state-backed firms and tech giants call the shots.\nReports of censorship on Gitee reveal how Beijing carefully manages innovation, ensuring AI advances stay in line with national priorities. Independent developers can contribute, but the real power remains concentrated in companies that operate within the government\u2019s strategic framework.\nThe conflicted reactions of US big tech\nDeepSeek\u2019s emergence has sparked intense debate across the AI industry, drawing a range of reactions from leading Silicon Valley executives, policymakers and researchers. While some view it as an expected evolution of open-source AI, others see it as a direct challenge to western AI leadership.\nMicrosoft\u2019s CEO, Satya Nadella, emphasised its technical efficiency. \u201cIt\u2019s super-impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient,\u201d Nadella told CNBC. \u201cWe should take the developments out of China very, very seriously\u201d.\nSilicon Valley venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, a prominent advisor to Trump, was similarly effusive. \u201cDeepSeek R1 is one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I\u2019ve ever seen \u2013 and as open source, a profound gift to the world,\u201d he wrote on X.\nFor Yann LeCun, Meta\u2019s chief AI scientist, DeepSeek is less about China\u2019s AI capabilities and more about the broader power of open-source innovation. He argued that the situation should be read not as China\u2019s AI surpassing the US, but rather as open-source models surpassing proprietary ones. \u201cDeepSeek has profited from open research and open source (e.g. PyTorch and Llama from Meta),\u201d he wrote on Threads. \u201cThey came up with new ideas and built them on top of other people\u2019s work. Because their work is published and open source, everyone can profit from it. That is the power of open research and open source.\u201d\nNot all responses were so measured. Alexander Wang, CEO of Scale AI \u2013 a US firm specialising in AI data labelling and model training \u2013 framed DeepSeek as a competitive threat that demands an aggressive response. He wrote on X: \u201cDeepSeek is a wake-up call for America, but it doesn\u2019t change the strategy: USA must out-innovate & race faster, as we have done in the entire history of AI. Tighten export controls on chips so that we can maintain future leads. Every major breakthrough in AI has been American.\u201d\nElon Musk added fuel to speculation about DeepSeek\u2019s hardware access when he responded with a simple \u201cobviously\u201d to Wang\u2019s earlier claims on CNBC that DeepSeek had secretly acquired 50,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs, despite US export restrictions.\nBeyond the tech world, US policymakers have taken a more adversarial stance. House speaker Mike Johnson accused China of leveraging DeepSeek to erode American AI leadership. \u201cThey abuse the system, they steal our intellectual property. They\u2019re now trying to get a leg up on us in AI.\u201d\nFor his part, Trump took a more pragmatic view, seeing DeepSeek\u2019s efficiency as a validation of cost-cutting approaches. \u201cI view that as a positive, as an asset \u2026 You won\u2019t be spending as much, and you\u2019ll get the same result, hopefully.\u201d\nThe rise of DeepSeek may have helped jolt the Trump administration into action, leading to sweeping policy shifts aimed at securing US dominance in AI. In his first week back in the White House, the US president announced a series of aggressive measures, including massive federal investments in AI research, closer partnerships between the government and private tech firms, and the rollback of regulations seen as slowing US innovation.\nThe administration\u2019s framing of AI as a critical national interest reflects a broader urgency sparked by China\u2019s rapid advancements, particularly DeepSeek\u2019s ability to produce cutting-edge models at a fraction of the cost traditionally associated with AI development. But this response is not just about national competitiveness \u2013 it is also deeply entangled with private industry.\nMusk\u2019s growing closeness to Trump, for example, can be viewed as a calculated move to protect his own dominance at home and abroad. By aligning with the administration, Musk ensures that US policy tilts in favour of his AI ventures, securing access to government backing, computing power, and regulatory control over AI exports.\nAt the same time, Musk\u2019s public criticism of Trump\u2019s US$500 billion AI infrastructure plan \u2013 claiming the companies involved lack the necessary funding \u2013 was as much a warning as a dismissal, signalling his intent to shape policy in a way that benefits his empire while keeping potential challengers at bay.\nNot unrelated, Musk and a group of investors have just launched a US$97.4 billion (\u00a378.7bn) bid for OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit arm, a move that escalates his feud with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and seeks to strengthen his grip on the AI industry. Altman has dismissed the bid as a \u201cdesperate power grab\u201d, insisting that OpenAI will not be swayed by Musk\u2019s attempts to reclaim control. The spat reflects how DeepSeek\u2019s emergence has thrown US tech giants into what could be all-out war, fuelling bitter corporate rivalries and reshaping the fight for AI dominance.\nAnd while the US and China escalate their AI competition, other global leaders are pushing for a coordinated response. The Paris AI Action Summit, held on February 10 and 11, has become a focal point for efforts to prevent AI from descending into an uncontrolled power struggle. France\u2019s president, Emmanuel Macron, warned delegates that without international oversight, AI risks becoming \u201cthe wild west\u201d, where unchecked technological development creates instability rather than progress.\nBut at the end of the two-day summit, the UK and US refused to sign an international commitment to \u201censuring AI is open, inclusive, transparent, ethical, safe, secure and trustworthy \u2026 making AI sustainable for people and the planet\u201d. China was among the 61 countries to sign this declaration.\nConcerns have also been raised at the summit about how AI-powered surveillance and control are enabling authoritarian regimes to strengthen repression and reshape the citizen-state relationship. This highlights the fast-growing global industry of digital repression, driven by an emerging \u201cauthoritarian-financial complex\u201d that may exacerbate China\u2019s strategic advancement in AI.\nEqually, DeepSeek\u2019s cost-effective AI solutions have created an opening for European firms to challenge the traditional AI hierarchy. As AI development shifts from being solely about compute power to strategic efficiency and accessibility, European firms now have an opportunity to compete more aggressively against their US and Chinese counterparts.\nWhether this marks a true rebalancing of the AI landscape remains to be seen. But DeepSeek\u2019s emergence has certainly upended traditional assumptions about who will lead the next wave of AI innovation \u2013 and how global powers will respond to it.\nEnd of the \u2018Silicon Valley effect\u2019?\nDeepSeek\u2019s emergence has forced US tech leaders to confront an uncomfortable reality: they underestimated China\u2019s AI capabilities. Confident in their perceived lead, companies like Google, Meta, and OpenAI prioritised incremental improvements over anticipating disruptive competition, leaving them vulnerable to a rapidly evolving global AI landscape.\nIn response, the US tech giants are now scrambling to defend their dominance, pledging over US$400 billion in AI investment. DeepSeek\u2019s rise, fuelled by open-source collaboration, has reignited fierce debates over innovation versus security, while its energy-efficient model has intensified scrutiny on AI\u2019s sustainability.\nYet Silicon Valley continues to cling to what many view as outdated economic theories such as the Jevons paradox to downplay China\u2019s AI surge, insisting that greater efficiency will only fuel demand for computing power and reinforce their dominance. Companies like Meta, OpenAI and Microsoft remain fixated on scaling computational power, betting that expensive hardware will secure their lead. But this assumption blinds them to a shifting reality.\nDeepSeek\u2019s rise as the potential \u201cWalmart of AI\u201d is shaking Silicon Valley\u2019s foundation, proving that high-quality AI models can be built at a fraction of the cost. By prioritising efficiency over brute-force computing power, DeepSeek is challenging the US tech industry\u2019s reliance on expensive hardware like Nvidia\u2019s high-end chips.\nThis shift has already rattled markets, driving down the stock prices of major US firms and forcing a reassessment of AI dominance. Nvidia, whose business depends on supplying high-performance processors, appears particularly vulnerable as DeepSeek\u2019s cost-effective approach threatens to reduce demand for premium chips.\nThe growing divide between the US and China in AI, however, is more than just competition \u2013 it\u2019s a clash of governance models. While US firms remain fixated on protecting market dominance, China is accelerating AI innovation with a model that is proving more adaptable to global competition.\nIf Silicon Valley resists structural change, it risks falling further behind. We may witness the unravelling of the \u201cSilicon Valley effect\u201d, through which tech giants have long manipulated AI regulations to entrench their dominance. For years, Google, Meta,and OpenAI shaped policies that favoured proprietary models and costly infrastructure, ensuring AI development remained under their control.\nDeepSeek is redefining AI with breakthroughs in code intelligence, vision-language models and efficient architectures that challenge Silicon Valley\u2019s dominance. By optimising computation and embracing open-source collaboration, DeepSeek shows the potential of China to deliver cutting-edge models at a fraction of the cost, outperforming proprietary alternatives in programming, reasoning and real-world applications.\nMore than a policy-driven rise, China\u2019s AI surge reflects a fundamentally different innovation model \u2013 fast, collaborative and market-driven \u2013 while Silicon Valley holds on to expensive infrastructure and rigid proprietary control. If US firms refuse to adapt, they risk losing the future of AI to a more agile and cost-efficient competitor.\nA new era of geotechnopolitics\nBut China is not just disrupting Silicon Valley. It is expanding \u201cgeotechnopolitics\u201d, where AI is a battleground for global power. With AI projected to add US$15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, China and the US are racing to control the technology that will define economic, military and political dominance.\nDeepSeek\u2019s advancement has raised national security concerns in the US. Trump\u2019s government is considering stricter export controls on AI-related technologies to prevent them from bolstering China\u2019s military and intelligence capabilities.\nAs AI-driven defence systems, intelligence operations and cyber warfare redefine national security, governments must confront a new reality: AI leadership is not just about technological superiority, but about who controls the intelligence that will shape the next era of global power.\nChina\u2019s AI ambitions extend beyond technology, driving a broader strategy for economic and geopolitical dominance. But with over 50 state-backed companies developing large-scale AI models, its rapid expansion faces growing challenges, including soaring energy demands and US semiconductor restrictions.\nChina\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, remains resolute, stating: \u201cWhoever can grasp the opportunities of new economic development such as big data and artificial intelligence will have the pulse of our times.\u201d He sees AI driving \u201cnew quality productivity\u201d and modernising China\u2019s manufacturing base, calling its \u201chead goose effect\u201d a catalyst for broader innovation.\nTo counter western containment, China has embraced a \u201cguerrilla\u201d economic strategy, bypassing restrictions through alternative trade networks, deepening ties with the global south, and exploiting weaknesses in global supply chains. Instead of direct confrontation, this decentralised approach uses economic coercion to weaken adversaries while securing China\u2019s own industrial base.\nChina is also leveraging open-source AI as an ideological tool, presenting its model as more collaborative and accessible than western alternatives. This narrative strengthens its global influence, aligning with nations seeking alternatives to western digital control. While strict state oversight remains, China\u2019s embrace of open-source AI reinforces its claim to a future where innovation is driven not by corporate interests but through shared collaboration and global cooperation.\nBut while DeepSeek claims to be open access, its secrecy tells a different story. Key details on training data and fine-tuning remain hidden, and its compliance with China\u2019s AI laws has sparked global scrutiny. Italy has banned the platform over data-transfer risks, while Belgium and Ireland launched privacy probes.\nUnder Chinese regulations, DeepSeek\u2019s outputs must align with state-approved narratives, clashing with the EU\u2019s AI Act, which demands transparency and protects political speech. Such \u201ccontrolled openness\u201d raises many red flags, casting doubt on China\u2019s place in markets that value data security and free expression.\nMany western commentators are seizing on reports of Chinese AI censorship to frame other models as freer and more politically open. The revelation that a leading Chinese chatbot actively modifies or censors responses in real time has fuelled a broader narrative that western AI operates without such restrictions, reinforcing the idea that democratic systems produce more transparent and unbiased technology. This framing serves to bolster the argument that free societies will ultimately lead the global AI race.\nBut at its heart, the \u201cAI arms race\u201d is driven by technological dominance. The US, China, and the EU are charting different paths, weighing security risks against the need for global collaboration. How this competition is framed will shape policy: lock AI behind restrictions, or push for open innovation.\nDeepSeek, for all its transformational qualities, continues to exemplify a model of AI where innovation prioritises scale, speed and efficiency over societal impact. This drive to optimise computation and expand capabilities overshadows the need to design AI as a truly public good. In doing so, it eclipses this technology\u2019s genuine potential to transform governance, public services and social institutions in ways that prioritise collective wellbeing, equity and sustainability over corporate and state control.\nA truly global AI framework requires more than political or technological openness. It demands structured cooperation that prioritises shared governance, equitable access, and responsible development. Following a workshop in Shanghai hosted by the Chinese government last September, the UN\u2019s general secretary, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, outlined his vision for AI beyond corporate or state control: \u201cWe must seize this historic opportunity to lay the foundations for inclusive governance of AI \u2013 for the benefit of all humanity. As we build AI capacity, we must also develop shared knowledge and digital public goods.\u201d\nBoth the west and China frame their AI ambitions through competing notions of \u201copenness\u201d \u2013 each aligning with their strategic interests and reinforcing existing power structures.\nWestern tech giants claim AI drives democratisation, yet they often dominate digital infrastructure in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America, exporting models based on \u201ccorporate imperialism\u201d that extract value while disregarding local needs. China, by contrast, positions itself as a technological partner for the rest of the global south; however, its AI remains tightly controlled, reinforcing state ideology.\nChina\u2019s proclaimed view on international AI collaboration emphasises that AI should not be \u201ca game of rich countries\u201d\u201c, as President Xi stated during the 2024 G20 summit. By advocating for inclusive global AI development, China positions itself as a leader in shaping international AI governance, especially via initiatives like the UN AI resolution and its AI capacity-building action plan. These efforts help promote a more balanced technological landscape while allowing China to strengthen its influence in global AI standards and frameworks.\nHowever, beneath all these narratives, both China and the US share a strategy of AI expansion that relies on exploited human labour, from data annotation to moderation, exposing a system driven less by innovation than by economic and political control.\nSeeing AI as a connected race for influence highlights the need for ethical deployment, cross-border cooperation, and a balance between security and progress. And this is where China may face its greatest challenge \u2013 balancing the power of open-source innovation with the constraints of a tightly controlled, authoritarian system that thrives on restriction, rather than openness.\nFor you: more from our Insights series:\nTo hear about new Insights articles, join the hundreds of thousands of people who value The Conversation\u2019s evidence-based news.

      "text": "China\u2019s DeepSeek, the free artificial intelligence chatbot that\u2019s undercutting American counterparts, has prompted worries about whether it\u2019s safe to use.\nWhile cybersecurity researchers say the app does not immediately appear to be uniquely dangerous, it still carries substantial privacy risks both as an app that follows China\u2019s laws and as an artificial intelligence product that may collect and rearrange everything people tell it.\nAll large language models, or LLMs \u2014 the type of AI-driven advanced chatbot made famous by OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT \u2014 are built by first amassing massive amounts of data, and work in part by collecting what people type into them. DeepSeek, though more efficient than ChatGPT, is no different.\nUnder Chinese law, all companies must cooperate with and assist with Chinese intelligence efforts, potentially exposing data held by Chinese companies to Chinese government surveillance. That system differs from the U.S., where, in most cases, American agencies usually need a court order or warrant to access information held by American tech companies.\nBut it\u2019s possible to use DeepSeek and minimize how much data you send to China. Using the app or the chatbot through deepseek.com requires users to register an account, either with an email address or through a Chinese phone number, which most people outside China don\u2019t have.\nLukasz Olejnik, an independent consultant and a researcher at King\u2019s College London Institute for AI, told NBC News that means people should be wary of sharing any sensitive or personal data with DeepSeek.\n\u201cBe careful about inputting sensitive personal data, financial details, trade secrets, or information about healthcare. Anything you type could be stored, analyzed, or requested by authorities under China\u2019s data laws,\u201d Olejnik said.\nRon Deibert, the director of the University of Toronto\u2019s Citizen Lab, said that means DeepSeek users should be particularly cautious if they have reason to fear Chinese authorities.\n\u201cUsers who are high-risk in relation to mainland China, including human rights activists, members of targeted diaspora populations, and journalists should be particularly sensitive to these risks and avoid inputting anything into the system,\u201d Deibert said.\nOne way to reduce what you send to China is to register DeepSeek with a new email account, not one you already use for other important services. That could keep the app, or potentially Chinese intelligence services, from being able to easily match what you tell DeepSeek with who you are on other parts of the internet.\nFor the more technologically savvy, it\u2019s possible to download the DeepSeek AI model and ask it questions directly, without having to go through the Chinese company processing those requests. That not only prevents China from seeing whatever information you give the model, but it also means little or no censorship about topics that are blocked in Beijing, Olejnik said.\nDeepSeek has also prompted worries because its privacy policy declares that it collects a large amount of sensitive information from users, including what kind of device they\u2019re using and \u201ckeystroke pattern or rhythms.\u201d While some people may find that invasive, it is limited to what a person types into the app and not what they type into other apps, and it is not unheard of: TikTok and Facebook, for example, have had ways of tracking users\u2019 keystrokes and mouse movements.\nDeibert cautioned that while there are risks to giving information to a Chinese LLM, American ones carry risks as well.\n\u201cThe same risks apply to all AI platforms, including those based in the United States,\u201d Deibert said.\nDeibert noted that many U.S. tech companies collect similar sensitive information, and that recently, they\u2019ve worked to court President Donald Trump. \u201cAnyone who is remotely critical of the administration, is a watchdog of the administration, or is part of a vulnerable or at-risk community, should exercise serious caution before using or inputting any data into what are largely \u2018black boxes.\u2019 Remember, as with virtually all social media platforms, users\u2019 data is part of the raw material used to train those systems,\u201d he said."

      "text": "In today\u2019s digital age, the conversation about open source software touches on innovation, security, and economic policy. One particularly intriguing analysis comes from the article \"Donald Trump and the Open Source Paradigm: An Analytical Overview\". This piece dissects the potential viewpoints of former President Donald Trump regarding open source practices by exploring how his administration's policies could have intersected with a movement known for its emphasis on collaboration, transparency, and cost efficiency.\nIntroduction\nOpen source software has transformed the way technology is developed and shared across industries. By allowing anyone to inspect, modify, and enhance software, the open source movement has paved the way for rapid innovation and global cooperation. However, political and economic policies can have a significant impact on this dynamic ecosystem. Although Donald Trump rarely mentioned open source directly during his presidency, his broader focus on economic nationalism and cybersecurity prompts a compelling discussion about how his administration might have aligned\u2014or conflicted\u2014with open source ideals. In this blog post, we dive into the critical elements of this dialogue, drawing insights from the original analysis while also exploring themes like funding strategies, regulatory frameworks, and cybersecurity concerns.\nExploring the Convergence of Political Policy and Open Source\nOne of the central themes of the article is the comparison between Trump\u2019s policies and the collaborative nature of open source. Open source software is celebrated for its potential to catalyze innovation while keeping costs low. As detailed in resources like Open-Source Software on Wikipedia, it not only powers commercial enterprises but also serves as a backbone for governmental and non-profit technology infrastructures. Trump\u2019s emphasis on economic nationalism\u2014which focuses on promoting domestic industries and reducing foreign reliance\u2014might suggest that he would view the cost-saving and domestic innovation potentials of open source as valuable assets to the U.S. economy.\nHowever, there exists an inherent tension between the global transparency of open source and the need to protect national intellectual property. The freedom to share and modify code spans borders, which could, in a different political context, undermine efforts to prioritize American contributions for local economic advantage. On the other hand, supporters of open source might argue that the communal scrutiny provided by open code bolsters security measures\u2014a factor that resonates with Trump's administration's cybersecurity priorities. For those curious about the nuances of securing open code, the discussion on Risk Management Strategies is illuminating.\nEconomic Models, Funding, and Collaborations\nThe article also brings attention to the economic frameworks that support open source projects. Trump\u2019s vision of reshaping the economy through deregulation and fostering public-private partnerships could, in theory, dovetail with initiatives like sustainable funding for open source and innovative project economic models detailed in open source project economic models. Such models not only reduce operational costs for companies but also stimulate local technological advancements, aligning well with nationalistic policies seeking to emphasize domestic competence.\nMoreover, the collaborative spirit behind open source is underpinned by sponsorships and monetization strategies. By promoting public-private partnerships, policies that encourage open source project sponsorships may enable technology companies to leverage community-driven solutions while still safeguarding intellectual property. For businesses, the detailed strategies found in open source monetization challenges and strategies provide valuable insights into how these projects can be both innovative and profitable.\nSummary\nThe analytical overview of \"Donald Trump and the Open Source Paradigm\" presents a balanced contemplation of how political ideologies and technological best practices can sometimes align and, at other times, diverge. On one side, open source supports the principles of deregulation and the democratization of technology, appealing to the drive for economic resilience and innovation. On the other, the international openness of these technologies could potentially clash with an administration focused heavily on intellectual property protection and cybersecurity controls.\nKey points include:\n- How domestic economic policies might benefit from the cost efficiencies of open source.\n- The risk-reward balance inherent in public access to valuable code, with security implications that require careful management.\n- The potential for public-private partnerships to cultivate an environment where open source thrives while addressing national economic and security goals.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, while Donald Trump\u2019s presidency did not overtly spotlight the open source debate, the implications of his broader policies offer a rich area for discussion. The intersection of political ideology and open source initiatives ignites debates about maintaining innovation, ensuring security, and protecting national economic interests. For enthusiasts looking to delve deeper into this multifaceted topic, exploring resources like Linux Foundation and Open Source Initiative can provide further clarity and context.\nThe analysis reminds us that in an increasingly interconnected world, understanding the balance between openness and protection is crucial\u2014not just in the realm of software, but in the broader policy frameworks that shape our future.\nTop comments (0)"

      "text": "Open-source software braces for trade war\nHONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - The open-source software movement has been an unprecedented driver of global innovation and productivity growth. By sharing code that runs databases, smartphones and designs semiconductors for free \u2013 and letting anyone contribute to upgrading it and patching its bugs \u2013 OSS, as it is known, has spared companies from the need to reinvent countless wheels, accelerating the growth of the $475 billion global software industry. Yet rising geopolitical tensions are putting the movement\u2019s future economic contribution at risk.\nAs with other parts of the supply chain, Chinese and American code bases are quietly but deeply intertwined. China is the second-largest contributor to GitHub, a shared repository which Microsoft bought in 2018 for $7.5 billion. Nearly all Chinese smartphone manufacturers use versions of Android, an OSS operating system which generated $22 billion in profit for Google from its launch in 2007 through early 2016, according to an estimate revealed by a lawyer for Oracle that year. Google's owner Alphabet does not break out Android revenues generated by advertising and app downloads from its store.\nOriginally more takers than sharers, mainland tech giants like Alibaba and Tencent now contribute generously to OSS projects overseas; China Inc has also shared frameworks for AI development, including search engine Baidu\u2019s PaddlePaddle and image recognition specialist Megvii\u2019s MegEngine.\nThere are two big issues. First is security. As Western democracies use open-source code to accelerate strategic industries like artificial intelligence and semiconductor chip design, they also gift it to Beijing at a moment when Western AI is being deployed on the frigid battlefields of Ukraine, and the People\u2019s Republic may be mulling military aid to Russia.\nThe second problem is moral. Chinese developers participating in international OSS machine-learning projects often contribute \u201cmodel weights\u201d: mathematical formulations that neural networks learn from training on China\u2019s massive and opaquely sourced domestic data reservoir. The most impressive AI models require billions of examples from which to learn model weights and require large upfront investments, so companies generally welcome Chinese contributions. But software industry insiders told Breakingviews they are worried that these weights could be derived from data collected from sources like government surveillance cameras, some of which are allegedly trained to watch for ethnic minorities by companies like Megvii.\nThe United States fired a warning shot at telecoms giant Huawei in 2019. As with most Chinese handset makers, founder Ren Zhengfei relied on Android\u2019s open-source code to run his company\u2019s smartphones. But President Donald Trump\u2019s administration put the company on a blacklist that effectively prevented it from using the Google services that complemented Android, in particular its app store.\nThe move crippled Huawei\u2019s overseas smartphone businesses and telegraphed to China\u2019s tech sector that the American government was willing and able to weaponise OSS. The same year, GitHub began blocking developers in Iran, Syria and Crimea. Today OpenAI, the somewhat misleadingly named Microsoft-backed company behind the popular ChatGPT bot, won\u2019t allow residents of China and Russia to create accounts to use the tool. Beijing has reciprocated, per a Nikkei report, by instructing its own tech companies not to incorporate ChatGPT into their platforms - a rare example of a mutual firewall.\nHuawei has since built its own OSS operating system called Harmony, and GitHub now faces a Chinese rival startup called Gitee, which enjoys backing from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. On nearly every front, China is moving to duplicate OSS functions, including chatbots and building communities it can control. Chinese developers are already complaining about censorship on Gitee.\n\u201cThe United States government is much more comfortable going after companies than software because [the latter] is a lot harder conceptually for U.S. agencies,\u201d notes China risk consultant Isaac Stone Fish. Blocking Chinese access to OSS libraries would be legally complex, given the code has been donated to the global commons. It would be technologically tricky too given the pervasiveness of virtual private networks that conceal where a user is visiting from. Also, nothing stops a Chinese intelligence officer from downloading OSS resources while abroad. And yet given fraying relations, it seems inevitable that Western democracies will start making it harder for China to take free code; they might also simply produce less of it. Washington has already selectively blocked access to U.S. government websites in China.\nSevering the intellectual link between the world\u2019s two largest open-source communities, the United States and China, would be indirect but profound. One study in 2018 estimated that OSS adoption generated up to \u20ac95 billion of \u201cpositive impact\u201d in the European Union and predicted that a 10% uptake in code contributions from the global tech community could generate an additional 0.6% of regional GDP.\nDividing the world into competing open-source camps would mark another reverse for free trade. It would also be a sad endorsement of the old adage that nothing is truly free.\nFollow @petesweeneypro on Twitter\nCONTEXT NEWS\nRegulators have told major Chinese tech companies not to offer ChatGPT services, the Nikkei news service reported on Feb. 22 citing sources with direct knowledge, causing shares in Chinese companies building chatbots to fall.

      "text": "Introduction\nThis case study was compiled based on desk research \u2013 including the Sovereign Tech Fund webpage, related news items and articles \u2013 as well as an interview conducted by the OSOR team with Mirko Swillus, Head of the Sovereign Tech Fund.\nThe European Union is increasingly embracing open source software as a strategic asset, linking it to innovation, collaboration, and digital sovereignty. Notably, the European Commission\u2019s Open Source Software Strategy 2020-2023 champions a \u201cThink Open\u201d approach within EU institutions and calls for \u201ctargeted public funding\u201d[1] to sustain critical open source projects.\nThe commitment to open principles is mirrored in Germany\u2019s national strategy. The German federal coalition agreement of 2021 explicitly prioritised strengthening open source to advance digital sovereignty, endorsing the principle of \u201cpublic money, public code.\u201d Moreover, amendments to the Online Access Act introduced the requirement for public administrations to give preference to open source and open standards in IT procurement - a measure aimed at fostering transparency, interoperability, and reuse.\nIn this evolving landscape, the Sovereign Tech Fund represents a leading initiative. Launched in 2022, it translates high-level policy into targeted public investment, funding critical open source software infrastructure that underpins digital services in both the public and private sectors.\nThe Sovereign Tech Fund\nThe Sovereign Tech Fund (hereafter also referred to as \u201cthe Fund\u201d) is a public investment initiative launched by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (Bundesministerium f\u00fcr Wirtschaft und Klimaschutz, BMWK) and implemented by the Sovereign Tech Agency, a public entity established as a subsidiary of the German Federal Agency for Disruptive Innovation (Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Sprunginnovationen, SPRIND).\nIts main goal is to strengthen digital sovereignty by supporting the maintenance of open digital base technologies - foundational open source components such as libraries, protocols, and development tools - that, despite their widespread use across sectors, often receive little investment. By providing targeted support to enhance the security, maintenance, and resilience of such projects, the Fund helps ensure their continued availability and reliability for all users.\nSince its establishment in 2022, the Sovereign Tech Fund has provided over \u20ac24.6 million in funding to support more than 60 open source projects globally. Operating under German public procurement law, the Fund demonstrates an innovative model for public sector investment in open source.\nFunding mechanism, eligibility and oversight\nThe Fund provides financial support to recipients through stipulated contracts, with funding disbursed in stages according to the completion of agreed project milestones. The minimum amount per project is \u20ac50,000, with no fixed upper limit; in practice, investments have ranged up to \u20ac1 million.\nTo be eligible for funding, projects must focus on open digital base technologies such as software libraries, protocols, development tools, and related infrastructure. Code must be released under licences approved by the Open Source Initiative or Free Software Foundation, and documentation under Creative Commons-style licences (excluding \u201cnon-commercial\u201d or \u201cno-derivatives\u201d clauses). Projects already receiving public funding for the same activities are ineligible. The Fund is open to applicants from all over the world, and submissions must be completed in German or English via the official application portal.\nProposals are evaluated against six criteria:\n-\nPrevalence (use for/within other technologies),\n-\nRelevance (significance across sectors such as industry, healthcare, and education),\n-\nVulnerability (level of underfunding),\n-\nPublic interest,\n-\nProposed activities,\n-\nExpertise of contributors.\nThe selection process involves an initial screening, a scoping phase to refine deliverables and budget, and an external expert review before final decisions are made. Each funded project is assigned a programme manager who conducts onboarding, monitors progress, and reviews deliverables. Project progress reporting is designed to be lightweight, with flexible formats accepted for updates, including links to repositories. At the conclusion of the contract, recipients must submit a final report detailing completed work, challenges encountered and planned next steps. Project outcomes are primarily evaluated on the strategic impact of the work, with emphasis on security and maintainability.\nKey innovations behind the Fund\nThe Sovereign Tech Fund introduces two notable innovations to the way public institutions support open source software. First, it shifts the focus of public funding away from innovation and prototypes toward the long-term maintenance of open digital infrastructure. The technologies supported by the Fund operate below the application layer and are thus difficult to monetise through conventional means. By targeting the underfunded infrastructure layer, the Sovereign Tech Fund therefore addresses a critical gap in the sustainability of open source ecosystems.\nSecond, the Fund operates under German public procurement law. This model is unprecedented in the open source field and demonstrates how public sector instruments can steward digital commons. Importantly, despite being backed by funding coming from German taxpayers, the Sovereign Tech Fund has a global mandate, supporting cross-border collaboration in the open source ecosystem.\nThe development and promotion of the Sovereign Tech Fund\nThe Sovereign Tech Fund was conceived in response to growing concerns over the fragility of critical open digital infrastructure. In their 2021 coalition agreement, Germany\u2019s governing parties pledged to financially back open source. This commitment gained urgency after events like the Log4j security flaw, which highlighted how a bug in a volunteer-maintained software library could destabilise governments and companies worldwide. Open source advocates argued that the government should treat this \u201cinvisible\u201d software infrastructure as a public good \u2013 as essential as roads or bridges \u2013 and invest in its upkeep. This led the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) to commission a feasibility study, which confirmed significant deficits and potential in supporting open digital base technologies and recommended the creation of a dedicated fund.\nKey milestones\n-\nMid-2022 \u2013 In the final 2022 budget negotiations, the German Parliament (Bundestag) allotted seed funding for \u20ac3.5 million per year to the Sovereign Tech Fund. Following funding approval, the entity was set up within the SPRIND as a pilot initiative.\n-\nOctober 2022 \u2013 The BMWK officially announced the launch of the Fund\u2019s first funding round.\n-\nMid-2023 \u2013 The federal budget for the Fund increased to \u20ac11.5 million.\n-\nLate 2023 \u2013 By late 2023, over 40 critical open digital base technologies had received the Sovereign Tech Fund\u2019s support. After a successful first year, the German government decided to institutionalise the Fund for the long term, establishing it as an independent entity under SPRIND.\n-\n2024 \u2013 The Sovereign Tech Agency was formally set up as the administrative entity of the Fund, allowing it to gain more independence. With an increase in budget allocation to \u20ac17 million, by late 2024, the Sovereign Tech Fund had invested approximately \u20ac23.5 million in over 60 open source projects.\nFigure 1: Examples of current projects supported by the Sovereign Tech Fund. Source: Author\u2019s elaboration based on https://www.sovereign.tech/tech.\nGovernance model and financing\nThe Sovereign Tech Agency, a subsidiary of SPRIND, administers the Fund. The Agency is governed by a Supervisory Board that provides oversight and strategic guidance to ensure operations align with its public mandate. Day-to-day operations \u2013 such as selecting the projects to fund \u2013 are handled by the Fund\u2019s executive team, with the support of a network of external experts from the industry and the open source community. The Fund\u2019s team also relies on Sovereign Tech Agency staff for activities related to project management and administration, legal counsel, and communications.\nIn terms of financing, the Sovereign Tech Fund is entirely publicly funded. Every fiscal year, the Bundestag must approve budget allocations under the dedicated standing item of the BMWK/SPRIND federal budget. This budget has grown significantly over the years, from \u20ac3.5 million in 2022 to a projected \u20ac17 million in 2025. A dedicated two-year contract with the BMWK secures the Fund\u2019s continuity beyond annual budget cycles and affirms its strategic importance. Internally, the Sovereign Tech Fund invests in metrics and research to demonstrate its impact. By documenting positive outcomes \u2013 such as improved security in widely used software or reduced vendor dependencies \u2013 the Fund aims to secure sustained or increased funding in future years.\nThe Sovereign Tech Fund in 2025\nAs of 2025, the Sovereign Tech Fund is entering a phase of strategic development. A key near-term milestone is the confirmation of its annual budget, currently under negotiation within the new German government coalition. Internally, the Fund aims to expand and reorganise its team within the Sovereign Tech Agency to better manage its growing portfolio. On the external side, the Fund is seeking to strengthen its outreach strategies, with the goal of proactively identifying gaps in the open source infrastructure ecosystem and projects that may not reach through the standard application process. Complementing this scaling effort, an ongoing evaluation of both the Sovereign Tech Fund and the Sovereign Tech Agency is underway to enable continuous learning and improvement.\nIn parallel with its core activities, the Fund is exploring future collaboration with the German industry to diversify its sources of funding, and with ZenDiS - the German Centre for Digital Sovereignty - to better target open digital infrastructures that answer public sector needs.\nFinally, at the EU level, a strategic priority for the Fund is to position itself as a reference model for open source funding. Cross-border knowledge exchange is expected to intensify in 2025, as the European Union increasingly seeks to reduce reliance on non-European technology providers. There is also growing interest in the Fund\u2019s approach among other Member State governments and EU institutions.\nBenefits and challenges\nThe Sovereign Tech Fund brings about important benefits to the German public administrations. By enabling the public sector to engage directly within the open source ecosystem, it strengthens the role of public administration as an active stakeholder rather than a passive user of open source. Moreover, it helps public institutions better understand the technologies they rely on and enables them to shape their development in ways that align with public needs.\nAt the same time, the Fund faces several challenges. Although it operates under a two-year agreement with the BMWK, its financing still depends on annual budget negotiations in the German Parliament. This creates a degree of financial uncertainty and limits the Fund\u2019s ability to make longer-term commitments. This is compounded by the volatility of policy focus: as attention shifts toward emerging topics like artificial intelligence (AI), there is a risk that open source digital base components - including the libraries and tools AI systems rely on - may be overlooked. Finally, public procurement law also presents practical challenges. Current frameworks tend to prioritise price as the main award criterion, which does not fully capture the broader value of open source, such as improved transparency, reusability, and the potential to reduce vendor lock-in.\nAddressing these issues will be key to ensuring the Sovereign Tech Fund\u2019s continued ability to support open source as a strategic asset for the public sector and beyond.\nHighlights\nThe successful establishment and operation of the Fund have been supported by a set of well-defined good practices. A key factor has been its iterative working approach \u2014 starting with small-scale pilots, working in cycles, and incorporating regular feedback \u2014 which has enabled the Fund to remain agile. Equally important is its ongoing engagement with the open source community. By actively reaching out to maintainers and contributors, the Sovereign Tech Fund has gained a deeper understanding of the real challenges faced by the ecosystem and to discard assumptions that do not reflect its diverse realities. A clear understanding of the complexity, decentralisation, and cultural diversity within the open source community has been critical to shaping appropriate funding strategies.\nPolicy context\nFor information regarding the policy context of the use of open source software in the public sector in Germany, please consult the respective Country Intelligence Report on open source software policies and its corresponding factsheet in the OSOR Knowledge Centre.

      "text": "Your cart is currently empty!\nHow Open Source Software Is Redefining Global Collaboration\nIn a world often divided by borders and competing interests, open source software has quietly built an alternative model of international cooperation. Unlike traditional diplomacy, this collaboration happens through shared GitHub repositories, multilingual documentation, and code reviews crossing time zones. Let\u2019s explore why this model works and how open source has become the 21st century\u2019s most scalable tool for bridging cultures and aligning priorities.\n1. Why Open Source Unlocks Unlikely Partnerships\nThe mechanics of open collaboration inherently resolve barriers that stymie traditional international projects:\n- Meritocracy Over Geography\nA self-taught programmer in Indonesia can debug code written by a Stanford PhD\u2014contributions are judged purely on technical merit. This flattens hierarchies and surfaces talent ignored by traditional systems. - Asynchronous Advantage\nTime zones become an asset, not a hurdle. Code written in Berlin is reviewed in Tokyo, optimized in S\u00e3o Paulo, and deployed globally\u2014all within 24 hours. This \u201cfollow-the-sun\u201d development accelerates innovation cycles. - Transparency as Trust-Building\nPublic code reviews and open roadmaps create accountability. When the EU audited OpenSSL after the Heartbleed bug was discovered, developers worldwide could verify fixes, rebuilding confidence in critical infrastructure.\n2. The example of Moodle: A Blueprint for Global EdTech Collaboration\nMoodle, the world\u2019s largest open-source learning platform, exemplifies how decentralized collaboration creates solutions greater than the sum of their parts:\n- Cultural Adaptation Through Language Packs\nVolunteer translators don\u2019t just convert words\u2014they reimagine educational experiences. For instance, the M\u0101ori language pack integrates indigenous pedagogical practices, while Arabic translations adapt to right-to-left interfaces and regional curriculum standards. This cultural sensitivity fosters trust and adoption worldwide. - 24/7 Innovation Cycles\nWhen a Brazilian educator shares a plugin at MoodleMoot Japan, it sparks cross-continental dialogues. A gradebook tool designed for Australian vocational training might evolve into a corporate learning module in Seoul, refined by developers in Nairobi working across time zones. - Infrastructure-Inclusive Design\nCollaborations between developers in high-bandwidth Europe and low-connectivity regions like rural Africa have produced offline features now benefiting all users\u2014a reminder that diverse challenges breed universal solutions.\n3. The example of Europe: Open Source as a Diplomatic Tool\nEurope\u2019s fragmented political landscape faces a stark reality: it\u2019s difficult to compete with US tech giants by playing the same game they are. Open source offers a counter strategy:\n- The Berlin Declaration (2020)\n27 EU countries committed to using open source for public sector interoperability, recognizing it as critical for digital sovereignty. Shared standards prevent vendor lock-in and create a \u201ccommon language\u201d for cross-border services. - Germany\u2019s Sovereign Tech Fund\nWith \u20ac22 million in 2023, this initiative funds foundational projects like OpenSSH and PHP, ensuring Europe controls its digital infrastructure. Similar efforts, like the EU\u2019s Open Source Programme Office, aim to pool resources across nations. - From Competition to Co-Creation\nInstead of 27 separate e-government systems, open source allows shared platforms. For example, France\u2019s OpenFisca tax simulation engine is now reused in Belgium and Tunisia, reducing duplication and fostering policy alignment.\n4. The Road Ahead: Scaling Collaborative Sovereignty\nTo maximize open source\u2019s diplomatic potential, governments and organizations must:\n- Strategic Investment\nMove beyond simply creating open source software as a once-off project (e.g. Erasmus-style projects) to pooled EU-wide investments for ongoing support of projects in priority areas like Education, AI and cybersecurity. - Adopt Shared Governance Models\nThe Open Source Good Governance Initiative\u2019s framework helps balance national interests with collective goals, ensuring compliance without stifling innovation. - Build Hybrid Public-Private Ecosystems\nMoodle\u2019s Partner network\u2014spanning 100+ countries\u2014shows how commercial entities can scale open solutions while preserving community values.\nOpen source isn\u2019t just about software\u2014it\u2019s a social contract for strengthening data privacy and digital sovereignty. By prioritizing shared ownership over zero-sum competition, it creates a framework for reducing dependency on a single company. Successful projects such as Moodle show that open source software can be equal or better than proprietary alternatives. The model works, and we recommend that the EU redoubles their digital sovereignty efforts by supporting and building on open source.\nAs the EU\u2019s digital chief recently noted: \u201cIn open source, we don\u2019t ask where you\u2019re from; we ask what you can contribute.\u201d In an era of fragmentation, that ethos might be our best hope for a collaborative future.\n(Note: \u2728 AI tools were used to assist in the drafting of this article)"

      "text": "New mobile apps from the Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) company DeepSeek have remained among the top three \u201cfree\u201d downloads for Apple and Google devices since their debut on Jan. 25, 2025. But experts caution that many of DeepSeek\u2019s design choices \u2014 such as using hard-coded encryption keys, and sending unencrypted user and device data to Chinese companies \u2014 introduce a number of glaring security and privacy risks.\nPublic interest in the DeepSeek AI chat apps swelled following widespread media reports that the upstart Chinese AI firm had managed to match the abilities of cutting-edge chatbots while using a fraction of the specialized computer chips that leading AI companies rely on. As of this writing, DeepSeek is the third most-downloaded \u201cfree\u201d app on the Apple store, and #1 on Google Play.\nDeepSeek\u2019s rapid rise caught the attention of the mobile security firm NowSecure, a Chicago-based company that helps clients screen mobile apps for security and privacy threats. In a teardown of the DeepSeek app published today, NowSecure urged organizations to remove the DeepSeek iOS mobile app from their environments, citing security concerns.\nNowSecure founder Andrew Hoog said they haven\u2019t yet concluded an in-depth analysis of the DeepSeek app for Android devices, but that there is little reason to believe its basic design would be functionally much different.\nHoog told KrebsOnSecurity there were a number of qualities about the DeepSeek iOS app that suggest the presence of deep-seated security and privacy risks. For starters, he said, the app collects an awful lot of data about the user\u2019s device.\n\u201cThey are doing some very interesting things that are on the edge of advanced device fingerprinting,\u201d Hoog said, noting that one property of the app tracks the device\u2019s name \u2014 which for many iOS devices defaults to the customer\u2019s name followed by the type of iOS device.\nThe device information shared, combined with the user\u2019s Internet address and data gathered from mobile advertising companies, could be used to deanonymize users of the DeepSeek iOS app, NowSecure warned. The report notes that DeepSeek communicates with Volcengine, a cloud platform developed by ByteDance (the makers of TikTok), although NowSecure said it wasn\u2019t clear if the data is just leveraging ByteDance\u2019s digital transformation cloud service or if the declared information share extends further between the two companies.\nPerhaps more concerning, NowSecure said the iOS app transmits device information \u201cin the clear,\u201d without any encryption to encapsulate the data. This means the data being handled by the app could be intercepted, read, and even modified by anyone who has access to any of the networks that carry the app\u2019s traffic.\n\u201cThe DeepSeek iOS app globally disables App Transport Security (ATS) which is an iOS platform level protection that prevents sensitive data from being sent over unencrypted channels,\u201d the report observed. \u201cSince this protection is disabled, the app can (and does) send unencrypted data over the internet.\u201d\nHoog said the app does selectively encrypt portions of the responses coming from DeepSeek servers. But they also found it uses an insecure and now deprecated encryption algorithm called 3DES (aka Triple DES), and that the developers had hard-coded the encryption key. That means the cryptographic key needed to decipher those data fields can be extracted from the app itself.\nThere were other, less alarming security and privacy issues highlighted in the report, but Hoog said he\u2019s confident there are additional, unseen security concerns lurking within the app\u2019s code.\n\u201cWhen we see people exhibit really simplistic coding errors, as you dig deeper there are usually a lot more issues,\u201d Hoog said. \u201cThere is virtually no priority around security or privacy. Whether cultural, or mandated by China, or a witting choice, taken together they point to significant lapse in security and privacy controls, and that puts companies at risk.\u201d\nApparently, plenty of others share this view. Axios reported on January 30 that U.S. congressional offices are being warned not to use the app.\n\u201c[T]hreat actors are already exploiting DeepSeek to deliver malicious software and infect devices,\u201d read the notice from the chief administrative officer for the House of Representatives. \u201cTo mitigate these risks, the House has taken security measures to restrict DeepSeek\u2019s functionality on all House-issued devices.\u201d\nTechCrunch reports that Italy and Taiwan have already moved to ban DeepSeek over security concerns. Bloomberg writes that The Pentagon has blocked access to DeepSeek. CNBC says NASA also banned employees from using the service, as did the U.S. Navy.\nBeyond security concerns tied to the DeepSeek iOS app, there are indications the Chinese AI company may be playing fast and loose with the data that it collects from and about users. On January 29, researchers at Wiz said they discovered a publicly accessible database linked to DeepSeek that exposed \u201ca significant volume of chat history, backend data and sensitive information, including log streams, API secrets, and operational details.\u201d\n\u201cMore critically, the exposure allowed for full database control and potential privilege escalation within the DeepSeek environment, without any authentication or defense mechanism to the outside world,\u201d Wiz wrote. [Full disclosure: Wiz is currently an advertiser on this website.]\nKrebsOnSecurity sought comment on the report from DeepSeek and from Apple. This story will be updated with any substantive replies.\nI have already forwarded this to everyone in our company who has a company cell phone. Already we only allow a small list of applications on our company phone via Intune. I am also concerned about the security of our employee\u2019s personal phones.\nI have my one own phone and believe you me, EVERY one\u2019s cut off from deep-seek.\nAustralian federal government, as well as several state governments, have all banned DeepSeek (for government usage) for these reasons \u2013 and one, suspects questions about Chinese government access and involvement.\nSchool Report Card:\nAptitude: A+\nAchievements: A+\nDiligence: B-\nImpact: A++++++++\nDeepseek has a tendancy to come up with some novel approaches and doesn\u2019t always follow the norms which have been set by his peer group. He is a loner in some respects, but I sense his presense, approach and following will grow over the course of 2025. His last piece of work was completed with haste, no doubt due to family commitments (MIC2025), but I liked the openness of the code which will allow his peer group to study and learn from it for future submissions. I\u2019ve given his peers a copy, so they can study it in earnest and I\u2019m hoping they will learn from it and it will inspire them to further their knowledge and understanding for all to share within the community in an open manner.\n/s\nExcellent overview on the risks thus far identified.\nBig yawn. Does anyone legitimately think OpenAI, etc doesn\u2019t have access to this data and wouldn\u2019t turn it over to the USG on simple ask, much less demand. You know kind of like how every US company has since CALEA.\nI\u2019d trust the Chinese government way more than I\u2019d trust the USG with my life\u2019s details. US public officials just mad they can\u2019t force Chinese companies to spy on US citizens or manufacturer evidence against them.\nThis complacency is the biggest problem of all, particularly for Gen Z and younger. They only know life in the digital world, where Western corporate practices have slowly eroded all manner of privacy; they don\u2019t know any different and could not care less. Who can blame them when your only choice is; do you want US tech giants abusing your data or the Chinese government? The genie got out of the bottle long ago: good luck putting that back in.\nOff topic but this is really a problem of education. I\u2019m Gen Z and from Germany. We take data security to extreme measures. We learn about it early on in school and it\u2019s a topic that gets picked up over and over throughout the years. Protecting personal data is essential and a fundamental right. Companies and institutions must comply to strict privacy laws like GDPR. Even the goverment can\u2019t do anything about it. This is an awareness that should be teached and trained anywhere in the world.\nAs a long-time proponent of sharing awareness of all things privacy and security related, this is encouraging to hear. I applaud the courage and actions of the EU in leading the way in protecting its citizens from the harms of the mass harvesting of private and personal data, performed by corporations today. Bravo.\nOne can only hope that other jurisdictions take note but I\u2019m not going to hold my breath.\n\u201cI applaud the courage and actions of the EU in leading the way in protecting its citizens from the harms of the mass harvesting of private and personal data, performed by corporations today. Bravo.\u201d\nAnd let me be on record defending mosquito netting over beds!\nThe Germans and old Eastern bloc nations are leading the way on this because they still have the actions of the Stasi in recent memory to act as a great motivator. Five eyes nations do not. Privacy legislation, like a mosquito net is better than nothing, but over time it can be improved. Maybe we need a repellent. And more education.\n\u201cI\u2019d trust the Chinese government way more than I\u2019d trust the USG with my life\u2019s details.\u201d\nSure you would sweetheart. Move there and we\u2019ll see.\nAbsolutely! This is a warning about nothing unexpected.\nAnyway, you can run DeepSeek locally, without having to send anything to China.\nI thought it was the first LLM I have seen which actually displayed behaviour that I\u2019d call \u201cIntelligent\u201d \u2013 it explained the reasoning it used to answer my question and that reasoning was actually quite impressive. It\u2019s certainly the first LLM I have seen which might actually deserve being called an \u201cAI\u201d.\nToo bad the company lied, it\u2019s a CCCP pet project, and it can\u2019t do basic mathematics\u2026\ngreat reasoning otherwise, derp.\nLiving in the US as a retired civilian with no security clearance whatsoever, I am actually more comfy with Chinese companies knowing stuff about me than American. Actually, that\u2019s a choice between two lesser evils. If I truly have a choice, I\u2019d put my trust in European companies outside of UK.\nBUT i I were living in China, then I would trust European companies first, then American \u2013 and the Chinese ones not at all \u2013 not even a little bit.\nMy points are: who you are and where you live can make a difference which country\u2019s companies/governments can affect you more.\nWait for it.\nSame security concerns over the desktop/laptop version? DIYs are airing on Youtube showing Deepseek running on a Raspberry Pi.\nNo. As long as you follow security best practise in hosting your own LLMs, there should be on problems. That is; running any LLMs locally, be it Deepseek, Llama, Mistral or otherwise, should be entirely sandboxed or cantainerised, with say Kubernetes or Docker to ensure there is no data leakage. I have yet to see any attempts at reaching out and I have been running Deepseek R1 since its release.\nRPI is not able to run the real deal, just the distilled version which is a poor imitation of the real 671b model\nI am fully aware of that. I was answering Mark\u2019s question concerning security as this is a Security site not an LLM guide.\nI am fully aware of that. Mark asked a security related question then made a statement. I replied to the question not the statement.\nHardware Security researcher Matt Brown performed Wireshark reconnaisance and packet inspection on the Chinese \u2018RedNote\u2019 app in the wake of the TikTok debacle a fortnight ago (link below). The results were alarmingly similar to these reports; use of hard-coded encryption keys and sending of plain text data to multiple Chinese based servers. Security does not seem to be a priority for any major Chinese software/app developer nowadays. Whether that is due to poor training/skills-base or by design, I\u2019ll leave that up to you to decide.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MZV6T6ag0c\nI remember a Far Side cartoon where a bunch of buffalo are stampeding and one says \u201cas if we all know where we\u2019re going\u201d.\nI\u2019m also old enough to remember an Internet and Web where one could just play around with the latest and greatest application or website and not really worry about what was heading back the other way.\nThose days are long gone, patience is not only a virtue now, it\u2019s damn good cybersecurity and privacy practice, as well as not jumping on a bandwagon.\nThanks as always for keeping us informed.\nHow much of this is applicable to the version of DeepSeek that can be run on a local server? I\u2019m guessing none\u2026\nIf it\u2019s china \u2013 everyone freaks out. This is projection from US firms \u2013 the US firms are spying on everyone, and playing \u2018fast and loose\u2019 with our data an could not care less about privacy \u2013 so therefore the Chineese must be doing the same (and maybe there are). Why not look in the mirror.\nThe bigger concern about AI, in the context of a blog like, this is the huge scope to train models in all things IT and to get the models to do the hacking for you. They will make human hackers look like children playing with wooden building blocks. But no one is talking about it.\n?\nWhile I agree that there is a lot of sensitive information going in to apps like ChatGPT as well as other social media applications none of them are hardcoding keys in to their application or disabling in transit encryption that is standard in the application. It\u2019s not so much projection as it is pointing out that this app is very insecure and seemingly a fly by night type of operation.\n@Mealy, see that\u2019s the point, I\u2019m not in their legal jurisdiction hence why I trust them. That\u2019s all the USG is upset about here, it\u2019s the other nations are providing data safe havens against them. If I lived in China as you suggested, obviously I\u2019d try and use a US AI product. 9/11 killed Tim May, AI buried him. The Internet could have been great.\nI read where Apple vetted apps published on its website to determine how much information was sent to the apps originators and even asked Facebook to stop collecting information that cost them millions of dollars. Why would they not do the same for DeepFake?\nThe image has a little typo on the upper left part where it says \u201cDeepServer Servers\u201d \u2013 it needs to read \u201cDeepSeek Servers\u201d (or similar). Good image still for those not technically well versed to explain it to them easily.\nI asked DeepSeek, Google Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot:\n\u201cAxios reported on January 30 that U.S. congressional offices are being warned not to use the app.\n\u201cThreat actors are already exploiting DeepSeek to deliver malicious software and infect devices,\u201d read the notice from the chief administrative officer for the House of Representatives.\nQuestion: How does DeepSeek deliver malicious software and infect devices?\u201d\nThe DeepSeek response was honest, detailed, and nuanced.\nCoPilot was brief and less detailed.\nGemini was brief, the least insightful, and totally failed to mention the counterfeit Python package problem.\nI think most people understand that everything you do on the internet is public. The use of a hard-coded key is not ideal, but even Chrome did that for Linux machines without a key-ring. (it\u2019s \u201cpeanuts\u201d) This would be for encryption at rest. Strange that they transmit credentials over http though\u2026 seems like a bad idea. The point about China company vs. US company is appropriate though\u2026 either way it\u2019s a company who\u2019s collecting info on you\u2026 whether that\u2019s Google or this Chinese company, or an intelligence agency it\u2019s a central repository that can be hacked by bad actors. A lot of the anti-Chinese privacy concerns do seem hypocritical to me. It\u2019s one thing to prevent guv\u2019ment employees with security clearances from accessing the apps\u2026 it\u2019s another to prevent all US citizens. If they\u2019re trying to protect us from threats they should do that across the board. Isn\u2019t the threat the same whether it\u2019s based in the US or China? A private company can gain access to secure guv\u2019ment workers through associates or family just as easily whether it\u2019s US, China, or multi-national based, no?\nThere are countless other apps with millions of users that collect the exact same user information, if not more, and transport it in the same way, with the same \u2018security risks.\u2019 The only reason for this is because of the suspected involvement of the Chinese government, which I would rather have control of my data than the U.S. government.\nYes, there are many apps that clearly don\u2019t care about security. But not many are the top downloaded apps for weeks on end.\n\u201cwhich I would rather have control of my data than the U.S. government.\u201d\nSo move to China. Problem solved, as far as you know.\nSo, basically, using Chinese Software means that the data is processed in China, is that the finding?\nSecurity concerns I understand, by the way, what is it no unencrypted or bas encrypted\u2026 cant be both I suppose"

      "text": "Running your own registry makes sense when you have cost pressures, compliance requirements that demand it, or complex enough infrastructure requirements to need a single source of images to use across different platforms \u2013 but you do need the organizational maturity to make a success of it.\nContainer registries are about much more than the container image storage provided in the free (and very popular) Docker Registry.\nEnterprises need image management covering the entire lifecycle of Open Container Initiative (OCI) artefacts, complete with security features like granular access control polices, image signing and vulnerability scanning, clustering and replication for high availability and scalability and the flexibility of a registry that can be deployed in multiple environments.\nHarbor offers all that: centralised management of container images across different infrastructure locations and multiple cloud providers, running on-premises, in the cloud or in hybrid environments to offer consistency with a single source of truth for images that connects to CI/CD pipelines, plus the auditing, policy enforcement and role-based access control (RBAC) organisations need for compliance.\nSee also: Aspire brings .NET the enterprise tooling it always needed\nWhile it\u2019s powerful enough for enterprises with thousands of developers storing tens of thousands of container images amounting to terabytes of data across multiple data centres, it\u2019s still usable for small teams with a handful of coders.\n\u201cOur customers are seeking greater control, flexibility, and security in managing their container registries,\u201d Mirantis product manager Robert Illing told us. \u201cContainer registries aren\u2019t just a convenience\u2014they\u2019re a critical part of their software supply chain. They\u2019re tasked with securely storing, scanning, and distributing container images across a mix of environments: on-premises data centres, private clouds, and public cloud providers like AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. Harbor provides a unique combination of open-source innovation and enterprise-grade features that directly address their challenges.\u201d\nAlong with Kubernetes itself, Harbor is probably one of the most mature CNCF projects: fully graduated, it\u2019s used by a wide range of organisations from Lockheed Martin, JD.com, SNCF and CERN to the Dutch government, as well as technology providers like TikTok owner Bytedance and European cloud provider OVH. It\u2019s an open source project that\u2019s included in multiple Kubernetes distributions like Tanzu, Rancher and Red Hat OpenShift and is also available as a supported offering from providers like Mirantis and 8gears.\nIt\u2019s not certainly the only choice: there are alternatives like Red Hat Quay (available as both open source and a commercial enterprise solution) and every cloud provider and source code management platform offers a registry \u2013 many based on Docker Registry, although some like OVH\u2019s Private Managed Registry and Vultr are Harbor underneath.\nOVH even contributed the Harbor operator for Kubernetes to make it easier for large-scale providers to swap out the standard services used for Harbor dependencies (the storage backend, databases and cache default to familiar technologies like PostgreSQL, MySQL and Redis but can run on other services if you already have them deployed) and simplify choosing which optional Harbor modules to load.\nHarbor is often seen as complementary to commercial registries from JFrog, Sonatype and Cloudsmith, Harbor maintainer Vadim Bauer from 8gears explained.\n\u201cThese classical artefacts like Java don't have operational criticality, so it\u2019s not always a problem if the artefact store is offline for a certain time. However, in a container environment, the registry is a crucial part of deployment but also crucial for the operational workflow, if there\u2019s rescheduling and pods go down or clusters come up. The dynamic nature of these environments requires a registry that is always available, unlike traditional artefacts that only need to be there when there is a new release.\u201d\nWhile smaller organisations might replace a commercial artefact store like JFrog or Sonatype with Harbor, larger organisations often add Harbor alongside an existing tool for the flexibility of running it on their own hardware or in the cloud, where it\u2019s easier to manage access.\n\u201cHarbor can be deployed on cloud native infrastructure: the artefact store they already have in place is somewhere in the cellar, it's not available accessible from the outside,\u201d Bauer noted.\nHarbor integrates with enterprise LDAP and Active Directory systems for user authentication and management but it\u2019s also more flexible than cloud registries if you\u2019re working with external partners or consultants. \u201cIt\u2019s sometimes quite difficult to onboard them in the IAM systems of cloud providers because those are tied to employee enrolment systems.\u201d\nAt the other extreme, it\u2019s the obvious choice for regulated organisations that need to run air gapped environments.\nSingle source of truth\nFor many organisations, the appeal of Harbor is that it both acts a centralised hub for on-premise workloads, ensuring compliance with internal security policies across multiple locations, but also connects to OCI-compliant public cloud registries, replicating images for deployment based on policies and filters, which simplifies hybrid cloud operations.\n\u201cWith Harbor, they get the best of both worlds,\u201d Illing said. \u201cIt enables them to consolidate image management while maintaining the flexibility to push and pull images across diverse environments.\u201d\nThat\u2019s important for efficiency and consistency in \u2018day two operations\u2019 as well as deployment. \u201cIf you have all these little siloes, you might unintentionally get a fragmented security policy.\u201d\nHarbor works well for the increasingly complex infrastructures in many organisations, as teams make different choices or acquisitions bring applications and infrastructure with them: it handles load balancing, high availability, multi-data centre, hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios.\n\u201cThe way many people use Harbor is to deploy a central Harbor registry where every artefact from across the organisation, all the teams, are in one place so they can apply the same policies, same rules and same workflows,\u201d Bauer said. That can include caching images from popular project that use public registries, to avoid disruption from rate limiting.\nFrom there, images can be deployed directly to clusters or replicated to and from other registries. For organisations needing a more distributed option, especially for intermittently connected environments, Harbor\u2019s new Satellite feature will ship in 2025, adding high availability for defining subsets of images that will not just replicate but automatically sync from the centrally managed registry to local registries.\nIf you\u2019re using cloud services for Kubernetes workloads, Harbor already replicates to cloud registries for easy deployment. Even if you only use a single cloud platform, you might choose Harbor because the convenience of tight integration with the cloud provider\u2019s own registry can also tie you to that cloud.\n\u201cWe use Azure, but we wanted to stay cloud agnostic,\u201d explained Ra\u00fal Garcia Sanchez, application platform lead at German Internet exchange DE-CIX. Rather than using Azure Registry, running Harbor in an AKS cluster (with images stored in an S3 bucket) gives them flexibility to move to another cloud provider or even back to on-premises infrastructure if that makes sense in the future. \u201cWe could easily spin up a cluster here in house and just start exactly the same services in exactly the same way.\u201d\nUsing Docker Registry would mean implementing authentication, cache functionality, vulnerability scanning and project management separately. \u201cAll of this just comes for free when you use Harbor and it\u2019s free to use, so the decision was very easy.\u201d\nHe described setup and maintenance as straightforward and the registry as easy for users to understand. \u201cWe use Terraform to configure all the Harbor parameters and it also integrates well with identity providers so you can easily use YDC (Yubico Directory Connector) for authentication, for instance). And the feature stack is exactly what we needed.\u201d Harbor can be configured via API using Pulumi or even cloud CLIs, making it easy to integrate.\n\u201cIf you compare Harbor with other solutions, there is no solution that includes all of this and that comes so well integrated, and with such a good community.\u201d Taking Kubecon as a barometer of interest, he noted \u201cthere is basically no one talking about any other container registries.\u201d\nOpen, supported and thriving\nOriginally a VMware project, Harbor is one of the more mature CNCF offerings and although Broadcom's plans aren\u2019t entirely clear (historically, it hasn\u2019t made any significant investments in open source and none of the VMware Harbor team attended the most recent Kubecon North America), the strong open source community with a wide range of contributors means there's no anxiety about the future; there are already significant new features on the roadmap.\nIt\u2019s also reassuring that Harbor builds on other familiar open source components like Docker Distribution (the technology that powers Docker Registry), Cosign for signing container images (replacing Notary which was no longer in active development), Clair and Trivy for vulnerability scanning and NGINX for serving the portal.\nJoin peers following The Stack on LinkedIn\nOrganisations often choose Harbor specifically because it\u2019s open source, to avoid vendor lock-in. SNCF previously used a closed source registry tool but a few years ago became unhappy with increases in licence costs, especially as it was missing important features like artefact replication and storing Helm chart and slow to respond to requests for improvements. \u201cIt was important to us that the product we were going to use was open source and the best thing was that it was at the CNCF,\u201d Florian Blampey, platform engineer at SNCF and maintainer of the Terraform Harbor provider, told us.\nHarbor already had the features they wanted and \u201cwe thought with a CNCF project, it should be easier to improve the software\u201d. That\u2019s proved true. \u201cWe\u2019re happy users and when we ask for new features, most of the time they happen.\u201d That includes not just minor bugs and general issues like performance but more significant new features like Security Hub where admins can see all CVEs and vulnerability artefacts across the registry.\n\u201cHarbor has the largest upstream community for cloud native registries,\u201d Illing noted. \u201cWe contribute and so do many large enterprises; the upstream community includes [larger vendors like] Rackspace and SUSE, individuals, medium-sized businesses\u2026 That means when you look at CVEs, those are just quicker [to get dealt with]; when you look at bugs and general security challenges, those are just quicker, when you look at features, there\u2019s a larger upstream ecosystem to help address all of that.\u201d\nGarcia Sanchez agrees. \u201cThe functionality is very nice and it\u2019s very well integrated. It's actively developed, so there are new features coming every [release] and they keep everything up to date, so there aren\u2019t a lot of vulnerabilities.\u201d\nMuch more than containers\nHarbor isn\u2019t just for container images (or artefacts like Bicep modules and Radius recipes that can be stored in a container image): it can store other OCI artefacts. Helm charts are an extremely popular workload - putting application-related artefacts like documentation and configuration files close to the workload is efficient \u2013 but it also supports more niche options like WASM and OPA policies. Again, the appeal is obvious: running a distributed, highly available registry can be a significant commitment and no one wants to stand up a new registry for every new type of artefact they need to store.\n\u201cPeople are using Helm charts extensively with Harbor; it\u2019s slowly taking over compared to the traditional Helm charts format and storage method because it has a few advantages,\u201d Bauer noted but also highlighted a recent trend he expects to become more common: storing AI models in Harbor registries. \u201cPeople who are running Harbor on premise tend to also run their own data models on premise, so this goes hand in hand.\u201d\nHarbor has supported storing machine learning models for Kubernetes workloads since 2020, using an OCI schema to handle them (which could also be used for other custom artefacts). This separates the model (which changes frequently) from the model server (which doesn\u2019t) and uses Harbor\u2019s webhooks to trigger notifications: as soon as a model is updated and pushed to Harbor, that new model can automatically be redeployed.\nSome organisations also use Harbor to store training or evaluation data: a Swiss medical research institute stores test data, training data, X-rays and DNA models all as OCI artefacts. He predicted better support for AI models in future. \u201cHopefully there\u2019s going to be some standardization for storing AI models in OCI: there's already some work in this space and we hope we will support this as first class [artefacts].\u201d\nThere\u2019s also interest in bringing more artefact types to OCI. Google Artefact Registry already stores Maven, npm, Python, Apt and Yum packages alongside container images but rather than adding new artefact types to Harbor, Bauer hopes to see artefacts adopt OCI schemas because of the larger benefits it offers for supply chain security with Harbor\u2019s support for signing, vulnerability checking and SBOMs (creating a list of dependencies, versions and associated licences, on demand or automatically when an image is pushed).\n\u201cIn Maven, there is no concept [of an SBOM] built in so it needs to be added on top: you need to have a specific thing to do it and then you cannot hook it up to your other processes, like you do with OCI. If you could do it the same way for Maven artefacts that you can with OCI, then you can sign them the same way, you can attach the SBOM in the same way at the same place, and you can really containerize those artefacts so they fit in the same workflow and ecosystem.\u201d\nThe right place in the pipeline for security\nSitting close to the end of the delivery pipeline makes Harbor a good place bring everything together and visualize CVEs, vulnerabilities and other security issues. Image scanning detects and blocks vulnerabilities before they can reach production, while audit logging of image activity improves traceability and operational confidence.\n\u201cCISOs are really interested in this aspect because they want to have everything in one place, because then they can run analytics, they can run the export, they can run SBOMs, they can run the vulnerability checks in one central place,\u201d Bauer explained.\nHarbor replaces multiple other tools that used to be required to create, package and consume SBOMs, simplifying supply chain security by making it just another artefact to work with.\nWith hundreds of images used hourly, DE-CIX hasn\u2019t turn on creating SBOMs by default but Garcia Sanchez noted he recently saw the first internal request for an image SBOM. \u201cIf people need an SBOM, they can easily produce it.\u201d\nSo far, it seems to be mainly government and regulated organisations using Harbor\u2019s SBOM support, but Bauer predicted this will become more significant, especially with the EU\u2019s proposed Cyber Resilience Act requiring anyone selling into the European market to provide supply chain transparency via SBOMs. \u201cThis will become more mature and more usable, and I think it will also become more actionable. Currently we're just producing it to have it, and a lot of organization don't act on it, but in the future, this information will definitely be something organisations will act upon.\u201d\nMore improvements like the Security Hub will simplify this \u201cso that people can make better decisions before they deploy software\u201d. That\u2019s the kind of feature that means Harbor isn\u2019t just an infrastructure tool, good as it is at that: it\u2019s becoming increasingly strategic.\nSign up for The Stack\nInterviews, Insight, Intelligence for Digital Leaders\nNo spam.
