      "summary": "Cruise ship internet has improved significantly with the introduction of technologies like Starlink, yet prices remain high and connectivity is often treated as a premium add-on. Passengers are cautioned against using personal satellite devices like Starlink due to strict bans by cruise lines, which enforce penalties for violations. Additionally, first-time cruisers are advised to avoid common mistakes such as overpacking, relying solely on cruise line excursions, and neglecting to monitor onboard spending, to enhance their overall experience.",
