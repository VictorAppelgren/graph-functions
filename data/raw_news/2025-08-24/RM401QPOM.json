  "title": "The Beginner's Guide to Boolean Logic in Microsoft Excel",
  "description": "Boost your Boolean boon.",
  "content": "If you've encountered the word \"Boolean\" but aren't quite sure what it means, this is the guide for you! From definitions of key terms to easy-to-follow examples, here's everything you need to know about Boolean logic in Microsoft Excel.\n\nHere are four key terms that are used in this article and are essential to understanding how Boolean logic works:\n\u2022 Boolean logic: The method used to evaluate conditions, returning either TRUE or FALSE.\n\u2022 Boolean values: The two Boolean values are TRUE and FALSE. When used in formulas, TRUE is equal to 1, and FALSE is equal to 0.\n\u2022 Logical functions: The primary logical functions in Excel that enable you to apply Boolean logic are AND, OR, XOR, NOT, IF, and variations of these.\n\u2022 Logical operators: Mathematical symbols used to compare values to return a Boolean value. The comparison operators in Excel are = (equal to), > (greater than), = (greater than or equal to), = (not equal to).\n\nThe results of Boolean logic are always TRUE if the stated conditions are met, or FALSE if they're not.\n\ninto a cell in Excel and pressing Enter returns TRUE, because the value before the equal logical operator is the same as the value after the equal logical operator. In other words, 15 is equal to 15, so the result is TRUE.\n\nSimilarly, in this example, typing:\n\nreturns FALSE, because the value in cell B2 is not equal to the value in cell B3.\n\nAlthough the results in the above examples appear to be textual, Boolean values actually carry numerical values. Specifically, TRUE = 1, and FALSE = 0. You can test this by using the SUM function to add cells containing these Boolean values. Here, typing:\n\nreturns 1, because you're adding a TRUE value (1) to a FALSE value (0).\n\nLet's look at Boolean values in action in a real-world scenario.\n\nImagine you're tracking the number of deliveries each employee has made over a four-day period. Each worker has 100 items to deliver, and you want to use Boolean logic to find out whether they've completed them all.\n\nTo do this, in cell F2, type:\n\nBecause the values in cells B2, C2, D2, and E2 equal 100 when added together, the result is TRUE.\n\nHowever, when you select cell F2 and double-click the fill handle to apply the formula to the remaining cells, you can see that the Boolean values in cells F3 and F4 are FALSE, because the number of items offloaded for each of those employees doesn't equal 100.\n\nTo visualize the Boolean values more clearly, you can turn them into checkboxes, where TRUE generates a checked checkbox, and FALSE generates an unchecked checkbox. Select all the cells containing Boolean values, and in the Insert tab on the ribbon, click \"Checkbox.\"\n\nNow, if you update the figures so that employee B's totals equal 100, the Boolean value turns to TRUE, and, thus, the checkbox is checked.\n\nOn the other hand, armed with the knowledge that checked checkboxes are equal to 1, you can use them to track task progress. Here, typing:\n\ninto cell E2, returns TRUE if all checkboxes are checked (1*1*1=1), or FALSE if any of the checkboxes are unchecked (for example, 1*0*1=0).\n\nYou can then turn these Boolean values into checkboxes themselves if you wish.\n\nLogical Functions: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and IF\n\nSo far, I've shown you how Boolean logic works to test whether one thing equals another. However, you can use Excel's logical functions to test more than one condition, check whether one thing doesn't equal another, or return alternative values to TRUE and FALSE.\n\nAND, OR, and XOR: Testing Multiple Conditions\n\nAs their names suggest, the AND, OR, and XOR logical functions evaluate more than one condition using Boolean logic to return either TRUE or FALSE:\n\nIn this example, the AND function returns TRUE for employees A and D because both conditions (the Induction and Probation columns containing \"Y\") are met.\n\nHere, the OR function returns TRUE for employee B in cell D2, because even though the value in cell B3 isn't equal to \"Gold,\" the value in cell C3 is equal to \"Senior,\" so one of the conditions is met. On the other hand, employees A, C, and D meet neither of these two criteria, so their outcomes are FALSE.\n\nThe XOR function is best used when there's a choice of A or B, as it allows you to track whether neither, both, or only one option is selected.\n\nHere, employees can select either healthcare plan A or healthcare plan B. If they check only one of these options, the XOR function returns TRUE. However, if they check neither or both options, the function returns FALSE.\n\nYou can also nest these logical functions to create even more specific conditions.\n\nIn this example, the Boolean logic returns TRUE if (1) the value in column B is either \"Sun\" or \"Overcast,\" and (2) the value in column C is \"Y.\"\n\nThe NOT function in Excel essentially flips the Boolean logic by returning TRUE if the conditions are not met, or FALSE if the conditions are met.\n\nIn this example, the NOT function returns TRUE if the values in column B do not match the values in column C:\n\nAs with the examples above, you can nest other logical functions inside a NOT formula to evaluate multiple conditions. Here, typing:\n\nreturns TRUE if the U.S. and U.K. ratings for a restaurant are not both \"Good.\"\n\nOn the other hand, using the same logic with NOT and OR, this formula returns TRUE if neither the U.S. nor the U.K. ratings are \"Good.\"\n\nWhile Boolean logic primarily returns Boolean values (TRUE or FALSE), you can force Excel to return alternative values using the IF function.\n\nThe syntax for the IF function is as follows:\n\u2022 a is the Boolean logical test, which can be evaluated as either TRUE or FALSE,\n\u2022 b is the value to return instead of TRUE, and\n\u2022 c is the value to return instead of FALSE.\n\nArgument a is mandatory, and both or either arguments b and/or c must also be provided. If you omit argument b or argument c, the formula will return TRUE or FALSE in its place.\n\nSuppose you're recruiting staff for your business. Specifically, you want to interview candidates who meet the following criteria:\n\u2022 They have the silver or gold certification,\n\u2022 They have provided referees on their resume, and\n\nIf they meet the above criteria, you want to return \"Interview\" in the status column. However, if they don't meet them, you want to return \"Send rejection.\"\n\nTo do this, in cell E2, type:\n\u2022 The IF function uses Boolean logic and allows you to return \"Interview\" instead of TRUE, and \"Send rejection\" instead of FALSE,\n\u2022 The OR function tests whether the value in column B is either \"Silver\" or \"Gold,\" and\n\u2022 The AND function checks whether, as well as having silver or gold certification (column B), the candidate has provided referees (column C) and can travel (column D).\n\nIf you are using Boolean logic to evaluate numerical values, you don't just have to use the equal sign. Indeed, you can test whether a value is greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, or not equal to another value.\n\nIn this example, if a student has scored 75 or more, you want to return \"Pass\" in column C. If they haven't, you want to return \"Fail.\"\n\nThe formula to achieve this is as follows:\n\nYou can use Boolean logic and logical operators with dates, where the \"greater than\" symbol (>) means \"later than,\" the \"less than\" symbol (<) means \"earlier than.\"\n\nreturns \"Coming soon\" if the date in column B is later than today's date, or \"Available now\" if the date in column B is earlier than today's date.\n\nIf you're including the date within the formula (rather than referencing a cell containing the date), use the DATEVALUE function, with the date wrapped inside double quotation marks, then inside parentheses:\n\nNow that you know how to apply Boolean logic to your figures in Microsoft Excel, take this knowledge one step further by making the most of the power of the COUNTIF, SUMIF, and AVERAGEIF functions to count, sum, and average cells that match certain criteria.",

      "text": "Quick Links\nAdding numbers together in Microsoft Excel is a basic calculation that can use the SUM function. What if you want to add those values but only if they meet certain conditions? This is when the SUMIF function comes in.\nWith SUMIF, you can add the values in the cells you specify as long as they meet specific criteria. Maybe you want to find the total sales but only for certain products or the total revenue but only for particular locations.\nIf your Excel sheet is set up in a way that your calculation isn't easily determined, the SUMIF function and its formula can help.\nUse SUMIF For a Single Cell Range\nThe syntax for the function is\nSUMIF(cell_range, criteria, sum_range)\nwhere the first two arguments are required. Because sum_range\nis optional, you can add numbers in one range that correlate to criteria in another.\nTo get the basic feel of the function and its arguments, let's start by using a single range of cells without the optional argument.\nYou could add values in a cell range only if they are greater than a certain amount. Enter the following formula, replacing the cell references and criteria with your own.\n=SUMIF(C2:C7,\">25000\")\nThis formula adds the numbers in the cell range C2 through C7 only if they are greater than 25,000.\nOn the flip side, you can add numbers that are less than a certain amount using this formula:\n=SUMIF(B2:B7,\"<10000\")\nThis adds the numbers in cells B2 through B7 only if they are less than 10,000.\nFor one more example, you can add numbers that are the same amount with this formula:\n=SUMIF(A2:A7,\"5000\")\nThis adds the numbers in cells A2 through A7 only if they are exactly 5,000.\nUse SUMIF With Number Criteria for Multiple Ranges\nNow let's put that conditional argument to work, sum_range\n. Here we're calculating expenses and revenue. With SUMIF, we can calculate the revenue for locations whose expenses meet our criteria and vice versa.\nWith this formula you can add the revenue in cells C2 through C7 only if the expenses in cells B2 through B7 are less than 10,000.\n=SUMIF(B2:B7,\"<10000\",C2:C7)\nUsing the following formula, you can add the expenses in cells B2 through B7 only if the revenue in cells C2 through C7 is greater than 25,000.\n=SUMIF(C2:C7,\">25000\",B2:B7)\nYou can also replace the actual value in the formula with one contained in a cell. For instance, this formula adds the numbers in B2 through B7 if the value in C2 through C7 is greater than the value in cell D2.\n=SUMIF(C2:C7,\">\"&D2,B2:B7)\nThis formula uses the greater than symbol (\">\") and cell D2 (&D2).\nUse SUMIF With Text Criteria for Multiple Ranges\nMaybe the values you want to add correlate to text rather than numbers. Here we have types, products, and sales. Using SUMIF, you can add values in the Sales column for products that meet certain conditions in the other columns.\nIn this example, you can add the sales in cells C2 through C7 only if the text in cells A2 through B7 equals the word Apparel.\n=SUMIF(A2:B7,\"Apparel\",C2:C7)\nFor another example, you can add the sales in cells C2 through C7 for products in cells B2 through B7 that end in \"ts.\"\n=SUMIF(B2:B7,\"*ts\",C2:C7)\nIn this formula, the asterisk (*) is a wildcard representing any letters before \"ts\".\nOne more example uses our Shoes product whose Type is blank.\n=SUMIF(A2:B7,\"\",C2:C7)\nIn this formula the quotation marks are side-by-side with no space between them. This gives us the sales for Shoes as seen below.\nThe SUMIF function in Excel allows you to take a basic equation and spice it up to fit your needs. It's super handy when adding numbers isn't as simple as two plus two.\nFor additional help, take a look at how to find the function you need in Excel."

      "text": "Quick Links\nMicrosoft Excel may be known for complex calculations and formulas, but it\u2019s no slouch at simple arithmetic. There are a number of ways to find solutions to simple math problems, like finding the sum of numbers in multiple cells.\nFinding the Sum of Numbers in Adjacent Columns or Cells\nThe quickest way to calculate the sum of squares in Excel is to simply highlight the list of numbers, and check the bottom right of the screen. Here, you\u2019ll find the sum of any selected cell as well as their average and the number of cells you\u2019re adding.\nBut, we\u2019ll assume you want to add the sum to the workbook itself. In that case, highlight the numbers you want to add.\nFrom the \u201cFormulas\u201d tab, click \u201cAutosum\u201d to find the sum of the list of numbers. Once you click, Excel will automatically add the sum to the bottom of this list.\nAlternatively, you can type the formula\n=SUM(D1:D7)\nin the formula bar and then press \"Enter\" on the keyboard or click the checkmark in the formula bar to execute the formula. Change the letters and numbers in parenthesis to fit your workbook.\nFinding the Sum of Numbers in Non-Adjacent Columns or Cells\nClick any empty cell in the workbook. This should be the cell where you want to display the sum of these non-adjacent columns.\nFrom the \u201cFormulas\u201d tab, click the arrow icon at the right of \u201cAutosum.\u201d\nChoose \u201cSum.\u201d\nClick the first number in the series.\nHold the \"Shift\" button and then click the last number in that column to select all of the numbers in between.\nTo add the second column of numbers, hold Ctrl and scroll down from the first to the last number in the column. Alternatively, you can add the formula\n=SUM(D1:D7,F1:F7)\nto the formula bar. Swap the cells inside the parenthesis to fit your needs.\nPress the \"Enter\" button on the keyboard, or the checkmark in the formula bar to execute the formula."

      "text": "Quick Links\nOnce, if you wanted to add checkboxes to your Excel spreadsheet, you had to use Form Controls in the Developer tab, a route that required some level of expertise. However, in June 2024, Microsoft introduced a much simpler way to use checkboxes.\nHow to Add and Remove Checkboxes\nExcel's Checkbox option is in the Controls group of the Insert tab on the ribbon. By default, the Controls group isn't immediately visible when you open the Insert tab, so first, you'll need to enable it first.\nRight-click anywhere on the ribbon, and click \"Customize The Ribbon.\"\nNow, in the Choose Commands From field, click \"Main Tabs.\"\nNext, click the \"Insert\" arrow to expand the Insert options, and select \"Controls.\" Then, to add this to the ribbon, click \"Add.\"\nFinally, click \"OK\" to close the dialog box. You will then see Checkbox in the Controls group of the Insert tab on the ribbon, which you can click anytime to add one to your sheet.\nTo reposition the Checkbox button within the Insert tab on the ribbon, use the arrows on the right-hand side of the Customize The Ribbon dialog box.\nWhat the Spacebar and Delete Keys Do to Checkboxes\nBefore you get to know the different ways you can use checkboxes, it's worth knowing how they're affected by different keys.\nWhen you click the Checkbox icon in the Insert tab, you'll see an unchecked checkbox added to whichever cell was selected. If you select more than one cell, several checkboxes will be added\u2014one in each cell. While using your mouse to click the checkbox will add and remove the checkmark, you can also use the Spacebar to do the same, a handy tip if you prefer to work in Excel using only your keyboard. Likewise, if you select several cells containing a checkbox and press the Spacebar, they'll all be checked and unchecked at the same time.\nTo delete a checkbox from your sheet, select the cell where the checkbox is located, and press Delete. If your checkbox is checked, pressing Delete will first uncheck the checkbox, and pressing it again will remove the checkbox altogether.\nHow to Use Checkboxes With IF\nThe first step in getting used to using checkboxes with Excel's functions is to try it with the IF function alone.\nIn the table below, we want the \"Status\" column to tell us whether the task is complete or incomplete based on whether the checkboxes are checked or unchecked.\nWhen a checkbox is checked, it has a value of TRUE, and when unchecked, it's FALSE. So, when using the IF function, these are the arguments that we will tell Excel to consider.\nStarting in cell C2, we will create an IF formula with the following syntax:\n=IF(x=y,\"a\",\"b\")\nwhere x is the cell containing the checkbox, y is TRUE or FALSE, a is the result we want to produce if the condition we entered is fulfilled, and b is the result if the condition isn't fulfilled.\nIn our case, we'll type\n=IF(B2=TRUE,\"Complete\",\"Incomplete\")\nbecause we want Excel to find out whether the checkbox in B2 is checked, and produce the words \"Complete\" or \"Incomplete\" accordingly in C2.\nRemember to use quotation marks around values a and b if you want Excel to produce text based on the checkbox's status.\nIf you have formatted your table using Excel's table formatter, when you press Enter after typing the above formula, you'll see the formula automatically duplicated to the other cells in that column.\nNow, check some of the checkboxes to see the outcomes in column C change.\nIf you click and drag the table handle (in the bottom-right corner of the formatted table) downwards, the new row will automatically contain the checkbox and the status formula you added.\nHow to Use Checkboxes With AND or OR\nWe're now ready to use the checkboxes to check the progress of tasks containing more than one stage.\nUsing Checkboxes With AND\nIn this example, we want the \"Status\" column to tell us whether all phases of each task have been checked.\nThis is why we need to use the AND function alongside the IF function\u2014the AND tells Excel we're evaluating several criteria at the same time.\nHere's the syntax:\n=IF(AND(x:y=z)\"a\",\"b\")\nwhere x:y is the range containing the checkboxes, z is TRUE or FALSE, and a and b are the results we want to see, depending on whether all the conditions are met.\nSo, in our case, we'll type\n=IF(AND(B2:D2=TRUE),\"Complete\",\"Incomplete\")\nbecause we want Excel to evaluate the checkboxes in cells B2, C2, and D2, telling us whether or not they're all checked.\nUsing Checkboxes With OR\nYou can also follow the same principle with the OR function:\n=IF(OR(x:y=z)\"a\",\"b\")\nwhere x:y is the range containing the checkboxes, z is TRUE or FALSE, and a and b are the results we want to see. This tells Excel to evaluate the checkboxes to see if any (rather than all) are checked.\nIn this example, Excel tells us whether a task is pending (if none of the checkboxes are checked) or actioned (if any of the checkboxes are checked), as we have typed the following formula:\n=IF(OR(B2:D2=TRUE),\"Actioned\",\"Pending\")\nHow to Apply Conditional Formatting on Checkboxes\nTo make it even easier to visualize your data and track task progress, you can use Conditional Formatting to apply colors to the checkboxes or the cells where they're located.\nIn this example, we want the cells containing the checkboxes to turn green when they're checked.\nTo do this, we need to select all the cells containing the checkboxes, click \"Conditional Formatting\" in the Home tab, and choose \"New Rule.\"\nIn the New Formatting Rule dialog box, follow these steps:\n- Click \"Format Only Cells That Contain.\"\n- Set the first and second drop-downs as \"Cell Value\" and \"Equal To,\" respectively.\n- Type TRUE or FALSE, depending on whether you want the formatting to apply to a checked or an unchecked box.\n- Click \"Format,\" and set the formatting according to what you want to happen when the checkboxes are checked or unchecked. In our case, we're formatting the cells to be filled with green when the checkboxes are checked.\n- Click \"OK.\"\nHow to Apply Conditional Formatting in Other Cells Based on the Checkboxes\nThe final option is to format the whole row if all its checkboxes are checked. In our case, we want to clearly show that tasks 3 and 5 are complete.\nStart by selecting the entire table (except for the header row), and launch the New Formatting Rule dialog box by clicking Conditional Formatting > New Rule.\nThen, use the following steps:\n- Click \"Use A Formula To Determine Which Cells To Format.\"\n- In the empty field box, type =AND($B2:$D2,\"TRUE\"), where $B2:$D2 are the cells containing the checkbox on the first row of the table, and \"TRUE\" tells Excel to apply the formatting when all the checkboxes are checked. Make sure you add the dollar symbol before the column references ($B2 and $D2)\u2014this tells Excel that we want to apply the Conditional Formatting rule to all rows within those fixed columns.\n- Click \"Formatting\" to determine what happens when the condition you've set is met. In our case, we're choosing a yellow fill.\n- Click \"OK.\"\nCheckboxes aren't the only way to track your task progress. Indeed, you can create a whole dashboard of data in Excel to monitor your workflow at a glance."

      "text": "Quick Links\nIf you're familiar with using the IF function in Excel, then you might be ready to check out the IFS function. With it, you can test multiple conditions at once, instead of using nested IF statements.\nUsing IFS, you can test up to 127 conditions in a single Excel formula. Although this number of tests is probably much more than you need, the function is ideal for checking several conditions. The formula then returns the value you specify for the first true condition in the statement.\nUse the IFS Function in Excel\nThe syntax for the function is\nIFS(test1, if_true1, test2, if_true2,...)\nwhere you enter the condition for each\ntest\nargument and the value to return if the test is true for each\ntrue\nargument.\nLet's look at a few basic examples.\nReturn Cell Reference Values\nHere, the condition looks at the ID number in cell C2. When the formula finds the matching condition, 1 through 5, it returns the corresponding name.\n=IFS(C2=1,A2,C2=2,A3,C2=3,A4,C2=4,A5,C2=5,A6)\nTo break down the formula, if the value in cell C2 is 1, return the value in A2, if it's 2, return the value in A3, if it's 3, return the value in A4, if it's 4, return the value in A5, and if it's 5, return the value in A6.\nIf you were to use a nested IF statement instead of the IFS function, your formula would look like this:\n=IF(C2=1,A2,IF(C2=2,A3,IF(C2=3,A4,IF(C2=4, A5,IF(C2=5,A6)))))\nWhile you obtain the same result using either option, the formula for the IFS function is a little less confusing and doesn't take as much time to assemble.\nReturn Numbers\nFor another IFS example, we'll apply bonuses to our salespeople based on their sales totals. Here's the formula:\n=IFS(F2>100000,1000,F2>75000,750,F2>50000,500)\nTo break down this formula, if the total in cell F2 is greater than 100,000, return 1,000, if it's greater than 75,000, return 750, and if it's greater than 50,000, return 500.\nYou can use the fill handle to copy the same IFS formula to adjacent cells.\nTo compare again, here is what the formula looks like as a nested IF statement instead:\n=IF(F2>100000,1000,IF(F2>75000,750,IF(F2>50000,500)))\nBy using the formula for the IFS function, you eliminate the need to repeatedly type IF with an opening parenthesis and remember the correct number of closing parentheses at the end.\nReturn Text Values\nIn this next example, we have a list of employees who haven't finished their training. We'll display a text result based on the percent complete in cell B2. Note that the text values must be in quotes.\n=IFS(B2<50,\"Less than half\",B2=50,\"Half\",B2>50,\"More than half\")\nTo break down this formula, if the value in cell B2 is less than 50, return \"Less than half,\" if it equals 50, return \"Half,\" and if it's more than 50, return \"More than half.\"\nFor one more comparison, here is what the nested IF statement looks like to obtain the same result:\n=IF(B2<50,\"Less than half\",IF(B2=50,\"Half\",IF(B2>50,\"More than half\")))\nIt can be especially difficult to troubleshoot formulas errors in lengthy statements or those that needs extra care like including quotation marks. This is just one more reason to consider using the IFS function instead of a nested IF formula.\nMultiple IF statements require a great deal of thought to build correctly and make sure that their logic can calculate correctly through each condition all the way to the end. If you don't nest your formula 100% accurately, then it might work 75% of the time, but return unexpected results 25% of the time.\nMicrosoft goes on to say that nested IF statements can be hard to maintain. This is another consideration for using the IFS function, especially if you're working on your spreadsheet with others.\nWhen you want to test several conditions for a cell, or even a cell range, consider using the IFS function. For more, learn how to use the other logical functions in Excel like AND, OR, and XOR.\n|\nMastering Excel Functions |\n||\n|\nFunctions |\nAVERAGE \u00b7 CONCATENATE \u00b7 COUNT \u00b7 COUNTIF \u00b7 DATEDIF \u00b7 FILTER \u00b7 FREQUENCY \u00b7 FV \u00b7 HYPERLINK \u00b7 IF \u00b7 IFS \u00b7 IMAGE \u00b7 INDEX \u00b7 IS \u00b7 LEN \u00b7 MATCH \u00b7MEDIAN \u00b7 RAND \u00b7 ROUND \u00b7 RRI \u00b7 SORT \u00b7 SQRT \u00b7 SUBSTITUTE \u00b7 SUBTOTAL \u00b7 SUM \u00b7 SUMIF \u00b7 TODAY \u00b7 TRIM \u00b7 TRUNC \u00b7 VLOOKUP \u00b7 WEEKDAY \u00b7 XLOOKUP \u00b7 YEAR |\n|\n|\nTypes |\nBasic \u00b7 Budgeting \u00b7 Data Entry \u00b7 Logical \u00b7 Text \u00b7 Time and Date |\n|\n|\nExplained |\nCopying Formulas \u00b7 Evaluating Formulas \u00b7 Finding Functions \u00b7 Fixing Formula Errors \u00b7 Functions vs Formulas \u00b7 Comparing Lookup Functions \u00b7 Locking Formulas \u00b7 Structuring Formulas \u00b7 Translating Formulas |"

      "text": "Quick Links\nLogical functions are some of the most popular and useful in Excel. They can test values in other cells and perform actions dependent upon the result of the test. This helps us to automate tasks in our spreadsheets.\nHow to Use the IF Function\nThe IF function is the main logical function in Excel and is, therefore, the one to understand first. It will appear numerous times throughout this article.\nLet's have a look at the structure of the IF function, and then see some examples of its use.\nThe IF function accepts 3 bits of information:\n=IF(logical_test, [value_if_true], [value_if_false])\n- logical_test: This is the condition for the function to check.\n- value_if_true: The action to perform if the condition is met, or is true.\n- value_if_false: The action to perform if the condition is not met, or is false.\nComparison Operators to Use with Logical Functions\nWhen performing the logical test with cell values, you need to be familiar with the comparison operators. You can see a breakdown of these in the table below.\nNow let's look at some examples of it in action.\nIF Function Example 1: Text Values\nIn this example, we want to test if a cell is equal to a specific phrase. The IF function is not case-sensitive so does not take upper and lower case letters into account.\nThe following formula is used in column C to display \"No\" if column B contains the text \"Completed\" and \"Yes\" if it contains anything else.\n=IF(B2=\"Completed\",\"No\",\"Yes\")\nAlthough the IF function is not case sensitive, the text must be an exact match.\nIF Function Example 2: Numeric Values\nThe IF function is also great for comparing numeric values.\nIn the formula below we test if cell B2 contains a number greater than or equal to 75. If it does, then we display the word \"Pass,\" and if not the word \"Fail.\"\n=IF(B2>=75,\"Pass\",\"Fail\")\nThe IF function is a lot more than just displaying different text on the result of a test. We can also use it to run different calculations.\nIn this example, we want to give a 10% discount if the customer spends a certain amount of money. We will use \u00a33,000 as an example.\n=IF(B2>=3000,B2*90%,B2)\nThe B2*90% part of the formula is a way that you can subtract 10% from the value in cell B2. There are many ways of doing this.\nWhat's important is that you can use any formula in the value_if_true\nor value_if_false\nsections. And running different formulas dependent upon the values of other cells is a very powerful skill to have.\nIF Function Example 3: Date Values\nIn this third example, we use the IF function to track a list of due dates. We want to display the word \"Overdue\" if the date in column B is in the past. But if the date is in the future, calculate the number of days until the due date.\nThe formula below is used in column C. We check if the due date in cell B2 is less than today's date (The TODAY function returns today's date from the computer's clock).\n=IF(B2<TODAY(),\"Overdue\",B2-TODAY())\nWhat are Nested IF Formulas?\nYou may have heard of the term nested IFs before. This means that we can write an IF function within another IF function. We may want to do this if we have more than two actions to perform.\nOne IF function is capable of performing two actions (the value_if_true\nand value_if_false\n). But if we embed (or nest) another IF function in the value_if_false\nsection, then we can perform another action.\nTake this example where we want to display the word \"Excellent\" if the value in cell B2 is greater than or equal to 90, display \"Good\" if the value is greater than or equal to 75, and display \"Poor\" if anything else.\n=IF(B2>=90,\"Excellent\",IF(B2>=75,\"Good\",\"Poor\"))\nWe have now extended our formula to beyond what just one IF function can do. And you can nest more IF functions if necessary.\nNotice the two closing brackets on the end of the formula---one for each IF function.\nThere are alternative formulas that can be cleaner than this nested IF approach. One very useful alternative is the SWITCH function in Excel.\nThe AND and OR Logical Functions\nThe AND and OR functions are used when you want to perform more than one comparison in your formula. The IF function alone can only handle one condition, or comparison.\nTake an example where we discount a value by 10% dependent upon the amount a customer spends and how many years they have been a customer.\nOn their own, the AND and OR functions will return the value of TRUE or FALSE.\nThe AND function returns TRUE only if every condition is met, and otherwise returns FALSE. The OR function returns TRUE if one or all of the conditions are met, and returns FALSE only if no conditions are met.\nThese functions can test up to 255 conditions, so are certainly not limited to just two conditions like is demonstrated here.\nBelow is the structure of the AND and OR functions. They are written the same. Just substitute the name AND for OR. It is just their logic which is different.\n=AND(logical1, [logical2] ...)\nLet's see an example of both of them evaluating two conditions.\nAND Function example\nThe AND function is used below to test if the customer spends at least \u00a33,000 and has been a customer for at least three years.\n=AND(B2>=3000,C2>=3)\nYou can see that it returns FALSE for Matt and Terry because although they both meet one of the criteria, they need to meet both with the AND function.\nOR Function Example\nThe OR function is used below to test if the customer spends at least \u00a33,000 or has been a customer for at least three years.\n=OR(B2>=3000,C2>=3)\nIn this example, the formula returns TRUE for Matt and Terry. Only Julie and Gillian fail both conditions and return the value of FALSE.\nUsing AND and OR with the IF Function\nBecause the AND and OR functions return the value of TRUE or FALSE when used alone, it's rare to use them by themselves.\nInstead, you'll typically use them with the IF function, or within an Excel feature such as Conditional Formatting or Data Validation to perform some retrospective action if the formula evaluates to TRUE.\nIn the formula below, the AND function is nested inside the IF function's logical test. If the AND function returns TRUE then 10% is discounted from the amount in column B; otherwise, no discount is given and the value in column B is repeated in column D.\n=IF(AND(B2>=3000,C2>=3),B2*90%,B2)\nThe XOR Function\nIn addition to the OR function, there is also an exclusive OR function. This is called the XOR function. The XOR function was introduced with the Excel 2013 version.\nThis function can take some effort to understand, so a practical example is shown.\nThe structure of the XOR function is the same as the OR function.\n=XOR(logical1, [logical2] ...)\nWhen evaluating just two conditions the XOR function returns:\n- TRUE if either condition evaluates to TRUE.\n- FALSE if both conditions are TRUE, or neither condition is TRUE.\nThis differs from the OR function because that would return TRUE if both conditions were TRUE.\nThis function gets a little more confusing when more conditions are added. Then the XOR function returns:\n- TRUE if an odd number of conditions return TRUE.\n- FALSE if an even number of conditions result in TRUE, or if all conditions are FALSE.\nLet's look at a simple example of the XOR function.\nIn this example, sales are split over two halves of the year. If a salesperson sells \u00a33,000 or more in both halves then they are assigned Gold standard. This is achieved with an AND function with IF like earlier in the article.\nBut if they sell \u00a33,000 or more in either half then we want to assign them Silver status. If they don't sell \u00a33,000 or more in both then nothing.\nThe XOR function is perfect for this logic. The formula below is entered into column E and shows the XOR function with IF to display \"Yes\" or \"No\" only if either condition is met.\n=IF(XOR(B2>=3000,C2>=3000),\"Yes\",\"No\")\nThe NOT Function\nThe final logical function to discuss in this article is the NOT function, and we have left the simplest for last. Although sometimes it can be hard to see the 'real world' uses of the function at first.\nThe NOT function reverses the value of its argument. So if the logical value is TRUE, then it returns FALSE. And if the logical value is FALSE, it will return TRUE.\nThis will be easier to explain with some examples.\nThe structure of the NOT function is;\n=NOT(logical)\nNOT Function Example 1\nIn this example, imagine we have a head office in London and then many other regional sites. We want to display the word \"Yes\" if the site is anything except London, and \"No\" if it is London.\nThe NOT function has been nested in the logical test of the IF function below to reverse the TRUE result.\n=IF(NOT(B2=\"London\"),\"Yes\",\"No\")\nThis can also be achieved by using the NOT logical operator of <>. Below is an example.\n=IF(B2<>\"London\",\"Yes\",\"No\")\nNOT Function Example 2\nThe NOT function is useful when working with information functions in Excel. These are a group of functions in Excel that check something, and return TRUE if the check is a success, and FALSE if it is not.\nFor example, the ISTEXT function will check if a cell contains text and return TRUE if it does and FALSE if it does not. The NOT function is helpful because it can reverse the result of these functions.\nIn the example below, we want to pay a salesperson 5% of the amount they upsell. But if they did not upsell anything, the word \"None\" is in the cell and this will produce an error in the formula.\nThe ISTEXT function is used to check for the presence of text. This returns TRUE if there is text, so the NOT function reverses this to FALSE. And the IF performs its calculation.\n=IF(NOT(ISTEXT(B2)),B2*5%,0)\nMastering logical functions will give you a big advantage as an Excel user. To be able to test and compare values in cells and perform different actions based on those results is very useful.\nThis article has covered the best logical functions used today. Recent versions of Excel have seen the introduction of more functions added to this library, such as the XOR function mentioned in this article. Keeping up to date with these new additions will keep you ahead of the crowd."

      "url": "https://www.howtogeek.com/279148/how-to-automatically-fill-sequential-data-into-excel-with-the-fill-handle/",
      "text": "Quick Links\nThe Fill Handle in Excel allows you to automatically fill in a list of data (numbers or text) in a row or column simply by dragging the handle. This can save you a lot of time when entering sequential data in large worksheets and make you more productive.\nInstead of manually entering numbers, times, or even days of the week over and over again, you can use the AutoFill features (the fill handle or the Fill command on the ribbon) to fill cells if your data follows a pattern or is based on data in other cells. We\u2019ll show you how to fill various types of series of data using the AutoFill features.\nFill a Linear Series into Adjacent Cells\nOne way to use the fill handle is to enter a series of linear data into a row or column of adjacent cells. A linear series consists of numbers where the next number is obtained by adding a \"step value\" to the number before it. The simplest example of a linear series is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. However, a linear series can also be a series of decimal numbers (1.5, 2.5, 3.5\u2026), decreasing numbers by two (100, 98, 96\u2026), or even negative numbers (-1, -2, -3). In each linear series, you add (or subtract) the same step value.\nLet\u2019s say we want to create a column of sequential numbers, increasing by one in each cell. You can type the first number, press Enter to get to the next row in that column, and enter the next number, and so on. Very tedious and time consuming, especially for large amounts of data. We\u2019ll save ourselves some time (and boredom) by using the fill handle to populate the column with the linear series of numbers. To do this, type a 1 in the first cell in the column and then select that cell. Notice the green square in the lower-right corner of the selected cell? That\u2019s the fill handle.\nWhen you move your mouse over the fill handle, it turns into a black plus sign, as shown below.\nWith the black plus sign over the fill handle, click and drag the handle down the column (or right across the row) until you reach the number of cells you want to fill.\nWhen you release the mouse button, you\u2019ll notice that the value has been copied into the cells over which you dragged the fill handle.\nWhy didn\u2019t it fill the linear series (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 in our example)? By default, when you enter one number and then use the fill handle, that number is copied to the adjacent cells, not incremented.\nNOTE: To quickly copy the contents of a cell above the currently selected cell, press Ctrl+D, or to copy the contents of a cell to the left of a selected cell, press Ctrl+R. Be warned that copying data from an adjacent cell replaces any data that is currently in the selected cell.\nTo replace the copies with the linear series, click the \"Auto Fill Options\" button that displays when you\u2019re done dragging the fill handle.\nThe first option, Copy Cells, is the default. That\u2019s why we ended up with five 1s and not the linear series of 1--5. To fill the linear series, we select \u201cFill Series\u201d from the popup menu.\nThe other four 1s are replaced with 2--5 and our linear series is filled.\nYou can, however, do this without having to select Fill Series from the Auto Fill Options menu. Instead of entering just one number, enter the first two numbers in the first two cells. Then, select those two cells and drag the fill handle until you\u2019ve selected all the cells you want to fill.\nBecause you've given it two pieces of data, it will know the step value you want to use, and fill the remaining cells accordingly.\nYou can also click and drag the fill handle with the right mouse button instead of the left. You still have to select \u201cFill Series\u201d from a popup menu, but that menu automatically displays when you stop dragging and release the right mouse button, so this can be a handy shortcut.\nFill a Linear Series into Adjacent Cells Using the Fill Command\nIf you\u2019re having trouble using the fill handle, or you just prefer using commands on the ribbon, you can use the Fill command on the Home tab to fill a series into adjacent cells. The Fill command is also useful if you're filling a large number of cells, as you'll see in a bit.\nTo use the Fill command on the ribbon, enter the first value in a cell and select that cell and all the adjacent cells you want to fill (either down or up the column or to the left or right across the row). Then, click the \u201cFill\u201d button in the Editing section of the Home tab.\nSelect \u201cSeries\u201d from the drop-down menu.\nOn the Series dialog box, select whether you want the Series in Rows or Columns. In the Type box, select \u201cLinear\u201d for now. We will discuss the Growth and Date options later, and the AutoFill option simply copies the value to the other selected cells. Enter the \u201cStep value\u201d, or the increment for the linear series. For our example, we\u2019re incrementing the numbers in our series by 1. Click \u201cOK\u201d.\nThe linear series is filled in the selected cells.\nIf you have a really long column or row you want to fill with a linear series, you can use the Stop value on the Series dialog box. To do this, enter the first value in the first cell you want to use for the series in the row or column, and click \u201cFill\u201d on the Home tab again. In addition to the options we discussed above, enter the value into the \u201cStop value\u201d box that you want as the last value in the series. Then, click \u201cOK\u201d.\nIn the following example, we put a 1 in the first cell of the first column and the numbers 2 through 20 will be entered automatically into the next 19 cells.\nFill a Linear Series While Skipping Rows\nTo make a full worksheet more readable, we sometimes skip rows, putting blank rows in between the rows of data. Even though there are blank rows, you can still use the fill handle to fill a linear series with blank rows.\nTo skip a row when filling a linear series, enter the first number in the first cell and then select that cell and one adjacent cell (for example, the next cell down in the column).\nThen, drag the fill handle down (or across) until you fill the desired number of cells.\nWhen you\u2019re finished dragging the fill handle, you will see your linear series fills every other row.\nIf you want to skip more than one row, simply select the cell containing the first value and then select the number of rows you want to skip right after that cell. Then, drag the fill handle over the cells you want to fill.\nYou can also skip columns when you are filling across rows.\nFill Formulas into Adjacent Cells\nYou can also use the fill handle to propagate formulas to adjacent cells. Simply select the cell containing the formula you want to fill into adjacent cells and drag the fill handle down the cells in the column or across the cells in the row that you want to fill. The formula is copied to the other cells. If you used relative cell references, they will change accordingly to refer to the cells in their respective rows (or columns).\nYou can also fill formulas using the Fill command on the ribbon. Simply select the cell containing the formula and the cells you want to fill with that formula. Then, click \u201cFill\u201d in the Editing section of the Home tab and select Down, Right, Up, or Left, depending on which direction you want to fill the cells.\nNOTE: The copied formulas will not recalculate, unless you have automatic workbook calculation enabled.\nYou can also use the keyboard shortcuts Ctrl+D and Ctrl+R, as discussed earlier, to copy formulas to adjacent cells.\nFill a Linear Series by Double Clicking on the Fill Handle\nYou can quickly fill a linear series of data into a column by double clicking the fill handle. When using this method, Excel only fills the cells in the column based on the longest adjacent column of data on your worksheet. An adjacent column in this context is any column that Excel encounters to the right or left of the column being filled, until a blank column is reached. If the columns directly on either side of the selected column are blank, you cannot use the double click method to fill the cells in the column. Also, by default, if some of the cells in the range of cells you\u2019re filling already have data, only the empty cells above the first cell containing data are filled. For example, in the image below, there's a value in cell G7 so when you double click on the fill handle on cell G2, the formula is only copied down through cell G6.\nFill a Growth Series (Geometric Pattern)\nUp until now, we\u2019ve been discussing filling linear series, where each number in the series is calculated by adding the step value to the previous number. In a growth series, or geometric pattern, the next number is calculated by multiplying the previous number by the step value.\nThere are two ways to fill a growth series, by entering the first two numbers and by entering the first number and the step value.\nMethod One: Enter the First Two Numbers in the Growth Series\nTo fill a growth series using the first two numbers, enter the two numbers into the first two cells of the row or column you want to fill. Right-click and drag the fill handle over as many cells as you want to fill. When you\u2019re finished dragging the fill handle over the cells you want to fill, select \u201cGrowth Trend\u201d from the popup menu that automatically displays.\nNOTE: For this method, you must enter two numbers. If you don\u2019t, the Growth Trend option will be grayed out.\nExcel knows that the step value is 2 from the two numbers we entered in the first two cells. So, every subsequent number is calculated by multiplying the previous number by 2.\nWhat if you want to start at a number other than 1 using this method? For example, if you wanted to start the above series at 2, you would enter 2 and 4 (because 2x2=4) in the first two cells. Excel would figure out that the step value is 2 and continue the growth series from 4 multiplying each subsequent number by 2 to get the next one in line.\nMethod Two: Enter the First Number in the Growth Series and Specify the Step Value\nTo fill a growth series based on one number and a step value, enter the first number (it doesn\u2019t have to be 1) in the first cell and drag the fill handle over the cells you want to fill. Then, select \u201cSeries\u201d from the popup menu that automatically displays.\nOn the Series dialog box, select whether your filling the Series in Rows or Columns. Under Type, select :\u201dGrowth\u201d. In the \u201cStep value\u201d box, enter the value you want to multiply each number by to get the next value. In our example, we want to multiply each number by 3. Click \u201cOK\u201d.\nThe growth series is filled in the selected cells, each subsequent number being three times the previous number.\nFill a Series Using Built-in Items\nSo far, we\u2019ve covered how to fill a series of numbers, both linear and growth. You can also fill series with items such as dates, days of the week, weekdays, months, or years using the fill handle. Excel has several built-in series that it can automatically fill.\nThe following image shows some of the series that are built in to Excel, extended across the rows. The items in bold and red are the initial values we entered and the rest of the items in each row are the extended series values. These built-in series can be filled using the fill handle, as we previously described for linear and growth series. Simply enter the initial values and select them. Then, drag the fill handle over the desired cells you want to fill.\nFill a Series of Dates Using the Fill Command\nWhen filling a series of dates, you can use the Fill command on the ribbon to specify the increment to use. Enter the first date in your series in a cell and select that cell and the cells you want to fill. In the Editing section of the Home tab, click \u201cFill\u201d and then select \u201cSeries\u201d.\nOn the Series dialog box, the Series in option is automatically selected to match the set of cells you selected. The Type is also automatically set to Date. To specify the increment to use when filling the series, select the Date unit (Day, Weekday, Month, or Year). Specify the Step value. We want to fill the series with every weekday date, so we enter 1 as the Step value. Click \u201cOK\u201d.\nThe series is populated with dates that are only weekdays.\nFill a Series Using Custom Items\nYou can also fill a series with your own custom items. Say your company has offices in six different cities and you use those city names often in your Excel worksheets. You can add that list of cities as a custom list that will allow you to use the fill handle to fill the series once you enter the first item. To create a custom list, click the \u201cFile\u201d tab.\nOn the backstage screen, click \u201cOptions\u201d in the list of items on the left.\nClick \u201cAdvanced\u201d in the list of items on the left side of the Excel Options dialog box.\nIn the right panel, scroll down to the General section and click the \u201cEdit Custom Lists\u201d button.\nOnce you're on the Custom Lists dialog box, there are two ways to fill a series of custom items. You can base the series on a new list of items you create directly on the Custom Lists dialog box, or on an existing list already on a worksheet in your current workbook. We will show you both methods.\nMethod One: Fill a Custom Series Based on a New List of Items\nOn the Custom Lists dialog box, make sure NEW LIST is selected in the Custom lists box. Click in the \u201cList entries\u201d box and enter the items in your custom lists, one item to a line. Be sure to enter the items in the order you want them filled into cells. Then, click \u201cAdd\u201d.\nThe custom list is added to the Custom lists box, where you can select it so you can edit it by adding or removing items from the List entries box and clicking \u201cAdd\u201d again, or you can delete the list by clicking \u201cDelete\u201d. Click \u201cOK\u201d.\nClick \u201cOK\u201d on the Excel Options dialog box.\nNow, you can type the first item in your custom list, select the cell containing the item and drag the fill handle over the cells you want to fill with the list. Your custom list is automatically filled into the cells.\nMethod Two: Fill a Custom Series Based on an Existing List of Items\nMaybe you store your custom list on a separate worksheet in your workbook. You can import your list from the worksheet into the Custom Lists dialog box. To create a custom list based on an existing list on a worksheet, open the Custom Lists dialog box and make sure NEW LIST is selected in the Custom lists box, just like in the first method. However, for this method, click the cell range button to the right of the \u201cImport list from cells\u201d box.\nSelect the tab for the worksheet that contains your custom list at the bottom of the Excel window. Then, select the cells containing the items in your list. The name of the worksheet and the cell range are automatically entered into the Custom Lists edit box.

      "text": "Quick Links\nAnalysis of business data often requires working with date values in Excel to answer questions such as \"how much money did we make today\" or \"how does this compare to the same day last week?\" And that can be hard when Excel doesn't recognize the values as dates.\nUnfortunately, this is not unusual, especially when multiple users are typing this information, copying and pasting from other systems and importing from databases.\nIn this article, we will describe four different scenarios and the solutions to convert the text to date values.\nDates that Contain a Full Stop/Period\nProbably one of the most common mistakes beginners make when typing dates into Excel is doing so with the full stop character to separate the day, month, and year.\nExcel will not recognize this as a date value and will go ahead and store it as text. However, you can solve this problem with the Find and Replace tool. By replacing the full stops with slashes (/), Excel will automatically identify the values as dates.\nSelect the columns on which you want to perform the find and replace.\nClick Home > Find & Select > Replace---or press Ctrl+H.\nIn the Find and Replace window, type a full stop (.) in the \"Find what\" field and a slash (/) in the \"Replace with\" field. Then, click \"Replace All.\"\nAll full stops are converted to slashes and Excel recognizes the new format as a date.\nIf your spreadsheet data is regularly changing, and you want an automated solution for this scenario, you could use the SUBSTITUTE function.\n=VALUE(SUBSTITUTE(A2,\".\",\"/\"))\nThe SUBSTITUTE function is a text function, so cannot convert it to a date on its own. The VALUE function will convert the text value to a numeric value.\nThe results are shown below. The value needs to be formatted as a date.\nYou can do this using the \"Number Format\" list on the \"Home\" tab.\nThe example here of a full stop delimiter is typical. But you can use the same technique to replace or substitute any delimiter character.\nConverting the yyyymmdd Format\nIf you receive dates in the format shown below, it will require a different approach.\nThis format is quite standard in technology as it removes any ambiguity about how different countries store their date values. However, Excel will not initially understand it.\nFor a quick manual solution, you could use Text to Columns.\nSelect the range of values you need to convert and then click Data > Text to Columns.\nThe Text to Columns wizard appears. Click \"Next\" on the first two steps so that you are at step three, as shown in the image below. Choose Date and then select the date format being used in the cells from the list. In this example, we are dealing with a YMD format.\nIf you would like a formula solution, then you could use the Date function to construct the date.\nThis would be used alongside the text functions Left, Mid and Right to extract the three parts of a date (day, month, year) from the cell contents.\nThe formula below shows this formula using our sample data.\n=DATE(LEFT(A2,4),MID(A2,5,2),RIGHT(A2,2))\nUsing either of these techniques, you can convert any eight-digit number value. For example, you might receive the date in a ddmmyyyy format or a mmddyyyy format.\nDATEVALUE and VALUE Functions\nSometimes the problem is not caused by a delimiter character but has an awkward date structure simply because it is stored as text.\nBelow is a list of dates in a variety of structures, but they are all recognizable to us as a date. Unfortunately, they have been stored as text and need converting.\nFor these scenarios, it is easy to convert using a variety of techniques.\nFor this article, I wanted to mention two functions to handle these scenarios. They are DATEVALUE and VALUE.\nThe DATEVALUE function will convert text into a date value (probably saw that coming), while the VALUE function will convert text into a generic number value. The differences between them are minimal.\nIn the image above, one of the values contains time information as well. And that will be a demonstration of the functions' minor differences.\nThe DATEVALUE formula below would convert each one to a date value.\n=DATEVALUE(A2)\nNotice how the time was removed from the result in row 4. This formula strictly returns just the date value. The result will still need to be formatted as a date.\nThe following formula uses the VALUE function.\n=VALUE(A2)\nThis formula will produce the same results except for in row 4, where the time value is also maintained.\nThe results can then be formatted as date and time, or as a date to hide the time value (but not remove)."

      "text": "Quick Links\nSummary\nThe IF function returns different values depending on whether a condition is true or false. Use it in the form =IF(Condition,True,False). For example, =IF(C2>=60,\"Pass\",\"Fail\") will return \"Pass\" if the value in C2 is equal to or over 60 and \"Fail\" if the value is under 60.\nWhether you're grading exams or simply trying to make sense of a spreadsheet full of data, Microsoft Excel's IF\nfunction can help. You can also use an IF\nfunction inside of another IF\nfunction to run deeper tests, too. We'll show you how.\nWhat Can You Do with Excel's IF Function?\nPut simply, you can use the IF\nfunction to retrieve a pre-specified result based on whether the function gets a TRUE or FALSE value.\nFor example, if you have a score sheet, you can make it so your cells say\nPASS\nif someone has scored 60 or higher, or say\nFAIL\nif the score is 59 or lower. You can use a nested IF\nto even assign grades, like an\nA\nfor someone with a score of 90 or higher.\nHow to Write an IF Statement in Excel\nTo write an IF\nstatement in Excel, all you have to do is type the function and specify what results to retrieve when the condition is TRUE and FALSE.\nStart by launching your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel. Then, click the cell in which you want to use the function.\nIn the following example, we'll use the IF\nfunction to say\nPass\nif the obtained score is 60 or higher and\nFail\nif the score is 59 or lower.\nWe'll select the D2 cell where we want to display the result.\nIn the D2 cell, we'll enter the following function and press Enter.\n=IF(C2>=60,\"Pass\",\"Fail\")\nIn the selected cell, you'll see the result depending on the value in the C2 cell.\nTo copy the function for all your records, from the bottom-right corner of the D2 cell, drag downwards to cover all your records.\nAnd that's it.\nModify the IF\nfunction in whatever way you want and you'll get the desired result.\nUse the Nested IF Function in Excel\nA nested IF\nis an IF\nfunction inside of another IF\nfunction. You use this when you want to run another logical test after the first one.\nWe'll use the following dataset to demonstrate this function:\nIn this dataset, depending on the scores, the following results will be displayed:\n- If the score is 90 or higher: A\n- If the score is between 80 and 89: B\n- If the score is between 70 and 79: C\n- If the score is between 60 and 69: D\n- If the score is between 0 and 59: F\nWe'll select the D2 cell where we want to display the result, and then enter the following nested IF\nfunction and press Enter:\n=IF(C2>=90,\"A\",IF(C2>=80,\"B\",IF(C2>=70,\"C\",IF(C2>=60,\"D\",IF(C2>=0,\"F\")))))\nYou'll see the result in your selected cell.\nYou can copy the function for all your records by dragging downwards from the D2 cell's bottom-right corner.\nAnd you're set.\nExcel's IF\nfunction is an excellent way to run various logical tests. You can use it to specify multiple conditions and display the results accordingly.\nWhile you're at it, check out other Excel logical functions that can be useful in your work.\n|\nMastering Excel Functions |\n||\n|\nFunctions |\nAVERAGE \u00b7 CONCATENATE \u00b7 COUNT \u00b7 COUNTIF \u00b7 DATEDIF \u00b7 FILTER \u00b7 FREQUENCY \u00b7 FV \u00b7 HYPERLINK \u00b7 IF \u00b7 IFS \u00b7 IMAGE \u00b7 INDEX \u00b7 IS \u00b7 LEN \u00b7 MATCH \u00b7 MEDIAN \u00b7 RAND \u00b7 ROUND \u00b7 RRI \u00b7 SORT \u00b7 SQRT \u00b7 SUBSTITUTE \u00b7 SUBTOTAL \u00b7 SUM \u00b7 SUMIF \u00b7 TODAY \u00b7 TRIM \u00b7 TRUNC \u00b7 VLOOKUP \u00b7 WEEKDAY \u00b7 XLOOKUP \u00b7 YEAR |\n|\n|\nTypes |\nBasic \u00b7 Budgeting \u00b7 Data Entry \u00b7 Logical \u00b7 Text \u00b7 Time and Date |\n|\n|\nExplained |\nCopying Formulas \u00b7 Evaluating Formulas \u00b7 Finding Functions \u00b7 Fixing Formula Errors \u00b7 Functions vs Formulas \u00b7 Comparing Lookup Functions \u00b7 Locking Formulas \u00b7 Structuring Formulas \u00b7 Translating Formulas |"

      "text": "Excel's AVERAGEIF and AVERAGEIF functions let you find the average of a set of data. However, where they differ from the more straightforward AVERAGE function is in their ability to include or discount certain values within the calculation.\nHow to Use AVERAGEIF in Excel\nExcel's AVERAGEIF function allows you to calculate the mean of a dataset that has been filtered based on a single condition you set.\nThe AVERAGEIF Syntax\nThe AVERAGEIF function has three arguments:\n=AVERAGEIF(x,y,z)\nwhere\n- x (required) is the range of cells to test against the criteria,\n- y (required) is the criterion (the test for argument x), and\n- z (optional) is the range of cells to average if the test in argument y is met. If you leave z out, Excel will average the values identified in argument x.\nAVERAGEIF in Action\nLet's jump straight in and see how the AVERAGEIF function works in a real-world example.\nLet's suppose you have this Excel table containing 12 people's names, ages, and salaries, and you've been asked to calculate the average salaries of people aged over 40.\nIn this case, thinking back to the syntax above, column B contains the values you want to test (argument x), more than 40 is the criterion (argument y) for the values in column B, and column C contains the values you want to average (argument z).\nSo, in a separate cell, you need to type:\n=AVERAGEIF(Table1[Age],\">40\",Table1[Salary])\nand press Enter.\nLet's take a moment to break this formula down.\nThe first thing you'll notice is the use of structured references for arguments x and z. In other words, rather than using direct cell references (such as B2:B13 for argument x and C2:C13 for argument z), the formula references the column headers. This is because the data is contained within a formatted Excel table, and the program defaults to using the table headers in formulas. This means that if you add extra rows to the bottom of your data, the formula will automatically include those new values.\nSecond, argument y is contained within double quotations. Any time you use logical operators in Excel formulas\u2014like equal to, greater than, or less than\u2014they must be placed within double quotations.\nThings to Note When Using AVERAGEIF\nBefore you go ahead and use AVERAGEIF in your own spreadsheet, there are some important points you should be aware of.\nFirst, argument y (the test) is very flexible. While the example above uses \">40\" (a logical operator) to test the range in argument x, there are various other types of criteria you could use instead:\n|\nCriterion Type |\nExample Formula |\nWhat This Would Calculate |\n|---|---|---|\n|\nValue |\n=AVERAGEIF(Table1[Age],44,Table1[Salary]) |\nThe average salary of individuals aged 44 |\n|\nText |\n=AVERAGEIF(Table1[Person],\"Jenny\",Table1[Salary]) |\nThe average salary of people whose name is Jenny |\n|\nWildcard |\n=AVERAGEIF(Table1[Person],\"Jo*\",Table1[Salary]) |\nThe average salary of anyone whose name starts with Jo- |\n|\nCell reference |\n=AVERAGEIF(Table1[Age],B15,Table1[Salary]) |\nThe average salary of anyone matching the age criterion in cell B15 |\n|\nCombinations of the above |\n=AVERAGEIF(Table1[Person],\"Ja*\",Table1[Salary]) |\nThe average salary of anyone whose name doesn't start with Ja- |\nSecond, the AVERAGEIF function doesn't consider empty cells. For example, if someone's salary value was blank, it would be ignored in the average calculation. However, if someone's salary was $0, this would be included in the average calculation.\nFinally, if none of the specified cells meets the test, Excel returns the #DIV/0! error to tell you that it can't calculate the average.\nHow to Use AVERAGEIFS in Excel\nWhere AVERAGEIF tests one condition before calculating the average of all values that meet the test, AVERAGEIFS allows you to narrow your results even further by using several criteria.\nThe AVERAGEIFS Syntax\nIt's important to note that the order and number of arguments in the AVERAGEIFS function differs significantly from the AVERAGEIF function:\n=AVERAGEIFS(x,y\u00b9,y\u00b2,z\u00b9,z\u00b2,...)\nwhere\n- x (required) is the range of cells containing the values to be averaged,\n- y\u00b9 (required) is the range of cells containing the first values to be tested,\n- y\u00b2 (required) is the test for y\u00b9,\n- z\u00b9 (optional) is the range of cells containing the second values to be tested, and\n- z\u00b2 (required if z\u00b9 is included) is the test for z\u00b9.\nIn other words, the syntax above represents the AVERAGEIFS function being used to create two tests (y and z), though you can include up to 127 tests overall.\nAVERAGEIFS in Action\nIf the AVERAGEIFS syntax confuses you, things will become much clearer when you see how the function works in an example.\nThis Excel table contains people's names, ages, genders, and salaries, and your aim is to work out the average salary of all males over the age of 35.\nSince there are two criteria (age and gender), you need to use the AVERAGEIFS function:\n=AVERAGEIFS(Table2[Salary],Table2[Age],\">35\",Table2[Gender],\"M\")\nwhere\n- Table2[Salary] is the range of cells containing the values to be averaged (argument x),\n- Table2[Age] is the range of cells containing the first set of values to be tested (argument y\u00b9),\n- \">35\" is the test for the first range (argument y\u00b2),\n- Table2[Gender] is the range of cells containing the second set of values to be tested (argument z\u00b9), and\n- \"M\" is the test for the second range (argument z\u00b2).\nThings to Note When Using AVERAGEIFS\nHere are some things to remember when using the AVERAGEIFS function:\n- The tests can be logical arguments, values, text, cell references, or a combination of these.\n- Logical arguments and text must always be enclosed in double quotations.\n- Only cells that meet all conditions will be included in the average calculation.\n- All ranges specified in an AVERAGEIFS formula must be the same size.\n- The AVERAGEIFS function discounts empty cells but includes cells with a value of zero.\n- The #DIV/0! error will be returned if no cells meet all the criteria.\nAVERAGEIF and AVERAGEIFS aren't the only functions in Excel that calculate the average of a dataset. For example, the AVERAGE function produces a straightforward arithmetic mean of a set of data, and the AVERAGEA function returns the mean of a set of numbers, text, and logical arguments."

      "text": "Quick Links\nIn Microsoft Excel,\nCOUNTIF\nis one of the most widely used formulas. It counts all cells in a range that matches a single condition or multiple conditions, and it's equally useful in counting cells with numbers and text in them.\nWhat Is the COUNTIF function?\nCOUNTIF\nallows users to count the number of cells that meet certain criteria, such as the number of times a part of a word or specific words appears on a list. In the actual formula, you'll tell Excel where it needs to look and what it needs to look for. It counts cells in a range that meets single or multiple conditions, as we'll demonstrate below.\nHow to Use the COUNTIF Formula in Microsoft Excel\nFor this tutorial, we will use simple two-column inventory chart logging school supplies and their quantities.\nIn an empty cell, type\n=COUNTIF\nfollowed by an open bracket. The first argument \"range\" asks for the range of cells you would like to check. The second argument \"criteria\" asks for what exactly you want Excel to count. This is usually a text string. So, in double-quotes, add the string you want to find. Be sure to add the closing quotemark and the closing bracket.\nSo in our example, we want to count the number of times \"Pens\" appears in our inventory, which includes the range\nG9:G15\n. We'll use the following formula.\n=COUNTIF(G9:G15,\"Pens\")\nYou can also count the number of times a specific number appears by putting the number in the criteria argument without quotes. Or you can use operators with numbers inside of quotes to determine results, like \"<100\"\nto get a count of all numbers less than 100.\nHow to Count the Number of Multiple Values\nTo count the number of multiple values (e.g. the total of pens and erasers in our inventory chart), you may use the following formula.\n=COUNTIF(G9:G15, \"Pens\")+COUNTIF(G9:G15, \"Erasers\")\nThis counts the number of erasers and pens. Note, this formula uses COUNTIF twice since there are multiple criteria being used, with one criterion per expression.\nLimitations of the COUNTIF Formula\nIf your COUNTIF formula uses criteria matched to a string longer than 255 characters, it will return an error. To fix this, use the CONCATENATE function to match strings longer than 255 characters. You can avoid typing out the full function by simply using an ampersand (&), as demonstrated below.\n=COUNTIF(A2:A5,\"long string\"&\"another long string\")\nOne behavior of COUNTIF functions to be aware of is that it disregards upper and lower case strings. Criteria that include a lower case string (e.g. \"erasers\") and an upper case string (e.g. \"ERASERS\") will match the same cells and return the same value.\nAnother behavior of COUNTIF functions involves the use of wildcard characters. Using an asterisk in COUNTIF criteria will match any sequence of characters. For example, =COUNTIF(A2:A5, \"*eraser*\")\nwill count all cells in a range that contain the word \"eraser.\"\nWhen you're counting values in a range, you may be interested in highlighting the top- or bottom-ranked values.\n|\nMastering Excel Functions |\n||\n|\nFunctions |\nAVERAGE \u00b7 CONCATENATE \u00b7 COUNT \u00b7 COUNTIF \u00b7 DATEDIF \u00b7 FILTER \u00b7 FREQUENCY \u00b7 FV \u00b7 HYPERLINK \u00b7 IF \u00b7 IFS \u00b7 IMAGE \u00b7 INDEX \u00b7 IS \u00b7 LEN \u00b7 MATCH \u00b7MEDIAN \u00b7 RAND \u00b7 ROUND \u00b7 RRI \u00b7 SORT \u00b7 SQRT \u00b7 SUBSTITUTE \u00b7 SUBTOTAL \u00b7 SUM \u00b7 SUMIF \u00b7 TODAY \u00b7 TRIM \u00b7 TRUNC \u00b7 VLOOKUP \u00b7 WEEKDAY \u00b7 XLOOKUP \u00b7 YEAR |\n|\n|\nTypes |\nBasic \u00b7 Budgeting \u00b7 Data Entry \u00b7 Logical \u00b7 Text \u00b7 Time and Date |\n|\n|\nExplained |\nCopying Formulas \u00b7 Evaluating Formulas \u00b7 Finding Functions \u00b7 Fixing Formula Errors \u00b7 Functions vs Formulas \u00b7 Comparing Lookup Functions \u00b7 Locking Formulas \u00b7 Structuring Formulas \u00b7 Translating Formulas |"

      "text": "Quick Links\nUsing Excel's number format tool means you can ensure your spreadsheet both looks the part and handles your data exactly how you want it to. In this article, I'll explain what each number format is, how to use it, and how it affects your data.\nThings to Know Before You Start\nEach cell has its own number format, which you can see by selecting a cell and seeing the Number group in the Home tab on the ribbon.\nFor some data types, such as a date or a percentage, Excel will change a cell's number format automatically as soon as you type it into a cell. Otherwise, there are various ways to change a number format manually. First, expand the drop-down menu in the Number group of the Home tab, and select the option that best suits the data in the active cell.\nAnother way to change a number format is by clicking one of the icon shortcuts in the same group\u2014Accounting, Percentage, or a number with a comma to separate the thousands.\nAlternatively, for more options, you can launch the Format Cells dialog box by clicking the icon in the bottom right corner of the Number group or pressing Ctrl+1.\nProviding there is already some data in the active cell, the Number Format dialog box shows you a preview of how each number format will affect your data if selected.\nGeneral\nEvery cell in a new workbook has the General number format by default. Since Excel's primary function is to handle numerical data, the General number format displays numbers exactly as they are typed without any formatting.\nOne exception to this rule is if you type a decimalized number that doesn't fit into the cell's width. In this case, Excel's General number format will round the number to the nearest value the cell's width will allow.\nThe General number format also converts lengthy numbers to scientific\u2014or exponential\u2014values (more on this later).\nNumber\nEven though the General number format supports numerical values in Excel, the Number number format gives you more flexibility with how numbers are displayed.\nBy selecting the relevant cell or cells and pressing Ctrl+1, you can define:\n- The number of decimal places (the default is two),\n- Whether you want to use a comma in numbers that are 1,000 or greater (deactivated by default), and\n- How negative values are displayed.\nCurrency\nThere are two ways to format monetary values in Excel, the first being the Currency number format. Choose this number format instead of the Accounting number format if you want to choose how the value is aligned in the cell and how negative values are displayed.\nMore specifically, the Currency number format lets you:\n- Choose the number of decimal places (you can choose as many as you like, but zero or two decimal places tend to be the preferred options for monetary values),\n- Decide which currency symbol to display, and\n- Choose how negative values appear in your spreadsheet.\nAccounting\nThe second way to format financial values is by using the Accounting number format. This is preferable for large and formal accounting spreadsheets, as it aligns the currency symbol and decimal place in each cell, making reading and comparing values in nearby cells more straightforward.\nSimilar to when you use the Currency number format, you can choose how many decimal places to display and which currency symbol to use.\nHowever, unlike the Currency number format, the Accounting number format doesn't give you alternative ways to display negative values.\nRemember, you can quickly choose the Accounting number format by clicking the dollar bill symbol in the Number group of the Home tab.\nDate\nSince different countries have different ways to display dates, the key to using the Date number format is first choosing the correct locale. The region should default to your system's settings, but it's always a good starting point to make sure it aligns with your expectations.\nTo do this, select the cell or cells where you want the date to go, and press Ctrl+1. Then, click \"Date\" in the category menu on the left, and click the \"Locale\" drop-down menu to choose the correct region. You'll then see the different Date number format options from which to choose.\nAll Date number formats containing an asterisk (*) change automatically if the spreadsheet is shared with someone in a different region. Those without an asterisk don't have this adaptability.\nTime\nAs with the Date number format, make sure you select the correct locale in the Number tab of the Format Cells dialog box (Ctrl+1). Then, choose a time type. All times displayed with asterisks (*) change according to regional operating time settings.\nPercentage\nExcel's Percentage number format multiplies the cell value by 100 and displays the % symbol. So, for example, if you apply the Percentage number format to a cell containing 0.54, the cell will display 54%.\nBy default, Excel displays percentages as integers (whole numbers with no decimal places), meaning if you type 0.549, the cell will display 55%.\nYou can increase or decrease the number of decimal places either by clicking the decimalization icons in the Number group of the Home tab on the ribbon (see number 1 in the screenshot below) or pressing Ctrl+1 and using the spin button next to the Decimal Places option (see number 2 in the screenshot below).\nRemember, you can quickly choose the Percentage number format by clicking the \"%\" symbol in the Number group of the Home tab.\nFraction\nAs its name suggests, the Fraction number format displays a number as a fraction. In this example, 0.75 converts to \u00be.\nWhen you press Ctrl+1 to open the Format Cells dialog box, the various options in the Type list let you choose the number of digits in the fraction's numerator and denominator, and you can also round the fraction to the nearest half, quarter, eighth, or sixteenth if you so wish.\nScientific\nThe Scientific number format displays a number in exponential notation. It is typically used in formal scientific or mathematical papers, as not everyone will understand what the numbers and letters represent.\nIn the example below, 987,654,321 is displayed as 9.88E+08, where\n- 9.88 is the base number (rounded to two decimal places by default),\n- E indicates that the number displayed is an exponent, and\n- +08 means that the base number needs to be multiplied by 10 eight times.\nTo change the number of decimal places, press Ctrl+1, and use the spin button where you see the words \"Decimal Places.\"\nText\nThe Text number format displays exactly what you type into a cell, even if it's a number or a formula.\nThis number format is great when you want to use and display extra long numbers (like credit card or mobile phone numbers), because it stops Excel from rounding them or turning them into exponents.\nIf you later decide you want to use the values in Text-formatted cells in calculations, you'll need to convert them to Number or General formats by selecting the relevant cells, pressing Ctrl+1, and choosing the appropriate number format.\nSpecial\nThe Special number format lets you add unique numbers, like phone numbers, social security numbers, and zip codes, with pre-defined structures.\nThe use of this number format is limited to people entering data for a select group of nations. For example, after pressing Ctrl+1 and selecting \"Special\" in the left-hand menu, select \"English (United States)\" in the \"Locale\" drop-down menu to see various number formats available for that country.\nOn the other hand, if you select \"English (United Kingdom),\" you'll see that Excel doesn't offer any Special number formats for this nation.\nIf a Special number format for your region is not supported, use the Custom number format instead (see below).\nCustom\nThe Custom number format offers a list of codes that you can either use as they are or adjust to create a customized number format.\nFor example, I want to add the letter H to a list of numbers in a spreadsheet. To do this, I will select all the cells containing the numbers I want to affect, and press Ctrl+1 to open the Format Cells dialog box. Then, I will click \"Custom\" in the left-hand menu.\nNow, I will select the \"0\" Custom number type, and type \"H\" after the 0, before pressing \"OK.\"\nNow, all my numbers are followed by the letter H.\nIf a cell displays a series of hashtags (#####) rather than the value you typed, this is likely either because the column width is too narrow to fully display the contents, or the number formatting you have applied does not match the value you have typed. To rectify this issue, first try widening the column, and if this doesn't work, change the cell's number format to match the type of data it contains."
