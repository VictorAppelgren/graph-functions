      "text": "A Minnesota lawmaker is asking Gov. Tim Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison to grant more pardons to potentially protect some Southeast Asians facing deportation after five Hmong men under federal detention were flown from Minnesota to Louisiana last week.\nRep. Kaohly Vang Her, DFL-St. Paul, said at a rally last Sunday that she had spoken to Walz and Ellison and they said they would consider her request. They also warned, however, that there was a backlog of requests for pardons, she said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really challenging. \u2026 There has been roadblock after roadblock, and I am to a point now where I\u2019m like \u2018This is it,\u2019\u201d Her said, referring to the legal system. \u201cIt\u2019s on all of us. This is the time to stand up for each other.\u201d\nWalz could not be immediately reached for comment. Ellison\u2019s office said he was unavailable to comment.\nHer was among about 100 people who rallied at the East Side Freedom Library in St. Paul to protest the deportation of Southeast Asian Minnesotans, particularly many Hmong men who were arrested this year under President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies.\nState Rep. Liz Lee, DFL-St. Paul, encouraged people to unite and organize more events like the rally.\n\u201cI feel like we are maybe at a dead end,\u201d Lee said, referring to the immigration system. \u201cThe most important thing we have is our people power, because change will not happen without people being courageous, like all of you.\u201d\nMinnesota 8, a local Southeast Asian immigrant-led advocacy and anti-deportation organization, organized the rally and news conference. Executive Director Montha Chum said that 32 U.S. deportees were sent to Laos this month. The five Hmong men from Minnesota were initially expected to be on that flight, but missed it, Chum said, and are awaiting the next flight to Laos."

      "text": "Two Christian colleges that require incoming students to sign faith statements can\u2019t be barred from a popular Minnesota program that allows high school students to take college classes for free, according to a ruling issued Friday by a Minneapolis federal judge.\nIn her ruling, U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel found that a 2023 law aimed at addressing complaints involving alleged discrimination at the colleges was unconstitutional because it unfairly restricted the religious freedom of high school students who wanted to attend the Christian schools.\n\u201cThis dispute requires the court to venture into the delicate constitutional interplay of religion and publicly-funded education,\u201d Brasel said in her 70-page ruling. \u201cIn doing so, the court heeds the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction that the First Amendment gives special solicitude to the rights of religious organizations.\u201d\nBrasel noted that the two schools \u2014 Crown College in St. Bonifacius and the University of Northwestern-St. Paul in Roseville \u2014 have together received a total of nearly $40 million since the 2017-18 school year to cover the costs of participating in Minnesota\u2019s Postsecondary Enrollment Options (PSEO) program. Northwestern has been the leading provider of PSEO credits in the state, Brasel said in her ruling.\nThe two institutions require their students to pledge to follow the school\u2019s values and conduct rules, effectively barring from campus activities those students who aren\u2019t Christian or who are LGBTQ. The faith statements also include pledges to refrain from sex outside of marriage.\nThe case was filed on behalf of two Minnesota families whose children wanted to participate in the PSEO program at the two schools but felt pressured by the new law to attend different colleges. The ban was suspended after the lawsuit was filed in 2023.\n\u201cMinnesota tried to cut off educational opportunities to thousands of high schoolers simply for their faith. That\u2019s not just unlawful \u2014 it\u2019s shameful,\u201c said Diana Thompson, senior attorney at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that led the legal fight on behalf of the families. \u201dThis ruling is a win for families who won\u2019t be strong-armed into abandoning their beliefs, and a sharp warning to politicians who target them.\"\nOfficials with the Minnesota Department of Education, which spent years advocating on behalf of the ban, said no decision has been made on whether to appeal."

      "text": "In a city where art and industry have long worked side by side, a new kind of workshop is taking shape: a 22,000-square-foot makerspace aimed at becoming an incubator for budding entrepreneurs and weekend woodworkers.\nThe Winona Creators Collective, a nonprofit founded earlier this year, is in the final stages of securing a lease for the former Technigraph manufacturing facility on the city\u2019s west side. Once the space opens in late 2025, the group plans to offer a membership model allowing for 24/7 access to dedicated areas for activities like woodworking, pottery and glassmaking.\nLike other makerspaces in Minnesota, the Winona facility will be entirely reliant on volunteers and donations. The group is now working to raise as much as $250,000 to support building improvements and the purchase of new tools and equipment, from handsaws to laser cutters.\nMark Zocher, president of the collective, said while some of the members may be hobbyists wanting to take up a new craft, this space is also intended to serve as a catalyst for new businesses \u2015 from Etsy creators selling pottery to aspiring inventors working on a prototype.\nThe idea is that by pooling resources, the makerspace will be able to afford the kinds of equipment that would otherwise be out of reach for entrepreneurs who are just starting out, Zocher said.\n\u201cMaybe they just don\u2019t have the space or it\u2019s just a little bit too much money to get started,\u201d he said. \u201cA space like this will help entrepreneurs test out what a business could be before they grow it.\u201d\nWhile Winona\u2019s plans call for creating what would become the biggest makerspace in Minnesota, the concept of a collaborative workspace has been around for years in other small cities, including Mankato and Hibbing, both of which Zocher said are serving as models for the Winona space.\nCindy Bourne, board director of Mankato Makerspace, said shared woodworking and ceramics spaces are now the most-used areas, with some members running close to full-time businesses out of the space."

The officials said the strikes targeted tents sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis.\n''Awad, why did you leave me?'' a small boy asked his brother's plastic-wrapped body.\nAnother grieving relative, Hekmat Foujo, pleaded for a truce."

      "text": "The president is not going to make Minnesota\u2019s economy great again.\nMinnesotans need to do it by confronting the truth of what\u2019s happening in the state and by becoming more ambitious for themselves.\nI often write about the challenge Minnesota faces maintaining economic growth when its population is increasing more slowly than ever. When I do, I\u2019ll usually hear from a reader or two wishing that I put forward more ideas for making growth happen.\nOne answer for that came during the meeting on Aug. 13 that drew more than 300 Twin Cities business leaders and elected officials to discuss new comparisons of the region\u2019s vitality to other American cities. It concluded with the leader of Greater MSP, Peter Frosch, listing the group\u2019s agenda for promoting economic development over the next few years.\nGreater MSP is heavily concentrating on attracting companies and investments in medtech, retail technology, semiconductor design, manufacturing and agriculture, particularly with an initiative to promote sustainable aviation fuel production in Minnesota.\nI left that meeting encouraged by the thinking and decisions at Greater MSP, but I also worried the participants in that meeting came away thinking Greater MSP has it all under control.\nThere is no magic bullet \u2014 no single industry, leader, policy change or tax break that will alone revive Minnesota\u2019s vitality.\nThis is a problem of maintaining economic growth when one of the main ways an economy grows \u2014 by having more people \u2014 is constrained. As a reminder, the state\u2019s cumulative population growth from the 2020 census through last year was 2.4%, well under half the growth rate Minnesota experienced in the 2010s."

      "text": "Menopause can usher in a host of disruptive symptoms like hot flashes, night sweats and sleep problems. Hormone therapy promises relief.\nBut many women wonder about taking it. That's because the treatment, subject of a recent expert panel convened by the Food and Drug Administration, has long been shrouded in uncertainty.\nIt was once used routinely. But in 2002, research testing one type was stopped early because of concerns about increased risks of breast cancer and blood clots. Concerns lingered even though later studies showed the benefits of today's hormone therapies outweigh the risks for many women.\n''There is still a lot of confusion and a lot of fear,'' said Grayson Leverenz, a 50-year-old from Durham, North Carolina, who hesitated to take it but is glad she did.\nOthers increasingly are also giving hormone therapy a second look. But experts continue to disagree about how to present the treatment's pros and cons. The FDA-assembled panel stressed the benefits and suggested health warnings be removed from at least some versions \u2014 prompting dozens of experts to call for more input before making any changes.\nDoctors say hormone therapy is a great option for many, but not all, menopausal women \u2014 and it's important to understand the nuanced reality of these treatments before deciding what's best.\nHow hormone therapy works\nIt treats symptoms that can arise when menstruation winds down and ends, causing levels of estrogen and progesterone to drop very low."

      "text": "UNITED NATIONS \u2014 A drone attack on a 16-truck U.N. convoy carrying desperately needed food to Sudan\u2019s famine-hit North Darfur region destroyed three vehicles that had caught fire, the World Food Program said. All drivers and personnel were safe.\n\u201cOur drivers survived, but 3 trucks carrying life-saving aid were DESTROYED. Attacks must stop. Safe, sustained access must be guaranteed,\u2019\u2019 said Cindy McCain, chief of the U.N. food agency, said in a post on X.\nU.N. associate spokesperson Daniela Gross had initially told reporters Thursday that all 16 trucks were set on fire and destroyed.\nGross said it was not yet clear who was responsibility for Wednesday\u2019s attack, the second in the past three months to prevent a U.N. convoy from delivering to North Dafur. In early June, a convoy from the World Food Program and UNICEF was attacked while awaiting clearance to proceed to North Darfur\u2019s besieged capital, el-Fasher, killing five people and injuring several others.\nSudan plunged into conflict in April 2023, when violence sparked by long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders erupted in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including western Darfur. Some 40,000 people have been killed and nearly 13 million displaced, U.N. agencies say. Nearly 25 million people are experiencing acute hunger, Gross said.\nThe paramilitary Rapid Support Forces and their allies announced in late June that they had formed a parallel government in areas they control, mainly in the vast Darfur region where allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity are being investigated.\nThe RSF has encircled el-Fasher, where the U.N. says people are facing starvation. It is the only capital the paramilitary forces don\u2019t hold in Darfur, which is comprised of five states.\nOver a year ago, famine was declared in the Zamzam displacement camp in North Darfur. The risk of famine has since spread to 17 areas in Darfur and the Kordofan region, which is adjacent to North Darfur and west of Khartoum, the U.N. says."

      "text": "President Donald Trump is signaling that he would step back for now from efforts to reach a Ukraine peace deal, expressing frustration over rising casualties and the failure of the two sides to come closer to a peace agreement.\n\u201cI\u2019m not happy about anything about that war. Nothing. Not happy at all,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday.\nHe added that he would make an important decision about the future of the conflict in \u201ctwo weeks,\u201d a phrase that he often uses not to specify a precise time frame, but to indicate that he wants to put off a decision for a while. After that time, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ll know which way I\u2019m going, because I\u2019m going to go one way or the other.\u201d\nThe comments amounted to a significant shift from a president who had projected great confidence over the past several weeks in his ability to obtain security guarantees for Ukraine and a swift meeting between the warring leaders, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.\nDuring the course of this week, Trump has gone from boasting that he could bring a quick end to the war to expressing skepticism that he would be able even to bring the leaders together for a face-to-face conversation.\nTrump has invested significant time and energy in efforts to bring about a quick end to the war, including a summit in Alaska with Putin just over a week ago, followed by meetings with Zelensky and European leaders at the White House on Monday.\nFor all the diplomatic pageantry, however, there\u2019s been little sign of progress, with Moscow resisting any proposals to cease its attacks on Ukraine or accept anything short of its maximum goals for the war. Outside analysts have suggested the White House misunderstood Putin\u2019s aims and may have been influenced by wishful thinking.\nFor now, Trump said, he would give Putin time to decide whether he would meet with Zelensky, as the president had requested."

      "text": "Mick Abel\u2019s debut with the Twins was a dud, yielding six runs in three innings, and the Twins were handed a 7-3 loss to the Chicago White Sox on Saturday at Rate Field.\nAbel, one of the two players the Twins received from Philadelphia in the Jhoan Duran trade, was undone during a 39-pitch second inning. The 24-year-old righthander gave up three singles and walked two batters before surrendering a grand slam to Colson Montgomery on a 97-mph sinker left over the middle of the plate.\nIt was a disappointing introduction for Abel, who made six starts with the Phillies earlier this year. Pitching with a one-run lead in the second inning, Andrew Benintendi and Luis Robert Jr. opened with back-to-back singles.\nSandwiched between two strikeouts, Abel gave up an RBI single to Chase Meidroth on a 0-2 curveball at the bottom of the strike zone. Abel had a chance to escape with the score tied, but he walked consecutive batters, including Miguel Vargas with the bases loaded.\nThat brought up Montgomery, who hit a two-run homer off Zebby Matthews on Friday. Montgomery didn\u2019t miss a down-the-middle pitch and blasted it 412 feet. Montgomery has 12 homers and 32 RBI since the All-Star break.\nAbel, who made three strong starts with the Class AAA St. Paul Saints after he was traded to the Twins, allowed six runs on seven hits and two walks while striking out two."

If Russia took her village by force or through some peace deal, she would not give up her property and start anew. There is electricity and water. Their cattle still have room to roam.\nShe wants Donetsk to stay in Ukraine but has little faith that will happen. Her family moved once before, then returned. This time they plan to stay put.\n\u201cThis is our land,\u201d she said. \u201cI just want this to be over with, so we won\u2019t get bombed.\u201d\nAcross the street, Khoruzha, 72, said she would not accept any end to the war that resulted in Russia claiming even the parts of the eastern Donetsk region it currently controls. She remembers voting for Ukrainian independence from this village in 1991.\nShe said she believes in Zelensky. But she would not support him if he moved toward freezing the lines where they are now. Her son, Valentin, was recently wounded fighting near Pokrovsk and will soon return to the front.\n\u201cI want all of Donetsk to be Ukraine,\u201d she said."

      "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. \u2014 Immigration officials said they intend to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda after he declined an offer to be sent to Costa Rica in exchange for remaining in jail and pleading guilty to human smuggling charges, his defense attorneys told a court Saturday.\nThe Costa Rica offer came late Thursday and included a requirement that he remain in jail for the time being and then serve whatever sentence he would receive for pleading guilty, according to a brief filed in Tennessee, where the criminal case was brought. After Abrego Garcia left jail on Friday, Immigration and Customs Enforcement notified his attorneys that he would be deported to Uganda and should report to immigration authorities on Monday.\nLater on Friday, ''the government informed Mr. Abrego that he has until first thing Monday morning \u2014 precisely when he must report to ICE's Baltimore Field Office \u2014 to accept a plea in exchange for deportation to Costa Rica, or else that offer will be off the table forever,'' his defense attorneys wrote.\nThey declined to say whether he is still considering the offer.\nFiled along with the brief was a letter from the Costa Rican government stating that Abrego Garcia would be welcomed to that country as a legal immigrant and wouldn't face the possibility of detention.\nJustice Department spokesperson Chad Gilmartin responded to the brief with a statement saying, ''A federal grand jury has charged Abrego Garcia with serious federal crimes ... underscoring the clear danger this defendant presents to the community. This defendant can plead guilty and accept responsibility or stand trial before a jury. Either way, we will hold Abrego Garcia accountable and protect the American people.''\nAbrego Garcia's case became a flash point in President Donald Trump's immigration agenda after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador in March, despite a judge's earlier determination that he faced a ''well-founded fear'' of violence there. Facing a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, only to detain him on human smuggling charges.\nHe pleaded not guilty and asked the judge to dismiss the case, claiming that it is an attempt to punish him for challenging his deportation to El Salvador. The Saturday filing came as a supplement to that motion to dismiss, stating that the threat to deport him to Uganda is more proof that the prosecution is vindictive."

      "text": "Donald Trump ran on a promise to use the powers of the government for revenge against those he believed wronged him. He now appears to be fulfilling that campaign promise while threatening to expand his powers well beyond Washington.\nOn Friday, the FBI searched the home of John Bolton, Trump's first-term national security adviser-turned-critic, who last week in an interview called the administration ''the retribution presidency.''\nTrump's team has opened investigations of Democrat Letitia James, the New York attorney general who sued Trump's company over alleged fraud for falsifying records, and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who as a congressman led Trump's first impeachment. The Republican administration has charged Rep. LaMonica McIver, D-N.J., over her actions at an immigration protest in Newark, New Jersey, after arresting Mayor Ras Baraka, also a Democrat. Under investigation, too, is former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a candidate for New York City mayor.\nTrump has directed prosecutors to investigate two other members of his first administration: Miles Taylor, who wrote a book warning of what he said were Trump's authoritarian tendencies, and Chris Krebs, who earned the president's wrath for assuring voters that the 2020 election, which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden, was secure.\nThe actions look like the payback Trump said he would pursue after being hit with four separate sets of criminal charges during his four years out of office. Those included an indictment for his effort to overturn the 2020 election that was gutted by the U.S. Supreme Court, which said presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for official acts while in office.\n''Joe Biden weaponized his administration to target political opponents \u2013 most famously, President Trump,\" Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said Saturday. Trump, she said, \"is restoring law and order.''\nIn addition to making good on his promises of retribution, Trump has deployed the military into American cities to fight crime or help with immigration arrests. He has sent thousands of National Guard troops and federal law enforcement officers to patrol the streets in the nation's capital, after activating the Guard and Marines in Los Angeles earlier this year.\nTaken together, the actions have alarmed Democrats and others who fear Trump is wielding the authority of his office to intimidate his political opponents and consolidate power in a way that is unprecedented in American history."

The first Sunday record was set in 1994 and still stands, more than 30 years later.\nThe Minnesota State Fair posts the previous day\u2019s official attendance midday for the run of the fair, and we\u2019ll update those numbers here each day.\nApart from the day of the week (more on that later), one of the biggest factors to fair attendance is weather. The hotter and more humid \u2014 or rainy \u2014 a forecast fair day, generally the lower the attendance.\nSince 2013, only eight days have recorded temperatures of 90 degrees or higher. There are typically three days with some rain; we average less than half an inch of rain over the course of the fair. In 2023, no precipitation was recorded."

Those metro teams and B\u2019s that rated high in the state baseball board\u2019s points system went into the playoffs to create a 32-team bracket.\nThat left Class C with a 48-team bracket. Attendance was solid with this two-class format in 2023 and record-breaking in 2024.\nThe state board, which has long followed the Politburo rules of order, decided another enormous shakeup was needed to start in 2025:\n- The return of Class A with metro-designated teams and an oft-flawed points system to move up outstate B teams to compete for a 24-team bracket.\n- A 24-team Class B bracket for teams that had avoided being moved up.\n- A 32-team bracket for Class C intended to create opportunity for tiny-town ballclubs. Three of those \u2014 Quamba, Opole and Hawley \u2014 made it as first-timers in this 102nd annual tournament.\nOne problem created with this new system was that the town serving as the main host for Class A was going to have attendance issues. Generally, family and very close friends will be the audience for metro teams, and even those friends might hesitate to take the drive down Hwy. 212 to show support.\nWhich led to this: The Gaylord Baseball Association agreed to host Class A, based on the understanding with Brownton and Hutchinson that the three near-neighbors would split up the costs and proceeds at the end of the tournament.\nThere would also be the need for a few bucks headed to Glencoe, not an official host, but the fourth site required for the three-weekend tournament that runs through Labor Day.\nThen again, once in a while, you can get a fine Class A matchup on the second weekend, and that took place here on Friday night:"

      "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Erik and Lyle Menendez were denied parole by a California board this week after decades in prison for killing their parents in 1989 at their Beverly Hills mansion.\nDuring two days of hearings, the brothers were each questioned by panels of two commissioners and asked to speak with complete candor on the abuse they suffered in childhood, their mindsets leading up to and after the murders and various prison transgressions.\nThe brothers were sentenced to life in prison in 1996 for fatally shooting Jose and Kitty Menendez. The case has long captivated true crime enthusiasts, with the brothers amassing public support in the past year after shows on Netflix renewed interest.\nThe hearings marked the closest they have come to freedom since their convictions. Despite each receiving three-year denials, they will be eligible to request an administrative review in one year. If granted, they could appear before the parole board again as early as 18 months from now.\nHere are takeaways from the hearings:\nHaving prohibited cellphones is not a minor prison infraction\nWhile it might not seem like a big deal to the nonincarcerated public, commissioners emphasized to the brothers that their use of illicit cellphones cast a shadow on their positive achievements while behind bars.\nCellphones can be used to order hits, move drugs in prison and coordinate attacks on officers, they noted. Their presence meant a correctional officer had to smuggle them in, and a prison gang may have benefited by charging a tax on it, commissioner Robert Barton told Erik Menendez."

Fleck as Gophers football coach, replacing Tracy Claeys, who was fired after a 9-4 season that was successful on the field but marred by a sexual assault investigation, suspensions and subsequent players boycott.\n\u201cNine wins is a good season, and the Holiday Bowl [win] was good, but we needed to shake the tree,\u201d Coyle said while introducing Fleck as coach. \u201cWe needed to do something different.\u201d\nConsider the tree shaken and the program stirred.\nIn Fleck, the Gophers landed a 36-year-old bundle of energy who had just led Western Michigan to a 13-0 regular season and Cotton Bowl appearance. A former NFL wide receiver, Fleck arrived in Dinkytown with a mandate to change the program\u2019s culture. \u201cI\u2019ve got news for everybody,\u201d he declared. \u201cChange has arrived.\u201d\nEight years later, Fleck has built upon that change.\nHe will open his ninth season as Gophers coach on Thursday night against Buffalo at Huntington Bank Stadium, and suddenly he is the fifth-longest-tenured coach in program history. He has raised both the floor and the ceiling for the program, and with it, the expectations of fans starving for a Big Ten championship.\nFleck carries a 58-39 record into the opener, and his .598 win percentage trails only Henry L. Williams (.786) and Bernie Bierman (.727) among Gophers coaches. The Gophers under Fleck won a share of the Big Ten West Division title in 2019, going 11-2 with a No. 10 ranking in the final Associated Press and coaches polls, their best finish since 1962. Seven of Fleck\u2019s Gophers have earned All-America honors.\n\u201cA job of any head football coach is to create a standard that\u2019s really high, and you continue to either meet that standard and then create another standard,\u201d Fleck said. \u201cYou want to raise the level of expectation within the program, constantly on the field, off the field, and I think we\u2019ve continued to do that. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever sat back and settled for anything.\u201d"
