      "feedback": "The draft’s four lines are too generic and lack the causal depth, specific triggers, and quantified risk you need for a world‑class outlook.  \n1. Replace “Fed 50bp cut” with the exact date (Sept 2025) and the 10‑yr yield range (4.23 %‑4.13 %) that would trigger the cut, citing (GX057ADL7).  \n2. For the ACM upside, tie the revenue guidance to the small‑cap valuation gap narrowing by March 2026, and add the CPI‑Fed minutes as the primary watch signal (C22MKA9VY)(Q7VVGNSQE).  \n3. The Joby downside must include the FAA certification decision date (Aug 31) and the risk of a delayed certification pushing the price below $18, citing (TXVQ5ZQ0N).  \n4. The BoJ downside should specify the Aug 30 policy meeting and the January 0.5 % hike expectation, linking the yen’s 150‑155 range to a 0.5‑0.7 % compression of equity risk premia (K0WFSW29E).  \nAdd probability justifications: e.g., 70 % probability that the Fed will cut if CPI stalls at 2.7 % (LZG5YWQMC) and 60 % that the BoJ will hike if labor market data shows a 0.3 % wage rise (K0WFSW29E).  \nEnsure every fact or number has an ID citation, avoid vague terms like “cut easing,” and keep each line to one sentence.",
