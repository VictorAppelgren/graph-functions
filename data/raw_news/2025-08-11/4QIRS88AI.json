      "text": "AMC Entertainment, the largest U.S. and global theater chain, saw its finances improve in the June quarter and its stock pop Monday as CEO Adam Aron cited a recovering box office industrywide and stronger numbers across AMC and Odeon in Europe.\nRevenues rose 35% to $1.4 billion, while net loss narrowed to $4.7 million from $32.8 million. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose to $189 million compared to $38 million. A post-Covid, post-strike recovery didn\u2019t really take off until early in Q2 with A Minecraft Movie.\nAlso key, net cash from operating activities swung to $138.4 million from a negative-$34.6 million and free cash flow of $89 million compared with negative-$79 million the year before. Cash and cash equivalents at June 30 totaled $423.7 million.\nShare are up 6%. They popped after the numbers and were up as much as 12% premarket.\nWatch on Deadline\nAron called the latest numbers \u201ca combination of a recovering industrywide box office, and the undeniable fact that both AMC and Odeon are executing so well in so many different ways,\u201d saying they broke records across nearly every per-patron metric.\nHe\u2019ll be talking more about Q2 on a call at 5 pm ET today.\nOdeon, comprised of Nordic Cinema Group, UCI Cinemas and Odeon Cinemas, is Europe\u2019s largest circuit.\nAdmissions revenue per patron topped $12 for the first time, coming in at $12.14. Consolidated food and beverage revenue per guest rose to $7.95. Consolidated revenue per patron hit $22.26, which Aron said \u201cpowerfully validate our strategic initiatives and that consumers view moviegoing at AMC and Odeon as highly attractive out-of-home entertainment experiences.\u201d\nThe company has recently taken steps to bolster its balance sheet, which took a massive hit during Covid and has been digging out ever since. It raised some fresh cash and addressed its 2026 debt maturities, pushing them out to 2029. \u201cIn so doing, we have put in place a solid foundation to capitalize on what we believe will be our industry\u2019s continued growth momentum, especially evident in the fourth quarter of 2025 and continuing deep into 2026,\u201d said Aron.\nHe gave a shoutout to the circuit\u2019s AMC Go, a focus on state-of-the-art laser projection, more comfortable seating, expanded food and beverage offerings, and premium large-format and extra-large format, where auditoriums are operating at close to three times the occupancy of a regular auditorium.\nThe chain is rolling out more Imax, Dolby Cinema, Prime, iSense, XL and Laser-equipped screens.\nTime is closing in on the BAD ACTORS \ud83e\udd75"

This shift in distribution strategy, they said, will unlock greater accessibility and discoverability for sports fans and provide an important catalyst for driving engagement and further subscriber growth for Paramount+.\nParamount intends to explore UFC rights outside the U.S. as they become available in the future.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited to join forces with Dana, Ari, and Mark. Rarely do opportunities arise to partner on an exclusive basis with a global sports powerhouse like UFC \u2013 an organization with extraordinary global recognition, scale, and cultural impact,\u201d said David Ellison, chairman and CEO of Paramount, referring to TKO CEO Ari Emanuel, President and COO Mark Shapiro and UFC CEO Dana White.\n\u201cParamount\u2019s advantage lies in the expansive reach of our linear and streaming platforms. Live sports continue to be a cornerstone of our broader strategy \u2014 driving engagement, subscriber growth, and long-term loyalty, and the addition of UFC\u2019s year-round must-watch events to our platforms is a major win. We look forward to delivering this premium content to millions of fans in the U.S., and potentially beyond.\u201d\nEllison\u2019s Skydance Media investor group closed its acquisition of Paramount Global from Shari Redstone August 7. He\u2019s been spotted attending UFC fights during the past few months.\n\u201cThis is a milestone moment and landmark deal for UFC, solidifying its position as a preeminent global sports asset,\u201d said Emanuel. \u201cOur decade-long journey with UFC has been defined by continuous growth and expansion, and this agreement is an important realization of our strategy. We believe wholeheartedly in David\u2019s vision and look forward to being in business with a company that will prioritize technology as a means to enhance storytelling and the overall viewing experience.\u201d\nThe news comes as UFC\u2019s broadcast rights deal with Disney\u2019s ESPN, which has been paying an average of around $500 million annually over five years, expires at the end of 2025. In a flurry of recent agreements, last week, ESPN and TKO, which also owns WWE, signed a five-year deal worth $1.6 billion to broadcast WWE premium live events.\n\u201cParamount is a platinum partner with significant reach,\u201d said Shapiro. \u201cOur new agreement unlocks powerful opportunities at TKO for years to come \u2013 meaningful economics for investors; expanded premium inventory for global brand partners; and deeper engagement for UFC\u2019s passionate fanbase. Just as importantly, our athletes will love this new stage.\u201d\nBest of Deadline\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter. For the latest news, follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram."

      "text": "Paramount Global and Skydance Media have finally reached the end of their long and winding merger road, announcing the close of their $8.4 billion combination and opening a new chapter for Hollywood.\nThe newly combined company is officially known as \u201cParamount, A Skydance Corporation,\u201d according to a press release. Its stock will begin trading Thursday on the Nasdaq, under the ticker symbol PSKY.\nMore from Deadline\n\u201cToday marks an exciting and pivotal moment as we prepare to bring Paramount\u2019s legacy as a Hollywood institution into the future of entertainment,\u201d Chairman and CEO David Ellison said in the release. \u201cMy vision is to honor exceptional storytelling while modernizing how we make and deliver content to support the world\u2019s top creative talent, enhance experiences for audiences worldwide, and create sustainable value for our shareholders.\u201d\nSkydance\u2019s two-step merger with Paramount, which involved first taking over its controlling shareholder, National Amusements, was backed by private equity firm RedBird Capital.\n\u201cOur investment in Paramount and long-term partnership with the Ellison family reflects our deep conviction in the value of world-class intellectual property and the potential to unlock substantial growth as these businesses navigate technological disintermediation and evolving consumer preferences,\u201d RedBird Founder and Managing Partner Gerry Cardinale said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been collaborating with David Ellison for the last 15 years and made our first investment in Skydance in 2019. Over this period, we\u2019ve seen the power of an owner-operator model that integrates technological sophistication with a talent-friendly passion for producing great original content.\u201d\nThursday\u2019s formal announcement came as Ellison, Cardinale and other executives gathered in New York for a press conference. It will be the first chance for the media to hear directly from the new management team, which has had to stay largely out of view as the regulatory process unfolded.\nSkydance announced its merger proposal in July 2024, prevailing over multiple suitors, in part because of its long relationship with Paramount as a co-finance partner. At the end of last yeat, it appeared that the tie-up would get the stamp of approval early in 2025. Instead, the process dragged on for months amid a surprising level of scrutiny from the ostensibly pro-business Trump Administration. Looking to make an example of CBS News as part of his broader attack against the media, Trump sued the division over a 60 Minutes segment, extracting a $16 million settlement despite the unanimous view of legal experts that the suit had no merit. Meanwhile, Trump-appointed FCC Chairman Brendan Carr held up the deal over a \u201cnews distortion\u201d complaint brought against CBS, which remains pending."

      "text": "In This Article:\nAMC CEO Adam Aron on this afternoon\u2019s Q2 earnings call verified what we first reported: The No. 1 circuit has plans to cut down its preshow.\nLast month, in a deal with National CineMedia, AMC added more ad time in an effort to earn more bucks. Studio executives raised their pitchforks in anger, especially after AMC made it known to consumers in advance that there\u2019s 25-30 minutes of preshow.\nMore from Deadline\n-\nAMC Theatres Looks To Shorten Preshow Following Studios\u2019 Ire \u2013 The Dish\n-\nAMC Entertainment Narrows Q2 Loss, Revenue Jumps As Box Office Recovers\n-\nAMC CEO Sees Paramount Ramping Up Theatrical Releases Under Skydance - \"We Are Excited\"\nAMC\u2019s plans to shorten the preshow doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re cutting out the new ad window, as that agreement with NCM has just commenced.\n\u201cWe think we can shave four or five minutes out of it. So it\u2019s not that there\u2019s been a change of heart,\u201d Aron said on an call with analysts after his company reported Q2 2025 earnings Monday. \u201cWe always knew that when we did the NCM deal, that we would probably have to shorten at the same time we\u2019re lengthening, so that those two changes to vectors offset each other and balance each other out.\u201d\nHow is that four- to five-minute edit of the preshow comprised? Aron said that in AMC\u2019s own internal preshow study that included rival circuits, they noticed that AMC ran one extra trailer compared with the competition. That\u2019s at least 2 1/2 minutes right there that can be cut, per Aron. There\u2019s also another 2-3 minutes of AMC\u2019s own internal promos (i.e., \u201cSilence Your Cellphones\u201d and \u201cSilence Is Golden\u201d) that\u2019s also up for being edited out, as well a one-minute promotional piece from Imax.\n\u201cSome consumers love the trailer packages because they get to see what\u2019s coming, and we know our studio partners love the trailer packages because the best form of advertising that they\u2019ll find anywhere is putting their movie product right in front of faces. But we also know that some of our other consumers think the package has gone too long, and we\u2019re trying to find a happy medium,\u201d said Aron.\nAron explained upon being asked by an analyst about the preshow that AMC entered into the ad agreement with NCM as they felt they were leaving tens of millions on the table. Such lost monies were crucial for AMC to earn and they noticed Regal and Cinemark\u2019s market share wasn\u2019t being impacted with extra NCM ads in their preshows. The AMC deal with NCM was inked at the start of the year when the box office was bleak.\nBest of Deadline\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.
