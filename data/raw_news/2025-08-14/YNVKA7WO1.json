  "title": "How Do They Get Cars Inside Malls? (And What Happens To Them?)",
  "description": "Have you ever wondered how they get cars, SUVs, and even trucks inside shopping malls? No, it's not magic, but it is done in a specific way.",
  "content": "Shopping malls and cars have a rather interesting history. Victor Gruen, known as the father of the shopping mall, sought to bring the charm of European cities to the traditional American shopping strip. However, his idea soon took the form of a hyper-commercial space surrounded by parked cars and sprawling suburbs. \"I would like to take this opportunity to disclaim paternity once and for all,\" he said in the later stages of his life. But how do cars like the 2026 Infiniti QX60 get inside the mall, appearing as exhibits, or even within showrooms?\n\nWell, the answer is nothing too magical, and there are a variety of ways in which it can be accomplished. When it comes to designing large-scale commercial spaces like a shopping mall, architects carefully plan elements such as service corridors and spaces, in addition to the circulation areas for regular human visitors. Some malls have special back entrances that are reserved for freight movement, maintenance, service staff, and even designated areas for transit of goods.\n\nThese are the routes that are often taken to put cars inside shopping malls, either as an exhibit for the visitors, or park them inside showroom spaces. If there are designated entryways for cars, they are also put to use for the same purpose. If the internal architecture of a shopping mall wasn't designed to allow discreet entry of cars, the front doors and walkways are often used to move the cars in, preferably in early or late hours to prevent hindering the movement of shoppers and visitors. Lately, modern shopping malls have adopted sliding doors that are open partially on a general day, but the entry points are fully slid open to allow the movement of large items, such as cargo or cars.",

      "text": "\u2018Every day will be a perfect shopping day,\u201d cooed the adverts for America\u2019s first indoor mall when it opened in Edina, Minnesota, in 1956. Edina is blanketed by snow and ice in winter, and baked by unbearably humid heat in summer. The Southdale Center offered the bliss of balmy strolls all year round.\nInside its crisp, white, rectangular blocks lay neat parades of shops arranged around a three-storey Garden Court of Perpetual Spring, where 50ft eucalyptus trees rose towards high windows and exotic vines tumbled from balconies overhead. A cylindrical cage filled with brightly coloured birds towered over cafe tables adorned with cheery yellow umbrellas (despite the lack of weather), while a carousel turned to the soothing sounds of muzak. Compared with the familiar low-rise, outdoor strip malls, this climate-controlled, multi-storey shopping landscape was a breakthrough.\n\u201cFlow up and down is so easy and uninhibited,\u201d gushed Architectural Forum, on the novel use of escalators, \u201cand so much gaiety is added by that second layer of moving people, lights and colour, that timidity about two-level design now seems pointless.\u201d\nThis radical vision was the work of Victor Gruen, a Jewish refugee who had fled Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938. He set his sights on bringing a dose of Viennese urbanity to what he saw as the car-dominated \u201cavenues of horror\u201d of American commercial strips. He imagined Southdale as the centre of a new high-density, mixed-use district, surrounded by housing and offices, as well as a school and a medical centre, with an artificial lake wrapped by curved streets, all forming a utopian \u201cblight-proof neighbourhood\u201d.\nDayton, the development company, had other ideas. The construction of the shopping centre massively raised land values in the surrounding area, so they decided to cash in, flogging their remaining plots to builders of single-family homes. The result has since become an all-too-familiar sight across the US: a mall marooned in a sea of car parking, ringed by multi-lane roads and suburban sprawl. It was far from an inclusive vision, either. By proposing an idealised alternative to downtown \u2013 removed from actual downtown, shielded from the elements, only accessible by car and designed solely for shopping \u2013 Gruen had created a mechanism to protect white, middle-class homeowners from those unlike themselves.\nSouthdale spawned thousands of imitators across the country, many designed by Gruen, leading him to be crowned Father of the Shopping Mall \u2013 a label he grew to despise when he saw what he had unleashed. In 1978, two years before his death, he renounced this legacy. \u201cI would like to take this opportunity to disclaim paternity once and for all,\u201d he said. \u201cI refuse to pay alimony to those bastard developments. They destroyed our cities.\u201d\nIn the eyes of design critic Alexandra Lange, the caricature of the mall as malevolent place-wrecker is not quite not so straightforward. In her new book, Meet Me by the Fountain: An Inside History of the Mall, she explores the death and life of the great American shopping centre, charting its evolutions, mutations and shortcomings, but also examining what lessons might be learned, and how the mall could be reimagined for a more civic future.\nDespite occupying so many sprawling acres of the US landscape, malls have received little critical attention. Like design for children, the subject of her last book, Lange notes that \u201cthe mall was ubiquitous and underexamined and potentially a little bit embarrassing as the object of serious study\u201d. They are a compromised and often architecturally despised form, she writes, an ersatz version of a more ancient high street. Yet they offer protection from weather and traffic, with level access, automatic doors, lifts and abundant toilets, providing a haven for children, elderly people and the less able, for whom the city is not always a welcoming place. Malls also offer teens a dry-run of independence, a safer hang-out than a street corner. But, says Lange, \u201cteens aren\u2019t alone in their desire for a gentler public realm\u201d.\nCharting the boom of suburban malls in the 1960s, Lange tracks how their principles were imposed on downtown areas in the 1970s, in the form of \u201cfestival marketplaces\u201d and pedestrianised shopping zones, in an effort to revitalise hollowed-out urban cores. Once again, Gruen led the charge, arguing that the salvation of downtown rested on luring white upwardly-mobile housewives.\nCities needed ring roads, he argued, along with masses of satellite parking lots and an underground network of tunnels for trucks, liberating the streets for pedestrians, plants, fountains and public art. It would be an ordered, clean and secure landscape of consumption, managed by commercial interests \u2013 foreshadowing the rise of Business Improvement Districts, which would later manage swathes of urban centres, seen by many as the privatisation of public space by stealth.\nThe festive revival took off, seized upon by mayors looking for a cheap fix. From 1959 to the early 1980s more than 200 US cities embraced the model, closing blocks to car traffic. But by 2000, fewer than 24 of these open-air malls remained. As Lange writes: \u201cThe design intervention that was supposed to bring people back from the suburban mall had, instead, exacerbated the very problem it was trying to solve, turning downtowns into car-centric, retail-first monocultures rather than pedestrian-first, mixed-use places.\u201d The few pedestrian malls that did succeed were all anchored by either a university, a beach, or a major tourist attraction. \u201cAmericans walk when they are in college or on vacation,\u201d Lange observes. \u201cThe rest of the time, automobility rules.\u201d\nWe see how mall design takes a quantum leap in the 1980s with the arrival of Jon Jerde, the ringmaster of retail experience, whose Horton Plaza in San Diego set a new bar for consumerist dreamscapes. Opened in 1985, it was a fantasy land of exotic references, where Spanish piazzas collided with Moorish souks, and Italian colonnades crashed into Mexican terraces, connected by elevated crisscrossing routes. It was an instant hit, attracting 25 million visitors in its first year, lured by the possibility of dining inside a super-sized stripy cube modelled on an Alberti church in Florence, or lounging on an undulating bench beneath an op-art obelisk.\nJerde\u2019s strategy transcended the malls of the 1960s and 70s, which had been based on maximising customer transactions. Instead, he argued that malls should \u201cmake shopping beside the point\u201d. In Jerde\u2019s eyes, they took on an almost religious status, as \u201ca vessel for heightened human experience to occur\u201d. Opened in 1993, his Universal CityWalk in Los Angeles was a surreal simulation of Tinseltown, conceived as a trashy mashup of famous fragments from across the city, complete with a big King Kong hanging off a building halfway down the street.\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t the LA we did get,\u201d said Jerde, \u201cbut it\u2019s the LA we could have gotten \u2013 the quintessential, idealised LA.\u201d Seduced by the perpetual carnival atmosphere, with the crime and grime of the city edited out, people might hang out longer \u2013 and end up spending more.\nThat is, until the magic wears off. Monthly average time spent in malls dropped from 12 hours in 1980 to just four by 1990, while a 2017 report predicted the demise of up to a quarter of US malls by 2022. In reality, thanks to the pandemic, that figure increased to a third. As Lange points out, the vacancy represents an opportunity: \u201cAs big blank boxes in the middle of big empty parking lots, their structures serve as a land trust for the 21st century.\u201d\nWhen the huge Highland Mall in Texas went into foreclosure, Austin Community College saw their chance. Cutting windows and skylights into what were concrete bunkers, they transformed the site into an education campus. Former boutiques are now classrooms, with translucent walls facing indoor, tiled streets, while a local public television station has moved its studios into a former department store, sharing facilities with the college. Other redundant malls have been converted into offices, seniors\u2019 housing, even public parks.\nIn the UK, vacant department stores are also taking on a new lease of life. The Ministry of Sound announced this week that it plans to \u201cremix\u201d a House of Fraser store in west London as flexible offices, a gym and a rooftop bar-restaurant, while others across the country have been transformed into galleries, studios and training kitchens.\nSome fates are better than others. Jerde\u2019s Horton Plaza was sadly stripped to the bones last year, awaiting rebirth as a bland hi-tech office campus. Meanwhile, Gruen\u2019s City Center Mall in Columbus, Ohio is now Columbus Commons, a six-acre oasis in the heart of downtown, with a performance space, bocce courts and lush gardens.\n\u201cImagine the department store reborn as a spa or a rec centre,\u201d Lange concludes, \u201ccommunity college classroom cheek by jowl with Forever 21 and a branch library.\u201d Once conceived as an idealised, sanitised version of the city, safe behind walls and parking lots, the mall, it seems, is fated to be swallowed up by the city itself.\nComments (\u2026)\nSign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion"

      "text": "The 2026 Infiniti QX60 Is A Luxurious Way To Keep Making The Same Mistake\nThere's a saying that goes something like \"The more the Infiniti QX60 changes, the more it stays the same.\" In my line of work, I have driven a number of large luxury family SUVs and the Infiniti QX60 of several model years joins the chorus. Last year, I drove a very comfortable and competent \u2014 if a bit expensive and a touch boring \u2013 2024 Infiniti QX60; SlashGear subsequently reviewed a 2025 example. Now, a 2026 Infiniti QX60 appeared in my driveway.\nI didn't find the QX60 all that compelling, though I concede that I am probably not the primary demographic for a $70k+ seven passenger luxury SUV. However, regardless of who Infiniti has in mind for it, the big green SUV that is sitting in the cul-de-sac still needs to perform well within its wheelhouse in order to sell at an appreciable volume. In short, has another couple of model years in the oven made the QX60 any better of an offering?\nWhat's new, what's old\nThe last generation QX60 was essentially a Nissan Pathfinder that was roughly $20,000 more expensive, drivetrain and all. Starting for the 2025 model year, the new QX60 shook up the formula. This 2026 version is fitted with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that utilizes Nissan's \"variable compression\" technology. It churns out 268 horsepower and uses a 9-speed automatic transmission to send power to all four wheels. For comparison, the 3.5-liter V6 used in the Pathfinder and the old QX60 makes 295 horsepower.\nThe smaller engine (with less power) gives the QX60 a fuel economy rating of 24 combined miles per gallon. For what it's worth, I was never able to achieve that' instead I was getting around 19 miles per gallon, which isn't stellar by any metric. Occasionally, that would drop to 17 miles per gallon. From a big V8, that might be expected, but it's worrying from a 2.0-liter four-banger.\nInfiniti's argument for the variable compression system is that it can prioritize either frugality or eagerness. Sadly, when it came to actually driving the QX60, it wasn't all that interesting. 268 horsepower in a vehicle as big as the QX60 doesn't translate to a very swift ride. It's rather slow. To it's credit, however, the ride was smooth and the suspension was plush enough that it was never particularly jarring to drive. It was like piloting a mild-mannered cloud as opposed to a rowdy seafaring vessel.\nInside and out\nThe inside was a different, far more successful story. Quilted leather over nearly every surface and big comfy bucket seats can't be considered in any way lacking. The inside amenities are flat out great. The infotainment system is big and bright allowing you to see whatever is necessary to inform or entertain you, and the Klipsch sound system is fantastic. The QX60's cabin is a fine place to be, as long as you don't need to be anywhere that quickly.\nIt may sound like I'm being harsh or overly critical towards the QX60, but underpowered engine and awful fuel economy aside, the QX60 was entirely pain-free to live with. It was nice to sit in on hot days, the many electronics inside never gave me any sort of hassle, and every screen was easy to navigate. I have genuinely no complaints about the interior experience. It just wasn't all that exciting or interesting to live with, compared to something like a big Escalade, a high-tech Mercedes, or a wacky BMW.\nPricing the competition\nTo get all those goodies, this 2026 QX60 was the top-of-the-line \"Autograph\" trim: that's when you enjoy the aforementioned Klipsch speakers (20 of them to be exact), massaging front seats, quilted leather, and a distinguished two-tone paint scheme. It starts at $66,150. Additionally, this QX60 was equipped with the \"Technology Package\" to bolster the already high-tech interior. That $3,150 option includes ProPilot Assist 2.1, Nissan's capable but not segment-leading hands-off driver assistance suite.\nThe only other options were $255 splash guards and a $1,695 \"Deep Emerald and Black Obsidian\" two-tone paint scheme (it does look great). Add in the $1,495 destination charge and you arrive at $72,745 for the privilege.\nThat's a lot of money for an SUV in an extremely crowded segment. A Lexus TX 350 F Sport starts at a very similar $65,860. It has a little more horsepower at 275, but is otherwise pretty comparable. However, it has a little less towing capacity at 5,000 pounds compared to the QX60's 6,000 pounds. The Lexus, however, is available as a plug-in hybrid, albeit for a significant premium, starting at $78,660. The Acura MDX Type S nullifies the Infiniti in the power department as the hopped-up Honda has 355 horsepower. It starts at $75,250.\n2026 Infiniti QX60 verdict\nThere are simply better cars than the 2026 Infiniti QX60, if you put all of the numbers together. The QX60 might have an excellent interior, but it's hampered by a drivetrain that really doesn't cut the mustard. If Nissan and/or Infiniti would have given it a spicier engine, or worked up a hybrid, or really done anything innovative or exciting to give it more power or better fuel economy, then we would be having a different conversation.\nA variable compression engine sounds cool on the surface, but if all that's accomplished is worse fuel economy and lackluster grunt, does it really matter how varied that compression ratio is? For all the cool words it adds to the spec-sheet \u2014 that most buyers will ignore entirely until they realize that the car they just dropped $70k on got absolutely dusted by a Prius \u2014 a hybrid like rivals have embraced would deliver much more.\nThe QX60 is a great interior and entertainment package, hampered by an engine that doesn't inspire much beyond maybe a few confused glances at the speedometer. I don't want Infiniti to do poorly: I want it to make cars people actually want to buy. Unfortunately, the QX60 sits toward the bottom of a highly competitive segment, let down by technology that sounds clever but doesn't quite hold up to scrutiny."
