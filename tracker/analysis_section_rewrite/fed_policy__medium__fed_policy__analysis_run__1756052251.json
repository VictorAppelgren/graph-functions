      "feedback": "Overall, the draft correctly flags a rate‑cut backdrop and small‑cap valuation relief as catalysts and anchors ACMR’s narrative, but it lacks a disciplined 3–6 month catalyst map, explicit triggers/invalidations, and a tight, source‑driven causal chain; to lift to world‑class quality, rebuild as a single, tightly sourced scenario plan that (a) constrains the horizon to 3–6 months with a formal base case and 1–2 alternative paths, (b) maps macro/policy, positioning, flows and WFE demand into ACMR’s product ramp, and (c) pins timing windows and invalidation rules to concrete data points. Specifically, embed three triggers: a Fed easing trajectory (Sep 50bp cut, potentially 150bp–175bp total, per C22MKA9VY) that would compress discount rates and lift multiples; a rebound in IPO activity and small‑cap flow (95 IPOs in 2025 raising $12.9B; per Q7VVGNSQE) that broadens small‑cap leadership beyond a few names; and a visible WFE/AI‑driven capex cycle that supports ACMR’s N2 bubbling tool commercialization and margin trajectory (SK994CBWR). Add invalidations such as: no Sep rate cut or a persistent inflation surprise that stalls rotation; IPO cadence falters versus the quoted pace; ACMR misses revenue or margin targets (e.g., Q2 revenue $215M, 2025 guidance $850–$950M, gross margin 49.4%, net margin 13.8%, debt/equity 23.3%); and export‑control developments that derail international expansion (SK994CBWR). Quantify impact with a compact sensitivity: base case implies mid‑single‑digits uplift in ACMR’s EBIT/EV multiple if rate cuts materialize and WFE demand holds; alt paths hinge on IPO momentum or a slower‑than‑expected product ramp; anchor all claims to the three IDs and avoid non‑source assertions. Improve coherence by sequencing cause -> response -> market reaction: macro regime shift leads to small‑cap rotation (Q7VVGNSQE) which enables ACMR’s N2 tech ramp to drive revenue/margin expansion (SK994CBWR); ensure every line citing ACMR metrics, IPO data, or policy guidance is footnoted to SK994CBWR, Q7VVGNSQE, or C22MKA9VY respectively, and remove duplicate citations (the repeated Q7VVGNSQE entry); replace generic phrases with precise numbers (e.g., 215M Q2 revenue; 850–950M guidance; target price 34.76; current 30.53) to support the base‑case upside and risk assessments. Finally, tighten the watch‑list to the three signals: Fed communications (C22MKA9VY), Russell 2000 vs S&P dynamics/IPO cadence (Q7VVGNSQE), and ACMR product/ export‑control updates (SK994CBWR).",
