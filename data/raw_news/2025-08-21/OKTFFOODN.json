  "title": "Vance touts Trump\u2019s tax bill, takes a shot at local Dem senator during Georgia trip",
  "description": "Vice President JD Vance visits Peachtree City, Georgia to promote Trump's tax bill while targeting opponents ahead of 2026 midterm elections.",
  "content": "Vice President JD Vance touted the gospel of President Donald Trump\u2019s \"big beautiful bill\" in Peachtree City, Georgia \u2014 and continued to take shots at those from the state who opposed the measure. Vance\u2019s visit to Georgia comes as he has visited several key districts around the country and has lauded the \"big, beautiful bill\" while Republicans seek to preserve their slim House majority and potentially pick up a few seats in the high-stakes 2026 midterm elections.The domestic policy bill included key provisions to permanently establish individual and business tax breaks included in Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and incorporated new tax deductions to cut duties on tips and overtime pay.VANCE WARNS OF \u2018PENALTY\u2019 FOR DEMS WHO OPPOSED THE \u2018BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL\u2019 AHEAD OF 2026 MIDTERMS\"If you're working hard every single day right here in the United States, or if you're building a business right here in the United States, you ought to have a tax code that rewards you, instead of punishing you,\" Vance said Thursday. \"And that's what happened when we passed the working families tax cut just a couple of months ago.\"All Democrats and five Republicans in both the House and the Senate voted against the massive measure \u2014 including Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia. However, Trump signed it into law July 4. As a result, Vance took aim at Ossoff during his visit. \"While Jon Ossoff pretends to be a moderate when he comes to Atlanta, he is a far-left liberal in Washington, D.C., and that's the only place that it actually counts if you're a United States senator,\" Vance said. \"So why don't we ask Jon Ossoff, why did you vote to raise taxes? Why did you vote to keep illegal aliens on Medicaid? Why did you vote to bankrupt Medicare?\"In July, Vance visited Canton, Ohio, and said that anyone who opposed the \"big, beautiful bill\" should face consequences ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Among those who voted against the measure in Ohio was Rep. Emilia Sykes, who represents Canton. \"Anybody who voted against it, I think they ought to pay a penalty,\" Vance said July 28. \"Because they voted against all those great things for the people of Akron and the people of Northeastern Ohio.\"TRUMP SIGNS \u2018BIG, BEAUTIFUL\u2019 BILL IN SWEEPING VICTORY FOR SECOND TERM AGENDA, OVERCOMING DEMS AND GOP REBELSVance faces a similar situation in Georgia, where Ossoff has voiced criticism for the measure and is up for reelection in 2026. Critics of Trump\u2019s tax and domestic policy measures have pointed to Medicaid and SNAP reforms included in the bill, which reports suggest would remove millions of beneficiaries from the programs.Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Ossoff referred Fox News Digital to the senator's comments at a press conference Thursday, where he cited a local news report claiming that the CEO of a Georgia hospital said it must cut millions from its budget due to Trump's bill. JD VANCE POISED TO CLINCH VICTORY FOR TRUMP'S LANDMARK BILL AS GOP FINALIZES STRATEGY\"I think it is embarrassing for the Vice President to be coming to Georgia to sell a policy that is already resulting in harm to hospitals in the state of Georgia, that's projected to throw more than 100,000 people off of health care in the state of Georgia,\" Ossoff said. \"Just this week, Evans Memorial Hospital in Southeast Georgia said that because of the bill that the Vice President is here to defend, they're going to have a $3.5 million financial hole next year. That hospital here in Georgia is now warning that they may have to cut the ICU.\"A Fox News poll released in July found a majority of voters oppose the \"big, beautiful bill.\" The poll, conducted between July 18 and 21, found that 58% of all registered voters oppose the measure, while 39% approve of it. No Democrats supported the \"big, beautiful bill,\" along with Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, and Rand Paul of Kentucky and Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania.",

Tell us \u2018You know, this provision isn\u2019t so good. We\u2019d like to change it a little bit, and if we change it, then I can get to yes.\u2019 This is the process of government. And these guys didn\u2019t even come to the White House and try to make their concerns known. They didn\u2019t try to make the legislation better. They just attack, attack, attack.\"\nVance then said he believed Democrats don\u2019t care about grocery prices, whether employees receive a raise or not, or if Americans are even employed in the first place.\n\"Their obsession in government is letting illegal aliens into this country, and attacking Donald J. Trump,\" Vance said. \"I don\u2019t think the American people should reward that broken style of politics, and I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to come November 2026.\"\nVance\u2019s remarks come as he champions the \"big, beautiful bill,\" with Republicans looking to defend their slim House majority \u2014 and potentially pick up a few seats \u2014 in the high-stakes 2026 midterm elections.\nJD VANCE POISED TO CLINCH VICTORY FOR TRUMP'S LANDMARK BILL AS GOP FINALIZES STRATEGY\nVance visited Pennsylvania\u2019s 8th District on July 16, when he praised the measure and offered support for the district\u2019s Republican representative, Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who was elected in 2024 and is in a vulnerable seat.\nVance is also slated to speak at fundraisers for the Republican National Committee on Tuesday in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and Big Sky, Montana, Axios first reported.\nAmong those who voted against the \"big, beautiful bill\" in Ohio was Rep. Emilia Sykes, who represents Canton, where Vance spoke on Monday. Sykes is in a vulnerable district as well and barely secured a victory over her opponent in the 2024 election by 2.2 percentage points, according to The New York Times.\nA spokesperson for Vance doubled down on the vice president\u2019s remarks on Monday and pointed to a new Wall Street Journal poll released on Friday that found that 63% of voters hold a negative view towards Democrats, and only 33% hold a favorable one \u2013 a new low since 1990.\n\"The Democrats just hit their lowest approval rating in 35 years, and all they can do is distract voters from the enormous wins the Trump administration is racking up,\" a Vance spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"Voters are sick of Democrat politicians constantly blowing hot air. Meanwhile, the vice president is visiting contested House districts around the country selling the substantive provisions in the president\u2019s landmark One Big Beautiful Bill.\"\nA Fox News poll released this month revealed that a majority of voters oppose the \"big, beautiful bill.\" The poll, which was conducted between July 18 and 21, found that 58% of all registered voters oppose the measure, while 39% approve of it.\nFOX NEWS POLL: TRUMP FACING HEADWINDS AT SIX-MONTH MARK\nNo Democrats got on board backing the \"big, beautiful bill,\" joined by Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, and Rand Paul of Kentucky and Republican Reps. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., labeled the bill \"cruel\" during floor remarks that lasted hours on July 3, pointing to Medicaid and SNAP reforms that reports suggest would remove millions of beneficiaries from the programs.\n\"What is contemplated in this one big, ugly bill is wrong. It\u2019s dangerous, and it\u2019s cruel, and cruelty should not be either the objective or the outcome of legislation that we consider here in the United States House of Representatives,\" Jeffries said."

      "text": "Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., said the economic challenge sparked by President Donald Trump's \"chaos and uncertainty\" is the biggest issue facing the Peach State, stressing that the president's uncertain economic policy is impacting how businesses and residents make decisions for the future.\nOssoff, preparing to run for re-election in 2026, potentially against Georgia's popular Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who has yet to announce if he will join the race. Ossoff is the only Democrat seeking reelection who represents a state that Trump won last year, making him a top target for Republicans hoping to maintain their Senate majority.\n\"I am more than prepared for any challenger,\" Ossoff, 38, told The Associated Press on Saturday while declining to comment on any potential opponents.\nOssoff defeated incumbent Republican Sen. David Perdue in a runoff in 2021, helping Democrats flip control of the Senate and hold onto the chamber's majority for four years during the Biden administration.\nDuring his first four years, Ossoff attempted to establish a reputation as a senator working to advance Georgia's traditional interests, including its farmers and military bases. He says he will attempt to work with Republicans to deliver for Georgia.\nThe senator, who has recently intensified his criticisms of Trump, warned Saturday that businesses and households in Georgia are struggling to plan for the future because of constant changes in the federal government's trade and economic moves.\n\"Businesses are unable to invest with an understanding of what the rules of international trade will be from one hour or week or month to the next,\" Ossoff told The Associated Press. \"Households are unable to plan their annual budgets because there\u2019s so much chaos and uncertainty in the implementation of federal economic policy.\"\n\"This administration needs to clearly define its economic objectives, and it needs to competently implement its plan, whatever that plan may be,\" he continued. \"The fact that the White House does not even know what its policy is, and is with such unpredictability and chaos, lurching from one policy to the other, is putting the state\u2019s economy at serious economic risk.\"\nSTACEY ABRAMS CONSIDERS 3RD RUN FOR GEORGIA GOVERNOR DESPITE BACK-TO-BACK DEFEATS\nOssoff also expressed concerns about Trump's authoritarian and \"un-American\" executive action since returning to the White House in January, pointing to the president's attempts to go after his political opponents.\n\"We have never seen a president try to wield the federal government to crush his critics and political adversaries,\" Ossoff said. \"That\u2019s something new in American history, and it is, in my view, un-American. And it\u2019s something that should chill us to the bone, no matter our politics, no matter our policy preferences.\"\nThe lawmaker urged Republicans to remember that eventually a Democrat will be president again and \"the shoe will be on the other foot.\"\n\"This is about checks and balances,\" he said. \"This is about whether or not the executive branch is constrained as designed by our Constitution, by judicious legislators who can put their partisanship aside to protect the public interest.\"\nOssoff explained that, while Democrats have limited power without control of the White House or either chamber of Congress, a big part of his job at the moment is to inform the people of Georgia that Trump's policies are not in the state's best interest.\nIn addition to his criticism of Trump, Ossoff has cited shortcomings during the Biden administration, particularly when it comes to border security. He was one of 12 Democrats who voted for the Laken Riley Act, named after a Georgia nursing student murdered by Venezuelan migrant Jose Antonio Ibarra.\nThe law requires illegal migrants accused \u2014 even without a conviction \u2014 of theft or violent crimes to be detained by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\"My view is that the American people expect and deserve secure borders,\" Ossoff said. \"And I think the Biden administration failed in its border policies. The American people expect and deserve for people who enter this country illegally and may pose a threat to public safety or national security to be apprehended by the authorities.\"\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"But the American people don\u2019t support and don\u2019t expect federal police raids on elementary schools and hospitals and churches,\" he continued, referring to the Trump administration's controversial immigration enforcement actions. \"And [the American people] don\u2019t expect our military installations to become mass prison camps for immigrants and don\u2019t want entire families rounded up with no due process. We just learned yesterday about a two-year-old U.S. citizen \u2014 a two-year-old girl \u2014 who was deported without due process. Our immigration policy needs to be responsible and serious. It also needs to be humane.\"\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."

      "text": "President Donald Trump signed his $3.3 trillion \"big, beautiful bill\" on Friday, after the House passed the final version of the measure Thursday to ensure it arrived at the president\u2019s desk by his self-imposed July 4 deadline.\nThe bill includes key provisions that would permanently establish individual and business tax breaks included in Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and incorporates new tax deductions to cut duties on tips and overtime pay.\nBefore signing the bill, the president said the bill would \"fuel massive economic growth\" and \"lift up the hard-working citizens who make this country run.\"\n\"We have officially made the Trump tax cuts permanent,\" Trump said. \"That's the largest tax cut in the history of our country. \u2026 After this kicks in, our country is going to be a rocket ship economically. We've delivered no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, and no tax on Social Security for our great seniors. \u2026 It makes the child tax credit permanent for 40 million American families. \u2026 The Golden Age of America is upon us.\"\nThe measure also raises the debt limit by $5 trillion \u2014 a provision that has faced scrutiny from figures including SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who formerly led a war against wasteful government spending at the Department of Government Efficiency.\nFurthermore, the bill rescinds certain Biden-era green energy tax credits, and allocates approximately $350 billion for defense and Trump\u2019s mass deportation initiative to weed out illegal immigrants from the U.S.\n\"Wind. It doesn't work,\" Trump said. \"I will tell you, aside from ruining our fields and our valleys, killing all the birds, [and] being very weak and very expensive, [they are] all made in China. You know, I noticed something \u2026 with all of the windmills that China sends us \u2026 I have never seen a wind farm in China.\"\nJD VANCE POISED TO CLINCH VICTORY FOR TRUMP'S LANDMARK BILL AS GOP FINALIZES STRATEGY\nThe measure also institutes Medicaid reforms, including new 80-hour-a-month work requirements for Medicaid recipients, and expands work requirements for those on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.\nRepublicans in the Senate were sent scrambling on June 26 to reform and pass the measure ahead of Trump\u2019s July 4 deadline after Senate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough determined that several Medicaid reforms in the sweeping tax and domestic policy package did not follow Senate rules and must be removed.\nUltimately, the Senate barely passed the measure on Tuesday by a 51-50 margin. Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, and Rand Paul of Kentucky all voted against the bill, requiring Vice President JD Vance to step in and cast the tie-breaking vote.\nThe legislation then headed back to the House to hammer out a few differences in the versions passed in both chambers of Congress.\nOn Wednesday evening prior to the House\u2019s passage, Vance turned up the heat on lawmakers to get the measure through the finish line, citing provisions in the measure that would bolster border security.\n\"The Big Beautiful Bill gives the president the resources and the power to undo the Biden border invasion,\" Vance said in a Wednesday post on X. \"It must pass.\"\n\"Congrats to everyone. At times I even doubted we\u2019d get it done by July 4! But now we\u2019ve delivered big tax cuts and the resources necessary to secure the border. Promises made, promises kept!\"\nTrump also zeroed in on the measure\u2019s border provisions when he urged lawmakers to get the legislation completed at a \"One, Big, Beautiful Event\" at the White House on June 26, labeling the bill the \"single-most important piece of border legislation ever to cross the floor of Congress.\"\n\"This is the ultimate codification of our agenda to \u2014 very simply, a phrase that's been used pretty well by me over the past 10 years, but maybe even before that \u2014 make America great again,\" Trump said at the event.\nOther administration officials also cautioned that failure to pass the bill would wreak havoc on the economy. For example, the White House's Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought told lawmakers in June that failure to pass the measure would result in a 60% tax hike for Americans and would trigger a recession.\nSENATE PASSES TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL' AFTER MARATHON VOTE-A-RAMA\nMeanwhile, no Democrats in either chamber of Congress backed the measure.

These lawmakers have cautioned that the reforms would prove detrimental to rural hospitals in their states.\nSpokespeople for Collins, Hawley and Murkowski did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.\nThe domestic policy package also included provisions to beef up border security and would also make permanent the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from Trump's first term.\nThe White House's Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought told lawmakers earlier this month failure to pass the measure would result in a 60% tax hike for Americans and would trigger a recession.\nAs a result, Matt Wolking, who previously served as the deputy communications director for Trump's 2020 campaign, said Senate Republicans will ultimately band together to approve the legislation to prevent the tax cuts from expiring.\nHOW JOHNSON PULLED OFF ANOTHER IMPOSSIBLE WIN WITH JUST 1-VOTE MARGIN ON $9.4B SPENDING CUT BILL\n\"Senate Republicans don't want to be responsible for the massive tax increase on the middle class that will occur if they fail to extend President Trump's tax cuts.

Still, he said there was broad agreement within the party on reforming Medicaid to block access for illegal immigrants.\n\"They\u2019re all very confident we\u2019re eventually going to get there,\" Vance said.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nThe House narrowly passed its version of the measure in May by a 215-214 margin, with two Republicans voting against the legislation.\nTrump urged lawmakers to get the legislation to the finish line Thursday, labeling the measure the \"single-most important piece of border legislation ever to cross the floor of Congress.\"\n\"This is the ultimate codification of our agenda to \u2014 very simply, a phrase that's been used pretty well by me over the past 10 years, but maybe even before that \u2014 make America great again,\" Trump said at a \"One, Big, Beautiful Event\" at the White House Thursday."

      "text": "JD Vance, a venture capitalist, author and politician won big in the 2022 Midterm elections where he defeated his Democratic opponent, Tim Ryan in Ohio\u2019s Senate election. The Republican is a bestselling author with his book, \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d that went on to be turned into a Netflix movie in 2020.\nVance ran as former President Donald Trump's vice presidential running mate in the 2024 presidential elections. The pair succeeded in their campaign and were elected into office by the American people. Vance was sworn into office as the Vice President of the United States serving during the Trump administration's second term on January 20, 2025.\nVance was born in Middletown, Ohio where his father left when he was young and his mother battled a drug addiction. Growing up, he spent a lot of time with his grandmother, who he called Mamaw.\nVance is a Marine who served in the Iraq War. After that, he went to The Ohio State University, where he received a bachelors degree in political science and philosophy.\nVance continued his education further by attending Yale Law School, where he graduated and received his law degree.\n\"Hillibilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis\u201d was written by Vance in 2016.
