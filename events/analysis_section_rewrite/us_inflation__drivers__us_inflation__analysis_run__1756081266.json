      "feedback": "This draft has a sturdy core (tariff-driven Regime A, AI/infrastructure momentum, three-regime inflation/discount-rate framework, and EV/auto-cycle anchoring long-horizon economics), but it needs a tighter, first-principles causal chain, tighter horizon discipline, and clearer, testable signals to reach world-class quality. Actionable edits: 1) crisply define Regime A/B/C with explicit thresholds for inflation momentum, wage growth, and policy signals (e.g., CPI/moe, core CPI, wage-growth pace, Jackson Hole commentary, and semiconductor capex cadence) and tie each regime to a concrete path for discount rates, risk premia, and dollar direction; replace vague language with a compact, rule-based transmission map. 2) strengthen the causal chain from policy/tariffs to macro outcomes to asset prices: show how 10% baseline tariffs with up to 34% reciprocity and episodic spikes translate into reshoring/semis capex, productivity gains, slower/higher inflation, and then into real rates and equity/credit repricing; explicitly link Nvidia/STBVARD8F support to AI infrastructure demand and related risk-taking in cyclical assets. 3) convert the narrative into a transparent scenario structure (medium/current horizons) with a one-line thesis for each regime, plus clearly stated catalysts and infirmation points; add near-term triggers (data prints, Jackson Hole remarks, semiconductor capex cadence) and second-order risks (wage inertia, policy surprise, energy supply shocks). 4) quantify where possible: preserve the 50/30/20 regime probabilities but attach confidence bands, provide ranges for price/valuation impact (e.g., how Regime A shifts P/E or equity risk premia under assumed inflation paths), and reconcile the EV/auto metrics (Ford losses, EBIT, ROIC) with ACMR guidance in a consistent, non-truncated form. 5) tighten numerical accuracy and sourcing: fix truncated values (e.g., “gross margin ≈ 4” should be 4% unless stated otherwise), ensure all numbers cited come directly from the listed sources, and remove any speculative placeholders; cross-check Ford 22PL3Q360 figures against the source. 6) improve citation discipline: attach after each substantive claim the exact IDs (SGB2PAZGK, STBVARD8F, 22PL3Q360, T1QE6JPIX, J99EM2TPZ, Y6SQOEK69, OGK8WLL69, R3WNA7L7A, NL5YYTLF2) in the order they appear, resolve any source conflicts when sources imply different regime weights or outcomes, and ensure all critical sources are consistently covered (e.g., if ACMR or oil-framework nuances appear, cite the corresponding IDs). 7) enhance cross-topic integration for SECTION FOCUS by wiring macro/policy, flows/positioning, and valuation/technicals into a single, navigable map with a concise watch-list of decisive signals (e.g., regime-transition read, AI capex cadence shift, oil-supply/refinery-outlook updates, futures-implied rate path). 8) reduce repetition and tighten prose to avoid redundancies; clearly separate long-horizon arguments from near-term trading/portfolio implications and present a compact, decision-ready paragraph for each regime. 9) include a reconciliation note for any conflicting signals across sources (e.g., oil regime vs. inflation trajectory vs. policy stance) and state how you would adjudicate such conflicts if data evolve. 10) end with a compact, explicit watch-list of signals with probable directional impact and a one-sentence takeaway per signal, ensuring the narrative remains anchored to the cited sources.",
