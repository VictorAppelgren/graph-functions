  "content": "Veteran race car driver Robbie Brewer, 53, died following a crash during a race Aug. 9 at Bowman Gray Stadium in Winston-Salem, North Carolina \u2013 his daughter confirmed in a social media post.\n\nCourtney Marquette wrote that her father was a mentor and best friend to her in a tribute posted to Facebook on the morning of Aug. 10.\n\n\u201cThere wasn\u2019t much my dad couldn\u2019t fix/do when it came to his cars & racing was his absolute life which was no secret to anyone,\u201d Marquette wrote. \u201cHe left this world doing what he loved but it was just way way too soon.\u201d\n\nFloRacing reported that Brewer\u2019s car veered towards the outside wall in the center of turns three and four with four laps remaining in a race in the Sportsman division.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, I had a very direct line of sight into Brewer\u2019s vehicle,\u201d Tom Radulovic, who was in the stadium as a fan when the crash occurred, told the Winston-Salem Journal. \u201cWhen they put him on the stretcher, I was able to see his hands, looking for that little wave athletes often give. There was no movement. My heart sank.\u201d\n\nBowman Gray Stadium said in a statement provided to the Journal and the Associated Press that Brewer was taken to an area hospital following \u201can on-track medical incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cRobbie was a talented and passionate racer, and highly respected competitor among his peers. Our thoughts and prayers are with Robbie\u2019s family and friends at this time,\u201d the statement reads.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the track for the statement and did not receive an immediate response.\n\nThe Journal reported that Brewer\u2019s death was the first at the track since 2002.\n\nDriver Brad Lewis, whose race shop is close to where Brewer lived, told the Journal that Brewer was \u201clike a big brother\u201d and added that he was \u201ca wheelman through and through.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m bet everybody in that pit area has a Robbie story and that\u2019s a testament to what he meant to that place and to all of us who compete over there,\u201d Lewis said.\n\nRandy Smith, who has worked at the stadium for 16 years and was the track\u2019s chief flagman Saturday night, told the newspaper that, \u201cI don\u2019t think there is one person that can say anything bad about Robbie.\u201d\n\nBrewer was an 11-time winner in the Sportsman division at Bowman Gray and made 311 career starts at the historic stadium across all divisions, according to FloRacing. The racing outlet noted that Brewer was twice a 602 Modified Tour champion and a 602 Super Limited (Late Model) Series champion.\n\nMarquette said in her tribute that her father had \u201ca smile that was contagious\u201d and an offbeat sense of humor.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always try to remember the goofy jokes we had,\u201d she wrote.",

      "text": "Bowman Gray Stadium Sportsman Racer Robbie Brewer Passes Away\nBowman Gray Stadium Sportsman Racer Robbie Brewer Passes Away\nSportsman racer Robbie Brewer passed away on Saturday following a medical emergency that led to a crash at Bowman Gray Stadium.\nA Bowman Gray Stadium racer passed away Saturday night following a medical emergency that led to a crash at the North Carolina short track. Robbie Brewer, of Winston-Salem, NC, who competed in the Sportsman division, crashed hard in the fourth corner coming to a restart. Brewer's passing was officially announced by his family on Sunday morning.\nSources have told FloRacing that Brewer had a heart attack in the race car, which led to the crash itself.\nThe incident occurred with four laps remaining in the first of two 20-lap features for the Sportsman division. Brewer's No. 17 car was scored in the fourth position at the time of the incident. As the field was headed towards the green flag, Brewer's car veered towards the outside wall in the center of turns three and four. He bounced off the wall and then went nearly head-on into the front-straightaway wall at the exit of turn four.\nTrack personnel rushed to the aid of Brewer where they removed the roof of his car to extricate him. He was then taken to a nearby hospital.\nBrewer is an 11-time winner in the Sportsman ranks at Bowman Gray Stadium and the 2011 division champion. He scored four victories in the 2015 season, his best at the famed quarter-mile. Brewer made 311 career starts at the Stadium with 24 in Modified, 259 in Sportsman and 28 in the Stadium Stock division. His first start came on June 2, 1990 in the Buzzbomber division (now known as the Stadium Stocks) finishing 12th in a field of 22 cars.\nBrewer was also known for driving Modifieds throughout the Carolinas, collecting double-digit victories in 602 Modified competition. In 2018 and 2019, he won a staggering 12 times in 21 races on the way to two 602 Modified Tour championships. Brewer also was the 2016 602 Super Limited (Late Model) Series champion.\nBrewer's death was the fifth time a driver has passed away following an incident at the historic Stadium built in 1937. Bernard Fox died as a result of injuries sustained in a Midget racing accident in 1947. In 1950, during NASCAR's second season at Bowman Gray, 21-year old William Justice died in a fire during a heat race for the Amateur division. In 1958, Billy Myers suffered a heart attack and drove off the track in the North Turn during a Modified race and was later pronounced dead. The most recent fatality came in 2002 when Bubba Beck had a heart attack and drove into the infield during a Modified race striking the infield barrier.\nBrewer was a beloved member of the Bowman Gray Racing community for over 35-years driving his familiar Green number-68 car for much of his tenure. On the night of his death he was a part of the Robbins & Lewis family racing stables with Sportsman competitors Dylan Ward, Chase Lewis and Street Stock racers Brad and Emilee Lewis.\n\"I gave my last fist bump to Robbie last night and told him to give 'em hell. Emilee spoke the last words to him over the radio. Hardest thing I've had to do was climb in a car after he was gone, but he would've told me to pump them up and get on the wheel,\" said Brad Lewis on Facebook. \"He was my family. A true man's man. I'm broken, as most are that he touched through his life. I will never forget you, Robbie. I'll be driving for you.\"\nBrewer was 53 years old."

(AP) \u2014 A veteran stock-car driver at a North Carolina short track died over the weekend after suffering a medical emergency while competing in a race, officials said.\nRobbie Brewer\u2019s car struck head-on a wall on the quarter-mile (0.40-kilometer) track at Bowman Gray Stadium in Winston-Salem and came to a stop near the start-finish line.\nTrack workers peeled away the roof to remove the 53-year-old Brewer, and an ambulance took him to Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist hospital, after which he died, the Winston-Salem Journal reported.\n\u201cWe are saddened by the passing of Robbie Brewer after he was transported to an area medical facility following an on-track medical incident,\u201d track officials said Sunday in a statement. \u201cRobbie was a talented and passionate racer, and highly respected competitor among his peers. Our thoughts and prayers are with Robbie\u2019s family and friends at this time.\u201d\nDetails of the medical emergency weren\u2019t released.\nBrewer was competing in a 20-lap Sportsman Division race at Bowman Gray, where thousands of racing fans turn out weekly on Saturday nights in the spring and summer for races across four divisions. Bowman Gray also was the locale for this year\u2019s preseason NASCAR Cup Series exhibition event in early February.\nBrewer\u2019s first career start at the oval came in 1990, and he made nearly 260 starts in the Sportsman Division, winning the points championship in 2011, the newspaper reported.\nFellow Bowman Gray driver Brad Lewis, whose race shop is near where Brewer lived, said Brewer \u201cwas like a big brother to me even though we were not that far apart in age.\u201d\n\u201cHe was a wheelman through and through,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI\u2019m not only going to honor him the rest of the season but for as long as we race out there.

Our thoughts and prayers are with Robbie\u2019s family and friends at this time.\u201d\nBrewer made nearly 260 starts in his career in the Sportsman Division, according to track historian Justin Mincey. In 2011, he had his best season winning the points championship. In 2006, he was second in the rookie of the year voting in that division to Kenny Bost.\nHe was a consistent driver finishing in the top 10 in points in 10 of his 13 seasons. He had 11 wins overall, which placed him 36th all-time and he had 76 top five finishes.\nBrewer also made 28 starts in the Stadium Stock Division and made his first career start in June 1990.\nBrewer also raced at other tracks. In 2018 and 2019, he was the Caraway Speedway champion in the 602 Modified Division, according to Mincey. He had six featured wins in 2019 and over a span of those two seasons won 12 times at Caraway.\nSmith, who has been working at the stadium for 16 years, said Robbie had no enemies.\n\u201cHe was loved by everyone,\u201d Smith said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is one person that can say anything bad about Robbie.
