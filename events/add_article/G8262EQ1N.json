      "summary": "Rob Kaplan, Vice Chairman at Goldman Sachs, emphasized the need for an independent Fed chair who can make data‑driven decisions amid political pressure. He highlighted that inflation remains above target while growth is sluggish, partly due to tariff uncertainty and a shrinking labor supply. Kaplan predicts a cautious approach to rate cuts, likely starting with a single September cut and evaluating each meeting individually. He also noted structural drivers such as data center power demand could help moderate inflation over time.",
