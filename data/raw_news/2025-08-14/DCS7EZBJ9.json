He wasn\u2019t violating the law. He had a right to be walking on that street,\u201d said Kristin Howell, Oliver\u2019s defense attorney.\n\u2022 None Arrest made in murder of Fulton County deputy found shot to death inside crashed car\n\u2022 None Man accused of killing 24-year-old Fulton deputy offered plea deal to avoid going to trial\n\u2022 None \u2018They just rolled up on him:\u2019 Witnesses say Fulton deputy shot to death was ambushed\n\u2022 None \u2018My world is upside down:\u2019 Father of murdered Fulton County deputy remembers his son at ceremony\n\n\u201cWe are not the wild, wild west.
