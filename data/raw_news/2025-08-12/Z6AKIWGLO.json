  "description": "August 15, 2025, marks four years of the Taliban regime, after the fall of Kabul in 2021. The four years of the Taliban regime have been marked by human rights...",
  "content": "August 15, 2025, marks four years of the Taliban regime, after the fall of Kabul in 2021. The four years of the Taliban regime have been marked by human rights violations on a mass scale, with women and girls and religious minorities being removed from society, piece by piece, one way or another. Women and girls are subjected to what can only be described as gender apartheid, defined as \u201ca system of governance, based on laws and/or policies, which imposes systematic segregation of women and men and may also systematically exclude women from public spaces and spheres.\u201d Religious minorities, on the other hand, are subjected to religious persecution, with the Hazara facing genocidal atrocities. Against this backdrop, Russia formally recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government, and others, including China, are looking to do the same.\n\nThe last four years have seen a litany of decrees being adopted by the Taliban, which resulted in women and girls being banned from education, employment, positions of power, movement, and virtually any activities outside their homes. The Law on the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice further added and affirmed these restrictions, effectively removing women and girls from society and silencing their voices.\n\nTo exacerbate the situation, the enforcement of the decrees and laws has been arbitrary, with the authorities going above and beyond the restrictive provisions, thus adding to the suffering of women and girls in the country. Among others, in July 2025, the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) reported how the de facto authorities\u2019 monitoring of women\u2019s adherence to the hijab instruction appeared to intensify in some parts of the country. UNAMA indicated that \u201cProvincial de facto Departments for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice are applying the mahram requirement in ways not clearly specified by the Law on Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice or other instructions issued by the de facto Ministry.\u201d This included reports of de facto Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice inspectors instructing health clinics, shops, markets, government offices and taxi drivers to deny services to women not accompanied by a mahram. UNAMA further reported that \u201cdozens of UN female national staff were subjected to explicit death threats from unidentified individuals in relation to their work with UNAMA and other UN agencies, funds and programs, requiring the UN to implement interim measures to protect their safety.\u201d An investigation by the de facto Ministry of Interior is said to be underway.\n\nThe situation of women and girls in the country is expected to further deteriorate. In August 2025, the UN Women, CARE International and other partners published a gender alert amid a surge in returnees to Afghanistan. Women and girls account for a third of returnees from Iran so far this year, and about half of those coming from Pakistan. The gender alert raised the issue that, as women and girls in Afghanistan more broadly, but also the returnees in particular, face increased risks of poverty, early marriage, violence, exploitation and unprecedented restrictions on their rights, movements and freedoms. The returnees are additionally vulnerable as they arrive with little protection and support. They often would not have the \u201cappropriate\u201d clothes or hijab to wear, no food to eat, no contact number and no relatives to stay with. Those traveling without a mahram \u2013 a male guardian \u2013 face particular risks. The UN also reported cases of extortion, harassment and threats of violence at border crossings. However, as the U.N. warns, the real challenge is still ahead, as millions of others are to be returned to Afghanistan, adding to some 22.9 million people \u2013 close to half the population - in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nFour years of the Taliban in power had a devastating effect on religious minorities in the country. Some of the smallest minorities were evacuated as the Taliban was taking over Afghanistan in August 2021, with some members going underground. Larger groups, unable to be evacuated, such as the Hazara, have been subjected to years of persecution and targeted with bombings and attacks on their schools, hospitals, and Shia mosques, among others. While IS-KP claimed responsibility for most of them, the Taliban, as the de facto authorities, failed to prevent such attacks and ensure that those responsible faced justice. The serious risk faced by the community continues to be unaddressed.\n\nThe four years of the Taliban regime have seen many more human rights violations affecting the Afghan society as a whole. All these violations have been reported by multiple sources, including United Nations bodies. Despite this, Russia formally recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government. In order to do so, Russia had to remove the designation of the Taliban as a terror organization. China is looking to do the same. States must be warned that recognizing the Taliban despite its sheer disregard for human rights standards, segregating and removing women from society, and accommodating the persecution of religious minorities cannot be accepted in the 21st century without making them complicit in the violations.",

      "text": "Afghan women and girls face increased risks of poverty, early marriage, harassment and exploitation amid a surge in returns to the country\nIn a new report, UN Women, CARE International and partners urge long-term support for women and girls.\nKabul, 7 August \u2013 Afghan women and girl returnees from Iran and Pakistan urgently need immediate humanitarian assistance and sustained support to rebuild their lives in communities already under severe economic and environmental pressure, UN Women and CARE have warned. Since September 2023, more than 2.43 million undocumented Afghans have returned \u2013 many forcibly \u2013 from Iran and Pakistan. Women and girls represent one-third of returnees from Iran so far in 2025, and about half of all returnees from Pakistan.\nMany return to a country they have never lived in, arriving with no home, no income and no access to education or healthcare. Afghanistan is already facing an economic crisis and climate shocks. Like all women and girls in Afghanistan, returnee women and girls face increased risks of poverty, early marriage, violence, exploitation and unprecedented restrictions on their rights, movements and freedoms.\n\u201cVulnerable women and girls arriving with nothing into communities that are already stretched to breaking point puts them at even greater risk,\u201d said UN Women Afghanistan Special Representative Susan Ferguson. \u201cThey are determined to rebuild with dignity, but we need more funding to provide the dedicated support they need and to ensure women humanitarian workers are there to reach them.\u201d\nThe new report from the Afghanistan Gender in Humanitarian Action Working Group \u2013 a humanitarian working group co-chaired by UN Women and CARE International \u2013 highlights the urgent and long-term needs of these women and girls:\nSafe and affordable shelter, livelihoods and girls\u2019 education are what women most frequently name as immediate needs. Only 10 per cent of women-headed households live in a permanent shelter, while nearly four in ten fear eviction. Women-headed households and single women face some of the greatest barriers to access humanitarian assistance due to movement restrictions, safety risks and lack of documentation. Girls are losing access to education as all girls are banned from secondary school in Afghanistan. Women humanitarian workers at the border are critical to reaching women and girls. But their work is increasingly limited by foreign aid cuts and movement restrictions. Massive cuts in international funding have severely weakened the capacity of humanitarian organizations to respond. At border crossings, women humanitarian workers report being overwhelmed by the volume of arrivals and being unable to meet even their basic needs.\n\u201cWitnessing the volume of arrivals and the hardship faced by women, children and families \u2013 many distressed, disoriented and without hope \u2013 has left a deep impact on all of us responding to this crisis,\u201d said Graham Davison, CARE Afghanistan Director. \u201cThis is what our teams on the ground are seeing every day. We urgently need support to provide basic services, safe spaces and protection for returnee women and girls.\u201d\nAfghanistan is already facing one of the world\u2019s most severe humanitarian crises, driven by decades of conflict, poverty and natural disasters. The latest wave of returns threatens to push already fragile communities even further into crisis.\nWe urge the international community to act now \u2013 protect the rights of Afghan women and girls and invest in the women humanitarians who work tirelessly on the frontlines to support them."

      "text": "Afghanistan: Condemnation for new Taliban \u2018virtue and vice\u2019 order targeting women\nA new morality law enacted by the Taliban in Afghanistan, cements policies that \u201ccompletely erase\u201d women\u2019s presence in public, the UN human rights office, OHCHR, said on Tuesday, calling for it to be immediately revoked.\nThe \u201cLaw on the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice\u201d silences women\u2019s voices and deprives them of their autonomy, \u201ceffectively attempting to render them into faceless, voiceless shadows\u201d, said Ravina Shamdasani, OHCHR\u2019s Chief Spokesperson.\n\u201cThis is utterly intolerable,\u201d she stressed.\n\u201cWe call on the de facto authorities to immediately repeal this legislation, which is in clear violation of Afghanistan\u2019s obligations under international human rights law.\u201d\nRepressive, vague provisions\nThe law adopted last week imposes a lengthy list of repressive provisions on women, including mandates that they wear clothing covering their entire bodies, bans on their voices being heard in public, and further restrictions on their movement without a male relative.\nEven the sound of a female voice outside the home is apparently deemed a moral violation.\nIt also requires men to grow beards, bans drivers from playing music, and restricts the media from publishing images of people. State agents are granted broad powers to detain individuals and impose punishments.\nMs. Shamdasani emphasized that disempowering and rendering Afghan women and girls invisible will only worsen the human rights and humanitarian crisis in the country.\n\u201cRather, this is a time to bring together all the people of Afghanistan, irrespective of their gender, religion or ethnicity, to help resolve the many challenges the country faces,\u201d she urged.\n\u2018Distressing vision\u2019 for the future\nThe UN\u2019s top envoy to Afghanistan, Roza Otunbayeva, also denounced the new law, describing it a \u201cdistressing vision\u201d for the country\u2019s future.\n\u201cAfter decades of war and in the midst of a terrible humanitarian crisis, the Afghan people deserve much better than being threatened or jailed if they happen to be late for prayers, glance at a member of the opposite sex who is not a family member, or possess a photo of a loved one,\u201d she said in a statement.\nCitizens, not subjects to be disciplined\nMs. Otunbayeva added that the international community \u201chad been seeking, in good faith\u201d to constructively engage with the Taliban.\n\u201cThe world wants to see Afghanistan on the path of peace and prosperity, where all Afghans have a stake in their future, are citizens with rights and not just subjects to be disciplined.\u201d\nShe emphasized that further restricting the rights of the Afghans and holding them in constant fear will make achieving that goal \u201ceven harder\u201d."

      "text": "Russia becomes first state to recognise Afghanistan's Taliban government\n- Published\nRussia has become the first country to formally recognise the Taliban government in Afghanistan, sparking outrage from opposition figures.\nThe decision marks a major milestone for the Taliban almost four years after they swept into Kabul and took power.\nForeign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said he hoped it would serve as an example to other countries, which have been reluctant to recognise a regime which implements a version of Sharia law along with severe restrictions on women and girls.\nOthers have decried the move, with former Afghan politician Fawzia Koofi saying \"any move by any country to normalise relations with the Taliban will not bring peace it will legitimise impunity\".\nKoofi went on to warn \"such steps risk endangering not just the people of Afghanistan, but global security\".\nMeanwhile, the Afghan Women's Political Participation Network said it legitimised \"a regime that is authoritarian, anti-women, and actively dismantling basic civil rights\".\nThe Taliban government has previously said it respects women's rights in accordance with their interpretation of Afghan culture and Islamic law.\nBut since 2021, girls over the age of 12 have been prevented from getting an education, and women from many jobs. There have also been restrictions on how far a woman can travel without a male chaperone, and decrees on them raising their voices in public.\nForeign Minister Muttaqi said Moscow's recognition, which came on Thursday, was \"a new phase of positive relations, mutual respect, and constructive engagement\", describing the decision as \"courageous\".\nRussia's foreign ministry said it saw the potential for \"commercial and economic\" co-operation in \"energy, transportation, agriculture and infrastructure\", and that it would continue to help Kabul to fight against the threats of terrorism and drug trafficking.\nRussia was one of very few countries that did not close down their embassy in Afghanistan in 2021 - as the Taliban swept across Afghanistan following the withdrawal of US troop.\nThe country was also the first to sign an international economic deal with the Taliban in 2022, where they agreed to supply oil, gas and wheat to Afghanistan.\nThe Taliban was removed from Russia's list of terrorist organisations in April this year.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin also referred to the Taliban as an \"ally\" in fighting terrorism in July last year. Taliban representatives had visited Moscow for talks as early as 2018.\nHowever, the two countries have a complex history. The Soviet Union - which included Russia - invaded Afghanistan in 1979 and fought a nine-year war that cost them 15,000 personnel.\nTheir decision to install a Soviet-backed government in Kabul turned the Soviets into an international pariah, and eventually led to their withdrawal in February 1989.\nIn its statement, the Afghan Women's Political Participation Network noted it had not forgotten \"Russia's role in the destruction of Afghanistan during the Soviet invasion\".\n\"Today, its political interference and direct support for the Taliban represent a continuation of those same destructive strategies, now under the banner of diplomacy,\" it said.\n- Published21 August 2021\nDr Rangin Dadfar Spanta, a former Afghan national security adviser under the preceding Western-backed government, described Russia's decision as \"regrettable\", adding: \"This is just the beginning; in the absence of widespread resistance, others will follow Russia.\"\nStrict sanctions were placed on Afghanistan in 2021 by the United Nations Security Council, most notably the freezing of approximately $9bn (\u00a36.6bn) in assets.\nThe UN has said the rules impacting women amount to \"gender apartheid\", while also reporting public floggings and brutal attacks on former government officials.\nWhile the Taliban government is widely not recognised by other countries, Germany's interior minister wants to work with Afghanistan to resume deportations of convicted Afghan criminals.\nGermany initially stopped deportations following the Taliban's return to power.\nAlexander Dobrindt on Thursday said he wants to make \"agreements directly with Afghanistan to enable deportations\".\nOn Friday, a UN Human Rights Office spokeswoman said it was \"not appropriate\" to return people to Afghanistan on the account of the Taliban \"documenting continuing human rights violations\".\nMost countries closed their embassies after 2021. However, China, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Pakistan all have designated ambassadors to Kabul."

However, \u201cfunding cuts have sharply eroded staff mahram support in the provinces of Kandahar and Nangarhar, leaving provision inconsistent, delayed, or absent altogether,\u201d the report said.\nThe funding cuts have severely weakened the capacity of humanitarian organizations to respond, and women humanitarian workers at border points report that they are overwhelmed by the sheer number of arrivals and being unable to meet even their basic needs.\n\u2018Distressed, disoriented and without hope\u2019\n\u201cWitnessing the volume of arrivals and the hardship faced by women, children and families \u2013 many distressed, disoriented and without hope \u2013 has left a deep impact on all of us responding to this crisis,\u201d said Graham Davison, CARE Afghanistan Director.\nHe underscored the urgent need for support to provide basic services, safe spaces and protection for women and girl returnees.\nThe report noted that Afghanistan is already facing one of the world\u2019s most dire humanitarian crises, driven by decades of conflict, poverty and natural disasters.\nAs this latest wave of returns threatens to push already fragile communities further into crisis, the partners urged the international community to act now to protect the rights of Afghan women and girls and to invest in the women humanitarians who support them.\nArafat Jamal, the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) Representative in Afghanistan, recently spoke about the surge in returnees from Iran.\nRecord number of returns\nSeparately, the International Organization for Migration (IOM) also called for international support as Afghanistan confronts \u201cone of the largest return movements in recent history.\u201d\nReturnee numbers are on track to increase as one million more Afghans are expected to return from Pakistan following the Government\u2019s decision not to extend their stay.\nIOM operates four reception centres at major border crossings in Afghanistan, including Islam Qala and Milak with Iran, and Torkham and Spin Boldak with Pakistan.\nThe UN agency is appealing for additional funding to scale up its response to address growing needs at the borders and in areas of return."

  "argos_summary": "As of August 15, 2025, the Taliban regime in Afghanistan has been marked by severe human rights violations, particularly against women and girls, who face gender apartheid and systematic exclusion from public life. The situation has worsened with a surge in returnees from Iran and Pakistan, where women and girls are particularly vulnerable to poverty, early marriage, and violence, exacerbated by arbitrary enforcement of restrictive laws. Despite these conditions, Russia has recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government, raising concerns about complicity in ongoing human rights abuses.",
