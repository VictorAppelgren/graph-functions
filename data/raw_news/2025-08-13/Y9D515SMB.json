  "content": "OpenArt, founded in 2022 by two former Google employees, now powers a viral AI craze that transforms wild ideas, such as a shark wearing sneakers or a ballerina with a cappuccino head, into \"brainrot\" videos with a single click, and the platform already has roughly 6 million monthly active users, TechCrunch reports.\n\nThe company's new \"one-click story\" feature, launched in open beta, lets users turn a single input, whether a sentence, a script, or even a song, into a one-minute video with a complete story arc, for everything from a lighthearted TikTok clip to a serious explainer or YouTube music video, even advertising. TechCrunch says that creators can select from three templates: Character Vlog, Music Video, or Explainer, to build their video story.\n\u2022 The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market \u2014 and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n\u2022 \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\n\nCharacter Vlog starts by uploading an image of your character and entering a prompt. According to TechCrunch, uploading a song allows the AI to parse the lyrics and create an animated story aligned with the music, such as illustrating flowers blooming, all automatically.\n\nUsers can refine their projects by returning to a storyboard mode and tweaking prompts for individual clips. TechCrunch says that OpenArt aggregates over 50 AI models, including DALLE-3, GPT, Imagen, Flux Kontext, and Stable Diffusion, giving creators control over the tools behind each production.\n\nOpenArt emphasizes that one of its defining strengths is keeping characters visually consistent throughout an entire video, a challenge many AI tools struggle to address. Rather than leaving creators with disconnected clips that must be manually stitched into a story, TechCrunch says the platform is designed to maintain both visual and narrative flow from start to finish.\n\nTrending: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\n\"A problem that a lot of AI couldn't really handle well is to have the character consistent in the same video\u2026If you don't have the same character, then it's hard to get immersed in the story,\" OpenArt co-founder and CEO Coco Mao told TechCrunch.\n\nMao added that when users upload protected IP characters, \"by default, the models we use will reject them, and it's not able to produce the IP character, but sometimes it slips.\" Mao said they are open to licensing discussions with major IP holders.\n\nTechCrunch reports that Character Vlog prompts featuring characters like Pikachu, SpongeBob, and Super Mario may raise legal risk. If a video infringes copyright, it may be removed and the creator held liable, potentially facing legal action from rights holders.\n\nSee Also: Bill Gates Warned About Water Scarcity. This Award-Winning Device Just Might Fix It \u2014 And You Can Invest Early\n\nCredit-Based Pricing, $5 Million in Funding, On Track for $20 Million Revenue Run Rate\n\nOpenArt uses a credit-based subscription model, TechCrunch says. The basic plan is $14 per month for 4,000 credits, which include up to four One-Click stories, 40 videos, 4,000 images, and four characters.\n\nFor $29 per month, users can access 12,000 credits, including up to 12 One-Click stories. The \"Infinite\" plan costs $56 per month for 24,000 credits. There is also a team plan available at $35 per month per member.\n\nTo date, OpenArt has raised $5 million in funding from Basis Set Ventures and DCM Ventures. The company says it is generating positive cash flow and expects to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $20 million.\n\nRead Next: Kevin O'Leary Says Real Estate's Been a Smart Bet for 200 Years \u2014 This Platform Lets Anyone Tap Into It",

      "text": "Benzinga Money is a reader-supported publication. We may earn a commission from the advertisers associated with this article. Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nThree of the same VC firms that backed Uber, Venmo, and eBay, respectively, are all investing in another private company: Pacaso.\nVenture backing in companies like Pacaso is nothing new. After all, early-stage companies often have the potential to deliver the most outsized returns.\nBut, recent regulatory updates have opened the door for individual investors to invest alongside these venture capitalists. Normally, everyday investors have to wait for a company to go public before they can invest, missing out on that early gain potential. Now, some companies are opening up investment opportunities to the public.\nThis type of investing has already seen some great success stories. For example, in 2016, 433 people invested an average of $2,730 in a private startup named Revolut. Fast-forward to today, those $2,730 stakes are worth over $1 million, up 89,900%.\nToday, thousands of investors have joined big-name VCs in taking a chance on Pacaso. It's no surprise, considering Pacaso's resum\u00e9:\n- The company has made $110M in gross profits to date\n- Pacaso's co-founder sold his last company to Zillow for $120M\n- They operate in over 40 vacation destinations across the US, Mexico, UK, and France\n- The company reserved the Nasdaq ticker PCSO\nBut the growth potential is where the excitement is. Below we'll reveal more about how Pacaso has ramped up and built a competitive moat so quickly, and how you can share in their growth.\nNext-Generation Co-Ownership\nAfter his $120M exit and subsequent role as a Zillow executive, Austin Allison created Pacaso\u2019s game-changing co-ownership model. Powered by proprietary tech and an innovative structure that eliminates the headaches of traditional vacation home ownership, it\u2019s already leaving a mark. Here\u2019s how:\n- Seamless Transactions: Clients easily buy, finance, and resell, shares of luxury homes through Pacaso\u2019s intuitive platform\n- Turnkey Ownership: Pacaso handles maintenance, scheduling, and furnishing; owners simply enjoy their vacation homes\n- Maximized Value: Homes that once sat empty up to 90% of the year now stay occupied nearly year-round, benefiting owners and local economies\nThe demand for their services and expertise is real. In top destinations, co-ownership is growing 21% annually in the US, and Pacaso homes have appreciated nearly 10% since 2021 \u2013 roughly double the growth of the broader luxury market.\nScaling Into 10 New International Destinations\nPacaso is already leading the charge in the $1.3 trillion US vacation home market, combining real estate innovation with tech-driven efficiency to generate multiple revenue streams. These include transaction service fees on every sale, recurring property management fees, and exclusive financing options tailored to co-owners.\nNow, the platform\u2019s global reach is growing quickly, and they\u2019re already seeing strong returns in the $500B global market. In 2024, they set records in Paris and London. Meanwhile, Cabo (Mexico) is the #3-most-searched destination on their platform. No surprise Europe and Mexico have accounted for 22% of their revenue over the past two years.\nNow, they\u2019re taking international expansion to an entirely new level. They recently announced 10 new international destinations will be added to their platform, spread across Italy, the Caribbean, and Mexico. That means Pacaso\u2019s unique model is poised to dominate a combined $1.8T in vacation home markets.\nWhy Investors Are Paying Attention\nThere are many reasons why firms managing a combined $180B+ in assets, and 10,000+ individual investors have already backed Pacaso, including:\n- Proven Leadership: Allison is joined by executives with decades of real-estate and startup experience.\n- Strong Growth Metrics: Full-year 2024 financials showed a 21% YoY increase in gross real estate volume and a 24% improvement in adjusted EBITDA.\n- Surging Demand: 40% of Americans want to buy a vacation home in the next year (Coldwell Banker)\nAfter impressive full-year earnings showed gross profit grew 41%, and with continued growth and expansion ahead, Pacaso is really hitting their stride.\nPacaso is offering securities through the use of an Offering Statement that has been qualified by the Securities and Exchange Commission under Tier II of Regulation A. A copy of the Final Offering Circular that forms a part of the Offering Statement may be obtained from: invest.pacaso.com. Reserving the ticker symbol is not a guarantee that the company will go public.

      "text": "Vercept, a Seattle-based AI startup, has secured $16 million in seed funding to develop Vy, a computer vision-powered Mac application designed to automate digital workflows with a single natural language command, GeekWire reports.\nThe company was founded by a group of former leaders from the Allen Institute for AI, and according to GeekWire, its backers include some of the most prominent names in tech, such as former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, Google DeepMind chief scientist Jeff Dean, Dropbox DBX co-founder Arash Ferdowsi, and Cruise founder Kyle Vogt.\nDon't Miss:\n- Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 this is your last chance to become an investor for $0.80 per share.\n- \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share with a $1000 minimum.\nThe round was led by San Francisco-based venture firm Fifty Years, with participation from Point Nine and the AI2 Incubator, which was Vercept's first institutional investor, GeekWire says.\nVy Uses Vision AI To Mimic Human Computer Interaction\nVercept's flagship product, Vy, uses artificial intelligence to \"see\" and interpret screens the way a human does, allowing it to replicate complex workflows after observing them once, GeekWire reports.\nAccording to the company\u2019s website, Vercept was founded with the goal of radically rethinking how people interact with technology, aiming to replace the maze of menus and code-heavy workflows with a seamless, intuitive interface that feels like an extension of the user's mind.\nThe company describes its mission as enabling users to do more with less effort, tackling tasks that were once considered too technical or time-consuming to attempt. Users can perform any digital task, such as filling out forms, organizing invoices, or creating content, while Vy records the actions, and then it automates those same tasks using natural language commands.\nTrending: Invest where it hurts \u2014 and help millions heal: Invest in Cytonics and help disrupt a $390B Big Pharma stronghold.\nUnlike traditional robotic process automation tools, GeekWire says that Vy does not require pre-built application programming interfaces, connectors, or hardcoded steps to engage with software. Vercept CEO Kiana Ehsani told GeekWire that the product is a \u201cunified paradigm for interacting with the computer.\u201d\nFounding Team Brings Elite AI Pedigree\nEhsani previously led robotics and embodied AI projects at Ai2, while other Vercept co-founders include Oren Etzioni, the founding CEO of Ai2, and Matt Deitke, who worked on prominent AI projects like Molmo, ProcTHOR, and Objaverse, GeekWire reports.\nLuca Weihs, another co-founder, was a research manager and infrastructure lead at Ai2, focusing on AI agents and reinforcement learning.

In one example, GeekWire reports that individuals with disabilities have integrated Vy with speech-to-text systems, allowing them to remotely operate computers and complete digital tasks independently.\nWhile user growth and revenue figures were not disclosed, Ehsani told GeekWire that the reception to Vy has exceeded expectations. Vercept currently employs eight full-time staff members.\nAs major tech players like OpenAI, Google, and Amazon AMZN explore generative AI tools for task automation, GeekWire says that Vercept is differentiating itself with a visual-first solution that requires no technical setup or custom coding.\nRead Next:\n- Are you rich?

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nFirst-time real estate investors can face several hurdles when trying to get started: high upfront costs, dealing with tenants and maintenance, finding and closing on a suitable property, and the fear that your initial investment won\u2019t see a return, just to name a few.\nNow, there\u2019s a company that handles all the grunt work and provides a money-back guarantee on your initial investment.\nIntroducing mogul, the simplest way to own income-producing blue chip real estate.\nFounded by former Goldman Sachs executives who have closed more than $10 billion in deals, they handle the sourcing, underwriting, and day-to-day management of every property.\nTo remove first-time jitters, mogul gives new investors their First-$10k Protection Guarantee: If your initial investment of up to $10,000 loses value in the first year, mogul refunds every lost dollar.\nInvestors in mogul portfolios have earned an average annualized return of 18.8%, paid out as monthly rental income plus appreciation.\nStart building a diversified property portfolio in minutes while mogul absorbs the downside.\n\u2018If we ever brag about a 4% IRR, I will quit\u2019\nAlex Blackwood and Joey Gumataotao, mogul\u2019s co-founders, routinely surpassed 15-20% annual returns when closing deals at Goldman Sachs. When they looked at other real estate investment platforms at the time, they found those companies would often brag to those investors about 4% annual returns on billions of dollars.\nAs Alex says on mogul\u2019s website, \u201cIf we ever brag about a 4% IRR, I will quit immediately.\u201d\nTo date, properties in mogul\u2019s portfolio have generated an average 10-12% annual cash-on-cash yield that hit users\u2019 accounts as rent dividends each month. When long-term appreciation is included, historical performance rises to an 18.8% annualized returns, giving investors both regular income and capital growth\nPart of their success is due to the fact that mogul mogul approves fewer than one percent of properties reviewed. Each candidate asset must clear a 12% bear case hurdle rate before moving to the next level of diligence.\nYou can browse eligible properties on mogul\u2019s website and buy part or all of a house in under 30 seconds, or use the same data and tools available to top real estate firms to underwrite any property across the U.S.\nRent collections are aggregated and distributed to investors every month. At the same time, independent third-party valuations refresh inside your dashboard, letting you watch equity climb in real time while still enjoying depreciation and other pass-through tax advantages unique to real estate.\nMore than $1.2 million was invested on mogul last month.\nDisclaimers\nPlease be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

      "text": "AI-generated \u201cbrain rot\u201d videos are popping up all over the internet and getting a lot of attention. Currently gaining traction among younger users, these clips feature wild characters, like a shark wearing sneakers and a ballerina with a cappuccino for a head.\nOne startup driving this trend is OpenArt, founded by two former Google employees in 2022. It touts around 6 million monthly active users.\nThe company recently launched a new \u201cone-click story\u201d feature in open beta, which allows users to input a single sentence, a script, or even a song and turn it into a one-minute video with a story arc. This can include anything from a light-hearted story for TikTok to more serious content like explainer videos or music videos for YouTube. OpenArt even envisions this feature being used for advertising.\nWith One-Click Story, there are three templates to choose from: Character Vlog, Music Video, or Explainer. For a character vlog, users start by uploading an image of their character and entering a prompt. If a song is uploaded, the software understands the lyrics and creates an animation that aligns with the song\u2019s themes, like illustrating flowers blooming in a garden.\nUsers can edit individual clips by revisiting the editor\u2019s storyboard mode and tweaking prompts for a more refined result. The platform aggregates over 50 AI models, allowing users to choose their preferred tools, such as DALLE-3, GPT, Imagen, Flux Kontext, and Stable Diffusion.\nThe goal of the new feature is to further lower the barrier for becoming an AI creator, a medium that remains immensely popular despite ongoing controversy.\nWhile these tools can be beneficial \u2014 like using video generators to quickly produce content with original characters and narratives \u2014 there are numerous ethical issues to address. These include imitating other artists\u2019 styles, intellectual property rights, and the dangers of misuse and creating misinformation.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $600+ before prices rise.\nTech and VC heavyweights join the Disrupt 2025 agenda\nNetflix, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital \u2014 just a few of the heavy hitters joining the Disrupt 2025 agenda. They\u2019re here to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge. Don\u2019t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch Disrupt, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech \u2014 grab your ticket now and save up to $675 before prices rise.\nDuring testing, we noticed that the Character Vlog option may tread into a grey legal area due to the types of characters it offers \u2014 such as Pikachu, SpongeBob, and Super Mario \u2014 which could pose risks of intellectual property (IP) infringement. In June, Disney and Universal sued AI firm Midjourney over AI-generated images.\nUsers should be aware that if their videos are found to infringe another\u2019s copyright, the video may be taken off social media platforms, and if the user is found to have contributed to the infringement, they can potentially be held liable under copyright law, which can result in legal action from the copyright holder.\n\u201cWe try to be cautious around the IP infringement,\u201d Coco Mao, co-founder and CEO, told TechCrunch. \u201cWhen you upload some IP characters, by default, the models we use will reject them, and it\u2019s not able to produce the IP character, but sometimes it slips.\u201d\nMao added that the company is open to talking to major IP holders to get licensing for characters.\nOne aspect that OpenArt believes sets it apart is its ability to maintain character consistency. It argues that, unlike the average video model that often relies on simple, standalone clips that users have to piece together into a cohesive story, OpenArt aims to ensure that both the visuals and the narrative remain consistent.\n\u201cA problem that a lot of AI couldn\u2019t really handle well is to have the character consistent in the same video\u2026If you don\u2019t have the same character, then it\u2019s hard to get immersed in the story,\u201d Mao said.\nLooking ahead, the company plans to iterate on the one-click feature by allowing users to create videos featuring conversations between two different characters. Another plan on the roadmap is developing a mobile app.\nOpenArt operates on a credit-based system. It offers four plans, with the most basic costing $14 per month for 4,000 credits, which includes up to four One-Click stories, 40 videos, 4,000 images, and four characters. The advanced plan costs $30 per month for 12,000 credits and includes up to 12 One-Click stories. The Infinite plan is priced at $56 per month for 24,000 credits, and there is also a team plan available for $35/month per member.\nOpenArt has raised $5 million in funding to date from Basis Set Ventures and DCM Ventures, and it boasts a positive cash flow. Additionally, the company said it\u2019s on track to achieve an annual revenue rate of over $20 million.\nThis story was updated with an updated number of MAUs."

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nYou see a shocking number of ads daily \u2013 researchers estimate between 6,000 and 10,000 and 375 to 625 per waking hour. In the modern age, most of them come from social media apps whose entire business model revolves around constantly showing you ads and keeping 100% of the revenue. But what if users got a share? That company might just grow its revenue by 32,481% in three years, help users earn and save $325 million and be named Deloitte's fastest-growing software company in North America. That\u2019s what Mode Mobile did. You can still get in for just $0.30 per share.\nReaching Financial Stability One Tap at a Time\nMost Americans can\u2019t afford a $1,000 emergency bill. That means many are one car breakdown or ER visit away from serious financial trouble. There's no quick fix to such a big financial challenge that over 50% of Americans face. However, it's safe to bet that the masses will flock to any good solutions. Mode Mobile created one such solution years ago by allowing people to earn money doing what they already spend a third of their waking hours on \u2013 tapping, scrolling and looking at their smartphone screens.\nMode Mobile developed a smartphone called EarnPhone, which allows users to earn and save money by playing video games, listening to music and reading the news. With the phone priced at an affordable $99, the barriers to adoption are low. However, users can earn income on their existing devices as well. This extreme competitiveness has allowed Mode Mobile to attract over 50 million registered beta users. Launching the finalized version could bring in millions more, helping the company reach its goal of $150 million in annual revenue within three years.\n6,955,000,000 Users to Go\nCurrently, seven billion smartphones worldwide provide functionality or entertainment but take all the profits. Mode Mobile\u2019s disruption offers the same benefits but allows users to earn money at a time when the prices of goods are skyrocketing. Just like Airbnb lets users earn extra cash by renting out their bedrooms and Uber allows users to make money on their rides back home from work, Mode Mobile wants to enable its users to make money from their phones. However, its total addressable market is much larger than Airbnb\u2019s and Uber\u2019s \u2013 currently at over $1 trillion.\nYou can invest in Mode Mobile at $0.30 per share with a minimum investment of $4,950. Plus, the company is offering the chance to earn up to 120% in bonus shares, if you invest more. All funding rounds open to non-accredited investors, including Mode Mobile\u2019s, are limited in time. So, if you\u2019d like to be part of the future it's building, consider acting soon.\nDisclaimer:\nAN OFFERING STATEMENT REGARDING THIS OFFERING HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE SEC. THE SEC HAS QUALIFIED THAT OFFERING STATEMENT, WHICH ONLY MEANS THAT THE COMPANY MAY MAKE SALES OF THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED BY THE OFFERING STATEMENT. THE OFFERING CIRCULAR THAT IS PART OF THAT OFFERING STATEMENT IS AVAILABLE HERE.\nMode Mobile recently received their ticker reservation with Nasdaq ($MODE), indicating an intent to IPO in the next 24 months. An intent to IPO is no guarantee that an actual IPO will occur.\nThe Deloitte rankings are based on submitted applications and public company database research, with winners selected based on their fiscal-year revenue growth percentage over a three-year period.\nDisclaimer: Please be advised that alternative investments carry a risk of monetary loss.

Read our Advertiser Discloser.\nCollect passive income from real estate without taking on the headaches of being a landlord. You can now take advantage of the higher-for-longer interest rate environment by investing in a portfolio of private real estate debt with as little as $100.\nThe explosion of private credit returns is unlikely to last forever, but currently, it\u2019s one of the hottest asset classes out there. In 2020, its total value stood at $1.04 trillion. Just three years later, it grew by a staggering 55% to reach $1.61 trillion. BlackRock expects it to climb up to $3.5 trillion by 2028. The IMF has recognized its spectacular returns in recent years. Bezos\u2019 darling real estate platform, which has completely disrupted the industry, now targets 7%-9% in annual cash dividends through private debt investing.\nPrivate Debt for All\nArrived has become a household investment platform that knows how to deliver passive investments. It has generated $5.6 million for its investors in dividends alone, and its user base continues to grow throughout market fluctuations. The company now boasts 614,000 registered investors who routinely snap up the shares of its carefully vetted offerings. Over the years, it has developed deep knowledge about what makes real estate markets tick. Now, using that knowledge to deliver 7%-9% for investors looking to diversify into real estate private debt through the Arrived Private Credit Fund.\nThis type of corporate credit offers relatively higher profits at lower risk as it's backed by real estate. If things go south, investors may be able to recoup their losses, depending on their position. Arrived uses a tried and tested fund mechanism to deliver passive income to the investors. It pools the funds and uses them to finance specific real estate projects that pay out monthly interest. It\u2019s targeting 7% to 9% returns after all fees and expenses. To achieve this goal across its loans, it approaches individual loans with the same scrutiny level as the homes.\nArrived's Q3 2024 report underscores the broader success of its investment strategy. During the quarter, investors earned over $1.54 million in dividend income, marking a 25% increase from Q2 2024. Across 354 individual properties, single-family residential investments averaged 3.7% annualized dividends, while vacation rentals provided an average return of 2.8%. These consistent results demonstrate the platform's ability to balance income and appreciation across its portfolio.\nLIMITED TIME FOR JUST $100\nThe Byers House\nOwn a piece of the Byers House, a vacation rental located at the iconic home of Joyce, Jonathan, and Will Byers, featured in Stranger Things and located in Fayetteville, GA, just 20 minutes from Hartsfield Jackson International Airport. This property was used to film the exterior scenes in the actual show and influenced the design for the interior sets, which were filmed in a nearby studio.\nDebt Acquisition Tactics\nArrived partners only with experienced professionals with a history of successful real estate projects and a spotless financial record. Sticking to this criterion mitigates the risk of delays, cost overruns, and other unpredictable problems that may arise.\nAdditionally, the platform only considers residential properties in the first loan position, which creates a thick protection barrier in the event of a downside. If the borrower fails to repay the loan, Arrived and its investors would be the first to get their investment back.\nLocation also plays an important factor. Just like with its fractional share offerings, Arrived uses a combination of data science and human expertise to pinpoint the most promising deals that come its way.\nA Way In\nPrivate credit was reserved only for high-net-worth individuals who could afford the astronomical investment minimums and fees. But with the Arrived Private Credit Fund, any investor, accredited or non-accredited, can acquire a stake in the fund with as little as $100 and receive monthly dividends.\nClick here to invest in the Arrived Private Credit Fund.\nCheck out the latest offerings on Arrived\nDiversify your portfolio with a mix of debt and equity real estate investments through Arrived's multiple offerings.\nHold on!\nInvestors are seeing outstanding returns through curated real estate investment alerts.

      "text": "Retirement, ideally a period of relaxation and enjoyment after years of hard work, is often envisioned as a time to pursue hobbies, travel or simply unwind. But without a solid financial plan, many Americans worry they\u2019ll outlive their money. This fear is often more acute among married couples, who face the added complexity of planning for two people with varying financial needs.\nIf you're 50 or older and have over $100,000 in investable assets, now is the time to take retirement planning seriously. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be difficult. WiserAdvisor's free tool matches you with a vetted financial advisor that meets your needs, with no obligation to hire.\n60% of Americans Lack a Retirement-Specific Account\u2013 Do you?\nA NerdWallet study, using the 2022 Survey of Consumer Finances, indicates that 60% of Americans lack a retirement-specific account. The disparity in average household retirement savings by age group further illustrates this issue:\n- Under 35: $49,130 (median: $18,880)\n- Ages 35 to 44: $141,520 (median: $45,000)\n- Ages 45 to 54: $313,220 (median: $115,000)\n- Ages 55 to 64: $537,560 (median: $185,000)\n- Ages 65 to 74: $609,230 (median: $200,000)\nThese figures show a significant gap between average and median savings, pointing to a broad spectrum of financial preparedness across different age groups. Those nearing retirement, especially those with $250,000 or more in retirement savings, stand to benefit most from expert, fiduciary guidance.\nTo guide couples in their retirement planning, T. Rowe Price, a reputable global investment management firm, provides savings benchmarks as multiples of income, varying by household income and marital status.\nFor example, a dual-income married couple with an annual income of $75,000 at age 55 should have retirement savings equal to five times their income, which should increase to 8.5 times by age 65. These benchmarks scale up for higher-income brackets, and for those with $250,000 or more in assets, strategic investment planning becomes especially important.\nFind a Vetted Financial Advisor\nIf you\u2019ve worked hard to build a nest egg of $100,000 or more, WiserAdvisor can connect you with a trusted, independent fiduciary advisor who understands the unique financial needs of pre-retirees and retirees.\nFiduciary advisors are legally required to put your interests first. They can help you:\n- Create a tax-smart drawdown plan\n- Manage and grow a diversified investment portfolio\n- Maximize Social Security strategies\n- Protect assets for your spouse or heirs\n- The matching service is fast and free\u2014and designed specifically for individuals with significant investable assets who are looking for personalized, high-quality advice.\nTake the first step toward a more confident retirement. If you have at least $100,000 in investable assets, WiserAdvisor can match you with a pre-screened fiduciary financial advisor in your area.\nBook here to get started; no cost, no obligation.\nBenzinga Money is a reader-supported publication.

      "text": "Cluely, the controversial AI startup originally built to help users \u201ccheat on everything,\" has raised $15 million in a new funding round led by venture capital powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz, co-founder Chungin \u201cRoy\u201d Lee announced on X on June 20.\nThe San Francisco-based company was co-founded by 21-year-old Lee, who rose to notoriety earlier this year after being suspended from Columbia University for launching an early version of the software, TechCrunch says. Cluely's other co-founder, Neel Shanmugam, also 21 and a former Columbia student, serves as the company's chief operating officer. Like Lee, Shanmugam faced disciplinary action at Columbia related to the AI tool. According to TechCrunch, both founders have since dropped out.\nDon't Miss:\n- GoSun's breakthrough rooftop EV charger already has 2,000+ units reserved \u2014 become an investor in this $41.3M clean energy brand today.\n- Invest early in CancerVax's breakthrough tech aiming to disrupt a $231B market. Back a bold new approach to cancer treatment with high-growth potential.\nOriginally called \"Interview Coder,\" the tool helped software engineers cheat on technical job interviews by providing real-time, AI-generated answers while the interview was in progress, TechCrunch says.\nAlthough Cluely has since scrubbed explicit references to cheating from its website, Business Insider reports that the platform still promotes itself as an \"undetectable\" AI assistant capable of viewing the user's screen and feeding answers in real-time during high-stakes conversations like interviews, exams, and sales calls.\nHow a Columbia Suspension Became a Springboard for Virality\nAccording to TechCrunch, Lee's suspension from Columbia accelerated his momentum. His viral online presence, often driven by controversial videos and stunts, has helped Cluely break through the noise in a crowded AI market.\nIn April, Cluely released a video in which Lee used the software to impress a woman on a date by pretending to know about art, wealth, and wine. The comedic tone turned heads across social media, but not everyone was amused, TechCrunch says.\nEarlier this week, the startup attempted to throw a massive after-party following Y Combinator's AI Startup School. According to TechCrunch, police intervened after 2,000 people flooded the venue and stopped the party.\nTrending: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\u2018Whatever It Takes\u2019: The Growth Plan Backed by Silicon Valley's Elite\nLee told Business Insider the company's top priority is achieving 1 billion total views across all social platforms. \"We'll do pretty much whatever it takes to do that,\" he said.\nThat ambition is reflected in the company's new hiring strategy. Cluely announced on LinkedIn that it will bring on 50 \"growth interns\" who will each be required to post four TikToks per day promoting the brand.\nAndreessen Horowitz partner Bryan Kim told Business Insider that Lee is a \"founder with the boldness to rethink what\u2019s possible,\" which highlights Andreessen Horowitz's support for Lee's unconventional vision. \u201cWe backed Roy early because he brings a rare mix of vision and fearlessness,\u201d Kim said.\nCluely's Future Includes Profitability, Pushback, and Potential\nCluely's $15 million Series A round follows a previous $5.3 million seed investment co-led by Abstract Ventures and Susa Ventures. Two unnamed investors told TechCrunch they believe the startup's current post-money valuation is approximately $120 million, although neither the company nor Andreessen Horowitz confirmed that figure.\nAccording to multiple posts from Lee on X and podcast appearances, Cluely is already profitable, TechCrunch says. Lee's provocative social media presence, including highly produced and often controversial videos, has played a key role in building brand awareness and driving public attention to Cluely.\nWhile Cluely's rapid rise has drawn praise for its bold marketing and attention-grabbing tactics, some reactions have been more critical. One of the company\u2019s launch videos was compared by viewers to the dystopian themes of \"Black Mirror,\" showcasing a broader tension between innovation and ethical boundaries in emerging AI tools, TechCrunch reports.\nSee Next:\n- $100k in assets?
