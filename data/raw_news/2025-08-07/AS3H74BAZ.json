This inaugural venture into electronic media supports the Bank's ongoing mission to reinvest in the communities it serves and deepen connections with customers across Long Island and the New York metropolitan area.\n\nThe campaign will air on top local radio stations WALK-FM, WBAB-FM, as well as top regional radio stations 1010 WINS, and WFAN, reaching a broad audience with messaging that highlights Hanover's customized service and community-first approach. Complementing this effort, geo-targeted audio ads will also run on SPOTIFY\u00ae, reaching listeners within a 10-mile radius of Hanover Bank branches.\n\n\"This campaign reflects more than just a message, it embodies our mission,\" said Michael P. Puorro, Chairman and CEO of Hanover Bank. \"It marks our first foray into broadcast and digital audio media, but more importantly it reflects our steadfast commitment to the communities we proudly serve. As we continue to grow and expand our footprint, including our recent branch opening in Port Jefferson, our core focus remains on delivering innovative, community-driven banking solutions that meet the needs of our local businesses and neighbors.\"\n\nThe campaign's launch comes on the heels of the Bank's continued physical expansion, with the new Port Jefferson branch now open, and additional branches in active planning stages.\n\n\"Launching our first radio and digital audio campaign is an exciting milestone for Hanover Bank,\" said Annette Esposito, First Vice President \u2013 Director of Marketing for Hanover Bank. \"This initiative goes beyond building brand awareness, it's an opportunity to share our story: who we are, where we're headed, and how we're growing alongside the communities we serve. It also reinforces Hanover Bank's position as a presence in both existing and new markets.\"\n\nHanover Bank invites new and existing customers to visit a local branch, tune in to the campaign, and experience the difference between a bank that invests in people and communities, not just portfolios.\n\nAbout Hanover Community Bank and Hanover Bancorp, Inc.\n\nHanover Bancorp, Inc.
