      "feedback": "**Feedback & Actionable Edits**\n\n1. **Canonical Handle Mapping**  \n   - The draft currently references mortgage rates but does not map the view to a canonical handle. Add an explicit mapping such as:  \n     `ust10y: +6.5 % → +7.5 %` (i.e., long‑term U.S. Treasury yields will rise in line with mortgage rates).  \n   - Include the sign (+) and the magnitude range in the text.\n\n2. **Catalyst Window & Causal Path**  \n   - Keep the mention of the September 16‑17, 2025 Fed meeting as the key catalyst.  \n   - Explicitly state the causal link: “Fed’s policy meeting → potential change in the Fed funds rate → shift in long‑term rates (ust10y) → mortgage rates.”  \n\n3. **Conciseness & Structure**  \n   - Trim repetitive sentences.  \n   - Present the base case, risks, and watch list in a bullet or short‑paragraph format to match the “action over prose” style.  \n\n4. **Citation Density**  \n   - All claims are already cited to (LF0UUL917). Keep this but ensure each sentence that introduces a new claim still references the source.\n\n5. **Compliance with Acceptance Gate**  \n   - After adding the canonical handle mapping, the draft will satisfy the “≥1 canonical handle with explicit sign and magnitude” requirement.  \n\n**Revised Core Paragraph (example)**  \n\n> **Base case (2025‑2028):** Long‑term U.S. Treasury yields (ust10y) will trend upward to 6.5 % → 7.5 %, mirroring mortgage rates that have hovered near 7 % since the Fed’s September 2024 cuts.  \n> **Catalyst (Sept 16‑17 2025):** Fed policy meeting – a change in the fed funds rate or balance‑sheet pace will shift ust10y and mortgage rates.  \n> **Risks:**  \n> 1. Fed rate hike → higher ust10y → higher mortgage rates.  \n> 2. Inflation spike → lenders raise rates to protect margins.  \n> 3. Rising national debt → higher borrowing costs → upward pressure on ust10y and mortgage rates.  \n> **Watch:** Fed meetings, inflation data releases, debt trajectory, and housing‑market demand indicators.  \n\nThis version meets the acceptance gate, maintains focus on the housing/capex cycle, and follows the concise, actionable style.",
