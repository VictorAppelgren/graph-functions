  "content": "Mayor Eric Adams deserves a cheer for \u201cSubway Safety Plan\u201d wins, but making the transit system truly safe will mean getting a lot more help to Gotham\u2019s seriously mentally ill.\n\nOn Monday, Adams announced that the city has placed 3,500 onetime \u201cstreet\u201d homeless, including 1,000 pulled from the subways, into permanent housing since 2022.\n\nIt looks like Adams\u2019 efforts, combined with Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch\u2019s emphasis on quality-of-life policing, are paying off: MTA officials just announced drops in transit-system crime, including a 16.7% dip in robberies and a 9.3% fall in felony assaults, comparing July 2025 to July 2024.\n\nThen again, the subways saw a 19% spike in felony assaults in 2025\u2019s first quarter.\n\nAnd straphangers still have good reason to be skittish: On Saturday, a screaming maniac shoved a man onto the tracks at the No. 1 50th Street station for no apparent reason; an hour later, another unhinged man stabbed another man in the neck at an East Village station after the two got into a fight.\n\nThe city has a lot more dangerously unwell vagrants to get out from underground and into treatment, in other words \u2014 and could use continued state reforms to make that easier.\n\nMayor Adams and Gov. Hochul won some expanded standards for involuntary commitment this year, but the leading mayoral candidates have other priorities.\n\nZohran Mamdani even wants to convert subway retail spaces into homeless-outreach centers, which would mean more emotionally disturbed people wandering the system.\n\nForcing unwilling people into treatment sends progressives into conniptions, but true compassion means not letting the seriously mentally ill resist the help they desperately need.\n\nAdams and Tisch have made some hard-earned strides, but the gains are fragile and unlikely to survive a progressive victory in November.\n\nIf Adams gets voted out of office, watch for transit crime to balloon again.",

The city has placed 3,500 onetime \"street\" homeless individuals, including 1,000 pulled from the subways, into permanent housing since 2022. These efforts, along with Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch's emphasis on quality-of-life policing, have resulted in significant decreases in transit-system crime, including a 16.7% decrease in robberies and a 9.3% decrease on felony assaults.

      "text": "Mayor Adams announces over 1,000 homeless New Yorkers moved from subways to permanent homes thanks to Subway Safety Plan\nOver 3,500 homeless New Yorkers have been taken off Big Apple streets and subways and placed in permanent housing since the start of Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 term, Hizzoner announced on Monday \u2014 touting it as proof that his \u201cSubway Safety Plan\u201d is working.\nOver 1,000 of the housing placements came directly from the subway system since the plan launched in early 2022 as part of a broader effort to curb the ongoing homelessness crisis in transit stations, officials said.\n\u201cMore work remains, but it\u2019s clear that the years of walking by New Yorkers in need are over, and this milestone is further proof that we\u2019re continuing to make New York City a safer, more affordable city,\u201d Adams said in a statement.\nCity Hall officials couldn\u2019t say how many people outreach workers had encountered on the streets and subway since 2022, only that 3,500 had been connected to permanent housing.\nThe last street homelessness count was 4,500 on January 28, an Adams spokesperson said, adding that some 85,500 people are currently being housed in city homeless shelters.\nAdams highlighted the number of people connected to permanent housing as part of his new \u201cEnd Anything Goes\u201d campaign \u2014 a push to show how his administration is cracking down on public disorder while expanding services for New Yorkers with mental illness and addiction.\nThe campaign will highlight the current efforts the administration has made to date to \u201cchange the culture\u201d and laws that have prevented mentally ill New Yorkers from seeking help \u2014 while also making investments to support outreach, harm reduction, and housing, Adams said.\n\u201cThis success would not be possible without our historic investments,\u201d the mayor said, crediting Safe Haven beds, outreach teams, and a \u201crecord-breaking creation of affordable housing.\u201d\nSince launching the multi-agency Subway Safety Plan, the city has connected 8,600 people to types of shelter, with over 1,000 now in permanent homes. The effort focuses on outreach at stations to pull people with serious mental health issues out of the transit system.\nThe MTA said this July had the lowest transit-crime stats since 1995 when the data were first collected, with an 8% drop in felonies in the subways last month \u2014 even as a string of violent crimes in the subway system recently left a straphanger slashed and another shoved onto the tracks by a muttering maniac.\nHizzoner also touted the city\u2019s growing network of shelter beds, with 400 more Safe Haven beds to house the homeless and transition them to permanent housing to be added by the end of 2025.\nSo far, 1,400 new beds have been added since Adams took office, City Hall said.\nAdams introduced a $650 million plan to tackle homelessness and get mentally ill New Yorkers off the streets and out of subways during his State of the City speech in January \u2014 begging Albany for more help tackling the Big Apple\u2019s ongoing crisis.\nThe ambitious, five-year proposal \u2014 which is set to include a special new facility to house and treat mentally ill New Yorkers \u2014 follows a spate of frightening underground attacks that have plagued the transit system of late.\nAs part of the plan, a $13 million \u201cpilot program,\u201d as described by a City Hall rep, would create a 100-bed supportive housing facility that would provide shelter to people leaving psychiatric facilities who are not yet ready to fully live alone without support to continue their meds and treatment, officials said.\nThe initiative would also add 900 \u201cSafe Haven\u201d beds, which will be spread across the city, to house the homeless and transition them to permanent housing \u2014 bringing the total to 4,900. An additional 100 beds will also be added to serve runaway and homeless youth ages 21 to 24.\nAnd a new \u201cBridge to Home\u201d model under the proposal will offer home-like environments to patients with serious mental illnesses at NYC Health + Hospitals.\nThe program will target patients who are ready to be discharged from hospitals but have nowhere to go home to, officials said."

Parents should be furious. Politicians should be embarrassed.\nThis year\u2019s mayoral contest has so far offered not even token debate on improving public education, and now Mamdani\u2019s trying to make the race all about who can best fight President Donald Trump. He and Cuomo are in a race to see who hates President Trump more.\nNew York\u2019s children matter a lot more to the city\u2019s future; here\u2019s hoping the candidates don\u2019t keep getting away with ignoring their needs."

In the same span of 2019, 44 of the 154 people assaulted \u2014 or nearly 30% \u2014 were performing law enforcement duties, the spokesperson said.\nSuch incidents have skyrocketed a stunning 66% when compared to 2019, before the pandemic, when 154 straphangers reported being assaulted.\nRetired NYPD detective and John Jay College adjunct professor Michael Alcazar blamed the uptick in assaults on the number of mentally ill in the subway and the criminal justice system.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all these things, the homeless population, the EDPs (Emotionally Disturbed People), the warmer weather, prosecutors not able to keep them in jail,\u201d he said. \u201cIt emboldens the criminals. They get out and they\u2019re back at it the next day.\u201d\nA woman-hating goon with 20 busts under his belt was the perfect example of a recidivist assaulter when he allegedly shoved a 70-year-old grandmother to the ground in a Midtown subway station on May 12.\n\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Sherlock Arana sneered at Janet Parvizyar, an LA resident before shoving her into a wall and to the floor, she said.\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand, why did they let them go like this,\u201d Parvizyar told The Post after learning of her attacker\u2019s criminal history. \u201cI mean, they have to do something about this. He\u2019s going to kill somebody.\u201d\nArana, 37, was arrested two days later after cops recognized him. He remains locked up at Rikers Island correctional facility on a second degree assault charge in lieu of $45,000 bail, records show.\nHe pleaded guilty to assaulting two women inside separate Queens subway stations nearly a decade ago because he thought they were of Indian descent, prosecutors said. At least one was actually Bangladeshi.\nThe most recent of his nearly two dozen prior arrests was in 2023 for a robbery, law enforcement sources said. The disposition of the case was unknown.\nThe notable increase in assaults come as other transit crime has dropped 6% so far this year, including murders, shootings, robbery, burglaries and grand larcenies, the data showed.\nPolice Commissioner Jessica Tisch has attributed the crime drops in transit to an increased police presence underground, including the addition of two cops on every train overnight and hundreds more working overtime shifts.\nA longtime Bronx police officer attributed the increase in assaults to mental illness and crowding on trains which have been busier since congestion pricing went into effect in January.\n\u201cYou have a lot more unstable people who are on the trains,\u201d the cop with more than 20 years on the job said. \u201cCongestion pricing plays a part because the trains are also more crowded.\u201d\nThe police presence could also be adding to the uptick in the number of assaults, especially those against officers, a retired NYPD detective said.\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t like when police enforce drinking and minor offenses and they get aggressive,\u201d the retired officer said."

      "text": "NYC Mayor Eric Adams does victory lap as new state rules make it easier to force mentally ill into treatment\nMayor Eric Adams lauded coming changes to state law that will make it easier to force mentally ill people into treatment \u2014 after he publicly pushed for the change for three years because of crime concerns.\nThe new involuntary commitment law, which is included in the state\u2019s budget, will allow officials to take people off the streets when they show a substantial risk of physical harm to themselves because of an \u201cinability or refusal, as a result of their mental illness, to provide for their own essential needs such as food, clothing, necessary medical care, personal safety, or shelter.\u201d\nBefore the switch, people could only be involuntarily committed if they showed a substantial risk to physically harm themselves or others.\n\u201cOur advocacy has led to real progress,\u201d Adams said during a victory-lap news conference at the Fulton Street subway station Thursday morning. \u201cWe will know in Albany, it takes some time, several sessions, till we get to the full product, and we will continue to move forward on it.\u201d\n\u201cOur clinicians have told us that the law was unclear on who they could transfer to hospitals for evaluation, which often resulted in quick discharge in times when people needed the help,\u201d Adams said at the event.\nAdams has used his bully pulpit to push for changes to involuntary commitment laws as far back as 2022, but hadn\u2019t been able to get the changes across the finish line in the last few sessions.\nBrian Stettin, a senior advisor to the mayor and author of the law that allows for court-mandated mental health treatment, Kendra\u2019s Law, insisted Adams and his administration brought progressives around to support new rules for involuntary commitments.\n\u201cBecause of the advocacy that Mayor Adams has done to bring some common sense into the conversation, even progressive-minded people have come to recognize that the mayor\u2019s position is the moral position,\u201d Stettin said.\n\u201cWe must take care of those who are the most vulnerable, even when they don\u2019t realize they need it,\u201d he added.\nStettin conceded that not all of the admin\u2019s proposals made it into the final language, but was happy with the progress.\nAdditionally, under the new law, someone could now be committed after sign-off from an examining physician and a nurse practitioner rather than the two physicians required by the previous law.\nThe practitioners would have three days after someone is brought to the hospital to decide whether he or she should be committed and reach out to the patient\u2019s doctor if they have one.\nThe final deal also included more requirements for psychiatric centers and local social services agencies to arrange discharge plans once someone is released from care.\nHizzoner appeared to start the festivities a bit earlier than most involved, after being spotted rubbing elbows with rapper Nems Wednesday night.\nThe Coney Island music maker posted an Instagram story showing himself and Adams at a hookah bar, blowing puffs of smoke into the air."

      "text": "MTA touts subway system safety \u2014 just hours after a pair of violent transit attacks\nMTA officials touted a \u201chistoric\u201d dip in Big Apple subway crime in a glowing announcement Sunday \u2014 just hours after a straphanger was slashed and another shoved onto the tracks by a muttering maniac.\nThe transit agency said July produced the lowest transit-crime stats since the data was first collected in 1995, with an 8% drop in felonies in the subways last month \u2014 including a 16.7% plummet in robberies and a 9.3% decrease in felony assaults compared to the same month last year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s clear the efforts to increase overnight patrols, deploy thousands more security cameras and expand mental health outreach are having real positive impacts,\u201d MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said in a statement.\n\u201cBy working closely with Gov. [Kathy] Hochul and the NYPD, we\u2019re making sure the transit system not only is safe, but feels safe for our six million daily riders,\u201d Lieber said.\nBut try telling that to some of this month\u2019s victims \u2014 including an ER pediatrician at Harlem Hospital who just feels \u201chappy he\u2019s still alive\u201d after his brush with death on the rails over the weekend.\nThe 44-year-old doctor was heading home from work and waiting for a No. 1 train in Manhattan around 8 p.m. Saturday \u2014 a few hours before the MTA\u2019s crowing press release \u2014 when a screaming vagrant randomly shoved him onto the tracks.\nThe banged-up doc was able to scramble back up onto the platform with help from other straphangers before a train was set to barrel into the station fewer than 4 minutes later. His assailant fled the station and remains on the loose.\nAbout an hour after that attack, another subway rider was slashed in the neck and armpit after getting into a spat with a knife-wielding nut at an East Village station.\nThat attacker also fled the station and remains on the loose, while his victim was taken to Bellevue Hospital and treated for his injuries, according to police.\nThe back-to-back transit assaults came after another attack Wednesday, when a masked thug slashed a 29-year-old woman multiple times after she refused to surrender her bag at the Wall Street station.\nThe crook demanded the woman\u2019s bag aboard a northbound No. 3 train around 11:10 p.m. when he attacked her, according to police and law enforcement sources.\nStill, according to MTA statistics, subway crimes are not only down month-over-month from last year, but also year-to-date, \u201cled by a drop in overall assaults, even as more riders return to the system,\u201d the transit agency\u2019s chief security officer, Michael Kemper, said in the statement.\nWhen The Post reached out to the MTA for comment over the timing of its press release Sunday, its public-information department said to contact the NYPD\u2019s press office."

      "text": "NYC subway is no homeless shelter, Zohran Mamdani \u2014 can\u2019t you PRETEND to care about the city?\nLeftist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has a . . . remarkable idea: Make sure even more mentally ill homeless people are constantly thronging the subways.\nYes, Mamdani wants to convert empty retail spaces in the MTA system into city-run facilities offering drop-in services for the homeless and outreach toward longer-term solutions.\nHis vision, as he smarmed to a fawning interviewer, would provide \u201ca moment of relief, a moment of care, a moment of guidance\u201d to homeless people.\nThe typical strategy of the left: Offer \u201csolutions\u201d that signal compassion but do nothing meaningful for those they claim to help, even as they add to the burdens on everyone else.\nNew York\u2019s homeless don\u2019t suffer from a lack of social-worker outreach, and the city doesn\u2019t need them to have more reason to plague the subways.\nA recent MTA survey shows that straphangers rate their safety in the subway at slightly below an already-worrying 6 of 10, and that a desire to see fewer people behaving erratically underground is a major, major issue.\nMamdani\u2019s proposal would encourage more mentally ill homeless to enter the system.\nOf course, he is the child of unthinkable privilege, with a famous film-director mother and a globally renowned academic father \u2014 in strong contrast to his \u201cI\u2019m the MOST authentic New Yorker who ever lived, just a scrappy kid from the mean streets finally hitting the big time\u201d campaign schtick.\nSo no shock he\u2019s happy to use people with less money, status and power to advance his career (any child of Hollywood and the Ivy League learns that at his parents\u2019 knees).\nIf Mamdani wanted to make the subways better, he\u2019d be fighting for more cops and more paths to involuntary commitment.\nHow about this: As a Queens assemblyman, Mamdani has a taxpayer-funded office in desirable Astoria just a few blocks from a busy subway station.\nSo you go first, big guy: Convert your space to serve as a model for these outreach centers. (You can always have your mom rent you a different spot to work from.)\nThen voters will know you\u2019re at least acting in good faith \u2014 not just another rich kid play-acting for the transplant class."

      "text": "Washington, DC\u2019s political class may scream in fury at Team Trump\u2019s takeover of policing, but we suspect most district residents will be relieved: Regular people put public safety first.\nThe city\u2019s politicians have failed to do that, and the feds have a duty to act when the nation\u2019s capital is unsafe.\nEven Democrats have been willing to stomp on DC\u2019s demands for \u201chome rule\u201d when it comes to fighting crime: By a vote of 81-14 in 2023, for example, the Dem-run Senate joined with the GOP-run House to override the City Council\u2019s bid to reduce maximum penalties for violent crime, including carjackings \u2014 and President Joe Biden signed the measure into law.\nCarjackings, for the record, are still triple the 2018 level, part of a grim wave of youth crime \u2014 yet city leaders have refused to get serious about stopping the violence.\nNor did President Donald Trump rush to do this: He warned Mayor Muriel Bowser last year that action was on the table; she\u2019s had six months to turn things around \u2014 but several high-profile recent crimes, including last month\u2019s shooting death of 3-year-old Honesty Cheadle, showed she needs help.\nIndeed, as Trump noted, the US capital has more murders per capita than notorious Mexico City and Bogot\u00e1, Colombia. The homicide rate is six times New York City\u2019s.\nTo drive crime down, this intervention will bring in new resources, including hundreds of National Guard and broader deployment of the federal Park Police.\nNote, too: The feds share blame for DC\u2019s high crime: The US Attorney for the District of Columbia is responsible for all felony prosecutions in the city \u2014 but Biden appointees to the job refused to prosecute over half of local crimes.\nWe hope neither the City Council nor Democrats (in Congress or neighboring Maryland and Virginia) try to sabotage this intervention. Everyone but the bad guys, and DC\u2019s citizens most of all, is a winner if it succeeds."

  "argos_summary": "Mayor Eric Adams has made strides in improving subway safety in New York City, with over 3,500 homeless individuals placed into permanent housing since 2022, contributing to a decrease in transit crime. However, recent statistics show a 19% increase in felony assaults in the subway system, highlighting ongoing safety concerns. The mayor's efforts to address mental health issues among the homeless population are crucial, as many attacks are linked to mentally ill individuals. The upcoming mayoral election poses a risk to these gains, as progressive candidates may prioritize different approaches to homelessness and public safety.",
