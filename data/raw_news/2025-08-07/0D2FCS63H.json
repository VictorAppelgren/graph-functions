It\u2019s not clear what caused the problem, which was resolved late Wednesday. While residual delays were expected, United said its team was working to restore normal operations.\n\nAbout 35% of all the airline\u2019s flights were delayed and another 7% were canceled Wednesday, according to FlightAware, a website that tracks flight disruptions. By Thursday morning, 4% of United flights for the day were delayed and 4% were canceled.\n\nAn alert on the Federal Aviation Administration website Wednesday said all United flights destined for Chicago were halted at their departing airports. Flights to United hubs at Denver, Newark, Houston and San Francisco airports also were affected.\n\nThe airline\u2019s travel alert page noted that a technology disruption might impact flights to or from several U.S. airports from Thursday to Sunday including Denver, Newark, Washington, Houston, New York, Los Angeles, Orlando, Chicago, San Francisco, Honolulu and Guam and some in Europe, such as London, Frankfurt and Munich.\n\n\u201cSafety is our top priority, and we\u2019ll work with our customers to get them to their destinations,\u201d an emailed statement from the Chicago-based airline said.\n\nThe system outage, as the company described it, lasted several hours, the statement said. It wasn\u2019t related to recent concerns about airline industry cybersecurity.

      "text": "Cyberattack on Russian airline Aeroflot causes the cancellation of more than 100 flights\nCyberattack on Russian airline Aeroflot causes the cancellation of more than 100 flights\nA cyberattack on Russian state-owned flagship carrier Aeroflot caused a mass outage to the company\u2019s computer systems on Monday, Russia\u2019s prosecutor\u2019s office said, forcing the airline to cancel more than 100 flights and delay others.\nUkrainian hacker group Silent Crow and Belarusian hacker activist group the Belarus Cyber-Partisans, which opposes the rule of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, claimed responsibility for the cyberattack.\nIt is one of the most disruptive cyberattacks to hit Russia since the start of the country\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Previous attacks have targeted Russian government websites and other major Russian companies \u2014 noteably the state-owned Russian Railways \u2014 but normal services have resumed within hours.\nImages shared on social media showed hundreds of delayed passengers crowding Moscow\u2019s Sheremetyevo airport, where Aeroflot is based. The outage also disrupted flights operated by Aeroflot\u2019s subsidiaries, Rossiya and Pobeda.\nWhile most of the flights affected were domestic, the disruption also led to cancellations for some international flights to Belarus, Armenia and Uzbekistan.\nIn a statement released early Monday, Aeroflot warned passengers that the company\u2019s information technology system was experiencing unspecified difficulties and that disruption could follow.\nRussia\u2019s Prosecutor\u2019s Office later confirmed that a cyberattack had caused the outage and that it had opened a criminal investigation.\nKremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov called reports of the cyberattack \u201cquite alarming,\u201d adding that \u201cthe hacker threat is a threat that remains for all large companies providing services to the general public.\u201d\nSilent Crow claimed it had accessed Aeroflot\u2019s corporate network for a year, copying customer and internal data, including audio recordings of phone calls, data from the company\u2019s own surveillance on employees and other intercepted communications.\n\u201cAll of these resources are now inaccessible or destroyed and restoring them will possibly require tens of millions of dollars. The damage is strategic,\u201d the channel purporting to be the Silent Crow group wrote on Telegram. There was no way to independently verify its claims.\nThe same channel also shared screenshots that appeared to show Aeroflot\u2019s internal IT systems, and insinuated that Silent Crow could begin sharing the data it had seized in the coming days.\n\u201cThe personal data of all Russians who have ever flown with Aeroflot have now also gone on a trip \u2014 albeit without luggage and to the same destination,\u201d it said.\nThe Belarus Cyber-Partisans told The Associated Press that they had hoped to \u201cdeliver a crushing blow.\u201d The group has previously claimed responsibility for a number of cyberattacks, and said in April 2024 that they had been able to infiltrate the network of Belarus\u2019 main KGB security agency.\n\u201cThis is a very large-scale attack and one of the most painful in terms of consequences,\u201d group coordinator Yuliana Shametavets said. She said that the group had been preparing the attack for several months, and were able to penetrate the Aeroflot network by exploiting various vulnerabilities.\nBelarus is a close ally of Russia. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron hand for more than 30 years and has relied on Russian subsidies and support, allowed Russia to use his country\u2019s territory to launch a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and to deploy some of Moscow\u2019s tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.\nRussia\u2019s airports have repeatedly faced mass delays over the summer as a result of Ukrainian drone attacks, with flights grounded amid safety concerns."

      "text": "United is narrowing its check-in window for US flights. Here\u2019s how it compares to other airlines\nUnited is narrowing its check-in window for US flights. Here\u2019s how it compares to other airlines\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Stragglers beware: U.S. travelers flying with United Airlines will have to check in to domestic flights a little earlier starting next week. That is, if they\u2019re customers only taking carry-on bags.\nEffective June 3, United\u2019s \u201ccheck-in cutoff\u201d for most U.S. flights will be 45 minutes before departure. That\u2019s the same deadline United has for passengers checking luggage at the airport but 15 minutes earlier than the current one for people without bags to check.\nIn an email to The Associated Press, a United spokesperson said the change to a single cut-off minimum \u201cbrings greater consistency for our customers\u201d and conforms with the policies of many other airlines.\nChecking in for a flight confirms a passenger\u2019s booking and intent to travel ahead of takeoff. Most major U.S. carriers have online check-in systems that can be used at least 24 hours in advance, so the process no longer reflects when many travelers arrive at the airport. But it\u2019s still an important step since boarding passes are issued once check-ins are completed.\nOther U.S. and international carriers have tightened their check-in and boarding policies as part of their strategies for maintaining on-time departures, particularly amid the high demand that followed the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGenerally speaking, checking in allows airports and airlines to prepare for upcoming flights \u2014 from confirming seat assignments to making sure passenger names are at the security checkpoint. Check-in cutoffs, or the latest possible time to claim a flight reservation, are typically earlier for international flights to account for the time needed to check passports and clear customs.\nStill, requirements may vary by airline and airport. Dubai-based Emirates, for example, closes online check-ins 90 minutes before departure. Ireland\u2019s Ryanair allows online check-in up to two hours before a flight; passengers still may check in at the airport 40 minutes in advance, but for a fee.\nHere\u2019s what check-in cutoffs look like for United and some other U.S. carriers.\nUnited Airlines\nAgain, if you\u2019re flying United within the U.S., you\u2019ll need to check in to your flight at least 45 minutes prior to takeoff as of June 3.\nWhile the new cutoff applies to most of United\u2019s domestic trips, check-in deadlines may vary by location and route. The carrier\u2019s website notes that St. Thomas\u2019 airport in the U.S. Virgin Islands has a check-in time limit of 90 minutes prior to departure \u2014 the same cutoff listed for flights between Guam and Honolulu.\nFor international flights, United requires checking in at least an hour before departure. But many airports have earlier deadlines \u2014 such as 75 minutes for major airports in Paris and Dubai, and 90 minutes for the airports in Toronto and Lagos, Nigeria.\nDelta Air Lines\nDelta passengers not checking any bags still have a minimum of a half-hour before a domestic flight to check in. Travelers with luggage to check need to get to the airline ticket counter at least 45 minutes prior, Delta\u2019s website notes, per an update that went into effect last month.\nIn a statement sent to the AP on Tuesday, Delta said it had made this \u201cminor change\u201d so that \u201cDelta teams can ensure all customers have a great experience.\u201d\nFor international flights, Delta travelers must be checked in at least 1 hour before departure. But, like other carriers, Delta\u2019s minimum check-in requirements can vary by location for certain airports. Delta customers checking bags at New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, for example, are supposed to check in an hour before departure whether their flights are domestic or international.\nAmerican Airlines\nIf you\u2019re flying with American Airlines within the U.S., the deadline for checking in and checking a bag before a flight is 45 minutes ahead of departure, according to the carrier\u2019s website.\nFor trips to or from locations outside the U.S., the cutoff to both check-in for your flight and check a bag is 60 minutes ahead of takeoff. But again, a handful of airports have earlier requirements.\nSouthwest Airlines\nPassengers with more than a carry-on bag should get to the airline counter at least 45 minutes before a scheduled flight on Southwest. The carrier warns that baggage destined for a plane\u2019s cargo hold is considered a \u201clate check\u201d and not guaranteed to get on your flight if it\u2019s dropped off less than 45 minutes ahead of departure.\nBeyond baggage, if Southwest travelers aren\u2019t checked-in and in the boarding area at least 10 minutes prior to departure, their reservation could be canceled, a Southwest spokesperson told the AP via email.\nThe carrier did not specify any additional, firm check-in cutoffs for domestic flights. For international trips, Southwest\u2019s website notes that all passengers and their luggage must be checked in a minimum of 60 minutes prior to departure. And again, that can vary \u2014 with flights departing Aruba, for example, having an earlier deadline of 75 minutes before takeoff for passengers with or without checked bags.\nAlaska Airlines\nAlaska requires a minimum of 50 minutes before takeoff to check in passengers for flights within the U.S., whether or not they have bags to check. The cutoff is 60 minutes for international flights, the carrier\u2019s website notes.\nAgain, there are exceptions for certain locations and airports. Passengers traveling from Guadalajara, Mexico, for example, have to check their baggage and into their flights at least 90 minutes ahead of time."
