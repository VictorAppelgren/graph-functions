      "summary": "Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook is facing two criminal referrals from housing regulator Bill Pulte for alleged mortgage fraud on three properties, including misrepresenting a Cambridge condominium as a second home and later as a rental. Pulte claims Cook falsified mortgage applications and bank statements, claiming properties as primary residences while they were rented, to secure lower loan terms. Cook has admitted to manufacturing documents and cited a ‘clerical error’ as a possible explanation, but has not denied the fraud allegations. The case has prompted President Trump to remove Cook from the Fed Board, citing the referrals as sufficient cause for removal.",
