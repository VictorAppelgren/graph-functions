  "description": "Beijing urges local companies to avoid using Nvidia's H-20 processors, complicating the chipmaker's attempts to get back billions in lost China revenue. It comes after the company agreed to an unusual arrangement with the Trump administration to give the US government a 15% cut of the related revenue.\nThe new guidance came just hours after President Trump signed an executive order extending the tariff truce with China for another 90 days. \nEU leaders and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy plan to hold a call with US President Donald Trump, who is downplaying the chances of a breakthrough with Vladimir Putin at their upcoming summit. \n\nToday's guests: Mohit Kumar, Chief Europe Economist at Jefferies, Yu Jie, Fellow at Chatham House, Aldo Spanjer, Head of Energy Strategy at BNP Paribas Markets 360.

  "content": "> > NEWSMAKERS AND MARKET MOVERS, THIS IS \"THE PULSE WITH FRANCINE LACQUA.\" FRANCINE: GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO \"THE PULSE.\" BEIJING HAS URGED LOCAL COMPANIES TO AVOID USING NVIDIA'S H20 PROCESSORS, COMPLICATE AND THE ATTEMPTS TO GET BACK BILLIONS IN LOST CHINA REVENUE. IT ALSO COMES AFTER THE COMPANY AGREED TO AN UNUSUAL ARRANGEMENT WITH THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO GIVE THE U.S. GOVERNMENT A 15% CUT OF THE RELATED REVENUE. THE NEW GUIDANCE COMES JUST HOURS AFTER PRESIDENT TRUMP SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER EXTENDING THE TARIFF TRUCE WITH CHINA FOR ANOTHER 90 DAYS. WE ARE JOINED BY ED LUDLOW. WE ARE LUCKY TO HAVE HIM IN LONDON WAS SUCH TERRIFIC NEWS FLOW. BRENDAN MURRAY HAS NOT SLEPT SINCE APRIL 1. AND MOHIT KUMAR AT JEFFERIES. LET'S START OFF WITH YOU. IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER -- THERE SEEMS TO BE GOOD NEWS ABOUT TRADE. WE WILL GET TO THAT WITHN. THE FACT CHINA IS SAYING PLEASE DON'T BUY THESE PROCESSORS FOR NVIDIA, IS IT RETALIATION? > > CHRONOLOGY IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS GUIDANCE TO ADVISORY WHICH IS QUITE NORMAL FOR CHINESE AUTHORITIES, PARTICULARLY THE INTERNET WATCHDOG, TO DO AND IT HAS HAPPENED THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS SO LIKELY PREDATES THE NEWS OF 24 HOURS AGO. THE DEAL BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES, NVIDIA, AND EMPTY FOR THE 15% REVENUE CUT. THE ANALYST COMMUNITY CERTAINLY THINKS THIS IS A TACTIC FROM CHINA, PART OF THE BROADER NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES, CHINA WHERE PARDON THE PUN THE CHIPS ARE -- EITHER CHINA IS ANGLING FOR ACCESS TO MUCH MORE POWERFUL CHIP BEYOND THE H20 OR IT IS TRYING TO DO SOMETHING WITH LEVERAGE AGAINST CHINA. THE STATE OF PLAY YOU HAVE GOT TO KNOW IS H20 IS NOT THE MOST POWERFUL CHIP AVAILABLE TO CHINESE COMPANIES. THE DOMESTIC CHIP FROM HUAWEI IS MUCH BETTER. THERE'S AN ELEMENT OF THAT NATIONAL SECURITY AND NATIONAL -- FRANCINE: THE MARKETS ARE RELIEVED ON THAT. IS THAT FOR DOMESTIC REASONS? THEY ARE THINKING THIS WILL HURT THE U.S. INFLATION AND COMPLICATE, FOR EXAMPLE, IN FED CUTTING? OR IS IT HE REALLY WANTS TO DO A CHINA? > > HE WANTS A DEAL IN CHINA. HE WANTS A SUMMIT WITH PRESIDENT XI. THIS THREE MONTH PAUSE, THIS TRUTH REALLY CAME DOWN TO THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS AND IT PROBABLY DID NOT NEED TO. THEY RESULT MOST OF THE ISSUES IN STOCKHOLM A FEW WEEKS AGO. PRESIDENT TRUMP LIKES TO KEEP THE OTHER SIDE GUESSING AND WONDERING IF PERHAPS HE WILL RE-ESCALATE. BUT HE DID NOT. HE PUSHED THE NEW DEADLINE OUT TO NOVEMBER 10. THAT LEAVES THE RELATIONSHIP VULNERABLE TO FLAREUPS OF RETALIATION AND USING LEVERAGE LIKE ED WAS DISCUSSING TO RESTART THESE HIGHER TARIFFS. I THINK WHAT WE ARE GOING TO SEE IS MORE UNCERTAINTY. IT WILL GET US THROUGH THE PEAK SHIPPING SEASON WHICH WILL GIVE RETAILERS, IMPORTERS, MANUFACTURERS SOME SORT OF SENSE OF STABILITY BUT IT LEAVES A CLOUD OF UNCERTAINTY HANGING OVER THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN U.S. AND CHINA. FRANCINE: IN GENERAL, WE ARE AFTER -- IT WAS AUGUST 1 AND THEN AUGUST 7 AND THEN GOT PUSHED BACK. DOES IT FEEL BETTER IN THE MARKETS BECAUSE YOU HAVE AT LEAST A BASE, 10% OR DO YOU THINK ANYTHING CAN REALLY CHANGE AT ANY MOMENT? > > THERE IS STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY. BUT I WOULD SAY IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE BIG TRADING PARTNERS, WE HAVE SOME VERSION WITH THE EU, CHINA, SOME CERTAINTEED, NOT A DEAL BUT IT IS A BACKDROP IS THERE. SIMILARLY WITH OTHER TRADING PARTNERS EVEN WITH INDIA, I WAS A UNCERTAINTY IS REDUCED. BUT IF YOU THINK FROM A BIG CHIP PERSPECTIVE, TARIFFS DON'T REALLY MATTER. FROM AN EQUITY MARKETS PERSPECTIVE, I DO NOT REALLY THINK TARIFFS MATTER. FRANCINE: UNTIL THEY MATTER. > > WELL, IF YOU DON'T HAVE A DEAL, YES. TOTALLY AGREE. AS LONG AS WE ARE MOVING TOWARD -- LIKE WHAT BRENDAN WAS SAYING, TRUMP ONE STEP DEALS WITH THE KEY TRADING PARTNERS. AS LONG AS WE ARE MOVING, I WAS A TARIFFS DO NOT MATTER. FRANCINE: IT IS UNCLEAR TO ME, THE TECHNOLOGY PERSPECTIVE, DONALD TRUMP IS OPEN TO NVIDIA SELLING BLACK WHAT A CHINA. I CAN FIGURE OUT WHETHER HE IS OK WITH DEALING WITH CHINA IF HE CAN GET MONEY BACK OR WHETHER HE IS LESS SKEPTICAL THAN THE REST OF HIS CABINET ON CHINA. > > PRESIDENT SHOWED QUITE INTERESTING COMMAND OF THE SUBJECT MATTER DURING THE PRESS CONFERENCE YESTERDAY, THIS PASSIVITY OF THE AGE 20 RELATIVE TO THE OTHER CHIPS NVIDIA OFFERS. -- THE SPACE IS 70 OF THE H20 RELATIVE TO THE OTHER CHIPS NVIDIA OFFERS. IT IS BILLED, THEY BECOME A BUILD. FROM THAT STANDPOINT, EXPORT BECOMES -- IT IS A CODIFIED POLICY. IT WAS IN THE AI DOCUMENT WHEN I WAS IN D.C. TWO WEEKS AGO. THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED, THE IDEA OF A EXPORT TAX AND AD HOC AGREEMENT BETWEEN A COMPANY, CEO, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THEY BASICALLY CORROBORATED IT AS THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN, JENSEN, OBJECTS WERE TO CHINA AND THE PRESIDENT SAID, WHEN 20%. HE SAID, HOW ABOUT 15%. THEIR PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS CONSTITUTIONAL OR NOT BUT WHO IS GOING TO COMPLAIN IF IT IS NVIDIA OR THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OF THE TABLE HAVE TO DO? MAKE A DEAL FRANCINE: INTEL HAD A REALLY HARD TIME OVER THE LAST TWO WEEKS WITH THE INTEL CHIEF EXECUTIVE BECAUSE OF HIS CLOSENESS TO CHINA. SUDDENLY THE PRESIDENT SAYS HE HAS AMAZING STORY IN GOING TO TALK TO THE CABINET READ > > THINGS CHANGE. > > LAST THURSDAY UNTRUTH SOCIAL THE PRESIDENT SAID -- UNTRUTH SOCIAL COME THE PRESIDENT SAID LIP-BU TAN SHOULD RESIGN. HE IS WELL KNOWN. HE WAS VENTURE CAPITALIST THAT DID PUT MONEY INTO CHINESE FIRMS. HE WAS AT A COMPANY CALLED CADENCE THAT WAS INVESTIGATED BECAUSE OF THE FLOW OF TECHNOLOGY AND MILITARY AT ONE POINT. ON PAPER, THE THING THAT TRUMP THE ADMINISTRATION IS DOING ON PAPER. IT WANTS TO MOVE FAST AND BUILD THINGS. IT IS JUST INTEL HASN'T REALLY GOT THE PROGRAM. THAT WAS REALLY SIGNIFICANT NEWS. OUR INTERESTED WHAT THE MARKET DOES TODAY BECAUSE THIS PRESIDENT SAYS THINGS AND DOES THEM. THAT WAS EVIDENT IN THE GULF WHEN JENSEN HUANG WAS IN THE GULF, THERE WAS A TIME IT WOULD BE ON THINK ABOUT WE WOULD HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF CHIPS GOING TO SAUDI AND UAE DIRECTLY. THE PRESIDENT JUST MADE IT HAPPEN. CAN HE MAKE SOMETHING HAPPEN FOR INTEL DOMESTICALLY? HIS CHANGE HAS -- HIS TUNE HAS CHANGED WITH THE BOOT HAND. FRANCINE: A DEAL WAS STRUCK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. BRENDAN, ONE OF MY FAVORITE STORIES FIVE MONTHS AGO BLOOMBERG'S AGNES COULD BE PRESIDENT XI'S WORLD GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY. A MORE RELIABLE PARTNER THAN THE U.S. WHICH AT THE TIME SEEMED CRAZY. WE KNOW PRESIDENT LULA HAS ALSO BEEN SPEAKING WITH PRESIDENT XI BECAUSE OF WHAT TRUMP IS DOING. ARE THERE MORE TRADE DEALS TO BE DONE WITH CHINA? > > WHAT WE HAVE SEEN OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS, 48 HOURS AND EVEN OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF MONTHS IS PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DEALING WITH A VERY DIFFERENT CHINA THAN HE DEALT WITH BACK IN 2018 AND 2019 WHEN IN THE LEAD UP TO THE PHASE ONE DEAL. THIS IS CHINA THAT HAS COME AS PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD SAY, SOME PRETTY GOOD CARDS IN HIS HAND. THEY ARE PLAYING IT. IN IT IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF ANALYSTS, VERY WELL. THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN XI AND A LULA IS INTERESTING BECAUSE BRAZIL IS A BIG SOYBEAN EXPORTER. WHAT DID PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED ABOUT ON SUNDAY? HE SAID WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF CHINA BUYS SOYBEANS. CHINA CAN GET ALL IT SOYBEANS IT NEEDS FROM SOUTH AMERICA, SO I THINK YOU ARE SEEING THE SOYBEAN DIPLOMACY COME INTO THIS BUT WOULD ARE WELL BILL ON -- WE ARE WELL BEYOND THE GAME WHERE WE ARE IN A TECH WAR RATHER THAN TRADE WAR. FRANCINE: WEIGHT OF THE STORIES AND THE IMPORTANT OF ECONOMIES, SOME POINT THERE WILL COME HOME TO ROOST. > > LET'S LOOK AT NUMBERS. AVERAGE TARIFFS AND OF 2024. LESSON WHEN THE DUST SETTLES, LESS A 15%, 17%. THAT IS ADDITIONAL $300 MILLION OF REVENUE FOR THE U.S. PER YEAR. THAT IS EXACTLY THE AMOUNT NEEDED FOR THE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL. YES, WE HAVE TARIFFS WHICH ARE A TAX ON CONSUMERS BUT WE ARE GIVING BACK IN TERMS OF THE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL. WE CAN TALK CONSUMERS BENEFIT AND WHICH DO NOT, BUT U.S. ECONOMY AS A WHOLE IS FINE. TARIFFS -- THAT IS WHY MY VIEW WAS THAT IS A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY IMPACT BUT FROM AN EQUITY MARKET PERSPECTIVE, SHOULD NOT HAVE A BIG IMPACT. FRANCINE: CPI PRINT TODAY IS ACTUALLY IMPORTANT. IF WE SEE INFLATION -- YOU COULD RELY ON THE U.S. CONSUMER SO FAR. AT SOME POINT, DOES IT WEAKEN? > > IT DOES. IT DEPENDS ON HOW STRONG THE CPI PRINT IS. YOU USE THE WORD EARLIER STAGFLATION. I LIKE TO-FLATION. FRANCINE: PANIC. > > THE REASON I SAY SLOW-FLATION AS I DO NOT SEE THE U.S. ECONOMY WEAKENING MASSIVELY. TO PUT SOME NUMBERS, UNEMPLOYMENT CAN GO TO 4.5% ABSOLUTELY. WE HAVE NEVER HAD A RECESSION WITH UNEMPLOYMENT LESS THAN 6%. WE CAN HAVE A SLOWDOWN OF THE ECONOMY AND STICKY INFLATION BUT I THINK THE U.S. ECONOMY IS STILL DOING FINE. FRANCINE: THANKS TO TECH. > > I TOTALLY AGREE. FRANCINE: IS IT A LITTLE MORE PROBLEMATIC IF YOU STRIP OUT THE BIG SEVEN? > > I AGREE WITH THAT. IF I LOOK AT BIG SEVEN, S & P AND RUSSELL 2000, 30 PERCENT OF COMPANIES IN RUSSELL 2000 ARE NOT MAKING MONEY. I DO NOT THINK THEY WILL BE MAKING MONEY. IT IS A BIG CAP STORY. IT IS NOT A SMALL-CAP STORY. I AGREE WITH THAT. FRANCINE: WHEN YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS, ELON MUSK HAS NOT BEEN IN THE NEWS LIKE USED TO BE PRETTY IS TODAY -- USED TO BE BUT HE IS TODAY. IT WAS A FACE-OFF BETWEEN TRUMP AND ELON MUSK AND HOW MANY HEADLINES THEY COULD GET. ELON MUSK ACCUSING APPLE OF UNFAIRLY FAVORING OPENAI. > > MUSK HAS POSTED SEVERAL TIMES ON X THE CLAIM HE HAS MADE IS HE WILL LITIGATE IN THE ANTITRUST CONTEXT BECAUSE HE BELIEVES A FORMATIVELY, POSITIVELY APPLE DO SOME KIND OF ACTION THAT KEEPS OPENAI AT THE TOP OF THE RANKINGS LIST ON THE APP STORE AND SUPPRESSES HIS X APPS. ONE THING I KNOW IS THAT TIRADE ON X CAME TO THE NEW VERSION OF GROK WHEN ON THE APP STORE AND HIS VERSION IS THEY HAVE A TECHNOLOGY RELATIONSHIP. OPENAI IS SOMEWHAT UNDERPINNED SIRI. APPLE, I CAN TELL YOU, THE APP STORE IS DICTATED BY VOLUME DOWNLOADS, VELOCITY OF DOWNLOADS, THE NUMBER OF DOWNLOADS FROM THE TIME IN APP'S FIRST LISTED AND META DATA. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER ELON MUSK KNOWS THAT ARE NOT BUT HE HAS A HISTORY OF BEING LITIGIOUS IN DEFENSE OR OFFENSE OF HIS OWN COMPANIES. APPLE HAS NOT COMMENTED SO FAR. FRANCINE: IT COULD ALSO COME JUST GOING AFTER THEM SO PEOPLE GET ANGRY AT APPLE. YOU NEVER REALLY KNOW WHETHER HE THINKS THERE IS A LAWSUIT CASE. > > HE HAS THREATENED LEGAL ACTION IN THE PAST AND NOT ACTED ON IT. HE HAS THREATENED IT IN THE PAST AND ACTED ON IT AND SAM ALTMAN, THE OPENAI CEO, BASICALLY DISAGREEING WITH WHAT ELON MUSK SAYS ON X. WE WILL NOT KNOW UNLESS APPLE COMMENTS OR GIVES -- SOMEBODY GIVES US SOME DATA BUT IT IS VERY MUCH -- I HAVE LAUNCHED AN APP IN THE DOWNLOADS ARE NOT WHAT I THINK THEY SHOULD BE AND I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHY. THAT SEEMS TO BE ELON MUSK'S PERSPECTIVE. FRANCINE: WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OTHER BIG STORY THIS WEEK WILL BE POSSIBLE PEACE DEAL BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE. THIS SEEMS TO BE NOT TAKEN OFF THE TABLE BUT DONALD TRUMP SAYING, LET'S MINIMIZE EXPECTATIONS. AT SOME POINT, THERE WAS TARIFFS THAT WERE NOT IMPOSED AGAINST ANYONE APART FROM INDIA BECAUSE OF OIL. DO WE KNOW ANY MORE OF THAT AS WE GO INTO THE MEETING? > > THAT IS ONE OF THE MAIN QUESTIONS HIS WHETHER TRUMP'S TARIFFS, THE EXTRA TARIFFS ON INDIA AND BRAZIL WILL BECOME -- WHETHER THOSE ARE KIND OF A ONE-OFF OR WHETHER THEY WORK IN THE SHORT TERM AND WHETHER GEOPOLITICS BECOMES PART OF THE EQUATION IN THE USE OF TARIFFS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. INDIA IS UNDER A LOT OF STRAIN RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE SOME GOOD REPORTING ON THE TERMINAL RECENTLY ABOUT HOW THE INDIAN EXPORTERS ARE REALLY GETTING HIT HARD. MAYBE THE PRESSURE COMES TO BEAR ON MODI TO OFFER SOME SORT OF CONCESSION THAT GETS THEM OUT OF THOSE TARIFFS, BUT GEOPOLITICS ARE DEFINITELY PART OF THE CALCULUS NOW FROM THE WHITE HOUSE. FRANCINE: GEOPOLITICS FOR WAS THIS WEEK SEEM TO BE HELPING SOME OF THE EQUITIES ON THE BACK OF LOWER OIL AND THE FACT HOPING FOR A PEACE DEAL. > > WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT IS FOR EUROPE, IF WE DO GET A PEACE DEAL -- AND I'M NOT A YOUR POLITICAL EXPERT -- BUT ANY VERSION OF A PIECE STILL IS GOOD FOR EUROPE IS GOOD FOR CERTAIN SECTORS LIKE CONSTRUCTION, MATERIALS, CHEMICALS, EVEN CONSUMER SECTOR BECAUSE THAT IS LOWER PRICES. IT IS POSITIVE FOR EASTERN EUROPE. MOST OF THE SECTORS WHEN I THINK ABOUT CONSUMERS ARE INDUSTRIALS, MATERIALS, THEY ARE -- THEY HAVE UNDERPERFORMED. AP STILL COULD BE POSITIVE FOR THESE SECTORS. FRANCINE: WHAT A TERRIFIC BRIEFING TO GET US STARTED. BRENDAN MURRAY, ED LUDLOW, AND MOHIT KUMAR. TRADE TIES BETWEEN THE WORLD'S TWO LARGEST ECONOMIES IN FOCUS AS PRESIDENT TRUMP EXTENDS A POSITIVE -- PAUSE ON TARIFFS ON CHINESE GOODS. WE WILL BE SPEAKING WITH YOU LEE OF CHATHAM HOUSE. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG.\" \u266a FRANCINE: RETURNING TO ONE OF OUR TOP STORIES, PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER EXTENDING THE U.S. TARIFF TRUCE WITH CHINA FOR ANOTHER 90 DAYS. THE EXTENSION LEAVES WORRIES OF RENEWED TIER FOUR THAT THREATENS TO CHOKE OFF TRADE BETWEEN THE WORLD TWO LARGEST ECONOMIES. PRES. TRUMP: WE HAVE BEEN DEALING NICELY WITH CHINA AS YOU PROBABLY HAVE HEARD. THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS TARIFFS THEY ARE PAYING TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE RELATIONSHIP IS VERY GOOD WITH PRESIDENT XI AND MYSELF. FRANCINE: JOINING US FOR MORE IS YU JIE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. FIRST OF ALL, WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TRUCE DEADLINE AND THE FACT IT WAS EXTENDED TO NOVEMBER 10, IS THIS A GOOD SIGN? WHAT DOES DONALD TRUMP WANT FROM CHINA RIGHT NOW? > > NICE TO SEE YOU. OBVIOUSLY, YOU WANT A GRAND BARGAIN WITH BEIJING TO BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY THAT DONALD TRUMP HAS DEALT WITH THE ISSUE QUITE SUCCESSFULLY AS HE PROMISED DURING THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. SECONDLY, I THINK CHINA IS A MARKET IS REALLY LARGE ENOUGH OF THE UNITED STATES ARE NOT SO FOR U.S. COMPANIES. I DOUBT ANY U.S. COMPANIES WERE WILLING TO GIVE UP SO I THINK THAT IS A SECOND REASON. THE THIRD REASON I THINK IS ALSO POLITICALLY. DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO SHOW HE IS ABLE TO MANAGE PROBABLY THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP WHICH IS U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS. THIS IS IN THE MOMENT WHETHER HE IS ABLE TO PUT UP A MEETING WITH XI JINPING OR NOT LATER IN THE YEAR. FRANCINE: WHEN YOU LOOK AT EXACTLY WHAT HE NEEDS, THERE WAS A LITTLE BIT IN THE WORKS YESTERDAY WHEN WE HEARD AMD AND NVIDIA COULD PAY 15% FACTOR DONALD TRUMP AND WE KNOW HE IS LOOKING FOR MONEY -- IF SOMEONE ELSE TO PAY FOR THE BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL. IS THIS MORE OF A MONEY ARRANGEMENT? WILL HE BE SOFTER ON CHINA IF HE UNDERSTANDS HE CAN GET MONEY BACK FROM U.S. COMPANIES? > > IS A TYPICAL DONALD TRUMP MENTALITY. HE IS WILLING TO MAKE A DEAL AND TRY TO FIND MANY FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE. THAT PLAYED PURPOSIVELY -- THAT PLAYED PERFECTLY FOR CHINA. LESS TALKING ABOUT MONEY BUT NOT NATIONAL SECURITY. WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE CHIPS AND SEMICONDUCTORS HERE, ESSENTIALLY, IS ABOUT SECURITY RISK. EQUALLY, TO WHAT EXTENT HOW MUCH CHINA IS WILLING TO BUY THE H20 NVIDIA CHIPS IS ENTIRELY DIFFERENT QUESTION. EARLIER THIS MONTH, THE CHINESE AUTHORITY ALREADY GET IN TOUCH WITH NVIDIA TALKING ABOUT THE POSSIBLE DR. SECURITY RISKS. I THINK THE CHINESE ALSO HAVE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS WITH THIS PROBLEM. FRANCINE: HOW DO YOU -- WHERE DO YOU SEE THE TARIFFS ENDING UP? > > WELL, JUDGING FROM THE PATTERN THAT BEIJING IS DOING RIGHT NOW, IT SEEMS BEIJING TAKING A STALLING NEGOTIATION APPROACH. THAT IS TO SAY, DELAY THE DEADLINE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE WHICH WOULD BE ABLE TO BUY SOME TIME FOR CHINA'S OWN DOMESTIC ECONOMIC REBALANCING. REALLY JUDGING FROM THE TRADE NUMBER, THE EXPORT NUMBER WE HAVE SEEN IN JULY SO FAR, THE CHINESE EXPORT ACTUALLY GREW 7.2%. IN A WAY, IT IS NOT NECESSARILY BAKED INTO THE STORY THAT WITH YOU TO TAKE THAT CHINA'S EXPORT WON'T GROW. I THINK WHAT BEIJING IS LOOKING AT IS FIRSTLY LOOKING AT THE MARKET THAT IS ABLE TO OFFSET THE LOSSES FROM U.S. AND EUROPEAN MARKET BUT SECONDLY ALSO REBALANCING ITS ECONOMY. FRANCINE: GIVE ME A SENSE OF HOW CHINA COULD RETALIATE. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU CONSIDER THEY BASICALLY SAID THAT ESPECIALLY FOR COMPANIES -- NOT COMPANIES BUT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, IT IS BETTER IF THEY DON'T USE THIS H20 PROCESSORS FROM NVIDIA. IS THAT RETALIATION OR WERE THEY BE STRONGER IN RARE EARTHS, STUFF? > > I THINK IT IS BOTH. JUDGING FROM ALL THE READOUTS SO FAR, I THINK BOTH SIDES HAVE NOT MENTIONED WHERE DOES THE CRITICAL MINERAL EXPORT CONTROL FISHING IS WILLING TO LOSE OR NOT. WE HAVE NOT SEEN THAT. I THINK IT IS VERY FIRM. THAT IS TO SAY BEIJING WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY VERY HARD-NOSED APPROACH REGARDING THE EXPORT CONTROL OF CRITICAL MINERALS SO THAT WON'T CHANGE. SECONDLY, I THINK BEIJING IS DRUMMED UP THIS INNOVATION WHICH IS TO SAY THAT HOPING TO BE ABLE TO USE THE SEMICONDUCTORS THAT WOULD ENABLE AND STRENGTHEN CHINA'S TECHNOLOGY SUPPLY CHAIN. PERHAPS IT IS NOT THE BEST OPTION FOR BEIJING. SEMI CONDUCTOR SUPPLY CHAIN IN THE COUNTRY BY ITSELF. FRANCINE: WHAT DOES IT MEAN, FOR EXAMPLE, SOYBEANS? NO DONALD TRUMP ON SOCIAL MEDIA WAS -- REALLY WANTED CHINA TO QUADRUPLE U.S. SOYBEAN BUYING. IF THEY HAVE BRAZIL, WHO IS ALSO A PARTNER, WE KNOW PRESENTLY LOW IN TO SEE PRESIDENT XI. > > I THINK THE TWO MEN JUST HAD A CONVERSATION EARLIER. LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY. I THINK CHINA TODAY IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE FIRST DONALD TRUMP TERM IN TERMS OF NEGOTIATION. IN THE PAST, BEIJING WAS MORE INCLINED TO HAVE QUICK DEALS WITH UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, I THINK PEOPLE ARE AT THE STAGE WHERE WE ARE NOW AND CHINA HAS VERY DIFFERENT TOOLBOX TO USE. I THINK IT LIES SLIGHTLY BEIJING IS WILLING TO AGREE TO PURCHASING EXTRA SOYBEANS WHICH BEIJING CAN DO SO IF THEY DECIDED THEY WANT TO MAKE SOME KIND OF TRADE OFF WITH THE UNITED STATES. I THINK SO FAR BEIJING'S MOOD SEEMS TO BE QUITE MUTED WHEN IT COMES TO THE DISCUSSION OF PURCHASING EXTRA AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. OBVIOUSLY, THAT IS PERHAPS THE EASIEST BARGAIN PATIENT IS WILLING TO MAKE THE OFFER. FRANCINE: DO YOU THINK WE WILL GET A MEETING BETWEEN DONALD TRUMP AND PRESIDENT XI FACE TO FACE? > > I THINK MY WATCH POINT WOULD BE WHETHER TO SEE CHINA'S FOREIGN MINISTER WILL BE ABLE TO VISIT WASHINGTON BY LATE SEPTEMBER DURING THE U.N. GENERAL SIMILE. IF THAT IS BEEN AGREED AND THAT MEANS THERE IS A LIKELY SUMMIT HAPPENING BETWEEN XI AND TRUMP. THE WATCH POINT IS LATE SEPTEMBER. FRANCINE: SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO TALK ABOUT THE PANEL IS PRESIDENT TRUMP NO SOFTER ON CHINA AND THE REST OF HIS CABINET? > > I DON'T THINK HE IS SOFT ON CHINA. WHAT HE REALLY WANTS TO DO IS GET THE TRADE ISSUES SORTED, WHICH HE CONSIDERS HIS ONLY SINGLE BIGGEST PRIORITY FIRSTLY. I THINK SECONDLY, ALSO HE WANTS TO SHOW HIMSELF AS BEING A GREAT LEADER THAT IS ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH ONE OF THE WORLD'S SECOND-LARGEST ECONOMY AND ALSO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH LEADERS FROM ALL SIDES. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT DONALD TRUMP IS LOOKING AT, THE OBJECTS, LIKE A STATEMENT AND HE IS WILLING TO TALK TO EVERYBODY. THAT IS WHAT HE IS AIMING AT. I THINK THIS MIGHT CHANGE GIVEN THE MIDTERM ELECTION TAKEN PLACE. YOU'RE PROBABLY GOING TO SEE MORE IN THE NEXT YEAR BUT NOT NECESSARILY THIS YEAR. REALLY JUDGING FROM WHAT IS HAPPENING. FRANCINE: YU JIE, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. COMING UP, WE TALK ENERGY. \u266a FRANCINE: GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO \"THE PULSE.\" THESE ARE YOUR TOP STORIES. AS PRESIDENT TRUMP EXTENDS A TRADE TREES WITH BEIJING AND SEES AN OPENING FOR CHIP SALES, CHINA URGES LOCAL COMPANIES TO AVOID USING NVIDIA H20 PROCESSORS. THERE PRESIDENT DOWNPLAYS EXPECTATIONS FOR HIS UPCOMING MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN. TESTING IT AS I FEEL OUT MEETING. THE U.K. LOSES FEWER JOBS THAN EXPECTED IN JULY BRINGING SOME RELIEF TO THE LABOR MARKET AND THE CHANCELLOR RACHEL REEVES. EU LEADERS AND UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT PLAN TO HOLD A CALL WITH DONALD TRUMP TOMORROW. THIS COMES AHEAD OF HIS MEETING WITH VLADIMIR PUTIN THIS FRIDAY IN ALASKA. TRUMP HAS BEEN TALKING DOWN THE CHANCES OF AN AGREEMENT BEING REACHED WHEN THE TWO MEN MEET. PRES. TRUMP: THIS IS REALLY A FEEL OUT MEETING A LITTLE BIT. PRESIDENT PUTIN INVITED ME TO GET INVOLVED. HE WANTS TO GET INVOLVED. I BELIEVE HE WANTS TO GET IT OVER WITH. I HAVE SAID THAT A FEW TIMES AND I'VE BEEN DISAPPOINTED. FRANCINE: WE ARE JOINED BY STEPHANIE BAKER. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT THEY CAN ACHIEVE BUT FOR THE PRESIDENT TWO DAYS BEFORE SAYING, LOOK, IT IS A FEEL OUT MEETING, WHAT IS IT? > > IT IS A VERY ODD WAY TO GO INTO A MAJOR U.S.-RUSSIA SUMMIT THAT WE HAVE NOT HAD FOR FOUR YEARS. THEY FEEL OUT MEETING DOES INDICATE TO ME THAT PEOPLE HAVE GOTTEN TO HIM, EUROPEAN READERS TO WARN HIM OF THE RISK OF DOING THIS SUMMIT. I THINK ULTIMATELY, STEPPING BACK, I DO THINK TRUMP IS WORRIED RUSSIA-UKRAINE WILL MAR 'S LEGACY. AS WE ALL KNOW, HE HAS BEEN EAGER TO GET THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. HE THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE OVER IN 24 HOURS AND IT HAS DAWNED ON HIM HOW DIFFICULT THIS IS. GOING INTO THIS MEETING, TRYING TO DO LAND SWAPS AS WE DISCUSSED YESTERDAY IS GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT FOR HER LEADERS TO DISCUSS. I SUSPECT WE WILL GET STUDENT AT THE END SAYING THEY WILL LEAVE IT -- A STATEMENT AT THE END THAT THEY WILL ABLE TO WORK IN GROUPS TO CARRY ON. I THINK HE IS WORRIED ABOUT THIS MARRING HIS LEGACY AND THAT UKRAINE EITHER FALLING TO THE RUSSIANS WOULD BE BAD, WHICH HE KNOWS, OR REMAINING AT WAR IS ALSO GOING TO BE INCREDIBLY BAD FOR HIS PRESIDENCY AND HIS LEGACY. FRANCINE: THERE WERE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER PRESIDENT TRUMP WOULD SPEAK WITH EU LEADERS BEFORE OR AFTER. WE KNOW THERE'S A PHONE CALL TOMORROW, SO THAT FEELS ALSO SIGNIFICANT. > > VERY SIGNIFICANT. I THINK THEY ARE WORRIED HE IS GOING TO GO INTO THIS MEETING AND COME OUT WITH SOME KIND OF DEAL THAT WOULD LEGITIMIZE RUSSIAN TERRITORIAL GAINS ON THE GROUND. I THINK THEY'RE TRYING TO PRESENT A UNITED FRONT AND PROTECT UKRAINE'S SOVEREIGNTY. ULTIMATELY, IT IS ABOUT EUROPEAN SECURITY AS WELL. I THINK THAT WILL BE A VERY IMPORTANT MEETING. THERE ARE PEOPLE ON THE CALL, FINLAND, KEIR STARMER, BOTH LEADERS WHO HAVE DEVELOPED A RAPPORT WITH TRUMP, I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO CONVINCE HIM OF THE DANGERS THAT PUTIN WILL BE PLAYING FOR TIME AND THAT PUTIN LIES IN THE CONTEXT OF THESE MEETINGS THAT HE SHOULD BE AWARE OF THAT. FRANCINE: WHY ALASKA? IT IS BASICALLY PUTTING HIM ON U.S. SOIL. > > YES WE HAD THIS IS AN INDICTED WERE CRIMINAL UNDER U.S. SANCTIONS BEING WELCOMED ON U.S. SOIL. IT IS A VICTORY FOR PUTIN JUST THE MEETING IN AND OF ITSELF. I THINK PERHAPS THEY DECIDED THAT MORE NEUTRAL TERRITORY LIKE DUBAI OR TURKEY WOULD PRESENT SECURITY CHALLENGES. I'M NOT SURE. THAT IS A QUESTION THAT REMAINS TO BE ANSWERED. MAYBE WE WILL FIND OUT MORE. FRANCINE: YOU MY GO TO PERSON FOR ANYTHING WASHINGTON AND TRUMP. THERE IS ANOTHER SHOW OF STRENGTH FROM DONALD TRUMP UNDER PLANE THE NATIONAL GUARD TO WASHINGTON. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THIS IS ALSO IS IT TESTING THE LEGALITY OF CERTAIN THINGS OR DOES HE REALLY THINK CRIME IS TOO HIGH AND HE WANTS TO GET A HOLD OF IT? > > I THINK IT IS BOTH. YET THE QUESTION THE TIMING. AS HE TRIED TO DEFLECT ATTENTION FROM THE SUMMIT, WHICH HE KNOWS MAY NOT PRODUCE A REAL AGREEMENT FROM THE EPSTEIN FILES? IT COMES AMID HIS INCREASED MILITARIZATION OF U.S. CITIES. REMEMBER, HE SENT IN THE NATIONAL GUARD TO L.A. AGAINST GOVERNOR NEWSOM'S WISHES AND THAT IS BEING FOUGHT OUT IN COURT NOW. HE HAS THE LEGAL AUTHORITY TO DO THIS IN D.C. BECAUSE AS PRESIDENT, HE IS ALLOWED TO ORDER THE NATIONAL GUARD INTO D.C. CRIME IS AT A 30 YEAR LOW. IT ISN'T THAT THERE IS IN A CRIME -- IT ISN'T THERE ISN'T A CRIME ISSUE, THERE IS A HOMELESSNESS PROBLEM. I THINK IT WAS TO BE POSITIONING HIMSELF AS A LAW AND ORDER PRESIDENT READ CANSECO STEPHANIE BAKER, THANK YOU, SENIOR WRITER AND REMINDER YOU CAN ALSO READ MORE ON ALL OF THESE TOPICS, ESPECIALLY HEAD OF THE SUMMIT IN HER BOOK \"PUNISHING PUTIN.\" TWO MOVING STORIES THIS WEEK FOR A DECISION BY PRESIDENT TRUMP TO PAUSE TARIFFS ON CHINESE GOODS FOR ANOTHER 90 DAYS. KEEP TRUMP-PUTIN SUMMIT ON FRIDAY. WE ARE JOINED BY ALDO SPANJER OF BNP PARIBAS MARKET 360. THANK YOU FOR JOINING US. THERE IS QUITE A LOT GOING ON. THE OIL MARKET, WE ARE SEEING IT AS A POSITIVE, THE FACTOR COULD BE A PEACE AGREEMENT IN EUROPE EVEN AS SOON AS MAYBE NOT THIS WEEK BUT CERTAINLY SOON. TALK TO US ABOUT THE MARKET DYNAMICS. > > LOOK, I THINK IT IS -- IF YOU LOOK AT OIL SPECIFICALLY, UNLESS I WE HAVE SOME KIND OF PEACE DEAL BETWEEN RUSSIA AND UKRAINE, I THINK FOR OIL, IT PROBABLY HAS LIMITED IMPACT PHYSICALLY IN THE SENSE THAT WE HAVE REROUTED OIL VOLUMES FROM RUSSIA BUT WE HAVE NOT REALLY CUT THEM. I THINK THE ONLY WAY YOU WOULD SEE JOURNAL IMPACT IN OIL PHYSICALLY IS IF EUROPE TAKES RUSSIAN OIL AGAIN. I THINK THAT IS STILL A FAIR WAY OFF READ THE UPSIDE MAY BE A LITTLE MORE INTO GAS MARKETS WHERE YOU PROBABLY HAVE MORE OF AN ARGUMENT TO MAKE MAYBE WE SEE RUSSIAN SUPPLIES GOING BACK INTO EUROPE. I'M NOT ONE OF THE PEOPLE WHO THINK IT MIGHT HAPPEN BUT IN TERMS OF SENTIMENT, I THINK YOU COULD SEE, PARTICULARLY IN GAS, BEARISH SENTIMENT COMING INTO THE MARKET, HIGHER THAN ZERO PROBABILITY OF GAS SUPPLIES COMING BACK. FRANCINE: FIRST OF ALL, GIVE ME A SENSE COME THE PRICE OF OIL HAS HELD UP A LITTLE MORE THAN WE WERE EXPECTING GIVEN WHAT OPEC-PLUS HAS DONE. WHY? > > QUITE A FEW FACTORS. YOU ARE RIGHT. H1 STRONGER THAN EVERYONE EXPECTED GIVEN A PRETTY BEARISH MACRO OVERLY BRINGING SUPPLIES BACK. I THINK A FEW FACTORS ARE THAT CHINESE STOCK BUILDS HAVE BEEN STRONG, PARTICULARLY IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR. THEY'RE NOT IMPACTED OIL PRICES BECAUSE THEY ARE SET NOT IN ASIA. WE HAVE ALSO SEEN THE OPEC SUPPLY INCREASE WHICH STARTED IN Q2 HAPPENS TO COINCIDE WITH SUMMER IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THAT MEANS VERY HIGH INTERNAL AMOUNTS. I'M NOT SEE MANY SUPPLIES TO MARKET. THE BIG OVERHANGING ISSUE IN THE MARKET IS STARTING TO RAMP UP BUT HAS NOT REALLY RAMPED UP IN Q2. THAT IS A Q3 AND Q4 STORY. WE'VE SEEN VERY, VERY, VERY STRONG MIDDLE CORRECTS WHICH BASICALLY MEANS EVERY REFINERY WHO CAN MAKE THESE WILL PROBABLY WANT TO RUN IT. STOCKS ARE LOW AND THEY CAN DO IT. ADD IT ALL UP, IT IS ALL BULLISH. THE QUESTION IN THE MARKET NOW IS, SOME OF THESE DRIVERS ARE GOING TO PROBABLY TURN. THE QUESTION IS WHEN. FRANCINE: WHEN DO YOU THINK THEY TURN? > > I THINK THE NEXT MONTH. BASICALLY, RIGHT NOW I THINK WE ARE GOING TO START SEEING BUILDS IN THE ATLANTIC BASIN. YOU NEED TO SEE STOCKS, BECAUSE THEY ARE LOW. AS LONG AS THERE ARE LOW, OIL DOES NOT COME UP. WE ARE STARTING TO SEE BUILDS. WE ARE RUNNING INTO THE SEASON AND THE ATLANTIC BASIN COME SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER. I AM SEEING BRAZIL INCREASE, I'M SEEING GULF OF MEXICO INCREASE. DIANA INCREASE. I'M GIVING IT ANOTHER FOUR TO FIVE WEEKS COME IN OF SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER, I THINK YOU WILL START TO SEE THE SYSTEM LINKS AND SIGNIFICANTLY AND THAT IS WHAT WE NEED FOR OIL TO COME OFF READ FRANCINE: WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR OPEC-PLUS AT THAT POINT? DIFFICULT DECISIONS TO MAKE. > > YEAH. THE QUESTION IS, WHAT IS THERE IF THERE IS ONE? WHAT IS THEIR INTERNAL THINKING? WE STARTED WITH -- FRANCINE: DO THEY HAVE A RANGE? > > I SUSPECT OF OIL STARTS TO SIGNIFICANTLY FALL BELOW 60, IF WE GET A FIVE HANDLE, I THINK IT IS AN ISSUE. AND MAYBE WE TALK ABOUT TAKING SUPPLIES OUT AGAIN. WE HAVE SEEN HOW DIFFICULT IT IS WITHIN OPEC TO GET AGREEMENT TO CUT FURTHER. I DON'T THINK THEY WILL RESPOND VERY QUICKLY. THE MARKET IS LENGTHENING. I THINK THAT WILL STOP THE INCREASE IN US FOR SEPTEMBER, I THINK BRING MORE OF THE VOLUNTARY CUTS BACK. THEY TAKE A PAUSE OR COME AND SEE HOW GOOD OR BAD IT WILL BE IN Q4, Q1 AND REASSESS IN APRIL LIKE THEY DID THIS YEAR AND MAYBE THEY WILL WANT TO UNWIND OR TAKE ACTION. FRANCINE: WHAT IS CHINA DOING? WE KNOW INDIA IS BUYING RUSSIAN BARRELS. HOW MUCH IS CHINA DOING THE SAME? > > CHINA IS BUYING 900, SO ABOUT HALF CURRENTLY MORE THAN HALF THAT INDIA WAS. LOOK, WHAT IS INTERESTING IN CHINA IS THAT ONE OF THE BIG SURPRISES WAS THEIR STOCK BUILDING. IT IS NOT LIKE DEMAND HAS MASSIVELY INCREASED IN CHINA AND THEY NEED MORE CRUDE. THEY REALLY WANT TO BUILD THE COMMERCIAL A STRATEGIC STOCK BASE TO INSULATE THEMSELVES I SUPPOSE AGAINST FURTHER SUPPLY ISSUES DOWN THE LINE. THAT NUMBER HAS BEEN REALLY HIGH. THE THING IS, THERE IS STILL CAPACITY TO INCREASE FURTHER. ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE MARKET AS WELL, CAN WE SEE THIS STOCK BUILDING IN CHINA IS SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO CONTINUE AT LEAST OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF QUARTERS? IF THAT HAPPENS, AND I THINK THERE'S ROOM FOR IT COME IT PUTS -- FRANCINE: WE KNOW PRESIDENT TRUMP WANTS TO BUILD. WHAT A SHALE GAS LOOKING LIKE IN THE U.S. OR SHARE OIL IN THE U.S. LOOKING LIKE? > > RATES ARE COMING DOWN. IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN -- THE ISSUE -- THE ISSUE BETWEEN LOW PRICES AND DRILL, BABY, DRILL, THOSE ARE KIND OF DIFFICULT. THEY ARE MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. IF YOU LOOK AT LET'S SAY WE ARE -- HIGH 60'S, MID 60'S, IT IS BORDERLINE. I THINK IT WAS HARD AS A GROWTH AT THOSE LEVELS. I THINK IT IS WHAT WE ARE SEEING. AT THESE LEVELS, IT IS HARD TO GROW BECAUSE THE CURVE DOESN'T REALLY GIVE YOU A LOT OF SUPPORT TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MONEY. WHAT WE DID SAY -- IN THE MIDDLE EASTERN SPIKE, SAW A LOT OF PRODUCERS AND THE WEST SHALE HEDGE PART OF THE PRODUCTION. THEY ARE LIMITED PRICE SENSITIVE. RATES ARE COMING OFF. I'M SEEING A LOT OF PRODUCERS SAYING, THIS DOES NOT QUITE WORK FOR US. I THINK YOU NEED TO SEE A LITTLE MORE UPSIDE INQUIRY BEFORE YOU REALLY CAN BECOME A POSITIVE INSHALE. SHENANDOAH IS COMING ON. IT IS REALLY ABOUT SHALE. IT IS PRICE-SENSITIVE AND I THINK WE ARE BORDERLINE. FRANCINE: THANK YOU FOR JOINING US, ALDO SPANJER OF BNP PARIBAS MARKETS 360. NORWAY SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND HAS DIVESTED FROM 11 IS REALLY COMPANIES AND TERMINATING CONTRACTS. IT FOLLOWS PUBLIC OUTCRY OVER INVESTMENTS LINKED TO THE WAR IN GAZA. THE FUND HELPS STOCK SOME 61 IS REALLY COMPANIES AS OF THE END OF JUNE, REMINDER, WE WILL BE SPEAKING TO NIKOLAI TENGION JUST AFTER 10:00 A.M. U.K. TIME. COMING UP, THE U.K. LOSES FEWER JOBS THAN EXPECTED. WHAT IT MEANS FOR RACHEL REEVES AND FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG.\" \u266a FRANCINE: MARKETS READY FOR THE RELEASE OF CPI LATER TODAY. LET'S BRING IN MARKETS EDITOR. THERE'S A LOT GOING ON. GREAT TO HAVE YOU IN LONDON. WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF DRIVERS FOR POTENTIALLY HOT PRINT? > > I'M KEEPING MY EYE ON THE CORE SERVICES PART OF THE INFLATION PRINT TODAY. IT IS JULY. WE AT POTENTIALLY A HOTTER PRINT BECAUSE OF SEASONAL TRENDS. TRAVEL SEASON, A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE BUYING MORE THINGS. THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR A BIT MORE OF AN INCREASE IN PRICES OF HOTELS AND CARS AND SERVICES LIKE THAT. THAT IS POTENTIALLY SOMETHING THAT WE COULD BE LOOKING AT DRIVING THAT NUMBER HIGHER. ALSO MAYBE SOMETHING THAT FED OFFICIALS MIGHT BE HAPPY TO IGNORE GIVEN THE SEASONALITY OF IT ALL. FRANCINE: HOW COULD THIS INFLUENCE FED CUT IN SEPTEMBER? > > IT FRAMES THAT DEBATE NICELY BECAUSE AS WE KNOW, MARKETS ARE GEARING MORE TOWARD TWO RATE CUTS BY THE END OF THIS YEAR BUT WE HAVE SEEN INCREASINGLY VOCAL NUMBER OF FED OFFICIALS CALLING FOR MORE THAN THAT. THREE RATE CUTS POTENTIALLY FROM BOWMAN AND WALLER. THE MOST VOCAL PROPONENTS OF THAT IDEA. THERE IS THIS DIVIDE BETWEEN WHAT MARKETS ARE EXPECTING, WHAT SOME FED OFFICIALS ARE CALLING FOR KAM AND I GUESS WITH THE MAJORITY OF THE FED BOARD IS LOOKING AT THE MOMENT WHICH IS MAYBE LEANING MORE TOWARD RESTRAINED PACE RATHER THAN MORE RATE CUTS. I THINK WHAT THIS PRINT WOULD DO IS EITHER RESULT -- RESOLVE SOME OF THAT DEBATE OR WIDEN THE DIVISIONS FURTHER DEPENDING ON HOW HOT OR NOT IT GOES. FRANCINE: WE HAVE A CHOICE BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA, SO THAT DEADLINE GOT PUSHED BACK BY NOVEMBER 10. I WONDER HOW MUCH THE FED -- THAT HAS TO DO WITH POSSIBLE INFLATION CREEPING UP AND THEREFORE A WIDER IMPACT ON MARKETS? > > I THINK SOME OF THE EUPHORIA WERE SINGING TERMS OF THE KNEE-JERK REACTION, DEFINITELY THINKING, OH, MAYBE THE INFLATION OR IMPACT FROM TARIFFS MIGHT BE DELAYED IF U.S. AND CHINA SOMEHOW MANAGED TO STRIKE SOME SORT OF DEAL WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE BETWEEN THEM WE HAD OF COURSE, STILL PEOPLE THINKING ABOUT THERE IS POTENTIALLY SOME INFLATION OR COMING THROUGH GIVEN EITHER EXPECT THE TARIFF LEVELS TO BE IN A LOWER THAN THEY CURRENTLY ARE, RIGHT, JUST A QUESTION OF ARE THEY GOING TO BE AS HIGH AS SOME ARE FEARING? THAT IS THE QUESTION HERE. I THINK THERE IS STILL SOME FEAR INFLATIONARY PASS-THROUGH. THAT IS WHERE THE FED DEBATE BECOMES IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT IS THE COUNTER WHAT IF WE ARE GOING TO SEE MORE RATE CUTS THAN EXPECTED, THAT COULD BE SOMETHING THAT OFFSETS THAT. STOCKS ARE HOPING THAT WE GET MORE FED SUPPORT BY THEN THERE'S ALWAYS THAT THREAT OF TARIFFS LINGERING AROUND THE CORNER. FRANCINE: KRISTINE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. PRESIDENT TRUMP HAS NAMED THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS AFTER FIRING THE PREVIOUS CHIEF FOLLOWING WEAK PAYROLL DATE IS IN JULY. HE HAS BEEN VOCAL ABOUT HIS CONCERNS WITH OFFICIAL JOBS DATA AND REVISIONS. THE POSITION IS SUBJECT TO SENATE CONFIRMATION. THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO SET TO HAVE EXPENDED HIS LIST OF POTENTIAL NEW FED CHAIRS . OFFICIALS HAVE TOLD BLOOMBERG THAT THE CENTRAL BANKS TWO VICE CHAIRS MICKEY BOWMAN AND JEFFERSON ARE NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION ALONG WITH THE DALLAS FED PRESIDENT LORI LOGAN. IT IS UNDERSTOOD THE TREASURY SECRETARY SCOTT BESSENT WILL INTERVIEW ADDITIONAL CANDIDATES IN THE COMING WEEKS AND SHORTLIST OF INDIVIDUALS HE RECOMMENDS TO MEET WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP. ON TO THE U.K. AND RINSE JOBS MARKET, APPEARS TO BE PASSED THE WORST WITH THE SMALLER THAN EXPECTED DROP IN PAYROLLS LAST MONTH. THE DATA FURTHER BECAUSE THE BANK OF ENGLAND'S DECISION OVER WHETHER TO CARRY ON CUTTING INTEREST RATES. WE ARE JOINED BY TWO GUESTS. I'M A BIG FAN OF WHAT DAN DOES AND ALL OF YOUR PROJECTIONS WHICH I CARED TO ADD THE BOE ARE ALWAYS RIGHT THAN MOST AND ALSO A BIG FAN OF YOUR NEWSLETTER. NO PRESSURE, DAN. IF YOU LOOK AT THE JOBS DATA, IT WAS BETTER BUT COMP LOCATES A LOT OF THINGS FOR THE BANK OF ENGLAND BECAUSE THEY LOOK AT GROWTH AND JOBS AND TALKED ABOUT WEAKER GROWTH -- WEAKER JOBS, BUT THEY HAVE INFLATION SO IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT THEY DO NEXT. > > IT IS. WHAT WAS INTERESTING ABOUT THE AUGUST DECISION IS THERE WAS THE SHIFT COME A DEFINITE SHIFT IN THE FOCUS AWAY FROM JOBS AND TOWARD INFLATION AND ELEVATED INFLATION. OVER THE COURSE OF MAY AND JUNE, THE BANK HAVE BEEN VERY WORRIED ABOUT THE JOBS MARKET. WHAT WE HAVE HAD IS A LOT OF REVISIONS TO SHOW THE SCALE OF THE LOOSENING OF THE JOB MARKET HAS NOT BEEN SO SIGNIFICANT. THE DATA THIS MORNING ADDS TO THAT WE HAD THE ONLY THING I COUNTER IT WITH IS WAGE GROWTH -- AND ONE OF THE INTERESTING THINGS ANDREW BAILEY SAID AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE WAS WAGE GROWTH IS OR WAS THE BIGGEST BIT OF INFORMATION, BIGGEST NEWS THEY HAD. IT UNDERSHOT THEIR FORECAST. IT IS CONTINUING TO UNDER SHOOT THEIR FORECAST. I THINK IF YOU TAKE THE DATA IN THE ROUND TODAY, AS YOU SAID AT THE BEGINNING, IT DOES NOT SOLVE ANY OF THIS MYSTERY. WE ARE STILL IN THE SAME PLACE. I THINK WHATEVER YOUR PRIOR WAS BEFORE THE DATA DROP THIS MORNING, IT PROBABLY HAS NOT CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. WE ALSO HAVE A LOT OF DATA. NO ONE IS GOING TO THINK THEY'RE GOING TO CUT IN SEPTEMBER BUT NOVEMBER IS THE ONE THAT PEOPLE ARE LOOKING AT AND POSSIBLY IF IT IS NOT NOVEMBER, DECEMBER. I THINK THEY VIEW PROBABLY WILL NOT HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY BUT THERE IS THIS STORY NOW POTENTIALLY EMERGING THAT THE JOBS MARKET IS BOTTOMING OUT AND THAT WILL CHANGE THE CALCULUS. FRANCINE: THEY HAD TO VOTE TWICE. YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE THINKING. IS THAT FAIR OR HARSH? > > I DON'T THINK IT IS HARSH. ONE THING I WOULD OBSERVE IF YOU GO BACK EVEN OVER THE PAST 2, 3 YEARS, TO THINK ABOUT THE BANK OF ENGLAND COMPARED TO SAY THE FED OR THE ECB, HAPPY SURPRISE. THEY'RE HAPPY TO SURPRISE MARKETS. THEY DID THAT IN NOVEMBER 2021 AND JUNE 2023, 50 BASIS POINT HIKE AND EVERYONE THOUGHT 25 AND THEY PAUSED IN SEPTEMBER 2023 WHEN EVERYONE THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO HIKE. THEY ARE HAPPY TO SURPRISE. THE ONE TO WATCH OVER THE NEXT 2, 3 MONTHS WILL BE ANDREW BAILEY BECAUSE HE IS THE MEDIAN VOTER NOW. IF HE SWITCHES, YOU HAVE 5-4 THE OTHER WAY. WHAT HE SAYS WILL BE THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF THE COMMUNICATION OVER THE NEXT THREE MONTHS OR SO. FRANCINE: WE HAVE ALL THIS NEW SO MANY OF THE ENTRY BAILEY PRESS CONFERENCES AND THERE IS ALWAYS -- HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN CAREFUL IN SAYING IT, BUT A LOT OF THE UNCERTAINTY HE IS DEALING WITH IS I GUESS DOMESTICALLY MADE. SOME OF THE LABOUR POLICY PUT IN PLACE FROM THAT FIRST BUDGET BY THE CHANCELLOR. ARE WE OVER THE WORST? THERE WERE TWO THINGS THAT ANNOUNCED THAT CAME IN EFFECT IN APRIL WITH THE JOBS NUMBERS GETTING BETTER, DOES THAT MEAN THINGS NORMALIZE? > > IT IS TRICKY BECAUSE OUR PROBLEM IS WE HAVE ANOTHER BUDGET COMING UP. IN A FUNNY WAY, REPEAT OF LAST YEAR. LAST YEAR, THE GOVERNMENT WAS ELECTED, CAME IN AND PEOPLE WERE FEELING UPBEAT UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN THEY SAID, OH, MY GOODNESS, THINGS ARE TERRIBLE. THAT SAID IT A PERIOD OF MILD PANIC BEFORE THE ACTUAL BUDGET. THE ACTUAL BUDGET ENDED UP KIND OF A PUNCH IN THE FACE. DROVE UP EMPLOYING PEOPLE QUITE DRASTICALLY. THEY HAVE HAD TO UNWIND A LOT OF THE REFORMS. LOOKING AT A SORT OF EQUALLY BLACK HOLE COMING INTO THIS BUDGET. ALL THE EMPLOYERS KNOW AND EMPLOYEES KNOW AS SOMETHING THAT IS PROBABLY GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU HAVE THAT TENSION. I MEAN, WHAT IS MIRACULOUS TO ME IF I'M HONEST COME THE LABOR MARKET IS FRANCINE: A STRONG AS IT IS. FRANCINE:WHY DO YOU THINK THAT IS? > > THERE IS MORE SPENDING AND THE ECONOMY. ONE THING WE DO FORGET IS FOR ALL THE DOOM AND GLOOM IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR, THE BALANCE ARE BROADLY IN DECENT SHAPE. MUCH BETTER SHAPE THAN IN 2008. HE LEVERAGED -- I THINK HAS CAPACITY TO ABSORB THE SHOCK THEY HAVE HAD. IDEALLY, MAYBE THE CHANCELLOR WILL TRY AND DROP SOME HINTS AS TO HOW THAT IT IS GOING TO BE. EQUALLY, I DON'T THINK SHE'S IN A POSITION ABLE TO DO THAT. WE HAVE NOT HAD A BUDGET DATE SET YET, WHICH MEANS IT WILL BE QUITE LATE IN THE YEAR. AND SO SHE IS JUST GOT HER FINGERS CROSSED HOPING SOMETHING -- FRANCINE: SOMETHING GOOD. > > IDEALLY. FRANCINE: WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING IN THE BUDGET? > > JOHN IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT THE RISK OF WHENEVER THE BUDGET IS BETWEEN NOW AND THAT POINT, WE GET A REPEAT OF LAST YEAR WHERE PEOPLE WORRY ABOUT WHAT IS COMING AND THAT IS SORT OF RELATIVELY LESS WORST THAN EXPECTED JOB STATED THAT WE GOT TODAY, THINGS START GOING BACK THE OTHER WAY. IN MY OPINION ON THE BUDGET, THERE WILL BE A BLACK HOLE OF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 20 BILLION POUNDS TO 30 BILLION POUNDS SHE WILL NEED TO FILL. THE BIG REASON FOR THAT IS TO DO WITH THE FORECAST AND THE FACT THEY'VE BEEN VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE MEDIUM TERM ECONOMIC OUTLOOK. CHANCES ARE THEY WILL REVISE THAT DOWN, PARTICULARLY AROUND PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH WHICH IS ONE REASON WHY THE JOBS MARKET MIGHT HAVE HELD UP IS THE FIRMS DO TO EMPLOY MORE PEOPLE JUST TO SERVICE A VERY WEAK AMOUNT OF, SMALL AMOUNT OF DEMAND BECAUSE PRODUCTIVITY OF GROWTH IS SO WE CAN THE U.K. THAT IS ANOTHER REASON THE JOBS MARKET HAS BEEN MORE RESILIENT THAN EXPECTED. SHE WILL HAVE TO FILL THIS GAP. WHERE SHE GETS THE MONEY FROM, I THINK IF -- IT SEEMS UNLIKELY TO ME WILL GO ON BUSINESS AGAIN. I THINK YOU'RE LOOKING ON INDIVIDUALS, POSSIBLY THE WEALTHY, BUT ALSO WITH THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT IS NEEDED, IT IS VERY HARD NOT TO PULL OFF AN INCOME TAX LEVER BECAUSE THEY JUST RAISE SO MUCH MORE MONEY THAN THESE OTHER TAXES THAT HAVE VERY MOBILE TAX BASES BUT ALSO DON'T RAISE THAT BIG AMOUNT OF MONEY. FRANCINE: WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT HOUSE PRICES. FIRST OF ALL, OASIS. I WISH THIS IS BASICALLY LIKE TAYLOR SWIFT. THERE ARE GETTING A BOOST TO THIS COUNTRY. > > YES. THE OASIS COULD BOOST CPI -- I WAS READING THIS MORNING A STORY BY TOM REESE THAT OTHER ECONOMISTS HAVE ESTIMATED IT MIGHT BE I THINK THREE BASIS POINTS TO FOUR BASIS POINTS. TO PUT THAT IN CONTEXT, INSTEAD OF IT BEING INFLATION READING UP 3.6, IT WILL BE 3.64. IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THE UNCERTAINTY WE HAVE GOT ABOUT INFLATION AND THE DIFFICULTY FORECASTING IT, THAT IS QUITE A SMALL AMOUNT. NONETHELESS, IT WILL MAKE FOR AN INTERESTING STORY WHEN THE DATA DROPS. FRANCINE: JOHN IS GOING TO START A RENDITION. HOUSE PRICES COME UP OR DOWN? > > FALLING IN REAL TERMS IN TERMS OF INFLATION. FRANCINE: WE HAVE TO BRING THE U.K. SHOW BACK. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO TALK ABOUT U.K.. DAN HANSEN AND JOHN STEPEK. REMINDER TO SIGN UP TO DAWN STALEY NEWSLETTER -- TWO JOHN'S DAILY NEWSLETTER. UP NEXT, BLOOMBERG BRIEF. THEY WILL BE TALKING ABOUT CPI AND U.K. JOBS AND OF COURSE EVERYTHING TO DO WITH TECH. THIS IS \"BLOOMBERG.\" \u266a",

  "summary": "China has urged local companies to avoid using Nvidia' H20 processors, which are notoriously difficult and complex, in an effort to recover billions in lost Chinese revenue. This comes as President Trump extends the Trade Truce with China for an additional 90 days. This follows an agreement with the Trump administration to give the US government a 15% CUT of the RELATED REVENUE. The move comes as China criticizes H20's complexity and aggressive tactics towards the U.S. in relation to the situation. Critics believe this is part of a wider effort to counterbalance the ongoing dispute between the two countries' economies. The article discusses the implications of this strategy and the potential for disruption to the US-China relationship.",
