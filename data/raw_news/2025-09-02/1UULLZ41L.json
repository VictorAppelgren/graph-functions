  "content": "September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. To support this important cause, well-known podcast network Relay FM has launched its annual fundraiser for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, located in Memphis, Tennessee. Since 2019, the Relay FM community has raised more than $4 million for the hospital.\n\n\n\nSt. Jude's mission statement is that no child is denied treatment:\n\nThe mission of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital is to advance cures, and means of prevention, for pediatric catastrophic diseases through research and treatment. Consistent with the vision of our founder Danny Thomas, no child is denied treatment based on race, religion or a family's ability to pay.\n\nRelay FM has multiple Apple-related podcasts, such as Connected, hosted by Stephen Hackett, Myke Hurley, and Federico Viticci. Hackett's son received treatment at St. Jude as an infant, so this initiative is near and dear to him and his family.\n\nDonations can be made on the Relay FM for St. Jude website, with rewards such as Relay FM stickers, wallpapers, and a macOS screensaver available depending on how much you donate. You can also start your own fundraiser team and earn additional rewards.\n\nIf you cannot donate, consider spreading the word about the fundraiser.",

      "text": "September is around the corner, and that means our campaign to raise money for St. Jude is back!\nIn 2009, our oldest son Josiah began treatment at St. Jude for a brain tumor. He was just six months old. After 18 rounds of chemotherapy and a half-dozen surgeries, the cancer has not returned, but our family is forever changed.\nWe learned what it meant to suffer, and how it felt to fear the worst. We learned how to operate on very little sleep, and how to rely on our friends and family for not just support, but even for the basics of everyday life. Those 18 rounds of chemo were hard, but they worked, and as our son has grown, so has our response to the entire ordeal. Slowly, anger and despair faded, being replaced with a desire to give back to the place that saved Josiah\u2019s life.\nAs I\u2019m sure you know, St. Jude is a special place. It is leading the way the world understands, treats and defeats childhood cancer, and other life-threatening diseases. If that sounds expensive, it\u2019s because it is, but the bill isn\u2019t passed to the families of patients. At St. Jude, no child is denied treatment based on race, religion or a family\u2019s ability to pay.\nThat\u2019s what makes our fundraising campaign so important to me. I want to help give to others what was given to me. I want families facing the unthinkable to do so without the fear that saving their child will mean financial ruin. I want kids who will never step foot on St. Jude\u2019s campus to benefit from the research done there. Most of all, I want the day to come to where no child dies in the dawn of life.\nThat takes all of us. In our little corner of the world, the Relay community has raised over $4 million for St. Jude since 2019, and I can\u2019t wait to see what this year will bring.\nWhen I stepped foot on St. Jude\u2019s campus with my son in 2009, I had no idea where life was taking us, but I\u2019m thankful it\u2019s here."
