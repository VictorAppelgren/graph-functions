  "content": "Shocking footage has emerged of a man proudly holding an Australian flag being set upon and punched by pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nHundreds of students skipped class and took to the streets of Melbourne last Thursday to protest against the war in Gaza, sparking chaotic scenes.\n\nThe Students for Palestine strike action shut down Flinders Street and brought traffic and tram services to a halt, sparking a fiery standoff with police.\n\nTensions became more volatile when a man carrying an Australian flag strode into the middle of a circle of protesters sitting in a busy intersection.\n\nHe was set upon by several protesters, one of whom punched him in the face.\n\nPolice quickly intervened and pulled the man from the chaos to defuse the situation.\n\nNationals MP Andrew Willcox described the protesters' actions as 'absolutely disgraceful' and called for the alleged attacker to be charged.\n\n'I'm as patriotic as could possibly be, my blood boils when I see this,' he told Sky News host Rowan Dean.\n\n'As the footage goes on, what I'm really concerned about is then the police actually take away the gentleman who was carrying the Australian flag.\n\n'I'm hoping they took him away to buy him a beer and then went back to arrest that coward who punched him from the side.\n\n'He should be easy enough to find. He needs to be arrested and the full force of the law thrown onto him.'\n\nFormer Coalition Speaker of the House Bronwyn Bishop was just as horrified by the shocking scenes.\n\nBut she pointed the finger at the federal Labor government, which has since made the landmark decision to recognise the state of Palestine.\n\n'This intolerance that has been bred by Anthony Albanese and Penny Wong and their policies towards supporting the Gaza cause and absolutely giving the wrong leadership about sympathising with Jewish Australians leads to this sort of behaviour,' she told Dean.\n\n'Fish rots from the head and that's what [is] happening here. The government is rotting from the head.\n\n'And until we get some moral courage back and we start to say 'in this country, we won't tolerate this sort of behaviour', that requires the police to act, not against the victim but against the perpetrator.'\n\nNo arrests or charges have been laid in relation to the incident.\n\nVictoria Police confirmed to Daily Mail that one man was moved on for breaching the peace.\n\nFive protesters were arrested for obstructing the roadway, who will be charged on summons.\n\nThe protest was held days after a massive pro-Palestine rally involving up to 90,000 people across the Sydney Harbour Bridge brought the city to a standstill.",
