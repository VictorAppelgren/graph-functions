      "summary": "Paper checks are becoming a costly and risky B2B payment method as postage costs rise and delivery delays increase, eroding the value of check float and exposing firms to higher fraud rates. Digital alternatives like dynamic discounting, automated cash flow management, and virtual cards offer faster settlement, fraud protection, and better supplier relationships. Despite the shift, many companies still rely on legacy check processes, driving inefficiencies and higher operational costs. The trend underscores a broader move toward digitized, automated payments to improve working capital and competitive advantage.",
