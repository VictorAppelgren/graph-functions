      "feedback": "**Actionable feedback (compact paragraph)**  \nYour draft is a solid first pass but still falls short of world‑class rigor. First, break the piece into three logical blocks—macro backdrop, sector‑level dynamics, and firm‑specific analysis—so the causal chain (Fed tightening → higher real rates → higher cost of capital → earnings compression → equity pricing) is explicit and each link is supported by a numeric anchor (e.g., Fed policy rate 5.5 % → real rate 2.5 % → 3‑4 % earnings drag; cite ID 3GW34ISLC for the 4.7 % safe‑withdrawal revision). Second, embed first‑principles anchors: real‑rate differential, Taylor‑rule reaction function, BoP deficit, and productivity growth; quantify each (e.g., US trade deficit $1.2 trn, productivity growth 1.8 %/yr). Third, for each sector, list concrete catalysts and invalidation points with ranges (e.g., Rivian’s R2 launch price $45k, expected 2027 EBITDA breakeven; Tesla gross margin 17.9 % vs. 17.2 % last year; cite IDs P0K0UEOHU, 4LQD15CFU). Fourth, tighten the narrative: replace generic statements (“higher real rates compress earnings”) with quantified impacts (“a 0.5 % real‑rate rise cuts EBIT by ~2 % on average; cite ID 3GW34ISLC”). Fifth, ensure every claim has a citation ID—add Fed data (e.g., ID 3GW34ISLC for CPI 3.5 %), Tesla delivery numbers (ID P0K0UEOHU), and insurance dividend yield decline (ID TN66GHPAT). Sixth, reconcile conflicting data: if Tesla’s gross margin is 17.9 % but its free cash flow is $146 M, explain the margin‑to‑cash‑flow mismatch. Seventh, conclude with a concise base‑case (Fed hikes at 0.25 %/quarter, inflation 2.5 %, EV adoption 15 % CAGR), key risks (recession, supply‑chain shock, EV demand slowdown), watch signals (Fed minutes, core CPI, EV sales, corporate earnings), and confidence rating (moderate‑high). Finally, trim the prose to ~450 words, keep the tone analytical, and avoid any generic platitudes.",
