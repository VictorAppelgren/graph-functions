  "description": "Additional employees at an Arkansas prison have been disciplined for not following procedures at a prison where an inmate known as the \u201cDevil in the Ozarks\u201d escaped earlier this summer",
  "content": "The dock had played a key role in the May 25 escape of Grant Hardin from the prison, formally known as the North Central Unit. Two employees at the facility, including one who allowed Hardin on the dock unsupervised, had previously been fired in the weeks following his escape. Hardin held a job in the prison's kitchen.\n\nHardin was captured 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) northwest of the Calico Rock prison on June 6. Authorities said he escaped by donning an outfit designed to look like a law enforcement uniform. The outfit was crafted from an inmate uniform and a kitchen apron dyed black using a marker, while a soup can lid and a Bible cover were fashioned to look like a badge, corrections officials told the panel last month.\n\nThe other employee who had been fired earlier had opened the gate that Hardin walked through without confirming his identity.\n\nPayne said corrections officials have nearly completed the report on their critical incident review of the escape. A report on the State Police's investigation into the escape has also been sent to the governor's office, the Department of Public Services said.\n\nPayne said the review also found that Hardin had been incorrectly classified as eligible to be housed at Calico Rock, which is primarily a medium-security facility. Hardin had been held at the Calico Rock prison since 2017. Payne said he didn't know why Hardin wasn't correctly classified.\n\n\u201cWithout an override, he should not have been there,\u201d Payne said.\n\nAfter he was captured, Hardin was taken to a maximum-security prison. Hardin has pleaded not guilty to an escape charge and is set to go on trial in November.\n\nHardin, a former police chief in the small town of Gateway, near the Arkansas-Missouri border, is serving lengthy sentences for murder and rape. He was the subject of the TV documentary \u201cDevil in the Ozarks.\u201d\n\nOne change that has been made at the facility since the escape is an increase in searches outside the facility, Payne said. Officials have previously said Hardin fashioned a ladder out of wooden pallets that he kept on the dock.\n\n\u201cThe back dock area was not searched enough, or they would have found he was hiding items on that back dock,\u201d he said.\n\nPayne faced further pushback from lawmakers who said the escape points to a more systemic issue than two employees not doing their job.\n\n\u201cYeah, people didn't do their job, but also there should be checks and balances to ensure that people do their job,\u201d Republican Sen. Ben Gilmore said. \u201cWhere are those checks and balances?\u201d",

(AP) \u2014 A former police chief in Arkansas who is serving decades-long sentences for murder and rape escaped from prison Sunday, state corrections officials said.\nGrant Hardin, the former police chief of the tiny town of Gateway near the Arkansas-Missouri border, escaped from the North Central Unit in Calico Rock, where he has been held since 2017. Corrections officials did not provide any details about how he escaped.\nThey did say that Hardin had disguised himself and was \u201cwearing a makeshift outfit designed to mimic law enforcement when he escaped the North Central Unit.\u201d\nThe Division of Correction and the Division of Community Correction are following leads with local, state and federal law enforcement agencies.\nHardin pleaded guilty in October 2017 to first-degree murder in connection with the shooting death of 59-year-old James Appleton. According to an affidavit filed in the case, Appleton worked for the Gateway water department and was talking to his brother-in-law, then Gateway Mayor Andrew Tillman, when he was shot in the head on Feb. 23, 2017, near Garfield. Police found Appleton\u2019s body inside a car.\nHardin, who was Gateway\u2019s police chief for about four months in early 2016, was sentenced to 30 years in prison. He is also serving 50 years in prison for the 1997 rape of an elementary school teacher in Rogers north of Fayetteville.\nKFSM-TV, reporting on his guilty plea in 2019, wrote that police used DNA samples from the crime scene to apply for a John Doe Warrant in 2003 as the statute of limitations neared. The DNA was tested against old and new profiles, and investigators got a match when Hardin was imprisoned for killing Appleton.\n___\nThis story was first published May. 26, 2025. It was updated May. 27, 2025, to correct the spelling on one instance of the last name of the man who escaped. It is Hardin, not Garvin."

(AP) \u2014 Two employees at an Arkansas prison where an inmate known as the \u201cDevil in the Ozarks\u201d escaped have been fired for policy violations, corrections officials said Thursday as they faced questions from lawmakers who said the escape points to deeper problems.\nThe head of the Arkansas Board of Corrections told state lawmakers the violations allowed Grant Hardin to escape from the Calico Rock prison wearing a makeshift law enforcement uniform on May 25. But officials have said there was no evidence employees knowingly assisted Hardin\u2019s escape.\nOne of the fired employees had allowed Hardin onto an outside kitchen dock unsupervised and the other employee worked in a tower and had opened the gate Hardin walked through without confirming his identity, Chairman Benny Magness said.\n\u201cIf either one of them would have been following policy, it wouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d Magness told members of the Legislative Council\u2019s charitable, penal, and correctional institutions subcommittee.\nHardin was captured 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) northwest of the Calico Rock prison on June 6. Authorities said he escaped by donning an outfit designed to look like a law enforcement uniform. Magness said the outfit was crafted from an inmate uniform and kitchen apron dyed black using a marker while a soup can lid and a Bible cover were fashioned to look like a badge.\nLawmakers said the escape pointed to systemic problems beyond the two employees \u2014 including how Hardin was able to fashion the fake uniform without guards noticing.\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve got major issues here that need to be dealt with,\u201d said Republican Sen. Matt McKee, who co-chairs the subcommittee.\nHardin, a former police chief in the small town of Gateway, near the Arkansas-Missouri border, is serving lengthy sentences for murder and rape. He was the subject of the TV documentary \u201cDevil in the Ozarks.\u201d\nAfter his capture, Hardin was transferred to a maximum security prison in Varner, a small community about 65 miles (125 kilometers) southeast of Little Rock.\nHardin has pleaded not guilty to an escape charge and is set to go on trial in November.\nHardin held a job in the kitchen in the prison and had not had any disciplinary problems during his time there.\nIn addition to the uniform, Hardin fashioned a ladder out of wooden pallets that were on the dock and also took peanut butter sandwiches from the prison to survive on after his escape, corrections officials told lawmakers Thursday.\nHardin planned to use the ladder to scale the fence and escape if the gate wasn\u2019t opened for him, said Dexter Payne, director of the division of correction.\n\u201cThere are a lot of things he did unnoticed and unaware,\u201d Republican Sen. Ben Gilmore said during the hearing. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can blame just two people for that.\u201d\nMembers of the panel also said Hardin\u2019s escape points to the need to scrutinize a classification system that placed a convicted murderer in what\u2019s primarily a medium-security facility.\nPayne said a critical incident review of the escape planned later this month may determine if other employees will face firings, demotions or disciplinary actions. It also will determine what other policy changes may be needed, he said.\nState Police is also investigating the escape to determine whether any laws, policies or procedures were violated in the escape. Col. Mike Hagar, the head of state police and secretary of public safety, said the final report on the investigation may be completed within 30 days.\nThomas Hurst, warden of the prison \u2014formally called the North Central Unit \u2014 said State Police was not notified immediately of the escape though local police were, blaming it on a miscommunication.\n\u201cThere\u2019s nobody that\u2019s more embarrassed about (the escape) than me,\u201d Hurst said. \u201cIt\u2019s not good. We failed, and I understand it.\u201d"
