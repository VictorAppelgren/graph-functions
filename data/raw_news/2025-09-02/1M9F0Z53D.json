  "content": "Plus, exactly what the pills are usually dished out for\n\nFATAL DOSE Common anxiety drugs prescribed to 50 million \u2018increases risk of death\u2019 \u2013 are you at risk?\n\nHEART pills given to thousands of Brits every year may actually put women at greater risk of dying, scientists warn.\n\nBeta blockers, prescribed to around 50,000 Brits a year, are routinely handed to heart attack survivors to ease strain on the heart and cut the risk of deadly rhythm problems.\n\nBut the results from a Spanish trial suggest the medication is ineffective and does not help reduce the risk of death or further heart attacks.\n\nWomen treated with the drug were nearly three times more likely to die compared to those who did not take it, researchers found.\n\nThey were also more likely to suffer another heart attack or end up back in hospital with heart failure.\n\nDr Valentin Fuster, general director of the National Center for Cardiovascular Investigation in Madrid, said: \"These findings will reshape all international clinical guidelines on the use of beta-blockers in men and women and should spark a long-needed, sex-specific approach to treatment for cardiovascular disease.\n\n\"We found no benefit in using beta-blockers for men or women with preserved heart function after heart attack despite this being the standard of care for some 40 years.\"\n\nPrevious studies into the beat blockers have found they can trigger fatigue, nausea and even sexual dysfunction.\n\nFor the new study, published in the European Heart Journal , scientists tracked 8,505 patients in 109 hospitals who had survived a heart attack but whose heart function was still good.\n\nHalf were put on beta blockers, half were not.\n\nAfter four years, there was no overall benefit in preventing deaths or hospitalisations.\n\nHowever, when assessing women's results specifically, they found women who were treated with beta-blockers were significantly more likely to have another heart attack or be hospitalised for heart failure.\n\nThey also had a 2.7 per cent higher risk of death compared to those not treated with beta-blockers.\n\nDr Borja Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez, scientific director for Madrid's National Center for Cardiovascular Investigation and study co-author, said: \"After a heart attack, patients are typically prescribed multiple medications, which can make adherence difficult.\n\n\"Beta blockers were added to standard treatment early on because they significantly reduced mortality at the time.\n\n\"Their benefits were linked to reduced cardiac oxygen demand and arrhythmia prevention. But therapies have evolved.\n\n\"Today, occluded coronary arteries are reopened rapidly and systematically, drastically lowering the risk of serious complications such as arrhythmias.\n\n\"In this new context, where the extent of heart damage is smaller, the need for beta blockers is unclear.\n\n\"While we often test new drugs, it's much less common to rigorously question the continued need for older treatments.\"\n\nPatients should not stop taking medication without speaking to their doctor first.",

  "summary": "Scientists have warned that common anxiety drugs, which are often given to around 50,000 Brits a year, may increase women's risk of death by nearly three times as much as three times more likely to die than those who did not take it. The drugs are used to ease stress on the heart and reduce the risk of heart problems. However, a Spanish trial found that women treated with beta-blockers were significantly more likely than those not treated with it, and were also more susceptible to another heart attack or hospitalisation.
