  "title": "BlackBerry Classic is being revived with Android, and it can be yours for $400",
  "description": "A Chinese company is reviving the decade-old BlackBerry Classic with new hardware and installing Android on it for a modern experience.",
  "content": "BlackBerry was more than a phone brand. It was a long-running phenomenon that would instantly shape your impression of the person using it as someone important. And so, it isn\u2019t surprising to see so many people longing for its revival. While I never owned a high-end BlackBerry (though I always wanted the Torch with a slide-out QWERTY), there is a tiny chance I might be able to do that soon.\n\nThat\u2019s because a Chinese company is on a mission to revive old BlackBerry devices, with a twist. A brand named Zinwa Technologies is working on resurrecting a limited number of decade-old BlackBerry Classic Q20 devices and installing Android on them. The reborn phone will be sold as Zinwa Q25 Pro.\n\nTo make sure the hardware is compatible with Android, Zinwa is retrofitting the BlackBerry Classic with a new main board, equipped with a more recent MediaTek Helio G99 chipset, 12GB of RAM, and up to 256GB of onboard storage. The Classic\u2019s touchscreen also helps avoid any friction with the Android interface.\n\nAmong other changes, Zinwa has upgraded the Q20\u2019s original battery by almost 15% and added new cameras, including a 50MP on the back and an 8MP for the front. Meanwhile, the newer chipset brings support for 4G LTE, although the current model does not feature 5G support. The team has also replaced the micro USB port with a newer USB Type-C for faster charging and data transfer speeds.\n\nBased on demos shared by the team, BlackBerry\u2019s signature capacitive trackpad runs seamlessly on the revived device. The Zinwa Q25 Pro currently runs on a bare-bones version of Android 13, and there are no concrete plans from the company to update to newer versions, unless there is enough interest to foster development. So, if you\u2019re inclined to buy it, ensure you purchase this without expecting long-term support from the company.\n\nHowever, if all goes well, Zinwa might explore retrofitting other BlackBerry models, including the Passport and KeyOne, the latter of which was among the limited BlackBerry phones that came pre-installed with Android.\n\nThe Zinwa Q25 Pro is priced at $400, but the company is also selling a DIY kit to transform your old BlackBerry Classic for $320. Both of these are available on an online store, while the company also sells the camera modules and battery separately.\n\nZinwa plans to start shipping the Q25 Pro by the end of August to the first 100 backers and aims to go into mass production by mid-September. If you\u2019re interested in the project, you can join its Discord channel for more updates on shipping and other models under consideration for refurbishment. Who knows, with Android 16\u2019s improved support for physical keyboards, it might be a success.",

      "text": "Affiliate links on Android Authority may earn us a commission. Learn more.\nAndroid 16's support for external keyboards blew my mind\nAugust 9, 2025\nIt\u2019s been years since I last tried to pair a Bluetooth or USB keyboard with my Android phone. After being a physical QWERTY proponent for years and hating on touchscreen typing, I wholly but slowly embraced pecking on a glass surface. There were a few times I wished I had a keyboard for my Android tablets, but it wasn\u2019t frequent enough to make me pay for one.\nThat changed a few weeks ago when I started testing the Clicks Keyboard with my Pixel 9 Pro, which is running Android 16\u2018s latest QPR3 beta. I\u2019d seen my colleague Mishaal Rahman cover Google\u2019s work on keyboard support for years, but I honestly didn\u2019t expect it to be this good. So here\u2019s my rundown of all the excellent things I enjoy about using an external keyboard with Android 16.\nHave you used an external keyboard with your Android phone or tablet?\nIt starts from the moment I plug the keyboard in\nWhen I plug the Clicks Keyboard into my Pixel 9 Pro and tap a text field, a small floating button instantly appears on the display with the currently selected language. In the image above, you can see the floating \u201cUS\u201d in the middle left of the screen, but the screenshots below show it more clearly.\nThat floating toolbar was added to Gboard a couple of Android versions ago, but it remains a highlight feature today. Instead of CTRL + Space\u2019ing through languages and hoping you land on the one you want to use, you can select the exact one you want. It brings so much more than language selection, too.\nI don't have to choose between using Gboard or plugging an external keyboard to get all of Gboard's features.\nThere are menus to show Gboard\u2019s most useful features, so that I don\u2019t miss out on those perks by opting to use a physical keyboard. Emojis, GIFs, clipboard history, quick translations, voice typing; they\u2019re all there with a reminder of the shortcut that triggers them.\nBetter yet, I can switch that floating button to a sticky full-width bottom toolbar that provides autocorrect suggestions, the next predicted words, and a voice input key. This also makes it faster to use Gboard\u2019s excellent suggestions for pasting things I just copied, using autofill from 1Password (or any other password manager), or adding an automatically-detected 2FA code I just received via text. I\u2019m so glad I don\u2019t have to choose between using Gboard or plugging an external keyboard to get all of these features. I get the best of both worlds.\nThere are more time-saving keyboard shortcuts than I can remember\nUsing a physical keyboard with an Android phone or tablet, whether it\u2019s via Bluetooth or USB, is an exercise in frustration and steep learning curves. Android is built to be a finger-navigated interface with swipes, gestures, and on-screen buttons to tap. I didn\u2019t realize how often I need to reach out to the screen to do something that had no corresponding key on my keyboard before I started using one.\nBut Android 14 introduced an expanded list of keyboard shortcuts with many system-level actions available via a combination of keys. Instead of changing my grip to press the power and volume button and take a screenshot, I can type Search + S. Search + N drops down the notifications, Search + H goes to the home screen, Search + Tab opens the recent apps list, and of course, I can always Ctrl + C and Ctrl + V to copy and paste.\nI thought I had to reach up to the screen to scroll through long lists, but the Space bar does it.\nThere are over 20 system-level shortcuts, four accessibility shortcuts, and nine Gboard shortcuts, all browsable in a quick list from the toolbar or by typing Search + /. A few extra hidden shortcuts are also there, like tapping the space bar to scroll down through any app, which is especially handy when reading an article in Chrome.\nI love that I can open the app list from any app, no matter what I\u2019m doing, with the Search button. I can quickly resize windows in split-screen with Search + Ctrl + Right or Left. I also appreciate that Google has allowed several of its most important apps to be accessible via shortcuts. My most-used ones are the following five, and the fact that I can open them from any app without having to pass by the home screen or app launcher is a big time-saver.\n- Search + C = Google Calendar\n- Search + B = Chrome\n- Search + E = Gmail\n- Search + M = Google Maps\n- Search + Y = YouTube\nThe entire shortcut menu is searchable, was made more tablet-friendly with Android 15, and has now become customizable with Android 16. You can only choose your custom shortcuts on tablets, but Google says that the functionality will also come to phones soon. I just wish Google would add a built-in functionality to assign shortcuts to any app we want, not just its own. I\u2019d love to go to WhatsApp, Spotify, Slack, or Asana with my own shortcuts.\nI didn\u2019t know I needed all these extra options\nBeyond all these features, Android has gone above and beyond to make the keyboard experience more adaptable and accessible. The keyboard you\u2019re using might not have a dedicated Caps Lock key or Action/Search key, but you can assign that in the Modifier keys menu under Physical keyboard settings.\nIf you change the selected language, you can preview what the keyboard layout is supposed to be like, just in case it\u2019s different from your physical keyboard. No one wants to tap Q and get A, oh ye, AZERTY people\u2026\nAnd then there are the more obscure features, like customizing when a long-press on a key causes the letter to be repeatedly entered, and a bunch of accessibility improvements from Android 15 that shorten the time it takes to register a press or remove the silly requirement to press all shortcut keys at the same time to trigger something. On a physical keyboard as small as the Clicks Keyboard that I\u2019m using right now, this makes sense even if you don\u2019t have motor issues \u2014 it\u2019s just easier to press Search then Ctrl instead of trying to hit both tiny adjacent keys together.\nAndroid also has an option to emulate a mouse on a physical keyboard, letting anyone move the cursor left, right, up, down, and in all directions, as well as use it to select a field. This makes more sense on a full keyboard, though; I tried using it on Clicks, but the unconventional lack of a number row made it more complicated.\nThis has made me want a keyboard for my Pixel Tablet\nEvery feature I thought I needed when using a physical keyboard on my Pixel 9 Pro is already there in Android 16. And the few that I missed or didn\u2019t work as intended were due to the slightly limited layout of the Clicks keyboard and its lack of dedicated arrows and a number row. Other physical keyboards with these would be even more of a joy to use.\nIt baffles me that it\u2019s all progressed so much at a time when using an external keyboard with Android isn\u2019t, technically, the hottest thing. Yes, there are a few Android tablets out there that offer a keyboard attachment, but they\u2019re not the norm and Google\u2019s own Pixel Tablet doesn\u2019t have one (even if rumors suggested it so many times).\nAll the pieces are there to build a great computing experience on top of Android.\nThis is proof of Google\u2019s commitment to improving the entire Android experience on tablets. Handwriting and mouse support have also taken leaps ahead, and all of it has made me itch for a full-on mobile computing experience based on Android.\nWith Google\u2019s plans to merge Android and Chrome OS, extension support coming to Chrome on Android, Android\u2019s new desktop mode, and all the work happening on the Linux Terminal, having a usable desktop experience on Android isn\u2019t a pipe dream anymore. Physical keyboard support will play a huge role in that, obviously, and I just can\u2019t wait to see whatever Google decides to launch as a successor to the Pixel Tablet when all the elements are ready. With a keyboard attachment, of course.\nThank you for being part of our community. Read our Comment Policy before posting."
