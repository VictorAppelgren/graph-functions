  "description": "It's Glen Powell, but not as we know him.",
  "content": "Glen Powell is picking up the pace this year in a big way. Besides sprinting through highly explosive chaos in Edgar Wright's take on Running Man, he'll also be taking to the field under the discreet and in no way suspicious alias of Chad Powers in a brand new comedy series streaming on Hulu.\n\nCo-created by former NFL quarterbacks Eli and Peyton Manning, the series features Powell as a sports-star-in-the-making, Russ Holliday, who gets a little too big for his football cleats and fumbles a touchdown that costs his team the college championship game. Fast forward eight years, and with his career having taken a nosedive and no future in the sport he's devoted his life to, Holliday tries a different play.\n\nUsing a fake name, wig, and sporting a nose that needs to be securely fastened, Russ gets back on the field to prove himself as Chad Powers, even if the rest of the world doesn't know it's him. What could possibly go wrong?\n\nFor a star that's trying to break out in every possible avenue, it's great to see Powell stretch his comedic muscles that he's proven to do so naturally in the past. He's behind more than prosthetics on the project as well, given that he's co-writing the project and on board as an executive producer. Joining him on screen is Steve Zahn as football coach, Jake Hudson, who with his job on the line following a decline in the team's success, finds a literal blessing in disguise with Chad. The show also stars Perry Mattfeld, Toby Huss, Frankie A. Rodriguez, and Wynn Everett.\n\nChad Powers will make a play for Hulu on September 30, premiering the first two episodes. That will also be just over a month before Powell heads into theaters with Running Man, which is set to arrive on November 7.",

      "text": "Stephen King remake The Running Man gets star-studded first trailer, and the dystopian thriller looks like Squid Game meets John Wick\nTwisters star Glen Powell goes full John Wick in The Running Man trailer\nThe first trailer for Stephen King's The Running Man has arrived \u2013 and it looks like what you would get if you threw John Wick, Bullet Train, and Squid Game in a blender.\nIn the brief clip, which can be viewed below, we get our first look at Glen Powell as Ben Richards, an unemployed man short on cash and struggling to support his family in a \"medical crisis.\" With no other choice, Ben becomes a contestant in a twisted dystopian sci-fi show called The Running Man, in the hopes of winning a grand prize. \"It's the biggest show in the country,\" says Josh Brolin's character, but there's a catch.\nHost Bobby Thompson (Colman Domingo) then explains the rules: the contestants are allowed to run anywhere in the world while being chased by the general public, the latter of which is able to win a huge sum of money if they successfully kill each contestant. The rest of the trailer shows Powell's protagonist going full John Wick, willing to stop at nothing to win and be rid of the game, from jumping off a moving car to taking down a pilot in the midst of flying a plane.\nThe movie is based on King's dystopian sci-fi novel of the same name, first published in 1982 under King's Richard Bachman persona. A loose adaptation of the novel hit theaters in 1987, directed by Paul Michael Glaser and starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as Ben Richards. Wright's adaptation was first announced back in 2021, with Powell's casting announced in 2024.\nThe official synopsis reads, \"Desperate to save his sick daughter, working-class Ben Richards is convinced by the show\u2019s charming but ruthless producer, Dan Killian (Josh Brolin), to enter the game as a last resort. But Ben\u2019s defiance, instincts, and grit turn him into an unexpected fan favorite \u2013 and a threat to the entire system. As ratings skyrocket, so does the danger, and Ben must outwit not just the Hunters, but a nation addicted to watching him fall.\"\nThe cast includes Josh Brolin, Katy O'Brian, Daniel Ezra, Karl Glusman, Lee Pace, Jayme Lawson, Michael Cera, Emilia Jones, William H. Macy, David Zayas, and Sean Hayes. Edgar Wright directs from a screenplay he co-wrote with Michael Bacall.\nWright previously remarked that the 1987 movie didn't \"really follow the book,\" and that his version plans to be more of a faithful adaptation.\nThe Running Man is set to hit theaters on November 7, 2025.

The new season sees Rick Flag Sr. (played by Superman's Frank Grillo) seeking revenge for the death of his son, who, if you remember, was killed by Peacemaker in The Suicide Squad. Upon its return this summer, Peacemaker season 2 landed a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, with critics calling it a \"standout in superhero television\" and \"blood-spattering, bone-crunching fun\".\nPeacemaker season 2 episode 2 is available to stream on Max from August 28.

Unluckily for them, Korpi is actually a legendary Finnish Army commando, and he is ready to fight for what's his.

Now available to stream on Disney Plus, Thunderbolts* (and yes, that asterisk is important) brings together a squad of MCU bit-players led by Florence Pugh's Yelena Belova and Sebastian Stan's Bucky Barnes to save themselves and \u2013 more pressingly \u2013 the world. These are very consciously not the big Marvel characters, with most of them not even really being heroes at all. Still, they\u2019re the scrappy team the world needs right now.\nMore than most MCU movies, Thunderbolts* leans into its characters' neuroses. Everyone here is struggling \u2013 especially Lewis Pullman\u2019s mysterious Bob, who may prove to be key to the whole thing. By focusing in on this gang of misfits, the film reminds us just why we all fell in love with this universe in the first place.\nFind out what we made of the movie in our Thunderbolts* review.\nLooking for something else to watch?

      "text": "6 new movies and shows to watch this weekend on Netflix, Prime, Disney Plus, and more (August 8 - 10)\nOne of 2025's best horror movies and the return of Netflix's record-breaking Wednesday are among this week's best streaming titles\nOur list of the best new movies and shows to watch on streaming this weekend ranges from hilarious comedies to gore horrors, which means there is something for everyone here. Whether you are simply too seated for Wednesday season 2 or hoping to have a good time with Eddie Murphy's new comedy on Prime Video, this list offers everything you need to enjoy the latest releases on the best streaming services.\nBelow, we've selected 6 great movies and TV shows recently released on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, HBO Max, Apple TV Plus and Hulu, that should be on your watchlist right now. We've included one of the best horror movies of the year, The Monkey, as well as Fantastic Four star Pedro Pascal's small gem Freaky Tales. Because we're feeling even freakier, we're also recommending a nostalgic watch of 2003's Freaky Friday ahead of the release of its sequel, Freakier Friday, this week.\nSome exciting upcoming movies are landing in cinemas, but here we're focusing on everything you can watch at home right now, including the best shows and streaming films of 2025. Let's hope some of these titles are as incredible as some of this year's best streaming highlights, like Andor season 2 and Severance season 2.\nNew movies\nFreaky Tales (HBO Max)\nAvailable: US\nWatch now: HBO Max\nAfter wowing audiences at the Sundance Film Festival last year, Freaky Tales is finally releasing on streaming. With a star-studded cast featuring Fantastic Four star Pedro Pascal and Ironheart's Dominique Thorne, the film follows four interconnected stories set in 1987 Oakland California. It's bold, wild and funny, painting a picture of an era with lots of stylish images to spare.\nHelmed by Captain Marvel directors Ryan Fleck and Anna Boden, the story focuses on the stories of a retired sports gambling enforcer looking for revenge, a group of teen punks defending their turf against Nazi skinheads, a rap duo battling for hip-hop immortality, and an NBA All-Star settling the score. Ben Mendelsohn, Avatar: The Way of Water's Jack Champion, Top Gun: Maverick\u2019s Jay Ellis, and the late Angus Cloud complete the main cast.\nFreaky Tales is available to stream on Max from August 8. For more, check out our guides to the best HBO shows and the best HBO movies.\nThe Monkey (Hulu)\nAvailable: US\nWatch now: Hulu\nIf you missed The Monkey in cinemas, you'd better run this weekend to Hulu to watch it on streaming. It's one of the best horror movies of 2025, as well as one of the best Stephen King adaptations we've seen in a while. One of the bloodiest and funniest, too. Longlegs director Osgood Perkins rarely misses the mark.\nStarring Theo James and Tatiana Maslany, the story follows twin brothers Hal and Bill Shelburn as they battle for control of a lethal toy monkey. When the cursed object plays its drums, someone dies, and it's impossible to predict who. What follows is a plethora of inventively gruesome kills that horror fans will enjoy. As our 4-star The Monkey review said, this \"might be a horror, but it's a laugh riot too.\"\nThe Monkey is available to stream on Hulu from August 7. For more, read our The Monkey ending explained, and check out our list of the best Hulu shows to watch right now.\nThe Pickup (Prime Video)\nAvailable: US/UK\nWatch now: Prime Video\nPrime Video's latest action comedy might just be the perfect, lightest watch for this weekend. With Eddie Murphy, Eva Longoria, Pete Davidson and Keke Palmer leading the cast, you can be sure that The Pickup is packed with great comedic talent, which blends into the exciting action sequences.\nDirected by Tim Story, the film follows Russell and Travis, two drivers on a cash pickup job that doesn't go exactly as planned. The pair are ambushed by a gang of armed criminals, and they are asked to help them with carrying out a huge robbery. Russell and Travis must put aside their differences and work together if they want to survive.\nThe Pickup is available to stream on Amazon Prime from August 6. For more, check out our list of all the best movies on Prime Video right now.\nFreaky Friday (Disney Plus)\nAvailable: Worldwide\nWatch now: Disney Plus\nWith the long-awaited sequel Freakier Friday hitting cinemas this week, the best thing you can do is give Disney's teenage classic a (re)watch. You won't regret it \u2013 over twenty years later, Freaky Friday is still a hilarious and deliciously ridiculous body-swap film with unforgettable performances and some lovely messages about mother-daughter relationships that still resonates today.\nIn the original movie, we meet single mother Tess Coleman (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her teenage daughter Anna (Lindsay Lohan), who, after receiving cryptic fortunes at a Chinese restaurant, wake up the next day with their bodies swapped. Until they find a solution, they are forced to impersonate each other, with hysterical results.\nFreaky Friday is available to stream on Disney Plus. For more, see our list of the best TV shows on Disney Plus.\nNew TV shows\nWednesday season 2 (Netflix)\nAvailable: US\nWatch now: Netflix\nOne of Netflix's most popular shows is finally back, ready to break more viewership records, get pigtails back in fashion and launch a viral dance on TikTok. Wednesday Addams can do it all. The first few episodes of Wednesday season 2 are out now, with Jenna Ortega reprising the lead role alongside Catherine Zeta-Jones as Morticia Addams, Luis Guzm\u00e1n as Gomez Addams, Isaac Ordonez as Pugsley Addams, and Fred Armisen as Uncle Fester.\nAs we are welcomed back to Nevermore Academy, Wednesday will have to face some new challenges. As we saw in the first trailer, that includes a time-bomb mission to save Enid, Addams Family secrets, and the sour-faced hero reluctantly becoming a Nevermore celebrity.\nWednesday Season 2 Part 1 is available to stream on Netflix from August 6. For more, see our Wednesday season 2 release schedule, and check out the best Netflix shows to watch right now.\nPlatonic season 2 (Apple TV Plus)\nAvailable: Worldwide\nWatch now: Apple TV Plus\nWe can't think of a better way to spend our weekend than alongside Seth Rogen and Rose Byrne, two of the funniest people in Hollywood. If the first season of Platonic flew under your radar back in 2023, now is the perfect time to catch up, as season 2 premiered this week. And throw in Rogen's The Studio too if you haven't watched it already on Apple TV Plus \u2013 it might be the best comedy show this year.\nIn this second chapter of Platonic, created by Francesca Delbanco and Nicholas Stoller (Forgetting Sarah Marshall), we reunite with these two platonic friends, who are now facing very different midlife crises as Rogen's character has second thoughts about his upcoming wedding.\nPlatonic season 2 is available to stream on Apple TV Plus from August 6.
