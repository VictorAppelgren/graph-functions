  "content": "The national redistricting battle enters its next phase Thursday as California Democrats are scheduled to pass a new congressional map that creates five winnable seats for their party, a direct counter to the Texas House\u2019s approval of a new map to create more conservative-leaning seats in that state.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has engineered the high-risk strategy in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s own brinkmanship. Trump pushed Texas Republicans to reopen the legislative maps they passed in 2021 to squeeze out up to five new GOP seats to help the party stave off a midterm defeat.\n\nUnlike in Texas, where passage by the Republican-controlled state Senate and signature by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott are now all that\u2019s needed to make the maps official, California faces a more uncertain route. Democrats must use their legislative supermajority to pass the map by a two-third margin. Then they must schedule a special election in November for voters to approve the map that Newsom must sign by Friday to meet ballot deadlines.\n\nThe added complexity is because California has a voter-approved independent commission that Newsom himself backed before Trump\u2019s latest redistricting maneuver. Only the state\u2019s voters can override the map that commission approved in 2021. But Newsom said extraordinary steps are required to counter Texas and other Republican-led states that Trump is pushing to revise maps.\n\n\u201cThis is a new Democratic Party, this is a new day, this is new energy out there all across this country,\u201d Newsom said Wednesday on a call with reporters. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to fight fire with fire.\u201d\n\nTexas Democratic lawmakers, vastly outnumbered in that state\u2019s legislature, delayed approval of the new map by 15 days by fleeing Texas earlier this month in protest. They were assigned round-the-clock police monitoring upon their return to ensure they attended Wednesday\u2019s session.\n\nThat session ended with an 88-52 party-line vote approving the map after more than eight hours of debate. Democrats have also vowed to challenge the new Texas map in court and complained that Republicans made the political power move before passing legislation responding to deadly floods that swept the state last month.\n\nIn a sign of Democrats\u2019 stiffening redistricting resolve, former President Barack Obama on Tuesday night backed Newsom\u2019s bid to redraw the California map, saying it was a necessary step to stave off the GOP\u2019s Texas move.\n\n\u201cI think that approach is a smart, measured approach,\u201d Obama said during a fundraiser for the Democratic Party\u2019s main redistricting arm.\n\nThe incumbent president\u2019s party usually loses congressional seats in the midterm election, and the GOP currently controls the House of Representatives by a mere three votes.\n\nTrump is going beyond Texas in his push to remake the map. He\u2019s pushed Republican leaders in conservative states like Indiana and Missouri to also try to create new Republican seats. Ohio Republicans were already revising their map before Texas moved. Democrats, meanwhile, are mulling reopening Maryland\u2019s and New York\u2019s maps as well.\n\nHowever, more Democratic-run states have commission systems like California\u2019s or other redistricting limits than Republican ones do, leaving the GOP with a freer hand to swiftly redraw maps. New York, for example, can\u2019t draw new maps until 2028, and even then, only with voter approval.\n\nTexas Republicans openly said they were acting in their party\u2019s interest. State Rep. Todd Hunter, who wrote the legislation formally creating the new map, noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has allowed politicians to redraw districts for nakedly partisan purposes.\n\nThere was little that outnumbered Democrats could do other than fume and threaten a lawsuit to block the map. Because the Supreme Court has blessed purely partisan gerrymandering, the only way opponents can stop the new Texas map would be by arguing it violates the Voting Rights Act requirement to keep minority communities together so they can select representatives of their choice.\n\nHouse Republicans\u2019 frustration at the Democrats\u2019 flight and ability to delay the vote was palpable during the Wednesday vote.\n\nHouse Speaker Dustin Burrows announced as debate started that doors to the chamber were locked and any member leaving was required to have a permission slip. The doors were only unlocked after final passage more than eight hours later.\n\nRepublicans issued civil arrest warrants to bring the Democrats back after they left the state Aug. 3, and Abbott asked the state Supreme Court to oust several Democrats from office. The lawmakers also face a fine of $500 for every day they were absent.\n\nAssociated Press journalists John Hanna in Topeka, Kansas, and Sara Cline in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, contributed to this report.",
