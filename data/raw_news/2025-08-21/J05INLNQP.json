  "content": "Vice President J.D. Vance traveled to Georgia on Thursday to promote the tax cuts that President Trump has signed into law and that Republicans plan to use in the midterm elections next year to energize their troops in competitive races across the country.\n\nA month after casting the deciding vote on the president\u2019s signature economic \u201cBig Beautiful bill,\u201d Mr. Vance told supporters at a refrigeration manufacturing facility just south of Atlanta that the tax cuts are helping lift families.\n\n\u201cWe believe you ought to keep more of your hard-earned money, and we believe if you are busting your rear end every single day, the government ought to make it easier for you, not harder for you,\u201d Mr. Vance said.\n\n\u201cWe are cutting taxes for American taxpayers. We are securing the border,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we got a president who is standing with law enforcement to make it easier to clean up our streets, to make them safe for our young families.\u201d\n\nThe focus on Georgia comes as both parties begin to prepare for the midterm elections, where Sen. Jon Ossoff, widely considered the most vulnerable Democrat, is seeking a second term.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful\u201d law \u2014 which extended the 2017 tax cuts, increased funding for the military and border security, and curtails future Medicaid spending by establishing new eligibility requirements for beneficiaries \u2014 is an early dividing line in the Senate race.\n\nThe top contenders for the GOP nomination \u2014 Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins; along with former Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley, whose father, Vince, was a Hall of Fame football coach at the University of Georgia \u2014 praised the law.\n\nMr. Ossoff voted against Mr. Trump\u2019s signature bill, calling it a disaster and warning that it will leave hundreds of thousands of Georgians without health coverage and force rural hospitals to close their doors.\n\nBefore Mr. Vance\u2019s visit, Mr. Ossoff said the Trump administration is doing \u201cdamage control\u201d because of the blowback it has faced for \u201cdefunding hospitals and nursing homes to cut taxes for the wealthiest people in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cVance is being sent on this little errand to come and play defense in Georgia, defending a bill they can\u2019t defend, trying to sell the unsellable,\u201d Mr. Ossoff said Wednesday on MSNBC. \u201cLet me just say this about J.D. Vance: he was supposed to be this avatar for a new GOP that was for working-class people in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis legacy forever now is casting the decisive vote to throw millions of Americans off health care, throwing seniors out of their nursing home beds, all to serve the wealthiest and most powerful people in the country,\u201d Mr. Ossoff said. \u201cHe has zero credibility as a champion for America\u2019s working class, and the damage control he is trying to do in Georgia this week is going to fall flat.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Vance fired back, saying Mr. Ossoff\u2019s opposition to the Trump agenda has exposed him as a \u201cfar-left liberal\u201d and dismissed the idea that people will lose their health coverage.\n\n\u201cIt is not about kicking people off health care, it is about kicking illegal aliens the hell out of this country so we can preserve health care for the American families who need it,\u201d Mr. Vance said.\n\nMr. Vance said Mr. Trump made a \u201csacred promise\u201d to the American public that only \u201cillegal aliens\u201d would \u201close access to health care.\u201d\n\nThe battle over the new law is part of a broader fight over whether the Trump administration and the GOP-led Congress are helping or hurting the economy, which remains a top-of-mind issue for voters across the country who are concerned about inflation, wages and jobs.\n\nConsumer prices have been relatively stable despite doomsday predictions about Mr. Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs, which are a tax on imports. Wholesale prices have risen slightly, however, particularly for items like furniture, causing some economists to worry that the cost of levies will be passed along to consumers in the coming months.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index rose 2.7% in July on an annualized basis, the government reported. The number was relatively mild but above the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred target of 2%.\n\nA recent analysis from Pew Research found that 46% of Americans disapprove of the \u201cBig Beautiful\u201d law, while 32% approve. The remaining individuals are not sure.\n\nA YouGov tracking poll showed Americans are pessimistic about the economy, with half saying the economy is \u201cgetting worse,\u201d 27% saying it is \u201cgetting better,\u201d and 19% saying it is \u201cabout the same.\u201d\n\nDemographic changes in Georgia, particularly in the sprawling Atlanta suburbs, have altered the state\u2019s political landscape, transforming the once-reliable Republican state into a more competitive battleground.\n\nMr. Trump carried Georgia by slightly more than 2 percentage points over Vice President Kamala Harris last fall. Four years earlier, Democrat Joe Biden won the state by roughly 12,000 votes.\n\nMr. Ossoff and Sen. Raphael Warnock also emerged victorious in the 2020 election cycle, handing Democrats control of the U.S. Senate.",

Vance defends the law as protecting American families from illegal immigration, claiming it preserves health care for citizens, whereas Ossoff accuses the bill of favoring the wealthy and undermining seniors. The clash reflects a broader partisan divide over the law\u2019s economic impact, with mixed public approval and concerns about inflation. Georgia\u2019s shifting demographics have turned the state into a competitive battleground, making the debate crucial for the upcoming midterm elections. The debate underscores the GOP\u2019s strategy to use the tax cuts to energize voters in key races.",
