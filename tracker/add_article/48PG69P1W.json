      "title": "Trump claims ‘great progress’ in Putin meeting — but holds details close pending calls to Zelensky, European allies",
      "summary": "President Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin in Anchorage, Alaska, for a three‑hour discussion that he described as a “listening exercise” and claimed made “great progress” toward ending Russia’s war in Ukraine, though no concrete terms were disclosed.  Trump said he would call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and European allies to discuss any potential agreements, emphasizing that a deal would only come if all parties agreed.  Russian demands reportedly include recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk as Russian territory, a freeze of front lines, and Ukraine’s refusal to join NATO, while Ukraine insists on security guarantees and a final peace deal that protects its sovereignty.  The summit was seen by U.S. officials as a chance to gauge Putin’s willingness to negotiate, with no immediate outcomes expected and the meeting positioned as a precursor to a possible trilateral summit involving Zelensky.  Media coverage highlighted the lack of detail, the political stakes for Trump’s 2024 campaign, and the broader international debate over the feasibility of a cease‑fire under Moscow’s conditions.",
