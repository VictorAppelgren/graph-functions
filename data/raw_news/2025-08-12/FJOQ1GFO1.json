  "content": "ALBANY, N.Y. \u2014 A man who fired a shotgun outside an upstate New York synagogue with dozens of children inside shortly after the start of the Israel-Hamas war was sentenced in federal court Tuesday to 10 years in prison.\n\nMufid Alkhader, 29, was arrested in December 2023 after firing two shots in the air and shouting \u201cFree Palestine!\u201d outside Temple Israel of Albany. No one was injured, but the incident terrified many of the 61 children attending preschool and the adult staffers who had to shelter in place.\n\n\u201cMy daughter was in Hebrew class with her teacher, whose own child was on the other side of the building,\u201d Rachel Mandel told the court. \u201cHer amazing teacher held, hid and comforted my child. She prepared herself and the children in her care to die as victims of hate.\u201d\n\nThe shots were fired hours before the first night of Hanukkah and two months after the surprise incursion by Hamas triggered the war. Federal prosecutors say Alkhader, whose gun jammed after the second shot, complained about events in the Middle East after his arrest.\n\nUnder a deal with prosecutors, Alkhader in February pleaded guilty to obstructing the free exercise of religious beliefs by threat of force, brandishing a firearm during the commission of that offense and conspiring to purchase a firearm unlawfully.\n\nAlkhader, wearing an orange jail shirt, told the court Tuesday he felt terrible about what he did and for scaring people.\n\n\u201cI know I was not in my right mind,\u201d Alkhader said, asking for forgiveness.\n\nAlkhader\u2019s public defender had argued for a more lenient sentence, citing his client\u2019s severe mental illness.\n\nBut Judge Anne Nardacci sided with prosecutors, who said Alkhader should face 10 years in prison after traumatizing the children and adults in the synagogue.\n\nProsecutor Richard Belliss said Alkhader wanted to scare the people in the building, \u201cand scare them he did.\u201d\n\nAlkhader was born in a Palestinian refugee community near Baghdad and his family came to the U.S. as refugees in 2012, when he was 16. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen two years later and lived in nearby Schenectady at the time of the shooting.\n\nAnother man was sentenced last fall to 14 months in prison for making a \u201cstraw\u201d purchase of the shotgun for Alkhader.",
