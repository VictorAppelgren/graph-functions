  "title": "I spent 4 months testing pickleball paddles to find the best options for every skill level and play style",
  "description": "Gear can make or break your pickleball experience. Our tester hit the courts weekly for 4 months to find the best pickleball paddles for every type of player.",
  "content": "Pickleball has been touted as the fast-growing sport in the United States for the past few years, and it's not hard to see why. The rules of the game are easy to learn, and the smaller court size can make it less physically demanding and intimidating than tennis. Those truths, plus the obvious health and social benefits of physical activity, make pickleball a win for players of all levels. And no matter your skill level, the best pickleball paddles can help enhance your skills and improve your game.I recruited eight pickleball players of various levels to assist in testing paddles for a variety of criteria. All paddles tested are USAPA (USA Pickleball) approved. Selkirk's SLK HALO Pro XL tops our list as the best overall pickleball paddle for its balance of power and control at a mid-tier price point. If you're looking for something more wallet-friendly, the JoncAye Blitz is our best budget pick.Best overall: SLK HALO Pro XL - See at Dick's Sporting GoodsBest budget: JoncAye Blitz - See at AmazonBest for beginners: SLK Evo Power XL - See at AmazonBest for advanced players: Wilson Vesper - See at Amazon\n              With a great balance of power, control, and value, the SLK HALO Pro XL is the best pickleball paddle for most players.\n            SpecificsThe SLK HALO Pro XL is the goldilocks of paddles we tested. When considering performance features, durability, play experience, and price, this paddle is just right, making it the best pickleball paddle overall. SLK is a line by Selkirk \u2014 a leading pickleball gear company \u2014 that is focused on paddles that balance performance and value. At $150, the HALO Pro XL definitely delivers on that mission.It's a true hybrid paddle for both power and control. Many paddles on the market are specifically designed for either power players or control players. The HALO Pro XL complements both these play styles, making it a great all-court option for players of all skill levels and styles. With a thickness of 14 millimeters and a weight of somewhere between 7.7 and 8.2 ounces, it's widely considered a midweight, standard-thickness paddle. The paddle's balanced nature can be attributed to some standout features, like its surface, which is made of a patent-pending blend of carbon fiber and Kevlar. Together, these materials make a surface that is stiff, durable, textured, and generates a good amount of spin.The paddle is also thermoformed, which is the gold-standard method used to mold and make the best pickleball paddles. This process involves heating and molding the materials under pressure, resulting in a stiffer and more consistent paddle face. Practically speaking, thermoformed paddles have enhanced sweet spots and are more durable. Another feature you can't see but can feel is the FlexFoam perimeter, which dampens vibration and makes even a smash feel smooth.On the court, this was my favorite paddle of the bunch. I'd consider myself a solid middle-of-the-road player, and I loved the way this paddle felt and played. It was heavy enough that I felt stable and was consistently hitting well, but not so heavy that I was working overtime to get the ball over the net. The paddle supported my natural swing and allowed me to focus on my technique to better understand my strengths and weaknesses on the court.This is the kind of paddle that grows with you \u2014 sophisticated enough that it'll support an advanced play style, but forgiving enough to give novices confidence. If you come to learn you're all about power or finesse, you can graduate to something more specialized, but for beginners or versatile players who want a paddle that does everything well, this is it. And at a great price.\n              Whether you\u2019re a newcomer who wants to learn the ropes of pickleball or a more seasoned player who just doesn\u2019t want to spend a lot on gear or wants a solid backup set, the JoncAye Blitz paddles are a great option. \n            SpecificsThis is a very accessible paddle. Part of what makes pickleball so appealing to so many is the low barrier to entry \u2014 there's a smaller learning curve compared to most racquet sports. And the plethora of affordable, quality paddles out there makes the sport all the more accessible.You get two paddles for the price of one, plus extras to get you started. For $40, the JoncAye Blitz set comes with two USAPA-approved pickleball paddles, four balls, and a drawstring bag for traveling. Most \"budget\" paddles of the same quality run for $50 to $100 for just one paddle.At 8.125 inches, this is a wide paddle with a huge sweet spot. That, plus the smooth fiberglass surface (which doesn't offer much spin potential), makes these paddles more forgiving for beginners. The JoncAye Blitz paddles were the first paddles I ever bought, and they've held up surprisingly well over the course of two years. Other than some scratches on the surface and some grip wear and tear (which can be easily fixed with new grip tape), the paddles function just as they did when I bought them.A paddle like this doesn't offer many advanced features, but it does offer a solid set at an unbeatable value. Plus, with two paddles, you'll always have gear for a buddy to play with you.\n              Built to forgive mistakes while you learn, the SLK EVO Power XL grows with your skills and is the perfect paddle to take you from beginner to intermediate player\n            SpecificsWhile the name says \"power,\" the SLK EVO Power XL is really a hybrid. Control and power may be completely different play styles, but beginners need to develop these skills simultaneously \u2014 an understanding of how to generate speed and strength, as well as how to control where the ball ends up. Don't be intimidated by the name, the SLK EVO Power XL is the best pickleball paddle for beginners because it gives you the boost you need to build confidence on the court at a beginner-friendly price.The brand calls it a paddle for \"advancing players who crave power without sacrificing control.\" On a scale of 1-10, the brand rates this a 5.5 for power and 7.5 for control, suggesting this paddle actually is a bit better for control after all. That balanced feel, not leaning in too heavily to any play style, is great for those still getting a feel for the game.The paddle is lightweight, but has more pop than others in the same weight class. Thanks to more advanced features like the CarbonFusion carbon fiber surface, polymer core, and thermoformed construction, this paddle will be forgiving when you start playing but can grow with you as you learn how to put some spin on your returns, dink ever so softly, and lob with serious power. At $100, it's on the lower end of the price tier but still feels like an investment to keep you committed to getting out and playing a few times each week.\n              Wilson\u2019s cutting-edge technology and racquet sport legacy help serious players unleash more powerful, aggressive play.\n            Specifics\n              The control version of Wilson's Vesper delivers the control and precision advanced players need to play strategically. \n            SpecificsAlmost all of the most experienced pickleballers in the testing group agreed on one thing: the Wilson Vesper is the best paddle for advanced players. There are two models to choose from: the Wilson Vesper Power and the Wilson Vesper Control.When you're an advanced player, gear really matters. When you already have solid technique, the right equipment can help you make marginal gains that build on your already existing skills and improve performance. The Vesper Power and Vesper Control are very similar, but each paddle features slightly different details to amplify your power or control game.At 17 millimeters, the Wilson Vesper Control is the thickest option on this list. That thickness, paired with the gritty raw carbon fiber face, dampens the power from your opponents' shots and helps you respond with delicate precision. The widebody shape makes for a larger sweet spot, but at 16 inches long, including a 5-inch-long handle, this paddle feels smaller than others on this list. One advanced tester said that while she felt really in control of the ball while using this paddle, getting used to the size was an adjustment. Because this paddle leans wider than longer, it lacks reach, which can make it difficult to get wide shots.The Wilson Vesper Power is an elongated paddle, which gives it a smaller sweet spot. With the extended handle, you can reach for further shots, and with room for both hands on the handle, you can put your whole body behind the shot and really unleash your power. The FreeFlex open throat design, like a tennis racquet, helps increase swing speed.The brand calls both of these paddles \"barely legal.\" That may sound like a bad thing at first, but it's actually a great way to market these paddles. In order to be approved for tournament use, a pickleball paddle has to meet USAPA standards, which are designed to ensure paddles are safe for use and don't give players an unfair advantage on the court. Wilson's claim that the Vesper paddles are barely legal really just means that these paddles are as advanced as possible, pushing the limit on what a paddle can be while still adhering to USAPA standards. At $249 each, these are the most expensive paddles on the list. But, if you're ready to uplevel, they really do deliver a premium experience, and then some.To help me understand the basics of paddle construction and how small details can affect your performance on the court, I consulted Jack Waite, director of racquet sports at Burning Tree Country Club and Professional Pickleball Registry coach developer, for some assistance.Paddles come in a range of weights, with most in the midweight range between 7.9 and 8.2 ounces.Midweight paddles are the most balanced option, offering a blend of control, maneuverability, and power. Most players will do well with a midweight paddle.Lightweight paddles (7.8 ounces or less) are easy to maneuver and swing. If you're a net player who reacts quickly to get volleys and blocks, a lightweight paddle is a good option that can enhance your play style. Lightweight paddles are also great for beginners who need accuracy and control, and those with a history of arm injury. For some players, particularly bigger and stronger folks, lightweight paddles may feel a bit flimsy \u2014 you might find yourself overexerting your energy to compensate for the lack of power.Heavyweight paddles (8.3 ounces and up) are often the choice for power players. Because they are heavier, these paddles generate more power with less effort. The added weight also often feels more stable, but if it's too heavy for you, it can slow your reaction time. If you're still learning proper pickleball technique, this probably isn't the right paddle weight. The exception is those who are naturally very strong, as this paddle weight might feel natural.Surface material is about way more than aesthetics; it has a serious impact on the way the ball interacts with your paddle.Fiberglass is one of the most common materials on the market. It's economical and has a smooth texture that creates less friction when the ball meets the paddle, enhancing both pop and power.Carbon fiber is a more premium material; it's essentially thousands of carbon fibers woven together like a piece of fabric. The weave is lightweight but very strong and naturally textured for exceptional spin, friction, and superior control.Many paddles, like the SLK HALO Pro XL, use hybrid surfaces that blend carbon fiber with durable Kevlar (a fiber that is five times stronger than steel) to enhance finesse.Sandwiched between the paddle faces sits the core \u2014 the innermost section of the pickleball paddle and arguably one of its most crucial components. While you can't see it, the core composition greatly impacts the way a paddle performs, especially in terms of power, control, and durability.Polymer/polypropylene is one of the most commonly used materials for paddle cores \u2014 every one of our picks features a poly core. The balance of power and control, shock prevention, and quieter sound all contribute to the material's widespread use. Nomex is another frequently used core material. Its stiff and rigid construction makes it a powerhouse in delivering maximum power shots. Plus, it's extremely durable and resistant to damage.There are two factors to consider when it comes to grip size: circumference and length.Circumference: The differences between grip circumferences are minuscule but really do matter. Waite said the standard grip size is 4.25 inches, while 4 inches is considered thin and 4.5 inches is considered thick. Smaller grips allow for quicker paddle maneuverability. You can always make a grip thicker with overgrips for added bulk.Length: Long handles (often denoted as \"XL\") are great for players who want extra reach or prefer two-handed backhands. Short handles (often called \"Max\" paddles), on the other hand, tend to maximize paddle face area, which means a larger sweet spot and a more forgiving paddle. \"The longer the grip, the smaller your paddle face area, so keep that in mind,\" Waite said.For four months, I took 12 paddles out weekly and tested them on private courts with players at a variety of skill and experience levels. I'm certainly not an expert player. I tend to feel most at home playing at the baseline, hitting groundstrokes. I made sure to include testers who excel at gnarly power shots and precision placement, so we could fairly assess how different paddles fared for different play styles.Paddles were tested for full games and rotated between players before new games. These were usually doubles, so we were often able to test four paddles at a time. I aggregated verbal and written feedback from players after every pickleball session, considering their skill level and play style. Testing sessions could run anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours, depending on factors like weather and endurance.Whether to buy an expensive paddle depends on more than just your skill level, but also your play frequency and goals. If you're a beginner and play infrequently, there's no reason to splurge on an expensive paddle. If you're looking to play regularly but are not yet a highly skilled player, Waite suggests going for a paddle in the $150 to $200 range. \"The materials tend to be higher quality, and in this range you can find lots of paddles with bigger sweet spots, power, and control than the lower price points,\" he said.The sweet spot on a pickleball paddle is located near the center. It's essentially the zone where your paddle and ball find perfect harmony on contact. \"When you hit it, you will feel like you have a combination of power and control with less effort,\" Waite said. When the ball hits outside the sweet spot, you might feel an uncomfortable vibration through the paddle or even feel like the ball is dead.Larger sweet spots are more forgiving, making them a good choice for beginners looking to elevate their game. But even with a larger sweet spot, improving shot consistency is a big feat. As Waite said, \"consistently hitting the sweet spot is something that separates the pros from the rest of us.\"",

  "summary": "The USAPA (USA Pickleball) approved pickleball paddles have been tested for 4 months to find the best options for every skill level and play style. The best overall pickledball paddle was chosen by Selkirk's SLK HALO Pro XL for its balance of power and control at a mid-tier price point, while JoncAye Blitz is our best budget pick.

      "text": "Business Insider's history traces back to 2007 when it was a tech and business blog called Silicon Alley Insider. It has since grown into a major site for news and lifestyle stories. In 2015, the company launched Insider Picks, the precursor to what is now the Reviews team, to help shoppers navigate the complex retail industry and make the best purchasing decisions.\nToday, the Reviews team is part of Business Insider's Service Journalism department and is helmed by a group of experienced commerce journalists who test and write about consumer products in a variety of categories, including home and kitchen, tech and electronics, pets, health and fitness, style, and beauty. Our in-depth research and testing are what help inform our recommendations to readers.\nWhat types of products we test\nBelow is a sampling of some of the core products and services the Reviews team tests. All products undergo a rigorous research or testing process and, when applicable, long-term testing.\nHome and kitchen: Cookware, small appliances, furniture, home decor, mattresses, bedding, DIY and gardening tools, smart home, and home office. The team also tests foods and drinks, delivery services, and many other home and kitchen-related products.\nPets: Cat and dog food, harnesses, litter boxes, collars, apparel, flea medication for dogs and cats, and many other pet accessories and services. Reporters enlist their cats, dogs, and other pets to help test products, while pet health articles are medically reviewed by veterinarians and supported by expert interviews.\nTech: Smartphones, desktop and laptop computers, smartwatches and wearables, TVs, stereo systems, headphones, home entertainment/streaming, and gaming.\nStyle and beauty: Apparel and shoes for all genders, bags, jewelry, underwear, bras, skincare, cosmetics, and other fashion-related topics. The team also puts health-related personal care products through a medical review to ensure they are safe to use.\nHealth and fitness: Workout clothes for women and men, thermometers, bikes, tents, outdoor gear, fitness equipment, health supplements, oral care, and more. Insider Reviews' health articles are medically reviewed by doctors and other health professionals, and supported by expert interviews.\nTravel: Travel gear, backpacks, commuter bags, luggage, travel tech accessories, and travel-related tips and tricks.\nEntertainment: Streaming platforms, how-to-watch major sporting or streaming events, concert and sporting tickets, and VPN services.\nHow we test products\nThe Reviews team tests products the way people would use them in everyday life. Instead of a lab environment, we use products in the real world. That means we're cooking with kitchen tools and appliances in our own kitchens, installing smart devices in our homes, wearing and washing clothing the way we would in our daily lives, and more. This helps us share real-life insights with our readers about how products integrate into our everyday environments.\nTo conduct our tests, we create a methodology for each product category, which is based on research, consultation with experts in the area, and experience from editors and reporters. All tests are tracked and the results are used to determine which products are worth recommending to readers. Our testing process is explained in greater detail within our buying guides, including information on why some products pass the grade and others don't.\nIn addition to our in-house and freelance testers, we also have an internal council of volunteers and freelancers who help us test products and offer additional perspectives. We occasionally make recommendations based on research and expert feedback \u2014 for example, asking professional makeup artists what products they recommend for certain skin types.\nWhy you can trust us\nThe Reviews team includes a roster of full-time, topic-based editors and reporters, plus several experienced freelance writers with strong backgrounds and expertise in their areas of coverage. Each of our editors and reporters has years of experience testing products and translating the results of those tests into recommendations for readers. Our team is organized based on our core coverage areas mentioned above, with each section focusing on reviewing the products, services, and industries they know best.\nIn addition to individual product review stories, we also maintain a vast collection of buying guides. These guides, which are tied to our reviews, recommend the best products for what readers are searching for (for example, the best espresso machines). We thoroughly test or research every product we recommend in both reviews and guides. We often apply additional scrutiny by consulting a panel of experts to ensure our information is accurate and offer buying advice. And for topics like health, parenting, and pets, we have a third-party medical review board that fact-checks our reviews and buying guides.\nIn all our articles, the reader always comes first. The Reviews team aims to answer every question that readers may have while helping you discover new products and services.\nHow our affiliate links work\nBusiness Insider earns commissions when products and services are purchased through links in our stories. However, our editorial team has complete independence to write about the products and services we truly deem the best based on our extensive testing and research. We do not make decisions based on affiliate relationships, and we would never write about a product that we didn't fully stand behind as product journalists.\nMeet our senior team leaders\n| Sally Kaplan, Executive EditorSally joined Insider in 2018 as an editor and has since held the role of senior editor and deputy editor on the Reviews team. She has interviewed CEOs and brand founders, reported on the rebirth of a fashion startup that narrowly escaped bankruptcy, developed testing methodologies for hundreds of stories, and edited countless others.

      "text": "- You've probably seen these trendy sneakers before on social media, and if you didn't know already, they're from Koio.\n- Koio makes luxury sneakers in the same factories as high-end brands like Chanel and Hermes, but for a fraction of what those designers pairs go for. Koio's shoes range from $180 to $370.\n- We spoke to Johannes Quodt and Chris Wichert \u2014 Koio's founders and Co-CEOs \u2014 to learn more about what sets the brand apart.\n- After trying the shoes for ourselves, we thought that while pricey, they were super comfortable, high quality, stylish, and easy to clean, making them worth it if you have the room in your budget.\nI'm a sucker for sneakers. I'd take high-tops over high heels just about any day, because when it comes to footwear, there's nothing more reliable than your favorite kicks. Like a little black dress, a durable pair of jeans, or a simple white T-shirt, a great pair of sneakers is a wardrobe essential you can always count on for comfort and style. Gone are the days when sneakers were reserved for gym class, commuting, and athletic endeavors \u2014 today you're just as likely to find sneakers on runways as you are at the gym.\nLuxury sneakers are all the rage, and Koio is one of the brands leading the charge. For Johannes Quodt and Chris Wichert \u2014 Koio's founders and Co-CEOs \u2014 a shared passion for sneakers brought them together. The duo grew up in Germany and both had an infatuation with high-end sneakers, spending \"much of our young adult lives saving up to purchase luxury sneakers when they went on sale,\" they told Business Insider. Still, there was something about the old-school luxury labels that never really felt like them \u2014 sneakers at luxury prices seemed more like precious objects that should be stored in the closet than actually worn everyday. When the two met at Wharton Business School, they realized this passion had potential to become a real business.\nCapitalizing on social and fashion trends\nQuodt and Wichert recognized that there was a shift in the fashion world \u2014 brands were moving towards more comfortable and casual styles. Consumers, similar to themselves, were looking (and continue to look) for shoes that could transition from day to night, from professional life to social life \u2014 and to this need, the duo had the perfect answer: sneakers.\nBusinessperson, student, and millennial are just some of the titles the pair respectively found themselves taking on at the time, and thus, they wanted to create a shoe that could reflect that. \"We both lived extremely busy lives that required us to seamlessly walk between different worlds and into a variety of different situations every day,\" the pair told Business Insider, \"so we wanted to create the highest quality, most versatile sneakers that would allow us to do just that.\"\nThe pair bought a one-way ticket to Italy when they were ready to make their first prototype \u2014 they were prepared to spend as much time as needed to find the perfect partners \u2014 leather suppliers, shoe manufacturers, and classic lastmakers. After three weeks, they ended up finding a manufacturer that was already producing products for luxury brands like Chanel, Hermes, and Saint Laurent, among others. Given their high-end company, you'd probably expect Koio shoes to go for upwards of $500. While they're not cheap, Koio shoes instead range from about $180 to $300 \u2014 unless you count the extremely adorable Baby Koios, which retail for $78.\nWith their business school backgrounds, Wichert and Quodt weren't too focused on following the traditional fashion industry path. Instead, they focused on maintaining a direct-to-consumer approach, which not only helps keep prices low, but also helps retailers engage with consumers. \"From the beginning, we focused on leveraging Instagram as a main medium to communicate our aesthetic.\" If you've seen their page \u2014 which you probably have \u2014 you'd know that they're doing a great job. It's an aesthetically pleasing feed full of minimalist photos, with close-ups of high-quality, pebbled leather, soft suede, and the simple, stamped logo \u2014 it's just enough to let you know these are great products, but it leaves plenty of us curious enough to engage further.\nWhether it's their simple, minimalist styles or their more bold options, people are loving Koio's take on high-end sneakers. In 2018 they grew revenue by 150%.\nComfort and style\nEven as someone who counts sneakers as her favorite type of shoe, $250 seemed pretty steep, especially when you consider how many budget-friendly options are on the market. Objectively, they're still a good chunk of money and may not be worth it for you if you just want a basic pair of sneakers \u2014 you could probably be happy with a cheaper pair. But, if you've been eyeing their Instagram ads for a while now, or are willing to shell out a little extra on your sneakers, I think Koio is worth it.\nAfter wearing these shoes for over a year now, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another pair. Here's why:\nIf you're purely in it for style, Koio is a great choice. The brand works with seasoned designers who have experience working for high-fashion names like Balenciaga and Gucci \u2014 so expect looks that are just as trendy as they are timeless. If you're looking for a pair that is not just fashionable, but functional, Koio is still a winner. From my experience, they're really comfortable, made with high-quality leather that lasts, and they're easy to clean \u2014 making them easy to wear for just about any occasion.\nThe Capri Bianco ($248) is now my go-to, everyday white sneaker. The leather is supple, making them really easy to break in. The all-white look is modern and matches everything, while the gray suede accent makes these stand out just a little. I was nervous that white leather would be a nightmare to clean, but a damp cloth was enough to wash away any visible wear and tear.\nThen there is the Avalanche Nude ($298), Koio's take on the clunky \"dad sneakers\" trend.\nOn a vacation last winter, I was dealing with some serious ankle pain. I didn't want to wear my Asics running sneakers, because frankly, while they're super comfortable, they didn't match any of my outfits, but my ankle boots did not have enough support to get me through long days of exploring a new city. Luckily, I realized I had packed my Koio Avalanche sneakers. The all-nude colorway is simple, but the mix of leather and suede make for a more bold style. The chunky sole and monochromatic look makes this a very trendy pair \u2014 they looked great with everything I put on, and I was happy to not be wearing my athletic, colorful trainers \u2014 but, most importantly, these kept my feet really comfortable and provided more than enough support. The perfect combination of comfort and style make these a pair that I will keep coming back to.\nOne-year update: Now, over 12 months later, both of these pairs really are ones I keep coming back to. Suede and leather are both pretty susceptible to stains and damage \u2014 and New York City streets are not so forgiving \u2014 but I've been impressed with how both of these sneakers have held up over time. Still, I think if you're going to invest in a nice pair of shoes, it's worth it to put in a little effort to keep them in prime condition. I plan on bringing these to get cleaned and then spraying them with a leather protector to keep them looking clean.\nBottom Line\nAfter hearing from Wichert and Quodt, I was left thinking about sneakers in a new light. They compared sneakers to denim, saying \"It's a trend that certainly isn't going away or slowing down, as we can't see a world where people revert back to wearing dress shoes in casual settings once they've started wearing sneakers.\" After wearing their shoes to work, on a plane, and to dinner with friends, it's not hard to believe that these will probably become as much a part of my daily uniform as my favorite pair of jeans.\nIf you have the budget to spare, or think they're a worthy investment, maybe a pair of Koio shoes will make it into your everyday rotation, too.\nShop Koio sneakers starting at $178 here.\nYou can purchase logo and accolade licensing to this story here.\nDisclosure: Written and researched by the Insider Reviews team.
