  "content": "During Thursday\u2019s appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon,\u201d Margaret Qualley revealed she\u2019s hoping to hook her famous mom, Andie MacDowell, up with Bill Murray, after meeting him backstage moments earlier.\n\n\u201cBill Murray, literally tonight, he pops into my backstage dressing room,\u201d the \u201cSubstance\u201d starlet, 30, began. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing a Piggly Wiggly shirt. And I grew up in North Carolina, and Piggly Wiggly\u2019s a Southern thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Oh, yeah, Piggly Wiggly!\u2019 Then, cut to, I found out he\u2019s living in Charleston. My mom\u2019s living in Charleston,\u201d Qualley continued.\n\nDespite living in the same city and starring together in the classic 1993 movie \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d Murray, 74, had some bad news about his relationship with her mother.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna give you the tea,\u201d the \u201cPoor Things\u201d actress shared. \u201cHe was like, \u2018You know, your mom and I \u2014 we didn\u2019t get along so good while we were making that movie.'\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was like, \u2018She took a lot of time to get her hair done, and she didn\u2019t know her lines this one time,'\u201d Qualley added. \u201cI was like, \u2018Yeah, well, I heard a different story, sir.\u2019\u201d\n\nHowever, Qualley would not be deterred from setting her mom up with the \u201cGhostbusters\u201d star.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m putting two and two together. He\u2019s living in Charleston. She\u2019s living in Charleston. They\u2019ve got this kind of rage towards each other, but maybe he\u2019s trying to make amends,\u201d she explained. \u201cAnd I\u2019m like, \u2018She\u2019s single, he\u2019s single. They\u2019re both crazy. Let\u2019s get it together!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI said to come circle back and get my number if he wants to connect with my mom. And, you know, if he\u2019s got any sense at all, he\u2019d be the luckiest guy in the world!\u201d Qualley added.\n\nMacDowell and the \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!\u201d star\u2019s father, Paul Qualley, divorced in 1999 after 13 years of marriage. Besides Margaret, the former couple shares son Justin Qualley and daughter Rainey Qualley.\n\nThe \u201cReady or Not\u201d actress opened up about her kids and her decision to ditch Los Angeles for Charleston during an appearance on \u201cThe Drew Barrymore Show\u201d earlier this year.\n\nMacDowell revealed that she made the movie to fill the \u201chuge void\u201d in her life that came from becoming an empty nester.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happier now than I have been in a long time,\u201d she said in January. \u201cMargaret really was kind of telling me I was supposed to be having the time of my life, but I wasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut now I am,\u201d the \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral\u201d star added. \u201cI\u2019m having the time of my life now. It\u2019s really good.\u201d\n\nAs for Qualley, she also discussed her former model-turned-movie star mom earlier this month during the new cover story for Cosmopolitan\u2019s Fall 2025 issue.\n\nMore than 40 years before the \u201cKinds of Kindness\u201d star posed for the magazine\u2019s latest issue, MacDowell did the same for the outlet\u2019s September 1982 cover.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s iconic\u2014she looks amazing,\u201d Qualley said of her mom\u2019s shoot.",

She does not seem like she\u2019s ok,\u201d one person reacted on X. \u201cLmaooo Willow Smith funny asf bc are you ok?!?!?\u201d another worried fan stated.\nSome attacked Will and Jada\u2019s parenting and questioned the Smith family as a whole.\n\u201cWill Smith and Jada have utterly failed as parents,\u201d someone wrote. \u201cWhy tf this family always crying,\u201d asked a second. \u201cTheir family is so weird ngl,\u201d shared a third.\nOthers immediately thought Willow was trolling her followers.\n\u201cCan we stop taking the Smith kids so seriously? They obviously like to troll,\u201d someone else commented.\nHours later, the singer addressed the concern on her Instagram Story.\nCalling her worried followers \u201cdense,\u201d Willow told her fans, \u201cy\u2019all forgot funny existed!\u201d\nShe further insulted them by comparing those who expressed worry to \u201cmolasses \u2026 slow but also sweet though.\u201d\nWillow then clarified her crying selfie, saying the post and caption were funny. Still, some argued that her disturbing mannerisms in the follow-up message didn\u2019t settle anyone\u2019s troubles.\n\u201cWillow smith on them pills,\u201d a follower claimed. \u201cOh lawd Willow Smith is crashing out \ud83e\udd74,\u201d responded another.\nThe Post reached out to Willow\u2019s rep for comment.\nIn 2021, the \u201cWhip My Hair\u201d singer revealed that she identified as \u201cpolyamorous\u201d on an episode of \u201cRed Table Talk.\u201d\nPolyamory is defined as engaging in multiple romantic relationships with the consent of all partners involved, per Psychology Today.\n\u201cWith polyamory,\u201d Willow explained to her mother and grandma, Adrienne \u201cGammy\u201d Banfield-Norris. \u201cI feel like the main foundation is the freedom to be able to create a relationship style that works for you and not just [to be] stepping into monogamy because that\u2019s what everyone around you says is the right thing to do.\n\u201cSo I was like, how can I structure the way that I approach relationships with that in mind? Also, doing research into polyamory, the main [reason] \u2026 why divorces happen is infidelity,\u201d she added.\nHer famous parents married in 1997; however, in 2016, Jada dropped a bomb when she admitted she and Will had been living separate lives for at least seven years.\nDespite their different paths, a slapping scandal and an \u201centanglement\u201d with a different partner, the actress vowed they would never get divorced.\n\u201cI made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce \u2013 we will work through whatever and I just haven\u2019t been able to break that promise,\u201d Jada said in the 2023 interview. \u201cWe live separately.\u201d"

      "text": "Rapper Sean Kingston gets 3.5 year prison sentence for $1 million fraud scheme\nRapper Sean Kingston was sentenced on Friday to three and a half years in prison after being convicted of a $1 million fraud scheme in South Florida.\nKingston, whose legal name is Kisean Paul Anderson, and his mother, Janice Eleanor Turner, were each convicted by a federal jury in March of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and four counts of wire fraud. U.S. Judge David Leibowitz sentenced Turner last month to five years in prison.\nThe same judge sentenced Kingston, who was immediately taken into custody. Leibowitz also ordered that a restitution hearing should be held within 90 days. Kingston\u2019s sentence is to be followed by three years of supervised release.\nKingston, 35, and his mother were arrested in May 2024 after a SWAT team raided Kingston\u2019s rented mansion in suburban Fort Lauderdale. Turner was taken into custody during the raid, while Kingston was arrested at Fort Irwin, an Army training base in California\u2019s Mojave Desert, where he was performing.\nAccording to court records, Kingston used social media from April 2023 to March 2024 to arrange purchases of high-end merchandise. After negotiating deals, Kingston would invite the sellers to one of his high-end Florida homes and promise to feature them and their products on social media.\nInvestigators said that when it came time to pay, Kingston or his mother would text the victims fake wire receipts for the luxury merchandise, which included a bulletproof Escalade, watches and a 19-foot (5.9-meter) LED TV, investigators said.\nWhen the funds never cleared, victims often contacted Kingston and Turner repeatedly, but were either never paid or received money only after filing lawsuits or contacting law enforcement.\nKingston, who was born in Florida and raised in Jamaica, shot to fame at age 17 with the 2007 hit \u201cBeautiful Girls,\u201d which laid his lyrics over Ben E. King\u2019s 1961 song \u201cStand By Me.\u201d His other hits include 2007\u2019s \u201cTake You There\u201d and 2009\u2019s \u201cFire Burning.\u201d"

      "text": "Margaret Qualley bares all in NYC as she reveals why she \u2018felt really lonely\u2019 before Jack Antonoff\nMargaret Qualley is shedding more than just her clothes.\nIn a new cover story for Cosmopolitan\u2019s Fall 2025 issue, published Monday, the \u201cPoor Things\u201d starlet opened up about her husband, Jack Antonoff, and how she felt before they met.\n\u201cIn every other relationship I\u2019ve ever been in, I still felt really lonely because I wasn\u2019t with my person, and it\u2019s like I was seeking something,\u201d Qualley, 30, began. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like that anymore. Jack makes me feel safe and comfortable.\u201d\n\u201cI spent so many years trying to be someone\u2019s perfect girl, and that girl changed over and over again,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut I can\u2019t lie to Jack. I can\u2019t be that for him \u2013 he\u2019d see through it. So I just have to be myself. He\u2019s been the person I\u2019ve pictured my whole life. And I\u2019m not even saying that metaphorically.\u201d\nThe \u201cSubstance\u201d actress also revealed how she and the Bleachers frontman, who married in 2023, first connected.\n\u201cFalling in love with Jack was the biggest feeling I\u2019ve ever felt. We met right as COVID was ending, at the first party I\u2019d been to,\u201d Qualley shared.\n\u201cWe saw each other on a roof, and we just started talking and never stopped,\u201d she added. \u201cWe went on a series of walks throughout the city that summer.\u201d\nAlthough the \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!\u201d actress admitted that she \u201cfell in love\u201d with Antonoff, 41, shortly after they first met, she claimed that he was the one to say \u201cI love you\u201d first.\n\u201cHe did, obviously,\u201d Qualley began. \u201cI\u2019m very old-school about stuff like this. I would never put myself out there first.\u201d\n\u201cI never text twice. I mean, now we\u2019re married and I can text him anything at any time. We\u2019re always having a conversation; he\u2019s like my human diary,\u201d she added. \u201cBut before we were together, at the beginning, I would always follow Southern girl etiquette.\u201d\nThe \u201cHappy Gilmore 2\u201d actress admitted it didn\u2019t hurt that Antonoff looks a lot like her first-ever Hollywood crush.\n\u201cMy first crush was Adam Sandler in \u2018Happy Gilmore\u2019 and \u2018Big Daddy,\u2019 and I\u2019ve been looking for that essence my whole life,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s Jack.\u2019\u201d\nAs for her idea of \u201chealthy love,\u201d Qualley said that it is \u201clike there\u2019s always a ground below you\u201d and that she makes a point to perform in projects that feature her concept of \u201chealthy love.\u201d\n\u201cYou can\u2019t fall very far because you\u2019re going to be caught,\u201d the \u201cOnce Upon a Time\u2026 in Hollywood\u201d actress said.\n\u201cBut love is also hard. It\u2019s why I feel inspired to make movies about love, whether it\u2019s platonic or romantic or whatever,\u201d she continued. \u201cThe kind of thing I would be proud to show my kids one day.\u201d\nElsewhere during her interview with Cosmopolitan, Qualley opened up about her former model-turned-actress mother, Andie MacDowell.\nMore than 40 years before Qualley posed for photos around New York for the magazine\u2019s latest issue, MacDowell, 67, did the same for the outlet\u2019s September 1982 cover.\n\u201cIt\u2019s iconic\u2014she looks amazing,\u201d Qualley said of her mom\u2019s shoot.\nWhile her mother starred in movies like \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d and \u201cFour Weddings and a Funeral,\u201d and her father, Paul J. Qualley, 67, was also a model, Qualley started her career all on her own when she left home for the big city while still just a teenager.\n\u201cI moved to New York City at 16, when I got into a summer program at the American Ballet Theatre,\u201d the \u201cMy Salinger Year\u201d star recalled. \u201cAlthough I didn\u2019t watch Dance Moms, that was very much the world I grew up in.\u201d\n\u201cBut I realized I was just not good enough to be a dancer, and I\u2019ll never be perfect at it,\u201d she admitted. \u201cAnd if I\u2019m not going to be the best, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth pursuing.\u201d\nIt was then that Qualley began modeling.\n\u201cI got a modeling job and was able to pay my rent,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018I could just stay here.\u2019 I sent my mom a long email: \u2018Found a school. Got a job. What do you think?\u2019\u201d\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t always easy for Qualley, who didn\u2019t make her acting debut until the 2013 film \u201cPalo Alto\u201d or gain real recognition until the HBO drama series \u201cThe Leftovers\u201d one year later.\n\u201cI was 16 years old, alone in the city. It felt terrifying,\u201d she shared. \u201cOther kids were going home to their parents and their tutors, and I was at Paris Fashion Week with a chemistry or algebra textbook for a class that I was failing.\u201d\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have any friends. I didn\u2019t know anyone in the city,\u201d Qualley continued. \u201cIf a guy got on the elevator, I would get off.\u201d\n\u201cI lived all of my 20s out of a suitcase, without any furniture. I had a mattress on the floor,\u201d she concluded. \u201cAnd I became financially independent by the time I was 18, so I was super frugal, too.\u201d"

I thought I was gonna have to have hip replacement. Thank God my hips are fine,\u201d the star stated.\nMacDowell said she works with a personal trainer to tame the pain, adding that her previous exercise of choice might not have been helping her issue.\n\u201cI have to work my tiny little bottom and my hips. I have to work the bottom and work my hip. I just do it every day,\u201d the \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d actress shared.\nMacDowell admitted that she loves to work out, but her Peloton habit wasn\u2019t doing her any favors.\n\u201cI like to eat, but I do love to work out. That is my great fortune because I have had friends that are frustrated because they don\u2019t enjoy it, but I really do enjoy it,\u201d she explained.\n\u201cBut most recently, what happened when I was working last season as I did the Peloton like a crazy person and it\u2019s not appropriate for my body, and I ended up with bad knees and a bad hip, and I didn\u2019t realize what was, I thought I was literally falling apart like I was gonna have to get new pieces,\u201d she joked.\nLuckily, \u201cmy pieces are fine,\u201d MacDowell told Barrymore. \u201cMy knees are good except for like aging. They\u2019ve aged. I\u2019m working out really hard now doing PT I\u2019m not falling apart. Well, thank God.\u201d\nMacDowell also shared that she ditched Los Angeles and is living the quiet life over 2,000 miles away from Tinseltown.\n\u201cI moved down to South Carolina and I live with a, in a community that has a lot of people my age, so it makes it really easy to socialize,\u201d she said.\nThe \u201cSt Elmo\u2019s Fire\u201d actress also dished on her family life, revealing she\u2019ll be a grandma again as her son, Justin Qualley, 38, is expecting a child soon.\nMacDowell has three kids from her first marriage to Paul J. Qualley, including Justin and daughters, Rainey Qualley, 35, and actress Margaret Qualley, 30, who was shockingly snubbed from the Oscars nominations list for her role in \u201cThe Substance.\u201d\nWhile MacDowell didn\u2019t address her daughter\u2019s snub, she did talk about being an empty nester.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to work really hard on my independence, Margaret basically told me I needed to get a life. She was right,\u201d she said.\n\u201cShe\u2019s so grown up because, you know, they did used to follow me to the bathroom. Yes, they follow you to the bathroom and then we would take, I would take baths, and they wanted to be right there with me. So they would put their feet in the bathtub and we would sit and talk,\u201d MacDowell explained to Barrymore\u2019s audience.\n\u201cThose days are gone. I am dying for my adult girls to come into the bathroom with me. Let me get in the bathtub and sit there with their feet in the water. I would love that, but they, you know, they don\u2019t want to do that. And she has a husband. She has a husband. What an inconvenience,\u201d she joked.\nAfter divorcing her children\u2019s father in 1999 after 13 years of marriage, MacDowell married her second husband, Rhett Hartzog, in 2001.\nThey ended their marriage in 2004 after nearly three years together."

I\u2019m having the time of my life now. It\u2019s really good.\u201d\nThe former model assured Drew Barrymore that she could walk the talk show host, 49, through the \u201chard\u201d process when her daughters, Olive, 12, and Frankie, 10, move out one day.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what not to do,\u201d MacDowell told the host. \u201cCome to me, because I have all the information on how not to waste your time, how to get on with it and have a good time.

      "text": "Steve Irwin\u2019s daughter Bindi shares major health update amidst her long battle with chronic disease\nBindi Irwin has given a heartwarming update in her long battle with endometriosis following her diagnosis in 2023, which came after a decade of chronic pain.\nIn a post on Instagram, Irwin went into detail about her years-long struggle and revealed that after her latest surgery she is \u201cfinally\u201d beginning to feel like she is \u201chealing\u201d for the first time.\n\u201c51 endometriosis lesions, a cyst, and my appendix were all removed across two surgeries with @seckinmd. My hernia from giving birth that was unzipping \u2013 was taken care of. I can FINALLY say that I\u2019m feeling better. Genuinely healing.\u201d\nIrwin previously underwent emergency surgery in May, which meant she missed a gala honoring her late father.\n\u201cI can function in everyday life without wanting to throw up or pass out from the pain. Slowly, slowly gaining my strength back,\u201d her latest post continued.\n\u201cI cannot express the gravity of my emotions as I am beginning to recognise myself again.\n\u201cI felt utterly ashamed as a teenager and young adult being told that my pain was just part of being a woman.\n\u201cI felt lesser. I felt hurt. I felt weak. That is not OK.\u201d\nShe concluded: \u201cYoung girls and women shouldn\u2019t feel alone with pain in the driver\u2019s seat of their lives.\n\u201cWe need to take away the stigma of talking about women\u2019s health. It\u2019s time to have open discussions and make change on a global scale.\u201d\nLast year, Irwin shared that she had been suffering for years with endometriosis.\nHer story quickly resonated with hundreds of thousands of other Aussie women who had been struggling in silence.\nWhile she was nervous to open up publicly, she\u2019s now grateful she was brave enough to do so.\n\u201cIt is scary when you open up about your most vulnerable and painful times, when you talk about when you felt you were sitting in a very large hole and didn\u2019t know if you were going to crawl out,\u201d she told Courier Mail.\nBefore she shared her story, Irwin revealed that she struggled with people judging her without being aware of the battle she was fighting privately.\n\u201cIt took me so long to talk about it, nobody knew what was happening to me except my mum (Terri Irwin), my brother Robert and my husband Chandler (Powell).\n\u201cEveryone else thought I was becoming this flaky person because I would bow out of commitment after commitment at the last minute because I was in so much pain,\u201d she added before explaining how uncomfortable she was with being asked when she planned on having more children.\n\u201cWhen I went through endo and people would ask, \u2018When are you and Chandler having another child?\u2019 I used to think, \u2018If you could see on the outside what it feels like on the inside you would never ask.\u2019 It would completely change the way you approach somebody.\n\u201cYou know, some people don\u2019t want another child, some can\u2019t have another child, and some people have gone through enormous loss and heartbreak before they have their much wanted child.\u201d\nShe then paused, before adding: \u201cI think you have to be kind in every part of life. If you have the urge to ask, take a second. If someone has good news to share, they\u2019ll share it.\u201d"
