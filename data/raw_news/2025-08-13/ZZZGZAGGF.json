  "title": "Older student loan borrowers face high delinquency rates as Trump administration ramps up collections",
  "description": "There's still time for older student loan borrowers who are behind on their bills to avoid default, and garnishment of their retirement benefits and wages.",
  "content": "There's still time to prevent default\n\nThere are key differences between student loan delinquency and default. While becoming delinquent for 90 days or more on your student loans can show up on your credit report and lower your score, the more severe consequences of federal collection activity don't usually start until you're more than 270 days late and eventually fall into default, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. Meanwhile, private lenders typically consider student borrowers in default after 120 days without a payment, he said. Delinquent student loan borrowers have time to get current, said certified financial planner Douglas Boneparth, president of Bone Fide Wealth in New York. \"For those struggling, the first step is to explore all available federal repayment options, especially income-driven repayment plans, which can significantly lower monthly payments and prevent default,\" said Boneparth, who is also a member of the CNBC Financial Advisor Council. You can try to find a repayment plan with monthly bills you can afford at Studentaid.gov.\n\nThe so-called Income-Based Repayment plan is one of what may be a dwindling number of manageable repayment options left to borrowers, after recent court actions and the passage of President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill. That legislation phases out several other repayment plans. There are tools from the Education Department to help you determine how much your monthly bill would be under different plans. Struggling borrowers can also see if they're eligible to pause their payments, such as through a forbearance or economic hardship deferment \u2014 though it's important to check if your debt will accrue interest during the reprieve. \"Requesting a temporary forbearance can buy time, but ideally, borrowers should aim for an affordable, sustainable payment plan rather than stop-gap measures,\" Boneparth said.\n\nOlder student loan borrowers who are behind on their payments received some good news earlier this summer: The Department of Education has paused its plan to garnish defaulted borrowers' Social Security benefits. Normally, Social Security recipients can see their checks reduced by up to 15% to pay back their defaulted student loan. An Education Department spokesperson told CNBC in an email Tuesday that the department has not offset any Social Security benefits since restarting collections on May 5 and has paused future Social Security offsets. Still, older borrowers should take steps to get their debt out of delinquency as quickly as possible and avoid becoming at risk for more punishing collection activity, said AARP's Trawinski. While the Trump administration said in June that it was pausing Social Security offsets, \"what they did not do is issue a formal rule or regulation saying they won't do so in the future,\" Trawinski said. As a result, she said, \"there's an expectation that they will at some point resume those garnishments.\" For those older borrowers who are still working, the Education Department can also garnish up to 15% of your disposable, or after-tax, pay, toward a defaulted student loan, Kantrowitz said. \"We anticipate wage garnishment to begin later this summer,\" a spokesperson for the Education Department told CNBC on Aug. 5.",

      "text": "A \"double top\" pattern formed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average last week, an indicator of tough times ahead as signs of fatigue surface in the overall market. A double top occurs when an asset reaches a high price twice and fails to break through it, often a bearish indicator suggesting buyer exhaustion and a loss of momentum. Last week, the 30-stock index formed the pattern when it failed to punch past resistance around the 45,000 level. That failure could mean further downside for the Dow, starting with support at 42,500, which is just below the 200-day simple moving average, and a roughly 2.5% drop from Friday's close, according to a Sunday note from Bank of America Securities. More Fibonacci retracement levels, which chart out potential support thresholds, are also at 41,800 and 40,800. \"The Dow failed to breakout about 45,073.63 to show signs of breadth and rotation. Instead, it formed a double top pattern with shorter-term downside target of about 42,500 or just below the 200d SMA,\" Paul Ciana, technical strategist at Bank of America Securities, wrote Sunday. \"Burden on bulls to show signs of support.\" .DJI YTD mountain Dow Jones Industrial Average, year to date The double top in the Dow is not the only sign of weakening market internals, with many chart analysts over the weekend flagging other potential warning signs for the near-term outlook. JC O'Hara, chief market technician at Roth, pointed out that \"plenty of equity indices have run straight into chart resistance,\" with the average stock last week unable to create new highs. BTIG's Jonathan Krinsky noted that the S & P 500 's streak of closes above its 20-day moving average ended Friday. He said he expects there's further downside risk for the broad market index, with support at 6,100, which is roughly 2.2% below Friday's close. \"The Bears started to awaken from their summer slumber,\" Roth's O'Hara wrote Sunday, adding, \"The market is priced to perfection and now prone to near-term downside risk.\" A weakening macroeconomic outlook also adds to the market's woes. Stocks sold off Friday, after the latest jobs data revealed severe cracks in the labor market that raised fears the U.S. is headed for a recession. On Monday, however, stocks recouped some of their losses from Friday's sell-off. The Dow was last higher by more than 500 points, or 1.2%. The S & P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rallied 1.3% and 1.8%, respectively."

      "text": "Shortly after the Trump administration resumed collection efforts on defaulted federal student loans, the Education Department offered more detail to borrowers about the timeline for garnishments and other involuntary collections.\nDozens of borrowers reached out to CNBC with questions and concerns about the change in policy.\nWe spoke with experts to get answers. Here's what we know so far.\nWhy are borrowers now at risk of wage garnishment?\nSince the Covid pandemic began in March 2020, collection activity on federal student loans had mostly been paused. The Biden administration focused on extending relief measures to struggling borrowers in the wake of the public health crisis and helping them to get current.\nThe Trump administration's move to resume collection efforts and garnish wages of those behind on their student loans is a sharp turn away from that strategy. Officials have said that taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook when people don't repay their education debt.\n\"Borrowers should pay back the debts they take on,\" said U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon in a video posted on X on April 22.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nHow many consumers are preparing for an economic hit\nWhy Americans think real estate, gold are the best long-term investments\nTrump tariffs sparked 'uptick' in I bond interest, advisor says. What to know\nConsumer advocates argue that federal student loan borrowers have faced a chaotic lending system, with constantly changing rules, unfair costs and bad information.\n\"People who default on loans typically truly cannot afford to pay them,\" said James Kvaal, who served as U.S. undersecretary of education for former President Joe Biden, in a previous interview with CNBC.\nHow much of my wages can the government take?\nThe U.S. Department of Education can garnish up to 15% of your disposable, or after-tax, pay, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.\nBy law, you must be left with at least 30 times the federal minimum hourly wage ($7.25) a week, which is $217.50, Kantrowitz said.\nWhen could the wage garnishments start?\nThe Treasury Department will send notices to 5.3 million defaulted borrowers about the collection activity of their wages \"later this summer,\" the Education Department wrote in a recent press release.\nAs soon as June, the Trump administration says it will begin seizing portions of defaulted student loan borrowers' federal benefits when applicable, including their Social Security retirement checks. (Social Security recipients can typically see up to 15% of their monthly benefit reduced to pay back their defaulted student debt, but beneficiaries need to be left with at least $750 a month.)\nWhat if I'm self-employed, or a gig worker?\nIt is more difficult for the federal government to garnish the wages of someone who receives 1099 income, Kantrowitz said.\n\"If there is no employer, wage garnishment can't happen,\" he said.\nCan I challenge the wage garnishment?\nYes.\nBorrowers in default will receive a 30-day notice before their wages are garnished, a spokesperson for the Education Department told CNBC.\nDuring that period, you should have the option to have a hearing before an administrative law judge, Kantrowitz said. The Education Department notice is supposed to include information on how you request that, he said.\nYour wages may be protected if you've recently been unemployed, or if you've recently filed for bankruptcy, Kantrowitz said.\nBorrowers can also challenge the wage garnishment if it will result in financial hardship, he added.\nWhat should I tell my employer?\nMost employers will already be familiar with the wage garnishment process, Kantrowitz said, \"since this occurs for a variety of reasons, such as child support, alimony and unpaid taxes \u2014 not just student loans.\"\nYour boss is not allowed to terminate you because of the wage garnishment, Kantrowitz said.\nHow do I get out of default?\nYou can contact the government's Default Resolution Group and pursue a number of different avenues to get current on your loans, including enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan or signing up for loan rehabilitation.\nSome borrowers may also be eligible for deferments or a forbearance, which are different ways to pause your payments, said Carolina Rodriguez, director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York, in an earlier interview with CNBC.\n\"We're advising clients to request a retroactive forbearance to cover missed payments, and a temporary forbearance until they can get enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan,\" she said."

      "text": "The chart of Tesla Inc. (TSLA) shows uncertainty on the part of investors, with fickle price action keeping the stock tethered to its 200-day moving average (MA). Following April's recovery, the stock entered a consolidation phase characterized by volatile swings within a tightening range. This has resulted in a triangle pattern, with TSLA now approaching the lower boundary of that formation near $295. Weakened short-term momentum has characterized the recent downdraft into this support level, which is bolstered by the daily cloud model (shaded area on the chart). However, short-term oversold conditions may help prevent a breakdown. From a longer-term perspective, TSLA remains below resistance from the weekly cloud model, and the weekly MACD is pinched in a reflection of weakened intermediate-term momentum. A crossover would imply downside follow-through, noting also the weekly stochastics are trending lower with room to oversold levels, supporting a breakdown below triangle support. Currently, the weekly cloud model puts initial resistance near $314, and the triangle's upper boundary is near $330. It would be good to see TSLA reclaim these levels. If a triangle breakdown occurs (below $295), secondary support is approximately $273 based on a Fibonacci retracement level. With applications beyond TSLA, we would note that triangle patterns often precede significant directional moves, and breakouts (either up or down) tend to result in immediate follow-through. With this in mind, we would monitor the pattern's boundaries closely. \u2014Katie Stockton with Will Tamplin Access research from Fairlead Strategies for free here .

      "text": "As the Trump administration ramps up its student loan collection efforts, worried borrowers need to ask themselves a key question: Am I delinquent, or in default? The answer determines your best next steps.\n\"We've had a lot of clients contacting us recently who are extremely stressed and, in some cases panicked, about their loan situation,\" said Nancy Nierman, assistant director of the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program in New York.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nHow many consumers are preparing for an economic hit\nWhy Americans think real estate, gold are the best long-term investments\nTrump tariffs sparked 'uptick' in I bond interest, advisor says. What to know\nHowever, some borrowers wrongly believe they'll be subject to wage garnishments or offsets of their retirement benefits \u2014 when in fact they are delinquent but not yet in default, Nierman said.\nIf you're delinquent, there are things you can do to avoid default. And even those who are in default and at risk for collections can take steps to avoid such outcomes.\n\"The federal student loan system does provide several paths for bringing loans out of default,\" she said.\nDelinquent or in default? Here's how to tell\nJust because you're behind on your payments doesn't mean you're in default.\nYour student loan becomes past due, or delinquent, the first day after you miss a payment, according to the U.S. Department of Education.\nNearly 8% of total student debt was reported as 90 days past due in the first quarter of 2025, the New York Fed recently found.\nOnce you are delinquent for 90 days or more, your student loan servicer will report your past due status to the national credit bureaus, which can lead to a drop in your credit score.\nThe Federal Reserve predicted in March that some people with a student loan delinquency could see their scores fall by as much as 171 points. (Credit scores typically range from 300 to 850, with around 670 and higher considered good.)\nLower credit scores can lead to higher borrowing costs on consumer loans such as mortgages, car loans and credit cards.\nBut you're not considered to be in default on your student loans until you haven't made your scheduled payment in at least 270 days, the Education Department says.\nOnly borrowers in default face garnishments\nThe federal government has extraordinary collection powers on its student loans and it can seize borrowers' tax refunds, paychecks and Social Security retirement and disability benefits.\nBut only those who've defaulted on their student loans can face these consequences, experts said.\nHow to get out of student loan delinquency\nDelinquent student loan borrowers should call their student loan servicer right away and request a retroactive forbearance for missed payments and then a temporary forbearance until they enroll in a repayment plan they can afford, according to the experts at the Education Debt Consumer Assistance Program. Some monthly bills under income-driven repayment plans wind up being as low as zero dollars.\nThere are also economic hardship and unemployment deferments available for those who qualify, as well as other ways to keep your loan payments paused while not falling behind.\nHow to get out of student loan default\nMeanwhile, more than 5.3 million student loan borrowers are currently in default, and that total could swell to roughly 10 million borrowers within a few months, the Education Department estimates.\nYou can contact the government's Default Resolution Group and pursue a number of different avenues to get current on your loans, including enrolling in an income-driven repayment plan or signing up for loan rehabilitation.\nYou can get out of default on your student loans through rehabilitating or consolidating your debt, Nierman said.\nRehabilitating involves making \"nine voluntary, reasonable and affordable monthly payments,\" according to the U.S. Department of Education. Those nine payments can be made over \"a period of 10 consecutive months,\" it said.\nConsolidation, meanwhile, may be available to those who \"make three consecutive, voluntary, on-time, full monthly payments.\" At that point, they can essentially repackage their debt into a new loan.\nAfter you've emerged from default, experts also recommend requesting a monthly bill you can afford.\nIf you don't know who your loan servicer is, you can find out at Studentaid.gov.\n\"Explore your options and create a plan for returning your loans back to good standing so you will not be subject to punitive collections activity,\" Nierman said."

      "text": "Student debt often makes it harder for people to save for retirement. But that may soon change.\nA provision in the Secure 2.0 Act of 2022, which had a delayed effective date of Jan. 1, 2024, allows employers to match workers' student loan payments with contributions to their retirement plans.\n\"Many employees paying off their student loans are having trouble saving for the future,\" said Mary Moreland, executive vice president of human resources at Abbott, a medical device and health-care company whose 401(k) matching program for student borrowers led the way to the new policy. \"Now employers can help.\"\nOutstanding student loan debt in the U.S. exceeds $1.6 trillion, and burdens Americans more than credit card or auto loan debt. The average loan balance at graduation has tripled since the 1990s to $30,000 from $10,000. Additionally, about 7% of student loan borrowers are now more than $100,000 in debt.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nWhy workers' raises are smaller in 2024 \u2014 and may not go up from here\nRocky FAFSA rollout leaves millions of students, families frustrated\nTax filing season kicks off Jan. 29. Here's what taxpayers need to know\nNearly half of student loan borrowers said their debt affected how much they were able to salt away in their retirement plans, according to a recent Morning Consult survey of about 500 borrowers between the ages of 18 and 39.\nHere's what borrowers should know about the new benefit.\nIt may take time before your employer offers it\nWhen in 2016 Abbott began to develop its 401(k) match to student loan payments, which it dubbed \"Freedom 2 Save,\" \"there was no other program like it,\" Moreland said. The company requested and received a private ruling from the IRS to allow it to launch the benefit in 2018.\n\"Other companies expressed interest in developing similar programs, but they weren't able to because only Abbott had the private letter ruling,\" she added. \"Secure 2.0 now makes it possible for other employers to implement this type of program with no special dispensation required.\"\nStill, since the broader law just went into effect, it may take some time before the matching program takes off across employers, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.\nWorkers interested in the nascent benefit should ask their company's human resources department about it, he said: \"If several people ask for it, they will start thinking about it.\"\nMoreland recommends employees who hope to see the benefit adopted at their company also share Abbott's \"Freedom 2 Save\" blueprint, available on its website, when they make the case.\n\"In the blueprint you'll find details on how our program works and a guide for how to develop and implement a program of your own,\" Moreland said.\nHow the student debt 401(k) match works\nAt Abbott, eligible employees who put at least 2% of their pay toward their student loan debt will get a 5% company contribution into their 401(k) each year.\nBut companies can decide on their own numbers, Kantrowitz said.\nIn most cases, employers will likely decide whether to match either your student loan payments or your retirement contributions, but not both, Kantrowitz said. If your employer currently has a 401(k) match in effect, it is unlikely to raise that rate, even if it establishes the benefit.\n\"Employees do not actually need to prove that they are making payments on their student loan,\" Kantrowitz added. \"They simply need to sign a document attesting that they are making the payments.\"\nThe law allows employers to match workers' payments on both federal and private loans.\nOne thing to keep in mind is your contributions to your 401(k) are pretax and reduce your taxable income, and so pausing these payments to focus on paying down your debt may leave you with a slightly larger tax obligation.\nDon't miss these stories from CNBC PRO:\n- There's one stock Wall Street loves so much for 2024 that five analysts in one day picked it as their favorite\n- Morgan Stanley names its top stocks for 2024, including this streaming giant\n- Investing tips from Warren Buffett to start the new year on the right foot\n- Goldman sees a 50% gain ahead for this Chinese electric vehicle stock, initiates with buy rating\n- 'Twice as cheap': These stocks' discount to the S&P 500 is double its average, Ritholtz's Brown says"

      "text": "The U.S. Department of Education today announced its Office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) will resume collections of its defaulted federal student loan portfolio on Monday, May 5th. The Department has not collected on defaulted loans since March 2020. Resuming collections protects taxpayers from shouldering the cost of federal student loans that borrowers willingly undertook to finance their postsecondary education. This initiative will be paired with a comprehensive communications and outreach campaign to ensure borrowers understand how to return to repayment or get out of default.\nWhile Congress mandated that student and parent borrowers begin to repay their student loans in October 2023, the Biden-Harris Administration refused to lift the collections pause and kept borrowers in a confusing limbo. The previous Administration failed to process applications for borrowers who applied for income-driven repayment and continued to push misguided \u201con-ramps\u201d and illegal loan forgiveness schemes to win points with borrowers and mask rising delinquency and default rates.\n\u201cAmerican taxpayers will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for irresponsible student loan policies,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. \u201cThe Biden Administration misled borrowers: the executive branch does not have the constitutional authority to wipe debt away, nor do the loan balances simply disappear. Hundreds of billions have already been transferred to taxpayers. Going forward, the Department of Education, in conjunction with the Department of Treasury, will shepherd the student loan program responsibly and according to the law, which means helping borrowers return to repayment\u2014both for the sake of their own financial health and our nation\u2019s economic outlook.\u201d\nFederal student loans are financed by the American people. Instead of protecting responsible taxpayers, the Biden-Harris Administration put them on the hook for irresponsible lending, pushing the federal student loan portfolio toward a fiscal cliff:\n- Today, 42.7 million borrowers owe more than $1.6 trillion in student debt.\n- More than 5 million borrowers have not made a monthly payment in over 360 days and sit in default\u2014many for more than 7 years\u2014and 4 million borrowers are in late-stage delinquency (91-180 days). As a result, there could be almost 10 million borrowers in default in a few months. When this happens, almost 25 percent of the federal student loan portfolio will be in default.\n- Only 38 percent of borrowers are in repayment and current on their student loans. Most of the remaining borrowers are either delinquent on their payments, in an interest-free forbearance, or in an interest-free deferment. A small percentage of borrowers are in a 6-month grace period or in-school.\n- Currently, almost 1.9 million borrowers have been unable to even begin repayment because of a processing pause put in place by the previous administration. Since August 2024, the Department has not processed applications for enrollment in any repayment plan such as Income-Based Repayment, Income-Contingent Repayment, or PAYE. The Department is currently working with its federal student loan servicers and anticipates processing to begin next month.\nInvoluntary Collections for Defaulted Borrowers\nFSA will restart the Treasury Offset Program, administered by the U.S. Department of Treasury, on Monday, May 5, 2025. All borrowers in default will receive email communications from FSA over the next 2 weeks making them aware of these developments and urging them to contact the Default Resolution Group to make a monthly payment, enroll in an income-driven repayment plan, or sign up for loan rehabilitation. Later this summer, FSA will send required notices beginning administrative wage garnishment.\nThe Department will also authorize guaranty agencies that they may begin involuntary collections activities on loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program. All FSA collection activities are required under the Higher Education Act and conducted only after student and parent borrowers have been provided sufficient notice and opportunity to repay their loans under the law.\nSupport for Current and Struggling Borrowers\nFSA is committed to keeping borrowers updated with clear information about their payment options to put them on a productive path toward repaying their federal student loans. Over the next two months, FSA will conduct a robust communications campaign to engage all borrowers on the importance of repayment. FSA will conduct outreach to borrowers through emails and social media reminding them of their obligations and providing resources and support to assist them in selecting the best repayment plan, like the new Loan Simulator, AI Assistant (Aiden), and extended servicers call times. FSA will also launch an enhanced Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) process, simplifying the time that it will take borrowers to enroll in IDR plans and eliminating the need for borrowers to recertify their income every year. More information will be posted on StudentAid.gov next week.\nFSA intends to enlist its partners \u2013 states, institutions of higher education, financial aid administrators, college access and success organizations, third-party servicers, and other stakeholders \u2013 to assist in this campaign to restore commonsense and fairness with the message: student and parent borrowers \u2013 not taxpayers \u2013 must repay their student loans. There will not be any mass loan forgiveness. Together, these actions will move the federal student loan portfolio back into repayment, which benefits borrowers and taxpayers alike.\nDetailed information to help borrowers get out of default is also available at StudentAid.gov/end-default."

      "text": "President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" which Congress passed earlier this month, has tax implications for people who receive student loan forgiveness.\nHere's what borrowers expecting the loan relief should know.\nStudent loan forgiveness may be taxable again\nThe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 made student loan forgiveness tax-free at the federal level through the end of 2025. Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" while making other specific kinds of student loan relief tax-free, did not extend or make permanent that broader provision.\nIn theory, lawmakers could move to protect the relief from taxes before the end of the year, but borrowers shouldn't count on it, experts say.\n\"Republicans do not like [student loan] forgiveness, and are unlikely to make it tax-free,\" said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.\nWithout action from Congress, student loan borrowers who get their debt forgiven under the U.S. Department of Education's income-driven repayment plans, or IDRs, would face a federal tax bill again starting in 2026. (IDR plans cap people's monthly payments at a share of their discretionary income and cancel any remaining debt after a certain period, typically 20 years or 25 years.)\nThat tax bill at the end of repayment could be significant \u2014 the IRS typically counts forgiven debt as income, Kantrowitz said.\nMore from Personal Finance:\nTrump's 'big beautiful bill' slashes CFPB funding\n78% say Trump's tariffs will make it harder to deal with debt\nTax changes under Trump's 'big beautiful bill' \u2014 in one chart\nThe average loan balance for borrowers enrolled in an IDR plan is around $57,000, Kantrowitz said. For those in the 22% tax bracket, having that amount wiped out would trigger a tax burden of over $12,000, Kantrowitz estimates. Lower earners, or those in the 12% tax bracket, would still owe around $7,000.\nBorrowers could also be on the hook for state taxes following their student loan forgiveness. (Many states mirror the federal government's tax policy on student loans, meaning more states may start to levy the aid next year as well, experts say.)\nConsumer advocates have long criticized the practice of taxing borrowers on their student loan forgiveness. They say that borrowers who enroll in IDR plans tend to struggle to keep up with their bills, and that the government's policy often wipes away one's student debt just to saddle them with a tax debt.\n\"Forcing borrowers to remain drowning in debt is cruel,\" said Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at the Student Borrower Protection Center.\n'Big beautiful bill' makes other student relief tax-free\nThe \"big beautiful bill\" did permanently make it so that student loan forgiveness in cases of death or disability are tax-free, Kantrowitz said.\nEmployees who receive help from their company paying down their debt also won't owe any taxes in the future on that relief, due to the legislation, he added. The current allowable annual tax-free contribution from firms is $5,250, but that amount will increase with inflation.\nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness has always been, and will continue to be, tax-free on the federal level, under its terms. (It's possible your state will tax you on the aid). That program allows government and certain non-profit workers to get their debt excused after a decade of payments."

  "argos_summary": "The article discusses the differences between student loan delinquency and default, emphasizing that borrowers have options to avoid default, such as exploring federal repayment plans and forbearance. The U.S. Department of Education has paused plans to garnish Social Security benefits for defaulted borrowers, providing them with more time to address their debts. Additionally, the Secure 2.0 Act allows employers to match student loan payments with retirement contributions, potentially easing the financial burden on borrowers. However, there are concerns about the tax implications of student loan forgiveness under recent legislation.",
