      "summary": "Rob Kaplan, former Dallas Fed president and Goldman Sachs vice‑chairman, stresses that the Fed must remain independent from political pressure as it navigates a complex mix of high inflation, sluggish growth and tariff uncertainty. He signals that the Fed may cut rates in September but will take a cautious, data‑dependent approach rather than launching a full cycle. Kaplan highlights structural drivers such as the AI data‑center power boom that could ease inflation, while noting that labor‑force constraints and overcapacity in goods markets will keep growth muted. The upcoming leadership transition in May could shape policy tone, but Kaplan urges the new chair to focus on consensus and evidence‑based decisions.",
