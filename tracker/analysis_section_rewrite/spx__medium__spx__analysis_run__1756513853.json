      "feedback": "The draft is a pure company‑level narrative that violates the acceptance gate: it references CRWD (not a canonical handle) and lacks a clear causal chain to a liquid market handle (e.g., spx, ndx, or a sector index). All sentences that drift from the macro pillars should be removed or rewritten to map to a canonical handle with an explicit sign and magnitude. For example:  \n\n- **Remove** the paragraph that begins “CrowdStrike’s Q2 2025 results…” – it is a company‑specific earnings recap with no handle mapping.  \n- **Re‑frame** the discussion of revenue growth and margin improvement as a *US tech‑equity* catalyst, linking it to the *spx* or *ndx* index (e.g., “a 2–3 bp upside to the spx if Q3 revenue exceeds guidance”).  \n- **Add** a catalyst window tied to a macro event: “Fed policy shift in Q4 2025 (Fed minutes) → risk‑premium compression → 1–2 bp lift to the spx and 5–10 bp lift to the CRWD equity.”  \n- **Include** a clear invalidation scenario: “If Q3 earnings miss by >10 % → 3 bp downgrade of the spx and 15 bp sell‑side pressure on CRWD.”  \n\nEnsure every claim references a source ID (e.g., KNWKYIQ1W) and that the final output maps to at least one canonical handle with a signed magnitude and a dated catalyst window. If this cannot be achieved, the topic should be rejected per the hard ban rules.",
