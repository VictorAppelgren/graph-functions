  "description": "New research reveals how OS agents \u2014 AI systems that control computers like humans \u2014 are rapidly advancing while raising serious security and privacy concerns.",
  "content": "Researchers have published the most comprehensive survey to date of so-called \u201cOS Agents\u201d \u2014 artificial intelligence systems that can autonomously control computers, mobile phones and web browsers by directly interacting with their interfaces. The 30-page academic review, accepted for publication at the prestigious Association for Computational Linguistics conference, maps a rapidly evolving field that has attracted billions in investment from major technology companies.\n\n\u201cThe dream to create AI assistants as capable and versatile as the fictional J.A.R.V.I.S from Iron Man has long captivated imaginations,\u201d the researchers write. \u201cWith the evolution of (multimodal) large language models ((M)LLMs), this dream is closer to reality.\u201d\n\nThe survey, led by researchers from Zhejiang University and OPPO AI Center, comes as major technology companies race to deploy AI agents that can perform complex digital tasks. OpenAI recently launched \u201cOperator,\u201d Anthropic released \u201cComputer Use,\u201d Apple introduced enhanced AI capabilities in \u201cApple Intelligence,\u201d and Google unveiled \u201cProject Mariner\u201d \u2014 all systems designed to automate computer interactions.\n\nTech giants rush to deploy AI that controls your desktop\n\nThe speed at which academic research has transformed into consumer-ready products is unprecedented, even by Silicon Valley standards. The survey reveals a research explosion: over 60 foundation models and 50 agent frameworks developed specifically for computer control, with publication rates accelerating dramatically since 2023.\n\nThis isn\u2019t just incremental progress. We\u2019re witnessing the emergence of AI systems that can genuinely understand and manipulate the digital world the way humans do. Current systems work by taking screenshots of computer screens, using advanced computer vision to understand what\u2019s displayed, then executing precise actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, and navigating between applications.\n\n\u201cOS Agents can complete tasks autonomously and have the potential to significantly enhance the lives of billions of users worldwide,\u201d the researchers note. \u201cImagine a world where tasks such as online shopping, travel arrangements booking, and other daily activities could be seamlessly performed by these agents.\u201d\n\nThe most sophisticated systems can handle complex multi-step workflows that span different applications \u2014 booking a restaurant reservation, then automatically adding it to your calendar, then setting a reminder to leave early for traffic. What took humans minutes of clicking and typing can now happen in seconds, without human intervention.\n\nWhy security experts are sounding alarms about AI-controlled corporate systems\n\nFor enterprise technology leaders, the promise of productivity gains comes with a sobering reality: these systems represent an entirely new attack surface that most organizations aren\u2019t prepared to defend.\n\nThe researchers dedicate substantial attention to what they diplomatically term \u201csafety and privacy\u201d concerns, but the implications are more alarming than their academic language suggests. \u201cOS Agents are confronted with these risks, especially considering its wide applications on personal devices with user data,\u201d they write.\n\nThe attack methods they document read like a cybersecurity nightmare. \u201cWeb Indirect Prompt Injection\u201d allows malicious actors to embed hidden instructions in web pages that can hijack an AI agent\u2019s behavior. Even more concerning are \u201cenvironmental injection attacks\u201d where seemingly innocuous web content can trick agents into stealing user data or performing unauthorized actions.\n\nConsider the implications: an AI agent with access to your corporate email, financial systems, and customer databases could be manipulated by a carefully crafted web page to exfiltrate sensitive information. Traditional security models, built around human users who can spot obvious phishing attempts, break down when the \u201cuser\u201d is an AI system that processes information differently.\n\nThe survey reveals a concerning gap in preparedness. While general security frameworks exist for AI agents, \u201cstudies on defenses specific to OS Agents remain limited.\u201d This isn\u2019t just an academic concern \u2014 it\u2019s an immediate challenge for any organization considering deployment of these systems.\n\nThe reality check: Current AI agents still struggle with complex digital tasks\n\nDespite the hype surrounding these systems, the survey\u2019s analysis of performance benchmarks reveals significant limitations that temper expectations for immediate widespread adoption.\n\nSuccess rates vary dramatically across different tasks and platforms. Some commercial systems achieve success rates above 50% on certain benchmarks \u2014 impressive for a nascent technology \u2014 but struggle with others. The researchers categorize evaluation tasks into three types: basic \u201cGUI grounding\u201d (understanding interface elements), \u201cinformation retrieval\u201d (finding and extracting data), and complex \u201cagentic tasks\u201d (multi-step autonomous operations).\n\nThe pattern is telling: current systems excel at simple, well-defined tasks but falter when faced with the kind of complex, context-dependent workflows that define much of modern knowledge work. They can reliably click a specific button or fill out a standard form, but struggle with tasks that require sustained reasoning or adaptation to unexpected interface changes.\n\nThis performance gap explains why early deployments focus on narrow, high-volume tasks rather than general-purpose automation. The technology isn\u2019t yet ready to replace human judgment in complex scenarios, but it\u2019s increasingly capable of handling routine digital busywork.\n\nWhat happens when AI agents learn to customize themselves for every user\n\nPerhaps the most intriguing \u2014 and potentially transformative \u2014 challenge identified in the survey involves what researchers call \u201cpersonalization and self-evolution.\u201d Unlike today\u2019s stateless AI assistants that treat every interaction as independent, future OS agents will need to learn from user interactions and adapt to individual preferences over time.\n\n\u201cDeveloping personalized OS Agents has been a long-standing goal in AI research,\u201d the authors write. \u201cA personal assistant is expected to continuously adapt and provide enhanced experiences based on individual user preferences.\u201d\n\nThis capability could fundamentally change how we interact with technology. Imagine an AI agent that learns your email writing style, understands your calendar preferences, knows which restaurants you prefer, and can make increasingly sophisticated decisions on your behalf. The potential productivity gains are enormous, but so are the privacy implications.\n\nThe technical challenges are substantial. The survey points to the need for better multimodal memory systems that can handle not just text but images and voice, presenting \u201csignificant challenges\u201d for current technology. How do you build a system that remembers your preferences without creating a comprehensive surveillance record of your digital life?\n\nFor technology executives evaluating these systems, this personalization challenge represents both the greatest opportunity and the largest risk. The organizations that solve it first will gain significant competitive advantages, but the privacy and security implications could be severe if handled poorly.\n\nThe race to build AI assistants that can truly operate like human users is intensifying rapidly. While fundamental challenges around security, reliability, and personalization remain unsolved, the trajectory is clear. The researchers maintain an open-source repository tracking developments, acknowledging that \u201cOS Agents are still in their early stages of development\u201d with \u201crapid advancements that continue to introduce novel methodologies and applications.\u201d\n\nThe question isn\u2019t whether AI agents will transform how we interact with computers \u2014 it\u2019s whether we\u2019ll be ready for the consequences when they do. The window for getting the security and privacy frameworks right is narrowing as quickly as the technology is advancing.",

      "text": "Introducing computer use, a new Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Haiku\nUpdate (12/03/2024): We have revised the pricing for Claude 3.5 Haiku. The model is now priced at $0.80 MTok input / $4 MTok output.\nToday, we\u2019re announcing an upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and a new model, Claude 3.5 Haiku. The upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet delivers across-the-board improvements over its predecessor, with particularly significant gains in coding\u2014an area where it already led the field. Claude 3.5 Haiku matches the performance of Claude 3 Opus, our prior largest model, on many evaluations at a similar speed to the previous generation of Haiku.\nWe\u2019re also introducing a groundbreaking new capability in public beta: computer use. Available today on the API, developers can direct Claude to use computers the way people do\u2014by looking at a screen, moving a cursor, clicking buttons, and typing text. Claude 3.5 Sonnet is the first frontier AI model to offer computer use in public beta. At this stage, it is still experimental\u2014at times cumbersome and error-prone. We're releasing computer use early for feedback from developers, and expect the capability to improve rapidly over time.\nAsana, Canva, Cognition, DoorDash, Replit, and The Browser Company have already begun to explore these possibilities, carrying out tasks that require dozens, and sometimes even hundreds, of steps to complete. For example, Replit is using Claude 3.5 Sonnet's capabilities with computer use and UI navigation to develop a key feature that evaluates apps as they\u2019re being built for their Replit Agent product.\nThe upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet is now available for all users. Starting today, developers can build with the computer use beta on the Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI. The new Claude 3.5 Haiku will be released later this month.\nClaude 3.5 Sonnet: Industry-leading software engineering skills\nThe updated Claude 3.5 Sonnet shows wide-ranging improvements on industry benchmarks, with particularly strong gains in agentic coding and tool use tasks. On coding, it improves performance on SWE-bench Verified from 33.4% to 49.0%, scoring higher than all publicly available models\u2014including reasoning models like OpenAI o1-preview and specialized systems designed for agentic coding. It also improves performance on TAU-bench, an agentic tool use task, from 62.6% to 69.2% in the retail domain, and from 36.0% to 46.0% in the more challenging airline domain. The new Claude 3.5 Sonnet offers these advancements at the same price and speed as its predecessor.\nEarly customer feedback suggests the upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet represents a significant leap for AI-powered coding. GitLab, which tested the model for DevSecOps tasks, found it delivered stronger reasoning (up to 10% across use cases) with no added latency, making it an ideal choice to power multi-step software development processes. Cognition uses the new Claude 3.5 Sonnet for autonomous AI evaluations, and experienced substantial improvements in coding, planning, and problem-solving compared to the previous version. The Browser Company, in using the model for automating web-based workflows, noted Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed every model they\u2019ve tested before.\nAs part of our continued effort to partner with external experts, joint pre-deployment testing of the new Claude 3.5 Sonnet model was conducted by the US AI Safety Institute (US AISI) and the UK Safety Institute (UK AISI).\nWe also evaluated the upgraded Claude 3.5 Sonnet for catastrophic risks and found that the ASL-2 Standard, as outlined in our Responsible Scaling Policy, remains appropriate for this model.\nClaude 3.5 Haiku: State-of-the-art meets affordability and speed\nClaude 3.5 Haiku is the next generation of our fastest model. For a similar speed to Claude 3 Haiku, Claude 3.5 Haiku improves across every skill set and surpasses even Claude 3 Opus, the largest model in our previous generation, on many intelligence benchmarks. Claude 3.5 Haiku is particularly strong on coding tasks. For example, it scores 40.6% on SWE-bench Verified, outperforming many agents using publicly available state-of-the-art models\u2014including the original Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o.\nWith low latency, improved instruction following, and more accurate tool use, Claude 3.5 Haiku is well suited for user-facing products, specialized sub-agent tasks, and generating personalized experiences from huge volumes of data\u2014like purchase history, pricing, or inventory records.\nClaude 3.5 Haiku will be made available later this month across our first-party API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI\u2014initially as a text-only model and with image input to follow.\nTeaching Claude to navigate computers, responsibly\nWith computer use, we're trying something fundamentally new. Instead of making specific tools to help Claude complete individual tasks, we're teaching it general computer skills\u2014allowing it to use a wide range of standard tools and software programs designed for people. Developers can use this nascent capability to automate repetitive processes, build and test software, and conduct open-ended tasks like research.\nTo make these general skills possible, we've built an API that allows Claude to perceive and interact with computer interfaces. Developers can integrate this API to enable Claude to translate instructions (e.g., \u201cuse data from my computer and online to fill out this form\u201d) into computer commands (e.g. check a spreadsheet; move the cursor to open a web browser; navigate to the relevant web pages; fill out a form with the data from those pages; and so on). On OSWorld, which evaluates AI models' ability to use computers like people do, Claude 3.5 Sonnet scored 14.9% in the screenshot-only category\u2014notably better than the next-best AI system's score of 7.8%. When afforded more steps to complete the task, Claude scored 22.0%.\nWhile we expect this capability to improve rapidly in the coming months, Claude's current ability to use computers is imperfect. Some actions that people perform effortlessly\u2014scrolling, dragging, zooming\u2014currently present challenges for Claude and we encourage developers to begin exploration with low-risk tasks. Because computer use may provide a new vector for more familiar threats such as spam, misinformation, or fraud, we're taking a proactive approach to promote its safe deployment. We've developed new classifiers that can identify when computer use is being used and whether harm is occurring. You can read more about the research process behind this new skill, along with further discussion of safety measures, in our post on developing computer use.\nLooking ahead\nLearning from the initial deployments of this technology, which is still in its earliest stages, will help us better understand both the potential and the implications of increasingly capable AI systems.\nWe\u2019re excited for you to explore our new models and the public beta of computer use\u2014and welcome you to share your feedback with us. We believe these developments will open up new possibilities for how you work with Claude, and we look forward to seeing what you'll create."

      "text": "This project conducts a comprehensive survey on OS Agents, which are (M)LLM-based Agents using computers, phones and browsers by operating within the environments and interfaces (e.g., Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command Line Interface (CLI)) provided by operating systems (OS) to automate tasks. The survey begins by elucidating the fundamentals of OS Agents, exploring their key components including the environment, observation space, and action space, and outlining essential capabilities such as understanding, planning, and grounding. Methodologies for constructing OS Agents are examined, with a focus on domain-specific foundation models and agent frameworks. A detailed review of evaluation protocols and benchmarks highlights how OS Agents are assessed across diverse tasks. Finally, current challenges and promising future research directions, including safety and privacy, personalization and self-evolution, are discussed. Ultimately, we hope this study will serve as a catalyst for innovation, driving meaningful progress in both academia and industry.\nPlease let us know if you find out a mistake or are interested in contributing by e-mail: huxueyu.zju@gmail.com.\nIf you find our work valuable for your research or applications, we would greatly appreciate a star \u2b50 and a citation using the BibTeX entry provided below.\n@misc{hu2024agents,\ntitle={OS Agents: A Survey on MLLM-based Agents for Computer, Phone and Browser Use},\nauthor={Hu, Xueyu and Xiong, Tao and Yi, Biao and Wei, Zishu and Xiao, Ruixuan and Chen, Yurun and Ye, Jiasheng and Tao, Meiling and Zhou, Xiangxin and Zhao, Ziyu and others},\nyear={2024},\npublisher={OpenReview}\n}"
