      "text": "Social Security Administration adds 13 more conditions to expedited benefits list\nThe Social Security Administration has added 13 new diseases and conditions to its list of disabilities, which earn those suffering serious medical issues a faster benefits application process.\nThose applying for Social Security Disability Insurance or Supplemental Security Income who have conditions on the Compassionate Allowances list, or CAL, have their applications processed more quickly, the agency says. Since the program started in 2008, more than 1.1 million people with severe disabilities have been approved via the expedited process, the SSA said in a news release dated Aug. 11.\n\u201cWe are constantly looking for ways to improve our disability programs and serve the public more effectively,\u201d said SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano in the news release. \"This is part of our broader commitment to making the disability determination process as responsive and compassionate as possible.\u201d\nSocial Security Administration's list of conditions for expedited benefits applications\nThe addition of the 13 conditions brings the Compassionate Allowances list to 300 serious diseases and conditions that warrant an expedited benefits process. Here are the new conditions added:\n- Au-Kline Syndrome\n- Bilateral Anophthalmia\n- Carey-Fineman-Ziter Syndrome\n- Harlequin Ichthyosis \u2013 Child\n- Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation\n- LMNA-related Congenital Muscular Dystrophy\n- Progressive Muscular Atrophy\n- Pulmonary Amyloidosis \u2013 AL Type\n- Rasmussen Encephalitis\n- Thymic Carcinoma\n- Turnpenny-Fry Syndrome\n- WHO Grade III Meningiomas\n- Zhu-Tokita-Takenouchi-Kim Syndrome\n\"By adding these 13 conditions to the Compassionate Allowances list, we are helping more people with devastating diagnoses to quickly receive the support they need,\" Bisignano said.\nWho can apply for Social Security disability benefits?\nPeople who have been unable to work for a year (12 consecutive months) or more because of a disability can apply for Social Security Disability Insurance, the SSA says. Those whose disabilities are on the Compassionate Allowances list, will have their applications processed more quickly. Typically, SSDI applicants have a 5-month waiting period before payments begin in the sixth month after the agency approved an applicant's disability.\nSupplemental Security Income provides benefits for those with limited income or resources, those aged 65 or older and those who are blind or have a qualifying disability. Children with a qualifying disability can also get SSI, according to the agency's website. Applicants typically wait six to eight months for an initial decision after submitting their application, federal officials says.\nDuring the process of determining whether to approve benefits, the SSA must get applicants' medical records. In the case of CAL applicants, the agency will attempt to use technological means including electronic medical records to more quickly process the claim.\n\"The CAL initiative acts as a fast-track to those benefits for individuals who need them most,\" reported financial news site Investopedia.\nBut the expanse of the list runs counter to some other moves the Trump adminstration has made in regards to Social Security, said Jessica Mason, senior policy analyst for economic justice for National Partnership for Women & Families.\n\"Changes that help ease disabled people's access to their benefits can be beneficial. But in the bigger picture, this administration is laying off Social Security staff and just signed a budget law that goes after Medicaid and food assistance that disabled people rely on,\" Mason said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"In that context, tweaking the Compassionate Allowances list is a bit like rearranging deck chairs while setting the ship on fire. For disabled people and all of us to thrive, we need Social Security to have not only better processes but real investments in staffing and infrastructure, and to be paired with a stronger safety net across the board.\"\nThis story has been updated with new information.\nMike Snider is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

In 2025, there have been over 1,000 cases of unruly passengers on board commercial planes, according to the FAA.\nFollowing the incident, the passenger was taken into custody by the Grand Junction Police Department and transported to the Mesa County Detention Facility.\nThe flight was temporarily delayed at Grand Junction Airport while a new crew was brought in, the airline said in a statement. The flight departed from Colorado around 6 p.m. and arrived in Los Angeles at approximately 7 p.m.\nAn investigation into the incident remains ongoing.\nBreeze Airways is a low-cost airline headquartered in Cottonwood Heights, Utah, and provides nonstop service between underserved routes at affordable rates, according to its website. The airline began operating commercially in 2021.\nThis story has been updated to add new information.\nMichelle Del Rey is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "27-year-old U.S. hiker found dead in Spain nearly month after going missing: Authorities\nAuthorities have reportedly found the body of an American hiker who'd been missing in the mountains along the Spain-France border since July 14.\nGuilford Cole Henderson, 27, appeared to have fallen about 650 feet down a mountain in Spain's remote Ordesa y Monte Pardido National Park in the Pyrenees mountains, according to both digital newspaper El Espa\u00f1ol and the newspaper El Diario De Huesca.\nAuthorities are transporting the recovered body to a forensic medicine institute to \"confirm his identity,\" El Espa\u00f1ol reported.\nThe search for the Rhodes College alumnus has drawn international media attention since his friends posted pleas for help on social media in finding him. Several of his friends had hiked with him in Spain's remote Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park. According to friends on Facebook, Henderson decided to hike alone after putting his cell phone on airplane mode to save battery power.\nThe friends said they became concerned when Henderson didn't show for a June 14 flight from Spain to Amsterdam, where Henderson was living.\nParents informed about body discovery\nSpanish authorities have told Henderson's parents, Trevania and John Henderson, that they believe they've recovered their son's body, according to loved ones in Nashville who spoke to The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network.\nHenderson's parents, who now live in New England, traveled to Spain for at least a week to help with daily search efforts. His mother, who grew up in Nashville, still has connections to the area and visits Tennessee often, loved ones said.\nThe US Embassy in Spain and the Spanish Civil Guard both declined to comment in an email to The Tennessean, requesting further information.\nWho was Cole Henderson?\nHenderson was a 27-year-old who attended high school in Delaware and graduated from Rhodes College in Memphis in 2020 with honors with a degree in computer science.\nHe is the grandson of the late Guilford Dudley Jr., who founded Nashville's annual white-tie gala, known as the Swan Ball, and the former US Ambassador to Denmark under the Nixon administration, according to The Tennessean.\nHis former employers include software companies in Wellesley, Massachusetts, and San Francisco, as shown on his social media profiles. According to his LinkedIn profile, he was living in Amsterdam while working as an engineer for the software company Dexter Energy.\nA self-described avid packer, social media posts show that he has traveled across the world, from skiing in Breckenridge, Colorado, to hiking in South Dakota's Badlands National Park, and from volunteering in Costa Rica to trekking along the famed Tour du Mont Blanc through Switzerland, Italy and France.\n\"Cole is an experienced traveler, a kind and curious soul, and someone who means the world to me,\" friend Eric Simon said in a July 15 Facebook post asking for help finding Henderson.\nWhere was Cole Henderson hiking?\nHenderson was set to hike through the Ordesa Valley in the Pyrenees Mountains to a mountain hut known as Refugio de Pineta.\nHe parked his car in the Spanish village of Torla and his friends believed he was going to catch a ride back to his vehicle. Friends also said he planned on camping while in the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park, located in the mountains on the border between northern Spain and France.\nOfficials do not know how long Henderson planned on hiking or whether he would attempt any of the peaks along the way.\nOn July 10, hikers reported rain and severe thunder, the day after Henderson began his hike. They also mentioned that there was limited to no cell service on the route Henderson was possibly using.\nContributing: Amanda Lee Myers, USA TODAY"

      "text": "When will Tropical Storm Erin strengthen into a hurricane? See path tracker\nTropical Storm Erin is continuing its path west on the way to becoming a major hurricane this weekend and the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season, forecasters said.\nAs of 11 a.m. ET advisory on Aug. 14, Erin was located about 890 miles east of the northern Leeward Islands with maximum sustained winds around 60 mph with higher gusts after strengthening some since earlier morning, the National Hurricane Center said. Erin is currently moving west at about 17 mph, and this motion is expected through Thursday, with a west-northwestward motion beginning Thursday night and continuing into the weekend, according to forecasters.\nIf Erin stays on track, it is expected to strengthen into a hurricane by 2 p.m. on Aug. 15 and a major hurricane of Category 3 or higher within three days, the hurricane center said. Gradual strengthening is forecasted over the next day with more significant intensification at the end of the week and into the weekend.\n\"There continues to be confidence that Erin will be a large and powerful hurricane over the southwestern Atlantic Ocean this weekend,\" the hurricane center said.\nThe hurricane center said the center of Erin is likely to move near or just north of the northern Leeward Islands over the weekend. Swells generated by Erin will begin affecting portions of the northern Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by this weekend, with the swells likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions.\nMost reliable computer models that meteorologists use to forecast storms show Erin curving away from the United States, spinning off the East Coast in mid-August.\nHowever, even if Erin does avoid landfall on the United States, \"there will be a significant increase in seas, surf, and rip currents along the East Coast beaches next weekend into the following week,\" AccuWeather senior meteorologist Chad Merrill said.\nAccuWeather Lead Hurricane Expert Alex DaSilva said to beware of rip currents at East Coast beaches: \u201cFamilies heading to Atlantic beaches this weekend and next week for a late-summer vacation need to be careful. Rip currents can be deadly. More than 50 people have lost their lives to rip currents and rough surf at beaches across the country so far this year.\u201d\nTropical Storm Erin path tracker\nIllustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest-performing models to help make its forecasts.\nTropical Storm Erin spaghetti models\nIllustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest-performing models to help make its forecasts.\nNHC also tracking a system in the Gulf\nIn addition to Erin, the hurricane center also said it is keeping an eye on a broad area of low pressure near the west coast of the Yucatan Peninsula that is producing disorganized showers and thunderstorms.\nThe system is forecast to emerge off the coast later this morning and move west-northwest across the southwestern Gulf during the next day or two, according to the hurricane center, where environmental conditions are marginally conducive for further development.\nThe system is also forecast to move inland over northeastern Mexico by late Friday, ending its chances of formation. The NHC gives the system a 20% chance of formation through the next seven days.\nHow do hurricanes form?\nHurricanes are born in the tropics, above warm water. Clusters of thunderstorms can develop over the ocean when water temperatures exceed 80 degrees. If conditions are right, the clusters swirl into a storm known as a tropical wave or tropical depression.\nA tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm once its sustained wind speeds reach 39 mph. When its winds reach 74 mph, the storm officially becomes a hurricane.\nPrepare now for hurricanes\nDelaying potentially lifesaving preparations could mean waiting until it\u2019s too late. \"Get your disaster supplies while the shelves are still stocked, and get that insurance checkup early, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recommends.\n- Develop an evacuation plan. If you are at risk from hurricanes, you need an evacuation plan. Now is the time to begin planning where you would go and how you would get there.\n- Assemble disaster supplies. Whether you\u2019re evacuating or sheltering in place, you\u2019re going to need supplies not just to get through the storm but for a possibly lengthy aftermath, NOAA said.\n- Get an insurance checkup and document your possessions. Contact your insurance company or agent now and ask for an insurance checkup to make sure you have enough insurance to repair or even replace your home and belongings. Remember, home and renters insurance doesn\u2019t cover flooding, so you\u2019ll need a separate policy for it. Flood insurance is available through your company, agent or the National Flood Insurance Program. Act now, because flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period.\n- Create a family communication plan. NOAA says you should take the time now to write down a hurricane plan and share it with your family. Determine family meeting places and make sure to include an out-of-town location in case of evacuation.\n- Strengthen your home. Now is the time to improve your home\u2019s ability to withstand hurricanes. Trim trees; install storm shutters, accordion shutters, and impact glass; seal outside wall openings.\nGabe Hauari is a national trending news reporter at USA TODAY.

Time, schedule, location, subject of talks\nPresident Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to meet for a face-to-face summit on Aug. 15, and both leaders are traveling to Anchorage, Alaska, for the sit-down.\nThe two presidents as are expected to discuss Russia's war with Ukraine, which was launched with its full-scale invasion of the country more than three years ago, as Trump angles for a peace deal. It's a high-stakes exercise for Trump as he wades into the conflict and attempts a mediator-type role, as America's staunch support of Ukraine has come under fire from some in his own party and European leaders insist Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy be present for future talks.\nHere's what to know about the highly anticipated diplomatic summit.\nWhen and where is the meeting?\nThe pair's meeting is set to start at 11:30 a.m. Alaska time (3:30 p.m. ET) and a joint press conference is expected to follow.\nThe two world leaders will meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska. The base hosts about 30,000 service members, their family members and civilian employees, and is approximately 700 miles from the border with Russia.\nTrump is scheduled to leave Washington, D.C., early Aug. 15, flying about six to seven hours on Air Force One before landing in Anchorage.\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, appearing Aug. 14 on Fox News' Fox and Friends, said Trump's meeting with Putin will be followed by a \"bilateral lunch\" between the two leaders and their respective delegations followed by a news conference.\nPutin will be the first elected Russian leader to visit Alaska for the summit, land that the United States purchased from Moscow for $7.2 million in 1867, according to the National Archives. If everything goes according to plan, this trip will mark Putin's eighth visit to the U.S. during his presidency, a role he has held for more than 20 years across two separate terms since 1999.\nLivestream\nUSA TODAY is scheduled to provide live coverage as Trump meets with Putin in Alaska. You can watch at the embed below or on USA TODAY's YouTube channel.\nWhat might be discussed?\nTrump said there would be \u201cvery severe consequences\u201d if Putin does not agree to end the Ukraine war when they meet and has said his summit with the Russian president would be \"setting the table\" for a possible Putin-Zelenskyy meeting that he might attend as well.\nIn an Aug. 14 interview with conservative talk show host Brian Kilmeade on Fox News Radio, Trump called the meeting a \"chess game\" and predicted there's a \"25% chance\" the meeting could fail to advance peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.\nTrump has raised the idea of a \"land swap\" between Russia and Ukraine, asserting that both countries would have to cede land to each other to end the war. But Zelenskyy has firmly rejected the idea of ceding any land to Russia. \"Ukrainians will not gift their land to the occupier,\" Zelenskyy said in a video posted on X on Aug. 9.\nContributing: Francesca Chambers, Lauren Villagran, Tom Vanden Brook, Joey Garrison, USA TODAY; Reuters.\nKathryn Palmer is a national trending news reporter for USA TODAY.
