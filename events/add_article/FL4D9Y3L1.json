      "summary": "Figure Technology is positioning itself to capture a $2 trillion consumer lending market by integrating AI and blockchain into its home equity loan platform, reporting 29% year‑over‑year growth and a 70% CAGR since mid‑2021. The company plans to use IPO proceeds to expand its loan marketplace, tokenization, and stablecoin initiatives while maintaining a robust licensing framework. Risks highlighted include regulatory scrutiny of algorithmic underwriting and the limited current adoption of blockchain for real‑world assets. The firm’s strategy hinges on accelerating loan approvals and creating a more liquid secondary market for consumer credit.",
