  "title": "Are personal loans considered taxable income?",
  "description": "Personal loans are not typically taxable, because they\u2019re a debt, not income.",
  "content": "\u2022 Since lenders require you to repay a personal loan, they are considered debt and not taxable income.\n\u2022 If a lender forgives some or all of your loan, you may have to pay taxes on the forgiven amount.\n\u2022 The IRS allows taxpayers to deduct interest on personal loan funds used for business purposes. The funds you receive from personal loans are generally not considered taxable income unless the loan is forgiven. However, some scenarios allow you to deduct personal loan interest if used in connection with a business. Understanding how a personal loan affects your taxes can help you file an accurate return and take advantage of deduction benefits. No, a personal loan doesn\u2019t generally qualify as taxable income because it\u2019s a form of debt that must be repaid. Even though you receive all the funds at once, it\u2019s not considered income if you pay it back as agreed. That\u2019s true even if you use the proceeds for personal needs, such as paying for an emergency expense. The IRS typically only considers income taxable if it\u2019s earned from some type of employment, such as a salary or hourly wage. Freelance earnings, self-employment income, tips and bonuses are included in this category. Income made outside of employment, including capital gains on sold assets, some estate or trust distributions and even gambling winnings, is also considered taxable income. The only exception to this rule \u2014 when your personal loan may be taxable \u2014 is if some or all of your loan balance is forgiven or canceled. How cancellation of debt income is taxed If you can\u2019t repay a loan and your lender fully or partially cancels your debt, the IRS considers any amount over $600 taxable income. This is known as cancellation of debt income. It\u2019s important to understand how it works when you file your returns.\n\u2022 You\u2019ll receive a 1099-C tax form. The lender will send you this form if more than $600 of personal loan debt is canceled.\n\u2022 You\u2019ll pay taxes on the canceled amount. Make sure you provide this to your tax professional so the amount can be added to your income for tax calculation purposes.\n\u2022 Check eligibility for forgiveness exceptions. You may not have to report forgiven debt if it\u2019s a gift from a private lender or if the debt is forgiven in the lender\u2019s will. Debt discharged as part of Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy is exempt from this rule. What happens if you don\u2019t report a 1099-C? If you received a 1099-C form following the cancellation of debt, the IRS received the form, too. Failing to report that income could result in penalties and late fee assessments, or you could be subject to an audit of your federal tax return.\n\nIn most cases, personal loans are not tax-deductible. Neither your loan payments nor any interest paid can be deducted if you use the funds for personal uses, like debt consolidation, emergency bills or medical expenses. The same rule applies if you use the money for a major purchase like an RV or boat. Learn more: Find the best rate for a debt consolidation loan You also can\u2019t deduct interest paid on personal loans for home improvement since your home doesn\u2019t secure them. That tax benefit is reserved for borrowers who take out home equity loans or HELOCs to pay for renovations, since the property serves as collateral for those types of loans. A tax deduction reduces the amount of taxes you owe by decreasing the amount of income that\u2019s subject to taxation. Common examples of tax deductions for debt include interest paid on student loans, mortgages and business loans. Amy Loftsgordon, attorney and legal editor at legal publisher Nolo, says that obtaining a personal loan from a bank or online lender typically does not carry tax implications. But, she cautions, that can change if any portion of the loan is cleared in debt settlement. \u201cFor example, say you owe $20,000 on a personal loan and default on the payments,\u201d Loftsgordon says. \u201cYou work out a deal with the lender to accept $15,000 to satisfy the debt. In this situation, the lender agrees to forgive the remaining $5,000. In that case, you\u2019d get a 1099-C Cancellation of Debt form from the lender, and you\u2019d have to report the forgiven debt as income (officially called \u2018cancellation of debt income\u2019). There are a couple of exceptions, like if the debt is discharged in bankruptcy or if you\u2019re considered insolvent.\u201d If your lender permits it and you use any portion of personal loan funds for business expenses, you can deduct the corresponding interest from your taxes. Examples of acceptable business uses include paying for office equipment, a new vehicle used for business or a new company laptop. The IRS allows you to itemize those deductions as long as you can document the funds used for those expenses. \u201cIf you use just part of the loan for business expenses, you should clearly separate and document what portion of the interest relates to the business usage,\u201d Loftsgordon says. From there, deducting the interest requires you to document the purpose, including receipts, and keep a copy of the loan agreement. You\u2019ll also want to show your payment history. This is a very rare case, however, because most lenders don\u2019t allow personal loans to be used for business purposes. Check the lender\u2019s approval requirements before you apply for personal loans for business use. Do I have to report a personal loan on my taxes? In most cases, you don\u2019t have to report a personal loan when you file your taxes if you pay the debt on time and use the funds for general purposes. The exception is if at least $600 of the debt is forgiven and you receive a 1099-C form. Check with a tax professional to determine whether itemizing your expenses is worth it if you used personal loan funds for anything related to your business. The tax laws discussed so far apply to personal loans taken out from a financial institution like a bank or online lender. The rules are slightly different if you get a personal loan from a friend or family member. These informal lending arrangements must meet certain IRS standards to avoid potential tax consequences. The IRS expects a loan from a relative to resemble a loan from a bank. That means it should have repayment and interest terms. If the repayment terms can\u2019t be documented, the funds may be considered a gift. The 2025 gift limit is $19,000 per recipient. If someone gives you more than that in a single year, they must declare the gift by filing IRS Form 709, and the excess will be counted against their lifetime estate and gift exemption. Since the lifetime exemption is $13.99 million, it is highly unlikely the person receiving it will owe any tax on that gift. You generally don\u2019t have to worry about any tax consequences of taking out a personal loan \u2014 since it\u2019s a debt, it\u2019s not considered income. If you\u2019re self-employed, however, you may get some tax benefits if personal loan funds subsidize your business costs. It\u2019s always a good idea to run any tax questions by an accounting professional to cover all your potential tax benefits and consequences.",

      "text": "Can businesses use personal loans?\nKey takeaways\n- Personal loans can be used to cover business expenses, as long as the loan agreement doesn\u2019t exclude business use.\n- Personal loans can be easier to qualify for than business loans because they don\u2019t consider your time in business or business revenue\n- Business loans usually have higher borrowing limits and lower interest rates than personal loans.\nAlthough personal loans are typically only for individual expenses, some lenders allow them to be used for business purposes. This option can be appealing for startups and small businesses that may not yet qualify for traditional business loans.\nIt\u2019s essential to understand the potential risks and limitations of using a personal loan for business, such as lower borrowing limits and the impact on your personal credit. Before moving forward, check your lender\u2019s policy and compare other business financing options, like SBA loans, online business loans, business credit cards and crowdfunding.\nCan you use a personal loan for business?\nYes, in some cases, you can use a personal loan to start a business or make purchases for the company. However, not all personal loan lenders allow their loans to be used for business purposes.\nThe deciding factor is whether the loan agreement specifies that it allows business purchases or that it doesn\u2019t exclude business use in its list of exclusions. To avoid trouble, ask the lender you\u2019re considering whether they have restrictions for businesses before you apply.\nBusiness owners may prefer a personal loan over a business loan because the process is faster and often more convenient than applying for a business loan. When applying for a personal loan, lenders review your credit score and income, and there\u2019s generally little documentation needed other than a few paystubs and identification.\nWhat\u2019s the difference between a business loan and personal loan?\nA business loan is a loan specifically used for business purchases, either for general purchases like operating expenses or specific items like equipment.\nOn the other hand, a personal loan is a loan tied to your personal finances that you can use for nearly any purpose, typically for personal items like consolidating debt. Keep in mind that if you fail to make payments, the lender can go after your personal assets to repay the loan.\nConsider the differences between personal loans and business loans.\n| Business loans | Personal loans |\n| Variety of uses: equipment, real estate, working capital and more. | Can use for most purposes. A clause may forbid you from using the funds to pay off student loans. |\n| -Requires 6 months to 2 years in business -Positive cash flow summary -Down payment -Collateral -Balance sheet report -Good business and personal credit -Business plan |\n-Some lenders may accept poor credit -Proof of income -Low debt-to-income ratio -Positive history of paying on time As long as you have a good history of on-time payments, a personal loan may be easier to obtain than a business loan. |\n| Business loans may be SBA-backed or private. You can choose a type of loan designed for your specific needs, such as term loans, equipment loans or business lines of credit. | Personal loans are typically granted to individuals for things like debt consolidation or home repairs. |\nRequirements for business loans vs. personal loans\nBusiness loans tend to have more requirements for approval than personal loans. Personal loans have a lower barrier to entry, making them ideal if you don\u2019t qualify for a business loan.\nConsider the different factors that lenders look at when approving your loan to decide which option is best for you.\n| Business loan | Personal loan | Importance of each factor | |\n| Time in business | A minimum of 6 months to 2 years in business | Not required | Business loan lenders want to see a history of sustained profitability in the business |\n| Revenue | $100,000 to $200,000 in annual revenue | Uses personal pay stubs to show income | Lenders approve, deny or partially approve loans based on your ability to manage repayments |\n| Loan amounts | Ranges from $5,000 to $5 million | May cap at $50,000 to $100,000 | Lenders may limit the loan amount you qualify for based on your finances |\n| Collateral | Collateral may be required, especially if you have poor credit or low revenue | Can be secured or unsecured, depending on the lender and your personal finances | Collateral reduces risk for the lender and may result in lower interest rates or longer repayment terms |\n| Business plan | A detailed plan can help you get approved and show business profitability | Not required | This plan outlines how you intend to grow your business over the next year or several years. It proves your ability to repay a business loan. |\nCredit score requirements for personal and business loans\nFICO credit score requirements are similar between personal and business loans. With personal loans, the minimum credit score requirement is often 610, but you can secure a personal loan with a lower score. For example, if your credit score is 580, lenders like Upgrade and Avant may approve your loan application.\nBy comparison, credit score requirements for business loans typically start in the 600s . If you want the highest odds of approval and the best interest rate, you\u2019ll need a minimum credit score in the 700s. Typically, online lenders accept lower credit scores than traditional banks and credit unions.\nPersonal lenders largely care only about your personal creditworthiness, while business lenders may look at your personal and business credit scores. They consider your personal credit more if you\u2019re a startup or haven\u2019t established your business credit.\nWhat to consider when choosing a personal or business loan\nIf you\u2019re starting a new business or entering an unfamiliar industry, a personal loan may be easier to qualify for. But personal loan amounts are generally lower than business loans, limiting how much funding you can get. Depending on your industry and startup costs, you may find that a personal loan won\u2019t fully cover what you need like a business loan can. Business loans also tend to offer lower interest rates, which keeps your total borrowing costs minimal.\nIf you can qualify for a business loan, the lower cost and business use of funding makes sense. But if you can\u2019t get a business loan or don\u2019t qualify for the lowest rates, a personal loan offers another option to get the funding your business needs.\nPros to using a personal loan for business\nThere are several pros of using a personal loan for business purposes:\n- Fast funding: Many personal loan lenders offer same-day funding so borrowers can quickly handle business expenses.\n- Lenient lending requirements: Compared to business loans, personal loans are easier to qualify for because lenders won\u2019t scrutinize your previous business experience, your company\u2019s finances or how long it\u2019s been open.\n- No collateral required: Unsecured personal loans don\u2019t require collateral, so you can qualify even if you don\u2019t have valuable assets. However, unsecured business loans can be difficult to qualify for.\n- Reasonable repayment terms: Repayment terms for personal loans can range from two to 10 years.\nCons to using a personal loan for business\nThere are also cons of using a personal loan for business purposes:\n- High interest rate: Personal loan interest rates range from 6.5 percent to 36 percent, but the average rate is 12.58 percent. By comparison, the average interest rate for business term loans range from 7.33 percent to 7.99 percent .\n- Low borrowing limits: Depending on the lender, personal loan amounts are capped at $100,000, while business loan amounts can reach $5 million.\n- No impact on business credit: Payment history for the personal loan has no impact on your business credit. That could be a good thing if you miss payments, but it\u2019s a bad thing if you want to build your business credit.\n- Personal credit score is at risk: Late or missed payments can lower your personal credit and prevent you from getting approved for other types of personal credit, such as credit cards and auto loans.\nHow to get a personal loan for business\nThe application process for a personal loan may be less involved than a business loan since the loan requirements are fewer.\nHere are the steps to securing a personal loan for business use:\n- Confirm your credit score: Understand your credit score\u2019s impact on loan approval, rates and terms. If you\u2019re afraid your score is too low, raise it before applying or consider applying with a co-borrower.\n- Prequalify: Prequalification allows you to discover potential rates and terms without affecting your credit. Compare and assess loan types, rates and terms across lenders to determine which one offers you the best loan terms\n- Apply: After comparing lenders and loan offers, choose a lender and apply. Be prepared to submit the necessary documentation for identity and income verification.\n- Finalize: Upon approval, read through the loan agreement carefully and sign loan documents to receive funds.\nAlternatives to personal loans for businesses\nIf you\u2019re not sure that a personal loan is right for you, consider what other funding options align with your business\u2019s needs and goals. Alternatives to personal loans for businesses include:\nSome of the best small business loans are alternative loans, available from an online lender instead of a traditional bank. These loans often fund within days and may have more accessible requirements than traditional bank loans\nThe bottom line\nWhile securing a business loan to cover various financial obligations would be ideal, that isn\u2019t an option for all businesses. A personal loan could be the answer to your funding troubles because they offer easier qualifications to get approved. However, personal loans may have lower loan amounts and higher interest rates than business loans. Be sure you explore the different types of business financing options before settling on a personal loan for business use.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhy we ask for feedback Your feedback helps us improve our content and services.

      "text": "Common types of bankruptcy and how to avoid filing\nBankruptcy is a legal process to help individuals and businesses manage overwhelming debt. While it provides a path to financial relief, the decision to file bankruptcy requires careful scrutiny due to its lasting impact on credit, assets and future financial opportunities.\nThe two most common types of bankruptcy for individuals are Chapter 7 and Chapter 13, each with its own eligibility criteria and debt repayment structure.\nHow bankruptcy works\nBankruptcy is governed by federal law and overseen by the U.S. bankruptcy courts.\nWhen you file for bankruptcy, you formally declare your inability to pay outstanding debts. In return, you may be granted a fresh start financially. The process can temporarily stop collection activities, such as creditor calls, wage garnishments and foreclosures. However, some debts, like student loans, child support and certain taxes, are generally not dischargeable through bankruptcy.\nFiling for bankruptcy involves its fair share of fees. These include court filing fees, attorney fees and the cost of required credit counseling and debtor education courses. For Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the court filing fee is $338, while Chapter 13 costs $313.\nYou do not need an attorney to file for bankruptcy, but hiring one can make it easier to navigate the process and is highly recommended if you are unfamiliar with bankruptcy law and procedures. Attorney fees vary depending on the case\u2019s complexity but can range from $1,000 to $6,000 or more. Some courts may allow payment plans for court fees, and low-income filers may qualify for a fee waiver.\nCommon types of bankruptcy\nThe two most common types of bankruptcy are Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. They account for 67 percent and 32 percent of all non-business filings, respectively. Each type of bankruptcy serves a different purpose and has unique eligibility requirements, procedures and outcomes.\nChapter 7\nChapter 7 bankruptcy, often called \u201cliquidation bankruptcy,\u201d involves selling non-exempt assets to pay off creditors.\nYou may be allowed to keep some essential property, like a car if the value isn\u2019t deemed excessive and personal belongings such as clothing, household goods or tools you need for work, but exemption laws vary from state to state. Once the available assets are sold, the proceeds go to creditors, and any remaining unsecured debt is typically discharged, meaning you are no longer responsible for paying it. The process usually takes a few months to complete.\nChapter 7 is ideal if you have limited income and few valuable assets, but it remains on your credit report for up to 10 years, affecting your ability to obtain new credit.\nChapter 13\nChapter 13, known as \u201creorganization bankruptcy,\u201d lets you create a repayment plan to repay debts over three to five years. Unlike Chapter 7, this type of bankruptcy allows you to keep your assets while making monthly payments to creditors via a trustee. Once the repayment plan is completed, any remaining eligible debt may be discharged. This option stays on your credit report for up to seven years.\nThe primary difference between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy is how debts are resolved. Chapter 7 provides a faster path to debt relief through asset liquidation and debt discharge, while Chapter 13 requires a longer repayment process but allows you to retain your property.\nWhy people file for bankruptcy\nPeople file for bankruptcy when they face overwhelming debt that they can no longer manage through traditional means.\nLife events like job loss, medical emergencies or divorce can cause a sudden or significant loss of income, making it hard to keep up with financial obligations. Without a steady income, you may fall behind on mortgage payments, car loans and credit card bills, leading to mounting debt. Over time, late fees, interest charges and collection actions can compound the problem, making it nearly impossible to recover without legal intervention. Bankruptcy provides a structured path to financial relief, allowing you to eliminate or restructure debt and stop aggressive collection efforts.\nMedical debt is one of the most common reasons people file for bankruptcy. Unexpected medical expenses can quickly drain savings, especially without adequate health insurance. Even with insurance, high deductibles, copayments and out-of-network charges can leave you with many unpaid bills.\nCredit card debt is another major contributor to bankruptcy filings. People often rely on credit cards to cover living expenses during financial hardship, but high interest rates and fees can cause balances to grow faster than they can be repaid. When these debts grow insurmountable, bankruptcy can offer a way to discharge or reorganize that debt, providing much-needed relief.\nAnother common reason people file for bankruptcy is to stop foreclosure, eviction or repossession of essential assets like a home or vehicle.\nFiling for bankruptcy triggers an \u201cautomatic stay,\u201d a legal order that temporarily halts these collection efforts. This pause allows you to explore repayment options or negotiate new terms with creditors. Chapter 13 bankruptcy, in particular, allows you to catch up on missed payments over time, potentially saving your home or car from being taken away. For many, bankruptcy serves as a last resort to regain control of their financial situation and protect their most important assets.\nPros and cons of bankruptcy\nFiling for bankruptcy is a significant financial decision with benefits and drawbacks. While it can provide immediate relief from debt and a chance for a fresh start, it also carries long-term consequences that affect your credit, access to loans and personal finances.\nUnderstanding the pros and cons of bankruptcy is essential for anyone considering this option. By gaining a clear picture of both sides, you can make a more informed decision about whether bankruptcy is the right path for you.\nPros of bankruptcy\n- Asset protection: Chapter 13 bankruptcy allows you to keep essential assets like a home or car while you work to catch up on missed payments through a repayment plan.\n- Debt discharge: In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, eligible debts such as credit card balances, medical bills and personal loans can be discharged, meaning you are no longer legally required to pay them.\n- Financial education: Many filers are required to complete financial literacy courses, equipping them with the tools to make better financial decisions in the future.\n- Immediate debt relief: Filing for bankruptcy triggers an automatic stay, halting creditor calls, wage garnishments, foreclosures and repossessions. This provides immediate relief from collection activities.\n- Structured debt repayment: Chapter 13 bankruptcy creates a court-supervised repayment plan lasting three to five years, giving you a clear path to financial recovery.\nCons of bankruptcy\n- Damage to credit score: Bankruptcy has a long-term impact on credit. Chapter 7 remains on your credit report for 10 years and Chapter 13 stays for 7 years, affecting access to future credit and loans for buying a house or new car.\n- Debt exclusions: Some debts cannot be discharged through bankruptcy. If you owe student loans, child support, alimony and certain types of tax debt, you\u2019ll still be responsible for these payments.\n- Higher borrowing costs: After bankruptcy, obtaining loans or credit cards may be more difficult. When credit is available, it often comes with higher interest rates and stricter borrowing terms.\n- Loss of assets: In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, non-exempt property (like vacation homes, second vehicles or valuable collectibles) may be sold to pay creditors.\n- Time and cost: The bankruptcy process can be lengthy, requiring months or even years to complete. It also involves legal fees, court filing fees and the potential need to hire an attorney.\nHow to avoid filing for bankruptcy\nFiling for bankruptcy should be a last resort, as it has lasting consequences on credit and financial opportunities. Fortunately, you can take proactive steps to avoid bankruptcy and regain control of your finances.\nBudget\nOne of the most effective strategies is to create a detailed budget that tracks income, expenses and debt payments. Free up funds to pay down debt by identifying areas where spending can be reduced. Prioritizing high-interest debts, such as credit cards, can prevent balances from growing due to compounding interest, and setting up an emergency fund can prevent future financial crises from pushing you toward bankruptcy.\nNegotiate\nAnother strategy to avoid bankruptcy is to negotiate with creditors. Many creditors are willing to work with borrowers to create a repayment plan or modify loan terms. Options like debt consolidation or refinancing can simplify payments and lower interest rates, making debt more manageable.\nCredit counseling agencies can assist in negotiating with creditors, providing expert guidance on repayment strategies. These agencies can also help you enroll in debt management plans, which may allow for reduced monthly payments and waived fees.\nProfessional help\nSeeking professional financial guidance can be a game changer when bankruptcy feels imminent.\nNonprofit credit counseling agencies and financial advisors offer advice on managing debt, cutting expenses and setting up payment plans. Financial counselors can review your financial situation and recommend alternatives to bankruptcy, such as debt settlement or debt consolidation loans. Additionally, legal consultation with a bankruptcy attorney can clarify your options, rights and potential consequences.\nBy taking early action, seeking professional help and exploring alternatives, you can avoid the lasting impact of bankruptcy and establish a path to long-term financial stability.\nThe bottom line\nBankruptcy is a legal option designed to provide financial relief to those facing overwhelming debt, but it comes with significant consequences that can impact credit, asset ownership and financial opportunities for years.\nThe most common types of bankruptcy for individuals are Chapter 7 and Chapter 13, each with unique eligibility requirements and outcomes. While Chapter 7 offers a fast track to debt discharge, it may require liquidating certain assets. Chapter 13 allows for a structured repayment plan over time, helping individuals retain valuable property like a home or car.\nIf you\u2019re struggling with debt, filing for bankruptcy is not your only option. Taking early action can help you avoid bankruptcy altogether. Creating a budget, negotiating with creditors and working with credit counseling agencies are all viable alternatives that can lead to debt reduction and financial stability.\nIf bankruptcy still seems like the best course of action, consult with a bankruptcy attorney or financial advisor to fully understand your rights and responsibilities. Proper guidance can ensure you choose the best path to your financial future. No matter your situation, resources are available to help you regain control of your finances and move toward a debt-free lifestyle.\nWhy we ask for feedback Your feedback helps us improve our content and services.

      "text": "How to pay for home improvements\nKey takeaways\n- Prequalify with multiple lenders to get the best terms when looking into different loan options for your next home improvement project.\n- Financing a home project takes planning, so consider every financing option before committing to one.\n- If possible, the best way to pay for a home improvement project is to save up and pay out-of-pocket to avoid taking on large amounts of debt.\nThinking ahead about financing your home project is essential to avoid added costs and future financial problems. While saving up for a specific project is the best way to pay for a home upgrade, it isn\u2019t always possible. Instead, you may need to fund your project another way.\nThere are multiple home improvement financing options, including home improvement loans, home equity products, credit cards and government loans. The right one for you will depend on your project and financial goals.\nAverage cost of a home improvement\nThe average cost of a home renovation is $52,283, though it can range from $19,492 to $88,406, according to Angi. Keep in mind that, while this figure is the national average, every home improvement project can fluctuate greatly based on the size and location of your home, type of project and timing. However, even smaller, low-cost improvements can still be pricey thanks to inflation.\nInflation is at one of its highest points in decades, making everything \u2014 including home improvements \u2014 more expensive. And it\u2019s causing homeowners to rethink their projects. Among homeowners who postponed or canceled a home improvement, repair or maintenance project in 2023, an average of 61 percent did so because of budget or financial concerns, according to Home Improvement Research Institute\u2019s Monthly Homeowner Activities and Sentiments Tracker.\n7 best ways to finance home improvements\nHome improvement projects can be expensive and often require financing. For many homeowners, building up your savings will be the least expensive option. But if you need to make emergency repairs or cover a large expense, options like a loan or line of credit may be more appropriate.\n1. Savings\nThe best way to pay for your home renovation is to save and pay with cash. However, saving money has one major drawback \u2014 it takes time. When you pay cash instead of financing, you may have to wait years to cover a large project.\nThe amount you need to save depends on the type of renovation and the project\u2019s scope. If you want to finance the whole project by saving, start small with less expensive projects. This can help you avoid spending more than you intended.\nBenefits\n- No additional debt\n- No accruing interest\n- Avoid credit checks and missed payments\n- Less chance of overspending\nDrawbacks\n- Potentially longer timeline\n- May not work for emergency repairs or renovations\n- Less cash available for other needs\n- No positive impact on credit score\n2. Home improvement loans\nHome improvement loans are unsecured personal loans offered by banks, credit unions and a number of online lenders. Because the loans are unsecured, you don\u2019t need to use your house as collateral to qualify. If you qualify, funding comes quickly, within as little as a few days.\nAs unsecured loans, home improvement loans typically have higher rates than secured loans. However, unlike secured loans, you don\u2019t risk losing your home or property if you default. They are also typically easier to apply for.\nThe maximum home improvement loan amount you can borrow is $100,000 \u2014 but most lenders have much lower caps. The minimum you can borrow may be as low as $1,000, making them good for small or mid-sized projects.\nBenefits\n- Funding within a few days\n- Little-to-no additional fees\n- No risk of foreclosure or home loss\n- Good for mid-sized projects\nDrawbacks\n- Potentially high interest rates\n- Short loan terms with potentially high monthly payments\n- Qualification depends on credit and personal finances\n- Potential to overspend\n3. Home equity line of credit (HELOC)\nA HELOC is a secured loan backed by the equity in your home. It acts as a revolving line of credit, so you can borrow what you need when you need it \u2014 up to your credit limit. Because a HELOC is secured by your home, you can qualify for lower interest rates than you would with an unsecured personal loan.\nKeep in mind that most HELOC interest rates are variable, which means your payments can increase depending on market conditions. And because HELOCs use your home as collateral, you risk foreclosure if you are unable to repay.\nBenefits\n- Flexible repayment options for up to 30 years\n- Interest may be tax deductible\n- Lower interest rates than other financing options\n- Higher borrowing amounts for bigger projects\nDrawbacks\n- Variable interest rates may increase\n- Higher potential to overspend with a line of credit\n- Must have at least 15 percent equity in your home\n- Risk of foreclosure if you default\nBankrate staff insights\n4. Home equity loan\nA 2024 home equity insights survey by Bankrate found that 55 percent of current homeowners consider home improvements or repairs a good reason to tap into home equity. If you want to access your existing equity but don\u2019t need revolving credit, you could apply for a home equity loan, also known as a second mortgage. This loan is paid out in a lump sum that you can repay over a number of years in regular fixed monthly payments.\nHome equity loans typically allow you to borrow more than a standard home improvement loan. Like a HELOC, a home equity loan uses your home as collateral, so stay current with payments to avoid default and foreclosure.\nBenefits\n- Fixed interest rates with predictable monthly payments\n- Interest may be tax deductible\n- Over-spending is more difficult than with a credit line\nDrawbacks\n- Higher credit score needed to qualify for the best rates\n- Risk of foreclosure if you default\n- Potential for underwater mortgage if property value declines\n5. Cash-out refinance\nA cash-out refinance replaces your current mortgage with a new, larger loan. It also allows you to keep the difference between the new amount and what you owe. You can then use this money for home improvements.\nA cash-out refinance is a good option for homeowners who qualify for a better rate than their existing mortgage and don\u2019t want an additional monthly loan payment.\nBenefits\n- Adjust your loan term or switch to a fixed rate\n- No additional monthly payment\n- Potential to secure a lower interest rate\nDrawbacks\n- Mortgage debt increases\n- Additional costs, including appraisal and closing costs\n- Could increase interest rate and monthly payment\n6. Credit cards\nIf you\u2019re making minor updates to your home, using your credit card for home improvements might be one of the best financing options. That said, credit cards have notoriously high interest rates, so it\u2019s important to have a plan to pay off your balance before you start spending.\nIf you qualify for a 0 percent introductory APR card, you could avoid interest if you pay back the balance by the end of the introductory period. This is in addition to the rewards options offered by many credit card companies.\nBenefits\n- Potential to earn cashback perks and other credit card rewards\n- Borrow money as you need it\n- 0% APR cards can save you thousands in interest\nDrawbacks\n- High interest rates\n- Potential to get in a cycle of debt\n- Multiple credit cards may be difficult to keep up with\nBankrate staff insights\n7. Government loans\nGovernment loans can provide savings on borrowing costs, like interest and insurance. They are need- and location-based, but they tend to have lower interest rates and better terms than regular loans. This is because the government insures the lender against potential loss.\nA HUD Title I Property Improvement Loan lets you borrow up to $25,000 without any home equity. They can be a good option if you\u2019ve recently purchased your home and need to make upgrades \u2014 provided your loan goes to approved renovations, not luxury upgrades.\nThere are also VA cash-out refinance loans for individuals who meet lender and VA guidelines, including being an active-duty service member, veteran or surviving spouse. For those who qualify, a VA loan could provide funds that can be used for home improvements, among other purposes.\nBenefits\n- Work with a government-approved lender\n- Loans are backed by the government\n- People with less-than-stellar credit or a thin credit history may qualify\nDrawbacks\n- Funds must be used to increase the property\u2019s livability\n- More stringent eligibility requirements\n- Loan amounts may be limited\nChoosing the best home renovation financing option\nYou may have many options when it comes to paying for your project, but not all of them will fit your goals. Consider the time, cost and scope of the project in addition to your finances when determining the best way to pay for home improvements.\n- Time: If you have some time before you need to get the project done, create a plan to save for all \u2014 or some \u2014 of the cost. Saving ahead of time will help you cut down on the interest you pay.\n- Cost and scope of the project: Estimating cost and scope can help you determine what kind of financing you need. Smaller improvements may only need a small personal loan, while larger projects may need a home equity loan.\n- Financial situation: Your credit score, debt-to-income (DTI) ratio and available home equity can impact your loan amount and interest rate. Before you apply, know your credit score and review your budget to make sure you can afford an additional monthly payment.\n- Financial goals: Any home improvement financing will mean taking on additional debt. If you want to avoid an additional monthly payment, build your savings or consider a cash-out refinance.\n- Current interest rates: If you purchased a home or refinanced when rates were low, a cash-out refinance may not be the best option since you\u2019ll get a higher interest rate. However, if your new interest rate will be lower than your current one, a cash-out refinance may be a great option for receiving funds and saving money.\nBottom line\nFinancing a home project takes planning. Choose the best financing path for your project and financial situation. When looking into different home improvement loan options, compare lenders to get the best terms and look for offers that will benefit you most down the road.\nWhy we ask for feedback Your feedback helps us improve our content and services.

      "text": "Personal loan documents to gather before you apply\nKey takeaways\n- Most personal loan lenders require documents to prove your identity, income, bank account and address.\n- Lenders collect information about your credit score, loan purpose and monthly expenses to determine your eligibility and loan terms.\n- Gathering all necessary documents and information before applying for a personal loan may help you receive your funds faster.\nWhen you apply for a personal loan, lenders request several documents to verify your personal and financial information before making a lending decision. While each lender has unique application and eligibility requirements, most will require similar documentation.\nKnowing which documents you need and having them ready before you apply may increase your chances of approval and help you receive your funds more quickly.\n1. Application form\nAll lenders require you to fill out an application form to be approved for a loan. If you\u2019re borrowing from an online lender, the process is done entirely online. If you apply for a personal loan with your local bank or credit union, you may be able to complete the application in person with a bank representative.\nThe application will likely look slightly different from one lender to another, but will usually ask for information such as:\n- Your full name\n- Contact information\n- Address history\n- Date of birth\n- Social Security number\nYou\u2019ll need to choose a loan amount, answer questions about the purpose of your loan and provide financial details about your monthly income, bills and debt obligations.\n2. Proof of identity\nLenders must verify your identity to approve your loan. Two forms of identification are usually required, and acceptable documents may include your:\n- Birth certificate\n- Certificate of citizenship\n- Driver\u2019s license\n- Military ID\n- Passport\n- Social Security card\n- State-issued ID\nThe lender needs to be able to read your identification \u2014 take a clear picture with your smartphone or use a scanner to avoid delays.\n3. Employer and income verification\nPersonal loan lenders rely on your income to determine how much you qualify for. Because you aren\u2019t required to put up collateral to back an unsecured personal loan, you must prove that you have a steady stream of verifiable income to be approved.\nIf you\u2019re traditionally employed, you can verify your income with a few documents, including:\n- Pay stubs\n- Tax returns\n- W-2s and 1099s\n- Bank statements\n- Employer\u2019s contact information\nIf you\u2019re self-employed, you may need any or all of the following documents:\n- Bank statements\n- 1099s for the past two years\n- Tax returns for the past two years\nIf you work for a regular employer, you may be able to access your pay stubs and tax forms through your payroll provider\u2019s online database. You can also contact your human resources or payroll department for assistance. Self-employed applicants may need to work with a CPA or other tax professional for help gathering the required tax forms.\n4. Proof of address\nYou must supply proof of your current address and information about how long you\u2019ve lived there. You may not qualify if you\u2019ve moved around a lot or just relocated to a new area \u2014 if you\u2019ve recently moved, you may have to provide information about your previous address as well. While some lenders may require specific documentation, you can usually use one of the following:\n- Utility bill\n- Lease or rental agreement\n- Mortgage statement\n- Proof of insurance on your home or vehicle\n- Voter registration card\n- Property tax receipt\n- Bank or credit card statement\nIf you need to confirm a change of address, the U.S. Postal Service offers resources to assist you. While the fastest and easiest way to do this is online, you can also visit your local post office and complete the form in person.\n5. Bank account information\nMost lenders will deposit your loan funds directly into your account, so you must provide your bank account information. You may also be required to set up an automatic payment through your bank to get the best personal loan rates.\nIf you apply with your current financial institution, they\u2019ll have your information handy. If you choose to work with a new lender, have the following ready:\n- Name of bank\n- Routing number\n- Checking account number\n- Your user ID and password to your account (to verify your account through the lender\u2019s secure system)\nLenders will often request that you link your bank account to a secure system to grant the lender \u201cread-only\u201d access to your account. This means they can see and verify your account, but can\u2019t perform any transactions. This is a standard and safe method of verification\nYou can opt out of this, but you\u2019ll need to verify your account by accepting small withdrawals and confirming the specific amounts. This option could delay your loan funds for several business days, but may be a good option if you don\u2019t want to give the lender any sort of access to your account.\nOther information lenders use to approve your loan\nOnce you apply, lenders will consider several factors when approving your loan and determining what rate to offer you.\n- Credit score\n- Loan purpose\n- Monthly expenses\n- Debt-to-income ratio\nTo improve your chances of approval and ensure a smooth application process, check your credit score and review your credit reports before applying. This way, you can take steps to improve your score if needed and avoid unnecessary applications.\nYou may boost your eligibility by paying down credit card debt, disputing errors on your credit reports and adding a creditworthy cosigner.\nWhat if you don\u2019t have the required loan documents?\nYou may not be completely out of luck. Depending on what\u2019s missing, the lender may offer alternative verification methods.\nFor example, if you don\u2019t have pay stubs handy, the lender may contact your employer directly to confirm income information or review your bank statements for proof of electronic deposits. If your income is directly deposited, some lenders can confirm your income information through your bank.\nThat said, not having the required documents could lead to delays or outright denial. Be sure to notify the lender right away if you\u2019re missing documents to determine whether there are ways to work around the issue.\nHere are three tips to consider if your personal loan application is denied:\n- Get a cosigner, like a friend or family member who is willing to assume legal responsibility for the loan with you.\n- Choose a bad credit personal loan or a secured personal loan backed by collateral like a boat, car, home or RV.\n- Improve your credit score by paying down credit cards to lower your credit utilization ratio.\nBankrate staff insights\nBottom line\nGathering the information and documents you\u2019ll need before applying for a personal loan can save you time and avoid potential funding delays. Make sure all your paperwork is legible and provide documents as quickly as possible to speed up the process.\nNot all lenders have the same requirements, so ensure you are aware of the general documentation criteria before applying. By being prepared, you can increase your chances of approval and receive your funds more quickly.\nWhy we ask for feedback Your feedback helps us improve our content and services.

      "text": "What is a 1099-C Cancellation of Debt form?\nKey takeaways\n- You will receive a 1099-C Cancelation of Debt form if a lender forgives more than $600 of taxable debt.\n- You must include the amount of canceled debt on your federal tax return as a part of your taxable income.\n- Some instances warrant the exclusion of forgiven debt from your return, including monetary gifts and some qualified student loans.\nGetting out of debt is a significant achievement. Whether it\u2019s overcoming credit card balances, student loans or mortgage debts, the relief of financial freedom is often accompanied by newfound opportunities and plans for the future.\nHowever, if you\u2019ve recently had a debt canceled, it\u2019s essential to understand the tax implications of that victory.\nEnter Form 1099-C, the \u201cCancelation of Debt\u201d form. This document is crucial for reporting canceled debts to the IRS, and it\u2019s important for consumers who have worked hard to become debt-free or pay down their debt to know what it entails.\nWhat is Form 1099-C?\nForm 1099-C is a tax form that creditors must file when they cancel a $600 or more debt.\nFor example, if you negotiate a debt settlement on your credit cards, you might have some of your credit card debt forgiven. That counts as a debt cancelation, and you should expect a 1099-C cancelation of debt form in the mail.\nYou might also have debts canceled if your student loans are forgiven, if your mortgage is modified or even if your home goes into foreclosure. These canceled debts could generate a 1099-C form, meaning you might have to pay debt forgiveness or settlement tax.\nWhen is canceled debt taxable?\nThe IRS generally treats canceled debt as taxable income, which means if a creditor forgives a portion of your debt, you are typically required to report it on your tax return.\nHere are key points to consider regarding the taxability of canceled debt:\n- If a creditor cancels a debt, that amount is usually considered income, which could increase your tax bill for that year.\n- If your debt was canceled as part of a bankruptcy discharge, that amount is not taxable. This is an important consideration for consumers who may have sought bankruptcy relief to regain financial stability.\n- If you were financially insolvent at the time the debt was canceled (meaning your total liabilities exceeded your total assets), you might not owe tax on the canceled debt. To claim this exclusion, you would need to file Form 982 with your tax return.\nUnderstanding whether your canceled debt is taxable is vital for your financial planning \u2014 especially if you\u2019ve recently worked hard to get out of debt.\nExclusions for tax on canceled debt\nThe IRS has some 1099 debt forgiveness exclusions \u2014 which means if your debt falls into an excepted or excluded category, you do not have to include it as ordinary income on your tax return.\nSome common exceptions to the debt cancellation rule include:\n- Amounts canceled as gifts, bequest or inheritances.\n- Certain qualified student loans.\n- Certain education loan repayment or loan forgiveness programs to help provide health. services in certain areas.\n- Canceled debt that would be deductible if you paid it.\n- A qualified purchase price reduction on a property.\n- Any amounts discharged from certain federal, private or educational student loans.\nThere are also some common debts that the IRS states can be excluded from your gross income, including:\n- Debt canceled in a Title 11 bankruptcy case.\n- Debt canceled to the extent insolvent.\n- Cancelation of qualified farm or residential property indebtedness.\n- Cancelation of qualified real property business indebtedness.\n- Cancelation of qualified principal residence indebtedness that is discharged subject to an arrangement that is entered into and evidenced in writing before Jan. 1, 2026.\nIf your debts cannot be canceled and you do not qualify for a payment plan with the IRS, you may want to consider a debt consolidation loan or debt relief. Note that the cost of an IRS plan is likely much less than you would pay using a third-party option.\nWhen should you file Form 1099-C?\nIf your debts have been recently canceled, it\u2019s important to understand when Form 1099-C is filed. This form must be submitted by creditors when they cancel a debt of $600 or more.\n- Timing: Creditors are required to issue Form 1099-C for the tax year in which the debt was canceled. For example, if a debt was forgiven in 2024, the creditor must file the form by Jan. 31, 2025, and you should receive your copy by the same date.\n- IRS submission deadlines: Along with providing you with a copy, creditors must also submit Form 1099-C to the IRS by the end of February (or March 31 if filed electronically) for that same tax year.\nAs a consumer, being aware of these deadlines can help you prepare for your tax return and avoid any potential penalties related to late or missed filings.\nHow do you file Form 1099-C?\nHere\u2019s a guide on how to approach Form 1099-C and what information is typically included on the form.\nInformation included on Form 1099-C\nHere\u2019s a quick breakdown of the information included on the Form 1099-C, in addition to your name and address:\n- Line 1: Date of identifiable event: This line indicates the date when the earliest identifiable event occurred or the date when the debt was discharged.\n- Line 2: Amount of debt discharged: Line 2 displays the total amount of debt that has been discharged. If you believe this amount is incorrect, reach out to the creditor for clarification.\n- Line 3: Interest included in Line 2: This line shows any interest that is included in the debt amount reported in Line 2.\n- Line 4: Description of debt: Line 4 provides a description of the debt. If Line 7 is filled out, it will also include a description of the associated property.\n- Line 5: Check here if personally liable: Line 5 indicates whether you were personally responsible for repaying the debt at the time it was created or last modified, if applicable.\n- Line 6: Identifiable event code: This line contains the code that explains the reason for the creditor filing the form.\n- Line 7: Fair market value of property: If a foreclosure or property abandonment occurred within the same year in relation to the canceled debt, Line 7 will reflect the fair market value. If not, you will receive a separate 1099-A form.\nWhat to do with your 1099-C\nTake the following steps when you receive Form 1099-C to ensure compliance with tax regulations:\n- Review the form: Carefully check the accuracy of the information on the form. If there are discrepancies, you should contact the creditor to resolve them.\n- Determine taxability: Canceled debt is generally taxable, but debtors can claim exclusions for bankruptcy, insolvency or certain types of student loan forgiveness. Consult a tax professional to understand eligibility for exclusions.\n- Report on tax return: When filing your tax return, you must report the canceled debt. Generally, this information goes on Schedule 1 of Form 1040. If claiming exclusions, complete Form 982 to formally exclude the canceled debt from taxable income.\n- Maintain documentation: Keep a copy of Form 1099-C and any related documents for future reference, especially in case of an audit.\nThe bottom line\nFor consumers who have recently had debt discharged, understanding Form 1099-C is vital. While achieving debt freedom is a significant milestone, it comes with tax implications.\nKnowing when canceled debt is taxable and about available exclusions can help you manage your financial situation effectively.\nIf you have questions or concerns about how canceled debt affects your taxes, consider consulting a tax professional for personalized guidance. Your hard work in overcoming debt deserves to be celebrated, and with proper planning, you can enjoy your financial freedom without unnecessary tax burdens.\nFrequently asked questions\nWhy we ask for feedback Your feedback helps us improve our content and services.

It stands out for its 24-hour loan center, speeding up the loan approval and closing process for borrowers. It works with applicants in most states and some U.S. territories.\nCan you a get a mortgage entirely online?\nYes, it is possible to get a mortgage entirely online. The traditional lending process requires borrowers to visit a branch in-person and apply for a mortgage there. However, online lenders allow borrowers to shop for a mortgage, complete the application, upload documents and respond to underwriting queries all online. Some lenders even offer e-closings.\nHow to find the best online mortgage lender for you\nMany borrowers gravitate to online mortgage lenders for their convenience, efficiency and speed. These are important factors to consider when looking for the best online mortgage lender, but it\u2019s also crucial to compare costs for your individual situation, and take the time to read mortgage lender reviews to learn what to expect from the online experience. When comparing digital lenders, look for:\n- The kinds of loans they offer\n- Credit and down payment requirements\n- Origination fees\n- Rate locks and other perks\n- What support options are available\nKeep in mind that these days, even more traditional lenders typically have online capabilities, as well.\nDoes an online mortgage lender have lower rates?\nSome online lenders might advertise lower mortgage rates than their brick-and-mortar competition because they have less overhead. However, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ll get a lower annual percentage rate (or APR) \u2014 the cost of the interest rate plus fees. The rate you\u2019re offered often has more to do with your credit and financial profile and prevailing market trends, as well as your mortgage repayment term. For example, 30-year mortgage rates tend to be higher than those for 15-year loans. It can pay off to shop around with at least three different mortgage lenders, online or otherwise.\nPros and cons of online mortgage lenders\nGetting a mortgage is one of the most consequential decisions of your life \u2014 in some cases, you might be paying back the same loan for the next 30 years. With that in mind, it\u2019s important to understand the advantages and drawbacks of opting for an all-online mortgage experience.\nPros of online mortgage lenders\n- Speed: Many online mortgage lenders use proprietary systems and tools to help expedite the loan approval and underwriting process.\n- Often charge fewer fees: Some online mortgage lenders forgo fees, which can save you money at closing.\n- Potentially lower rates: Some online mortgage lenders run less expensive operations, which could translate to lower interest rates.\nCons of online mortgage lenders\n- Limited loan options: If you\u2019re looking for a USDA loan, to refinance or obtain something other than a conventional mortgage, you might be disappointed \u2014 some online mortgage lenders only specialize in just a few types of loans.\n- Lack of in-person support: While many online mortgage lenders do offer phone-based customer assistance, applying for a mortgage can be an overwhelming process. If you want to be able to speak to a representative in person, you\u2019re better off with a lender that has branch locations.\n- Might not work for unique circumstances: While algorithms can help speed along the process for a borrower with an easy-to-understand financial situation \u2014 a standard W-2 employee with a steady paycheck, for example \u2014 they aren\u2019t great if your finances are more complicated.\nNext steps to apply for an online mortgage\nStep 1: Strengthen your credit score \u2013 Before applying for a loan, take a hard look at your credit history and work to improve your score by paying down outstanding balances. Also, resist taking on any more debt and/or applying for any other loans or lines of credit.\nStep 2: Set a budget \u2013 It\u2019s important to understand how much house you can afford before you go shopping. Note that you may be preapproved for more money than what you can comfortably afford.\nStep 3: Understand your mortgage options \u2013 There are a few different types of mortgages. Know what they are and which one you want.\nStep 4: Compare several lenders \u2013 Rate-shop with at least three different lenders to get the best deal on rates, fees and terms. It\u2019s not just about the rate, though: Do your research and read customer reviews of those mortgage lenders to see what other borrowers have to say about their experience.\nStep 5: Get preapproved for a mortgage \u2013 Apply for mortgage preapproval with several lenders to compare offers and get accurate loan pricing for your specific situation. Preapproval shows sellers that you\u2019re a serious shopper and that you have the financial backing to bid on a home.\nFAQs\n-\nAn online mortgage is a home loan originated by a lender based either entirely on the web, with a digital end-to-end experience from application to closing, or a brick-and-mortar company with in-person locations and online services. While several big banks have built out their capabilities to include a digital mortgage platform, many mortgages are also being originated by non-bank institutions, like LoanDepot and Rocket Mortgage.\n-\nWith an online mortgage, all or many of the steps in the lending process can be completed electronically, whether through an app or online portal. These steps might include: preapproval or prequalification; application and document upload; loan processing and underwriting; and closing (sometimes called an e-closing). By streamlining these steps \u2014 and, in the case of a digital lender, having no offices and overhead \u2014 online mortgages tend to have lower rates and overall costs.\n-\nThe best mortgage option depends on your needs and qualifications as a borrower. Both online lenders and banks can offer distinct advantages, so it\u2019s difficult to determine which is the better option. Online lenders stand out for offering convenience and quick results for borrowers.\n-\nGenerally, yes. You can get an FHA loan through many online lenders with a minimum credit score of 580 and 3.5 percent down, or a credit score as low as 500 if you put 10 percent down. Most conventional loans with online lenders require a minimum credit score of 620. (If your credit situation includes unique challenges such as a past bankruptcy or a recent divorce, be prepared to explain the situation to your loan officer.)\n-\nTo determine the best mortgage refinance lenders, Bankrate periodically evaluates more than 75 lenders for factors relating to affordability, availability and borrower experience, assigning each a Bankrate Score out of five stars. The best online mortgage lenders generally have a Bankrate Score of 4.6 stars or higher.
