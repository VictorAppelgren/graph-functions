  "content": "\"Boar\u2019s Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality,\" the company said.\n\nBoar\u2019s Head plans to reopen a meat packaging plant in Jarratt, Virginia, that was the source of a listeria outbreak in 2024 that sickened dozens of people and killed 10. The company had closed the plant indefinitely after liverwurst packaged there had been linked to the deaths.\n\nA shocking report from the New York Times shortly after the Boar\u2019s Head recall explained that the plant had evidence of meat that was exposed to wet ceilings, extensive rust, and the presence of green mold. But last month, the USDA lifted a suspension on the Virginia plant\u2019s ability to operate after the Food Safety and Inspection Service was provided evidence it could operate safely, according to the Post.\n\nThe Associated Press published a new article last week that Boar\u2019s Head plants in other states had experienced sanitation problems similar to the ones found at the Jarratt plant in 2024 before the listeria outbreak. The AP obtained information through freedom of information requests about Boar\u2019s Head plants in three states, which found evidence of \u201cmeat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn\u2019t wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons.\u201d\n\nThe USDA noncompliance reports obtained by the AP come from Jan. 1 to July 23 of this year, and also note that staff sometimes didn\u2019t wash their hands. The Boar\u2019s Head plants are located in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia. And the AP spoke with food safety experts who said they were \u201csurprised\u201d that Boar\u2019s Head seemingly hadn\u2019t fixed its sanitation problems after such a deadly outbreak.\n\nAfter the listeria outbreak in 2024, Boar\u2019s Head said it would create a \u201cBoar\u2019s Head Food Safety Council\u201d comprised of \u201cindependent industry-leading food safety experts,\u201d according to a press release from last year. But the company has seemed to be less than willing to talk about problems at its facilities, even cancelling an interview with the AP, according to the news service. The AP was supposed to talk with Natalie Dyenson, Boar\u2019s Head\u2019s new food safety officer, but that didn\u2019t happen.\n\nThe New York Times has characterized Boar\u2019s Head as \u201csecretive,\u201d given the fact that the company\u2019s own chief financial officer couldn\u2019t name the CEO during a deposition in 2022. The privately held company does billions of dollars in annual revenue, but the two families that run it, the Brunckhorsts and the Bischoffs, are \u201cintensely guarded,\u201d as the Times put it.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when the Jarratt plant may reopen. But a spokesperson for Boar\u2019s Head told Gizmodo in an emailed statement that the company had recently made \u201cenhancements.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoar\u2019s Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols, which you can read about at https://boarshead.com/food-safety,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cWe have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to re-open our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months.\u201d\n\nThe USDA didn\u2019t immediately respond to questions about the reopening of the plant on Friday afternoon. Gizmodo will update this article if we hear back.",

      "text": "Boar\u2019s Head plans to reopen troubled deli meat plant, but reports of sanitation problems persist\nBoar\u2019s Head plans to reopen troubled deli meat plant, but reports of sanitation problems persist\nThe Boar\u2019s Head deli meat plant at the heart of last year\u2019s deadly food poisoning outbreak is set to reopen in the coming months, company officials said.\nBut recent inspections at Boar\u2019s Head sites in three states documented sanitation problems similar to those that led to the listeria contamination that killed 10 people and sickened dozens.\nThe Jarratt, Virginia, plant was shut down in September when U.S. Agriculture Department officials suspended operations and withdrew the federal marks of inspection required to operate, saying the company \u201cfailed to maintain sanitary conditions.\u201d Boar\u2019s Head permanently stopped making liverwurst and recalled more than 7 million pounds of deli products.\nUSDA officials this week said they had \u201cthoroughly reviewed\u201d the plant and lifted the forced suspension on July 18.\n\u201cThe facility is in full compliance of the guidelines and protocols set for the safe handling and production of food and the serious issues that led to suspension have been fully rectified,\u201d officials with the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service said in an email Wednesday.\nAnd yet, documents obtained by The Associated Press through a freedom of information request show that Boar\u2019s Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana and elsewhere in Virginia were flagged for the same kinds of sanitation problems that led to the outbreak, with the most recent report in June.\nIn the past seven months, government inspectors reported problems that include instances of meat and fat residue left on equipment and walls, drains blocked with meat products, beaded condensation on ceilings and floors, overflowing trash cans, and staff who didn\u2019t wear protective hairnets and plastic aprons \u2014 or wash their hands.\nThe records, which included USDA noncompliance reports logged by inspectors from Jan. 1 through July 23, raise new questions about the company\u2019s promises to address systemic problems and about federal oversight of listeria contamination in plants that make ready-to-eat foods.\n\u201cIf there is evidence that food safety problems are continuing, the government needs to make sure the company fixes them,\u201d said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer group focused on food safety.\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins last month announced plans to bolster efforts that combat foodborne germs, including listeria.\nJobs posted in Virginia\nOfficials at Boar\u2019s Head, the 120-year-old company based in Sarasota, Florida, have posted job openings for two dozen positions, including a food safety quality analyst, at the Jarratt site.\nThe company convened a panel of expert advisers last fall and hired a chief food safety officer in May. The advisers include Frank Yiannas, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration official, and Mindy Brashears, President Donald Trump\u2019s nominee for USDA\u2019s undersecretary for food safety.\nBoar\u2019s Head last year said they \u201cregret and deeply apologize\u201d for the contamination and that \u201ccomprehensive measures are being implemented to prevent such an incident from ever happening again.\u201d\nHave a news tip?\nContact AP\u2019s global investigative team at [email protected]. For secure and confidential communications, use the free Signal app +1 (202) 281-8604.\nBut company officials refused to discuss the problems found this year. They canceled a scheduled AP interview with Natalie Dyenson, the new food safety officer. And they declined to allow Yiannas to detail the investigation he led into the contamination\u2019s cause.\nBrashears, who now directs a food safety center at Texas Tech University, did not respond to requests for comment about the Boar\u2019s Head problems. An automatic email reply said the USDA nominee was traveling out of the country until Aug. 25. She remains on the company\u2019s food safety board.\n\u201cBoar\u2019s Head has an unwavering commitment to food safety and quality. That commitment is reflected in recent enhancements to our practices and protocols\u201d described on the company\u2019s website, Boar\u2019s Head said in an emailed statement.\n\u201cWe have also been working with the USDA in developing a plan to reopen our Jarratt facility in a measured, deliberate way in the coming months,\u201d the statement said.\nInadequate sanitation practices\nThe 35 pages of new inspection findings cover Boar\u2019s Head sites in Forrest City, Arkansas; New Castle, Indiana; and Petersburg, Virginia.\nThey surprised outside food safety advocates, who said that factory conditions should have improved in the year since the outbreak was first identified.\n\u201cYou would have expected after all they went through that they would put themselves in a place where you could essentially eat deli meat off the factory floor,\u201d said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports, an advocacy group.\nRep. Rosa DeLauro called the findings \u201cappalling.\u201d\n\u201cThis is a pattern of negligence \u2014 cutting corners to protect the company\u2019s bottom line at the expense of consumers and these conditions show a complete disregard for food safety and for the public health of the American people,\u201d the Connecticut Democrat said in a statement.\nThe findings echo the \u201cinadequate sanitation practices\u201d that USDA officials said contributed to the outbreak. Key factors included product residue, condensation and structural problems in the buildings, a January report concluded.\nAt the Jarratt plant, state inspectors working in partnership with USDA had documented mold, insects, liquid dripping from ceilings, and meat and fat residue on walls, floors and equipment, the AP previously reported.\nWhile no instances of insects were documented in this year\u2019s inspection reports, there were repeated reports of \u201cdried fat and protein from the previous day\u2019s production\u201d on equipment, stairs and walls. In April, an inspector at the Petersburg plant reported finding discarded meat underneath equipment, including \u201c5-6 hams, 4 large pieces of meat and a large quantity of pooling meat juice.\u201d\nOther reports detailed beaded condensation \u201cdirectly over the food contact surfaces of tables and conveyor belts.\u201d Additional reports documented rusting meat racks, doors that failed to close completely and staff who ignored required handwashing stations.\nThe reports point to a \u201cfood safety culture problem,\u201d said Barbara Kowalcyk, who directs a food safety and nutrition security center at George Washington University.\n\u201cWhat jumped out to me is there is an organizational culture issue that needs to be changed,\u201d she said. \u201cUsually that culture has to start at the top.\u201d\nIn the meantime, she advised consumers to think carefully about deli meat consumption. Older people and those who are pregnant or have weakened immune systems are especially vulnerable to serious illness from listeria infections.\n\u201cI think they need to be aware that there are issues at this organization that still are not completely under control, apparently,\u201d Kowalcyk said.\nBoar\u2019s Head faced multiple lawsuits from people who fell ill or from the families of those who died. Several survivors declined to comment publicly on the new problems, citing financial settlements with the company that included nondisclosure agreements.\n___\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

      "text": "Boar\u2019s Head is permanently closing its deli meat plant in Jarratt, Virginia, after a listeria outbreak that\u2019s killed nine people so far and sickened dozens of others in 18 states, according to a Friday press release from the company. Liverwurst produced at the plant has been identified as the cause of the deaths and Boar\u2019s Head says it will stop producing the product entirely at all of its facilities.\nWhile nine deaths have been reported since Boar\u2019s Head recalled its liverwurst on July 25, there is still serious concern about the possibility of more hospitalizations and deaths, according to the CDC. The health agency warns that listeria is a \u201chardy germ\u201d that can remain on surfaces for extended periods of time and it can take up to 10 weeks for some people to even develop symptoms.\nImportantly, some of the products that have been recalled have sell-by dates into October 2024 and there\u2019s real concern that some of this meat is still sitting in the refrigerators of consumers around the country.\nThe New York Times published a damning piece earlier this week about health inspection failures at the meat plant in Jarrat, including the observation of extensive rust, meats that were exposed to wet ceilings, and the presence of green mold. Garbage and insects were also noted on the floors. But the U.S. Department of Agriculture reportedly failed to institute strict health measures despite the findings.\nRoughly 400 workers will be impacted by the Virginia plant closing, according to the New York Times. Boar\u2019s Head is reportedly providing severance packages and relocation to employees but details about those plans haven\u2019t been released. There are also Boar\u2019s Head plants in Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, and New York.\n\u201cIt pains us to impact the livelihoods of hundreds of hard-working employees. We do not take lightly our responsibility as one of the area\u2019s largest employers,\u201d Boar\u2019s Head said in a statement published online. \u201cBut, under these circumstances, we feel that a plant closure is the most prudent course. We will work to assist each of our employees in the transition process.\u201d\nThe CDC has been posting updates since the recall began in late July, but hasn\u2019t updated its website about the listeria outbreak since August 28. All of the nine listeria deaths tied to the Boar\u2019s Head products have been in consumers aged 70 or older and include people in Illinois, New Jersey, Virginia, Florida, Tennessee, New Mexico, New York, and South Carolina.\nBoar\u2019s Head said the company is appointing a new Chief Food Safety & Quality Assurance Officer who will report directly to the president. It\u2019s also creating a new \u201cBoar\u2019s Head Food Safety Council\u201d that will be \u201ccomprised of independent industry-leading food safety experts,\u201d according to a press release.\n\u201cThis is a dark moment in our company\u2019s history, but we intend to use this as an opportunity to enhance food safety programs not just for our company, but for the entire industry,\u201d the company said."
