We didn't get jaded by all the other stuff,\" she said.\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?

I wasn't yelling at people, I'm not \u2018bridezilla,' but I knew every second of that schedule,\" she said.\nSince Brown was very conscious of everyone else's schedules for her wedding, she ended up throwing herself off prior to walking down the aisle.\n\"So I had a really big wedding party, and I knew that right before I would go, \u2018Okay, you guys go.\u2019 And I knew the second that the song would go right, so I\u2019d go, \u2018You guys go, you guys go.\u2019 Like, I was ready because they were walking down the aisle.

I remember everything about the ceremony, the vows. I remember the feeling, not caring,\" she said.\nOnce she and Bongiovi were on their honeymoon, he informed Brown that she was going to have a \"comedown\" after all the wedding festivities.\nBrown told Cooper that she did have a comedown because her wedding felt like \"lightning in a bottle.\"\nNow over a year into their marriage, Bongiovi and Brown live on a farm in Georgia with 25 barn animals and 10 dogs that stay inside their home and 23 that stay in an outdoor rescue building.\nAPP USERS CLICK HERE FOR INSTAGRAM POST\nBrown told Cooper that her husband finally had to have a conversation with her and told her \"no more\" to all of her farm animals.\nBrown's venture to Georgia began while filming \"Stranger Things\" in Atlanta. Her parents were adamant about \"sheltering\" her from Los Angeles and insisted she find a permanent residence in the Peach State.

I have chickens, I get the eggs, I know what it looks like from afar. I did get married young. It's all really veering in that direction, except I love my job, I love being untraditional and unconventional in so many ways of my life. I just love being on a farm and Jake does, too, so that would then make him a \u2018trad husband'? I don't know,\" Brown said.\nThe actress explained that she cooks dinner for her husband \"every night,\" but refuses to go grocery shopping \u2014 that is a task for Bongiovi.\nDuring a recent appearance on the \"Smartless\" podcast, Brown revealed that it's been a \"thing\" for her to have children young because of when her parents had their first child.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\"My mom actually had her first child at 21 and my dad was 19.
