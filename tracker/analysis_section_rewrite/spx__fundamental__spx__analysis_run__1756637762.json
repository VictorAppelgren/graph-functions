      "feedback": "Your draft is already tightly focused on Ether and meets the citation requirement (all sentences reference OGK8WLL69). To tighten it further, consider: 1) Removing the generic “high‑growth digital assets” phrase in the second sentence and replacing it with “high‑growth digital asset Ether” to avoid ambiguity. 2) Adding a brief inline citation to the first sentence (OGK8WLL69) to anchor the opening claim. 3) Ensuring no mention of Bitcoin or other crypto assets appears—currently none, but double‑check any future edits. 4) Condense the “key catalysts” paragraph to a single sentence that lists Fed policy, institutional product roll‑outs, and regulatory risk, each with a single citation. 5) Verify that the projected price range ($4,000‑$5,000) is explicitly tied to the cited Fed‑easing assumption (OGK8WLL69). These edits will keep the piece concise, fully cited, and strictly within the Ether focus.",
