      "summary": "China’s trade with Russia surged to $244.8 bn in 2024, with China becoming Russia’s biggest crude‑oil buyer and a key source of yuan‑denominated payments, which is likely to support the CNY against the USD. The U.S. sanctions have forced Russia to rely more on China, boosting yuan‑ruble trade flows and tightening the yuan’s demand base. These developments could lift the CNY by 1‑3 % over the next 3‑6 months, while the USD may weaken modestly as sanctions pressure the U.S. dollar’s dominance in energy trade.",
