  "title": "A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of The Mission Group plc (LON:TMG)",
  "description": "Key Insights The projected fair value for Mission Group is UK\u00a30.21 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Current...",
  "content": "\u2022 The projected fair value for Mission Group is UK\u00a30.21 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\u2022 Current share price of UK\u00a30.23 suggests Mission Group is potentially trading close to its fair value\n\u2022 Mission Group's peers are currently trading at a discount of 56% on average Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of The Mission Group plc (LON:TMG) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example! We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early. We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = UK\u00a312m\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.7%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 10%. Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= UK\u00a319m\u00f7 ( 1 + 10%)10= UK\u00a37.2m The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is UK\u00a319m. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of UK\u00a30.2, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mission Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.449. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\u2022 Interest payments on debt are not well covered.\n\u2022 Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the British market.\n\u2022 Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\n\u2022 Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow. Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. For Mission Group, there are three additional elements you should look at:\n\u2022 Risks: For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Mission Group that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\u2022 Future Earnings: How does TMG's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

It powers telemedicine, monitors chronic conditions in real-time, and speeds up drug discovery by analyzing vast datasets for insights into complex diseases.

  "argos_summary": "The article evaluates Mission Group plc (LON:TMG) using a two\u2011stage discounted cash flow model, estimating a fair value of \u00a30.21 per share versus the current price of \u00a30.23, implying the stock trades slightly above intrinsic value. It highlights modest earnings growth (\u224880% YoY) against declining revenue (\u224840% YoY) and a modest debt\u2011to\u2011equity of 25.2%, while noting a high beta of 1.56 and a PE of 25.9x versus a fair PE of 39x. Recent analyst commentary underscores concerns over debt usage and capital allocation, suggesting potential upside if the company improves profitability and capital efficiency. Overall, the piece presents Mission Group as a near\u2011fair\u2011value play with moderate upside potential but significant risk factors tied to its financial structure and earnings volatility.",
