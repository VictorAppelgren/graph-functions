  "title": "Excel Efficiency: 12 Function Key Shortcuts You're Missing Out On",
  "description": "Boost your Excel workflow with the power of function keys.",
  "content": "Most people overlook the row of function keys at the top of their keyboard. They often ignore, misunderstand, or underuse them. If you work with Excel spreadsheets regularly, those F-keys can be your secret weapon for working faster, smarter, and with far less frustration.\n\nWhile working in Excel, there are times when you try to build a formula but can't quite remember the syntax or what a specific argument does. Your first instinct might be to open a web browser and search for an answer, but there's a much faster, more integrated way. Press F1, and Excel's Help pane appears instantly.\n\nThe best part is that this help is context-sensitive. If you select a cell containing a VLOOKUP function and press F1, Excel shows the help article specifically for VLOOKUP, complete with syntax, detailed descriptions of each argument, and examples.\n\nThis shortcut might be basic, but it's one of the most effective if you love working through the keyboard and don't use a mouse. Simply select the cell you want to edit and press the F2 key. The cell immediately enters edit mode, placing the cursor at the end of the content.\n\nYou can instantly start typing to add more information, or use the arrow keys to move the cursor for precise edits. It's a small change that makes a huge difference in speed when you make lots of small adjustments across a sheet.\n\nIf you're not using named ranges in your Excel spreadsheets, you're missing out on something useful. Named ranges make formulas far more readable and manageable. For example, instead of referencing cryptic cell addresses like A1:A100, you can use descriptive names like SalesData or ExpenseCategories.\n\nWhen you're writing a formula and need to insert a named range, press F3. This opens the Paste Name dialog box, which displays a neat list of all the named ranges in your workbook.\n\nSelect the one you want, click OK, and Excel inserts it perfectly into your formula. This eliminates guesswork, prevents typos, and ensures your formulas are accurate.\n\nIf you apply a format to a cell and want to repeat it across others without redoing the whole process, use F4. For example, if you bold a heading, select the next heading and hit F4\u2014it's bolded instantly. This works for many actions, including formatting and inserting rows or columns. It's a low-effort way to be more efficient.\n\nIn formulas, F4 also toggles reference types. Writing =B1+C1, but need B1 locked? Place the cursor on B1, tap F4, and it cycles through $B$1, B$1, $B1, and back to B1. This gives you fine control over your references without manually adding dollar signs.\n\nF5 \u2013 Go To Any Cell or Range\n\nIn a large worksheet, scrolling to find a specific cell or range wastes time. With the F5 shortcut, you can quickly navigate anywhere in your sheet. Press F5 to bring up the Go-To box, where you can enter cell references, named ranges, or even jump to specific features like comments or formulas.\n\nThe dialog also shows a list of recently visited locations, making it easy to bounce between areas of your spreadsheet. Plus, the Special button adds even more power, letting you select cells based on their properties\u2014such as all formulas, all blank cells, or all cells with conditional formatting.\n\nThis is incredibly useful for auditing your work or performing bulk edits.\n\nYour Excel window contains several distinct areas: the ribbon at the top, the worksheet grid, the sheet tabs at the bottom, and the status bar. If you've used the Split view, you have even more panes.\n\nPress F6 to jump between these panes without using your mouse. Each press moves your focus to the next area, letting you use arrow keys or other shortcuts to navigate within it.\n\nSpelling still matters\u2014even in spreadsheets. If your file includes labels, comments, or notes, use F7 to run a quick spell check.\n\nIt scans your active worksheet, including cell values, comments, headers, and even text within charts, for potential typos and offers correction suggestions.\n\nNormally, selecting a range of cells with the keyboard involves holding down Shift while pressing the arrow keys. F8 offers an alternative. Press F8 once to turn on Extend Mode (you'll see it noted in the status bar). Now you can release the key. Each time you press an arrow key, the selection expands from your starting cell.\n\nYou can also click another cell to instantly select the entire rectangular range between your starting point and your click. Press F8 again or Esc to turn the mode off. The real advantage emerges when you need to select irregular ranges or when precision matters more than speed.\n\nBy default, Excel recalculates formulas automatically whenever a dependent cell changes. In large, complex workbooks, this can cause noticeable lag. Switching to Manual Calculation mode prevents automatic updates, letting you choose when recalculations happen.\n\nPress F9 to update every formula in all open workbooks, Shift+F9 to update only the active sheet, or select a specific range and press F9 to recalculate just that part. This control is especially useful with volatile functions, complex array formulas, or data linked to external sources\u2014cases where recalculation is resource-intensive.\n\nBy batching edits and triggering calculations only when needed, you can work more efficiently and avoid constant slowdowns.\n\nF10 reveals access keys for ribbon commands, creating keyboard shortcuts for virtually any spreadsheet function.\n\nPress F10, and small letters appear over each ribbon tab and quick access toolbar item. Alt+H takes you to the Home tab, Alt+N to Insert, and so on. Once in a tab, additional letters appear for specific commands, allowing you to execute them entirely from the keyboard.",

      "text": "Quick Links\nVLOOKUP is one of Excel\u2019s most useful functions, and it\u2019s also one of the least understood. In this article, we demystify VLOOKUP by way of a real-life example. We\u2019ll create a usable Invoice Template for a fictitious company.\nVLOOKUP is an Excel function. This article will assume that the reader already has a passing understanding of Excel functions, and can use basic functions such as SUM, AVERAGE, and TODAY. In its most common usage, VLOOKUP is a database function, meaning that it works with database tables - or more simply, lists of things in an Excel worksheet. What sort of things? Well, any sort of thing. You may have a worksheet that contains a list of employees, or products, or customers, or CDs in your CD collection, or stars in the night sky. It doesn\u2019t really matter.\nHere\u2019s an example of a list, or database. In this case it\u2019s a list of products that our fictitious company sells:\nUsually lists like this have some sort of unique identifier for each item in the list. In this case, the unique identifier is in the \u201cItem Code\u201d column. Note: For the VLOOKUP function to work with a database/list, that list must have a column containing the unique identifier (or \u201ckey\u201d, or \u201cID\u201d), and that column must be the first column in the table. Our sample database above satisfies this criterion.\nThe hardest part of using VLOOKUP is understanding exactly what it\u2019s for. So let\u2019s see if we can get that clear first:\nVLOOKUP retrieves information from a database/list based on a supplied instance of the unique identifier.\nIn the example above, you would insert the VLOOKUP function into another spreadsheet with an item code, and it would return to you either the corresponding item\u2019s description, its price, or its availability (its \u201cIn stock\u201d quantity) as described in your original list. Which of these pieces of information will it pass you back? Well, you get to decide this when you\u2019re creating the formula.\nIf all you need is one piece of information from the database, it would be a lot of trouble to go to to construct a formula with a VLOOKUP function in it. Typically you would use this sort of functionality in a reusable spreadsheet, such as a template. Each time someone enters a valid item code, the system would retrieve all the necessary information about the corresponding item.\nLet\u2019s create an example of this: An Invoice Template that we can reuse over and over in our fictitious company.\nFirst we start Excel, and we create ourselves a blank invoice:\nThis is how it\u2019s going to work: The person using the invoice template will fill in a series of item codes in column \u201cA\u201d, and the system will retrieve each item\u2019s description and price from our product database. That information will be used to calculate the line total for each item (assuming we enter a valid quantity).\nFor the purposes of keeping this example simple, we will locate the product database on a separate sheet in the same workbook:\nIn reality, it\u2019s more likely that the product database would be located in a separate workbook. It makes little difference to the VLOOKUP function, which doesn\u2019t really care if the database is located on the same sheet, a different sheet, or a completely different workbook.\nSo, we've created our product database, which looks like this:\nIn order to test the VLOOKUP formula we\u2019re about to write, we first enter a valid item code into cell A11 of our blank invoice:\nNext, we move the active cell to the cell in which we want information retrieved from the database by VLOOKUP to be stored. Interestingly, this is the step that most people get wrong. To explain further: We are about to create a VLOOKUP formula that will retrieve the description that corresponds to the item code in cell A11. Where do we want this description put when we get it? In cell B11, of course. So that\u2019s where we write the VLOOKUP formula: in cell B11. Select cell B11 now.\nWe need to locate the list of all available functions that Excel has to offer, so that we can choose VLOOKUP and get some assistance in completing the formula. This is found by first clicking the Formulas tab, and then clicking Insert Function:\nA box appears that allows us to select any of the functions available in Excel.\nTo find the one we\u2019re looking for, we could type a search term like \u201clookup\u201d (because the function we\u2019re interested in is a lookup function). The system would return us a list of all lookup-related functions in Excel. VLOOKUP is the second one in the list. Select it an click OK.\nThe Function Arguments box appears, prompting us for all the arguments (or parameters) needed in order to complete the VLOOKUP function. You can think of this box as the function asking us the following questions:\n- What unique identifier are you looking up in the database?\n- Where is the database?\n- Which piece of information from the database, associated with the unique identifier, do you wish to have retrieved for you?\nThe first three arguments are shown in bold, indicating that they are mandatory arguments (the VLOOKUP function is incomplete without them and will not return a valid value). The fourth argument is not bold, meaning that it\u2019s optional:\nWe will complete the arguments in order, top to bottom.\nThe first argument we need to complete is the Lookup_value argument. The function needs us to tell it where to find the unique identifier (the item code in this case) that it should be returning the description of. We must select the item code we entered earlier (in A11).\nClick on the selector icon to the right of the first argument:\nThen click once on the cell containing the item code (A11), and press Enter:\nThe value of \u201cA11\u201d is inserted into the first argument.\nNow we need to enter a value for the Table_array argument. In other words, we need to tell VLOOKUP where to find the database/list. Click on the selector icon next to the second argument:\nNow locate the database/list and select the entire list - not including the header line. In our example, the database is located on a separate worksheet, so we first click on that worksheet tab:\nNext we select the entire database, not including the header line:\n...and press Enter. The range of cells that represents the database (in this case \u201c\u2019Product Database\u2019!A2:D7\u201d) is entered automatically for us into the second argument.\nNow we need to enter the third argument, Col_index_num. We use this argument to specify to VLOOKUP which piece of information from the database, associate with our item code in A11, we wish to have returned to us. In this particular example, we wish to have the item\u2019s description returned to us. If you look on the database worksheet, you\u2019ll notice that the \u201cDescription\u201d column is the second column in the database. This means that we must enter a value of \u201c2\u201d into the Col_index_num box:\nIt is important to note that that we are not entering a \u201c2\u201d here because the \u201cDescription\u201d column is in the B column on that worksheet. If the database happened to start in column K of the worksheet, we would still enter a \u201c2\u201d in this field because the \u201cDescription\u201d column is the second column in set of cells we selected when specifying the \u201cTable_array\u201d.\nFinally, we need to decide whether to enter a value into the final VLOOKUP argument, Range_lookup. This argument requires either a true or false value, or it should be left blank. When using VLOOKUP with databases (as is true 90% of the time), the way to decide what to put in this argument can be thought of as follows:\nIf the first column of the database (the column that contains the unique identifiers) is sorted alphabetically/numerically in ascending order, then it\u2019s possible to enter a value of true into this argument, or leave it blank.\nIf the first column of the database is not sorted, or it\u2019s sorted in descending order, then you must enter a value of false into this argument\nAs the first column of our database is not sorted, we enter false into this argument:\nThat\u2019s it! We\u2019ve entered all the information required for VLOOKUP to return the value we need. Click the OK button and notice that the description corresponding to item code \u201cR99245\u201d has been correctly entered into cell B11:\nThe formula that was created for us looks like this:\nIf we enter a different item code into cell A11, we will begin to see the power of the VLOOKUP function: The description cell changes to match the new item code:\nWe can perform a similar set of steps to get the item\u2019s price returned into cell E11. Note that the new formula must be created in cell E11. The result will look like this:\n...and the formula will look like this:\nNote that the only difference between the two formulae is the third argument (Col_index_num) has changed from a \u201c2\u201d to a \u201c3\u201d (because we want data retrieved from the 3rd column in the database).\nIf we decided to buy 2 of these items, we would enter a \u201c2\u201d into cell D11. We would then enter a simple formula into cell F11 to get the line total:\n=D11*E11\n...which looks like this...\nCompleting the Invoice Template\nWe\u2019ve learned a lot about VLOOKUP so far. In fact, we\u2019ve learned all we\u2019re going to learn in this article. It\u2019s important to note that VLOOKUP can be used in other circumstances besides databases. This is less common, and may be covered in future How-To Geek articles.\nOur invoice template is not yet complete. In order to complete it, we would do the following:\n-\nWe would remove the sample item code from cell A11 and the \u201c2\u201d from cell D11. This will cause our newly created VLOOKUP formulae to display error messages:\nWe can remedy this by judicious use of Excel\u2019s IF() and ISBLANK() functions. We change our formula from this... =VLOOKUP(A11,'Product Database'!A2:D7,2,FALSE)...to this...=IF(ISBLANK(A11),\"\",VLOOKUP(A11,'Product Database'!A2:D7,2,FALSE))\n- We would copy the formulas in cells B11, E11 and F11 down to the remainder of the item rows of the invoice. Note that if we do this, the resulting formulas will no longer correctly refer to the database table. We could fix this by changing the cell references for the database to absolute cell references. Alternatively - and even better - we could create a range name for the entire product database (such as \u201cProducts\u201d), and use this range name instead of the cell references. The formula would change from this... =IF(ISBLANK(A11),\"\",VLOOKUP(A11,'Product Database'!A2:D7,2,FALSE))...to this... =IF(ISBLANK(A11),\"\",VLOOKUP(A11,Products,2,FALSE))...and then copy the formulas down to the rest of the invoice item rows.\n- We would probably \u201clock\u201d the cells that contain our formulae (or rather unlock the other cells), and then protect the worksheet, in order to ensure that our carefully constructed formulae are not accidentally overwritten when someone comes to fill in the invoice.\n- We would save the file as a template, so that it could be reused by everyone in our company\nIf we were feeling really clever, we would create a database of all our customers in another worksheet, and then use the customer ID entered in cell F5 to automatically fill in the customer\u2019s name and address in cells B6, B7 and B8.\nIf you would like to practice with VLOOKUP, or simply see our resulting Invoice Template, it can be downloaded from here."

By default, Excel automatically recalculates all open workbooks as you change values in the worksheets. However, you can choose to recalculate only the current worksheet manually.\nNotice I said worksheet, not workbook. There is no direct way in Excel to manually recalculate only the current workbook, but you can manually recalculate the current worksheet within a workbook.\nTo begin, click the \u201cFile\u201d tab.\nOn the backstage screen, click \u201cOptions\u201d in the list of items on the left.\nThe Excel Options dialog box displays. Click \u201cFormulas\u201d in the list of items on the left.\nIn the Calculation options section, click the \u201cManual\u201d radio button to turn on the ability to manually calculate each worksheet. When you select \u201cManual\u201d, the \u201cRecalculate workbook before saving\u201d check box is automatically checked. If you save your worksheet often and would rather not wait for it to recalculate every time you do, select the \u201cRecalculate workbook before saving\u201d check box so there is NO check mark in the box to disable the option.\nYou\u2019ll also notice the \u201cAutomatic except for data tables\u201d option.

If you\u2019re using a lot of data tables, and you still want to automatically recalculate your workbooks, you can select the \u201cAutomatic except for data tables\u201d option, and everything except for your data tables will be recalculated, saving you some time during recalculation.\nIf you don\u2019t mind the \u201cRecalculate workbook before saving\u201d option being enabled when you turn on Manual calculation, there is a quicker way of choosing to manually recalculate your worksheets.

      "text": "Quick Links\nExcel's spell check feature doesn't have all the bells and whistles that Word's does, but it does provide basic spell-checking functionality. You can check the spelling of words in the cells of a worksheet and add words to the dictionary.\nUnfortunately, Excel does not check your spelling as you type (by underlining them in red) like Word does. You are only notified that a word is spelled wrong when you run the spell check.\nHow to Spell Check the Current Worksheet\nTo spell check a worksheet, click the tab at the bottom of the screen for the worksheet on which you want to run the spell check.\nWhen you run the spell check, it starts from whichever cell is currently selected, so, if you want to start the spell check at the \"beginning\" of the worksheet, put the cursor on cell \"A1\" before starting.\nWhen you're ready to start the spell check, click the \"Review\" tab.\nClick \"Spelling\" in the \"Proofing\" section. You can also press \"F7\" with any tab on the ribbon active to start the spell check.\nThe cell containing the first word not found in the dictionary is highlighted and the \"Spelling\" dialog box displays. The questionable word displays in the \"Not in Dictionary\" edit box. You can choose to \"Ignore Once\" or to \"Ignore All\" occurrences of the misspelled word if the word is actually correct for your purposes. If that's the case, you can choose to \"Add to Dictionary\" if the word is one you use often.\nIf you've actually misspelled a word, you can either select the correctly spelled word from the list of \"Suggestions\" or enter the correct spelling in the \"Not in Dictionary\" edit box (if it's not listed in the \"Suggestions\" list). Then, click \"Change\". To change all occurrences of this error with the same change, click \"Change All\".\nIf the questionable word is one you tend to mistype often, you can quickly set up an AutoCorrect entry for it so it will be automatically corrected the next time you make the mistake. To do this, either enter the correct word in the \"Not in Dictionary\" edit box or choose it from the \"Suggestions\" list and click \"AutoCorrect\" on the \"Spelling\" dialog box. In addition to correcting the word in your worksheet, an AutoCorrect entry is automatically created. The next time you type the incorrect word the same way, it will be automatically replaced with the replacement word you specified. We talk about AutoCorrect entries and how to create them in our article about assigning keyboard shortcuts to symbols in Excel.\nWhen the spell check has finished, a dialog box displays telling you so. Click \"OK\" to close it.\nNotice that the word \"Refridgerator\" on the \"Invoice\" worksheet was not found in the spell check of this worksheet. That's because it's the result of a formula in that cell that grabbed the word from a cell on the \"Product Database\" worksheet based on the \"Item Code\" entered on the \"Invoice\" worksheet. To correct \"Refridgerator\", we need to run a spell check on the \"Product Database\" worksheet, which we will do in the next section.\nRemember when we said you should select the first cell of a worksheet (\"A1\") before starting a spell check? If you forgot, and started the spell check from any other cell than \"A1\", you will be asked at this point whether you want to continue checking the spelling at the beginning of the worksheet before the spell check completes. Click \"Yes\" to check the remainder of the worksheet that has not been checked yet and then you will see the \"Spell check complete\" dialog box pictured above.\nHow to Spell Check All Worksheets in a Workbook at Once\nBy default, Excel spell checks your current worksheet. But what if you have a lot of worksheets in your workbook and you want to check them all? No worries. You can easily do that in one go.\nIn our example, there are two worksheets in our workbook, \"Invoice\" and \"Product Database\". In the previous section, we only checked the \"Invoice\" worksheet. Now, we will select both of the worksheets in our workbook so they will both be spell checked without having to do each separately.\nTo spell check all the worksheets in a workbook, right-click on the current worksheet tab at the bottom of the Excel window and select \"Select All Sheets\" from the popup menu.\nNotice in the above image that the currently selected worksheet tab displays in white and the inactive tab displays in gray. When all worksheet tabs are selected, they all display with a white background, as shown below.\nNow when you start the spell check, it will check all the worksheets in the workbook. In our case, when the spell check gets to the second worksheet, or the \"Product Database\" worksheet, it finds a spelling error. To correct the error, we select the correct word in the \"Suggestions\" list box and click \"Change\". As we mentioned earlier in this article, if we think we misspelled the same word the same way in other cells in our workbook, we can click \"Change All\" to correct them all at once with the same corrected word.\nRemember, you can also type the correct word in the \"Not in Dictionary\" edit box and click \"Change\" to correct the error.\nWhen the spell check is complete, and the \"Spell check complete\" dialog box displays, you may notice that the last corrected error doesn't seem to have been corrected in the cell on the worksheet.\nDon't worry. When you click \"OK\" to close the dialog box, the corrected word displays in the cell.\nYou can use custom dictionaries to add words you use often to the dictionary, that are not already in the default built-in dictionary, as well as delete words you added using the \"Add to Dictionary\" button on the \"Spelling\" dialog box. You can even create additional custom dictionaries. The spell check can also be limited to use of the main dictionary only, even if there are custom dictionaries available."

      "text": "Quick Links\nBy default, Microsoft Excel's cells are named by their column-row references, like A1 or B2. However, you can assign a more specific name to a cell or range of cells to improve navigation, make formulas clearer, and save time in the long run.\nWhy You Should Always Name Ranges in Excel\nYou might be familiar with bookmarks in Microsoft Word, which are invisible way-points in specified locations of a document that you can jump to whenever you need to. Microsoft Excel's alternative to this time-saving tool is somewhat unimaginatively called \"names,\" accessed through the name box in the top-left corner of your workbook.\nLet's say you have a huge worksheet containing lots of rows and columns of data, and you want to jump to a certain cell without scrolling for what seems like forever. The quickest way to do this is to type a cell reference in the name box and press Enter.\nLikewise, if you have other active tabs in your workbook, you can jump to any cell within any of the worksheets by typing the tab name, followed by an exclamation mark, and then cell reference. For example, typing:\nSheet2!H11\nand pressing Enter takes you to cell H11 in Sheet 2.\nWhile this is all well and good, it's of little use if you can't remember which cells contain the information you want to jump to. This is why you should change the names of cells or ranges that you will either visit or use in formulas often.\nIn this example, I have named a range of cells \"Monthly_Totals\" that I review all the time. Because I've named the range, I can jump to it by clicking the down arrow in the name box, regardless of which worksheet I'm currently working in.\nWhat's more, I can use this named range in a formula. For example, typing:\n=SUM(Monthly_Totals)\nadds all the values in this range and provides an overall total.\nSelect and rename a whole column or row to ensure formulas referencing the named range pick up any added data.\nAs a result of using a named range rather than direct cell references, I can guarantee that I've not accidentally selected the wrong cells. What's more, because the referenced range has a descriptive name, when I look at the formula, it's easy to remind myself of how the calculation is made. A third benefit of using named ranges in formulas is that they're easier to troubleshoot if the figure doesn't seem quite right.\nAnother good example of the usefulness of named ranges in formulas is when they form part of a logical test in the IF function. In this example, by clicking the cell and looking in the formula bar, you can immediately see that the criterion for whether the threshold is met involves the total income. On the other hand, using cell references here would make this less clear:\n=IF(Total_Income>10000,\"Threshold met\",\"Threshold not met\")\nFinally, named ranges are helpful in creating dynamic drop-down lists through Excel's Data Validation tool. In this example, I've renamed the whole of column A \"Employee_Names.\" Now, when I click \"Data Validation\" in the Data tab on the ribbon to add a drop-down list of names to cell E1, I can specify the source of my list as this named column.\nThis means that any names I add to column A will be included in the drop-down list.\nHow to Name a Range in Excel\nNaming a cell or a range of cells in Excel is straightforward. Simply select the cell or range you want to name, and replace the cell reference with the desired name in the name box. Then, press Enter.\nWhen you use this method to name ranges manually, there are some rules you must follow for Excel to accept your changes:\n- The first character must be a letter, underscore (_), or backslash (\\).\n- The remainder of the name mustn't contain any special characters. In other words, you can use letters, numbers, periods, and underscores only.\n- If the name you assign contains more than one word, use underscores or periods (.) as word separators. You can't use spaces.\n- A named range cannot be the same as a cell reference, like A1 or B$2.\n- You can't call a range \"R,\" \"r,\" \"C,\" or \"c,\" as these references are reserved for other background uses in Excel.\n- Each range name must be different to other names in the workbook, and Excel doesn't distinguish between upper and lowercase letters.\n- Names can be up to 255 characters in length\u2014although this shouldn't be an issue, as the names you assign should be clear and concise.\nYou can also force Excel to name a range based on data you already have in your worksheet. Select the range you want to name, and in the Formulas tab on the ribbon, click \"Create From Selection.\" Then, check the relevant option in the dialog box that appears. In this example, checking \"Top Row\" will result in the range being named \"Employees,\" because the column header is included in the selection.\nHow to Change a Named Range in Excel\nWhether you want to change the name of a range or the cells included within a named range, the process is quick and easy.\nIn the Formulas tab on the ribbon, click \"Name Manager.\"\nThen, double-click the named range you want to modify, or single-click it and select \"Edit.\"\nNext, in the Edit Name dialog box, you can change the name of the range in the Name field, or adjust the referenced range in the Refers To field.\nWhen you're done, click \"OK,\" and close the Name Manager dialog box.\nIf you included the previous name or range in a formula, Data Validation condition, or another reference in your workbook, don't worry\u2014these will update automatically according to the changes you just made.\nThings You Should Know About Naming Ranges in Excel\nBefore you go ahead and name some ranges in your workbook, here are some points to note:\n- Use descriptive but short names. For example, \"Total_expenditure_for_the_year_2020\" will only serve to make formulas unbearably long and cause confusion. Likewise, \"TotExp20\" might not provide enough information to someone who hasn't seen the sheet before. Instead, a name like \"Expenditure_2020\" would be more suitable.\n- Not every range has to be named. Sometimes, unnamed ranges (direct cell references) can be more useful if you share the sheet with others, as they can see the exact reference location. In other words, you should only name ranges when doing so will add value to the spreadsheet.\n- You could consider prefixing any named ranges with \"Rng_\" to distinguish them from other named items, like tables or charts. Taking this step also makes the ranges easier to identify in formulas\u2014when you type Rng, all the named ranges will appear in a tooltip list, and you can simply select the relevant range.\n- Another way to name ranges in Excel is to format the data as an Excel table, and rename the table instead.\nNaming ranges is just one of many ways to speed up your workflow in Excel. For example, you could also freeze panes to avoid overscrolling, use the Data Forecast tool to generate projections, and adjust the Quick Access Toolbar to personalize your Excel experience."
