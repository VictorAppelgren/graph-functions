  "description": "Circle (NYSE: CRCL) plans a $1.3B secondary stock sale at $130 per share \u2014 over 4x its June IPO price \u2014 as USDC circulation surges 90% year-over-year and Q2 revenue jumps 53%.",
  "content": "Circle (NYSE: CRCL), the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, announced plans for a secondary stock sale of 10 million Class A shares at $130 each \u2014 more than quadruple its June IPO price of $31.\n\nIn a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it will sell 2 million shares itself, while existing shareholders will offer 8 million. Circle will use proceeds from its portion of the sale for \u201cgeneral corporate purposes.\u201d It will not receive proceeds from the shareholder sales.\n\nThe offering comes just two months after Circle\u2019s high-profile debut on the New York Stock Exchange, which saw shares surge as much as 235% on day one before closing at $83. The stock later reached a record $298.99 on June 23, before retreating to close Thursday at $139.23 \u2014 down more than 9% on the day.\n\nCircle\u2019s move underscores strong investor appetite for the company despite recent volatility. USDC remains one of the world\u2019s largest stablecoins by market capitalization, and the firm has been expanding its role in digital payments and tokenized finance.\n\nPre-market trading on Friday showed CRCL shares 1.63% lower at $136.98, as markets digested the news.\n\nCircle Internet Group (NYSE: CRCL) reported a 90% year-over-year jump in USDC circulation to $61.3 billion at the end of Q2 2025, rising further to $65.2 billion by August 10.\n\nTotal revenue and reserve income surged 53% to $658 million, while adjusted EBITDA climbed 52% to $126 million. The company posted a $482 million net loss, driven by $591 million in IPO-related non-cash charges, including $424 million in stock-based compensation triggered by its $1.2 billion June IPO.\n\nCEO Jeremy Allaire called the quarter \u201ca pivotal moment\u201d for both Circle and the broader stablecoin industry, highlighting strong adoption of its platform and strategic partnerships with firms like Binance, FIS, Fiserv, Corpay, and OKX.\n\nIn Q2, Circle launched its Circle Payments Network, introduced the Arc Layer-1 blockchain for stablecoin finance, and expanded commercial use cases across payments, banking, and capital markets. The GENIUS Act \u2014 a new U.S. stablecoin regulatory framework \u2014 was signed into law, reinforcing Circle\u2019s position as a leading regulated issuer. Looking ahead, the company projects a 40% CAGR in USDC circulation over multiple years, FY 2025 other revenue of $75\u2013$85 million, and RLDC margins of 36\u201338%.\n\nCircle plans $1.3B stock sale, four times IPO price first appeared on TheStreet on Aug 15, 2025\n\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Aug 15, 2025, where it first appeared.",

      "text": "Wall Street\u2019s calling it the most 'genius' piece of regulation since Dodd-Frank originally appeared on TheStreet.\nIn a significant feat for the cryptocurrency industry, the U.S. Senate passed the GENIUS Act on June 17 with a vote of 68-30, marking the first major digital asset regulation to pass the upper chamber of Congress.\nThe legislation establishes a federal structure for stablecoin issuance, projected to reach a $2 trillion market cap within the next three years.\nA stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency that maintains a stable value over time, equivalent to a fixed amount of money. Its value is usually tied to a more stable asset, such as the US dollar or gold.\nGENIUS Act\nThe GENIUS Act, identifying Guaranteed and Enforceable Neutral Intermediaries for U.S. Stablecoins, establishes guidelines for how companies can issue and back their stablecoins.\nThe bill requires issuers to hold one-to-one reserves in cash or short-term Treasury securities to guarantee stability. It also involves stablecoin issuers in verifying these reserves every month. The bill will also provide protections to consumers and prohibit tech companies and government officials from launching their tokens while in office.\nElizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), the ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, stated on May 19 that she would oppose the GENIUS Act because it would weaken consumer safeguards, leaving people vulnerable to scams and unnecessary fees.\nIn the Senate Floor meeting, she said, \"While a strong stablecoin bill is the best possible outcome, this weak bill is worse than no bill at all.\"\nHer main line of opposition was that the GENIUS Act, which was being voted on, was just days after President Trump hosted a private dinner and VIP White House tour for top investors in his meme coin, TRUMP, which she said would further fuel President Trump's crypto corruption.\nShortly after, the bipartisan negotiators addressed the ethics, transparency, and national security concerns set within the original bill, and then 18 Democrats supported the measure.\nThe most notable of them all was Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.), who said the \"bill will cement U.S. dollar dominance, it will protect customers, and it will drive demand for U.S. Treasuries.\"\nHowever, the bill now advances to the GOP-led House, where its companion legislation, the STABLE Act, is also gaining momentum. If both chambers can agree, it would be historic and potentially be the first complete digital asset regulation in the United States.\nWall Street believes that this could be a reform after Dodd-Frank. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, passed in 2010, was a response to the 2008 financial crisis. It was meant to improve financial institution governance, limit risky conduct, and protect consumers from abuse."

The firm also cut its holdings in other crypto stocks such as Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN), the company that acquired Deribit.\nCircle's rapid rise coincides with a renewed moment of interest in stablecoins as Big Tech considers integrations.\nStablecoins are cryptocurrencies whose value is tied to another asset, such as a fiat currency or gold, in order to maintain a stable price. Circle's stablecoin USD Coin (USDC), for instance, is pegged to the US dollar.\nCircle stock hits $115 on second day of NYSE debut first appeared on TheStreet on Jun 6, 2025\nThis story was originally reported by TheStreet on Jun 6, 2025, where it first appeared."
