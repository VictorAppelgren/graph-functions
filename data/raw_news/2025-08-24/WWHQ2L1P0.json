  "content": "The Labor Day sales can never start too early, especially for big investments in your home entertainment system for shows, sports and movies. Right now, one standout offer is this Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar at Amazon for $699 (was $899).\n\nThe Bose Smart Ultra is a pricey but premium soundbar known for its impressive soundstage and welcome Dolby Atmos support. This is the lowest price we've seen for it yet, so well worth considering if you want a high-end soundbar now and don't want to wait around until Black Friday.\n\nThe Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar is the better, more expensive version of the Bose Smart Soundbar, our best compact Dolby Atmos soundbar. Like that epithet might suggest, both support Dolby Atmos and Bose TrueSpace tech, which improve how sound carries across the room and how immersive it feels.\n\nOur reviewer enjoyed the \"wide and nicely detailed sound\" and control options, though he noticed a lack of weight and audio \"height\" in its sound profile. As a smart soundbar, it also supports voice control and integration with AI assistants like Alexa and Google. You can read more about the specifics in our Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar review.\n\nDespite those gripes, the \"exemplary build and finish\" and compact stature make it a great alternative to the Sonos Arc. It's 41.14\" long and only 2.29\" high, a few inches smaller in length and height.\n\nWhat else is out there, you ask? Well, the Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar is the \"all-in-one\" competitor to the Sonos Arc, which now also has an upgrade called the Sonos Arc Ultra. If both of those are way out of budget, you can also browse our best cheap soundbars and find something close to $200.",

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra is the best-sounding one-box soundbar you can buy today for the price. It has seriously impressive bass for something so compact; it has superbly balanced sound with clear dialogue that fits naturally into the rest of the movie soundtrack; and it has convincing Dolby Atmos positioning and layering of 3D sound, with great width and excellent height. But it\u2019s frustrating that it doesn\u2019t have HDMI passthrough, and the lack of DTS is a shame.\nPros\n- +\nFull sound and great speech clarity\n- +\nVery good Dolby Atmos effects\n- +\nCompact for such good sound\nCons\n- -\nNo HDMI passthrough ports\n- -\nNo DTS-HD support\n- -\nNot as immersive as multi-box options\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nSonos Arc Ultra review: Two minute review\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra is the new flagship in Sonos\u2019 soundbar line-up, and it takes everything that was good about the original Arc and cranks it up to the next level. Better Dolby Atmos effects, better bass, better speech clarity, better connectivity.\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra is a huge step up for music quality over the original Sonos Arc, and while it\u2019s less of a jump up from the original with movies, it\u2019s still a clear and obvious improvement, and ranks among the best soundbars.\nIs it worth upgrading from the original Sonos Arc? I think that\u2019ll depend on how much of a cinephile you are; I really appreciated the improved sound balance and the clearer speech, and the obvious improvement to Dolby Atmos effects positioning, and found it hard to go back \u2013 but the original Sonos Arc is no slouch, and more casual viewers may find the difference to feel less essential.\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra keeps the original\u2019s biggest flaw, which is not having any HDMI passthrough port in an era when HDMI ports are becoming a bit of a premium, and effectively all its key rivals offer this. The lack of DTS is also a shame, but won\u2019t be a big problem for most people. I still thoroughly recommend the Sonos Arc Ultra, but it just may not be the best fit for your setup because of its HDMI limitation.\nFor those wondering about Sonos\u2019 app, I had no problems setting it up, playing with different configurations, and changing settings.\nI\u2019m reviewing the Sonos Arc Ultra as a single soundbar here, though I have tested it with the Sub 4 and rear speakers, and I\u2019ll talk about that experience too.\nI think the Sonos Arc Ultra gives you the best cinematic experience you can get from a single-unit soundbar for under $1000 / \u00a31000. However, in the UK, you can get the Samsung HW-Q990D for around the same price during sales events, and if you\u2019re happy having a four-box surround system, you\u2019ll get a far more immersive experience. And Sony\u2019s Bravia Theater Bar 9 is a key competitor around the world \u2013 it's a single-box soundbar like the Arc Ultra, but it offers the missing HDMI port, and with 4K 120Hz support, no less. It officially costs a lot more than the Sonos Arc Ultra, but sales season discounts bring it down to around the same price. It\u2019s even bigger than the Arc Ultra, though.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nSonos Arc Ultra review: Price & release date\n- Released on October 29, 2024\n- Priced at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,799\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra is priced pretty well at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,799, considering that other flagship one-box soundbars can be far higher, such as the $2,399 / \u00a31,990 / AU$3,999 Devialet Dione, or the $1,399 / \u00a31,399 / AU$1,795 of the Sony Bravia Theater Bar 9.\nObviously, it's not cheap, and you can find the Samsung HW-Q800D for significantly less, but that's not a one-box soundbar, and building high-quality sound into a single unit that isn't huge (which the Devialet Dione especially is) is hard. For a premium soundbar, the Arc Ultra is competitive.\nSonos Arc Ultra review: Specs\n| Dimensions (W x H x D) | 2.95 x 46.38 x 4.35 inches (75 x 1178 x 110.6mm) |\n| Speaker channels | 9.1.4 |\n| Connections: | 1x HDMI with eARC, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth |\n| Dolby Atmos/DTS:X | Yes/No |\n| Sub included | No |\n| Rear speakers included | No |\n| Features | Sonos multi-room, TruePlay tuning, AirPlay 2 |\nSonos Arc Ultra review: Features\n- 9.1.4 speaker channels, with Sound Motion bass driver\n- All Sonos' usual special skills, plus Bluetooth\n- Dolby Atmos support, but no DTS\nMuch like the original Sonos Arc, this is a Dolby Atmos soundbar with HDMI eARC connectivity, Sonos multi-room wireless support, and optional voice control from Alexa or Sonos\u2019 own more limited voice assistant.\nThe biggest new feature is the Sound Motion driver, which delivers big bass performance from a small speaker, and a generally improved speaker setup that now promises 9.1.4 channels of sound, compared to 5.0.2 from the original Sonos Arc.\nThere\u2019s also Bluetooth connectivity in the Arc Ultra, which is a first for a Sonos soundbar, but is now standard on the best Sonos speakers at last, including the recent Sonos Era 100 and Sonos Era 300.\nNaturally, the Sonos Arc Ultra works with Sonos\u2019 Sub options (including the new Sub 4 as well as older models) and you can connect it to rear speakers for a real surround sound setup. The Arc Ultra is the first Sonos soundbar that doesn\u2019t work with the Sonos Play:1 or Play:5 speakers \u2013 but it still works with Sonos One, Sonos Five, the Era models, or with two wired speakers connected to a Sonos Amp.\nSonos\u2019 TruePlay room-tuning tech is here, and it\u2019s finally available on Android in a new \u2018quick\u2019 version, which is also available on iOS. This new version will probably be preferable for a lot of people because it\u2019s much easier. It uses the Arc Ultra\u2019s own mic array to test your room using a series of pet-alarming tones, to adjust the system\u2019s sound for better precision and Dolby Atmos surround effects. On iOS, it still asked me to hold my phone where I sit for a set of measurements there first, which is what the full TruePlay system does \u2013 but then I didn\u2019t have to walk around the room waving my phone up and down.\nThe biggest flaw in the Sonos Arc is the lack of any HDMI passthrough ports. Most premium soundbars have more than one HDMI port \u2013 one to connect to your TV, and then at least one other that passes video through to your TV, so that you don\u2019t lose the use of one of your HDMI ports for connecting consoles or other video boxes. This is doubly annoying in the majority of TV models available today, which only have two HDMI 2.1 ports for 4K 120Hz support at most, and the HDMI eARC is usually one of those ports, so you\u2019re losing one of the most important ports. (Many LG and Samsung TVs have four HDMI 2.1 ports, so this is less of a problem, and in 2025 far more TVs will have four HDMI 2.1 ports thanks to a new chip from MediaTek \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t help TVs today.)\nEven ignoring the type of ports, four video devices is not an uncommon amount for people to want to connect to a TV here in 2024, and yet if you have the Sonos Arc Ultra, you can only connect three.\nIt\u2019s so frustrating, given that it was a complaint I had about the original Sonos Arc when that launched in 2020. I\u2019ve spoken to Sonos about the topic, and the company\u2019s stance has been that HDMI passthrough adds complexity and it wants its soundbars to be as simple as possible. But that only holds true if someone doesn\u2019t then have to deal with the headache of what a good solution is if they want to connect more devices than they have ports free, once the Arc Ultra is connected. I think Sonos has simply off-loaded the complexity to users. With an HDMI passthrough port, I\u2019d have been seriously looking at giving the Arc Ultra a five-star rating overall.\nThe other notable issue is a lack of DTS decoding. This is not a big problem if your TV or playback device will decode DTS-HD to LPCM, as many will. I had a great time playing DTS-HD Blu-rays while testing the Sonos Arc, and getting the big, powerful, high-quality sound I was expecting. The lack of DTS:X is the more annoying part for purists, especially with it now used on Disney Plus for some movies, but it really isn\u2019t a dealbreaker for the vast majority of people.\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra works with the audio-swap feature of the Sonos Ace headphones, so you can watch anything that plays on your TV with great spatial audio on the headphones to avoid disturbing others in the house \u2013 our Sonos Ace review has more on how well that works, but it\u2019s not affected by the Sonos Arc Ultra's performance, so I won\u2019t go into it here.\n- Features score: 4 / 5\nSonos Arc Ultra review: Performance\n- Excellent dynamic range\n- Very strong Dolby Atmos effect\n- Very clear speech and detail\nIn my opinion, the Sonos Arc Ultra is the best-sounding single-box soundbar you can get for under $1,000 / \u00a31,000. It delivers fulsome balance and exciting sound with clear speech, and superb height and width. The Devialet Dione maybe does this all better as a single-unit soundbar, but at around twice the price and twice the size, it\u2019s a harder sell in several ways.\nDolby Atmos surround effects don\u2019t seem like they\u2019re coming from behind you, inevitably, but they do feel like they reach you when there are movement effects in particular. Height channels have motion and precision, despite being part virtual \u2013 Sonos claims four channels of overhead sound, but there are only two drivers, with the width drivers combining with the height drivers for a sense of four channels, and it works well.\nSound is layered very impressively in Dolby Atmos, with a sense of 3D positioning across the whole space in front of you.\nEverything is an improvement over the original Sonos Arc. It\u2019s not quite night and day, but it\u2019s a clear step up anyway. That especially goes for speech clarity and Dolby Atmos effects in movies, with everything feeling just more expansive and more in the room than from the older soundbar.\nI tried Sonos\u2019 new and upgraded speech enhancement tools for the Arc Ultra, and they\u2019re very effective, but they affect the sound balance (as do all such tools), and I found that I really didn\u2019t need them anyway on the Arc Ultra. It\u2019s a bit unoriginal to say that the speech in Christopher Nolan movies is hard to hear, but I tested the old and new Arc with them, and there was a big jump in legibility on the Arc Ultra that meant they really weren\u2019t hard to follow any more (generally).\nSurprisingly, the new bass driver didn\u2019t create that big an effect compared to the original Sonos Arc in movies that already ramp up the bass, but it does help to make the sound feel fuller in general. It makes the bass that the Arc Ultra can generate better connected through to the mid-range, so the overall balance in low-end-heavy scenes is stronger \u2013 and just excellent overall. There\u2019s a good dispersal of the bass so that it doesn\u2019t feel too directional, and the impact is really pleasing for such a relatively compact soundbar.\nThe Sound Motion bass speaker did really jump out during music though. This actually was a night and day difference from the original Arc, with a massive improvement across the whole frequency range. For music, the original Arc sounded unclear and subdued compared to the Arc Ultra at the same volume. Having said that, I would still put the Arc Ultra essentially on par for music quality with the Sonos Era 300, which is half the price. It\u2019s easier to fill out that sound when you can be thick and tall, unlike a soundbar.\nRunning TruePlay tuning helps the Dolby Atmos and finer details to come through more clearly, so I absolutely recommend it. There wasn\u2019t a clear difference between the quick version and the full version in my setup, so as I mentioned above, the quick version should be all that most people need to bother with.\nTo repeat myself from the start of this section, I think the Arc Ultra delivers the best-value cinematic experience from a single-box soundbar. It\u2019s the best combination of a demure design, effective sound reproduction and 3D effects, and a reasonable price given what it can do. More expensive soundbars may do better, but the audio package here is excellent.\nI\u2019m reviewing it as a single unit for all the scores here, but I also tested it with a Sub 4 and Era 300 speakers in Sonos\u2019 full-power ultimate system. I also tested it with a Sub 4 only, and then slotted it and the Sub 4 into my existing setup using my Sonos One rear speakers.\nMake no mistake \u2013 despite the Sound Motion tech being very impressive for bass, the Sub 4 adds a whole new dimension of bass you can feel, in frequencies the soundbar alone simply can\u2019t touch. You will literally get more from your movies with a big sub, though obviously for a premium of $799 / \u00a3799.\nIn the full elite surround mode, with Era 300 units behind as well, you can really feel the overall power of the system. Even with one sub (you can connect a second to more fully spread the bass around) you can feel the power of the low frequencies everywhere, with excellent fullness through to the mid-range, and a clear separation of higher frequencies from that mix. It\u2019s a really well-connected whole system, and testing against the Samsung HW-Q990C, I say you get a more satisfying overall sound profile from the Sonos setup. However, not by that much, considering you\u2019ll pay a lot more for the Sonos system \u2013 it kind of proves why Samsung\u2019s top-end soundbars are five-star products among the best Dolby Atmos soundbars. Still, for those with the ear, I think the Sonos system\u2019s sound is superior.\nEven with my Sonos Ones as rear speakers, I felt like I was getting a different sound profile from the rears (post TruePlay) than with my Sonos Arc and Sub Mini that I usually have. They felt punchier and with a little more bass added to them, perhaps to match the broader sound profile the bar is capable of compared to the original Arc. I feel that swapping the Arc for the Arc Ultra in my setup would be an upgrade, albeit one that I would enjoy as someone who\u2019s obsessive over sound and setups \u2013 perhaps someone more casual about home theater wouldn\u2019t find it to be as good value.\n- Performance score: 5 / 5\nSonos Arc Ultra review: Design\n- Very well made and subtle\n- Some key buttons hidden at the back\n- Shorter but wider than original Arc\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra is 18% smaller by volume than the original Sonos Arc, according to Sonos, and this manifests in it being less tall (which is very welcome) and less deep (also welcome for those with chunky TV stands, though it\u2019s still somewhat deep because it has a chunky bar across the back). However, it\u2019s actually wider than the Sonos Arc. It\u2019s still good for TVs of 55 inches and up, though, and the shorter height can make a real difference with some TVs.\nIt comes in black and white, and the overall look is very simple and classy. A hard, curved grille covers the entire thing, and it\u2019s good at just disappearing into the room, which is what most people will want. The new design seems to pick up fingerprints worse than the old one, so be warned if you\u2019re fastidious and have handsy kids.\nThe button for activating Bluetooth pairing mode is on the back, which is inconvenient for a soundbar, especially if it\u2019s wall-mounted. You can pair from the Sonos app instead, but it would be better still if the Bluetooth button was on top, for maximum flexibility \u2013 especially since the button layout here was redesigned anyway, including moving volume over to the right, for whatever reason. In the middle, you still have buttons to play/pause, and skip tracks.\nThe switch to kill the voice control mics is also on the back, and is turned on by default, so the privacy conscious should remember to hit this before getting it situated. Also on the back is an Ethernet port, and then the power and HDMI ports are on the sides of the bit port cutaway on the rear \u2013 just like the original Arc.\nThe Arc Ultra is wall-mountable and works on the same mounts as the original Arc, which is nice for upgraders \u2013 though some of the mount may be visible, due to the change in size.\n- Design score: 4 / 5\nSonos Arc Ultra review: Setup & usability\n- Use Sonos app to get started\n- TruePlay is now easier, and very useful\n- Once connected to the TV, very little effort needed\nIf you have read or watched anything about recent Sonos releases, you will have seen strong opinions about the new Sonos app. We can\u2019t post a video covering Sonos without a cascade of comments saying no one should ever buy Sonos again because of the state of the software. At launch, earlier in 2024, the app was missing a lot of features, and a lot of people had problems accessing or making changes to their systems.\nAt the time of writing this review, Sonos says that it has added 90% of the missing features back in, and is still committed to updates every two weeks to address bugs and performance while adding the remainder of the features.\nI had no problems at all setting up the Arc Ultra at home through the app, making the settings adjustments I needed, and then adding/breaking multiple different surround setups while I tested different configurations of Sonos setups.\nI did have trouble setting the surround system up in our office testing rooms, where the connection between the components would drop regularly \u2013 but this is pretty common on our office Wi-Fi outside of Sonos. I\u2019ve had a problem getting Samsung\u2019s soundbars to connect to register on the SmartThings app, and it can be difficult with smart home tech, so I don\u2019t blame Sonos for this \u2013 but it\u2019s only fair to note it if I\u2019m going to dig into the experience. At home, on my normal mesh router setup, I had no problems at all.\nThe usability of Sonos\u2019 soundbars continues to be a slightly mixed bag \u2013 I think if you designed an app for controlling a soundbar as its first priority, rather than playing music as its first priority, you probably wouldn\u2019t bury settings like the Speech Enhancement that far down in the settings.\nI\u2019d love to see Sonos change how it approaches its Now Playing screen when you\u2019re connected to HDMI, so it puts more emphasis on making settings available to you instead of a lack of artwork.\nBut setting it up was smooth, and most people won\u2019t need to go back into the app, especially if you won\u2019t connect other devices. As I mentioned, I found the speech clear enough without using the enhancement, and I didn\u2019t think the EQ needed adjustment. TruePlay will be suggested as part of the setup too, and it worked with my remote (over HDMI-CEC, but infrared is also enabled by default) out of the box with no tinkering required.\n- Setup & usability score: 4 / 5\nSonos Arc Ultra review: Value\n- Premium, but competitive price\n- As good sound as you can get for the price\n- Surround-ready products available around the same price\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra isn\u2019t cheap, but if you want powerful, expansive, clear Dolby Atmos sound from a single inoffensively-designed soundbar, you can\u2019t do better for the price \u2013 as long as you\u2019re not tight on HDMI ports.\nYou can get a full surround setup for a similar price to this, but the core Sonos Arc Ultra is designed for people who don\u2019t want to deal with having four boxes including a hefty subwoofer. And I think it\u2019s the best, most cinematic single box you can add to your TV for the price, making it very strong value.\nBut as I say, if you\u2019re already filling your HDMI ports, that value is harmed, because the Arc Ultra may create a new problem for you. For the price, it should really offer you the solution.\n- Value score: 4 / 5\nShould I buy the Sonos Arc Ultra?\n| Section | Notes | Score |\n| Features | Great for connectivity and useful options, except no HDMI passthrough or DTS. | 4 / 5 |\n| Performance | Rich, full sound with excellent speech clarity and superb Dolby Atmos effects. | 5 / 5 |\n| Design | Good-looking, but some buttons on the back would be better on top. | 4 / 5 |\n| Setup & usability | Set up through the Sonos app, then it's plug and play \u2013 but some options are too hidden in the app. | 4 / 5 |\n| Value | Best-in-class value for sound, but held back by the lack of HDMI passthrough. | 4 / 5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou want the best sound from a single-unit soundbar\nAt this price, and without extra satellite speakers, nothing beats what the Sonos Arc Ultra can do.\nYou want clearer speech and Dolby Atmos cinematic effects\nThe Arc Ultra is a big step up over the Arc for dialogue, and boosts Dolby Atmos positioning skill at the same time.\nYou want Sonos' extra skills\nPart of a multi-room music system? Check. The ability to add other speakers in the future to improve the sound? Check. TruePlay room tuning? Sound check.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou're short on HDMI ports\nNo HDMI passthrough really could be a dealbreaker.\nYou want the best value sound and could have more than one box\nThe Sonos Arc Ultra is very good value for a one-box system, but if you can live with more hardware, you can get bigger sound for the price.\nYou're a home theater purist about DTS\nSonos' continued lack of DTS support will irk those those with physical media in DTS:X.\nSonos Arc Ultra review: Also consider\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 8\nWe didn't rave about this soundbar overall in our Sony Bravia Theater Bar 8 review, but it's cheaper than the Sonos Arc Ultra and offers 4K 120Hz HDMI passthrough, so it might be the most practical option for some people \u2013 or its more expensive sibling, the Sony Bravia Theater Bar 9 is the beefier-sounding option, but is pricier than the Sonos.\nSonos Beam 2\nWant to go even more compact and have Sonos' options for expansion? The Beam 2 delivers surprisingly full sound for such a compact soundbar, and supports Dolby Atmos, but not with anything like the effectiveness of the Arc Ultra. But it's half the price, so swings and roundabouts \u2013 definitely read our Sonos Beam 2 review if you want to know more.\nSamsung HW-Q990D\nLook, if you can find this full Dolby Atmos surround system for close to the Sonos Arc Ultra's price, know that it will give you a truly mind-blowing Dolby Atmos home theater experience \u2013 as long as you can live with four boxes instead of one. We gave it five stars in our Samsung HW-Q990D review.\nHow I tested the Sonos Arc Ultra\n- Tested over a week\n- Tested at home, in my usual setup\n- Tested with Sonos surround configurations\nFor the crucial portion of this review, I used the Sonos Arc Ultra at home, in the same setup where I usually use the original Sonos Arc, so I had a good point of direct comparison. I directly compared the sound of the two bars to gauge the difference, but mostly I just used the Sonos Arc Ultra for my normal viewing, which included 4K Blu-rays and streaming. I listened in both lossless quality and compressed, as well as in Dolby Atmos, regular 5.1 surround sound, and in stereo.\nAs mentioned above, I tested the Sonos Arc Ultra on its own mainly, but also tried it with the Sub 4, and then with the Sub 4 and different Sonos rear speaker options.\nI also tested a Sonos surround setup for a short time compared to the Samsung HW-Q990C in TechRadar's TV testing rooms. On our corporate Wi-Fi systems, I had connections problems that meant I couldn't do longer-term comparisons; at home, I use a Google Nest Home mesh Wi-Fi system and had no problems with the Sonos app or network connectivity.\n- First reviewed: November 2024\n- Read more about how we test\nMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Entertainment, meaning he's in charge of persuading our team of writers and reviewers to watch the latest TV shows and movies on gorgeous TVs and listen to fantastic speakers and headphones.

      "text": "The best cheap soundbars, all tested by our experts\nWe\u2019ve reviewed the best budget soundbars, from affordable Dolby Atmos models to super-cheap and simple sound upgrades, and here are our top picks\nThe best cheap soundbars offer you an easy way to get clearer, bolder sound from your TV than its built-in speakers are capable of. Small and budget TVs especially have very little effort and physical space given to their sound output, which often leaves the sound feeling thin, artificial and sometimes straight-up hard to hear.\nThe best cheap soundbars won't give a big home theater experience like the best soundbars at higher budgets, but they'll solve those problems \u2013 they'll make dialogue clearer, give movie soundtracks some extra thump, and deliver higher volumes without becoming grating and unpleasant. And we know this because we've tested every model we recommend here \u2013 along with plenty of others we haven't recommended that aren't as good.\nWhat are we classing as cheap soundbars? We're going from models that cost under $100/\u00a3100 up to $400/\u00a3300 for our top pick, the Sony HT-S2000. However, every model here is regularly discounted, and the Sony HT-2000 can be found for under $300 \u2013 our automatic price-finding tools on this page should help you find the lowest prices whenever you're looking.\nWe tested these cheap soundbars in the real world, in our homes, and in comparison to built-in TV speakers as well as each other \u2013 so these really are the choices that we're happy to live with ourselves.\nThe quick list\nHere's our quick run-down of the best budget soundbars, based on our testing \u2013 all with different needs in mind. You can click through for a more in-depth write-up for any of them.\nBest overall\nThe best cheap soundbar overall\nThis powerful and well-featured soundbar offers Dolby Atmos and DTS:X for impressive and full-ranged spatial sound. Excellent value.\nBest super-cheap (US)\nThe best super-cheap soundbar in the US\nA real surprise of a budget soundbar. Cheap, small and packing plenty of volume, the strong built-in bass and hint of 3D audio are bonuses.\nBest super-cheap (UK)\nThe best super-cheap soundbar in the UK\nA very solid soundbar that impresses with super-clear voices, though the bass is thin. Ideal if extra clarity is what you want most.\nBest surround sound\nThe best cheap soundbar with surround sound\nThe Poseidon D50 delivers good results with real surround sound at a pleasing price. Full rear sound costing this little is not to be sniffed at.\nBest for music\nThe best cheap soundbar for music\nA compact, attractively-designed soundbar that's tuned just as well for music as it is for movies \u2013 a rarity at this kind of price.\nI oversee TechRadar's TV, audio and streaming channels, and I've been in tech publishing for over 15 years. I've written about the latest soundbars and TV audio since 2017 (including filling my entire house with soundbases at one point, causing severe logistical issues), and I have strong opinions about everything in them from the use of center channels to the number of HDMI ports.\n24 January 2025\nTotally overhauled our old budget soundbars recommendations with this new-look guide, based on our latest reviews.\nThe best cheap soundbars: the list\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best cheap soundbar overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want big Dolby Atmos sound: The Sony HT-S2000 delivers quality Dolby Atmos for a budget soundbar, producing convincing height and width.\n\u2705 You want a compact design: The HT-2000 has full sound, but doesn't require a separate subwoofer, and works for mid-size TVs as well as larger ones.\n\u274c You want flexible music streaming: As it doesn\u2019t support Wi-Fi, you sadly can\u2019t link the HT-2000 to a multi-room speaker system.\n\u274c You want big bass out of the box: The HT-S2000's sound is meaty, but can't match a dedicated sub \u2013 but you can add one (and rear speakers) optionally.\nWhat you need to know: By striking just the right balance between impressive sound quality, strong Dolby Atmos performance and at a more than reasonable price point, there's no better-value affordable soundbar than the Sony HT-S2000 in our book. Comfortably superior to pretty much all built-in TV speakers (and definitely all budget or mid-range TVs), Sony\u2019s soundbar is terrific value for money, which is why we can quite easily look past its very limited issues.\nAudio performance: The audio the 3.1-channel Sony HT-S2000 produces sound that can full small and mid-size rooms, though it may struggled in big rooms. Its clear strengths are the sharp and clear dialogue it delivers, while we\u2019re also big fans of its virtual surround sound that does a good job of mimicking a multi-speaker setup. Dolby Atmos performance also punches well above its weight for the money Sony is asking for the HT-S2000, and bass levels are also pleasingly punchy \u2013 though not at the level a dedicated subwoofer delivers.\nDesign: Our favorite design feature of the HT-S2000? That would have to be the cool visual feedback you get when using its remote control (a feature that\u2019s rarely seen in budget soundbars). On top of that, the general look of this bar is assured, and we\u2019re quite taken with its sturdy metal grill on its front. The sturdy plastic casing that houses its speakers also feels reasonably premium for a cheap soundbar.\nValue: While it obviously can\u2019t quite cut the mustard against more premium soundbars, the HT-2000 provides excellent value at around $349 / \u00a3299 /AU$695. The fact it hands in confident Dolby Atmos performance is what just edges it as our favorite cheap soundbar of the moment.\nRead our full Sony HT-S2000 review\nThe best super-cheap soundbar in the US\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need to save cash: Getting this level of sound quality at such an attractive price isn\u2019t easy, so if you\u2019re on a limited budget this is a great option.\n\u2705 You want plenty of volume: Though the Naga 60 isn\u2019t going to pop your eardrums like more expensive bars, it does get pleasingly noisy.\n\u274c You have limited HDMI ports: Though the Majority Naga 60 has HDMI ARC, HDMI passthrough doesn\u2019t make the cut, which is a shame.\n\u274c You want detail at loud levels: The Naga can go loud, but you'll hit the limits of the speakers' responsiveness \u2013 best for short bursts, not constant loud use.\nWhat you need to know: Officially priced at $65 but often found on sale for less than $50, the Majority Naga 60 is almost absurdly cheap. Normally, budget soundbars selling at the most affordable level like this would be blighted by subpar audio, yet that\u2019s simply not the case with the Naga 60. Capable of surprisingly clear \u2013 not to mention loud \u2013 sound, the fact it comes with a built-in bass system and 3D audio support round off a quality soundbar that belies its meager price.\nAudio performance: The Majority Naga 60 is ideally suited to pair with a second/bedroom TV, because you\u2019ll notice a significant jump in quality over your set\u2019s speakers. Does the Naga 60\u2019s audio dip in quality played at its highest volume? A little. But at this price, that\u2019s a relatively minor quibble we can overlook. This soundbar\u2019s outward-pointing tweeters power the Naga 60\u2019s admittedly limited 3D audio processing, yet it\u2019s still nice that such a cheap bar has this feature in the first place. With defined and clear highs and a reasonably full-bodied mid-range performance, there\u2019s quite a lot to like about the Naga 60\u2019s audio performance, even if it obviously lack detail and soundstaging compared to more expensive soundbars.\nDesign: The Majority Naga 60 has a basic, no-frills design with four top surface control buttons that let you tweak the soundbar\u2019s volume and turn it on or off. Though it may look basic, it hides a small subwoofer and side-firing tweeters under that workmanlike shell. It also sports a relatively generous variety of connections on its rear, including an HDMI ARC, optical digital port, 3.5mm analog audio input and separate subwoofer output.\nValue: At just $65, the Majority Naga 60 offers superb value for money. If you\u2019re looking for a solid 2.1-channel soundbar that offers an effort at 3D audio at a super-affordable price, there\u2019s plenty to love about the Naga 60 despite some audio shortcomings.\nRead our full Majority Naga 60 review\nThe best super-cheap soundbar in the UK\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want clear vocals: Vocals are delivered with real clarity when watching TV shows and movies, which adds to immersion.\n\u2705 You\u2019re working with a budget: Seeing as many budget soundbars still come in at well over \u00a3100 in the UK, this is a great choice if you need to save pennies.\n\u274c Bass matters to you: This is one bar that definitely won\u2019t boom, boom shake the room, Big Willy style.\n\u274c You want surround sound: This budget bar skimps on Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, so if you\u2019re craving a cinema-style soundscape, you should look elsewhere.\nWhat you need to know: An aggressively priced, full-sized soundbar that you can often find for \u00a379 or under, making this one of the best cheap bars for UK buyers. Alright, so the sound quality of the Panasonic SC-HTB100 isn\u2019t exactly mind-blowing, yet it\u2019s more than respectable when it\u2019s going for such a bank balance-friendly price tag. And the SC-HTB100\u2019s biggest strength? It\u2019s confident clarity when it comes to handling voices, which is what a lot of us want most compared to budget TV speakers.\nAudio performance: At such an affordable price point, it\u2019s tough to overly grumble over this soundbar\u2019s lack of support for Dolby Atmos or DTS:X. Considering it\u2019s a 2.0-channel bar, it also lacks a subwoofer or rear speakers. Still, its three main EQ modes \u2013 Movie, News and Music \u2013 provide well-rounded sounds, whether you\u2019re watching your favorite blockbuster on a 4K Blu-ray or catching up with the latest (no doubt gloomy) breaking headlines. Sure, bass isn\u2019t going to shake your room like the T.rex approaching in Jurassic Park, but speech is handled with impressive clarity.\nDesign: While the Panasonic SC-HTB100 is far from ugly, it has some design flaws (such as its slightly plasticky outer casing) that can prove distracting. But the worst aesthetic offender? That would be the underwhelming front display on this soundbar. Instead of a full LED display, Panasonic has gone with a difficult to make out and annoyingly small LED light that requires you to read the manual front and back to get a good grip on its functions. And while the included remote is welcome, the buttons are a little sluggish, especially when trying to tinker with the soundbar\u2019s volume.\nValue: There\u2019s a lot to commend about this sub-\u00a3100 soundbar. On the audio front, you\u2019re unlikely to feel short changed if you pick up the Panasonic SC-HTB100. Vocals are clear, connectivity options are fairly impressive, it\u2019s easy to set up, and its three main sound modes do a decent job whether you\u2019re listening to music or watching your favorite flicks. Build quality feels a little cheap, but overall this bar represents good value.\nRead our full Panasonic SC-HTB100 review\nThe best cheap soundbar for surround sound\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want cheap surround sound: This offers a commendable surround experience thanks to its subwoofer and dual rear speakers.\n\u2705 You crave a bigger sound than your TV can provide: Compared to your TV\u2019s speakers, the Poseidon D50 offers superior bass that adds real boom to movies.\n\u274c You consider yourself an audiophile: Nabbing a 5.1 soundbar system at this price is great, but sound quality can\u2019t match more premium bars.\n\u274c You\u2019re pining for Dolby Atmos. If spatial audio is a priority, look elsewhere \u2013 though at this price, you wouldn't get much from Atmos anyway.\nWhat you need to know: A four-box soundbar system that provides plenty of bang for your buck. Though it\u2019s not all that fancy, the surround sound it offers at such an ultra-low price point isn\u2019t to be taken for granted. Though general audio could use a bit of a bass boost, it's way beyond what cheaper TVs can provide. It has an easy setup process, and once you\u2019ve got it going, proves itself a good performer across movies, TV shows and games.\nAudio performance: Like every other soundbar on this list the Ultimea Poseidon D50 offers a superior audio experience than you\u2019re likely to get from your TV\u2019s speakers. Also, the fact it has a name that evokes a 1970s disaster flick is a big bonus. Thanks to its claimed 400W power output, it packs considerable oomph that offers both a meaty and wide soundscape. A lack of Dolby Atmos or DTS: X means spatial audio is off the table, yet its Ultimea BassMax tech provides decent bass levels. Alright, so the rear speakers are a tad quiet, yet the Poseidon D5 still provides a commendable surround sound package for folks on a budget.\nDesign: The Ultimea Poseidon D50 is roughly as sexy as a celery salad\u2026 though that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s flatout ugly. Though it\u2019s on the cheap-looking side, it certainly doesn\u2019t look bad for a budget piece of audio tech. While it looks more plasticky than we\u2019d like, the fact it comes with a remote (even if Ultimea skimps on the batteries) is appreciated.\nValue: If you\u2019re in the market for a super-budget 5.1 soundbar, you can't do better than the Ultimea Poseidon D50. Its surround sound is more than adequate and despite lacking Dolby Atmos support and not boasting the beast rear speakers, we'd still say it's a strong $129 / \u00a399 / AU$180 surround sound bar.\nRead our full Ultimea Poseidon D50 review\nThe best cheap soundbar for music\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You love listening to music too: Delivering clear vocals and surprising bass, the Sonos Ray will make your favorite tunes shine thanks to its well-balanced audio.\n\u2705 You want a small soundbar: If you want a soundbar to pair with a more modestly sized TV, the compact Ray is a great option to go for.\n\u274c You want a HDMI ARC connection: This only uses optical digital, which works great, but may mean a little more setup on your TV.\n\u274c You want Dolby Atmos positional sound: The Sonos Ray doesn't any real spatial processing \u2013 you'd have to step up to the Sonos Beam for that.\nWhat you need to know: The cheapest soundbar Sonos currently makes, the Ray is gorgeous and compact, and will deliver a massive upgrade on your TV\u2019s built-in speakers. Though it\u2019s a shame there\u2019s no HDMI ARC port, but the fact it uses an optical digital connection ensures it will work with any remotely modern TV \u2013 but means its volume isn't automatically controlled by your TV. However, Sonos' setup process adds remote control setup as part of its steps, and it was fast and seamless for us, and then you never think about it again. Its four-speaker driver setup and bass ports deliver clear, impactful dialogue and power for movies, but are also excellent with tunes, unlike most soundbars here. The fact the Ray is so small also makes it a great choice to pair with a TV from 24 to 55 inches.\nAudio performance: While it\u2019s a shame the Sonos Ray doesn\u2019t support Dolby Atmos like the more expensive Sonos Arc Ultra and Sonos Beam (Gen 2), it still delivers the sort of top-tier sound quality you\u2019d expect from Sonos. The Ray\u2019s two drivers provide width to this little bar\u2019s soundscape, and when it comes to listening to music or squeezing the most out of an epic movie soundtrack, the Ray absolutely shines. This pocket rocket delivers full and bassy audio that also provides clarity from angles. It's so well-balanced, delivering impressive low-end as well as solid treble performance \u2013 instruments pop and dialogue is detailed, ensuring the Ray is a great choice for listening to basically anything.\nDesign: Available in either black or white, the Sonos Ray is understated and solidly constructed. Its flat front grille is mercifully resistant to dust and its touch controls on the top of the soundbar make using the Ray as a smart Sonos speaker a doddle when you want to tweak the volume of your tunes or pause them mid-action. The Ray is unfussy and adorably proportioned.\nValue: The Sonos Ray provides good value for money\u2026 just not quite great value at $169 / \u00a3149 / AU$250. Cheaper rivals offer HDMI connections, and this may frustrate some people. And if you\u2019re looking for Dolby Atmos support and can spare a little more money, the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) might be a better option. When it comes to playing music, though, you won\u2019t find a better cheap soundbar.\nRead our full Sonos Ray review\nHow to choose the best cheap soundbar for you\nWhen it comes to buying one of the best cheap soundbars, as clich\u00e9d as it sounds, beggars can\u2019t afford to be choosers \u2013 but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to abandon hope of good sound quality. It's just about prioritisation.\nThe key factors to consider are size, features and connectivity. If you own a TV that\u2019s less than 42 inches, you\u2019ll want a compact bar. After all, there\u2019s no point in owning a soundbar that\u2019s wider than your TV.\nThe next consideration should be whether you want surround sound tech, such as rear speakers, or Dolby Atmos support. Atmos should be considered optional \u2013 it requires additional speakers and processing to do well, and having it in a bar that can't really do anything with the positional audio data won't improve anything. But some budget bars can get good effects out of it.\nConnectivity is the other major factor. Though once again, when you\u2019re dealing with a limited budget, you can\u2019t be too choosy. Ideally, you want a bar with HDMI ARC (audio return channel), but as you go down the price bracket, this becomes less common. The advantage of it is high-quality sound and the bar will be automatically controlled by your TV's remote over the cable \u2013 and this is necessary for Dolby Atmos. Soundbars that don't have this will use an optical digital connection, which is high-quality, but doesn't have the smarts and simplicity of HDMI \u2013 to control the soundbar's volume with your TV remote, you'd need an infrared learning process.\nDesign should probably be your least important consideration when choosing a cheap soundbar, but obviously it does matter to people. Most will be plain black lozenges, though \u2013 it's usually a matter of build quality. We think if you focus on sound first, most of these devices will just disappear the way they're meant to.\nHow we test the best cheap soundbars\nWe've tested all of these soundbars ourselves, and we tested them in real-world conditions \u2013 ie, in the homes of our writers, where we can use them day-in and day-out to get a feel for what they're really like to live with, and to compare with the speakers of TVs to see how much of an improvement they are.\nOur testers have experience with soundbars of all different kinds, ranging from powerful Dolby Atmos beasts to super-small and cheap options, so they know which budget soundbars cheaped out too far and aren't worth the price, and which actually offer a good-value upgrade.\nWe test the soundbars with all the things people usually watch \u2013 big bold movies, quiet dramas, talk TV, and music \u2013 and make notes of where they stand out, and where they might muddy things. For example, dialogue might actually be less clear than a TV's built-in speakers, or they might struggle with clarity when turned way up due to limited amplification or speaker size.\nWe also run through the whole setup process to see how it works, including any extra features that are promised, and how easy they are to use. If they connect to devices other than the TV, such as Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for music streaming, we'll test that too, since it can often have a very different sound balance compared to an HDMI or optical digital connection.\nLatest updates to this guide\n24 January 2025\nTotally overhauled our old budget soundbars recommendations with this new-look guide, based on our latest reviews.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nMatt is TechRadar's Managing Editor for Entertainment, meaning he's in charge of persuading our team of writers and reviewers to watch the latest TV shows and movies on gorgeous TVs and listen to fantastic speakers and headphones.

      "text": "The best soundbars for all budgets, all tested by us\nWe've tested everything from elite Dolby Atmos soundbars to cheap and simple TV sound upgrades, and these are the best.\n- Quick list\n- Best overall\n- Best budget\n- Best all-in-one soundbar\n- Best for Dolby Atmos\n- Best budget Atmos surround\n- Best super-cheap surround sound\n- Best super-cheap\n- Best premium for LG TVs\n- Best compact Atmos\n- Best for flexibility\n- Best for expandability\n- Best for wall-mounting\n- Comparison chart\n- How to choose\n- Also consider\n- New soundbars for 2025\n- How we test\n- Latest updates\nOne of the best soundbars is essential if you\u2019ve invested in a big TV and its speakers aren\u2019t living up to its visuals. With one of the top soundbars, you get bigger, forward-facing speakers that deliver better speech clarity and immersion in movies. The best bit is they\u2019re sleek and slim, often fitting below your TV on a cabinet, or mounted on the wall.\nSome TVs may not need a soundbar, but plenty of the best TVs you can buy today benefit hugely from an external soundbar for better audio \u2013 especially cheaper ones. The best soundbars tend to come in three styles: all-in-one units with just a single soundbar, soundbars with subwoofers, and soundbars with subwoofers and rear speakers for surround sound. The first is ideal for people who want a minimal setup, the second is great for big sound on a budget, and the third is perfect if you want a real home theater audio experience.\nWe\u2019ve tested a huge number of soundbars and speaker systems over the years, ranging from elite units with Dolby Atmos 3D sound, through to bargain soundbars that boost speech and add depth for very little cash. We're looking for natural sound in all cases that doesn't come across as overblown, and where individual effects can stand out from the overall mix. We want to see ease of use too, no matter how many different speakers are included and in the case of higher-end soundbars we're looking for extra features such as wireless support and HDMI passthrough (including at 4K 120Hz) to justify the pricing.\nSome soundbars include extra features when used with a particular TV, so we'll highlight those where appropriate, and we do test them \u2013 but they don't make or break our recommendations. We test soundbars as if you're buying them as a neutral, so you can get a great upgrade no matter what TV brand you have.\nThe quick list\nIn a hurry but need to find the best soundbar for you? Take a look at our quick list below which covers a soundbar that will suit every budget and situation. You can still check out more detailed reviews of each soundbar below.\nBest overall\nThe best soundbar for most people\nThe Samsung HW-Q800D offers great cinematic sound, Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support at a strong price, for a great range of screen sizes, with HDMI passthrough. A great all-rounder.\nBest budget\nThe best budget soundbar\nIf you're looking to get immersive Dolby Atmos support on a budget, the Sony HT-S2000 is a no-brainer \u2013 a high-quality soundbar for a low price. It's also compact, and doesn't need space for a separate subwoofer.\nBest all-in-one soundbar\nThe best one-box soundbar\nThis offers amazingly cinematic sound without a big separate subwoofer and has superb Dolby Atmos effects. If you want a high-quality sound from a well-priced all-in-one, this is the best.\nBest Atmos surround\nThe best soundbar for Dolby Atmos surround\nThe Samsung HW-Q990F delivers real power and immersion and is the best soundbar for the full Atmos experience, with rear speakers and hefty bass from its newly designed, compact subwoofer.\nBest budget Atmos surround\nThe best budget soundbar for Dolby Atmos surround\nHisense\u2019s system packs a pair of wireless surrounds and a subwoofer, and it delivers real Dolby Atmos using up-firing speakers \u2013 all for a stunningly low price.

Removed the Sony HT-A7000 and 'best for gaming' category. Added in a table with scores for each soundbar on this list labelled 'Comparison Chart'. Updated 'Other soundbars to consider' and 'New for 2025' sections.\nThe best soundbars you can buy\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nThe best soundbar overall\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want the best-value soundbar: The Q800D delivers a dynamic and punchy sound with impressive Dolby Atmos positional effect for a very good price.\n\u2705 You want a powerful sound: The Q800D is imposing, powerful and immersive, despite being limited to a soundbar and subwoofer in-the-box.\n\u274c You're after 4K 120Hz passthrough: If you have a next-gen console such as a PS5, you'll have to look at other soundbars for 4K 120Hz passthrough.\n\u274c You own the Samsung HW-Q800C: The Q800D doesn't offer much in the way of upgrades over its predecessor, the Samsung HW-Q800C, so if you own the latter, there's no point in upgrading.\nWhat you need to know: The Samsung HW-Q800D is the mid-range soundbar in Samsung's 2024 soundbar lineup, but it delivers a premium performance for the price. It delivers 5.1.2 channels, totaling 360W of power for a sound that's dynamic, engaging and downright impressive. It supports Dolby Atmos and DTS:X surround formats as well as Samsung-centric features such as Q-Symphony, which uses the speakers of compatible Samsung TVs for extra immersion. It also supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for audio streaming. It also has gaming features, but does unfortunately lack 4K 120Hz passthrough to make the most out of consoles. But this is one of the very few downsides to a fantastic soundbar, and it won't matter to everyone, anyway.\nAudio performance: When we heard the Q800D in action, we were blown away by just how sonically impressive it is. A rich, expansive and powerful sound comes through the Q800D, whether its movies or video games. Dolby Atmos and DTS:X surround is immersive, engaging and fully-fledged, which is impressive for a soundbar comprised of two units (a soundbar and subwoofer). Its wide soundstage also means it handles music well, which is no guarantee with soundbars.\nDesign: In terms of looks, the HW-Q800D isn't very visually appealing, with a chunky design and angular look that some find dull. But, it does have a solid build quality and a metal mesh grille that make it feel more premium. While you can get better-looking soundbars, the Q800D is still a perfectly fine looking soundbar.\nValue: The Q800D is exceptional value and while it's not going to beat the likes of the more premium Samsung HW-Q990D in terms of sheer power, #4 on this list, or the Sonos Arc Ultra for looks, #3 on this list, it delivers a level of quality and performance way above its price range. So, it's no wonder that it's easily the best soundbar on the market for most people.\nRead our full Samsung HW-Q800D review\nThe best budget soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want an affordable soundbar: The Sony HT-S2000 launched with a higher price than the next cheapest offering at #7 in this list but is now regularly reduced for less.\n\u2705 You want immersive sound: The HT-S2000 offers 3.1 channels of surprisingly powerful sound, with support for virtual Dolby Atmos, for a reasonable price.\n\u274c You own a next-gen console like a PS5: Without 4K 120Hz passthrough, the HT-S2000 isn't the best for gamers. Instead look at #5 in this list.\n\u274c You want a home audio system: The HT-S2000 does not have Wi-Fi so you won't be able to link it up to a multi-room wireless speaker system.\nWhat you need to know: When it comes to sound quality and features vs price, we think the Sony HT-S2000 is the best budget choice around. Although it's a little basic in terms of connectivity, the sound you get from this soundbar is impressive for the money and is certainly a good choice for those looking for an upgrade to their TV sound without breaking the bank.\nAudio performance: While the Sony HT-S2000's sound isn't the biggest, the sound you do get for your money is impressive. Clear dialogue levels and a spacious, virtual surround sound are two of the HT-S2000's highlights. Bass levels are also punchy enough, but it's the Sony HT-S2000's ability to reproduce Dolby Atmos effects that's surprising. It's not going to beat a soundbar with height channels, but for a 3.1 soundbar, it offers plenty.\nDesign: Design wise, the Sony HT-S2000 feels and looks more expensive than it is, with a solid, mesh metal grill on the front and a sturdy black plastic casing housing the speakers. The soundbar also produces visual feedback to remote control commands, something rare on budget soundbars.\nValue: Yes, the HT-S2000 isn't going to set the world alight with its sound and certainly isn't the best soundbar for sound on this list, but when you're paying roughly $349 / \u00a3299 / AU$695 for a soundbar with this good a sound quality, it's hard to argue against.\nRead our full Sony HT-S2000 review\nThe best all-in-one soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want expansive sound from an all-in-one: The Heston 120\u2019s 5.1.2-channel speaker array delivers surprisingly immersive audio and deep bass for an all-in-one unit\n\u2705 You want a unique design: With its guitar-amp-like looks, the Heston 120\u2019s design is certainly unique, making it stand out from the sea of boring, black soundbars.\n\u274c You want the best surround-sound experience: One-box offerings like the Heston 120 can only simulate a true surround experience. You\u2019ll need actual surround speakers to get the real deal.\n\u274c You\u2019re on a tight budget: There are more budget-friendly options that can provide a satisfactory Dolby Atmos experience for less money.\nWhat you need to know: The Marshall Heston 120 is the best all-in-one soundbar you can buy for its asking price. The other soundbars in this list feature additional surround speakers and a subwoofer to deliver a cinematic sound experience, or they skimp out on immersion and bass by opting for a limited speaker array and compact design. The Heston 120, in contrast, features a 5.1.2-channel speaker array with dual active woofers and four passive radiators. With support for both Dolby Atmos and DTS:X soundtracks, the presentation is impressively wide and tall for an all-in-one, and there\u2019s no shortage of deep, powerful bass.\nAudio performance: The Heston 120\u2019s booming bass filled our TV testing facility when we reviewed it, and even managed to convey deep sub-bass in Atmos movie soundtracks. Height and surround effects are conveyed with spatial precision, which lends a true sense of realism to the proceedings, and we even got a sense of sound moving past our shoulder when we tested it. The same qualities that make the Heston 120 great for movies also work for Atmos and stereo music playback. Stereo music in particular sounds smooth and has clear channel separation \u2013 a rare feat for an all-in-one soundbar.\nDesign: Marshall\u2019s design for the Heston 120 unsurprisingly mimics that of its famous guitar amps, with big, golden-hued metallic control knobs, and a white Marshall logo plastered across the front. It\u2019s surely making a statement in the otherwise bland, black world of soundbar design, and those extra elements can be visually distracting when watching movies in dimmed lighting. Bottom line: you\u2019ll either love the design or you won\u2019t. At over a meter in width, the Heston 120 is also on the large side for a soundbar, and there\u2019s no remote control option outside of Marshall\u2019s app, which provides everything you need to get this soundbar up and running.\nValue: At $999 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,799, the Heston 120 is undoubtedly pricey, and you\u2019ll pay the same price for the also impressive Sonos Arc Ultra, our choice as the best option for expandability in this guide. But the Heston 120\u2019s build quality, performance, and features make it a solid, if not exceptional, value, especially if you\u2019re interested in an all-in-one bar that doesn\u2019t make any sonic compromises.\nRead our full Marshall Heston 120 review\nThe best soundbar for Dolby Atmos\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want immersive surround sound: The Q990F delivers a fully immersive, powerful, and tightly controlled sound that not many other soundbar systems can compete with.\n\u2705 You want a compact subwoofer that doesn't compromise: The Q990F's newly designed compact subwoofer is easier to hide, but doesn't skimp on sheer power and control.\n\u274c You're on a budget: The Q990F is a premium soundbar system that unavoidably costs more than budget Dolby Atmos soundbars like #4 in this list.\n\u274c You own the Samsung HW-Q990D: While the Q990F's new subwoofer is great, elsewhere the Q990F is only a slight upgrade over its predecessor, the Q990D.\nWhat you need to know: Samsung\u2019s Q990F is a complete surround sound system in a soundbar package. It has 23 drivers spread across 11.1.4 channels and comprises four units: a soundbar, a subwoofer, and two rear speakers. It delivers engaging, expansive and punchy sound, as well as 4K 120Hz pass-through support for gaming consoles.\nAudio performance: Dolby Atmos soundtracks are reproduced with superb precision and pinpoint accuracy, putting you right into the heart of the action. Speech is clean and clear, and its newly designed, smaller subwoofer doesn't skip out on bass, delivering plenty of hefty rumble while still maintaining control and nuance. Q-Symphony is a bonus for Samsung TV owners, adding even more speakers to the action.\nDesign: The headline here is the newly designed, compact subwoofer, which is sleeker, sharper and much more versatile in terms of space. The Q990F has a similar matte gray/navy finish to its predecessors for a minimalist look, but uses a grille design that isn't as appealing as its predecessors. Still, it has a premium look and feel with a reassuring heft. Its front display continues to be difficult to read, however\nValue: A soundbar system that's this powerful and complete necessarily comes with a high price tag. And while we think that the Q990F's performance justifies the price, you can save some money by picking up its predecessor, the Q990D. Or if you're looking for a budget alternative, check out the Hisense AX5125H at #5 in this list for a cheaper Atmos alternative.\nRead our full Samsung HW-Q990F review\nThe best budget soundbar for Dolby Atmos surround\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want 'real' Atmos sound\nWith 5.1.2 channels, including two surround and two up-firing Atmos speakers, you're getting actual immersive sound rather than virtual processing.\n\u2705 You want to save money\nAt around $350 / \u00a3350 / AU$449, you\u2019re getting a full surround sound speaker package with a subwoofer for the price of many standalone soundbars.\n\u274c You want high-quality music playback\nHisense\u2019s budget bar uses Bluetooth exclusively for music streaming, and that\u2019s a lower-quality option than the Wi-Fi tech used by other soundbars like the Sonos Beam.\n\u274c You want to experiment with EQ\nWhile the Hisense has preset sound modes plus bass and treble controls, its sound adjustments are very basic compared to other soundbars that offer extensive EQ settings and room correction using apps.\nWhat you need to know: The Hisense AX5125H is a 5.1.2-channel Dolby Atmos soundbar system with a wireless subwoofer and surround speakers that sells for under $350 / \u00a3350 / AU$450. What you\u2019re getting here kit-wise for the money is pretty much unbeatable considering the system\u2019s punchy sound and \u201creal\u201d as opposed to virtual, Dolby Atmos effects delivery.\nAudio performance: Hisense\u2019s budget soundbar system punches well above its price class when it comes to sound quality, with clear dialogue, accurate effects placement and good surround immersion. Even music sounds good, though, streaming is limited to Bluetooth quality. The one complaint we have about its sound is that the compact rear speakers can occasionally get overwhelmed by aggressive surround sound mixes.\nDesign: The AX5125H\u2019s build quality falls short of premium \u2013 something to be expected at this price \u2013 though its metal mesh speaker grilles give it a somewhat upscale look. Importantly, the soundbar has a front panel alphanumeric LED display, which provides clear visual feedback when making volume or EQ adjustments with the system\u2019s remote control.\nValue: Given its low price for a 5.1.2-channel soundbar system, the Hisense AX5125H\u2019s value is almost over the top. You\u2019ll pay more than four times as much for the Best soundbar for Dolby Atmos choice on our list, the Samsung HW-Q990D, and while that 11.1.4-channel system will undoubtedly provide a greater sense of sound immersion, many people will be satisfied with the Hisense\u2019s sound for the money.\nRead our full Hisense AX5125H review\nThe best super-cheap soundbar for surround sound\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want surround sound for cheap: The Poseidon D50 offers 5.1 channels of clear, punchy sound for cheaper than most soundbars.\n\u2705 You want a straightforward soundbar: The Poseidon D50 opts for a no-nonsense, plug-in-and-play approach over apps and features.\n\u274c You want the best quality sound: The Poseidon D50's sound can be tinny at times, and rear speakers can get lost in the mix.\n\u274c You want the best looking soundbar: Unsurprisingly, the Poseidon D50 has a plain, plasticky look due to its super-cheap price.\nThe Ultimea Poseidon D50 is the best way to get surround sound for your living room for a low price. Its sound may not be the most dynamic and it's light on features, but at such a low price for a full 5.1 system, it's hard to argue against what it does deliver: clear, punchy and occasionally spacious audio.\nIn our review of the Ultimea Poseidon D50, we enjoyed its clarity of speech and relatively punchy, powerful surround sound. While watching Top Gun: Maverick, we were \"impressed at the three-dimensional sound of soaring aircraft\", especially considering the lack of Dolby Atmos. While the Poseidon D50 doesn't deliver the most cinematic of experiences, with audio sometimes veering on tinny and the rear speakers sometimes struggling to keep up, we said \"for the price you pay, the surround sound certainly surpassed expectations\" and that's all we ask for from this cheap soundbar.\nLight on features due to its budget price, including a lack of Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support (check out the Hisense AX5125H further up the list for a budget Atmos surround soundbar), the Poseidon D50 does still support Bluetooth streaming for music and come with HDMI ARC, optical and 3.5mm ports for connections. There are also three distinct sound modes \u2013 Movie, Dialog and Music \u2013 to cater to what you're watching.\nUltimately, you get what you pay for, and the Ultimea Poseidon D50 delivers solid (but not mind-blowing) surround sound for under $150 / \u00a3150 (we've seen it as low as $119 / \u00a3139). At that price, it's difficult to be disappointed in the Poseidon D50. If you want surround sound for cheap, the Poseidon D50 should be on your list.\nRead our full Ultimea Poseidon D50 review\nThe best super-cheap soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a cheap, but good soundbar: A 2.0-channel soundbar like this is an easy way to upgrade your TV\u2019s sound without incurring a high cost.\n\u2705 You want easy setup: The limited features of Amazon\u2019s soundbar are a benefit if you\u2019re looking for a super-easy model to connect, set up, and use.\n\u274c You want Dolby Atmos support: Dolby Atmos support generally isn\u2019t available on low-cost soundbars like Amazon\u2019s. To get that feature, you\u2019ll need to step up to the Sony HT-S2000, the best budget model on our list.\n\u274c You want bass: The Amazon\u2019s compact design doesn\u2019t permit much in the way of bass, so if that\u2019s important, look for a different model with a separate subwoofer.\nWhat you need to know: Amazon\u2019s first and only soundbar is a basic, compact model that delivers decent sound quality for the price. A 2.0-channel design, it keeps things simple by limiting wired connections to a single HDMI input for a hookup to a TV\u2019s HDMI eARC/ARC port, along with an optical digital connection. Bluetooth is additionally supported for wireless music streaming from a phone or tablet.\nAlthough Amazon\u2019s soundbar lacks Dolby Atmos support, it has Movie, Music and dialogue-boosting EQ modes as well as DTS Virtual:X processing to add a spacious quality to surround-encoded soundtracks. There\u2019s no front-panel alphanumeric display to provide visual feedback \u2013 something you wouldn\u2019t expect to see in a soundbar at this price \u2013 but ergonomics are otherwise good, and with limited connections and features, setup of Amazon\u2019s soundbar is incredibly easy.\nThe Amazon Fire TV soundbar\u2019s main selling point is its price. Amazon lists it for $119.99 / \u00a3199.99 on its site, but regularly lets it go for under $100 in the US. If you\u2019re looking for a basic, super-cheap bar that does a decent job and is easy to set up, Amazon\u2019s soundbar is the one we\u2019d recommend.\nAudio performance: While you can\u2019t expect a 2-channel soundbar like this to work magic with movie soundtracks, Amazon\u2019s bar will provide an instant upgrade over your TV\u2019s built-in speakers, boosting dialogue clarity and adding heft to sound effects. In our review, we found it provided the best sound balance with the Bass setting at Medium, which made voices sound natural and not overly heavy. DTS Virtual:X processing was effective at amping up movie soundtracks and did so without any negative effect to other elements in the mix.\nDesign: At 24 inches wide by 2.5 inches high and 3.5 inches deep, Amazon\u2019s compact soundbar is a good match for smaller TVs. A row of control buttons is provided on top and a remote control is also included. The main design limitation is the LED indicator lights instead of an alphanumeric display for visual feedback, which is common at this price point.\nValue: Given the sound quality, effortless usability, and sturdy design of Amazon\u2019s Fire TV soundbar, it\u2019s a great value and easy recommendation. You\u2019ll have to spend several hundred more to get better performance and features, and many people will be perfectly satisfied with Amazon\u2019s low-budget bar.\nRead our full Amazon Fire TV soundbar review\nThe best premium soundbar for LG TVs\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want immersive, home theater sound: With 9.1.5 channels here along with AI room calibration, you're in for a surround sound treat.\n\u2705 You have an LG TV: It works well whatever you pair it with, but you get access to better features with certain models of LG TVs.\n\u274c You don't have much space: This soundbar system is large, so if you don't have room to spare opt for a smaller alternative like #5 in this list.\n\u274c You're saving money: This isn't a budget buy. You'll have to make sacrifices, but you can find a similar soundbar for less. Check out #2 in this list.\nWhat you need to know: The LG S95TR brings you the convenience and straightforward setup of a soundbar system but with the immersive power and performance of a home theater speaker setup. It works well with everything, but LG TV owners can unlock the best features. The only thing that lets it down a little is its high price. If you're on a budget but still want Atmos and surround sound, take a look at our cheap soundbar pick, the Hisense AX5125H at #4 in this list. But if you can afford it, the features, performance and design of the LG S95TR make it worth every penny.\nAudio performance: With this soundbar's 9.1.5 channels, along with some very impressive AI room calibration, you'll experience a great home theater setup with surround sound and spatial audio (Dolby Atmos and DTS:X). In our review, we described the sound on offer here as \"immersive, engrossing, and engaging\" and with 810 watts of power, the LG S95TR can reach great volumes.\nDesign: This soundbar looks very basic with a subwoofer and two wedge-shaped rear speakers. Unfortunately, there's no LED display, just LED indicator lights, which is disappointing considering how many features are on offer here. You'll need to open LG's control app to find what you need, which is a little annoying. This is also a big system. So if you want to put it in a small room, it might not be the best choice for you.\nValue: The LG S95TR\u2019s $1,499 / AU$1,699 (about \u00a31,200) price feels expensive, but when you compare it with the competition, the fact you're getting a 9.1.5-channel system and the performance on offer here, it's still good value. If you want real surround sound, check out #3 in this list, the Samsung HW-Q990D.\nRead our full LG S95TR review\nThe best compact Atmos soundbar\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want great sound from a standalone soundbar: The Smart Soundbar delivers the Bose audio quality one expects. The bass and soundstage width are a bit light, but clarity and dynamics are good.\n\u2705 You want real Dolby Atmos: The soundbar\u2019s two upward-firing speakers let it deliver a real spatial audio experience. Also, a TrueSpace feature can upscale non-Dolby Atmos tracks for spatial audio.\n\u274c You want full surround sound: Adding Bose Ultra Open Earbuds can give a great surround sound experience, but just for one person. If you want full surround sound for around the same price, other options are available.\n\u274c You\u2019re on a tight budget: The Smart Soundbar has a premium price for a single soundbar. You can find similar compact soundbars for less, but you will compromise on both sound quality and features.\nWhat you need to know: The Bose Smart Soundbar is a compact model with real upfiring speakers to properly deliver Dolby Atmos soundtracks. It has built-in Wi-Fi for streaming music, AirPlay 2 and Chromecast support, and can be paired with optional Bose wireless surround sound speakers and a subwoofer if you one day get an urge to upgrade your system. Alternatively, the Smart Soundbar\u2019s Personal Surround Sound feature, which requires Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds, can give you surround sound without having to muck with extra speakers.\nAudio performance: When we reviewed the Bost Smart Soundbar, we noted that it \u201csounds about as good as a soundbar can.\u201d Dialogue is \u201cconsistently intelligible,\u201d and there are level and EQ controls in Bose\u2019s app that let you boost it on an as-needed basis. Because of its compact form factor, both bass and soundstage width are limited, but the Smart Soundbar\u2019s upfiring Atmos speakers, which can also be engaged for non-Atmos movies and music using the TrueSpace feature, help quite a bit to expand the soundfield.\nDesign: At 27 inches wide by 2 inches high and 4 inches deep, it\u2019s a fairly sleek and compact design for an all-in-one unit and a perfect choice for smaller homes or screens. While it only has a single HDMI port, it makes up for this by packaging everything into an attractive all-in-one form.\nValue: This soundbar impressed us in several ways during our testing, and we also appreciated its Personal Surround Sound and TrueSpace features The Bose is also a good value \u2013 as one of the few soundbars that sell for under $500 / \u00a3500 / AU$700, it offers a lot more features than the Sony HT-S2000 at #2 in this list and Amazon Fire TV Soundbar at #8 in this list.\nTo save money on Bose products, check out our Bose discount codes.\nRead our full Bose Smart Soundbar review\nThe best soundbar for flexibility\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You need multiple HDMI ports: The JBL Bar 1300X comes with four HDMI ports so multiple devices can be connected.\n\u2705 You want rear speakers with no wires: Supplied with wireless rechargeable speakers, there's no wires to keep things neat and tidy.\n\u274c You want to keep the rear speakers charged: The JBL Bar 1300X's rear speakers need regular recharging, unlike a more traditional setup like the HW-Q800D at #1 in this list.\n\u274c You want the cheapest soundbar: The JBL Bar 1300X is not budget-friendly, even compared to other soundbars in its price range.\nWhat you need to know: The JBL Bar 1300X provides a fantastic level of flexibility. With Dolby Atmos and DTS:X support and a big, beefy sound aided by its larger than average subwoofer, its the connections and features packed into this soundbar that make it so versatile compared to other soundbars on the market. The one downside? This soundbar isn't going to suit serious gamers. While there are multiple HDMI ports here, none of them have 4K 120Hz pass-through to support that resolution and frame rate when playing games on PS5 or Xbox Series X, a feature you can find on our choice on the best soundbar for gaming, the Sony HT-A7000 at #5 in this list.\nAudio performance: We think the JBL Bar 1300X would suit anyone looking for a powerful and immersive soundbar option, but particularly those who are after the visceral excitement that the best home theater systems effortlessly deliver, while also being relatively easy to setup and not becoming a burden on your living room.\nDesign: Although the JBL Bar 1300X doesn't take up too much space, it is designed to fill larger rooms with sound so we wouldn't recommend it in smaller homes. There are also multiple HDMI inputs here, meaning you can connect a stack of extra sources without worry, and the system\u2019s rechargeable rear speakers can also be used as portable Bluetooth speakers. That might be a \"so what?\" feature for some people, but to us it's a design flex that heightens the Bar 1300X's overall value.\nValue: Priced in line with the likes of the Sonos Arc Ultra at #3 in this list, the JBL Bar 1300X is not cheap but does deliver a lot flexibility to make up for it. From the rechargeable rear speakers that can also be used as bluetooth speakers and number of HDMI ports to the easy setup and immersive sound, this is one of the most flexible soundbars we've found. (Note: in some countries, you get the JBL Bar 1300 \u2013 without the X \u2013 which has a smaller 10-inch subwoofer driver instead of the 12-inch in the X version. This is a relatively small difference, and doesn't alter our overall opinion.)\nRead our full JBL Bar 1300X review\nThe best soundbar for expandability\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want big and cinematic sound: The Arc Ultra's special bass driver sounds excellent, and its sound balance is excellent, especially the dialogue.\n\u2705 You want an expandable soundbar: You get great Dolby Atmos effects from a single box here , and it can be easily expanded with Sonos surround speakers and subs.\n\u274c You want high-end DTS:X support: Fans of Blu-rays or streaming IMAX Enhanced movies may be annoyed by this \u2013 you won't get the full power.\n\u274c You struggle to have enough HDMI ports on your TV: There's no HDMI passthrough here, so you simply lose the use of whichever port it's connected to.\nWhat you need to know: The Sonos Arc Ultra is the best soundbar for expandability. It sounds great on its own, but the flexible nature of the Sonos ecosystem lets you easily add surround speakers and a subwoofer as your needs and budget change. Other soundbars here deliver more immersion by filling your room with multiple boxes, but if you want deep, expansive, expertly balanced movie audio from one slender bar, with the option to add to it later, this is the way to go.\nAudio performance: The Sonos Arc Ultra is a very impressive piece of audio design, thanks partly to its 'Sound Motion' bass driver, which is a very small speaker that produces decent bass without a separate subwoofer. It helps the overall sound balance of the Arc Ultra to be absolutely superb, with great impact, very clear yet natural dialogue, and effects that jump right out of the mix. The Dolby Atmos 3D sound is excellent for a single-box soundbar as well, really adding motion and layers to individual sounds. A massive upgrade over any TV's built-in sound.\nDesign: This is small for a powerful one-box soundbar \u2013 but that's relative! It's pretty wide, though will work for TVs of 55 inches and up, but it's not too tall or deep (though may be too tall for some very low-slung TVs). It feels really well made, and the simple, hard-shell black or white design disappears nicely into your decor. The connections are in a recess in the back \u2013 as is the Bluetooth pairing button, annoyingly (but you can use the Sonos app to pair too). It's wall-mountable, too.\nValue: This is strong value, simply because it sounds so good for under $1000 / \u00a31000. It's also great that it works as part of the Sonos ecosystem, and can be expanded with Sonos' wireless speakers as rear speakers, or with a dedicated, more powerful subwoofer. However, its lack of DTS-HD/DTS:X support and not having an HDMI passthrough port when all of its key rivals do mean it's less-than-perfect on value \u2013 but if you don't care about those things, then they're not a problem!\nRead our full Sonos Arc Ultra review\nThe best soundbar for wall-mounting\nSpecifications\nReasons to buy\nReasons to avoid\n\u2705 You want a versatile design: It\u2019s our top choice for wall-mounting, but it\u2019s just as happy on a tabletop. If you want flexibility for both, you\u2019ll find it here.\n\u2705 You want more powerful sound than a standard TV can muster: You\u2019d be forgiven for thinking the low profile of this soundbar means it doesn\u2019t pack a punch, but no built-in TV sound is anywhere near this good.\n\u274c You\u2019d prefer a full surround sound experience: You\u2019ll get a pleasingly large soundstage here, but with no rear speakers, it won\u2019t wrap sound around you like the best systems can.\n\u274c Wall-mounting is only a \u201cnice to have\u201d: Pretty sure you won\u2019t wall-mount it? Look elsewhere. It\u2019s still a great choice, but if it\u2019ll always sit on your TV table, its versatility won\u2019t matter.\nWhat you need to know: The Samsung HW-QS700F soundbar blends the performance of Samsung\u2019s Q series with the sleek, lifestyle-friendly design of its S series. Its standout feature is the ability to automatically optimize its 3.1.2-channel speaker setup depending on whether it\u2019s mounted horizontally or vertically. In vertical mode, its flatter profile pairs neatly with a slim, wall-mounted TV. Sound quality is solid for the price, with support for Dolby Atmos, DTS and Bluetooth. It comes with a Samsung wireless subwoofer and can also be paired with surround speakers \u2013 but it\u2019s the wall-mounting versatility that really sets this model apart.\nAudio Performance: Despite its affordable price, this soundbar\u2019s 3.1.2-channel configuration delivers an impressive level of power, detail, and staging. Most of that top-performing sound holds up regardless of its orientation, though there are some minor niggles depending on how you use it. Then again, as we noted in our review, it still outperforms the vast majority of rivals. You\u2019ll also get to enjoy Dolby Atmos playback, DTS:X support and compatibility with a broad range of file formats.\nDesign: The design is where the HW-QS700F truly shines. It features gyro sensors that automatically adjust the speaker configuration for optimal performance whether it\u2019s placed on a table or wall-mounted. The long, angular bar and its compact, cubic wireless sub are surprisingly space-efficient for such a powerful system. It\u2019s slender enough to slide beneath most TV screens or can easily be mounted on the wall underneath one, yet long and deep enough to promise potent sound and a premium finish.\nValue: Considering its blend of performance and features, the Samsung HW-QS700F is a compelling choice. While many soundbars can either be wall-mounted or tabletop-set, few adjust their speaker configuration to optimize performance for both setups. It\u2019s a great option in its own right, but it\u2019s our top pick for wall-mounting \u2013 ideal if you want to take full advantage of that versatility or simply love the option to move it around.\nRead our full Samsung HW-QS700F review\nBest soundbars: comparison chart\nBelow, you'll find a chart showing the scores of every soundbar featured on this list, based on the criteria on which we review them: Features, Performance, Design, Setup & usability and Value. You can sort each column by clicking on its header.\nHow to choose the best soundbar\nThere are several things to consider when you\u2019re looking for the best soundbar.\nThe first is the size. You\u2019ll want to make sure that your soundbar fits under\u2014or next to, depending on your set-up\u2014your TV. For example, the long Sonos Arc soundbar is designed specifically for large screens, so won\u2019t look right with a smaller 50-inch TV. You\u2019ll need to know the size of your current TV and the size of the space you have to fit it and compare those figures to the dimensions listed alongside the soundbar you want to buy.\nYou\u2019ll also want to consider whether you need a Dolby Atmos speaker or not. Dolby Atmos is surround sound technology, placing sounds and voices all around you so that whatever you\u2019re watching or listening to is more immersive. The thing is, Dolby Atmos-enabled soundbars tend to be more expensive. You\u2019ll need to weigh up whether Dolby Atmos sound is worth it for you. Otherwise, consider a capable but cheaper option, like the Sony HT-S2000, our choice for best budget soundbar.\nAnother thing you\u2019ll want to watch out for is the kind of connection you need. You\u2019ll find most modern soundbars have HDMI connectivity, but there's also optical connectivity\u2014so what's the difference? These are two ways that audio is passed from your TV to your soundbar, but HDMI passes high-resolution audio, including Dolby Atmos.\nIf you want a premium, immersive listening experience you\u2019ll want to be sure you have an HDMI connection to use from your soundbar and an HDMI ARC (that's audio return channel) or eARC (enhanced audio return channel, a higher-resolution connection) port on your TV for it to connect to.\nBut this means one of your TV's HDMI ports is used up by the soundbar, so some bars come with HDMI 'passthrough' ports, meaning you can connect a console/set-top box/etc to the soundbar, and it passes the visuals back to your TV. If your TV has few HDMI ports, you'll want a soundbar with this feature.\nThere\u2019s more to think about, but getting the size, audio features and connectivity nailed down early on should make finding the best soundbar for you much easier.\nWhat connection do I need for a soundbar?\nThe best way to connect a soundbar to your TV is with an HDMI cable. You'll need to make sure you have an HDMI port on your soundbar and an HDMI ARC or eARC port on your TV. This allows you to use a cable to connect them.\nAn HDMI port means that the highest quality audio can pass from your TV to your soundbar, like Dolby Atmos.\nIf your TV or soundbar doesn't have HDMI ports, the second best option is an optical. This can still transfer digital sounds, but not the high-resolution ones you'd get with HDMI.\nHowever, you will still get quality audio and an optical connection does work with soundbars and surround sound systems.\nWhat size soundbar should I get?\nYou need to get a soundbar that fits in the space you have available. Some people have their TV mounted and a soundbar could happily be mounted underneath. Others have their TV on a stand and the soundbar can sit in front of it.\nConsider the space you have free but also the size of your TV. A compact soundbar might look silly with a massive screen and vice versa. There are many different-sized soundbars available to suit your TV, so make sure you check the dimensions and match them up.\nCan soundbars do surround sound?\nTrue surround sound means speakers are positioned around you. Some soundbars on this list, like the Samsung Q990D and Hisense AX5125H, also come with a subwoofer and two smaller rear channel speakers, meaning you can place them around your room.\nHowever, other devices with only one soundbar claim to offer surround sound. What this means is they deliver a stereo effect, which seems more like sound is coming from different directions, but isn't.\nMany of the high-end soundbars in this list also have Dolby Atmos built-in. Again, this isn't technically surround sound, but the audio tech is advanced and creates the illusion of immersive sound by bouncing sounds off the walls and ceiling around you.\nAre Dolby Atmos soundbars really worth it?\nAlthough not all the soundbars on this list capture Dolby Atmos as well as a home theatre system, more and more soundbars are supporting Dolby Atmos, making it available to people with all budgets.\nYes, the level of detail you get from a full home theater system compared to soundbars with 'virtual' Atmos or surround soundbars isn't quite as high, Dolby Atmos soundbars are becoming more sophisticated and provide an extra level of immersion to your cinema experience.\nAre soundbars worth it?\nAbsolutely. Even if you don't consider yourself a hardcore cinephile, the best soundbars make a world of difference to your TV watching experience\u2014even the built-in speakers that come with the best TVs just don't do your favorite films, TV shows, and games justice.\nHow much should I spend on a soundbar?\nIt depends on what you're looking for. If you want the very best soundbar technology has to offer, you might be looking at prices of $800 / \u00a3800 / AU$1,000 and upwards.\nHowever, there are lots of fantastic budget soundbars on the market, with some costing less than $100 / \u00a3100 / AU$150. Just bear in mind that you generally get what you pay for, and these budget models probably won't come with premium features like Dolby Atmos, included rear speakers, and hi-res audio support.\nBut, the mid-range market is getting more competitive and it really is easy to get a lot of bang for your buck, with soundbars (on our list above) providing Dolby Atmos and a subwoofer for under $400/\u00a3400/AU$650 becoming more and more common.\nWhere should I put a soundbar?\nYou generally have two options when it comes to soundbar placement: wall-mounting it, or placing in below your TV on your TV cabinet. If your soundbar is quite tall, wall-mounting may be the best option, as it could obscure the IR receiver on your TV, rendering your remote control useless.\nDoes my soundbar brand need to match my TV?\nQuick answer: No, any soundbar can be used with any TV. That\u2019s because all TVs made over the past decade feature HDMI (ARC or eARC) and optical digital connections that output audio signals, and virtually every soundbar will feature both HDMI and optical digital inputs to accept that output. And even if you\u2019re mixing brands, a TV\u2019s HDMI-CEC feature will conveniently let you control the soundbar's volume level using the TV remote control.\nHaving said that, there are instances where combining soundbar and TV brands will yield benefits. Many Samsung soundbars, such as our best overall pick, the Samsung HW-Q800D, for example, support a feature called Q-Symphony that lets you combine the sound output of the TV\u2019s built-in speakers with the soundbar\u2019s output for an enhanced, more spacious audio presentation. And LG soundbars support a similar feature called Wow Orchestra that automatically integrates the soundbar and TV speakers when connected to a compatible LG TV. In both cases, you will experience more powerful, immersive soundstage than you would from just the soundbar working alone.\nAnother benefit to using the same-brand soundbars and TVs is the ability to make a lossless wireless audio connection between the two \u2013 no HDMI cables required. Once again, this feature is supported by select TVs and soundbars from Samsung, which simply calls it Wireless Dolby Atmos, and LG, which calls its version WowCast.\nWhat is Eclipsa Audio, and does my soundbar need it?\nAt the recent CES 2025 trade show, Samsung announced a new immersive audio format meant to compete with Dolby Atmos. Eclipsa Audio was jointly developed by Samsung and Google, and it will be supported by new Samsung TVs and soundbars coming out in 2025. Other TV and soundbar brands didn\u2019t announce any new products with Eclipsa Audio support at CES, but since Google is involved, the format will certainly be supported on future TVs that run the Google TV smart TV platform (Hisense, Sony, TCL, among others).\nEclipsa Audio differs from Dolby Atmos in that it\u2019s a channel-based format. Dolby Atmos soundtracks are \u201cobject-based\u201d mixes comprised of audio \u201cobjects\u201d positioned in 3D space that are scaled to a specific speaker configuration (e.g., 7.1.4 Atmos, 5.1-channel surround, 2-channel stereo). Eclipsa Audio, in contrast, supports up to 28 input channels, which Samsung and Google say is sufficient to provide an immersive 3D audio experience on systems ranging from headphones to multichannel home theaters.\nWhile its license-free status should make it appealing to hardware manufacturers (Dolby, in contrast, charges licensing fees for Dolby Atmos), a key challenge that Eclipsa Audio faces is streaming services support. Dolby Atmos is firmly entrenched in the streaming ecosystem, while Eclipsa Audio is currently only supported by Google-owned YouTube. Given that situation, it\u2019s safe to say that Eclipsa Audio support on soundbars is a non-issue for now, though it\u2019s something to keep an eye on for the future.\nOther soundbars to consider\nWe\u2019ve reviewed several soundbars recently that didn\u2019t make this guide for various reasons, though they are also worth considering.\nBose Smart Ultra Soundbar: An all-in-one competitor to the Sonos Arc, but with a slight lack of heft to its sound and a limited sense of height, this soundbar isn't great enough value to make it into the list. You can read our full Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar review to learn more.\nSennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus: This soundbar really earns its keep with superior delivery of Atmos effects and extended bass. It's well worth consideration if you're looking for something that's a single-unit and if price isn't a worry, but it's expensive, and that's why it hasn't made our list here. Give our full Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus review a read if you want big sound without multiple boxes.\nSennheiser Ambeo Mini: If the price of the Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus is too much for your budget, this is a more compact and lower-cost model that provides a \u201cbig\u201d sound, but doesn\u2019t match the Plus when it comes to bass extension and Atmos height effects. It's a similar size to the Sonos Beam Gen 2. We'd choose that model over this one for overall audio quality, but you can read our Sennheiser Ambeo Mini review to learn more.\nSony Bravia Theater Bar 6: Sony's entry-level bar in its Theater lineup for 2025 delivers a powerful performance with awesome bass and full, clear and precise sound. It's also great value for money, but cheaper alternatives keep the Theater 6 off our list: for now. Read our Sony Bravia Theater 6 review for more info.\nNew soundbars arriving in 2025\nBelow are soundbars that we're either in the middle of testing or anticipate testing as 2025 rolls on. Some of these may even make it onto our list!\nFirst up, the Creative Stage Pro 2.1 is a budget-friendly, 2-channel soundbar that has a premium-looking design for cheap. This review is currently in progress.\nThe KEF XIO was recently announced and shown at Audio Advice Live 2025 and delivers a 5.1.2-channel configuration with a sleek, premium design. From what we heard, we were impressed. The KEF XIO joins a competitive all-in-one soundbar market with Marshall and Sonos, but it could be a real winner.\nFrom JBL, we have two entries: the JBL Bar 1000 MK2 and the JBL Bar 1300 MK2, the latter of which is the successor to the JBL Bar 1300X on our list. Two Dolby Atmos packages with rear speakers and wireless subwoofer included, JBL's standout feature is the detachable rear speakers, which can also be attached to the soundbar for easy movement and sound customization. We look forward to testing these out after having raved about the JBL Bar 1300X.\nHow we test the best soundbars\n\u2611\ufe0f More than 2,600 TV and home theater reviews\n\u2611\ufe0f 16 years of product testing\n\u2611\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\n\u2611\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing tech\nWhen we test the best soundbars, we look at categories such as audio performance, design, setup and usability, value for money and features - the same criteria we use for our reviews of soundbars.\nSources: After connecting the soundbar to a TV, we play not only streaming and 4K Blu-ray sources through the TV into the soundbar using the TV\u2019s HDMI eARC connection (as 4K Blu-ray provides better audio quality than streaming), but also music over a Bluetooth wireless connection.\nAudio overview: For audio performance, there are several factors we look at when testing. Soundbars are often used to upgrade a TV's built-in sound, so dialogue clarity and volume are key, as that\u2019s where built-in TV speakers usually struggle the most. We also test bass, mids and trebles by listening to how each range sits within a mix, and also whether the soundstage is wide or narrow.\nSpatial audio: Dolby Atmos spatial audio and surround sound (both virtually and physically through extra speakers) have become common features on soundbars, so we will test the effectiveness and spaciousness of the surround sound, as some people will want a room-filling home theater feel without all the boxes needed for a full AV setup.\nHDMI passthrough: When it comes to higher-end soundbars, we expect 4K 120Hz passthrough on HDMI ports and will test that feature if available. Gamers specifically look for this feature as some TVs don\u2019t have the four HDMI 2.1 ports needed to cover both games consoles and a soundbar.\nMusic: Bluetooth streaming is more commonly being featured on soundbars as manufacturers look to offer an \u2018all-in-one\u2019 solution for movies and music. So, if a soundbar offers that feature, we\u2019ll be sure to test its performance with streamed music. On more premium soundbars, we expect to see Wi-Fi streaming, although this is not always the case.\nSetup and ease-of-use: This is another area we test, as some soundbars carry a plug-in-and-play philosophy whilst others require more in-depth calibration. More soundbars are featuring auto-calibration features to adjust the sound for the room they\u2019re installed in, and this can make a big difference in sound quality. As part of our tests, we\u2019ll listen to a soundbar before and after this calibration to see just how much of a difference it makes.\nConsistency: While we strive to maintain consistency in testing conditions, some of our writers have different setups they\u2019ll be listening in. However, the tests carried out and the testing criteria are the same for all our reviews.\nLatest updates\nAugust 6, 2025\nReplaced the Samsung HW-Q990D with the Samsung HW-Q990F as 'best for Dolby Atmos'.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Bose Smart Soundbar\u2019s has a premium price, but you\u2019re getting quite a bit for it. The features on hand are very impressive, including one unique one that unfortunately requires an extra purchase. Audio quality is typical for Bose as well, though there\u2019s not a whole lot of bass and the soundstage is narrower than I would like.\nPros\n- +\nGood quality sound\n- +\nPersonal surround sound feature\n- +\nVoice assistant support\nCons\n- -\nA bit pricey\n- -\nBass is a bit light\n- -\nNarrow soundstage\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBose Smart Soundbar: Two minute review\nThe Bose Smart Soundbar is a great way to elevate your TV experience in the bedroom or other small room. It\u2019s not up to the task of a home theater setup, especially without a subwoofer, but that\u2019s not its purpose. if you\u2019re looking to bring Dolby Atmos sound to a smaller setup, it\u2019s one of the best soundbars you can buy.\nThe Bose Smart Soundbar\u2019s lack of low-end will frustrate action and superhero movie fans and its narrow soundstage keeps it from truly elevating the audio experience, especially when listening to music. However, it still is one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars, with two upward-firing speakers that provide a sense of space and immersion that somewhat offsets that narrow soundstage. In a smaller setup, it almost completely masks it.\nJust as important, this soundbar is stacked with features. There\u2019s an A.I. dialogue mode, Alexa and Chromecast support, plus a whole lot more. My favorite feature lets you use specific Bose earbuds as the rear speakers in a surround sound setup for a unique experience. Unfortunately, those are sold separately. And, of course, the Smart Soundbar has the typical Bose markup, so this is not necessarily a great deal, though I wouldn\u2019t call it overpriced either.\nIf you\u2019re looking to upgrade your TV experience in a smaller space like a bedroom or small apartment, the Bose Smart Soundbar is an ideal option, especially with all the features on hand. Just be willing to shell out some extra cash and be aware of its shortcomings.\nBose Smart Soundbar review: Price & release date\n- Price: $499.00 / \u00a3499.95 / AU$799.95\n- First available: September 2024\n- Available in the US, UK, and Australia\nHaving been released in September of 2024, the Bose Smart Soundbar is the newest addition to the company\u2019s soundbar lineup. And at $499.00 / \u00a3499.95 / AU$799.95, its price tag is about what one would expect from Bose since you\u2019re paying a little bit for the name. You might get more in terms of features or even a subwoofer and surround speakers for that price if you go with models from other companies, but you might be trading off some quality for those extras.\nWe reported around the time of release that the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds can work as rear speakers for this soundbar. And while that is certifiably a very appreciated feature, you won\u2019t get a pair for free when purchasing the soundbar but will have to pay an extra $299 / \u00a3299 / AU$449.95 for the earbuds.\nThe Bose Smart Soundbar and Bose Ultra Open Earbuds are available in the US, UK, and Australia.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nBose Smart Soundbar review: Specs\nDimensions (W x H x D) | 27.34 x 2.21 x 4.01 inches (694 x 56 x 102mm) |\nSpeaker channels | 3.0.2 (plays back at 5.1.4) |\nPorts: | HDMI, Optical, Bluetooth, USB, sub out, IR |\nDolby Atmos/DTS:X | Yes |\nSub included | No |\nRear speakers included | No |\nFeatures | Airplay 2, Spotify Connect, Chromecast built-in, A.I. Dialog Mode, Personal Surround Sound via Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, Bose TrueSpace, app support |\nBose Smart Soundbar review: Features\n- Personal Surround Sound (requires optional Bose earbuds)\n- App is easy to navigate and use\n- Wi-Fi and Voice assistant support\nMy favorite feature of the feature-filled Bose Smart Soundbar is Personal Surround Sound, which uses Bose\u2019s Ultra Open Earbuds as rear speakers so you can get an actual surround sound experience without needing to use rear speakers. Plus, you can adjust how subtle or strong the effect is in the app as well as boost different settings like center channel level for those with issues hearing dialogue. This feature requires you to purchase Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, however, and they\u2019re not exactly cheap.\nI particularly liked this feature for gaming. I used Personal Surround Sound while playing Star Wars: Jedi Survivor and found it created a fairly integrated soundscape for the main character to run around in \u2013 half the time I couldn\u2019t tell if what I was hearing was coming from the soundbar or the earbuds.\nIn a way, Personal Surround Sound is even better than a traditional surround sound system since you don\u2019t have to be locked into a specific seat to hear all the audio elements in the soundtrack at the proper distance. On the other hand, this feature only works for anyone wearing the earbuds \u2013 not exactly great for group viewing.\nThe app, which is easy to navigate and use, has plenty of other features on tap. Of course, there are some basic EQ settings. While there\u2019s no parametric EQ, you can adjust the treble, bass, center channel, and height effect, aka spatial audio. You can even toggle on a Wall EQ setting to adjust for when the soundbar is installed against a wall.\nSpeaking of spatial audio, this soundbar does support Dolby Atmos, and physically reproduces it via those upward-firing speakers. Some soundbars support Dolby Atmos but don\u2019t have any upward-firing speakers, instead using virtual trickery to give a sense of spaciousness. The difference is noticeable.\nBose TrueSpace also takes advantage of those upward-firing speakers, upscaling sound so that you\u2019re getting a spatial audio experience even when the source isn\u2019t Dolby Atmos encoded. (It\u2019s like listening to mono audio on a stereo set of speakers.) As far as I could hear, it\u2019s the same audio going upwards as out whereas Dolby Atmos audio has specific elements that are designated height effects.\nIf you\u2019re hard of hearing or just find the modern mixes of movies to be hard to understand, the AI dialogue mode might be the feature for you. It\u2019s supposed to automatically adjust dialogue for clarity\u2019s sake. When testing \u2013 I watched the beginning of The Dark Knight for this feature \u2013 I found that dialogue was clearer since there was a subtle boost to the midrange where voices typically sit. It wasn\u2019t obnoxious the way some dialog boosting modes are, but it still boosted sounds that sit in a similar frequency range that weren\u2019t voices. It\u2019s not perfectly executed, but still is done well.\nLastly, the Bose Smart Soundbar has Alexa support as well as both Chromecast built-in and AirPlay. With Alexa, you can talk to the soundbar the way you would an Amazon Echo, even asking what the weather is or setting a timer. I did find that I had to articulate the wake word a little more for the soundbar to hear me, but that\u2019s not all that big of a deal.\nDuring testing, I found the built-in Chromecast and AirPlay to work seamlessly, which is something I always worry about as in the past I\u2019ve had connectivity issues with Wi-Fi streaming on some devices.\n- Features score: 4.5 / 5\nBose Smart Soundbar review: Performance\n- Light on bass\n- Balanced mids and crisp highs\n- Somewhat narrow soundstage\nThe Bose Smart Soundbar sounds about as good as a soundbar can. You have to remember that these types of audio devices exist mostly for convenience\u2019s sake.\nWith that in mind, let\u2019s discuss its audio limitations. First up is the bass. While I could turn up the bass level in the app, the low-range boost affects the mid-range frequencies. Since there are just some bass ports on the back and no actual subwoofer-specific drivers, not to mention that the drivers are necessarily compact, the lack of a strong bass response is unsurprising.\nThere was no rumble on hand when I tested it with The Batman, The Dark Knight, and Deadpool & Wolverine (400 Blows doesn\u2019t lend itself to testing soundbars). Whenever there are big fights in these kinds of movies, there\u2019s always a lot of very punchy low-end information. But here, all that information is very muted if not gone. At least, there\u2019s a subwoofer output to correct that by adding an external subwoofer, and Bose also offers wireless subs (and surround speakers) that can be paired with the Smart Soundbar.\nThe other parts of the frequency range fare better. The mid-range is not quite rich and full, but it is well-balanced. I generally didn\u2019t need the A.I. dialogue mode, for instance, as the dialogue was consistently intelligible. It also helped that I could boost the center channel level in the app to help with that.\nThe high-end is nice and crisp on the Smart Soundbar. Whether it was the string arrangement in movie scores or even dialogue when I tested it, everything had a nice clarity as opposed to being overly pronounced or even painful to listen to.\nThis soundbar's soundstage is inherently limited by its form factor. That said, the sound did feel like it has more width than other similarly sized soundbars I\u2019ve tested and used. This was helped quite a bit by the spatial audio capabilities, as everything sounded a little bigger and wider, even though I didn\u2019t hear as much left-to-right movement as I expected.\n- Performance score: 4 / 5\nBose Smart Soundbar review: Design\n- Upward-firing speakers\n- On-unit controls just for voice assistant\n- No alphanumeric LED display\nBose is not breaking the mold design-wise with the look or color of the Bose Smart Soundbar. This is a long rectangular, matte black soundbar with a grill that covers the front and wraps around the side to cover the center tweeter and the racetrack transducers on each end. There\u2019s a grill on the top of the unit as well where the two upward-firing transducers are.\nSpeaking of all those speakers, despite it being technically a 3.0.2 system (the left, right and center speakers along with the two upward-firing ones), the audio decodes at 5.1.4. There are some ports on the back to help with bass but there aren\u2019t any drivers dedicated to the low end.\nThe on-unit controls are fairly limited as just two buttons are sitting on top of the left side for voice assistant support. There\u2019s a microphone button to turn the internal mic on or off and an Alexa action button to interact with Alexa in a few different ways including stopping the feature.\nMost of the physical controls are available through the remote. You have the usual ones like power, mute, and volume controls as well as three source buttons (TV, Bluetooth, App) and a play/pause button. Nothing too crazy. The remote itself is fairly small and light, which is nice, though its small size makes it the kind of remote that\u2019s very easy to lose.\nAs far as ports go, it has the necessary optical and HDMI ports as well as a subwoofer out, an IR port, and a USB\nThere\u2019s no front panel alphanumeric LED display \u2013 something I always wish I had when it\u2019s missing \u2013 just an LED light when the soundbar turns on or is listening when listening to a voice assistant command. While I did miss it, I didn\u2019t miss it all that much.\n- Design score: 4 / 5\nBose Smart Soundbar review: Setup & usability\n- HDMI eARC connection to TV\n- Easy, app-based setup\n- One-remote use with Roku TVs\nSetup of the Bose Smart Soundbar is very straightforward, even if it takes just a little longer from beginning to end. If you just want to get to it and don\u2019t care about all the features, connecting the soundbar to either your TV\u2019s optical or HDMI eARC port is most of the work. Put some AAA batteries into the remote (unfortunately not included) and you\u2019re good to go.\nThere are a few more steps if you want to get the full experience. After downloading the Bose app, you pair it to the soundbar (and the Ultra Open earbuds if you have them) and then set up Wi-Fi on the soundbar for AirPlay, Chromecast Built-in and Alexa.\nThe Bose Smart Soundbar is made to pair seamlessly with Roku TVs. Luckily, I have one so I was able to go through the process \u2013 just follow the onscreen instructions \u2013 which allowed me to use my TV remote for basic functionality. On that note, once Alexa was set up, I was able to manipulate the soundbar just by using the wake word and speaking to it.\n- Setup & usability score: 5 / 5\nBose Smart Soundbar review: Value\n- Features boost value\n- Can get more advanced systems for same price\n- Cheaper standalone soundbars available\nIf you\u2019re looking at features, the Bose Smart Soundbar has a lot going for it with the Personal Surround Sound feature (which, again, requires a separate purchase), A.I. dialogue mode, and app support.\nFor a similar price, however, you can get a 5.1-channel system like the maxed-out version of the Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus, which also gives you a subwoofer and rear speakers for true surround sound. As nice as Bose\u2019s personalized surround sound feature is, only one person can use the earbuds at a time. Amazon\u2019s system is lacking features and doesn\u2019t have voice assistant support \u2013 not even Alexa. Its audio quality is not quite as crisp, nor does it have the upward-firing speakers of the Bose soundbar. Of course, if you\u2019re on a budget, you can skip the subwoofer and rear speakers and just get the standalone Amazon Soundbar Plus soundbar for $249.99 / \u00a3249.99 (about AU$400).\nAnother option is to spend $349 / \u00a3299 (originally $499 / \u00a3449 / AU$695) to get the Sony HT-S2000, a 3.1-channel standalone soundbar that includes virtual spatial audio and good bass response. It costs a little less for something that gets you 80% of the way there. But again, you\u2019re giving up a lot as it doesn\u2019t have voice assistant support, the personalized surround sound that\u2019s unique to this Bose soundbar, or one of the many other features on hand.\n- Value score: 4 / 5\nShould I buy the Bose Smart Soundbar?\nSection | Notes | Score |\nFeatures | From the earbuds\u2019 assisted surround sound to the Alexa support, this soundbar has about all the features you could ask for | 4.5 / 5 |\nPerformance | The bass is a bit on the weak side and the soundstage is lacking, but the mids and highs are very good.

While a bit light in the bass, it has good clarity and dynamics.\nYou want true Dolby Atmos\nThanks to the inclusion of two upward-firing speakers, this soundbar offers a real spatial audio experience. On top of that, it can upscale non-Dolby Atmos tracks into faux spatial audio.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou want a full surround sound system\nWhile you can use the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds for a great surround sound experience, it\u2019s just for one person. If you want a full surround sound experience, especially with guests, look elsewhere.\nYou\u2019re on a budget\nFor a single soundbar, you\u2019re paying quite a premium here. There are decent soundbars, albeit with less features and lower-quality sound, at a fraction of the price.\nBose Smart Soundbar: Also consider\nAmazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus\nThe Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus system costs about the same as the Bose Smart Soundbar. And while it\u2019s not nearly as feature-packed, it does come with a subwoofer and surround speakers for a more immersive experience (discounting the Bose\u2019s personal surround sound feature).\nRead our full Amazon Fire TV Soundbar Plus review\nSony HT-S2000\nWhile its Dolby Atmos is virtual, this soundbar still punches above its weight thanks to its impressive sound.

I watched movies, shows, gamed and listened to music with it. I tested all the various features, especially the Personal Surround Sound feature to see what it could do.\nAfter having tested the Bose Smart Soundbar, it still surprises me all that this soundbar has to offer. It\u2019s that feature-packed. This is an ideal soundbar for someone with a smaller, not-quite home theater setup, but who still wants a premium experience, and not just because of the name.\nI\u2019ve tested a lot of tech gear over the years from laptops to keyboards and speakers, and so have been able to use my expertise towards giving an honest and fair opinion, not to mention a critical eye, to any product I test.\n- First reviewed: February 2025\n- Read more about how we test\nJames Holland loves checking out gadgets of all sorts, whether it's audio equipment, laptops, or vacuums (especially of the robot variety), and does so for a number of Future Publications including TechRadar, Top Ten Reviews, Homes & Gardens, and T3.

      "text": "TechRadar Verdict\nThe Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar has plenty going for it. It\u2019s reasonably compact, it\u2019s beautifully built and finished, it calibrates itself to your environment quickly and accurately, and it has plenty of well-realized control options. And when it comes to sound quality, there\u2019s lots to like, too \u2013 but it\u2019s not quite the complete article, especially where the Dolby Atmos party-piece is concerned\nPros\n- +\nWide and nicely detailed sound\n- +\nExemplary build and finish\n- +\nLots of great control options\nCons\n- -\nLacks some weight to its sound\n- -\nCurtailed sensation of audio \u2018height\u2019\n- -\nTrueSpace does its thing whether you like it or not\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nBose Smart Ultra Soundbar review: two-minute review\nThe Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar arrives as the most upmarket, most expensive member of the Bose family of soundbars \u2013 and it\u2019s been given the far-from-enviable task of taking the Sonos Arc down a peg or two as the most popular all-in-one big soundbar. Which means it has its work cut out.\nFirst impressions \u2013 and second impressions too, for that matter \u2013 are very good, though. The Smart Ultra is properly built and finished from tactile, high-quality materials, and by the standards of the best soundbars, it\u2019s of very discreet proportions. It\u2019s well specified, including dedicated upward-facing speaker drivers \u2013 you\u2019ve always a better chance of generating a convincing impression of spatial audio if you\u2019ve got the physical equipment (rather than just some clever sound processing) to help you. And between a remote control handset, a couple of physical on-bar controls, voice-assistant compatibility, and one of the better control apps out there, getting what you want from the Bose couldn\u2019t be any simpler.\nIn performance terms, it generally makes a good impression too. Certainly no one\u2019s going to be disappointed by the width and coherence of its soundstage, nor by the impressive amount of detail it retains and delivers from a soundtrack. Dialogue, in particular, enjoys proper expression \u2013 and, as we know, that\u2019s always the most important part of any movie soundtrack. There\u2019s a slight shortage of low-end \u2018punch\u2019 and substance to the sound, though, and only a very modest sensation of the audio \u2018height\u2019 that is basically the whole point of getting one of the best Dolby Atmos soundbars.\nAnd when you remember that \u2018punch\u2019 and \u2018height\u2019 are among the two real strengths of the usually cheaper Sonos Arc or the more expensive but exquisite Sennheiser Ambeo Plus, it becomes apparent that the Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar is sitting in a slightly awkward spot \u2013 however, it's notably more compact than the Sonos Arc, which may make it a winner for some people.\nBose Smart Ultra Soundbar review: price & release date\n- Released October 10th 2023\n- \u00a3899 / $899 / AU$1499\nThe Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar went on sale on October 10th, 2023. It's priced at $899 in the US, \u00a3899 in the United Kingdom, and in Australia it will set you back AU$1,499.\nThis means it\u2019s a little more affordable than the Sony HT-A7000 or Sennheiser Ambeo Soundbar Plus, both of which we\u2019re big fans of. And more significantly, it\u2019s the same money officially as the very similarly specified (and extremely successful) Sonos Arc, though the Arc is regularly available with discounts now, which means in real terms you should expect to pay less than the price of the Bose.\nBose Smart Ultra Soundbar review: Specs\n| Dimensions (HxWxD) | 58 x 1045 x 107mm / 2.3 x 41 x 4.2in |\n| Speaker channels | 5.1.2 |\n| Connections | HDMI eARC, digital optical, Ethernet, bass module, IR blaster, USB (service only), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi |\n| Dolby Atmos/DTS:X | Yes/No |\n| Sub included | No |\n| Rear speakers included | No |\n| Features | Adaptiq room calibration, Amazon Alexa, AI Dialogue Mode, Bose TrueSpace, Chromecase, AirPlay 2 |\nBose Smart Ultra Soundbar review: Features\n- 9 speaker drivers arranged in 5.1.2 channels\n- Dolby Atmos support, but no DTS:X\n- TrueSpace turns regular audio into Atmos-like sound\nThe Smart Ultra Soundbar uses a nine-strong line-up of speaker drivers in order to deal with Dolby Atmos spatial audio soundtracks (and Bose's TrueSpace technology to up-mix non-Atmos content to the point that it uses all nine drivers too).\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nSix of these nine drivers are 100 x 50mm \u2018racetrack\u2019 full-range drivers, and are of plastic with ferrite magnets. There\u2019s one behind each exposed metal grille on the top surface of the soundbar, angled in an effort to create the sonic height that\u2019s basically the whole point of a Dolby Atmos soundtrack. The other four are grouped towards the center of the bar \u2013 there are two either side of a 25mm neodymium tweeter that\u2019s positioned dead center. There\u2019s another of these tweeters at each end of the soundbar, and they spread sound beyond the physical confines of the soundbar\u2019s cabinet.\nIt seems safe to assume there are nine discrete blocks of amplification powering this driver array, and it seems safe to assume it\u2019s of the Class D variety. But having seemingly taken a leaf out of the Sonos' playbook of inexplicable secrecy, Bose is neither confirming nor denying. And there\u2019s no indication of the amount of power this putative amplification turns out, either, nor of the Smart Ultra\u2019s frequency response.\nPhysical connectivity is kept in a couple of little recesses on the rear of the cabinet. In the first you\u2019ll find sockets for HDMI eARC, Ethernet, digital optical and a USB-C slot that\u2019s purely for servicing. In the second there\u2019s power, and a collection of 3.5mm sockets \u2013 they\u2019re for data, for connecting the Adaptiq calibration mic, connecting a bass module, and an IR blaster respectively.\nHaving only one HDMI socket is frustrating here \u2013 it's so useful to have at least one passthrough \u2013 but the Sonos Arc has the same limitation, so Bose isn't alone.\nWireless connectivity is covered off by Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 5.0. Chromecast is built in, Apple AirPlay 2 is available (both of which make multi-room set-up straightforward), and Spotify can be embedded into the Bose Music control app.\nSound format support extends to Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital, Dolby TrueHD and Dolby Digital Plus. Bear in mind, though, that TrueSpace is constantly doing its thing, analyzing incoming non-Dolby audio content and deciding how best (or, more particularly, with how much spatial audio effect) it should be delivered. And you\u2019ve further input into the way sound is presented thanks to the defeatable \u2018AI Dialogue Mode\u2019 that is constantly assessing audio content to give dialogue (and the midrange in general) a little push towards the front of the soundstage.\n- Features score: 4/5\nBose Smart Ultra Soundbar review: Sound quality\n- Spacious, organized sound\n- Poise and insight in equal measure\n- The spatial sound isn't especially pronounced\nLike any worthwhile Dolby Atmos soundbar, the Bose Smart Ultra is at its most impressive and convincing when given some properly accomplished Dolby Atmos content to deal with - and when reproducing the painstakingly remastered Atmos soundtrack on a 4K UHD Blu-ray disc of The Shining to deal with, the Bose wastes little time in establishing its credentials.\nFor example, it\u2019s impressively detailed from the top of the frequency range to the bottom. This is most immediately apparent through the midrange, where voices project well and are absolutely loaded with information regarding tone and timbre as well as character and emotional state. The Bose communicates freely where dialogue is concerned, and voices are distinct and explicit as a result. But it\u2019s true of frequency information on either side, too \u2013 bass sounds are respectably deep and varied, while the top of the frequency range is crisp and attacking.\nThe Smart Ultra isn\u2019t the deepest-digging soundbar you ever heard, it\u2019s true \u2013 those who equate \u2018punch\u2019 with \u2018excitement\u2019 may be a little underwhelmed \u2013 and there could be greater substance to treble sounds to balance out their shininess and bite. It\u2019s possible to mitigate these traits just a little in the Bose Music control app, but the fundamentals of the tonality that\u2019s available here will always be apparent.\nThe driver array does very good work in conjuring appreciable sonic width to the soundtrack \u2013 the distance it can reach both left and right is considerably bigger than the physical dimensions of the cabinet. By way of mild contrast, though, the vertical extension the Bose can muster is fairly modest \u2013 there\u2019s some height to its presentation, for sure, but it\u2019s not especially pronounced. If your expectations of a Dolby Atmos soundbar include a suggestion of overhead sound, there\u2019s not going to be much about the way the Smart Ultra goes about things to excite you, especially when you can get the multi-channel mastery of the Samsung HW-Q990C for around the same price.\nSwitching to some two-channel content lets the TrueSpace technology do its thing \u2013 and its thing turns out to be pretty effective. The same accurate, detailed and slightly lightweight tonality is in evidence (though just a hint of sibilance creeps into the top of the frequency range) and the same spacious, well-defined soundstage is apparent too. Also apparent is the technology disinclination (or inability) to summon any meaningful suggestion of height to the sound it delivers.\nUsing Bluetooth to stream a file of Kraftwerk\u2019s Computer World results in quite a lot of the Smart Ultra\u2019s positivity where soundstaging is concerned going astray. Detail levels stay agreeably high, and there\u2019s decent rhythmic expression to the square-edged four/four presentation \u2013 but a mild-but-definite vagueness creeps into the layout of the stage, and the latent edginess of the tonality becomes a little more pronounced. TrueSpace has its limits, and it seems that stereo music is among them.\n- Sound quality score: 4/5\nBose Smart Ultra Soundbar: Design\n- Suitable for TVs of 48 inches and up\n- Very well-built and premium\n- Glass top is highly reflective\nOf course, it\u2019s not enough for a soundbar at this sort of money to simply perform to a certain standard \u2013 when you\u2019re charging premium money, it\u2019s important to try and add at least a little perceived value where design is concerned too. Bose has decided the way to do that is to top the Smart Ultra Soundbar with tempered glass.\nAnd up to a point, it\u2019s a sound strategy. This soundbar looks a) very similar indeed to the Smart Soundbar 900 it replaces, especially where the cutaways in the glass to expose the metal grille above the up-firing drivers are concerned, and b) a more upmarket and premium proposition than, say, the similarly priced Sonos Arc. But there are a couple of problems with the admittedly luxurious glass finish: it reflects the light of the screen above it quite readily, and it collects fingerprints like a scene-of-crime investigator.\nOtherwise, a combination of perforated metal that covers the front face and wraps around the sides of the bar and high-quality plastic make up the Smart Ultra. Build quality is well up to par, and the standard of fit and finish is appropriately impressive.\nIts width is about the same as a 48-inch OLED TV, such as the LG C3, so it should work well with this size of TV and up \u2013 which is a plus over the Sonos Arc, which needs a TV of at least 55 inches.\n- Design score: 4/5\nBose Smart Ultra Soundbar review: Setup & usability\n- 'Adaptiq\u2019 automatic room calibration\n- Voice, app and remote control\n- 'AI Dialogue\u2019 mode is new\nYou\u2019ve got to hand it to Bose: it\u2019s made setting up the Smart Ultra Soundbar about as simple as can be, and made whoever\u2019s doing it look like a weirdo to any observers at the same time.\nOnce the soundbar is in position, and the appropriate connection to the TV and to power have been made, opening the \u2018Bose Music\u2019 control app that\u2019s free for iOS and Android gives comprehensive control of the Smart Ultra. And first things first: it puts you in charge of the Adaptiq automatic room calibration system. Plug the Adaptiq mic into the rear of the Smart Ultra, and then put the mic on your head. You read that right.\nThe calibration system fires off the usual selection of test-tones in order to best set up the soundbar to suit your specific environment. The app will ask you to change positions as many as four subsequent times in order to do its thing \u2013 and after that you can take your little plastic mic-hat off and hope never to need to use it again.\nThe app also features volume control, input selection, EQ adjustment for center, height, bass and treble, and an audio delay adjuster to help achieve perfect audio/video sync. It allows you to group your compatible Bose products together (including surround and/or bass speakers if you\u2019re going the full home theater hog), gives access to Spotify and TuneIn internet radio, holds half a dozen assignable presets, and allows you to switch AI Dialogue Mode on or off.\nIt\u2019s where you can set up Amazon Alexa voice control \u2013 which proves sharp-earned and reliable. The Bose Voice4Video feature leverages the power of Alexa to allow you to take control of your TV, cable- or satellite TV box using your voice, meaning you can switch on the TV and switch inputs just by asking. The Smart Ultra can also be used with Google Assistant, provided there\u2019s an appropriate speaker on a common network.\nThis is a responsive, useful app, and is admirably unfussy in the way it presents itself, too.\nThere\u2019s a little remote control handset too, if you prefer. It covers only the headline controls \u2013 input selection volume up/down/mute, play/pause and power on/off \u2013 but its rubbery long-travel buttons feel quite good, and it\u2019s useful if the device you\u2019ve installed the app on isn't to hand.\nThere are a grand total of two physical controls on the soundbar itself, both capacitive touch-surfaces. One switches the integrated mics on or off, while the other is a multifunction \u2018action\u2019 control.\n- Setup & usability: 5/5\nBose Smart Ultra Soundbar review: Value\n- Big, organized sound\n- Great build quality and excellent control options\n- Seems a touch expensive next to its most obvious rivals\nIf we accept that Bose has the Sonos Arc squarely in its sights with the Smart Ultra Soundbar, then I have to conclude that the Bose is just a little overpriced. Yes, it\u2019s flawlessly constructed and finished, from materials that look and feel good (the suitability of glass in front of a TV notwithstanding), and it\u2019s simple to set up in the first place and operate thereafter.\nBut while there\u2019s plenty of merit in the way it performs, not least in its wide, well-defined and nicely balanced presentation, it\u2019s slightly lacking in a couple of areas. And given that these areas \u2013 low-frequency impact and the creation of appreciable sonic height \u2013 are among the Sonos Arc\u2019s particular strengths as an all-in-one soundbar, they seem almost compounded. Which in turns serves to make the Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar seem a less compelling proposition than it otherwise would.\n- Value score: 3.5/5\nShould I buy the Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar?\n| Section | Notes | Score |\n|---|---|---|\n| Features | Great connectivity, tons of options from the app \u2013 but lacking HDMI passthrough. | 4/5 |\n| Audio performance | A very controlled and detailed sound, with tons of width. But lacking a little in height and bass power. | 4/5 |\n| Design | Beautifully made, and pleasantly compact, but the glass top is an odd choice. | 4/5 |\n| Setup & usability | Very easy to set up and to get working exactly the way you want. | 5/5 |\n| Value | You get a bit more bang for your buck from the Sonos Arc, or more expensive options. | 3.5/5 |\nBuy it if...\nYou like understated design\nThe Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar presents itself like a premium product, of course \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t make a song and dance about it.\nYou enjoy balanced, convincing sound\nOverlook the slight lack of low-end substance, and the Smart Ultra is an even-handed and confidently poised listen.\nYou like getting what you ask for\nThere are plenty of control options available to you here, and every one of them is a superior example of the type.\nDon't buy it if...\nYou\u2019re expecting true home theater scale\nThe Bose is a spacious, organized and insightful listen, sure \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t generate quite the out-and-out height of sound you might hope for.\nYou\u2019re (fairly easily) distracted\nI don\u2019t wish to labor the point, but using glass for the top surface of the soundbar will never not be mystifying. Who wants their soundbar to reflect the light of their TV?\nYou\u2019re ready to rumble\nThe bass frequencies the Bose creates are detailed, properly shaped and well controlled \u2013 but they\u2019re not especially punchy.\nBose Smart Ultra Soundbar review: Also consider\nThe Sonos Arc is still the best pound-for-pound speaker in the entire Sonos line-up, even though it\u2019s been getting on for four years since it launched. Like the Smart Ultra, it\u2019s a convincing listen all by itself - but its Sonos-ness for wider functionality makes it even more compelling. Here\u2019s our full Sonos Arc review.\nIt\u2019s more expensive than the Smart Ultra Soundbar, admittedly, but nevertheless the Sennheiser Ambeo Plus represents excellent value. Its Dolby Atmos performance is the best around at anything like the money, and it\u2019s a detailed and dynamic listen in all circumstances. Read our in-depth Sennheiser Ambeo Plus review for more.\nHow I tested the Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar\n- Tested a standard living space\n- Used for over a week\n- Tested with streaming services and 4K UHD Blu-ray content\nThe Bose Smart Ultra Soundbar has been sitting beneath a Philips OLED TV (where it happily reflects part of the images coming from above) for well over a week.
