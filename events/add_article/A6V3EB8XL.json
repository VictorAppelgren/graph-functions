      "summary": "Nancy Mace, a South Carolina Republican congresswoman and gubernatorial candidate, canceled a scheduled speech after only eight people attended an event hosted by Moms for Liberty, citing limited seating and low turnout. Despite the poor turnout, she touted her polling lead in the governor’s race and emphasized her alignment with President Trump, calling herself \"Trump in high heels.\" Mace’s campaign has been marked by a sharp shift toward hardline positions on transgender rights, immigration, and tax cuts, and she has faced criticism for using anti‑trans slurs and pushing legislation to ban transgender women from using women’s facilities. Polls show she leads her GOP rivals with about 16% support among Republican voters, while the broader electorate remains largely undecided on the upcoming primary. Her public statements and actions reflect a broader trend of GOP politicians moving toward culture‑war stances to gain political traction. ",
