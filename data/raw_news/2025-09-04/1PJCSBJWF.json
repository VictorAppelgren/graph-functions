  "description": "Russia\u2019s Gazprom PJSC announced it has signed a legally binding agreement to build the long-anticipated Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline to China via Mongolia and wo\u2026",
  "content": "(Bloomberg) \u2014 Russia\u2019s Gazprom PJSC announced it has signed a legally binding agreement to build the long-anticipated Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline to China via Mongolia and would expand deliveries through other routes, in what will be seen by the Kremlin as a major political win.\n\nIn comments made to Russian wires from Beijing, Chief Executive Officer Alexey Miller said the gas producer could ship as much as 50 billion cubic meters a year via the Power of Siberia 2 for 30 years. The price for the fuel will be lower than what Gazprom currently charges customers in Europe, Miller said according to the reports.\n\nBeijing has yet to confirm the detail of Miller\u2019s pronouncement. China\u2019s state-owned Xinhua News Agency, reporting on bilateral meetings, did not specifically mention the pipeline, though it reported that the two countries signed more than 20 cooperation agreements, including in the field of energy.\n\nGet the latest headlines, breaking news and columns.\n\u2022 There was an error, please provide a valid email address.

Please try again\n\nDiscussions around the mega-project have been stalled for years. While Russia has been eager to advance it in order to compensate for lower European deliveries following the invasion in Ukraine \u2014 and the European Union is now considering an outright ban by the end of 2027 \u2014 China has been far more cautious. Gas demand growth has been slowing and Beijing is wary of excessive dependence on a single supplier.\n\nSecuring any advance in the project is a diplomatic coup for President Vladimir Putin and a powerful signal of the strong ties that have developed with China since 2022, as Russia grapples with the impact of Western sanctions. The past few days\u2019 meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization security bloc comes at a moment when the Trump administration is dialing up its rhetoric and slapping nations around the world with punitive tariffs.\n\nMiller\u2019s comments to Russian newswires leave several questions unanswered, however. In addition to unfinished price negotiations, it isn\u2019t clear whether China can purchase flexible volumes from the pipeline or if it will have to buy its full capacity. In addition, no timeline was given for construction or for the start of deliveries. Financial details are also yet to be disclosed.\n\n\u201cThe project to build Power of Siberia 2 and the Soyuz-Vostok gas pipeline, the transit link through Mongolia, as well as the gas shipment capacity in China, is going to become the largest, the most massive and capital-intensive gas project in the world,\u201d Miller was quoted as saying by Russian news wires.",
