  "content": "Anyone who\u2019s spent any time in central London can\u2019t have failed to notice the number of supercars and other luxury vehicles cruising the streets, particularly around the glitzy shops and hotels of the capital city\u2019s bustling West End district.\n\nIn a desperate effort to be noticed, many of the owners drive their motors loudly or at high speed, and London\u2019s Metropolitan Police has had enough.\n\nIn an operation targeting anti-social driving that began on August 8 and lasted for three days, the Met Police impounded numerous supercars and luxury vehicles worth a total of more than $8 million.\n\n\u201cOfficers seized a total of 72 luxury vehicles, including Ferraris, Lamborghinis, and Bentleys that were either unroadworthy or being driven illegally,\u201d the Met said in a press release shared on Tuesday.\n\nIt said the operation had been organized in response to concerns raised by residents, businesses, and visitors about an increase in the luxury vehicles causing a nuisance, particularly in and around the Hyde Park, Kensington, and Chelsea areas.\n\nA number of drivers were issued with tickets for motoring offenses that included driving without insurance, without a license, and while disqualified. Other listed offenses included false documentation and the use of fraudulent registration plates.\n\nThe haul even included several stolen vehicles.\n\nAnd that wasn\u2019t all. \u201cMet officers uncovered a range of other criminal activity as part of their investigation, making eight arrests,\u201d the police said. \u201cThese included individuals wanted for actual bodily harm and criminal damage, drug offenses, theft, and immigration offenses.\u201d\n\nCommenting on the three-day operation, Special Chief Officer James Deller, from the Met\u2019s Special Constabulary, said: \u201cThe Met is committed to tackling anti-social behavior and this operation was set up to respond to concerns from residents, businesses, and visitors about high-value vehicles causing a nuisance in known hotspot areas in central and west London.\u201d",

      "text": "A cargo ship that has been ablaze in the mid-Atlantic since last week is reported to be carrying around 4,000 vehicles worth hundreds of millions of dollars.\nAn estimate published on Monday by risk solutions company Russell Group suggested that the Felicity Ace cargo vessel has on board around $400 million worth of vehicles, many of them luxury cars from the likes of Porsche, Audi, Bentley, and Lamborghini.\nVolkswagen, which owns the brands, hasn\u2019t said publicly how many of each model are on board the Felicity Ace, though media reports suggest the consignment includes around 1,000 Porsches and 189 Bentleys.\nThe ship caught fire near the Azores about 900 miles west of Portugal last Wednesday as it sailed from Emden, Germany, to Davisville, Rhode Island. The 22-person crew were safely evacuated soon after the blaze started.\nThe operator of Felicity Ace, Singapore-based MOL Ship Management, said on Monday that it believed the vessel was still burning five days on. Firefighting boats are currently making their way to the scene and are expected to reach the ship this week.\nReports suggest the fire has been fueled by lithium-ion batteries on electric cars aboard the vessel. A malfunction with one of the batteries could also have caused the blaze, though this has to be confirmed.\nCommenting on the incident, Suki Basi of Russell Group said: \u201cThese figures showed once again the precariousness of global supply chains. The incident comes at a bad time for global carmakers who are in the middle of a supply chain crisis sourcing semiconductors, resulting in new delays for new cars.\u201d Basi added: \u201cAn event like this will not do a great deal in instilling trust with consumers.\u201d"
