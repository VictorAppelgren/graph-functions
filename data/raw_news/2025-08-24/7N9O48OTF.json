  "title": "Top 10 Wes Anderson Films Ranked: From Quirky Beginnings to Cinematic Masterpieces",
  "description": "For your consideration, indulge this decalogue of the dapper works of Wes Anderson.",
  "content": "Wes Anderson's films are a potent mixture of dry humor and decadent assembly. He\u2019s become a director known for his talented ensembles and colorfully nostalgic staging. His filmography is loaded with gorgeous films that are amazing to get lost in, whether it\u2019s an undersea adventure or a hotel caper.\n\nWith The Criterion Collection releasing a boxed set of Anderson\u2019s films, it\u2019s a good time to cover some of his best works. If you\u2019ve never seen any of his movies, figuring out where to start can be daunting. For your consideration, indulge this decalogue of the dapper works of Wes Anderson.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for Anthony (Luke Wilson) to be released from a mental institution to jump into a life of crime. He teams up with his friend Dignan (Owen Wilson) and neighbor Bob (Robert Musgrave) for a scheme involving Dignan\u2019s boss, Mr. Henry (James Caan). But they\u2019re not the best criminals as the plan progressively goes awry.\n\nBottle Rocket was Wes Anderson's first feature film, and while it looks nothing like the movies he makes now, it\u2019s still fascinating to watch his film skills develop. He finds just the right notes for finding comedy with Owen Wilson and Luke Wilson, and his cinematography for shooting around Texas is visually stunning. It\u2019s a great film to see how much Anderson can do with so little.\n\nAnatole \"Zsa-Zsa\" Korda (Benicio del Toro) is a tycoon who survived many assassinations and escaped death. But with his more frequent trips to the afterlife, he decides to buy himself some more time and leave his fortune to his religious daughter, Liesl (Mia Threapleton). The two connect over an adventure of keeping Korda\u2019s many investors invested, whether it\u2019s through displays of gratitude or basketball games.\n\nLike Asteroid City, The Phoenician Scheme is also a film about death, but more overtly given the afterlife sequences and a skull always on Korda\u2019s desk. While it compartmentalizes much of the ensemble, the performances are some of the most emotional and nuanced of any Anderson picture. Benicio del Toro gives a remarkably layered portrayal of a weary man, but special attention should be given to newcomer Michael Cera, who absolutely steals this film by essentially performing two different roles as the same character.\n\nAll the dogs of the Japanese city Megasaki City are forced to be quarantined on the remote Trash Island, where the canines squabble for survival over food and tribes. The young Atari ventures off to the island for his lost bodyguard dog, relying on the guidance of resident dogs who don\u2019t speak his language. What starts as an adventure to find one dog soon turns into a quest to unravel a conspiracy.\n\nIsle of Dogs was the second animated film by Wes Anderson, and it takes a lot of inspiration from Japanese films, ranging from the Kurosawa-style staging of the dogs to the familiar Japanese music in the background. That alone should be a draw, but the distinct stop-motion style is intoxicating (especially the sushi cooking sequence), and the talented voice cast (Bryan Cranston, Edward Norton, Greta Gerwig) makes this picture such a refreshing change of pace for an animated film. If you love classic Japanese films, stop-motion animation, and dogs, this film should be at the top of your Anderson watchlist.\n\nBased on the short story by Roald Dahl, The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar focuses on the peculiar life of the wealthy Henry (Benedict Cumberbatch). Fascinated by the idea of being clairvoyant, Henry attempts to learn from a guru how to see without his eyes. While this new ability takes time to master, he uses it for gambling, but also manages to foresee his own death, which he cannot stop.\n\nAlthough originally intended to be a feature-length film, Wes Anderson kept his adaptation short and sweet, along with some other short Dahl adaptations he directed for Netflix. Cumberbatch\u2019s swift narration works so well for this film, which seems to proceed with the set dressing of a fast-paced play with its quick transitions from scene to scene. So much contemplation on life and riches is divulged in under an hour, proving that Anderson\u2019s style can work in short form, considering Henry Sugar won the Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film.\n\nOn the island of New Penzance, the orphaned boy scout Sam (Jared Gilman) has fallen in love with his pen pal, Suzy (Kara Hayward). With their lives bound by the monotony of adults who can\u2019t figure out their own lives, the two kids set off for a romantic getaway from the world that has shunned them. The adults must search for them quickly, as a deadly storm is on the horizon.\n\nMoonrise Kingdom finds Anderson focusing on the emotional wonder and hardships of growing up. Given the young protagonists, he gives these characters a mature honesty by depicting a weirdly believable perspective on young love. For this picture immersed in coming-of-age stories, Anderson\u2019s usual nostalgic hallmarks fit with the old-fashioned Boy Scouts troop and a love of classic books and records.\n\nSet in the 1950s, the remote desert town of Asteroid City attracts a crowd for the Junior Stargazer convention. The science convention makes an incredible discovery when aliens arrive, forcing the military to lock down the site. Amid all the curiosity and fears of aliens in the atomic age, the widowed father, Augie (Jason Schwartzman), tries to find the best way to break the sad news to his many children about their mom's death.\n\nAsteroid City cleverly tackles existentialism through the colorful desert location and the black-and-white framing device of a TV play. In addition to the film\u2019s eye-popping adherence to retro-futurism, there are some unforgettable performances in this picture from the supporting players, including Tom Hanks as the stern grandfather unwilling to accept Augie and Jeffrey Wright\u2019s lengthy yet speedy speech. Add a stop-motion alien and a musical number, and Anderson\u2019s foray into science fiction feels like an easy transition.\n\nDespite having a large and talented family, Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman) has grown distant and lonely from his ex-wife and children. To bring his kin back together, he fakes an illness to get everybody back in the same house. The dysfunctional family starts to get along despite all the tragedy and trauma that has lingered in their lives.\n\nThe Royal Tenenbaums was the film where Wes Anderson\u2019s style began solidifying. His ensemble ballooned, his shots became more gorgeous, and his tone embraced more retro whimsy. The performances in this film are fantastic, but Hackman stands out for being the cantankerous glue that brings all these characters together.\n\nBased on Roald Dahl's book of the same title, The Fantastic Mr. Fox depicts the quirky adventures of a fox and his animal friends. Although Mister Fox (George Clooney) adheres to his animal instincts of pilfering food from farms, he does so in a suit and with the wit of a skilled thief. He\u2019ll have to use all his smarts when his friends and family are threatened by the more aggressive actions of the farmers defending their food.\n\nAs his first animated film, Anderson applies his love of the retro to this stop-motion movie. His skill for blocking is ideally suited for animation, and the rough touches he applies to the medium give the many characters and scenes a tactile charm. The voice talent is also top-notch, boasting such big names as George Clooney and Meryl Streep, fitting easily into a Wes Anderson production (even if it only requires them being in front of a microphone).\n\nSet in 1930s Europe, hotel concierge Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) attempts to train his new lobby boy, Zero (Tony Revolori). Gustave, however, isn\u2019t the best boss, considering his sexual affair with a wealthy madam (Tilda Swinton), the swiping of her valuable painting that enrages her son (Adrien Brody), and the many scuffles he faces with local law enforcement, hitmen, and fascists.\n\nLoaded with lush colors and stunning cinematography, The Grand Budapest Hotel is Anderson\u2019s most gorgeous movie, ranging from the pristine decor of the hotel to the pink interior of a delivery truck. The performances are also a highlight, with Ralph Fiennes adding some dignity to his absurdity and Tony Revolori leaving a lasting impression. The film was so remarkable that it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture and won Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Original Score, and Best Production Design.\n\nMax (Jason Schwartzman) is a student who is a genius at setting up extracurricular activities but not much else. When he sets his romantic sights on the teacher, Ms. Cross (Olivia Williams), he finds he has competition with the disillusioned businessman Herman Blume (Bill Murray). The two rivals are willing to do anything for the love of Cross, despite how much it ruins their lives when bound by jealousy and revenge.\n\nRushmore features Anderson\u2019s writing at its cleverest, with a love triangle amid Max\u2019s most elaborate endeavors. Max\u2019s intricate school plays are a joy to watch, and watching Bill Murray amble with casual comedy made him a brilliant staple for Anderson\u2019s future films. It also features my favorite ending, where Max beautifully wraps up his relationships during his uproarious school play based on the Vietnam War with explosive special effects.\n\nWes Anderson has continued to be the most iconic film director of our age. His style is so recognizable that it\u2019s been parodied in everything from slasher movies to superhero ensembles. He\u2019s still making movies and delivering stylish pictures that delight as much as his witty and wry writing, and hopefully, he will have more of those films in him in the future.",

      "text": "Quick Links\nThe age of streaming hasn\u2019t diminished the appeal of physical media. If anything, the limitations of streaming services have made the perks of owning a Blu-ray more apparent. There\u2019s no worrying about whether or not the movie will be available on a streaming service (or anywhere online) if you own a physical copy.\nAnother major draw for physical media is the quality of the film\u2019s presentation, for both the disc and box art. The Criterion Collection has long been recognized for its high-quality releases. And while their streaming service has become more convenient, it hasn\u2019t replaced their Blu-rays.\nA History of Preserving History on Disc\nEven before they ventured into streaming, The Criterion Collection was churning out top-quality home video releases. From LaserDisc to Blu-ray, they have a history of providing the most pristine presentation of movies for your television. Basically, they\u2019re the distributor you went to for widescreen instead of pan-and-scan (the process of trimming a widescreen format to fit a non-widescreen screen).\nSome Criterion releases come and go, but the most classic films remain in their collection. Akira Kurosawa\u2019s Seven Samurai is one of the most legendary samurai films, having inspired numerous American Westerns. Jacques Tati\u2019s Mister Hulot\u2019s Holiday proved how well silent slapstick can survive the age of sound. Criterion even preserves more recent films, such as the Oscar-winning Anora, and the films of Wes Anderson.\nWhen Criterion Went Streaming\nBefore The Criterion Channel came to be, Criterion bounced its movies around various streaming services. In the early 2010s, Criterion had a deal with Hulu (read more about it in this CriterionCast article). They later partnered with Turner Classic Movies to launch the FilmStruck service in 2016. When FilmStruck was discontinued in 2018, The Criterion Channel filled that void in 2019, carrying over a few features from FilmStruck, like the Adventures in Moviegoing series of celebrity-hosted films.\nThe Criterion Channel stands out from other streaming services by streaming collections of movies instead of individual films each month. These can range from films by a specific director, such as John Carpenter, to a handful of 1940s noir films. The service also carried over many of the special features from Criterion Blu-ray releases, like audio commentaries and interviews.\nOne would think all these positives would make The Criterion Channel the ultimate substitute for Criterion's physical media, and yet it wasn\u2019t for me. It did help feed my hunger for ohysical media, though.\nThe Criterion Channel\nThe Criterion Channel boasts classic and revered films from around the world, most of which are featured in The Criterion Collection.\nStreaming: A Gateway to... Blu-rays?\nWhen I signed up for The Criterion Channel streaming service early, it was treated like a big deal. The company sent me a cute little metal card signifying my membership and granted me early access to the service, which was slowly streaming one movie at a time. But they also granted me a discount and coupons for their DVDs and Blu-rays.\nThe reduced price of their videos was a real draw because Criterion releases are not cheap. The average Criterion Blu-ray costs $40, which is a significant reason why I've only bought a few over the years. When Criterion DVDs were first released, I would rent as many as I could from my college library for the bargain price I was getting.\nThat hefty price tag for Blu-rays is what initially made me an easy champion of The Criterion Channel, and it being one of the few services that offers classic movies was also a big draw. Priced at $11 per month, you\u2019d be getting your money\u2019s worth even if you only watched one movie a month. Their collection boasts some of the best movies that I was often assigned to watch in school and had to hunt down if they weren\u2019t at the library. Yet I didn\u2019t find myself entirely resorting to the service as a substitute.\nWhere Have All the Classic Movies Gone?\nClassic movies haven't left streaming; you just have to know where to look.\nA Collector's Paradise\nMy Criterion subscription regularly sends me coupons that act as an incentive for the well-known Criterion Flash sales. Twice a year\u2014usually in late-February or early March and then in October\u2014the distributor offers a 24-hour sale with 50% off their entire catalog. Couple the reduced price with the membership discount, coupons, and reward points, and it\u2019s hard not to buy something from the sales. It's more than just the discounts and offers, too; there's also a communal experience of chatting with others about what we've purchased during the sale.\nAnd if that communal experience is something that appeals to you, too, Barnes & Noble puts on a 50% off Criterion sale every year that gets cinephiles the chance to commune IRL. I started venturing out to the store more regularly in late 2020 to get out of the house, and found a community forming around the store\u2019s Criterion section, even if we were all masked due to COVID. It wasn\u2019t uncommon to strike up a conversation with somebody debating whether they should grab that giant Godzilla boxed set. Mind you, The Criterion Channel offers no additional discounts through Barnes & Noble, but they do inform subscribers when the sale is happening. It feels more like an invitation to collectors, as inviting as going on Letterboxd.\nDo You Notice That Physical Media Is Better Quality Than Streaming?\nIf you're after high-definition music or video content, physical media reigns supreme. But even though that may be the case, lots of people struggle (or simply fail) to spot the difference anyway. Can you tell that streamed content is normally lower quality?\nI will admit there\u2019s an allure to how Criterion crafts their Blu-rays. The covers look nice, the printed inserts are stunning, and the numbered spines activate a level of collecting I haven\u2019t felt since playing Pok\u00e9mon on Gameboy. It was the incentives offered through the streaming service, however, that gave me the motivation to expand my DVD collection further.\nLining my shelves with the Criterion Collection has been a fun experience, and it\u2019s due in no small part to subscribing to The Criterion Channel. Much like MUBI and its subscription model, which offers a free movie ticket, Criterion encourages film lovers to engage rather than just filling up their watchlists. There\u2019s a physical component that makes collecting physical media more exciting, where opening their Blu-rays feels like cracking open a treasure chest. If some streaming services seem like the enemy of physical media, Criterion Channel has been more of an ally."
