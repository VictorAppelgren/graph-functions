  "content": "I HAD walked straight into 1959, surrounded by red and white Rydell High memorabilia and dazzling lights of carnival rides.\n\nSecret Cinema's, Grease: The Immersive Movie Musical had immediately transported me out of London in 2025 and landed me in the world of Sandy and Danny in the 1950s.\n\nWin one of 8 incredible holidays to the Caribbean, Mexico and Greece by voting in The Sun's Travel Awards - enter to win here\n\nIt was the latest edition of the immersive cinema company's productions that transport guests into the worlds we see on the screen, following the success of Casino Royal and Stranger Thing.\n\n\"Welcome to your first day of school,\" a women dressed in Rydell colours chimed.\n\nHundreds of guests - or should I say 'students' - had fully embraced the experience for the next few hours, dressing themselves in ankle-length skits, Pink Ladies Jackets and T-Birds leather.\n\nThe production staff even wore Greased Lightnin' mechanics outfits, splattered with oil.\n\nIt felt like a time machine had dropped me into the world of Sandy and Danny, more than 65 years in the past.\n\nGuests can purchase carnival tokens, just like at a real fair, to enjoy the attractions at the experience.\n\nThere was a Ferris wheel, flying chairs, hook-a-duck and even the iconic fun house from Sandy's unforgettable transformation scene.\n\nFood vendors line the edge of the carnival, where I opted for a \u00a313 vegan hot dog, complete with beer-infused onions. Pricey, for sure, but in line with what you would expect at a London event.\n\nAs for a tipple, the \u00a312.50 Lillet Hugo Spritz was a nice nod to The Pink Ladies - made with elderflower, rose and fresh mint.\n\nEventually, it was time to leave the carnival behind and step through the doors of Rydell High.\n\nInside, the school's gymnasium dominated the room, serving as the central stage for the night's performance.\n\nAround the edges, themed bars and seating areas were scattered - each also playing a role in the experience.\n\nMy table was at Frosty's Palace, which was decked out with blue and white booths and classic diner tables.\n\nThe table was then complete with a bottle of rose in an ice bucket - another subtle wink to The Pink Ladies.\n\nRows of vintage cars had been converted into tables, the auto shop was slick with oil and the bleachers were ready for Patty Simcox to screech about school spirit.\n\nEvery area had been well thought out with the creators not just producing a stage for a show, but a world to transport yourself into.\n\nThe experience kicks off with the film itself, but as key scenes played out, actors took to the stage to bring them to life, all before cutting back to the movie.\n\nMy only criticism would be that at times it felt a little overwhelming to the senses.\n\nI found myself on occasions unsure where to look or what to listen to as the sound from the film, orchestra and actors sometimes battle against each other.\n\nYet, the entire time my feet tapped and I couldn't help but sing along.\n\nAnd the entire performance really was full of unforgettable moment after unforgettable moment.\n\nOne guest, in a silver dress with curlers in her hair, was plucked from her seat to perform in the 'Beauty School Dropout' scene.\n\nIn another scene, Danny performed in his car whilst dancers flipped and spun around him.\n\nBoth the dancing and singing throughout the experience was breathtakingly flawless.\n\nThe energy to sing and dance simultaneously as they did, really deserves recognition.\n\nLiam Buckland - who played Danny - nailed John Travolta's swagger, complete with slicked-back hair and a cheeky-yet-charming attitude.\n\nUnlike traditional West End shows, most ticketholders stand and move freely about the room.\n\nThe actors even join in, chatting to guests whilst fully in character.\n\nOne student dropped by our table to rant about being 'left out of Frenchy's sleepover' - dragging us directly into the drama.\n\nFor the finale, the audience was led back outside to the carnival.\n\nSandy's final transformation scene with song 'You're the One That I Want' really did bring the house down.\n\nYes, there were leather trousers and red lippy.\n\nYes, they shimmied on the Shake Shack.\n\nYes, it did send the audience wild.\n\nBy the end of the night, one thing was clear: the experience really did 'have me a blast'.\n\nIn a city with so many stage shows and immersive experiences, Grease: The Immersive Movie Musical stood out like a Pink Lady's jacket in a sea of beige.\n\nThe experience runs until September 7 in Battersea Park, London and tickets cost from \u00a349 per person.\n\nI also headed to the new Traitors live experience - it was a heart-pounding world of lies and best friend-betrayal.\n\nAnd I have also seen the new Titanic immersive exhibition - I gasped as the iceberg hit but there was another \u2018wow\u2019 moment.",
