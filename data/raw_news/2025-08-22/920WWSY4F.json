  "description": "One of the best games in the 'Metal Gear Solid' series has finally been given a modern remake, and it is thoroughly superb.",
  "content": "One of the best games in the Metal Gear Solid series has finally been given a modern remake, and it is thoroughly superb.\n\nWhile I have fond memories of the first Metal Gear Solid back in 1998, it was very much a digitally designed stealth game. You had a (mostly) top-down view of the proceedings, with a radar that showed where your enemies were looking as well as moving, and you had ration packs that refilled your health.\n\nThe same was also true for the second game, although the addition of first-person elements did change things up somewhat (and no, the first game\u2019s Integral first-person mode is not the same functionally).\n\nHowever, what really elevated the series of Metal Gear Solid was its third and retro-themed game.\n\nSet in the 60s, gone were the radars that showed you where enemies were positioned as well as where they were looking, and food now replenished stamina rather than health. You also had to figure out what the best camouflage was to use in different parts of the jungle or in a hidden military base.\n\nThe third game, then, was as analogue as the decade in which it was set, and it made for a more organic and fluid stealth setup that was uniquely engaging, both then and now.\n\nIt also had some of the best boss fights ever in gaming, with my personal favorite being against the suitably ancient sniper, The End.\n\nThe story also set up the whole narrative arc for Big Boss, who would be a key figure in the original Metal Gear games.\n\nIn short, the third Metal Gear Solid was a masterful game back on the PlayStation 2, and this remake certainly does justice to that.\n\nNormally, when remakes happen, a lot is updated functionally, and you sometimes lose key elements that made the game special along the way. Quality of life improvements that make the game more manageable in a modern sense can often shortcut elements that were there to increase tension or complexity.\n\nIn the few rare cases where this doesn\u2019t happen, you end up with something quite special.\n\nThat is what this remake is. It\u2019s a very faithful remake of the original game, down to precise recreations of areas and even cutscene animations, but still affords players the choice for a more modern control scheme, among other things.\n\nWhat makes this especially remarkable is that all of this has been done within Unreal Engine 5, which has an entirely new and different toolset in terms of the backend.\n\nWhile everyone tends to focus on the graphical side of things with middleware engines such as these, it\u2019s the toolsets they offer that can often functionally skew how a game gets made and eventually plays.\n\nIn this instance, Delta handles like the original PlayStation 2 game did, and that is both wonderful and eerie to behold.\n\nIt also brings me to the elephant in the room: this game was made without Hideo Kojima\u2019s involvement. Not that I ever bought into the great-man myth surrounding Kojima in the first place, as it\u2019s well documented that he didn\u2019t come up with the original Metal Gear, many still think he was the key element in making the Metal Gear Solid games work.\n\nThe reality, as with most things, is far more mundane; games are made by large teams of people who all bring various aspects to how any game turns out.\n\nSo what this remake proves, pretty empirically, is that the people who made the Metal Gear Solid games great are still at Konami and are capable as well as adaptable enough to remake a game this accurately with an entirely new and off-the-shelf toolset.\n\nTo explain why this is such a big deal, whenever you take source code and assets from an old game and port them to a new engine and toolset, almost everything breaks. People have to then go in and adjust all the settings and variables to fit the new engine and toolset.\n\nThis is a difficult, painstaking, and, most importantly of all, a very manual process. One person is nowhere near enough to be able to do all that work on a game this big. This is why it\u2019s such a smoking gun in showing that game development is a team-based, very collaborative endeavor.\n\nAll of this is what really makes Delta stand out for me. Yes, it plays brilliantly and also incredibly faithfully to the original, but the team behind this did all of that in an engine and toolset that was not at all created for this game, and it still plays identically.\n\nMy only criticism, and it is a very slight one, is that they could have flexed their collective creative muscles a bit more and added in a few more things of their own. However, I think with Kojima\u2019s PR shadow looming as it is, they were sadly forced to play it safe.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning here that it\u2019s really nice to have David Hayter back and voicing Snake. His absence from Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain, despite Akio Ohtsuka\u2019s continued inclusion in the Japanese version, suggested something deeply petty at work. Thankfully, that has been rectified, and the real voice of Snake has finally returned.\n\nOverall, Metal Gear Solid Delta is a superb remake of probably the best stealth action game ever made. It\u2019s even more impressive that this was achieved with an insane level of accuracy in a completely separate engine and toolset. I would even go so far as to say that this version supersedes the original in almost every way, and comes highly recommended to anyone who wants to crawl on their belly through a jungle while eating snakes.\n\nDisclosure: Konami sent me a copy of this game for the purposes of this review.\n\nFollow me on , and . I also manage and am currently featured in the exhibition currently touring Japan.",

      "text": "News: New Gundam Extreme VS 2 X Boost Media Previews Brand New Units\nPosted on : 19-10-2020 | By : donkey show | In : News\nHardware: Arcade\n0\nWith the upcoming arcade closed beta test announced in November for the latest in the Extreme VS series, EXVS2 X Boost, the newest teaser imagery showcases some brand new units to the fold!\n- Unicorn Gundam Unit 3 Phenex from Mobile Suit Gundam NT\n- Gundam Flauros from Iron Blooded Orphans\n- Kabakali from Reconguista in G\n- Star Build Strike from Gundam Build Fighters\nOne of these lucky units will actually be added to the current EXVS2 roster, whereas the other three will have to wait until the X Boost official release. We don\u2019t exactly know what the prerequisites are, but I\u2019m assuming it will be the Unicorn Phenex since the current NT lineup is missing its flagship mobile suit.\nAs for those patiently waiting for Maxiboost ON DLC for their home versions, there\u2019s still no news to be had. But at least the game is still getting regular quality of life updates as evidenced by the recent v1.06 patch that vastly improved matchmaking options.\nNews: Gundam Extreme VS Maxiboost ON announced for PS4 in JP/NA/EU in 2020\nPosted on : 27-01-2020 | By : donkey show | In : News\nHardware: PlayStation 4\n1\nGundam Extreme VS Maxiboost ON is finally coming to the PS4 in 2020, and fans around the world cannot wait.\nIn a surprise announcement during the 2020 Gundam VS stream by Bandai Namco last week which also celebrated the 10th anniversary of the Gundam Extreme VS franchise, players were treated with the announcement that Maxiboost ON (MBON or MakiON depending on where you\u2019re from) is heading to home consoles this year. With many players thinking the VS franchise was never returning after the lackluster reception of Gundam Versus, Bandai Namco finally delivered what they wanted, another entry in the EXVS series. What made it even more satisfying was that the NA and EU branches announced the game was being localized as well, which was met with huge applause.\nSo what can we expect from MBON on the PS4? For now, we get all 183 playable units across 36 Gundam series that were last available before Bandai Namco moved onto Gundam Extreme VS 2. So we\u2019ll see newcomers that also appeared in Gundam Versus such as Thunderbolt\u2019s Full Armor Gundam and Psycho Gundam and Crossbone Gundam\u2019s Phantom Gundam, among many others. Local multiplayer is back as well for those who don\u2019t want to jump into the online madness. As for the rest of the content, we can expect the usual stuff from previous home entries, such as arcade routes, boss rush, mission modes and of course online co-op and online versus. I also wouldn\u2019t expect the roster to be final as I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll get DLC in the form of units from Gundam Versus/Gundam EXVS 2, similar to how Full Boost got Maxi Boost units as DLC.\nHere\u2019s to hoping we hear more of a detailed release date in the near future, but until then, I\u2019m planning on firing up Full Boost on my PS3 to get some needed practice! Check out the North American announce trailer below while you\u2019re at it and let us know what you think!\nVideos: Starwing Paradox Finally Gets Some Proper Gameplay Footage\nPosted on : 02-10-2018 | By : Cacophanus | In : Videos\nHardware: Arcade\n2\nOver at 4Gamer, they have a new interview with one of the developers behind the upcoming arcade mecha game Starwing Paradox. Released later this year in the Japanese arcades, it utilizes the talents of Yoshiyuki Sadamoto for the character designs and Ippei Gyoubu for the mecha. Up until now, the game has been looking great but we now finally have some gameplay footage of the game in action (shown below) and now I am not so sure about it.\nPut simply, Starwing Paradox looks a lot like a multiplayer version of Another Century\u2019s Episode R on the PS3 and that\u2019s not good really. Admittedly, Starwing Paradox has a different control setup and a bespoke motion activated cabinet but even then, this kind of aerial ranged combat approach with analog boosting, as per the flawed Zone of the Enders games, doesn\u2019t fill me with much hope.\nHowever, the only thing here that gives me hope is that Byking is behind Starwing Paradox. They are a solid developer that made the initial Gundam Extreme Versus games, as well as crazily awesome games like Gunslinger Stratos. Admittedly, Byking also made Magician\u2019s Dead and that was mostly terrible but I am still hoping that Starwing Paradox will turn out okay, despite this somewhat worrying gameplay footage.\nVideos: New Gundam Extreme Versus 2 Intro Video and PV\nPosted on : 30-09-2018 | By : donkey show | In : Videos\nHardware: Arcade\n1\nAs the arcade release of Gundam Extreme Versus 2 gets closer, Bandai Namco have finally revealed the intro animatic and several new mobile suits to the fray!\nThe new intro includes some new faces to the franchise, which now has a stunning roster of over 160 units! Some of these new units include the following:\n- Try Burning Gundam\n- Gundam Barbatos Lupus Rex\n- Gundam AGE-1 Granza\n- Zaku Amazing\n- Montero\n- Astray Blue Frame D\n- Gundam Maxter\nThey\u2019ve also released a new PV detailing some new additions to the gameplay system, including two new burst types:\n- Mobility Burst\n- Linkage Burst\nGundam Extreme Versus 2 will be entering Japanese arcades on October 30th, 2018. We\u2019ll continue to update you with more information as it comes along. Until then, let us know what you think in the comments!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvhLrC-MKWk\nNews: Gundam Extreme Versus 2 Initial Roster And Location Tests Announced\nPosted on : 04-05-2018 | By : donkey show | In : News\nHardware: Arcade\n1\nAs the rest of the world has Gundam Versus on the PS4, Japanese arcades are gearing up for the upcoming Gundam Versus Extreme 2. On May 12 and 13, stores in Tokyo and Osaka will be able to play test the game for the first time. There\u2019s also some confirmation on the playable roster, including three new entries to the franchise:\n- Tri Burning Gundam \u2013 new\n- Gundam Maxter \u2013 new\n- Gundam Barbatos Lupus Rex \u2013 new\n- Hi-Nu Gundam\n- Nightingale\n- Extreme Gundam Type Leos II Vs\n- Gundam Kimaris Trooper\n- Astray Red Frame\n- Astray Blue Frame\nAs Gundam Versus appears to have floundered a bit since releasing last year, it will be interesting to see if they continue to share units between this game and the console version. As always, we\u2019ll let you know more as it comes along. Let us know what you think of the three new units!\nReviews: Super Robot Wars X (9/10)\nPosted on : 08-04-2018 | By : Cacophanus | In : Reviews\nHardware: PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita\n0\nSince the end of the Z series, the Super Robot Wars games have tried to change up the setup somewhat, such as including series without mecha in Super Robot Wars V. Well, the latest Super Robot Wars X follows on from that and but a fresh isekai angle to the mix.\nFrom the start, Super Robot Wars X wears its isekai, or alternate world, intentions on its sleeve. With the inclusion of such series as Aura Battler Dunbine and Machine Hero Wataru, the whole premise feels very fantasy themed. Something that is only emphasized further with the main OG mecha being a magic-oriented unit.\nVideos: Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme VS 2 Announced For 2018\nPosted on : 11-02-2018 | By : donkey show | In : News, Videos\nHardware: Arcade\n2\nBandai Namco have recently announced that Mobile Suit Gundam Extreme VS 2 will be hitting arcades in 2018. Unlike Gundam Versus, this is being positioned as a true sequel to the Extreme VS franchise which started in 2018. We can only assume this will continue the crazy manga-based story of jumping between Gundam timelines and universes to stop some wacky AI that threatens to destroy everything. And as to be expected from previously released Extreme VS titles like Maxi Boost and Maxi Boost ON, it probably will not head to the console space any time soon.\nAs always, we\u2019ll let you know when more is announced! Until then, check out the teaser video below and let us know what you think!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvhLrC-MKWk\nVideos: Build Strike Gundam, Farsia, Gundam Pixie, and Efreet Schneid Coming To Gundam Versus\nPosted on : 16-01-2018 | By : donkey show | In : News, Videos\nHardware: PlayStation 4\n0\nSeveral new DLC units have been announced during the Gundam Games Announcement stream on January 16. Aside from revealing God and Master Gundam gameplay, we saw Missing Link units Gundam Pixie and Efreet Schneid, Farsia from Gundam Age, and a fan favorite in Build Strike Gundam Full Package from Gundam Build Fighters. We were also given proper release dates for the units below, including a separate G Sound DLC package for those that did not buy the Premium G Sound Edition:\n- Jan. 23: God Gundam, Master Gundam, G Sound DLC, Update 1.10\n- Jan. 30: Gundam Pixie, Farsia\n- Feb. 6: Build Strike Full Package, Efreet Schneid\nAs to whether or not the G Sound edition will be available outside of Japan is still yet to be determined. In regards to the units, perhaps we\u2019ll be seeing more Build Fighters units now that the titular protagonist from the first series has been added. Until then, check out the video below to see Build Strike gameplay and the rest of the announcements as well, such as G Generation Genesis for the Switch and a tease of the new Gundam Breaker for the PS4!\nNews: Border Break is Finally Coming to PS4\nPosted on : 14-01-2018 | By : Cacophanus | In : News, Videos\nHardware: PlayStation 4\n1\nBack in 2009, you may remember that we reviewed the awesome Border Break. Well, it finally seems that after nearly a decade the game will be getting a console port on the PS4. Not only will the game support mouse input, along with DualShock 4, it will also have an all-new story mode. The console version of Border Break will also come in two major flavors; an online free-to-play version and a boxed release with most of the content included. The free-to-play setup is actually not that far from how the game currently works in the arcades, so it will be interesting to see how it does. While there is no news yet on when this PS4 version of Border break will be released, there are plans for an open-beta sometime in February. It is also worth pointing out that the game is currently only slated for a Japanese release but considering the fact that the PS4 is region free means you will still be able to easily import and play the game."

      "text": "- \"I am The End, I am here to bring you to your ultimate fate.\"\n- \u2015The End\nThe End was the legendary \"Ancient Sniper\" of the Cobra Unit. He was over 100 years old when he was defeated by Naked Snake in 1964.\nQuick Answers\nWhat abilities did the parasite infection give to The End?\nHow did The End gain his reputation as the world's greatest sniper?\nWhat was the outcome of The End's boss fight with Naked Snake?\nWhere can players find The End's camouflage in Metal Gear Solid 3?\nHow did The End contribute to the ending of Metal Gear Solid 3?\nBiography[]\nEarly life and career[]\nBorn in the early 1860s,[1] The End was a veteran of countless wars. At some point in his life, he was infected with a species of parasite, greatly increasing his lifespan and giving him several abilities that made him a natural sniper. He went on to gain a reputation as the world's greatest sniper, having originated all sniping techniques, he became known as the \"Father of Sniping.\" He would later pass this knowledge on to The Boss. He employed camouflage techniques that made him invisible, even in the brightest, most exposed areas. He was said to never require a spotter, and could stay in the same prone sniping position without moving for days or even weeks at a time.\nThe closest to an actual spotter was his pet parrot. Adding even more to his formidable arsenal was his own body which was said to have been photosynthetic. The End also wore false teeth and had the ability to bulge his eyes out of their sockets. At some point after World War II, he modified his Mosin Nagant to fire tranquilizer darts.\nOperation Snake Eater[]\n- See also: Virtuous Mission and Operation Snake Eater\nIn August 1964, during the Virtuous Mission, The End was among the Cobra Unit members on board the Hind A in Tselinoyarsk, who greeted The Boss when she defected. After being reunited with their leader, he and the Cobras joined forces with Colonel Volgin of GRU.\nA week later, during Operation Snake Eater, Naked Snake saw The End accompanying The Boss to meet with Volgin at the Ponizovje warehouse. Due to his advanced age, his sleeping body was carried there in a wheelchair by The Fear. The End was conserving his remaining energy until the time came for his battle with Snake. With The Fear departing to halt the progress of her former disciple, The Boss assured Volgin that Snake would be \"ended\" by the famed sniper, should the time come. After the meeting concluded, The End was wheeled back inside the warehouse by one of the GRU sentries.\nThe End then waited in the forest of Sokrovenno, although he was asleep when Snake arrived and thus resulting in his parrot waking him. He then prayed to the forest to linger in life for a little longer and grant him enough strength for his final hunt. He also thanked Snake for arriving, as his own sleep would have been eternal if he hadn't shown up, and announced his intention of sending Snake to his ultimate fate, declaring that Snake was fitting for his final hunt. He then battled Naked Snake in a long sniper duel in Sokrovenno. Eventually, Snake defeated The End, with the foliage on his ghillie suit shifting from green to orange, like dying leaves. Before he died, he gave a speech in which he thanked the forest for giving him strength. He also thanked Snake, saying that The Boss would be proud of him. His last words were, \"I can return to the forest at last,\" before his microbomb detonated.\nAfter death[]\nSome time after The End's death, an old Din\u00e9 known as Code Talker would recover his remains (specifically body parts that were left after the microbomb detonated) and conduct research on them, discovering the parasite that gave him his abilities. His comrade The Pain was also autopsied for his parasites. Later, Skull Face would use that same parasite to create his own elite unit, and begin a scheme to kill English as a language (as the parasite only grows malignant when its host speaks a certain language, making ideal as an ethnicity-targeting weapon). Due to the photosynthetic properties of his cells from the parasites, The End's cells were able to stay alive as well as they had water and sunlight, much like how plant cells can still be alive after being separate from the plant. This allowed his cells to remain alive and metabolizing even after he died, allowing Code Talker to harvest his cells to do research on them years after he died.\nNearly a decade later, in 1974 at Costa Rica, Naked Snake, now known as Big Boss, remembered his fight with The End, asking his allies, to their confusion, whether it was possible to photosynthesize while lazing off or whether the Peace Sentinel's snipers also had parrots.\nOcelot would later allude to The End while discussing Quiet's photosynthetic abilities with Venom Snake not long after incarcerating her in 1984 (entirely appropriate, considering she had a variant of the same parasite).\nPersonality and traits[]\nAs with the other members of the Cobra Unit, The End's codename signified the emotion he felt while on the battlefield; in his case, total oblivion. In battle, he blocked out everything except his targets, allowing himself to focus on his \"hunt.\" Because he was very old and incredibly close to death, he would often fall asleep during battle. His closest companion, a parrot, acted as his spotter and would wake him up when he fell asleep, referring to him as \"Grandpa.\"\nDue to being infected with a unique type of parasite strain, The End was given supernatural abilities that enhanced his performance during combat operations. The parasites gave him an increased life span as well as allowing him to remain active for days without food through the process of photosynthesis. Apart from these abilities, the parasites gave The End a heightened sense of perception that allowed him to operate on an elite level without the aid of a spotter, making him a deadly opponent.\nThe End was also an expert on camouflage. His uniform was a special ghillie suit with a form of natural moss that added more camouflage to himself, and the sniping positions he chose to conceal himself well, The moss would also react to his health state such as turning brown when he was close to death implying a deeper connection with his powers. It also seemed that he had some sort of control over plant-life, as Sokrovenno's exit was blocked by a small weave of thick branches that only strangely withdrew after his death. When in a prone position, he became \"one\" with the area; his body temperature lowered so that it was close to that of the surrounding foliage. This made spotting him with thermal goggles difficult. Additionally, when The End's stamina dropped dangerously low, he would absorb the sun's rays and recover his stamina quickly. While doing so, the liver spots on his head would disappear and he became rejuvenated, gaining a slightly younger appearance.\nDespite his geriatric body and need for care outside of battle, he was able to run at advanced speed when it came to running from position to position and was even capable of knocking back Snake easily when confronted physically.\nThe End was armed with a M1891/30 Mosin-Nagant sniper rifle, a Russian-made bolt-action rifle used during both World Wars. His model was modified to fire special tranquilizer rounds. His Mosin-Nagant also had a folding paratrooper's stock and a pistol grip. Although he could easily have handled a Dragunov SVD, The End opted to use the Mosin-Nagant instead because of his gentle nature and unwillingness to kill. He would also use stun grenades, should an enemy get too close to him, in order to escape and find a new sniping location.\nBehind the scenes[]\nThe End (\u30b8\u30fb\u30a8\u30f3\u30c9 Ji Endo?) was developed from elements of Old Boy, a character who was cut from the final version of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. He was originally supposed to be named \"The Doom,\" but it was cut in large part because of the release of the game Doom 3.[2] The End was in part named after a song by the band \"The Doors.\"[3]\nThe End's parrot is the same one featured in Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, owned by Emma Emmerich.[4]\nHideo Kojima originally wanted the boss fight to last one to two weeks but was told that this was impossible and not recommended.[5]\nMetal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater[]\nThe End first appears in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, voiced by J. Grant Albrecht in English and Osamu Saka in Japanese. He is fought by the player in a boss battle, which was named the fourth greatest of all time by Electronic Gaming Monthly,[6] and was rated #3 in the \"Top Ten Video Game Sniper Moments\" by Game Informer.\nBecause of the nature of his boss fight, The End is the only boss in the game that lacks a boss battle theme.\nIn the HD versions, killing The End early or killing The End in his boss battle will result in the unlocking of the trophies/achievements \"The Early End\" and \"The End\", respectively. In addition, successfully holding up The End in the boss battle will result in the achievement/trophy \"You Snooze, You Lose\" being unlocked.\nMetal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence[]\nIn Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence, The End makes an appearance in the Secret Theater movie, He's Still Got It, where he became infatuated with Tatyana (EVA), as she walked by him at the Ponizovje warehouse, \"reviving him.\" He then began stalking her, even tranquilizing Ocelot when he was intimidating her at Groznyj Grad. However, he ended up becoming angered at Naked Snake due to his advancing on her, until his heart finally broke after discovering (while hiding under a tigerskin rug) that EVA had reciprocated Snake's feelings, at the Alaskan retreat. He decided to try and snipe EVA the morning afterwards, while waiting outside of the retreat. However, he became too involved with his monologue and was run over by EVA's motorcycle, causing his death and eventual microbomb detonation.\nMetal Gear Solid: Peace Walker[]\nIn Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, The End makes a vocal cameo in several \"Dead Man's Treasure\" missions, in the mission if the player uses the Codec. The End \"contacts\" Big Boss from the grave, using the radio frequency 000.00.[7] Another reference to him is in the form of a reward in which the player gets, the Neo-Moss uniform, if they contact The End in Extra Ops [062] and then completing the mission; the rank achieved does not matter. However, this uniform does not regenerate stamina/psych like his original one did as it lacks the photosynthetic properties of the original Moss camouflage. Despite this, it is still the uniform that offers the highest camouflage index in Peace Walker. J. Grant Albrecht and Osamu Saka both return to voice the role, while Saka also voices the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\nThe End is also heavily referenced in the game's audio file conversations. In one example, Big Boss asks if any of the enemy snipers are accompanied by parrots, while in another, he muses as to whether it is possible to photosynthesize with very little foliage.\nVersus Battle[]\nThe End also appeared on the series official site's Versus Battle, where he competed against Sniper Wolf.\n- \"STRENGTHS:\nThe World\u2019s Most Legendary Sniper\nWEAKNESSES:\nA Mere Week Away From Death\nFEATURED FACT:\nThe father of sniping, The End was unmatched with a rifle,fought in countless conflicts, was over 100 years old, and even mentored The Boss\nFEATURED GAME:\nMETAL GEAR SOLID: THE LEGACY COLLECTION\" - \u2015The End's bio in Versus Battle\nMetal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes[]\nThe End, alongside his comrades in the Cobra Unit, also appear in the Ground Zeroes app, acting as officer characters in the Mother Base Developer. The End specifically is unlocked by obtain a tranquilizer headshot of 130m while connected to the app.\nGameplay[]\nBoss battle[]\nIn Metal Gear Solid 3, the player fights The End in an area spanning three zones: Sokrovenno North, South and West. It is a thick forest, divided into a river, a plateau, and a clearing. He will under no circumstances kill Snake, choosing to tranquilize him instead.\nThe End's tranquilizer rounds will drain Snake's stamina, causing his hands to shake. This effect can be countered with the Animals uniform, which is found in the Chyornaya Peschera Cave after defeating Ocelot in a non-lethal duel. However, Snake will eventually collapse if the dart is not removed from his body or if he does not eat any food. After Snake faints, The End will carry him back to the prison in Graniny Gorki.\nIf his parrot is killed, The End will find it more difficult to track Snake's movements. However, this will make him enraged and more aggressive. Regardless of whether or not the player killed the parrot, it will still appear in the cutscene after the battle. However, if his parrot is captured and then released, it will give away his position on the Directional Mic even more so than his breathing.\nIf the player, with the SVD, had shot The End at Ponizovje without killing him, The End will have lowered health and stamina by the time the player fights The End at Sokrovenno.[8]\nIt is also possible to use the thermal goggles to track The End's movements.\nThe End's rifle scope causes lens flare. His voice and breathing can be heard via Directional Mic when pointed in his direction, though this is usually rather faint.\nMosin-Nagant and Moss Camo[]\nThe End is one of only two bosses in Metal Gear Solid 3 where the player will not receive his camouflage if he is defeated non-lethally (the other is The Sorrow). They will instead receive The End's Mosin-Nagant, which will be located near Snake in Sokrovenno North. Because the Patriot and Single Action Army are the only weapons that are carried over in a new playthrough, the player must defeat The End non-lethally each time to acquire his Mosin-Nagant. To receive his Moss camo, the player must hold him up and keep pointing any gun at his head for a certain period of time (holding him up if the player already got the Moss Camo, however, will only have The End supplying medical supplies and a ration).\nIt is the only uniform that actually provides a full 100% Camo Index when it's raining, but only in certain terrains. When it is not raining, however, the camo index will be 95% (though it can be raised to 100% with the Woodland facepaint). It can also recover Snake's stamina if he encounters certain forms of light (not just sunlight itself). It is advised that the player hold up The End away from screen transitions; otherwise he may drop the camo on a transition path, making it impossible to collect.\nAvoiding the fight[]\nThere are two non-canon ways to defeat The End without fighting him directly:\n- The player can snipe him immediately after his first appearance at the Ponizovje Warehouse. If the player succeeds in killing him, the explosion from his microbomb will send a wheel of his wheelchair flying towards Snake, so it is advised that they quickly dodge it after killing him. Doing this in the Metal Gear Solid: HD Collection version of the game will award the player the achievements/trophies The Early End and The End. The Ocelot Unit will be waiting to ambush Snake in Sokrovenno if Snake chooses this. If Snake kills him via this method, Zero and the other support team members will congratulate him for killing him, although Snake will express disappointment in killing him in the manner that he did, as he was hoping that he'd actually face him in battle.\n- Another way is to wait for nature itself to take him. If the player saves their game in the middle of the battle and waits over a week (At least 8 days) before playing again, The End will have died of old age. The player can also just set their PlayStation 2's internal clock 8 days ahead to get the same result. Similar to the above, when Naked Snake calls his support team, they will decide that Snake is the winner by default, although Snake feels that he had disappointed The End by failing to face him before his death. Also, The End's microbomb will detonate posthumously by his parrot after his demise and the call.\n- If the player resumes the battle after a few days, it will in result in a cutscene where The End ambushes Snake while he's sleeping. Since The End is only using tranquilizers, Snake will awake in a cell in Graniny Gorki. The cell is open, so Snake can simply walk out. He will need to go on foot back to Sokrovenno to continue the battle with The End.\nOther[]\nIf the player fails to kill The End when given the opportunity at the warehouse, a GRU soldier will wheel him inside.\nIf the player uses the Konami Code on the Map Screen during the battle, it will reveal The End's location if he is in that area of the map.\nIf the player punches The End during his fight with The Sorrow, The End will turn over.\nAppearances[]\n- Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater\n- Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker (mentioned)\n- Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (mentioned)\nNon-canonical[]\nSources[]\nGallery[]\nSee also[]\n- Parrot\n- Cobra Unit\n- Metal Gear Solid 3 secrets\n- Sokrovenno (battle guide)\n- Sniper Wolf\nReferences[]\n- ^ METAL GEAR SOLID 3 : SNAKE EATER CHARACTER.

His games are noted for being highly cinematic, the result of a passion for film and literature which began during his childhood, and he is regarded as a pioneering auteur of video games.[1] He is known for the Metal Gear franchise, which remains his most famous and acclaimed work, as well as the Death Stranding duology.\nUpon joining Konami in 1986, Kojima directed, designed, and wrote Metal Gear (1987) for the MSX2. The game laid the foundation for the stealth game genre and the renowned Metal Gear franchise, which he continued to helm up to the release of Metal Gear Solid V (2015). During his time at Konami, he also produced the Zone of the Enders series, as well as designing and writing Snatcher (1988) and Policenauts (1994); these were graphic adventure games that came to be regarded for their cinematic presentation.\nKojima founded Kojima Productions within Konami in 2005, and was appointed vice president of Konami Digital Entertainment in 2011. Following the controversial cancellation of his project, Silent Hills, and his departure from Konami in 2015, he re-established Kojima Productions as an independent studio and released his first games outside Konami with Death Stranding (2019) and Death Stranding 2: On the Beach (2025). The first game received mostly positive reviews, while its sequel received widespread acclaim.\nEarly life\n[edit]Hideo Kojima was born in the Setagaya ward of Tokyo[2] on August 24, 1963.[3] He has two older siblings.[4][5] His father, Kingo, was a pharmacist who frequently traveled for business and named his son Hideo as it was the most common name among the doctors he met.[6] He moved with his family to Osaka at the age of four; he later described this stage of his early life as an abrupt change of environment that led him to spend much of his time thereafter indoors, where he would watch television or make figurines.[7] His parents were passionate about cinema\u2014especially European films, horror, and Westerns\u2014and began a nightly tradition of watching a film with their children, who were not allowed to go to bed until the film had finished; his parents also did not limit the type of films the children were allowed to see, regardless of content.[5]\nKojima took an interest in filmmaking when a friend brought a Super 8 camera to high school and began making films together, charging other children \u00a550 to see them.[8] He tricked his parents into funding a four-day trip to an island off the coast of Japan without telling them that he was going there because he wanted to use it as a filming location; however, he instead spent his time there swimming, and changed the film's plot to be about zombies on the final day as this idea would be quicker to shoot.[9] He did not show the film to his parents.[10]\nBy Kojima's teenage years, the family had moved to the city of Kawanishi, Hy\u014dgo.[11] When he was 13 years old, his father died,[12] and his mother later died in early 2017.[13][14] In interviews, he has discussed the impact of his father's death and the subsequent financial hardship faced by his family.[15][16][17] He studied economics at university,[18] where he decided to join the video game industry.[19] He wrote fiction while studying, even including a short story in his thesis.[20]\nCareer\n[edit]Early career\n[edit]While still in university, Kojima was initially searching for a way into the film industry. He hoped that if he were to win awards for his written fiction, he would be approached about directing a film.[21] At that time, he saw Nintendo's Famicom and thought of joining the video game industry. He said he had no friends interested in cinema to encourage him,[22] and his friends were also not supportive when he announced his intention to enter game development. He would frequently lie about his occupation in the early days of his career, when working in video games was seen as a \"very low status\" job and the word for a video game designer did not exist in the Japanese language, and instead told people he worked for a financial firm; during a wedding reception, the other guests laughed at him when the groom introduced him by saying, \"[Kojima's] a very talented and otherwise likeable person. But I am sorry to say that, for some unknown reason, he has decided to join a video game company.\"[23][24]\nKojima joined video game publisher Konami's MSX home computer division in 1986. He applied to Konami because it was the only game developer listed on the Japanese stock exchange.[25] He was disappointed with the job initially, hoping to make games for the Famicom, and feeling that the 16 colour palette of the MSX was too restrictive.[26] The first game he worked on was Penguin Adventure, the sequel to Antarctic Adventure, as an assistant director.[27] It significantly expanded upon the gameplay of Antarctic Adventure, adding more action game elements, a greater variety of levels, role-playing elements such as upgrading equipment, and multiple endings. In 2019, Polygon's Julia Lee wrote that for \"a game made over 30 years ago, Penguin Adventure had some in-depth features\".[27] After Penguin Adventure, Kojima started to design a game called Lost Warld [sic], but the game was canceled when it was found to be too complex to run on the MSX.[28]\nMetal Gear and Snatcher (1987\u20131990)\n[edit]Kojima was asked to take over a project, Metal Gear, from a senior associate.[29] Hardware limitations hindered the development of the game's combat, and Kojima altered the gameplay to focus on a prisoner escaping instead of fighting, inspired by The Great Escape.[30] It was released on July 13, 1987, for the MSX2 home computer in Japan,[31] and on September in that year for Europe.[32] The player controls a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake, who is sent to the fortified state of Outer Heaven to stop a nuclear-equipped walking tank known as \"Metal Gear\". Metal Gear is one of the earliest examples of the stealth game genre.[33][34][35] A port of Metal Gear was released for the NES in 1987, with altered graphics, difficulty, and an abridged ending without the titular weapon.[36] Kojima has openly criticized many of the changes made in the port, including poor translation and the abridged ending. In an interview, a programmer on the NES version of the game said his team were asked to complete the port in only three months, and the NES hardware was not capable of implementing the Metal Gear fight.[36]\nHis next project was the graphic adventure game Snatcher, released for the NEC PC-8801 and MSX2 computer platforms in Japan on November 26, 1988.[37] Kojima wrote and directed the game.[38] Kojima planned for the game, a graphic adventure with visual novel elements, to have six chapters, but was instructed to trim it down to two.[39] The team wanted to create a third chapter, but were already over the allowed development schedule so were forced to end the game on a cliffhanger.[40] The cyberpunk-influenced game has a semi-open world design. Kojima and character designer Tomiharu Kinoshita treated the project like making a film or anime rather than a game.[41] Former Konami artist Satoshi Yoshoioka designed many of Snatcher's characters, said he was persistently guided by Kojima to make the game as cinematic as possible, which later critics have cited as a staple of his work.[42] Adrian Chen of The New York Times wrote that one of his innovations was \"the way he applied cinematic storytelling to console video games\".[17] Snatcher draws heavily from Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982), and includes enough references that the game strays near copyright infringement.[43] A port for the Sega CD was made without Kojima, but the amount of text and length of the script made localisation expensive and time-consuming, taking three months.[44] Snatcher was modestly successful in Japan, but the western port was a commercial failure, selling only a few thousand units.[45] It has developed a cult following in the west.[46]\nIn 1990, Kojima wrote a remake of Snatcher, SD Snatcher, a role-playing video game which adapted the storyline of the original Snatcher but significantly changed the environments, details of the plot, and core gameplay mechanics. The \"SD\" stands for \"super deformed\" in Japanese media, another way to reference chibi character designs.[47] The characters are depicted in a \"super deformed\" art style, in contrast to the original game's realistic style. Like the original computer versions of Snatcher, it was only released in Japan. It abandoned random encounters and introduced a first-person turn-based battle system where the player can aim at specific parts of the enemy's body with guns. Such a battle system has rarely been used since,[48] but similar ones can later be found in the role-playing games Square's Vagrant Story (2000), Bethesda Softworks's Fallout 3 (2008), and Nippon Ichi's Last Rebellion (2010).[49] In 2007, J. C. Fletcher of Engadget said that Kojima's choice to stylise the character designs \"was some postmodern playfulness from Hideo Kojima [...] downplaying the dramatic aspects of his game and overlaying obvious video game conventions on top of it\", and connected that to a similar playfulness in his later games.[50]\nMetal Gear 2 and Policenauts (1990\u20131994)\n[edit]The original Metal Gear was a commercial success for its release on the NES, and Konami decided to create a sequel to the game, Snake's Revenge, without the involvement of Kojima.[51] When Kojima was riding on the Tokyo transit system, he was told about Snake's Revenge by a colleague working on the project, who asked him to make a new Snake game of his own.[51] As a result, Kojima began work on his own sequel, Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, and the two were both released in 1990. Kojima's game would not be released overseas in North America and Europe until its inclusion in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence (2006).[52][53] Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake was a commercial success. The game has received positive reviews from retro-reviewers. IGN notes that Metal Gear 2 introduced stealth mechanics such as making noise to attract guards, crouching and crawling on the ground, disarming mines, and enemies having view cones.[54]\nAfter memory limitation issues prompted him to take a break during the development of Snatcher, Kojima began to explore concepts for Policenauts.[55] He wanted the game to remain in the adventure genre, feeling it was the best method to express what he wanted with video games.[55] He was also growing frustrated with game development and wanted \"a way to take creative control back from the programmers\".[56] After the release of Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake (1990), he developed a scripting engine so he could decide when animations and music played instead of the programmers. Development on Policenauts, originally called Beyond, began in 1990,[57] and lasted four years.[58]\nPolicenauts was released in Japan on July 29, 1994, for the PC-9821. In Japan, critics praised Policenauts for its high level of presentation. Both Sega Saturn Magazine and Famitsu praised the quality of animation, voice acting, and its engrossing setting.[59][60] Retrospective reviews have regarded the game generally positively, and sought to contextualise Policenauts within Kojima's body of work, as heavily stylized and influenced by films.[61][62]\nMetal Gear Solid subseries and mainstream success (1994\u20132012)\n[edit]In 1994, Kojima began to plan a 3D sequel to Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, titled Metal Gear Solid and originally planned for release on the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer.[63] After the 3DO was discontinued, development shifted to the Sony PlayStation. For the transition from 2D to 3D graphics, a new engine had to be developed by Kojima and his team.[64] A gameplay demo was first revealed to the public at the 1996 Tokyo Game Show, and was later shown on day 2 of E3 1997 as a short video.[65] The game was released to critical acclaim.[66][67][68] Many outlets noted the game's cinematic qualities and innovative stealth gameplay. Kojima became a celebrity in video game news media, and was surprised when he began to be recognized in public.[64]\nIn early 2001, Kojima released the first details of the sequel to Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, for the PlayStation 2. The game's highly detailed graphics, physics, and expanded gameplay quickly made it one of the most anticipated games at the time.[69][70] The game was highly successful and critically acclaimed at release, due to its graphics, gameplay, and storyline, which dealt with myriad philosophical themes as specific as memes, censorship, manipulation, patricide, the inherent flaws of democracy and as grandiose as the nature of reality itself. While Metal Gear Solid 2 appealed to gamers with the discussion of these, the bewildering maze of dialogue and plot revelation in the final hours of the game was a disappointment for many gamers, who expected the Hollywood-style resolution of its forerunner.[71]\nBefore Metal Gear Solid 2 was released, Kojima produced the game and anime franchise Zone of the Enders in 2001 to moderate success. In 2003, he produced Boktai: The Sun Is in Your Hand for the Game Boy Advance, which players take the role of a young vampire hunter who uses a solar weapon which is charged by a photometric sensor on the game cartridge, forcing them to play in sunlight. Another team inside Konami, in a collaboration with Silicon Knights, began work on Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes, a GameCube enhanced remake of the first Metal Gear Solid with all the gameplay features of Metal Gear Solid 2 and with cutscenes redirected by director Ryuhei Kitamura.\nAfterwards, Kojima designed and released Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater for the PlayStation 2. Unlike the previous games in the series, which took place in the near future and focused on indoor locations, the game is set in a Soviet jungle during the height of the Cold War in 1964, and features wilderness survival, camouflage, and James Bond styled espionage. The North American version was released on November 17, 2004, with the Japanese counterpart following on December 16. The European version was released on March 4, 2005. Critical response to the game was highly favorable. Kojima has said that his mother played it, \"It took her an entire year to complete Metal Gear Solid 3. She would get her friends to help her. When she defeated The End, [a character the player faces off during the game] she called me up and said: 'It is finished'.\"[72]\nAt that time, Kojima produced Boktai's sequel, Boktai 2: Solar Boy Django for the Game Boy Advance. Released in summer 2004, it makes more extensive use of the cartridge's sunlight sensor and allows players to combine various new solar weapons. Also released was Metal Gear Acid for the PlayStation Portable handheld. A turn-based game, it is less action-oriented than the other Metal Gear games and focuses more on strategy. It was released in Japan on December 16, 2004. Its sequel, Metal Gear Acid 2, was released on March 21, 2006.[citation needed]\nKojima wanted Solid Snake to appear in Super Smash Bros. Melee, but Nintendo refused, due to development cycle problems. When Super Smash Bros. Brawl was in development, series director Masahiro Sakurai contacted Kojima to work and add Snake and content related to the Metal Gear series, including a stage based on Shadow Moses Island (the main setting of Solid), into the game.[73]\nReleased in June 2008, Kojima co-directed Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots with Shuyo Murata. Initially, Kojima was not going to direct it, but death threats made the team nervous and he decided to work with them.[74] Kojima received a lifetime achievement award at the MTV Game Awards 2008 in Germany. In his speech, he said in English, \"I have to say, even though I received this award, let me state that I will not retire. I will continue to create games as long as I live\".[75]\nBefore E3 2009, Kojima stated interest in working with a Western developer.[76] This later turned out to be a collaboration between him and Spanish developer MercurySteam to work on Castlevania: Lords of Shadow.[citation needed]\nAlthough he announced that Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots would be the last Metal Gear game he would be directly involved in,[77] he announced at E3 2009 that he would return to help on two Metal Gear games: Metal Gear Solid: Rising, as a producer and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker as writer, director, and producer.[78] When interviewed at Gamescom 2009, Kojima stated that he got more involved with Peace Walker because \"there was a lot of confusion within the team and it didn't proceed as I wanted it to. Therefore I thought that I needed to jump in and do Peace Walker\".[79]\nKojima was at E3 2010 to show off his team's latest project, Metal Gear Solid: Rising. He was also seen in Nintendo's 3DS interview video, where he stated he was interested in making a Metal Gear Solid game for the 3DS and wondered what it would be like in 3D.[80][81] This game ended up being a remake of Metal Gear Solid 3 titled Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater 3D. In late 2011, Metal Gear Solid: Rising was renamed Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance with PlatinumGames being involved in developing it alongside Kojima Productions. Nevertheless, Kojima is the game's executive producer and showed interest in working in the game's demo.[82] Kojima was satisfied with the final product and expressed the possibility of a sequel if Platinum were to develop it.[83]\nOn April 1, 2011, Konami promoted Kojima to Executive Vice President and Corporate Officer.[84][85][86] At E3 2011, he revealed a new gaming technology named \"transfarring\", a portmanteau of the verbs transferring and sharing, which allows gamers to transfer their game data between the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Portable.[87] Transfarring was used in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker and the Metal Gear Solid HD Collection. Later that year, he stated he was working on a new intellectual property with Goichi Suda, tentatively titled Project S, and preparing new projects. On July 8, 2011, Kojima announced that Project S was a radio-show sequel to Snatcher, titled Sdatcher as a reference to the show's producer Suda. The show would air on Fridays on Kojima's bi-weekly Internet radio show, starting with episode No. 300 which was broadcast in August 2011.[88] In October, Kojima announced that he would be collaborating with Suda and 5pb. director Chiyomaru Shikura in producing a new adventure game visual novel.[89] It was initially speculated that the game would be the third entry in 5pb.'s Science Adventure series, but it was later confirmed to be a separate title.[90] The game was planned to have an overseas release and an anime adaption.[91] As of 2023, no further news regarding the project has been released.\nFinal Konami projects and departure (2012\u20132015)\n[edit]Silent Hills\n[edit]In mid-2012 and in the following years after Kojima finished work on the Fox Engine, Kojima has been connected to the Silent Hill series. During this time, he indicated that he was interested in making a Silent Hill game and the first instance of this was on August 18, 2012. He described his excitement regarding the potential use of the Fox Engine on the eighth generation platforms via a tweet of an image of the DVD for the Silent Hill film:[92][93] Later, he added what he had in mind for this game in a series of tweets: \"Silent Hill is in closed room setting and doesn't require full action so that we can focus on the graphic quality. Enemies featured in the game do not have to be consistent or move fast. It only requires scariness by graphics and presentation. As being a creator, making action games in an open world setting, such a type of game is very enviously attractive. If only someone could create this on the Fox Engine.\"[94] After a while, and as a result of Kojima's interest in making a Silent Hill game, Konami asked him to do so. Kojima explained the story in an interview with Eurogamer:\nIn the past I've mentioned Silent Hill in interviews, and as a result of that the president of Konami rung me up and said he'd like me to make the next Silent Hill. Honestly, I'm kind of a scaredy-cat when it comes to horror movies, so I'm not confident I can do it. At the same time, there's a certain type of horror that only people who are scared of can create, so maybe it's something I can do. That said, I think Silent Hill has a certain atmosphere. I think it has to continue, and I'd love to help it continue, and if I can help by supervising or lending the technology of the Fox Engine, then I'd love to participate in that respect.[95][96][97]\nAdditionally, in an interview with Geoff Keighley, when a fan asked \"which game do you want to direct or reboot?\" Kojima stated without hesitation, \"Silent Hill.\"[98][99][100] Keighley jumped in and asked \"What do you want to do with Silent Hill?\" Kojima responded: \"A guy [like myself] that is such a chicken and is so easily scared \u2013 making a scary game \u2013 I'm very confident that something horrifying would come out from that. But on the other hand I would have to prepare myself to have nightmares every single day. Hopefully sometime in the future I'm able to work on this, but I would really need to prepare to have daily nightmares\".[99] In August 2014, PT was released on the PlayStation Store and revealed that a new game in the Silent Hill franchise titled Silent Hills was being directed by Kojima for the PlayStation 4, alongside Mexican film director Guillermo del Toro.[101] In April 2015, the playable teaser was removed and the game was cancelled.[102]\nMetal Gear Solid V\n[edit]At the 2013 Game Developers Conference, Kojima unveiled Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, which was set to be his final Metal Gear game, noting that this time unlike previous announcements that he had stopped working on the series, was very serious about leaving; it was preceded by Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, a shorter game released in 2014 and serving as a prologue to The Phantom Pain.[103] In March 2015, reports began to surface that Kojima would part ways with longtime publisher Konami after the release of The Phantom Pain.[104] Konami later stated that they were auditioning for new staff for future Metal Gear titles and removed Kojima's name from the series' marketing material.[105] Despite reports that Kojima left the company in October 2015, a spokesman for Konami stated that he was \"taking a long time off from work.\"[106] At The Game Awards 2015, Metal Gear Solid V won the awards for Best Action Game and Best Score/Soundtrack, but Kojima did not attend the event, being reportedly barred from attending by Konami.[107] Instead, the award was accepted by Kiefer Sutherland on his behalf.[107] On February 18, 2016, Metal Gear Solid V won the award for Adventure Game of the Year at the 19th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards.[108] On July 10, 2015, Kojima's collaborative voice actor Akio \u014ctsuka revealed that Konami had closed Kojima Productions.[109]\nIndependent studio (2015\u2013present)\n[edit]Death Stranding\n[edit]On December 16, 2015, Kojima announced that Kojima Productions would be re-established as an independent studio, partnered with Sony Computer Entertainment, and that his first game would be exclusive to PlayStation 4.[110] At E3 2016, Kojima personally announced the game's title as Death Stranding in a trailer.[111][112] The trailer featured Norman Reedus, whom Kojima had previously worked with in the canceled Silent Hills.[113] Trailers leading up to release also revealed the castings of actors Mads Mikkelsen, L\u00e9a Seydoux, Margaret Qualley, Troy Baker, Tommie Earl Jenkins and Lindsay Wagner in the title, as well as special appearances from film directors Guillermo del Toro and Nicolas Winding Refn.[114]\nDeath Stranding was released on November 8, 2019. It received generally positive reviews and was a commercial success.[115] It also won a number of awards, including \"Best Game Direction\" and \"Best Score/Music\" at The Game Awards 2019,[116] and \"Outstanding Achievement in Audio Design\" and \"Outstanding Technical Achievement\" at the 23rd Annual D.I.C.E. Awards.[117]\nIn November 2019, talking to BBC Newsbeat as part of a documentary about Death Stranding, Kojima said \"In the future Kojima Productions will start making films. If you can do one thing well, then you can do everything well\". Kojima went on to explain that he sees that movies, TV shows, and games competing in the same space in the future, thanks to streaming technology, and that this will encourage new formats to emerge. \"I'm very interested in the new format of game that will appear on there and that's what I want to take on,\" Kojima added.[118] On December 14, 2023, Kojima and film studio A24 announced that a live-action feature film adaptation of Death Stranding had started production.[119] An anime was also confirmed to be in the works on 28 May 2025.[120]\nAt several game expos in 2022, Kojima cryptically teased the casting of an upcoming game being developed by Kojima Productions, with Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna confirmed to star. It was unknown whether the game would be related to Death Stranding, or a previously announced Xbox collaboration, or an entirely different project.[121][122] However, at The Game Awards 2022, Kojima officially revealed the game as the sequel to Death Stranding, with the working title Death Stranding 2. Its title was eventually confirmed as Death Stranding 2: On the Beach during the 2024 Playstation State of Play.[123][124][125] Reedus, L\u00e9a Seydoux, and Troy Baker were confirmed to be returning from the first game, with Elle Fanning and Shioli Kutsuna revealed to be the new cast members of the game.[126]\nOn March 9, 2025, the castings of Luca Marinelli, Alissa Jung, Alastair Duncan and Debra Wilson for the game were announced, as well as special appearances from film directors Fatih Akin and George Miller. A collaboration with French singer-songwriter Woodkid for a soundtrack album for the game was also revealed.[127]\nKojima began writing Death Stranding 2 some time prior to 2020, but reworked his narrative from scratch to reflect the effect of COVID-19 on the worldwide population and himself.[128] Moreover, approximately half-way through the game's development, Kojima rewrote the script again in order to make it more polarising after it performed very well with test audiences.[129] Kojima explained to the game's co-composer Woodkid:\nWe have a problem. I\u2019m going to be very honest, we have been testing the game with players and the results are too good. They like it too much. That means something is wrong; we have to change something. If everyone likes it, it means it\u2019s mainstream. It means it\u2019s conventional. It means it\u2019s already pre-digested for people to like it. And I don\u2019t want that. I want people to end up liking things they didn\u2019t like when they first encountered it, because that\u2019s where you really end up loving something.[130]\nDeath Stranding 2: On the Beach was released on June 26, 2025. It was met with widespread critical acclaim, with particular praise directed towards its visual fidelity, acting performances, improved combat and gameplay, soundtrack and narrative.[131][132] Some critics commended it as Kojima's best work.[133]\nOther projects\n[edit]Kojima launched his own YouTube channel in 2016, where he and film critic Kenji Yano discuss their favorite films and matters pertaining to Kojima's studio.[134] Starting in 2017, Kojima became a regular contributor to Rolling Stone, often discussing recent film releases, and occasionally drawing comparisons to his own works.[135] In 2022, Kojima began a podcast for Spotify called Hideo Kojima presents Brain Structure. The podcast, hosted by Kojima with regular appearances from Geoff Keighley, focuses on Kojima's history with game development, as well as his interests in books, music, and cinema.[136]\nIn June 2022, Kojima and Microsoft revealed that Kojima Productions would be working on a game with Xbox Game Studios that will use Microsoft's cloud-based tech.[137] At The Game Awards 2023, Kojima and Jordan Peele announced that new game, revealed as OD, published by Xbox Game Studios. The game stars Sophia Lillis, Hunter Schafer, and Udo Kier.[138]\nOn January 31, 2024, during the PlayStation State of Play event, Kojima announced that he is working on a new action-espionage genre game after Death Stranding 2.[139]\nInfluences and mentality\n[edit]Kojima has cited Yuji Horii's The Portopia Serial Murder Case (1983)[140] and Shigeru Miyamoto's Super Mario Bros. (1985)[141] as the games that inspired him to enter the video game industry. Portopia Serial Murder Case, a murder mystery adventure game, was an important influence because, according to Kojima, it had \"mystery, a 3D dungeon, humor, and a proper background and explanation of why the murderer committed the crime. That is why there was drama in this game. Me encountering this game expanded the potential of video games in my mind.\"[140] He also stated that it \"taught me that one can tell a story and develop plots around a scenario in the game genre\".[142] Portopia had an influence on his early works, including Metal Gear and particularly Snatcher.[143]\nKojima's love of film is noticeable in his games where he pays homage through his stories and characters, sometimes to the point of pastiche, as in Snatcher. He cited a contrast between films and games as while in his games he intends to portray violence like in a movie, in the game it is up to the player to decide. He wants people to understand the effects of violence. As he considers the games too stressful, he also wants comic relief to contrast it.[144]\nSnatcher is inspired by many science fiction films, particularly from the 1980s, including Blade Runner,[145] Akira,[146] The Thing, Invasion of the Body Snatchers,[147] and The Terminator.[146] Examples of influence by films include Solid Snake's codename (named after Snake Plissken from Escape from New York),[148] Snake's alias in MGS2: Pliskin (in reference to the last name of Snake Plissken from the Escape movies), Snake's real name (Dave from 2001: A Space Odyssey),[149] and Snake's trademark bandana (The Deer Hunter[150]).\nFilm would also have an influence on other aspects of his games. Hal \"Otacon\" Emmerich (named after HAL 9000 from 2001: A Space Odyssey and film director Roland Emmerich),[149] Sniper Wolf shooting Meryl in Metal Gear Solid (Full Metal Jacket),[148] Psycho Mantis (inspired from the film The Fury),[148] and the whole Metal Gear stealth concept (The Great Escape[148] and The Guns of Navarone[151]). James Bond also had a large influence on the Metal Gear series,[152] with Metal Gear Solid 3 having a James Bond-like introduction sequence. Kojima has written that Metal Gear was \"strongly influenced\" by the \"anti-war and anti-nuke\" themes of the Planet of the Apes film franchise.[153]\nIn an article he wrote for Official PlayStation 2 Magazine, Kojima described the influence of the film Dawn of the Dead on the Metal Gear series. The zombie classic inspired \"the maximum three-dimensional use of a closed area like a shopping mall with elevators, air ducts, and escalators\". These aspects are similar enough in his view that \"Metal Gear Solid is Dawn of the Dead if you replace soldiers with zombies [sic].\"[154]\nHe also received inspiration from anime. His early works, particularly the cyberpunk adventure game Snatcher (which uses anime-style art), were influenced by cyberpunk anime, most notably Akira (mentioned above).[146] In an interview, he mentioned that his Zone of the Enders series was inspired by mecha/robot anime, such as Neon Genesis Evangelion. Mecha anime was also an inspiration for the Metal Gear series, which features mecha robots, such as Metal Gear REX and Metal Gear RAY; this is referred to in Metal Gear Solid, where Otacon mentions mecha anime as an influence on his Metal Gear REX designs.[citation needed]\nIn regards to storyline development and interaction with them, he said:\nStorytelling is very difficult. But adding the flavor helps to relay the storytelling, meaning in a cut scene, with a set camera and effects, you can make the users feel sorrow, or make them happy or laugh. This is an easy approach, which we have been doing. That is one point, the second point is that if I make multiple storylines and allow the users to select which story, this might really sacrifice the deep emotion the user might feel; when there's a concrete storyline, and you kind of go along that rail, you feel the destiny of the story, which at the end, makes you feel more moved. But when you make it interactive \u2013 if you want multiple stories where you go one way or another \u2013 will that make the player more moved when he or she finishes the game? These two points are really the key which I am thinking about, and if this works, I think I could probably introduce a more interactive storytelling method.[155]\nKojima listed Another World on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, Operation Wolf's arcade version, The Portopia Serial Murder Case on the Famicom, Super Mario Bros., and Xevious's arcade version as his favorite games in 2000. He stated that A Link to the Past was his favorite game by Miyamoto.[142]\nIn 2019, Kojima published a collection of essays in Japan discussing the influence of pop culture on his work under the title The Gifted Gene and My Lovable Memes. The book was published in English by Viz Media in October 2021 under the title The Creative Gene: How Books, Movies, and Music Inspired the Creator of Death Stranding and Metal Gear Solid.[156]\nIn terms of reverse influence on film, his work on the storylines of the Metal Gear series was cited as an influence by screenwriter David Hayter, the voice actor for Solid Snake, on his screenwriting for Hollywood films. He stated that \"Kojima and I have different styles (...) but I've certainly learned things from him, especially about ambiguity and telling a story without giving all the answers\".[157]\nKojima has also influenced a number of actors and auteurs in the film industry. Hollywood actors Mads Mikkelsen and L\u00e9a Seydoux have voice roles in Death Stranding, while director Guillermo del Toro is amongst his biggest fans.[158]\nIn 2020, Kojima was a member of the international Jury of the 77th Venice International Film Festival, Virtual Reality section.[159]\nLegacy\n[edit]Kojima has been noted for his influence on the video game industry. Metal Gear was the first mainstream stealth game,[160] a genre that was later popularized by Metal Gear Solid.[161] Kojima was also a pioneer in the integration of cinematic techniques in video games,[162][163] especially Metal Gear Solid which Eurogamer considers the \"first modern video game\".[162]\nKojima's work has been cited as an influence by numerous game developers, including Splinter Cell and Far Cry 2 designer Clint Hocking,[164] Splinter Cell producer Mathieu Ferland,[165] Silicon Knights founder Denis Dyack,[165] Unreal and Gears of War creator Cliff Bleszinski,[166][167] Tenchu creator Takuma Endo,[168] Thief creator Tom Leonard,[169] Sumo Digital designer Emily Knox,[170] Crysis 2 animator Luke Kelly,[171][172] Uncharted writer and The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann,[173] and 2064: Read Only Memories developer MidBoss.[174] Kojima's work has also been cited as an influence on creators outside of the video game industry, including novelist Project Itoh[175] and filmmaker Jordan Peele.[176]\nThemes\n[edit]Kojima has been noted for predicting and exploring themes in his works years before they gained mainstream notoriety on numerous occasions, ranging from the sociological to the scientific.[177]\nMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty was released on November 13, 2001. While the game received universal acclaim upon release for its gameplay and attention to detail, the plot was a divisive topic among critics, with some calling it \"absurd\" and \"stupid\".[178] Reinterpretations of the game's plot began to surface in the 2010s, with some calling it \"misunderstood\" in its time, eerily prescient, and \"necessary for the political climate to come\" for predicting some of the cultural issues of the 2010s with striking accuracy and similar concepts.[179][180] GamesRadar+ has cited the prescience of the game in relation to the Facebook\u2013Cambridge Analytica data scandal and the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.[181] The concept of \"Selection for Societal Sanity\" presented in the game was one of the bases for the paper Filtration Failure: On Selection for Societal Sanity written by Adrian Mr\u00f3z and published in the academic journal Kultura i Historia.[182]\nIn Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, released on September 1, 2015, the Wolbachia bacteria is used to halt the reproduction of the fictional \"vocal cord parasites\". At the time, large-scale uses of Wolbachia to control insect-transmitted diseases like malaria and dengue only existed in simulated computational models and field-test releases in Australia.[183][184] Deployment of Wolbachia was proposed the next year at the peak of the Zika epidemic in the Americas.[183] Large-scale deployments of the Wolbachia bacteria became the most effective way to control and eradicate mosquito-related epidemics as of 2019, with successful deployments in Malaysia,[185] Singapore,[186] Sri Lanka,[187] Indonesia, Vietnam, and Brazil.[188]\nKojima's Death Stranding, released on November 8, 2019, presents a post-apocalyptic setting in which people live isolated in cities and prepper shelters, unable to go outside because of the hazardous conditions brought on by an event named the \"Death Stranding\". The inhabitants of the world rely on \"porters\", people who risk their lives making deliveries, to receive and exchange the resources they need to survive. Similarities with the COVID-19 pandemic were noted by numerous journalists in early 2020, including the game's focus on the themes of isolation, loneliness, and political divide.[189][190]\nPersonal life\n[edit]Kojima is private about his personal life. He is married and has two sons.[191][192][193] He is able to speak and write in English, but is not fluent and almost always uses an interpreter when communicating with English speakers to ensure clarity.[194]\nAwards and accolades\n[edit]Newsweek named Kojima as one of the top ten people of 2002.[195][196] In 2008, Next-Gen placed him seventh in their list of \"Hot 100 Developers 2008\".[197]\nIn 2009, IGN placed him sixth in their list of top game creators of all time.[198] At the 2008 MTV Game Awards, Kojima was given the award show's first Lifetime Achievement Award for a game designer and was also honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2009 Game Developers Conference.[199][200] In 2014, UNESCO's Bradford City of Film gave Kojima the inaugural award for Cinematography in Videogames, \"for his astounding directing, storytelling, and cinematography\" in video games.[201]\nAt the 2014 National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers (NAVGTR) awards, Kojima was credited for Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes' nomination for the category Game, Franchise Adventure.[202] In December 2015, Kojima was invited to accept an award from The Game Awards 2015 for Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain, but was prevented from attending by Konami.[203]\nIn February 2016, Kojima received the AIAS Hall of Fame Award at the 19th Annual D.I.C.E. Awards.[204] In December 2016, Kojima was able to attend The Game Awards 2016 and accepted the Industry Icon Award.[205]\nOn October 12, 2017, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Brasil Game Show.[206]\nKojima was named a BAFTA Fellowship at the 2020 British Academy Games Awards, making him the second Japanese person to receive the award for work on video games after Shigeru Miyamoto.[207]\nKojima holds the distinction of having directed four games (Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain and Death Stranding) out of the 30 total to have achieved a maximum possible score of 40 from the Japanese video games magazine Famitsu.[208] Kojima has also been directly involved with three games (Metal Gear Solid,[209] Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots,[210] and Death Stranding[211]) that were nominated for Game of the Year by the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences at the D.I.C.E. Awards.\nOn January 20, 2022, Kojima received an Industry Legend Award from the Arab Game Awards.[212]\nOn March 15, 2022, Kojima announced on Twitter that he had received the 72nd Minister of Education Award for Fine Arts from the Japanese Agency of Cultural Affairs.[213]\nWorks\n[edit]Games\n[edit]| Year | Game | Credited as |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1986 | Penguin Adventure | Assistant director |\n| 1987 | Metal Gear | Director, game designer, writer |\n| 1988 | Snatcher | |\n| 1990 | Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake | |\n| SD Snatcher | Writer | |\n| 1994 | Policenauts | Director, game designer, writer |\n| 1997 | Tokimeki Memorial Drama Series Vol. 1 | Producer |\n| 1998 | Tokimeki Memorial Drama Series Vol. 2 | |\n| Metal Gear Solid | Director, producer, game designer, writer | |\n| 1998\u20132002 | Beatmania console ports | Producer |\n| 1999 | Tokimeki Memorial Drama Series Vol. 3 | Supervisor |\n| 2000\u20132002 | Beatmania IIDX console ports | Producer |\n| 2000 | Metal Gear: Ghost Babel | |\n| 2001 | Zone of the Enders | |\n| Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty | Director, producer, game designer, writer | |\n| 2003 | Boktai: The Sun is in Your Hand | Producer, game designer |\n| Zone of the Enders: The 2nd Runner | Producer | |\n| 2004 | Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes | |\n| Boktai 2: Solar Boy Django | ||\n| Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater | Director, producer, game designer, writer | |\n| Metal Gear Acid | Executive producer | |\n| 2005 | Shin Bokura no Taiy\u014d: Gyakush\u016b no Sabata | Producer |\n| Metal Gear Acid 2 | ||\n| 2006 | Lunar Knights | |\n| Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops | ||\n| Kabushiki Baibai Trainer: Kabutore!

      "text": "One of the most iconic gaming performances still has to be that of David Hayter\u2019s portrayal of Snake in the Metal Gear Solid games. I was lucky enough to catch up with him recently and he was happy to talk about his career not only in voice acting but also as a major Hollywood screenwriter.\nOne of the first things he wanted to talk about was the fact I was in Japan. He clearly loves the country and has a lot of affection for it still. While I knew he\u2019d spent some time here, he was more than happy to talk about that in more detail.\n\u201cI lived in Kobe and Osaka for about 4 years. In terms of Japanese, I can get by conversationally in about any sushi bar and make my way around Tokyo without too much trouble.\u201d\n\u201cWhen I went to Japan I was 16 and did the 11th and 12th grade there. I graduated high school at the Canadian Academy in Kobe. My girlfriend and I then moved to Osaka, we lived there for a couple of years. Then we moved to Hong Kong and lived there for a little while. Traveled the world, drank and got in bar fights. It was awesome.\u201d\nSnake And Metal Gear\nFor many gamers, Hayter is very well known for his depiction of Snake in the Metal Gear Solid games. It\u2019s always been clear to me that Hayter plays games but I was curious from his standpoint what did he think was the best game in the Metal Gear Solid series.\n\u201cWell, I have different favorites for different reasons. I usually say that Snake Eater is my favorite game, I just love the retro feel of it, I love the way it opened up Snake's story into Big Boss' story and seeing where it all began. I also thought the gameplay was beautifully designed and really quite an achievement. However, at the same time, I feel the same way about the first Metal Gear Solid, the Shadow Moses incident. Obviously, it had a big impact on my life and was an incredibly groundbreaking game when it came out. I guess those are two of my favorites. Though I also loved getting to play old Snake in Metal Gear Solid 4, so maybe I love them all.\u201d\n\u201cAs for which game I preferred in terms of my performance, probably Metal Gear Solid 4. You know I think it got clearer to me what I was doing. When I started out he didn't have a face, he was all pixelated and the story was so over the top that the voice I came up with was a little over the top as well - to match the craziness of the world and the game. Then the games got photo-realistic and he had to get increasingly real as the technology progressed. I feel by Peace Walker and Metal Gear Solid 4 I sort of felt that I met the middle ground of where he is still iconic and he is still a larger than life character but it was a little more real than it was in the earlier games.\u201d\nAs Hayter has become synonymous with playing Snake, I asked what other characters he would have liked to play, \u201cI think Ocelot would have been a lot of fun to play. You know, some of the big villains, Vulcan Raven. There were some very cool villains; I think Cam Clarke had a great deal of fun with Liquid Snake. \"Hello Brathaaaa, do you like my sunglasses?\" Things like that, but you know I am an actor so I love playing anything as long as it is fun and I feel I have got a grip on it. The fact that I got to play Snake sort of defined my relationship with the series, so that's where my heart lies.\u201d\nMore recently, the world of Metal Gear Solid descended on Ford and a few spots were made in the style of the first PSone game. In a wonderful move by Ford, Hayter and other members of the cast were called back to reprise their roles. I was naturally curious as to how this had come about.\n\u201cWith the Ford spots, they called me to do these two internet only tele-novella commercials. It\u2019s a tele-novella with latino actors and we're doing bad voice dubs in English. It was me and it was Tara Strong and another actor, the executives told me that this was basically their excuse to meet their heroes and so they dragged me in because they wanted talk to me for something, or get me to do their voicemail as Snake. So we did that and I tweeted about it and each commercial got around 1.5 million views. So they then came back to me, though I don't think anyone realizes this, and asked me to do one for Captain Planet, which was my first voice over job and I got to play one of the planeteers for one of these Ford things. Then they finally said, would you be willing to do two of these as Snake. In an actual Metal Gear Solid type commercial. I was like, yeah, I'd do it but you have to get Konami's permission. You know, all these fan games come up and everybody wants to do something and Konami never says yes, so I didn't figure it would go anywhere. However, when Ford calls you up and says we want to license your game then they go \"yeah, okay\". So they called me back in and there I was, I had this script and Paul Eiding, who plays the Colonel, came in and we recorded this thing and it was great fun. Though I am getting some hassle and kickback from people who say that \"Oh you sold out Snake!\" or whatever. I thought it was really fun, I thought it was well written and it really was true to the games. So to those people I just want to say that, you know selling out has always been my dearest career goal. You know, live with it.\u201d\nWhile fans may regard the Ford commercials with some degree of snobbery, something I don\u2019t personally understand at all, Hayter is still very much about helping fans of Metal Gear. Something that has manifested itself with the various fan projects he\u2019s supported recently.\n\u201cWith the new Shadow Moses fan project, I don't know where these guys came from but they were redesigning the island in Unreal Engine 4 and doing this amazing work. They wanted to do a full remake of the first Metal Gear Solid game. They asked me if I would be involved and I said that I think that if I am involved then the Eye of Sauron, you know Konami, will start to look at it. Then they will kill you. So I didn't think that was a great idea. Well, Konami killed them anyway but they had all this work done. So then, they came up with the idea of just doing a non-profit fan driven museum type tour of an actual Shadow Moses island. From that they said that nobody is making any money and would I be willing to do the voice of the host or narrator, as Snake walking people through it. So I said sure and that's how that came about.\u201d\nTrying to understand more about his voice over work, Hayter was happy to clarify in detail how it differs between voicing anime and games.\n\u201cIn terms of anime, that's how I started my career in California. It's really fun but the difference compared to videogame work is you have to match the lips, as they're already animated. So you have to match your English dialogue to the Japanese dialogue that's coming through the mouth of the character. As you know, the Japanese when they speak have so many more syllables than in English. That means there's a lot of explanation in English whereas in Japanese that can easily amount to a few words. So that's a very different process. Like when I did Metal Gear for example, you do the dialogue but it is fed into a computer, so when I did Metal Gear Solid 2 they had me doing all sorts of different syllabic sounds so that they could just program the mouth to match whatever sounds I was making in the dialogue. So it got to be a lot easier when Snake speaks English, his mouth moves with my mouth. However, each recording of Metal Gear was different. On the first one we had cutscenes to record to, on the second one we had nothing. We just had timing to match. On the third one they would show us the length of the line in terms of original audio, so we could match that. Then on the fourth game, I was watching video of the Japanese actors in the motion capture suits, going through the motions. Each time then was more hilarious than the last.\u201d\nThe big set of questions I wanted to ask was what happened on Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain. While Hayter had already spoken about this in another interview at Game Informer, I wanted to follow up on some of that.\nThe most obvious starting point since Snake\u2019s Japanese voice actor didn\u2019t change for the new game, whereas his role was recast, and what he thought of that.\n\u201cAs for the fact Akio Ohtsuka remained as Snake in the Japanese version of Metal Gear Solid V, oh I am aware! As for why it happened, I have some ideas. I think it was internal politics, or Kojima just got tired of me. I also got a lot more expensive because every time a Metal Gear game would come up I was working on two or three different screenplays at the same time and the scheduling was killing me. So if we're going to do this then you're going to have to pay me. I don't know, maybe he got tired of that or he's a movie lover, maybe he wanted a bigger star or something? It's all just conjecture though, he never spoke to me about it.\u201d\nAt this point I interjected that Kiefer Sutherland would have hardly been cheap.\n\u201cIndeed and it also took my 9 months to record Metal Gear Solid 4 and I doubt you're going to get Kiefer in the booth for 9 straight months of recording. It's pretty extreme the amount of time you have to put in.\u201d\n\u201cIn general, I wasn't impressed with the way the situation was handled. I feel like when somebody is a valuable employee and they've supported the title and done a bunch of publicity. You know once you've gone down a road with another artist and it's been very successful, there is usually some measure of respect there between the two parties. I didn't feel that was in place. I didn't feel that I was handled in a particularly professional manner.\u201d\nThe thing that\u2019s different about Hayter compared to other voice actors is that he is also an accomplished Hollywood screenwriter. As Hideo Kojima is widely known to be a fan of movies, I asked whether Kojima was envious of Hayter\u2019s actual Hollywood experience. His response was thought provoking to say the least.\n\u201cCalls for speculation.\u201d\nFollowing on from this writing theme, I was curious if he would have liked to change the narrative of any of the Metal Gear games he worked on.\n\u201cNo, I wouldn't change anything in terms of the story. I think the games were very successful and part of that is because of the complex nature of Kojima's storytelling. The reality that he brings, the military aspect, his research is amazing. If I had been asked to write the games, I would have written them very differently just because he and I are very different writers but Metal Gear is what it is because of what he brought to it. So no, I wouldn't change anything.\n\u201cHowever, at the end of Metal Gear Solid 4 I really argued against the final scene with Snake. In the booth, when we were doing it, as a writer this would not have been a choice I would have made. It seemed problematic for me to have a character who had been killing hundreds of soldiers and when it is time to kill himself for the good of the world, it just seemed weak to me for him to put his gun in his mouth and then it goes to black he pulls the trigger and then somehow he's missed? It didn't make a lot of sense to me. I felt like it weakened the character but I was always recording the games after the Japanese versions had pretty much been done. So there wasn't much I could say to alter the process.\u201d\nIt was clear at this point that he wanted to clarify his stance on the Metal Gear series and he was quite frank about the current situation.\n\u201cOn the Metal Gear stuff, I just wanted to have my say about it. That I wasn't very impressed with the way things were handled. However, I don't want to keep on harping about it. I get all these people telling me to let it go, and I already have. I am fine, I am working all the time. However, people keep on asking me about it.\u201d\n\u201cKonami has still yet to contact me about any new Metal Gear games. I haven't spoken to Konami at all really. I just do my own thing and I think the fact that the Ford commercials are playing so big, maybe they will some idea that there's still a worthwhile relationship there. However, I don't know what their internal politics are in terms of Kojima, Metal Gear or any of it. I have not spoken with anyone about doing any more voice work for the Metal Gear games.\u201d\n\u201cThe thing is that people don't really get on Metal Gear is that, I never worked with Kojima. Not ever. Admittedly, I met him but that was maybe only two or three times. He visited the recording twice over fifteen years and I then I ran into him at an awards show once. He didn't put a lot into the English recording for the games. It just wasn't a big part of his focus. So it's not that I dislike the man, I don't even know the guy.\u201d\n\u201cThat's my only point really, I loved doing the job as Snake and I love the character. If I can keep doing that with Konami that's great. If not, I had a great run and I am very happy with that as well. To go back and do it for the Ford commercials was really fun. I also didn't make much money from it either, so if it is selling out it was a poor decision.\u201d\nVoicing Anime And Getting Covered In Goo\nBeing the massive nerd I am, I also knew of Hayter way before his appearance in the first Metal Gear Solid. This is because he popped up in various anime I used to watch and in a live action adaptation of Guyver, a manga and anime I adore.\nThe big mystery I wanted resolving was why he replaced Bryan Cranston in the final episode of Macross Plus and in part, he did his best to answer that though he didn\u2019t remember working on the series.\n\u201cOn Macross Plus, I don't remember doing it but in 1993 I starred in a movie called Guyver: Dark Hero. This was a live-action adaptation of a Japanese manga and anime. The guy who produced the music for that, worked at this studio where they were doing anime dubs. So he asked me whether I would come in and voice some anime. I didn't have any money, so I was like \"yeah! fantastic!\" and Bryan Cranston was one of the other actors there. We were both sort of became the go to guys for anime, as we were pretty good actors though him a lot more so than I. While I don't remember doing Macross Plus, at the time I was being called in a lot by Kevin Seymour, who directed almost all the voiceover dubs of practically every anime you have ever seen. So he'd call me in and give me a part. However, what happened with Bryan was eventually he got Malcolm in the Middle and then he left. His career took off. I was still doing anime until 1999 when I started writing for the first X-Men movie. So that's when I got my big break and I left after that. It was one of those gigs where actors would come in and make $50 an hour to do voices for anime. It was great but then for some people success came along and they would move on. It may have been that Bryan was no longer doing anime, plus those were all non-union things. So if you became a well-known union actor, legally you just couldn't go back and keep working on stuff like that.\u201d\n\u201cI had this crazy manager back in the day, I was just starting my career and he got me an audition for Guyver: Dark Hero. I was told it was a sci-fi movie and that I was auditioning for the lead. So I went to this weird warehouse and pseudo-sound stage in Van Nuys and I read for the part and they gave it to me. I then instantly quit my day job, unwisely, because I figured I was now this big movie star. I then went back to that same Van Nuys warehouse and they had built the big cave set inside it and we started working, it was awesome. It was like being Batman, it was very cool.\u201d\n\u201cI remember it was freezing working on Guyver: Dark Hero and we were in Van Nuys in the middle of the spring and the door was open, it was the middle of the night and they were covering me in what is called methisil. This is a food additive, it's what makes lemon meringue pies meringuey, but it is also the stuff that they used in Alien when the goo dripped from the alien's mouth. So it's this goo and it's horrible. Anyway, they were painting me in this stuff and they covering me in the Guyver armor pieces and then they would pull them off all at once. However, I had to basically stand there in my underwear for three hours just freezing to death to do that scene. I had to scream and I was freezing and Steve Wang, the director, said something to me that I will never forget. He was like \"David, pain is temporary, film is forever.\" So someday when I am torturing an actor on set I am going to use that.\u201d\n\u201cI don't think I've read the Guyver manga but I have seen the anime. I own the anime series. So I think that was my research, also four years living in Japan was pretty good background as well.\u201d\nWho Watches The Watchmen\nAgain, another aspect to Hayter that people strangely seem to overlook is the fact he is a very accomplished screenwriter. Back in 1999 my mind was suitably blown when I saw his name in the credits of X-Men and did a big grin when I also saw his cameo in the movie. So it didn\u2019t surprise me when news surfaced that he was directing as well as writing the screenplay for the movie adaptation of Alan Moore\u2019s very highly regarded Watchmen.\nHowever, while he is co-credited on the final movie he wasn\u2019t able to direct it. As someone that also loves the original graphical novel, I wanted to know what he thought of the final movie.\n\u201cI enjoyed the theatrical release of Watchmen immensely. I spent 9 years trying to get that movie made and so to see it made and it to see a true Watchmen adaptation, I was very grateful and blown away that it actually occurred. So that was great. I saw it at the big premiere at the Mann's Chinese Theater and it was a great night. I was very honored to be a part of it. But I feel that movie was so huge that, if anyone has seen the Ultimate Cut that includes the Tales from the Black Freighter animated portions, I think that is really phenomenal. So I think to a certain extent that movie needed about 2 years to edit, which you don't really get almost ever. So my favorite cut is the Ultimate Cut, that's where it really is the true vision of what we all put into it. I still enjoyed the theatrical release of the movie, I thought it was good.\u201d\n\u201cAs for the changed ending from the graphic novel version, I signed my contract to work on Watchmen on September 10th 2001. So the day after I signed my contract with Universal was 9/11 and it felt like the ending of this movie had actually happened in real life. From that moment on, as much as I love the ending in the graphic novel and those images of the big squid legs and the dead bodies in the streets, I felt that it was too painful. I just didn't feel like having multitudes of dead bodies in Times Square. I didn't think that was the right thing to do in that time period. So I started to thinking about how those people could be vaporized, or there's a running theme in the book of Hiroshima's shadows. Graffiti of people spray painted up against the walls, I thought that maybe that was what would happen to them. So that's it's not quite so bloody and so viscerally in your face, similar to 9/11. It started then to occur that maybe Dr. Manhattan's energy was a viable replacement for the giant squid.\u201d\n\u201cAlex Tse came onboard, the gentleman I am co-credited with on the screenplay, during Zack's production. I went up and visited but I wasn't really working on the film at that point. So Alex primarily worked with Zack to put it back in the 80s, whereas I had set it present day. They then made various changes throughout and Alex did the on-set work. We were all adapting the graphic novel, we were all hardcore fans and we all had a baseline we wanted to keep to.\u201d\n\u201cThe ending was in place years before the Zack Snyder version started shooting.\u201d\nWhile I didn\u2019t like the changes to the ending in the movie, I can now at last understand the very sensible reasoning behind them.\nWhat was remarkable about the Watchmen adaptation though was that Alan Moore personally praised Hayter\u2019s script, something he has never done to date on any other movie adaptation of his work.\nAnyway, the fact Alan Moore praised his work is something he still remembers fondly.\n\u201cThat was very very sweet of him. He was always nice to me, I spoke to him on the phone during the process. I was very deferential and just so inspired by the man, he knew that. He was always very supportive of me as a writer and was able to separate his perfectly legitimate feelings about Hollywood from his feelings about another writer who has been tasked with adapting his master work. So I was very very grateful to Alan for that.\u201d\n\u201cIn terms of adapting any more of Alan Moore's works, well I would have loved to have done From Hell or V for Vendetta. They've done some good ones already. His Swamp Thing run is incredible and that might be cool to take on. I don't know though, I feel bad picking on the bones of Alan Moore because he doesn't care for Hollywood. I've talked many times about wanting to do Sandman, Neil Gaiman's master work, and hopefully they'll do a good job of that some day. It's tough to adapt Alan Moore's work, because it's so brilliant and you really want to stay true to it but at the same time you know he just doesn't want it done. However, Watchmen was so important I felt to the world, I mean I felt like those ideas and those concepts just deserved a much bigger audience. In that sense, I managed to get over my fears that he would be upset.\u201d\nConsidering that Hollywood has now gone down the superhero route, Hayter\u2019s script on the original X-Men xscript in many ways laid the foundation for that. However, the genre has changed in the years since and not entirely for the better.\n\u201cSince I worked on the original X-Men in 1999, superhero movies have gotten a lot bigger that's for sure. I think the primary way they have evolved, which I really love, is that they are made true to the source material now. Whereas prior to X-Men there was a feeling that if you were going to adapt a comic book character you had to take it out of the realm of comic books. You couldn't get too into the fan minutiae, all of that detail was too confusing for the executives to embrace. There was a real fear that it would never work. Now though, you go into an Avengers movie and there's so much detail that the fans understand and that some guy can explain to his girlfriend who the Scarlet Witch is and what her powers are. It's very cool because it not only makes the movies a lot like the comic, you know the things that made us love this stuff in the first place, but it also gives non-comic book fans the feeling that the world is so much bigger, the universe is so much bigger than what they are grasping. I think that gives it a real reality. In the same way that you look at Star Wars and even from the first you felt that this was an immense galaxy you were stepping into. There's so much I am not seeing here. So I think these modern comic book movies have a lot of that and that's very cool. As a comic book fan to see that come together and have had whatever role in that is very gratifying.\u201d\n\u201cI read an interesting article saying that we were in the era of the plot-free-movie. That you are just going from set piece to set piece. From experience to experience. Sort of in the way that the Japanese tell their stories really, in the way their anime do. I can't say that I am a huge fan of that. The first X-Men was directed by Bryan Singer, who I believe has still never read an X-Men comic, I was the comic book fan, as was Tom DeSanto and Kevin Feige. We were the three fans of the comics there to make it all feel like X-Men. However, Bryan was just making a movie. He just wanted it to be clear and to have impact. So if you look at it the movie is really very simple; Rogue is having problems and Wolverine is having problems, they both end up at the mansion, they bond and then she's taken resulting in her need to be rescued. That's essentially the story. The rest of it is just setting up the world. Identifying why it is people have powers, why they have different powers from each other, why they have codenames instead of regular names. All the stuff that's weird about X-Men, Bryan just so brilliantly directed me and everybody else involved on the project into weaving all that information in, so that it feels like story but is really just set up for a world.\u201d\n\u201cHowever, I think it is taken for granted now that people know they are stepping into a comic book world. So that there might be weird planets, there might be weird powers, there might be this and that and you're right there is less of a need to justify these things or to clarify these things. You either keep up with the Avengers or you don't. It barrels along like a freight train, without you if you're not careful. So I can see that but at the same time you can't keep doing the same thing we did in X-Men again and again.\u201d\nOn Direction And Voicing King Shark\nOne thing that was obvious when I talked with Hayter was just how busy and in demand he still is. That he is now branching out more into directing and not just screenwriting and voice acting.\n\u201cIn terms of my writing and directing work, ideally I want to keep on doing it. I love directing and had so much fun doing my debut feature film Wolves. To be perfectly mercenary about it, but this is Forbes, I don't get paid as much I do to write a big movie as I do to direct a little movie. So I sort of have to balance out my financial needs with my creative desires. However, I have another film, a fairly modestly budgeted horror thriller that I am attached to direct. I am trying to set that up now. I also have other bigger films that I am attached to produce, as well as working on setting up TV shows. If I set up a show that I am the executive producer of, I may come in and direct a few episodes. I mean my goal at this point is just to do what I enjoy and I am incredibly lucky to be able to work in all these different aspects of the business and still be able to pay my bills. Really I am just trying to appreciate the opportunities I have and be where I am and do what I think is fun for me as well as the audience.\u201d\n\u201cI am also the voice of King Shark on the Flash TV show, which is so fun and just an awesome kick-ass character to play. My daughter, who just turned 12, was already a fan of the show so I finally got to impress her with something I did. As most of the time she is like \"whatever X-Men, whatever Snake? I don't what that is?\". So that's been a pretty awesome fun part to play.\u201d\nAfter that we rounded off the conversation and he re-iterated his love of Japan and told me to make the most of it. It\u2019s not every day that Solid Snake gives you advice and in this instance, I am more than happy to abide by it.\nConsidering all that Hayter has been through in his career it was nice to see he is still genuinely upbeat about what he\u2019s done and now doing. His set of skills are definitely unique and I can only hope they continue to utilized to their full extent, as it would be an obvious waste otherwise.\nAt the very least Konami need to call the real Snake back, as Jack Bauer doesn\u2019t really cut it.\nFollow me on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. I also manage Mecha Damashii and do toy reviews over at hobbylink.tv.\nRead my Forbes blog here."
