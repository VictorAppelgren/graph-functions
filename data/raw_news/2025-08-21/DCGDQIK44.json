The Saginaw News/MLive.com The Saginaw News/MLive.com\n\nSAGINAW, MI \u2014 Saginaw officials are inviting residents to weigh in on the future of the city\u2019s century-old water treatment plant at an upcoming public meeting.\n\nThe informational session will be held Friday, Aug. 22, at 10:30 a.m. at the Andersen Enrichment Center, located at 120 Ezra Rust Drive, organizers said.\n\nRepresentatives from the city\u2019s Water Treatment Services Division and Fishbeck Engineering will discuss options for the facility at 552 Ezra Rust Drive.\n\nThe city has partnered with Fishbeck Engineering on a comprehensive study to determine the plant\u2019s long-term future. According to city officials, much of the equipment and piping in the nearly 100-year-old facility has reached the end of its useful life.\n\nThe study will recommend either replacing equipment and conducting large-scale rehabilitation of the current facility or constructing a new plant elsewhere. If officials opt for a new facility, the historic structure could be repurposed to benefit the community.\n\nMichael Grenier, director of the city\u2019s Water and Wastewater Treatment Services, emphasized the importance of public participation in the decision-making process:\n\n\u201cOur Water Treatment Division provides quality drinking water to thousands of City of Saginaw residents, and to 20 communities throughout Saginaw County and portions of Bay and Tuscola counties,\u201d Grenier said in a statement. \u201cHowever, with the age of our infrastructure, investment in our facility is essential to continue these services.\u201d\n\nAdditional public meetings are planned for this fall to provide updates on the study and gather more community feedback. All meetings will be recorded and available on the city\u2019s website, where residents can also submit comments online.\n\n\u201cWe want our citizens to be informed and involved as we develop the future plans for our Water Treatment Division and our historic facility,\u201d Grenier said.\n\nGenerative AI was used to organize information for this story, based on data provided by the City of Saginaw Public Information Office.

      "text": "BANGOR TWP, MI \u2013 The rumors are true: Chick-fil-A is coming to Bay County.\nSignage for the popular restaurant chain has popped up along construction fencing at the intersection of Euclid Avenue and Wilder Road in Bangor Township, the site of where the old Kmart building was recently demolished.\nBangor Township Supervisor Glenn Rowley on Thursday, Aug. 21, confirmed the addition of the \u201chome of the original chicken sandwich\u201d after the company previously acknowledged it was \"actively pursuing a new location\" in the area.\nThe hope, a company spokesperson said previously, is that construction will begin on the restaurant in April 2026. A spokesperson said Thursday that the timeline has not changed.\nEach Chick-fil-A restaurant creates 80-120 jobs, a spokesperson previously told MLive.\nBefore construction of the restaurant could begin, contractors were tasked with demolishing the vacant building at 4001 N. Euclid Ave. that once housed Kmart.\nDemolition on the structure, built in 1965, according to property records, began earlier this month.\nThe popular restaurant would be the first of its kind in Bay County. One opened this year in Saginaw Township and has been overwhelmingly popular, with traffic often backed up onto Tittabawassee Road.\nSimilar traffic concerns were addressed by Bangor Township Planning Commission officials, who suggested adding a deceleration lane on Wilder Road to ease traffic for those interested in visiting the restaurant.\nEntryway reconstruction was noted as needing to occur before the restaurant could be feasible because \u201cthe existing commercial entrance is obsolete and substandard per current (Bay County Road Commission) commercial entrance requirements,\u201d according to meeting minutes."
