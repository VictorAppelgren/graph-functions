      "text": "How to watch NFL games without cable: The best football streaming deals for the 2025\u20132026 season\nTable of Contents\nIt's finally that time again: a new NFL season is upon us. That means it's also time to get all of your streaming services in order.\nNotorious gatekeepers of their broadcasts, watching NFL games has become a tangled web of subscriptions. Even if you still have cable, you're going to need a couple of extra subscriptions to watch every game. We've done our best to sort out all the complicated details for you.\nIf you want to watch your favorite teams battle it out this season with or without cable, here's everything you need to know \u2014 including the cheapest possible way to do so (legally).\nHow to watch NFL games during the 2025\u20132026 season\nSince no single network owns the rights to every game, watching your favorite teams isn't as cut and dry in the NFL as it is with some other sports. And now with streaming services throwing hats in the ring, even cable TV subscribers will need a few extras to catch every game.\nHere's the general schedule each week for the 2025\u20132026 season:\nThursday Night Football kicks off the week exclusively on Prime Video (starting week two)\nSunday afternoon games air on CBS (stream on Paramount+) for AFC teams and FOX (stream on Fox One) for NFC teams\nSunday Night Football games air on NBC and stream on Peacock\nMonday Night Football games air on ESPN, ABC, ESPN+ (stream on ESPN Unlimited)\nNFL Network will also broadcast seven different games throughout the season\nNetflix will once again broadcast two games on Christmas Day this season\nYouTube, for the first time, will broadcast the Chiefs vs. Chargers game week 1 from S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil\nIf you don't have cable, you have an abundance of options for watching games live. If you're a casual fan, you can simply invest in a digital TV antenna to catch local games and nationally broadcast games live on ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX. Beyond football, a digital antenna will also grant you free access to local news, nationally broadcast events like the Grammys or Oscars, and other network programming. If you're reasonably close to your local TV stations, you should be able to pick up at least the four main networks. Unfortunately, you probably won't be able to access ESPN.\nYou can also sign up for a live TV streaming service like YouTube TV or Fubo to get access to local networks, plus a ton of other channels. Live TV streaming services can be pretty pricey, but you do get a lot of bang for your buck. This option will get you ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, ESPN, and NFL Network in most markets. No need to be close to your local TV stations.\nWith either option you choose, you'll still have to sign up for Prime Video if you want to watch Thursday Night Football games and Netflix for the two games on Christmas Day. You can also utilize streaming apps like Peacock, Paramount+, the new Fox One, and revamped ESPN to watch many regular-season games. It's all up to you and how many games you want access to. Below, we've rounded up the best streaming deals for each streaming service required to watch football games this season.\nIn-market vs. out-of-market games\nBefore you pull the trigger on any paid TV provider or streaming service, you need to decide whether you want access to local in-market games or out-of-market games. This is where watching sports gets really confusing and frustrating.\nIf you're a fan of your local sports team and strictly want to watch their season unfold, a digital antenna or live TV streaming service will get the job done. You will generally only get access to in-market games, which include the teams geographically closest to you.\nIf your favorite teams are not geographically close to you, they will likely be blacked out unless they are national broadcasts. In this case, the only legal way you can watch out-of-market games is via NFL Sunday Ticket. A costly streaming service, NFL Sunday Ticket exclusively streams out-of-market, regular-season, Sunday football games. There are two ways to subscribe: as an add-on to a YouTube TV base plan or as an individual primetime channel on YouTube. It costs $378 as a YouTube TV add-on and $480 as a standalone service, although there are typically deals around the start of the season (more on that below).\nSo if you\u2019re a Baltimore Ravens fan living in Nashville, you can watch all of the Sunday Ravens games that aren\u2019t shown on NBC, CBS, or FOX in your area with NFL Sunday Ticket. If you're a Ravens fan living in or near Baltimore, however, you'll want to grab a digital antenna or sign up for a streaming service like Paramount+ or YouTube TV.\nThe best football streaming deals for the 2025\u20132026 NFL season\nThe best Prime Video deals for Thursday Night Football\nIn addition to Thursday Night Football games, Prime Video is also set to stream an exclusive Black Friday game and a playoff game again this season during Wildcard weekend. Prime members get access to Prime Video included in their subscription, which costs $14.99 per month. If you're new to Prime, you can even score a free 30-day trial before you'll owe a monthly fee. Here are a few other ways you can save some money.\nBest for long-term viewing: Prime Annual (save 22%)\nEnjoy the perks of a Prime membership, including access to Prime Video, for an entire year with a Prime Annual subscription. Rather than paying a $14.99 monthly fee, you'll pay $139 up front. That ends up saving you about 22%, knocking the price down to about $11.59 per month.\nMost affordable: Prime Video only (save $6 per month)\nIf you don't want all the extra perks of being a Prime member, you can simply subscribe to Prime Video as a standalone service for just $8.99 per month. That's $6 per month cheaper than a full Prime membership. Naturally, Amazon makes it unnecessarily complicated to sign up for Prime Video alone. When you go to sign up for a subscription, you'll have to select the option to \"see more plans\" or \"change plans\" and navigate to the option for Prime Video on its own. Like a Prime membership, you can still cancel whenever you please with no strings.\nBest for those under 24: Prime for Young Adults (save 50%)\nAmazon's Prime Student subscription has now evolved into Prime for Young Adults. Those between the ages of 18 and 24, as well as college students of any age, can now score a free six-month trial to Prime. After the trial period is up, it'll cost just $7.49 per month \u2014 that's 50% in savings. You'll have to verify your age or student status, but after that, the world of Prime is your oyster.\nThe best live TV streaming deals for NFL Sunday games\nSunday afternoon games are broadcast on either CBS (for AFC teams) or FOX (for NFC teams). CBS is accessible without cable through Paramount+, while FOX is now accessible through a new streaming service called Fox One (see bundle deal under Monday Night Football). Meanwhile, live TV streaming services like Fubo, YouTube TV, or Hulu + Live TV will give you access to both CBS and FOX, although they are much more expensive. Whichever route you choose, we've found a few different deals currently live for the start of the NFL season. Here are our top picks.\nBest for AFC games only: Paramount+ Essential annual subscription (save 17%)\nParamount+ is one of the most affordable streaming services at just $7.99 per month with ads. However, you can score it for even cheaper by opting for an annual subscription for $59.99. Slash 17% off when you pay for a year upfront. That knocks the monthly cost down to just $5 per month. Just note that Paramount+ only gives you access to in-network AFC games via CBS.\nBest for students who want to watch AFC games: Paramount+ for students\nStudents who want to watch in-network AFC games can score a Paramount+ Essential subscription for only $3.99 per month for 12 months. That's 50% cheaper than a typical Paramount+ subscription. You'll just have to verify your student status to unlock the deal.\nBest for NFC games only: Fox One annual subscription\nFox has finally launched its own streaming service, filling the gap for NFC games. With Fox One, you'll be able to catch in-market Sunday afternoon games, as well as plenty more of Fox's programming. It'll cost you $19.99 per month, but if you subscribe for the whole year, it's just $199. That's 17% in savings.\nBest live TV streaming service deal: YouTube TV (save $99 on your first three months)\nYouTube TV is one of our favorite live TV streaming options. It will give you access to all the networks you need to watch Sunday afternoon games in your network, as well as Sunday night and Monday night games \u2014 NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, NFL Network, and ESPN. Through Aug. 31, YouTube TV is offering new users a discount on their first three months of service. Plus, you can kick things off with a free 10-day trial. It usually costs $82.99 per month for the base plan, but you'll pay just $49.99 per month (save $99) for your first three months, making it the most affordable and most well-rounded option for a live TV streaming service.\nBest a la carte option: Sling Season Pass (save $50.95)\nIf you prepay for five months of Sling Orange, Blue, and Sports Extras, you can save $50.95 with Sling Season Pass. The Blue package gets you access to FOX, NBC, ABC, and NFL Network in local markets, while the Orange package gets you access to ESPN. With the Sports Extras add-on, you'll also get access to NFL RedZone, where you can see every touchdown that happens on Sunday afternoons. It'll cost you $329 for five months of Sling Season Pass, which is significantly cheaper than any other live TV streaming service. Just be sure to check your local market to ensure you'll have access to the channels you need.\nBest bang for your buck: Get Hulu + Live TV, Disney+, and ESPN+ all for $82.99 per month\nWhile other live TV streaming services might be a little cheaper, Hulu + Live TV comes with the most bang for your buck. You'll pay $82.99 per month and get access to the live TV channels you need to watch NFL games, plus Hulu, Disney+, and ESPN+ (all with ads). For comparison, YouTube TV is also $82.99 per month and includes a similar live TV channel lineup, but no extras. Fubo is $84.99 per month and features a slightly wider channel lineup, but still no extras. Unfortunately, there's no introductory offer, but you will get your first three days for free.\nAnother live TV streaming deal: Take $30 off your first month of Fubo\nFubo isn't our first pick for a live TV streaming service, simply because it's too expensive. However, the streamer is currently offering new subscribers their first month at $30 off. That knocks the Pro plan down to $54.99 for your first month ($84.99 per month thereafter) and the Elite plan with Sports Plus down to $74.99 for your first month ($104.99 per month thereafter).\nThe best Peacock deals for streaming Sunday Night Football\nIf you don't have access to local networks via a live TV streaming service or a digital antenna, you can still tune into Sunday Night Football on NBC by signing up for Peacock. The streamer will also host a Week 17 Peacock exclusive game, as well as the Super Bowl. After a recent price hike, subscriptions now start at $10.99 per month, but we've rounded up a few ways you can save.\nBest for long-term viewing: Peacock Premium yearly subscription (save 17%)\nIf Peacock isn't running any sort of special, the best Peacock deal for most people on any given day is the annual subscription deal. And since you're going to need the streamer long term if you plan on watching the Big Game in February, it's worth committing to a yearly subscription. A monthly subscription with ads costs $10.99 per month (which adds up to $131.88), but a yearly subscription will only run you $109.99 (which breaks down to about $9.17 per month). That's about 17% in total savings. For those who prefer watching without ads, you'll pay $169.99 per year (which breaks down to about $14.16 per month instead of $16.99).\nBest for students: Peacock Premium Student Discount (save $8 per month)\nStudents wanting to tune into Sunday Night Football can score a Peacock Premium subscription for only $2.99 per month for an entire year. That's $8 cheaper than a typical Peacock subscription. You'll just have to be able to prove your student status through SheerID.\nBest for first responders, teachers, military: Peacock Premium for $3.99 per month\nWith annual first responder and military verification through SheerID, you can get Peacock Premium for just $3.99 per month. Upon verification, you'll receive a unique promo code to use when subscribing to Peacock. That will knock $7 per month off your total cost for the streaming service. Teachers can also score Peacock Premium for $3.99 per month, although their promotional period is limited to one year.\nBest Peacock third-party deal: Free Peacock Premium with Instacart+ (save $10.99 per month)\nIf you subscribe to Instacart+ for free grocery delivery, which costs either $99 per year or $9.99 per month, you'll get a free Peacock Premium subscription included. Just log in to your Instacart account, select your Instacart+ membership, then \"unlock special offers\" and activate the Peacock offer. You'll get redirected to Peacock's website, where you can sign in or create an account to activate the benefit.\nThe best ESPN deals for Monday Night Football\nLast season, in order to watch Monday Night Football games on ESPN and ABC, you needed a live TV streaming service that included the channels in its lineup. This season, things have evolved. ESPN launched its own direct-to-consumer streaming service on Aug. 21, which means you can stream games on ESPN, ABC, and ESPN+ live without cable on the ESPN Unlimited plan. ESPN also recently acquired the rights to NFL Network and RedZone, so these channels are expected to stream on the new ESPN app as well. It costs $29.99 per month, but there are a few options that allow you to save some money.\nBest for long-term viewing: ESPN Unlimited annual subscription (save 17%)\nIf you're all in on ESPN's new streaming service, you can save about 17% by subscribing for a full year instead of paying monthly. It'll cost you $299.99 in total, which breaks down to about $24.99 each month. That means you'll save $5 every month.\nBest introductory deal: ESPN Unlimited with Disney+ and Hulu (save $19.98/month)\nAs an introduction to its new streaming service, ESPN is offering its Unlimited plan bundled with Disney+ and Hulu (both with ads) for just $29.99 per month for your first year. That essentially gets you Hulu and Disney+ for free.\nBest bundle deal: ESPN Unlimited + Fox One\nYou can watch live Monday Night Football games on ESPN, ABC, and ESPN+, plus live Sunday afternoon games on Fox with the new ESPN Unlimited and Fox One bundle. Usually $29.99 per month apiece, you can sign up for both for just $39.99 and save $10 each month. This is a great value, particularly if you're a fan of an NFC team. Unfortunately, the bundle deal isn't set to launch until Oct. 2, so you'll have to subscribe to both separately in the meantime.\nWhat's the cheapest way to watch the most NFL games this season?\nGood question. If you want to watch mainly in-market games and nationally broadcast games, the cheapest way to do so would be to sign up for the new ESPN Unlimited and Fox One bundle, Peacock, Paramount+, and Prime Video for a grand total of $67.96 per month. This will give you access to FOX (via Fox One), ABC, ESPN, and ESPN+ (via ESPN Unlimited), NBC (via Peacock), CBS (via Paramount+), and Prime Video. You could also add Netflix into the mix in December if you want access to those two games for $6.99 (per month). If you add Netflix to the total, December would run you a little more at $74.95.\nHere's the breakdown:\n$39.99 per month for ESPN Unlimited and Fox One \u2014 NFC games on Sunday afternoons and Monday Night Football games on ABC, ESPN, and ESPN+\n$10.99 per month for Peacock \u2014 Sunday Night Football games on NBC, plus Peacock-exclusive game\n$7.99 per month for Paramount+ \u2014 AFC games on Sunday afternoons\n$8.99 per month for Prime Video \u2014 Thursday Night Football\n$6.99 per month for Netflix \u2014 two exclusive games in December\nFor out-of-market games, things get a bit more expensive. NFL Sunday Ticket is one of the only ways you can watch out-of-market games throughout the season. If you run and sign up before the Aug. 31 cutoff, new subscribers can score NFL Sunday Ticket for $34.50 per month, or $276 total for the regular season. It's typically $60 per month or $480 total, so we highly recommend signing up sooner rather than later. Check out our guide to out-of-market games for more information.\nAnother option for out-of-market games would be to sign up for a VPN and attempt to use a different location with any of the live TV streaming services above. For more information about VPNs and how to watch the NFL 2025\u20132026 season from other countries (or pretending to), check out this article on bypassing geo-restrictions.\nTopics Streaming Sports How to Watch\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhile it would be extremely generous of Amazon to offer games for free, that's not the case. In order to watch Thursday Night Football games on Prime Video, you'll need either a Prime membership ($14.99 per month) or a Prime Video subscription ($8.99 per month). If you're new to Prime or returning after some time away, however, you can get a free 30-day trial to kick things off.\nNFL+ is the NFL's official subscription service. The streaming provider allows subscribers to stream any national or local market games, regardless of the network or streaming service. Out of market games are not available. It's important to note, however, that the games can only be viewed on phones and tablets. That's why we don't typically recommend it. NFL+ Premium allows access to NFL RedZone as well as game replays of in and out-of-market games.\nNFL+ costs $6.99 per month and $49.99 annually, while NFL+ Premium costs $14.99 per month or $99.99 annually.\nIf you're a fan of a team outside your local market, you've got it rough in 2025. The only way to simply and legally access out-of-market games is through an NFL Sunday Ticket subscription, which is outrageously overpriced at $480 per year. NFL Sunday Ticket is a premium sports package exclusively available through YouTube that broadcasts all out-of-market regular season Sunday NFL games. So, for example, if you're a Baltimore fan living in Nashville, you'll be able to tune into Ravens games on CBS instead of Titans.\nYour other options are to go to a local bar that broadcasts all of the games, or try your hand at using a VPN to bypass geo-restrictions. Top VPNs like NordVPN and ExpressVPN may allow you to skirt a blacked out game by setting your location to a different region in the U.S. It's worth a shot if you have some decent internet skills and don't want to pay $480 for Sunday Ticket.\nFour separate international games will air on NFL Network this season, as will three other games through the regular season. Unfortunately, NFL Network isn't a local channel, so an over-the-air antenna won't grant you access. The only way non-cable subscribers can watch NFL Network without cable is through a live TV streaming service like Sling, Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, or Fubo.

      "text": "Amazon just dropped the Google Pixel Tablet to the lowest price ever\nSAVE $150: The Google Pixel Tablet (128GB, porcelain) is on sale at Amazon for $249, down from the normal price of $399. That's a 38% discount and the lowest we've ever seen at Amazon.\nWe have tons of new TV shows dropping in the next few weeks and months. There's The Great British Bake Off starting next week, a new season of Only Murders in the Building on the way, and Season 2 of Fallout coming in mid-December. Will you be streaming these from your tiny phone screen while squinting? They deserve a better and bigger stage, and for that, you might want a tablet. If you're in need, check out this rare deal at Amazon.\nAs of Aug. 28, the Google Pixel Tablet (128GB, porcelain) is on sale for $249 at Amazon, marked down from the standard list price of $399. That works out to a savings of $150 from a 38% discount. And that turns out to be the lowest price we've ever spotted at Amazon, so long as you're cool with the porcelain colorway.\nWith an 11-inch screen and 128GB of storage, the Google Pixel Tablet is an awesome companion for streaming shows from the couch. It can also be an ideal option for students since the 27Wh battery can get about 12 hours of video streaming before it needs a recharge. That means it should last all day for taking lecture notes and joining group meetings with video chat.\nAnother useful feature of the Google Pixel Tablet is the split-screen function. With this, you can view two screens in a side-by-side configuration. The four speakers are also great for video chats, rewatching lectures, or streaming Sunday afternoon football.\nIf you have other Google Home devices, you can use the Pixel Tablet to control settings like turning off lights, checking on the video doorbell live view, or adjusting your home's temperature.\nWhile it's down to a record-low price, upgrade to the Google Pixel Tablet. It's just under $250 at Amazon, and it'll make upcoming fall shows and games that much better.\nLauren Allain is a freelance journalist covering deals at Mashable. She graduated from Western Washington University with a B.A. in journalism and holds an M.B.A from Webster Leiden. You can find more of her work online from publications including Reader\u2019s Digest, U.S. News & World Report, Seattle Refined, and more. When she\u2019s not writing, Lauren prefers to be outside hiking, bouldering, swimming, or searching for the perfect location for all three."

      "text": "What's new to streaming this week? (Aug. 29, 2025)\nLooking for something great to watch at home? Streaming subscribers are spoiled for choice between Hulu, Netflix, HBO Max, Disney+, Apple TV+, Prime Video, Shudder, Paramount+, Peacock, and more. And that's before you even look at the vast libraries of movies and television programs within each streamer!\nDon't be overwhelmed or waste an hour scrolling through your services to determine what to watch. We've got your back, whatever your mood. Mashable offers watch guides for all of the above, broken down by genre: comedy, thriller, horror, documentary, and animation, among others. But if you're seeking something brand-new (or just new to streaming), we've got you covered there, too.\nMashable's entertainment team has scoured the streaming services to highlight the most buzzed-about releases of this week and ranked them from worst to best \u2014 or least worth your time to most watchable. Whether you're hankering for superhero action, star-studded romance, gnarly horror, cozy crime, or a fan-focused documentary, we've got something just for you.\n7. Winter Spring Summer or Fall\nWednesday fans might welcome this romantic drama that reunites Jenna Ortega and Percy Hynes White. However, the buzz was very bad on the Tiffany Paulsen\u2013helmed film.\nOut of the Tribeca Film Festival, Mashable's Belen Edwards reviewed the film, writing, \"Winter Spring Summer or Fall seems to think it's a Gen Z Before Sunrise\" noting the movie takes place over a year instead of a night, and you feel it. She added, \"Generic teen romance tropes and cringeworthy dialogue don't help, but the cardboard characterization and excruciating series of red flag-filled 'meet-cutes' take the film from unremarkable to downright painful to watch.\" \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Jenna Ortega, Percy Hynes White, Marisol Nichols, Elias Kacavas, and Adam Rodriguez\nHow to watch: Winter Spring Summer or Fall debuts on Paramount+ on Sept. 1.\n6. Thunderbolts*\nThe 36th MCU movie plays like Marvel's version of Suicide Squad, boasting a star-stuffed cast that includes Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, and David Harbour playing chaotic antiheroes.\nMisfits like Yelena Belova (Pugh), Bucky (Stan), Red Guardian (Harbour), Taskmaster (Olga Kurylenko), Ghost (Hannah John-Kamen), and John Walker (Wyatt Russell) are united by CIA director Valentina de Fontaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) \u2014 whether she likes it or not! Together, they must not only battle a new big bad who's terrorizing New York City, but also their own inner demons.\nDespite a promising setup and exciting cast, Thunderbolts* wasn't what fans hoped for. In my review for Mashable, I wrote, \"Sure, there's action, callbacks, deep-dive comic book lore, and the occasional character-driven comedy beat. But overall, Thunderbolts* feels like two to six ideas for a movie haphazardly cobbled together. There's little flow, less fun, and a final act that feels more like a cheat than an achievement.\"* \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Florence Pugh, Sebastian Stan, Olga Kurylenko, Hannah John-Kamen, Wyatt Russell, Lewis Pullman, David Harbour, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus\nHow to watch: Thunderbolts* is now available for purchase on Prime Video.\n5. Together\nThe last time real-life married couple Dave Franco and Alison Brie teamed up for horror, it was the scintillating thriller The Rental. But Together brings them closer than any film before.\nWritten and directed by Michael Shanks, Together stars Franco and Brie as a couple struggling to take the next step in their relationship. Moving to the countryside for a new job, Millie (Brie) is excited for a fresh start with her boyfriend Tim (Franco), an aspiring musician who's been stuck since a family tragedy. But in this new setting, Tim just feels trapped. And things only get worse when a bizarre experience in the woods has these two finding their skin very eager to knit together.\nWhile the premise is promising, the body horror can't out-ick something like the Oscar-nominated The Substance. However, as I wrote in my review for Mashable, \"Still, Together is a twisted ride that's sure to give you goosebumps.\" \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Dave Franco, Alison Brie, and Damon Herriman\nHow to watch: Together is now available to rent or purchase on Prime Video.\n4. I Know What You Did Last Summer (2025)\nPart reboot, part sequel, I Know What You Did Last Summer not only pulls major inspiration from the 1997 original, but co-stars Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. as well.\nIn the fishing village of Southport, North Carolina, a gaggle of teens accidentally kills someone, covers it up, and seems to have gotten away with it. That is, until a mysterious figure with a hook as a weapon starts stalking them down. Who better to help them survive than the Final Girl (and guy) from the first film?\nIn his review for Mashable, Jason Adams cheered, \"Here, Robinson's film leans into the fun of horror legacy, playing to the strengths of the '90s original and throwing curveballs at a new generation. It's all a learning process: When life stabs you, you strike a pose in your designer jeans and vintage rock tee and stab it the hell back, baby.\" \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Madelyn Cline, Chase Sui Wonders, Jonah Hauer-King, Tyriq Withers, Sarah Pidgeon, Billy Campbell, Gabbriette Bechtel, Austin Nichols, Freddie Prinze Jr., and Jennifer Love Hewitt\nHow to watch: I Know What You Did Last Summer is now available to rent or purchase on Prime Video.\nDon\u2019t miss out on our latest stories: Add Mashable as a trusted news source in Google.\n3. Wednesday, Season 2, Part 2\nWith all the burning questions we had at the end of Wednesday Season 2, Part 1, we're chomping at the bit to get into the second half. After the festering hell that broke loose in Willow Hill, the fate of Wednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) seems up in the air. But Part 2 promises the return of Gwendoline Christie as Season 1's early departed Principal Weems, answers to the curliest question marks, more Edgar Allan Poe energy, and the awaited arrival of Lady Gaga.\nBut most of all, we need more of Wednesday's eviscerating barbs in our life \u2014 as Belen Edwards writes in her Part 1 review, \"With one deadly glare and a dry putdown in voiceover, Ortega's Wednesday is still a force to be reckoned with. (Especially now that she's not burdened with a love triangle!) Watching her detective exploits continues to be pure gothic fun, and that's something worth snapping about.\" \u2014 S.C.\nStarring: Jenna Ortega, Isaac Ordonez, Victor Dorobantu, Luis Guzm\u00e1n, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Joanna Lumley, Fred Armisen, Emma Myers, Hunter Doohan, Joy Sunday, Moosa Mostafa, Georgie Farmer, Noah B. Taylor, Evie Templeton, Steve Buscemi, Billie Piper, Christopher Lloyd, Luyanda Unati Lewis-Nyawo, Jamie McShane, and Thandiwe Newton\nHow to watch: Wednesday, Season 2, Part 2 premieres on Netflix on Sept. 3.\n2. Stans\nShady Films\u2013produced Eminem documentary Stans is truly one for the fans in every sense of the word \u2014 one born from the 2000 Eminem song itself.\nAmid the famous talking heads and longtime fans interviewed, director Steven Leckart and producers Paul Rosenberg and Tony DiSanto attempt to get to the heart of both the artist known as Marshall Mathers and the nature of fandom itself. As I wrote in my review, Stans is \"an ode to the connection between artistic empathy and mental health, a compelling exploration of fandom itself and parasocial relationships, and \u2014 specifically thanks to Eminem's final line \u2014 a middle finger to anyone who has anything negative to say about it.\" \u2014 S.C.\nHow to watch: Stans is now streaming on Paramount+.\n1. The Thursday Murder Club\nBased on the popular mystery novel by Richard Osman, The Thursday Murder Club focuses on a quartet of pensioners who use their diverse set of skills to solve cold cases over tea and cake.\nThis cozy crime comedy stars Helen Mirren, Pierce Brosnan, Ben Kingsley, and Celia Imrie as the eponymous club, which sets out to solve a decades-old murder but finds fresh blood. In a resplendent retirement community in England, this dynamic foursome crack jokes as they crack into the case with the help of local police and some unsavory suspects. If you loved the book, you'll relish director Chris Columbus' earnest adaptation. If you haven't read the books, use this as your launchpad to get into a series that of novels that is downright addictive! \u2014 K.P.\nStarring: Helen Mirren, Pierce Brosnan, Ben Kingsley, Celia Imrie, David Tennant, Jonathan Pryce, Naomi Ackie, Daniel Mays, Henry Lloyd-Hughes, Richard E. Grant, Tom Ellis, Geoff Bell, Paul Freeman, Sarah Niles, and Ingrid Oliver\nHow to watch: The Thursday Murder Club premieres on Netflix on Aug. 28.\nTopics Streaming Watch Guides\nShannon Connellan is Mashable's UK Editor based in London, formerly Mashable's Australia Editor, but emotionally, she lives in the Creel House.

It was started as a search engine that ranked results based on the websites' relevance to the search query. Searching for something on Google became so ubiquitous that \"google\" is now listed as a verb in the dictionary. In addition to its search engine, Google products include, advertising through Google Ads, Gmail and Google drive cloud computing, and consumer products like the Google Pixel smartphone, Chromebook laptop, and Nest smart home system. Google, as well as other major tech companies like Facebook and Amazon have been criticized for violating antitrust laws and inhibiting business competition. Through its cloud services, search engine data, and consumer products, that all collect personal information, Google has also been the subject of privacy concerns. Today, Google is one of the biggest and most powerful tech companies in the world."

Upon veri\ufb01cation that your purchase quali\ufb01es and that you have satis\ufb01ed applicable requirements, the Reward speci\ufb01ed for the applicable Rewards O\ufb00er will be considered an Approved Reward. YOU MUST CLICK ON THE PROMOTION LINK FOR THE REWARDS OFFER DURING THE SAME SHOPPING SESSION THAT YOU COMPLETE YOUR PURCHASE FROM THE MERCHANT. THE PURCHASE MUST BE MADE IN US DOLLARS. IF YOU VISIT OTHER SITES BEFORE COMPLETING YOUR PURCHASE, OR IF YOU USE COUPON CODES NOT PROVIDED BY RETAILMENOT, YOUR PURCHASE MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH A SERVICE OTHER THAN RETAILMENOT AND YOU MAY NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THE REWARD(S). YOU MUST NOT ENABLE AN AD BLOCKER OR OTHERWISE DISABLE COOKIES ON YOUR COMPUTER, BECAUSE COOKIES ARE USED TO AUTHENTICATE YOUR PURCHASE. RetailMeNot In-Store Cash Back Rewards. To earn Rewards pursuant to a Rewards O\ufb00er for In-Store Cash Back Rewards by submitting a Receipt, you must: (1) Activate the Rewards O\ufb00er, if applicable; (2) complete the required purchase via a Quali\ufb01ed Transaction; (3) submit a valid, readable Receipt through the Promotion Landing Page in accordance with the stated terms; and (4) satisfy any and all other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card.

RetailMeNot Receipt Scanning. You agree to at all times provide accurate and complete information to RetailMeNot. You agree not to: submit a Receipt that is false, inaccurate, fabricated, counterfeited, incomplete, tampered with, adjusted, or otherwise inauthentic for the purpose of seeking to claim a Reward; redeem, or attempt to redeem, a Reward for products that have not actually been purchased, or for products that have been returned; submit or attempt to submit a Receipt that has already been submitted or used by you or another user; or submit Receipts outside of a Promotion Period, or for a purchase that took place prior to or after the launch date of a Rewards O\ufb00er. RetailMeNot may, in its sole discretion, extend or shorten the redemption period for a Rewards O\ufb00er. As between you and RetailMeNot, the determination as to what transactions are Qualifying Transactions shall be made by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Bonus Rewards. From time to time, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er a Bonus Reward to certain RetailMeNot members who complete a qualifying activity or who meet certain criteria, as de\ufb01ned in a Rewards O\ufb00er Card or Promotion Landing Page, in addition to or in combination with o\ufb00ers for Online Cash Back Rewards or In-Store Cash Back Rewards. For example, RetailMeNot may o\ufb00er certain Bonus Rewards to new members who earn an Online Cash Back Reward for the \ufb01rst time or earn certain Online Cash Back Rewards for the \ufb01rst time. In order to earn a Bonus Reward, you must satisfy all criteria set forth for earning the Bonus Reward as well as the requirements of these Promotion Terms during the promotion period for the Bonus Reward. RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust the promotion period and/or the bonus amount for Bonus Reward, at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Bonus Rewards are a limited time o\ufb00er and all criteria must be satis\ufb01ed within the dates of the Promotion. Returns, Approvals, and No Ownership. For any Rewards O\ufb00er, if you return or exchange the items purchased, complete your purchase before or after the Promotion Period, initiate a purchase that results in a chargeback, or fail to satisfy a Minimum Purchase Amount, or any other conditions speci\ufb01ed on the Promotion Landing Page or Rewards O\ufb00er Card, RetailMeNot reserves the right to invalidate or withdraw all or part of the Rewards O\ufb00er, or reclaim Reward earnings. The determination of whether or not a purchase quali\ufb01es for the Rewards O\ufb00er and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed is at the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. In the event of a dispute, you may be required to provide your order con\ufb01rmation as proof of purchase. Order confirmations must be provided within six (6) months from the purchase date to qualify for this review. The timing of when RetailMeNot will issue an Approved Reward will vary based on a number of factors. These factors may include the type of Promotion pursuant to which a Reward is o\ufb00ered and your account activity as a member of RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the order and timing in which to process its con\ufb01rmation of eligible purchases. Rewards may be limited where participation exceeds the Total Rewards O\ufb00ers available during Promotion or in other cases, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. RetailMeNot also reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reevaluate Approved Rewards, at any time, without notice, including, but not limited to, whether purchases qualify for the Promotion and whether applicable conditions have been satis\ufb01ed, and RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, may adjust or withdraw any Rewards O\ufb00ers or any Approved Rewards (or reclaim Reward earnings), at any time, without notice. All decisions by RetailMeNot are \ufb01nal and binding on you. Participating in a Rewards O\ufb00er does not give you ownership or any other legal claim to any Reward unless and until RetailMeNot, in its sole discretion, determines that you have met all eligibility criteria and ful\ufb01lled all requirements for the Promotion and you have completed the Redemption Process. Rewards O\ufb00ers are provided solely by RetailMeNot and are not underwritten or funded by any other third party. You may not make any claims for Rewards O\ufb00ers against Merchants or any other third party. Notwithstanding that Rewards O\ufb00ers may include o\ufb00ers of cash, prior to redemption, Rewards O\ufb00ers and Approved Rewards have no monetary value and you may not obtain any money or any other thing of value for any Approved Reward or participation in any Rewards O\ufb00er unless and until you complete the Redemption Process and a payment has been issued by RetailMeNot for Approved Rewards. Wallet and Redeeming Rewards. Approved Rewards will be shown in the RetailMeNot Rewards Wallet. You have no vested rights in Approved Rewards unless and until you complete the Redemption Process. If your RetailMeNot account is terminated by RetailMeNot, as provided in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, or if you elect to close your RetailMeNot account, you will no longer be permitted to access the Rewards Wallet or redeem Approved Rewards shown therein. You may redeem Approved Rewards for cash using PayPal or Venmo. Redeeming for cash to Paypal or Venmo. In order to redeem Approved Rewards for cash via PayPal or Venmo, you must: (1) have or create a PayPal or Venmo Account that is linked to the phone number or email address, where applicable, that RetailMeNot has on \ufb01le for you; (2) navigate to the \u201cMy Rewards\u201d section of your account, click \u201cRedeem Rewards\u201d, and then click either \u201cPaypal\u201d or \u201cVenmo\u201d, as applicable; and (3) perform any actions speci\ufb01ed in the RetailMeNot app or website, as modi\ufb01ed from time to time in the sole discretion of RetailMeNot. For example, such actions may include, but are not limited to, authenticating your account by providing a US based cell phone number with SMS capabilities, re-entering a password, and clicking the appropriate link or button. Once you have completed the required steps to redeem Approved Rewards, RetailMeNot will issue a payment to the PayPal or Venmo Account, as applicable, that is linked to the email address, or phone number, as applicable, that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account. An email or text message, where applicable, will be sent to that email address or phone number, where applicable, con\ufb01rming that the payment has been issued. Generally, redemption of an Approved Reward will result in the issuing of payment within minutes, but in some cases may require a longer time period. RetailMeNot is not responsible for lost or stolen payments or for delivery of payments to the wrong PayPal or Venmo account. If an account has not been credited with a Qualifying Transaction in the previous 12 months, it may be deemed an Inactive Cash Back Account. Accounts which meet this criteria will be debited a monthly maintenance fee in the amount of the lesser of $2.00 or the current account balance. Maintenance fees will not draw the account balance below $0.00. Maintenance fees will be assessed until the account balance reaches $0.00 or the account becomes an active cash back user again. Forced Redemptions. You are responsible for ensuring compliance with any limitations or requirements speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot from time to time, including, but not limited to, requirements not to redeem Approved Rewards that exceed amounts speci\ufb01ed by RetailMeNot. RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, from time to time, to cause the redemption of Approved Rewards, in whole or in part, and issue payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, but RetailMeNot undertakes no obligation to do so under any circumstances. You hereby authorize RetailMeNot to perform any such redemptions and issue any such payments to the PayPal or Venmo account linked to the email address or phone number that you provided RetailMeNot at the time you created your account, automatically and without further action by you. Abuse and Cancellations. RetailMeNot reserves the right to cancel, suspend and/or modify a user\u2019s account, entire Promotion, or any part of it, or the payment of any Rewards amounts at any time without obligation or notice to you, including, without limitation, if any fraud, technical failures, limit of available Rewards, gaming, human error or any other factor impairs the integrity, availability or proper functioning of the Promotion, as determined by RetailMeNot in its sole discretion. Without limiting anything in these Promotion Terms or the Terms of Use, RetailMeNot reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to disqualify, terminate or suspend the participation in any Promotion, or otherwise prevent future participation, of any individual it \ufb01nds, or reasonably suspects, to be tampering with the operation of a Promotion (including by submitting or attempting to submit fraudulent or ineligible Receipts) or to be acting in violation of the Promotion Terms or any promotion, or in behaving in an unethical, dishonest, deceptive or disruptive manner. Any attempt by any person to deliberately undermine the legitimate operation of the Promotion may be in violation of criminal and civil law, and, should such an attempt be made, RetailMeNot reserves the right to seek damages from any such person to the fullest extent permitted by law. RetailMeNot shall not be liable to you for any suspension, modi\ufb01cation or termination of a Rewards O\ufb00er, Approved Rewards, or the Promotion program. Use of any automated means or more than one account is prohibited and will result in disquali\ufb01cation. In the event of any dispute as to the quali\ufb01cation of potential recipients of a Reward, the authorized account holder of the email address or phone number provided to RetailMeNot at the time the account was created will be deemed the quali\ufb01ed Reward recipient. The \u201cauthorized account holder\u201d is the natural person assigned an email address by an Internet access provider, online service provider or other organization responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted address. Each potential recipient of Rewards may be required to show proof of being an authorized account holder. If your account remains inactive for 24 months, RetailMeNot reserves the right to permanently close the Account at which time the cash back rewards will be considered expired and will no longer be eligible for redemption. Before closing the Account, RetailMeNot will attempt to alert you to the fact that your account may be shut down due to inactivity. Premium Services: Certain Services provided by Ziff Davis require registration and payment (such Services are referred to collectively as the \u201cPremium Services\u201d). You are responsible for paying any and all charges relating to your Premium Services account, including without limitation, periodic subscription fees (the initial fee and automatic renewals). You grant to Ziff Davis\u2019 third party payment processor(s) permission to charge your credit card (or other approved payment mechanism) to pay for all such charges. The Premium Service subscription fee will be billed at the beginning of your subscription and on each annual, quarterly or monthly renewal thereafter, dependent on the original subscription term selected at registration, unless you cancel at least ten (10) days prior to the renewal date pursuant to the process set forth below. If Ziff Davis does not receive payment from the credit card issuer or its agent, you agree to pay all amounts due upon our demand. Your card issuer agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection with the Premium Services, and you must refer to that agreement and not this Agreement to determine your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. YOU, AND NOT ZIFF DAVIS, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, EVEN IF THEY WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. For CNET Cash Back and Rewards Services Acceptance of terms. By using the Services, you acknowledge that you have read and understood these terms and conditions, and that you agree to be legally bound by all of them. You also acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to review and agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to all of these terms and conditions, you may not participate in or use the Services. Eligibility. You represent and warrant that you are at least eighteen (18) years of age. If you are under age eighteen (18), you may not, under any circumstances or for any reason, use the Services. Rewards. The Services enable you to access and earn rewards, subject to the guidelines herein (\u201cServices\u201d). CNET offers users opportunities to earn cash back on their purchases from Merchants activated by the creation of trackable links (\u201cLinks\u201d) for a Merchant as a way to incentivize the purchase and promotion of the Merchant\u2019s products. Links are configured to track and attribute transactions to you so that you may earn a reward if you or someone to whom you send a Link completes a qualifying transaction with a Merchant. The CNET cashback program is an incentive and promotional program. Some transactions may not earn rewards or may earn at a rate different from the rate indicated by the Service. You are not guaranteed to earn a reward from a transaction for several reasons, without notice to you, including, without limitation: Merchants may alter terms, conditions, or commission rates. Merchants may discontinue their programs. Merchants may exclude certain products from Reward eligibility. Merchants may have technical failures which result in transactions failing to be tracked or attributed to you. Links may fail to function properly. Links may be disabled by web browsers or ad blockers. Merchants may reject transactions due to suspected policy violations. Other: charge-backs, product returns, accounting error, Merchant non-payment, fraudulent transactions, our inability to contact you to validate transactions, your inappropriate distribution of Links, or your failure to comply with Merchant policies. If the Merchant pays less than the expected amount or does not pay a commission for the transaction, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to adjust or cancel the reward. Furthermore, we reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to withhold, cancel or adjust the amount of any reward, for any reason at any time. By using the Services, you accept this condition. CNET may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to any person, including any affiliate, without your consent. Payout timing. We only provide a reward to you after a transaction is successfully tracked and completed, after we receive payment for that specific transaction from the Merchant, and after you accrue the Minimum Redemption Amount (as defined below). Merchants usually have holdback periods during which they hold a pending payment (for example, until the expiration of a return policy and/or until a service is consumed). Rewards remain in a pending state until we receive payment from the Merchant for the associated transaction. After we receive payment and you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, you may request to redeem your rewards. Payout Threshold. A minimum approved balance of $10.00 is required for redemption (the \u201cMinimum Redemption Amount\u201d). This amount may change from time to time, in our sole discretion, without notice to you. If your balance is below the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards will be stored in a record on your account and may be subject to a Dormant Account Fee (as defined below). Once you have accrued the Minimum Redemption Amount, rewards may be redeemed for third-party merchant gift cards. Use of a third-party merchant gift card at a selected merchant will be subject to such merchant\u2019s and/or the gift card issuer\u2019s own terms of service. Coupons. Some rewards may include coupons, discounts or promotions from Merchants (\u201cOffers\u201d). We do not guarantee that Merchants will honor Offers. Offer codes may be expired or invalid. Offers may not be eligible for your transaction, based upon exclusions, terms and conditions determined by Merchants. Offers are not redeemable for any value with CNET. Dormant accounts. If you have pending rewards and your account has no new activity (defined as the earning of a pending reward) for a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days, we reserve the right to assess a monthly Dormant Account Fee of up to $5.00 USD, until such time as your reward balance reaches $0.00, to recover the cost associated with maintenance of the account. Any Dormant Account Fee we apply may or may not be displayed in your user dashboard. If your account has no new activity for a period of twelve (12) months, we reserve the right to void any remaining balance of rewards in your account. Tax. You are solely responsible for independently assessing and complying with all relevant tax and legal requirements. We shall not provide you with tax or legal advice. Cookies. Some Merchants may place cookies (or other tracking beacons) on your device to recognize your device during a subsequent visit. If you, or those clicking on your shared Link, block or delete cookies, tracking and attribution may be inoperable, in which case no reward shall be earned. Third-Party Services. We do not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products, services or content of Merchants or other third parties. We are not an agent, broker or otherwise responsible for any Merchant\u2019s activities, policies, products or services.

International Use We make no claims that any Material, Services or any Content is appropriate or may be downloaded outside of the United States or outside the country where such Material, Services or any Content was produced. Access to the Material, Services or any Content may not be legal in certain countries or for certain persons.

Please do not send us any such ideas or materials relating to such ideas. This is to avoid any potential misunderstanding or dispute should our products or marketing strategies seem similar to unsolicited ideas submitted to us. If, despite this request, you do send us any unsolicited ideas or materials, we make no assurances that such ideas or materials will be treated as confidential or proprietary. 14. Binding Arbitration In the unlikely event that you\u2019re not satisfied with customer service\u2019s solution, and you and Ziff Davis are unable to resolve a dispute through the Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures below, we each agree to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Unless expressly limited by this arbitration provision, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. In arbitration you may be entitled to recover attorneys\u2019 fees from us to the same extent as you would be in court. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT (1) Claims Subject to Arbitration: To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, Ziff Davis and you agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us, except for claims arising from bodily injury or that pertain to enforcing, protecting, or the validity of your or our intellectual property rights (or the intellectual property rights of any of our licensors, affiliates and partners). This Arbitration Agreement is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other statutory or common-law legal theory; claims that arose before this or any prior Agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); claims for mental or emotional distress or injury not arising out of physical bodily injury; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a current member of a certified class; and claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. References to \u201cZiff Davis,\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cus\u201d in this Arbitration Agreement include our respective predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as our respective past, present, and future parents, subsidiaries and affiliates (including Ziff Davis, Inc., Ziff Davis, LLC, Everyday Health, Inc., Everyday Health Media, LLC, and their affiliates); those entities and our respective agents, employees, licensees, licensors, and providers of content as of the time your or our claim arises; and all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of Services under this or prior Agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may elect to have claims heard in small claims court seeking only individualized relief, so long as the action is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction. This Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies. You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action and to a trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law. This Agreement evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-16) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. This Arbitration Agreement shall survive termination of this Agreement. (2) Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures: You and we agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, cost-effective and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to initiate arbitration or file a claim in small claims court must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (\u201cNotice\u201d). A Notice from you to Ziff Davis must be emailed to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com (\u201cNotice Address\u201d). Any Notice must include (i) the claimant\u2019s name, address, and email address; (ii) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; (iii) if you are submitting the Notice, any relevant facts regarding your use of the Sites, including whether you have created an account with or receive any newsletters associated with any of the Sites; (iv) a description of the nature and basis of the specific relief sought, including the damages sought, if any, and a detailed calculation for them; and (v) a personally signed statement from the claimant (and not their counsel) verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Notice. The Notice must be individualized, meaning it can concern only your dispute and no other person\u2019s dispute. After receipt of a completed Notice, the parties shall engage in a good faith effort to resolve the dispute for a period of 60 days (which can be extended by agreement). You and we agree that, after receipt of the completed Notice, the recipient may request an individualized video settlement conference (which can be held after the 60-day period) and both parties will personally attend (with counsel, if represented). If you are unable to participate in the settlement conference by video, you may attend telephonically upon showing of good cause or extraordinary circumstances warranting telephonic participation (e.g., inability to afford equipment or sufficient Wi-Fi due to indigent circumstances). You and we agree that the parties (and counsel, if represented) shall work cooperatively to schedule the conference at the earliest mutually convenient time and to seek to reach a resolution. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the issues identified in the Notice within 60 days after the completed Notice is received (or a longer time if agreed to by the parties), you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding or a small claims court proceeding (if permitted by small claims court rules). Compliance with this Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures section is a condition precedent to initiating arbitration. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section 13(2). All of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are essential so that you and Ziff Davis have a meaningful opportunity to resolve disputes informally. If any aspect of these requirements has not been met, a court of competent jurisdiction may enjoin the filing or prosecution of an arbitration. In addition, unless prohibited by law, the arbitration administrator may not accept, administer, assess, or demand fees in connection with an arbitration that has been initiated without completion of the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures. If the arbitration is already pending, it shall be administratively closed. Nothing in this paragraph limits the right of a party to seek damages for non-compliance with these Procedures in arbitration. (3) Arbitration Procedure: The arbitration will be governed by applicable rules of National Arbitration & Mediation (\u201cNAM\u201d) (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (\u201cNAM Rules\u201d), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement, and will be administered by NAM. (If NAM is unavailable or unwilling to do so, another arbitration provider shall be selected by the parties that will do so, or if the parties are unable to agree on an alternative administrator, by the court pursuant to 9 U.S.C. \u00a75.) The NAM Rules are available online at www.namadr.com or by requesting them in writing at the Notice Address. You may obtain a form to initiate arbitration at: https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2020/09/Comprehensive-Demand-for-Arb-revised-9.18.19.pdf or by contacting NAM. We and you agree that the party initiating arbitration must submit a certification that they have complied with and completed the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures requirements referenced in Section 13(2) and that they are a party to the Arbitration Agreement enclosed with or attached to the demand for arbitration. The demand for arbitration and certification must be personally signed by the party initiating arbitration (and their counsel, if represented). All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. The arbitrator may consider but shall not be bound by rulings in other arbitrations involving different customers. Unless we and you agree otherwise, or the applicable NAM Rules dictate otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your billing address and you and a Ziff Davis representative will be required to attend in person. At the conclusion of the arbitration proceeding, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is binding only between you and Ziff Davis and will not have any preclusive effect in another arbitration or proceeding that involves a different party. An arbitrator\u2019s award that has been fully satisfied shall not be entered in any court. As in court, you and Ziff Davis agree that any counsel representing a party in arbitration certifies when initiating and proceeding in arbitration that they are complying with the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), including certification that the claim or relief sought is neither frivolous nor brought for an improper purpose. The arbitrator is authorized to impose any sanctions under the NAM Rules, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, or applicable federal or state law, against all appropriately represented parties and counsel. Except as expressly provided in the Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may grant any remedy, relief, or outcome that the parties could have received in court, including awards of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, in accordance with applicable law. Unless otherwise provided by applicable law, the parties shall bear their own attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator awards sanctions or finds that either the substance of the claim, the defense, or the relief sought is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 (b)). (4) Arbitration Fees: The payment of arbitration fees (the fees imposed by the arbitration administrator including filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees) will be governed by the applicable NAM Rules, unless you qualify for a fee waiver under applicable law. If after exhausting any potentially available fee waivers, the arbitrator finds that the arbitration fees will be prohibitive for you as compared to litigation, we will pay as much of your filing, arbitrator, and hearing fees in the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive, regardless of the outcome of the arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or brought for an improper purpose or asserted in bad faith. You and we agree that arbitration should be cost-effective for all parties and that any party may engage with NAM to address the reduction or deferral of fees. (5) Confidentiality: Upon either party\u2019s request, the arbitrator will issue an order requiring that confidential information of either party disclosed during the arbitration (whether in documents or orally) may not be used or disclosed except in connection with the arbitration or a proceeding to enforce the arbitration award and that any permitted court filing of confidential information must be done under seal to the furthest extent permitted by law. (6) Offer of Settlement: In any arbitration between you and Ziff Davis, the defending party may, but is not obligated to, make a written settlement offer at any time before the evidentiary hearing or, if a dispositive motion is permitted, prior to the dispositive motion being granted. The amount or terms of any settlement offer may not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator issues an award on the claim. If the award is issued in the other party\u2019s favor and is less than the defending party\u2019s settlement offer or if the award is in the defending party\u2019s favor, the other party must pay the defending party\u2019s costs incurred after the offer was made, including any attorney\u2019s fees. If any applicable statute or case law prohibits the shifting of costs incurred in the arbitration, then the offer in this provision shall serve to cease the accumulation of any costs to which the party bringing the claim may be entitled for the cause of action under which it is suing. (7) Requirement of Individualized Relief: The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\u2019s individual claim. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU AND WE AGREE THAT EACH PARTY MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR OUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\u2019s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative, class, or private attorney general proceeding. If, after exhaustion of all appeals, any of these prohibitions on non-individualized declaratory or injunctive relief; class, representative, and private attorney general claims; and consolidation are found to be unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or with respect to a particular request for relief (such as a request for injunctive relief sought with respect to a particular claim), then the parties agree such a claim or request for relief shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction, after all other arbitrable claims and requests for relief are arbitrated. You agree that any arbitrations between you and Ziff Davis will be subject to this Section 13 and not to any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, and, notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you agree that this Section 13 amends any prior arbitration agreement you had with Ziff Davis, including with respect to claims that arose before this or any prior arbitration agreement. (8) Opt Out of Future Changes: Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, if Ziff Davis makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending Ziff Davis an email to dispute.notice@ziffdavis.com within 30 days of the posting of the amended arbitration agreement that provides: (i) your full legal name, (ii) your complete mailing address, (iii) your phone number, (iv) if applicable, the username or email address associated with any potential account or newsletter; (v) the relevant Site; and (vi) the approximate date of your initial use of the relevant Site. Such an opt-out email must be sent by you personally, and not by your agent, attorney, or anyone else purporting to act on your behalf. It must include a statement, personally signed by you, that you wish to reject the change to the Arbitration Agreement. This is not an opt out of arbitration altogether. (9) Mass Filing: If, at any time, 25 or more claimants (including you) submit Notices or seek to file demands for arbitration raising similar claims against the other party or related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities, consistent with the definition and criteria of Mass Filings (\u201cMass Filing\u201d) set forth in NAM\u2019s Mass Filing Supplemental Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures (\u201cNAM\u2019s Mass Filing Rules,\u201d available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/), you and we agree that the additional procedures set forth below shall apply. The parties agree that throughout this process, their counsel shall meet and confer to discuss modifications to these procedures based on the particular needs of the Mass Filing. The parties acknowledge and agree that by electing to participate in a Mass Filing, the adjudication of their dispute might be delayed. Any applicable limitations period (including statute of limitations) and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled beginning when the Mandatory Pre-Arbitration Notice and Informal Dispute Resolution Procedures are initiated, so long as the pre-arbitration Notice complies with the requirements in Section 13(2), until your claim is selected to proceed as part of a staged process or is settled, withdrawn, otherwise resolved, or opted out of arbitration. Stage One: Counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 25 claims per side (50 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this initial set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Two: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 50 claims per side (100 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a second staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Each of these individual arbitrations shall be assigned to a different, single arbitrator unless the parties agree otherwise in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After this second set of staged proceedings is completed, the parties shall promptly engage in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge and Ziff Davis shall pay the mediator\u2019s fee. Stage Three: If the remaining claims are not resolved at this time, counsel for the claimants and counsel for Ziff Davis shall each select 100 claims per side (200 claims total) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a third staged process, subject to any procedural changes the parties agreed to in writing. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. Following this third set of staged proceedings, counsel for claimants may elect to have the parties participate in a global mediation session of all remaining claims with a retired federal or state court judge. Stage Four: If your claim is not resolved at this time, then you agree that your claim will be resolved as part of continuing, staged individual arbitration proceedings as set forth below. Assuming the number of remaining claims exceeds 100, then 100 claims shall be randomly selected (or selected through a process agreed to by counsel for the parties) to be filed and to proceed in individual arbitrations as part of a staged process. If the number of remaining claims is fewer than 100, then all of those claims shall be filed and proceed in individual arbitrations. Any remaining claims shall not be filed or be deemed filed in arbitration, nor shall any arbitration fees be assessed in connection with those claims unless and until they are selected to be filed in individual arbitration proceedings as part of a staged process. After each set of 100 claims are adjudicated, settled, withdrawn, or otherwise resolved, this process shall repeat consistent with these parameters. Counsel for the parties are encouraged to meet and confer, participate in mediation, and engage with each other and with NAM (including through a Procedural Arbitrator) to explore ways to streamline the adjudication of claims, increase the number of claims to proceed at any given time, promote efficiencies, conserve resources, and resolve the remaining claims. A court of competent jurisdiction shall have the authority to enforce these Mass Filing provisions and, if necessary, to enjoin the mass filing, prosecution, or administration of arbitrations and the assessment of arbitration fees. If these additional procedures apply to your claim, and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that they are not enforceable as to your claim, then your claim shall proceed in a court of competent jurisdiction consistent with this Agreement. You and Ziff Davis agree that we each value the integrity and efficiency of arbitration and wish to employ the process for the fair resolution of genuine and sincere disputes between us. You and Ziff Davis acknowledge and agree to act in good faith to ensure the processes set forth herein are followed. The parties further agree that application of these Mass Filing procedures have been reasonably designed to result in an efficient and fair adjudication of such cases.(10) Severability: If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable, then that portion shall be deemed to be severable and, if possible, superseded by a valid, enforceable provision, or portion thereof, that matches the intent of the original provision, or portion thereof, as closely as possible. The remainder of this Arbitration Agreement shall continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms contained herein. 15. CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER You and Ziff Davis agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each party may bring claims (whether in court or in arbitration) against the other only in an individual capacity, and not participate as a plaintiff, claimant, or class member in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding. This means that you and Ziff Davis may not bring a claim on behalf of a class or group and may not bring a claim on behalf of any other person unless doing so as a parent, guardian, or ward of a minor or in another similar capacity for an individual who cannot otherwise bring their own individual claim. This also means that you and Ziff Davis may not participate in any class, collective, consolidated, private attorney general, or representative proceeding brought by any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you or Ziff Davis may participate in a class-wide settlement. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you and Ziff Davis waive any right to a jury trial. 16. Limitation Period for Claims You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to use of our sites or the Agreement must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. 17. Miscellaneous We may be required by international, state or federal law to notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our sites or delivering them to you through e-mail. Subject to the arbitration provision above and for all purposes of this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without reference to principles of choice of law. You and Ziff Davis each irrevocably consent to the personal jurisdiction of the federal or state courts located in New York, New York, the Borough of Manhattan (the \u201cCourts\u201d) with respect to any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement or to the Services (including without limitation any Content) and waive any objection to venue in any of the Courts for such an action, suit or proceeding (whether based on forum non conveniens or otherwise); additionally, you agree that you will not bring any such action, suit or proceeding in any court other than the Courts. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all previous written or oral agreements between the parties with respect to such subject matter. If any inconsistency exists between the terms of this Agreement and any additional terms and conditions posted on the Services, such terms shall be interpreted as to eliminate any inconsistency, if possible, and otherwise, the additional terms and conditions shall control. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) such provision shall be interpreted in such a manner as to preserve, to the maximum extent possible, the intent of the parties, (ii) the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, and (iii) such decision shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision under other circumstances. Ziff Davis\u2019 failure to enforce any term of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision. No waiver shall be binding unless in writing and signed by Ziff Davis, and such waiver shall not be construed as Ziff Davis\u2019 waiver of any other or subsequent breach. 18. New Jersey Residents If, and to the extent that New Jersey law applies, with respect to residents of New Jersey, the terms in Sections 6 (insofar as any claims may arise from, or relate to, consumer protection or fraud and/or misrepresentation, or result in attorney\u2019s fees), 9 and 14 do not limit any rights you may have as a consumer under New Jersey law and are intended to be only as broad and inclusive as permitted by the laws of the state of your residence. Subject to the foregoing, Ziff Davis, third party content providers, and their respective agents reserve all rights, defenses, and permissible limitations under New Jersey law. Nothing in this Section shall modify the binding arbitration clause and waiver for class action and jury trial in Section 13. 19. Australia Residents Nothing in these Terms (including in Sections 6, 9 and 15) limits, excludes or modifies any rights you may have under any law, including under the Australian Consumer Law (the \u201cACL\u201d) and consumer guarantees under the ACL, which may not be limited, excluded or modified by agreement (including where such exclusion, restriction or modification would be illegal or void under such law). 20. Privacy Policy The applicable privacy policy will be made available on the property from which you accessed these Terms. Such privacy policy is incorporated by reference into these Terms.

      "text": "Amazon's Labor Day sale is live with deals on headphones, tablets, and more\nWhether you're ready or not for the pumpkin spice onslaught, Labor Day has arrived \u2014 and so have the sales. It's easy to get sale fatigue, but Amazon's Labor Day event is worth paying attention to. We're seeing some items drop to prices that are even cheaper than they were during Prime Day (including tons of iPads and headphones), making this a genuinely good time to shop.\nTo help you sort through the deals, we've rounded up the best ones you can get at Amazon right now.\nBest Echo device deal\nWhy we like it\nThe Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen, 2023 release) is a great pick if you're looking for a smart display, and it's currently on sale for $64.99. That's a $25 savings off the regular $89.99 price. While this isn't an all-time low (it dropped to $59.99 during last year's sale), it's a solid discount. The price may dip another $5 as Labor Day gets closer, but we don't expect it to get much lower.\nFor that price, you get a 5.5-inch display that's perfect for following recipes, making video calls, or streaming TV shows. It's Alexa-enabled for hands-free voice commands, and the built-in camera lets you check in on your home or view a compatible video doorbell feed when you're away.\nMore Echo deals\nAmazon Echo Auto \u2014 $19.99\n$54.99(save $12)Amazon Echo Buds \u2014 $24.99\n$49.99(save $25)Amazon Echo Pop \u2014 $27.99\n$39.99(save $12)Amazon Echo Pop Kids \u2014 $28.99\n$49.99(save $21)Amazon Echo Dot Kids \u2014 $38.99\n$59.99(save $21)Amazon Echo Buds with ANC \u2014 $44.99\n$119.99(save $75)Amazon Echo Spot Alarm Clock \u2014 $64.99\n$79.99(save $15)Amazon Echo Show 5 Kids \u2014 $65.99\n$99.99(save $34)Amazon Echo Hub \u2014 $129.99\n$179.99(save $50)\nBest iPad deal\nWhy we like it\nIf you'd rather have a screen you can carry with you, the Apple iPad 11-inch (A16, 128GB) is on sale for $299, down from its regular price of $349. That's a $50 savings on a top-notch tablet. While this isn't the lowest price we've ever seen \u2014 it dropped a bit lower on Prime Day \u2014 it's still a pretty good deal.\nWith an A16 chip and a Liquid Retina display, this model is ideal for students or creatives on the go. It runs on iPadOS and is compatible with the Apple Pencil and Magic Keyboard Folio, so you can multitask like never before.\nMore iPad deals\nApple iPad, 11-inch (A16, WiFi, 256GB) \u2014 $399\n$449(save $50)Apple iPad Air, 11-inch (M3, WiFi, 128GB) \u2014 $449\n$599(save $150)Apple iPad Air, 11-inch (M3, WiFi, 256GB) \u2014 $549\n$699(save $150)Apple iPad Air, 11-inch (M3, WiFi + cellular, 128GB) \u2014 $599\n$749(save $150)Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro, WiFi, 128GB) \u2014 $399\n$499(save $100)Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro, WiFi, 256GB) \u2014 $499\n$599(save $100)Apple iPad mini (A17 Pro, WiFi, 512GB) \u2014 $699\n$799(save $100)\nBest headphones deal\nWhy we like it\nRead Mashable's full review of the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones.\nA perennial favorite, the Sony WH-1000XM5 noise-canceling headphones are on sale for $298, down from $399.99. That's a $101.99 savings and just $2 more than their Prime Day price.\nThese premium headphones are a Mashable Choice Award winner, and our team was even more impressed by them than the newer XM6 model, thanks to their 30-hour battery life, comfortable design, and sound quality.\nMashable\u2019s deputy shopping and reviews editor, Miller Kern, writes, \u201cI was truly impressed by the sound quality and noise cancellation in the Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones. As someone who primarily listens to music through AirPods Pro, the noise cancellation on the Sony headphones is a game-changer. I found myself reaching for these headphones over my AirPods and Sennheiser PXC 550-IIs.\u201d\nMore headphones deals\nAnker Soundcore P30i earbuds \u2014 $28.48\n$49.99(save $21.51)JBL Tune 510BT \u2014 $29.95\n$49.95(save $20)Sony WH-CH520 \u2014 $38\n$69.99(save $31.99)JBL Tune Flex earbuds \u2014 $59.95\n$99.95(save $40)JBL Tune 770NC \u2014 $99.95\n$149.95(save $50)Marshall Major V \u2014 $99\n$159.99(save $60.99)Bose QuietComfort earbuds \u2014 $149\n$179(save $30)Sony WH-1000XM4 \u2014 $198\n$349.99(save $151.99)Beats Studio Pro ANC Headphones \u2014 $199.95\n$349.99(save $150.04)Bose QuietComfort \u2014 $229\n$349(save $120)Sonos Ace \u2014 $299\n$449(save $150)Sennheiser Momentum 4 \u2014 $299.95\n$449.95(save $150)Dyson OnTrac \u2014 $259.99\n$499(save $239.01)Bowers & Wilkins Px8 \u2014 $448.98 $699 (save $250.02)\nApple AirPods Max (USB-C) \u2014 $479\n$549(save $70)\nBest Bluetooth speaker deal\nWhy we like it\nRead Mashable's full review of the Sonos Move 2.\nWe like the Sonos Move 2 more as a home speaker that's easy to move from room to room or a stationary tailgate or camping speaker, as it's a little too hefty to take on a hike or a beach trip. What it lacks in the portability department, however, it more than makes up for with its fantastic stereo sound, 24-hour battery life, and dynamic smart features. Mashable's reviewer Stan Schroeder writes, \"This speaker is one of the best in class, and the quality of sound it produces is reason enough to consider it.\"\nThanks to an impending tariff-related price hike, Sonos products are only going to get pricier. So we recommend saving $100 on the Sonos Move 2 while you can.\nMore Bluetooth speaker deals\nBose SoundLink Flex \u2014 $119.95\n$149(save $29.95)Sonos Roam 2 \u2014 $139\n$179(save $40)Ultimate Ears Megaboom 4 \u2014 $149.99\n$199.99(save $50)Marshall Emberton III \u2014 $149.99\n$179.99(save $30)Sonos Era 100 \u2014 $179\n$199(save $20)Bose SoundLink Revolve+ \u2014 $219\n$299(save $80)Sonos Era 300 \u2014 $359\n$449(save $90)JBL PartyBox Stage 320 \u2014 $499.95\n$599.95(save $100)\nTabitha Britt is a freelance writer and editor.
