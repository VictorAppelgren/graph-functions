  "content": "Senior Army leaders praised the quick actions of several soldiers at the Fort Stewart base in Georgia who subdued an active shooter on Wednesday, possibly saving lives.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important things we were able to do this morning, though, is recognize the heroism of these six soldiers,\u201d Army Secretary Dan Driscoll said from the base Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cOne of the soldiers tackled the person,\u201d he added. \u201cSo think about this, they were unarmed and ran at and tackled an armed person who they knew was actively shooting their buddies, their colleagues, and fellow soldiers. Another soldier jumped on top of the person to subdue them until federal law enforcement was able to arrive.\u201d\n\nThe suspect, identified as Quornelius Radford, allegedly injured five soldiers when he opened fire on the base. The reports of shots fired went out at approximately 10:56 a.m., the base was locked down by 11:04 a.m., and emergency personnel were dispatched at 11:09 a.m. The shooter was apprehended by soldiers and law enforcement by 11:35 a.m.\n\n\u201cOnce the shooter was identified and a threat was identified, we had soldiers that immediately raced and tackled that soldier, wrestled the gun away, and subdued him. A second non-commissioned officer jumped on top to further restrain him until the police could arrive,\u201d said Brig. Gen. John Lubas, commanding general of the 3rd Infantry Division. \u201cNo one hesitated. Most of these soldiers behind me and others in the crowd immediately started applying first-aid and, most importantly, stopped the bleeding. When we spoke to the surgeons in the hospital, it was clear that the actions they took, merely stopping the bleeding before they were loaded up into ambulances, certainly saved lives.\u201d\n\nOf the five injured soldiers, three were released from the hospital on Wednesday. Another \u201cremains as an in-patient\u201d in a facility on the base and could be \u201creleased as early as this weekend,\u201d and the fifth has \u201ca little bit longer of a road to recovery,\u201d and is receiving care at Savannah Memorial Community Hospital.\n\nARMY SERGEANT ARRESTED IN FORT STEWART SHOOTING THAT LEFT FIVE SOLDIERS INJURED\n\nThe shooter will \u201clikely\u201d be transferred to a military facility, said Special Agent in Charge Ryan O\u2019Connor, who leads the Central Field Office of the Department of the Army Criminal Investigation Division.\n\nAn investigation into the shooting is ongoing. Driscoll promised to make the findings public and said they are \u201cconstantly\u201d reviewing security protocols on bases domestically and abroad.",

      "text": "An Army sergeant was arrested after allegedly shooting five of his fellow soldiers at Fort Stewart, an Army base in south Georgia, on Wednesday.\nThe incident caused a lockdown that was later lifted after the suspect, Army Sgt. Quornelius Radford, 28, was apprehended.\nRadford is in custody, and the wounded soldiers were taken to Winn Army Community Hospital for further treatment. Three of the five needed surgical intervention for their wounds, and two have been transported to Memorial Hospital in Savannah, Georgia, for additional care.\nRadford was an automated logistics sergeant assigned to the 2nd Brigade Combat Team and has never been deployed to combat. He is awaiting charges in pretrial confinement.\nThe suspect is alleged to have used a pistol in the shooting that was not military-issued. Brig. Gen. John Lubas said soldiers subdued Radford at the time of the incident.\n\u201cThese soldiers, without a doubt, prevented further casualties,\u201d Lubas said.\nA motive for the shooting is not known, Lubas said. He added that he was confident in the security of the base and that it was unclear how the suspect sneaked his personal pistol into it.\n\u201cI\u2019m very confident in the security of this installation,\u201d Lubas said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great partnership with local law enforcement. As you can see here at our gates, we have armed guards and protective equipment. This was difficult, and we\u2019re going to have to determine how he was able to get a handgun to his place of place of duty.\u201d\nLubas also noted that police arrested Radford locally for a DUI, which was unknown to his chain of command before the shooting. A DUI can place a soldier\u2019s career in jeopardy with the subsequent consequences.\nThe base previously went into lockdown with the initial report of the shooting.\n\u201cLaw enforcement was dispatched for a possible shooting in the 2nd ABCT complex at 10:56 a.m.,\u201d according to a Facebook post by the Fort Stewart Hunter Army Airfield account. \u201cThe shooter was apprehended at 11:35 a.m. The installation was locked down at 11:04 a.m. and Fort Stewart lifted the lockdown of the main cantonment area at 12:10 p.m. 2nd ABCT complex is still locked down.\u201d\nBase officials said earlier that all gates were closed and the commander advised a lockdown. Personnel were directed to \u201cstay inside, close and lock all windows and doors. Keep telephone lines open and report accountability to your leadership.\u201d\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Donald Trump has been briefed on the situation and that the White House is monitoring the incident. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has also been briefed.\nSen. Raphael Warnock (D-GA) said he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d by the news.\n\u201cI\u2019m monitoring the situation closely and join all of Georgia as we pray for the safety of our servicemembers, staff, and their families,\u201d he said.\nGov. Brian Kemp (R-GA) also wrote on social media that he was \u201csaddened by today\u2019s tragedy at Ft. Stewart.\u201d\n\u201cAs we remain in close contact with law enforcement on the ground, Marty, the girls, and I are saddened by today\u2019s tragedy at Ft. Stewart,\u201d Kemp wrote. \u201cWe are keeping the victims, their families, and all those who answer the call to serve in our hearts and prayers, and we ask that Georgians everywhere do the same.\u201d\nShootings on military bases perpetrated by soldiers aren\u2019t unprecedented. In 2009, an Army psychiatrist identifying with radical Islamist beliefs opened fire at Ford Hood in Texas, killing 13 people and injuring 32.\nOFFICIALS SCOUR MOUNTAINOUS AREA OF MONTANA FOR EX-US SOLDIER SUSPECTED OF KILLING 4 IN BAR SHOOTING\nAnother shooting in 2013 saw a military contractor kill 12 people and injure three in Washington\u2019s Navy Yard.\nSoldiers are among the most vulnerable to mental health problems. The Military Times reported earlier this year that diagnoses among active-duty soldiers increased by 40% from 2019 to 2023. Post-traumatic stress disorder accounted for the largest increase in diagnoses."
