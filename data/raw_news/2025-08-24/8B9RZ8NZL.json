  "description": "Billy Joel's daughter Alexa Ray Joel says her father is showing resilience battling brain disorder NPH with lifestyle changes including diet adjustments and regular physical therapy sessions.",
  "content": "Alexa Ray Joel shared an update on her father Billy Joel's health as the legendary singer battles a brain disorder.\n\nBilly, 76, announced that he had been diagnosed with hich affects his vision, hearing and balance -- on social media in May.\n\nThe \"Riverside Way\" singer, who is the daughter of Billy and his ex-wife, supermodel Christie Brinkley, 71, told Fox News Digital that her father has been \"incredibly resilient\" in the face of his health struggles.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I didn't get this characteristic from him because I like to express how I'm feeling always,\" Alexa, 39, said. \"He doesn't whine, especially in his older age.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I don't know, maybe he did more when he was younger, and he put that angst into his music for sure, but he just doesn't complain.\"\n\n\"He's so cool about everything,\" Alexa added. \"He's always playing everything down, 'Oh, I'm fine. Don't worry.' He doesn't want me to worry, and he's just cool as a cat about everything. And I ask him, 'I'm like, how are you feeling? Are you OK?'\"\n\nAlexa, who just released her new single, explained that Billy is fully committed to his health and described how he has made some major lifestyle changes.\n\n\"He's doing his physical therapy three to five days a week, which is really, really important for him right now,\" she said. \"He's adjusted his diet. We had dinner the other night. I said, 'Dad, what are you doing? You're not getting the steak? You're getting chicken instead?' Like, this is a whole new you here.\"\n\n\"He's suddenly eating eggplant and all sorts of vegetables. I said, 'Dad, you used to hate eggplant. He's like, 'Oh, I've learned to love it,'\" Alexa continued with a laugh.\n\n\"So I'm really proud of him and how he sort of adjusted his habits, and he's really at probably his most healthy actually right now in terms of how well he's taking care of himself and prioritizing his health,\" she added. \"Of course, as his eldest daughter, I'm always looking out for him and making sure he stays on the ball with that. So he's doing great.\"\n\nWhen Billy first revealed his NPH diagnosis, the five-time Grammy Award winner said that the condition had been \"exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance.\"\n\nThe statement at the time continued, \"Under his doctor\u2019s instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period. Billy is thankful for the excellent care he is receiving and is fully committed to prioritizing his health.\"\n\nShortly after Billy announced his diagnosis, the \"Piano Man\" singer canceled all of his tour dates for 2025 and through July 2026.\n\nNPH is a condition that happens when cerebrospinal fluid builds up inside the skull and presses on the brain. This condition is most likely to occur in people over age 65. Treating this condition involves surgery to implant a shunt to drain excess fluid from the inside of the skull, according to the .\n\nCommon symptoms of NPH include difficulty walking, urinary incontinence and problems with concentration and memory.\n\nHowever, Alexa told Fox News Digital that she had not noticed any change in Billy's cognitive abilities.\n\n\"It's funny because people were concerned about cognitive decline,\" she said. \"I don't see any of that from him. I really, really don't.\"\n\n\"I was doing a segment for SiriusXM for his channel, the Billy Joel channel on Sirius a couple of weeks ago,\" she said. \"I do a playlist of his songs. I do analysis on it with the backstories. So I interview him. I go straight to the source, my dad, and I ask him about all the material. And I was asking him, single by single, I said, \u2018Well, which album is this from? What year?\u2019\"\n\n\"He remembers every album, the exact year, the order in which the singles were ordered on the album,\" she added. \"So, as far as I'm concerned, he's sharp as a tack. I said, 'Oh my God, dad, I can't believe you remember the year of every single song and what was going on and where you were living.\"\n\n\"And I'm very thankful to have inherited this great memory because I've kind of got a memory like a steel vault. I don't forget anything myself.\"\n\nAlexa also followed in her father's footsteps and embarked on a career in the music industry. She first began composing songs at the age of 15 and debuted her six-song EP \"Sketches\" in August 2006.\n\nThe singer-songwriter has also released a number of singles over the years, and she has previously performed with her father at charitable benefits and political fundraisers. In 2024, Alexa sang alongside her father in the final year of his Madison Square Garden residency.\n\nAlexa recently released her new song \"Riverside Way,\" which is the first single from her upcoming five-song EP.\n\nWhile speaking with Fox News Digital, Alexa explained how she is taking her music and lyrics in a bold new direction with \"Riverside Way.\"\n\n\"It is personal to me because it was my way of saying to the world and saying, as an artist, I'm not just one person,\" she said. \"I think there is a sort of societal penchant and interest in putting women in a box and pinpointing them as, 'OK, she's that type.'\"\n\nAlexa continued, \"She's good or she is bad or she's sugar or she's spice or she's sweet or she's a bitch. We have this interest in pigeonholing women a lot of times. Or even people do it [and] they don't even realize, right? You just form quick judgments based on a picture or based on an interview clip, now with sound bites on social media. It's so easy to form judgments too quickly, I feel.\"\n\n\"And so \u2018Riverside Way\u2019 is personal for me because it's my way of saying, 'Hey, you know, just like most women and particularly artists, there's not just one side to us,'\" she added. \"There is the side of me that's very much the good daughter and loves to perhaps be a little more demure. But then there's another side that's...a bit wilder and more curious and more interested in exploring things. And I think with \u2018Riverside Way,\u2019 I wanted to show, it's OK to get outside your comfort zone and take risks, both with storytelling, narrative wise and stylistically with this song.\"\n\n\"I wanted this image of a girl that's just having a fantasy with a guy and, you know, speeding down the highway in a truck at 200 miles per hour, and they're not even sure where they're going or where they'll end up because they're so immersed in the moment. And so I wanted that escapism to be very vivid. And I am an escapist at heart. I love painting a very vivid picture in my mind. That I can just sort of climb into and crawl into. I get a real thrill from that as an artist.\"\n\nAlexa is the only child shared by Billy and Brinkley, who first met in 1983 while they were both vacationing in St. Barts. They began dating shortly after and the former couple's romance inspired Billy's 1983 hit \"Uptown Girl.\"\n\nBilly and Brinkley married in March 1985 and welcomed Alexa in December of that year. Billy has previously shared that he wrote his 1993 song \"Lullaby (Goodnight, My Angel)\" about his firstborn daughter.\n\nHowever, Billy and Brinkley separated in April 1994 and finalized their divorce that August.\n\nDespite their divorce, Brinkley and Billy remained close. While speaking with Fox News Digital, Alexa reflected on how her parents have maintained a warm and lasting friendship over the years.\n\n\"They both love me so much, too. I mean that's a huge part of it,\" she said. \"And there was a ton of love between them. Dare I say that I think a piece of that is still there. I mean they had a beautiful, beautiful love.\"\n\nBilly and Brinkley's marriage was featured in the new HBO documentary about the music icon's life, \" Billy Joel: And So it Goes. \" Alexa participated in a four-hour sit-down interview for the two-part documentary and also appeared in archival footage, much of which was provided by Brinkley.\n\nDuring her interview with Fox News Digital, Alexa shared that watching moments from her parents' life together was \"truly touching and remarkable to see on camera.\"\n\n\"I think just for people watching it in the documentary, the love was palpable,\" she said. \"And it was a lot of joy. I even thought it was the most uplifting part of the documentary, quite frankly, because they played off each other's differences, too.\"\n\n\"Mom smiling at the camera and dad pretending to say, \u2018Oh, get away.\u2019 They were always putting on skits and doing little schticks together. And having a lot of fun and just having a blast, I don't think, you know, I've never seen either of them as playful since those times.\"\n\n\"It was very emotional for me looking back, going, \u2018Wow, they look so carefree,\u2019\" she added. \"It's just so beautiful to see that. And I think they really opened each other up in that way. You know mom being the California girl who was just so full of life and so vivacious and so full of joy and radiance.\"\n\n\"And my dad was more like the Long Island hooligan, as he calls himself, but you know a genius with a chip on his shoulder,\" Alexa said with a laugh. \"So they kind of complimented each other in that way and their differences. And yet they had a lot in common that they both loved music and creativity and singing and dancing and putting on a show.\"\n\n\"They're both natural entertainers who are just perfect for showbiz in many ways. I know my dad acts like he's not, but he really is, at the end of the day, a genius at what he does. And they were able to find that connection, and then I was able to share that with them.\"\n\nAlexa explained that she would always treasure her memories of growing up with Billy and Brinkley while they were together.\n\n\"We had musicals around the house,\" she recalled. \"It was a very, very joyful childhood. And I think they respect and cherish those memories and those years. And it's sad that it didn't work out, but those memories live on forever.\"\n\n\"I mean, my father sings about it in the \u2018Lullaby,'\" Alexa said, quoting Billy's lyric, \"Will always be a part of me.'\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\n\"It's still a part of you, and it's beautiful to see how those memories live on in the documentary,\" she added.\n\nAlexa also reflected on how her parents' experiences had impacted her views on marriage and relationships.\n\n\"I think I don't have as much of a particularly romanticized or idealized view of marriage, even though I think it's a beautiful thing and I would love to be married,\" she said.\n\n\"I have seen eight divorces growing up, and I've seen the highs and the lows and the in-betweens,\" she continued. \"The good, the bad, and the ugly. So I have a very, what's the word? Discerning view.\"\n\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING? CLICK HERE FOR MORE ENTERTAINMENT NEWS\n\n\"And I'm glad.

      "text": "Following his diagnosis of a brain condition, singer Billy Joel has canceled all scheduled concerts.\nThe five-time Grammy winner, 76, announced on Friday that he has normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), which occurs when cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) builds up inside or around the brain.\n\"This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance,\" the announcement on Joel\u2019s website said.\nBILLY JOEL CANCELS ALL CONCERTS DUE TO BRAIN DISORDER DIAGNOSIS\n\"Under his doctor\u2019s instructions, Billy is undergoing specific physical therapy and has been advised to refrain from performing during this recovery period.\"\nWhat causes normal pressure hydrocephalus?\nHydrocephalus is a general term describing the buildup of excess fluid in the brain.\n\"The fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid, is constantly produced in fluid-filled spaces in the center of the brain called ventricles,\" Matthew Potts, M.D., a Northwestern Medicine neurosurgeon, told Fox News Digital. (He is not involved in Joel's care.)\n\"It flows through the ventricles and then around the surface of the brain and spinal cord, where it is then reabsorbed.\"\nHydrocephalus can happen for a variety of reasons, including infection, trauma to the brain or bleeding within the brain, the doctor said.\n\"This condition has been exacerbated by recent concert performances, leading to problems with hearing, vision and balance.\"\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus is a version of the condition that is typically seen in older people, where the cerebrospinal fluid builds up without increasing the pressure in the brain.\nDespite the fact that pressure remains normal, NPH can impact brain function, particularly the areas of thinking, memory, movement and focus, according to Cleveland Clinic.\nSymptoms of NPH\nThe three main effects of NPH are gait issues, urinary incontinence and cognitive difficulties. Collectively, these symptoms are known as \"Hakim\u2019s triad.\"\nThe cognitive problems can include memory loss, slow thinking and difficulty, according to Mia Kazanjian, M.D., a board-certified radiologist in private practice based in Connecticut.\n\"This can negatively impact someone\u2019s career and personal life, limiting the ability to do activities of daily living like eating, bathing and dressing,\" Kazanjian told Fox News Digital. \"This can also lead to emotional changes, like depression.\"\nUrinary incontinence means loss of bladder control, which can cause discomfort, anxiety and embarrassment, according to the doctor.\n\"This can predispose someone to bladder infection and skin irritation,\" she cautioned.\nMINI-STROKES MAY CAUSE SURPRISING LONG-TERM HEALTH ISSUE, EXPERTS WARN\n\"If someone has to get up in the middle of the night due to this, he or she is more likely to fall. Furthermore, it can lead someone to isolate socially, which can lead to feelings of loneliness.\"\nGait impairment means the person\u2019s steps are unsteady, there is loss of balance, and the feet can stick to the ground, shuffle or freeze, Kazanjian said.\n\"The danger is that someone can fall and sustain trauma with a significant injury,\" she said.\nThe condition can often be mistaken for dementia, but some cases of NPH can be treated and reversed.\nThe only known risk factor for NPH is age, Cleveland Clinic noted, with the average age of onset around 70.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\nOther factors, such as race, gender or ethnicity, do not appear to impact the chances of the condition occurring.\nApproximately 0.2% of people between 70 and 80 will develop NPH, and it affects around 5.9% of those over 80, the above source stated.\nOnly some 0.003% of people under 65 will get the condition.\n\"About 30% of people with NPH also have Alzheimer\u2019s disease or a similar degenerative brain disease,\" Cleveland Clinic states.\nDiagnosis and treatment\nThe condition is diagnosed through a combination of neurological exams, lab tests and diagnostic imaging (MRI or CT scans).\nThe most common treatment for NPH is a surgical procedure called \"shunting,\" in which a device with two tubes, called a shunt, is implanted to regulate the amount of fluid in the brain.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER\n\"One end is placed into a pocket of cerebrospinal fluid, usually in the ventricle in the brain or a pocket of cerebrospinal fluid in the lumbar spine below the spinal cord,\" Potts told Fox News Digital.\n\"The other end goes somewhere else in the body that can reabsorb the fluid, usually in the abdomen.\"\nThe only known risk factor for NPH is age, with the average age of onset around 70.\n\"Shunts are more complex than just a tube \u2014 there is often a valve that regulates how much fluid can flow through it.\"\nSome newer shunts can be programmed to change the rate of fluid flow from outside the body, Potts added.\nFor more Health articles, visit www.foxnews.com/health\nSymptoms typically improve within hours or days of the shunt being implanted. The surgery itself usually entails days or weeks of recovery.\nExperts emphasized that timely treatment is essential to prevent severe or permanent damage to the brain from the pressure caused by the excess fluid."

This condition is most likely in people over 65. It\u2019s often treatable and sometimes even reversible. Treating this condition involves surgery to implant a shunt to drain excess fluid from the inside of your skull.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Policy\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a brain condition that happens when fluid buildup inside or around your brain disrupts your brain function. That can affect several brain-related abilities, including thinking and concentrating, memory, movement and more. The symptoms of NPH look very much like those of dementia, but NPH is sometimes reversible.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\nNPH is most common in people over 65, becoming more and more common the older a person gets. The average age for this condition to start is around age 70.\nIncreasing age is the only factor that makes this condition more likely to happen. The odds of it happening don\u2019t change depending on a person\u2019s ethnicity, race, sex, etc.\nNPH is a relatively uncommon condition but is widely known. It affects about 0.2% of people between the ages 70 and 80, and about 5.9% of people over 80. That means it affects about 8.4 million people over the age 80 worldwide. Experts estimate NPH is very rare in people under 65, only affecting about 0.003% of people in that age group.\nNPH happens because of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) buildup in your brain. CSF is a fluid that provides nutrients to and removes waste products from your brain. Adults typically only have about 5 fluid ounces (150 milliliters) of CSF, less than half the volume of liquid in a standard beverage can. Your body constantly creates, circulates and reabsorbs CSF to keep that amount of fluid constant.\nWhile it might not seem like that much fluid, it still has a big effect. That small amount of CSF surrounds your brain and spinal cord, and your brain actually floats in it. The CSF also cushions your brain and spinal cord from outside forces. When your body can\u2019t circulate or reabsorb CSF correctly, that can cause too much of this fluid to accumulate inside your skull.\nAdvertisement\nWith NPH, this fluid buildup usually happens gradually enough that the pressure inside your skull (intracranial pressure) increases but stays within the normal range (hence the name, \u201cnormal pressure hydrocephalus\u201d). That\u2019s partly because there are fluid-filled spaces inside your brain known as ventricles, which can hold some fluid buildup.\nHowever, if CSF keeps accumulating, the fluid has nowhere else to go. When that happens, your brain starts to compress and give way, causing this condition\u2019s symptoms. If the compression of your brain lasts too long, the pressure can permanently damage or destroy brain tissue.\nThe symptoms of NPH usually start gradually, developing and worsening over three to six months. The three main symptoms of NPH are known as Hakim\u2019s triad. Between 50% and 75% of people with NPH show all three symptoms at the same time. Hakim\u2019s triad includes three types of symptoms (with more information about each symptom type immediately below):\nGait issues are when you have trouble with walking-related movements. This is the most likely of the three symptom types to happen. About 80% to 95% of people with NPH show symptoms of this kind. Some of these symptoms may resemble movement-related symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease, but a key difference is that NPH symptoms typically only affect your legs and feet.\nIf you have NPH, it often causes the following:\nUrinary incontinence is when you lose control of your bladder, causing you to pee (urinate) unintentionally. Early on, this can cause you to need to pee often or to feel an urge to pee that\u2019s unusually strong, difficult to control or both.\nPeople with this symptom may feel embarrassed if they lose bladder control. However, some people don\u2019t seem to notice or feel embarrassed by this. Not feeling embarrassed or bothered may happen because of the third type of symptom in Hakim\u2019s triad, cognitive difficulties.\nAdvertisement\nThe third key symptom type of NPH is cognitive difficulties. This is a symptom that can appear as or cause any of the following:\nThere are two forms of NPH, and they happen at equal rates. The two types are:\nPrimary NPH means it isn\u2019t happening because of another medical condition. Another word for this is \u201cidiopathic,\u201d a term experts use for conditions that happen for unknown reasons. Experts suspect idiopathic NPH can involve one or more age-related issues with how your body makes, circulates and reabsorbs CSF. About half of NPH cases are idiopathic.\nUnder ordinary circumstances, your body makes about 400 to 600 mL of CSF daily. That\u2019s far more than you need, so your body constantly has to reabsorb older CSF to make room for new CSF. If there\u2019s a problem with how CSF circulates or reabsorbs, this fluid can build up because your body is making more than it needs.\nAdvertisement\nThere\u2019s also evidence that NPH might have a connection to degenerative brain conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Lewy body dementia or similar conditions. Researchers are continuing to explore exactly how and why NPH happens and whether or not other conditions can contribute to it. Answers to those questions could eventually help prevent or better treat this condition.\nSecondary NPH happens when another medical condition affects how your body makes, circulates or reabsorbs CSF. Some examples of conditions that can cause secondary NPH include:\nNPH is often tricky to diagnose because this condition shares several symptoms with dementia and similar age-related conditions. It\u2019s also common for NPH to happen at the same time as age-related conditions. About 30% of people with NPH also have Alzheimer\u2019s disease or a similar degenerative brain disease.\nAdvertisement\nA healthcare provider can diagnose NPH using a combination of the following methods:\nDepending on your symptoms, your healthcare provider may recommend other tests. This is usually to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms to NPH. Your provider can tell you more about the tests they recommend and why they think those will help.\nOverall, NPH is usually a treatable condition. The treatment approach varies depending on whether it\u2019s primary/idiopathic or secondary NPH. Unlike most brain-related conditions, treating NPH rarely involves medications. That\u2019s because NPH doesn\u2019t respond to medications (though medications may treat some symptoms related to NPH).\nPrimary/idiopathic NPH is usually treatable. The most common \u2014 and most effective \u2014 treatment for idiopathic NPH is surgery to implant a device called a shunt. A shunt involves two tubes (known as catheters), one for fluid to enter and the other for fluid to flow out of, with a valve between them. If the ventricle fills with too much fluid, the increased pressure pushes fluid into the inflow catheter, opens the valve and allows excess fluid to exit through the outflow catheter.\nSome modern shunt valves are programmable, letting your provider adjust the settings without surgery. They also appear on X-rays, so your provider can see the valve and make sure the settings are correct. Some modern shunts are even MRI-safe, meaning you can still undergo an MRI even if you have one of these valves.\nThe outflow catheter passes through a small hole in your skull (your provider makes this opening during surgery to place the shunt). After the catheter exits your skull, it turns downward, running underneath your skin. The outflow catheter lets fluid drain into your chest or your abdomen.\nIf the tube drains into your abdomen (which is more common), the peritoneum (a membrane that surrounds many of the organs inside your abdomen) can absorb the fluid once it leaves the drain tube. If it drains into your chest, the pleural membrane (which surrounds your lungs) absorbs the CSF.\nSecondary NPH may be curable, but only if it happens because of a curable condition. The treatment for secondary NPH can vary widely depending on the underlying cause. Your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you about the possible treatments and what they recommend.\nThe side effects of treating NPH depend on the treatment. With primary/idiopathic NPH, the most common treatment is surgery to implant a shunt to drain any excess CSF from inside your skull. The possible side effects of that surgery include (but aren\u2019t limited to):\nWith secondary NPH, the potential treatments can vary. Likewise, the side effects and complications can also vary. Because of this, your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you what kind of complications or side effects you can (or should) expect and what you can do about them.\nNPH is a condition that you can\u2019t diagnose or treat on your own. Because of that, you shouldn\u2019t ignore the symptoms or try to care for yourself or someone else who has them.\nNPH shunting tends to help relieve the symptoms of this condition fairly quickly. The odds of this are better when diagnosis and treatment happen sooner.\nMost people will show improvements from shunting within hours or days after the procedure. However, placing a shunt involves major surgery, so most people will also need several days or weeks to recover from the procedure. Many factors can affect the recovery time from the surgery, so your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you about the likely timeline for recovery.\nNPH is unusual among dementia-like conditions because it\u2019s often reversible. However, the chances of reversing this condition are highest with early diagnosis and fast treatment. Delays in diagnosis and treatment make it more likely that the damage to your brain from the pressure will be permanent, severe or both.\nBecause NPH commonly affects your thinking abilities, many people with this condition don\u2019t know they have it. Family, friends and other loved ones may be the ones who notice the symptoms of NPH. That means loved ones can play a key role in the early diagnosis and treatment of NPH.\nNPH is a chronic (long-term) condition. The symptoms also tend to develop slowly over three to six months. However, NPH doesn't go away on its own and will continue to worsen. As it worsens, it eventually causes severe and permanent brain damage.\nWhile NPH usually isn\u2019t deadly on its own, it does cause symptoms that make it harder \u2014 and eventually impossible \u2014 for a person to live independently. It can also contribute to severe complications, such as falls, that can be dangerous or deadly.\nWith treatment, the main symptoms of NPH are likely to improve. With treatment, those three symptoms have the following probabilities of improving:\nThe outlook for NPH can vary widely. The reasons for that include:\nA few factors make a positive NPH outcome more likely, including:\nFactors that make a positive outcome less likely include:\nBecause so many factors can contribute to the outcome, your healthcare provider is the best person to tell you about the likely outcome for you or a loved one with this condition. The information they provide can account for medical history, the severity of symptoms, possible treatments and other important details.\nNPH happens unpredictably, and half of the cases are idiopathic, meaning they happen for unknown reasons. Idiopathic NPH isn\u2019t preventable, and you can\u2019t reduce your risk of it happening.\nHowever, it\u2019s possible to reduce your risk of secondary NPH by avoiding conditions or circumstances that can cause this condition. Some things you can do include:\nIf you have NPH, the most likely treatment you\u2019ll receive is surgery to place a shunt to keep fluid from building up inside your head. If you have a shunt, there are a few things you\u2019ll typically need to do to help avoid any issues:\nYou should see your healthcare provider as recommended. You should also see them if you notice any symptoms of NPH returning or if you experience new symptoms (even ones that don\u2019t seem related).\nYour healthcare provider can tell you about symptoms that indicate possible problems or complications. Some of the symptoms that most likely need quick medical attention include:\nThere may be other signs and symptoms you\u2019ll need to watch for, and your healthcare provider can tell you more about these. They\u2019re also the best ones to answer questions about what you can do to avoid these issues.\nNPH is hydrocephalus that happens slowly and gets worse over time. The term \u201cnormal pressure\u201d means that the pressure inside of your skull (intracranial pressure, or ICP) isn\u2019t unusually or dangerously high. In these circumstances, your ICP levels are more likely to be at the high end of the expected range. This happens slowly, compressing and crowding your brain tissue. The pressure stays relatively normal because your brain has time to give way to the fluid, which eventually causes symptoms.\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a rare condition that most often affects people over age 65. This condition can happen for idiopathic (unknown) reasons or due to another condition, such as an infection like meningitis or an injury to part of your brain. This condition causes dementia-like symptoms, affecting walking, thinking and your ability to control when you pee (urinate).\nMost dementia-like conditions only get worse over time and are difficult to treat and manage. However, NPH is often treatable or even reversible. Chances of reversing the effects of NPH are best with early diagnosis and treatment. Because of this, it\u2019s important not to ignore the symptoms in yourself or a loved one. With prompt care, many people with NPH can recover and regain most \u2014 if not all \u2014 abilities they had before developing this condition.\nHydrocephalus in children can be serious. And you want your child to have the best care. Cleveland Clinic Children\u2019s is here for them \u2014 and you.\nLast reviewed on 10/30/2022.\nLearn more about the Health Library and our editorial process."

      "text": "Christie Brinkley tried everything she could to keep her marriage to Billy Joel alive.\nDuring an interview with Fox News Digital, Brinkley talked about her memoir, \"Uptown Girl,\" a nod to the 1983 hit Joel created about the actress, and what she wrote of her nearly 10-year marriage to the music icon.\nIn the memoir, Brinkley wrote about Joel's drinking problem being the \"other woman\" in their marriage.\n\"To be clear, I never wanted to end things with Billy. I read every self-help book I could find while, together, we went to see a string of psychiatrists, psychologists, and other medical doctors,\" Brinkley wrote in an excerpt obtained by Fox News Digital.\n\"I did everything for our marriage, constantly working to make myself, our home, and everything around us into whatever he could possibly want or hope for. I continually told him how much I loved him, making sure he always felt adored and appreciated, because he was.\n\"But his drinking was bigger than the both of us\u2014booze was the other woman, and it was beginning to seem that, he preferred to be with \u2018her\u2019 rather than with me,\" Brinkley wrote.\n\"But his drinking was bigger than the both of us\u2014booze was the other woman, and it was beginning to seem that, he preferred to be with \u2018her\u2019 rather than with me.\"\nDuring her interview with Fox News Digital, Brinkley shared that Joel met her and his ex-girlfriend, Elle Macpherson, on the same night out. Joel went on to date Macpherson for a brief time before he became serious with Brinkley.\n\"Elle and I met Billy on the same night, and that was the night that I thought I know I want to be friends with this guy forever, but I had other things going on in my life, but I knew I wanted to keep him as a friend. We hit it off immediately. I mean, immediately,\" Brinkley said.\nShe continued, \"And then when he came back into my life and he was so wonderful and I started to see him differently. And so I think it was really great to start out with a friendship and have that friendship evolve into a full-on romantic adventure.\"\nThe title of Brinkley's memoir seems to be a nod to Joel's 1983 \"Uptown Girl,\" which he has admitted to have written for Brinkley.\nIn 2010, Joel finally confirmed that \"Uptown Girl\" was written about Brinkley (she did appear in the music video), although he explained that there was more to the story.\n\"I wasn't even dating Christie when I started writing the song, I was dating Elle [Macpherson],\" Joel shared on \"The Howard Stern Show.\" He remembered a moment when he was surrounded by Brinkley, Macpherson and Whitney Houston while he was working on the song.\n\"That's why I started writing a song called \u2018Uptown Girls\u2019. It was plural. I couldn't believe, you know, the situation I was in,\" he said of having a bevy of beauties near him.\nJoel said when he and Macpherson went their separate ways, the nature of the song changed because of his relationship with Brinkley. \"And then I started dating Christie and rather than it [being] about all these different girls, she became the \u2018Uptown Girl.\u2019 I started writing it about one person.\"\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?

Brinkley told Fox News Digital that it wasn't easy to end her marriage to Joel.\n\"Well, I mean, when you have a child involved, you may get those thoughts, but to walk away isn't easy. And to walk away from Billy was not easy. So it took time, but at a certain point there's one incident too many, and you just have to have a little self-preservation,\" Brinkley said.\nBoth the model and musician have since moved on. In 1994, Brinkley was briefly married to Richard Taubman. She was married to Peter Cook from 1996 to 2008. They have two children together.\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\nJoel married Katie Lee in 2004 only to split in 2009. He is now married to Alexis Roderick.

And so I think if there's a romantic love that comes along as well, it would be wonderful. But I also feel very content and happy with the life that I have right now, and I consider my life to be very full of love,\" Brinkley said.\nBrinkley's \"Uptown Girl\" memoir hits the shelves on April 29."

How does he break his best friend\u2019s heart? But he said she was so powerful to him that it was worth it to him to lose our friendship for it.\"\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\nJoel said that was the end of Attila, and \"that was the end of my relationship with Jon for a while.\"\nHe said Weber left as well, and he began drinking a lot and attempted suicide twice.\n\"I figured that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t want to live anymore,\" Joel said. \"I was just in a lot of pain. It was like why hang out? Tomorrow\u2019s going to be just like today, and today sucks. So, I just thought I\u2019d end it all.\"\nAfter his second attempt at suicide, Small was the one who took Joel to the hospital.\n\"Even though our friendship had blown up, Jon saved my life,\" Joel said.\nSmall said even though Joel never said anything to him about it, \"The practical answer I could give why Billy took it so hard was because he loved me that much and that it killed him to hurt me that much.\"\nLIKE WHAT YOU\u2019RE READING?
