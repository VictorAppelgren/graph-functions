      "summary": "China and Russia signed a new gas pipeline deal that will redirect a portion of Russian gas sales from Europe to China, allowing Gazprom to recoup about 30% of diverted pipeline capacity. The agreement, long debated, comes amid U.S. tariff threats against China for buying Russian oil and India’s commitment to purchase Russian oil as long as it remains economical. The deal signals deepening ties between Xi, Putin, and Modi, potentially undermining U.S. efforts to curb Russian energy influence.",
