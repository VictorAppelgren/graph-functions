      "summary": "The UK’s Secretary of State for Science, Peter Kyle, reportedly discussed with OpenAI the possibility of providing ChatGPT Plus to all UK residents, a move that could cost up to £2 bn and has raised questions about affordability and data use. The conversation follows similar initiatives in the UAE and other countries, and comes amid a broader push by governments to democratise AI tools for education, public services and business. OpenAI has already signed agreements with the UK for API access and a digital wallet project, while competitors like Google offer free premium AI tiers to students and subsidised subscriptions to governments. The debate highlights the tension between expanding AI access and managing the financial, privacy and ethical implications of widespread deployment.",
