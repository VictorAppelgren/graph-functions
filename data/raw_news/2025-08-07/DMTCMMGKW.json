  "description": "\"Dexter: Resurrection,\" starring Michael C. Hall, begins the second half of its inaugural season this week. What time does Episode 6 start streaming and air on cable?",
  "content": "Dexter: Resurrection, starring Michael C. Hall, begins the second half of its inaugural season this week with Episode 6. What time does it start streaming and air on cable?\n\nDexter: Resurrection, of course, continues the story of forensics analyst/vigilante serial killer Dexter Morgan (Hall), which began with the Showtime series Dexter in 2006. Dexter: Resurrection follows the events of the sequel series Dexter: New Blood from 2021 and on occasion refers to the young Dexter (Patrick Morgan) from the prequel series Dexter: Original Sin, which was released in 2024.\n\nIn Dexter: Resurrection, Dexter moves to New York City to locate Harrison (Jack Alcott), who fled from upstate New York in the belief that he killed his father at the conclusion of Dexter: New Blood.\n\nIn addition to Dexter\u2019s attempts to mend his broken relationship with Harrison, Dexter finds himself assuming the identity of Ronald \"Red\" Schmidt/Dark Passenger, an elusive serial killer targeting rideshare drivers in New York City. As Red, Dexter finds himself being invited to macabre gatherings of other serial killers by billionaire philanthropist Leon Prater (Peter Dinklage) and his associate, Charley (Uma Thurman).\n\nPrater has a sick fascination with serial killers, collecting their trophies and even inviting the most notorious of them to gatherings at his mansion. In addition to Dexter, the gatherings include the infamous serial killers Mia LaPierre/Lady Vengeance (Krysten Ritter), Gareth/The Gemini Killer (David Dastmalchian), Lowell/The Tattoo Collector (Neil Patrick Harris) and Al/Rapunzel (Eric Stonestreet).\n\nEpisode 6 of Dexter: Resurrection \u2014 titled Cats and Mouse \u2014 will begin streaming on Paramount+ Premium on Friday, Aug. 8, at 3:01 a.m. ET/12:01 PT. For cable users, Dexter: Resurrection Episode 3 will begin on Showtime on Sunday, August 10 at 8 p.m. ET/PT.\n\nNote: Spoilers from \u201cDexter: Resurrection\u201d Episode 5 are revealed in the next section of this story.\n\nIn the fifth episode of Dexter: Resurrection \u2014 titled Murder Horny \u2014 Dexter\u2019s fascination with Mia continues as a potential romance appears to develop.\n\nHowever, Dexter \u2014 who has already murdered Lowell \u2014 suddenly targets Mia after she divulges that, while she first targeted sexual predators as a serial killer, she simply enjoys murdering anybody for the thrill of it.\n\nAs such, when Mia brings an innocent, unknowing stranger back to her apartment and begins to torture him, Dexter\u2014 witnessing the events unfold from across the street \u2014 calls authorities and Mia is arrested.\n\nMia\u2019s bust also gives Dexter an opportunity to exonerate Harrison as a suspect in the murder of Ryan Foster (Bryan Lillis), a sexual predator whom Harrison killed in Episode 1. So, before Mia brings what looks to be her next victim to her pad, Dexter plants Foster\u2019s watch among Lady Vengeance\u2019s stash of victim trophies, which was recovered by detectives after Mia\u2019s arrest.\n\nThe arrest makes Prater nervous, as he fears he will be exposed by Mia when she\u2019s questioned by authories. To get ahead of the situation Prater orders Charley to visit Mia in custody to advise the serial killer that her predicament will be taken care of soon.\n\nDexter: Resurrection Episode 6 \u2014 Cats and Mouse \u2014 begins streaming on Paramount+ Premium on Friday at 3:01 a.m. ET/12:01 PT and debut on cable\u2019s Showtime on Sunday at 8 p.m. ET/PT.",

      "text": "For Steve Buscemi, Fred Armisen and Luis Guzm\u00e1n, it was only appropriate that The Addams Family-inspired series Wednesday Season 2 felt like a family reunion, given that all the stars were reuniting with director and executive producer Tim Burton.\nSince Guzm\u00e1n brought Gomez Addams to life and Armisen gave spark to Uncle Fester in Wednesday Season 1 in 2022, the wait to reunite with the iconic director wasn\u2019t long for Season 2, at least by Buscemi\u2019s standards.\nAfter all, it\u2019s been more than two decades since Buscemi first collaborated with Burton on Big Fish in his memorable turn as Norther Winslow, one of the fantasical people in the seemingly tall tales told from the memories of Edward Bloom (Albert Finney).\n\u201cThat was just one of the many draws of me wanting to be a part of this season of Wednesday,\u201d Buscemi, sitting alongside Armisen and Luis Guzm\u00e1n, said in a recent Zoom conversation. \u201cThen when you have The Adams Family, an amazing ensemble cast and then throw in Tim Burton, it's just incredible.\u201d\nGuzm\u00e1n said he loves the way Burton collaborates with his performers and is always up for suggestions.\n\u201cFor me, it\u2019s a total collaboration. I like to stick to the page and to the map that\u2019s been laid out, but once in a while, if I have an idea or suggestion, it\u2019s welcomed,\u201d Guzm\u00e1n said of acclaimed filmmaker. \u201cAs an artist, if you can collaborate with these other artists like that and really feel a part of generating these ideas and these moments, it makes me feel great to be a part of it.\u201d\nArmisen said he was happy to bring more of what he did as Uncle Fester from Wednesday Season 1, since the role of the wacky Addams Family member has expanded in Season 2.\n\u201cI think a lot of [what I needed for the character] was already there in Season 1 just because Fester's mannerisms and everything are already set,\u201d Armisen said. \u201cSo, this time going in, Tim was just like, \u2018Let's just do more of this.\u2019 There were more scenes, so I got to do, but basically I stuck to that character the way he was in Season 1.\u201d\nCreated by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, Wednesday Season 2 introduces Buscemi\u2019s Barry Dort, the new principal at Nevermore Academy.\nUnlike Gomez Addams and Uncle Fester, Dort is a new character joining The Addams Family lore, so he said there are advantages in molding the Nevermore principal yet creative challenges to ensure the academy\u2019s alumni-turned-principal didn\u2019t feel out of place.\n\"It was a challenge and also fun because I'm a completely new character. But his position is not new since he's coming in as [Nevermore\u2019s] new principal,\u201d Buscemi recalled. \u201cThe challenge was to come up with a unique character that fit into this world.\n\u201cSo, Tim and I put our heads together and discovered that Dort is enamored with Edgar Allan Poe,\u201d Buscemi added. \"[We thought], 'Let's model his look on that. Once we figured that out, then we were off to the races.\u201d\n\u2018Wednesday\u2019 Season 2 Also Reunited The Stars With Jenna Ortega\nSteve Buscemi, Fred Armisen and Luis Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s work in Wednesday Season 2 didn\u2019t mark the only reunion on set.\nIn addition to Guzm\u00e1n and Armisen reuniting with Jenna Ortega after Season 1, Buscemi got the opportunity to work with Ortega before, when they co-starred in director Taika Waititi\u2019s upcoming sci-fi drama Klara and the Sun, which is expected to come out later this year.\n\u201cFor me, my character is so enamored with Wednesday, and I feel that way about Jenna, so it was nice to put you know my feelings about how I admire Jenna as an actor to put that into Dort,\u201d Buscemi observed. \u201cHe wants Wednesday to like him and respect him, and she pushes against him. I think that he likes that even more, that he\u2019s getting the full Wednesday treatment.\u201d\nGuzm\u00e1n said he admires Ortega\u2019s focus on the character and can\u2019t say enough about the way she brings Wednesday Addams to life.\n\u201cOh, my God, she's a prodigy. She\u2019s so well-focused and carries herself very well. She's a pro,\u201d Guzm\u00e1n enthused. \u201cI have done quite a few scenes and just standing up to her, I\u2019m literally like, \u2018Wow.\u2019 She\u2019s so focused that she plays Wednesday exceedingly, incredibly well and beautifully. It\u2019s just awesome to watch her and be in the same space with her.\nArmisen further illustrated Ortega\u2019s focus by revealing one of her processes on set.\n\u201cShe goes through every one of her lines and really thinks of the logic of every line all the way through,\u201d Armisen said. \u201cSo, I think when she\u2019s doing that, it makes everyone else kind of go, 'Oh yeah, let me rethink what I'm doing.'\u201d\nWednesday Season 2, Part 1 also stars Catherine Zeta-Jones, Emma Myers, Joy Sunday, Hunter Doohan, Billie Piper, Isaac Ordonez, Victor Dorobantu, Georgie Farmer, Moosa Mostafa, Evie Templeton, Owen Painter, Noah B. Taylor and Luyanda Unati Lewis-Nyawo.\nSeason 2, Part 1\u2019s guest stars include Joanna Lumley, Thandiwe Newton, Jamie McShane, Haley Joel Osment, Heather Matarazzo, Joonas Suotamo and Christopher Lloyd.\nThe first four episodes of Wednesday Season 2, Part 1 are new on Netflix, while Part 2, featuring Episodes 5-8, will premiere on the streaming platform on Wednesday, Sept. 3."

      "text": "Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan\u2019s Freakier Friday is looking to end The Fantastic Four: First Steps\u2019 reign at the domestic box office this weekend.\nDisney and Marvel Studios\u2019 superhero tale debuted at No. 1 in its opening weekend with $115.6 million in North American ticket sales from July 25-27 and hung on to the top spot Aug. 1-3 despite a disastrous second weekend.\nThanks to an anemic take of $38.6 million in its second frame, The Fantastic Four dropped a staggering 67% in business from its opening weekend. Now, this coming weekend, it appears that another Disney film, the family-friendly comedy Freakier Friday, will deliver the First Family of Superheroes a knockout punch.\nFreakier Friday is projected by Deadline to earn $30 million in its opening weekend domestically, while The Hollywood Reporter projects the film will open with about $28 million in ticket sales.\nCasting a much wider net, however, is Box Office Pro, which is projecting Freakier Friday will make $35 million to $45 million in its opening weekend.\n\u2018Weapons\u2019 Is Also Taking Aim At \u2018The Fantastic Four\u2019\nFreakier Friday \u2014 the sequel to the 2003 hit Freaky Friday also starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Lindsay Lohan \u2014 isn\u2019t the only newcomer to the domestic box office this weekend.\nWarner Bros. horror thriller Weapons, starring Julia Garner and Josh Brolin, is projected by Box Office Pro to earn $25 million to $35 million domestically, which is more in line with Deadline and THR\u2019s projections for the film at $30 million and $25 million, respectively.\nSo, where does that leave The Fantastic Four First Steps? Box Office Pro is projecting a $15 million to $20 million third-weekend take for the film, and clearly, their projections for its competitors are loftier than Deadline and THR. The latter two, in fact, didn't even mention The Fantastic Four in its conversation as to where it will end up financially in its third frame.\nNo matter where The Fantastic Four ends up by Sunday, exectives at Disney and Marvel will no doubt be doing some soul searching \u2014 if they haven\u2019t already been \u2014 about how the film that was so adored by critics and big with audiences in its opening weekend fell so far so fast.\nOne thing\u2019s for certain: Marvel Studios will be navigating some shaky ground in the coming year and a half trying to figure out how to get the Marvel Cinematic Universe back on course after its third box office disappointment of 2025.\nAfter all, Fantastic Four is the film meant to set up the return of Robert Downey Jr. to the MCU with Avengers: Doomsday, which is currently scheduled for a Dec. 18, 2026, release."

Gough noted that the idea to drop two four-episode chunks in August and September instead of all eight episodes at once was \u201csomething that came from Netflix.\u201d\nFrom a storytelling standpoint, though, Gough and Millar were completely on board with the decision, especially considering the way the duo structures their episodic television work. As such, the duo, like Season 1 of Wednesday, already had a cliffhanger in mind for Episode 4 of Season 2 \u2014 so the idea of creating a break after the episode seemed like a natural fit.\n\u201cWhen we look at these seasons because they\u2019re eight episodes, we always want Episode 4 to have something big and impactful,\u201d Gough explained. \u201cIn Season 1, it was the dance, and then Eugene [Moosa Mostafa] was attacked by the Hyde, and you weren't sure if he lived or died.\u201d\nAnd while Season 2 Episode 4 also has a major cliffhanger, the notion of breaking the season into two parts also inspired Gough and Millar to take a different approach to the story.\n\u201cI think what it allowed us to do \u2014 which is something we wanted to do anyway \u2014 was change up the storytelling mystery,\u201d Gough said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to want a cards down, 'You can't find out till the end of the eighth episode' whodunnit. We wanted it to feel complete in the first four. So, you have that and then it leads into something bigger. As you\u2019ll see in the end, all the cats are out of the bag.\u201d\nIn other words, while there\u2019s a big reveal in store for Wednesday watchers with Part 1, fans will ultimately get that surprise wrapped within another surprise when Season 2, Part 2 wraps up with Episode 8 in September.\n\u201cHopefully, the fact that the whodunnit is revealed in Episode 4 is a surprise in itself,\u201d Millar added. \u201cSo, [our challenge as creators is], \u2018How do you mix things up and not get repetitive?\u2019 I think that\u2019s always a challenge of any season of TV. You don\u2019t want to repeat yourself. You want to have the essence of the show that people love, but also change it up and make sure that it always feels surprising.\u201d\nThe Split Of \u2018Wednesday\u2019 Season 2 Continues A Trend For Netflix\u2019s Biggest Shows\nThe move to split Wednesday into two parts isn\u2019t completely unusual for Netflix, even though most original series produced by the streaming giant premiere all at the same time. There are occasions, however, when the platform spaces out its programming to prolong the rush binge viewers get watching several episodes in one fell swoop.\nFor example, Netflix released Cobra Kai Season 6 into three parts over a prolonged period, where five episodes were released in July of 2024, followed by five more in November of 2024 and the final five in February 2025.\nStranger Things is also stretching out its fifth and final season, but the wait won\u2019t be as long, since Season 5 will debut with four episodes on Nov. 27, followed by three more on Dec. 25 and a single-episode series finale on Dec. 31.\nThe official summary for Wednesday Season 2 reads, \u201cWednesday Addams (Jenna Ortega) returns to prowl the Gothic halls of Nevermore Academy, where fresh foes and woes await. This season, Wednesday must navigate family, friends and old adversaries, propelling her into another year of delightfully dark and kooky mayhem.\n\u201cArmed with her signature razor-sharp wit and deadpan charm, Wednesday is also plunged into a new bone-chilling supernatural mystery.\u201d\nIn additon to Ortega, Wednesday Season 2 stars Steve Buscemi, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Emma Myers, Joy Sunday, Luis Guzm\u00e1n, Hunter Doohan, Billie Piper, Isaac Ordonez, Victor Dorobantu, Georgie Farmer, Moosa Mostafa, Evie Templeton, Owen Painter, Noah B. Taylor and Luyanda Unati Lewis-Nyawo.\nWednesday Season 2, Part 1\u2019s guest stars include Joanna Lumley, Thandiwe Newton, Jamie McShane, Haley Joel Osment, Heather Matarazzo, Joonas Suotamo, Fred Armisen and Christopher Lloyd.\nCreated by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar and directed and executive produced by Tim Burton, Wednesday Season 2, Part 1 debuts on Wednesday on Netflix with Episodes 1-4. Wednesday Season 2 wraps up with Part 2 with the release of Episodes 5-8 on Wednesday, Sept. 3."

      "text": "While horror films often struggle to find an original storyline to stir their audiences into a frenzy, there\u2019s no question that actor-producer David Dastmalchian\u2019s new demonic thriller Late Night with the Devil casts a whole new spell on the genre with its 1970s talk show setting.\nIn short, Dastmalchian told me recently that Late Night with the Devil could be classified in a descriptor as Johnny Carson meets Jerry Springer meets The Exorcist. A filmmaker pal of the actor, however, has a slightly different take.\n\u201cKevin Smith, who is a dear friend of mine, watched the movie and he said that it was Rosemary's Baby meets Network and I took that as such an amazing, brilliant, perfect complement,\u201d Dastmalchian enthused. \u201cI feel for me, [the movie was partly about]\ngrowing up with Jerry Springer and Morton Downey, who, by the way, was another one of these guys that had a late-night show that was so shocking. Then, when you mash that up with the energy of a guy like Johnny Carson, [America-born Australian talk show host] Don Lane and David Letterman, that's the tone that we were aiming for with the film.\u201dOpening in theaters on March 22 before it moves to streaming on Shudder on April 19, Late Night with the Devil is staged as a re-airing of the final live broadcast of the late-night talk show Night Owls with Jack Delroy on Halloween night in 1977. The movie \u2014 written and directed by Australian filmmaker brothers Cameron and Colin Cairnes \u2014 begins with a short documentary-like segment chronicling the rise and eventual fall of Jack Delroy (Dastmalchian) in the TV talker space. Once a fierce competitor of late-night legend Johnny Carson, Delroy\u2019s ratings are on a steep downslide and his standards are slipping, too, as the show becomes more of a sideshow act defined by outrageous guests and stunts.\nIn a bid to regain the success he enjoyed at the beginning of the talk show host\u2019s career, Night Owls with Jack Delroy schedules an All Hallows\u2019 Eve show featuring a psychic (Fayssal Bazzi), a paranormal skeptic (Ian Bliss), a parapsychologist (June Ross-Mitchell) and her patient (Ingrid Torelli) \u2014 a damaged 13-year-old girl who gives every indication that she\u2019s possessed by a demon. Complicating matters is Delroy\u2019s rumored involvement with a mysterious group associated with the occult, as well as his torment over the tragic loss of his wife (Georgina Haig).\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024\n\u2018Late Night With The Devil\u2019 Makes Movie Viewers Part Of \u2018Night Owls\u2019 TV Viewing Audience\nAfter its faux-documentary introduction, Late Night with the Devil plays like a found-footage videotape, making it the only visual record of the horrific final broadcast of Night Owls with Jack Delroy. To enhance the experience, the Cairnes brothers shot the film like a studio crew taping a late-night talk show, but with cameras still rolling between commercial breaks to intensify the supernatural occurrences that are unfolding during the fateful episode. As a result, Late Night with the Devil creates a mind-bending effect since it makes its audience members feel like television viewers at home watching the Night Owls episode in real time.\n\u201cLate-night television had a musicality. It still does, it has a tenor and a tone all of its own,\u201d David Dastmalchian explained. \u201cThe way that Colin and Cameron approached shooting this was, \u2018We\u2019re going to do one episode from beginning to end and we're going to recapture what happened that night, October 31st, 1977.\u2019 So, when people are watching this, I really needed them to feel they were watching that original broadcast \u2014 like they were actually seeing what happened to Jack that night. And for that to feel believable, exciting and captivating, it really had to feel like the real deal.\u201d\nTo prepare for his role, Dastmalchian said he devoured ample amounts of late-night television footage to capture the energy and tone of TV\u2019s most famous hosts. When it came time to step onto a late-night TV set for Late Night with the Devil, however, the Kansas native admitted that he found the idea of emulating a legendary talk show host frightening.\n\u201cI've never been an emcee, I've never been a host and I've never been somebody that is a comedian,\u201d said Dastmalchian, who has played serious roles in such films as Denis Villeneuve\u2019s Dune and Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Dark Knight and Oppenheimer, as well as non-comedic turns in lighter fare including Peyton Reed\u2019s Ant-Man trilogy for Marvel and James Gunn\u2019s The Suicide Squad for DC. \u201cAll of those challenges definitely made this one of the scariest roles I've ever taken on.\u201d\nThankfully, Dastmalchian said, the Cairnes brothers created a late-night television setting that made him feel like he was an experienced TV talker.\n\u201cThey did such an excellent job recreating the spirit of 1977 late-night television with the set design, with the pacing, with the way that the music and the live band worked, with all of the magic that came from the art department and the way the production design worked,\u201d Dastmalchian said. \u201cI really feel they created such a lavish and lush world for me to step into that it made my job so much fun.\u201d\n\u2018Late Night With The Devil\u2019 Continues Dastmalchian\u2019s Fascination With The Horror Genre\nWhile discovering what makes a late-night talk show host tick in Late Night with the Devil, Dastmalchian on the flip side had no trouble adjusting to the film\u2019s horror scenarios. In addition to starring roles in a pair of horror thrillers in the past year including the big-screen adaptation of Stephen King\u2019s The Boogeyman and The Last Voyage of the Demeter \u2014 which chronicles a chapter from Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula \u2014 Dastmalchian is creator and writer of Dark Horse Comics\u2019 Count Crowley: Reluctant Monster Hunter comic book series.\nOn top of that, Late Night with the Devil marks the release of Dastmalchian\u2019s first film under his Good Fiend Films production banner, which gives the actor-producer the ability to tell the stories that excite him in the horror, science fiction and fantasy realm in film, TV, audio and publishing.\n\u201cDave has been a massive fan of horror his entire life,\u201d Dastmalchian\u2019s longtime friend, actor Dana DeLorenzo, told me. \u201cSo, anytime someone gets to perform in the genre that they are fans of most, or make the type of films they seek out to watch as an audience member, that brings the project some extra magic.\u201d\nA fellow horror luminary thanks to her scorching turn as Deadite slayer Kelly Maxwell opposite Bruce Campbell in filmmaker Sam Raimi\u2019s Ash vs. Evil Dead TV series, DeLorenzo said Dastmalchian\u2019s stamp on the genre stems from the charismatic presence he has both off-screen and on.\n\u201cThe magnetism he has on-screen always pulls you in, and he brings an authenticity and intensity to every role he plays,\u201d DeLorenzo observed. \u201cBecause Dave genuinely is a fan of the horror genre, when he gets to stretch that muscle to play these layered, darker and creepier characters \u2014 especially in horror \u2014 you can see how much he enjoys it. That enjoyment, combined with his abilities as an actor, elevates the experience for the audience.\u201d\nIn the case of Late Night with the Devil, that elevation included the levitation of a character who is said to be demonically possessed \u2014 raising some deadly stakes for everyone on the Night Owls with Jack Delroy set.\nDemonic Possession Is A Complex Subject To Confront, Dastmalchian Says\nThe horror sub-genre of demonic possession, of course, most famously rattled audiences en masse with the release of The Exorcist in 1972 and it hasn\u2019t loosened its grip since. David Dastmalchian believes demonic possession movies are engrained in our psyches not just because of traumatic images in The Exorcist, but perhaps because of the struggles everyone deals with in their personal lives and their abilities \u2014 or inabilities, sometimes \u2014 to deal with them.\n\u201cI was somebody raised in an extremely religious environment where the ideas of demons, demonology, evil and possession were very real and were spoken about in a way that was literal,\u201d Dastmalchian recalled. \u201cNow, as I've grown up, my beliefs have definitely shifted and changed, and I don't necessarily ascribe to the beliefs that there are free-floating entities that just happen to take control of people's bodies who are not living pious religious lives or whatever the mythology is there. But I do believe deeply that within each of us, as Walt Whitman said, are \u2018multitudes.\u2019 That is a beautiful thing but that is also a terrifying thing.\u201d\nWith that, Dastmalchian offered up the multitudes that were established within his impressionable mind growing up in Kansas.\n\u201cWithin the multitudes that exist inside of myself, there is the scared 6-year-old that really never got over his fear of certain things. There is the insecure 16-year-old who still never really healed from a bullying incident. There is the heartbroken 21-year-old who still never really fully processed that wound,\u201d the actor explained. \u201cThere are all these different spirits that live inside of ourselves and versions of ourselves, and I think what's scary is the thought that the wrong thing could trigger that one aspect of ourselves that we would then lose control, be unable to regulate ourselves, be unable to stop ourselves from doing the things that we know we shouldn't be doing.\u201d\nAs such, there is much more to the demonically possessed character in Late Night with the Devil than meets the eye, Dastmalchian noted.\n\u201cI think the possession narrative in an extreme way takes that idea and just ramps it up the way good storytelling should, and it scares the crap out of us because I think we all know that lurking within us, there is always something that could definitely harm us or those we love,\u201d Dastmalchian explained. \u201cThat, to me, is really powerful.\u201d"

      "text": "Trey Parker and Matt Stone\u2019s controversial South Park Season 27 Episode 2 taking on Kristi Noem and Immigration and Customs Enforcement is now streaming.\nThe classic Comedy Central satire series kicked off its 27th season on July 23 by skewering President Donald Trump, which prompted a strongly-worded response by the White House. By July 29, it became apparent in a post on the official South Park account on X that ICE was in Parker and Stone\u2019s comedic crosshairs for the second episode in Season 27.\nNote: The remainder of this article features spoilers from the South Park Season 27 Episode 2 episode.\nIn the 20-second clip promoting Episode 2 of South Park Season 27, Mr. Mackay is shown riding in an ICE convoy and pulling up a mask over the bottom half of his face while holding a rifle.\nThen on Tuesday, South Park posted another teaser on X promoting the upcoming episode \u2014 titled Got a Nut \u2014 with a photo of Mr. Mackay in his ICE gear standing next to a South Park version of U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Noem, as well as an image of Cartman with a laptop in his bedroom.\nThe teaser for the Got a Nut episode included a short teaser that said, \u201cWhen Mr. Mackay loses his job, he desperately tries to find a new way to make a living.\u201d You can see the full post below.\nAs promised, in the episode, South Park Elementary counselor Mr. Mackay loses his job after 26 years because of cuts to Department of Education funding and has to join ICE as a result to make his \u201cnut\u201d (aka personal expenses).\nNoem first appears in the episode in an ICE training video shooting puppies, referring to her admission in her book in 2024 about shooting her \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d family dog. Noem pops up again throughout the episode guiding Mackay and his new fellow ICE officers on raids (and shooting more puppies, including one in pop culture who has surged in popularity this summer).\nSouth Park Season 27 Episode 2 \u2014 Got a Nut \u2014 first aired on Comedy Central on Wednesday at 10 p.m. ET/PT. The new episodes then began streaming on Thursday at 6 a.m. ET/3 a.m. PT on Paramount+.\nAlong with mocking ICE, Got a Nut once again went after Trump as well as Vice President V.D. Vance, who serves as the president\u2019s version of a Tattoo-like assistant to Trump\u2019s Mr. Roarke-like character in a spoof of the TV classic Fantasy Island that takes place a Mar-a-lago.\nThe inclusion of Trump wasn\u2019t a huge surprise, considering that the promotional teaser from July 29 included a few seconds of the South Park version of the president rubbing Satan\u2019s leg under a table.\nAnd yes, Satan makes an appearance in the new South Park episode, too. Elsewhere, the photo of Cartman is a reference to his reaction of Clyde\u2019s incendiary new podcast that has a right wing theme that infuriates the perpetual instigator. As a result, Cartman starts his own podcast and becomes a \u201cmaster debater.\"\nFor viewers who don\u2019t have Paramount+, the Paramount Global streaming platform offers an ad-based Paramount+ Essential plan, which is $7.99 per month, as well as an ad-free Paramount+ Premium plan for $12.99 per month.\n\u2018South Park\u2019 Vs. The U.S. Government, Round 2\nSouth Park\u2019s X post to tease Season 27 Episode 2 on Tuesday morning prompted a response by the Department of Homeland Security on X later in the day.\nThe DHS post on X included a screengrab of the ICE convoy from South Park\u2019s teaser video released on July 29, along with a link directing interested parties to apply to join ICE.\nIn turn, the South Park account took a swipe at the post and the White House\u2019s statement about the show not being \u201crelevant\u201d for the past 20 years by replying on X, \u201cWait, so we ARE relevant?\u201d along with the hashtag #eatabagofd---s.\nSouth Park Season 27 Episode 2 \u2014 Got a Nut \u2014 is streaming on Paramount+."
