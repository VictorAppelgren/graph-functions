      "feedback": "This draft already hits a multi‑year, income‑leaning view, but to reach world‑class quality you need a tighter regime map, sharper first‑principles anchors, and explicit catalysts/invalidation signals tied to numeric triggers; edits below (with sources in parentheses): 1) Build a formal, multi‑year regime framework anchored in invariant auto‑industry dynamics (capital intensity, fixed costs, EV cost structure) and macro/tariff sensitivity; specify regimes (Expansion: demand improving, EV profitability on track; Normalization: EV losses persistent but cash flow supported by dividend/credit; Downturn: demand and margins compress sharply) and note transition conditions (e.g., EV unit profitability breakeven margin, EV capex pacing, tariff regime changes) using 22PL3Q360 as the source for current EV losses, margins, and growth rates; 2) State the first‑principles causal chain explicitly: macro demand drives unit volumes; fixed costs and ongoing EV capex determine EBIT margins; EV profitability and cash flow drive ROIC versus WACC, which in turn drives valuation; include explicit links to the 1) Q2 EV segment loss of about $1.3B, 2) adj. operating margin near 4.3%, and 3) ROIC around 10% from 22PL3Q360 (and corroborating color from W2622L6WW); 3) Quantify the base case with explicit horizons: 2–3 years of EV losses, gradual cost cuts; 3–5+ years for potential EV profitability to meaningfully lift FCF, with forward P/E around 10x and dividend ~5% as the current anchor (22PL3Q360; 65UUBU0OR); 4) Specify catalysts and triggers: Q3/Q4 earnings read on EV profitability, progress on Model E burn rate/cash flow, Ford’s capex cadence, tariff/policy developments; 5) Define invalidation signals: sustained EV losses widening beyond a modeled threshold, ROIC falling meaningfully below WACC, or macro demand deteriorating enough to erase cash flow headroom; 6) Strengthen the transmission channels to pricing: show how dividend yield and retail‑driven demand (Robinhood/high yield discourse) anchor multiples even as earnings growth remains limited (65UUBU0OR; 22PL3Q360); 7) Reconcile conflicts with clarity: explicitly acknowledge the bear consensus (EV risk and cyclicality) versus income‑driven appeal (dividend yield, low forward P/E) across sources (22PL3Q360; W2622L6WW; 65UUBU0OR); 8) Tighten format and language to remove redundancy and ensure every factual assertion has a source tag; 9) End with a concise, testable base case, the main risks, what to watch next quarter, and your confidence level, all tied to the cited data points (22PL3Q360; W2622L6WW; 65UUBU0OR). This will elevate the piece from a narrative summary to a rigorously structured, scenario‑tested, first‑principles thesis aligned with the horizon and format constraints.",
