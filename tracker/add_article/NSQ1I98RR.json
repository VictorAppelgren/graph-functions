      "summary": "Scientists from around the world have publicly rebuked a July DOE report that downplayed climate change, arguing it cherry‑picked data and misrepresented scientific consensus. The critique, led by 85 climate experts, highlights errors such as claiming CO₂ benefits agriculture and ignoring ocean warming impacts. The report’s findings are seen as a tool to advance fossil‑fuel interests amid a broader Trump climate rollback agenda. The scientific community’s rapid response underscores the potential policy influence of the DOE review.",
