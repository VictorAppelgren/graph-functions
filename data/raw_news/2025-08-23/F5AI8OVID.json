  "title": "Want to Be More Productive Throughout the Workday? Experts Say to Avoid These 3 Things Before Bed",
  "description": "In the U.S., 39% of adults report they don\u2019t get enough sleep. Experts say to avoid these things before bed for a good night's rest.",
  "content": "When your sleep is disturbed, you wake up feeling groggy instead of refreshed and ready for the day.\n\nHave you ever experienced brain fog after not sleeping well the night before? Next thing you know, you are having a busy workday, and you can\u2019t focus and you feel irritable. Plus, your muscles are tired even though you haven\u2019t exercised. You\u2019re not alone. According to the CDC, around 39 percent of American adults report they don\u2019t get enough sleep, or less than seven hours each day.\n\nThe truth is that your last hour before bed might be the most important hour of your day. A poor sleep routine will sabotage a good night\u2019s sleep and a productive workday. A positive routine, on the other hand, will ensure quality rest and help you wake up refreshed. Here are three things experts agree are guaranteed to reduce the quality of your sleep at night and negatively affective your energy. It might seem relaxing to scroll through your social media accounts before bed. Studies show, however, that the blue light from your phone, computer, or TV can make your brain think it\u2019s daytime. In response, your body will delay the melatonin it needs to rest and enter REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. REM sleep is where the magic happens. This is when your brain naturally \u201ccleans house,\u201d remembering, processing emotions, and becoming creative. Instead of doom scrolling social media, try reading a book, listening to a podcast or soothing music, or doing a little light stretching.\n\nYou might think that alcohol will help you relax and sleep better. In the short term, it might help you fall asleep. However, the moment your body processes the alcohol, your body\u2019s natural sleep cycle is disrupted, especially REM sleep (the most restorative state of rest when you dream). When there is alcohol in your system, your REM sleep is broken. The quality of your sleep is disturbed, which leaves you waking up feeling groggy instead of refreshed. Your body naturally slows down in preparation for sleep. Digestion is a major part of that process. Eating a late-night snack or meal is likely to hinder you from resting well. Processed snacks and high-fat or high-sugar foods are guaranteed to spike and crash your blood sugar, which will wake you up in the middle of the night. Eating a large meal in general makes your digestive system work harder, and at nighttime, your body should be slowing down. This prevents you from relaxing and resting. You should stop eating three hours before bed. If you\u2019re hungry, keep it light\u2014a small snack, some fruit, or a protein-rich yogurt.\n\nGetting high-quality, deep, restorative sleep is the best thing you can do for yourself to have a productive and healthy day. Eliminate these three nighttime mistakes from your sleep routine and your sleep quality will immediately improve. You\u2019ll have the energy, alertness, and positive attitude you need to make your day great.\n\nThe opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.",

But REM sleep has importance far beyond dreaming\u2014from brain development to emotional regulation.\nAlthough some aspects of REM sleep are still being investigated, studies have gradually expanded what we know about this unique sleep stage. Below, we\u2019ll explore what we know about REM sleep, including how much REM sleep we need, why we need it, and how to get more.\nAre You Getting Enough REM Sleep?\nA variety of issues can cause degrade your sleep quality. Answer three questions to understand if it\u2019s a concern you should worry about.\nWhat Is REM Sleep?\nRapid eye movement (REM) sleep is one of four stages of sleep. During REM sleep, many aspects of brain and body activity ramp up, at times almost to the same level as when you\u2019re awake .\nREM sleep was first discovered in the 1950s, when scientists studying sleeping infants noticed distinct periods when their eyes darted quickly from side to side behind closed eyelids. These rapid eye movements earned REM sleep its name.\nOver time, researchers have gathered more and more data about REM sleep, including the fact that it\u2019s the sleep stage with the most active dreaming . REM sleep has also been detected in many mammals and other animals, highlighting its evolutionary importance.\nIn people, sleep labs with specialized equipment allow researchers to see what happens when you\u2019re asleep that makes REM sleep different from the other stages.\nTracking REM Sleep\nAccording to a SleepFoundation.org survey, about half of the people who use a sleep tracker consistently review the amount of REM sleep they get each night.\nWhile consumer sleep trackers can\u2019t perfectly measure sleep stages, they can still help identify trends over time and encourage healthier sleep habits. If your device shows consistently low REM sleep, it may be worth evaluating your sleep routine or talking to your doctor.\nWhat Happens During REM Sleep?\nDuring REM sleep, your eyes move rapidly behind your closed eyelids. This is one of the only visible external signs of REM sleep, but inside the brain and body, a lot more is happening :\n- Your brain activity ramps up, often leading to vivid dreams\n- Most of your muscles become temporarily paralyzed\n- Your pulse and breathing speed up and may become less consistent\nCompared to other stages of sleep, REM sleep involves heightened activity that in many ways resembles wakefulness. That said, you remain asleep, and most of your body loses muscle tone. Although we still don\u2019t know for sure why this happens, many researchers believe this temporary paralysis helps protect us from acting out our dreams.\nWhen Does REM Sleep Occur?\nYou experience your first period of REM sleep about 60 to 90 minutes after falling asleep.\nDuring a full night\u2019s sleep, you cycle through different stages of sleep multiple times. There are four stages, including REM sleep and three stages of non-REM sleep. A full sleep cycle takes about 90 to 120 minutes to complete.\nWith each new cycle, you spend increasing amounts of time in REM sleep, so most of your REM sleep takes place in the second half of the night. Activity levels in your brain and body change during each stage of sleep:\n- Stage 1 (Light Sleep): In stage 1, you\u2019re just dozing off. Your brain and body start to relax, but you can still be easily awoken.\n- Stage 2 (Light Sleep): In stage 2, your body and brain slow down even more. Your heart rate, body temperature, and breathing all decrease, and your muscles relax.\n- Stage 3 (Deep Sleep): During deep sleep, your brain and body slow down the most. In this restorative sleep stage, your body physically repairs itself, boosting your immune system and supporting your bones, muscles, and tissue. It can be difficult to wake you up during stage 3 sleep.\n- Stage 4 (REM Sleep): Your brain activity in this stage is similar to how it is when you\u2019re awake. You experience a loss of most muscle activity, but your eyes move quickly underneath your eyelids.\nAlthough the sleep stages are described numerically, you don\u2019t always progress through them in this exact order. For example, in many sleep cycles, you transition from stage 3 sleep back to stage 2 sleep before beginning a period of REM sleep.\nREM vs. Non-REM Sleep\nREM sleep is one of the most fascinating stages of sleep because it\u2019s so different from the other stages. Traits unique to REM sleep that differentiate it from non-REM sleep include:\n- Brain wave activity that\u2019s more similar to wakefulness than non-REM sleep\n- Temporary paralysis of most muscles compared to relaxed but movable muscles in non-REM sleep\n- Irregular breathing and heart rate instead of the steady, slower breathing and pulse during non-REM sleep\n- Steady movement of the eyes compared to minimal eye movement in non-REM sleep\nWhy Is REM Sleep Important?\nREM sleep is a core part of how sleep works, so spending enough time in the REM stage is an important part of getting a healthy night\u2019s sleep. It also plays a role in many specific aspects of physical and mental health in both the short and long term.\n- Brain Function and Development: While you\u2019re in REM sleep, your brain is on cleanup duty to remove cellular waste . That helps set you up for better brain function and thinking the next day. REM sleep also promotes brain development, which is why researchers think newborns spend most of their sleep time in REM .\n- Dreaming: A majority of your dreams take place during REM sleep, and dreams during REM tend to be more vivid. However, REM is not the only stage in which dreams occur \u2014 that\u2019s actually a common sleep myth.\n- Emotional Processing: Dreaming and the brain activity during REM sleep play a role in how we process emotions. Consistent REM sleep helps with emotional regulation and our response to difficult events , and disrupted REM sleep has been associated with a worse mood and mental health conditions like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) .\n- Memory Consolidation: REM sleep strengthens connections between brain regions, and some studies suggest it sharpens your working memory . During the REM stage, your brain reviews things you\u2019ve learned recently, deciding which items to keep in your memory and which to delete. That said, some memory consolidation also takes place in deep sleep , which reinforces the benefits of a complete night\u2019s sleep.\n- Wakefulness Preparation: By ramping up activity in the body, REM sleep may help us get ready to wake up refreshed. This heightened activity during REM sleep is also believed to help protect the cardiovascular system from a sudden surge in activity upon waking up .\nHow Much REM Sleep Do You Need?\nIn adulthood, most people need about two hours of REM sleep each night. But infants and children need more REM sleep, because their brains are still rapidly developing. For example, newborn babies spend around eight hours in REM sleep each day.\nHow much time you actually spend in REM sleep can vary from night to night. On a night when you\u2019re short of sleep, your total REM time can get cut short. This can trigger your brain to initiate more REM sleep the following night, which is known as a REM rebound . Some research also suggests that REM sleep may increase after learning new information.\nWhat Happens if You Don\u2019t Get Enough REM Sleep?\nBecause REM sleep enables better brain function, memory, and emotional regulation, a lack of REM sleep can cause a range of issues. On top of that, a lack of REM sleep circumvents healthy sleep overall, contributing to sleep deprivation. In the short term, signs of sleep deprivation can include :\n- Difficulty concentrating\n- Excessive daytime sleepiness\n- Forgetfulness or poor memory\n- Irritability or frustration\n- Greater risk of accidents\nOver the long term, insufficient sleep can weaken your immune system and raise your risk of conditions like heart disease, diabetes, depression, and anxiety.\nHow Can You Improve Your REM Sleep?\nIf you want to get more REM sleep, your first step should be to shore up the quantity and quality of your overall sleep. If you\u2019re not getting enough sleep each night, the odds are that you\u2019re spending less time in REM than you need.\nTo avoid this, start by adopting healthy sleep habits that reinforce your sleep hygiene. One important way to do this is to maintain a consistent sleep schedule that budgets enough time for a full seven to nine hours of total sleep. This helps reinforce your body\u2019s internal clock, or circadian rhythm, which is essential in regulating your REM sleep.\nYou also want to avoid too much artificial light at night, whether from overhead lights, lamps, or screens. This isn\u2019t just because it\u2019s easier to fall asleep in a dark room. Too much light at night can disrupt your circadian rhythm and interfere with quality REM sleep .\nOther ways to get better REM sleep are based on eliminating factors that short-circuit normal sleep cycles. Things that can throw off REM sleep include:\n- Excess stress\n- Consumption of alcohol or cannabis at night\n- Taking certain medications, including some sleep aids\nMany sleep disorders, including insomnia and sleep apnea, can prevent you from getting adequate REM sleep. For that reason, it\u2019s important to talk with a doctor if you have ongoing or worsening sleep problems or symptoms of an underlying sleep disorder.\nUsing Sleep Data to Get More REM Sleep\nMany people use sleep-tracker data to make meaningful changes to their nightly routines\u2014and REM sleep is often a key focus. These behavioral changes can lead to deeper, more restorative sleep and longer periods of REM. The graph below highlights some of the most common adjustments people report making based on sleep-tracker insights.\nWhat Sleep Disorders Are Associated With REM Sleep?\nNot everyone has typical patterns of REM sleep. Certain sleep disorders are associated with abnormal REM sleep.\n- REM Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD): Some nights, people with REM Sleep Behavior Disorder don\u2019t experience the expected temporary muscle paralysis when they enter REM sleep. As a result, they may act out their dreams, such as by shouting, punching, kicking, or jerking in their sleep. This can lead to injuries to themselves or their partners. RBD has been found to frequently precede neurodegenerative disease.\n- Narcolepsy: Narcolepsy is a rare condition of extreme daytime sleepiness, and it may also involve temporary losses of muscle control while awake. People with narcolepsy have abnormal REM sleep patterns, including a tendency to quickly enter REM after falling asleep .\n- Nightmare Disorder: A person with nightmare disorder regularly experiences intense and distressing nightmares. These bothersome nightmares arise during periods of REM sleep.\n- Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and Central Sleep Apnea (CSA): Although breathing disruptions from sleep apnea do not occur exclusively during REM sleep, they do affect how much REM sleep you get. People with sleep apnea have fragmented sleep cycles, which can reduce their ability to get adequate and consistent REM sleep.\n- Insomnia: Like sleep apnea, insomnia can cause fragmented and restless sleep. As a result, people with insomnia may struggle to get enough high-quality REM sleep.\n- Insufficient Sleep Syndrome (ISS): ISS is when a person voluntarily cuts their sleep short, such as for work or social activities. Because they don\u2019t get enough total sleep, people with ISS often have reduced REM sleep time.\nWhen Should You Talk to Your Doctor?\nYou should talk to your doctor if you\u2019re having any sleep problems that are severe, long-lasting, or getting worse. If you notice that poor sleep is affecting you when you\u2019re awake, your doctor may be able to help.\nWorking with a doctor can help determine if you have any underlying sleep disorder or if there is another cause of your difficulty sleeping. Based on that, they can help develop a treatment approach to improve your sleep.\nStill have questions?

Learn more.\nIs Eating Before Bed Bad?\n- Eating before bed may stabilize your blood sugar levels and satisfy cravings, helping you fall asleep faster.\n- Risks of eating before bed may outweigh benefits and cause reflux, heartburn, weight gain, and worse sleep.\n- Experts recommended eating up to two hours before bedtime to avoid negative effects.\nIn the past, the idea that eating before bed is bad was a widespread belief. Many thought that late-night meals or snacks could lead to weight gain and related diseases. But newer evidence is showing a more complex picture of nighttime eating. Recent studies suggest that eating a small portion of nutrient-dense foods at night can actually have positive effects on the body.\nEating and sleeping are two essential activities for health and wellbeing. Food gives people the energy they need for daily life, while sleep helps their bodies rest and recover. Knowing how the body handles food at night can help people make informed choices about bedtime snacking.\nBenefits of Eating Before Bed\nFood and sleep have a complex relationship. Our sleep quality can affect what we choose to eat. On the other hand, what we eat, and when we eat, can affect our sleep. Eating at night, therefore, can have varied effects on how fast we fall asleep, the quality of our sleep, and how we feel in the morning.\nAlthough experts do not recommend large meals before bedtime, a light snack can have several benefits. A snack before going to sleep may be necessary to prevent low blood sugar. Certain snacks before bedtime can provide sleep benefits such as falling asleep faster or staying asleep longer . A bedtime snack can also curb a person\u2019s hunger and help them feel satiated until morning.\nIs Your Troubled Sleep a Health Risk?\nA variety of issues can cause problems sleeping. Answer three questions to understand if it\u2019s a concern you should worry about.\nStabilizing Blood Sugar Levels\nPeople with diabetes have to ensure their blood sugar levels are appropriately balanced because the disease excessively raises blood sugar in the body. Diabetes occurs when the body either does not process sugar (type 1 diabetes) or ineffectively processes sugar (type 2 diabetes) to create energy for the body.\nCertain medications that manage diabetes, can lower blood sugar levels too much. Low blood sugar at night can give people nightmares or make them sweat excessively, disrupting their sleep. They may also wake up feeling irritable, confused, or tired. To avoid these problems, eating a carbohydrate-based snack can help raise blood sugar to the correct level.\nIn other cases, health care providers may suggest that people with type 2 diabetes have a snack at night to avoid waking up with blood sugar levels that are too high . The snack could help the body maintain blood sugar balance while asleep and avoid a rush of sugar-producing hormones upon waking.\nFalling Asleep Faster\nSome foods contain elements that may help people fall asleep faster. Experts hypothesize that consuming foods containing high amounts of tryptophan, serotonin, or melatonin can shorten the time it takes to fall asleep and improve overall sleep quality.\nTryptophan, serotonin, and melatonin each play a role in the body related to sleep. Every diet requires foods with the amino acid tryptophan, because the body cannot produce tryptophan on its own. The body then turns tryptophan into serotonin and melatonin. Melatonin signals to the body that it is time to sleep, while serotonin regulates sleep, hunger, and emotions.\nSatisfying Hunger\nHunger is a natural need for food. Common signals of hunger are the feeling of an empty stomach or hunger pangs. Lightheadedness and fatigue can also be signs of hunger. Experts caution against mistaking other feelings for hunger, such as boredom, tiredness, or anxiety. These feelings are not the same as hunger and may be addressed in ways other than eating.\nFor people who get hungry in the evening after dinner, a light snack may be appropriate. Snacks that offer a lot of nutrients but are also low in calories can appease hunger cravings without disrupting or delaying sleep .\nRisks of Eating Before Bed\nHealth experts advise against eating a full or heavy meal near bedtime. Consuming a large meal so close to sleeping can affect digestion and sleep quality. Over time, consuming most of a person\u2019s daily food intake late in the day can also lead to obesity.\nGastroesophageal Reflux, Acid Reflux, and Heartburn\nEating too close to bedtime is related to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), also called acid reflux. GERD occurs when the contents of the stomach return back up the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube responsible for delivering food from the mouth to the stomach. When a person lies down right after eating, the contents of the stomach can press against the lower esophageal sphincter, causing irritation and acid reflux.\nGERD can cause discomfort or pain, such as heartburn. Heartburn is a burning pain in the chest that usually comes up from the stomach. Other common symptoms of GERD include nausea, a sensation of food trapped in the chest, and the taste of stomach acid in the mouth.\nTo reduce the risk of GERD, heartburn, and related symptoms, experts recommend against lying down on the back immediately after eating. Additionally, experts advise people to avoid eating a full meal two to four hours before bedtime.\nPoor Quality Sleep\nEating too much close to bedtime can affect sleep quality. Research shows that eating high-calorie meals with large amounts of fat or carbohydrates less than an hour before bedtime can extend the time it takes to fall asleep. By contrast, eating meals high in carbohydrates at least four hours before bedtime can decrease the time spent awake in bed before sleeping.\nEating right before bed can also make a person wake up in the middle of the night . One study found that participants who ate or drank less than an hour before going to bed were much more likely to wake up after falling asleep than people who consumed something two or more hours before bedtime.\nObesity\nThe relationship between eating near bedtime and obesity is complicated. While research suggests that eating later in the evening can increase the chances of obesity, this may depend significantly on the types of food and portion sizes.\nAn adult should consume a target amount of calories each day, based on their age, activity level, and other individual factors. If a nighttime meal or snack puts a person\u2019s calorie intake over the target amount, they may be at risk for weight gain and obesity. But eating a small nighttime snack that is rich in nutrients can actually be beneficial to a person\u2019s health.\nImportantly, the risk of obesity is influenced by factors beyond food consumption. These include other health conditions, stress, medications, exercise habits, and genetics.\nHow Long Before Bed Should You Stop Eating?\nWhile estimates vary, most experts recommend eating a meal two to four hours before bedtime. People who eat meals well ahead of bedtime have enough time to properly digest their food. Taking time between eating and lying down also reduces the risk of GER symptoms and poor sleep.\nResearch on the best timing for an evening snack is limited. For people managing blood sugar, experts suggest consuming a snack near bedtime. The right timing of a snack may vary among individuals and depend on the food type.\nWhat to Eat Before Bed\nAlthough a full meal is not recommended near bedtime, a light snack may curb hunger in the evening. Researchers have found that some foods may help people sleep.\n- Tart cherry juice: Drinking tart cherry juice in the morning and an hour or two before bedtime may improve sleep length and quality. These effects could be tied to the amount of melatonin, a sleep-inducing hormone, in cherry juice.\n- Kiwi: A small study found that consuming two kiwifruits before bedtime reduced the time it took for participants to fall asleep and increased overall sleep time, thereby improving sleep quality. These effects may be due to the fruit\u2019s natural antioxidants or to its levels of serotonin, which plays a role in deep sleep.\n- Walnuts, almonds, and other nuts: Both walnuts and almonds contain high amounts of melatonin, while pistachios and cashews contain tryptophan. Experts suggest that food containing these substances can improve sleep.\n- Milk and powdered milk: Milk contains both tryptophan and melatonin. A few studies have shown that milk or powdered milk consumption before bedtime may improve sleep quality and insomnia symptoms.\nPeople with diabetes who want to prevent low blood sugar during sleep may also benefit from a nighttime snack. Carbohydrates help raise blood sugar quickly. Nighttime carbohydrate snacks should be easily digestible foods such as apples, bananas, or small cookies. However, the appropriate snack types and amounts vary from person to person, so people with diabetes should consult with their health care providers to make informed decisions.\nWhat to Avoid Before Bed\nSuggested foods to avoid near bedtime include:\n- Spicy foods\n- Foods high in fat, such as fried foods, full-fat dairy products, and fatty meats\n- Acidic foods, such as tomatoes and citrus fruits\n- Caffeine-containing food and drink, including chocolate, coffee, and tea\n- Alcohol\nHealthy Sleep Tips\nIn addition to avoiding large meals near bedtime, take further steps to improve your sleep hygiene.\n- Develop a bedtime routine: In the hour before going to sleep, relax with a quiet activity such as reading or taking a bath. Avoid computer, phone, and TV screens before bedtime, since the blue light in these devices can make it difficult to fall asleep or stay asleep.\n- Create a comfortable sleep environment: An ideal sleep environment is quiet, dark, and cool. Most sleepers find comfort in a room between 65\u00ba to 68\u00ba F.\n- Use the bed for sleep and sex: Avoid other activities in bed such as working or eating. Additionally, if you are unable to fall asleep after about twenty minutes, get out of bed and read or do another quiet activity until you are tired.\n- Exercise regularly: Among the many benefits of regular exercise is an easier time falling asleep and staying asleep. Experts recommend that most adults get a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-level exercise such as walking or biking each week. However, avoid exercising two to three hours before bedtime.\n- Nap strategically: Afternoon naps after 3 p.m. can make falling asleep at night difficult. If rest during the day is necessary, try to limit a nap to only twenty minutes earlier in the day.\nStill have questions?

Learn more.\nAlcohol and Sleep\n- Experts recommend avoiding alcohol at least 3 hours before bed.\n- Consuming alcohol before bed can lead to frequent wakings and overall low-quality sleep.\n- Long-term alcohol use can result in chronic sleep problems and disorders like sleep apnea.\nIf you are one of the nearly two thirds of Americans who drink alcohol, chances are, you\u2019ve had a drink in the hours before bedtime. Maybe you enjoy a glass of beer or wine after dinner, or your weekends include drinking with friends at bars or social events. Maybe sipping a nightcap is part of your bedtime ritual.\nWhile some people find that drinking alcohol helps them fall asleep more easily, alcohol ultimately has a negative impact on sleep. Even in moderate amounts, alcohol consumed in the hours before bedtime can cost you sleep and leave you feeling tired the next day. Based on data from roughly 160,000 Sleep Foundation profiles, nearly 90% of respondents who regularly consume alcohol in the evening have reported at least one sleep-related problem.\nHow Does Alcohol Affect the Sleep Cycle?\nHow much alcohol you drink and when you drink it can both influence sleep. As you consume alcohol, it is rapidly absorbed into your bloodstream, where it remains until your liver is able to metabolize it, typically at a rate of about one drink per hour. If you have alcohol in your bloodstream when you go to sleep, you are likely to experience alterations in sleep architecture\u2014that is, how your body cycles through the four stages of sleep.\nThe typical sleep cycle begins with three non-rapid eye movement (NREM) stages of sleep and ends with rapid eye movement (REM). During sleep, the body cycles through all of these stages every 90 to 120 minutes, with NREM sleep dominating the first part of the night and REM increasing during the second part of the night. Each stage is necessary for sleep to feel refreshing and for vital processes like learning and memory consolidation to occur.\nWhen you go to bed with alcohol in your system, you\u2019re likely to experience more N3 sleep\u2014known as \u201cdeep sleep\u201d\u2014and less REM sleep than usual, at least initially. Later in the night, once your body has metabolized the alcohol, you\u2019re likely to experience a rise in N1 sleep, the lightest stage of sleep. This can lead to frequent wakings and fragmented, low-quality sleep.\nCan Alcohol Disrupt My Sleep?\nIn addition to altering your sleep architecture, alcohol can disrupt your sleep by interfering with contributing to sleep disorders and interfering with circadian rhythms. Alcohol\u2019s effects on sleep can be both acute\u2014that is, immediate\u2014and chronic, affecting heavy drinkers in the long term.\nSnoring and Sleep Apnea\nFor people who snore or who have sleep apnea\u2014a disorder that causes repeated pauses in breathing during sleep\u2014drinking alcohol tends to aggravate symptoms.\nConsuming alcohol causes physiological changes that affect snorers and people with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which occurs when tissues in the nose or throat collapse and temporarily obstruct the airway. For example, alcohol causes tongue and throat muscles to relax. It also causes changes to blood vessels in the nose, leading to greater airway resistance in the nasal passages. These alterations significantly increase the likelihood and duration of breathing events during sleep.\nAlcohol also affects people with central sleep apnea (CSA), which occurs when the brain periodically stops sending certain signals involved in breathing. Alcohol interferes with the brain\u2019s ability to receive chemical messages involved in breathing, which decreases the body\u2019s respiratory drive and increases the likelihood of pauses in breathing.\nPeople with alcohol in their systems are also generally harder to wake, which means that they\u2019re less likely to experience \u201carousals\u201d that help them recover from OSA- and CSA-related pauses in breathing.\nInsomnia\nHeavy alcohol use can contribute to the development of insomnia, a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. As many as three quarters of people with alcohol dependence experience insomnia symptoms when they drink. Insomnia is also very common in people who are in withdrawal or early recovery from alcohol addiction.\nWhile heavy alcohol use can trigger insomnia, the opposite is also true. People with insomnia have an increased risk of developing alcohol use disorder, potentially because many individuals turn to alcohol as a sleep aid.\nFor people with alcohol dependence and insomnia, a destructive pattern can develop: Individuals drink alcohol at bedtime to help them fall asleep, but they end up sleeping poorly for much of the night. To counteract the excessive sleepiness they feel during the day, they rely on caffeine\u2014but this makes it hard to fall asleep at bedtime, and the cycle begins again.\nCircadian Rhythm Disruptions\nAlcohol use and dependence appear to interfere with circadian rhythms\u2014biological patterns that operate on a 24-hour clock. Evidence suggests that consuming alcohol may decrease the body\u2019s sensitivity to cues, like daylight and darkness, which trigger shifts in body temperature and secretion of the sleep hormone melatonin. These fluctuations play a vital role in the sleep-wake cycle, and when they are weakened\u2014or absent\u2014a person may feel alert when they want to sleep and sleepy when they want to be awake.\nWhen Should I Stop Drinking Before Bed?\nExperts recommend that you avoid alcohol for at least three hours before bedtime. That said, some people may benefit from avoiding alcohol for even longer or abstaining altogether. There are many factors that influence how quickly your body can metabolize alcohol and, therefore, the likelihood that alcohol will disrupt your sleep. You may need to stop drinking more than three hours before bedtime if you:\n- Consume multiple drinks over a short period of time\n- Drink alcohol on an empty stomach\n- Are especially sensitive to the effects of alcohol\n- Are sleep deprived\n- Take any medications that intensify the effects of alcohol\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that the sleep problems caused by alcohol consumption can intensify hangover symptoms.\nFrequently Asked Questions About Alcohol\nCan Alcohol Help You Sleep?\nExperts do not recommend using alcohol as a sleep aid. While many people report that alcohol helps them fall asleep, it ultimately compromises sleep quality and quantity by causing sleep disruptions later in the night. Moreover, heavy drinking and alcohol dependence are both associated with difficulty falling asleep.\nIs a Nightcap Before Bed Still Okay?\nWhile drinking alcohol before bedtime may help you feel relaxed and sleepy, enjoying a nightcap puts you at risk of experiencing repeated wakings and low-quality sleep later in the night.\nWill a Small Amount of Alcohol Affect My Sleep?\nThe more alcohol your drink and the closer you drink it to bedtime, the stronger its effects will be. Depending on how your body metabolizes alcohol, consuming a small amount may or may not lead to sleep disruptions.\nStill have questions?
