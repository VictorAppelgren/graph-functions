      "summary": "A court ruling invalidated about 75% of President Trump’s tariffs, creating uncertainty that could delay investment, slow hiring, and push the U.S. economy toward recession. The tariffs remain in effect until October 14 while the administration appeals to the Supreme Court. The uncertainty has weighed on markets, causing stock declines and prompting the Fed to keep rates high to curb inflation. The decision fuels debate over trade policy’s inflationary impact and its broader economic consequences.",
