  "content": "'SEX ATTACK' PROBE Cabbie rapist John Worboys in fresh \u2018seaside sex attack\u2019 probe years after crimes against over 100 women\n\nCABBIE rapist John Worboys is facing a fresh probe over an alleged seaside sex attack just years after committing crimes against more than 100 women.\n\nA new investigation has been launched by detectives over an alleged attack in Blackpool, Lancashire, from when Worboys worked as male stripper over 25 years ago.\n\nWorboys was put behind bars in 2009 after assaulting 12 women in London and is currently serving two life sentences.\n\nNow, Worboys is the subject of a new sex attack probe that the victim alleges took place in the seaside town during the 1990s, say The Mirror.\n\nCops believe that he attacked more than 100 women in London before he was eventually caught.\n\nThis investigation marks the first time the serial rapist has been investigated outside the capital.\n\nA spokesperson for Lancashire Police said: \"We received a report of rape which was reported to have happened in the late 1990s in Blackpool.\n\n\"An investigation was launched, and our enquiries are ongoing. No one has been arrested at this stage.\"\n\nThe Mirror reported that specialist officers visited former friend and stripper, Dave Hanson, to reveal any potential clues.\n\nHanson said that officers visited him at his home in Lancashire over 300 miles about the alleged Blackpool attack.\n\nHe was quizzed by detectives over the new allegations which he says the police are taking \"extremely seriously\".\n\n\"My message to anybody who was attacked by him or knows anything about him, please contact the police,\" he said.\n\nHe added that Worboys was a \"pure monster\" and that he was \"shocked\" over the new claims.\n\nDubbed the \"black cab rapist\", Worboys would attack victims in his hackney carriage in London.\n\nHe would trick women into thinking he was celebrating winning the horses or the lottery in an excuse to offer them alcohol which was laced with drugs.\n\nThe drugs left the women defenceless as he attacked them in the back of the vehicle.\n\nIn 2009, he was convicted of 19 offences and ordered to serve at least eight years in jail for 19 sex attacks on 12 women.\n\nAfter Worboys was charged and a high-profile trial, more women came forward with new allegations dating back further than the police originally thought.\n\nHe was cleared for release by the Parole Board after 10 years without his victims being informed, with officials failing to take into account evidence he had attacked 105 women.\n\nThe High Court overturned this release decision in March 2018 after two victims challenged it.\n\nWorboys was handed two additional life sentences in December 2019 as new victims came forward, with a judge finding he posed an ongoing danger to women.\n\nKnown only as DSD, one victim slammed his six-year minimum term, saying at the time: \"He has destroyed so many lives and I still believe he is capable of doing more harm.\n\n\"I fear for other women if he is ever released.\"\n\nSentencing him in 2019, Justice McGowan said: \"I find you are currently dangerous. I do not know when, if ever, you will cease to be a risk.\"\n\nA 2019 report said Worboys was \"potentially just as dangerous now as at the point of the first sentence.\"",

      "text": "Black cab rapist John Worboys at centre of fresh probe over '1990s sex attack'\nCops in Lancashire confirmed they are investigating a rape allegation in Blackpool dating back to the 1990s when John Worboys was working as a male stripper\nBlack cab rapist John Worboys is the subject of a fresh probe over a rape claim stretching back more than 25 years, the Mirror can reveal.\nDetectives have launched a new investigation concerning an attack said to have happened in Blackpool, Lancashire, when he was working as a stripper. Specialist officers have visited his ex-pal and former fellow performer Dave Hanson to glean vital clues about Worboys' movements at the time.\nThe alleged victim said it took place in the seaside town during the 1990s. Worboys is serving two life sentences after already being jailed in 2009 for assaults on 12 women in London.\nLancashire Police is investigating the new claim - sparking fears his offending was far wider geographically than first feared. A force spokesperson said: \"We received a report of rape which was reported to have happened in the late 1990s in Blackpool. An investigation was launched, and our enquiries are ongoing. No one has been arrested at this stage.\"\nIt is the first time Worboys has been the focus of an investigation outside of London - where police believe his reign of terror saw him attack more than 100 women as he plied them with alcohol laced with sedatives in the back of his taxi.\nAnd it comes as the predatory cabbie, now 68, prepares a fresh bid for freedom after 16 years in jail. Worboys, one of Britain's worst serial sex attackers, could walk free at the end of the year despite his sentencing judge describing the fiend as a \"dangerous\" and a \"continuing risk\". A decision to release Worboys in 2018 was reversed by the Parole Board after widespread public outcry which prompted other victims to come forward.\nMr Hanson said officers travelled from Lancashire to his home 306 miles away in Lowestoft, Suffolk. Mr Hanson said: \"They are taking this extremely seriously. I am sure there are many, many more victims. So far, most victims have been identified in London. But he travelled across the country. I believe he raped hundreds of women.\"\nHe added: \"I had a call from the police in Preston. They wanted to speak to me about a rape from there. They came to my home, two detectives. They said they thought he had committed more rapes. They asked me if I had been with him on a job in Blackpool. That's when they thought he had committed the rape.\n\"But I wasn't [in Blackpool] so I could not help him. But they said they thought he had done more rapes. I gave them the name of the agency I worked with up there once. The rape was unsolved and they were looking at whether he did it.\"\nThe cops made contact over the phone in 2023 but were \"adamant\" they wanted to speak to Mr Hanson in person. He said: \"I had gone public about how I knew Worboys and how closely I had worked with him for many years, so police reached out to me about this rape in Blackpool. They are clearly leaving no stone unturned so they reached out to me. They phoned me and said they needed to speak to be about an unsolved rape in Blackpool and they thought Worboys was responsible.\n\"I was shocked. I'd not thought much about him for a long time so to hear his name again sent shivers down my spine. I always thought there would be more attacks he carried out.\n\"The guy was a monster. He would strike and attack any woman at any given opportunity, in my opinion. I said I could answer the questions from the police on the phone but they were very keen to meet. They said they were treating it very seriously and wanted to come and see me. They travelled a long way and came to my house.\"\nMr Hanson said he told police he had never been in Blackpool at the same time as Worboys. But he provided details of when he had. Mr Hanson said: \"They are taking this extremely seriously. They asked me a lot of questions about everything I knew about Worboys and Blackpool. They were in my house for a while.\n\"I gave them the name of a strippergram agency that provided work for strippers in Blackpool. I can't remember the name of the agency but I gave it to them and I think they were going to make contact with them for more information.\n\"They said a woman had come forward and that they think he has committed more rapes. It really shocked me. I remember thinking that's miles away.\n\"I told them that I had worked with him in London, Basildon and maybe as far as Milton Keynes. But not further than that. When they mentioned Blackpool I had this sickening feeling. That's obviously miles away.\"\nIt was two detectives who visited him at his home and spent around an hour quizzing him. He said: \"They asked a lot of questions. I could tell they were being very thorough. I am glad they are investigating.\n\"My message to anybody who was attacked by him or knows anything about him, please contact the police. I want to make sure he is never released from prison. He has ruined so many lives and should never be allowed the chance for freedom.\n\"He is cunning and will do anything to be released. He will lie and lie and lie. Anything else that can be brought against him should be thoroughly pursued for all it is worth.\"\nMr Hanson said Worboys had previously confided in him that he had given women date-rape drugs, years before a string of attacks he was jailed for became known. He said Worboys even urged him to try drugging women himself with GHB, saying chillingly: \u201cThey won\u2019t even know, they\u2019ll do whatever you want. I\u2019m telling you, it works.\u201d\nHe says the first time Worboys mentioned the date rape drug GHB was in 1998, when both men were booked for a function at the Dorchester Hotel in London, with both male and female strippers. After Worboys became linked and later jailed for more attacks, Mr Hanson said the full realisation of his depravity hit him.\nHe added: \"This is a person with no morals or any sort of human nature. He is a pure monster. He was hiding in plain sight for all of those years. It's a shock to think years later, police are still linking new crimes to him.\"\nWorboys, who is now known as John Radford, stalked London's West End in a cab, giving his victims sedative-laced champagne. He would invent lies about winning the lottery and asked them to help him celebrate his winnings in order to make himself appear interesting, his trial heard.\nWorboys continued offending due to a string of police errors after 10 women reported very similar allegations between 2002 and 2008. In 2009, he was jailed indefinitely, with a minimum of eight years for 19 sex attacks on 12 women. He was cleared for release by the Parole Board after 10 years without his victims being informed. Officials had failed to take into account evidence he had attacked 105 women.\nThe decision was overturned by the High Court in March 2018 after two victims challenged it. Worboys was handed two additional life sentences in December 2019 when new victims came forward, as a judge found he posed an ongoing danger to women.\nKnown only as DSD, one victim blasted the six-year minimum term, saying: \"He has destroyed so many lives and I still believe he is capable of doing more harm. I fear for other women if he is ever released.\"\nSentencing him in 2019, Justice McGowan said: \"I find you are currently dangerous. I do not know when, if ever, you will cease to be a risk.\" A 2019 report said: \"He is potentially just as dangerous now as at the point of the first sentence.\""

The Lancashire inquiry has involved specialist officers questioning former colleague Dave Hanson for clues about Worboys\u2019 movements during the 1990s, and the case underscores concerns that his criminal activity may have been geographically wider than initially believed.",
