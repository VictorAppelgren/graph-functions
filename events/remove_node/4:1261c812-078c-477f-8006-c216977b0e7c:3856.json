    "reason": "The topic \"Lifelong Leadership\" appears to be a generic concept about personal or organizational leadership development rather than a specific macroeconomic indicator, policy, or market driver. Without clear evidence that it influences financial markets, asset pricing, or macroeconomic fundamentals, it does not provide actionable insight for trading or portfolio strategy. Therefore it should be excluded from the IntelOrbis Graph.",
