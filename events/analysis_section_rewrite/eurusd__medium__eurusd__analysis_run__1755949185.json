Avoid generic platitudes; instead, quote exact figures or quotes from the articles.  \n7. **Clarify watch signals**: list concrete indicators (Fed’s “rate‑cut” language, Texas redistricting court decisions, Hegseth’s statements on Greenland/Panama).  \n8. **Add a confidence rating** (e.g., “Moderate (70 %)”) and justify it with the convergence of political, labor, and trade data.  \n9. **Remove redundant or off‑topic content** (e.g., the long Trump interview monologue) and focus on the 3–6‑month horizon.  \n10. **Ensure coherence**: each paragraph should flow logically, with clear transitions and a single causal thread per section. Use bullet points for triggers/invalidations to improve readability.",
