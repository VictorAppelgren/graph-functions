      "feedback": "This draft has solid numeric anchors (EV losses ~$1.3B, adj. margin ~4.3%, ROIC ~10%, forward ~10x, yield ~5%, ~$12B EV capex deferrable) but it becomes world-class only if you prune to Ford and sharpen the house view into a tight, 4–6 sentence brief with explicit catalysts, triggers, and invalidations; the current version strays into multi-asset narration (IntelOrbis Graph, Pacaso, Goodyear) that dilutes decision-usefulness. Actionable edits: (1) cut to Ford-centric content only; delete or relocate non-Ford sections so the brief remains 4–6 sentences or bullets focused on Ford’s regime framework and cash-flow/dividend dynamics. (2) present a crisp house view: Base case as income/low-growth; three-regime map with one-sentence clarity per regime and 1–2 numeric inflection points (e.g., EV margins moving toward breakeven, EV-capex pacing still deferrable, tariff clarity) tied to a single, auditable thesis. (3) articulate a first-principles causal chain: fixed-cost/capex intensity drives EV profitability, which drives cash flow and dividend sustainability, which in turn anchors multiple/valuation—clearly link each step to the cited numbers. (4) quantify every assertion with sources and reconcile any conflicts (e.g., if 10x forward and 5% yield come from 22PL3Q360 vs W2622L6WW, pick one consistent set and cite it throughout); avoid duplicative phrasing. (5) tighten risk/invalidations with concrete thresholds: e.g., if EV losses persist beyond a defined window or if tariff clarity fails to materialize, downgrade to Base; if EV margins approach breakeven ahead of plan and tariff risk abates, upgrade to Transition; (6) craft a precise watch-list with 3–5 items (EV-margin progression, capex pacing, tariff developments, and dividend sustainability metrics) and map each to a near-term trigger and an invalidation condition; (7) ensure all citations are consistent and placed after the relevant statement; (8) maintain executive tone with minimal hedging and no filler, so the piece remains decision-useful for an equity-income-oriented investor.",
