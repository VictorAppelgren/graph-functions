  "title": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated's (NASDAQ:VRTX) Fundamentals Look Pretty Strong: Could The Market Be Wrong About The Stock?",
  "description": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) has had a rough month with its share price down 15%. However, stock prices are...",
  "content": "Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) has had a rough month with its share price down 15%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company\u2019s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. Specifically, we decided to study Vertex Pharmaceuticals' ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors\u2019 money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nWe've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free.\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vertex Pharmaceuticals is:\n\n21% = US$3.6b \u00f7 US$17b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2025).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.21 in profit.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nWhat Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Vertex Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 21% ROE\n\nTo start with, Vertex Pharmaceuticals' ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 19%. As you might expect, the 13% net income decline reported by Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a bit of a surprise. So, there might be some other aspects that could explain this. These include low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.\n\nThat being said, we compared Vertex Pharmaceuticals' performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 23% in the same 5-year period.\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It\u2019s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous.
