      "feedback": "This draft has solid, credible anchors (demographics, cloud/AI productivity, regime/inflation dynamics, and named moats like MSFT/Shopify) but it overreaches the SECTION FOCUS: it’s a long, multi‑section manuscript rather than a concise 4–6 sentence executive brief. Actionable edits: condense to a single house view (4–6 sentences or bullets) with a crisp causal chain (aging → long‑term care pressures → durable cash flows; cloud/AI productivity → earnings/free cash flow power for moats; inflation/policy → discount rates/pricing power; tariffs → input costs) and a tight near‑term catalysts section. Replace the nested base/bear/bull essays with 1) base-case thesis, 2) 2–3 catalysts with explicit source anchors (e.g., Regime A/inflation, AI capex, tariff stance), 3) 2–3 risks with concrete thresholds, 4) a compact watchlist of actionable signals and invalidation triggers, and 5) a one‑line quantitative anchor (e.g., LTC reserve framework: “six figures per year; ~$500k for a couple/single,” 2025 401(k) cap of $23,500 with $1,000 catch‑up, SWR 3.7%). Strengthen first‑principles grounding by tying each claim to a single causal arrow and citing the exact source ID next to it (e.g., MSFT Azure +39% and Shopify GMV/scale to GX057ADL7; 2.5 mb/d oil supply/J99EM2TPZ; 1–1.5% range GDP uplift from UPV3X2MQ6; 21% Pacaso growth, FOM34PUWA; 97% UAS jobs, V8TEZOR8R; tariff/truce RHXDOHQQX; Medicare/HeartSciences AI‑ECG ILY C1M41F). Trim or relocate less directly relevant items (BeeStation, UAS, Pacaso longer‑range examples) so every element reinforces the core thesis. Finally, tighten the diction and remove repetition to meet a decision‑useful, executive tone; specify explicit invalidation cues (e.g., core CPI surprise, 10‑year yield breach of mid‑4%, tariff renewal, or Medicare/AI‑ECG milestones) so the brief has actionable, clearly testable thresholds, with the overall tone that durable cash flows + AI productivity can sustain valuations under Regime A, while Regime B/C or policy shifts alter the path.",
