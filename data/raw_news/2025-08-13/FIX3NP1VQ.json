  "title": "Mortgage Rates Today, August 13, 2025: 30-Year Rates Drop to 6.66%",
  "description": "Explore current mortgage rates and what they mean for homebuyers.",
  "content": "Today's mortgage rates are influenced by economic and market conditions, as well as personal factors. The rate you\u2019re quoted by a lender might be higher or lower than the national average. Here are some of the items considered when calculating your mortgage rate:\n\u2022 10-year Treasury yield: Current mortgage rates, especially on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, are related to movements in the 10-year Treasury yield.\n\u2022 Mortgage-backed securities: The rate investors earn on mortgage-backed securities also plays a role. Spreads between mortgage-backed securities and Treasury yields, as well as between what lenders offer borrowers and mortgage-backed security rates, impact current mortgage rates.\n\u2022 Investor sentiment: Perceptions about fiscal policy and economic conditions can affect how Treasuries move, as well as how much risk lenders feel comfortable taking on.\n\u2022 Personal credit history: The information in your credit report and your credit score influence your mortgage rate quote.\n\u2022 Income: Lenders look at your income relative to your potential mortgage payment and other debts you have. If it appears you can handle your mortgage payments with relative ease, they feel more comfortable lending you money.\n\u2022 Down payment: Your mortgage rate might be lower if you make a larger down payment; often, the best results are when you put at least 20% down.\n\u2022 Points paid: Mortgage points, also known as discount points, are fees paid upfront as a way to directly reduce your rate and lower your monthly payments. Each point, which represents 1% of your loan amount, can potentially reduce your rate by up to 0.25 percentage points.\n\u2022 Loan term: A 15-year mortgage rate is usually lower than a 30-year rate. By choosing a shorter term, you might be able to get a lower interest rate, but your monthly payment might be higher.\n\nHow to choose the right mortgage for your financial goals\n\nWhen considering a mortgage, review your financial situation and goals. Often, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are chosen because they spread a large payment over a longer period of time, making monthly payments more affordable. Even though the loan costs more overall, it might be more affordable on a day-to-day basis.\n\nIf your main concern is becoming debt-free sooner while paying less interest and you can afford a higher monthly payment, a shorter-term loan might make sense. Let\u2019s say you get a $350,000 loan. Here\u2019s what you might pay with different mortgage terms:\n\u2022 30-year loan (6.97%): Monthly payment of $2,321.51 and total interest amount of $485,744.05\n\u2022 20-year loan (6.74%): Monthly payment of $2,659.19 and total interest amount of $288,206.46\n\u2022 15-year loan (6.20%): Monthly payment of $2,991.45 and total interest amount of $188,461.10\n\u2022 10-year loan (6.16%): Monthly payment of $3,913.90 and total interest amount of $119,667.88\n\nThese scenarios don\u2019t include other costs, like insurance and property taxes, that you might also be subject to. It\u2019s important to consider those costs as well. For example, you might think you can afford the payments on a 20-year or 15-year mortgage, but once you add in other homeownership costs, your budget might feel tight.\n\nDon\u2019t forget other homeownership costs that might impact your monthly budget, including maintenance, repairs, utilities and other expenses that might be higher once you move into a house. When choosing a mortgage, the principal and interest payments aren\u2019t the only considerations.\n\nOne strategy might be to choose a longer loan, but make extra payments to pay down the debt faster and reduce the amount of interest you pay. With this approach, you can choose to pay extra each month, but if you need to cut back due to emergency, you can revert to the required lower monthly payment with a lower risk of not being able to meet the obligation. If you lock into a shorter loan term with a higher payment, you can\u2019t scale back payments later without risking the loss of the home.",
