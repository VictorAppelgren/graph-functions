  "description": "The comment marks the latest show of support Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has made for a congressional redistricting map in the state that could net the GOP five additional seats in the U.S. House.",
  "content": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott will continue pushing for a congressional redistricting map in the state \u201cbeyond\u201d the candidate filing deadlines for the state\u2019s upcoming primary election, doubling down on his open conflict with over 50 of Texas\u2019 Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to block a vote on the map that could add five GOP seats in the U.S. House if it is adopted for the election. Abbott made the comments in an interview with CNN on Monday. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\n\nAbbott told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in an interview Monday the Dec. 8 filing deadline for candidates participating in Texas\u2019 primary election in March will not stop Republicans from redrawing the maps. Election officials have said they cannot move forward with March\u2019s primary election without finalized maps, The Texas Tribune reported, meaning Democrats could continue blocking the vote on the redistricting map in hopes the upcoming election is conducted with the current map instead. However, Abbott appeared steadfast on not allowing the election to hinder the new map, saying if Democrats think they can wait things out until December, \u201cthey\u2019re wrong, I\u2019m going to do this for the next two years, and they're going to have to basically take up residency in Illinois,\u201d one of a few states some of the Democrats have fled to. Abbott has also said he will repeatedly call for new special sessions needed to vote on the new map if he needs to, suggesting to NBC News on Aug. 8 that Democrats will not return to the state until \u201clike 2027 or 2028, because I\u2019m going to call special session after special session after special session with the same agenda items on there.\u201d\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We\u2019re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day\u2019s headlines.

Gavin Newsom has threatened similar redistricting in his state if Texas goes through with its new congressional map, which could more than cancel out the potential five seats Texas may get from its own proposed map. In response, Abbott also told Tapper that Texas could remove 10 Democratic districts if California followed through on its own redistricting.\n\nWhat We Don\u2019t Know\n\nWhen the Democrats will return to Texas. If they only intend to wait out the current special session for the vote on the redistricting map, they will need to stay out of the state until Aug. 20. The Democratic lawmakers like State Rep. Rafael Anch\u00eda have said they are open to returning to vote on other legislation, but will not return to \u201cparticipate in an illegal act of violating the Voting Rights Act.\u201d\n\nRedistricting in Texas has pushed back elections in the past. In 2012, the state\u2019s primary election was delayed several months over disputes on a proposed congressional redistricting. A similar outcome could materialize this year, election officials told The Texas Tribune, expressing concern that a delay could end up in the loss of poll workers and locations already secured for April and March. In the meantime, Abbott and Texas attorney General Ken Paxton have filed petitions with the Texas Supreme Court to have 13 Democratic seats in the Texas House vacated, arguing some of the Democratic lawmakers have demonstrated \u201can intent to relinquish and abandon their offices\u201d by leaving the state. However, the legal processes to vacate the seats could be lengthy and run into hurdles.\n\nTexas Gov. Wants Democrats Who Left State Kicked Out Of Office. Can He Legally Do It?

      "text": "AUSTIN, Texas \u2014 Texas Gov. Greg Abbott vowed to call \u201cspecial session after special session after special session\u201d in response to Democratic lawmakers who have fled the state to block redistricting legislation, saying they\u2019ll have to stay out of Texas for years to prevent it becoming law.\n\u201cWe are in the process as we speak right now of searching for, preparing to arrest Democrats who may be in Texas, may be elsewhere,\u201d Abbott, a Republican, told NBC News in an interview at the governor\u2019s mansion Thursday evening.\n\u201cBut I\u2019ll tell you this also, Democrats act like they\u2019re not going to come back as long as this is an issue,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cThat means they\u2019re not going to come back until like 2027 or 2028, because I\u2019m going to call special session after special session after special session with the same agenda items on there.\u201d\nMore than 50 Democratic lawmakers fled the state earlier this week to block the state House from moving forward with the Republican majority\u2019s proposed congressional map, designed to boost the number of GOP-held seats ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections.\nThe Republican-led state House has approved civil arrest warrants for the missing lawmakers, and Abbott has filed a lawsuit with the state Supreme Court seeking to remove the House Democratic leader from office for \u201can intentional abandonment of his constitutional duty.\u201d\nAbbott said he has not spoken to President Donald Trump about the federal government\u2019s potential role in ending the standoff. Trump said earlier this week that the FBI \u201cmay have to\u201d get involved, though an administration official also told NBC News earlier this week that there were no plans to use federal agents to arrest Texas lawmakers who left the state.\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to disclose though all may or may not be involved,\u201d Abbott said Thursday when asked if the FBI has a legitimate role to play. \u201cAll I can say is we\u2019re going to use every tool that we can to make sure that these runaway Democrats are going to be held accountable.\u201d\nAbbott said a redraw of the state\u2019s congressional map was necessary because \u201cboth the law and facts have changed since we drew the lines back in 2021,\u201d pointing to a federal appeals court last year that ruled that multiple minority groups could not form a coalition to challenge a political map as a racial gerrymander.\nBut Abbott also pointed to the results of the last election as political justification for mid-decade redistricting, instead of waiting until the next national census after 2030.\n\u201cA lot of people who voted Republican, who voted for Donald Trump, were trapped into Democrat districts,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cAnd so when you look at the facts, when you look at the law, there is every reason to go ahead and draw the lines so that we can assure that every voter is going to have the opportunity to vote for their candidate of choice.\u201d\nTrump won 56% of the vote in Texas in 2024. The proposed congressional map could lead to Republicans controlling 30 of the state\u2019s congressional districts \u2014 nearly 80%. Republicans currently control 25 of the state\u2019s 38 congressional districts.\nAbbott rejected the notion that the new map could give Republicans outsized representation, pointing to Illinois, with its 14-3 Democratic congressional delegation, and other states.\n\u201cWhat has surfaced because of Texas doing redistricting is the way that all the blue states in the country have gerrymandered their states. Look at the disproportionate lack of Republican representation in Congress, in California, Illinois, Massachusetts \u2014 which has zero members of Congress who are Republican, New York,\u201d Abbott said.\nSome of those blue-state governors have vowed to retaliate and push their own states to draw new congressional boundaries if Texas does so, although they could face significant hurdles due to the different redistricting processes in their states.\n\u201cThe governor doesn\u2019t have unilateral authority in those states to take action,\u201d Abbott said of that possible retaliation. \u201cThey have committees and commissions and things like that. But the fact is: Look at the map of Illinois. It\u2019s drawn in such a way that they can\u2019t even squeeze out another Republican. It\u2019s a joke.\u201d\nThe ongoing standoff has ground to a halt the special legislative session Abbott called in Texas, also blocking action on other priorities including relief for victims of devastating floods in central Texas last month. Republican state House leaders chose to move forward on the redistricting legislation first, but all bills in the legislature are now on pause without a quorum present.\n\u201cThere\u2019s only one thing that\u2019s denying our ability to get legislation passed. And it\u2019s these Democrats who have fled the state, turned their backs on their fellow constituents,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cAnd those Democrats are going to lose their job in the upcoming election, if they don\u2019t get kicked out before then, because they\u2019re not stepping up helping out their constituents who are in desperate need.\u201d\n\u201cAny aid to their constituents who\u2019ve been harmed by these floods is being delayed and denied by the derelict Democrats,\u201d Abbott said.\nAll of that fed into Abbott\u2019s argument to the state Supreme Court that state Rep. Gene Wu, the House Democratic Caucus chairman, has violated his oath of office and abandoned his seat by fleeing to Illinois.\n\u201cIf quorum breaking is allowed to succeed, then one-third of House Democrats will be able to dictate what the rule of law is for 100% of all Texans,\u201d Abbott said of his lawsuit, adding that he believed the state Supreme Court would agree that Democrats do not have that power.\n\u201cThese Democrats, they\u2019re the antithesis of what a Texan is,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cOh, the going got tough. Let\u2019s not fight, let\u2019s flee. These are quitters. They are cowards, and their cowardice will cause them to get kicked out of office.\u201d\nWu, in a statement Tuesday, responded to Abbott\u2019s lawsuit by saying his \u201cconstitutional duty is to not be a willing participant\u201d in the special session that includes the congressional map redraw.\n\u201cDenying the governor a quorum was not an abandonment of my office; it was a fulfillment of my oath,\u201d Wu said in the statement. \u201cUnable to defend his corrupt agenda on its merits, Greg Abbott now desperately seeks to silence my dissent by removing a duly-elected official from office.\u201d\nRyan Chandler reported from Austin and Bridget Bowman reported from Washington, D.C."

      "text": "Topline\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott wants to oust from office the Democratic leader who fled the state to block Republican's attempt at redistricting \u2014 though it\u2019s unclear if the latest move in the escalating battle over redistricting will actually work.\nKey Facts\nAbbott filed a lawsuit with the state Supreme Court Tuesday that asks the court to declare that state Rep. Gene Wu, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, has forfeited his office by leaving the state.\nWu and more than 50 of his Democratic colleagues left Texas on Sunday in order to block GOP lawmakers from changing the state\u2019s congressional map to more heavily favor Republicans; their absence left the legislature short of the quorum that\u2019s necessary in order to hold votes.\nAbbott argued the Supreme Court should expel Wu because the Democrat abdicated his position by leaving the state and refusing to show up for work, writing, \u201cThis Court should make clear that a legislator who does not wish to perform his duties will be stripped of them.\u201d\nTexas law gives the state Supreme Court power to issue what\u2019s called a \u201cwrit of quo warranto\u201d\u2014Latin for \u201cby what warrant\u201d\u2014against state officials, which is a legal determination over whether the official has the right to hold office.\nPaxton also said he will take legal action against Democratic lawmakers if they don\u2019t return to Texas by Friday, invoking a separate state law that gives attorneys general and district attorneys the power to file \u201cquo warranto\u201d petitions in court if a \u201cpublic officer does an act or allows an act that by law causes a forfeiture of his office.\u201d\nWu has remained defiant\u2014saying in a statement that leaving the state \u201cwas not an abandonment of my office; it was a fulfillment of my oath\u201d\u2014and it\u2019s unclear if Abbott and Paxton\u2019s legal gambit will work, whether for Wu or as a broader effort to expel Democratic lawmakers.\nWhat To Watch For\nAbbott has asked the state Supreme Court to rule on whether Wu has forfeited his office by Thursday at 5 p.m. local time, though Paxton asked justices to hold off on making their decision until Friday, which is Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows\u2019 deadline for Democratic lawmakers to return to the state. Paxton has said he \u201cintends to pursue all available judicial remedies\u201d if Democrats don\u2019t return by Friday, including through the \u201cquo warranto\u201d petition process. It remains to be seen if the attorney general will also take aim at Wu specifically, or if he could file more legal challenges against all of the absent Democrats.\nChief Critic\n\u201cI took an oath to the Constitution, not to a politician\u2019s agenda, and I will not be the one to break that oath,\u201d Wu said in a statement Tuesday responding to Abbott\u2019s lawsuit and allegations that the lawmaker has abdicated his duty as a legislator. \u201cWhen a governor conspires with a disgraced president to ram through a racist gerrymandered map, my constitutional duty is to not be a willing participant \u2026 Unable to defend his corrupt agenda on its merits, Greg Abbott now desperately seeks to silence my dissent by removing a duly-elected official from office.\u201d\nHow Would The Process To Remove Texas Lawmakers Work?\nIt will ultimately be up to the courts to determine whether or not lawmakers can be removed. The legal statute that Abbott invoked in his lawsuit doesn\u2019t specify a legal process for the Supreme Court issuing a writ of quo warranto, and it remains to be seen if justices will draw out the process by asking for a hearing or additional court briefs to be filed. The separate statute giving Paxton and local district attorneys authority to ask courts to remove lawmakers says that if there\u2019s \u201cprobable ground\u201d to challenge a person\u2019s office, local judges will ultimately decide the outcome of those requests. That suggests that any effort to remove lawmakers could take a while to play out, particularly if challenges are filed against multiple lawmakers in different courts. That would leave it up to each individual judge to determine when any rulings could come out, Politico notes, and Paxton told right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson that bringing \u201cquo warranto\u201d challenges won\u2019t result in an \u201cimmediate answer\u201d over whether lawmakers can be removed. \u201cWe\u2019d have to go through the court process, and we\u2019d have to file \u2026 in districts that are not friendly to Republicans,\u201d Paxton told Johnson, noting \u201cevery, every district would be different.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019d have to go sue in every legislator\u2019s home district to try to execute on that idea,\u201d the attorney general said.\nWill The Texas Supreme Court Rule Lawmakers Should Be Expelled?\nIt\u2019s still unclear how the Texas Supreme Court could rule on Abbott\u2019s request to expel Wu. In a 2021 legal opinion, Paxton said lawmakers breaking a quorum could constitute an \u201cabandonment of office\u201d that justifies removing them, but that opinion is non-binding, and Paxton said the issue must ultimately be decided by the courts. The state\u2019s Supreme Court is made up exclusively of Republicans, including multiple justices that Abbott appointed himself. Chief Justice Jimmy Blacklock is also Abbott\u2019s former general counsel, and the governor said when he appointed the justice in 2018 that he \u201cwanted to make sure that the person I appointed was going to make decisions that I know how they are going to decide.\u201d That being said, Blackrock authored a 2021 opinion that said the Texas Constitution \u201cdoes enable quorum breaking by a minority faction,\u201d suggesting Democrats\u2019 actions are lawful\u2014though he also said the Constitution allows lawmakers to impose penalties in order to compel members\u2019 attendance. Legal experts cited by the Texas Tribune argued it\u2019s unlikely that taking action to break a quorum would be considered abdicating a lawmaker\u2019s duty, as Abbott claims. \u201cI am aware of absolutely no authority that says breaking quorum is the same as the intent to abandon a seat,\u201d University of Missouri constitutional law expert Charles \u201cRocky\u201d Rhodes told the Tribune, arguing that would be \u201cinconsistent with the very text of the Texas Constitution.\u201d\nHow Long Will Texas Democrats Stay Out Of State?\nDemocrats left the state in order to halt a special session of the legislature that\u2019s slated to end in late August. They would have to stay out of state for even longer in order to actually block the redistricting process, however, as Abbott could simply call a new special session whenever they return. Lawmakers would have to stay out of Texas until at least November to successfully stop the new maps, Rice University political science professor Mark P. Jones told the Texas Tribune. That\u2019s when filing opens for the 2026 midterms, meaning new congressional districts would have to be set by that point. It\u2019s unclear if Democrats will successfully be able to stay out of state for that long, given lawmakers\u2019 commitments at home and a $500 fine that accrues per lawmaker for each day they remain out of state.\nKey Background\nTexas Democrats\u2019 decision to leave the state in order to block redistricting comes as the issue of changing states\u2019 congressional maps outside the normal 10-year timeframe has become a national issue ahead of the 2026 midterms. Democrats are historically favored to fare better in the midterms as the minority party, prompting Republicans in states like Texas to try and manipulate congressional districts to their advantage and add GOP-leaning seats. In addition to Texas, Republican officials in states such as Missouri, Florida and Indiana have at least floated the idea of redistricting\u2014prompting Democrats in states like California, New York and Maryland to also consider redrawing their maps in order to balance out any advantage Republicans give themselves. Texas has become the first flashpoint in the redistricting debate, with Democrats leaving the state Sunday afternoon\u2014repeating a playbook that Texas Democrats have used before to stymie the legislature, most recently in 2021. Abbott\u2019s lawsuit Tuesday came after the governor previously threatened over the weekend to take legal action against the lawmakers. The Texas House has separately issued arrest warrants for the missing lawmakers. Those warrants are ineffective while the lawmakers remain out of state, however, as Democratic lawmakers in the states where the legislators have relocated\u2014primarily Illinois\u2014have refused to extradite them to Texas to be prosecuted.\nFurther Reading"

The Texas Supreme Court is fully lined with nine Republican judges, some of whom were appointed by Abbott. Chief Justice Jimmy Blacklock is Abbott\u2019s former general counsel. However, the chief justice issued a 2021 opinion stating the Texas Constitution \u201cdoes enable quorum breaking by a minority faction,\u201d meaning Democrats\u2019 actions to block the vote could be lawful, though Blacklock noted the Constitution allows lawmakers to penalize members to compel their attendance. It is unlikely Democrats\u2019 breaking of the quorum amounts to the intent to abandon a seat, University of Missouri constitutional law expert Charles \u201cRocky\u201d Rhodes, told The Texas Tribune.\nWhat To Watch For\nA statute allowing Paxton and local district attorneys to ask courts to remove lawmakers says as long as there is \u201cprobable ground\u201d to challenge lawmakers\u2019 offices, local judges will be the deciding factor in booting them out from a chamber. That means vacating their seats could turn into a lengthy process, with Paxton noting in a podcast appearance with right-wing podcaster Benny Johnson that, \u201cWe\u2019d have to go through the court process, and we\u2019d have to file \u2026 in districts that are not friendly to Republicans.\u201d\nKey Background\nIn addition to the lawsuits, Texas officials have issued arrest warrants for the Democrats who left the state, though the warrants are largely symbolic as they only apply within state lines. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, urged the FBI this week to assist in arresting or locating the Democratic lawmakers, claiming they \u201cmay be guilty of bribery or other public corruption offenses.\u201d The Democrats are facing fines of $500 per day as they remain out of state, leading Republicans to suggest bribery charges for donations used to fund the fines or travel expenses. The allegations made by Republicans may not stick. Political attorney Andrew Cates told Forbes the \u201cidea of a group supporting the Texas Democrats as a whole or individually, just supporting them with funds, is inherently not illegal.\u201d Texas law also calls for \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of a bribery agreement to prove the allegation. It also must be clear an official\u2019s actions would not have been carried out if they did not receive a bribe. It is unclear when the Democrats will return to Texas. They will need to stay out of Texas until November to fully block the vote on the Congressional redistricting.\nFurther Reading\nTexas Gov. Wants Democrats Who Left State Kicked Out Of Office.

      "text": "Texas redistricting standoff complicates preparations for March 2026 primary\nSign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune\u2019s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\nThis coverage is made possible through Votebeat, a nonpartisan news organization covering local election administration and voting access. Sign up for Votebeat Texas\u2019 free newsletters here.\nWith Texas legislators locked in a standoff over Republicans\u2019 push to redraw the state\u2019s congressional districts mid-decade, time is running out for election officials to prepare for next year\u2019s primary without major disruption.\nPlanning for the March primary election is already underway, but election officials say they can\u2019t move forward without finalized maps \u2014 and the first key deadline, mandated by the state, is coming Sept. 9.\nDemocratic lawmakers have pledged to remain out of the state in protest of the Republicans\u2019 proposed congressional map, making an agreement unlikely by the end of the special session Aug. 19. The proposed map could still change, and if Gov. Greg Abbott calls another special session, the debate could extend well into the fall.\nWithout knowing where the boundaries will be drawn, election officials won\u2019t be able to finalize decisions about polling locations or the number of election workers needed. Voters whose polling location changes will also need to be informed and candidates who want a spot on the primary ballot also need the new boundary lines well in advance in order to familiarize themselves with the district and campaign. Candidates have to be residents of the district they seek to represent.\nIn a typical redistricting cycle year, the process of adapting to new maps is labor-intensive for election officials and takes months.\n\u201cWho knows if we\u2019ll have enough time?\u201d said Chris Davis, the voter registration director in Travis County. He said the Sept. 9 deadline is when county precinct chairs \u2014 who represent their political party in a precinct within their neighborhood \u2014 can begin filing to run in the primary. A new map could shift precinct boundaries entirely.\nCandidates \u201cneed to know now which precinct they\u2019re filing for,\u201d Davis said. \u201cIf we have to split a precinct into two, they may end up being the chair of a new precinct.\u201d\nThis site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.\nAll other primary candidates can begin filing for a spot on the ballot Nov. 8. The filing deadline is one month later.\nElection officials across the state have for months been updating precinct boundary lines to account for population growth, as required by state law in odd-numbered years. But that work is now on hold due to the redistricting battle, multiple election officials told Votebeat.\nIf and when new maps get approved, they\u2019ll have to start over.\nRedistricting in Texas has delayed elections in the past\nThe push to redraw Texas\u2019 congressional maps outside the normal 10-year cycle follows a push by President Donald Trump\u2019s advisers to help Republicans maintain control of the U.S. House in the 2026 midterms. Historically, the party in control loses seats in midterm elections, and Republicans currently have a slim majority.\nThe Republican-proposed map targets Democratic districts in the Austin, Dallas and Houston metro areas, as well as in South Texas.\nTexas election administrators have faced redistricting-related election delays before.\nIn 2012, the Texas primary election was delayed until the summer due to months of disagreement and litigation over the state\u2019s congressional maps. The date was changed twice, filing periods for candidates were pushed back, and campaigns were left in limbo without maps.\nElection officials worry the same thing could happen now \u2014 and say they may lose access to polling locations and workers they\u2019ve already secured for April and March, if delays persist.\n\u201cWe secure polling locations at least six months in advance,\u201d said Jennifer Doinoff, Hays County elections administrator. \u201cWe are making sure workers have enough time to plan for the dates of the election. If the dates change, those workers may not show up. The work for us is going to have to start all over again.\u201d\nDiffering impact for vote centers vs. precinct-based polling sites\nIn some counties, it\u2019s more urgent now to know the exact number of polling locations they\u2019ll need.\nNearly 100 of Texas\u2019 254 counties use vote centers, which allow voters to cast their ballot anywhere in their county on Election Day. Vote centers reduce the number of locations officials have to staff and equip on Election Day.\nThe rest of the state\u2019s counties assign voters to specific precincts. The number of precincts determines how many polling locations they\u2019ll be required to have and whether they\u2019ll need more workers. The new maps are key to figuring out that step of the process.\nDenton County, in North Texas, has precinct-based voting, and must make sure voters know well ahead of Election Day which location they\u2019re assigned to.\nFrank Phillips, the county\u2019s elections administrator, said he needs the final map soon to assess whether voters need to be reassigned or if more polling sites are required. Without that information, both voters and candidates will be in the dark about their districts \u2014 and what races will appear on their ballots.\n\u201cThey may show up at the polls expecting to vote for District 33 and now they're voting for District 26,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019ll create confusion like something\u2019s not right on their ballot.\u201d\nPhillips and other election officials are also watching key deadlines for sending absentee ballots to overseas and military voters, which has to be done more than a month ahead of the election. They must also program and test the voting equipment \u2014 a process that hinges on knowing which precincts and races are in play.\nNatalia Contreras is a reporter for Votebeat in partnership with the Texas Tribune.

  "argos_summary": "Texas Governor Greg Abbott is determined to push for a new congressional redistricting map despite over 50 Democratic lawmakers fleeing the state to block the vote, which could potentially add five GOP seats in the U.S. House. Abbott has vowed to call multiple special sessions to address the redistricting issue, asserting that the absence of Democrats will not halt the process. Meanwhile, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has filed a lawsuit to vacate the seats of 13 Democratic lawmakers, claiming their departure constitutes an abandonment of their offices. The ongoing standoff complicates preparations for the upcoming primary elections, as election officials cannot finalize plans without the new maps.",
