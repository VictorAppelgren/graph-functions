  "content": "WHAT\u2019S THE DEAL? \u2014 Business leaders and powerful service unions are at each other\u2019s throats in Los Angeles in a retaliatory tit-for-tat that began with passage of a new $30 minimum wage for tourism workers and has now launched six separate measures toward the 2026 ballot.\n\nWhat each side hopes to accomplish in the spiraling conflict is an open question, as Emily explored in a story this weekend, leaving some in the Southland to wonder whether they\u2019re seeing a well-worn playbook for shaping policy in the Capitol now being deployed in city halls.\n\nEver since state law changed a decade ago to allow proponents to quash their measures once qualified, there\u2019s been a pattern of \u201clabor and business filing competing ballot initiatives and using it as a negotiation tactic,\u201d said Los Angeles political consultant Michael Trujillo. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is just a very long-held strategy of using ballot initiatives making its way to LA.\u201d\n\nMayor Karen Bass has begun meeting with business-side groups to discuss a potential deescalation. The groups filed a referendum in late May to overturn the minimum-wage law and a subsequent proposal in July to repeal the city\u2019s $750-million-per-year gross-receipts tax.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re always amenable to sit down and figure out what the compromise is,\u201d said Greg Plummer, who owns a 250-employee concession company at Los Angeles International Airport. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want a Band-Aid solution.\u201d\n\nAt the other side of a negotiating table would be Unite Here Local 11, which lobbied for the so-called \u201cOlympic Wage\u201d and responded to the citizens-veto referendum by targeting its backers\u2019 bottom lines. The four countermeasures otherwise have little in common; one penalizes companies for their CEO pay, another makes it harder to build sports arenas and concert halls.\n\nThe powerful service union has already used the California ballot-measure leverage playbook in Los Angeles. In 2022, the powerful service union qualified an initiative for the 2024 ballot that would have forced local hotels to . But labor leaders about a year later when the City Council passed tighter regulations on the development of new hotels.\n\nConversations with people involved in the business-side measures indicate a handful of potential points for negotiation. They\u2019d want to see Unite Here withdraw its initiatives from the ballot, for one. But they would also likely want the City Council to agree to slow implementation of the new $30 wage law, giving businesses more time to comply \u2014 much like councilors did in 2015, when then-Mayor Eric Garcetti signed a $15 minimum wage bill into law.\n\n\u201cNot one business leader has said, \u2018Don\u2019t do the $30 minimum wage.\u2019 We have said, \u2018Do it in the right way,\u2019\u201d said Stuart Waldman, president of the Valley Industry and Commerce Association, which represents business interests in the San Fernando Valley. \u201cA 55-percent increase over the course of three years is just not sustainable. No business can do that.\u201d\n\nNegotiations, of course, require both parties involved to come to the proverbial table \u2014 and leaders of Unite Here seem less inclined to do so than their industry counterparts. Union co-president Kurt Petersen told Playbook last week that he sees the airline and tourism companies\u2019 decision to launch the referendum as a sign they weren\u2019t operating in good faith.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s left to negotiate,\u201d he told Playbook. \u201cThey had their chance, they decided to betray those negotiations, and our members are looking forward to getting a lot more done at the ballot next year.\u201d\n\nNEWS BREAK: UC Board of Regents meet this afternoon in emergency closed-door meeting on how to respond to the \u2026 Gifford Fire in San Luis Obispo County ... President Donald Trump to sell chipmaker Nvidia an export control license.\n\nWelcome to Ballot Measure Weekly, a special edition of Playbook PM focused on California\u2019s lively realm of ballot measure campaigns. Drop us a line at [email protected] and [email protected], or find us on X \u2014 @emilyrs and @wrmccart.\n\n\n\nA highly subjective ranking of the ballot measures \u2014 past and future, certain and possible \u2014 getting our attention this week.\n\n1. Redistricting (2025?): Gov. Gavin Newsom is pushing ahead with his plan to put mid-decade redistricting before California voters in a November special election, writing in a this morning that, \u201cIf you will not stand down, I will be forced to lead an effort to redraw the maps in California.\u201d All eyes will be on Democrats\u2019 proposed maps, which are slated for release ahead of the Legislature\u2019s return next week.\n\n2. Bay Area transit (2026?): Both the San Mateo and Santa Clara county transit agencies voted late last week to join the mega-regional ballot measure to fund BART and other public transportation in the Bay Area. The development is a major victory for the tax proposal, which will now come before voters in five counties.\n\n3. Affordable housing bond (2026?): The $10 billion bond to fund affordable housing appears \u2014 along with other ballot-related legislation like , which would allow public financing of elections \u2014 to have stalled behind redistricting in the Capitol\u2019s queue, for at least the first portion of the Legislature\u2019s return. The bond has passed the Assembly but has thus far made little progress in the Senate.\n\n4. Voter ID (2026): Assemblymember Carl DeMaio\u2019s grassroots organization says it has recruited 10,000 volunteers to collect signatures for an initiative that would require government-issued identification to vote. Reform California says it will launch a bus tour and rallies across the state beginning Oct. 12.\n\n5. Minimum wage (Los Angeles, 2026?): It will take another month to determine the future of an airline- and hotel-backed referendum that kicked off the LA ballot war. The city clerk is now conducting a hand count of 140,000 signatures submitted in late June by the LA Alliance for Tourism, Jobs and Progress after a random sample fell short of the validity rate required to qualify outright.\n\n6. Calexit (2028?): Among those who enjoyed Will\u2019s POLITICO Magazine , which exposed his criminal history and pattern of deceit, is apparently Yes California, the group that founded the state\u2019s modern sovereignty movement. Over the past week, the group has posted about the Mitchell controversy, writing in one post on X that \u201cthe people behind CalExit these days are idiots.\u201d\n\n7. Measure CL (Culver City, 2025): The Culver City Chamber of Commerce has on an all-mail Aug. 26 special election ballot. The organization may boast the most prestigious membership of any small city\u2019s chamber: It includes Apple, Amazon Studios, and Sony Pictures.\n\n\n\nTIME\u2019S UP FOR NOVEMBER BALLOT: While the Legislature has until Aug. 22 to pass a redistricting package in time to come before voters on Nov. 4, other governments around California won\u2019t have the same flexibility to rush their priorities onto a newly scheduled special-election ballot. Local measures must be approved at least 88 days before an election \u2014 meaning last Friday was the last possible day to do so.\n\n\n\nRIDESHARE DRIVERS (2020): After spending $204 million to classify their drivers as private contractors via Prop 22, Uber and Lyft are now putting pressure on senators to defeat a bill heading to the appropriations committee that would allow gig workers to unionize.\n\nThe group, now calling itself the Protect App-Based Drivers & Services coalition, has argued that AB 1340 violates the intent of voters that gave Prop 22 its majority. The bill introduced by Assemblymembers Buffy Wicks and Marc Berman would , a possibility originally limited by the ballot initiative but later reopened after .\n\nThe coalition has argued that the bill would make rideshare services \u201cless affordable and less accessible for the millions of Californians\u201d and require companies to share drivers\u2019 personal information. Those arguments have failed to slow the bill, which has cruised through transportation committees in both houses.\n\n\n\nTenants\u2019 rights groups in Massachusetts filed an initiative last week that would to cost-of-living growth, overturning a 1994 ballot referendum banning rent control in the state ... An Oregon initiative to , a measure identical to a failed 2022 proposal but from different proponents this time, received its ballot title from the state\u2019s justice department ...\n\nLocal Republican leaders in Idaho are launching an initiative effort to after a legislative push on the issue failed ... Seattle voters will weigh in this November on an initiative that would , a move the City Council made after seeing Seattle\u2019s economic forecast improve slightly ...\n\nAnd an initiative to in Switzerland is gaining some new momentum after a new poll \u2014 released just ahead of the country\u2019s firework-filled national holiday \u2014 found 68 percent of Swiss voters support it.\n\n\n\n\u2026 SANTA ROSA: A century-old North Bay commuter school wants to ask the voters of the Sonoma County Junior College District for a near-billion-dollar bond to update aging infrastructure, including a Great Depression-era building that houses its art department. But while affordability concerns push down polling numbers elsewhere for new taxes and borrowing, Santa Rosa Junior College is counting on its deep connections even beyond its county lines to ease its way to passage in 2026.\n\n\u201cWe are huge in our community,\u201d said Kate Jolley, the school\u2019s vice president of finance and administrative services. \u201cIt\u2019s not the same throughout the state, we really have something special here.\u201d\n\nIn the 106 years since its founding as a feeder school for UC Berkeley, Santa Rosa Junior College has established itself as one of the best community colleges in the state. WalletHub last year ranked it 16th out of 653 on its list of the country\u2019s \u201c .\u201d\n\nBut all those years of service have also taken a toll on campus facilities, including an unrenovated, approximately 85-year-old \u201cheritage\u201d building constructed by the federal Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression. The community-college district that encompasses all of Sonoma County as well as parts of Marin and Mendocino has approved two bonds for facilities maintenance and renovations since 2002, but that money for infrastructure is now drying up.\n\nSupport for such funding measures was once nearly automatic, especially in progressive areas like this. But in May a local group called the Coalition of Sensible Taxpayers was able to defeat a 52-cent per-square foot parcel tax in a small Marin school district that previously had been undefeated when asking its community for more money.\n\nInstead of asking voters to approve a new tax, Santa Rosa Junior College is now exploring whether an extension of the existing bond would sit better with a penny-pinching electorate. The college has commissioned Bay Area pollster FM3 to study voter attitudes as it decides how to fund its way into another century.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that the relationship we have in our community will help move us forward,\u201d Jolley said. \u201cAnd if not, we will hear that.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u2026 MEASURE G: In 2024, Measure G was a Los Angeles County charter amendment that now working to . In the past, the letter G has been used to identify a range of local-level ballot measures across the state, including those to:\n\nGrant San Francisco city employees two weeks of vacation after one year\u2019s service, and three weeks after five years ( , failed) ... Set rates for a service that would allow Richmond residents to watch television over cables from \u201cone master antenna\u201d ( , failed) \u2026 Extend rent-control protections for Berkeley tenants in three- and four-unit properties ( , passed) \u2026 Convert a 72-acre oceanfront bluff in Half Moon Bay into a \u201cpassive park\u201d ( , passed) \u2026 Impose term limits for Fresno\u2019s mayor ( , passed)\u2026 Allow Mendocino County residents to grow up to 25 marijuana plants for personal use ( , passed) \u2026 Enact a 2-percent utility users tax in Morgan Hill ( , failed) ... Require voter approval for any land designation changes in Goleta for agricultural parcels more than 10 acres ( , passed) ... Change the city of Escondido from a general law city to a charter city ( , failed) ... Protect \u201cscenic corridors\u201d and \u201cvista points\u201d along Highway 50 through El Dorado County\u2019s zoning plan ( , failed) ... Increase the Calaveras County hotel tax to fund general services ( , passed) ... Limit City Council salary increases in Carlsbad ( , passed) ... And approve a business tax for commercial cannabis companies in Corona ( , passed).\n\nView all our political and policy newsletters",

  "summary": "Business leaders and powerful service unions in Los Angeles are engaged in a ballot battle, which began with the passage of a new $30 minimum wage for tourism workers and has now launched six separate measures toward the 2026 ballot. The conflict has raised questions about what each side hopes to achieve in this ongoing conflict. Los Angeles political consultant Michael Trujillo suggests this strategy is a long-held strategy used by both sides to influence policy. Mayor Karen Bass has begun meeting with business-side groups to discuss a potential deescalation. Meanwhile, Unite Here Local 11, which has previously qualified an initiative for the 2024 ballot, has responded to the referendum by targeting its backers' bottom lines. The four countermeasures have little in common.",

      "text": "This story was produced by the Oregon Journalism Project, a nonprofit newsroom covering the state.\nBackers of Initiative Petition 43, which would allow grocery stores to sell hard liquor, got a certified ballot title from the Oregon Department of Justice this week.\nHere\u2019s the title: \u201cEligible retailers and wholesalers may be licensed to sell distilled liquor; retailers taxed on sales.\u201d\nAnybody who wants to challenge that title now has until Aug. 19 to do so at the Oregon Supreme Court.\nGetting a ballot title is a key step toward gathering the 117,173 valid signatures the state requires for the initiative to appear on the November 2026 ballot. Privatizing hard liquor sales\u2014which currently fall under the purview of the Oregon Liquor and Cannabis Commission\u2014has been a hot-button issue for years. Washington voters privatized liquor sales in that state in 2011, and Oregon grocers have tried to do the same repeatedly since, without success. So in one sense, it\u2019s not surprising to see IP 43 moving toward the ballot.\nBut almost nothing else about the initiative is normal.\nFor instance, in the ballot title process, the only group that made comments, the Oregon Beer & Wine Distributors Association, and the Department of Justice both noted that the language in IP 43 is a carbon copy of an unsuccessful 2022 initiative backed by the Northwest Grocery Retail Association, whose members would like to sell hard liquor.\n\u201cIP 43 is identical to IP 35 (2022), and the draft \u2018yes\u2019 result statement is identical to the [2022] ballot title certified without modification by the Oregon Supreme Court,\u201d DOJ lawyer Shannon Teel wrote in an Aug. 5 letter explaining certification of the ballot title.\nNorthwest Grocery Retail Association CEO Amanda Dalton says her organization has nothing to do with the measure and did not give the chief petitioners, David John Allison and Kyle LoCascio, both of Portland, permission to use the 2022 language.\n\u201cStill no outreach or contact from them,\u201d Dalton said in a text message Aug. 8. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who they are.\u201d\nUnlike typical proponents of a ballot measure, the petitioners behind IP 43 have neither established a website to communicate with voters, nor have they taken the basic step of establishing a political action committee with the Oregon Secretary of State\u2019s Elections Division. That is a step that five initiatives filed after IP 43 have already taken, and it\u2019s a prerequisite for raising and spending the kind of money it takes to gather more than 100,000 valid voter signatures.\nIn a brief phone conversation, LoCascio, who has previous experience with ballot initiatives, said he couldn\u2019t provide any information about who\u2019s likely to fund IP 43 or offer any other campaign details\u2014saying only that he hopes to share more after the Aug. 19 deadline for any ballot title appeal."

      "text": "Advertisement\nHousing groups hope to put a law limiting rent increases on the ballot in 2026\nBay Staters might have the chance next year to vote on a proposed law to limit rent increases.\nMembers of Homes for All Mass, a coalition of housing groups across the state, plan to file an initiative petition with Attorney General Andrea Campbell's office Wednesday, with 5 p.m. marking the deadline for ballot question backers to submit signatures and proposed language needed to start of a lengthy process.\nHundreds of advocates flooded the State House last week for a rally organized by Homes for All Mass, ahead of a legislative hearing that featured a rent stabilization proposal. Supporters say the measure could deliver immediate relief to some residents while new housing units are produced under a major 2024 housing law.\nThe initiative petition would similarly limit annual rent increases to the cost of living with a 5% cap, according to a Homes for All Mass advisory. There would be exemptions for owner-occupied buildings with four or fewer units, plus new buildings for the first decade.\nThe cost of living increase last year was 2.9%, which would have been the allowable maximum rent increase in 2025 if the proposed measure had been in place. In 2022, the cost of living increase was 8%, but the measure would have restricted the rent boost to 5%.\n\"Massive rent hikes are pushing seniors out of the homes they've lived in for decades, and making it impossible for young families to save money for a down payment on their first house,\" Noemi Ramos, executive director of New England Community Project, said in a statement. \"As the state works to build more affordable housing over the coming years, we need rent stabilization to protect workers, families, and seniors from out-of-control housing costs today.\"\nRent control was banned in Massachusetts through a 1994 ballot referendum, and the Legislature over the years has shown little interest in reinstituting the policy. The majority of renters struggle to afford their rent, according to Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies.\n\"Rent stabilization is critical because rents are going up so quickly, and people need relief immediately,\" said Annie Gordon, a resident of the Fairlawn Estates in Mattapan. \"Having lived at Fairlawn for 50 years, I was there when we had rent control up until 1994, and I saw the stability it created for my community and the city. Then, after it was banned, I saw huge rent increases, apartments that weren\u2019t well maintained, stress, fear, homelessness, and evictions.\"\nAdvertisement\nAdvocates say the potential ballot question could halt corporate landlords from imposing steep rent hikes, though the policy is likely to attract strong opposition from the real estate lobby.\nAt the hearing last week, landlords with the Small Property Owners Association argued rent stabilization bills are not the answer to the state's housing problems.\n\"This bill may be well-intentioned, but the outcome will have fewer available units, deteriorating housing conditions, and owners walking away from reinvestment in all the housing stock that needs care,\" Tony Lopes, who spoke on the SPOA panel, told lawmakers. \"And it penalizes the small property owners who make up 60% or more of [the] commonwealth's rental market, including the immigrant and minority property owners who are seeking just to get ahead. We need to consider real solutions, zoning reform, more state-level housing production, and accountability for the rising cost of insurance.\"\nBy the close of business Wednesday, initiative petition texts and signatures from 10 registered voters must be submitted to Campbell's office. After a review, the AG typically makes certification decisions regarding which proposals are ballot eligible by the first Wednesday in September. Backers must then collect 74,574 signatures from registered voters and file them with local elections officials for certification by Nov. 19."

      "text": "L.A. voters to decide whether hotels must rent vacant rooms to homeless people\n- Share via\nA controversial measure that would require hotels in Los Angeles to rent vacant rooms to homeless people will go before voters in 2024, the City Council decided Friday.\nThe council rejected an option that would have skipped the public vote and enacted the ordinance directly, instead voting 12 to 0 to send the measure to the ballot. The initiative is backed by the hospitality worker union Unite Here Local 11, which had gathered enough signatures to place it before voters.\nFriday\u2019s council vote sets the stage for a protracted public battle over the measure, with L.A. voters having the ultimate say in 19 months. The hotel industry will probably mount vigorous opposition to the ballot measure. A number of progressive community and housing groups have backed it alongside Unite Here.\nThe proposal comes as city officials are gradually closing one of the signature programs set up to address homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic: Project Roomkey, which turned multistory hotels into makeshift shelters. A number of the Project Roomkey sites have already closed.\nProject Roomkey, a state program backed by federal dollars, was intended to house homeless people during the pandemic. But it never got close to its goal.\nHotel owners and operators made up a large contingent of the packed council chamber, with many arguing that the proposal would unfairly burden hotels and hurt their ability to do business.\nA handful of hotel workers spoke in support of the measure, while some others opposed it.\nUnder the proposal, hotels would be required to regularly report the number of vacant rooms they have to the city\u2019s housing department. A program run through the department would then make referrals and pay \u201cfair market rate\u201d for the lodging using prepaid vouchers. Hotels would be prohibited from discriminating against homeless Angelenos \u201cfor their participation in this program, or the fact or perception, that they are unhoused.\u201d\nThat proposed voucher program has no designated source of funding and would be contingent on funding being secured by July 1, 2023, according to a report from the city attorney\u2019s office.\nUnite Here Local 11 spokesperson Maria Hernandez said the voucher program would set up a system for utilizing various funding streams.\n\u201cJust like with Project Roomkey, there are federal, state and local sources of funding for emergency housing, and this initiative creates a new option for using those funds to get people into housing immediately,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cThere are also nonprofits, churches and other private sources that are interested in buying vouchers to house those in need.\u201d\nThe measure would also have significant land-use implications for new hotel development.\nDuring his public comment, Northeast Los Angeles Hotel Owners Assn. President Ray Patel asked all the hotel owners in the room to stand up, saying their operations would be dramatically affected if the proposal was directly approved. Patel, who owns Welcome Inn in Eagle Rock, urged the city to instead use Project Roomkey\u2019s voluntary participation as a model.\n\u201cHotels would gladly volunteer their hotels to participate in programs as long as there\u2019s a wraparound service, which includes mental health service, social service, 24-hour security and somebody\u2019s there to hold their hand and help them get into permanent housing,\u201d Patel said.\nSeveral speakers also raised concerns about the lack of details regarding how the sweeping proposal would work.\n\u201cWe have no economic data about what it will cost the city,\u201d Stuart Waldman, president of the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., said, noting the lack of funding source and the fact that rates had not yet been set for hotel rooms.\n\u201cHotels did not cause the homeless problem. Hotels are not the solution for the homeless problem,\u201d Waldman said to loud applause in the council chamber.\nRichard Earle, a representative of independent hospitality insurance brokerage Petra Risk Solutions, was one of several speakers who said the program would reduce hotels\u2019 ability to procure and maintain insurance.\n\u201cInsurance carriers will legitimately pull coverage,\u201d Earle said. \u201cThe business is underwritten with risks that involve guests and business travelers, not residents who bring a whole set of separate implications.\u201d\nBut Carly Kirchen, an organizer with Unite Here Local 11, argued that hotel operators and associations were being unfairly prejudiced against homeless Angelenos.\n\u201cThe hotel operators would have you believe that every person experiencing homelessness is so sick that they are a danger to the people around them. But this myth argument misrepresents who is actually experiencing homelessness,\u201d Kirchen said, noting that hotel workers are among those most affected by the housing crisis, with thousands of their members facing eviction.\n\u201cEven as a union member with a good-paying job, I was recently homeless due to the housing crisis in our city,\u201d said Bambian Taft, who identified herself as a hotel minibar attendant and former housekeeper. Taft said she had recently paid out of pocket to stay at hotels with her daughters when there was \u201cno work for me at the hotel.\u201d\nAmid a broader housing crisis, the proposal would also yoke the development of some new hotels to affordable housing construction. If existing housing units are being demolished or converted for a new hotel, the hotel would have to replace them with an equivalent number of affordable housing units, with some exemptions. These could be located on site or in the surrounding area.\nIn addition, the proposal would require new projects with more than 100 rooms to obtain a conditional use permit for approval. Permitting would depend on a number of factors, including market demand for the hotel and how it might affect the surrounding community.\nThe council\u2019s vote puts the ballot measure onto the city\u2019s next regularly scheduled election, which under election timing rules would be the March 5, 2024, primary."

It was defeated by a margin of 377 votes.\nThis initiative was called the \"Initiative to Retain El Dorado County\u2019s Current Zoning and Rural Assets\" by petitioners.[1]\n| A \"yes\" vote was a vote in favor of enacting the proposed initiative, establishing the zoning and land use policies summarized below. |\n| A \"no\" vote was a vote against enacting the proposed initiative, leaving the zoning and land use policies of the county unchanged. |\nElection results\n| El Dorado County, Measure G | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Result | Votes | Percentage | ||\n| No | 30,242 | 50.63% | ||\n| Yes | 29,489 | 49.37% |\n- Election results from El Dorado County Elections Office\nOverview\nWhat was Measure G designed to do?\nSome of the most notable provisions of the initiative were designed to:[2]\n- prohibit new commercial and residential development if they lack existing water supplies or the ability to connect to existing public water systems;\n- restrict development near agricultural areas; and\n- protect \u201cscenic corridors\u201d and \u201cvista points,\" especially along Highway 50, an area eyed by developers for new projects.[2]\nWhy was it proposed?\nThis initiative, which was backed by slow-growth activists, was written to reduce the amount of new development in the county and preserve rural and agricultural areas.[2]\nThe proposed initiative sought, in many areas, to restore zoning and land use policies to those found in the 2004 General Plan in order to preserve rural areas and restrict commercial, residential and industrial development. Specifically, the initiative would:\n- require property zoning to match land designation in the county's general plan and establishing a Compatibility chart to govern zoning changes;\n- restore a 2004 agricultural buffer standard for developments;\n- restore the Mixed Use development policies to where they were in 2004;\n- restore the Cultural and Historial Resource policies found in the 2004 General Plan, with an exception for Highway 49;\n- largely restore water policies to those found in the 2004 General Plan; and\n- enact the Scenic Corridor and Vista Point regulations found in the 2004 General Plan\nBackground\n2014 measures\nProponents of both slow-growth initiatives on the ballot worked to put Measure O, an initiative designed to restrict and discourage residential development in certain areas of the county, on the ballot in November 2014. Two other initiatives, Measure N and Measure M, were also put before voters in 2014. All three 2014 development-related initiatives were defeated.[2]\nText of measure\nBallot question\nThe following question appeared on the ballot:[3]\n| \u201c |\nShall the ordinance be adopted to (1) add, amend, or delete fifteen distinct policies in the El Dorado County General Plan concerning land use, agriculture, mixed use, cultural and historical resources, and water supply and (2) preclude El Dorado County from approving any future discretionary project until it implements twelve enumerated General Plan policies related to community design guidelines, cultural and historical resources, water supply, and scenic corridors, as more fully described in the proposed ordinance?[4] |\n\u201d |\nBallot summary\nThe following summary of this initiative was provided by the office of the county counsel:[5]\n| \u201c |\nThe El Dorado County General Plan provides for long range direction and policy for land use within El Dorado County. The Land Use Element describes, and maps, the numerous land use designations assigned to all land within El Dorado County. Those land use designations identify the areas suitable for certain uses and limits the density and intensity of those uses. The Zoning Ordinance establishes various districts within the County. Each parcel of land is assigned to a district, which governs the uses that may take place and types of buildings that may be erected on that parcel. The zoning classification assigned to a given parcel of land must be consistent with the General Plan land use designation assigned to that parcel. Where land use designations are inconsistent with current zoning, the initiative would require that the County amend the land use designation to match existing zoning. The initiative would also require that future decisions for land use changes be based on the land use compatibility matrix attached to the initiative. General Plan Policy 8.1.3.1 generally requires that parcels created next to agriculturally zoned lands be at least 10 acres. Policy 8.1.3.2 generally requires that agriculturally incompatible uses adjacent to agriculturally zoned lands provide a minimum setback of 200 feet from the agriculturally zoned land. Policy 8.4.1.2 generally requires a setback of at least 200 feet on parcels adjacent to lands identified as timber production lands designated Natural Resource and/or lands zoned Timberland Production Zone. The initiative would revise Policy 8.1.3.2 to provide that administrative relief from the setback requirements may only be granted by the Agricultural Commission. The initiative also seeks to restore Policies 8.1.3.1 and 8.4.1.2 to their original language from 2004. \u201cMixed use development\u201d is a type of development that combines various uses (such as office, commercial, institutional, and residential) in a single project. General Plan Policies 2.1.1.3, 2.1.2.5, and 2.2.1.2 allow mixed use development on parcels designated as Commercial, with maximum residential densities of sixteen dwelling units per acre in Community Regions and four dwelling units per acre in Rural Centers. The initiative seeks to restore those policies to the language in place when the 2004 General Plan was adopted. General Plan Policy 5.2.1.3 requires that all medium-density residential, high-density residential, multifamily residential, commercial, industrial, and research and development projects in Rural Centers connect to either a public water system or an approved private water system. The initiative would require that such projects connect to a public water system. General Plan Policy 5.2.1.14 requires the County to collect and make available information on water supply and demand. The initiative would require that such information recognize the water needs of existing unimproved parcels. The initiative would also delete Policy 5.2.1.7, which, in times of declared water shortages, provides priority to approving affordable housing and non-residential development projects. The initiative provides that it is not applicable within the jurisdiction of the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the City of Placerville and that its policies are to remain in effect indefinitely unless amended by voter approval.[4] |\n\u201d |\nCompatibility chart\nThe following compatibility chart would, under the initiative, determine whether or not a parcel could be rezoned:\nSupport\nSupporters\nSue Taylor, a member of Save Our County (SOC), and Laurel Stroud, a member of Residents Involved in Positive Planning (RIPP), organized the signature petition campaign to put both this initiative and an initiative designed to restrict traffic congestions caused by development before voters.[1][6]\nLocal Voter Control of Land Use in El Dorado County also sponsored both initiatives.[7]\nThe following individuals signed the official argument in favor of Measure G:[3]\n- Patricia G. Chelseth of My Sisters' Farm\n- Tim Taylor, owner of a building in Historic Hangtown\n- Rod Pimental, owner of El Dorado Norther Lumber Company\n- Bill Thorpe\n- Dennis Smith, owner of Ranting Raven Fruits and Vegetables\nArguments in favor\nFran Duchamp, a county resident, told the county board of supervisors that the initiatives were needed since \u201cthe citizens of El Dorado County have been asking for clarity and protections of our way of life for decades.\u201d She accused the supervisors and the county planning commissioners of having \"continued to ignore, change, re-interpret or amend parts of the general plan that were promised to the public as protections.\u201d[2]\nSupporters of these initiatives argued that the county board of supervisors was being influenced by development and business interests, leading to large developments that were harmful to the rural nature and character of the county. The Local Voter Control of Land Use in El Dorado County website stated, \"Enough is enough! The only way to control development is for citizens to take local voter control of land use through the initiative process.\"[8]\nOfficial argument\nThe following official argument was submitted in favor of Measure G:[3]\n| \u201c |\nEl Dorado County voters were promised that the 2004 General Plan would control growth, protect agriculture, limit traffic, protect open space and our water, encourage healthy economic growth, and preserve our rural quality of life. Most voters didn't realize that those protections would have to be implemented AFTER the plan was approved. To date, the Board of Supervisors has yet to implement those policies. As a result, our rural resources, jobs, forests, historic structures, native cultural sites and roads have been devastated.\nImplementing protective policies will preserve our historical downtowns, cultural sites, farms, ranches, water resources and safeguard against incompatible land uses. Creating Community plans will protect the unique character of each individual community within the county, promote rural commerce and improve economic development. Measure G is endorsed by farmers, local contractors, small businesses, historians, taxpayer and environmental advocates along with the unspoken dedicated army of unpaid petition gathers who labored relentlessly to gather the necessary signatures for this measure. Vote \"Yes\" on Measure G to bring common sense back to controlling growth and protecting our quality of life![4] |\n\u201d |\nOpposition\nOpponents\nThe chief opponents of this initiative and it's traffic-related counterpart were from the ranks of business, development and ranching interests.[2]\nThe Alliance for Responsible Planning, a group that advocates for businesses, opposed both initiatives.[2][9]\nMaryann Argyres, the president of the alliance, said that the initiatives would cause lawsuits, confusion and chaos.[2]\nThe following individuals signed the official argument in opposition to Measure G:[3]\n- Jim Davies, president of the El Dorado County Farm Bureau\n- Alexis Boeger, vice president of the El Dorado Winery Association\n- Doug Leisz, chairman Citizens for Water\n- Debbie Manning, President/CEO of the El Dorado Hills Chamber of Commerce\n- Laurel Brent-Bumb, CEO of the El Dorado County Chamber of Commerce\nArguments against\nOpponents of this initiative argued that it would impede smart and responsible growth, hurting the economy and the job market in the county.[9]\nOfficial argument\nThe following official argument was submitted in opposition to Measure G:[3]\n| \u201c |\nMeasure G threatens El Dorado County water rights, jobs and our economy. It could cost the County needed revenue and Measure G could tie the County up in costly court battles for years. EL DORADO COUNTY PREPARED AN OFFICIAL MEASURE G ANALYSIS, AND THE REPORT SHOWS THE DAMAGE MEASURE G COULD DO TO EL DORADO COUNTY: .... hurt the County's ability to maintain a reliable supply of water for farmers and residents .... hurt the local economy by preventing new jobs from being created, and making it harder for the county to produce high-paying quality jobs needed to maintain a strong local economy .... make the El Dorado County economy less diverse, which would make the county's economy more volatile and vulnerable to recessions .... result in lawsuits and legal challenges because of conflicts with existing county and state laws .... Reduce funding to repair and improve local roads and highways FARMERS OPPOSE MEASURE G BECAUSE IT PUTS EL DORADO COUNTY WATER AT RISK AND THREATENS OUR OPEN SPACE. Measure G will push development to more rural areas of the county \u2014 eating up more open space and increasing traffic on rural roads and neighborhood streets. And Measure G could further damage local farmers, ranchers and other businesses that have already been hurt by the drought, and result in higher local water rates for residents. BUSINESS LEADERS AND LABOR OPPOSE MEASURE G BECAUSE IT WILL COST JOBS, HURT SMALL BUSINESSES AND UPSET THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN PROVIDING A STRONG ECONOMY AND PROTECTING OPEN SPACE. Get the facts. Join farmers, business, labor, public safety, educators and other community leaders who are voting \"no\" on Measure G \u2014 protect our rural open space.[4] |\n\u201d |\nPath to the ballot\nIn Fall 2014, petitioners turned in 9,858 signatures to qualify this initiative for the ballot. On October 23, 2014, the county elections office certified that 8,289 of the submitted signatures were valid, qualifying the initiative for the county election ballot. Petitioners needed valid signatures equal to 10 percent of the votes cast for governor in the county in the preceding gubernatorial election. This minimum threshold amounted to 7,757. The sufficient signature petition gave the county board of supervisors the option of enacting the initiative directly or putting it before voters on June 7, 2016. The board voted to put the measure before voters.[10]\nRelated measures\n2016\n- El Dorado County, California, Road and Traffic Congestion Policies Initiative, Measure E (June 2016)\n2014\nMeasure M: El Dorado County Residential Subdivision or Re-zoning Restrictions\nMeasure N: El Dorado County Traffic and Road Improvement Funding Policies\nMeasure O: El Dorado County Community Region Removal and Rural Center Establishment\nRecent news\nThe link below is to the most recent stories in a Google news search for the terms El Dorado County zoning and land use initiative Measure G.

      "text": "Your Guide to California\u2019s 2024 Ballot Measures\nProp 2\nThe one that would fix up schools\nProp 2 tees up $10 billion in bonds to pay for repairs and renovations at K-12 schools and community colleges statewide.\nThere are actually 252 districts with local school bonds on the ballot this fall, from tiny Del Norte Unified to a $9 billion bond to fund city-state Los Angeles Unified School district.\nWill McCarthy\nCalifornia Reporter\nWhat changes if it passes?\nOutdated or dangerous school infrastructure would be replaced or upgraded, and California\u2019s educational facilities would probably be in a much better spot. It also will saddle the state with a $500 million per year debt over 35 years, according to the Legislative Analyst's Office.\nAdvertisement\nHow direct democracy avoids partisan deadlock to create politics in new shapes and sizes\nProp 3\nThe one about marriage equality\nProp 3 would amend the state constitution to remove dormant language banning same-sex marriage and guarantee the \u201cright to marry is a fundamental right.\u201d\nCalifornia is one of three states voting on marriage amendments this year. Both Hawaii and Colorado are asking voters to remove outdated bans from their constitutions, too.\nWill McCarthy\nCalifornia Reporter\nWhat changes if it passes?\nNothing, for now at least. The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that states can\u2019t ban same-sex unions, but since the court overturned Roe v. Wade progressives have worried that other hard-won civil-rights precedents could be targeted next. The amendment would ensure that if the court did revisit its gay-rights rulings \u2014 or, for that matter, its interracial-marriage decision \u2014 those rights would remain on safe footing in California.\nProp 4\nThe one trying to deal with climate change\nCalifornia\u2019s battle with climate change comes to the ballot in the form of a $10 billion bond to fund water, wildfire, and energy projects.\nThere are two big bond measures on the ballot and some working to pass them quietly worry they might be competing against one another.\nWill McCarthy\nCalifornia Reporter\nWhat changes if it passes?\nThe state would take on debt to spend big on climate resiliency and environmental health projects. Billions would be spent to prepare for droughts, floods, extreme heat, and other symptoms of climate change.\nShare it with your friends and family\nProp 5\nThe one that makes it easier for cities to borrow for housing\nProp 5 would lower the voter threshold needed to pass bond measures to fund affordable housing and certain types of public infrastructure from two-thirds to 55 percent.\nVoters seem to be reluctant to borrow more money \u2014 they just barely approved Prop 1, a smaller bond issue this spring to fund mental health and anti-homelessness projects, so campaign strategists say anything spending-related is a tough sell this fall.\nEmily Schultheis\nCalifornia Reporter\nWhat changes if it passes?\nLocal governments will find it easier to borrow money for affordable housing and public infrastructure projects. Groups pushing those projects will also have to include certain accountability requirements to ensure the money is being spent responsibly.\nProp 6\nThe one that bans prison labor\nProp 6 would amend the California state constitution\u2019s slavery ban to include forced prison labor.\nThis is part of a national movement. Seven other states have passed similar bans at the ballot in recent years, and Nevada is voting on the issue this year as well.\nEmily Schultheis\nCalifornia Reporter\nWhat changes if it passes?\nIncarcerated people in California would no longer face disciplinary consequences if they choose not to work while in prison. Right now, about 40,000 of the state\u2019s approximately 90,000 prisoners work, including as janitors, fighting fires and making license plates, often paid less than $1 per hour.\nAdvertisement\nHere are the local issues we\u2019re seeing pop up in lots of different places at once\nProp 32\nThe one that raises the minimum wage\nProp 32 would raise the state minimum wage to a nation high $18 an hour and then adjust it for inflation a few years later.\nUsually business and labor fight tooth and nail over the minimum wage, but both sides are curiously uninterested in this.\nWill McCarthy\nCalifornia Reporter\nWhat changes if it passes?\nThe wage floor would bump up two dollars in January, giving at least two million people in California an immediate raise if they remain employed.\nProp 33\nThe one about rent control\nProp 33 would give local governments greater freedom to enact rent control, and it\u2019s the most expensive thing on the ballot this year. The big dogs on either side of the debate have combined to throw $100 million at the measure in a year when overall spending is down.\nA few cities already have rent control, but this measure would change how and when it could be applied.\nWill McCarthy\nCalifornia Reporter\nWhat changes if it passes?\nCities and counties would be able to enact new, more aggressive rent control statutes, including on newer buildings and by capping increases at lower levels than currently permitted. That would likely lead to more variable housing policies across the state, as municipalities look to tackle shortages or potentially deploy their new authority to prevent new construction.\nProp 34\nThe one that goes after that guy everyone seems to hate\nProp 34 targets the political spending of one guy, the well-connected non-profit executive Michael Weinstein, and the AIDS Healthcare Foundation he runs.\nYou won\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on in this one without reading about Prop 33 first.\nWill McCarthy\nCalifornia Reporter\nWhat changes if it passes?\nThe AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a Los Angeles non-profit that is one of the world\u2019s leading provider of services to HIV-positive people, would have to abandon most of its political activities \u2014 or find a new way to fund them.\nProp 35\nThe one about health care taxes\nProp 35 would make permanent a tax on certain health care plans and require that the money go toward Medi-Cal, California\u2019s public health insurance program for low-income residents.\nThis is an unlikely kumbaya story. The big health-care interests behind Prop 35 \u2014 doctors, providers, hospital employees \u2014 rarely find themselves all on the same side of any health-care policy debate.\nEmily Schultheis\nCalifornia Reporter\nWhat changes if it passes?\nThe tax on health insurance providers known as managed-care organizations, or MCOs, is set to expire in 2026. Prop 35 would extend its life, and require that tax revenue fund Medi-Cal \u2014 stopping politicians from shuffling it to meet other needs.\nAdvertisement\nProp 36\nThe one that\u2019s tough on crime\nProp 36 would increase penalties for repeat offenders of certain theft- and drug-related crimes, reclassifying them as possible felonies instead of misdemeanors.\nProsecutors tried a version of this in 2020, and failed by a large margin. I\u2019ll be watching to see how much public opinion has changed.\nEmily Schultheis\nCalifornia Reporter\nWhat changes if it passes?\nProsecutors would be able to charge offenders who have two prior convictions for crimes like theft and drug possession to be charged with a felony, rather than a misdemeanor. Prop 36 would also create a new crime category for \u201ctreatment-mandated felonies\u201d for those repeatedly convicted of possessing hard drugs: They would then have the option of participating in mandatory drug treatment instead of going to jail.\nSan Francisco\u2019s Prop L\nThe one where a city would tax robotaxis to fund mass transit\nSan Francisco\u2019s Prop L would tax some of the city\u2019s ride-hailing and robotaxi companies as a way to fund public transportation.\nUber and Lyft have already proven themselves to be ballot-measure giants. In 2020, they beat back a statewide initiative to classify rideshare drivers as employees with the most costly non-presidential campaign in American history.\nWill McCarthy\nCalifornia Reporter\nWhat changes if it passes?\nUber, Lyft and Waymo would pay a new tax on revenue from rides in San Francisco, and then funnel money directly to Muni, San Francisco\u2019s unusually well-liked city-run transit agency.\nLos Angeles County\u2019s Measure G\nThe one that would overhaul the most powerful elected body you\u2019re probably not paying attention to\nMeasure G would change the structure of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors for the first time in 172 years.\nEach LA. supervisor currently represents around 2 million constituents, equal to about three congressional districts.\nEmily Schultheis\nCalifornia Reporter\nWhat changes if it passes?\nThe county would get four new supervisors\u2019 districts starting in 2032, increasing the total number of seats from five to nine and introduce an elected county executive position. It would also create new ethics and accountability requirements for the board.\nSanta Ana\u2019s Measure DD\nThe one in Orange County that would let noncitizens vote\nMeasure DD would allow noncitizens living in Santa Ana to vote in local elections.\nSan Francisco and Oakland both allow noncitizens to vote in school-board elections, but this would go further.\nEmily Schultheis\nCalifornia Reporter\nWhat changes if it passes?\nStarting in 2028, anyone with established residence would be allowed to vote in local elections. That means they couldn\u2019t cast a vote for president or members of Congress, but would be able to weigh in on the Santa Ana mayor, the city council and local ballot measures (like this one!).\nAdvertisement\nSonoma County\u2019s Measure J\nThe one about the rabbits (but mostly chickens and cows)\nSonoma County\u2019s Measure J would ban so-called factory farms in one of the state's premier agricultural counties.\nCalifornia voters have been into animal welfare initiatives recently, including 2018\u2019s Prop 12, a so-called \u201cfoie gras ban\u201d requiring chickens and other farm animals go cage-free that passed easily at the ballot.\nWill McCarthy\nCalifornia Reporter\nWhat changes if it passes?\nFarms would face new restrictions on the number of animals they could keep and regulate their living conditions, with some almost certain to shut down or be forced to dramatically overhaul their businesses in Sonoma.\nSanta Cruz\u2019s Measure Z\nThe one that might make sodas more expensive\nSanta Cruz\u2019s Measure Z would impose a two-cent tax per ounce of soda distributed in the city to fund local public-health programs.\nLocal politicians are (quite literally) trying to get sued by some of America\u2019s wealthiest companies.\nWill McCarthy\nCalifornia Reporter\nWhat changes if it passes?\nThe initiative would almost definitely trigger a lawsuit by soda companies seeking to defend a state ban on such taxes that the California Legislature passed at their behest in 2018."

      "text": "The shifting shapes of this year\u2019s California ballot-measure coalitions\nIf you\u2019re sick of reading about partisan trench conflict around polarized issues, check this out. Ballot measures often drop questions before voters that don\u2019t map neatly on our Democrat-Republican divides. Every effort to pass or defeat a ballot measure starts from scratch, cobbling together a coalition of like-minded interest groups, activists, donors and politicians while hoping to at least neutralize others from joining the opposition. These create improvised temporary coalitions whose shapes shift as you move down the ballot.\nAdvertisement\nAll the gnarly details of the issue questions on the state ballot and the most important local ones\nMeet the players\nBallot-measure politics is built around interest groups, which typically play a more active role than they do in campaigns for office. (Many of the usual campaign-finance restrictions on races involving candidates and parties, including limits on political activity by nonprofits, do not apply here.)\nBelow we\u2019ll introduce you to some of the biggest players in California\u2019s ballot measure politics. These groups can bring different assets to a campaign it supports: money, paid or volunteer manpower, a contact list of sympathetic voters and potential volunteers, influence with media outlets that issue their own endorsement and credibility with voters who often arrive at these arcane, complex policy questions without any preexisting attitudes or loyalties.\nWe\u2019ve assigned each player a unique silhouette \u2013 and we\u2019ll walk you through how they come together to make more complex coalition shapes.\nCalifornia Democratic Party\nThe state's donkey-mascoted party, with big legislative majorities and the gov's mansion\nCalifornia Republican Party\nThe Grand Old Party, slightly out of vogue here but still has big sway especially in rural areas\nCalifornia Teachers Association\nUnion whose members' organizing skills were developed in public school classrooms\nCalifornia Chamber of Commerce\nWhere CEOs go to get their voices heard in the Capitol\nCalifornia Labor Federation\nThe state's House of Labor, bringing together 1,300 unions with 2.3 million workers\nCalifornia Business Roundtable\nBusiness lobbyists with a bit more fight than the Chamber\nCalifornia League of Cities\nHow mayors and city councils get legislators not to dismiss them as local yokels\nLeague of Women Voters\nWhat the suffragists created after they won the right to vote, hoping everyone would use it\nSierra Club\nConservation group that's been around longer than there's been an environmental movement\nSEIU\nUnion representing orderlies, librarians, chefs and other workers who have nothing else in common but service jobs\nHoward Jarvis Taxpayers Association\nAnti-tax crusaders with lots of ballot measure experience, opposing tax increases for just about anything\nACLU\nCivil libertarians known for their lawsuits, but they also do issue politics\nNAACP CA/HI State Conference\nThe country's most famous civil rights group, with less history than the Arkansas chapter but better oceanfront views\nCalifornia Environmental Voters\nGreens focused on mobilizing likeminded voters\nCalifornia College Republicans\nThe youth wing, more reflective of party activists than elected leaders\nPlanned Parenthood\nHate-'em-or-'love-'em health care provider and reproductive-rights advocates\nHere are the local issues we\u2019re seeing pop up in lots of different places at once\nHere are the shapes formed by this year\u2019s ballot coalitions\nMost major groups in the state agree on whether to pass the two bond measures on this year\u2019s ballot. But there are a few conservative and business-oriented groups whose endorsements are split. The Republican Party, Chamber of Commerce and Business Roundtable all back the school-construction Prop 2.\nBut not climate-oriented Prop 4.\nMost of the state\u2019s progressive groups are on board for Prop 3, even ones like California Environmental Voters that don\u2019t have an obvious stake in the issue. That unanimity illustrates how much public opinion has shifted on marriage equality \u2014 and LGBT rights in general have become a core pillar of the modern Democratic coalition.\nBut same-sex marriage still divides the right. The California Republican Party, which has seen fractious fights over how to address the issue in its platform, has chosen to stay away from the Prop 3 scrum while its College Republicans youth wing is opposed. That reflects an enduring divide between elected officials who want to treat the issue as settled and activists more inclined to keep fighting over it.\nThe business community, too, isn\u2019t on the same page when it comes to Prop 3. The California Chamber of Commerce, with close ties to major corporations \u2014 often publicly traded and with large workforces \u2014 is in favor. But the more ideologically driven California Business Roundtable, which more closely aligns with landlords and property managers who don\u2019t have to answer to many employees and investors, isn\u2019t taking a position.\nWhile conservative and business groups all line up against rent control, the issue splits the left. The California Democratic Party and ACLU back Prop 33, but many of their typical allies aren\u2019t with them. The NAACP has come out against, unions like SEIU, the teachers and their umbrella California Labor Federation are staying neutral.\nThe Prop 34 coalitions are a mirror image of Prop 33, because one initiative is basically revenge for the other. Republican and business-oriented groups, including the California Chamber of Commerce and the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, oppose Prop 33 but support Prop 34.\nProp 35, receiving big financial backing from some of the state\u2019s top health-care interests, is one of the only measures this year to win endorsements from both the state\u2019s Democratic and Republican parties.\nProp 36 has been splitting the state\u2019s Democrats, with big-city mayors like San Francisco\u2019s Breed in favor of a harder line on non-violent crime and state officeholders like Newsom opposed. You can see that divide on the endorsements: the Sacramento-based California Democratic Party recommends a vote no while the California League of Cities, which represents local governments, urges a yes vote.\nThe state\u2019s labor unions are largely aligned on this year\u2019s ballot, except when it comes to Prop 36. Teachers and service workers are opposed to the tough-on-crime initiative, while the California Labor Federation \u2014 which in 2020 dramatically severed ties with law-enforcement unions in the name of \u201cracial, social, and economic justice\u201d \u2014 is keeping neutral.\nAdvertisement\nWhere the major players come down on this year\u2019s ballot\nWe tallied up the endorsements of influential groups that weigh in on issue questions."

      "text": "Deal struck to remove homeless hotel housing measure from L.A.\u2019s March ballot\n- Share via\nLos Angeles City Council President Paul Krekorian has struck a deal with the politically powerful hotel workers\u2019 union to remove a measure from the March election ballot that would have required hotels to participate in a city program to put homeless residents in vacant hotel rooms.\nUnder the agreement, the City Council would approve a new package of regulations on the development of new hotels, forcing such projects to go through a more extensive approval process. Hotel developers also would be required to replace any housing that is demolished to make way for their projects, by building new residential units or buying and renovating existing ones.\nIn exchange, the union\u2019s proposal for placing homeless residents in vacant hotel rooms would be explicitly listed as voluntary, a move that would cause it to resemble Inside Safe, the program created by Mayor Karen Bass to combat homelessness. Hotel owners are willing participants in that program.\nUnite Here Local 11, which represents 32,000 hospitality workers in Southern California and Arizona, praised the agreement, saying it would ensure that the city places a priority on the creation of housing, not luxury hotels. Many of Unite Here\u2019s members have been unable to find decently priced homes near their jobs, forcing them to endure punishing commutes.\nA controversial measure that would require hotels in Los Angeles to provide vacant rooms to homeless people will go before voters in 2024.\n\u201cWe have said all along that our contract campaign has been about two things: housing for our members where they work and a living wage,\u201d Kurt Petersen, the union\u2019s co-president, said in a statement. \u201cWith this ordinance, we have done more to protect housing than any single contract demand would have done.\u201d\nThe proposal has already received signatures from five other council members \u2014 Hugo Soto-Mart\u00ednez, John Lee, Katy Yaroslavsky, Nithya Raman and Traci Park \u2014 putting it two votes shy of passage. Park, who serves on the council\u2019s trade and tourism committee, said she believes the original measure would have had \u201ccatastrophic consequences\u201d for tourism locally had it won voter approval, by mandating that hotels take in homeless residents without accompanying social services.\n\u201cThe thought of putting individuals, many of whom have very serious mental health and substance abuse issues, [in hotel rooms] without on-site services is a recipe for disaster,\u201d she said.\nWednesday\u2019s deal comes as Unite Here enters its fifth month of rolling strike actions as its members fight for higher wages and better working conditions. So far, four hotels across Southern California have reached salary agreements with the union.\nUnite Here also has been fighting a number of hotel projects that would result in the elimination of low-cost apartments, particularly those covered by the city\u2019s rent stabilization law, which places a cap on yearly rent increases. Under the Krekorian proposal, the city would need to determine whether there is \u201csufficient market demand\u201d for a new hotel project, while also identifying whether it would have an impact on demand for housing, childcare and other services.\nUnite Here has become a major force in L.A. politics, putting hundreds of thousands of dollars into a campaign to last year elect Soto-Mart\u00ednez, a former Unite Here organizer himself. The union is also skilled at gathering signatures for ballot measures in and around L.A.\nLast year, Unite Here qualified a measure for the March ballot requiring the city\u2019s Housing Department to create a new voucher program to serve the city\u2019s unhoused population. Under that proposal, hotel managers would have been tasked with informing the city each day about the number of vacant rooms they had. Hotels also would have been required to accept temporary housing vouchers issued by the city under such a program.\nThe hotel industry responded by launching a publicity campaign against the measure, warning that it would put hotel workers in danger. The campaign repeatedly pointed to problems in the city\u2019s Project Roomkey program, which placed homeless residents in hotels after the outbreak of COVID-19.\nProject Roomkey, which is no longer in effect, generated a spate of internal City Hall reports about property damage, drug use and violence at hotels in downtown, Westlake and the San Fernando Valley.\nHeather Rozman, president and chief executive of the Hotel Assn. of Los Angeles, said her organization is still studying the proposal but commended council members for being willing to \u201clisten to all sides of the issue.\u201d\nInside Safe, the program launched by Bass to combat homelessness, already uses dozens of hotels and motels as temporary housing. Bass, looking to scale back room rental costs, is also working to purchase hotel and motel properties for that program.\nThe proposed ordinance would also require that both hotels and hosts of short-term rentals on platforms such as Airbnb secure operating permits from the Los Angeles Police Department. Both Krekorian and the union said such a move would help neighborhoods fight back against short-term rental properties that have \u201cnuisance\u201d activities, such as drug sales or noisy parties.\n\u201cIrresponsible hotel and short-term rental operators cannot be allowed to endanger the public safety or impair the quality of life in our neighborhoods,\u201d Krekorian said."

It was defeated.\nProposition G would have changed the city of Escondido from a general law city - with most laws set by the California Constitution and state law - to a more autonomous and independent home-rule city with its own charter.[1]\nVoters narrowly rejected a home-rule charter proposal in 2012 by voting against Measure P.\nSupporters claimed a city charter would allow more local control over policies governing the lives of Escondido residents and keep more tax dollars local, while preserving the important rules already in place.[2]\nOpponents argued that voters were right to reject a home-rule charter in 2012, and that they were right to do it again in 2014. They said that it was \"ineffective and unnecessary\" and simply provided more power to the city council, while opening the city up to financial difficulties and dangers due to the lack of state-mandated safeguards, such as a balanced annual budget.[3]\nElection results\n| City of Escondido, Proposition G | ||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Result | Votes | Percentage | ||\n| No | 16,229 | 62.76% | ||\n| Yes | 9,629 | 37.24% |\nElection results via: San Diego County Registrar of Voters\nText of measure\nBallot question\nThe question on the ballot:[1]\n| \u201c |\nShall the City of Escondido be changed from a general law city to a charter city through the adoption of the charter proposed by Resolution 2014-70 of the Escondido City Council?[4] |\n\u201d |\nImpartial analysis\nThe impartial analysis of Proposition G provided by the office of the city attorney is available here.[5]\nFull text\nThe full text of the proposed charter that became city law with Proposition G's approval is available here.\nSupport\nSupporters\nThe following individuals signed the official arguments in favor of Proposition G:[2]\n- Sam Abed, mayor of Escondido\n- Rorie Johnston, president of the Escondido Chamber of Commerce\n- Jose Monforte, Escondido business owner\n- Dennis \"Coach\" Snyder, founder of Escondido Charter High School\n- John Masson, Escondido City Council Member\nArguments in favor\nSupporters argued that having a city charter would give more local control to the policies and government controlling the lives of Escondido residents.[2]\nOfficial arguments\nThe following was submitted as the official arguments in support of Proposition G:[2]\n| \u201c |\nVoting YES to make Escondido a Charter city, empowers our citizens to take control of our city, protect taxpayers, and prevent Sacramento from wasting our tax dollars. After careful study, the City Council voted to ask our residents to choose to become a charter city subject to our state Constitution's \"home rule\" provisions. These provisions are based on the concept that residents of a city, rather than state legislators, best know their city's needs. As a charter city, power over city matters is transferred from the state to our residents through their elected representatives. Sacramento politicians have confiscated city resources to pay for the billion-dollar deficits they\u2019ve created, while creating unfunded mandates on our local government. State lawmakers have imposed numerous statutes governing uncharted cities which reflect the values of a majority in the legislature, not necessarily a majority in Escondido, which is the reason that more than one-half of the state\u2019s population has chosen to adopt charters for their cities. The charter:\nVoters in Carlsbad, Oceanside, Vista, San Marcos, Del Mar, Santee, and San Diego have chosen to become Charter cities. Now it\u2019s our turn. By joining these cities and the majority of California\u2019s citizens, Escondido's voters will claim their right to self-government through home-rule. Vote YES to put Escondido\u2019s priorities ahead of Sacramento\u2019s. YES to local control. YES to taxpayer protection. YES to the Escondido Charter.[4] |\n\u201d |\n| \u2014Sam Abed, Rorie Johnston, Jose Monforte, Dennis \"Coach\" Snyder and John Masson[2] |\nOpposition\nOpponents\nA group called Escondido Citizens Charter Watch opposed Proposition G.[6]\nThe following individuals signed the official arguments in opposition to Proposition G:[3]\n- Olga Diaz, Escondido Deputy Mayor\n- Sid Hollins, former mayor of Escondido\n- John Valdez, professor and Escondido Districting Commissioner\n- Sid Colquitt, retired banker\n- Don Greene, member of the Escondido Taxpayers Association\nArguments against\nOpponents argued that the drafting of the proposed charter did not have enough input from citizens and that the city council simply rehashed the old charter rejected by voters in 2012 under Measure P in order to give themselves more power. Critics also argued that a charter would be \"ineffective and unnecessary.\"[7][6]\nOfficial arguments\nThe following was submitted as the official arguments in opposition to Proposition G:[3]\n| \u201c |\nThere is no public demand for charter status \u2013 the City Council majority put it on the ballot. Not one resident spoke in favor of the change at five public comment opportunities. In 2012, Escondido voters rejected a charter city proposal. So why is it back on the ballot? Proposition G is a power grab, an unnecessary and dangerous change. Like 75% of California cities, Escondido operates under General Law, which protects the taxpayer and has worked well since 1888. But a few bad decisions under a charter can result in a bankrupt Escondido. Ask San Bernardino, Vallejo, or Stockton -- charter cities that went broke. Proposition G contains serious loopholes and weaknesses. There is no reason to rewrite our city\u2019s constitution and grant broad and unrestrained new powers to the City Council. Charter status:\nBecoming a charter city will shift power from the people of Escondido into the hands of a few powerful politicians. Escondido does not need a new constitution!

      "text": "Seattle voters will decide this fall whether to rewrite the city\u2019s approach to taxing businesses, a move that would shift the burden away from small establishments and place it more heavily on those with large amounts of revenue, while bringing in more dollars for the city\u2019s strained budget.\nThe Seattle City Council voted Monday to place the question on this November\u2019s ballot, hours after a new forecast showed the city\u2019s financial outlook in an improved \u2014 if still highly uncertain and precarious \u2014 position than it was in April. The change is largely due to a slightly rosier view of the economy than previously thought.\nTaken together, the upcoming ballot measure and new forecast illustrate just how complex this fall\u2019s budget deliberations will be as City Hall grapples with how to close a more than $200 million gap in an unpredictable economy.\nThe tax proposal came from Mayor Bruce Harrell and Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck. If approved by voters, it would mean 90% of the city\u2019s businesses would pay less in taxes, while 10% would pay more \u2014 sometimes significantly so.\nThe measure attempts to avoid heavy cuts to city staff and services, while reorienting the tax code away from small businesses.\nIt has already stirred debate largely because the tax targets gross revenue, not profit, meaning businesses with high expenses but low margins \u2014 like restaurant groups, grocery stores and hospitals \u2014 will see their total earnings shrink.\nNevertheless, the council and mayor viewed it as the best choice from a limited selection of options.\n\u201cOnce the voters provide us with this tool, we can ensure that critical city services are maintained despite the challenges our budget or the Trump administration presents,\u201d Mercedes Rinck said Monday.\nDriving the push to pass the new tax are unfortunate predictions for the city\u2019s revenues in the coming years, as well as threats from President Donald Trump to cut off federal funds.\nIn April, the city\u2019s Office of Economic and Revenue Forecasts took a pessimistic view of the future, predicting that uncertainty around federal economic policy combined with slowing construction and a payroll tax lagging behind forecasts would lead the city to a $240 million shortfall over the next two years.\nThe tax proposal would address some of the problems; if passed, it\u2019s predicted to bring in about $80 million more a year. Either way, though, the city is likely to need to make cuts. Harrell\u2019s office has already asked departments to mock up cuts of between 2% and 8%.\nOn Monday, the forecast improved. Tariffs have not yet had the inflationary impact forecasters thought they would last spring, and the country has not entered a recession, city analysts concluded. As a result, staff are now recommending the city adopt a more middle-of-the-road view of the future that includes more modest inflation and fewer layoffs. As a result, the anticipated deficit for this year and next is likely closer to $150 million rather than $240 million.\nStill, staff cautioned lawmakers that their predictions could easily turn south. Office vacancies in the Seattle area are some of the highest in the country and sales taxes from construction have plummeted. Out-of-town visitors are also likely to decline while the overall employment picture in Seattle is expected to shrink.\nBeyond local factors, economic analyses are all over the map in their predictions for future inflation and job growth. While prices haven\u2019t jumped in the way some thought they would, that could still come. Meanwhile, the recent jobs numbers were cool, raising fears of a recession.\nSo while the immediate forecast for the city is improved, the range of possibilities is massive \u2014 anywhere from another $140 million in added deficit to a gain of $100 million.\n\u201cWhen developing a budget, decisions should recognize that the risk is really high that there will be a downward revision,\u201d Jan Duras, chief economist with the city\u2019s Office of Economic and Revenue Forecasts, said Monday.\nAdding to the uncertainty is the effect of both the proposed changes to the business tax, as well as the newly passed tax on high-paying companies for social housing.\n\u201cWhat the reaction of large businesses \u2014 the large taxpayers \u2014 will be, is very difficult to predict,\u201d Duras said.\nMeanwhile, 2027 is still looking extremely difficult, with a current projected deficit of $200 million.\nThe council moved the tax proposal forward in a special meeting Monday, the deadline for placing it on the November ballot. Some voted reluctantly, frustrated by the short timeline between its introduction and passage, the specificity of what it could be spent on and the general approach to passing new taxes rather than dissecting the budget.\n\u201cIt is really unacceptable, and it is bad governance, for us to be in a constant deficit because we don\u2019t want to take a hard look at our budget and our programs,\u201d said Councilmember Maritza Rivera, who nevertheless voted yes.\nOthers, though, spoke glowingly of the approach.\n\u201cThis policy, I believe, reflects our collective humanity,\u201d said Councilmember Debora Juarez.\nThe legislation was pared back in recent days to exempt the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and Seattle Children\u2019s hospital.\nThe opinions expressed in reader comments are those of the author only and do not reflect the opinions of The Seattle Times."
