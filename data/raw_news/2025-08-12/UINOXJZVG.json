These include noncompliant products imported from China driving a \u201crace to the bottom,\u201d tariffs and inflation weighing on consumer demand, and the macroeconomic environment requiring the company to seek new opportunities for growth.\n\n\u201cAs we progress through the remainder of the year, we\u2019ll continue to navigate a dynamic macro environment, including ongoing tariff and impact and pricing volatility, with discipline and agility,\u201d Meniane said. \u201cOur focus remains on profitable growth, anchored by the strong foundation we\u2019ve built.\u201d",

      "text": "The eCommerce seller of automotive parts and accessories began this process after receiving inbound strategic inquiries, it said in a Wednesday press release.\nCarParts.com said in the release that it has not set a timeline for completion of the process, that there is no certainty that the process will result in any strategic change, and that it does not intend to provide updates on the process unless and until it enters into definitive agreements or otherwise determines that further disclosure is required by law.\n\u201cOver the last five years, we have made significant investments in building a vertically integrated supply chain with a nationwide fulfillment network to support our best-in-class eCommerce experience, mobile app, as well as our marketplace business,\u201d CarParts.com CEO David Meniane said in the release. \u201cOur future as an independent company is bright. At the same time, we are committed to evaluating a range of strategic alternatives to maximize value for our shareholders.\u201d\nWhen reporting its third quarter financial results in October, CarParts.com said its net sales declined 13% compared to the same quarter the previous year, dropping to $144.8 million, and had a net loss of $10 million.\nThe company said in an Oct. 29 press release that the sales decrease was driven by deliberate price increases to focus on higher value customers, support gross margin expansion, and deal with a continued challenging consumer environment in the industry and one-time impacts from the CrowdStrike issue and hurricanes Helene and Milton.\nDespite these challenges, the number of cumulative downloads of the company\u2019s mobile app more than doubled at the start of the year to surpass 550,000.\nMeniane said during an Oct. 29 earnings call that the company had been working on re-platforming CarParts.com to increase performance and shorten its development cycles.\n\u201cWe expect to emerge from this transition period, positioned to capture the growing opportunity in front of us within a fragmented and underserved $400 billion auto parts market,\u201d Meniane said during the call. \u201cCustomers value our offering, and our business model is highly differentiated, scalable and difficult to replicate.\u201d\nCarParts.com will report its fourth quarter 2024 financial results March 25."
