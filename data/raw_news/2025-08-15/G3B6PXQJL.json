  "content": "Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nThe U.S. government does not have enough BTC to achieve the Trump administration\u2019s goal of being \"the Bitcoin superpower of the world,\" says Bitcoin maximalist and Zap CEO Jack Mallers.\n\nThis, according to Mallers, is the real reason why the government has yet to disclose its Bitcoin holdings.\n\n\"I think that the US government is ashamed of its Bitcoin position,\" Mallers said in a video he shared last week on X. \"It wants to be a leader.\"\n\u2022 The same firms that backed Uber, Venmo and eBay are investing in this pre-IPO company disrupting a $1.8T market \u2014 and you can too at just $2.90/share.\n\u2022 Named a TIME Best Invention and Backed by 5,000+ Users, Kara's Air-to-Water Pod Cuts Plastic and Costs \u2014 And You Can Invest At Just $6.37/Share\n\nMallers speculated that the government would not disclose its holdings till it built a position it could be proud of.\n\n\"I think that that\u2019s sensitive information, because the US government wants to be the Bitcoin superpower, and what they realized is their holdings are a threat to that brand identity,\" he said, referencing recent statements from now former Presidential Council of Advisers on Digital Assets Executive Director Bo Hines. \"They don\u2019t want to make an announcement until they can build the position back.\"\n\nWhen asked last week how much Bitcoin the U.S. government held, Hines evaded the question.\n\n\"I can\u2019t discuss that right now,\" he told \"Crypto In America\" host Jacquelyn Melinek, adding, \"there are several reasons we're not disclosing at this time. There might be a time in which we do.\"\n\nTrending: \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.30/share.\n\nThe U.S.'s Bitcoin holdings have long been a hot topic, but interest has spiked with President Donald Trump\u2018s establishment of a strategic national reserve from seized assets in March.\n\nFor the longest time, market participants believed that the government controlled roughly 200,000 BTC, based on data from cryptocurrency platform Arkham.\n\nBut they have grown doubtful as a report by The Rage last month suggested that the Marshals Service held only about 29,000 BTC, barely 15% of the figure suggested by Arkham. The disparity has been widely attributed to the firm\u2019s inability to distinguish between seized and forfeited assets held in government wallets.",

      "text": "White House-appointed \u2018AI and Crypto Czar' David Sacks revealed that President Donald Trump signed an Executive Order to establish a Strategic Bitcoin BTC/USD Reserve on Thursday, a move that will not cost taxpayers.\nWhat Happened: In an X post, Sacks stated that the reserve will be funded with Bitcoin owned by the federal government, obtained through criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings. \u201cThis means it will not cost taxpayers a dime,\u201d he added. The U.S. government is estimated to own about 200,000 bitcoin, but a complete audit has never been conducted. The Executive Order directs a full accounting of the government\u2019s digital asset holdings. The reserve is worth approximately $17 billion at prevailing price for the apex cryptocurrency.\nAccording to Sacks, the U.S. will not sell any Bitcoin deposited into the Reserve, instead keeping it as a store of value. He likened the Reserve to a \u201cdigital Fort Knox\u201d for the cryptocurrency often referred to as \u201cdigital gold.\u201d\nSee Also: Microsoft May Have Given Bitcoin Investments A Miss But A Large MSFT Stock Holder Is A Strong Crypto, Blockchain Advocate\n\u201cThe Secretaries of Treasury and Commerce are authorized to develop budget-neutral strategies for acquiring additional bitcoin, provided that those strategies have no incremental costs on American taxpayers,\u201d Sacks mentioned.\nAdditionally, the Order establishes a U.S. Digital Asset Stockpile, consisting of digital assets other than Bitcoin that were forfeited in criminal or civil proceedings.\n\u201cVery good. I made the promise, right,\u201d Trump said in a video released by Margo Martin, special assistant to the president.\nPrice Action: At the time of writing, Bitcoin was exchanging hands at $86,652.93, down 3.84% in the last 24 hours, according to data from Benzinga Pro.\nImage via Shutterstock\nRead Next:\nThis story was generated using Benzinga Neuro and edited by Aniket Verma\nEdge Rankings\nPrice Trend\n\u00a9 2025 Benzinga.com.
