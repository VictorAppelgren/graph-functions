Delaying kindergarten for one year, a process known as \u201credshirting,\u201d is one of the latest issues for the growing parents' rights movement, which has been dominated by public school parents who want more control over what their children learn and where they go to school.

      "text": "Trump may reclassify marijuana as less dangerous drug. Is that a good thing?\nPresident Donald Trump is looking to reclassify marijuana as a less dangerous drug under federal law.\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House briefing room on Aug. 11, Trump said a decision could come within the next couple of weeks.\nSince 1970, the federal government has classified marijuana as a Schedule I drug, which is defined as highly dangerous, addictive and without medical use. In 2024, the Drug Enforcement Administration proposed a rule to transfer marijuana to Schedule III, which includes drugs like ketamine and testosterone.\nTrump said the decision is complicated, weighing the benefits of marijuana use for medical reasons against potential societal impacts.\n\"Some people like it, some people hate it. Some people hate the whole concept of marijuana,\" he said.\nFor the most part, the move would be good for science, research and medicine, said Raphael Cuomo, biomedical scientist and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine.\n\u201cRescheduling would make it easier to study potential benefits and harms across conditions, which could improve dosing guidance and drug interaction data in oncology, pain and palliative care,\u201d he said.\nIt would also likely improve quality control for cannabinoids that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration and speed up high-quality clinical trials to improve product standardization and \u201canswer clinical questions that matter to patients,\u201d Cuomo said.\nBut it\u2019s not all good.\nCuomo said reclassifying marijuana could be perceived as a \u201csafety endorsement\" as rates of heavy and daily use continue to climb.\nIn 2022, marijuana surpassed high-frequency drinking for the first time, according to a 2024 study published in the journal Addiction. An estimated 17.7 million people used marijuana daily or near-daily, compared to 14.7 million daily or near-daily drinkers.\nFrom 1992 to 2022, the per capita rate of reporting daily or near-daily marijuana use increased 15-fold, the study found. About 40% of cannabis users reported doing it daily or nearly daily.\nResearch has shown long-term or heavy cannabis use can cause brain and mental health effects such as memory problems, psychotic disorders and psychosis, according to the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment.\nIt can also irritate the lungs, leading to a daily cough, bronchitis, mucus and wheezing, and may carry some cardiovascular risks, according to recent research. Some people who use cannabis heavily can start vomiting without being able to stop, a condition called Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome, which can be reversed by stopping marijuana use.\nIf the administration decides to reclassify marijuana, Cuomo said officials should also focus public messaging efforts to include warnings for youth, pregnancy, driving and individuals with a history of psychosis.\n\"Risk perception often moves faster than policy,\" he said.\nContributing: Sarah D. Wire, USA TODAY; Reuters.\nAdrianna Rodriguez can be reached at adrodriguez@usatoday.com."

      "text": "When will Tropical Storm Erin become a hurricane?\nHurricane forecasters say Tropical Storm Erin is set to strengthen into a hurricane and then a major hurricane within a matter of days.\nThe storm is spinning out in the Atlantic and forecasts show a track heading toward the United States. But with great uncertainty in the long-term forecast track, it's too early to know what impact, if any, Erin will have.\nAs of 11 a.m. on Aug. 12, the National Hurricane Center predicts the storm will reach hurricane intensity on Thursday, Aug. 14, and become a major hurricane on Sunday, Aug. 17.\nHurricanes have winds of 74 mph or higher and major hurricanes have winds of 111 mph or higher.\nThe storm, which formed near the Cabo Verde Islands off the West African Coast, is likely to be the first major Atlantic hurricane of the season, forecasters say.\nWarm ocean waters and low wind shear are helping Erin along, according to AccuWeather.com.\nAs is often the case with Atlantic hurricanes, Erin's path will be primarily determined by the strength of the Bermuda High, a semi-permanent ridge of high pressure that sits over the Atlantic Ocean in the summer.\nThe stronger the Bermuda High, the more of a threat Erin is to the United States. A weaker Bermuda High is better news.\n\"Erin will be guided along by the northeast trade winds initially and then the clockwise circulation around the massive Bermuda High over the central Atlantic,\" AccuWeather lead hurricane expert Alex DaSilva said.\n\u201cErin will bring gusty wind and heavy rain to northern Puerto Rico as it passes to the north this weekend,\" DaSilva said in an email. One to 2 inches of rain is expected on the northern side of the island, but there may be pockets that see as much as 7 inches of rain, bringing the risk of flash flooding, DaSilva added. Winds could gust to 80 mph, triggering some power outages as well.\nMap shows Erin forecast track\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm. It does not illustrate the full width of the storm or its impacts, and the center of the storm is likely to travel outside the cone up to 33% of the time.\nContributing: Chris Cann, Doyle Rice and Joel Shannon"

      "text": "Will higher prices steal your kid's lunch money? Why more parents are willing to pack.\nPerla Lozano's two kids are about to start school on Aug. 14. They'll be taking a lunch that their mom packs for them every day, even though the cost of brown-bagging is likely more expensive than buying a lunch at school \u2012 and the costs are going up.\nThe rising price tags for food and other goods due to inflation and tariffs are also affecting the cost of home-packed school lunches. But parents like Lozano say they're willing to make cuts elsewhere in their budget to ensure their kids are eating a healthy meal.\nIn its latest survey of 1,203 caregivers of school-aged children, the 2025 Deloitte Back to School survey found that nearly half (48%) of parents and caregivers said the cost of lunch on school days will likely be higher than last year. But 42% of the respondents said they would continue to pack their students' midday meal.\nAccording to an analysis by Deloitte examining three years of lunch-related food prices, this year's average daily cost across brown-bag school lunch options the company studied is $6.15. Compared to the start of school last year, Deloitte said packing a lunch is expected to cost 3% more on average, or slightly higher than food-at-home inflation overall.\nThe company looked at a variety of packed lunches for the index, including the classic peanut butter and jelly sandwich, a more contemporary lunch featuring a chicken and avocado quesadilla, a health and wellness lunch centered on a salad, and a \"convenience\" lunch built around a prepacked meat, cheese and crackers kit.\nBut the rise in costs is still lower than the uptick two years ago. The cost of the average index lunch at the start of the 2023 school year was up 6% from the previous year.\nClassic peanut butter and jelly lunch is more expensive\nAlthough the classic peanut butter and jelly lunch with the sandwich, baby carrots, apples, cookies and milk still is the cheapest of the four options reviewed by Deloitte at $4.84, it also had the steepest rise in cost in 2025 (6% year over year). That is driven by higher retail prices for apples, jelly and single-serve milk cartons, Deloitte said.\nThe \"contemporary day\" packed lunch of a chicken and avocado quesadilla, dipping salsa, mango, a brownie and juice will cost $7.30, according to Deloitte. That's up 2% from the previous year.\nA \"health and wellness day\" lunch of a bagged salad kit, hummus, pretzels, mandarin orange, yogurt and seltzer water will cost $6.54, up 1%. A \"convenience day\" lunch of a meat, cheese and crackers lunch kit, fruit cup, pudding cup and a can of soda will cost $5.92, up 2.2% from last year.\nIn comparison, Deloitte said the average cost for lunch obtained at school is $2.99, and it is sometimes free if the student qualifies. Just over half of respondents said their school offers free lunch to all students, regardless of income.\n\"No one knows exactly where prices are headed next, but following a drop in February, prices for all four lunches are on an upward trend, rising an average of 5.5%,\" Deloitte said in its study, \"Will higher prices steal your kid's lunch money?\"\nParents say packing a lunch is better value and variety\nAlthough school-provided lunches are almost always cheaper or free compared to brown-bagging or packing a lunch at home, 4 in 10 respondents to Deloitte's survey (42%) said they make their kids' lunch. Most respondents said they think they get better value from bringing a lunch (63%) and more variety (52%). A majority, or 69%, of respondents with children who take their lunch from home rated those meals higher for superior taste relative to cafeteria food.\n\u201cParents are packing lunches with both wallets and wellness in mind,\" Natalie Martini, vice chair and U.S. Retail & Consumer Products sector leader for Deloitte, told USA TODAY.\n\"Parents and caregivers want to ensure their kids are eating healthy, quality lunches during the school day, and they believe bringing lunch from home is the way to do that,\" she said.\nParents are also seeking value everywhere they can, even with their kids\u2019 school lunches, Martini said. \"However, they don\u2019t want this to come at the expense of the nutritional value of the lunch. As a mom of two middle schoolers, I know my kids do better in school when they\u2019re eating a healthy and nutritious lunch.\"\n\"Parents may look to swap name-brand snacks for private labels or opt for cheaper main entrees to make a healthy lunchbox on a budget,\" Martini said. Thirty-one percent might opt for the private labels, while 24% might aim for less expensive entrees. Another 27% said they would substitute a cheaper main lunch item.\nFamily makes sacrifices elsewhere to offset rising food costs\nLozano, of Sylmar, California, said she will continue to pack a homemade lunch for her two children, even though the family of four has had to cut back on other parts of their monthly budget to account for rising food costs.\nLozano packs lunches for Aleny, 13, and Adrian, 9, each morning. Their lunches are usually hot meals and leftovers from a healthy meal Lozano cooked for dinner the night before. Often, it will be something like meat with vegetables or fried rice. The midday meal always includes vegetables and fruit and a protein.\nOn Fridays, Lozano will do sandwiches, but even those will be homemade, without a crust, instead of store-bought. Lozano said it not only keeps the cost down to make the sandwiches herself, but she knows the ingredients are healthy and without added preservatives or other ingredients she is trying to avoid.\nStill, \"it's gotten really pricey because it's getting harder to put together healthy lunches like fruits and vegetables as opposed to the junk,\" Lozano told USA TODAY.\nShe and her husband, Adrian, are willing to make sacrifices in other parts of their family's budget to provide healthy food for their family throughout the day. They've cut back on violin lessons for the kids, going from weekly to bi-weekly. And they've cut down to just one streaming service.\n\"We've cut back on everything else so we can afford good food for our kids,\" she said.\nHere are some other highlights from Deloitte's study:\n\u25feThree in 4 caregivers think there should be more fresh food in school-provided lunches.\n\u25feFifty-seven percent of respondents would like more locally-sourced cafeteria food and they\u2019re willing to pay more for it.\n\u25feOverall, most (82%) parents and caregivers would like their kids to eat healthier during the school day.\n\u25feChanges made to food budgets or shopping choices can differ by generation: half of Gen Z caregivers (56%), more than three times higher than any other generation, said they would switch to more school-provided lunches, while millennials were the most willing to cut back on buying fresh food to reduce the cost of perishable food waste (29%).\nBetty Lin-Fisher is a consumer reporter for USA TODAY.

      "text": "What is redshirting? The controversy for parents' rights causes stir in Washington, DC\nDC Public Schools officials said schools will more strictly enforce a policy disallowing parents from delaying toddlers' kindergarten start date.\nJennifer Lilintahl said she knew her 5-year-old daughter wasn't ready to learn how to read with other kids her age in the kindergarten classes last school year at Lafayette Elementary School in the Chevy Chase neighborhood of Washington, D.C.\nAlthough her daughter was eligible to attend kindergarten due to her age, Lilintahl enrolled her daughter in a mostly play-based pre-kindergarten class at a local preschool for the third year in a row.\nThis January, Lilintahl emailed the school's principal to say her now almost-6-year-old daughter is ready for kindergarten this fall. But the principal said the girl must enroll in first grade for the 2025-2026 school year, which begins on Aug. 25, because she'll be 6 years old in September.\nLilantahl was dismayed. She thought it wouldn't be an issue because she knows other parents from the district who had previously delayed their child's start of kindergarten by one year.\nSeveral other parents made similar requests to enroll their nearly 6-year-old children in kindergarten for the 2025-2026 school year. Their requests led DC Public Schools officials to say in the 2024-2025 spring semester the district is going to more strictly enforce an existing policy that disallows parents from delaying their children's kindergarten start date, said Evan Lambert, a district spokesperson. That means parents who don't enroll their kids in kindergarten when the district says they are supposed to will have to forego that year, he said.\nTypically, kids in states where kindergarten is required start when they are 5 years old before a certain cutoff date, which ranges from August to December. If their schools allow, parents can choose to delay their required kindergarten start date to the next school year, which is a practice in schools widely known as \"redshirting.\"\nOpponents of redshirting often argue it creates inequities among schoolchildren because it gives older kids an upper hand when they enter kindergarten. Recent national test score data shows the achievement gap among the nation's highest and lowest learners in American schools has widened over the last several years.\nThose who support the practice often say parents are not trying to take advantage of the system, but that they are best able to determine whether or not they are ready for the academic rigor of kindergarten, including the social and developmental expectations of those classrooms.\nLilintahl is adamant that her family is not trying to give her daughter an upper hand by making her the older student in class. She said her daughter genuinely deserved and needed the extra year in pre-kindergarten and she consulted with the young girl's nursery teacher and pediatrician about her worries, who agreed with her.\nShe has petitioned the district's decision and joined other parents to protest this enforcement of the policy. The school principal Katie Prall sent her family a final rejection letter, which Lilanthal provided to USA TODAY, on Aug. 4. In the letter, Prall says she and staff \"reviewed all relevant evidence,\" including test scores, past education and input from parents before making its decision.\nLilantahl said she's \"really angry\" and said the principal and school district for \"being so rigid and illogical.\"\n\"This is not only setting her up for failure for first grade, but for her entire education as well as the rest of the classroom,\" Lilintahl said. \"We\u2019re really angry, to put it bluntly, at this principal and the school district for being so rigid and illogical.\"\nLambert told USA TODAY that district officials cannot comment on the case, citing student privacy laws.\nThe district \"is committed to ensuring every student has access to a great education in our schools,\" he said.\n\"DCPS assigns grade levels based on age to make certain students are placed with their peers and in alignment with district education standards,\" he wrote in an email. \"In rare cases, school-based teams may determine\u2014based on evaluations comprising observation and formal assessments\u2014that a different grade placement is appropriate after enrollment. Families are encouraged to enroll and work with their school team.\"\nThe controversy in the nation's capital over delaying schooling illuminates tension between schools that want kids to attend the grade they qualify for and parents who say they know best for their child.\nThe debate is one of the latest issues for the growing parents' rights movement, which has been dominated by public school parents who want more control over what their children learn and where they go to school. For them, deciding when their kids start school is now not up up for debate.\nAriel Taylor Smith, senior director of the National Parents Union Center for Policy and Action, said parents should have the right to choose when their kids start kindergarten. Some kids need the \"additional year of schooling\" in pre-kindergarten and parents and their communities often know better than a school district, she said. She argues that not giving parents the choice will lead those who have the means and access to leave public school districts.\n\"Kids will go to private schools if they're not allowing an extra year,\" she said. Public school enrollment is already on the decline and national data shows public schools are expected to lose 4 million kids by 2031. The drop is due in part to declining birth rates and more access to other types of schools, including private and parochial schools, in regions with school vouchers and other choice programs. School districts often receive less money when students leave their schools because many state funding models are based on either enrollment or attendance.\nThough some principals have allowed redshirting in DC Public Schools in the past, that will no longer be the case, unless there is an exception in rare cases, Lambert said.\nLambert cited a local law that says all children who live in the region are required to attend school beginning the school year \"in which the child is or has become five years old by September 30.\"\nAt a June 23 news conference, Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser said \"we shouldn't have a policy to say we want some kids to be advantaged to the disadvantage of other kids.\"\nMoving forward, the district will strictly follow the law by assigning age-centered grade levels, Lambert said.\nWhy redshirting draws both opposition and support\nAbout 1 in 10 parents said in a survey they delayed their child's kindergarten start date during the 2021-2022 school year, with a majority indicating their kids' weren't emotionally or academically ready or they were too young. The research, published by EdChoice, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that advocates for school vouchers, and conducted by Morning Consult, shows 1 in 5 parents surveyed were influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. An older academic journal article, published in 2013, said about 5% of kids in the United States were redshirted each year.\nRedshirting sets up a clash between the parent who says they want to do the best thing for their kids and those who are concerned about inequity between kids from families of different means, said Deborah Stipek, a professor of education at the Stanford University Graduate School of Education. Wealthier families have more access to childcare, which gives them more flexibility to delay school, she said.\n\"I'm sympathetic with parents who want to redshirt their child, but on a broad scale, the issue is that it does create some inequities, because parents who are able to hold kids back are able to provide more resources and have childcare resources,\" she said. \"On average, kids who come from low-income families already start with fewer foundational skills than those with more affluent families. If kids with more affluent families come in at an older age, it creates a bigger gap.\"\nParents often delay their child's kindergarten year when they believe they are developmentally behind or want them to have an extra year of schooling. Stipek pointed to research that shows boys from affluent families are more often redshirted by parents who think the delay could give them a competitive edge.\n\"Boys tend to be a little behind girls on average,\" Stipek said.\nStipek and others who've researched the effects of redshirting for decades call it a nuanced and complicated issue for parents and schools because there's not a clear \"readiness\" indicator for kindergarten.\n\"I think we\u2019ve decided to use age, because as imperfect as it is, it\u2019s reputable,\" Stipek said. \"But the problem is there's huge variability in kids\u2019 readiness for a more structured educational environment.\"\nWhether schools choose to allow for redshirting or not, they need to better prepare their kindergarten teachers to educate children from different ages and skill levels, she said.\n\"I think the real issue is not should all kids be required to enter at a particular age,\" Stipek said. \"The real question is how are we creating educational environments to adapt to kids differences when they want in the door.\"\nKindergarten has changed over time. The first year of a child's academic career used to be more play-based, but now there's more of a focus on academics, said Christopher Brown, a professor of early childhood education at the University of Texas at Austin. That's largely because average reading scores have declined and there's more pressure on teachers to make sure kids are ready for assessments.\n\"Elementary schools are worried about test scores and policymakers view it through the lens of academic achievement,\" he said.\nEven so, kindergarten teachers have told Brown that kids come into their classes with a range of foundational skills regardless of their ages.\n\"Schools should consider how ready they are to support kids and families when they walk in the doors and helping them get where they need to be,\" Brown said.\nHistorically, research on redshirting has shown that kids who entered kindergarten a year later than their peers \"score a little higher,\" he said. \"But that usually evens out in upper grades.\"\nWhere is redshirting allowed or banned?\nAmong the states where kindergarten is required, policies on the practice vary widely by school community. The option of choice largely depends on where families live, and some states do not require kindergarten at all.\nStates and school districts largely determine whether or not students are allowed to start kindergarten at a later date than their peers.\n\"Oklahoma, for instance, requires children to enroll in half-day kindergarten in the school year after they turn five (September 1 birthday cutoff), but parents are allowed to delay their child\u2019s kindergarten entry by a year at their own discretion by submitting a form,\" Richard V. Reeves, president of the American Institute for Boys and Men, wrote in a commentary for the Brookings Institution.\nFor parents who are questioning whether or not to delay their kid's kindergarten start date, Brown said to research what options and type of kindergarten classes their local school offers, to talk to other adults who may know what's best for the child, including a preschool teacher, and to consider those choices early. They should also consider whether or not they have the childcare resources to keep their kids out of kindergarten an extra year.\n\"Then consider, do we think little Johnny\u2019s ready for school?\" he said. \"A lot of parents don\u2019t start thinking about it until their kid is 4. Be informed, make a decision, and once you make it, support it.\"\nBrown said he's personally \"always been an advocate that if you feel like they\u2019re ready, send them.\"\nNo matter what parents choose, Brown said parents should be confident about their decision because kids can sense when their parents have doubts about their awareness of their abilities. That can take a toll on their self-esteem and academic and developmental skills.\nLilintahl said she wants to avoid future learning setbacks for her daughter. The district tested her 5-year-old daughter on July 29 to determine her readiness for school, and she failed the reading portion of the test, she said.\nThe mother said she'll continue to fight the district's decision, and has expressed her frustration with jurisdiction officials, but she's \"lost a lot of trust in the school and principal.\"\nFirst grade isn't an option for their family.\n\"She doesn't know how to read,\" Lilintahl said.\nContact Kayla Jimenez at kjimenez@usatoday.com.

      "text": "Trump hints at marijuana policy shift. What to know about THC\nPresident Donald Trump is considering reclassifying marijuana as a less dangerous drug.\nYes, though 45 states have legalized the use of marijuana for medicinal or recreational use, the federal government still classifies it as a Schedule I drug. In 2023, Health and Human Services recommended that marijuana be moved to Schedule III. In 2024, DEA proposed a rule to transfer marijuana to Schedule III. That rule change has been on hold since March 2025.\nIf all things marijuana sound confusing, it's not just you. No judgments here. But we'll help you out: We're answering your burning questions about THC.\nTetrahydrocannabinol, known colloquially as THC, isn't new. But more medical researchers are diving into learning more about how the drug affects the human body.\nAmong health experts, the jury is still out on THC, CBD and the use of marijuana in general, as those in medical and research fields (and in politics) weigh the benefits and risks.\n\"This is the big challenge with cannabis: How do we facilitate the beneficial medical applications, allow for what society has determined is acceptable recreational use and also guard against the very real harms?\" Gregory Tung, an associate professor at the Colorado School of Public Health who holds a doctorate in health policy, previously told USA TODAY. \"This is difficult and will likely require a mix of policy, rules, regulations and education.\"\nHere's what experts want you to know about THC.\nWhat is THC?\nIn plain terms, THC is the part of cannabis that gets you high.\n\"People take and justify the use of cannabis medicinally for a wide range of reasons and ailments,\" he adds. \"What is supported in the scientific literature is much more limited. One of the areas that has the strongest scientific evidence is pain control and management. Recreationally, some people 'enjoy' the high.\"\nA 2023 meta-analysis of studies on cannabis's impact on health concluded that it can be beneficial in managing pain for people with several health conditions, but not without side effects. Experts as a whole say more research needs to be conducted to give a conclusive answer about benefits and risks.\nWhat is the safest THC product to buy?\nHealth experts including Tracy Smith, an associate professor at Medical University of South Carolina Hollings Cancer Center who holds a doctorate in biological and health psychology, hesitated to label one THC product as the \"safest,\" in a previous conversation with USA TODAY, because there still isn't much research on its health effects \u2013 especially long-term health effects.\nSticking to products with a lower concentration of THC, or consuming smaller amounts of THC in general is \"relatively less risky,\" Tung says.\nEach form of marijuana consumption offers pros and cons when it comes to dosing versus exposure to dangerous compounds, he adds.\nSmoking a joint may allow someone to pace themselves more effectively, because the high comes along faster than other forms. But, Tung notes, the act of inhaling combusted marijuana is \"very damaging.\"\nEdibles, by comparison, eliminate the dangers of inhaling combustion by-products. But the fact that they're metabolized much more slowly makes it more difficult to self-regulate dosage, Tung says.\nConcentrates, which are typically consumed via vaping, are \"likely the most dangerous\" option, Tung says, because they contain very high levels of THC. The National Institute on Drug Abuse notes that more research is needed, but that it appears high concentrations of THC can increase the likelihood of developing addiction, as well as experiencing side effects such as anxiety, agitation, paranoia and psychosis.\nSeveral experts \u2013 including those at the Colorado School of Public Health's Cannabis Research and Policy Project and the authors of the 2023 meta-analysis \u2013 say research supports the idea that young people and those who are pregnant are among the populations who should avoid cannabis as a whole because of high risks and harms.\nContributing: Sarah D.

Forecasters said Erin is moving west at 22 mph, and this motion is expected to continue for the next several days.\n\"Gradual strengthening is forecast over the next several days, and Erin is expected to become a hurricane in the next couple of days,\" the hurricane center said in the advisory.\nA windspeed forecast from the hurricane center says Erin could become a hurricane on Thursday, Aug. 14.\nFederal meteorologists added that the official intensity forecast \"shows Erin becoming a major hurricane in around 5 days.\" A major hurricane is a term used for cyclones that are rated a Category 3 or higher, indicating they have damaging winds over 110 mph.\nWith great uncertainty in the long-term forecast track, it's too early to know what impact, if any, Erin will have on the Caribbean or the eastern U.S.\nMeanwhile, in the Gulf, a surface trough in the north-central Gulf is associated with a broad area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms. The system is not expected to develop before it moves inland, although locally heavy rainfall could produce flash flooding across portions of the Florida Panhandle, southern Alabama, southern Mississippi, and southeastern Louisiana over the next day or so, according to the hurricane center.\nLastly, the hurricane center said it is keeping an eye on a non-tropical area of low pressure located a few hundred miles southeast of Nova Scotia, Canada.\n\"Some limited tropical or subtropical development is possible over the next day or so as the low meanders near the relatively warm waters of the Gulf Stream,\" the NHC said, however the system is forecast to move northward over cooler waters, ending its chances of further tropical development.\nTropical Storm Erin path tracker\nThis forecast track shows the most likely path of the center of the storm.

There are currently no threats to land stemming from Henriette.\nHow do hurricanes form?\nHurricanes are born in the tropics, above warm water. Clusters of thunderstorms can develop over the ocean when water temperatures exceed 80 degrees Fahrenheit. If conditions are right, the clusters swirl into a storm known as a tropical wave or tropical depression.\nA tropical depression becomes a named tropical storm once its sustained wind speeds reach 39 miles per hour. When its winds reach 74 mph, the storm officially becomes a hurricane.\nPrepare now for hurricanes\nDelaying potentially life-saving preparations could mean waiting until it\u2019s too late. \"Get your disaster supplies while the shelves are still stocked, and get that insurance checkup early, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period,\" NOAA recommends.\n- Develop an evacuation plan: If you are at risk from hurricanes, you need an evacuation plan. Now is the time to begin planning where you would go and how you would get there.\n- Assemble disaster supplies: Whether you\u2019re evacuating or sheltering-in-place, you\u2019re going to need supplies not just to get through the storm but for the potentially lengthy aftermath, NOAA said.\n- Get an insurance checkup and document your possessions: Contact your insurance company or agent now and ask for an insurance check-up to make sure you have enough insurance to repair or even replace your home and/or belongings. Remember, home and renters insurance doesn\u2019t cover flooding, so you\u2019ll need a separate policy for it. Flood insurance is available through your company, agent, or the National Flood Insurance Program. Act now, as flood insurance requires a 30-day waiting period.\n- Create a family communication plan: NOAA said to take the time now to write down your hurricane plan, and share it with your family. Determine family meeting places, and make sure to include an out-of-town location in case of evacuation.\n- Strengthen your home: Now is the time to improve your home\u2019s ability to withstand hurricane impacts.

And \"ironically, I went to her and Brad (Pitt)'s engagement party,\" Aniston, 56, said.\n\"Oh, of course,\" the actress replied when asked whether they ever talk about their shared ex. \"How can we not? We\u2019re girls.\" But, more than anything, \"we\u2019re always swapping advice \u2014 'What are you doing for this? What are you doing for that? Do you have a new doctor for that?'\"\nPaltrow, 52, and Pitt, 61, were a Hollywood it couple after costarring in David Fincher's 1995 film \"Se7en\" and were engaged in 1996. They split a few months later. At the height of her \"Friends\" fame, Aniston married Pitt in 2000; they divorced in 2005. The \"Fight Club\" actor began a relationship with \"Mr. & Mrs. Smith\" costar Angelina Jolie soon afterward.\nCalling this era of her love life being splashed across tabloids \"the love triangle,\" Aniston told Vanity Fair her survival strategy was to \"Just pick yourself up by the bootstraps and keep on walking, girl.\"\n\"It was such juicy reading for people. If they didn\u2019t have their soap operas, they had their tabloids,\" she said. \"It\u2019s a shame that it had to happen,\" she added of the public nature of the breakup, \"but it happened. And boy did I take it personally.\"\nThese days, her focus is on \"metaphysical things and 'What if there\u2019s something bigger out there than all of us?'\" Of fame, she said: \"It\u2019s not real. ... My interests are other than that.\"\nJennifer Aniston was 'mourning' Mathew Perry before death\nElsewhere in the interview, Aniston shared how she and other \"Friends\" costars attempted to help Matthew Perry as he battled addiction over the years.\nPerry died in October 2023 at 54. He was found unresponsive and face-down in the \"heated end\" of his pool, and the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner's office later revealed that his cause of death was due to \"the acute effects of ketamine.\"\n\"We did everything we could when we could,\" Aniston told Vanity Fair. \"But it almost felt like we\u2019d been mourning Matthew for a long time because his battle with that disease was a really hard one for him to fight. As hard as it was for all of us and for the fans, there's a part of me that thinks this is better.\"\n\"I'm glad he\u2019s out of that pain,\" she added."

      "text": "Why Emma Stone got emotional before shaving her head for new film\nHair today, gone tomorrow.\nEmma Stone underwent a dramatic transformation for her latest film \"Bugonia,\" for which she shaved her head on camera. In her September issue cover story interview with Vogue published on Aug. 11, the two-time Oscar winner, 36, raved about the haircut and said there is \"no better feeling in the world.\" She added, \"The first shower when you've shaved your head? Oh my God, it's amazing.\"\nStill, Stone told Vogue she burst into tears before filming the scene where she shaved her head because she was thinking about her mom, who lost her hair while battling breast cancer. \"She actually did something brave,\" Stone said. \"I'm just shaving my head.\" According to the actress, her mother's reaction to her \"Bugonia\" look was to say, \"I'm so jealous. I want to shave my head again.\"\nAccording to Vogue, a scene in \"Bugonia\" involves Stone's character, a pharmaceutical CEO who is held hostage, having her head shaved by her kidnappers. Her friend Jennifer Lawrence joked to Vogue that she \"really didn't want her to shave her head\" after having \"already lived through the Billie Jean King haircut,\" referring to Stone's look for the 2017 tennis drama \"Battle of the Sexes.\" But \"she looked beautiful\" and \"pulled it off,\" Lawrence noted.\nStone previously sparked rumors that she had shaved her head after attending the New York Film Festival in 2024 wearing what appeared to be a wig. She later debuted a pixie cut at January's Golden Globe Awards. Stone told Vogue her hair has been growing back \"pretty slowly for how long it's been.\"\n\"Bugonia\" is Stone's latest collaboration with director Yorgos Lanthimos, whose last three films have all starred the actress: 2018's \"The Favourite,\" 2023's \"Poor Things\" and 2024's \"Kinds of Kindness.\" She won her second best actress Oscar for her performance in \"Poor Things\" and earned a best supporting actress nomination for \"The Favourite.\"\nIn \"Bugonia,\" \"two conspiracy obsessed young men kidnap the high-powered CEO of a major company, convinced that she is an alien intent on destroying planet Earth,\" according to the studio's plot synopsis. The movie is set to premiere at the Venice International Film Festival, where future Oscar contenders are often screened.\nEmma Stone opens up about being a mom: 'The greatest gift'\nElsewhere in her conversation with Vogue, Stone, who shares 4-year-old daughter Louise Jean with her husband Dave McCary, opened up about motherhood. \"There's nothing I feel luckier about,\" she told the outlet. \"She's the greatest gift of my life, for sure.\"\nStone continued that motherhood \"changes everything\" and \"simplifies everything\" by making her consider whether a job is worth spending time away from her child. \"I feel everything I could possibly feel, because everything has exploded,\" she shared.\nStone previously gave a sweet shoutout to her daughter in her acceptance speech after her Oscar win for \"Poor Things\" in 2024. \"Most importantly, my daughter, who's going to be 3 in three days and has turned our lives Technicolor,\" she said. \"I love you bigger than the whole sky, my girl.\""

      "text": "Taylor Swift announces new album: What to know about 'The Life of a Showgirl'\n- Taylor Swift teased a new project through various hints and appearances.\n- Swift will appear on the \"New Heights\" podcast with Travis Kelce, possibly revealing details about the project.\n- Rumors of a new Taylor Swift album have circulated among music industry insiders.\nAfter a drought of 555 days, a new dazzling Taylor Swift era has entered the chat. Introducing: \"The Life of a Showgirl.\"\nSwift confirmed the news on a \"New Heights\" podcast teaser released at 12:12 a.m. ET on Aug. 12. The singer pulled out a blurred out album cover for her new project.\n\"This is my brand-new album, 'The Life of a Showgirl,'\" Swift says.\nTravis adds, \"TS12,\" while Jason is heard screaming with excitement. The podcast will air Aug. 13 and likely provide details about her diamond dripping era.\nTucked on the shelf behind the couple is a jar of friendship bracelets and a new logo on an orange square with the yellow letters \"T.S.\"\nFans can preorder the album on taylorswift.com, but no release date has been shared yet.\nIn another promo video, Swift sits next to Travis and compliments his light blue sweater, \"Such a nice color on you.\"\n\"Yes, I know. It's the color of your eyes, sweetie,\" Travis replies. \"It's why we match so well.\"\n\"We're about to do a f***ing podcast,\" she says smiling.\nEarlier this morning, Taylor Nation, her in-house marketing team, posted like a canary in a coal mine, alerting the fandom to a 12th chapter. \"Thinking about when she said 'See you next era\u2026' \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udd25,\" the account posted with a carousel of 12 photos included fellow singer Sabrina Carpenter.\nThe \"New Heights\" podcast shared a photo of Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce next to a silhouette of Swift. The glittery background orange is the same background seen on a countdown clock on her website three hours before the announcement and also on her letter to fans announcing the ownership of her masters.\n'See you next era'\nKnown for planting Easter eggs in everything from lyrics to fashion to concert graphics, Swift started teasing the new project in April 2024 when she debuted \"The Tortured Poets Department\" at her Paris concert. Eagle-eyed Swifties noticed her countdown turned orange before the opening sequence and her \"Karma\" door at the close of the show was orange. She debuted a fiery bodysuit seen on the first page of her official Eras Tour book next to a letter that read: \"See you next era...\"\nHer team placed the book in a glass case at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum in Nashville. Each year, the display inside the Taylor Swift Education Center gets a refresh. In April, curators cracked the book open to its first page \u2014 a seemingly deliberate choice, as the exhibit\u2019s theme this year is \"Fearless.\" Many expected a page from that era, considering the display features her Roberto Cavalli \"silver noodle\" dress, Christian Louboutin boots and the Swarovski-crystal guitar her family bedazzled. In her letter, Swift writes: \"There\u2019s nothing I hate more than doing what I\u2019ve always done.\"\nFor the past four years, Swift has followed a steady formula: two rerecordings one year, one original album the next. Now, fans suspect the next chapter is about to break that cycle.\nTracing the evidence\nHits Daily Double, a music insider publication that reports on industry rumors, got the Swiftie fandom buzzing when they published an article about Justin Bieber's album \"Swag.\"\nThe original text said: \"Justin\u2019s new giant adds another rocket to the Lipmans' global arsenal, which already features monsters Drake, Morgan, Post and the left-field phenomenon KPop Demon Hunters at the top of the streaming charts. What's more, seismic rumblings of a new Taylor set keep the Republic team as aggressive as ever.\"\nThe article was quickly updated with the last line rephrased as: \"And there's always Taylor.\"\nFans, like Tiktok influencer Jake Deyton, took to social media to express their excitement. Deyton pointed out that Swift's usual cycle for an album announcement is a single in August or September, followed by an album release in October or November.\nA Swedish DJ may have sounded the alarm prematurely in April about an upcoming Swift project.\nThe Swedish branch of Swift's label Universal Music Group posted a quickly deleted clip of Jacob Criborn, part of the DJ team Nause, talking about the inspiration behind his \"Canelloni Macaroni\" remix. Criborn talked about working with Erik Arvinder, a Swedish composer and violinist.\n\"He did a string arrangement of 25. He got some brass guys playing trumpet, saxophone, trombone,\" he said in remarks translated from Swedish through Google Translate. \"And they were like, 'We're just going to finish Taylor Swift's record and then we'll jump on 'Canelloni.' No, but we really kind of pushed for this song because it deserves it.\"\nMore breadcrumbs to \"TS12\" include her Instagram tease in Miami for the Eras Tour, when she held her cat Meredith in Hard Rock Stadium's A12 section. In March, she praised Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco's new album, using 12 d's in a caption on her Instagram story: \"oh my godddddddddddd.\" In the letter announcing the ownership of her masters, she had 12 i's in \"thiiiiiiiiiiiis.\" The single numbers in the letter of 4, 6 and 2 add up to 12. The letterhead included a new \"TS\" diamond logo that would make Elizabeth Taylor proud.\nThe announcement also comes in perfect time for Kelce's 13th year playing football.\nDon't miss any Taylor Swift news; sign up for the free, weekly newsletter This Swift Beat.\nFollow Taylor Swift reporter Bryan West on Instagram, TikTok and X as @BryanWestTV."

      "text": "A meteorite crashes into a Georgia home. Turns out it's older than Earth.\nIs it a bird? Is it a plane? Nope! According to experts, it's a meteorite older than Earth.\nA meteorite \"crash landed\" in Georgia on June 26. Particles that tore through the roof of a home in Henry County, Georgia, 31 miles southeast of Atlanta, were donated to a planetary geologist at the University of Georgia (UGA) to figure out where it came from and its classification, according to an Aug. 8 press release published by the university.\n\u201cThis particular meteor that entered the atmosphere has a long history before it made it to the ground of McDonough, and in order to totally understand that, we actually have to examine what the rock is and determine what group of asteroids it belongs to,\u201d Scott Harris, a researcher in the UGA Franklin College of Arts and Sciences\u2019 department of geology, said in a statement.\nThe meteorite, the 27th one recovered from Georgia, was named the McDonough Meteorite after the area in which it landed, according to UGA. All meteorites get their names from the zip code they were found in.\nHow old is the meteorite?\nThe meteorite is believed to be 4.56 billion years old, UGA stated.\nBy comparison, the Earth is only 4.54 billion years old, according to the Planetary Society.\nWhat happened?\nIn June, people across Georgia watched as a fireball, a very bright meteor, broke apart in the sky.\nBut that's not where its journey ended, according to UGA.\nA piece of that fireball forced its way into a Georgia home. It fell fast enough to tear through the homeowner's roof, ductwork, and ceiling before it finally crash-landed, denting the floor of the house.\nFireball was seen beyond Georgia\nGeorgia was not the only state that saw the fireball on June 26. The American Meteor Society received 241 reports across several states, including Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. The rock was around three feet in diameter and weighed more than a ton.\nThe National Weather Service in Peachtree City, Georgia, also received reports of what felt like earthquakes, but was most likely sonic booms, a quick, thunder-like sound that is created when aircraft, like rockets and planes, go faster than the speed of sound.\nWhere is the meteorite now?\nUGA was given 23 of the 50 grams recovered from the home, according to the press release. Harris analyzed the fragments and believes that the meteor is a \"Low Metal (L) ordinary Chondrite,\" according to the press release.\n\u201cIt belongs to a group of asteroids in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter that we now think we can tie to a breakup of a much larger asteroid about 470 million years ago,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBut in that breakup, some pieces get into Earth-crossing orbits, and if given long enough, their orbit around the sun and Earth\u2019s orbit around the sun end up being at the same place, at the same moment in time.\u201d\nGiven the classification, Harris expects that the meteorite was formed in the presence of oxygen all those billions of years ago.\nThe meteorite will be stored at UGA so it can be studied further, but additional pieces that also fell in the area will be on display at the Tellus Science Museum in Cartersville, Georgia, around 43 miles northwest of Atlanta.\nContributing: Eric Lagatta, USA TODAY NETWORK; Joel Shannon, USA TODAY\nJulia is a trending reporter for USA TODAY.

They are also a sign that it\u2019s time to do some laundry!\nYour workout clothes are often a different kind of dirty than your regular ones, so you should take a slightly different approach to cleaning them. As tempting as it is to throw everything in at once, it's best to wash soiled workout clothes separately from the rest of your laundry.\nWatch this video to see how to properly clean your smelly gym clothes.\nHow to get stink out of workout clothes\nBefore balling up your sweaty clothes and tossing them in the laundry basket, let them air dry completely. Ideally, wash them as soon as possible to avoid them sitting and marinating in smells and bacteria for days\u2014or worse, weeks.\nTo really kick the stink to the curb, start by soaking your smelly clothes in cool water and distilled vinegar for 20 to 30 minutes. Then, wring them out, toss them in the wash and dump the water.\nWhether you pre-soak the clothes or not, wash everything inside out when it\u2019s time to throw it in the machine. For an extra boost, toss some baking soda directly into the washing machine to help fight odors.\nMake sure you\u2019re using the right amount of laundry detergent for the size of your load. Too much detergent can leave residue on clothes. Run your washing machine on a cold water cycle to prevent bacteria growth and let it do the rest.\nOnce the wash cycle is complete, drying your clothes in the sunshine is the best option. Sunlight and fresh air do wonders for removing bacteria and odors. If that\u2019s not possible, you can also use a dryer\u2014just check the care tags to make sure you're using the correct setting.\nShop top-rated related products:\n- Essential wool dryer balls: 6-Pack Handy Laundry Wool Dryer Balls\n- Pet-friendly product: FurZapper Pet Hair Remover for Laundry, 2-Pack\n- Skip the mess: 2-Pack Laundry Detergent Drip Cup Holder\n- For added freshness: Downy Unstopables In Wash Scent Booster Beads\n- On-the-go must-have: Tide Pen Stain Remover for Clothes\n- Laundry hack: Metal Magnetic Lint Bin for Laundry Room\n- For your intimates: 3-Piece Durable Honeycomb Mesh Laundry Bags for Delicates\n- Detergent for sensitive skin: Tide Free & Gentle Liquid Laundry Detergent\nLaundry codes symbols\nIt\u2019s always a good idea to check the washing instructions on your clothes.

Instead of scouring the web for an explanation, use your iPhone\u2019s camera. The Visual Look Up feature can translate those tiny icons into plain, understandable text with minimal effort.\nWatch this video to see how your phone can read symbols on your clothes and in your car.\nTo look up Laundry Symbols with your iPhone:\n- Take a picture of the tag with the laundry symbols.\n- Open the picture and tap the 'i' icon at the bottom.
