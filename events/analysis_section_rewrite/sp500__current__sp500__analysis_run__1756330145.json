      "feedback": "**Feedback & Edit Instructions (compact)**  \n1. **Add explicit citations**: Every claim (e.g., Nvidia’s 69 % YoY revenue growth to $44.1 bn, $4 trillion market cap, $8 bn revenue shortfall avoided, MIT report <10 % AI pilots generating revenue, Sam Altman’s “bubble” comment, Fed hint at Jackson Hole, Hang Seng + Nasdaq gains, Evergrande delisting) must reference the source ID (e.g., [MSPXAOHU8], [T7HLAX8QN]).  \n2. **Quantify reaction functions & thresholds**: State concrete price levels (e.g., Nvidia at $600; a 5 % revenue miss → 10–15 % drop; a 5 % beat → 5–8 % rally). Include S&P 500/ Nasdaq reaction ranges to Fed signals (e.g., +1.5 % after rate‑cut hint, −2–3 % if hike).  \n3. **Focus on horizon‑0–3 weeks**: Trim unrelated sections (Mac Studio comparison, HUTCHMED, PubMatic). Emphasize imminent catalysts: Nvidia Q2 earnings (Wednesday), Fed Jackson Hole policy statement (Friday), potential Chinese export‑control changes.  \n4. **Specify key levels/invalidations**: e.g., “If Nvidia’s EPS falls below $2.50 (guidance) the stock will likely break below $550.” “If Fed signals a rate hike, S&P 500 may retreat below 6,400.”  \n5. **Highlight what to monitor next**: 1) Nvidia earnings release; 2) Fed’s Jackson Hole remarks; 3) any new export‑control announcements; 4) further Chinese property delistings.  \n6. **Reconcile conflicts**: If the MIT report and Altman’s bubble claim are cited, note that they temper the rally but are not yet priced in; include a note that Nvidia’s 69 % revenue growth and $18.8 bn net income counterbalance the bubble risk.  \n7. **Improve clarity & coherence**: Re‑order paragraphs to start with macro drivers (Fed, S&P 500, Hang Seng), then Nvidia specifics, then risk factors, then next‑step monitoring. Use bullet points for catalysts and thresholds.  \n\nImplement these edits to elevate the analysis to a world‑class, data‑driven, horizon‑focused briefing.",
