  "content": "Explore AMMB Holdings Berhad's Fair Values from the Community and select yours\n\u2022 Institutions' substantial holdings in AMMB Holdings Berhad implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\n\u2022 A total of 10 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership\n\u2022 Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock We've found 21 US stocks that are forecast to pay a dividend yield of over 6% next year. See the full list for free. Every investor in AMMB Holdings Berhad (KLSE:AMBANK) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 49% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait. Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of AMMB Holdings Berhad, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for AMMB Holdings Berhad What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About AMMB Holdings Berhad? Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in AMMB Holdings Berhad. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of AMMB Holdings Berhad, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too. AMMB Holdings Berhad is not owned by hedge funds. Employees Provident Fund of Malaysia is currently the company's largest shareholder with 13% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 12% and 6.9%, of the shares outstanding, respectively. We also observed that the top 10 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO. Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group. Our information suggests that AMMB Holdings Berhad insiders own under 1% of the company. However, it's possible that insiders might have an indirect interest through a more complex structure. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own RM111m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 33% stake in AMMB Holdings Berhad. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run. Our data indicates that Private Companies hold 13%, of the company's shares. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company. I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For instance, we've identified 1 warning sign for AMMB Holdings Berhad that you should be aware of. But ultimately it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.
