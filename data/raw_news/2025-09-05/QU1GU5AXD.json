  "title": "Argan (AGX) Q2 2026 Earnings Call Transcript",
  "description": "David Watson: Thanks, Jennifer, and thank you, everyone, for joining today.  Then we'll open up the call for a brief Q&A. We achieved significantly strong results in 2026, reflecting excellent execution in the quarter, as we delivered solid revenue growth, enhanced gross margins, and record net income.  Joshua will go into the details of the quarter and first half in a moment, but highlights of our second quarter results included consolidated revenue of $238 million, reflecting growth of 5% compared to last year's second quarter and a sequential increase of 23% compared to 2026.",
  "content": "We have $572 million of cash and investments, net liquidity of $344 million, and no debt at 07/31/2025. Finally, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders and paid the quarterly dividend of 37.5\u00a2 in the quarter. Now on to the operational review. Slides four and five present our three reportable business segments. In our power industry services segment, we have the capability to build multiple types of power facilities, including efficient gas-fired power plants, solar energy fields, biomass facilities, and battery energy storage systems in the US, the UK, and in Ireland. Power industry services revenues increased 13% to $197 million in the second quarter as compared to $174 million for 2025.\n\nAs I've mentioned on previous calls, we have been seeing increasing demand for our capabilities as the power industry mobilizes to bring new facilities online as a large portion of natural gas-fired plants reach the end of operational life in the midst of unprecedented growth in power consumption. Electrification of everything, coupled with the anticipated expanded development of facilities to power AI data centers, is creating a strong market for our expertise and capabilities, and we're energized about the opportunities we're seeing not only in the near term but looking out for the next several years and beyond. Our balance sheet remains strong as we continue to generate significant cash flow.\n\nJoshua will go into the details of the quarter and first half in a moment, but highlights of our second quarter results included consolidated revenue of $238 million, reflecting growth of 5% compared to last year's second quarter and a sequential increase of 23% compared to 2026. Improved gross margins of 18.6% compared to 13.7% in 2025. Enhanced profitability with record net income of $35.3 million or $2.50 per diluted share. EBITDA of $36.3 million or an EBITDA margin of 15.2%. And record backlog of $2 billion, which includes the addition of the Platton Power Station, a 170-megawatt thermal facility in Ireland, as well as a significant new industrial services contract for a recycling water treatment plant in Alabama.\n\nDavid Watson: Thanks, Jennifer, and thank you, everyone, for joining today. I'll start by reviewing some of the highlights of our operations and activities, and Joshua Baugher, our CFO, will go over our financial results for the second quarter and six months ended 07/31/2025. Then we'll open up the call for a brief Q&A. We achieved significantly strong results in 2026, reflecting excellent execution in the quarter, as we delivered solid revenue growth, enhanced gross margins, and record net income.\n\nThe segment represented 83% of second-quarter revenues and reported pretax book income of approximately $35 million. As we expected, due to the timing of certain projects and contract awards, revenue decreased in our Industrial Construction Services segment to $36 million in the second quarter compared to $50 million in 2025. The segment achieved sequential revenue growth of $7 million or 23% compared to revenue of $29 million during 2020. Industrial Construction Services contributed 15% of consolidated revenue with pretax book income of approximately $3 million in 2026.\n\nThis segment primarily provides solutions for industrial construction projects with a concentration in agriculture, petrochemical, pulp and paper, water and power, and has seen solid demand for its capabilities, closing the quarter with record backlog of $189 million. New projects in this segment include several scopes of work for a recycling plant in Alabama, as well as increased orders for vessel fabrication for a number of data centers. We're excited about the record backlog, opportunities, and engagement we're seeing for the industrial segment and expect to see significantly increased revenues in the second half of this year. Finally, we have our telecommunications infrastructure services group, our smallest segment, which contributed 2% of second-quarter revenues.\n\nThe telecommunications segment provides outside construction services for the utility and telecommunications sectors as well as inside the premises wiring services, primarily for federal government locations and military installations requiring high-level security clearance. The business achieved record backlog in the quarter, and we expect to drive continued growth as we move through the balance of the year. The increase in energy demand driven by the widespread electrification of virtually every sector of the economy has been well documented. For the first time in decades, not only are we encountering rising power demand, but at the same time, a substantial portion of the nation's natural gas infrastructure is aging out.\n\nReliable, high-quality 24/7 energy is a nonnegotiable requirement in the support of AI data centers, complex manufacturing operations, and EV charging, and that energy is supplied by both the traditional gas-fired and renewable infrastructure that we, and a handful of others, are capable of building. With our energy-agnostic capabilities, longstanding customers and vendor relationships, and proven track record of success, we believe Argan, Inc. is very well positioned to benefit in the current demand environment for large and complex power facilities. Slide seven illustrates the strength and balance of our project backlog, which is comprised of approximately 61% natural gas projects and 29% renewable.\n\nThe energy industry is turning to a combination of natural gas and renewable energy resources to ensure grid reliability. Given the aging natural gas infrastructure, we expect to see heightened demand for gas-fired and other thermal power plants for several years to come as the industry seeks to increase the number of reliable and high-quality power sources. Our backlog of approximately $2 billion at July 31 includes several power plant projects, and we expect to add more through the balance of this year.\n\nDuring fiscal 2025, we proactively invested in our workforce and enhanced our teams to prepare for this increased project load and to position Argan, Inc. to continue to deliver excellent on-time execution for our customers as we support the electric economy. We're excited about the market interest we're receiving for our services, especially for our capabilities around the construction of complex combined cycle natural gas power plants. As I mentioned a moment ago, Argan, Inc. is one of only a few companies who have the capabilities to successfully execute those complex projects, and we have established a reputation for operational excellence and a proven track record of success.\n\nWe're energized by the opportunities in the pipeline and remain focused on our disciplined approach to pursuing and winning the right projects with the right partners in the right geographies. Turning to slide eight, our consolidated project backlog was approximately $2 billion at 07/31/2025, representing backlog growth of 5% from 04/30/2025, and as I mentioned, we expect to add a couple more projects before the end of the fiscal year. Our current backlog includes fully committed projects in both the Power and Industry Services and Industrial Construction Services segments as well as in our Telecom segment. In fact, each of our business segments has achieved record backlog as we generate significant organic growth across the entire Argan platform.\n\nOf note, we have a growing portion of traditional gas-fired plants in the current backlog, and we believe the representation of natural gas-fired facilities in our backlog will continue to increase in the near to mid-term. We will maintain our presence in the renewable business but anticipate that our natural gas projects will be our growth driver for the foreseeable future. Slide nine highlights selected major projects currently underway or expected to begin shortly. Our Trumbull project, a 950-megawatt natural gas-fired plant in Ohio, achieved first fire at one unit during the second quarter and achieved first fire at its second unit in August.\n\nWe're really pleased with that development as we move through the later stages of the Trumbull project. We've started construction on our 1.2-gigawatt ultra-efficient combined cycle natural gas-fired plant for SLEC in Texas, but we are in early days on that one. Our Tarbert next-generation power station, a 300-megawatt biofuel plant in Ireland, or SSE Thermal, is underway, and you'll also see highlighted here the previously mentioned recently awarded 170-megawatt thermal facility in Ireland that will provide power generation during periods of high demand and supply shortfall.\n\nDuring the second quarter, we continued to make progress on an approximately 700-megawatt combined cycle natural gas-fired power plant located in the US, as well as meaningfully advancing several renewable projects as we took advantage of cooperative summer weather to drive significant progress. Finally, you'll see two separate water treatment plant projects being performed by our industrial construction services segment, as well as a new recycling and water treatment plant that we are building in Alabama. So we are busy. There's a lot of attention given to the industry's demand for natural gas projects, but we believe our diverse backlog demonstrates our broad range of capabilities and the wide scope of our project mix.\n\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Joshua Baugher to take us through the second quarter financials. Go ahead, Josh.\n\nJoshua Baugher: Thanks, David, and good evening, everyone. On slide 10, we present our consolidated statements of earnings for the second quarter and six months ended 07/31/2025. Second quarter revenues increased 5% to $237.7 million, primarily reflecting strong revenue growth in our Power Industry Services segment as compared to 2025. For the quarter ended 07/31/2025, Argan, Inc. reported consolidated gross profit of approximately $44.3 million or a gross margin of 18.6%. Consolidated gross profit for the comparative quarter last fiscal year was $31.1 million, representing a gross margin of 13.7%. The increased gross profit and improved gross margin for the recently ended quarter is primarily due to the improved gross profit margins for the Power Industries Services segment.\n\nGross margins for our Power Industry Services segment, our Industrial Construction Services segment, and our Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segment were 19.6%, 12.5%, and 24.7% respectively, for 2026 as compared to 13.5%, 13%, and 31.4% respectively, in 2025. Selling, general, and administrative expenses of $14.2 million for 2026 increased as compared to SG&A of $12.4 million for the comparable prior year period. Other income net for the three months ended 07/31/2025 was $5.6 million, which primarily reflected investment income earned during the period. During the quarter ended 07/31/2025, the company recorded income tax expense of $400,000 on pretax book income of $35.6 million, which reflects a meaningful benefit from the favorable deductions resulting from stock option exercises during the period.\n\nFor the comparable period last year, Argan, Inc. recorded income tax expense of $6.1 million on pretax book income of $24.3 million. Net income for 2026 was $35.3 million or $2.50 per diluted share, which represents record quarterly EPS, compared to $18.2 million or $1.31 per diluted share for last year's comparable quarter. EBITDA earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the quarter ended 07/31/2025 increased to $36.2 million compared to $24.8 million for the same period of last year. EBITDA as a percent of revenue increased to 15.2% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 10.9% for the second quarter of last fiscal year.\n\nLooking at our year-to-date performance, revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2026 increased by 12.1% to $431.4 million as compared to revenues of $384.7 million for the prior year period. Our consolidated gross margin of 18.8% for the first six months of fiscal 2026 increased as compared to a gross margin of 12.8% for the first six months of fiscal 2025, primarily due to the same reasons described for the quarter. SG&A expense increased to $26.7 million for the first six months of fiscal 2026 as compared to $23.9 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025, but remained consistent as a percentage of revenues.\n\nNet income for the first six months of this fiscal year was $57.8 million or $4.90 per diluted share, compared to $26.1 million or $1.90 per diluted share for the first six months of last fiscal year. EBITDA was $66.5 million for the first half of fiscal 2026, compared with EBITDA of $36.7 million for 2025. With that, I'll turn the call back to David. Thanks, Josh.\n\nDavid Watson: With strong cash flow, we further strengthened our balance sheet during the second quarter. At 07/31/2025, we had approximately $572 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments generating meaningful investment yields. Our net liquidity was $344 million, and we had no debt. Stockholders' equity was $393 million at 07/31/2025. This liquidity bridge demonstrates that our business model ordinarily requires a low level of capital expenditures. Our net liquidity of $344 million at 07/31/2025 has increased $43 million compared with net liquidity at 01/31/2025. During the first six months of fiscal 2026, we returned $25 million of capital to our shareholders. We have a disciplined capital allocation strategy, which focuses on our core commitments.\n\nFirst, we invest in our people to ensure we are appropriately prepared to staff our projects. Second, the company pays a quarterly dividend, which we increased 25% to 37.5\u00a2 per common share in September 2024, creating an annual dividend run rate of $1.50 per share. Of note, that increase came just a year after we'd raised our dividend to 30\u00a2 per share in September 2023. Together, these two increases represent an aggregate 50% increase in our annual dividend run rate in less than two years, reflecting the strength of our business.\n\nThird, since November 2021, when we began our share buyback program, we have returned a total of approximately $109.6 million to shareholders. Additionally, in April, our board increased the authorization of the share repurchase program to $150 million. And finally, we will continue to evaluate and consider M&A opportunities that could be additive or complementary to our current capabilities or enhance our geographic footprint. Our company is dedicated to driving long-term value creation for shareholders. Our pipeline is stronger than it has ever been, and since 02/2008, we have increased our tangible book value and cumulative dividends per share to record levels.\n\nThere is no doubt that electrification of everything that is driving unprecedented power consumption is contributing to the heightened demand for Argan, Inc.'s diverse construction capabilities and expertise. As one of only a few companies who have a proven success rate building both complex combined cycle natural gas facilities as well as renewable energy resources, we are optimistic that our market position in an environment where the ongoing reliability of the power grid is dependent on the continued build-out of this infrastructure. We believe we are well positioned with the capabilities, financial flexibility, industry relationships, and longstanding customer base to strengthen our leadership role as a partner of choice for the build-out of energy infrastructure.\n\nTo close, we remain focused on our long-term growth strategy. Leverage our core competencies to capitalize on existing and emerging market opportunities, maintain disciplined risk management, with the goal of improving our project management effectiveness and minimizing costly project overruns. Strengthen our position as a partner of choice in the construction of power generation facilities, that power the electric economy and maintain grid reliability. And last but not least, drive organic growth while also being alert for acquisition opportunities that make sense for our business through thoughtful capital allocation. As we move beyond the midway point of fiscal 2026, we are excited about the new projects we have announced so far this year, and energized by the opportunities we are seeing to further increase our backlog. Our project pipeline is robust, and with the three to four-year duration of our combined cycle projects, our visibility today gives us confidence that our teams will be busy for several years to come.\n\nThat said, we have always taken a disciplined approach when pursuing any project, and that approach remains in place today. We are focused on winning the right projects with the right partners in the right geographies. The most important metric in our business is our ability to complete power facilities on time and on budget so that our partners can deliver power to the grid within the timeline they guaranteed. Our success in that capability is unmatched.\n\nThis is an exciting time for our company, and we are optimistic about our near and long-term growth opportunities as our project backlog continues to strengthen in response to the significant market demand for diverse energy infrastructure to provide the reliable, high-quality supply needed to meet the unprecedented and growing demand for energy. We couldn't do this without our employees, and I'd like to thank our entire team for their hard work and dedication to operational excellence. Likewise, I thank our shareholders for their continued support. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.\n\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press 1 on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. Participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment please while we poll for questions. Once again, please press 1 if you have a question or a comment. The first question comes from Chris Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed.\n\nChris Moore: Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on another nice quarter. Maybe we will just start with what is left there, and what's a reasonable timeline? Hey, Chris. Could you repeat that question again? Yeah. So just trying to understand. I noticed you had First Fire at Trumbull, Q2 and second in August. Just trying to understand what is left at Trumbull to complete and what's a reasonable timeline when you'll be totally finished.\n\nDavid Watson: Yeah. Absolutely. We were thrilled with achieving first fire at the end of the quarter and then on the second unit right afterwards. Which, as you know, is a meaningful accomplishment in the project life cycle of a gas-fired power plant. And also a moment when some of the risk starts to come off the table. We're still tracking towards completing that project on time and on budget for the customer, and that should happen in the first half of next year. Got it. Appreciate that. Gross margin was a strong 18.6%. I was trying to figure out if there are some meaningful one-time gains in there? I don't know. Would that be Trumbull or somebody else? I assume the 18.6% is not necessarily, even though it's a little below Q1, not necessarily sustainable. Just any thoughts on gross margin? Yes.\n\nIt's really hard to provide any kind of particular guidance on our gross margins. I mean, this quarter, there's clear and frankly, the last three quarters, there's just been significant execution excellence, especially in the power sector, right, between reaching first fire on the unit at Kilrood to finishing out that LNG job early this past quarter. You know, too favorable weather, allowing us to achieve a lot of progress on some more renewable projects. So, you know, as you know, on our last earnings call, I indicated that we expect to exceed last year's fiscal year's gross profit margin as a percent of revenues. And with continued strong execution across businesses, that continues to be our expectation. Know?\n\nAs you know, we are unapologetically conservative in all things that we do here. Given the lumpy nature of this business, especially this construction business, which is one of the reasons why we don't provide revenue and EPS guidance. So we're pleased with the margins to halfway point this year and expect to continue to achieve our main goal, which is to bring each of our customers another successful project. Terrific. Maybe just the last one for me is it sounds like there are a bunch of potential projects out there that and some you could add in fiscal 2026.\n\nThe range of the scale could be anywhere from, you know, $100 million to a big traditional gas plant in the $600 million range? Just any thoughts in terms of the type of things you're looking at? Yes. No. We're obviously really pleased to have record backlog, frankly, at all of our business segments as of 07/31. And we remain very bullish on being able to continue to add to the backlog. It relates to the power segment, as you know, Chris, right, it takes several years for developers to get to the point where they're ready to sign an EPC contract. So while our visibility for opportunities is good, the specific time in the contract is difficult to pinpoint.\n\nI mean, though, over the last three quarters, we've had a 1.2-gigawatt power plant, a 700-megawatt job in the US, and a 300-megawatt, a 170-megawatt job in Ireland. So that's a huge testament to the hard work of the power teams that they're putting in to get the right contracts.\n\nTo your point, you know, they're not finished. You know, we expect over the rest of the current fiscal year to add a few more power jobs. Should put us significantly over $2 billion in backlog. The size of those, you know, I just mentioned. Right? We've done jobs from 170 earlier this year to 1.2 gigawatts. So it's not unfair to assume that we'll have a variety of sizes. And because there really is no upward bound for us given, as you know, the Guernsey job was the largest single-phase power plant built in the United States, and that's what we did. So don't know if that answers your question, but we have the range to do it all.\n\nChris Moore: Alright. I will leave it there. Thanks, guys.\n\nOperator: The next question comes from Rob Brown with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please proceed. Hi, David.\n\nRob Brown: Just following up on kind of the pipeline discussion. Have you noticed sort of any so what changes in the pipeline have you sort of noticed? Is it accelerating now that the demand environment is good? And are you starting to see acceleration there, or what's sort of the dynamic on the pipeline in the last few months?\n\nDavid Watson: I think a lot of the Rob, a lot of the factors that had been in play for the last six months remain. I don't know if I would call it an acceleration. It was already a meaningful acceleration to that point. And obviously, the huge data points there are the OEMs who build the gas turbines have been sold out for many years, which clearly confirms that there's an abundance of opportunities. Yeah. And, you know, the fundamentals, electricity consumption is expected to increase 4% annually through 2027 per the IEA.\n\nAnd then the recent capacity auction results in the PJM, which is the largest grid operator in the US, hit record levels of $329 per megawatt per day for the 2627 delivery year. So, again, that's confirming that there's the need for new power and that there's the willingness to pay for it. So all of these data points and what we're seeing as we evaluate opportunities suggest an elevated level of opportunities.\n\nRob Brown: Okay. Thank you.\n\nDavid Watson: On the industrial business side, I think you talked about a couple of big project wins there. How's the pipeline there? And I think that business is off recovering off a bottom, but what's the opportunity that segment can get to? And what's the trend line there in terms of backlog growth we should expect?\n\nDavid Watson: Yeah. It was just a couple calls ago where, you know, the backlog was meaningfully down, and I was indicating to the market that they we were gonna be in for a couple lower revenue quarters, and that's exactly what happened. Though, we're super pleased that we've climbed to record backlog of $189 million at the end of the quarter, and we expect to see improved performance in the second half of the year as we convert that backlog to revenues. So it's the TRC's markets continue to expand, including a fair amount of work in the water treatment space and the data center spaces.\n\nSo it's a lot of positive momentum there. And again, as is our focus here at Argan, it comes down to execution.\n\nRob Brown: Alright. Thank you. Turn it over. Congrats on the strong results.\n\nOperator: Next question comes from Drew Chamberlain with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\n\nDrew Chamberlain: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, team. Thanks for taking the questions. First one, I just want to follow-up on the backlog discussion. I think I heard you say, David, that the backlog you expect to be significantly over $2 billion at the end of the year, which is, I guess, the same as we said last quarter. That's the formal guidance. But can you talk a little bit about maybe what's changed in the last three months since the last call? I mean, are you think the products are coming in faster than expected, slower than expected? I mean, just really any difference.\n\nDavid Watson: Drew, great question. And at the end of the day, they continue to progress. And after another three months, we see, continue to see, milestones getting achieved. And gives us greater clarity and certainty that we expect those jobs to off later this year. So we haven't seen any pullback or any hesitation from the partners and potential customers that we're speaking to or working with. And given us a lot of confidence that we're gonna get there.\n\nDrew Chamberlain: Okay. Thanks. And then and then moving to the margin discussion. I mean, obviously, appreciate the difficulties of guiding to gross margin here and, obviously, why you know, really choose to shy away from it. But can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from a pricing dynamic in the market, and especially on the incremental contracts? Like where do you think those are shaking out versus historic levels?\n\nDavid Watson: Drew, another great question. I mean, we've been disciplined in our approach to every project. With our focus being successful completion of the project, ensuring the facility comes online, on time and on budget. Our approach to winning and dynamically pricing projects has been consistent for the past twenty years. And we really don't pay attention to what others may be doing. We also really are focused on longstanding customer relationships that we value greatly, and we want those relationships to continue through this busy time and beyond. So, clearly, there is a meaningful demand in the market for EPCs that can build these power plants in the supply of us.\n\nIs probably, you know, less than the demand, and so that does create some opportunities.\n\nDrew Chamberlain: Okay. Makes sense. And then just last one real quick for me. Thoughts on capacity. I mean, I think you've been pretty clear that you have double-digit capacity today. That's gonna be a mix of project types. But you're also talking about visit obviously, great longer-term demand here, fundamentals are there. And really improving visibility with that. I mean, can you talk about how you think about your need to add capacity over, you know, this cycle and maybe, you know, was it more appealing to do it organically or through M&A? Thank you.\n\nDavid Watson: Excellent. Thank you. The you know, we've intentionally added headcount over the last eighteen months to position ourselves for this currently very strong demand environment. In the past, I've said 10 plus jobs, a mix of renewables and gas, and again, that all depends on size and cadence of our projects. And I would say we believe we have the capacity to handle 10 to 12 jobs in our power business. So we continue to nurture and grow our teams. Obviously, Argan, Inc. historically focused on organic growth, and that continues today.\n\nRob Brown: Perfect. Thank you very much, guys.\n\nOperator: We have no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the floor back to David Watson for closing remarks.\n\nDavid Watson: Great. Thanks, John. Thank you all for participating in today's call. And I look forward to speaking with you again when we report our third quarter fiscal 2026 results later this year. Have a great evening.\n\nOperator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time.

I'll start by reviewing some of the highlights of our operations and activities, and Joshua Baugher, our CFO, will go over our financial results for the second quarter and six months ended 07/31/2025. Then we'll open up the call for a brief Q&A. We achieved significantly strong results in 2026, reflecting excellent execution in the quarter, as we delivered solid revenue growth, enhanced gross margins, and record net income.\nJoshua will go into the details of the quarter and first half in a moment, but highlights of our second quarter results included consolidated revenue of $238 million, reflecting growth of 5% compared to last year's second quarter and a sequential increase of 23% compared to 2026. Improved gross margins of 18.6% compared to 13.7% in 2025. Enhanced profitability with record net income of $35.3 million or $2.50 per diluted share. EBITDA of $36.3 million or an EBITDA margin of 15.2%. And record backlog of $2 billion, which includes the addition of the Platton Power Station, a 170-megawatt thermal facility in Ireland, as well as a significant new industrial services contract for a recycling water treatment plant in Alabama.\nAs I've mentioned on previous calls, we have been seeing increasing demand for our capabilities as the power industry mobilizes to bring new facilities online as a large portion of natural gas-fired plants reach the end of operational life in the midst of unprecedented growth in power consumption. Electrification of everything, coupled with the anticipated expanded development of facilities to power AI data centers, is creating a strong market for our expertise and capabilities, and we're energized about the opportunities we're seeing not only in the near term but looking out for the next several years and beyond. Our balance sheet remains strong as we continue to generate significant cash flow.\nWe have $572 million of cash and investments, net liquidity of $344 million, and no debt at 07/31/2025. Finally, we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders and paid the quarterly dividend of 37.5\u00a2 in the quarter. Now on to the operational review. Slides four and five present our three reportable business segments. In our power industry services segment, we have the capability to build multiple types of power facilities, including efficient gas-fired power plants, solar energy fields, biomass facilities, and battery energy storage systems in the US, the UK, and in Ireland. Power industry services revenues increased 13% to $197 million in the second quarter as compared to $174 million for 2025.\nThe segment represented 83% of second-quarter revenues and reported pretax book income of approximately $35 million. As we expected, due to the timing of certain projects and contract awards, revenue decreased in our Industrial Construction Services segment to $36 million in the second quarter compared to $50 million in 2025. The segment achieved sequential revenue growth of $7 million or 23% compared to revenue of $29 million during 2020. Industrial Construction Services contributed 15% of consolidated revenue with pretax book income of approximately $3 million in 2026.\nThis segment primarily provides solutions for industrial construction projects with a concentration in agriculture, petrochemical, pulp and paper, water and power, and has seen solid demand for its capabilities, closing the quarter with record backlog of $189 million. New projects in this segment include several scopes of work for a recycling plant in Alabama, as well as increased orders for vessel fabrication for a number of data centers. We're excited about the record backlog, opportunities, and engagement we're seeing for the industrial segment and expect to see significantly increased revenues in the second half of this year. Finally, we have our telecommunications infrastructure services group, our smallest segment, which contributed 2% of second-quarter revenues.\nThe telecommunications segment provides outside construction services for the utility and telecommunications sectors as well as inside the premises wiring services, primarily for federal government locations and military installations requiring high-level security clearance. The business achieved record backlog in the quarter, and we expect to drive continued growth as we move through the balance of the year. The increase in energy demand driven by the widespread electrification of virtually every sector of the economy has been well documented. For the first time in decades, not only are we encountering rising power demand, but at the same time, a substantial portion of the nation's natural gas infrastructure is aging out.\nReliable, high-quality 24/7 energy is a nonnegotiable requirement in the support of AI data centers, complex manufacturing operations, and EV charging, and that energy is supplied by both the traditional gas-fired and renewable infrastructure that we, and a handful of others, are capable of building. With our energy-agnostic capabilities, longstanding customers and vendor relationships, and proven track record of success, we believe Argan, Inc. is very well positioned to benefit in the current demand environment for large and complex power facilities. Slide seven illustrates the strength and balance of our project backlog, which is comprised of approximately 61% natural gas projects and 29% renewable.\nThe energy industry is turning to a combination of natural gas and renewable energy resources to ensure grid reliability. Given the aging natural gas infrastructure, we expect to see heightened demand for gas-fired and other thermal power plants for several years to come as the industry seeks to increase the number of reliable and high-quality power sources. Our backlog of approximately $2 billion at July 31 includes several power plant projects, and we expect to add more through the balance of this year.\nDuring fiscal 2025, we proactively invested in our workforce and enhanced our teams to prepare for this increased project load and to position Argan, Inc. to continue to deliver excellent on-time execution for our customers as we support the electric economy. We're excited about the market interest we're receiving for our services, especially for our capabilities around the construction of complex combined cycle natural gas power plants. As I mentioned a moment ago, Argan, Inc. is one of only a few companies who have the capabilities to successfully execute those complex projects, and we have established a reputation for operational excellence and a proven track record of success.\nWe're energized by the opportunities in the pipeline and remain focused on our disciplined approach to pursuing and winning the right projects with the right partners in the right geographies. Turning to slide eight, our consolidated project backlog was approximately $2 billion at 07/31/2025, representing backlog growth of 5% from 04/30/2025, and as I mentioned, we expect to add a couple more projects before the end of the fiscal year. Our current backlog includes fully committed projects in both the Power and Industry Services and Industrial Construction Services segments as well as in our Telecom segment. In fact, each of our business segments has achieved record backlog as we generate significant organic growth across the entire Argan platform.\nOf note, we have a growing portion of traditional gas-fired plants in the current backlog, and we believe the representation of natural gas-fired facilities in our backlog will continue to increase in the near to mid-term. We will maintain our presence in the renewable business but anticipate that our natural gas projects will be our growth driver for the foreseeable future. Slide nine highlights selected major projects currently underway or expected to begin shortly. Our Trumbull project, a 950-megawatt natural gas-fired plant in Ohio, achieved first fire at one unit during the second quarter and achieved first fire at its second unit in August.\nWe're really pleased with that development as we move through the later stages of the Trumbull project. We've started construction on our 1.2-gigawatt ultra-efficient combined cycle natural gas-fired plant for SLEC in Texas, but we are in early days on that one. Our Tarbert next-generation power station, a 300-megawatt biofuel plant in Ireland, or SSE Thermal, is underway, and you'll also see highlighted here the previously mentioned recently awarded 170-megawatt thermal facility in Ireland that will provide power generation during periods of high demand and supply shortfall.\nDuring the second quarter, we continued to make progress on an approximately 700-megawatt combined cycle natural gas-fired power plant located in the US, as well as meaningfully advancing several renewable projects as we took advantage of cooperative summer weather to drive significant progress. Finally, you'll see two separate water treatment plant projects being performed by our industrial construction services segment, as well as a new recycling and water treatment plant that we are building in Alabama. So we are busy. There's a lot of attention given to the industry's demand for natural gas projects, but we believe our diverse backlog demonstrates our broad range of capabilities and the wide scope of our project mix.\nWith that, I'll turn the call over to Joshua Baugher to take us through the second quarter financials. Go ahead, Josh.\nJoshua Baugher: Thanks, David, and good evening, everyone. On slide 10, we present our consolidated statements of earnings for the second quarter and six months ended 07/31/2025. Second quarter revenues increased 5% to $237.7 million, primarily reflecting strong revenue growth in our Power Industry Services segment as compared to 2025. For the quarter ended 07/31/2025, Argan, Inc. reported consolidated gross profit of approximately $44.3 million or a gross margin of 18.6%. Consolidated gross profit for the comparative quarter last fiscal year was $31.1 million, representing a gross margin of 13.7%. The increased gross profit and improved gross margin for the recently ended quarter is primarily due to the improved gross profit margins for the Power Industries Services segment.\nGross margins for our Power Industry Services segment, our Industrial Construction Services segment, and our Telecommunications Infrastructure Services segment were 19.6%, 12.5%, and 24.7% respectively, for 2026 as compared to 13.5%, 13%, and 31.4% respectively, in 2025. Selling, general, and administrative expenses of $14.2 million for 2026 increased as compared to SG&A of $12.4 million for the comparable prior year period. Other income net for the three months ended 07/31/2025 was $5.6 million, which primarily reflected investment income earned during the period. During the quarter ended 07/31/2025, the company recorded income tax expense of $400,000 on pretax book income of $35.6 million, which reflects a meaningful benefit from the favorable deductions resulting from stock option exercises during the period.\nFor the comparable period last year, Argan, Inc. recorded income tax expense of $6.1 million on pretax book income of $24.3 million. Net income for 2026 was $35.3 million or $2.50 per diluted share, which represents record quarterly EPS, compared to $18.2 million or $1.31 per diluted share for last year's comparable quarter. EBITDA earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for the quarter ended 07/31/2025 increased to $36.2 million compared to $24.8 million for the same period of last year. EBITDA as a percent of revenue increased to 15.2% for the second quarter of this fiscal year compared to 10.9% for the second quarter of last fiscal year.\nLooking at our year-to-date performance, revenues for the first six months of fiscal 2026 increased by 12.1% to $431.4 million as compared to revenues of $384.7 million for the prior year period. Our consolidated gross margin of 18.8% for the first six months of fiscal 2026 increased as compared to a gross margin of 12.8% for the first six months of fiscal 2025, primarily due to the same reasons described for the quarter. SG&A expense increased to $26.7 million for the first six months of fiscal 2026 as compared to $23.9 million for the first six months of fiscal 2025, but remained consistent as a percentage of revenues.\nNet income for the first six months of this fiscal year was $57.8 million or $4.90 per diluted share, compared to $26.1 million or $1.90 per diluted share for the first six months of last fiscal year. EBITDA was $66.5 million for the first half of fiscal 2026, compared with EBITDA of $36.7 million for 2025. With that, I'll turn the call back to David. Thanks, Josh.\nDavid Watson: With strong cash flow, we further strengthened our balance sheet during the second quarter. At 07/31/2025, we had approximately $572 million in cash, cash equivalents, and investments generating meaningful investment yields. Our net liquidity was $344 million, and we had no debt. Stockholders' equity was $393 million at 07/31/2025. This liquidity bridge demonstrates that our business model ordinarily requires a low level of capital expenditures. Our net liquidity of $344 million at 07/31/2025 has increased $43 million compared with net liquidity at 01/31/2025. During the first six months of fiscal 2026, we returned $25 million of capital to our shareholders. We have a disciplined capital allocation strategy, which focuses on our core commitments.\nFirst, we invest in our people to ensure we are appropriately prepared to staff our projects. Second, the company pays a quarterly dividend, which we increased 25% to 37.5\u00a2 per common share in September 2024, creating an annual dividend run rate of $1.50 per share. Of note, that increase came just a year after we'd raised our dividend to 30\u00a2 per share in September 2023. Together, these two increases represent an aggregate 50% increase in our annual dividend run rate in less than two years, reflecting the strength of our business.\nThird, since November 2021, when we began our share buyback program, we have returned a total of approximately $109.6 million to shareholders. Additionally, in April, our board increased the authorization of the share repurchase program to $150 million. And finally, we will continue to evaluate and consider M&A opportunities that could be additive or complementary to our current capabilities or enhance our geographic footprint. Our company is dedicated to driving long-term value creation for shareholders. Our pipeline is stronger than it has ever been, and since 02/2008, we have increased our tangible book value and cumulative dividends per share to record levels.\nThere is no doubt that electrification of everything that is driving unprecedented power consumption is contributing to the heightened demand for Argan, Inc.'s diverse construction capabilities and expertise. As one of only a few companies who have a proven success rate building both complex combined cycle natural gas facilities as well as renewable energy resources, we are optimistic that our market position in an environment where the ongoing reliability of the power grid is dependent on the continued build-out of this infrastructure. We believe we are well positioned with the capabilities, financial flexibility, industry relationships, and longstanding customer base to strengthen our leadership role as a partner of choice for the build-out of energy infrastructure.\nTo close, we remain focused on our long-term growth strategy. Leverage our core competencies to capitalize on existing and emerging market opportunities, maintain disciplined risk management, with the goal of improving our project management effectiveness and minimizing costly project overruns. Strengthen our position as a partner of choice in the construction of power generation facilities, that power the electric economy and maintain grid reliability. And last but not least, drive organic growth while also being alert for acquisition opportunities that make sense for our business through thoughtful capital allocation. As we move beyond the midway point of fiscal 2026, we are excited about the new projects we have announced so far this year, and energized by the opportunities we are seeing to further increase our backlog. Our project pipeline is robust, and with the three to four-year duration of our combined cycle projects, our visibility today gives us confidence that our teams will be busy for several years to come.\nThat said, we have always taken a disciplined approach when pursuing any project, and that approach remains in place today. We are focused on winning the right projects with the right partners in the right geographies. The most important metric in our business is our ability to complete power facilities on time and on budget so that our partners can deliver power to the grid within the timeline they guaranteed. Our success in that capability is unmatched.\nThis is an exciting time for our company, and we are optimistic about our near and long-term growth opportunities as our project backlog continues to strengthen in response to the significant market demand for diverse energy infrastructure to provide the reliable, high-quality supply needed to meet the unprecedented and growing demand for energy. We couldn't do this without our employees, and I'd like to thank our entire team for their hard work and dedication to operational excellence. Likewise, I thank our shareholders for their continued support. With that, operator, let's open it up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press 1 on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press 2 if you would like to remove your question from the queue. Participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment please while we poll for questions. Once again, please press 1 if you have a question or a comment. The first question comes from Chris Moore with CJS Securities. Please proceed.\nChris Moore: Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on another nice quarter. Maybe we will just start with what is left there, and what's a reasonable timeline? Hey, Chris. Could you repeat that question again? Yeah. So just trying to understand. I noticed you had First Fire at Trumbull, Q2 and second in August. Just trying to understand what is left at Trumbull to complete and what's a reasonable timeline when you'll be totally finished.\nDavid Watson: Yeah. Absolutely. We were thrilled with achieving first fire at the end of the quarter and then on the second unit right afterwards. Which, as you know, is a meaningful accomplishment in the project life cycle of a gas-fired power plant. And also a moment when some of the risk starts to come off the table. We're still tracking towards completing that project on time and on budget for the customer, and that should happen in the first half of next year. Got it. Appreciate that. Gross margin was a strong 18.6%. I was trying to figure out if there are some meaningful one-time gains in there? I don't know. Would that be Trumbull or somebody else? I assume the 18.6% is not necessarily, even though it's a little below Q1, not necessarily sustainable. Just any thoughts on gross margin? Yes.\nIt's really hard to provide any kind of particular guidance on our gross margins. I mean, this quarter, there's clear and frankly, the last three quarters, there's just been significant execution excellence, especially in the power sector, right, between reaching first fire on the unit at Kilrood to finishing out that LNG job early this past quarter. You know, too favorable weather, allowing us to achieve a lot of progress on some more renewable projects. So, you know, as you know, on our last earnings call, I indicated that we expect to exceed last year's fiscal year's gross profit margin as a percent of revenues. And with continued strong execution across businesses, that continues to be our expectation. Know?\nAs you know, we are unapologetically conservative in all things that we do here. Given the lumpy nature of this business, especially this construction business, which is one of the reasons why we don't provide revenue and EPS guidance. So we're pleased with the margins to halfway point this year and expect to continue to achieve our main goal, which is to bring each of our customers another successful project. Terrific. Maybe just the last one for me is it sounds like there are a bunch of potential projects out there that and some you could add in fiscal 2026.\nThe range of the scale could be anywhere from, you know, $100 million to a big traditional gas plant in the $600 million range? Just any thoughts in terms of the type of things you're looking at? Yes. No. We're obviously really pleased to have record backlog, frankly, at all of our business segments as of 07/31. And we remain very bullish on being able to continue to add to the backlog. It relates to the power segment, as you know, Chris, right, it takes several years for developers to get to the point where they're ready to sign an EPC contract. So while our visibility for opportunities is good, the specific time in the contract is difficult to pinpoint.\nI mean, though, over the last three quarters, we've had a 1.2-gigawatt power plant, a 700-megawatt job in the US, and a 300-megawatt, a 170-megawatt job in Ireland. So that's a huge testament to the hard work of the power teams that they're putting in to get the right contracts.\nTo your point, you know, they're not finished. You know, we expect over the rest of the current fiscal year to add a few more power jobs. Should put us significantly over $2 billion in backlog. The size of those, you know, I just mentioned. Right? We've done jobs from 170 earlier this year to 1.2 gigawatts. So it's not unfair to assume that we'll have a variety of sizes. And because there really is no upward bound for us given, as you know, the Guernsey job was the largest single-phase power plant built in the United States, and that's what we did. So don't know if that answers your question, but we have the range to do it all.\nChris Moore: Alright. I will leave it there. Thanks, guys.\nDavid Watson: Absolutely.\nOperator: The next question comes from Rob Brown with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please proceed. Hi, David.\nRob Brown: Just following up on kind of the pipeline discussion. Have you noticed sort of any so what changes in the pipeline have you sort of noticed? Is it accelerating now that the demand environment is good? And are you starting to see acceleration there, or what's sort of the dynamic on the pipeline in the last few months?\nDavid Watson: I think a lot of the Rob, a lot of the factors that had been in play for the last six months remain. I don't know if I would call it an acceleration. It was already a meaningful acceleration to that point. And obviously, the huge data points there are the OEMs who build the gas turbines have been sold out for many years, which clearly confirms that there's an abundance of opportunities. Yeah. And, you know, the fundamentals, electricity consumption is expected to increase 4% annually through 2027 per the IEA.\nAnd then the recent capacity auction results in the PJM, which is the largest grid operator in the US, hit record levels of $329 per megawatt per day for the 2627 delivery year. So, again, that's confirming that there's the need for new power and that there's the willingness to pay for it. So all of these data points and what we're seeing as we evaluate opportunities suggest an elevated level of opportunities.\nRob Brown: Okay. Thank you.\nDavid Watson: On the industrial business side, I think you talked about a couple of big project wins there. How's the pipeline there? And I think that business is off recovering off a bottom, but what's the opportunity that segment can get to? And what's the trend line there in terms of backlog growth we should expect?\nDavid Watson: Yeah. It was just a couple calls ago where, you know, the backlog was meaningfully down, and I was indicating to the market that they we were gonna be in for a couple lower revenue quarters, and that's exactly what happened. Though, we're super pleased that we've climbed to record backlog of $189 million at the end of the quarter, and we expect to see improved performance in the second half of the year as we convert that backlog to revenues. So it's the TRC's markets continue to expand, including a fair amount of work in the water treatment space and the data center spaces.\nSo it's a lot of positive momentum there. And again, as is our focus here at Argan, it comes down to execution.\nRob Brown: Alright. Thank you. Turn it over. Congrats on the strong results.\nDavid Watson: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Next question comes from Drew Chamberlain with JPMorgan. Please proceed.\nDrew Chamberlain: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon, team. Thanks for taking the questions. First one, I just want to follow-up on the backlog discussion. I think I heard you say, David, that the backlog you expect to be significantly over $2 billion at the end of the year, which is, I guess, the same as we said last quarter. That's the formal guidance. But can you talk a little bit about maybe what's changed in the last three months since the last call? I mean, are you think the products are coming in faster than expected, slower than expected? I mean, just really any difference.\nDavid Watson: Drew, great question. And at the end of the day, they continue to progress. And after another three months, we see, continue to see, milestones getting achieved. And gives us greater clarity and certainty that we expect those jobs to off later this year. So we haven't seen any pullback or any hesitation from the partners and potential customers that we're speaking to or working with. And given us a lot of confidence that we're gonna get there.\nDrew Chamberlain: Okay. Thanks. And then and then moving to the margin discussion. I mean, obviously, appreciate the difficulties of guiding to gross margin here and, obviously, why you know, really choose to shy away from it. But can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from a pricing dynamic in the market, and especially on the incremental contracts? Like where do you think those are shaking out versus historic levels?\nDavid Watson: Drew, another great question. I mean, we've been disciplined in our approach to every project. With our focus being successful completion of the project, ensuring the facility comes online, on time and on budget. Our approach to winning and dynamically pricing projects has been consistent for the past twenty years. And we really don't pay attention to what others may be doing. We also really are focused on longstanding customer relationships that we value greatly, and we want those relationships to continue through this busy time and beyond. So, clearly, there is a meaningful demand in the market for EPCs that can build these power plants in the supply of us.\nIs probably, you know, less than the demand, and so that does create some opportunities.\nDrew Chamberlain: Okay. Makes sense. And then just last one real quick for me. Thoughts on capacity. I mean, I think you've been pretty clear that you have double-digit capacity today. That's gonna be a mix of project types. But you're also talking about visit obviously, great longer-term demand here, fundamentals are there. And really improving visibility with that. I mean, can you talk about how you think about your need to add capacity over, you know, this cycle and maybe, you know, was it more appealing to do it organically or through M&A? Thank you.\nDavid Watson: Excellent. Thank you. The you know, we've intentionally added headcount over the last eighteen months to position ourselves for this currently very strong demand environment. In the past, I've said 10 plus jobs, a mix of renewables and gas, and again, that all depends on size and cadence of our projects. And I would say we believe we have the capacity to handle 10 to 12 jobs in our power business. So we continue to nurture and grow our teams. Obviously, Argan, Inc. historically focused on organic growth, and that continues today.\nRob Brown: Perfect. Thank you very much, guys.\nDavid Watson: Absolutely.\nOperator: We have no further questions in queue. I'd like to turn the floor back to David Watson for closing remarks.\nDavid Watson: Great. Thanks, John. Thank you all for participating in today's call. And I look forward to speaking with you again when we report our third quarter fiscal 2026 results later this year. Have a great evening.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation."

      "text": "Here at The Motley Fool, when it comes to matters of money, we believe in transparency and accountability. Day in and day out, we dedicate ourselves to delivering responsible investing ideas and sound financial education. That's why, when it comes to talking about stocks, we think it's important that you know exactly where we're coming from. With this in mind, we have developed a company-wide disclosure policy to guide our business and communications. We call it Fool Disclosure. We invite you to take some time to read through it, and hope it helps inform your experience here in Fooldom.\nInvestors Communicating With Investors\nThe Motley Fool is a company that represents investors teaching and learning from other investors. Many financial publications do not permit their writers and editors to own stocks. The Motley Fool not only permits, but also encourages its staff to invest in common stock. Why? Two reasons.\nFirst, we strongly believe the most effective way to create wealth is through the long-term ownership of stocks. The stock market has compounded 10% average annual returns over the last century. We believe in using the stock market as a savings bank, and we strongly encourage treating money management as a lifelong endeavor. Therefore, we think it'd be downright mean of us to close that avenue of investment to our employees.\nSecond, and more important, we don't consider our employees to be journalists, but rather communicators and teachers of financial matters. It's a subtle but critical difference that affects our entire service -- from our online site at Fool.com, to our investment books, to our nationally syndicated newspaper column, to our newsletters and portfolio services. As a company, we utilize every available medium to teach people of all ages, all income levels, all backgrounds, and all genetic codes about money and its applications in modern life. Therefore, we believe our staff's involvement in managing their own money is critical to their learning more about the subject and their succeeding in their own lives. And who better to write about investing than those who do it themselves?\nThe Motley Fool writes about stocks in both free and paid content. We make stock recommendations in our various premium newsletter services and actually hold some of these shares in our portfolio services. We will disclose our recommendation or ownership until we cease to recommend the stock, or we sell our entire position. Of course, in both free and paid content we will continue to disclose whether the author has an interest in the stocks mentioned.\nInternally, the Fool has always strived to operate with the highest levels of integrity and transparency. As such, here are the key components of The Motley Fool's disclosure policy:\nDisclosure\n- When a writer writes about a stock that he or she has a position or beneficial interest in, that fact is disclosed at the end of the article.\n- If The Motley Fool recommends or holds a position in a stock, that fact is also disclosed at the end of the article.\n- All Fool employees and contractors -- that's anyone with a TMF prefix on their screen names -- are required to disclose their current positions, including stocks, mutual funds, and cryptocurrencies. We aggregate and display these positions for the entire company here. (We do not disclose the individual stocks that might be in a Fool's mutual funds.)\n- Affiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no knowledge of any affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates' personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published. Our affiliate companies may also have their own disclosure policies, which they may make available on their respective sites.\nTrading Restrictions\nIn addition to the above disclosure requirements, Fool employees work under additional trading restrictions and guidelines. These restrictions require that they:\n- Must hold any stock they own for at least 10 days. (No day trading allowed -- as if we'd want to!)\n- Cannot write about a stock in the period of 2 market days before to 2 market days after purchasing or selling the stock.\n- Must clear trades with our compliance department prior to any transaction.\n- Must notify our compliance department every time they buy or sell a stock, regardless of whether they have written about it.\nInvestors in The Motley Fool\nThe Motley Fool is grateful to the people that have invested in us. The Fool's founders and some family members have invested in the company, and full-time employees receive stock options and/or stock in the company.\nBusiness and Technology Partners\nWe have business relationships with an ever-changing assortment of companies, including technology vendors, leasing companies, data providers, banks, distribution channels, advertisers, landlords, accountants, and the restaurants up the street from Fool HQ. Many of these companies are public companies operating in industries that we follow. There may be instances in which one of our newsletters recommends a company with whom we have a business relationship, or we may write an article about such a company on Fool.com. These occurrences are unintentional and coincidental, as the business end of The Motley Fool has no input or influence on the editorial side of things.\nIt would take too much space to list all the companies that we do business with, and we'd probably forget some anyway, but below are some of our major partners. (This list is most subject to change. We'll update it periodically, but we will not be able to keep pace with the rate of change.)\nInvesting Advertisers\nAs a general rule, if you see ads from a company on our site and emails, that company is paying us for such placement. Some of the major ones include E*Trade, Fidelity, Scottrade, OptionsHouse, and ShareBuilder. Additionally, companies pay us for inclusion in specific areas of our site (e.g., Registration Page, Broker Center).\nMotley Fool Money\nA portion of our site, branded as Motley Fool Money, writes reviews of personal finance products, including credit cards, mortgage offers, and brokerage accounts. We may receive compensation for offers that appear on Motley Fool Money, including compensation related to placement.\nWe may issue recommendations for preferred partners that we believe in and/or use ourselves. But keep in mind, this site may not include all available offers from our partners. For example, there are thousands of credit cards available. We\u2019ll highlight a fraction of them. All picks are made at the editorial discretion of Motley Fool Money editorial team.\nFor a list of major advertisers on Motley Fool Money, click here.\nDistribution Partners\nSome of our major distribution partners include Yahoo! Finance, MSN Money, USA Today, AOL, Nasdaq, and CNN Money.\nNews, Quotes, Data, and Content Providers\nOur major providers include Xignite SIX Financial.\nMajor Service Providers or Other Partners\nSilicon Valley Bank, Slack, Namely, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Worldpay/Vantiv, and Jones Lang LaSalle.\nIn Conclusion\nWe have designed our disclosure and trading guidelines to serve our community, our customers, and our employees fairly. As always, though, you should remember to consider every piece of investment information you receive, here at the Fool or elsewhere, not as a de facto recommendation, but as an idea for further consideration. Even the strongest disclosure policy in the world does not excuse individuals from taking responsibility for their own decisions. Due diligence, critical thought, and use of the most extraordinary device in the world (the human brain) are crucial to your financial success.\nLast updated November 11th, 2024."

CAPS\nCAPS is The Motley Fool's service that allows you to make predictions about stocks, see others' predictions, aggregate community opinions, and track their accuracy. By putting together lots of information from a variety of sources, we hope to provide participants with a way to a) have fun and b) learn to make better investment decisions.\nYou should not assume that the opinions that people express in CAPS are the opinions of The Motley Fool or anything other than the opinions of the individuals expressing them.\nWhen you look at other people's predictions, you should remember that those people may have interests in the stocks that they're making predictions about. For example, some people may hope a company's stock will go up because they own many shares of it; others may hope that it will rise because they (or their sister) work for the company; others may hope that the stock will rise because that will increase their CAPS score and their international prestige. When you review people's predictions (or the stock tips you see on television or hear in the supermarket), you should not assume that the person making a prediction is unbiased or independent. One of the beauties of CAPS, though, is that you can see the performance of people's predictions over time and, we hope, distinguish sound analysis from self-serving nonsense.\nMotley Fool employees may participate in CAPS and they may have interests in the stocks about which they make predictions. Employees display their positions in their online TMF profiles at Fool.com. Any predictions made by Fool employees are their own. They are not speaking on behalf of our company and these predictions are not Motley Fool recommendations.\n7. Intellectual Property\nAll of the Content on our websites and any Service we provide is protected by U.S. and international copyright laws and is the property of The Motley Fool and/or providers of the content under license. By \"Content\" we mean any information, mode of expression, or other materials and services found on The Motley Fool. This includes message boards, blogs, CAPS picks, ratings, podcasts, chats, software, our writings, graphics, videos, and any and all other features. You can find out more information on copyright law and the Internet at www.templetons.com/brad/copymyths.html.\nYou may make one copy of the Content for your personal, non-commercial use, provided that any material copied remains intact and includes the following notice: \"Copyright 1995-2018 [or whatever the current year is] The Motley Fool. All rights reserved.\" Any other copying, distribution, storing, or transmission of any kind, or any commercial use of our Content, is prohibited without The Fool's prior written permission. That means you may not sell, auction, transfer or barter your subscription or any individual publication. You can make or end your own CAPS picks at any time, but those picks, their scoring history, your scoring history, and data aggregated by CAPS remain the property of The Motley Fool.\nYou also may not republish, post, transmit, or distribute the Content to online bulletin and message boards, blogs, chat rooms, intranets, or anywhere else without our consent. You further agree not to create abstracts from or scrape our Content, including CAPS ratings, for use on another website or service (including our own personal forums and blogs). In short, you may not post our Content anywhere else online. Aside from opening yourself up to liability, distributing our premium Services, stock picks, and performance data to other sites and forums is unfair to our members who pay good money to receive our Content. So please don't do it.\nPlease note that notwithstanding the foregoing, when you post content (such as a message-board post or CAPS pitch), you are not somehow surrendering your copyright in your expression, but you are granting us an unlimited license to use it. Specifically, by posting content, you agree that The Motley Fool has an irrevocable, perpetual, and worldwide license to use republish, distribute, reproduce, display, communicate to the public, adapt, perform, store, translate, sublicense, and promote anything you post on our websites. This includes the rights to syndicate and make derivative works out of your content. If you don't want us to use or republish your content, then please don't post it on our websites. We'll only republish your content in context, and we'll credit you as author (unless we're using small quotations). We won't republish your posts in advertising without your permission. And we promise not to mock you unless it would amuse us.\nWe also ask that you only upload or include on our Services materials you have the right to use. While we don\u2019t mind if Peter Parker posts photos he\u2019s taken on our platform, we do ask that he not repost images he\u2019s already sold or licensed to The Daily Bugle. If you have a good faith belief that your work has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, please notify our Copyright Agent.\nYou agree not to display any of The Motley Fool's trademarks or use them in any manner without our express written permission. You can find the list of our trademarks here.\nSome features of our site are patented under U.S. Patent No. 7,813,986 and U.S. Patent No. 7,882,006.\n8. Conduct\nThe Motley Fool champions active and open debate among our members. All we ask is that it's done in a lawful and civil manner -- be it posting on our boards, commenting on blogs or articles, replying to CAPS pitches, or using our system to contact a fellow member in any way.\nAccordingly, you agree to use The Motley Fool for lawful purposes only. You may not use or allow others to use your Fool membership to:\n- Post or transmit any content that is disruptive, uncivil, abusive, vulgar, profane, obscene, hateful, fraudulent, threatening, harassing, defamatory, or which discloses private or personal matters concerning any person;\n\u2022 Post or transmit any material that you don't have the right to transmit under law (such as copyrights, trade secrets, or securities) or under contractual or fiduciary relationships (such as nondisclosure agreements);\n\u2022 Post, transmit, or link to sexually explicit material;\n\u2022 Impersonate any person, or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity;\n\u2022 Post or transmit any advertising, promotional materials, or other forms of solicitation, including chain letters and pyramid schemes;\n\u2022 Violate any applicable law or regulation while accessing and using our sites, including, without limitation, the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the national or other securities exchanges (especially and including the rule against making false or misleading statements to manipulate the price of any security);\n\u2022 Offer, sell, or buy any security;\n\u2022 Post or transmit any file that contains viruses, corrupted files, \"Trojan Horses,\" or any other contaminating or destructive features that may damage someone's computer;\n\u2022 Forge headers or manipulate identifiers or other data in order to disguise the origin of any content transmitted through our sites or to manipulate your presence on our sites;\n\u2022 Use any automated means, including, without limitation, agents, robots, scripts, or spiders, to access, monitor, copy or harvest data from any part of our sites;\n\u2022 Take any action that imposes an unreasonably or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure or disrupts the functioning of our systems or Services; and\n\u2022 Take any action that damages or disrupts the functioning of our systems or Services.\nUnauthorized access of our sites is a breach of these Terms and Conditions and a violation of the law. You agree not to access our sites by any means other than through the interfaces we provide for use in our accessing our sites.\nThe Motley Fool may at any time, without prior notice and at our sole discretion, remove any post, terminate any membership, remove any individual CAPS picks, delete any CAPS players, remove any CAPS scorecards, or take any action for violating the above (and, if we may say so, sensible) provisions or otherwise taking an action disruptive to a Service. In the event TMF terminates your premium Service, you will receive a prorated refund at our discretion.\nYou are responsible for statements made and actions taken through the use of your password, so please maintain the confidentiality of your password. You agree to immediately notify Member Support of any actual or suspected unauthorized use of your username and password. We will not be responsible for any loss to you arising from unauthorized use of your data. For more information on posting, please see our Posting Guidelines.\nIf you see something that you feel is a violation of the Fool's Rules, please notify us by emailing [email protected].\n9. No Personalized Advice\nWe want to help you make money. However, The Motley Fool is not in the business of rendering personalized investment advice. We can't know all the relevant facts about you and your individual needs, and we cannot claim or represent that any particular Services are suitable for you. Accordingly, you agree that any recommendation or action taken by a Service does not constitute a recommendation that a particular security, strategy, or action is suitable for you. If you want personal advice, then you should seek a registered investment advisor.\nThe Motley Fool may partner with third parties in order to make buying our Services' recommendations easier for you. We will not, and cannot, trade on your behalf at your brokerage. Only you can decide whether or not a stock is right for you and you agree to be liable for any trades you initiate at your brokerage using tools that we or our partners provide.\nAffiliates of The Motley Fool provide individualized investment advice and investment products. These companies may recommend or hold securities mentioned in our publications. Editorial personnel have no nonpublic knowledge of our affiliates' holdings and/or specific recommendations, and the affiliates\u2019 personnel have no knowledge of any editorial content before it is published.\n10. You Bear Responsibility for Your Financial and Investment Decisions\nOne of the principal tenets here at the Fool is that the best person to handle your finances is you. By your use of our Services, you're agreeing that you bear responsibility for your own investment research and investment decisions. You also agree that The Motley Fool, its directors, its employees, and its agents will not be liable for any investment decision made or action taken by you and others based on news, information, opinion, or any other material published through our Services.\n11. Disclaimer of Warranties and Liabilities\nPlease read The Motley Fool's Disclaimer, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nThe Motley Fool provides a very broad range of information and commentary via its many Services. Consequently, as a result of the diverse opinions of our staff, a Fool Service may, from time to time, take actions or issue recommendations with regard to specific securities that are different from those taken or issued by another Service we provide.\nThe Motley Fool does not warrant the completeness or accuracy of the Content found in our Services or its usefulness for any particular purpose. And although we have the hardest-working, most talented techies in the business, The Motley Fool makes no promises that our content or any of the Services will be delivered to you on an uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free basis. In fact, we're not making any promises or warranties except that we'll do our best to provide interesting and helpful information, education, and entertainment. Other than that, we reserve the right to be wrong, stupid, or even foolish (with a small \"f\").\nNow what does all this mean? It means that you agree that under no circumstances will The Motley Fool, its employees, or its agents be liable for direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, or any other type of damages resulting from your use, purchase, or downloading of any material on our Websites, or arising from or related to these Terms or the Privacy Policy, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages. This includes, but is no way limited to, loss or injury caused in whole or in part by our negligence or by stuff beyond our control in creating or delivering any of our Services. This disclaimer of liability does not apply in New Jersey.\nThe Fool relies on various sources of information that we believe to be accurate and reliable. There are also literally thousands of contributors here -- most, we believe, with incredibly interesting and insightful information and opinions to share. But we can't and won't take responsibility for, or make any claims or representations about, the accuracy, completeness, or even the truth of every bit of data, information, and opinion provided through our Services. Remember: All information and content provided on or by The Motley Fool is to be used on an \"as is, with all faults, we're not perfect\" basis.\nObligatory Capitalized Disclaimers of Liability:\nEXCEPT WHERE OTHERWISE INAPPLICABLE OR PROHIBITED BY LAW, THE WEBSITE AND PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CONTAINED AND OFFERED ON THE WEBSITE ARE PROVIDED \u201cAS IS\u201d AND ON AN \u201cAS AVAILABLE\u201d BASIS. NEITHER THE MOTLEY FOOL NOR ANY OF OUR PARTNERS MAKES ANY WARRANTY THAT THE QUALITY OF ANY PRODUCTS, SERVICES, INFORMATION, OR OTHER MATERIAL THAT YOU PURCHASE OR OBTAIN FROM THE USE OF OUR SERVICES WILL MEET YOUR EXPECTATIONS OR THAT AND ANY ERRORS WILL BE IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED. NEITHER WE NOR ANY OF OUR PARTNERS MAKES ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO OUR WEBSITES, ANY CONTENT, OR ANY OF OUR SERVICES, TOOLS, PRODUCTS, OR PROPERTIES. YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE THAT YOU WILL ASSUME THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SERVICES AND THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF THEIR CONTENT.\nSOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS OR EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH STATES, OUR LIABILITY AND THAT OF OUR THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES DOES NOT APPLY IN NEW JERSEY.\nThat was tiresome, but important.\n12. Communication\nFederal or state law may require that we notify you of certain events. You hereby acknowledge and consent that such notices will be effective upon our posting them on our websites or sending them to you via email (another reason to please keep your account settings current). If you do not provide us with accurate information, we cannot be held liable if we fail to notify you. You may request that we provide such notices to you in paper format by writing to General Counsel, The Motley Fool, LLC, 2000 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314.\n13. Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration and Class Action Waiver\nIf a dispute arises in connection with your use of our Services or in relation to any of these Terms (collectively, \u201cDisputes\u201d) our hope is that we can resolve the matter informally. Accordingly, in the event of a Dispute, we agree to first contact each other via email with a description of the Dispute and any proposed resolution. You will email [email protected] with your concern and The Motley Fool will contact you via the email address we have on file for you.\nIf a Dispute cannot be resolved informally, we each agree that except as provided below, the Dispute will be submitted to final and binding arbitration before a panel of three arbitrators of the American Arbitration Association (\u201cAAA\u201d) in a location convenient to you. Either party may commence the arbitration process by submitting a written demand for arbitration with the AAA, and providing a copy to the other party. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the AAA\u2019s Commercial Dispute Resolutions Procedures, Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, in effect at the time of submission of the demand for arbitration. We will pay all of the filing costs, including arbitrator fees. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You expressly agree to refrain from bringing or joining any claims in any representative or class-wide capacity, including but not limited to bringing or joining any claims in any class action or any class-wide arbitration.\nYOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE YOUR CASE AND TO BE PARTY TO A CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE TO HAVE ANY CLAIMS DECIDED INDIVIDUALLY AND ONLY THROUGH ARBITRATION.\nEXCEPTIONS\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the following will not be subject to arbitration and may be adjudicated only in the state and federal courts of Virginia: (i) any dispute, controversy, or claim related to or contesting the validity of our proprietary rights, including without limitation, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, or trade secrets; or (ii) an action by a party for temporary, preliminary, or permanent injunctive relief, whether prohibitive or mandatory, or other provisional relief. You may also file an individual action in a small claims court in lieu of arbitration.\nOPTING OUT\nYou will have thirty (30) days from the date you submit your personally identifiable information to opt out of this arbitration agreement. To opt out of arbitration, you must contact us at The Motley Fool, LLC, 2000 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314, Attention: Legal Department. If more than thirty (30) days have passed, you are not eligible to opt out of arbitration.\n14. Your Agreement to These Terms\nYou acknowledge and agree that by agreeing to these Terms electronically you are expressly agreeing to the terms set forth herein. You acknowledge that your electronic submission constitutes your agreement and intent to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.\n15. Everything Else\nIf any provision in these Terms and Conditions is found to be invalid, unenforceable, or nonsensical, the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect. This agreement is and always will be governed by the laws of the United States of America and the Commonwealth of Virginia (except with respect to choice of law).You agree that the proper forum for any claim arising thereunder will be the U.S. Court for the Eastern District of Virginia or the appropriate Virginia court.\nOur Services are directed at a U.S. audience. We cannot warrant that the Services are appropriate for users outside the United States or that use of the Services is permitted under the laws of other jurisdictions. All personal data is maintained in the United States under the terms of our Privacy Policy, which is also incorporated by reference.\nExcept as otherwise expressly stated in these Terms and Conditions, there are no third-party beneficiaries to this agreement.\nThese Terms and Conditions, including those that are incorporated by reference, constitute the entire and only agreement between you and The Motley Fool and govern your use of our sites.\nLast Updated: November 17th, 2024\nhttps://www.fool.com/legal/stuff-we-own/"

You will be redirected momentarily\u2026\nFollowing a major tariff policy shift, a new AI Gold Rush is taking shape.\nIt\u2019s already being measured in trillions, and what we\u2019re witnessing could be a once-in-a-lifetime reshoring of America\u2019s tech infrastructure.\nBest of all: Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner is predicting there will be one stock that could be a clear winner.\nConsider this\u2026\nEarlier this year NVIDIA announced something unbelievably bold.\nEvery supercomputer would be built entirely in the USA - for the first time ever.\nThe total investment in America: $500 billion over four years.\nThat number should already have investors drooling with anticipation, but if you\u2019ve been paying attention, the story gets even better\u2026\nThat\u2019s because NVIDIA\u2019s announcement - while historic on its own - is just one of many dominoes we expect to fall in the near future.\n- Apple is furiously working to move production out of China, and recently announced $500 billion invested in the USA over the next four years.\n- And ChatGPT-creator OpenAI recently unveiled its \u2018Stargate\u2019 project that aims to invest $500 billion entirely in the United States in the next four years.\nAdd that up and it's already at $1.5 trillion.\nKeep in mind, NVIDIA was the first to act, announcing a bold $500 billion commitment to U.S. expansion almost immediately after the policy shift.\nSince then, we\u2019ve seen a growing wave of companies following in NVIDIA\u2019s gigantic footsteps\u2026 and all signs point to more on the way.\nWhat we\u2019re seeing is something that could be a once-in-a-lifetime reshoring of America\u2019s dominant technology companies.\nAll announced in what could be as short as a 90-day window. America\u2019s high-tech is now \u2018Made in the USA.\u2019\nHere\u2019s the best part: every media headline is focused on how bad tariffs are\u2026. And certainly, many companies will be losers.\nOnce again, we believe this is a once-in-a-lifetime shift happening rapidly before our eyes\u2026\nYet, almost no one is focusing on the fact that this multi-trillion dollar reshoring could mean potential MASSIVE gains for a small group of companies.\nThink of the companies that need to build trillions of dollars of factories, data centers, and other technology flooding back into America.\nLegendary investor and Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner just identified a small - less than 1/100th the size of NVIDIA - American company (headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut!) that does exactly this.\nIt specializes in the construction of massive technology projects and could soon become the \u2018story stock\u2019 of the potential Made in the USA boom.\nSo while some investors are content to sit and watch their net worth whittle away as tariff story after tariff story hits the news\u2026.\nWe believe we\u2019ve found something completely different.\nA stock that could become the next big winner of this possibly Made in the USA boom.\nBut \u2026. Tick, tick, tick\u2026 The clock is winding down. If you want to get invested before the next wave of technology companies announces their own Made in the USA plans\u2026\nYou need to consider acting now.
