  "description": "Directed by Mark Lewis, this bare-bones but engaging documentary follows the aftermath of the 2003 Antwerp diamond robbery, offering frank commentary from the investigators.",
  "content": "The official loss figure attached to the subject of \u201cStolen: Heist of the Century\u201d was $100 million in U.S. dollars, though Agim De Bruycker , former commander of Belgium\u2019s \u201cdiamond squad,\u201d says, \u201cI am absolutely sure the figure was much higher.\u201d Or, these days, lower: The rise of synthetic gems and their undermining of the traditional market might now place the infamous 2003 Antwerp diamond robbery in a much less glamorous category of caper. But \u201cStolen\u201d is a period piece, as well as a police procedural.\n\nIt is, also, a curiously engaging, bare-bones documentary, adapted by director Mark Lewis from the book \u201cFlawless\u201d by Scott Andrew Selby and Greg Campbell . Its charms actually lie in its lack of embellishment and in straightforward storytelling. While there is a variety of atmospheric editing and scene-setting visuals, almost the entire account is told through the recollections of a handful of people, principally Mr. De Bruycker and fellow detective Patrick Peys . The crime occurred long enough ago that no one then involved is afraid of talking now, especially Leonardo Notarbartolo , a Sicilian career criminal who claims not to have been the mastermind of the crime, but was eventually sentenced to 10 years in prison.",
