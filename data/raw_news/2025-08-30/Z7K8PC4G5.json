  "title": "Spirit Airlines files for bankruptcy protection again",
  "description": "Spirit Airlines has filed for fresh bankruptcy protection months after emerging from a Chapter 11 reorganization",
  "content": "In a quarterly report issued earlier this month, Spirit Aviation Holdings, the carrier's parent company, said it had \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d about its ability to continue as a going concern over the next year \u2014 which is accounting-speak for running out of money. Spirit cited \u201cadverse market conditions\" the company faced after its most recent restructuring and other efforts to revive its business.\n\nThat included weak demand for domestic leisure travel, which Spirit said persisted in the second quarter of its fiscal year, and \u201cuncertainties in its business operations\u201d that the Florida company expects to continue \u201cfor at least the remainder of 2025.\u201d\n\nKnown for its no-frills, low-cost flights on a fleet of bright yellow planes, Spirit has struggled to recover and compete since the COVID-19 pandemic. Rising operation costs and mounting debt eventually led the company to seek bankruptcy protection in November. By the time of that Chapter 11 filing, the airline had lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020.\n\nWhen Spirit emerged from bankruptcy protection in March, the company successfully restructured some of its debt obligations and secured new financing for future operations. Spirit has continued to make other cost-cutting efforts since \u2014 including plans to furlough about 270 pilots and downgrade some 140 captains to first officers in the coming months.\n\nThe furloughs and downgrades announced last month go into effect Oct. 1 and Nov. 1 to align with Spirit's \u201cprojected flight volume for 2026,\u201d the company noted in its quarterly report. They also follow previous furloughs and job cuts before the company's bankruptcy filing last year.\n\nDespite these and other cost-cutting efforts, Spirit has said it needs more cash. As a result, the company said it may also sell certain aircraft and real estate.\n\nAnd as discount carriers struggle to compete with bigger airlines \u2014 many of which have snagged budget-conscious customers through their own tiered offerings \u2014 Spirit is attempting to tap into the growing market for more upscale travel. It is now offering flight options with tiered prices, the higher-priced tickets coming with more amenities.\n\nSpirit\u2019s aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has also made the airline an attractive takeover target. But such buyout attempts from budget rivals like JetBlue and Frontier were unsuccessful both before and during the bankruptcy process.\n\nSpirit operates 5,013 flights to 88 destinations in the U.S., the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America, Panama and Colombia, according to travel search engine Skyscanner.net",

Spirit estimated the compensation agreement with Pratt & Whitney would improve its liquidity by between $150 million and $200 million.\nSpirit shares rose less than 1% in morning trading to $4.45 a share. The company\u2019s stock plummeted to all-time lows this year after its $3.8 billion merger with JetBlue was blocked by a federal judge who said the deal would harm competition and increase prices for air travelers.\nBefore the JetBlue deal fell apart, the merger was considered a lifeline for the struggling Spirit, which last turned a full-year profit in 2019."

      "text": "Frontier makes another takeover bid for Spirit Airlines and it is rejected, again\nSpirit Airlines has again rejected a third takeover bid from budget rival Frontier, saying that it would focus on its own plan to emerge from bankruptcy and stabilize its finances.\nThe offer this week, like the last bid, offers Spirit stakeholders $400 million in newly issued debt and a 19% stake in Frontier Group Holdings Inc., the parent company of Frontier.\n\u201cWe remain convinced that the combination of Spirit and Frontier would have created more value than Spirit\u2019s stand-alone plan,\u201d Frontier said late Tuesday. \u201cThat said, we are disciplined acquirors and are focused on delivering for Frontier shareholders at a time when our airline is performing well in a dynamic market environment.\u201d\nThe offer from Frontier late last month was also rejected almost immediately by Spirit.\nSpirit said that it did offer a counterproposal to Frontier this month, but that was rejected. The Florida airline has a hearing in court on its reorganization plan Thursday.\nSpirit anticipates completing the restructuring in the first quarter.\nFrontier\u2019s first attempt to merge with Spirit was in 2022, but it was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block JetBlue\u2019s $3.8 billion proposal, saying that it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares. A federal judge agreed in with the Justice Department in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger bid two months later.\nSpirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, filed for bankruptcy protection in November after working out terms with bondholders. The airline has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion in 2025 and 2026.\nThe biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2014 sagged this past summer because of a glut of new flights.\nShares of Frontier Group fell 5% in afternoon trading Wednesday."

      "text": "Spirit Airlines is going upscale. In a break from its history, it will offer fares with extra perks\nSpirit Airlines is moving farther away from its history as a fee-happy budget airline and will start selling tickets that include some of its most popular extras in bundles.\nThe Florida-based airline said Tuesday the top ticket will be a \u201cGo Big\u201d package that includes priority check-in, a roomier seat, snacks and drinks, a checked bag, a carry-on bag and free WiFi.\nCEO Ted Christie said the changes are \u201ctaking low-fare travel to new heights.\u201d They also indicate the deep trouble with Spirit\u2019s longtime business model.\nThe airline with bright yellow planes hasn\u2019t made a full-year profit since 2019 \u2014 it has lost nearly $2.4 billion since \u2014 leading industry analysts to mull whether a bankruptcy filing could be in Spirit\u2019s future.\nFull-service carriers Delta and United account for an outsized share of the U.S. airline industry\u2019s profit, and they are doing it by focusing on premium flyers while also selling bare-bones \u201cbasic economy\u201d fares that compete with Spirit, Frontier and Allegiant for travelers on tight budgets.\nThe budget carriers have suffered more than the giants from a glut of flights within the United States, which has led to price-cutting. Delta, United and American have a booming business right now in long-haul international flights that can offset weak pricing power at home. Spirit does not.\nThe budget carriers are trying to adapt. Frontier Airlines \u2014 which, like Spirit, has been losing money for more than four years \u2014 matched a pandemic-era move by the bigger airlines and dropped flight-change and cancellation fees for many customers this spring. Spirit quickly copied the move.\nSpirit has other problems, including a looming debt payment of more than $1 billion and a shortage of planes because some of its jets are grounded for inspections and repairs of Pratt & Whitney engines. Spirit expects compensation of up to $200 million from the engine maker, but its condition is dire enough that Spirit announced in April it would furlough some pilots and delay delivery of new jets.\nTD Cowen analysts downgraded Spirit shares to \u201cSell\u201d this month and said if Spirit can\u2019t renegotiate its debt or return leased planes to lessors, a pre-packaged bankruptcy filing is possible.\nSpirit\u2019s announcement Tuesday targets travelers who might not consider a budget airline.\nIt said customers will be able to book any of the four new ticket bundles starting Aug. 16. That means they won\u2019t be available during the height of summer-vacation travel but will be in use over the busy Labor Day holiday.\n\u201cWe listened to our guests and are excited to deliver what they want: choices for an elevated experience that are affordable and provide unparalleled value,\u201d Christie said in a statement issued by Spirit.\nSpirit shares gained 5% in afternoon trading but are down more than 80% this year."

      "text": "US budget airlines are struggling. Will pursuing premium passengers solve their problems?\nUS budget airlines are struggling. Will pursuing premium passengers solve their problems?\nDALLAS (AP) \u2014 Delta and United have become the most profitable U.S. airlines by targeting premium customers while also winning back a significant share of travelers on a tight budget.\nThat is squeezing smaller low-fare carriers like Spirit Airlines, which filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday. Some travel-industry experts think Spirit\u2019s troubles indicate that travelers on a budget will be left with fewer choices and higher prices.\nOther discount airlines are on much better financial footing than Spirit, but they too are lagging far behind the full-service airlines when it comes to recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. Most industry experts think Frontier Airlines and other so-called ultra-low-cost carriers will fill the vacuum if Spirit shrinks, and that there is still plenty of competition to prevent prices from spiking.\nSpirit Airlines has lost more than $2.2 billion since the start of 2020. Frontier has not reported a full-year profit since 2019, although that slump might end this year. And Allegiant Air\u2019s parent company is still profitable, but less so than before the pandemic.\nThose kind of numbers \u2014 and of course, some promotion of his own airline \u2014 led United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby to declare recently that low-cost carriers were using \u201ca fundamentally flawed business model\u201d and customers hate flying on them.\nKirby\u2019s touchdown dance might turn out to be premature, but many analysts are wary about the near-term prospects for budget airlines, which charge cheaper fares but more fees than the big airlines.\nWhat is ailing low-cost airlines?\nLow-cost airlines grew in the last two decades by undercutting big carriers on ticket prices, thanks in large part to lower costs, including hiring younger workers who were paid less than their counterparts at Delta Air Lines, United and American Airlines. Wages have soared across the industry in the last two years, however, narrowing that cost advantage.\nAt the same time, the big airlines rolled out and refined their no-frills, \u201cbasic economy\u201d tickets to compete directly with Spirit, Frontier and other budget carriers for the most price-sensitive travelers.\nThe budget airlines have also become less efficient at using planes and people. As their growth slowed, they wound up with more of both than they needed. In 2019, Spirit planes were in the air an average of 12.3 hours every day. By this summer, the planes spent an average of two more hours each day sitting on the ground, where they don\u2019t make money.\nSpirit\u2019s costs per mile jumped 32% between 2019 and 2023.\nAnother issue is that airlines added too many flights. Budget airlines and Southwest Airlines were among the worst offenders, but full-service airlines piled on. To make up for a drop in business travel, the big carriers added more flights on domestic leisure routes. The result: Too many seats on flights into popular tourist destinations such as Florida and Las Vegas, which drove down prices, especially for economy-class tickets.\nTom Fitzgerald, an airline analyst at TD Cowen, said that after doing a good job tweaking their basic-economy offerings, the bigger airlines now are enjoying a boom on the premium travel side.\n\u201cPost-COVID, people have seemingly been willing to pay a lot more to have a better experience\u201d with flights and lodging, he said, \u201cand the legacy carriers are a lot better positioned to cater to that demand. They have premium economy, they have first-class.\u201d\nSeeking \u2018something a little better\u2019 in the air\nLow-cost airlines are responding by following the old adage that if you can\u2019t beat them, join them. That means going premium, following the rapidly growing household wealth among upper-income people.\nFrontier Airlines organized its fares into four bundles in May, with buyers of higher-priced tickets getting extras such as priority boarding, more legroom, and checked bags. The airline dropped ticket-change or cancellation fees except for the cheapest bundle.\nSpirit followed in August with similar changes, blocking middle seats and charging passengers more for the comfort of aisle and window seats.\nJetBlue Airways, which began flying more than 20 years ago as a low-cost carrier but with amenities, is digging out from years of steady losses. Under new CEO Joanna Geraghty, the first woman to lead a major U.S. airline, JetBlue is cutting unprofitable routes, bolstering core markets that include the Northeast and Florida, and delaying deliveries of $3 billion worth of new planes.\nPerhaps the biggest change is coming at Southwest Airlines. Starting next year, Southwest will toss out a half-century tradition of \u201copen seating\u201d \u2014 passengers picking their own seat after boarding the plane. Executives say extensive surveying showed that 80% of customers preferred an assigned seat, and that\u2019s especially true with coveted business travelers.\nComing out of the pandemic, \u201cthere is a clear preference for more premium,\u201d Southwest CEO Robert Jordan said. \u201cPremium is kind of self-defined \u2014 whether that is extra legroom, first-class to Europe, whatever it is \u2014 but there is a rise in the desire for premium, something a little better.\u201d\nJordan said it\u2019s not clear why demand for premium products and experiences have grown so rapidly, but figures on wealth offer one explanation.\nThe top one-fifth of U.S. households by income have added $35 trillion in wealth since 2019 and holds nearly nine times the wealth of the middle fifth, according to the Federal Reserve. That gives the wealthiest households plenty of money to spend on premium travel.\nMore crowded planes might also be pushing passengers to spend more to escape a middle seat in the back of the plane.\nWhatever the reasons, Delta executives say they expect sales of premium tickets will surpass the airline\u2019s revenue from main-cabin tickets by 2027.\nAn American problem?\nIn other parts of the world, budget carriers are doing just fine. They have bounced back from the pandemic just like their more highbrow competitors.\nSome industry experts say low-cost carriers in Asia and Europe have always attracted a more diverse mix of passengers, while in the United States, affluent and middle-class travelers look down their noses at low-cost carriers.\nJamie Baker, an analyst for JPMorgan, says he has many college friends who work in London and fly Irish airline Ryanair all the time, but he hardly knows anyone who has ever been on a Spirit or Frontier plane.\n\u201cThere is no stigma for anybody to fly Ryanair or easyJet in Europe. Meanwhile \u2014 not to pick on Spirit or kick them when they are down \u2014 but it\u2019s sort of the airline booty call,\u201d Baker recently told an audience of pilots for other airlines, who roared in laughter.\nEyeing up the competition\nDelta CEO Ed Bastian is less dismissive of the \u201clower-end carriers\u201d in the U.S. than United\u2019s Kirby.\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that segment ever disappearing,\u201d Bastian said this week, after Spirit\u2019s bankruptcy filing. \u201cI think there\u2019s a market for it.\u201d\nAt the same time, he said the upscale moves by ultra-low-cost carriers are having no effect on his airline. Delta targets upscale travelers but also introduced basic-economy fares a decade ago, when discounters emerged as a growing threat to poach some of Delta\u2019s customers.\n\u201cJust calling yourself a premium carrier and actually being a premium carrier are two totally different things,\u201d Bastian said \u201cIt\u2019s not the size of the seat or how much room you have; it\u2019s the overall experience.\u201d"

But there are those who love it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTo those dedicated customers of Spirit, this one\u2019s for you.\u201d\nYoung said that a JetBlue-Spirit combination \u201cwould likely place stronger competitive pressure on the larger airlines in the country. At the same time, however, the consumers that rely on Spirit\u2019s unique, low-price model would likely be harmed.\u201d\nShares of Spirit Airlines Inc. plunged 47% after the ruling, while JetBlue shares gained 5%.\nJetBlue and Spirit said they disagreed with the ruling and were considering whether to appeal.\nNew York-based JetBlue had argued that it needs the deal to grow in one move and better compete against bigger rivals that dominate the U.S. air-travel market.\n\u201cWe continue to believe that our combination is the best opportunity to increase much needed competition and choice by bringing low fares and great service to more customers in more markets,\u201d the airlines said in a statement.\nThe ruling was a victory for the Biden administration, which has moved aggressively to block consolidation in several industries.\n\u201cCapitalism without competition isn\u2019t capitalism \u2014 it\u2019s exploitation,\u201d President Joe Biden said on X, formerly known as Twitter. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is a victory for consumers everywhere who want lower prices and more choices. My Administration will continue to fight to protect consumers and enforce our antitrust laws.\u201d\nFor JetBlue, the ruling was its second major setback in federal court in less than a year. Another judge in the same Boston courthouse killed a partnership in the Northeast between JetBlue and American Airlines.\nJetBlue, the nation\u2019s sixth-largest airline by revenue, now must come up with another growth plan. That will be an assignment for incoming CEO Joanna Geraghty. Next month she will replace Robin Hayes, who had engineered both of the deals that have now been blocked in court.\nTuesday\u2019s ruling could open the door for Frontier Airlines to make another attempt to buy Spirit. The two budget airlines announced a cash-and-stock deal in 2022, only to have JetBlue make an all-cash offer and win a bidding war for Florida-based Spirit.\nSpirit\u2019s CEO and board initially opposed a sale to JetBlue, arguing presciently that regulators would try to block a deal that would eliminate a low-cost carrier from the U.S. landscape \u2014 JetBlue planned to repaint Spirit\u2019s planes and remove some seats to match JetBlue\u2019s roomier interior.\nTo overcome that resistance, JetBlue agreed to pay Spirit a reverse breakup fee of $70 million and pay Spirit shareholders $400 million if the deal failed because of government opposition.\nHelane Becker, an airline analyst for the financial-services firm Cowen, said Spirit will likely now search for a new buyer, but it\u2019s more likely to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy restructuring.\nBoth JetBlue and Spirit have struggled to recover from the pandemic while their bigger rivals have returned to healthy profitability. JetBlue has lost more than $2 billion since the start of 2020, and Spirit \u2014 weighed down by higher costs and weaker demand \u2014 has lost more than $1.6 billion in that time.\nThat generated some sympathy for a merger between them \u2014 and criticism of the judge\u2019s ruling.\n\u201cBlocking a merger of smaller competitors trying to combine resources and scale up to compete with the top four airlines makes little sense,\u201d said Jessica Melugin, an antitrust expert at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which opposes government intervention in the market. \u201cIt risks making both Spirit and JetBlue less able to compete with the big guys and ultimately leaving the airline industry less competitive, harming consumers.\u201d\nBut the decision was praised by critics of mergers over the past 15 years that have eliminated Continental, Northwest, US Airways, AirTran and Virgin America.\n\u201cThis is an enormous victory for travelers, workers, and local communities, and another huge win for antitrust enforcers\u201d at the Justice Department, said William McGee, an air-travel expert at the American Economic Liberties Project.\nThe government\u2019s victory could make it more likely that it will challenge Alaska Airlines\u2019 proposal to buy Hawaiian Airlines for $1 billion and pick up about $900 million in Hawaiian\u2019s debt.\n\u201cThe days of relentless consolidation are over. We hope to see judges presiding over future airline mergers, like Alaska-Hawaiian, follow Judge Young\u2019s lead,\u201d McGee said.\nThe government hasn\u2019t said whether it will sue to stop Alaska from buying Hawaiian. The administration might have tipped its hand, however. \u201cThe Justice Department will continue to vigorously enforce the nation\u2019s antitrust laws to protect American consumers,\u201d Attorney General Merrick Garland said.\n___\nThis story has been clarified to note that a statement originally attributed to JetBlue is from JetBlue and Spirit."

      "text": "Frontier makes a second bid for Spirit as budget airlines struggle\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 No-frills, budget airlines often lead the industry in customer complaints, according to government data, so if one were to disappear would it be missed by travelers?\nThat is a question U.S. regulators will be asking after Frontier Airlines said Wednesday that it wanted to buy Spirit Airlines, which sought bankruptcy protection late last year.\nSpirit said almost immediately that it\u2019s not interested in the sale, and an attempted merger between the two airlines came to nothing in 2022, yet Frontier has not indicated it is ready to take \u2018no\u2019 for an answer.\nOther discount airlines are on much better financial footing than Spirit, but they too are lagging far behind the full-service airlines when it comes to recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic. Most industry experts think Frontier Airlines and other so-called ultra-low-cost carriers will fill the vacuum and that there is still plenty of competition to prevent prices from spiking.\nAnd the most profitable U.S. airlines have begun winning over a larger share of travelers scouring for deals with new ticket offerings.\nFrontier Group Holdings Inc., the parent company of Frontier Airlines, said Wednesday that the proposed deal would include newly issued Frontier debt and common stock.\nFrontier tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion JetBlue deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger bid two months later.\nSpirit filed for bankruptcy protection in November. The biggest U.S. budget airline, Spirit filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition after working out terms with bondholders. The airline has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion in 2025 and 2026.\nThe biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2014 sagged this past summer because of a glut of new flights.\nFrontier is optimistic that it can get a deal done this time around.\n\u201cThis proposal reflects a compelling opportunity that will result in more value than Spirit\u2019s standalone plan by creating a stronger low fare airline with the long-term viability to compete more effectively and enter new markets at scale,\u201d Frontier Chair Bill Franke said in a statement. \u201cWe stand ready to continue discussions with Spirit and its financial stakeholders and believe that we can promptly reach agreement on a transaction.\u201d\nFrontier said that since it submitted its offer, it has had talks with members of Spirit\u2019s board, management team, and representatives of Spirit\u2019s financial stakeholders.\nIn a regulatory filing, Spirit said that it had received a proposal from Frontier earlier this month and after reviewing it, found that the offer would be less beneficial to its shareholders that its existing plan. It said that barring any new developments, it would move forward with its own plans to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.\nShares of Frontier Group rose 6% Wednesday."

      "text": "Spirit Airlines files for bankruptcy as financial losses pile up and debt payments loom\nSpirit Airlines files for bankruptcy as financial losses pile up and debt payments loom\nSpirit Airlines said Monday that it has filed for bankruptcy protection and will attempt to reboot as it struggles to recover from the pandemic-caused swoon in travel, stiffer competition from bigger carriers, and a failed attempt to sell the airline to JetBlue.\nSpirit, the biggest U.S. budget airline, filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition after working out terms with bondholders. The airline has lost more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020 and faces looming debt payments totaling more than $1 billion in 2025 and 2026.\nThe airline said it expects to continue operating normally during the bankruptcy process. Spirit told customers Monday they can book flights and use frequent-flyer points as they ordinarily would, and said employees and vendors would continue getting paid.\nThe airline said it received commitments for a $350 million equity investment from existing bondholders and will convert $795 million of their debt into stock in the restructured company. The bondholders will also extend a $300 million loan that, combined with Spirit\u2019s remaining cash, will help the airline get through the restructuring.\nThe airline\u2019s shares dropped 25% on Friday, after The Wall Street Journal reported that the airline was discussing terms of a possible bankruptcy filing with its bondholders. Spirit, based in Dania Beach, Florida, missed a deadline for filing its third-quarter financial results but announced that its operating margin would indicate a bigger loss than the company had in the same quarter last year.\nThose were just the latest in a series of blows that have sent the stock crashing down by 97% since late 2018 \u2014 when Spirit was still making money.\nCEO Ted Christie confirmed in August that Spirit was talking to advisers of its bondholders about the upcoming debt maturities. On Monday, he called the deal with bondholders \u201ca strong vote of confidence in Spirit and our long-term plan.\u201d\nPeople are still flying on Spirit Airlines. They\u2019re just not paying as much.\nIn the first six months of this year, Spirit passengers flew 2% more than they did in the same period last year. However, they are paying 10% less per mile, and revenue per mile from fares is down nearly 20%, contributing to Spirit\u2019s red ink.\nIt\u2019s not a new trend. Spirit failed to return to profitability when the coronavirus pandemic eased and travel rebounded. There are several reasons behind the slump.\nSpirit\u2019s costs, especially for labor, have risen. The biggest U.S. airlines have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own brand of bare-bones tickets. And fares for U.S. leisure travel \u2014 Spirit\u2019s core business \u2014 sagged this summer because of a glut of new flights.\nThe premium end of the air-travel market has surged while Spirit\u2019s traditional no-frills end has stagnated. So this summer, Spirit decided to sell bundled fares that include a bigger seat, priority boarding, free bags, internet service and snacks and drinks. It also dropped cancellation fees after rival Frontier Airlines did so.\nThose were huge changes from Spirit\u2019s longtime strategy, which focuses on grabbing customers with rock-bottom fares and then getting them to pay extra for things that are free on many other airlines, such as bringing a carry-on bag or ordering a soda.\nIn a highly unusual move, Spirit planned to cut its October-through-December schedule by nearly 20%, compared with the same period last year, which analysts said should help prop up fares. But that would help rivals more than it would boost Spirit.\nAnalysts from Deutsche Bank and Raymond James say that Frontier, JetBlue and Southwest would benefit the most because of their overlap with Spirit on many routes.\nSpirit has also been plagued by required repairs to Pratt & Whitney engines, which is forcing the airline to ground dozens of its Airbus jets. Spirit has cited the recall as it furloughed pilots.\nThe aircraft fleet is relatively young, which has made Spirit an attractive takeover target.\nFrontier tried to merge with Spirit in 2022 but was outbid by JetBlue. However, the Justice Department sued to block the $3.8 billion deal, saying it would drive up prices for Spirit customers who depend on low fares, and a federal judge agreed in January. JetBlue and Spirit dropped their merger two months later.\nU.S. airline bankruptcies were common in the 1990s and 2000s, as airlines struggled with fierce competition, high labor costs and sudden spikes in the price of jet fuel. PanAm, TWA, Northwest, Continental, United and Delta were swept up. Some liquidated, while others used favorable laws to renegotiate debts such as aircraft leases and keep flying.\nThe last bankruptcy by a major U.S. carrier ended when American Airlines emerged from Chapter 11 protection and simultaneously merged with US Airways in December 2013."

      "text": "Spirit Airlines plans to cut jobs and sell some planes amid looming financial struggles\nNEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Spirit Airlines is cutting jobs and selling off some jets worth millions of dollars as the budget carrier aims to cut costs amid looming financial struggles and an uncertain future.\nIn a Thursday regulatory filing, Spirit said it has identified about $80 million of cost-cutting measures set to begin early next year. Those cuts will be driven primarily by a \u201creduction in workforce,\u201d the Florida-based airline noted.\nSpirit did not specify a number for the layoffs or what positions would be impacted. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment further when reached by The Associated Press Friday.\nThe budget airline also disclosed that it\u2019s agreed to sell 23 airplanes to GA Telesis, an aviation services company, for about $519 million. The Airbus A320ceo and A321ceo models, which were manufactured between 2014 and 2019, are expected to be delivered starting this month and through February.\nGA Telesis celebrated the acquisition on Friday, noting that it will significantly boost its fleet portfolio. And Spirit expects the sale\u2019s proceeds, combined with discharging related debt, to benefit its liquidity by $225 million through the end of 2025.\nShares for Spirit climbed 25%, to $3.01, by midday trading Friday. But the stock is down more than 80% over the last year.\nThe last few years have been far from smooth sailing for Spirit. The airline failed to return to profitability when the COVID-19 pandemic eased and travel rebounded \u2014 largely due to rising operational costs and increased competition. Rival carriers have snagged some of Spirit\u2019s budget-conscious customers by offering their own versions of low cost, no-frills tickets.\nLoss after loss has continued to pile up in the meantime \u2014 with the company losing more than $2.5 billion since the start of 2020. Spirit also faces mounting debt, with looming payments totaling more than $1 billion.\nSpirit now estimates its fourth-quarter capacity to drop 20% from last year, according to Thursday\u2019s regulatory filing. And the company expects capacity to fall by the midteens for 2025, which accounts for this month\u2019s sale and prior removal of some other planes from scheduled service due to ongoing problems with the availability of Pratt & Whitney GTF engines.\nBankruptcy speculation has also been hovering over Spirit, which has become an attractive takeover target. Although a merger has yet to be successful. JetBlue recently attempted to buy Spirit, but to two airlines dropped the deal after a federal judge blocked the acquisition over antitrust concerns in January.\nPreviously, Frontier Airlines also tried to merge with Spirit, but was outbid by JetBlue at the time. Earlier this week, however, The Wall Street Journal reported that Frontier was in early talks of exploring a renewed bid, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter.\nThe deal, if reached, could include Spirit restructuring its debt and other liabilities in bankruptcy, per The Journal \u2014 which also reported that the airline continues to be in discussions with bondholders over a potential bankruptcy filing. Spirit\u2019s spokesperson declined to comment.\n_________\nAP Airlines Writer David Koenig in Dallas contributed to this report."
