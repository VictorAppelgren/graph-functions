  "title": "Member of Congress says she was assaulted by gang of youth before Trump DC takeover",
  "description": "Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., condemned \u201cout of control\" violence in the nation\u2019s capital city. She said she was assaulted by a gang of youth in the streets of Washington, D.C.",
  "content": "Rep. Julie Fedorchak, R-N.D., decried \"out of control\" violence in the nation\u2019s capital city and revealed that she was assaulted by a gang of youths in the streets of Washington, D.C., before the Trump administration\u2019s takeover.\n\nSpeaking with reporters outside the Capitol building during a Republican Study Committee (RSC) press conference on Tuesday, Fedorchak, who is the sole member of the House of Representatives from North Dakota, agreed with her fellow Republicans that congressional action is needed to help keep D.C. safe.\n\nShe said she herself was attacked in broad daylight in D.C.\u2019s Navy Yard neighborhood, which is located just a few minutes\u2019 drive from the Capitol and is a popular neighborhood for members of Congress and staffers. The neighborhood is also home to the Nationals' baseball stadium.\n\n\"D.C. is a beautiful city, it's an amazing city, and it's the best capital in the world. But it isn't safe. We all know this,\" said Fedorchak. \"Crime in our nation's capital is out of control. If D.C. were a state, it would have the highest homicide rate in the country.\"\n\n\"In fact, I felt this myself recently in a small way,\" she continued. \"I was walking down the street in July and near my apartment in Navy Yard, not very far from home, and I felt something hard hit me in the in the back of my head. It was broad daylight. I was very startled. I was on the phone at the time, and just as that happened, a pack of juveniles came rushing by on their bikes and I turned to look around and see what had happened. And a large, hard plastic object had been thrown directly at my head.\"\n\n\"Now that was a small, minor incident. I wasn't harmed, but the young people who did it, did it with reckless abandon and with zero fear of consequences,\" she said. \"They gathered in a circle not far from me after that and sat there and laughed.\"\n\nFedorchak said this assault is just another example of \"how crime is out of control in this city, and there aren't any consequences.\"\n\nIn August, President Donald Trump invoked Section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to place the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) under federal control in response to rampant violent crime in the city. One of the reasons cited by the president was the epidemic of violent youth gangs terrorizing residents in the streets of D.C. In early August, a former DOGE staffer named Edward Coristine was violently assaulted by a group of D.C. youths and left bloodied in the street. Trump called the perpetrators \"thugs\" and vowed to exert his powers to federalize D.C.\n\nTRUMP PRAISES DEMOCRATIC DC MAYOR FOR WORKING WITH HIS ADMINISTRATION ON CRIME CRACKDOWN\n\nFedorchak praised Trump\u2019s crackdown in D.C. and agreed with other Republicans present that more action is needed from Congress to help the president restore order to the city.\n\n\"America is the greatest country in the world. There's no reason why our capital should have a violent crime rate higher than some of the most dangerous places in the world,\" she said.\n\n\"Many of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have falsely claimed that D.C. crime stats are at a 30-year low. But let's remember that crime is not just about statistics. It's about people.\"\n\nShe pointed to the recent killing of 21-year-old congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym, who was killed in a drive-by shooting in northwest D.C. in June.\n\n\"It's about the mother who sent her child here to intern in one of our offices this summer, never to see him again. It's about all the families who suffer from crime in this very city. It's about the Metropolitan Police Union, who agrees that they are stretched too thin and don't have the resources to take care of crime in this city, and to provide a safe environment. It's about staffers, interns, families and visitors who live with the daily reality of coming to a city that isn't safe.\"\n\nRep. Ron Estes, R-Kan., whose office Tarpinian-Jachym was interning with when he was killed, also weighed in during the press conference, calling the murder \"a senseless crime.\"\n\n\"To this day, it's not been solved by the Washington, D.C., police \u2026 That's why I applaud President Trump and the work that he's doing in terms of making sure that we do have a safe capital,\" he said.\n\n\"Yesterday, I was able to walk around the Navy Yard with my daughter, and it was great to see the National Guard out there patrolling around,\" he said. \"It was a safe environment for people to hang out. It was nice. There was a family there having a birthday party for one of their children.\"\n\nDuring the press conference, Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyo., announced that Congress would be asserting greater control over D.C. to ensure the city remains safe for residents and visitors.\n\n\"In 1973, Congress granted D.C. limited home rule authority through the District of Columbia Self-Government Reorganization Act, also called the Home Rule Act. In the Home Rule Act, Congress reserves the right at any time to exercise its constitutional authority as the legislature for the district, which includes the right to review and block local legislation before it takes effect. It has now become necessary for Congress to exercise such authority,\" she said.\n\n\"Why? Because the D.C. city council is seeking to exercise its authority not for the best interests of its citizens or the broader community, but for political purposes,\" she continued. \"For years now, the D.C. city council has not only prioritized left-wing policies and programs but intentionally sought to hide their activities from Congress. It is a new day in D.C., however, and Congress intends to once again assert its authority to ensure that Washington, D.C., rightfully reflects and represents this great nation on the national and international stage.\"\n\nRSC Chair August Pfluger, R-Texas, stated, \"Now, Congress must take the next step and use our Article One powers.\"\n\nSEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN CRITICIZES DEMOCRATS WHO MAKE \u2018VILLAINS OUT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT\u2019\n\n\"We cannot and will not allow D.C. to fall into a hellscape again when the local government fails,\" he added. \"It's our constitutional duty to act. Congress has a clear constitutional authority over D.C., and we will use it without hesitation to continue making D.C. safe and great again.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn a separate press conference taking place elsewhere at the Capitol at the same time, Democratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., also commented on Trump\u2019s D.C. crackdown. He downplayed the crackdown\u2019s success, claiming that \"every single area of criminal activity\" was \"on the way down prior to the arrival of the National Guard.\"\n\nJeffries suggested the crackdown was \"probably the result of Donald Trump trying to figure out a way to change the topic, given his deep unpopularity.\"\n\nHe said he would not support Congress extending the emergency declaration to allow the Trump administration to continue its crackdown.",

      "text": "Phillip Todd, lying bloody on a public street, needed someone to pray for him.\nThe then-26-year-old Senate staffer had just been attacked in a random act of violence, one of the many that were brutally etched in 2023 in Washington, D.C. At that moment, he was full of fear and needed a helping hand from a higher power.\nThat higher power, as it turned out, was channeled by the paramedic working to keep him alive.\nGOP SENATORS SAY THEY'RE OPEN TO TRUMP DEPLOYING NATIONAL GUARD IN THEIR STATES' BLUE CITIES\n\"The first thing that I had thought of was, \u2018Well, I need to pray. Maybe I can't pray myself, but someone needs to pray for this,\u2019\" Todd told Fox News Digital. \"So, I asked the paramedic to pray for me. And he said, \u2018Are you Christian? Like, what are you?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Yeah, I'm a Christian.\u2019\"\n\"He goes, \u2018Well, I'm an atheist,\u2019\" Todd continued. \"And I said, \u2018That's fine. You can pray for me.\u2019 He was kind and obliged.\"\nThe incident on H Street in Washington, D.C., could have been the perfect flashpoint for a political operative looking for an anecdote about crime in the district \u2014 to use as a cudgel against Democratic policies in the nation's capital city.\nTodd was working for Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and was attacked in broad daylight in the midst of one of the worst crime years Washington had experienced in the last three decades.\nAfter all, he was millimeters away from becoming a statistic. He was stabbed at least four times, with the knife piercing his skull, nearly severing his ear, plunging through his diaphragm and coming dangerously close to his heart.\nEven now, in the midst of a hyper-politicized push by the Trump administration to crack down on crime in D.C. that has spurred accusations of authoritarianism from Democrats and accolades from Republicans, Todd, who still works on the Hill, has kept politics and what happened to him separate.\nDC STATEHOOD DEBATE INTENSIFIES AS TRUMP FLEXES AUTHORITY OVER LOCAL POLICE\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean he hasn\u2019t struggled with that balance in the years since. A self-described \"political creature,\" Todd said the political thoughts of how his story could be used to shine a light on crime in Washington had bounced around in his head.\nHowever, his focus has been on the deeper connection that he found with his faith, a journey he was already on when his assailant, Glynn Neal, attacked him out of the blue.\n\"The story for me, or the obligation for me, is to focus on the goodness of God, and focus on obedience to God and stewarding that story,\" he said. \"Maybe the politics come later, but I think it seems to me that there's two kind of obligations that anyone who goes through something like this has, and I think there's a personal obligation, there's a societal obligation.\"\nStill, lawmakers and Washington residents are grappling with President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to federalize the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), and flood the district\u2019s streets with federal law enforcement and the National Guard in an effort to crack down on crime.\nWhen asked what he thought of troops walking the streets, Todd said he wasn\u2019t sure what the right solution to crime in the district was, but that he thinks \"it's a problem worth solving.\"\n\"I think what I've told some of my friends, I don't know whether or not troops in the city is the best way to do it,\u2019 Todd said. \"Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. But I do think that the attitude of trying to solve that problem is something that people need to have, and it's worthwhile.\"\nCAPITOL HILL PREPARES FOR HIGH-STAKES BATTLE OVER TRUMP CRIME PACKAGE, DC POLICE AUTHORITY\nOne of the most striking things about Todd is his ability to crack jokes about a knife plunging through his skull and piercing the membrane that surrounds his brain.\nNow, he has a titanium plate that has further affirmed his friends\u2019 belief that he is hard-headed \u2014 it also doesn\u2019t set off metal detectors at the airport, he noted.\nHowever, the fact that he underwent a traumatic situation at the hands of Neal, who had been released from prison just days before the attack after serving over a decade behind bars and was found to be mentally incompetent to stand trial in June, was not lost on him either.\nBut it was his decision to forgive Neal early on while still recovering in his hospital bed, a choice he wondered if he would have made had his entire faculties been there. Nonetheless, it\u2019s one that he stood by and credited for his ability to look at the situation in a light-hearted manner.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"I think the opportunity for redemption in this particular story, it seems to me, and maybe this changes over time, doesn't lie necessarily with the political but lies more on the fact that this was a very egregious crime,\" he said. \"This is a very big wrong that was done to me.\"\n\"It would be totally understandable to have a lot of desire to see retribution,\" Todd continued. \"And yet instill in those moments \u2014 because God had gifted me with the ability to forgive, and God had saved me from death \u2014 showing how obedience to God can also lead others to a life full of meaning and satisfaction and redemption and tough trials and situations.\""

      "text": "Key facts about President Donald Trump: What to know\nDonald Trump served as the 45th President of the United States and was re-elected in 2024 to become the 47th President. He was sworn into office on January 20, 2025. With his 2024 presidential win, Trump became the second person in U.S. history to win non-consecutive terms, following Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President.\nDuring his first campaign, Trump, a real estate developer and reality TV host, successfully defeated Hillary Clinton for the White House. Although he lost the popular vote, he won the Electoral College, securing his first presidential victory.\nThe 2020 presidential election resulted in defeat for Trump, as he lost his re-election bid to Democratic challenger Joe Biden. In 2022, Trump announced his candidacy for the 2024 Presidential election, marking the start of his third campaign.\nIn July 2024, Trump announced Ohio Senator JD Vance as his running mate. The Republicans focused heavily on issues like the economy and border security during their campaign. Trump was victorious against Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, winning both the popular vote and the Electoral College to regain his position as President of the United States.\nIn April 2025, Trump unveiled a series of historic tariffs during a \"Make America Wealthy Again\" event at the White House's Rose Garden. This event was part of a day his administration called \"Liberation Day\" for the United States. Trump argues that these tariffs will help bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. The Trump administration plans to impose tariffs on certain goods from countries such as Mexico, Canada, China, and others.\nPresident Trump is married to First Lady Melania Trump, and together they have one son, Barron Trump.
