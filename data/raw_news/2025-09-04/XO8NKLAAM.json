  "title": "Is IDOX plc (LON:IDOX) Worth UK\u00a30.5 Based On Its Intrinsic Value?",
  "description": "Key Insights IDOX's estimated fair value is UK\u00a30.42 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity IDOX's UK\u00a30.55 share...",
  "content": "\u2022 IDOX's estimated fair value is UK\u00a30.42 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity\n\u2022 IDOX's UK\u00a30.55 share price signals that it might be 30% overvalued\n\u2022 Our fair value estimate is 50% lower than IDOX's analyst price target of UK\u00a30.85 Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of IDOX plc (LON:IDOX) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple! We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. AI is about to change healthcare. These 20 stocks are working on everything from early diagnostics to drug discovery. The best part - they are all under $10bn in marketcap - there is still time to get in early. We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: (\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = UK\u00a386m\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.7%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.9%. Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= UK\u00a3254m\u00f7 ( 1 + 8.9%)10= UK\u00a3109m The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is UK\u00a3195m. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of UK\u00a30.5, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent. Now the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at IDOX as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.199. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. See our latest analysis for IDOX\n\u2022 Debt is not viewed as a risk.\n\u2022 Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.\n\u2022 Earnings growth over the past year underperformed the Software industry.\n\u2022 Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.\n\u2022 Annual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the British market.\n\u2022 Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.\n\u2022 Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the British market. Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price?

  "argos_summary": "IDOX plc\u2019s discounted cash flow analysis values the stock at UK\u00a30.42, about 30% below its current trading price of UK\u00a30.55, implying a 30% overvaluation. The model uses an 8.9% discount rate and a 2.7% terminal growth rate, yielding a present value of equity around UK\u00a3195\u202fm. Analysts project earnings growth of ~23% per year and a 12\u2011month target of UK\u00a30.85, suggesting upside if the company meets its forecasts. The valuation highlights a modest debt profile (20% debt\u2011to\u2011equity) and a healthy cash position, but the high price\u2011to\u2011earnings (40.6\u00d7) relative to peers signals caution for investors seeking value in the UK software sector.",
