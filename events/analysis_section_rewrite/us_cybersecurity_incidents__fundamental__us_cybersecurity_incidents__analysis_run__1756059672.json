      "feedback": "Strong scaffold, but to reach world‑class, convert the piece into a tight, regime‑based, first‑principles framework anchored to BEQPD7RAK and flesh out measurable, multi‑year dynamics; edits in one paragraph: 1) add an explicit regime map (Baseline, Elevated threat, Escalation) with clear transition triggers drawn from the PACER/OCC episodes (e.g., major breach milestones, sustained data exposure of confidential/sealed records) and a multi‑year horizon (2025–2027) plus approximate transition probabilities or timeframes; 2) replace broad statements with a first‑principles risk‑pricing anchor for cyber risk, e.g., define a cyber risk premium P as a function of L (expected loss from breach, including sealed records and informant data), p(T) (breach probability tied to threat intensity—RaaS/AI/zero‑day), E (asset exposure—public vs confidential data), regulatory/IT‑capex (policy reaction function R), and a persistent, structural constraint term; explicitly state invariant anchors such as ongoing threat‑actor sophistication and defense‑in‑depth/zero‑trust deployments; 3) sharpen the causal chain by enumerating market transmission channels (cyber insurance premia, corporate IT/capex, credit/equity pricing in cyber‑exposed sectors, cross‑border data‑flow considerations) and tie them to the regime shifts; 4) quantify where possible using numeric details from the sources (e.g., OCC incident involved unusual email activity with about 100 employees and more than 150,000 emails; 2024 breaches described as affecting millions of records) and note the qualitative aspects (alleged vs confirmed roles); 5) harden the base case by giving a probability/impact band and explicitly listing upside/downside tails; 6) enumerate concrete risks (geopolitical escalation, larger data leakage, supply‑chain compromise) and concrete watch items (PACER security upgrades, OCC findings, rollout of zero‑trust and API‑gateway controls, and evolving threat indicators through 2025–27); 7) reconcile ambiguities in the reporting (Russia involvement is alleged) with hedged language and a clear stance on what would invalidate the scenario; 8) ensure alignment with SECTION FOCUS by ending with a concise base case, defined risks, watchlist, and a calibrated confidence level, all clearly tied to the multi‑year, structural framing in BEQPD7RAK.",
