  "title": "Missing Cosmic Lithium Problem Could Still Point To New Physics",
  "description": "Lithium has long been known to be rare in the cosmos.  But astrophysicists are still puzzled over why it's so much less abundant than predicted by big bang cosmology.",
  "content": "Lithium, currently in such high demand for electric vehicles and smart phones, also continues to push astrophysical theory to the limit. Known as the Cosmological Lithium Problem, the primordial abundance of this light metal has puzzled astrophysicists for more than two decades now. And the eventual solution to this conundrum might require new physics.\n\nThe crux of the issue is the observed underabundance of Lithium-7, a stable isotope of Lithium that consists of three protons and four neutrons.\n\nFor every nucleus of lithium, there are two billion nuclei of hydrogen in the early universe, Andreas Korn, a stellar astrophysicist at Uppsala University in Sweden, tells me in Stockholm.\n\nAnd among old galactic halo stars, the Lithium-7 underabundance is a factor of two to three below big bang nucleosynthesis predictions. That is, the process that (within the first three minutes after the big bang) produced the first light elements --- hydrogen, helium, and tiny amounts of lithium and beryllium.\n\nLithium is not a rare earth element, but it is a very rare element in the cosmos --- about nine orders of magnitude less than hydrogen and five orders of magnitude less than oxygen in the present-day universe.\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\n\nThe Lithium-7 problem is important because it poses the only remaining inconsistency in big bang nucleosynthesis, says Korn. Too much Lithium-7 was produced in the big bang, and we see too little of it in old stars, he says.\n\nIf it\u2019s not solved through conventional theory, then the door will inherently be left ajar for new physics.\n\nDefining the true nature of the universe\u2019s exotic dark matter, for instance, through big bang nucleosynthesis or some other observation would represent a revolution in fundamental physics, says Korn.\n\nPhysicists know that the standard model of particle physics is not complete.\n\nUnsurprisingly, we physicists are looking for clues other than the gravitational effects of the cosmos\u2019 missing exotic dark matter to further constrain the realm of new physics, says Korn. Discrepancies in BBN could provide such clues, he says.\n\nThe hope has been that such an extension of conventional physics could at the same time explain the cosmos\u2019 elusive dark matter.\n\nThe Lithium problem was aptly described in a 2011 review paper.\n\nIn a paper appearing in the journal Annual Reviews of Nuclear and Particle Science, author Brian Fields notes that BBN represents our earliest reliable probe of the cosmos. However, Lithium-7 observations lie at least a factor of three below predictions, he writes.\n\nAnd in the last 14 years since Fields\u2019 paper was published, there has only been incremental progress in resolving this Lithium-7 discrepancy.\n\nPrecise observations of solar neutrinos also point to new physics.\n\nNuclear reaction networks applied to the Sun predict how many neutrinos are created in the fusion reactions, but it turns out that the number of electron neutrinos falls short of expectations, says Korn. They are changed to other types of neutrinos on the way to us, through a process called neutrino oscillations, he says.\n\nBBN also tells us that there were three neutrino types present in the early universe. Any discrepancy between BBN predictions and observations could, in principle, provide such clues for new physics.\n\nBut there is a possibility that most of this problem is simply solved by conventional stellar physics, says Korn.\n\nIn BBN, Lithium represents only a trace element. In the Sun, 99.5% of the lithium is gone because it has been mixed down to layers that are hotter than two and a half million degrees Kelvin, and that Lithium has disintegrated.\n\nHalo stars are very old, metal poor stars on the outskirts of our own Milky Way Galaxy that can trace the state of the universe as it was 10 or 12 billion years ago, says Korn.\n\nBut the challenge is that astronomers have a hard time determining how much lithium and other elements have been mixed deep into the interior of the target star. In particular, theorists need to know how much mixing of lithium occurs at the boundary between the star\u2019s outer convective envelope and its stellar interior.\n\nAs in a hot pot of soup, stellar material that is brought to the bottom of the convection zone reaches temperatures of two and a half million Kelvin and subsequently destroyed, says Korn.\n\nKorn says that particle physicists, nuclear theorists and observational astrophysicists have all had their nose to the grindstone, trying to resolve this lithium-7 underabundance issue for decades now.\n\nIt\u2019s important to understand just how much lithium is depleted by stars because only then can we scientifically address the remaining cosmological lithium problem, says Korn.\n\nIn a 2021 paper published in the journal Experimental Astronomy, the authors write that a proposed European Space Agency mission known as HAYDN (High precision AsteroseismologY of DeNse stellar fields) would potentially see launch by mid-century. If so, it would observe stars in metal-poor globular clusters in both our own Milky Way Galaxy and nearby dwarf galaxies.\n\nThe HAYDN mission will be crucial to getting a better handle on the real abundance of Lithium in the Milky Way and nearby dwarf galaxies like the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds via a process known as asteroseismology which uses stellar oscillations (literally seismic waves inside a star) to probe its interior.\n\nThese space-based observations, says Korn, would help theorists place better constraints on just how much lithium-7 is being destroyed in stellar interiors.\n\nI\u2019m upholding the idea that at least part, or even a significant part, of the problem is a stellar problem, says Korn. But it remains a hard nut to crack, he says.",

      "text": "Out of scores of books on the origins and machinations of the universe, it\u2019s rare to find one that offers something new. But kudos to Ersilia Vaudo, the author of her newly translated book: \u201cThe Story of Astrophysics in Five Revolutions.\u201d\nReplete with dozens of \u2018inside baseball\u2019-type revelations about the history of astronomy and astrophysics, the Italian, Paris-based author and astronomy communicator and her translator Vanessa Di Stefano have put together a book that is in parts both breezy and profound.\nMade up of five long chapters, \u201cThe Story of Astrophysics\u201d details different revolutionary aspects of humankind\u2019s understanding of cosmic history. Here are a tiny few of the book\u2019s more interesting tidbits.\nThe Question Of The Speed Of Light\nIn a 1638 experiment, Galilei Galileo used two lanterns covered by dark cloths placed on two small hills about a mile apart. Galileo uncovered his lantern first and when a student about a mile away saw the light from Galileo\u2019s lantern, he reciprocated. But the time elapsed between the two events was much too short for Galileo to calculate.\nYet Sir Isaac Newton made great progress in our understanding of light speed by successfully calculating the time it takes for light to travel from the Sun to Earth. As noted in his 1704 \u201cOpticks\u201d treatise, Newton found a value of between 7 and 8 minutes which is incredibly close to the actual value of 8 minutes and 20 seconds.\nA century and a half later, Vaudo notes, the speed of light, c, makes its appearance in the late 19th equations formulated by Scottish physicist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell.\nMaxwell used his math to describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves which travel at the same speed as light, Vaudo notes. This suggested that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, a theoretical conclusion later confirmed by German physicist Heinrich Hertz, she writes.\nWe now know that light in a vacuum travels at the incredible constant speed of 299,792,458 meters per second.\nUnderstanding that light has a finite speed and linking it to the larger realm of electromagnetism helped secure the spacetime distance scale that is a foundation of contemporary cosmology. Accessing the full electromagnetic spectrum for observations also gave astronomers a multifaceted observational window onto the universe.\nThat\u2019s because almost everything cosmologists know about the universe comes from observations of electromagnetic radiation in the form of visible light, as well as wavelengths that run the gamut --- from the far infrared to the highest energy gamma rays.\nBeyond The Electromagnetic Spectrum\nLately, however, astronomers are even searching for and detecting high-energy cosmic ray particles, neutrino particles, and gravitational radiation --- none of which are part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Who can say what new methods of observing the cosmos might exist in the medium and far future?\nBut we wouldn\u2019t be here at all if not for a seeming fluke of nature that allowed matter to persist in a way that antimatter never could.\nWhat\u2019s The Deal With Antimatter?\nIn the beginning, the Universe was very dense and hot, and particles of matter and antimatter interacted, annihilating each other, notes Vaudo. But there was an imbalance allowing one of the two to survive, even though today, this tiny imbalance is not enough to explain the structure of the cosmos, she writes.\nAnd the ultimate cause of this imbalance is still not understood.\nCould There Be Antigalaxies?\nIf there were \u201cantigalaxies, we would see bright flashes in the sky due to the mutual annihilation between matter and antimatter but, thus far, that has never been observed, Vaudo notes.\nSmall amounts of antimatter are also produced by lightning during a thunderstorm but they are almost instantly annihilated by matter, Vaudo notes. Even so, she writes that one day it may be possible to use annihilating antiprotons to destroy cancerous tumors.\nBut until then the cosmos is appreciated for its scientific and philosophical value.\nAn Artistic Case In Point\nPainted in Rome in 1609, Adam Elsheimer\u2019s \u201cThe Flight into Egypt\u201d depicts a nighttime sky which highlights three sources of light. As Vaudo notes, they include Joseph walking with a torch in hand behind Mary and the Child on a donkey; a flickering fire around which some shepherds are warming themselves; and the reflection of a full Moon on a still lake.\nBut above all, there\u2019s a beautiful, star-filled nighttime sky which, for the first time in the history of art, the Milky Way appears in a painting, depicted with remarkable accuracy, Vaudo notes. The author speculates that Elsheimer must have scrutinized the scattered positions of the stars a thousand times to achieve such precision.\nOnly a hundred years ago, we still believed that the Milky Way was the whole Universe, Vaudo writes. In less than a century, we have understood that our universe is undergoing an accelerating expansion and is neither immutable nor eternal, she notes. Galaxies will gradually become more and more distant from each other and in billions of years\u2019 time, even with the most powerful telescopes, we will not be able to see anything but darkness beyond our Milky Way, she writes.\nBut that remains beyond anyone\u2019s imagining.\nThe Bottom Line?\nThe book is a compelling primer on the history of almost everything we know about astrophysics and why it\u2019s relevant to our existence. As the author notes in closing: French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal sums up a powerful feeling triggered by looking up at the skies: \u201cThe eternal silence of these infinite spaces terrifies me.\u201d\nIndeed, a clear night-sky is uniquely humbling; that\u2019s just a small part of the inherent attraction and ultimate mystery that is our cosmos."
