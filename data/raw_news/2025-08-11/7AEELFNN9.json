  "title": "Panic in eastern Ukraine as Trump entertains idea of giving parts of it to Russia",
  "description": "Across the Donetsk region, word of Steve Witkoff\u2019s emerging deal with the Kremlin, confused in details, and immediately refused by Kyiv, has put lives already ravaged by war into a deeper spin.",
  "content": "On the beaches of Sloviansk\u2019s tiny salt lake, where the medicinal waters provide a moment of solace from the whirling violence of the eastern frontlines just a few miles away, talk of a Ukraine land deal at Friday\u2019s Alaska summit seems dark and surreal.\n\n\u201cI feel like I just float away from this reality,\u201d said local journalist Mykhailo, in between dips into the water, from the lake\u2019s sands overlooked by a large concrete bomb shelter. Shelling is regular near here, which Mykhailo jokingly calls \u201cthe Salt Lake City of Sloviansk\u201d.\n\nBut the Kremlin\u2019s proposal to US special envoy Steve Witkoff to exchange a ceasefire for the parts of Donbass Russia has yet to conquer means this town, and those near it, could suddenly become Moscow\u2019s territory. And even on this quiet beach, it\u2019s caused what Mykhailo calls \u201cpanic.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of my friends want to stay here and we all will have to leave,\u201d he said. \u201cBut frankly speaking I don\u2019t think it is going to happen.\u201d There is defiance, and recognition the high stakes diplomacy US President Donald Trump is engaged in with Russian President Vladimir Putin may fall as flat in execution as it has been hurried in preparation.\n\n\u201cWhat Trump did wrong he took him out of the bog \u2013 he took him out and said \u2018Vladimir, I want to talk to you. I just like you,\u2019\u201d said Mykailo. \u201cHe didn\u2019t care that every day Ukrainians die.\u201d\n\nTo Ludmila, moving herself to the waters in an arm-propelled wheelchair, the salt lake is a brief moment of buoyancy that provides relief from her injuries from stepping on a land mine two years ago. It is a daily pain that leaves her unimpressed by diplomacy.\n\n\u201cThere, they are lying\u201d, she said, waving her hand dismissively. \u201cFor them it is all a spectacle. They decide one thing, say another, and do another. That\u2019s always been politics.\u201d\n\nAcross the Donetsk region, word of Witkoff\u2019s emerging deal with the Kremlin, confused in details, and immediately refused by Kyiv, has put lives already ravaged by war into a deeper spin.\n\nThe town of Sloviansk was first taken by Moscow\u2019s proxy \u201cseparatists\u201d in 2014 before Ukrainian forces retook control. New ditches have been hastily dug to its west to prepare for the possibility Russia\u2019s ongoing offensive might threaten the town itself once again. But few imagined their key ally, the United States, might entertain the idea of giving their home away.\n\nIn the town\u2019s maternity ward, the only functioning facility of its kind for miles, Taisiya strokes Assol, her daughter born Sunday into a world where suddenly the risks of being in Sloviansk have multiplied.\n\n\u201cI saw the news\u201d, she said. \u201cThat would be very bad. But we have no influence on that. It\u2019s not going to be our decision. People will just give away their homes.\u201d\n\nBirths and deaths continue, that of Sofia Lamekhova particularly distressing. Her parents, Natalia and Sviatoslav, had been glad when she and her husband, Mykyta, decided to live with their newborn son Lev in Kyiv. As Sviatoslav said: \u201cWe wanted them to be further from the frontline. Here in Sloviansk, every day there are drone attacks and shelling.\u201d\n\nBut the family of three were found in the rubble of the July 31 airstrike on an apartment block in Kyiv, killed together by the building\u2019s collapse. Sofia was three months pregnant and due in Sloviansk in a few days, to tell her friends the good news.\n\n\u201cThey left from the war, and it was quiet there, but the war caught them there\u201d, said Natalia. Sviatoslav added: \u201cTo come to terms with that as a person is impossible. It is impossible to come to terms with the loss of children.\u201d\n\nThey had spoken the night before Sofia died. \u201cShe said she really wanted to come to Sloviansk\u201d, said Natalia. \u201cTo tell everyone the news, spread the joy. But they didn\u2019t return. They came back together, differently.\u201d\n\nSofia\u2019s mother is macabrely referring to the family\u2019s burial on the outskirts of town. A Ukrainian jet roars overhead as she and her husband tend the dusty flowers on their burial mounds. The couple cannot leave Sloviansk \u2013 their home, but also where they provide food and water aid to many of the locals, often elderly who live alone and survive on handouts.\n\nThe nearest train station is Kramatorsk, the de facto capital of Ukrainian held Donetsk, a bustling town, where civilian life sustains among the military who are based there. A vast airstrike took down a central building \u2013 tearing through its four storeys and into its basement. Russian drone attacks are regular. But the city brims with the urgent business of survival in war, and the war itself.\n\nThe train from Kyiv arrives to air raid sirens on Monday. Dozens sit on the platform to greet and replace those arriving from the capital. Weeping is Tetyana, whose husband Serhiy, has been fighting since the second day of Russia\u2019s full invasion and has been given two days off from his tank unit outside Kostiantynivka to celebrate his birthday.\n\nAs Tetyana weeps, the soldier gently admonishes her fuss. \u201cIt would have been better if she had not come\u201d, he said. \u201cCalm down.\u201d Tetyana has little interest in the wider machinations of Trump\u2019s diplomacy. \u201cDo you know what my dream is? Just for my husband to come home. I don\u2019t care about those territories. I just want him to be alive and come home.\u201d\n\nThe train picks up to return to the capital, men placing their hands to its moving glass windows, and a girl etching a heart on a closing door. The sirens continue.",

      "text": "Not for the first time, European capitals are gripped with apprehension that Russian President Vladimir Putin will surgically divide the transatlantic alliance as well as get everything he wants in Ukraine.\nAhead of the suddenly announced summit in Alaska on Friday between Putin and US President Donald Trump, one European diplomat, who declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak on the record, told CNN: \u201cWe are at risk of being a footnote in history.\u201d\nIn part, European fears are down to just how little is known about what the Kremlin has proposed in order to halt the fighting in Ukraine. Putin has given no details. US envoy Steve Witkoff said nothing after his meeting with the Russian leader last Wednesday.\nTrump himself said after Witkoff left Moscow: \u201cIt\u2019s very complicated. We\u2019re going to get some back, we\u2019re going to get some switched. There will be some swapping of territories, to the betterment of both.\u201d\nThe Europeans fear \u201cthe betterment of both\u201d is a very unlikely outcome. There is zero indication that Putin has shifted an inch on his maximalist demands \u2013 either territorially or in terms of Ukraine remaining a punching bag for Russia without any security guarantees and with limits on the size and capabilities of its military.\n\u201cThere is no sense in Paris, Berlin or London that seizing someone else\u2019s territory matters to this US administration, and the (Europeans) find that deeply disturbing,\u201d said the diplomat.\nThe UK, France, Germany, Italy and the EU felt obliged to say in a joint statement Saturday: \u201cWe remain committed to the principle that international borders must not be changed by force.\u201d Poland and Finland also signed the statement.\nThey spent much of the day making the case to US Vice President JD Vance, who was about to start a vacation in the UK, and trying to get clarity on what would be negotiated.\nThe \u201cTrump Administration has described Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s reported demands for a ceasefire in Ukraine in four different ways since August 6,\u201d according to the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a Washington DC-based think-tank.\nThere is one thread common to all versions: that Putin will demand that Ukrainian forces withdraw from all parts of Donetsk region they still hold. This would include substantial cities: Slovyansk, Kramatorsk and Kostyantynivka.\n\u201cConceding to such a demand would force Ukraine to abandon its \u201cfortress belt,\u201d the main fortified defensive line in Donetsk Oblast since 2014,\u201d noted ISW, exposing Ukraine to further aggression down the line.\nMick Ryan, who tracks the Ukrainian conflict in his Futura Doctrina blog, said Sunday that \u201cUkraine, more than anyone, understands that ceded territory would then be used as the launch pad for future Russian aggression.\u201d\nThe parallels with the Munich Agreement between British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and Adolf Hitler in 1938 are striking. Even after the Nazis invaded Czechoslovakia, Chamberlain said he had been assured by Hitler: \u201cThis is the last territorial claim which I have to make in Europe.\u201d\nUnknown: whether Putin will persist in his demand that Russia also be ceded control of two other Ukrainian regions \u2013 Kherson and Zaporizhzhia \u2013 whose regional capitals are still in Ukrainian hands. Or whether he would accept a freeze along the current frontlines in these regions, part of which run through open countryside and would be difficult to monitor.\nIt\u2019s also unclear whether Putin will demand Ukraine recognize Moscow\u2019s sovereignty over Crimea \u2013 and if so, what he might offer in return. Zelensky has already pointed out that the Ukrainian constitution prevents giving up any of its territory.\nThere is also a question over the sequence of events, with the Europeans regarding a ceasefire as the precondition for any talk about territory. \u201cThe current line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations,\u201d the European leaders said Saturday.\nAnother unknown: whether the Kremlin will agree to some sort of European \u201creassurance force\u201d that would guarantee the ceasefire. All the indications to date are that it will not permit any NATO member to contribute to such a force.\nThe European leaders said in a statement Saturday that there must be \u201crobust and credible security guarantees that enable Ukraine to effectively defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\u201d\nBut experience suggests the Europeans may be whistling in the wind, for all their efforts to flatter and pacify Trump.\n\u201cSince his inauguration in January, the Europeans have bought unlimited passes for the Trump roller coaster ride. They have climbed on, strapped themselves in, and regularly screamed out in terror but failed to get off,\u201d said Rym Momtaz at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington DC-based think tank.\nThey are paying the price for not developing a strategic identity independent of US apron-strings, as French President Emmanuel Macron has been urging for eight years.\nAs much as they want to support and protect Ukraine, the Europeans are reduced to pleading \u2013 and guessing what might be decided in their absence.\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, who is convening a meeting of EU foreign ministers on Monday to discuss \u201cRussia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine,\u201d said Sunday that \u201cany deal between the US and Russia must have Ukraine and the EU included, for it is a matter of Ukraine\u2019s and the whole of Europe\u2019s security.\u201d\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz struck the same tone in an interview on Sunday, saying, \u201cWe cannot accept that territorial issues between Russia and America are discussed or even decided over the heads of Europeans and Ukrainians. I assume that the American government sees it the same way.\u201d\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Monday that the US had pledged to consult its European partners before the summit. But about what and in what forum remains unclear.\nTo Ryan, a former Australian general who now tracks the conflict, Europe\u2019s predicament is much more hazardous than it should be, because \u2013 he says \u2013 the US itself has no Ukraine strategy.\n\u201cThere is just anger, impulses, social media posts, multiple course-changes in direction and an underpinning desire from Trump to win the Nobel Peace Prize.\u201d"

      "text": "Location matters, former real estate mogul US President Donald Trump said. Moments later he announced Alaska, a place sold by Russia to the United States 158 years ago for $7.2 million, would be where Russian President Vladimir Putin tries to sell his land deal of the century, getting Kyiv to hand over chunks of land he\u2019s not yet been able to occupy.\nThe conditions around Friday\u2019s summit so wildly favor Moscow, it is obvious why Putin leapt at the chance, after months of fake negotiation, and it is hard to see how a deal emerges from the bilateral that does not eviscerate Ukraine. Kyiv and its European allies have reacted with understandable horror at the early ideas of Trump\u2019s envoy, Steve Witkoff, that Ukraine cede the remainders of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in exchange for a ceasefire.\nNaturally, the Kremlin head has promoted the idea of taking ground without a fight, and found a willing recipient in the form of Witkoff, who has in the past exhibited a relaxed grasp of Ukrainian sovereignty and the complexity of asking a country, in the fourth year of its invasion, to simply walk out of towns it\u2019s lost thousands of men defending.\nIt is worth pausing and reflecting on what Witkoff\u2019s proposal would look like. Russia is close to encircling two key Donetsk towns, Pokrovsk and Kostiantynivka, and may effectively put Ukrainian troops defending these two hubs under siege in the coming weeks. Ceding these two towns might be something Kyiv does anyway to conserve manpower in the months ahead.\nThe rest of Donetsk \u2013 principally the towns of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk \u2013 is a much nastier prospect. Thousands of civilians live there now, and Moscow would delight at scenes where the towns evacuate, and Russian troops walk in without a shot fired.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\u2019s rejection of ceding land early Saturday reflects the real dilemma of a commander in chief trying to manage the anger of his military and the deep-seated distrust of the Ukrainian people towards their neighbor, who continues to bombard their cities nightly.\nWhat could Ukraine get back in the \u201cswapping\u201d Trump referred to? Perhaps the tiny slivers of border areas occupied by Russia in Sumy and Kharkiv regions \u2013 part of Putin\u2019s purported \u201cbuffer zone\u201d \u2013 but not much else, realistically.\nThe main goal is a ceasefire, and that itself is a stretch. Putin has long held that the immediate ceasefire demanded by the United States, Europe and Ukraine for months, is impossible as technical work about monitoring and logistics must take place first. He is unlikely to have changed his mind now his troops are in the ascendancy across the eastern frontline.\nEurope is also wary of mirroring the failure of former UK Foreign Secretary Neville Chamberlain to stand up to Nazi Germany in 1938 \u2013 of the worthlessness of a \u201cpiece of paper\u201d signed by a Kremlin that has repeatedly agreed to deals in Ukraine and then simply used the pause to regroup before invading again.\nTo his credit, Putin has made it clear what he wants from the start: all of Ukraine subjugated or occupied and a strategic reset with the US that involves it dropping Kyiv like a stone. His aide, Yury Ushakov, spoke of Alaska being a great place to talk economic cooperation between Washington and Moscow, and suggested a return summit in Russia had already been proposed.\nThere is a risk we see bonhomie between Trump and Putin that allows the US president to tolerate more technical meetings between their staffers on the what and when of any ceasefire deal. A plan about land swaps or grabs that is wholly in Moscow\u2019s favor, might then be presented to Kyiv, with the old US ultimatums about aid and intelligence sharing being contingent on their accepting the deal that we have seen before. Cue French President Emmanuel Macron on the phone to Trump again, and around we go. Putin needs more time to continue to conquer and he is about to get it.\nWhat has changed since the last time Trump found his thinking dragged somehow back towards Russia\u2019s orbit, around the time of the Oval Office blowout with Zelensky? Two elements are there now that were absent then.\nFirstly, we cannot ignore that India and China \u2013 the former risking 25% tariffs in two weeks and the latter still waiting to learn what damage it\u2019ll suffer \u2013 were on the phone to the Kremlin in the past days. They might have provided some impetus for Putin to meet Trump, or at least provide more lip service to diplomacy again, and may be concerned at their energy imports being compromised by Trump\u2019s secondary sanctions.\nBut Putin cannot have needed much persuading to agree to a formal invitation to the US to have the bilateral meeting his team have long held out as the way towards peace in Ukraine. And another sanctions deadline of Friday has just whizzed past, almost unnoticed in the kerfuffle about Alaska and land deals.\nSecondly, Trump claims his thinking around Putin has evolved. \u201cDisappointed,\u201d \u201cdisgusting,\u201d \u201ctapping me along\u201d are all newcomers to his lexicon about the Kremlin head. While Trump appears effortlessly able to stop himself causing genuine pain to Moscow, allowing threats and deadlines to fall lifeless around him, he is surrounded by allies and Republicans who will remind him of how far down these roads he has gone before.\nMuch could go right. But the stage is set for something more sinister. Consider Putin\u2019s mindset for a moment. The third Trump threat of sanctions has evaporated, and his forces are moving into a period of strategic gain on the frontlines. He\u2019s got his first invitation to the US in a decade to talk peace about Ukraine without Ukraine, discussing a deal where he doesn\u2019t even have to fight to get some of the rest of the land he wants. And this is before the former KGB spy gets to work his apparent magic on Trump.\nFriday is six days away, but even at this distance resembles slow defeat for Kyiv."
