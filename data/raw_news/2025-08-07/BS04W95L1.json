  "title": "Is That a Legit Zoom Call or Are You Getting Hacked?",
  "description": "Hackers could bypass network security by exploiting popular video-chat platforms. At Black Hat, a security expert says Zoom and Teams are most vulnerable; only one has released a patch.",
  "content": "Major networks get hacked every week, and at Praetorian Security, Adam Crosser\u2019s job is to find new and different ways to break into valuable targets. His goal is to help network defenders head off new attacks, and his session at the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas exposed a new way that scammers could get past network security by misusing two major video conferencing platforms . Spoiler alert\u2014one of them patched their software to foil this attack just before Black Hat started. But the other one didn\u2019t.\n\nIn the movies, network hacking is fast. A hacker in a hoodie pounds the keyboard for a few minutes and announces, \u201cI\u2019m in!\u201d In the real world, infiltrating a corporate network is a gradual process. Hackers start by slipping a tiny, nondescript program into the network. Then, they send instructions that let that program gradually expand its access, quietly and steadily working toward full control.\n\nModern network security naturally aims to prevent this kind of skullduggery. The essential command and control communication with that initial intruding process is a big red flag for network intrusion monitors. A modern hacker needs a communication avenue that doesn\u2019t stand out.\n\nCrosser's team set out to find an ideal connection for short-term command and control . They identified four important criteria. \u201cFirst is latency,\" he said, meaning the connection needs to be fast and responsive. \u201cThen throughput,\u201d he continued, meaning the amount of data. \u201cYou need both.\u201d\n\nHis next criterion was reach\u2014the technology must be widely available. He gave Tor and IRC as examples of tech that never got (and still don't) have sufficient reach. Finally, the technology must be trusted by its users and network administrators.\n\nCrosser reviewed several connection types, demonstrating that each failed one or more of the four criteria. These included using DNS communication, working through cloud storage, and even email. Web conferencing systems such as Zoom and Teams , however, checked all four boxes, making them ideal intrusion methods.\n\nCrosser noted that web conferencing systems themselves have to do a lot of work breaking through network restrictions. Microsoft Teams support recommends using split tunneling to avoid connecting through a VPN , for example. If your network security keeps the CEO from attending video meetings, well, he\u2019s not going to be happy.\n\nCrosser, going into detail comprehensible only to the network-savvy attendees, laid out all the steps Zoom may go through trying to connect from within a highly secure network. In short, if one technique doesn\u2019t work, it just tries and tries again until it finds a way to connect, or just fails, prompting that call from the CEO to the IT department.\n\n\u201cZoom and Teams are the most popular by a wide margin,\u201d noted Crosser. \u201cWe focused on these two solutions. Even if your business uses Google Meet internally, you surely have external meetings that use one of these.\u201d The point here is that your attack won\u2019t get caught breaking through security because the video conferencing tool has already punched right through it.\n\nCrosser explained how the team extracted authentication credentials from a Zoom or Teams call and used them to piggyback their own traffic on that connection. In live demos, he showed that it was possible to covertly download a file to the victim's system. That's where the real danger lies: someone who thinks they're trying to connect to a video call ends up with malware on their company computer that could steal their data or the company's data or, worse, launch a ransomware attack against the whole firm.\n\nThe attack technique involves a technology called TURN, a network protocol for connecting devices that can\u2019t easily connect directly. The team coded up an app that they called TURNt, for TURN tunneler, which Crosser made available to attendees.\n\nCrosser noted that just before Black Hat, Zoom released a patch that defeats the TURNt attack, but Teams is still vulnerable. He concluded with thoughts for future research in this area. \u201cIt\u2019s a good entry point for new researchers,\u201d he said. \u201cPick a topic, expand on it, see if you can make something that functions.\u201d",

  "argos_summary": "At the Black Hat security conference, Adam Crosser from Praetorian Security revealed vulnerabilities in major video conferencing platforms, specifically Zoom and Microsoft Teams, which could be exploited by hackers for command and control communications. His research demonstrated that these platforms meet key criteria for stealthy intrusions, allowing attackers to extract authentication credentials and potentially deploy malware. While Zoom patched a vulnerability before the conference, Teams remains susceptible, highlighting ongoing security challenges in widely used communication tools.",
