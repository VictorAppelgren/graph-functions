  "description": "Public trust and the convenience of mail-in voting mean Donald Trump\u2019s push to ban it is unlikely to gain traction",
  "content": "To great fanfare in 2021, Democrats in the House of Representatives introduced H.R. 1 \u2014 designed to, among other things, expand voting rights and access. While the Constitution grants states the power to prescribe the time, place, and manner of elections for federal office, Congress can alter or preempt state regulations. The bill passed the House on a party-line vote and advanced to the Senate, where it was killed by a Republican-led filibuster. The legislation was a sprawling effort to federalize many electoral responsibilities traditionally reserved for the states. To take just one timely and pertinent example, , a provision of HR 1 would have banned partisan gerrymanders \u2014 requiring states to set up independent redistricting commissions.\n\nNow Donald Trump has proposed some sweeping changes, writing on social media that he would \u201clead a movement to get rid of MAIL-IN BALLOTS.\u201d Additionally, the president wants to target what he sees in his words as \u201cHighly \u2018Inaccurate,\u2019 Very Expensive, and Seriously Controversial VOTING MACHINES.\u201d He wants to institute universal voter ID. While the specifics of an executive order or a legislative push have not been announced, the president\u2019s plan to ban voting by mail is unlikely to get significant public support for several reasons. Americans trust their local election officers, and they like convenience. They have generally applauded efforts to expand mail-in voting , although there are partisan differences. Americans are also aware of risks associated with this method of voting.\n\nThe polls on this issue take us back decades. In 1959, 88% told Gallup they thought people with disabilities or serious injuries should be able to vote by mail. Another question asked if businessmen away on business should be able to do so, and 79% said they should. Pollsters didn\u2019t devote much attention to mail voting again until the mid-1990s, around the time Oregon considered and adopted a universal vote by mail. A Pew poll from 1996 found that 48% thought everyone should be allowed to vote by mail, while 47% disagreed.\n\nPollsters ramped up their work during COVID, and they asked questions about possibility of voter fraud if voting my mail was extended. An April 2020 Gallup poll found that 64% favored allowing all voters to vote by mail in the 2020 election. Forty-nine percent in a broader question said there would be more fraud if all voters cast their votes by mail, 29% about the same amount, and 20% less. A 2020 late summer Pew poll found that 25% believed voter fraud had been a major problem in terms of voting by mail , 27% a minor one, 27% not a problem at all, and 20% were not sure.\n\nPew has been asking self-identified voters about their confidence that their votes were counted accurately for many years. In 2020, when they asked people about in-person voting and separately, absentee or voting by mail, 57% were confident that mail or absentee votes were counted as intended. In their post 2024 election poll, 75% percent of self-identified voters, up from 57% in 2020, said the votes of those who voted absentee or by mail were counted as intended. In the poll, 90% felt confident that the votes of those who voted in person were counted as intended, and 92% gave that response about their own vote.\n\nIn this poll, like past ones, Republican voters\u2019 belief that votes cast by mail had been counted as intended (72%), was almost as high as the Democratic voter response (78%). The answers of Democratic voters reflected a lower degree of confidence than they reported in Pew\u2019s 2020 poll (95%), following their party\u2019s presidential victory. Republican voters expressed more confidence in 2024 than in 2020, when only 19% gave that response. In their new 2025 poll, Republicans were much less enthusiastic (32%) than Democrats (83%) about allowing anyone to vote by mail. In the poll on a number of election policies, 58% strongly favored allowing any voter to vote by mail if they want to. The 58% is down from 70% who gave that response in April 2020 during the pandemic.\n\nFor the vast majority of Americans, voting is easy because we have made it so. At least as far as public opinion is concerned, voting by mail is here to stay. Americans have high trust in local election officials, and their support for voting absentee or by mail reflects that confidence. They like not only the convenience, but the opportunity to make the choice about how to vote themselves.. Those of us who would like to restore the civic ritual of people going to the polls on Election Day have lost this battle. And so will Trump.",

  "summary": "The article discusses the potential impact of proposed changes to voting by mail in the US, including banning it and introducing universal voter ID. While the Constitution grants states the power to set elections for federal office, Congress can alter or preempt state regulations. The author suggests that while the majority of Americans trust their local election officers and enjoy convenience, they also fear voter fraud. The article also notes that public trust in local election officials and that public opinion reflects the convenience of voting by email rather than in person. However, there are partisan differences over whether or not mail voting should be allowed for all voters in the 2020 election. A recent survey by Gallup found that 64% of respondents were in favor of allowing all voters to vote by mail, while 29% disagreed. The authors suggest that public support for mail voting is likely to outweigh the risk of voter fraud, with 25% believing voter fraud if all voters cast their votes by mail compared to 27% and 20% not.",
  "shortSummary": "Despite widespread support and controversy for expanding mail voting, public opinion remains divided as to which parties and opinions vary significantly, with President Donald Trump proposing sweeping changes.",

      "text": "Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand how U.S. voters view the 2024 presidential election and the voting process.\nFor this analysis, we surveyed 9,609 U.S. adults, including 8,072 U.S. citizens who reported having voted in the November election. The survey was conducted Nov. 12-17, 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), a group of people recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses who have agreed to take surveys regularly. This kind of recruitment gives nearly all U.S. adults a chance of selection. Surveys were conducted either online or by telephone with a live interviewer. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other factors. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology.\nHere are the questions used for this report, the topline and the survey methodology.\nAmerican voters overwhelmingly say the 2024 elections across the country and in their own communities were run well this year, and they express high levels of confidence that votes were counted accurately.\nThis stands in stark contrast to four years ago, when far fewer voters expressed confidence. Today, 88% of voters say that elections across the United States were run and administered at least somewhat well, up from 59% of voters in 2020.\nThis year\u2019s rosier view of election administration is entirely driven by a shift in views among those who voted for Donald Trump for president:\n- 93% of Trump voters say the 2024 elections were run and administered at least somewhat well. Four years ago, as Trump was contesting his defeat by Joe Biden, just 21% of his supporters said the elections were run well.\n- Voters who supported Kamala Harris for president are less likely today to say the elections this November were run well than Biden\u2019s voters were four years ago. Still, a wide majority of Harris voters (84%) this year say elections across the country were run well.\nIt\u2019s not unusual in presidential elections for voters who supported the winning candidate to express more confidence in the outcome than those who supported the losing candidate, but the size of the gap in 2020 was particularly large.\nJump to read more about views of the voting process.\nThe latest national survey by Pew Research Center \u2013 conducted Nov. 12-17, 2024, among 9,609 adults (including 8,072 adults who say they voted in the 2024 election) \u2013 finds that more positive perceptions of election administration and accuracy this year extend to several specific aspects of elections, including confidence in different voting methods.\nIn the 2020 presidential election, Trump voters were far less confident than Biden voters in the accuracy of both in-person and mail-in ballot counts. While Republican voters\u2019 confidence in the accuracy of vote counts rebounded somewhat in the 2022 midterm, wide gaps remained.\nToday, Trump voters are somewhat more likely than Harris voters to express confidence in the vote counts of in-person ballots, and Harris voters are just 6 percentage points more likely than Trump voters to have confidence in mail-in ballot vote counts.\nIn-person voting\n- 94% of Trump voters are at least somewhat confident that votes cast in person were counted as voters intended, up 30 points from 2020.\n- 86% of Harris voters are confident in the counts of in-person ballots. This is 12 points lower than the nearly unanimous confidence in these counts among Biden\u2019s 2020 voters.\nAbsentee or mail-in voting\n- In 2020, just 19% of Trump voters expressed confidence in the count accuracy of ballots cast by mail. Today, 72% of Trump voters are confident that mail and absentee votes in the 2024 election were counted as voters intended.\n- Nearly all 2020 Biden voters (95%) were confident in the count of absentee ballots in 2020. A narrower, though still clear, majority of Harris voters (78%) say this about the 2024 election.\nMany Trump voters continue to have concerns about people voting illegally\nWhile Trump voters express more confidence about most aspects of election administration and voting, a sizable share continue to register concerns about people who are ineligible casting ballots.\nToday, 45% of Trump voters say they are at least somewhat confident that people who were not legally qualified to vote were prevented from casting ballots. While there is more confidence in this than before the election, 55% of Trump voters still say they have little to no confidence ineligible voters were kept from voting.\nAs was the case before the election, an overwhelming majority of Harris supporters are confident that those not eligible to vote were prevented from casting ballots.\nJump to read more about how preelection expectations match up to postelection perceptions.\nOther findings: Voting methods in the 2024 presidential election, views of the campaign and choice in vote\nHarris voters were much more likely than Trump voters to cast a ballot by mail. Roughly a third of voters cast their ballots absentee or by mail (35%), while similar shares voted in person before Election Day (32%) and in person on Election Day (34%). Voters were less likely to vote by mail than in 2020. But, as in 2020, Democratic voters were much more likely than Republican voters to cast their ballot by mail (44% vs. 26%).\nFor more on voting in the 2024 election, see Chapter 2.\nTrump voters express more positive views of the presidential campaign after the election. A month prior to the election, just two-in-ten of both Harris and Trump supporters said the 2024 campaign made them feel proud of the country, while about four-in-ten in both groups said it was focused on important policy debates (37% of Trump supporters, 38% of Harris supporters).\nTrump voters now reflect on the campaign in rosier terms, while the views of Harris voters have grown more negative. Half of Trump voters now say the campaign made them feel proud, but just 8% of Harris voters say this. And 52% of Trump voters now say the campaign was focused on important policy debates, compared with 18% of Harris voters.\nRead more about voters\u2019 reflections on the 2024 campaign here.\nMost Trump voters say their vote was for him \u2013 rather than against Harris. Mirroring the 2020 presidential race, voters who supported Harris in the election were about equally likely to say their vote was primarily in support of her (49%) as to say it was primarily against Trump (51%). Trump voters in 2024 \u2013 like 2020 \u2013 were much more likely to say their vote was for Trump (82%) rather than against his opponent (18%)."

Eighty-three percent of Democrats say they favor such a measure, but fewer than half as many Republicans, 40%, express the same sentiment.

Yet across all age groups, a majority of Americans back the idea. While most registered voters (62%) favor such measures, unregistered voters are even more likely (75%) to do so.\nOf the one-third of respondents who say they have ever voted by absentee ballot or mail in an election, 71% favor their state allowing all voters to cast ballots this way in November. This drops to 60% among those who have not voted absentee or by mail.\nFraud and the 2020 Vote\nGallup also asked respondents whether they were concerned about fraud in the electoral process as an outcome of voting by mail. Overall, nearly half of Americans say there would be more fraud if ballots were cast by mail, 29% say there would be the same amount, and 20% think there would be less fraud.\n| More fraud | Same amount | Less fraud | No opinion | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| % | % | % | % | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| All Americans | 49 | 29 | 20 | 2 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| Political affiliation | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| Republicans | 76 | 16 | 6 | 1 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| Independents | 48 | 32 | 18 | 2 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| Democrats | 27 | 39 | 33 | 2 | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| Gallup, April 14-28 |\nAs with overall support for voting by mail, there is a substantial partisan divide when it comes to concerns over voter fraud. Roughly three in four Republicans (76%) say that more fraud is likely if all voters cast their ballots by mail. Democrats, on the other hand, are not concerned: 27% say there would be more fraud while 39% say voting by mail would witness the same amount of fraud and 33% say there would be less.\nHow Much Fraud?\nWhen asked how much fraud there would be if all voters were allowed to vote by mail this year, 31% of national adults think there would be a great deal, 30% a fair amount, 28% only a little and 10% none. Again, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say they would expect a great deal of fraud, 50% vs. 16%.\n| A great deal | A fair amount | Only a little | None | No opinion | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| % | % | % | % | % | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| All Americans | 31 | 30 | 28 | 10 | 1 | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| Political affiliaiton | ||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| Republicans | 50 | 31 | 16 | 2 | - | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| Independents | 29 | 33 | 28 | 9 | 1 | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| Democrats | 16 | 24 | 41 | 18 | - | |||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||\n| Gallup, April 14-28 |\nBottom Line\nWhile most Americans support states allowing voters to cast ballots through the mail this November, nearly half say there would be more voter fraud under those circumstances. Attitudes around both voting by mail in general and concern about it causing more voter fraud are politically polarized. Non-registered adults are more likely to favor voting by mail than respondents who identify as registered voters, which could be an indication that non-registered adults may indeed vote if given the mail option.\nView complete question responses and trends (PDF download).\nLearn more about how the Gallup Poll Social Series works."
