  "content": "A federal judge has restricted the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s investigation of Media Matters, the progressive watchdog group, finding that the agency was likely engaged in retaliatory conduct in violation of the First Amendment.\n\nU.S. District Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan wrote in a ruling on Friday, It should alarm all Americans when the Government retaliates against individuals or organizations for engaging in constitutionally protected public debate. And that alarm should ring even louder when the Government retaliates against those engaged in newsgathering and reporting.\u201d\n\u2022 None PBS To Cut Budget By 21% Following Public Media's Loss Of Federal Funding\n\u2022 None Gavin Newsom Out-Trumps Trump With A 2028 POTUS Campaign Launch By Any Other Name To Fight GOP Gerrymandering\n\nThe judge granted a preliminary injunction to halt the FTC\u2019s civil investigative demand, which the agency issued earlier this year as part of a probe of an advertising boycott of Elon Musk\u2019s X. Media Matters has been a target of Musk, members of the Trump administration and their allies after the group published a piece in 2023 on antisemitic posts that appeared next to advertisements from major brands. A number of companies pulled their advertisements from the platform, leading Musk to filed what he called a \u201cthermonuclear lawsuit\u201d against Media Matters.\n\nThat case is still pending. But Donald Trump\u2019s choice to lead the FTC, Andrew Ferguson, in May sent a civil investigative demand letter to Media Matters, seeking information on its contacts with a World Federation of Advertisers initiative called Global Alliance for Responsible Media, as well as other groups.\n\nThe judge wrote, \u201cThere can be no doubt that such a [civil investigative demand] would deter a reporter of ordinary firmness from speaking again. Indeed, the FTC\u2019s CID has had its intended effect. Because of the CID, Media Matters has decided against pursuing certain stories about the FTC, Chairman Ferguson, and Mr. Musk. Finally, given the comments by Chairman Ferguson and his colleagues about Media Matters, the timing of the CID, and evidence of pretext, Media Matters is likely to show that retaliatory animus was the but-for cause of the FTC\u2019s CID.\u201d\n\nIn the face of legal bills, Media Matters has struggled, laying off staff members last year. The New York Times reported last month that the organization also has considered closing up shop.\n\nThe judge wrote that Media Matters was likely to succeed on its First Amendment retaliation claim, finding that it \u201cengaged in quintessential First Amendment activity when it\u201d published the article on Musk . The judge cited some of Ferguson\u2019s previous comments, including on Steve Bannon\u2019s podcast, that \u201cit is \u2018really important that the FTC take investigative steps in the new administration under President Trump\u2019 because \u2018progressives\u2019 and others who are \u2018fighting disinformation\u2019 were \u2018not going to give up just because of the election.'\u201d\n\u2022 None Everything We Know About \u2018Nobody Wants This\u2019 Season 2 So Far\n\u2022 None Everything We Know About Prime Video's \u2018Legally Blonde\u2019 Prequel Series \u2018Elle\u2019\n\nSign up for Deadline's Newsletter.

Media Matters, already strained by legal costs and staff layoffs, has considered shutting down, underscoring the broader impact of the investigation on press freedom.",
